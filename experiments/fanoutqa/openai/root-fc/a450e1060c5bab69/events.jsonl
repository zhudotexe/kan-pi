Its best-known brands include its ThinkPad business line of laptop computers (acquired from IBM), the IdeaPad, Yoga, and Legion consumer lines of laptop computers, and the IdeaCentre and ThinkCentre lines of desktop computers. As of 2021, Lenovo is the world's largest personal computer vendor by unit sales.[8][9]\n\n\nLenovo has operations in over 60 countries and sells its products in around 180+ countries.[*citation needed*] It was incorporated in Hong Kong,[1] with global headquarters in Beijing, and Morrisville, North Carolina, United States.[2][3] It has research centres in Beijing, Chengdu, Yamato (Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan), Singapore, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Morrisville,[4] and also has Lenovo NEC Holdings, a joint venture with NEC that produces personal computers for the Japanese market.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1984–1993: Founding and early history[edit]\n\n\nLenovo was founded in Beijing on 1 November 1984 as **Legend** by a team of engineers led by Liu Chuanzhi and Danny Lui. Initially specializing in televisions, the company migrated towards manufacturing and marketing computers.\n\n![](image)In 1984, Lenovo was founded in Beijing by a team of 4 guards in a shack from the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), led by Liu Chuanzhi.[10]\nLiu Chuanzhi and his group of ten experienced engineers, teaming up with Danny Lui,[11] officially founded Lenovo in Beijing on November 1, 1984, with 200,000 yuan.[10][12] The Chinese government approved Lenovo's incorporation on the same day. Jia Xufu (贾续福), one of the founders of Lenovo, indicated that the first meeting in preparation for starting the company was held on October 17 the same year. Eleven people, the entirety of the initial staff, attended. Each of the founders was a member of the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The 200,000 yuan used as start-up capital was approved by Zeng Maochao (曾茂朝). The name for the company agreed upon at this meeting was the Chinese Academy of Sciences Computer Technology Research Institute New Technology Development Company.[10] Lenovo has increasingly diversified from the personal computer market and made a number of corporate acquisitions, with the most notable being acquiring and integrating most of IBM's personal computer business and its x86-based server business as well as creating its own smartphone.[13]\n\n\nThe organizational structure of the company was established in 1985 after the Chinese New Year. It included technology, engineering, administrative, and office departments.[10] The group first attempted to import televisions but failed. It rebuilt itself as a company doing quality checks on computers. It also tried and failed to market a digital watch.[14]\n\n\nIn May 1988, Lenovo placed its first recruitment advertisement on the front page of the *China Youth News*. Such ads were quite rare in China at the time. Out of the 500 respondents, 280 were selected to take a written employment exam. 120 of these candidates were interviewed in person. Although interviewers initially only had the authority to hire 16 people, 58 were given offers. The new staff included 18 people with graduate degrees, 37 with undergraduate degrees, and three students with no university-level education. Yang Yuanqing, the current chairman and CEO of Lenovo, was among that group.[10]\n\n\nLiu Chuanzhi received government permission to form a subsidiary in Hong Kong and to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in Hong Kong along with Lui, furthered his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to Hong Kong in 1988. To save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. To keep up appearances, they rented hotel rooms for meetings.[10]\n\n\nIn 1990, Lenovo started to manufacture and market computers using its own brand name.[14] Some of the company's early successes included the KT8920 mainframe computer.[10] It also developed a circuit board that allowed IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters.[14]\n\n\n\n### 1994–1998: IPO, second offerings and bond sales[edit]\n\n\nLenovo (known at the time as Legend) became publicly traded after a 1994 Hong Kong IPO that raised nearly US$30 million[15] at HK$1.33 per share.[16] Prior to the IPO, many analysts were optimistic about Lenovo. On its first day of trading, the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00 suggesting an initial under-valuing of the company. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America and Australia, to expand and improve production and research and development, and to increase working capital.[10]\n\n\nBy 1996, Lenovo was the market leader in China and began selling its own laptop.[15] By 1998 it held 43 per cent of the domestic computer market share in China, selling approximately one million computers.[15]\n\n\nLenovo released its Tianxi (天禧) computer in 1998. Designed to make it easy for inexperienced Chinese consumers to use computers and access the internet, one of its most important features was a button that instantly connected users to the internet and opened the Web browser. It was co-branded with China Telecom and it was bundled with one year of Internet service. The Tianxi was released in 1998. It was the result of two years of research and development. It had a pastel-colored, shell-shaped case and a seven-port USB hub under its screen. As of 2000, the Tianxi was the best-selling computer in Chinese history. It sold more than 1,000,000 units in 2000 alone.[17]\n\n\n\n### 1999–2010: IBM purchase and sale of smartphone division[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The ThinkPad logo, as seen on the Lenovo ThinkPad X100e laptop computer. Lenovo purchased the ThinkPad line from IBM in 2005.Further information: Acquisition of the IBM PC business by Lenovo\n\nTo fund its continued growth, Lenovo issued a secondary offering of 50 million shares on the Hong Kong market in March 2000 and raised about US$212 million.[10] It rebranded to the name Lenovo in 2003 and began making acquisitions to expand the company.[15]\n\n\nLenovo acquired IBM's personal computer business in 2005, including the ThinkPad laptop and ThinkCentre desktop lines.[18] Lenovo's acquisition of IBM's personal computer division accelerated access to foreign markets while improving Lenovo's branding and technology.[19] Lenovo paid US$1.25 billion for IBM's computer business and assumed an additional US$500 million of IBM's debt. This acquisition made Lenovo the third-largest computer maker worldwide by volume.[20]\nLenovo's purchase of the Think line from IBM also led to the creation of the IBM/Lenovo partnership, which works together in the creation of Think-line of products sold by Lenovo.\n\n\nOn the purchase of IBM's personal computer division, Chuanzhi said in 2012: \"We benefited in three ways from the IBM acquisition. We got the ThinkPad brand, IBM's more advanced PC manufacturing technology and the company's international resources, such as its global sales channels and operation teams. These three elements have shored up our sales revenue in the past several years.\"[20] The employees of the division, including those who developed ThinkPad laptops and Think Centre desktops, became employees of Lenovo.\n\n\nDespite Lenovo acquiring the \"Think\" brand from IBM, IBM still plays a key indirect, background role in the design and production of the Think line of products. Today, IBM is responsible for overseeing servicing and repair centers, and is considered an authorized distributor and refurbisher of the Think line of products produced by Lenovo.[21]\n\n\nIBM also acquired a 18.9% share of Lenovo in 2005 as part of Lenovo's purchase of IBM's personal computing division.[22] In the years following the deal, IBM sold their stake in Lenovo, with a final sale in 2011 completing their divestment.[23]\n\n\nMary Ma, Lenovo's chief financial officer from 1990 to 2007, was in charge of investor relations. Under her leadership, Lenovo successfully integrated Western-style accountability into its corporate culture. Lenovo's emphasis on transparency earned it a reputation for the best corporate governance among mainland Chinese firms. While Hong Kong-listed firms were only required to issue financial reports twice per year, Lenovo followed the international norm of issuing quarterly reports. Lenovo created an audit committee and a compensation committee with non-management directors. The company started roadshows twice per year to meet institutional investors. Ma organized the first-ever investor relations conference held in mainland China. The conference was held in Beijing in 2002 and televised on China Central Television (CCTV). Liu and Ma co-hosted the conference and both gave speeches on corporate governance.[10]\n\n\nLenovo sold its smartphone and tablet division in 2008 for US$100 million in order to focus on personal computers and then paid US$200 million to buy it back in November 2009.[24] As of 2009[update], the mobile division ranked third in terms of unit share in China's mobile handset market.[25] Lenovo invested CN¥100 million in a fund dedicated to providing seed funding for mobile application development for its LeGarden online app store. As of 2010, LeGarden had more than 1,000 programs available for the LePhone. At the same time, LeGarden counted 2,774 individual developers and 542 developer companies as members.[26]\n\n\n\n### 2011–2013: Re-entering smartphone market and other ventures[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Lenovo Vibe X smartphone at a launch event, 2014\nOn January 27, 2011, Lenovo formed a joint venture to produce personal computers with Japanese electronics firm NEC. The companies said in a statement that they would establish a new company called Lenovo NEC Holdings, to be registered in the Netherlands. NEC received US$175 million in Lenovo stock. Lenovo was to own a 51% stake in the joint venture, while NEC would have 49%. Lenovo has a five-year option to expand its stake in the joint venture.[27]\n\n\nThis joint venture was intended to boost Lenovo's worldwide sales by expanding its presence in Japan, a key market for personal computers. NEC spun off its personal computer business into the joint venture. As of 2010, NEC controlled about 20% of Japan's market for personal computers while Lenovo had a 5% share. Lenovo and NEC also agreed to explore cooperating in other areas such as servers and tablet computers.[28]\n\n\nRoderick Lappin, chairman of the Lenovo–NEC joint venture, told the press that the two companies will expand their co-operation to include the development of tablet computers.[29]\n\n\nIn June 2011, Lenovo announced that it planned to acquire control of Medion, a German electronics manufacturing company. Lenovo said the acquisition would double its share of the German computer market, making it the third-largest vendor by sales (after Acer and Hewlett-Packard). The deal, which closed in the third quarter of the same year, was claimed by *The New York Times* as \"the first in which a Chinese company acquired a well-known German company.\"[30]\n\n\nThis acquisition will give Lenovo 14% of the German computer market. Gerd Brachmann, chairman of Medion, agreed to sell two-thirds of his 60 per cent stake in the company. He will be paid in cash for 80 per cent of the shares and will receive 20 per cent in Lenovo stock. That would give him about one per cent of Lenovo.[30]\n\n\nIn September 2012, Lenovo agreed to acquire the Brazil-based electronics company Digibras, which sells products under the brand-name CCE, for a base price of 300 million reales (US$148 million) in a combination of stock and cash. An additional payment of 400 million reales was made dependent upon performance benchmarks.[31][32] Prior to its acquisition of CCE, Lenovo already established a $30 million factory in Brazil, but Lenovo's management had felt that they needed a local partner to maximize regional growth. Lenovo cited their desire to take advantage of increased sales due to the 2014 World Cup that would be hosted by Brazil and the 2016 Summer Olympics and CCE's reputation for quality.[33] Following the acquisition, Lenovo announced that its subsequent acquisitions would be concentrated in software and services.[34]\n\n\n\n![](image)The signing ceremony for the LenovoEMC joint venture, with Yang Yuanqing standing in the middle (fifth from the left) in the back row\nIn September 2012, Lenovo agreed to acquire the United States-based software company Stoneware, in its first software acquisition. The transaction was expected to close by the end of 2012; no financial details have been disclosed.[35][36] Lenovo said that the company was acquired in order to gain access to new technology and that Stoneware is not expected to significantly affect earnings. More specifically, Stoneware was acquired to further Lenovo's efforts to improve and expand its cloud-computing services. For the two years prior to its acquisition, Stoneware partnered with Lenovo to sell its software. During this period Stoneware's sales doubled. Stoneware was founded in 2000. As of September 2012, Stoneware is based in Carmel, Indiana and has 67 employees.[37][38]\n\n\nLenovo re-entered the smartphone market in 2012 and quickly became the largest vendor of smartphones in mainland China.[39] Entry into the smartphone market was paired with a change of strategy from \"the one-size-fits-all\" to a diverse portfolio of devices.[40] These changes were driven by the popularity of Apple's iPhone and Lenovo's desire to increase its market share in mainland China. Lenovo surpassed Apple Inc. to become the No. 2 provider of smartphones in the domestic Chinese market in 2012.[40] However, with approximately 100 smartphone brands sold in China, this only equated to a 10.4% market share.[40]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Lenovo announced an investment of US$793 million in the construction of a mobile phone manufacturing and R&D facility in Wuhan, Hubei.[41]\n\n\nIn 2013, Lenovo created a joint venture with EMC named Iomega.[42] The venture took over Iomega's business and rebranded all of Iomega's products under the LenovoEMC brand, and designed products for small and medium-sized businesses that could not afford enterprise-class data storage.[43][44][45] Lenovo has since retired all of the LenovoEMC products on their product page advising that the products are no longer available for purchase on lenovo.com.[46]\n\n\n\n### 2014–present: Purchase of IBM server lines and other acquisitions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nCorporate logo (1984–2003)\n![](image)\nCorporate logo (2003–2015)\n![](image)\nCorporate logo (2015–present)\n\nIBM sold its x86-based server lines, including Lenovo System x and Lenovo Blade Center, to Lenovo in 2014.[47] Lenovo says it will gain access to more enterprise customers, improve its profit margins, and develop a closer relationship with Intel, the maker of most server processors, through its acquisition of IBM's x86-based server business.[48] On 1 October 2014, Lenovo closed its acquisition of IBM's server division, with the final price put at $2.1 billion.[49] Lenovo said this acquisition came in at a price lower than the previously announced $2.3 billion partially because of a change in the value of IBM inventories. The deal has been already approved by Europe, China and the United States. The United States Department of Treasury Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) was reportedly the last hurdle for Lenovo, since the United States has the strictest policies. According to Timothy Prickett-Morgan from Enterprise Tech, the deal still awaits \"approval of regulators in China, the European Commission, and Canada\".[50]\n\n\nAfter closing, Lenovo said that its goal was to become the world's largest maker of servers. Lenovo also announced plans to start integrating IBM's workforce.[51] The acquisition added about 6,500 new employees to Lenovo. Lenovo said that it has no immediate intent to cut jobs. Lenovo said that positions in research and development and customer-facing roles such as marketing would be \"100% protected\", but expected \"rationalization\" of its supply chain and procurement.[52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Motorola Moto X\nOn 29 January 2014, Google announced it would sell Motorola Mobility to Lenovo for US$2.91 billion. As of February 2014, Google owned about 5.94% of Lenovo's stock. The deal included smartphone lines like the Moto X, Moto G, Droid Turbo, and the future Motorola Mobility product roadmap, while Google retained the Advanced Technologies & Projects unit and all but 2,000 of the company's patents.[53] Lenovo received royalty free licenses to all the patents retained by Google.[54] Lenovo received approval from the European Union for its acquisition of Motorola in June 2014.[55] The acquisition was completed on 30 October 2014. Motorola Mobility remained headquartered in Chicago, and continued to use the Motorola brand, but Liu Jun, president of Lenovo's mobile device business, became the head of the company.[56][57]\n\n\nIn April 2014, Lenovo purchased a portfolio of patents from NEC related to mobile technology. These included over 3,800 patent families in countries around the world. The purchase included standards-essential patents for 3G and LTE cellular technologies and other patents related to smartphones and tablets.[58]\n\n\nIn May 2015, Lenovo revealed a new logo at Lenovo Tech World in Beijing, with the slogan \"Innovation Never Stands Still\" (Chinese: 创新无止境). Lenovo's new logo, created by Saatchi, can be changed by its advertising agencies and sales partners, within restrictions, to fit the context. It has a lounging \"e\" and is surrounded by a box that can be changed to use a relevant scene, solid color, or photograph. Lenovo's Chief Marketing Officer David Roman said, \"When we first started looking at it, it wasn't about just a change in typography or the look of the logo. We asked 'If we really are a net-driven, customer-centric company, what should the logo look like?' We came up with the idea of a digital logo first [...] designed to be used on the internet and adaptable to context.\"[59]\n\n\nIn early June 2015, Lenovo announced plans to sell up to US$650 million in five-year bonds denominated in Chinese yuan. The bonds were sold in Hong Kong with coupon ranging from 4.95% to 5.05%. This is only the second sale of bonds in Lenovo's history. Financial commentators noted that Lenovo was paying a premium to list the bonds in yuan given relatively low costs for borrowing in US dollars.[60]\n\n\nLenovo said that its x86 servers will be available to all its channel partners. Lenovo plans to cut prices on x86 products in order to gain market share.[61] This goes in alliance with IBM's vision of the future around cloud technologies and their own POWER processor architecture.[62]\n\n\nLenovo's acquisition of IBM's businesses is arguably one of the greatest case studies on merging massive international enterprises. Though this acquisition in 2005 ultimately resulted in success, the integration of the businesses had a difficult and challenging beginning. Lenovo had employees from different cultures, different backgrounds, and different languages.[63] These differences caused misunderstandings, hampering trust and the ability to build a new corporate culture. At the end of its first two years, Lenovo Group had met many of its original challenges, including integrating two disparate cultures in the newly formed company, maintaining the Think brand image for quality and innovation, and improving supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies.[64] However, Lenovo had failed to meet a key objective of the merger: leveraging the combined strength of the two companies to grow volume and market share.[64] In order to achieve success, Lenovo embraced diversification at multiple levels- business model, culture, and talent. By 2015, Lenovo grew into the world's number 1 PC maker, number 3 smartphone manufacturer and number 3 in the production of tablet computers.[65]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Lenovo announced it was partnering with Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based software storage virtualization company DataCore to add DataCore's parallel I/O-processing software to Lenovo's storage devices.[66] The servers were reportedly designed to outperform Storage Area Network (SAN) SAN arrays.[66]\n\n\nIn 2017, Lenovo formed a joint venture with Fujitsu and the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ).[67] In the joint venture, Fujitsu would sell Lenovo a 51% stake in **Fujitsu Client Computing Limited**. DBJ would acquire a 5% stake.\n\n\nIn September 2018, Lenovo and NetApp announced about strategic partnership and joint venture in China. As part of strategic partnership Lenovo started two new lines of storage systems: DM-Series and DE-Series. Both storage systems using Lenovo hardware and NetApp software: DM-Series using ONTAP OS and DE-Series SANtricity OS.\n\n\nIn 2018, Lenovo became the world's largest provider for the TOP500 supercomputers.[68]\n\n\nIn 2020, Lenovo became a preferred data center innovation provider for DreamWorks Animation starting with Trolls World Tour.\n\n\nOn 12 January 2021, Lenovo filed an application to issue Chinese depositary receipts, representing newly issued ordinary shares, and to list them on the Science and Technology Innovation Board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange.[69]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Lenovo was reorganized into three divisions: The Intelligent Devices Group for PCs, Smartphones, Smart Collaboration products, Augmented and Virtual Reality solutions and Internet of Things devices, the Infrastructure Solutions Group (formally known as Data Center Group) for smart infrastructure solutions, and the Solutions and Services Group focused on services and industry-specific products.[70] That year, the company hit $60 billion in annual revenues.[71][72]\n\n\nOn 8 October 2021, Lenovo withdrew its application to list on the Shanghai Stock Exchange just days after it had been accepted by the exchange, citing the possibility of the validity of financial information in its prospectus lapsing as the reason. The price of the company's shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped by over 17% following the news, which was its biggest intraday decline in over a decade.[73][74]\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lenovo advertisement at the Consumer Electronics Show, 2012\n\"Lenovo\" is a portmanteau of \"Le-\" (from Legend) and \"novo\", Latin ablative for \"new\". The Chinese name (simplified Chinese: 联想; traditional Chinese: 聯想; pinyin: *Liánxiǎngⓘ*) means \"association\" (as in \"association of ideas\"), \"associative thinking\", or \"connected thinking\". It also implies creativity.[75] \"Lianxiang\" was first used to refer to a layout of Chinese typewriters in the 1950s organized into groups of common words and phrases rather than the standard dictionary layout.[76]\n\n\nFor the first 20 years of its existence, the company's English name was \"Legend\". In 2002, Yang Yuanqing decided to abandon the Legend English name to expand beyond the Chinese home market. \"Legend\" was already in use worldwide by many businesses whose products and services may or may not have to do with technology,[77] making it impossible to register in many jurisdictions outside China. In April 2003, the company publicly announced its new English name, \"Lenovo\", with an advertising campaign including huge billboards and primetime television ads. Lenovo spent 18 million RMB on an eight-week television advertising campaign. The billboards showed the Lenovo logo against blue sky with a slogan that read, \"Transcendence depends on how you think.\" By the end of 2003, Lenovo had spent a total of 200 million RMB on rebranding.[10]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\nLenovo is a manufacturer of personal computers, smartphones, televisions, and wearable devices. Some of the company's earliest products included the KT8920 mainframe computer[10] and a circuit board that allowed IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters.[14] One of its first computers was the Tianxi (天禧), released in 1998 in the Chinese market. It became the best selling computer in Chinese history in 2000.[17]\n\n\n\n### Personal and business computing[edit]\n\n\nLenovo markets the ThinkPad, IdeaPad, Yoga, Legion and Xiaoxin (小新; Chinese market only) lines of laptops, as well as the IdeaCentre and ThinkCentre lines of desktops.[78] It expanded significantly in 2005 through its acquisition of IBM's personal computer business, including its ThinkPad and ThinkCentre lines. As of January 2013, shipments of THINK-branded computers have doubled since Lenovo's takeover of the brand, with profit margins thought to be above 5%.[79] Lenovo aggressively expanded the THINK brand away from traditional laptop computers in favor of tablets and hybrid devices such as the ThinkPad Tablet 2, ThinkPad Yoga, ThinkPad 8, ThinkPad Helix, and ThinkPad Twist; the shift came as a response to the growing popularity of mobile devices, and the release of Windows 8 in October 2012. Lenovo achieved significant success with this high-value strategy and in 2013 controlled more than 40% of the market for Windows computers priced above $900 in the United States.[80]\n\n\n\n#### ThinkPad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: ThinkPad\n\n![](image)A Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Series Ultrabook with extensive use of lightweight and durable carbon fibre technology[81][82]\nThe ThinkPad is a line of business-oriented laptop known for their boxy black design, modeled after a traditional Japanese *bento*.[83] The ThinkPad was originally an IBM product developed at the Yamato Facility in Japan by Arimasa Naitoh (内藤在正, *Naitō Arimasa*);[84] they have since been developed, manufactured and sold by both IBM and Lenovo after early 2005, following its acquisition of IBM's personal computer division. The ThinkPad has been used in space and was the only laptop model certified for use on the International Space Station until 2016.[85][86]\n\n\n\n#### ThinkCentre[edit]\n\n\nMain article: ThinkCentre\n\nThe ThinkCentre is a line of business-oriented desktop computers which was introduced in 2003 by IBM and since has been produced and sold by Lenovo since 2005.[87] ThinkCentre computers typically include mid-range to high-end processors, options for discrete graphics cards, and multi-monitor support. Similar to the ThinkPad line of computers, there have been budget lines of ThinkCentre branded computers in the past. Some examples of this include: M55e series, A50 series, M72 series. These \"budget\" lines are typically \"thin clients\" however, meaning they are not standalone computers, rather, they are access points to a central server.[88]\n\n\n\n#### ThinkServer, followed by ThinkSystem[edit]\n\n\nMain article: ThinkServer\n\nThe ThinkServer product line began with the TS100 from Lenovo.[89] The server was developed under an agreement with IBM, by which Lenovo would produce single-socket and dual-socket servers based on IBM's xSeries technology.[89] An additional feature of the server design was a support package aimed at small businesses.[89] The focus of this support package was to provide small businesses with software tools to ease the process of server management and reduce dependence on IT support.[90]\n\n\nOn June 20, 2017, Lenovo's Data Center Group relaunched the ThinkServer product line as ThinkSystem,[91] which consisted of 17 new machine type models, in the catalog formate containing form factors such as Tower, 1U/2U, Blades, Dense and 4U Mission Critical Intel-based servers. Also within this relaunch contained a portfolio of Storage Arrays and of Fibre Channel SAN Switches and Directors. To further incorporate industry-leading partnerships into its portfolio, Lenovo struck an agreement with the processor company, AMD, to be able to supply customers with a choice of options between both Intel and AMD powered appliances. In August, 2019, the first two ThinkSystem platforms were introduced to the market containing a single AMD EPYC processor, the SR635 (1U) and the SR655 (2U).[92] Again, in May 2020, Lenovo DCG further expanded its AMD offerings to incorporate 2-proc systems, the SR645 and the SR665,[93] continuing tio exemplify its approach to being the Most Trusted Data Center Advisor in the market.[94]\n\n\n\n#### ThinkStation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: ThinkStation\n\nLenovo ThinkStations are workstations designed for high-end computing. In 2008, IBM/Lenovo expanded the focus of its THINK brand to include workstations, with the ThinkStation S10 being the first model released.\n\n\n\n#### ThinkVision[edit]\n\n\nMain article: ThinkVision\n\nHigh-end monitors are marketed under the ThinkVision name. ThinkVision displays share a common design language with other THINK devices such as the ThinkPad line of laptop computers and ThinkCentre line of desktop computers. At the 2014 International CES, Lenovo announced the ThinkVision Pro2840m, a 28-inch 4K display aimed at professionals. Lenovo also announced another 28-inch 4K touch-enabled device running Android that can function as an all-in-one PC or an external display for other devices.[95]\n\n\nAt the 2016 International CES, Lenovo announced two displays with both USB-C and DisplayPort connectivity. The ThinkVision X24 Pro monitor is a 24-inch 1920 by 1080 pixel thin-bezel display that uses an IPS LCD panel. The ThinkVision X1 is a 27-inch 3840 by 2160 pixel thin-bezel display that uses a 10-bit panel with 99% coverage of the sRGB color gamut. The X24 includes a wireless charging base for mobile phones. The X1 is the first monitor to receive the TUV Eye-Comfort certification. Both monitors have HDMI 2.0 ports, support charging laptops, mobile phones, and other devices, and have Intel RealSense 3D cameras in order to support facial recognition. Both displays have dual-array microphones and 3-watt stereo speakers.[96]\n\n\n\n#### IdeaPad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: IdeaPad\n\n![](image)A Lenovo IdeaPad U350 at a launch event in Japan, 2009\nThe IdeaPad line of consumer-oriented laptops was introduced in January 2008. The IdeaPad is the result of Lenovo's own research and development; Unlike the ThinkPad line, its design and branding were not inherited from IBM nor are they designed/developed by IBM.\n\n\nThe IdeaPad's design language differs markedly from the ThinkPad and has a more consumer-focused look and feel.[97][98]\n\n\nOn September 21, 2016, Lenovo confirmed that their Yoga series is not meant to be compatible with Linux operating systems, that they know it is impossible to install Linux on some models, and that it is not supported.[99] This came in the wake of media coverage of problems that users were having while trying to install Ubuntu on several Yoga models, including the 900 ISK2, 900 ISK For Business, 900S, and 710, which were traced back to Lenovo disabling and removing support for the AHCI storage mode for the device's Solid State Drive in the computer's BIOS, in favor of a RAID mode that is only supported by Windows 10 drivers that come with the system.[100][101][102][103] Lenovo has since released an alternative firmware that has restored the AHCI mode to the drive controller to allow installation of Linux operating systems.[104][105]\n\n\n\n#### IdeaCentre[edit]\n\n\nMain article: IdeaCentre\n\nAll IdeaCentres are all-in-one machines, combining processor and monitor into a single unit.[106] The desktops were described by HotHardware as being \"uniquely designed\".[106] The first IdeaCentre desktop, the IdeaCentre K210, was announced by Lenovo on 30 June 2008.[107] While the IdeaCentre line consists only of desktops, it shares design elements and features with the IdeaPad line.[107] One such feature was Veriface facial recognition technology.[107]\n\n\nAt CES 2011, Lenovo announced the launch of four IdeaCentre desktops: the A320, B520, B320, and C205.[106] In the autumn of 2012, the firm introduced the more powerful IdeaCentre A720, with a 27-inch touchscreen display and running Windows 8.[108] With a TV tuner and HDMI in, the A720 can also serve as a multimedia hub or home theater PC.[109]\n\n\nIn 2013, Lenovo added a table computer to the IdeaCentre line. The Lenovo IdeaCentre Horizon, introduced at the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show is a 27-inch touchscreen computer designed to lay flat for simultaneous use by multiple people. Thanks to its use of Windows 8, the Horizon can also serve as a desktop computer when set upright.[110]\n\n\n\n#### Legion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lenovo Legion\n\nLegion is a series of laptops and tablets from Lenovo targeting gaming performance. The first Legion brand laptops was revealed at CES 2017, the Legion Y520 and the Legion Y720.[111] On June 6, 2017, a high-performance model, the Legion Y920, equipped with Intel's seventh-generation quad-core i7-7820HK and Nvidia GTX 1070 discrete graphics, was launched.[112][113]\n\n\nAt E3 2018, Lenovo announced three new laptops with new redesigned chassis, Y530, Y730 and Y7000.[114]\n\n\nIn 2020, Lenovo launched Legion 3, 5, and 7, where Legion 7 is the highest specification of the series.\n\n\nIn 2021, Lenovo launched Legion 5 pro with AMD 5th series CPU and Nvidia 30,s GPU.[115]\n\n\n\n### Smartphones[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lenovo smartphones\n\n![](image)The Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 from front and back\nAs of January 2013, Lenovo only manufactured phones that use the Android operating system from Google. Numerous press reports indicated that Lenovo planned to release a phone running Windows Phone 8, According to J. D. Howard, a vice president at Lenovo's mobile division, the company would release a Windows Phone product if there is market demand.[116]\n\n\nLenovo has implemented an aggressive strategy to replace Samsung Electronics as Mainland China market's top smartphone vendor. It has spent $793.5 million in Wuhan in order to build a plant that can produce 30 to 40 million phones per year. Data from Analysys International shows that Lenovo experienced considerable growth in smartphone sales in China during 2012. Specifically, it saw its market share increase to 14.2% during 2012's third quarter, representing an increase when compared to 4.8% in the same quarter of 2011. IDC analysts said that Lenovo's success is due to its \"aggressive ramping-up and improvements in channel partnerships\". Analysys International analyst Wang Ying wrote, \"Lenovo possesses an obvious advantage over rivals in terms of sales channels.\" The company's CEO, Yang Yuanqing, said, \"Lenovo does not want to be the second player ... we want to be the best. Lenovo has the confidence to outperform Samsung and Apple, at least in the Chinese market.\"[117]\n\n\nAccording to IHS iSuppli, Lenovo was a top-three smartphone maker in China with a 16.5% market share in the first quarter of 2012. According to a May report released by IDC Lenovo ranks fourth in the global tablet market by volume.[118] As of November 2012, Lenovo was the second largest seller of mobile phones in China when measured by volume.[39]\n\n\nIn May 2013, Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing indicated that the company had aimed to release smartphones in the United States within the next year. Later in October, Lenovo expressed interest in acquiring the Canadian smartphone maker BlackBerry Limited. However, its attempt was reportedly blocked by the Government of Canada, citing security concerns due to the use of BlackBerry devices by prominent members of the government. An official stated that \"we have been pretty consistent that the message is Canada is open to foreign investment and investment from China in particular but not at the cost of compromising national security\".[119][120]\n\n\nIn January 2014, Lenovo announced a proposed deal to acquire Motorola Mobility to bolster its plans for the U.S. market.[121] Microsoft officially announced that Lenovo had become the hardware partner of Windows Phone platform at the Mobile World Congress 2014.[122] In January 2016, Lenovo announced at CES that the company would be producing the first Tango phone.[123]\n\n\nLenovo plus Motorola was the 3rd largest producer of smartphones by volume in the world between 2011 and 2014.[124] Since Lenovo's acquisition of Motorola Mobility, the combined global market share of Lenovo plus Motorola has fallen from 7.2% in 2014 to 3.9% in the third quarter of 2016.[125][126] A number of factors have been cited as the cause of this reduced demand, including the fact that Lenovo relied heavily on carriers to sell its phones, its phones lacked strong branding and unique features to distinguish them in the competitive Chinese market where a weak economy and saturated market is slowing demand[127][128] and the culture clash between a more hierarchical PC company and the need to be nimble to sell rapidly-evolving smartphones.[129] In response to the weak sales, Lenovo announced in August 2015 that it would lay off 3,200 employees, mostly in its Motorola smartphone business.[130]\n\n\nIn the reorganization which followed, Lenovo was uncertain how to brand its Motorola smartphones. In November 2015, members of Lenovo management made statements that Lenovo would use the Motorola brand for all its smartphones.[131] Then, in January 2016, Lenovo announced that it would be eliminating the Motorola brand in favor of \"Moto by Lenovo\". The company reversed course in March 2017 and announced that the Motorola brand name would be used in all regions in future products. \"In 2016, we just finished transforming ourselves,\" Motorola Chairman and President Aymar de Lencquesaing said in an interview, \"We have clarity on how we present ourselves.\"[132]\n\n\n\n### Smart televisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lenovo LeTV\n\n![](image)A Lenovo A30 TV set-top box\nIn November 2011, Lenovo said it would soon unveil a Smart TV product called LeTV, expected for release in the first quarter of 2012. \"The PC, communications and TV industries are currently undergoing a \"smart\" transformation. In the future, users will have many smart devices and will desire an integrated experience of hardware, software and cloud services.\" Liu Jun, president of Lenovo's mobile-Internet and digital-home-business division.[133] In June 2013 Lenovo announced a partnership with Sharp to produce smart televisions. In March 2014, Lenovo announced that it projected smart television sales surpassing one million units for 2014. The same month Lenovo released its flagship S9 Smart TV.[134]\n\n\n\n### Wearables[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Lenovo Smartwatch on display at the 2015 Mobile World Congress\nRumors that Lenovo was developing a wearable device were confirmed in October 2014 after the company submitted a regulatory finding to the Federal Communications Commission. The device, branded a \"Smartband\", has a battery life of seven days. It has an optical heart-rate monitor and can be used to track distance and time spent running and calories burned. It can also notify the user of incoming calls and texts.[135] It can also unlock computers without the use of a password. The Smartband went on sale in October 2014. Lenovo started offering the device for sale on its website without a formal product announcement.[136]\n\n\n\n### IoT / Smart Home[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015 Lenovo launched a strategic cooperation with IngDan (硬蛋), a subsidiary of Chinese electronics e-commerce company Cogobuy Group, to penetrate into the intelligent hardware sector.[137]  Lenovo wanted to procure High-Tech hardware in the then newly emerging Internet of Things (IoT) economy[138] and formed a strategic partnership with Cogobuy in which it previously primarily bought IC components from.[139] Cogobuy's supply chain was utilised by Lenovo to procure consumer devices and bridge gaps in their proprietary hardware and software development.[140] At the IFA 2018, Lenovo launched several Home automation products.[141]\n\n\n\n### Lenovo Connect[edit]\n\n\nAt the Mobile World Congress in 2016, Lenovo introduced Lenovo Connect, a wireless roaming service. This service works across devices, networks, and borders for customers in China and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa). Lenovo Connect eliminates the need to buy new SIM cards when crossing borders. Lenovo Connect started service for phones and select ThinkPad laptops in China in February 2016.[142]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nLenovo's principal facilities are in Beijing, Singapore, and Morrisville, North Carolina, United States, with research centres in Beijing, Singapore, Morrisville, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu, Nanjing,[143] Wuhan[144] and Yamato (Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan).[145] Lenovo operates manufacturing facilities in Chengdu and Hefei in China, and in Japan. A 700-square-metre (7,500 sq ft) global flagship opened in Beijing in February 2013.[40]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Lenovo R&D center in Shenzhen, Guangdong\nLenovo's manufacturing operations are a departure from the usual industry practice of outsourcing to contract manufacturers. Lenovo instead focuses on vertical integration in order to avoid excessive reliance on original equipment manufacturers and to keep down costs.[146] Speaking on this topic, Yang Yuanqing said, \"Selling PCs is like selling fresh fruit. The speed of innovation is very fast, so you must know how to keep up with the pace, control inventory, to match supply with demand and handle very fast turnover.\" Lenovo benefited from its vertical integration after flooding affected hard-drive manufacturers in Thailand in 2011, as the company could continue manufacturing operations by shifting production towards products for which hard drives were still available.[147][148]\n\n\nLenovo began to emphasize vertical integration after a meeting in 2009 in which CEO Yang Yuanqing, and the head of Lenovo's supply chain, analyzed the costs versus the benefits of in-house manufacturing, and decided to make at least 50% of Lenovo's manufacturing in-house. Lenovo Chief Technology Officer George He said that vertical integration is having an important role in product development. He stated, \"If you look at the industry trends, most innovations for\" PCs, smartphones, tablets and smart TVs are related to innovation of key components—display, battery and storage. Differentiation of key parts is so important. So we started investing more ... and working very closely with key parts suppliers.\"[148] Previously, lack of integration due to numerous foreign acquisitions and an excessive number of \"key performance indicators\" (KPIs) was making Lenovo's expansion expensive and creating unacceptably slow delivery times to end-customers. Lenovo responded by reducing the number of KPIs from 150 to 5, offering intensive training to managers, and working to create a global Lenovo culture. Lenovo also doubled-down on vertical integration and manufacturing near target markets in order to cut costs at time when its competitors were making increased use of outsourcing off-shoring. By 2013, Lenovo ranked 20th on Gartner's list of top 50 supply chains, whereas in 2010 the company was unranked.[149]\n\n\nIn 2012, Lenovo partially moved production of its ThinkPad line of computers to Japan. ThinkPads will be produced by NEC in Yamagata Prefecture. Akemi Watanabe (渡辺朱美, *Watanabe Akemi*), president of Lenovo Japan, said, \"As a Japanese, I am glad to see the return to domestic production and the goal is to realize full-scale production as this will improve our image and make the products more acceptable to Japanese customers.\"[148][150]\n\n\nIn October 2012, Lenovo announced that it would start assembling computers in Whitsett, North Carolina. Production of desktop and laptop computers, including the ThinkPad Helix began in January 2013. As of July 2013[update], 115 workers were employed at this facility. Lenovo has been in Whitsett since 2008, where it also has centers for logistics, customer service, and return processing.[151][152]\n\n\nIn 2015, Lenovo and Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited, a government-sponsored business park for technology firms, reached a deal to \"jointly build a cloud service and product research and development center\".[153] Lenovo's Asia Pacific data center will also be housed in Cyperport.[153]\n\n\nLenovo assembles smartphones in Chennai, India through a contract manufacturing agreement with Flex.[154][155] In November 2015, Lenovo announced that it would start manufacturing computers in Pondicherry.[156]\n\n\n\n### Accusations of slave labor by supplier[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2020, *The Intercept* reported that Lenovo imported about 258,000 laptops from the Chinese manufacturer Hefei Bitland Information Technology, a company, among others, accused by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute of using Uyghur forced labor. In July 2020, the United States Commerce Department added 11 companies, including Hefei Bitland, implicated in human rights abuses on the Entity List. Lenovo took some shipments out of the distribution, but other shipments were distributed to consumers.[157][158][159]\n\n\nIn late July, Lenovo informed its customers it had stopped manufacturing with Bitland and was moving production of related devices to other suppliers.[160]\n\n\n\n### Response to 2022 sanctions against Russia[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lenovo reportedly suspended shipping to Russia on or before February 25, 2022, and, although it didn't confirm the suspension, faced a domestic backlash from Internet users in China.[161][162]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lenovo's registered office is in Taikoo Place, Hong Kong\nAlongside Beijing, the company has operational centres in Lorong Chuan, Singapore, and Morrisville, North Carolina[163][164] (near Raleigh in the Research Triangle metropolitan area)[165] in the United States.[166] As of October 2012, the Morrisville facility has about 2,000 employees.[167] Lenovo identifies its facilities in Beijing, Singapore, and Morrisville as its \"key location addresses\",[168] where its principal operations occur.[163] The company's registered office is on the 23rd floor of the Lincoln House building of the Taikoo Place in Quarry Bay, Hong Kong.[169]\n\n\nPreviously the company's U.S. headquarters were in Purchase, Harrison, New York. About 70 people worked there. In 2006, Lenovo announced that it was consolidating its U.S. headquarters, a logistics facility in Boulder, Colorado, and a call center in Atlanta, to a new facility in Morrisville. The company received offers of over $11 million in incentive funds from the local Morrisville, North Carolina, area and from the State of North Carolina on the condition that the company employs about 2,200 people.[170] \nIn early 2016, Lenovo carried out a comprehensive restructuring of its business units.[171]\n\n\n\n### Financials and market share[edit]\n\n\nIn the third quarter of 2020, Lenovo commands a leading market share of 25.7 per cent of all PCs sold in the world.[172]\n\n\nIn March 2013, Lenovo was included as a constituent stock in the Hang Seng Index. Lenovo replaced the unprofitable Aluminum Corporation of China Limited, a state-owned enterprise, on the list of 50 key companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange that constitute the Hang Seng Index.[173] The inclusion of Lenovo and Tencent, China's largest internet firm, significantly increased the weight of the technology sector on the index. Being added to the Hang Seng Index was a significant boon for Lenovo and its shareholders as it widened the pool of investors willing to purchase Lenovo's stock. For instance, index funds pegged to the Hang Seng and pension funds that consider index inclusion now have the opportunity to invest in Lenovo.[174] In November 2013 Lenovo reported that they had achieved double-digit market share in the United States for the first time.[175]\n\n\n\n### Ownership[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, China Oceanwide Holdings Group, a private Investment company based in Beijing, bought 29% of Legend Holdings, the parent company of Lenovo, for ¥2.76 billion.[176] As of 31 March 2018[update], 65% of Lenovo stock was held by the general public, 29% by Legend Holdings, 5.8% by Yang Yuanqing, and 0.2% by other directors.[177]\n\n\nResponding to claims that Lenovo is a state-owned enterprise, CEO Yang Yuanqing said, \"Our company is a 100% market oriented company. Some people have said we are a state-owned enterprise. It's 100% not true. In 1984 the Chinese Academy of Sciences only invested $25,000 in our company. The purpose of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to invest in this company was that they wanted to commercialize their research results. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is a pure research entity in China, owned by the government. From this point, you could say we're different from state-owned enterprises. Secondly, after this investment, this company is run totally by the founders and management team. The government has never been involved in our daily operation, in important decisions, strategic direction, nomination of the CEO and top executives and financial management. Everything is done by our management team.\"[178]\n\n\nAs of 2014, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, owns 11.7% of Lenovo and IBM owns 37.8%.[179]\n\n\nIn early 2006, the U.S. State Department was harshly criticized for purchasing 16,000 computers from Lenovo. Critics argued that Lenovo was controlled by the Chinese government and a potential vehicle for espionage against the United States. Yang spoke out forcefully and publicly to defend Lenovo. He said, \"We are not a government-controlled company.\" He pointed out that Lenovo pioneered China's transition to a market economy and that in the early 1990s had fought and beaten four state-owned enterprises that dominated the Chinese computer market. Those firms had the full backing of the state while Lenovo received no special treatment.[180] The State Department deal went through. Yang worried that fears about Lenovo's supposed connections to the Chinese government would be an ongoing issue in the United States. Yang worked to ease worries by communicating directly with Congress.\n\n\nYang dramatically increased his ownership stake by acquiring 797 million shares in 2011. As of June 2011, Yang owned an 8 per cent stake in Lenovo. He previously owned only 70 million shares. In a statement, Yang said, \"While the transaction is a personal financial matter, I want to be very clear that my decision to make this investment is based on my strong belief in the company's very bright future. Our culture is built on commitment and ownership – we do what we say, and we own what we do. My decision to increase my holdings represents my steadfast belief in these principles.\"[181]\n\n\n\n### Corporate culture[edit]\n\n\nLenovo's senior executives rotate between the three head offices at Beijing, Singapore, and Morrisville, as well as Lenovo's research and development centre in Yamato, Japan.[79]\n\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\n#### Yang Yuanqing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yang Yuanqing\n\n![](image)Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo's Chairman and CEO\nYang Yuanqing is the chairman and chief executive officer of Lenovo. One of his major achievements was leading Lenovo to become the best-selling personal computer brand in China since 1997. In 2001, *Bloomberg Businessweek* named him one of Asia's rising stars in business.[182] Yang was president and CEO of Lenovo until 2004, when Lenovo closed its acquisition of IBM's PC division, after which Yang was succeeded as Lenovo CEO by IBM's Stephen M. Ward Jr. Ward was succeeded by William Amelio on 20 December 2005. In February 2009, Yang replaced Amelio as CEO and has served in that capacity ever since. Yang was chairman of Lenovo's board from 2004 to 2008, and returned as chairman in 2012 alongside his role as CEO.\n\n\nIn 2012, Yang received a $3 million bonus as a reward for record profits, which he in turn redistributed to about 10,000 of Lenovo's employees. According to Lenovo spokesman, Jeffrey Shafer, Yang felt that it would be the right thing to, \"redirect [the money] to the employees as a real tangible gesture for what they done.\" Shafer also said that Yang, who owns about eight per cent of Lenovo's stock, \"felt that he was rewarded well simply as the owner of the company\".[183] The bonuses were mostly distributed among staff working in positions such as production and reception who received an average of CN¥2,000 or about US$314. This was almost equivalent to a monthly salary of an average worker in China.[184] Yang made a similar gift of US$3.25 million again in 2013.[185]\n\n\nAccording to Lenovo's annual report, Yang earned US$14 million, including US$5.2 million in bonuses, during the fiscal year that ended in March 2012.[186]\n\n\nIn 2013, *Barron's* named Yang one of the \"World's Best CEOs\".[187]\n\n\n\n#### Liu Chuanzhi[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Liu Chuanzhi\n\nLiu Chuanzhi is the founder and former chairman of Lenovo. Liu was trained as an engineer at a military college and later went on to work at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Like many young people during the Cultural Revolution, Liu was denounced and sent to the countryside where he worked as a laborer on a rice farm. Liu claims Hewlett-Packard as a key source of inspiration. In an interview with *The Economist* he stated that \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, Lenovo was Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.[188] In reference to Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.\"[14]\n\n\n\n#### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nIn early 2013, Lenovo announced the addition of Yahoo! founder Jerry Yang to its board.[189] Lenovo's CEO Yang Yuanqing said, \"Jerry's appointment as an observer to our board furthers Lenovo's reputation as a transparent international company.\" Just prior to the appointment of Jerry Yang, Tudor Brown, the founder of British semiconductor design firm ARM, was also appointed to Lenovo's board. Speaking of both men Yang Yuanqing said, \"We believe that they will add a great deal to our strategic thinking, long-term direction and, ultimately, our ability to achieve our aspirations in the PC plus era.\"\n\n\n\n## Marketing and sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Lenovo became the first personal computer manufacturer to divide countries into emerging markets and mature markets. Lenovo then developed a different set of strategies for each category. Lenovo's competitors have widely adopted the same approach[20] In 2012, Lenovo made a major effort to expand its market share in developing economies such as Brazil and India through acquisitions and increased budgets for marketing and advertising.[79]\n\n\n\n### Celebrity sponsorships and endorsements[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2013, Lenovo announced that it had hired American actor Ashton Kutcher as a product engineer and spokesman. David Roman, Lenovo's chief marketing officer, said, \"His partnership goes beyond traditional bounds by deeply integrating him into our organization as a product engineer. Ashton will help us break new ground by challenging assumptions, bringing a new perspective and contributing his technical expertise to Yoga Tablet and other devices.\"[190] Kobe Bryant became an official ambassador for Lenovo smartphones in China and Southeast Asia in early 2013.[191] Bryant appeared in a social campaign titled \"The Everyday Kobe Challenge\" for the launch of Lenovo IdeaPhone K900 in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines in the same year.[192][193]\n\n\n\n### Sporting sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 2008 Summer Olympics Torch was designed by Lenovo\nLenovo was an official computer sponsor of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. When asked about Lenovo's brand Yang Yuanqing said, \"The Beijing Olympics were very good for brand awareness in countries like the US and Argentina, but not good enough.\"[194] The NFL has been a Lenovo customer since 2007. In July 2012, Lenovo and the National Football League (NFL) announced that Lenovo had become the NFL's \"Official Laptop, Desktop and Workstation Sponsor.\" Lenovo said that this was its largest sponsorship deal ever in the United States. NFL stars Jerry Rice, DeAngelo Williams, and Torry Holt were on hand for the announcement and a celebration with 1,500 Lenovo employees. Lenovo's sponsorship will last at least three years.[195]\n\n\nLenovo also become technology partner for Ducati Corse in Grand Prix motorcycle racing since 2018. And for the 2021 MotoGP it will become main sponsor for the Bolognese.[196]\n\n\nLenovo is also an official partner of the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes who play in nearby Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\n\nLenovo and FC Internazionale, in 2019, have signed a multi-year sponsorship agreement that makes Lenovo the Global Technology Partner of the Nerazzurri company.[197] In May 2021, Lenovo and Motorola Mobility decided to celebrate with a limited edition of Motorola Razr totally customized and produced in 2021 numbered pieces, to honor Inter who won their 19th Scudetto.[198] In July 2021 there was the launch of the new Inter Home shirt for the 2021–22 season, they unveiled the introduction of Lenovo as a sponsor on the back of the shirt.[199]\n\n\n\n### Television, internet, and other media[edit]\n\n\nLenovo used a short-film entitled *The Pursuit* in its \"For Those Who Do\" campaign launched in 2011. The film depicted a mysterious young woman using the IdeaPad Yoga 13 to stay one-step-ahead of her evil pursuers. Martin Campbell, who previously worked on action movies and James Bond films such as GoldenEye and the remake of Casino Royale, shot this film. Lenovo was the first Chinese company to make use of such marketing techniques.[149]\n\n\nIn May 2015, Lenovo hosted its first ever \"Tech World\" conference in Beijing.[200] ZUK Mobile, a separate company formed by Lenovo in 2014, announced several products at Tech World, These included slim power banks, 3D printers that can print food such as chocolate, an outdoor sound box, and a Wi-Fi based control system for home automation.[200]\n\n\n\n### China[edit]\n\n\nIn its home market China, Lenovo has a vast distribution network designed to make sure that there is at least one shop selling Lenovo computers within 50 kilometers of nearly all consumers. Lenovo has also developed close relationships with its Chinese distributors, who are granted exclusive territories and only carry Lenovo products.[79]\n\n\nAs of July 2013, Lenovo believes that urbanization initiatives being pushed by Premier Li Keqiang will allow it to sustain sales growth in China for the foreseeable future. Speaking at Lenovo's annual general meeting in Hong Kong in 2013, Yang Yuanqing said: \"I believe urbanisation will help us further increase the overall [domestic] PC market.\" Yang also stressed the opportunity presented by the China's relatively low penetration rate of personal computers. Lenovo previously benefited from the Chinese government's rural subsidies, part of a wider economic stimulus initiative, designed to increase purchases of appliances and electronics. That program, which Lenovo joined in 2004, ended in 2011. Lenovo enjoys consistent price premiums over its traditional competitors in rural markets and a stronger local sales and service presence.[201]\n\n\n\n### India[edit]\n\n\nLenovo has gained significant market share in India through bulk orders to large companies and government agencies. For example, the government of Tamil Nadu ordered a million ThinkPads from IBM/Lenovo in 2012 and single-handedly made the firm a market leader. Lenovo distributes most of the personal computers it sells in India through five national distributors such as Ingram Micro and Redington.[202]\n\n\nGiven that most smartphones and tablets are sold to individuals Lenovo is pursuing a different strategy making use of many small state-centric distributors. Amar Babu, Lenovo's managing director for India, said, \"To reach out to small towns and the hinterland, we have tied up with 40 regional distributors. We want our distributors to be exclusive to us. We will, in turn, ensure they have exclusive rights to distribute Lenovo products in their catchment area.\"[202] As of 2013, Lenovo had about 6,000 retailers selling smartphones and tablets in India. In February 2013, Lenovo established a relationship with Reliance Communications to sell smartphones. The smartphones carried by Reliance have dual-SIM capability and support both GSM and CDMA. Babu claims that the relative under penetration of smartphones in India represents an opportunity for Lenovo.[202]\n\n\nLenovo has assembled a team of senior managers familiar with the Indian market, launched mobile phones at all price points there, and worked on branding to build market share. As of February 2014, Lenovo claims that its sales of smartphones in India have been increasing 100% per quarter while the market is only growing 15–20% over the same period. Lenovo did marketing tests of its smartphones in November 2012 in Gujarat and some southern cities, where Lenovo already had a strong presence. Lenovo's strategy has been to create awareness, maintain a broad selection of phones at all price points, and develop distribution networks. Lenovo partnered with two national distributors and over 100 local distributors. As of February 2014, more than 7,000 retail outlets in India sold Lenovo smartphones. Lenovo has also partnered with HCL in order to set up 250 service centres in 110 cities.[203]\n\n\nIn India, Lenovo grants distributors exclusive territories but allows them to sell computers from other companies. Lenovo uses its close relationships with distributors to gain market intelligence and speed up product development.\n\n\nLenovo reported a year-on-year increase of about 951% in tablet sales in India for the first quarter of 2014. Canalys, a market research firm, said Lenovo took market share away from Apple and Samsung in the country.[204]\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\nLenovo first started doing business in South Africa, establishing a sales office, and then expanded to East African markets such as Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Rwanda. West Africa followed when Lenovo set-up a Nigerian legal office and then expanded to Ghana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Botswana.\n\n\nAccording to Lenovo's general manager for Africa, Graham Braum, Lenovo's strategy is to put \"great emphasis on products that sell well in Africa\" and roll out \"products alongside different African governments' rolling out of wireless technology\". Products such as the Lenovo Yoga series are popular in Africa because of their long battery life, as many areas have unreliable electrical supply. Other popular products include the Lenovo netbooks, which were introduced in 2008.[205]\n\n\nLenovo picked Nigeria in 2013 to release its smartphone because unlike South Africa and other African countries, there is no requirement to partner with a local telecom firm to sell its phones.[206]\n\n\nIn the long term, according to Braum, \"Lenovo in Africa will focus on continuing to consistently supply personal computer products and allow this market to grow, while moving into new territory such as mobile and enterprise.\"[205]\n\n\n\n### Singapore[edit]\n\n\nLenovo has had a presence in Singapore as early as its foundation, and with a focus on the Southeast Asia region, it is the location of one of Lenovo's three head offices.[207] Registered as Lenovo[208] (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., it is located at the New Tech Park in the Lorong Chuan district of the North-East Region of Singapore.[207][209]\n\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, Lenovo began the \"For Those Who Do\" marketing campaign in 2010, created by the ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi. It was part of Lenovo's first-ever global branding campaign, beyond its domestic market in China.[210] \"For Those Who Do\" was designed to appeal to young consumers in the 18- to 25-year-old demographic by stressing its utility to creative individuals that Lenovo's advertising refers to as \"doers\".[211] One of Lenovo's operational centers is located in North Carolina, United States. Lenovo also started manufacturing products in the United States in 2012.[212]\n\n\n\n### Goodweird[edit]\n\n\nLenovo launched a multi-year advertising campaign called \"Goodweird\" in the last half of 2015. Goodweird is designed to convey the idea that designs that seem strange initially often become familiar and widely accepted. The Goodweird campaign includes a video with famous images of early attempts to fly with the aid of homemade wings and a bicycle that transitions to a modern-day shot of a man soaring across mountains in a wingsuit before transitioning again to a shot of the Stealth Bomber. Lenovo worked with three agencies on Goodweird: London-based DLKW Low, We Are Social, and Blast Radius. Goodweird is part of Lenovo's wider strategy to appeal to millennials with an emphasis on design trendsetters. A portion of the funding for Goodweird is being directed to prominent YouTubers and Viners. BuzzFeed has been engaged to create relevant content.[213]\n\n\n\n## Security and privacy incidents[edit]\n\n\n### Superfish[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2015, Lenovo became the subject of controversy for having bundled software identified as malware on some of its laptops. The software, Superfish Visual Discovery, is a web browser add-on that injects Pricing advertising into search engine results pages. To intercept HTTPS-encrypted communications, the software also installed a self-signed public key certificate.[214][215] When the Superfish public-key cryptography was compromised, it was also discovered that the same private key was used across all installations of the software, leaving users vulnerable to security exploits utilizing the key.[216][217] Lenovo made between US$200,000 to 250,000 on its deal with Superfish.[218] In 2017 Lenovo agreed to pay US$3.5 million as part of a settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission.[219] and announced an apology to its customers and stock holders.\n\n\nThe head of Superfish responded to security concerns by saying the vulnerability was \"inadvertently\" introduced by Komodia, which built the application.[220] In response to the criticism, Lenovo detailed that it would cease further distribution and use of the Superfish software, and offered affected customers free six-month subscriptions to the McAfee LiveSafe software.[221] Lenovo issued a promise to reduce the amount of \"Software bloat\" it bundles with its Windows 10 devices, promising to only include Lenovo software, security software, drivers, and \"certain applications customarily expected by users\".[222] *Salon* tech writer David Auerbach compared the Superfish incident to the Sony DRM rootkit scandal, and argued that \"installing Superfish is one of the most irresponsible mistakes an established tech company has ever made.\"[223]\n\n\n\n### Lenovo Service Engine[edit]\n\n\nFrom October 2014 through June 2015, the UEFI firmware on certain Lenovo models had contained software known as \"Lenovo Service Engine\", which Lenovo says automatically sent non-identifiable system information to Lenovo the first time Windows is connected to the internet, and on laptops, automatically installs the Lenovo OneKey Optimizer program (software considered to be Software bloat) as well. This process occurs even on clean installations of Windows. It was found that this program had been automatically installed using a new feature in Windows 8, Windows Platform Binary Table, which allows executable files to be stored within UEFI firmware for execution on startup, and is meant to \"allow critical software to persist even when the operating system has changed or been reinstalled in a \"clean\" configuration\"; specifically, anti-theft security software. The software was discontinued after it was found that aspects of the software had security vulnerabilities, and did not comply with revised guidelines for appropriate usage of WPBT. On 31 July 2015, Lenovo released instructions and UEFI firmware updates meant to remove Lenovo Service Engine.[224][225][226]\n\n\n\n### Lenovo Customer Feedback program[edit]\n\n\nAt a third time in 2015, criticism arose that Lenovo might have installed software that looked suspicious on their commercial Think-PC lines. This was discovered by Computerworld writer Michael Horowitz, who had purchased several Think systems with the Customer Feedback program installed, which seemed to log usage data and metrics.[227] Further analysis by Horowitz revealed however that this was mostly harmless, as it was only logging the usage of some pre-installed Lenovo programs, and not the usage in general, and only if the user allowed the data to be collected. Horowitz also criticized other media for quoting his original article and saying that Lenovo preinstalled spyware, as he himself never used that term in this case and he also said that he does not consider the software he found to be spyware.[228]\n\n\n\n### Lenovo Accelerator[edit]\n\n\nAs of June 2016, a Duo Labs report stated that Lenovo was still installing bloatware, some of which leads to security vulnerabilities as soon as the user turns on their new PC.[229][230] Lenovo advised users to remove the offending app, \"Lenovo Accelerator\".[231] According to Lenovo, the app, designed to \"speed up the loading\" of Lenovo applications, created a man-in-the-middle security vulnerability.\n\n\n\n### U.S. Marine network security breach[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2021, *Bloomberg Business* reported that U.S. investigators found in 2008 that military units in Iraq were using Lenovo laptops in which the hardware had been altered. According to a testimony from the case in 2010, \"A large amount of Lenovo laptops were sold to the U.S. military that had a chip encrypted on the motherboard that would record all the data that was being inputted into that laptop and send it back to China\". Lenovo was unaware of the testimony. The U.S. military did not inform the company of any security concerns. Spokeswoman Charlotte West stated, \"As there have been no reports of any problems, we have no way to assess the allegations you cite or whether security concerns may have been triggered by third-party interference.\"[232]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![icon](image)Electronics portal\n* ![icon](image)Technology portal\n\n\n* List of computer system manufacturers\n* List of companies of China\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Locations | Lenovo US\". *www.lenovo.com*.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Lenovo\". *Forbes*.

Over the years, its focus on the Southeast Asia region has led to the establishment of one of Lenovo's three head offices in Singapore. Previously known as Lenovo (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., the company operated from the New Tech Park in the Lorong Chuan district, situated in the North-East Region of Singapore.\n\nHowever, in the present, Lenovo continues to thrive and evolve in Singapore. The company remains committed to the Southeast Asia market and has expanded its operations and engagement in the region. The office, still registered as Lenovo (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., remains strategically located at the New Tech Park in the Lorong Chuan district. This location provides numerous advantages, such as access to key markets and a flourishing business environment in Singapore, which supports Lenovo's growth and success in the region.\n\nThroughout the years, Lenovo's presence in Singapore has transitioned from its early establishment to a dynamic and forward-looking operation. The company's commitment to the Southeast Asia market and its continued investment in Singapore reflect its recognition of the region's strategic importance and the opportunities it presents.\n209. **^** \"Lenovo Singapore Pte Ltd\". *www.bloomberg.com*.

Its best-known brands include its ThinkPad business line of laptop computers (acquired from IBM), the IdeaPad, Yoga, and Legion consumer lines of laptop computers, and the IdeaCentre and ThinkCentre lines of desktop computers. As of 2021, Lenovo is the world's largest personal computer vendor by unit sales.[8][9]\n\n\nLenovo has operations in over 60 countries and sells its products in around 180+ countries.[*citation needed*] It was incorporated in Hong Kong,[1] with global headquarters in Beijing, and Morrisville, North Carolina, United States.[2][3] It has research centres in Beijing, Chengdu, Yamato (Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan), Singapore, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Morrisville,[4] and also has Lenovo NEC Holdings, a joint venture with NEC that produces personal computers for the Japanese market.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1984–1993: Founding and early history[edit]\n\n\nLenovo was founded in Beijing on 1 November 1984 as **Legend** by a team of engineers led by Liu Chuanzhi and Danny Lui. Initially specializing in televisions, the company migrated towards manufacturing and marketing computers.\n\n![](image)In 1984, Lenovo was founded in Beijing by a team of 4 guards in a shack from the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), led by Liu Chuanzhi.[10]\nLiu Chuanzhi and his group of ten experienced engineers, teaming up with Danny Lui,[11] officially founded Lenovo in Beijing on November 1, 1984, with 200,000 yuan.[10][12] The Chinese government approved Lenovo's incorporation on the same day. Jia Xufu (贾续福), one of the founders of Lenovo, indicated that the first meeting in preparation for starting the company was held on October 17 the same year. Eleven people, the entirety of the initial staff, attended. Each of the founders was a member of the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The 200,000 yuan used as start-up capital was approved by Zeng Maochao (曾茂朝). The name for the company agreed upon at this meeting was the Chinese Academy of Sciences Computer Technology Research Institute New Technology Development Company.[10] Lenovo has increasingly diversified from the personal computer market and made a number of corporate acquisitions, with the most notable being acquiring and integrating most of IBM's personal computer business and its x86-based server business as well as creating its own smartphone.[13]\n\n\nThe organizational structure of the company was established in 1985 after the Chinese New Year. It included technology, engineering, administrative, and office departments.[10] The group first attempted to import televisions but failed. It rebuilt itself as a company doing quality checks on computers. It also tried and failed to market a digital watch.[14]\n\n\nIn May 1988, Lenovo placed its first recruitment advertisement on the front page of the *China Youth News*. Such ads were quite rare in China at the time. Out of the 500 respondents, 280 were selected to take a written employment exam. 120 of these candidates were interviewed in person. Although interviewers initially only had the authority to hire 16 people, 58 were given offers. The new staff included 18 people with graduate degrees, 37 with undergraduate degrees, and three students with no university-level education. Yang Yuanqing, the current chairman and CEO of Lenovo, was among that group.[10]\n\n\nLiu Chuanzhi received government permission to form a subsidiary in Hong Kong and to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in Hong Kong along with Lui, furthered his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to Hong Kong in 1988. To save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. To keep up appearances, they rented hotel rooms for meetings.[10]\n\n\nIn 1990, Lenovo started to manufacture and market computers using its own brand name.[14] Some of the company's early successes included the KT8920 mainframe computer.[10] It also developed a circuit board that allowed IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters.[14]\n\n\n\n### 1994–1998: IPO, second offerings and bond sales[edit]\n\n\nLenovo (known at the time as Legend) became publicly traded after a 1994 Hong Kong IPO that raised nearly US$30 million[15] at HK$1.33 per share.[16] Prior to the IPO, many analysts were optimistic about Lenovo. On its first day of trading, the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00 suggesting an initial under-valuing of the company. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America and Australia, to expand and improve production and research and development, and to increase working capital.[10]\n\n\nBy 1996, Lenovo was the market leader in China and began selling its own laptop.[15] By 1998 it held 43 per cent of the domestic computer market share in China, selling approximately one million computers.[15]\n\n\nLenovo released its Tianxi (天禧) computer in 1998. Designed to make it easy for inexperienced Chinese consumers to use computers and access the internet, one of its most important features was a button that instantly connected users to the internet and opened the Web browser. It was co-branded with China Telecom and it was bundled with one year of Internet service. The Tianxi was released in 1998. It was the result of two years of research and development. It had a pastel-colored, shell-shaped case and a seven-port USB hub under its screen. As of 2000, the Tianxi was the best-selling computer in Chinese history. It sold more than 1,000,000 units in 2000 alone.[17]\n\n\n\n### 1999–2010: IBM purchase and sale of smartphone division[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The ThinkPad logo, as seen on the Lenovo ThinkPad X100e laptop computer. Lenovo purchased the ThinkPad line from IBM in 2005.Further information: Acquisition of the IBM PC business by Lenovo\n\nTo fund its continued growth, Lenovo issued a secondary offering of 50 million shares on the Hong Kong market in March 2000 and raised about US$212 million.[10] It rebranded to the name Lenovo in 2003 and began making acquisitions to expand the company.[15]\n\n\nLenovo acquired IBM's personal computer business in 2005, including the ThinkPad laptop and ThinkCentre desktop lines.[18] Lenovo's acquisition of IBM's personal computer division accelerated access to foreign markets while improving Lenovo's branding and technology.[19] Lenovo paid US$1.25 billion for IBM's computer business and assumed an additional US$500 million of IBM's debt. This acquisition made Lenovo the third-largest computer maker worldwide by volume.[20]\nLenovo's purchase of the Think line from IBM also led to the creation of the IBM/Lenovo partnership, which works together in the creation of Think-line of products sold by Lenovo.\n\n\nOn the purchase of IBM's personal computer division, Chuanzhi said in 2012: \"We benefited in three ways from the IBM acquisition. We got the ThinkPad brand, IBM's more advanced PC manufacturing technology and the company's international resources, such as its global sales channels and operation teams. These three elements have shored up our sales revenue in the past several years.\"[20] The employees of the division, including those who developed ThinkPad laptops and Think Centre desktops, became employees of Lenovo.\n\n\nDespite Lenovo acquiring the \"Think\" brand from IBM, IBM still plays a key indirect, background role in the design and production of the Think line of products. Today, IBM is responsible for overseeing servicing and repair centers, and is considered an authorized distributor and refurbisher of the Think line of products produced by Lenovo.[21]\n\n\nIBM also acquired a 18.9% share of Lenovo in 2005 as part of Lenovo's purchase of IBM's personal computing division.[22] In the years following the deal, IBM sold their stake in Lenovo, with a final sale in 2011 completing their divestment.[23]\n\n\nMary Ma, Lenovo's chief financial officer from 1990 to 2007, was in charge of investor relations. Under her leadership, Lenovo successfully integrated Western-style accountability into its corporate culture. Lenovo's emphasis on transparency earned it a reputation for the best corporate governance among mainland Chinese firms. While Hong Kong-listed firms were only required to issue financial reports twice per year, Lenovo followed the international norm of issuing quarterly reports. Lenovo created an audit committee and a compensation committee with non-management directors. The company started roadshows twice per year to meet institutional investors. Ma organized the first-ever investor relations conference held in mainland China. The conference was held in Beijing in 2002 and televised on China Central Television (CCTV). Liu and Ma co-hosted the conference and both gave speeches on corporate governance.[10]\n\n\nLenovo sold its smartphone and tablet division in 2008 for US$100 million in order to focus on personal computers and then paid US$200 million to buy it back in November 2009.[24] As of 2009[update], the mobile division ranked third in terms of unit share in China's mobile handset market.[25] Lenovo invested CN¥100 million in a fund dedicated to providing seed funding for mobile application development for its LeGarden online app store. As of 2010, LeGarden had more than 1,000 programs available for the LePhone. At the same time, LeGarden counted 2,774 individual developers and 542 developer companies as members.[26]\n\n\n\n### 2011–2013: Re-entering smartphone market and other ventures[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Lenovo Vibe X smartphone at a launch event, 2014\nOn January 27, 2011, Lenovo formed a joint venture to produce personal computers with Japanese electronics firm NEC. The companies said in a statement that they would establish a new company called Lenovo NEC Holdings, to be registered in the Netherlands. NEC received US$175 million in Lenovo stock. Lenovo was to own a 51% stake in the joint venture, while NEC would have 49%. Lenovo has a five-year option to expand its stake in the joint venture.[27]\n\n\nThis joint venture was intended to boost Lenovo's worldwide sales by expanding its presence in Japan, a key market for personal computers. NEC spun off its personal computer business into the joint venture. As of 2010, NEC controlled about 20% of Japan's market for personal computers while Lenovo had a 5% share. Lenovo and NEC also agreed to explore cooperating in other areas such as servers and tablet computers.[28]\n\n\nRoderick Lappin, chairman of the Lenovo–NEC joint venture, told the press that the two companies will expand their co-operation to include the development of tablet computers.[29]\n\n\nIn June 2011, Lenovo announced that it planned to acquire control of Medion, a German electronics manufacturing company. Lenovo said the acquisition would double its share of the German computer market, making it the third-largest vendor by sales (after Acer and Hewlett-Packard). The deal, which closed in the third quarter of the same year, was claimed by *The New York Times* as \"the first in which a Chinese company acquired a well-known German company.\"[30]\n\n\nThis acquisition will give Lenovo 14% of the German computer market. Gerd Brachmann, chairman of Medion, agreed to sell two-thirds of his 60 per cent stake in the company. He will be paid in cash for 80 per cent of the shares and will receive 20 per cent in Lenovo stock. That would give him about one per cent of Lenovo.[30]\n\n\nIn September 2012, Lenovo agreed to acquire the Brazil-based electronics company Digibras, which sells products under the brand-name CCE, for a base price of 300 million reales (US$148 million) in a combination of stock and cash. An additional payment of 400 million reales was made dependent upon performance benchmarks.[31][32] Prior to its acquisition of CCE, Lenovo already established a $30 million factory in Brazil, but Lenovo's management had felt that they needed a local partner to maximize regional growth. Lenovo cited their desire to take advantage of increased sales due to the 2014 World Cup that would be hosted by Brazil and the 2016 Summer Olympics and CCE's reputation for quality.[33] Following the acquisition, Lenovo announced that its subsequent acquisitions would be concentrated in software and services.[34]\n\n\n\n![](image)The signing ceremony for the LenovoEMC joint venture, with Yang Yuanqing standing in the middle (fifth from the left) in the back row\nIn September 2012, Lenovo agreed to acquire the United States-based software company Stoneware, in its first software acquisition. The transaction was expected to close by the end of 2012; no financial details have been disclosed.[35][36] Lenovo said that the company was acquired in order to gain access to new technology and that Stoneware is not expected to significantly affect earnings. More specifically, Stoneware was acquired to further Lenovo's efforts to improve and expand its cloud-computing services. For the two years prior to its acquisition, Stoneware partnered with Lenovo to sell its software. During this period Stoneware's sales doubled. Stoneware was founded in 2000. As of September 2012, Stoneware is based in Carmel, Indiana and has 67 employees.[37][38]\n\n\nLenovo re-entered the smartphone market in 2012 and quickly became the largest vendor of smartphones in mainland China.[39] Entry into the smartphone market was paired with a change of strategy from \"the one-size-fits-all\" to a diverse portfolio of devices.[40] These changes were driven by the popularity of Apple's iPhone and Lenovo's desire to increase its market share in mainland China. Lenovo surpassed Apple Inc. to become the No. 2 provider of smartphones in the domestic Chinese market in 2012.[40] However, with approximately 100 smartphone brands sold in China, this only equated to a 10.4% market share.[40]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Lenovo announced an investment of US$793 million in the construction of a mobile phone manufacturing and R&D facility in Wuhan, Hubei.[41]\n\n\nIn 2013, Lenovo created a joint venture with EMC named Iomega.[42] The venture took over Iomega's business and rebranded all of Iomega's products under the LenovoEMC brand, and designed products for small and medium-sized businesses that could not afford enterprise-class data storage.[43][44][45] Lenovo has since retired all of the LenovoEMC products on their product page advising that the products are no longer available for purchase on lenovo.com.[46]\n\n\n\n### 2014–present: Purchase of IBM server lines and other acquisitions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nCorporate logo (1984–2003)\n![](image)\nCorporate logo (2003–2015)\n![](image)\nCorporate logo (2015–present)\n\nIBM sold its x86-based server lines, including Lenovo System x and Lenovo Blade Center, to Lenovo in 2014.[47] Lenovo says it will gain access to more enterprise customers, improve its profit margins, and develop a closer relationship with Intel, the maker of most server processors, through its acquisition of IBM's x86-based server business.[48] On 1 October 2014, Lenovo closed its acquisition of IBM's server division, with the final price put at $2.1 billion.[49] Lenovo said this acquisition came in at a price lower than the previously announced $2.3 billion partially because of a change in the value of IBM inventories. The deal has been already approved by Europe, China and the United States. The United States Department of Treasury Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) was reportedly the last hurdle for Lenovo, since the United States has the strictest policies. According to Timothy Prickett-Morgan from Enterprise Tech, the deal still awaits \"approval of regulators in China, the European Commission, and Canada\".[50]\n\n\nAfter closing, Lenovo said that its goal was to become the world's largest maker of servers. Lenovo also announced plans to start integrating IBM's workforce.[51] The acquisition added about 6,500 new employees to Lenovo. Lenovo said that it has no immediate intent to cut jobs. Lenovo said that positions in research and development and customer-facing roles such as marketing would be \"100% protected\", but expected \"rationalization\" of its supply chain and procurement.[52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Motorola Moto X\nOn 29 January 2014, Google announced it would sell Motorola Mobility to Lenovo for US$2.91 billion. As of February 2014, Google owned about 5.94% of Lenovo's stock. The deal included smartphone lines like the Moto X, Moto G, Droid Turbo, and the future Motorola Mobility product roadmap, while Google retained the Advanced Technologies & Projects unit and all but 2,000 of the company's patents.[53] Lenovo received royalty free licenses to all the patents retained by Google.[54] Lenovo received approval from the European Union for its acquisition of Motorola in June 2014.[55] The acquisition was completed on 30 October 2014. Motorola Mobility remained headquartered in Chicago, and continued to use the Motorola brand, but Liu Jun, president of Lenovo's mobile device business, became the head of the company.[56][57]\n\n\nIn April 2014, Lenovo purchased a portfolio of patents from NEC related to mobile technology. These included over 3,800 patent families in countries around the world. The purchase included standards-essential patents for 3G and LTE cellular technologies and other patents related to smartphones and tablets.[58]\n\n\nIn May 2015, Lenovo revealed a new logo at Lenovo Tech World in Beijing, with the slogan \"Innovation Never Stands Still\" (Chinese: 创新无止境). Lenovo's new logo, created by Saatchi, can be changed by its advertising agencies and sales partners, within restrictions, to fit the context. It has a lounging \"e\" and is surrounded by a box that can be changed to use a relevant scene, solid color, or photograph. Lenovo's Chief Marketing Officer David Roman said, \"When we first started looking at it, it wasn't about just a change in typography or the look of the logo. We asked 'If we really are a net-driven, customer-centric company, what should the logo look like?' We came up with the idea of a digital logo first [...] designed to be used on the internet and adaptable to context.\"[59]\n\n\nIn early June 2015, Lenovo announced plans to sell up to US$650 million in five-year bonds denominated in Chinese yuan. The bonds were sold in Hong Kong with coupon ranging from 4.95% to 5.05%. This is only the second sale of bonds in Lenovo's history. Financial commentators noted that Lenovo was paying a premium to list the bonds in yuan given relatively low costs for borrowing in US dollars.[60]\n\n\nLenovo said that its x86 servers will be available to all its channel partners. Lenovo plans to cut prices on x86 products in order to gain market share.[61] This goes in alliance with IBM's vision of the future around cloud technologies and their own POWER processor architecture.[62]\n\n\nLenovo's acquisition of IBM's businesses is arguably one of the greatest case studies on merging massive international enterprises. Though this acquisition in 2005 ultimately resulted in success, the integration of the businesses had a difficult and challenging beginning. Lenovo had employees from different cultures, different backgrounds, and different languages.[63] These differences caused misunderstandings, hampering trust and the ability to build a new corporate culture. At the end of its first two years, Lenovo Group had met many of its original challenges, including integrating two disparate cultures in the newly formed company, maintaining the Think brand image for quality and innovation, and improving supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies.[64] However, Lenovo had failed to meet a key objective of the merger: leveraging the combined strength of the two companies to grow volume and market share.[64] In order to achieve success, Lenovo embraced diversification at multiple levels- business model, culture, and talent. By 2015, Lenovo grew into the world's number 1 PC maker, number 3 smartphone manufacturer and number 3 in the production of tablet computers.[65]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Lenovo announced it was partnering with Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based software storage virtualization company DataCore to add DataCore's parallel I/O-processing software to Lenovo's storage devices.[66] The servers were reportedly designed to outperform Storage Area Network (SAN) SAN arrays.[66]\n\n\nIn 2017, Lenovo formed a joint venture with Fujitsu and the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ).[67] In the joint venture, Fujitsu would sell Lenovo a 51% stake in **Fujitsu Client Computing Limited**. DBJ would acquire a 5% stake.\n\n\nIn September 2018, Lenovo and NetApp announced about strategic partnership and joint venture in China. As part of strategic partnership Lenovo started two new lines of storage systems: DM-Series and DE-Series. Both storage systems using Lenovo hardware and NetApp software: DM-Series using ONTAP OS and DE-Series SANtricity OS.\n\n\nIn 2018, Lenovo became the world's largest provider for the TOP500 supercomputers.[68]\n\n\nIn 2020, Lenovo became a preferred data center innovation provider for DreamWorks Animation starting with Trolls World Tour.\n\n\nOn 12 January 2021, Lenovo filed an application to issue Chinese depositary receipts, representing newly issued ordinary shares, and to list them on the Science and Technology Innovation Board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange.[69]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Lenovo was reorganized into three divisions: The Intelligent Devices Group for PCs, Smartphones, Smart Collaboration products, Augmented and Virtual Reality solutions and Internet of Things devices, the Infrastructure Solutions Group (formally known as Data Center Group) for smart infrastructure solutions, and the Solutions and Services Group focused on services and industry-specific products.[70] That year, the company hit $60 billion in annual revenues.[71][72]\n\n\nOn 8 October 2021, Lenovo withdrew its application to list on the Shanghai Stock Exchange just days after it had been accepted by the exchange, citing the possibility of the validity of financial information in its prospectus lapsing as the reason. The price of the company's shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped by over 17% following the news, which was its biggest intraday decline in over a decade.[73][74]\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lenovo advertisement at the Consumer Electronics Show, 2012\n\"Lenovo\" is a portmanteau of \"Le-\" (from Legend) and \"novo\", Latin ablative for \"new\". The Chinese name (simplified Chinese: 联想; traditional Chinese: 聯想; pinyin: *Liánxiǎngⓘ*) means \"association\" (as in \"association of ideas\"), \"associative thinking\", or \"connected thinking\". It also implies creativity.[75] \"Lianxiang\" was first used to refer to a layout of Chinese typewriters in the 1950s organized into groups of common words and phrases rather than the standard dictionary layout.[76]\n\n\nFor the first 20 years of its existence, the company's English name was \"Legend\". In 2002, Yang Yuanqing decided to abandon the Legend English name to expand beyond the Chinese home market. \"Legend\" was already in use worldwide by many businesses whose products and services may or may not have to do with technology,[77] making it impossible to register in many jurisdictions outside China. In April 2003, the company publicly announced its new English name, \"Lenovo\", with an advertising campaign including huge billboards and primetime television ads. Lenovo spent 18 million RMB on an eight-week television advertising campaign. The billboards showed the Lenovo logo against blue sky with a slogan that read, \"Transcendence depends on how you think.\" By the end of 2003, Lenovo had spent a total of 200 million RMB on rebranding.[10]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\nLenovo is a manufacturer of personal computers, smartphones, televisions, and wearable devices. Some of the company's earliest products included the KT8920 mainframe computer[10] and a circuit board that allowed IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters.[14] One of its first computers was the Tianxi (天禧), released in 1998 in the Chinese market. It became the best selling computer in Chinese history in 2000.[17]\n\n\n\n### Personal and business computing[edit]\n\n\nLenovo markets the ThinkPad, IdeaPad, Yoga, Legion and Xiaoxin (小新; Chinese market only) lines of laptops, as well as the IdeaCentre and ThinkCentre lines of desktops.[78] It expanded significantly in 2005 through its acquisition of IBM's personal computer business, including its ThinkPad and ThinkCentre lines. As of January 2013, shipments of THINK-branded computers have doubled since Lenovo's takeover of the brand, with profit margins thought to be above 5%.[79] Lenovo aggressively expanded the THINK brand away from traditional laptop computers in favor of tablets and hybrid devices such as the ThinkPad Tablet 2, ThinkPad Yoga, ThinkPad 8, ThinkPad Helix, and ThinkPad Twist; the shift came as a response to the growing popularity of mobile devices, and the release of Windows 8 in October 2012. Lenovo achieved significant success with this high-value strategy and in 2013 controlled more than 40% of the market for Windows computers priced above $900 in the United States.[80]\n\n\n\n#### ThinkPad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: ThinkPad\n\n![](image)A Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Series Ultrabook with extensive use of lightweight and durable carbon fibre technology[81][82]\nThe ThinkPad is a line of business-oriented laptop known for their boxy black design, modeled after a traditional Japanese *bento*.[83] The ThinkPad was originally an IBM product developed at the Yamato Facility in Japan by Arimasa Naitoh (内藤在正, *Naitō Arimasa*);[84] they have since been developed, manufactured and sold by both IBM and Lenovo after early 2005, following its acquisition of IBM's personal computer division. The ThinkPad has been used in space and was the only laptop model certified for use on the International Space Station until 2016.[85][86]\n\n\n\n#### ThinkCentre[edit]\n\n\nMain article: ThinkCentre\n\nThe ThinkCentre is a line of business-oriented desktop computers which was introduced in 2003 by IBM and since has been produced and sold by Lenovo since 2005.[87] ThinkCentre computers typically include mid-range to high-end processors, options for discrete graphics cards, and multi-monitor support. Similar to the ThinkPad line of computers, there have been budget lines of ThinkCentre branded computers in the past. Some examples of this include: M55e series, A50 series, M72 series. These \"budget\" lines are typically \"thin clients\" however, meaning they are not standalone computers, rather, they are access points to a central server.[88]\n\n\n\n#### ThinkServer, followed by ThinkSystem[edit]\n\n\nMain article: ThinkServer\n\nThe ThinkServer product line began with the TS100 from Lenovo.[89] The server was developed under an agreement with IBM, by which Lenovo would produce single-socket and dual-socket servers based on IBM's xSeries technology.[89] An additional feature of the server design was a support package aimed at small businesses.[89] The focus of this support package was to provide small businesses with software tools to ease the process of server management and reduce dependence on IT support.[90]\n\n\nOn June 20, 2017, Lenovo's Data Center Group relaunched the ThinkServer product line as ThinkSystem,[91] which consisted of 17 new machine type models, in the catalog formate containing form factors such as Tower, 1U/2U, Blades, Dense and 4U Mission Critical Intel-based servers. Also within this relaunch contained a portfolio of Storage Arrays and of Fibre Channel SAN Switches and Directors. To further incorporate industry-leading partnerships into its portfolio, Lenovo struck an agreement with the processor company, AMD, to be able to supply customers with a choice of options between both Intel and AMD powered appliances. In August, 2019, the first two ThinkSystem platforms were introduced to the market containing a single AMD EPYC processor, the SR635 (1U) and the SR655 (2U).[92] Again, in May 2020, Lenovo DCG further expanded its AMD offerings to incorporate 2-proc systems, the SR645 and the SR665,[93] continuing tio exemplify its approach to being the Most Trusted Data Center Advisor in the market.[94]\n\n\n\n#### ThinkStation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: ThinkStation\n\nLenovo ThinkStations are workstations designed for high-end computing. In 2008, IBM/Lenovo expanded the focus of its THINK brand to include workstations, with the ThinkStation S10 being the first model released.\n\n\n\n#### ThinkVision[edit]\n\n\nMain article: ThinkVision\n\nHigh-end monitors are marketed under the ThinkVision name. ThinkVision displays share a common design language with other THINK devices such as the ThinkPad line of laptop computers and ThinkCentre line of desktop computers. At the 2014 International CES, Lenovo announced the ThinkVision Pro2840m, a 28-inch 4K display aimed at professionals. Lenovo also announced another 28-inch 4K touch-enabled device running Android that can function as an all-in-one PC or an external display for other devices.[95]\n\n\nAt the 2016 International CES, Lenovo announced two displays with both USB-C and DisplayPort connectivity. The ThinkVision X24 Pro monitor is a 24-inch 1920 by 1080 pixel thin-bezel display that uses an IPS LCD panel. The ThinkVision X1 is a 27-inch 3840 by 2160 pixel thin-bezel display that uses a 10-bit panel with 99% coverage of the sRGB color gamut. The X24 includes a wireless charging base for mobile phones. The X1 is the first monitor to receive the TUV Eye-Comfort certification. Both monitors have HDMI 2.0 ports, support charging laptops, mobile phones, and other devices, and have Intel RealSense 3D cameras in order to support facial recognition. Both displays have dual-array microphones and 3-watt stereo speakers.[96]\n\n\n\n#### IdeaPad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: IdeaPad\n\n![](image)A Lenovo IdeaPad U350 at a launch event in Japan, 2009\nThe IdeaPad line of consumer-oriented laptops was introduced in January 2008. The IdeaPad is the result of Lenovo's own research and development; Unlike the ThinkPad line, its design and branding were not inherited from IBM nor are they designed/developed by IBM.\n\n\nThe IdeaPad's design language differs markedly from the ThinkPad and has a more consumer-focused look and feel.[97][98]\n\n\nOn September 21, 2016, Lenovo confirmed that their Yoga series is not meant to be compatible with Linux operating systems, that they know it is impossible to install Linux on some models, and that it is not supported.[99] This came in the wake of media coverage of problems that users were having while trying to install Ubuntu on several Yoga models, including the 900 ISK2, 900 ISK For Business, 900S, and 710, which were traced back to Lenovo disabling and removing support for the AHCI storage mode for the device's Solid State Drive in the computer's BIOS, in favor of a RAID mode that is only supported by Windows 10 drivers that come with the system.[100][101][102][103] Lenovo has since released an alternative firmware that has restored the AHCI mode to the drive controller to allow installation of Linux operating systems.[104][105]\n\n\n\n#### IdeaCentre[edit]\n\n\nMain article: IdeaCentre\n\nAll IdeaCentres are all-in-one machines, combining processor and monitor into a single unit.[106] The desktops were described by HotHardware as being \"uniquely designed\".[106] The first IdeaCentre desktop, the IdeaCentre K210, was announced by Lenovo on 30 June 2008.[107] While the IdeaCentre line consists only of desktops, it shares design elements and features with the IdeaPad line.[107] One such feature was Veriface facial recognition technology.[107]\n\n\nAt CES 2011, Lenovo announced the launch of four IdeaCentre desktops: the A320, B520, B320, and C205.[106] In the autumn of 2012, the firm introduced the more powerful IdeaCentre A720, with a 27-inch touchscreen display and running Windows 8.[108] With a TV tuner and HDMI in, the A720 can also serve as a multimedia hub or home theater PC.[109]\n\n\nIn 2013, Lenovo added a table computer to the IdeaCentre line. The Lenovo IdeaCentre Horizon, introduced at the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show is a 27-inch touchscreen computer designed to lay flat for simultaneous use by multiple people. Thanks to its use of Windows 8, the Horizon can also serve as a desktop computer when set upright.[110]\n\n\n\n#### Legion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lenovo Legion\n\nLegion is a series of laptops and tablets from Lenovo targeting gaming performance. The first Legion brand laptops was revealed at CES 2017, the Legion Y520 and the Legion Y720.[111] On June 6, 2017, a high-performance model, the Legion Y920, equipped with Intel's seventh-generation quad-core i7-7820HK and Nvidia GTX 1070 discrete graphics, was launched.[112][113]\n\n\nAt E3 2018, Lenovo announced three new laptops with new redesigned chassis, Y530, Y730 and Y7000.[114]\n\n\nIn 2020, Lenovo launched Legion 3, 5, and 7, where Legion 7 is the highest specification of the series.\n\n\nIn 2021, Lenovo launched Legion 5 pro with AMD 5th series CPU and Nvidia 30,s GPU.[115]\n\n\n\n### Smartphones[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lenovo smartphones\n\n![](image)The Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 from front and back\nAs of January 2013, Lenovo only manufactured phones that use the Android operating system from Google. Numerous press reports indicated that Lenovo planned to release a phone running Windows Phone 8, According to J. D. Howard, a vice president at Lenovo's mobile division, the company would release a Windows Phone product if there is market demand.[116]\n\n\nLenovo has implemented an aggressive strategy to replace Samsung Electronics as Mainland China market's top smartphone vendor. It has spent $793.5 million in Wuhan in order to build a plant that can produce 30 to 40 million phones per year. Data from Analysys International shows that Lenovo experienced considerable growth in smartphone sales in China during 2012. Specifically, it saw its market share increase to 14.2% during 2012's third quarter, representing an increase when compared to 4.8% in the same quarter of 2011. IDC analysts said that Lenovo's success is due to its \"aggressive ramping-up and improvements in channel partnerships\". Analysys International analyst Wang Ying wrote, \"Lenovo possesses an obvious advantage over rivals in terms of sales channels.\" The company's CEO, Yang Yuanqing, said, \"Lenovo does not want to be the second player ... we want to be the best. Lenovo has the confidence to outperform Samsung and Apple, at least in the Chinese market.\"[117]\n\n\nAccording to IHS iSuppli, Lenovo was a top-three smartphone maker in China with a 16.5% market share in the first quarter of 2012. According to a May report released by IDC Lenovo ranks fourth in the global tablet market by volume.[118] As of November 2012, Lenovo was the second largest seller of mobile phones in China when measured by volume.[39]\n\n\nIn May 2013, Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing indicated that the company had aimed to release smartphones in the United States within the next year. Later in October, Lenovo expressed interest in acquiring the Canadian smartphone maker BlackBerry Limited. However, its attempt was reportedly blocked by the Government of Canada, citing security concerns due to the use of BlackBerry devices by prominent members of the government. An official stated that \"we have been pretty consistent that the message is Canada is open to foreign investment and investment from China in particular but not at the cost of compromising national security\".[119][120]\n\n\nIn January 2014, Lenovo announced a proposed deal to acquire Motorola Mobility to bolster its plans for the U.S. market.[121] Microsoft officially announced that Lenovo had become the hardware partner of Windows Phone platform at the Mobile World Congress 2014.[122] In January 2016, Lenovo announced at CES that the company would be producing the first Tango phone.[123]\n\n\nLenovo plus Motorola was the 3rd largest producer of smartphones by volume in the world between 2011 and 2014.[124] Since Lenovo's acquisition of Motorola Mobility, the combined global market share of Lenovo plus Motorola has fallen from 7.2% in 2014 to 3.9% in the third quarter of 2016.[125][126] A number of factors have been cited as the cause of this reduced demand, including the fact that Lenovo relied heavily on carriers to sell its phones, its phones lacked strong branding and unique features to distinguish them in the competitive Chinese market where a weak economy and saturated market is slowing demand[127][128] and the culture clash between a more hierarchical PC company and the need to be nimble to sell rapidly-evolving smartphones.[129] In response to the weak sales, Lenovo announced in August 2015 that it would lay off 3,200 employees, mostly in its Motorola smartphone business.[130]\n\n\nIn the reorganization which followed, Lenovo was uncertain how to brand its Motorola smartphones. In November 2015, members of Lenovo management made statements that Lenovo would use the Motorola brand for all its smartphones.[131] Then, in January 2016, Lenovo announced that it would be eliminating the Motorola brand in favor of \"Moto by Lenovo\". The company reversed course in March 2017 and announced that the Motorola brand name would be used in all regions in future products. \"In 2016, we just finished transforming ourselves,\" Motorola Chairman and President Aymar de Lencquesaing said in an interview, \"We have clarity on how we present ourselves.\"[132]\n\n\n\n### Smart televisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lenovo LeTV\n\n![](image)A Lenovo A30 TV set-top box\nIn November 2011, Lenovo said it would soon unveil a Smart TV product called LeTV, expected for release in the first quarter of 2012. \"The PC, communications and TV industries are currently undergoing a \"smart\" transformation. In the future, users will have many smart devices and will desire an integrated experience of hardware, software and cloud services.\" Liu Jun, president of Lenovo's mobile-Internet and digital-home-business division.[133] In June 2013 Lenovo announced a partnership with Sharp to produce smart televisions. In March 2014, Lenovo announced that it projected smart television sales surpassing one million units for 2014. The same month Lenovo released its flagship S9 Smart TV.[134]\n\n\n\n### Wearables[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Lenovo Smartwatch on display at the 2015 Mobile World Congress\nRumors that Lenovo was developing a wearable device were confirmed in October 2014 after the company submitted a regulatory finding to the Federal Communications Commission. The device, branded a \"Smartband\", has a battery life of seven days. It has an optical heart-rate monitor and can be used to track distance and time spent running and calories burned. It can also notify the user of incoming calls and texts.[135] It can also unlock computers without the use of a password. The Smartband went on sale in October 2014. Lenovo started offering the device for sale on its website without a formal product announcement.[136]\n\n\n\n### IoT / Smart Home[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015 Lenovo launched a strategic cooperation with IngDan (硬蛋), a subsidiary of Chinese electronics e-commerce company Cogobuy Group, to penetrate into the intelligent hardware sector.[137]  Lenovo wanted to procure High-Tech hardware in the then newly emerging Internet of Things (IoT) economy[138] and formed a strategic partnership with Cogobuy in which it previously primarily bought IC components from.[139] Cogobuy's supply chain was utilised by Lenovo to procure consumer devices and bridge gaps in their proprietary hardware and software development.[140] At the IFA 2018, Lenovo launched several Home automation products.[141]\n\n\n\n### Lenovo Connect[edit]\n\n\nAt the Mobile World Congress in 2016, Lenovo introduced Lenovo Connect, a wireless roaming service. This service works across devices, networks, and borders for customers in China and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa). Lenovo Connect eliminates the need to buy new SIM cards when crossing borders. Lenovo Connect started service for phones and select ThinkPad laptops in China in February 2016.[142]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nLenovo's principal facilities are in Beijing, Singapore, and Morrisville, North Carolina, United States, with research centres in Beijing, Singapore, Morrisville, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu, Nanjing,[143] Wuhan[144] and Yamato (Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan).[145] Lenovo operates manufacturing facilities in Chengdu and Hefei in China, and in Japan. A 700-square-metre (7,500 sq ft) global flagship opened in Beijing in February 2013.[40]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Lenovo R&D center in Shenzhen, Guangdong\nLenovo's manufacturing operations are a departure from the usual industry practice of outsourcing to contract manufacturers. Lenovo instead focuses on vertical integration in order to avoid excessive reliance on original equipment manufacturers and to keep down costs.[146] Speaking on this topic, Yang Yuanqing said, \"Selling PCs is like selling fresh fruit. The speed of innovation is very fast, so you must know how to keep up with the pace, control inventory, to match supply with demand and handle very fast turnover.\" Lenovo benefited from its vertical integration after flooding affected hard-drive manufacturers in Thailand in 2011, as the company could continue manufacturing operations by shifting production towards products for which hard drives were still available.[147][148]\n\n\nLenovo began to emphasize vertical integration after a meeting in 2009 in which CEO Yang Yuanqing, and the head of Lenovo's supply chain, analyzed the costs versus the benefits of in-house manufacturing, and decided to make at least 50% of Lenovo's manufacturing in-house. Lenovo Chief Technology Officer George He said that vertical integration is having an important role in product development. He stated, \"If you look at the industry trends, most innovations for\" PCs, smartphones, tablets and smart TVs are related to innovation of key components—display, battery and storage. Differentiation of key parts is so important. So we started investing more ... and working very closely with key parts suppliers.\"[148] Previously, lack of integration due to numerous foreign acquisitions and an excessive number of \"key performance indicators\" (KPIs) was making Lenovo's expansion expensive and creating unacceptably slow delivery times to end-customers. Lenovo responded by reducing the number of KPIs from 150 to 5, offering intensive training to managers, and working to create a global Lenovo culture. Lenovo also doubled-down on vertical integration and manufacturing near target markets in order to cut costs at time when its competitors were making increased use of outsourcing off-shoring. By 2013, Lenovo ranked 20th on Gartner's list of top 50 supply chains, whereas in 2010 the company was unranked.[149]\n\n\nIn 2012, Lenovo partially moved production of its ThinkPad line of computers to Japan. ThinkPads will be produced by NEC in Yamagata Prefecture. Akemi Watanabe (渡辺朱美, *Watanabe Akemi*), president of Lenovo Japan, said, \"As a Japanese, I am glad to see the return to domestic production and the goal is to realize full-scale production as this will improve our image and make the products more acceptable to Japanese customers.\"[148][150]\n\n\nIn October 2012, Lenovo announced that it would start assembling computers in Whitsett, North Carolina. Production of desktop and laptop computers, including the ThinkPad Helix began in January 2013. As of July 2013[update], 115 workers were employed at this facility. Lenovo has been in Whitsett since 2008, where it also has centers for logistics, customer service, and return processing.[151][152]\n\n\nIn 2015, Lenovo and Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited, a government-sponsored business park for technology firms, reached a deal to \"jointly build a cloud service and product research and development center\".[153] Lenovo's Asia Pacific data center will also be housed in Cyperport.[153]\n\n\nLenovo assembles smartphones in Chennai, India through a contract manufacturing agreement with Flex.[154][155] In November 2015, Lenovo announced that it would start manufacturing computers in Pondicherry.[156]\n\n\n\n### Accusations of slave labor by supplier[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2020, *The Intercept* reported that Lenovo imported about 258,000 laptops from the Chinese manufacturer Hefei Bitland Information Technology, a company, among others, accused by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute of using Uyghur forced labor. In July 2020, the United States Commerce Department added 11 companies, including Hefei Bitland, implicated in human rights abuses on the Entity List. Lenovo took some shipments out of the distribution, but other shipments were distributed to consumers.[157][158][159]\n\n\nIn late July, Lenovo informed its customers it had stopped manufacturing with Bitland and was moving production of related devices to other suppliers.[160]\n\n\n\n### Response to 2022 sanctions against Russia[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lenovo reportedly suspended shipping to Russia on or before February 25, 2022, and, although it didn't confirm the suspension, faced a domestic backlash from Internet users in China.[161][162]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lenovo's registered office is in Taikoo Place, Hong Kong\nAlongside Beijing, the company has operational centres in Lorong Chuan, Singapore, and Morrisville, North Carolina[163][164] (near Raleigh in the Research Triangle metropolitan area)[165] in the United States.[166] As of October 2012, the Morrisville facility has about 2,000 employees.[167] Lenovo identifies its facilities in Beijing, Singapore, and Morrisville as its \"key location addresses\",[168] where its principal operations occur.[163] The company's registered office is on the 23rd floor of the Lincoln House building of the Taikoo Place in Quarry Bay, Hong Kong.[169]\n\n\nPreviously the company's U.S. headquarters were in Purchase, Harrison, New York. About 70 people worked there. In 2006, Lenovo announced that it was consolidating its U.S. headquarters, a logistics facility in Boulder, Colorado, and a call center in Atlanta, to a new facility in Morrisville. The company received offers of over $11 million in incentive funds from the local Morrisville, North Carolina, area and from the State of North Carolina on the condition that the company employs about 2,200 people.[170] \nIn early 2016, Lenovo carried out a comprehensive restructuring of its business units.[171]\n\n\n\n### Financials and market share[edit]\n\n\nIn the third quarter of 2020, Lenovo commands a leading market share of 25.7 per cent of all PCs sold in the world.[172]\n\n\nIn March 2013, Lenovo was included as a constituent stock in the Hang Seng Index. Lenovo replaced the unprofitable Aluminum Corporation of China Limited, a state-owned enterprise, on the list of 50 key companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange that constitute the Hang Seng Index.[173] The inclusion of Lenovo and Tencent, China's largest internet firm, significantly increased the weight of the technology sector on the index. Being added to the Hang Seng Index was a significant boon for Lenovo and its shareholders as it widened the pool of investors willing to purchase Lenovo's stock. For instance, index funds pegged to the Hang Seng and pension funds that consider index inclusion now have the opportunity to invest in Lenovo.[174] In November 2013 Lenovo reported that they had achieved double-digit market share in the United States for the first time.[175]\n\n\n\n### Ownership[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, China Oceanwide Holdings Group, a private Investment company based in Beijing, bought 29% of Legend Holdings, the parent company of Lenovo, for ¥2.76 billion.[176] As of 31 March 2018[update], 65% of Lenovo stock was held by the general public, 29% by Legend Holdings, 5.8% by Yang Yuanqing, and 0.2% by other directors.[177]\n\n\nResponding to claims that Lenovo is a state-owned enterprise, CEO Yang Yuanqing said, \"Our company is a 100% market oriented company. Some people have said we are a state-owned enterprise. It's 100% not true. In 1984 the Chinese Academy of Sciences only invested $25,000 in our company. The purpose of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to invest in this company was that they wanted to commercialize their research results. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is a pure research entity in China, owned by the government. From this point, you could say we're different from state-owned enterprises. Secondly, after this investment, this company is run totally by the founders and management team. The government has never been involved in our daily operation, in important decisions, strategic direction, nomination of the CEO and top executives and financial management. Everything is done by our management team.\"[178]\n\n\nAs of 2014, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, owns 11.7% of Lenovo and IBM owns 37.8%.[179]\n\n\nIn early 2006, the U.S. State Department was harshly criticized for purchasing 16,000 computers from Lenovo. Critics argued that Lenovo was controlled by the Chinese government and a potential vehicle for espionage against the United States. Yang spoke out forcefully and publicly to defend Lenovo. He said, \"We are not a government-controlled company.\" He pointed out that Lenovo pioneered China's transition to a market economy and that in the early 1990s had fought and beaten four state-owned enterprises that dominated the Chinese computer market. Those firms had the full backing of the state while Lenovo received no special treatment.[180] The State Department deal went through. Yang worried that fears about Lenovo's supposed connections to the Chinese government would be an ongoing issue in the United States. Yang worked to ease worries by communicating directly with Congress.\n\n\nYang dramatically increased his ownership stake by acquiring 797 million shares in 2011. As of June 2011, Yang owned an 8 per cent stake in Lenovo. He previously owned only 70 million shares. In a statement, Yang said, \"While the transaction is a personal financial matter, I want to be very clear that my decision to make this investment is based on my strong belief in the company's very bright future. Our culture is built on commitment and ownership – we do what we say, and we own what we do. My decision to increase my holdings represents my steadfast belief in these principles.\"[181]\n\n\n\n### Corporate culture[edit]\n\n\nLenovo's senior executives rotate between the three head offices at Beijing, Singapore, and Morrisville, as well as Lenovo's research and development centre in Yamato, Japan.[79]\n\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\n#### Yang Yuanqing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yang Yuanqing\n\n![](image)Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo's Chairman and CEO\nYang Yuanqing is the chairman and chief executive officer of Lenovo. One of his major achievements was leading Lenovo to become the best-selling personal computer brand in China since 1997. In 2001, *Bloomberg Businessweek* named him one of Asia's rising stars in business.[182] Yang was president and CEO of Lenovo until 2004, when Lenovo closed its acquisition of IBM's PC division, after which Yang was succeeded as Lenovo CEO by IBM's Stephen M. Ward Jr. Ward was succeeded by William Amelio on 20 December 2005. In February 2009, Yang replaced Amelio as CEO and has served in that capacity ever since. Yang was chairman of Lenovo's board from 2004 to 2008, and returned as chairman in 2012 alongside his role as CEO.\n\n\nIn 2012, Yang received a $3 million bonus as a reward for record profits, which he in turn redistributed to about 10,000 of Lenovo's employees. According to Lenovo spokesman, Jeffrey Shafer, Yang felt that it would be the right thing to, \"redirect [the money] to the employees as a real tangible gesture for what they done.\" Shafer also said that Yang, who owns about eight per cent of Lenovo's stock, \"felt that he was rewarded well simply as the owner of the company\".[183] The bonuses were mostly distributed among staff working in positions such as production and reception who received an average of CN¥2,000 or about US$314. This was almost equivalent to a monthly salary of an average worker in China.[184] Yang made a similar gift of US$3.25 million again in 2013.[185]\n\n\nAccording to Lenovo's annual report, Yang earned US$14 million, including US$5.2 million in bonuses, during the fiscal year that ended in March 2012.[186]\n\n\nIn 2013, *Barron's* named Yang one of the \"World's Best CEOs\".[187]\n\n\n\n#### Liu Chuanzhi[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Liu Chuanzhi\n\nLiu Chuanzhi is the founder and former chairman of Lenovo. Liu was trained as an engineer at a military college and later went on to work at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Like many young people during the Cultural Revolution, Liu was denounced and sent to the countryside where he worked as a laborer on a rice farm. Liu claims Hewlett-Packard as a key source of inspiration. In an interview with *The Economist* he stated that \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, Lenovo was Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.[188] In reference to Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.\"[14]\n\n\n\n#### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nIn early 2013, Lenovo announced the addition of Yahoo! founder Jerry Yang to its board.[189] Lenovo's CEO Yang Yuanqing said, \"Jerry's appointment as an observer to our board furthers Lenovo's reputation as a transparent international company.\" Just prior to the appointment of Jerry Yang, Tudor Brown, the founder of British semiconductor design firm ARM, was also appointed to Lenovo's board. Speaking of both men Yang Yuanqing said, \"We believe that they will add a great deal to our strategic thinking, long-term direction and, ultimately, our ability to achieve our aspirations in the PC plus era.\"\n\n\n\n## Marketing and sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Lenovo became the first personal computer manufacturer to divide countries into emerging markets and mature markets. Lenovo then developed a different set of strategies for each category. Lenovo's competitors have widely adopted the same approach[20] In 2012, Lenovo made a major effort to expand its market share in developing economies such as Brazil and India through acquisitions and increased budgets for marketing and advertising.[79]\n\n\n\n### Celebrity sponsorships and endorsements[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2013, Lenovo announced that it had hired American actor Ashton Kutcher as a product engineer and spokesman. David Roman, Lenovo's chief marketing officer, said, \"His partnership goes beyond traditional bounds by deeply integrating him into our organization as a product engineer. Ashton will help us break new ground by challenging assumptions, bringing a new perspective and contributing his technical expertise to Yoga Tablet and other devices.\"[190] Kobe Bryant became an official ambassador for Lenovo smartphones in China and Southeast Asia in early 2013.[191] Bryant appeared in a social campaign titled \"The Everyday Kobe Challenge\" for the launch of Lenovo IdeaPhone K900 in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines in the same year.[192][193]\n\n\n\n### Sporting sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 2008 Summer Olympics Torch was designed by Lenovo\nLenovo was an official computer sponsor of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. When asked about Lenovo's brand Yang Yuanqing said, \"The Beijing Olympics were very good for brand awareness in countries like the US and Argentina, but not good enough.\"[194] The NFL has been a Lenovo customer since 2007. In July 2012, Lenovo and the National Football League (NFL) announced that Lenovo had become the NFL's \"Official Laptop, Desktop and Workstation Sponsor.\" Lenovo said that this was its largest sponsorship deal ever in the United States. NFL stars Jerry Rice, DeAngelo Williams, and Torry Holt were on hand for the announcement and a celebration with 1,500 Lenovo employees. Lenovo's sponsorship will last at least three years.[195]\n\n\nLenovo also become technology partner for Ducati Corse in Grand Prix motorcycle racing since 2018. And for the 2021 MotoGP it will become main sponsor for the Bolognese.[196]\n\n\nLenovo is also an official partner of the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes who play in nearby Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\n\nLenovo and FC Internazionale, in 2019, have signed a multi-year sponsorship agreement that makes Lenovo the Global Technology Partner of the Nerazzurri company.[197] In May 2021, Lenovo and Motorola Mobility decided to celebrate with a limited edition of Motorola Razr totally customized and produced in 2021 numbered pieces, to honor Inter who won their 19th Scudetto.[198] In July 2021 there was the launch of the new Inter Home shirt for the 2021–22 season, they unveiled the introduction of Lenovo as a sponsor on the back of the shirt.[199]\n\n\n\n### Television, internet, and other media[edit]\n\n\nLenovo used a short-film entitled *The Pursuit* in its \"For Those Who Do\" campaign launched in 2011. The film depicted a mysterious young woman using the IdeaPad Yoga 13 to stay one-step-ahead of her evil pursuers. Martin Campbell, who previously worked on action movies and James Bond films such as GoldenEye and the remake of Casino Royale, shot this film. Lenovo was the first Chinese company to make use of such marketing techniques.[149]\n\n\nIn May 2015, Lenovo hosted its first ever \"Tech World\" conference in Beijing.[200] ZUK Mobile, a separate company formed by Lenovo in 2014, announced several products at Tech World, These included slim power banks, 3D printers that can print food such as chocolate, an outdoor sound box, and a Wi-Fi based control system for home automation.[200]\n\n\n\n### China[edit]\n\n\nIn its home market China, Lenovo has a vast distribution network designed to make sure that there is at least one shop selling Lenovo computers within 50 kilometers of nearly all consumers. Lenovo has also developed close relationships with its Chinese distributors, who are granted exclusive territories and only carry Lenovo products.[79]\n\n\nAs of July 2013, Lenovo believes that urbanization initiatives being pushed by Premier Li Keqiang will allow it to sustain sales growth in China for the foreseeable future. Speaking at Lenovo's annual general meeting in Hong Kong in 2013, Yang Yuanqing said: \"I believe urbanisation will help us further increase the overall [domestic] PC market.\" Yang also stressed the opportunity presented by the China's relatively low penetration rate of personal computers. Lenovo previously benefited from the Chinese government's rural subsidies, part of a wider economic stimulus initiative, designed to increase purchases of appliances and electronics. That program, which Lenovo joined in 2004, ended in 2011. Lenovo enjoys consistent price premiums over its traditional competitors in rural markets and a stronger local sales and service presence.[201]\n\n\n\n### India[edit]\n\n\nLenovo has gained significant market share in India through bulk orders to large companies and government agencies. For example, the government of Tamil Nadu ordered a million ThinkPads from IBM/Lenovo in 2012 and single-handedly made the firm a market leader. Lenovo distributes most of the personal computers it sells in India through five national distributors such as Ingram Micro and Redington.[202]\n\n\nGiven that most smartphones and tablets are sold to individuals Lenovo is pursuing a different strategy making use of many small state-centric distributors. Amar Babu, Lenovo's managing director for India, said, \"To reach out to small towns and the hinterland, we have tied up with 40 regional distributors. We want our distributors to be exclusive to us. We will, in turn, ensure they have exclusive rights to distribute Lenovo products in their catchment area.\"[202] As of 2013, Lenovo had about 6,000 retailers selling smartphones and tablets in India. In February 2013, Lenovo established a relationship with Reliance Communications to sell smartphones. The smartphones carried by Reliance have dual-SIM capability and support both GSM and CDMA. Babu claims that the relative under penetration of smartphones in India represents an opportunity for Lenovo.[202]\n\n\nLenovo has assembled a team of senior managers familiar with the Indian market, launched mobile phones at all price points there, and worked on branding to build market share. As of February 2014, Lenovo claims that its sales of smartphones in India have been increasing 100% per quarter while the market is only growing 15–20% over the same period. Lenovo did marketing tests of its smartphones in November 2012 in Gujarat and some southern cities, where Lenovo already had a strong presence. Lenovo's strategy has been to create awareness, maintain a broad selection of phones at all price points, and develop distribution networks. Lenovo partnered with two national distributors and over 100 local distributors. As of February 2014, more than 7,000 retail outlets in India sold Lenovo smartphones. Lenovo has also partnered with HCL in order to set up 250 service centres in 110 cities.[203]\n\n\nIn India, Lenovo grants distributors exclusive territories but allows them to sell computers from other companies. Lenovo uses its close relationships with distributors to gain market intelligence and speed up product development.\n\n\nLenovo reported a year-on-year increase of about 951% in tablet sales in India for the first quarter of 2014. Canalys, a market research firm, said Lenovo took market share away from Apple and Samsung in the country.[204]\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\nLenovo first started doing business in South Africa, establishing a sales office, and then expanded to East African markets such as Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Rwanda. West Africa followed when Lenovo set-up a Nigerian legal office and then expanded to Ghana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Botswana.\n\n\nAccording to Lenovo's general manager for Africa, Graham Braum, Lenovo's strategy is to put \"great emphasis on products that sell well in Africa\" and roll out \"products alongside different African governments' rolling out of wireless technology\". Products such as the Lenovo Yoga series are popular in Africa because of their long battery life, as many areas have unreliable electrical supply. Other popular products include the Lenovo netbooks, which were introduced in 2008.[205]\n\n\nLenovo picked Nigeria in 2013 to release its smartphone because unlike South Africa and other African countries, there is no requirement to partner with a local telecom firm to sell its phones.[206]\n\n\nIn the long term, according to Braum, \"Lenovo in Africa will focus on continuing to consistently supply personal computer products and allow this market to grow, while moving into new territory such as mobile and enterprise.\"[205]\n\n\n\n### Singapore[edit]\n\n\nLenovo has had a presence in Singapore as early as its foundation, and with a focus on the Southeast Asia region, it is the location of one of Lenovo's three head offices.[207] Registered as Lenovo[208] (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., it is located at the New Tech Park in the Lorong Chuan district of the North-East Region of Singapore.[207][209]\n\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, Lenovo began the \"For Those Who Do\" marketing campaign in 2010, created by the ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi. It was part of Lenovo's first-ever global branding campaign, beyond its domestic market in China.[210] \"For Those Who Do\" was designed to appeal to young consumers in the 18- to 25-year-old demographic by stressing its utility to creative individuals that Lenovo's advertising refers to as \"doers\".[211] One of Lenovo's operational centers is located in North Carolina, United States. Lenovo also started manufacturing products in the United States in 2012.[212]\n\n\n\n### Goodweird[edit]\n\n\nLenovo launched a multi-year advertising campaign called \"Goodweird\" in the last half of 2015. Goodweird is designed to convey the idea that designs that seem strange initially often become familiar and widely accepted. The Goodweird campaign includes a video with famous images of early attempts to fly with the aid of homemade wings and a bicycle that transitions to a modern-day shot of a man soaring across mountains in a wingsuit before transitioning again to a shot of the Stealth Bomber. Lenovo worked with three agencies on Goodweird: London-based DLKW Low, We Are Social, and Blast Radius. Goodweird is part of Lenovo's wider strategy to appeal to millennials with an emphasis on design trendsetters. A portion of the funding for Goodweird is being directed to prominent YouTubers and Viners. BuzzFeed has been engaged to create relevant content.[213]\n\n\n\n## Security and privacy incidents[edit]\n\n\n### Superfish[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2015, Lenovo became the subject of controversy for having bundled software identified as malware on some of its laptops. The software, Superfish Visual Discovery, is a web browser add-on that injects Pricing advertising into search engine results pages. To intercept HTTPS-encrypted communications, the software also installed a self-signed public key certificate.[214][215] When the Superfish public-key cryptography was compromised, it was also discovered that the same private key was used across all installations of the software, leaving users vulnerable to security exploits utilizing the key.[216][217] Lenovo made between US$200,000 to 250,000 on its deal with Superfish.[218] In 2017 Lenovo agreed to pay US$3.5 million as part of a settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission.[219] and announced an apology to its customers and stock holders.\n\n\nThe head of Superfish responded to security concerns by saying the vulnerability was \"inadvertently\" introduced by Komodia, which built the application.[220] In response to the criticism, Lenovo detailed that it would cease further distribution and use of the Superfish software, and offered affected customers free six-month subscriptions to the McAfee LiveSafe software.[221] Lenovo issued a promise to reduce the amount of \"Software bloat\" it bundles with its Windows 10 devices, promising to only include Lenovo software, security software, drivers, and \"certain applications customarily expected by users\".[222] *Salon* tech writer David Auerbach compared the Superfish incident to the Sony DRM rootkit scandal, and argued that \"installing Superfish is one of the most irresponsible mistakes an established tech company has ever made.\"[223]\n\n\n\n### Lenovo Service Engine[edit]\n\n\nFrom October 2014 through June 2015, the UEFI firmware on certain Lenovo models had contained software known as \"Lenovo Service Engine\", which Lenovo says automatically sent non-identifiable system information to Lenovo the first time Windows is connected to the internet, and on laptops, automatically installs the Lenovo OneKey Optimizer program (software considered to be Software bloat) as well. This process occurs even on clean installations of Windows. It was found that this program had been automatically installed using a new feature in Windows 8, Windows Platform Binary Table, which allows executable files to be stored within UEFI firmware for execution on startup, and is meant to \"allow critical software to persist even when the operating system has changed or been reinstalled in a \"clean\" configuration\"; specifically, anti-theft security software. The software was discontinued after it was found that aspects of the software had security vulnerabilities, and did not comply with revised guidelines for appropriate usage of WPBT. On 31 July 2015, Lenovo released instructions and UEFI firmware updates meant to remove Lenovo Service Engine.[224][225][226]\n\n\n\n### Lenovo Customer Feedback program[edit]\n\n\nAt a third time in 2015, criticism arose that Lenovo might have installed software that looked suspicious on their commercial Think-PC lines. This was discovered by Computerworld writer Michael Horowitz, who had purchased several Think systems with the Customer Feedback program installed, which seemed to log usage data and metrics.[227] Further analysis by Horowitz revealed however that this was mostly harmless, as it was only logging the usage of some pre-installed Lenovo programs, and not the usage in general, and only if the user allowed the data to be collected. Horowitz also criticized other media for quoting his original article and saying that Lenovo preinstalled spyware, as he himself never used that term in this case and he also said that he does not consider the software he found to be spyware.[228]\n\n\n\n### Lenovo Accelerator[edit]\n\n\nAs of June 2016, a Duo Labs report stated that Lenovo was still installing bloatware, some of which leads to security vulnerabilities as soon as the user turns on their new PC.[229][230] Lenovo advised users to remove the offending app, \"Lenovo Accelerator\".[231] According to Lenovo, the app, designed to \"speed up the loading\" of Lenovo applications, created a man-in-the-middle security vulnerability.\n\n\n\n### U.S. Marine network security breach[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2021, *Bloomberg Business* reported that U.S. investigators found in 2008 that military units in Iraq were using Lenovo laptops in which the hardware had been altered. According to a testimony from the case in 2010, \"A large amount of Lenovo laptops were sold to the U.S. military that had a chip encrypted on the motherboard that would record all the data that was being inputted into that laptop and send it back to China\". Lenovo was unaware of the testimony. The U.S. military did not inform the company of any security concerns. Spokeswoman Charlotte West stated, \"As there have been no reports of any problems, we have no way to assess the allegations you cite or whether security concerns may have been triggered by third-party interference.\"[232]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![icon](image)Electronics portal\n* ![icon](image)Technology portal\n\n\n* List of computer system manufacturers\n* List of companies of China\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Locations | Lenovo US\". *www.lenovo.com*.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Lenovo\". *Forbes*.

Over the years, its focus on the Southeast Asia region has led to the establishment of one of Lenovo's three head offices in Singapore. Previously known as Lenovo (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., the company operated from the New Tech Park in the Lorong Chuan district, situated in the North-East Region of Singapore.\n\nHowever, in the present, Lenovo continues to thrive and evolve in Singapore. The company remains committed to the Southeast Asia market and has expanded its operations and engagement in the region. The office, still registered as Lenovo (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., remains strategically located at the New Tech Park in the Lorong Chuan district. This location provides numerous advantages, such as access to key markets and a flourishing business environment in Singapore, which supports Lenovo's growth and success in the region.\n\nThroughout the years, Lenovo's presence in Singapore has transitioned from its early establishment to a dynamic and forward-looking operation. The company's commitment to the Southeast Asia market and its continued investment in Singapore reflect its recognition of the region's strategic importance and the opportunities it presents.\n209. **^** \"Lenovo Singapore Pte Ltd\". *www.bloomberg.com*.

It was formed on November 1, 2015, as the legal successor of the original Hewlett-Packard after the company's enterprise product and business services divisions were spun off as a new publicly traded company, Hewlett Packard Enterprise.[2]\n\n\nHP is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the S&P 500 Index. It is the world's 2nd largest personal computer vendor by unit sales as of January 2021, after Lenovo.[3] In the 2023 *Fortune* 500 list, HP is ranked 63rd largest United States corporation by total revenue.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hewlett-Packard § History\n\nHewlett-Packard was founded in 1939 by Bill Hewlett and David Packard, who both graduated with degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1935. The company started off in the HP Garage in Palo Alto, California. On November 1, 2015, Hewlett-Packard was split into two companies. Its personal computer and printer businesses became HP Inc., while its enterprise business became Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The split was structured so that Hewlett-Packard changed its name to HP Inc. and spun off Hewlett-Packard-Packard Enterprise as a new publicly traded company. HP Inc. retains Hewlett-Packard's pre-2015 stock price history and its former stock ticker symbol, HPQ, while Hewlett Packard Enterprise trades under its own symbol, HPE.[2][5]\n\n\n\n### As HP Inc.[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2016, HP introduced a new PC gaming sub-brand known as Omen (reusing trademarks associated with VoodooPC), including gaming laptops and desktops (with the latter offering options such as CPU water cooling and Nvidia's GTX 1080 graphics, and promoted as VR-ready), and other accessories (such as monitors) designed to cater to the market.[6]\n\n\nIn November 2017, HP acquired Samsung Electronics' printer division for $1.05 billion.[7]\n\n\nIn February 2021, HP announced its acquisition of Kingston's gaming division HyperX for $425 million.[8][9] The deal only includes computer peripherals branded as HyperX, not memory or storage.\nThe sale was completed in June 2021.[10]\n\n\nIn February 2022, HP announced it had acquired the Edinburgh-based packaging development company, Choose Packaging, in an effort to strengthen its capabilities in the sustainable packaging vertical.[11][12]\n\n\nIn March 2022, HP announced the acquisition of the California-headquartered communications software and hardware provider Poly Inc. in an all-cash transaction. HP said the cash amount agreed was $40 per share, which implied a total enterprise value of $3.3bn, inclusive Poly's net debts.[13]\n\n\n\n### Attempted merger with Xerox[edit]\n\n\nOn November 5, 2019, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that print and digital document company Xerox was contemplating acquiring HP.[14] The company unanimously rejected two unsolicited offers, including a cash-and-stock offer at $22 per-share.[15][16] HP stated that there was \"uncertainty regarding Xerox’s ability to raise the cash portion of the proposed consideration\" (especially given that Xerox is a smaller company in terms of market cap than HP), and noted the company's aggressiveness.[16] On November 26, 2019, Xerox issued a public letter defending allegations by HP that its offer was \"uncertain\" and \"highly conditional\", and declared its intent to \"engage directly with HP shareholders to solicit their support in urging the HP Board to do the right thing and pursue this compelling opportunity.\"[17]\n\n\nXerox stated in January 2020 that it would propose the replacement of HP's board of directors during its next shareholder meeting in April 2020. In a statement to *TechCrunch*, HP disclosed a belief that Xerox's bid was being \"driven by\" activist shareholder Carl Icahn.[18] Xerox raised its bid to $24 per-share in February 2020.[19]\n\n\nOn February 21, 2020, HP instituted a shareholder rights plan to fend off Xerox's pursuit of a hostile takeover. Four days later, HP announced that, if shareholders rejected the Xerox purchase, it planned on offering $16 billion in capital return between fiscal 2020 and 2022, including $8 billion in additional share buybacks and raising its \"target long-term return of capital to 100% of free cash flow generation\". HP criticized Xerox's bid as a \"flawed value exchange\" based on \"overstated synergies\".[20][21] On March 5, 2020, HP rejected an offer at $24 per-share.[22]\n\n\nOn March 31, 2020, Xerox rescinded its bid to buy HP Inc, citing that \"the current global health crisis and resulting macroeconomic and market turmoil\" had \"created an environment that is not conducive to Xerox continuing to pursue an acquisition of HP Inc.\"[23]\n\n\n\n## Products and operations[edit]\n\n\nHP develops personal computers (PCs), printers and related supplies, as well as 3D Printing solutions.[2][1]: 5–6\n\n\nIn fiscal year 2022, total revenue of US$63 billion included US$29.2 billion from the sale of notebook computers, US$10.7 billion from the sale of desktop computers, US$11.8 billion from the sale of printer supplies, US$4.2 billion from the sale of commercial printers, and US$2.9 billion from the sale of consumer printers.[1]: 45–46 Over 65 percent of revenue in 2022 came from customers outside of the United States.[1]: 14\n\n\n\n### Product lines[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alternative HP logo used on some computers since 2016\n**Desktop computers**\n\n\n\n* Envy\n* Pro\n* ProOne\n* Omen\n* Pavilion\n\n\n**Business/enterprise portable computers**[24]\n\n\n\n* EliteBook: mainstream and high-end business laptops\n* ProBook: budget or small-business laptops\n* ZBook: workstation-class laptops for professionals\n\n\n**Consumer laptops and notebooks[24]**\n\n\n\n* Spectre: high-end sleek laptops\n* Envy: high-end laptops\n* Pavilion: mainstream and family laptops\n* HP (no name): budget laptops\n* Omen: laptops for gaming\n* Stream: low-end small laptops\n* Chromebook: low-end Chrome OS laptops\n\n\n**Printers**[25]\n\n\n\n* DeskJet: small home printers\n* Envy: medium home printers\n* Envy Inspire: medium home or office printers\n* Smart Tank: medium home office printers\n* OfficeJet: large printers for office\n* LaserJet: large printers for office or medium office\n\n\n### Audio partner[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2015, HP announced that Bang & Olufsen would become the company's new premium audio partner for its computers and other devices. The partnership replaced the one with Beats Electronics which ended upon its acquisition by Apple Inc.[26]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nThis article is about the company created in 2015. For information about controversies concerning the predecessor company, see Hewlett-Packard § Controversies.\n\n### Blocking third-party ink cartridges[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, HP introduced firmware in its printers that disabled the printers if users used ink or toner cartridges which did not contain “new or reused HP chips or electronic circuitry.” As a result, HP faced scathing criticism (such as that from the Electronic Frontier Foundation[27]) and paid millions in class-action lawsuits, such as to certain customers in the US ($1.5 million[28]), Canada ($700,000 CAD[29]), Australia, and Europe ($1.350 million[30]), but without admitting wrongdoing. HP's stated that the firmware was intended to provide \"the best consumer experience\" and \"protect\" customers from \"counterfeit and third-party ink cartridges that do not contain an original HP security chip and that infringe on our IP.\"[31]\n\n\nIn 2023, *PC World* reported that HP printers still prevent users from using third-party ink.[32]\n\n\n\n### Disabling all-in-one printers[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, HP was sued over allegations that it intentionally designed its all-in-one printers not to perform scanning or faxing when they were low on ink.[33]\n\n\n\n### Loss of company archives under Keysight[edit]\n\n\nA large part of Hewlett-Packard's historical company archives (consisting of over 100 boxes of correspondence and documents from the two founders) were acquired by Keysight Technologies at the time of its foundation in 2014.[34] These archives were completely lost when the 2017 Tubbs wildfire incinerated two buildings on the headquarters campus of Keysight in Santa Rosa, California.[34] A former HP employee who had previously been in charge of the archives commented that \"a huge piece of American business history is gone\", and Keysight disputed criticism that the archives had been inadequately protected.[34]\n\n\n\n### Xinjiang region[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Xinjiang internment camps and Uyghur genocide\n\nIn 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute accused at least 82 major brands, including HP Inc, of being potentially connected to forced Uyghur labor in the Chinese Xinjiang province.[35]\n\n\nIn 2022, in response to the U.S. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, HP responded, \"HP is committed to respecting human rights across our global supply chain and we prohibit the use of involuntary labor of any kind. HP also commits to respecting fundamental rights and freedoms defined in the United Nations (UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in an approach consistent with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) as outlined in our Human Rights Policy.\"[36][37]\n\n\n\n## Carbon footprint[edit]\n\n\nHP reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, at 254 Kt (−34 /-11.8% y-o-y)[38] and plans to reduce emissions 60% by 2025 from a 2015 base year.[39] This science-based target is aligned with Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.[40]\n\n\nAccording to a press release issued on April 20, 2021,[41] HP seeks to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions across the HP value chain by 2040, beginning with their Supplies business achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. \"Climate change is a defining challenge of our generation that demands immediate action and investment,\" said Enrique Lores, HP Inc. President and CEO. \"Now is a time for bold moves and ambitious goals that will protect our planet and create new sources of innovation and growth across the global economy. By driving toward net-zero carbon emissions across our entire value chain by 2040, product circularity and a forest positive framework, we will accelerate our progress and advance HP’s aspiration to become the world’s most sustainable and just technology company.\"[41]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![](image)San Francisco Bay Area portal\n\n\n* HP Labs\n* List of largest technology companies by revenue\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** \"HP Inc.

It was formed on November 1, 2015, as the legal successor of the original Hewlett-Packard after the company's enterprise product and business services divisions were spun off as a new publicly traded company, Hewlett Packard Enterprise.[2]\n\n\nHP is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the S&P 500 Index. It is the world's 2nd largest personal computer vendor by unit sales as of January 2021, after Lenovo.[3] In the 2023 *Fortune* 500 list, HP is ranked 63rd largest United States corporation by total revenue.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hewlett-Packard § History\n\nHewlett-Packard was founded in 1939 by Bill Hewlett and David Packard, who both graduated with degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1935. The company started off in the HP Garage in Palo Alto, California. On November 1, 2015, Hewlett-Packard was split into two companies. Its personal computer and printer businesses became HP Inc., while its enterprise business became Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The split was structured so that Hewlett-Packard changed its name to HP Inc. and spun off Hewlett-Packard-Packard Enterprise as a new publicly traded company. HP Inc. retains Hewlett-Packard's pre-2015 stock price history and its former stock ticker symbol, HPQ, while Hewlett Packard Enterprise trades under its own symbol, HPE.[2][5]\n\n\n\n### As HP Inc.[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2016, HP introduced a new PC gaming sub-brand known as Omen (reusing trademarks associated with VoodooPC), including gaming laptops and desktops (with the latter offering options such as CPU water cooling and Nvidia's GTX 1080 graphics, and promoted as VR-ready), and other accessories (such as monitors) designed to cater to the market.[6]\n\n\nIn November 2017, HP acquired Samsung Electronics' printer division for $1.05 billion.[7]\n\n\nIn February 2021, HP announced its acquisition of Kingston's gaming division HyperX for $425 million.[8][9] The deal only includes computer peripherals branded as HyperX, not memory or storage.\nThe sale was completed in June 2021.[10]\n\n\nIn February 2022, HP announced it had acquired the Edinburgh-based packaging development company, Choose Packaging, in an effort to strengthen its capabilities in the sustainable packaging vertical.[11][12]\n\n\nIn March 2022, HP announced the acquisition of the California-headquartered communications software and hardware provider Poly Inc. in an all-cash transaction. HP said the cash amount agreed was $40 per share, which implied a total enterprise value of $3.3bn, inclusive Poly's net debts.[13]\n\n\n\n### Attempted merger with Xerox[edit]\n\n\nOn November 5, 2019, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that print and digital document company Xerox was contemplating acquiring HP.[14] The company unanimously rejected two unsolicited offers, including a cash-and-stock offer at $22 per-share.[15][16] HP stated that there was \"uncertainty regarding Xerox’s ability to raise the cash portion of the proposed consideration\" (especially given that Xerox is a smaller company in terms of market cap than HP), and noted the company's aggressiveness.[16] On November 26, 2019, Xerox issued a public letter defending allegations by HP that its offer was \"uncertain\" and \"highly conditional\", and declared its intent to \"engage directly with HP shareholders to solicit their support in urging the HP Board to do the right thing and pursue this compelling opportunity.\"[17]\n\n\nXerox stated in January 2020 that it would propose the replacement of HP's board of directors during its next shareholder meeting in April 2020. In a statement to *TechCrunch*, HP disclosed a belief that Xerox's bid was being \"driven by\" activist shareholder Carl Icahn.[18] Xerox raised its bid to $24 per-share in February 2020.[19]\n\n\nOn February 21, 2020, HP instituted a shareholder rights plan to fend off Xerox's pursuit of a hostile takeover. Four days later, HP announced that, if shareholders rejected the Xerox purchase, it planned on offering $16 billion in capital return between fiscal 2020 and 2022, including $8 billion in additional share buybacks and raising its \"target long-term return of capital to 100% of free cash flow generation\". HP criticized Xerox's bid as a \"flawed value exchange\" based on \"overstated synergies\".[20][21] On March 5, 2020, HP rejected an offer at $24 per-share.[22]\n\n\nOn March 31, 2020, Xerox rescinded its bid to buy HP Inc, citing that \"the current global health crisis and resulting macroeconomic and market turmoil\" had \"created an environment that is not conducive to Xerox continuing to pursue an acquisition of HP Inc.\"[23]\n\n\n\n## Products and operations[edit]\n\n\nHP develops personal computers (PCs), printers and related supplies, as well as 3D Printing solutions.[2][1]: 5–6\n\n\nIn fiscal year 2022, total revenue of US$63 billion included US$29.2 billion from the sale of notebook computers, US$10.7 billion from the sale of desktop computers, US$11.8 billion from the sale of printer supplies, US$4.2 billion from the sale of commercial printers, and US$2.9 billion from the sale of consumer printers.[1]: 45–46 Over 65 percent of revenue in 2022 came from customers outside of the United States.[1]: 14\n\n\n\n### Product lines[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alternative HP logo used on some computers since 2016\n**Desktop computers**\n\n\n\n* Envy\n* Pro\n* ProOne\n* Omen\n* Pavilion\n\n\n**Business/enterprise portable computers**[24]\n\n\n\n* EliteBook: mainstream and high-end business laptops\n* ProBook: budget or small-business laptops\n* ZBook: workstation-class laptops for professionals\n\n\n**Consumer laptops and notebooks[24]**\n\n\n\n* Spectre: high-end sleek laptops\n* Envy: high-end laptops\n* Pavilion: mainstream and family laptops\n* HP (no name): budget laptops\n* Omen: laptops for gaming\n* Stream: low-end small laptops\n* Chromebook: low-end Chrome OS laptops\n\n\n**Printers**[25]\n\n\n\n* DeskJet: small home printers\n* Envy: medium home printers\n* Envy Inspire: medium home or office printers\n* Smart Tank: medium home office printers\n* OfficeJet: large printers for office\n* LaserJet: large printers for office or medium office\n\n\n### Audio partner[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2015, HP announced that Bang & Olufsen would become the company's new premium audio partner for its computers and other devices. The partnership replaced the one with Beats Electronics which ended upon its acquisition by Apple Inc.[26]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nThis article is about the company created in 2015. For information about controversies concerning the predecessor company, see Hewlett-Packard § Controversies.\n\n### Blocking third-party ink cartridges[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, HP introduced firmware in its printers that disabled the printers if users used ink or toner cartridges which did not contain “new or reused HP chips or electronic circuitry.” As a result, HP faced scathing criticism (such as that from the Electronic Frontier Foundation[27]) and paid millions in class-action lawsuits, such as to certain customers in the US ($1.5 million[28]), Canada ($700,000 CAD[29]), Australia, and Europe ($1.350 million[30]), but without admitting wrongdoing. HP's stated that the firmware was intended to provide \"the best consumer experience\" and \"protect\" customers from \"counterfeit and third-party ink cartridges that do not contain an original HP security chip and that infringe on our IP.\"[31]\n\n\nIn 2023, *PC World* reported that HP printers still prevent users from using third-party ink.[32]\n\n\n\n### Disabling all-in-one printers[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, HP was sued over allegations that it intentionally designed its all-in-one printers not to perform scanning or faxing when they were low on ink.[33]\n\n\n\n### Loss of company archives under Keysight[edit]\n\n\nA large part of Hewlett-Packard's historical company archives (consisting of over 100 boxes of correspondence and documents from the two founders) were acquired by Keysight Technologies at the time of its foundation in 2014.[34] These archives were completely lost when the 2017 Tubbs wildfire incinerated two buildings on the headquarters campus of Keysight in Santa Rosa, California.[34] A former HP employee who had previously been in charge of the archives commented that \"a huge piece of American business history is gone\", and Keysight disputed criticism that the archives had been inadequately protected.[34]\n\n\n\n### Xinjiang region[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Xinjiang internment camps and Uyghur genocide\n\nIn 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute accused at least 82 major brands, including HP Inc, of being potentially connected to forced Uyghur labor in the Chinese Xinjiang province.[35]\n\n\nIn 2022, in response to the U.S. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, HP responded, \"HP is committed to respecting human rights across our global supply chain and we prohibit the use of involuntary labor of any kind. HP also commits to respecting fundamental rights and freedoms defined in the United Nations (UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in an approach consistent with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) as outlined in our Human Rights Policy.\"[36][37]\n\n\n\n## Carbon footprint[edit]\n\n\nHP reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, at 254 Kt (−34 /-11.8% y-o-y)[38] and plans to reduce emissions 60% by 2025 from a 2015 base year.[39] This science-based target is aligned with Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.[40]\n\n\nAccording to a press release issued on April 20, 2021,[41] HP seeks to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions across the HP value chain by 2040, beginning with their Supplies business achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. \"Climate change is a defining challenge of our generation that demands immediate action and investment,\" said Enrique Lores, HP Inc. President and CEO. \"Now is a time for bold moves and ambitious goals that will protect our planet and create new sources of innovation and growth across the global economy. By driving toward net-zero carbon emissions across our entire value chain by 2040, product circularity and a forest positive framework, we will accelerate our progress and advance HP’s aspiration to become the world’s most sustainable and just technology company.\"[41]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![](image)San Francisco Bay Area portal\n\n\n* HP Labs\n* List of largest technology companies by revenue\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** \"HP Inc.

As of March 2023[update], Apple is the world's biggest company by market capitalization,[6] and with US$394.3 billion the largest technology company by 2022 revenue.[7] As of June 2022[update], Apple is the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales; the largest manufacturing company by revenue; and the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world. It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\n\nApple was founded as **Apple Computer Company** on April 1, 1976, by Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as **Apple Computer, Inc.** in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called \"1984\". By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\n\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as \"Wintel\"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\n\n\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then at $2 trillion in August 2020, and at $3 trillion in January 2022. In June 2023, it was valued at just over $3 trillion.[8] The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty. It has also been consistently ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Apple Inc.\n\n### 1976–1980: Founding and incorporation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Apple Inc. § 1971–1985: Jobs and Wozniak\n\n![](image)In 1976, Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in his parents' home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California.[9] Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak called the popular belief that the company was founded in the garage \"a bit of a myth\".[10] They moved some operations to the garage when the bedroom became too crowded.[11]\n![](image)The Apple I is Apple's first product, designed by Steve Wozniak and sold as an assembled circuit board without basic features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case. This unit received an aftermarket keyboard and a wooden case.\n![](image)The Apple II Plus was introduced in 1979, designed primarily by Wozniak.\nApple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership.[9][12] The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[13] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator.[14]: 57 Neither received the full selling price but in total earned $1,300 (equivalent to $7,000 in 2023). Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.[15] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which would not yet be marketed as a complete personal computer.[16] It went on sale soon after debut for $666.66 (equivalent to $3,600 in 2023).[17][18]: 180 Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked \"repeating digits\".[19]\n\n\nApple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,[20][21] without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded it.[22] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 (equivalent to $1,257,000 in 2023) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.[23] During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.[24]\n\n\nThe Apple II, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire.[25] It differed from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture. While the Apple I and early Apple II models used ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5+1⁄4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978.[26][27]\n\n\nThe Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first \"killer application\" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program released in 1979.[26] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office,[26] but Apple II market share remained behind home computers made by competitors such as Atari, Commodore, and Tandy.[28][29]\n\n\nOn December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol \"AAPL\") went public selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September 3, 2022[update]),[21] generating over $100 million, which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956.[30] By the end of the day, 300 millionaires were created, from a stock price of $29 per share[31] and a market cap of $1.778 billion.[30][31]\n\n\n\n### 1980–1990: Success with Macintosh[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Mac models and Timeline of the Apple II family\n\n![](image)The Macintosh, released in 1984, is the first mass-market personal computer to feature an integral graphical user interface and mouse.\nA critical moment in the company's history came in December 1979 when Jobs and several Apple employees, including human–computer interface expert Jef Raskin, visited Xerox PARC in to see a demonstration of the Xerox Alto, a computer using a graphical user interface. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000[32] shares (22.4 million split-adjusted shares as of September 3, 2022[update])[21] of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.[33] After the demonstration, Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface, and development of a GUI began for the Apple Lisa, named after Jobs's daughter.[34]\n\n\nThe Lisa division was plagued by infighting, and in 1982, Jobs was pushed off the project. The Lisa launched in 1983 and became the first mass marketed personal computer with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price and limited software library.[35]\n\n\nJobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's Macintosh division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low-cost computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division.[36] Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division, which at the time, generated most of the company's revenue.[37]\n\n\nIn 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer without a bundled programming language.[38] Its debut was signified by \"1984\", a $1.5 million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984.[39] This was hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success[40] and was called a \"masterpiece\" by CNN[41] and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by *TV Guide*.[42]\n\n\nThe advertisement created great interest in Macintosh, and sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in. Jobs had required 128 kilobytes of RAM, which limited its speed and software in favor of aspiring for a projected price point of $1,000 (equivalent to $2,900 in 2023). The Macintosh shipped for $2,495 (equivalent to $7,300 in 2023), a price panned by critics due to its slow performance.[43]: 195 In early 1985, this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired away from Pepsi two years earlier by Jobs[44] saying, \"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?\"[45] Sculley removed Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division, with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.[46]\n\n\nThe board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from leadership.[47] Jean-Louis Gassée informed Sculley that Jobs had been attempting to organize a boardroom coup and called an emergency meeting at which Apple's executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties.[47] Jobs resigned from Apple in September 1985 and took several Apple employees with him to found NeXT.[48] Wozniak had also quit his active employment at Apple earlier in 1985 to pursue other ventures, expressing his frustration with Apple's treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had \"been going in the wrong direction for the last five years\".[37][49][50] Wozniak remained employed by Apple as a representative,[49] receiving a stipend estimated to be $120,000 per year.[18] Jobs and Wozniak remained Apple shareholders after their departures.[51]\n\n\nAfter the departures of Jobs and Wozniak in 1985, Sculley launched the Macintosh 512K that year with quadruple the RAM, and introduced the LaserWriter, the first reasonably priced PostScript laser printer. PageMaker, an early desktop publishing application taking advantage of the PostScript language, was also released by Aldus Corporation in July 1985.[52] It has been suggested that the combination of Macintosh, LaserWriter, and PageMaker was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.[53]\n\n\nThis dominant position in the desktop publishing market[54] allowed the company to focus on higher price points, the so-called \"high-right policy\" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin, and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in speed. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, due to Jean-Louis Gassée's slogan of \"fifty-five or die\", referring to the 55% profit margins of the Macintosh II.[55]: 79–80\n\n\nThis policy began to backfire late in the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on IBM PC compatibles that offered some of the same functionality of the Macintosh at far lower price points. The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.[55]: 117–129 During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer.[56] Gassée left the company later that year.[57]\n\n\n\n### 1990–1997: Decline and restructuring[edit]\n\n\nThe company pivoted strategy and in October 1990 introduced three lower-cost models, the Macintosh Classic, the Macintosh LC, and the Macintosh IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand.[58] In 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system, adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.\n\n\n\nThe success of the lower-cost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue.[59] For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine *MacAddict* named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the \"first golden age\" of the Macintosh.[60]\n\n![](image)The PenLite is Apple's first tablet computer prototype, created in 1992 to bring the Mac OS to a tablet. It was canceled in favor of the Newton.[61]\nThe success of Apple's lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to the cannibalization of higher-priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points, aimed at different markets: the high-end Quadra series, the mid-range Centris series, and the consumer-marketed Performa series. This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between so many models.[62]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Apple II series was discontinued, which was expensive to produce, and the company decided was still taking sales away from lower-cost Macintosh models. After the launch of the LC, Apple began encouraging developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorized salespersons to direct consumers away from Apple II and toward Macintosh.[63] The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993.[64]\n\n\nApple also experimented with several other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including digital cameras, portable CD audio players, speakers, video game consoles, the eWorld online service, and TV appliances. Enormous resources were invested in the problem-plagued Newton tablet division, based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.[65]\n\n\nThroughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.[66] Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; instead, they sued Microsoft for using a GUI similar to the Apple Lisa in *Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.*[67] The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed.\n\n\nThe major product flops and the rapid loss of market share to Windows sullied Apple's reputation, and in 1993 Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler.[68]\n\n\nWith Spindler at the helm, Apple, IBM, and Motorola formed the AIM alliance in 1994 with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the PowerPC Reference Platform; PReP), which used IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows. That year, Apple introduced the Power Macintosh, the first of many computers with Motorola's PowerPC processor.[69]\n\n\nIn the wake of the alliance, Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build Macintosh clones. Over the next two years, 75 distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced. However, by 1996, Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of their own high-end computers, where profit margins were highest.[70]\n\n\nIn 1996, Spindler was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO. Hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator, Amelio made deep changes, including extensive layoffs and cost-cutting.[71]\n\n\nThis period was also marked by numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system (MacOS). The original Macintosh operating system (System 1) was not built for multitasking (running several applications at once). The company attempted to correct this with by introducing cooperative multitasking in System 5, but the company still felt it needed a more modern approach.[72] This led to the Pink project in 1988, A/UX that same year, Copland in 1994, and the attempted purchase of BeOS in 1996. Talks with Be stalled when the CEO, former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée, demanded $300 million instead of the $125 million Apple wanted to pay.[73]\n\n\nOnly weeks away from bankruptcy,[74] Apple's board decided NeXTSTEP was a better choice for its next operating system and purchased NeXT in late 1996 for $400 million, bringing back Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.[75]\n\n\n\n### 1997–2007: Return to profitability[edit]\n\n\nThe NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9, 1997,[76] and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio's resignation after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses.\n\n\nThe board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately began a review of the company's products. Jobs would order 70% of the company's products to be cancelled, resulting in the loss of 3,000 jobs, and taking Apple back to the core of its computer offerings.[77] The next month, in August 1997, Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a $150 million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing software for the Mac.[78] The investment was seen as an \"antitrust insurance policy\" for Microsoft who had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti-competitive practices.[79] Jobs also ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997, purchased the largest clone maker, Power Computing.[80] On November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the Apple Store website, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing that had been successfully used by PC manufacturer Dell.[81]\n\n\nThe moves paid off for Jobs; at the end of his first year as CEO, the company turned a $309 million profit.[77]\n\n\n\n![](image)\niMac\n![](image)\niBook\n![](image)\nPower Macintosh G3\n![](image)\nPowerBook G3\n\nOn May 6, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh: the iMac. The iMac was a huge success for Apple selling 800,000 units in its first five months[82] and ushered in major shifts in the industry by abandoning legacy technologies like the 3+1⁄2-inch diskette, being an early adopter of the USB connector, and coming pre-installed with internet connectivity (the \"i\" in iMac)[83] via Ethernet and a dial-up modem. The device also had a striking teardrop shape and translucent materials, designed by Jonathan Ive, who although hired by Amelio, would go on to work collaboratively with Jobs for the next decade to chart a new course the design of Apple's products.[84][85]\n\n\nA little more than a year later on July 21, 1999, Apple introduced the iBook, a laptop for consumers. It was the culmination of a strategy established by Jobs to produce only four products: refined versions of the Power Macintosh G3 desktop and PowerBook G3 laptop for professionals, along with the iMac desktop and iBook laptop for consumers. Jobs felt the small product line allowed for a greater focus on quality and innovation.[86]\n\n\nAt around the same time, Apple also completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital media production software for both professionals and consumers. Apple acquired of Macromedia's Key Grip digital video editing software project which was renamed Final Cut Pro when it was launched on the retail market in April 1999.[87] The development of Key Grip also led to Apple's release of the consumer video-editing product iMovie in October 1999.[88] Next, Apple successfully acquired the German company Astarte in April 2000, which had developed the DVD authoring software DVDirector, which Apple would sell as the professional-oriented DVD Studio Pro software product, and used the same technology to create iDVD for the consumer market.[88] In 2000, Apple purchased the SoundJam MP audio player software from Casady & Greene. Apple renamed the program iTunes, while simplifying the user interface and adding the ability to burn CDs.[89]\n\n\n2001 would be a pivotal year for the Apple with the company making three announcements that would change the course of the company.\n\n\nThe first announcement came on March 24, 2001, that Apple was nearly ready to release a new modern operating system, Mac OS X. The announcement came after numerous failed attempts in the early 1990s, and several years of development. Mac OS X was based on NeXTSTEP, OPENSTEP, and BSD Unix, with Apple aiming to combine the stability, reliability, and security of Unix with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface, heavily influenced by NeXTSTEP. To aid users in migrating from Mac OS 9, the new operating system allowed the use of OS 9 applications within Mac OS X via the Classic Environment.[90]\n\n\nIn May 2001, the company opened its first two Apple Store retail locations in Virginia and California,[91][92] offering an improved presentation of the company's products.[93] At the time, many speculated that the stores would fail,[94] but they went on to become highly successful, and the first of more than 500 stores around the world.[95]\n\n\nOn October 23, 2001, Apple debuted the iPod portable digital audio player. The product, which was first sold on November 10, 2001, was phenomenally successful with over 100 million units sold within six years.[96]\n\n\nIn 2003, Apple's iTunes Store was introduced. The service offered music downloads for 99¢ a song and integration with the iPod. The iTunes Store quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over five billion downloads by June 19, 2008.[97] Two years later, the iTunes Store was the world's largest music retailer.[98]\n\n\nIn 2002, Apple purchased Nothing Real for their advanced digital compositing application Shake,[99] as well as Emagic for the music productivity application Logic. The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company. The acquisition was followed by the development of Apple's consumer-level GarageBand application.[100] The release of iPhoto that year completed the iLife suite.[101]\n\n\n\n![](image)The MacBook Pro is Apple's first laptop with an Intel microprocessor, introduced in 2006.\nAt the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would move away from PowerPC processors, and the Mac would transition to Intel processors in 2006.[102] On January 10, 2006, the new MacBook Pro and iMac became the first Apple computers to use Intel's Core Duo CPU. By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line—over one year sooner than announced.[102] The Power Mac, iBook, and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the Mac Pro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro became their respective successors.[103] On April 29, 2009, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple was building its own team of engineers to design microchips.[104] Apple also introduced Boot Camp in 2006 to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.[105]\n\n\nApple's success during this period was evident in its stock price. Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple's stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80.[106] When Apple surpassed Dell's market cap in January 2006,[107] Jobs sent an email to Apple employees saying Dell's CEO Michael Dell should eat his words.[108] Nine years prior, Dell had said that if he ran Apple he would \"shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders\".[109]\n\n\n\n### 2007–2011: Success with mobile devices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The newly announced iPhone was on display at the 2007 MacWorld Expo.\nDuring his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced the renaming of Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple Inc., because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics.[110] This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone[111] and the Apple TV.[112] The company sold 270,000 iPhone units during the first 30 hours of sales,[113] and the device was called \"a game changer for the industry\".[114]\n\n\nIn an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without digital rights management (DRM), thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players if record labels would agree to drop the technology.[115] On April 2, 2007, Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.[116] Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce that all songs on the iTunes Store are available without their FairPlay DRM.[117]\n\n\nIn July 2008, Apple launched the App Store to sell third-party applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch.[118] Within a month, the store sold 60 million applications and registered an average daily revenue of $1 million, with Jobs speculating in August 2008 that the App Store could become a billion-dollar business for Apple.[119] By October 2008, Apple was the third-largest mobile handset supplier in the world due to the popularity of the iPhone.[120]\n\n\nOn January 14, 2009, Jobs announced in an internal memo that he would be taking a six-month medical leave of absence from Apple until the end of June 2009 and would spend the time focusing on his health. In the email, Jobs stated that \"the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well\", and explained that the break would allow the company \"to focus on delivering extraordinary products\".[121] Though Jobs was absent, Apple recorded its best non-holiday quarter (Q1 FY 2009) during the recession with revenue of $8.16 billion and profit of $1.21 billion.[122]\n\n\nAfter years of speculation and multiple rumored \"leaks\", Apple unveiled a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the iPad on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and all iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, though having very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the U.S. It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week.[123] In May of the same year, Apple's market cap exceeded that of competitor Microsoft for the first time since 1989.[124]\n\n\nIn June 2010, Apple released the iPhone 4,[125] which introduced video calling using FaceTime, multitasking, and a new uninsulated stainless steel design that acted as the phone's antenna. Later that year, Apple again refreshed its iPod line of MP3 players by introducing a multi-touch iPod Nano, an iPod Touch with FaceTime, and an iPod Shuffle that brought back the clickwheel buttons of earlier generations.[126] It also introduced the smaller, cheaper second generation Apple TV which allowed renting of movies and shows.[127]\n\n\nOn January 17, 2011, Jobs announced in an internal Apple memo that he would take another medical leave of absence for an indefinite period to allow him to focus on his health. Chief operating officer Tim Cook assumed Jobs's day-to-day operations at Apple, although Jobs would still remain \"involved in major strategic decisions\".[128] Apple became the most valuable consumer-facing brand in the world.[129] In June 2011, Jobs surprisingly took the stage and unveiled iCloud, an online storage and syncing service for music, photos, files, and software which replaced MobileMe, Apple's previous attempt at content syncing.[130] This would be the last product launch Jobs would attend before his death.\n\n\nOn August 24, 2011, Jobs resigned his position as CEO of Apple.[131] He was replaced by Cook and Jobs became Apple's chairman. Apple did not have a chairman at the time[132] and instead had two co-lead directors, Andrea Jung and Arthur D. Levinson,[133] who continued with those titles until Levinson replaced Jobs as chairman of the board in November after Jobs' death.[134]\n\n\n\n### 2011–present: Post-Jobs era, Tim Cook[edit]\n\n\nOn October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs died, marking the end of an era for Apple.[135] The next major product announcement by Apple was on January 19, 2012, when Apple's Phil Schiller introduced iBook's Textbooks for iOS and iBook Author for Mac OS X in New York City.[136] Jobs stated in the biography \"Steve Jobs\" that he wanted to reinvent the textbook industry and education.[137]\n\n\nFrom 2011 to 2012, Apple released the iPhone 4S[138] and iPhone 5,[139] which featured improved cameras, an intelligent software assistant named Siri, and cloud-synced data with iCloud; the third- and fourth-generation iPads, which featured Retina displays;[140][141] and the iPad Mini, which featured a 7.9-inch screen in contrast to the iPad's 9.7-inch screen.[142] These launches were successful, with the iPhone 5 (released September 21, 2012) becoming Apple's biggest iPhone launch with over two million pre-orders[143] and sales of three million iPads in three days following the launch of the iPad Mini and fourth-generation iPad (released November 3, 2012).[144] Apple also released a third-generation 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display and new iMac and Mac Mini computers.[141][142][145]\n\n\nOn August 20, 2012, Apple's rising stock price increased the company's market capitalization to a then-record $624 billion. This beat the non-inflation-adjusted record for market capitalization previously set by Microsoft in 1999.[146] On August 24, 2012, a US jury ruled that Samsung should pay Apple $1.05 billion (£665m) in damages in an intellectual property lawsuit.[147] Samsung appealed the damages award, which was reduced by $450 million[148] and further granted Samsung's request for a new trial.[148] On November 10, 2012, Apple confirmed a global settlement that dismissed all existing lawsuits between Apple and HTC up to that date, in favor of a ten-year license agreement for current and future patents between the two companies.[149] It is predicted that Apple will make $280 million per year from this deal with HTC.[150]\n\n\nIn May 2014, the company confirmed its intent to acquire Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine's audio company Beats Electronics—producer of the \"Beats by Dr. Dre\" line of headphones and speaker products, and operator of the music streaming service Beats Music—for $3 billion, and to sell their products through Apple's retail outlets and resellers. Iovine believed that Beats had always \"belonged\" with Apple, as the company modeled itself after Apple's \"unmatched ability to marry culture and technology.\" The acquisition was the largest purchase in Apple's history.[151]\n\n\n\n![](image)Apple Watch first generation (2015)\nDuring a press event on September 9, 2014, Apple introduced a smartwatch, the Apple Watch.[152] Initially, Apple marketed the device as a fashion accessory[153] and a complement to the iPhone, that would allow people to look at their smartphones less.[154] Over time, the company has focused on developing health and fitness-oriented features on the watch, in an effort to compete with dedicated activity trackers.\n\n\nIn January 2016, it was announced that one billion Apple devices were in active use worldwide.[155]\n\n\nOn June 6, 2016, *Fortune* released Fortune 500, its list of companies ranked on revenue generation. In the trailing fiscal year of 2015, Apple was listed as the top tech company.[156] It ranked third, overall, with $233 billion in revenue.[156] This represents a movement upward of two spots from the previous year's list.[156]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Apple announced the HomePod, its smart speaker aimed to compete against Sonos, Google Home, and Amazon Echo.[157] Towards the end of the year, *TechCrunch* reported that Apple was acquiring Shazam, a company that introduced its products at WWDC and specializing in music, TV, film and advertising recognition.[158] The acquisition was confirmed a few days later, reportedly costing Apple $400 million, with media reports that the purchase looked like a move to acquire data and tools bolstering the Apple Music streaming service.[159] The purchase was approved by the European Union in September 2018.[160]\n\n\nAlso in June 2017, Apple appointed Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg to head the newly formed worldwide video unit. In November 2017, Apple announced it was branching out into original scripted programming: a drama series starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, and a reboot of the anthology series Amazing Stories with Steven Spielberg.[161] In June 2018, Apple signed the Writers Guild of America's minimum basic agreement and Oprah Winfrey to a multi-year content partnership.[162] Additional partnerships for original series include Sesame Workshop and DHX Media and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide, as well as a partnership with A24 to create original films.[163]\n\n\nDuring the Apple Special Event in September 2017, the AirPower wireless charger was announced alongside the iPhone X, 8 and Watch Series 3. The AirPower was intended to wirelessly charge multiple devices, simultaneously. Though initially set to release in early 2018, the AirPower would be canceled in March 2019, marking the first cancellation of a device under Cook's leadership.[164]\n\n\nOn August 19, 2020, Apple's share price briefly topped $467.77, making it the first US company with a market capitalization of $2 trillion.[165]\n\n\n\n![](image)MacBook Air M1 (2020)\nDuring its annual WWDC keynote speech on June 22, 2020, Apple announced it would move away from Intel processors, and the Mac would transition to processors developed in-house.[166] The announcement was expected by industry analysts, and it has been noted that Macs featuring Apple's processors would allow for big increases in performance over current Intel-based models.[167] On November 10, 2020, the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and the Mac Mini became the first Mac devices powered by an Apple-designed processor, the Apple M1.[168]\n\n\nIn April 2022, it was reported that Samsung Electro-Mechanics would be collaborating with Apple on its M2 chip instead of LG Innotek.[169] Developer logs showed that at least nine Mac models with four different M2 chips were being tested.[170]\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that an effort to develop its own chips left Apple better prepared to deal with the semiconductor shortage that emerged during the pandemic era and led to increased profitability, with sales of Mac computers that included M1 chips rising sharply in 2020 and 2021. It also inspired other companies like Tesla, Amazon, and Meta Platforms to pursue a similar path.[171]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Apple opened an online store that allowed anyone in the US to view repair manuals and order replacement parts for specific recent iPhones, although the difference in cost between this method and official repair is anticipated to be minimal.[172]\n\n\nIn May 2022, a trademark was filed for RealityOS, an operating system reportedly intended for virtual and augmented reality headsets, first mentioned in 2017. According to Bloomberg, the headset may come out in 2023.[173] Further insider reports state that the device uses iris scanning for payment confirmation and signing into accounts.[174]\n\n\nOn June 18, 2022, the Apple Store in Towson, Maryland became the first to unionize in the U.S., with the employees voting to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.[175]\n\n\nOn July 7, 2022, Apple added Lockdown Mode to macOS 13 and iOS 16, as a response to the earlier Pegasus revelations; the mode increases security protections for high-risk users against targeted zero-day malware.[176]\n\n\nApple launched a buy now, pay later service called 'Apple Pay Later' for its Apple Wallet users in March 2023. The program allows its users to apply for loans between $50 and $1,000 to make online or in-app purchases and then repaying them through four installments spread over six weeks without any interest or fees.[177][178]\n\n\n\n## Products[edit]\n\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Apple Inc. products.\n\n### Mac[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac (computer)\n![A MacBook Air, in midnight color, on a wooden desk.](image)\nMacBook Air with M2 chip\n![An thin iMac in blue color on a desk.](image)\niMac with M1 chip\n\nThe Mac is Apple's family of personal computers. Macs are known for their ease of use[179] and distinctive aluminium, minimalist designs. Macs have been popular among students, creative professionals, and software engineers. The current lineup consists of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops, and the iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio and Mac Pro desktop computers.\n\n\nOften described as a walled garden, Macs use Apple silicon chips, run the macOS operating system, and include Apple software like the Safari web browser, iMovie for home movie editing, GarageBand for music creation, and the iWork productivity suite. Apple also sells pro apps: Final Cut Pro for video production, Logic Pro for musicians and producers, and Xcode for software developers.\n\n\nApple also sells a variety of accessories for Macs, including the Pro Display XDR, Apple Studio Display, Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard.\n\n\n\n### iPhone[edit]\n\n\nMain article: iPhone\n\n![An iPhone 14 Pro with Chinese user interface, held by a customer, screen facing the camera](image)iPhone 14 Pro\nThe iPhone is Apple's line of smartphones, which run the iOS operating system. The first iPhone was unveiled by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, new models have been released annually. When it was introduced, its multi-touch screen was described as \"revolutionary\" and a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry. The device has been credited with creating the app economy.\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the iPhone has 15% market share, yet represents 50% of global smartphone revenues, with Android phones accounting for the rest.[180][181] The iPhone has generated large profits for the company, and is credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies.[182]\n\n\n\n### iPad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: iPad\n\nThe iPad is Apple's line of tablets which run iPadOS. The first-generation iPad was announced on January 27, 2010. The iPad is mainly marketed for consuming multimedia, creating art, working on documents, videoconferencing, and playing games. The iPad lineup consists of several base iPad models, and the smaller iPad Mini, upgraded iPad Air, and high-end iPad Pro. Apple has consistently improved the iPad's performance, with the iPad Pro adopting the same M1 and M2 chips as the Mac; but the iPad still receives criticism for its limited OS.[183][184]\n\n\nAs of September 2020,[update] Apple has sold more than 500 million iPads, though sales peaked in 2013.[185] The iPad still remains the most popular tablet computer by sales as of the second quarter of 2020[update],[186] and accounted for nine percent of the company's revenue as of the end of 2021[update].[1]\n\n\nApple sells several iPad accessories, including the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, Smart Keyboard Folio, Magic Keyboard, and several adapters.\n\n\n\n### Other products[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nAirPods Max\n![](image)\nApple Watch Ultra\n\nApple makes several other products that it categorizes as \"Wearables, Home and Accessories\".[187] These products include the AirPods line of wireless headphones, Apple TV digital media players, Apple Watch smartwatches, Beats headphones and HomePod Mini smart speakers.\n\n\nAs of the end of 2021[update], this broad line of products comprises about 11% of the company's revenues.[1]\n\n\nAt WWDC 2023, Apple introduced its new VR headset, Vision Pro, along with visionOS.[188] Apple announced that it will be partnering with Unity to bring existing 3D apps to Vision Pro using Unity's PolySpatial technology.[189][190][191][192]\n\n\n\n### Services[edit]\n\n\nApple offers a broad line of services, including advertising in the App Store and Apple News app, the AppleCare+ extended warranty plan, the iCloud+ cloud-based data storage service, payment services through the Apple Card credit card and the Apple Pay processing platform, digital content services including Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+, and the iTunes Store.\n\n\nAs of the end of 2021[update], services comprise about 19% of the company's revenue.[1] Many of the services have been launched as of 2019[update] when Apple announced it would be making a concerted effort to expand its service revenues.[193]\n\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Marketing of Apple Inc.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Marketing of Apple Inc..** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Branding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first official logo of Apple Inc. was used from 1977 to 1998.[194]\nAccording to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet. Jobs thought the name \"Apple\" was \"fun, spirited and not intimidating\".[195] Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were fans of the Beatles,[196] but Apple Inc. had name and logo trademark issues with Apple Corps Ltd., a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1968. This resulted in a series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies. These issues ended with the settling of their lawsuit in 2007.[197]\n\n\nApple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's \"rainbow Apple\", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it.[198] On August 27, 1999,[199] Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation.[200]\n\n\nApple evangelists were actively engaged by the company at one time, but this was after the phenomenon had already been firmly established. Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism \"something that was stumbled upon,\"[201] while Ive claimed in 2014 that \"people have an incredibly personal relationship\" with Apple's products.[84]\n\n\n*Fortune* magazine named Apple the most admired company in the United States in 2008, and in the world from 2008 to 2012.[202] On September 30, 2013, Apple surpassed Coca-Cola to become the world's most valuable brand in the Omnicom Group's \"Best Global Brands\" report.[203] Boston Consulting Group has ranked Apple as the world's most innovative brand every year as of 2005[update].[204]\n\n\nAs of January 2021,[update] 1.65 billion Apple products were in active use.[205][206] In February 2023 that number exceeded 2 billion devices.[207][208]\n\n\n\n### Advertising[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple Inc. advertising\n\nApple's first slogan, \"Byte into an Apple\", was coined in the late 1970s.[209] From 1997 to 2002, the slogan \"Think different\" was used in advertising campaigns, and is still closely associated with Apple.[210] Apple also has slogans for specific product lines—for example, \"iThink, therefore iMac\" was used in 1998 to promote the iMac,[211] and \"Say hello to iPhone\" has been used in iPhone advertisements.[212] \"Hello\" was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, Newton, iMac (\"hello (again)\"), and iPod.[213]\n\n\nFrom the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, with the 1984 Super Bowl advertisement to the more modern Get a Mac adverts, Apple has been recognized for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products. However, claims made by later campaigns were criticized,[214] particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads.[215] Apple's product advertisements gained significant attention as a result of their eye-popping graphics and catchy tunes.[216] Musicians who benefited from an improved profile as a result of their songs being included on Apple advertisements include Canadian singer Feist with the song \"1234\" and Yael Naïm with the song \"New Soul\".[216]\n\n\n\n### Stores[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple Store\n\n![](image)Apple Fifth Avenue is the flagship store in New York City.\n![](image)A Genius Bar is at Apple's Regent Street store in London.\nThe first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs,[91] after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts.[93] Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers, and hired Ron Johnson in 2000.[93] Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997,[217] and opened the first two physical stores in 2001.[91] The media initially speculated that Apple would fail,[94] but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so.[94]\n\n\nOver the years, Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage, with 499 stores across 22 countries worldwide as of December 2017[update].[95] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.[218] Apple Stores underwent a period of significant redesign, beginning in May 2016. This redesign included physical changes to the Apple Stores, such as open spaces and re-branded rooms, as well as changes in function to facilitate interaction between consumers and professionals.[219]\n\n\nMany Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has built several stand-alone \"flagship\" stores in high-profile locations.[93] It has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores' designs and construction, specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes.[220] The success of Apple Stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers, who have lost traffic, control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores.[221] Due to the popularity of the brand, Apple receives a large number of job applications, many of which come from young workers.[218] Although Apple Store employees receive above-average pay, are offered money toward education and health care, and receive product discounts,[218] there are limited or no paths of career advancement.[218]\n\n\n\n### Market power[edit]\n\n\nOn March 16, 2020, France fined Apple €1.1 billion for colluding with two wholesalers to stifle competition and keep prices high by handicapping independent resellers. The arrangement created aligned prices for Apple products such as iPads and personal computers for about half the French retail market. According to the French regulators, the abuses occurred between 2005 and 2017 but were first discovered after a complaint by an independent reseller, eBizcuss, in 2012.[222]\n\n\nOn August 13, 2020, Epic Games, the maker of the popular game *Fortnite*, sued Apple and Google after its hugely popular video game was removed from Apple and Google's App Store. The suits came after both Apple and Google blocked the game after it introduced a direct payment system, effectively shutting out the tech titans from collecting fees.[223] In September 2020, Epic Games founded the Coalition for App Fairness together with thirteen other companies, which aims for better conditions for the inclusion of apps in the app stores.[224] Later, in December 2020, Facebook agreed to assist Epic in their legal game against Apple, planning to support the company by providing materials and documents to Epic. Facebook had, however, stated that the company would not participate directly with the lawsuit, although did commit to helping with the discovery of evidence relating to the trial of 2021. In the months prior to their agreement, Facebook had been dealing with feuds against Apple relating to the prices of paid apps as well as privacy rule changes.[225] Head of ad products for Facebook Dan Levy commented, saying that \"this is not really about privacy for them, this is about an attack on personalized ads and the consequences it's going to have on small-business owners,\" commenting on the full-page ads placed by Facebook in various newspapers in December 2020.[226]\n\n\n\n### Customer privacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)PRISM: a clandestine surveillance program under which the NSA collects user data from companies like Facebook and Apple[227]\nApple has a pro-privacy stance, actively making privacy-conscious features and settings part of its conferences, promotional campaigns, and public image.[228] With its iOS 8 mobile operating system in 2014, the company started encrypting all contents of iOS devices through users' passcodes, making it impossible at the time for the company to provide customer data to law enforcement requests seeking such information.[229] With the popularity rise of cloud storage solutions, Apple began a technique in 2016 to do deep learning scans for facial data in photos on the user's local device and encrypting the content before uploading it to Apple's iCloud storage system.[230] It also introduced \"differential privacy\", a way to collect crowdsourced data from many users, while keeping individual users anonymous, in a system that *Wired* described as \"trying to learn as much as possible about a group while learning as little as possible about any individual in it\".[231] Users are explicitly asked if they want to participate, and can actively opt-in or opt-out.[232]\n\n\nWith Apple's release of an update to iOS 14, Apple required all developers of iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch applications to directly ask iPhone users permission to track them. The feature, titled \"App Tracking Transparency\", received heavy criticism from Facebook, whose primary business model revolves around the tracking of users' data and sharing such data with advertisers so users can see more relevant ads, a technique commonly known as targeted advertising. Despite Facebook's measures, including purchasing full-page newspaper advertisements protesting App Tracking Transparency, Apple released the update in mid-spring 2021. A study by Verizon subsidiary Flurry Analytics reported only 4% of iOS users in the United States and 12% worldwide have opted into tracking.[233]\n\n\nHowever, Apple aids law enforcement in criminal investigations by providing iCloud backups of users' devices,[234] and the company's commitment to privacy has been questioned by its efforts to promote biometric authentication technology in its newer iPhone models, which do not have the same level of constitutional privacy as a passcode in the United States.[235]\n\n\nPrior to the release of iOS 15, Apple announced new efforts at combating child sexual abuse material on iOS and Mac platforms. Parents of minor iMessage users can now be alerted if their child sends or receives nude photographs. Additionally, on-device hashing would take place on media destined for upload to iCloud, and hashes would be compared to a list of known abusive images provided by law enforcement; if enough matches were found, Apple would be alerted and authorities informed. The new features received praise from law enforcement and victims rights advocates, however privacy advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, condemned the new features as invasive and highly prone to abuse by authoritarian governments.[236]\n\n\nIreland's Data Protection Commission launched a privacy investigation to examine whether Apple complied with the EU's GDPR law following an investigation into how the company processes personal data with targeted ads on its platform.[237]\n\n\nIn December 2019, a report found that the iPhone 11 Pro continues tracking location and collecting user data even after users have disabled location services. In response, an Apple engineer said the Location Services icon \"appears for system services that do not have a switch in settings.\"[238]\n\n\nAccording to published reports by Bloomberg News on March 30, 2022, Apple turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, an Apple representative referred the reporter to a section of the company policy for law enforcement guidelines, which stated, \"We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.\"[239]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple, Braeburn Capital, and FileMaker\n\n### Business trends[edit]\n\n\nThe key trends for Apple are (as of the financial year ending September 24):[240][241]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | 2011\n | 2012\n | 2013\n | 2014\n | 2015\n | 2016\n | 2017\n | 2018\n | 2019\n | 2020\n | 2021\n | 2022\n | 2023\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue figures\n |\n| Total revenue (US$ b)[242] | 108\n | 156\n | 170\n | 182\n | 233\n | 215\n | 229\n | 265\n | 260\n | 274\n | 365\n | 394\n | 383\n |\n| - iPhone revenue (US$ b)\n | 45.9\n | 78.6\n | 91.2\n | 101\n | 155\n | 136\n | 139\n | 164\n | 142\n | 137\n | 191\n | 205\n | 200\n |\n| - Mac revenue (US$ b)\n | 21.7\n | 23.2\n | 21.4\n | 24.0\n | 25.4\n | 22.8\n | 25.5\n | 25.1\n | 25.7\n | 28.6\n | 35.1\n | 40.1\n | 29.3\n |\n| - iPad revenue (US$ b)\n | 19.1\n | 30.9\n | 31.9\n | 30.2\n | 23.2\n | 20.6\n | 18.8\n | 18.3\n | 21.2\n | 23.7\n | 31.8\n | 29.2\n | 28.3\n |\n| - Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue (US$ b)\n | 11.9\n | 10.7\n | 10.1\n | 8.3\n | 10.0\n | 11.1\n | 12.8\n | 17.3\n | 24.4\n | 30.6\n | 38.3\n | 41.2\n | 39.8\n |\n| - Services revenue (US$ b)\n | 9.3\n | 12.8\n | 16.0\n | 18.0\n | 19.9\n | 24.3\n | 32.7\n | 39.7\n | 46.2\n | 53.7\n | 68.4\n | 78.1\n | 85.2\n |\n| Non-revenue figures\n |\n| Net profit (US$ b)[243] | 25.9\n | 41.7\n | 37.0\n | 39.5\n | 53.3\n | 45.6\n | 48.3\n | 59.3\n | 55.2\n | 57.4\n | 94.6\n | 99.8\n | 96.9\n |\n| Number of employees (k, FTE)\n | 60.4\n | 72.8\n | 80.3\n | 92.6\n | 110\n | 116\n | 123\n | 132\n | 137\n | 147\n | 154\n | 164\n | 161\n |\n| References | [244] | [245] | [246] | [247] | [248] | [249] | [250] | [251] | [252] | [253] | [254] | [255] | [256] |\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\n#### Senior management[edit]\n\n\nAs of March 16, 2021[update], the management of Apple Inc. includes:[257]\n\n\n\n* Tim Cook (chief executive officer)\n* Jeff Williams (chief operating officer)\n* Luca Maestri (senior vice president and chief financial officer)\n* Katherine L.

Steve Jobs (1997–2011)\n\n\n### Corporate culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Co-founder Steve Wozniak and engineer Andy Hertzfeld attended the Apple User Group Connection club in 1985.\n![](image)Universities with the most alumni at Apple\nApple is one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture. Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[258] According to a 2011 report in *Fortune*, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[259] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching *Star Trek* and attending *Star Trek* conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[260]\n\n\nAs the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often took longer than others.[261]\n\n\nThe Apple Fellows program awards employees for extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing. Recipients include Bill Atkinson,[262] Steve Capps,[263] Rod Holt,[262] Alan Kay,[264][265] Guy Kawasaki,[264][266] Al Alcorn,[267] Don Norman,[264] Rich Page,[262] Steve Wozniak,[262] and Phil Schiller.[268]\n\n\nAt Apple, employees are intended to be specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise.[*needs update*] Jobs saw this as a means of having \"best-in-class\" employees in every role. For instance, Ron Johnson—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores. This was done by Tim Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management.[269] Apple is known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a \"directly responsible individual\" or \"DRI\" in Apple jargon.[259][270] As an example, when iOS senior vice president Scott Forstall refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned Maps app, he was forced to resign.[271] Unlike other major U.S. companies, Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.[272]\n\n\nIn 2015, Apple had 110,000 full-time employees. This increased to 116,000 full-time employees the next year, a notable hiring decrease, largely due to its first revenue decline. Apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail, though its 2014 SEC filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base.[273] In September 2017, Apple announced that it had over 123,000 full-time employees.[274]\n\n\nApple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy, and has an anti-leak Global Security team that recruits from the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Secret Service.[275]\n\n\nIn December 2017, Glassdoor said Apple was the 48th best place to work, having originally entered at rank 19 in 2009, peaking at rank 10 in 2012, and falling down the ranks in subsequent years.[276]\n\n\nIn 2023, *Bloomberg*'s Mark Gurman revealed the existence of Apple's Exploratory Design Group (XDG), which was working to add glucose monitoring to the Apple Watch. Gurman compared XDG to Alphabet's X \"moonshot factory\".[277]\n\n\n\n### Offices[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Apple Park and Apple Campus\n\n![](image)Apple Park is the main headquarters in Cupertino.\nApple Inc.'s world corporate headquarters are located in Cupertino, in the middle of California's Silicon Valley, at Apple Park, a massive circular groundscraper building with a circumference of one mile (1.6 km). The building opened in April 2017 and houses more than 12,000 employees. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs wanted Apple Park to look less like a business park and more like a nature refuge, and personally appeared before the Cupertino City Council in June 2011 to make the proposal, in his final public appearance before his death.\n\n\n\n![](image)The original Apple Campus has the street address 1 Infinite Loop, Sunnyvale, California.\nApple also operates from the Apple Campus (also known by its address, 1 Infinite Loop), a grouping of six buildings in Cupertino that total 850,000 square feet (79,000 m2) located about 1 mile (1.6 km) to the west of Apple Park.[278] The Apple Campus was the company's headquarters from its opening in 1993, until the opening of Apple Park in 2017. The buildings, located at 1–6 Infinite Loop, are arranged in a circular pattern around a central green space, in a design that has been compared to that of a university.\n\n\nIn addition to Apple Park and the Apple Campus, Apple occupies an additional thirty office buildings scattered throughout the city of Cupertino, including three buildings as prior headquarters: Stephens Creek Three from 1977 to 1978, Bandley One from 1978 to 1982, and Mariani One from 1982 to 1993.[279] In total, Apple occupies almost 40% of the available office space in the city.[280]\n\n\nApple's headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are located in Cork in the south of Ireland, called the Hollyhill campus.[281] The facility, which opened in 1980, houses 5,500 people and was Apple's first location outside of the United States.[282] Apple's international sales and distribution arms operate out of the campus in Cork.[283]\n\n\nApple has two campuses near Austin, Texas: a 216,000-square-foot (20,100 m2) campus opened in 2014 houses 500 engineers who work on Apple silicon[284] and a 1.1-million-square-foot (100,000 m2) campus opened in 2021 where 6,000 people work in technical support, supply chain management, online store curation, and Apple Maps data management.\n\n\nThe company also has several other locations in Boulder, Colorado, Culver City, California, Herzliya (Israel), London, New York, Pittsburgh, San Diego, and Seattle that each employ hundreds of people.[285]\n\n\n\n### Litigation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Litigation involving Apple Inc.\n\nApple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.[286] In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include *Apple v. Samsung*, *Apple v. Microsoft*, *Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc.*, and *Apple Corps v. Apple Computer*. Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights. Most have been dismissed in the courts as shell companies known as patent trolls, with no evidence of actual use of patents in question.[287] On December 21, 2016, Nokia announced that in the U.S. and Germany, it has filed a suit against Apple, claiming that the latter's products infringe on Nokia's patents.[288] Most recently, in November 2017, the United States International Trade Commission announced an investigation into allegations of patent infringement in regards to Apple's remote desktop technology; Aqua Connect, a company that builds remote desktop software, has claimed that Apple infringed on two of its patents.[289] In January 2022, Ericsson sued Apple over payment of royalty of 5G technology.[290]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple\n\nApple is the world's largest technology company by revenue, the world's largest technology company by total assets,[291] and the world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer after Samsung.[292]\n\n\nIn its fiscal year ending in September 2011, Apple Inc. reported a total of $108 billion in annual revenues—a significant increase from its 2010 revenues of $65 billion—and nearly $82 billion in cash reserves.[293] On March 19, 2012, Apple announced plans for a $2.65-per-share dividend beginning in fourth quarter of 2012, per approval by their board of directors.[294]\n\n\nThe company's worldwide annual revenue in 2013 totaled $170 billion.[295] In May 2013, Apple entered the top ten of the *Fortune* 500 list of companies for the first time, rising 11 places above its 2012 ranking to take the sixth position.[296] As of 2016[update], Apple has around US$234 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which 90% is located outside the United States for tax purposes.[297]\n\n\nApple amassed 65% of all profits made by the eight largest worldwide smartphone manufacturers in quarter one of 2014, according to a report by Canaccord Genuity. In the first quarter of 2015, the company garnered 92% of all earnings.[298]\n\n\nOn April 30, 2017, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple had cash reserves of $250 billion,[299] officially confirmed by Apple as specifically $256.8 billion a few days later.[300]\n\n\nAs of August 3, 2018[update], Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization. On August 2, 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to reach a $1 trillion market value.[301][302] Apple was ranked No. 4 on the 2018 *Fortune* 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[303]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Apple reported an 11% decline in Q3 profits compared to 2021. Its revenue in the same period rose 2% year-on-year to $83 billion, though this figure was also lower than in 2021, where the increase was at 36%. The general downturn is reportedly caused by the slowing global economy and supply chain disruptions in China.[304]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Apple reported a decline in its sales for the first quarter of 2023. Compared to that of 2022, revenue for 2023 fell by 3%. This is Apple's second consecutive quarter of sales decline. This fall is attributed to the slowing economy and consumers putting off purchases of iPads and computers due to increased pricing. However, iPhone sales held up with a year-on-year increase of 1.5%. According to Apple, demands for such devices were strong, particularly in Latin America and South Asia.[305]\n\n\n\n### Taxes[edit]\n\n\nApple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the British Virgin Islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to *The New York Times*, in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the \"Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich\", which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.[306][307]\n\n\nBritish Conservative Party Member of Parliament Charlie Elphicke published research on October 30, 2012,[308] which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard corporate tax rates. He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals, which also included Google and The Coca-Cola Company, to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.[309]\n\n\nAccording to a US Senate report on the company's offshore tax structure concluded in May 2013, Apple has held billions of dollars in profits in Irish subsidiaries to pay little or no taxes to any government by using an unusual global tax structure.[310] The main subsidiary, a holding company that includes Apple's retail stores throughout Europe, has not paid any corporate income tax in the last five years. \"Apple has exploited a difference between Irish and U.S. tax residency rules\", the report said.[311]\n\n\nOn May 21, 2013, Apple CEO Tim Cook defended his company's tax tactics at a Senate hearing.[312]\n\n\nApple says that it is the single largest taxpayer in the U.S., with an effective tax rate of approximately of 26% as of Q2 FY2016.[313] In an interview with the German newspaper *FAZ* in October 2017, Tim Cook stated that Apple was the biggest taxpayer worldwide.[314]\n\n\nIn 2016, after a two-year investigation, the European Commission claimed that Apple's use of a hybrid Double Irish tax arrangement constituted \"illegal state aid\" from Ireland, and ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in unpaid taxes, the largest corporate tax fine in history. This was later annulled, after the European General Court ruled that the Commission had provided insufficient evidence.[315][316] In 2018, Apple repatriated $285 billion to America, resulting in a $38 billion tax payment spread over the following 8 years.[317]\n\n\n\n### Charity[edit]\n\n\nApple is a partner of (PRODUCT)RED, a fundraising campaign for AIDS charity. In November 2014, Apple arranged for all App Store revenue in a two-week period to go to the fundraiser,[318] generating more than US$20 million,[319] and in March 2017, it released an iPhone 7 with a red color finish.[320]\n\n\nApple contributes financially to fundraisers in times of natural disasters. In November 2012, it donated $2.5 million to the American Red Cross to aid relief efforts after Hurricane Sandy,[321] and in 2017 it donated $5 million to relief efforts for both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey,[322] as well as for the 2017 Central Mexico earthquake.[323] The company has also used its iTunes platform to encourage donations in the wake of environmental disasters and humanitarian crises, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake,[324] the 2011 Japan earthquake,[325] Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in November 2013,[326] and the 2015 European migrant crisis.[327] Apple emphasizes that it does not incur any processing or other fees for iTunes donations, sending 100% of the payments directly to relief efforts, though it also acknowledges that the Red Cross does not receive any personal information on the users donating and that the payments may not be tax deductible.[328]\n\n\nOn April 14, 2016, Apple and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) announced that they have engaged in a partnership to, \"help protect life on our planet.\" Apple released a special page in the iTunes App Store, Apps for Earth. In the arrangement, Apple has committed that through April 24, WWF will receive 100% of the proceeds from the applications participating in the App Store via both the purchases of any paid apps and the In-App Purchases. Apple and WWF's Apps for Earth campaign raised more than $8 million in total proceeds to support WWF's conservation work. WWF announced the results at WWDC 2016 in San Francisco.[329]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Apple's CEO Cook announced that the company will be donating \"millions\" of masks to health workers in the United States and Europe.[330]\n\n\nOn January 13, 2021, Apple announced a $100 million \"Racial Equity and Justice Initiative\" to help combat institutional racism worldwide.[331][332]\n\n\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environmental impact of Apple\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Environmental impact of Apple.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Apple Energy[edit]\n\n\nApple Energy, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple Inc. that sells solar energy. As of June 6, 2016[update], Apple's solar farms in California and Nevada have been declared to provide 217.9 megawatts of solar generation capacity.[333] In addition to the company's solar energy production, Apple has received regulatory approval to construct a landfill gas energy plant in North Carolina. Apple will use the methane emissions to generate electricity.[334] Apple's North Carolina data center is already powered entirely with energy from renewable sources.[335]\n\n\n\n### Energy and resources[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, Climate Counts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category \"Striding\".[336] This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a \"stuck icon\", adding that Apple at the time was \"a choice to avoid for the climate-conscious consumer\".[337]\n\n\nFollowing a Greenpeace protest, Apple released a statement on April 17, 2012, committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to 100% renewable clean energy.[338][339] By 2013, Apple was using 100% renewable energy to power their data centers. Overall, 75% of the company's power came from clean renewable sources.[340]\n\n\nIn May 2015, Greenpeace evaluated the state of the Green Internet and commended Apple on their environmental practices saying, \"Apple's commitment to renewable energy has helped set a new bar for the industry, illustrating in very concrete terms that a 100% renewable Internet is within its reach, and providing several models of intervention for other companies that want to build a sustainable Internet.\"[341]\n\n\nAs of 2016[update], Apple states that 100% of its U.S. operations run on renewable energy, 100% of Apple's data centers run on renewable energy and 93% of Apple's global operations run on renewable energy.[342] However, the facilities are connected to the local grid which usually contains a mix of fossil and renewable sources, so Apple carbon offsets its electricity use.[343] The Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) allows consumers to see the effect a product has on the environment. Each product receives a Gold, Silver, or Bronze rank depending on its efficiency and sustainability. Every Apple tablet, notebook, desktop computer, and display that EPEAT ranks achieves a Gold rating, the highest possible. Although Apple's data centers recycle water 35 times,[344] the increased activity in retail, corporate and data centers also increase the amount of water use to 573 million US gal (2.2 million m3) in 2015.[345]\n\n\nDuring an event on March 21, 2016, Apple provided a status update on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable in all of its worldwide operations. Lisa P. Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016[update], 93% of Apple's worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from post-consumer recycled paper or sustainably managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products.[346] Apple working in partnership with Conservation Fund, have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in Maine and North Carolina. Another partnership announced is with the World Wildlife Fund to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres (4,000 km2) of forests in China. Featured was the company's installation of a 40 MW solar power plant in the Sichuan province of China that was tailor-made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple's Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company's energy carbon footprint in the country. In Singapore, Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple's Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy. Liam was introduced to the world, an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter designed by Apple Engineers in California specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones. Reuses and recycles parts from traded in products.[347]\n\n\nApple announced on August 16, 2016, that Lens Technology, one of its major suppliers in China, has committed to power all its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by 2018. The commitment is a large step in Apple's efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint in China.[348] Apple also announced that all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL's Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The standard, which started in January 2015, certifies that all manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or converted into energy (when necessary). Since the program began, nearly 140,000 metric tons of waste have been diverted from landfills.[349]\n\n\nOn July 21, 2020, Apple announced its plan to become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. In the next 10 years, Apple will try to lower emissions with a series of innovative actions, including: low carbon product design, expanding energy efficiency, renewable energy, process and material innovations, and carbon removal.[350]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Apple said that it had started a $200 million fund in order to combat climate change by removing 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year.[351]\n\n\nIn February 2022, the NewClimate Institute, a German environmental policy think tank, published a survey evaluating the transparency and progress of the climate strategies and carbon neutrality pledges announced by 25 major companies in the United States that found that Apple's carbon neutrality pledge and climate strategy was unsubstantiated and misleading.[352][353]\n\n\n\n### Toxins[edit]\n\n\nFollowing further campaigns by Greenpeace,[354] in 2008, Apple became the first electronics manufacturer to eliminate all polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in its complete product line.[355] In June 2007, Apple began replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit LCD displays in its computers with mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass, starting with the upgraded MacBook Pro.[356][357][358][359] Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the CO2e, emissions, materials, and electrical usage concerning every product they currently produce or have sold in the past (and which they have enough data needed to produce the report), in their portfolio on their homepage. Allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions on the products they offer for sale.[360] In June 2009, Apple's iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, and BFRs.[356][361] All Apple products now have mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays, arsenic-free glass, and non-PVC cables. All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product's respective regulatory category.[356][362]\n\n\nIn November 2011, Apple was featured in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy policy, and how \"green\" their products are. The company ranked fourth of fifteen electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10.[363] Greenpeace praised Apple's sustainability, noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. Apple continues to score well on product ratings, with all of their products now being free of PVC plastic and BFRs. However, the guide criticized Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data, and for not setting any targets to reduce emissions.[364] In January 2012, Apple requested that its cable maker, Volex, begin producing halogen-free USB and power cables.[365]\n\n\n\n### Green bonds[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2016, Apple issued a $1.5 billion green bond (climate bond), the first ever of its kind by a U.S. tech company. The green bond proceeds are dedicated to the financing of environmental projects.[366]\n\n\n\n## Supply chain[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple supply chain\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Apple supply chain.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\nApple products were made in America in Apple-owned factories until the late 1990s; however, as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by *The New York Times*, Apple insiders \"believe the vast scale of overseas factories, as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers, have so outpaced their American counterparts that \"Made in the USA\" is no longer a viable option for most Apple products\".[367]\n\n\nThe company's manufacturing, procurement, and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: \"Nobody wants to buy sour milk.\"[368][369]\n\n\nIn May 2017, the company announced a $1 billion funding project for \"advanced manufacturing\" in the United States,[370] and subsequently invested $200 million in Corning Inc., a manufacturer of toughened Gorilla Glass technology used in its iPhone devices.[371] The following December, Apple's chief operating officer, Jeff Williams, told *CNBC* that the \"$1 billion\" amount was \"absolutely not\" the final limit on its spending, elaborating that \"We're not thinking in terms of a fund limit... We're thinking about, where are the opportunities across the U.S. to help nurture companies that are making the advanced technology— and the advanced manufacturing that goes with that— that quite frankly is essential to our innovation.\"[372]\n\n\nAs of 2021[update], Apple uses components from 43 countries.[373] The majority of assembling is done by Taiwanese original design manufacturer firms Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Compal Electronics with factories mostly located inside China,[374] but also Brazil,[375] and India.[376]\n\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., (TSMC) is a pure-play semiconductor manufacturing company. They make the majority of Apple's smartphone SoCs, with Samsung Semiconductor, playing a minority role.[377] Apple, alone accounted for over 25% of TSMC's total income in 2021.[378] Apple's Bionic lineup of smartphone SoCs, are currently made exclusively by TSMC[379] from the A7 bionic onwards, previously manufacturing was shared with Samsung. The M series of Apple SoC for consumer computers and tablets is made by TSMC as well.[380]\n\n\nDuring the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.[381] This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the PCI bus in the 7500/8500/9500 Power Macs. Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as USB, AGP, HyperTransport, Wi-Fi, NVMe, PCIe and others in its products. FireWire is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as IEEE 1394 and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States.[382]\n\n\nApple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market. In July 2012, during a conference call with investors, CEO Tim Cook said that he \"[loves] India\", but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region.[383] India's requirement that 30% of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as \"really adds cost to getting product to market\".[384] In May 2016, Apple opened an iOS app development center in Bangalore and a maps development office for 4,000 staff in Hyderabad.[385] In March, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple would begin manufacturing iPhone models in India \"over the next two months\",[386] and in May, the *Journal* wrote that an Apple manufacturer had begun production of iPhone SE in the country,[387] while Apple told *CNBC* that the manufacturing was for a \"small number\" of units.[388] In April 2019, Apple initiated manufacturing of iPhone 7 at its Bengaluru facility, keeping in mind demand from local customers even as they seek more incentives from the government of India.[389] At the beginning of 2020, Tim Cook announced that Apple schedules the opening of its first physical outlet in India for 2021, while an online store is to be launched by the end of the year.[390]\n\n\nDuring the 2022 COVID-19 protests in China, Chinese state-owned company Wingtech was reported by *The Wall Street Journal* to gain an additional foothold in Apple's supply chain following protests at a Foxconn factory in the Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone.[391]\n\n\n\n### Worker organizations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple and unions\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Apple and unions.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\nIn 2006, one complex of factories in Shenzhen, China that assembled the iPod and other items had over 200,000 workers living and working within it. Employees regularly worked more than 60 hours per week and made around $100 per month. A little over half of the workers' earnings was required to pay for rent and food from the company.[392][393]\n\n\nApple immediately launched an investigation after the 2006 media report, and worked with their manufacturers to ensure acceptable working conditions.[394] In 2007, Apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding worker's rights, slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply. Yearly progress reports have been published as of 2008[update].[395] In 2011, Apple admitted that its suppliers' child labor practices in China had worsened.[396]\n\n\nThe Foxconn suicides occurred between January and November 2010, when 18 Foxconn (Chinese: 富士康) employees attempted suicide,[397] resulting in 14 deaths—the company was the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, for clients including Apple, at the time.[397][398][399] The suicides drew media attention, and employment practices at Foxconn were investigated by Apple.[400] Apple issued a public statement about the suicides, and company spokesperson Steven Dowling said:\n\n\n\n\n> [Apple is] saddened and upset by the recent suicides at Foxconn ... A team from Apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made.[401]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe statement was released after the results from the company's probe into its suppliers' labor practices were published in early 2010. Foxconn was not specifically named in the report, but Apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws, including Apple's own rules, and some child labor existed in a number of factories.[401] Apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides.[402]\n\n\nAlso in 2010, workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens. One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses.[403] After a high suicide rate in a Foxconn facility in China making iPads and iPhones, albeit a lower rate than that of China as a whole,[404] workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves.[405] Workers in factories producing Apple products have also been exposed to hexane, a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products.[406]\n\n\nA 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, despite Apple's promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was once again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. While the BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing as of 2010[update], Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: \"We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions\".[402]\n\n\nIn December 2014, the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple's iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65-hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in \"primitive, dark and filthy dorms\" where they sleep \"on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room.\" Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers.[407]\n\n\nIn 2019, there were reports stating that some of Foxconn's managers had used rejected parts to build iPhones and that Apple was investigating the issue.[408]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Apple Inc. media events\n* Pixar\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Apple 10-K Report FY2021\" (PDF).

As of March 2023[update], Apple is the world's biggest company by market capitalization,[6] and with US$394.3 billion the largest technology company by 2022 revenue.[7] As of June 2022[update], Apple is the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales; the largest manufacturing company by revenue; and the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world. It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\n\nApple was founded as **Apple Computer Company** on April 1, 1976, by Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as **Apple Computer, Inc.** in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called \"1984\". By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\n\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as \"Wintel\"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\n\n\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then at $2 trillion in August 2020, and at $3 trillion in January 2022. In June 2023, it was valued at just over $3 trillion.[8] The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty. It has also been consistently ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Apple Inc.\n\n### 1976–1980: Founding and incorporation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Apple Inc. § 1971–1985: Jobs and Wozniak\n\n![](image)In 1976, Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in his parents' home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California.[9] Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak called the popular belief that the company was founded in the garage \"a bit of a myth\".[10] They moved some operations to the garage when the bedroom became too crowded.[11]\n![](image)The Apple I is Apple's first product, designed by Steve Wozniak and sold as an assembled circuit board without basic features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case. This unit received an aftermarket keyboard and a wooden case.\n![](image)The Apple II Plus was introduced in 1979, designed primarily by Wozniak.\nApple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership.[9][12] The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[13] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator.[14]: 57 Neither received the full selling price but in total earned $1,300 (equivalent to $7,000 in 2023). Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.[15] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which would not yet be marketed as a complete personal computer.[16] It went on sale soon after debut for $666.66 (equivalent to $3,600 in 2023).[17][18]: 180 Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked \"repeating digits\".[19]\n\n\nApple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,[20][21] without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded it.[22] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 (equivalent to $1,257,000 in 2023) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.[23] During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.[24]\n\n\nThe Apple II, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire.[25] It differed from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture. While the Apple I and early Apple II models used ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5+1⁄4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978.[26][27]\n\n\nThe Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first \"killer application\" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program released in 1979.[26] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office,[26] but Apple II market share remained behind home computers made by competitors such as Atari, Commodore, and Tandy.[28][29]\n\n\nOn December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol \"AAPL\") went public selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September 3, 2022[update]),[21] generating over $100 million, which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956.[30] By the end of the day, 300 millionaires were created, from a stock price of $29 per share[31] and a market cap of $1.778 billion.[30][31]\n\n\n\n### 1980–1990: Success with Macintosh[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Mac models and Timeline of the Apple II family\n\n![](image)The Macintosh, released in 1984, is the first mass-market personal computer to feature an integral graphical user interface and mouse.\nA critical moment in the company's history came in December 1979 when Jobs and several Apple employees, including human–computer interface expert Jef Raskin, visited Xerox PARC in to see a demonstration of the Xerox Alto, a computer using a graphical user interface. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000[32] shares (22.4 million split-adjusted shares as of September 3, 2022[update])[21] of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.[33] After the demonstration, Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface, and development of a GUI began for the Apple Lisa, named after Jobs's daughter.[34]\n\n\nThe Lisa division was plagued by infighting, and in 1982, Jobs was pushed off the project. The Lisa launched in 1983 and became the first mass marketed personal computer with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price and limited software library.[35]\n\n\nJobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's Macintosh division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low-cost computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division.[36] Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division, which at the time, generated most of the company's revenue.[37]\n\n\nIn 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer without a bundled programming language.[38] Its debut was signified by \"1984\", a $1.5 million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984.[39] This was hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success[40] and was called a \"masterpiece\" by CNN[41] and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by *TV Guide*.[42]\n\n\nThe advertisement created great interest in Macintosh, and sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in. Jobs had required 128 kilobytes of RAM, which limited its speed and software in favor of aspiring for a projected price point of $1,000 (equivalent to $2,900 in 2023). The Macintosh shipped for $2,495 (equivalent to $7,300 in 2023), a price panned by critics due to its slow performance.[43]: 195 In early 1985, this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired away from Pepsi two years earlier by Jobs[44] saying, \"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?\"[45] Sculley removed Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division, with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.[46]\n\n\nThe board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from leadership.[47] Jean-Louis Gassée informed Sculley that Jobs had been attempting to organize a boardroom coup and called an emergency meeting at which Apple's executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties.[47] Jobs resigned from Apple in September 1985 and took several Apple employees with him to found NeXT.[48] Wozniak had also quit his active employment at Apple earlier in 1985 to pursue other ventures, expressing his frustration with Apple's treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had \"been going in the wrong direction for the last five years\".[37][49][50] Wozniak remained employed by Apple as a representative,[49] receiving a stipend estimated to be $120,000 per year.[18] Jobs and Wozniak remained Apple shareholders after their departures.[51]\n\n\nAfter the departures of Jobs and Wozniak in 1985, Sculley launched the Macintosh 512K that year with quadruple the RAM, and introduced the LaserWriter, the first reasonably priced PostScript laser printer. PageMaker, an early desktop publishing application taking advantage of the PostScript language, was also released by Aldus Corporation in July 1985.[52] It has been suggested that the combination of Macintosh, LaserWriter, and PageMaker was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.[53]\n\n\nThis dominant position in the desktop publishing market[54] allowed the company to focus on higher price points, the so-called \"high-right policy\" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin, and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in speed. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, due to Jean-Louis Gassée's slogan of \"fifty-five or die\", referring to the 55% profit margins of the Macintosh II.[55]: 79–80\n\n\nThis policy began to backfire late in the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on IBM PC compatibles that offered some of the same functionality of the Macintosh at far lower price points. The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.[55]: 117–129 During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer.[56] Gassée left the company later that year.[57]\n\n\n\n### 1990–1997: Decline and restructuring[edit]\n\n\nThe company pivoted strategy and in October 1990 introduced three lower-cost models, the Macintosh Classic, the Macintosh LC, and the Macintosh IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand.[58] In 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system, adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.\n\n\n\nThe success of the lower-cost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue.[59] For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine *MacAddict* named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the \"first golden age\" of the Macintosh.[60]\n\n![](image)The PenLite is Apple's first tablet computer prototype, created in 1992 to bring the Mac OS to a tablet. It was canceled in favor of the Newton.[61]\nThe success of Apple's lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to the cannibalization of higher-priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points, aimed at different markets: the high-end Quadra series, the mid-range Centris series, and the consumer-marketed Performa series. This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between so many models.[62]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Apple II series was discontinued, which was expensive to produce, and the company decided was still taking sales away from lower-cost Macintosh models. After the launch of the LC, Apple began encouraging developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorized salespersons to direct consumers away from Apple II and toward Macintosh.[63] The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993.[64]\n\n\nApple also experimented with several other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including digital cameras, portable CD audio players, speakers, video game consoles, the eWorld online service, and TV appliances. Enormous resources were invested in the problem-plagued Newton tablet division, based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.[65]\n\n\nThroughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.[66] Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; instead, they sued Microsoft for using a GUI similar to the Apple Lisa in *Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.*[67] The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed.\n\n\nThe major product flops and the rapid loss of market share to Windows sullied Apple's reputation, and in 1993 Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler.[68]\n\n\nWith Spindler at the helm, Apple, IBM, and Motorola formed the AIM alliance in 1994 with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the PowerPC Reference Platform; PReP), which used IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows. That year, Apple introduced the Power Macintosh, the first of many computers with Motorola's PowerPC processor.[69]\n\n\nIn the wake of the alliance, Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build Macintosh clones. Over the next two years, 75 distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced. However, by 1996, Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of their own high-end computers, where profit margins were highest.[70]\n\n\nIn 1996, Spindler was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO. Hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator, Amelio made deep changes, including extensive layoffs and cost-cutting.[71]\n\n\nThis period was also marked by numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system (MacOS). The original Macintosh operating system (System 1) was not built for multitasking (running several applications at once). The company attempted to correct this with by introducing cooperative multitasking in System 5, but the company still felt it needed a more modern approach.[72] This led to the Pink project in 1988, A/UX that same year, Copland in 1994, and the attempted purchase of BeOS in 1996. Talks with Be stalled when the CEO, former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée, demanded $300 million instead of the $125 million Apple wanted to pay.[73]\n\n\nOnly weeks away from bankruptcy,[74] Apple's board decided NeXTSTEP was a better choice for its next operating system and purchased NeXT in late 1996 for $400 million, bringing back Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.[75]\n\n\n\n### 1997–2007: Return to profitability[edit]\n\n\nThe NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9, 1997,[76] and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio's resignation after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses.\n\n\nThe board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately began a review of the company's products. Jobs would order 70% of the company's products to be cancelled, resulting in the loss of 3,000 jobs, and taking Apple back to the core of its computer offerings.[77] The next month, in August 1997, Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a $150 million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing software for the Mac.[78] The investment was seen as an \"antitrust insurance policy\" for Microsoft who had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti-competitive practices.[79] Jobs also ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997, purchased the largest clone maker, Power Computing.[80] On November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the Apple Store website, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing that had been successfully used by PC manufacturer Dell.[81]\n\n\nThe moves paid off for Jobs; at the end of his first year as CEO, the company turned a $309 million profit.[77]\n\n\n\n![](image)\niMac\n![](image)\niBook\n![](image)\nPower Macintosh G3\n![](image)\nPowerBook G3\n\nOn May 6, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh: the iMac. The iMac was a huge success for Apple selling 800,000 units in its first five months[82] and ushered in major shifts in the industry by abandoning legacy technologies like the 3+1⁄2-inch diskette, being an early adopter of the USB connector, and coming pre-installed with internet connectivity (the \"i\" in iMac)[83] via Ethernet and a dial-up modem. The device also had a striking teardrop shape and translucent materials, designed by Jonathan Ive, who although hired by Amelio, would go on to work collaboratively with Jobs for the next decade to chart a new course the design of Apple's products.[84][85]\n\n\nA little more than a year later on July 21, 1999, Apple introduced the iBook, a laptop for consumers. It was the culmination of a strategy established by Jobs to produce only four products: refined versions of the Power Macintosh G3 desktop and PowerBook G3 laptop for professionals, along with the iMac desktop and iBook laptop for consumers. Jobs felt the small product line allowed for a greater focus on quality and innovation.[86]\n\n\nAt around the same time, Apple also completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital media production software for both professionals and consumers. Apple acquired of Macromedia's Key Grip digital video editing software project which was renamed Final Cut Pro when it was launched on the retail market in April 1999.[87] The development of Key Grip also led to Apple's release of the consumer video-editing product iMovie in October 1999.[88] Next, Apple successfully acquired the German company Astarte in April 2000, which had developed the DVD authoring software DVDirector, which Apple would sell as the professional-oriented DVD Studio Pro software product, and used the same technology to create iDVD for the consumer market.[88] In 2000, Apple purchased the SoundJam MP audio player software from Casady & Greene. Apple renamed the program iTunes, while simplifying the user interface and adding the ability to burn CDs.[89]\n\n\n2001 would be a pivotal year for the Apple with the company making three announcements that would change the course of the company.\n\n\nThe first announcement came on March 24, 2001, that Apple was nearly ready to release a new modern operating system, Mac OS X. The announcement came after numerous failed attempts in the early 1990s, and several years of development. Mac OS X was based on NeXTSTEP, OPENSTEP, and BSD Unix, with Apple aiming to combine the stability, reliability, and security of Unix with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface, heavily influenced by NeXTSTEP. To aid users in migrating from Mac OS 9, the new operating system allowed the use of OS 9 applications within Mac OS X via the Classic Environment.[90]\n\n\nIn May 2001, the company opened its first two Apple Store retail locations in Virginia and California,[91][92] offering an improved presentation of the company's products.[93] At the time, many speculated that the stores would fail,[94] but they went on to become highly successful, and the first of more than 500 stores around the world.[95]\n\n\nOn October 23, 2001, Apple debuted the iPod portable digital audio player. The product, which was first sold on November 10, 2001, was phenomenally successful with over 100 million units sold within six years.[96]\n\n\nIn 2003, Apple's iTunes Store was introduced. The service offered music downloads for 99¢ a song and integration with the iPod. The iTunes Store quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over five billion downloads by June 19, 2008.[97] Two years later, the iTunes Store was the world's largest music retailer.[98]\n\n\nIn 2002, Apple purchased Nothing Real for their advanced digital compositing application Shake,[99] as well as Emagic for the music productivity application Logic. The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company. The acquisition was followed by the development of Apple's consumer-level GarageBand application.[100] The release of iPhoto that year completed the iLife suite.[101]\n\n\n\n![](image)The MacBook Pro is Apple's first laptop with an Intel microprocessor, introduced in 2006.\nAt the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would move away from PowerPC processors, and the Mac would transition to Intel processors in 2006.[102] On January 10, 2006, the new MacBook Pro and iMac became the first Apple computers to use Intel's Core Duo CPU. By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line—over one year sooner than announced.[102] The Power Mac, iBook, and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the Mac Pro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro became their respective successors.[103] On April 29, 2009, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple was building its own team of engineers to design microchips.[104] Apple also introduced Boot Camp in 2006 to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.[105]\n\n\nApple's success during this period was evident in its stock price. Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple's stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80.[106] When Apple surpassed Dell's market cap in January 2006,[107] Jobs sent an email to Apple employees saying Dell's CEO Michael Dell should eat his words.[108] Nine years prior, Dell had said that if he ran Apple he would \"shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders\".[109]\n\n\n\n### 2007–2011: Success with mobile devices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The newly announced iPhone was on display at the 2007 MacWorld Expo.\nDuring his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced the renaming of Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple Inc., because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics.[110] This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone[111] and the Apple TV.[112] The company sold 270,000 iPhone units during the first 30 hours of sales,[113] and the device was called \"a game changer for the industry\".[114]\n\n\nIn an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without digital rights management (DRM), thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players if record labels would agree to drop the technology.[115] On April 2, 2007, Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.[116] Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce that all songs on the iTunes Store are available without their FairPlay DRM.[117]\n\n\nIn July 2008, Apple launched the App Store to sell third-party applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch.[118] Within a month, the store sold 60 million applications and registered an average daily revenue of $1 million, with Jobs speculating in August 2008 that the App Store could become a billion-dollar business for Apple.[119] By October 2008, Apple was the third-largest mobile handset supplier in the world due to the popularity of the iPhone.[120]\n\n\nOn January 14, 2009, Jobs announced in an internal memo that he would be taking a six-month medical leave of absence from Apple until the end of June 2009 and would spend the time focusing on his health. In the email, Jobs stated that \"the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well\", and explained that the break would allow the company \"to focus on delivering extraordinary products\".[121] Though Jobs was absent, Apple recorded its best non-holiday quarter (Q1 FY 2009) during the recession with revenue of $8.16 billion and profit of $1.21 billion.[122]\n\n\nAfter years of speculation and multiple rumored \"leaks\", Apple unveiled a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the iPad on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and all iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, though having very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the U.S. It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week.[123] In May of the same year, Apple's market cap exceeded that of competitor Microsoft for the first time since 1989.[124]\n\n\nIn June 2010, Apple released the iPhone 4,[125] which introduced video calling using FaceTime, multitasking, and a new uninsulated stainless steel design that acted as the phone's antenna. Later that year, Apple again refreshed its iPod line of MP3 players by introducing a multi-touch iPod Nano, an iPod Touch with FaceTime, and an iPod Shuffle that brought back the clickwheel buttons of earlier generations.[126] It also introduced the smaller, cheaper second generation Apple TV which allowed renting of movies and shows.[127]\n\n\nOn January 17, 2011, Jobs announced in an internal Apple memo that he would take another medical leave of absence for an indefinite period to allow him to focus on his health. Chief operating officer Tim Cook assumed Jobs's day-to-day operations at Apple, although Jobs would still remain \"involved in major strategic decisions\".[128] Apple became the most valuable consumer-facing brand in the world.[129] In June 2011, Jobs surprisingly took the stage and unveiled iCloud, an online storage and syncing service for music, photos, files, and software which replaced MobileMe, Apple's previous attempt at content syncing.[130] This would be the last product launch Jobs would attend before his death.\n\n\nOn August 24, 2011, Jobs resigned his position as CEO of Apple.[131] He was replaced by Cook and Jobs became Apple's chairman. Apple did not have a chairman at the time[132] and instead had two co-lead directors, Andrea Jung and Arthur D. Levinson,[133] who continued with those titles until Levinson replaced Jobs as chairman of the board in November after Jobs' death.[134]\n\n\n\n### 2011–present: Post-Jobs era, Tim Cook[edit]\n\n\nOn October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs died, marking the end of an era for Apple.[135] The next major product announcement by Apple was on January 19, 2012, when Apple's Phil Schiller introduced iBook's Textbooks for iOS and iBook Author for Mac OS X in New York City.[136] Jobs stated in the biography \"Steve Jobs\" that he wanted to reinvent the textbook industry and education.[137]\n\n\nFrom 2011 to 2012, Apple released the iPhone 4S[138] and iPhone 5,[139] which featured improved cameras, an intelligent software assistant named Siri, and cloud-synced data with iCloud; the third- and fourth-generation iPads, which featured Retina displays;[140][141] and the iPad Mini, which featured a 7.9-inch screen in contrast to the iPad's 9.7-inch screen.[142] These launches were successful, with the iPhone 5 (released September 21, 2012) becoming Apple's biggest iPhone launch with over two million pre-orders[143] and sales of three million iPads in three days following the launch of the iPad Mini and fourth-generation iPad (released November 3, 2012).[144] Apple also released a third-generation 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display and new iMac and Mac Mini computers.[141][142][145]\n\n\nOn August 20, 2012, Apple's rising stock price increased the company's market capitalization to a then-record $624 billion. This beat the non-inflation-adjusted record for market capitalization previously set by Microsoft in 1999.[146] On August 24, 2012, a US jury ruled that Samsung should pay Apple $1.05 billion (£665m) in damages in an intellectual property lawsuit.[147] Samsung appealed the damages award, which was reduced by $450 million[148] and further granted Samsung's request for a new trial.[148] On November 10, 2012, Apple confirmed a global settlement that dismissed all existing lawsuits between Apple and HTC up to that date, in favor of a ten-year license agreement for current and future patents between the two companies.[149] It is predicted that Apple will make $280 million per year from this deal with HTC.[150]\n\n\nIn May 2014, the company confirmed its intent to acquire Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine's audio company Beats Electronics—producer of the \"Beats by Dr. Dre\" line of headphones and speaker products, and operator of the music streaming service Beats Music—for $3 billion, and to sell their products through Apple's retail outlets and resellers. Iovine believed that Beats had always \"belonged\" with Apple, as the company modeled itself after Apple's \"unmatched ability to marry culture and technology.\" The acquisition was the largest purchase in Apple's history.[151]\n\n\n\n![](image)Apple Watch first generation (2015)\nDuring a press event on September 9, 2014, Apple introduced a smartwatch, the Apple Watch.[152] Initially, Apple marketed the device as a fashion accessory[153] and a complement to the iPhone, that would allow people to look at their smartphones less.[154] Over time, the company has focused on developing health and fitness-oriented features on the watch, in an effort to compete with dedicated activity trackers.\n\n\nIn January 2016, it was announced that one billion Apple devices were in active use worldwide.[155]\n\n\nOn June 6, 2016, *Fortune* released Fortune 500, its list of companies ranked on revenue generation. In the trailing fiscal year of 2015, Apple was listed as the top tech company.[156] It ranked third, overall, with $233 billion in revenue.[156] This represents a movement upward of two spots from the previous year's list.[156]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Apple announced the HomePod, its smart speaker aimed to compete against Sonos, Google Home, and Amazon Echo.[157] Towards the end of the year, *TechCrunch* reported that Apple was acquiring Shazam, a company that introduced its products at WWDC and specializing in music, TV, film and advertising recognition.[158] The acquisition was confirmed a few days later, reportedly costing Apple $400 million, with media reports that the purchase looked like a move to acquire data and tools bolstering the Apple Music streaming service.[159] The purchase was approved by the European Union in September 2018.[160]\n\n\nAlso in June 2017, Apple appointed Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg to head the newly formed worldwide video unit. In November 2017, Apple announced it was branching out into original scripted programming: a drama series starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, and a reboot of the anthology series Amazing Stories with Steven Spielberg.[161] In June 2018, Apple signed the Writers Guild of America's minimum basic agreement and Oprah Winfrey to a multi-year content partnership.[162] Additional partnerships for original series include Sesame Workshop and DHX Media and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide, as well as a partnership with A24 to create original films.[163]\n\n\nDuring the Apple Special Event in September 2017, the AirPower wireless charger was announced alongside the iPhone X, 8 and Watch Series 3. The AirPower was intended to wirelessly charge multiple devices, simultaneously. Though initially set to release in early 2018, the AirPower would be canceled in March 2019, marking the first cancellation of a device under Cook's leadership.[164]\n\n\nOn August 19, 2020, Apple's share price briefly topped $467.77, making it the first US company with a market capitalization of $2 trillion.[165]\n\n\n\n![](image)MacBook Air M1 (2020)\nDuring its annual WWDC keynote speech on June 22, 2020, Apple announced it would move away from Intel processors, and the Mac would transition to processors developed in-house.[166] The announcement was expected by industry analysts, and it has been noted that Macs featuring Apple's processors would allow for big increases in performance over current Intel-based models.[167] On November 10, 2020, the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and the Mac Mini became the first Mac devices powered by an Apple-designed processor, the Apple M1.[168]\n\n\nIn April 2022, it was reported that Samsung Electro-Mechanics would be collaborating with Apple on its M2 chip instead of LG Innotek.[169] Developer logs showed that at least nine Mac models with four different M2 chips were being tested.[170]\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that an effort to develop its own chips left Apple better prepared to deal with the semiconductor shortage that emerged during the pandemic era and led to increased profitability, with sales of Mac computers that included M1 chips rising sharply in 2020 and 2021. It also inspired other companies like Tesla, Amazon, and Meta Platforms to pursue a similar path.[171]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Apple opened an online store that allowed anyone in the US to view repair manuals and order replacement parts for specific recent iPhones, although the difference in cost between this method and official repair is anticipated to be minimal.[172]\n\n\nIn May 2022, a trademark was filed for RealityOS, an operating system reportedly intended for virtual and augmented reality headsets, first mentioned in 2017. According to Bloomberg, the headset may come out in 2023.[173] Further insider reports state that the device uses iris scanning for payment confirmation and signing into accounts.[174]\n\n\nOn June 18, 2022, the Apple Store in Towson, Maryland became the first to unionize in the U.S., with the employees voting to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.[175]\n\n\nOn July 7, 2022, Apple added Lockdown Mode to macOS 13 and iOS 16, as a response to the earlier Pegasus revelations; the mode increases security protections for high-risk users against targeted zero-day malware.[176]\n\n\nApple launched a buy now, pay later service called 'Apple Pay Later' for its Apple Wallet users in March 2023. The program allows its users to apply for loans between $50 and $1,000 to make online or in-app purchases and then repaying them through four installments spread over six weeks without any interest or fees.[177][178]\n\n\n\n## Products[edit]\n\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Apple Inc. products.\n\n### Mac[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac (computer)\n![A MacBook Air, in midnight color, on a wooden desk.](image)\nMacBook Air with M2 chip\n![An thin iMac in blue color on a desk.](image)\niMac with M1 chip\n\nThe Mac is Apple's family of personal computers. Macs are known for their ease of use[179] and distinctive aluminium, minimalist designs. Macs have been popular among students, creative professionals, and software engineers. The current lineup consists of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops, and the iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio and Mac Pro desktop computers.\n\n\nOften described as a walled garden, Macs use Apple silicon chips, run the macOS operating system, and include Apple software like the Safari web browser, iMovie for home movie editing, GarageBand for music creation, and the iWork productivity suite. Apple also sells pro apps: Final Cut Pro for video production, Logic Pro for musicians and producers, and Xcode for software developers.\n\n\nApple also sells a variety of accessories for Macs, including the Pro Display XDR, Apple Studio Display, Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard.\n\n\n\n### iPhone[edit]\n\n\nMain article: iPhone\n\n![An iPhone 14 Pro with Chinese user interface, held by a customer, screen facing the camera](image)iPhone 14 Pro\nThe iPhone is Apple's line of smartphones, which run the iOS operating system. The first iPhone was unveiled by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, new models have been released annually. When it was introduced, its multi-touch screen was described as \"revolutionary\" and a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry. The device has been credited with creating the app economy.\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the iPhone has 15% market share, yet represents 50% of global smartphone revenues, with Android phones accounting for the rest.[180][181] The iPhone has generated large profits for the company, and is credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies.[182]\n\n\n\n### iPad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: iPad\n\nThe iPad is Apple's line of tablets which run iPadOS. The first-generation iPad was announced on January 27, 2010. The iPad is mainly marketed for consuming multimedia, creating art, working on documents, videoconferencing, and playing games. The iPad lineup consists of several base iPad models, and the smaller iPad Mini, upgraded iPad Air, and high-end iPad Pro. Apple has consistently improved the iPad's performance, with the iPad Pro adopting the same M1 and M2 chips as the Mac; but the iPad still receives criticism for its limited OS.[183][184]\n\n\nAs of September 2020,[update] Apple has sold more than 500 million iPads, though sales peaked in 2013.[185] The iPad still remains the most popular tablet computer by sales as of the second quarter of 2020[update],[186] and accounted for nine percent of the company's revenue as of the end of 2021[update].[1]\n\n\nApple sells several iPad accessories, including the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, Smart Keyboard Folio, Magic Keyboard, and several adapters.\n\n\n\n### Other products[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nAirPods Max\n![](image)\nApple Watch Ultra\n\nApple makes several other products that it categorizes as \"Wearables, Home and Accessories\".[187] These products include the AirPods line of wireless headphones, Apple TV digital media players, Apple Watch smartwatches, Beats headphones and HomePod Mini smart speakers.\n\n\nAs of the end of 2021[update], this broad line of products comprises about 11% of the company's revenues.[1]\n\n\nAt WWDC 2023, Apple introduced its new VR headset, Vision Pro, along with visionOS.[188] Apple announced that it will be partnering with Unity to bring existing 3D apps to Vision Pro using Unity's PolySpatial technology.[189][190][191][192]\n\n\n\n### Services[edit]\n\n\nApple offers a broad line of services, including advertising in the App Store and Apple News app, the AppleCare+ extended warranty plan, the iCloud+ cloud-based data storage service, payment services through the Apple Card credit card and the Apple Pay processing platform, digital content services including Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+, and the iTunes Store.\n\n\nAs of the end of 2021[update], services comprise about 19% of the company's revenue.[1] Many of the services have been launched as of 2019[update] when Apple announced it would be making a concerted effort to expand its service revenues.[193]\n\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Marketing of Apple Inc.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Marketing of Apple Inc..** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Branding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first official logo of Apple Inc. was used from 1977 to 1998.[194]\nAccording to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet. Jobs thought the name \"Apple\" was \"fun, spirited and not intimidating\".[195] Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were fans of the Beatles,[196] but Apple Inc. had name and logo trademark issues with Apple Corps Ltd., a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1968. This resulted in a series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies. These issues ended with the settling of their lawsuit in 2007.[197]\n\n\nApple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's \"rainbow Apple\", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it.[198] On August 27, 1999,[199] Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation.[200]\n\n\nApple evangelists were actively engaged by the company at one time, but this was after the phenomenon had already been firmly established. Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism \"something that was stumbled upon,\"[201] while Ive claimed in 2014 that \"people have an incredibly personal relationship\" with Apple's products.[84]\n\n\n*Fortune* magazine named Apple the most admired company in the United States in 2008, and in the world from 2008 to 2012.[202] On September 30, 2013, Apple surpassed Coca-Cola to become the world's most valuable brand in the Omnicom Group's \"Best Global Brands\" report.[203] Boston Consulting Group has ranked Apple as the world's most innovative brand every year as of 2005[update].[204]\n\n\nAs of January 2021,[update] 1.65 billion Apple products were in active use.[205][206] In February 2023 that number exceeded 2 billion devices.[207][208]\n\n\n\n### Advertising[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple Inc. advertising\n\nApple's first slogan, \"Byte into an Apple\", was coined in the late 1970s.[209] From 1997 to 2002, the slogan \"Think different\" was used in advertising campaigns, and is still closely associated with Apple.[210] Apple also has slogans for specific product lines—for example, \"iThink, therefore iMac\" was used in 1998 to promote the iMac,[211] and \"Say hello to iPhone\" has been used in iPhone advertisements.[212] \"Hello\" was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, Newton, iMac (\"hello (again)\"), and iPod.[213]\n\n\nFrom the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, with the 1984 Super Bowl advertisement to the more modern Get a Mac adverts, Apple has been recognized for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products. However, claims made by later campaigns were criticized,[214] particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads.[215] Apple's product advertisements gained significant attention as a result of their eye-popping graphics and catchy tunes.[216] Musicians who benefited from an improved profile as a result of their songs being included on Apple advertisements include Canadian singer Feist with the song \"1234\" and Yael Naïm with the song \"New Soul\".[216]\n\n\n\n### Stores[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple Store\n\n![](image)Apple Fifth Avenue is the flagship store in New York City.\n![](image)A Genius Bar is at Apple's Regent Street store in London.\nThe first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs,[91] after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts.[93] Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers, and hired Ron Johnson in 2000.[93] Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997,[217] and opened the first two physical stores in 2001.[91] The media initially speculated that Apple would fail,[94] but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so.[94]\n\n\nOver the years, Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage, with 499 stores across 22 countries worldwide as of December 2017[update].[95] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.[218] Apple Stores underwent a period of significant redesign, beginning in May 2016. This redesign included physical changes to the Apple Stores, such as open spaces and re-branded rooms, as well as changes in function to facilitate interaction between consumers and professionals.[219]\n\n\nMany Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has built several stand-alone \"flagship\" stores in high-profile locations.[93] It has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores' designs and construction, specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes.[220] The success of Apple Stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers, who have lost traffic, control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores.[221] Due to the popularity of the brand, Apple receives a large number of job applications, many of which come from young workers.[218] Although Apple Store employees receive above-average pay, are offered money toward education and health care, and receive product discounts,[218] there are limited or no paths of career advancement.[218]\n\n\n\n### Market power[edit]\n\n\nOn March 16, 2020, France fined Apple €1.1 billion for colluding with two wholesalers to stifle competition and keep prices high by handicapping independent resellers. The arrangement created aligned prices for Apple products such as iPads and personal computers for about half the French retail market. According to the French regulators, the abuses occurred between 2005 and 2017 but were first discovered after a complaint by an independent reseller, eBizcuss, in 2012.[222]\n\n\nOn August 13, 2020, Epic Games, the maker of the popular game *Fortnite*, sued Apple and Google after its hugely popular video game was removed from Apple and Google's App Store. The suits came after both Apple and Google blocked the game after it introduced a direct payment system, effectively shutting out the tech titans from collecting fees.[223] In September 2020, Epic Games founded the Coalition for App Fairness together with thirteen other companies, which aims for better conditions for the inclusion of apps in the app stores.[224] Later, in December 2020, Facebook agreed to assist Epic in their legal game against Apple, planning to support the company by providing materials and documents to Epic. Facebook had, however, stated that the company would not participate directly with the lawsuit, although did commit to helping with the discovery of evidence relating to the trial of 2021. In the months prior to their agreement, Facebook had been dealing with feuds against Apple relating to the prices of paid apps as well as privacy rule changes.[225] Head of ad products for Facebook Dan Levy commented, saying that \"this is not really about privacy for them, this is about an attack on personalized ads and the consequences it's going to have on small-business owners,\" commenting on the full-page ads placed by Facebook in various newspapers in December 2020.[226]\n\n\n\n### Customer privacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)PRISM: a clandestine surveillance program under which the NSA collects user data from companies like Facebook and Apple[227]\nApple has a pro-privacy stance, actively making privacy-conscious features and settings part of its conferences, promotional campaigns, and public image.[228] With its iOS 8 mobile operating system in 2014, the company started encrypting all contents of iOS devices through users' passcodes, making it impossible at the time for the company to provide customer data to law enforcement requests seeking such information.[229] With the popularity rise of cloud storage solutions, Apple began a technique in 2016 to do deep learning scans for facial data in photos on the user's local device and encrypting the content before uploading it to Apple's iCloud storage system.[230] It also introduced \"differential privacy\", a way to collect crowdsourced data from many users, while keeping individual users anonymous, in a system that *Wired* described as \"trying to learn as much as possible about a group while learning as little as possible about any individual in it\".[231] Users are explicitly asked if they want to participate, and can actively opt-in or opt-out.[232]\n\n\nWith Apple's release of an update to iOS 14, Apple required all developers of iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch applications to directly ask iPhone users permission to track them. The feature, titled \"App Tracking Transparency\", received heavy criticism from Facebook, whose primary business model revolves around the tracking of users' data and sharing such data with advertisers so users can see more relevant ads, a technique commonly known as targeted advertising. Despite Facebook's measures, including purchasing full-page newspaper advertisements protesting App Tracking Transparency, Apple released the update in mid-spring 2021. A study by Verizon subsidiary Flurry Analytics reported only 4% of iOS users in the United States and 12% worldwide have opted into tracking.[233]\n\n\nHowever, Apple aids law enforcement in criminal investigations by providing iCloud backups of users' devices,[234] and the company's commitment to privacy has been questioned by its efforts to promote biometric authentication technology in its newer iPhone models, which do not have the same level of constitutional privacy as a passcode in the United States.[235]\n\n\nPrior to the release of iOS 15, Apple announced new efforts at combating child sexual abuse material on iOS and Mac platforms. Parents of minor iMessage users can now be alerted if their child sends or receives nude photographs. Additionally, on-device hashing would take place on media destined for upload to iCloud, and hashes would be compared to a list of known abusive images provided by law enforcement; if enough matches were found, Apple would be alerted and authorities informed. The new features received praise from law enforcement and victims rights advocates, however privacy advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, condemned the new features as invasive and highly prone to abuse by authoritarian governments.[236]\n\n\nIreland's Data Protection Commission launched a privacy investigation to examine whether Apple complied with the EU's GDPR law following an investigation into how the company processes personal data with targeted ads on its platform.[237]\n\n\nIn December 2019, a report found that the iPhone 11 Pro continues tracking location and collecting user data even after users have disabled location services. In response, an Apple engineer said the Location Services icon \"appears for system services that do not have a switch in settings.\"[238]\n\n\nAccording to published reports by Bloomberg News on March 30, 2022, Apple turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, an Apple representative referred the reporter to a section of the company policy for law enforcement guidelines, which stated, \"We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.\"[239]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple, Braeburn Capital, and FileMaker\n\n### Business trends[edit]\n\n\nThe key trends for Apple are (as of the financial year ending September 24):[240][241]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | 2011\n | 2012\n | 2013\n | 2014\n | 2015\n | 2016\n | 2017\n | 2018\n | 2019\n | 2020\n | 2021\n | 2022\n | 2023\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue figures\n |\n| Total revenue (US$ b)[242] | 108\n | 156\n | 170\n | 182\n | 233\n | 215\n | 229\n | 265\n | 260\n | 274\n | 365\n | 394\n | 383\n |\n| - iPhone revenue (US$ b)\n | 45.9\n | 78.6\n | 91.2\n | 101\n | 155\n | 136\n | 139\n | 164\n | 142\n | 137\n | 191\n | 205\n | 200\n |\n| - Mac revenue (US$ b)\n | 21.7\n | 23.2\n | 21.4\n | 24.0\n | 25.4\n | 22.8\n | 25.5\n | 25.1\n | 25.7\n | 28.6\n | 35.1\n | 40.1\n | 29.3\n |\n| - iPad revenue (US$ b)\n | 19.1\n | 30.9\n | 31.9\n | 30.2\n | 23.2\n | 20.6\n | 18.8\n | 18.3\n | 21.2\n | 23.7\n | 31.8\n | 29.2\n | 28.3\n |\n| - Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue (US$ b)\n | 11.9\n | 10.7\n | 10.1\n | 8.3\n | 10.0\n | 11.1\n | 12.8\n | 17.3\n | 24.4\n | 30.6\n | 38.3\n | 41.2\n | 39.8\n |\n| - Services revenue (US$ b)\n | 9.3\n | 12.8\n | 16.0\n | 18.0\n | 19.9\n | 24.3\n | 32.7\n | 39.7\n | 46.2\n | 53.7\n | 68.4\n | 78.1\n | 85.2\n |\n| Non-revenue figures\n |\n| Net profit (US$ b)[243] | 25.9\n | 41.7\n | 37.0\n | 39.5\n | 53.3\n | 45.6\n | 48.3\n | 59.3\n | 55.2\n | 57.4\n | 94.6\n | 99.8\n | 96.9\n |\n| Number of employees (k, FTE)\n | 60.4\n | 72.8\n | 80.3\n | 92.6\n | 110\n | 116\n | 123\n | 132\n | 137\n | 147\n | 154\n | 164\n | 161\n |\n| References | [244] | [245] | [246] | [247] | [248] | [249] | [250] | [251] | [252] | [253] | [254] | [255] | [256] |\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\n#### Senior management[edit]\n\n\nAs of March 16, 2021[update], the management of Apple Inc. includes:[257]\n\n\n\n* Tim Cook (chief executive officer)\n* Jeff Williams (chief operating officer)\n* Luca Maestri (senior vice president and chief financial officer)\n* Katherine L.

Steve Jobs (1997–2011)\n\n\n### Corporate culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Co-founder Steve Wozniak and engineer Andy Hertzfeld attended the Apple User Group Connection club in 1985.\n![](image)Universities with the most alumni at Apple\nApple is one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture. Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[258] According to a 2011 report in *Fortune*, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[259] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching *Star Trek* and attending *Star Trek* conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[260]\n\n\nAs the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often took longer than others.[261]\n\n\nThe Apple Fellows program awards employees for extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing. Recipients include Bill Atkinson,[262] Steve Capps,[263] Rod Holt,[262] Alan Kay,[264][265] Guy Kawasaki,[264][266] Al Alcorn,[267] Don Norman,[264] Rich Page,[262] Steve Wozniak,[262] and Phil Schiller.[268]\n\n\nAt Apple, employees are intended to be specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise.[*needs update*] Jobs saw this as a means of having \"best-in-class\" employees in every role. For instance, Ron Johnson—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores. This was done by Tim Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management.[269] Apple is known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a \"directly responsible individual\" or \"DRI\" in Apple jargon.[259][270] As an example, when iOS senior vice president Scott Forstall refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned Maps app, he was forced to resign.[271] Unlike other major U.S. companies, Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.[272]\n\n\nIn 2015, Apple had 110,000 full-time employees. This increased to 116,000 full-time employees the next year, a notable hiring decrease, largely due to its first revenue decline. Apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail, though its 2014 SEC filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base.[273] In September 2017, Apple announced that it had over 123,000 full-time employees.[274]\n\n\nApple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy, and has an anti-leak Global Security team that recruits from the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Secret Service.[275]\n\n\nIn December 2017, Glassdoor said Apple was the 48th best place to work, having originally entered at rank 19 in 2009, peaking at rank 10 in 2012, and falling down the ranks in subsequent years.[276]\n\n\nIn 2023, *Bloomberg*'s Mark Gurman revealed the existence of Apple's Exploratory Design Group (XDG), which was working to add glucose monitoring to the Apple Watch. Gurman compared XDG to Alphabet's X \"moonshot factory\".[277]\n\n\n\n### Offices[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Apple Park and Apple Campus\n\n![](image)Apple Park is the main headquarters in Cupertino.\nApple Inc.'s world corporate headquarters are located in Cupertino, in the middle of California's Silicon Valley, at Apple Park, a massive circular groundscraper building with a circumference of one mile (1.6 km). The building opened in April 2017 and houses more than 12,000 employees. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs wanted Apple Park to look less like a business park and more like a nature refuge, and personally appeared before the Cupertino City Council in June 2011 to make the proposal, in his final public appearance before his death.\n\n\n\n![](image)The original Apple Campus has the street address 1 Infinite Loop, Sunnyvale, California.\nApple also operates from the Apple Campus (also known by its address, 1 Infinite Loop), a grouping of six buildings in Cupertino that total 850,000 square feet (79,000 m2) located about 1 mile (1.6 km) to the west of Apple Park.[278] The Apple Campus was the company's headquarters from its opening in 1993, until the opening of Apple Park in 2017. The buildings, located at 1–6 Infinite Loop, are arranged in a circular pattern around a central green space, in a design that has been compared to that of a university.\n\n\nIn addition to Apple Park and the Apple Campus, Apple occupies an additional thirty office buildings scattered throughout the city of Cupertino, including three buildings as prior headquarters: Stephens Creek Three from 1977 to 1978, Bandley One from 1978 to 1982, and Mariani One from 1982 to 1993.[279] In total, Apple occupies almost 40% of the available office space in the city.[280]\n\n\nApple's headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are located in Cork in the south of Ireland, called the Hollyhill campus.[281] The facility, which opened in 1980, houses 5,500 people and was Apple's first location outside of the United States.[282] Apple's international sales and distribution arms operate out of the campus in Cork.[283]\n\n\nApple has two campuses near Austin, Texas: a 216,000-square-foot (20,100 m2) campus opened in 2014 houses 500 engineers who work on Apple silicon[284] and a 1.1-million-square-foot (100,000 m2) campus opened in 2021 where 6,000 people work in technical support, supply chain management, online store curation, and Apple Maps data management.\n\n\nThe company also has several other locations in Boulder, Colorado, Culver City, California, Herzliya (Israel), London, New York, Pittsburgh, San Diego, and Seattle that each employ hundreds of people.[285]\n\n\n\n### Litigation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Litigation involving Apple Inc.\n\nApple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.[286] In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include *Apple v. Samsung*, *Apple v. Microsoft*, *Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc.*, and *Apple Corps v. Apple Computer*. Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights. Most have been dismissed in the courts as shell companies known as patent trolls, with no evidence of actual use of patents in question.[287] On December 21, 2016, Nokia announced that in the U.S. and Germany, it has filed a suit against Apple, claiming that the latter's products infringe on Nokia's patents.[288] Most recently, in November 2017, the United States International Trade Commission announced an investigation into allegations of patent infringement in regards to Apple's remote desktop technology; Aqua Connect, a company that builds remote desktop software, has claimed that Apple infringed on two of its patents.[289] In January 2022, Ericsson sued Apple over payment of royalty of 5G technology.[290]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple\n\nApple is the world's largest technology company by revenue, the world's largest technology company by total assets,[291] and the world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer after Samsung.[292]\n\n\nIn its fiscal year ending in September 2011, Apple Inc. reported a total of $108 billion in annual revenues—a significant increase from its 2010 revenues of $65 billion—and nearly $82 billion in cash reserves.[293] On March 19, 2012, Apple announced plans for a $2.65-per-share dividend beginning in fourth quarter of 2012, per approval by their board of directors.[294]\n\n\nThe company's worldwide annual revenue in 2013 totaled $170 billion.[295] In May 2013, Apple entered the top ten of the *Fortune* 500 list of companies for the first time, rising 11 places above its 2012 ranking to take the sixth position.[296] As of 2016[update], Apple has around US$234 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which 90% is located outside the United States for tax purposes.[297]\n\n\nApple amassed 65% of all profits made by the eight largest worldwide smartphone manufacturers in quarter one of 2014, according to a report by Canaccord Genuity. In the first quarter of 2015, the company garnered 92% of all earnings.[298]\n\n\nOn April 30, 2017, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple had cash reserves of $250 billion,[299] officially confirmed by Apple as specifically $256.8 billion a few days later.[300]\n\n\nAs of August 3, 2018[update], Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization. On August 2, 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to reach a $1 trillion market value.[301][302] Apple was ranked No. 4 on the 2018 *Fortune* 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[303]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Apple reported an 11% decline in Q3 profits compared to 2021. Its revenue in the same period rose 2% year-on-year to $83 billion, though this figure was also lower than in 2021, where the increase was at 36%. The general downturn is reportedly caused by the slowing global economy and supply chain disruptions in China.[304]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Apple reported a decline in its sales for the first quarter of 2023. Compared to that of 2022, revenue for 2023 fell by 3%. This is Apple's second consecutive quarter of sales decline. This fall is attributed to the slowing economy and consumers putting off purchases of iPads and computers due to increased pricing. However, iPhone sales held up with a year-on-year increase of 1.5%. According to Apple, demands for such devices were strong, particularly in Latin America and South Asia.[305]\n\n\n\n### Taxes[edit]\n\n\nApple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the British Virgin Islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to *The New York Times*, in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the \"Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich\", which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.[306][307]\n\n\nBritish Conservative Party Member of Parliament Charlie Elphicke published research on October 30, 2012,[308] which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard corporate tax rates. He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals, which also included Google and The Coca-Cola Company, to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.[309]\n\n\nAccording to a US Senate report on the company's offshore tax structure concluded in May 2013, Apple has held billions of dollars in profits in Irish subsidiaries to pay little or no taxes to any government by using an unusual global tax structure.[310] The main subsidiary, a holding company that includes Apple's retail stores throughout Europe, has not paid any corporate income tax in the last five years. \"Apple has exploited a difference between Irish and U.S. tax residency rules\", the report said.[311]\n\n\nOn May 21, 2013, Apple CEO Tim Cook defended his company's tax tactics at a Senate hearing.[312]\n\n\nApple says that it is the single largest taxpayer in the U.S., with an effective tax rate of approximately of 26% as of Q2 FY2016.[313] In an interview with the German newspaper *FAZ* in October 2017, Tim Cook stated that Apple was the biggest taxpayer worldwide.[314]\n\n\nIn 2016, after a two-year investigation, the European Commission claimed that Apple's use of a hybrid Double Irish tax arrangement constituted \"illegal state aid\" from Ireland, and ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in unpaid taxes, the largest corporate tax fine in history. This was later annulled, after the European General Court ruled that the Commission had provided insufficient evidence.[315][316] In 2018, Apple repatriated $285 billion to America, resulting in a $38 billion tax payment spread over the following 8 years.[317]\n\n\n\n### Charity[edit]\n\n\nApple is a partner of (PRODUCT)RED, a fundraising campaign for AIDS charity. In November 2014, Apple arranged for all App Store revenue in a two-week period to go to the fundraiser,[318] generating more than US$20 million,[319] and in March 2017, it released an iPhone 7 with a red color finish.[320]\n\n\nApple contributes financially to fundraisers in times of natural disasters. In November 2012, it donated $2.5 million to the American Red Cross to aid relief efforts after Hurricane Sandy,[321] and in 2017 it donated $5 million to relief efforts for both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey,[322] as well as for the 2017 Central Mexico earthquake.[323] The company has also used its iTunes platform to encourage donations in the wake of environmental disasters and humanitarian crises, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake,[324] the 2011 Japan earthquake,[325] Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in November 2013,[326] and the 2015 European migrant crisis.[327] Apple emphasizes that it does not incur any processing or other fees for iTunes donations, sending 100% of the payments directly to relief efforts, though it also acknowledges that the Red Cross does not receive any personal information on the users donating and that the payments may not be tax deductible.[328]\n\n\nOn April 14, 2016, Apple and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) announced that they have engaged in a partnership to, \"help protect life on our planet.\" Apple released a special page in the iTunes App Store, Apps for Earth. In the arrangement, Apple has committed that through April 24, WWF will receive 100% of the proceeds from the applications participating in the App Store via both the purchases of any paid apps and the In-App Purchases. Apple and WWF's Apps for Earth campaign raised more than $8 million in total proceeds to support WWF's conservation work. WWF announced the results at WWDC 2016 in San Francisco.[329]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Apple's CEO Cook announced that the company will be donating \"millions\" of masks to health workers in the United States and Europe.[330]\n\n\nOn January 13, 2021, Apple announced a $100 million \"Racial Equity and Justice Initiative\" to help combat institutional racism worldwide.[331][332]\n\n\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environmental impact of Apple\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Environmental impact of Apple.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Apple Energy[edit]\n\n\nApple Energy, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple Inc. that sells solar energy. As of June 6, 2016[update], Apple's solar farms in California and Nevada have been declared to provide 217.9 megawatts of solar generation capacity.[333] In addition to the company's solar energy production, Apple has received regulatory approval to construct a landfill gas energy plant in North Carolina. Apple will use the methane emissions to generate electricity.[334] Apple's North Carolina data center is already powered entirely with energy from renewable sources.[335]\n\n\n\n### Energy and resources[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, Climate Counts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category \"Striding\".[336] This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a \"stuck icon\", adding that Apple at the time was \"a choice to avoid for the climate-conscious consumer\".[337]\n\n\nFollowing a Greenpeace protest, Apple released a statement on April 17, 2012, committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to 100% renewable clean energy.[338][339] By 2013, Apple was using 100% renewable energy to power their data centers. Overall, 75% of the company's power came from clean renewable sources.[340]\n\n\nIn May 2015, Greenpeace evaluated the state of the Green Internet and commended Apple on their environmental practices saying, \"Apple's commitment to renewable energy has helped set a new bar for the industry, illustrating in very concrete terms that a 100% renewable Internet is within its reach, and providing several models of intervention for other companies that want to build a sustainable Internet.\"[341]\n\n\nAs of 2016[update], Apple states that 100% of its U.S. operations run on renewable energy, 100% of Apple's data centers run on renewable energy and 93% of Apple's global operations run on renewable energy.[342] However, the facilities are connected to the local grid which usually contains a mix of fossil and renewable sources, so Apple carbon offsets its electricity use.[343] The Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) allows consumers to see the effect a product has on the environment. Each product receives a Gold, Silver, or Bronze rank depending on its efficiency and sustainability. Every Apple tablet, notebook, desktop computer, and display that EPEAT ranks achieves a Gold rating, the highest possible. Although Apple's data centers recycle water 35 times,[344] the increased activity in retail, corporate and data centers also increase the amount of water use to 573 million US gal (2.2 million m3) in 2015.[345]\n\n\nDuring an event on March 21, 2016, Apple provided a status update on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable in all of its worldwide operations. Lisa P. Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016[update], 93% of Apple's worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from post-consumer recycled paper or sustainably managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products.[346] Apple working in partnership with Conservation Fund, have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in Maine and North Carolina. Another partnership announced is with the World Wildlife Fund to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres (4,000 km2) of forests in China. Featured was the company's installation of a 40 MW solar power plant in the Sichuan province of China that was tailor-made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple's Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company's energy carbon footprint in the country. In Singapore, Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple's Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy. Liam was introduced to the world, an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter designed by Apple Engineers in California specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones. Reuses and recycles parts from traded in products.[347]\n\n\nApple announced on August 16, 2016, that Lens Technology, one of its major suppliers in China, has committed to power all its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by 2018. The commitment is a large step in Apple's efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint in China.[348] Apple also announced that all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL's Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The standard, which started in January 2015, certifies that all manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or converted into energy (when necessary). Since the program began, nearly 140,000 metric tons of waste have been diverted from landfills.[349]\n\n\nOn July 21, 2020, Apple announced its plan to become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. In the next 10 years, Apple will try to lower emissions with a series of innovative actions, including: low carbon product design, expanding energy efficiency, renewable energy, process and material innovations, and carbon removal.[350]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Apple said that it had started a $200 million fund in order to combat climate change by removing 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year.[351]\n\n\nIn February 2022, the NewClimate Institute, a German environmental policy think tank, published a survey evaluating the transparency and progress of the climate strategies and carbon neutrality pledges announced by 25 major companies in the United States that found that Apple's carbon neutrality pledge and climate strategy was unsubstantiated and misleading.[352][353]\n\n\n\n### Toxins[edit]\n\n\nFollowing further campaigns by Greenpeace,[354] in 2008, Apple became the first electronics manufacturer to eliminate all polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in its complete product line.[355] In June 2007, Apple began replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit LCD displays in its computers with mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass, starting with the upgraded MacBook Pro.[356][357][358][359] Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the CO2e, emissions, materials, and electrical usage concerning every product they currently produce or have sold in the past (and which they have enough data needed to produce the report), in their portfolio on their homepage. Allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions on the products they offer for sale.[360] In June 2009, Apple's iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, and BFRs.[356][361] All Apple products now have mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays, arsenic-free glass, and non-PVC cables. All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product's respective regulatory category.[356][362]\n\n\nIn November 2011, Apple was featured in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy policy, and how \"green\" their products are. The company ranked fourth of fifteen electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10.[363] Greenpeace praised Apple's sustainability, noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. Apple continues to score well on product ratings, with all of their products now being free of PVC plastic and BFRs. However, the guide criticized Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data, and for not setting any targets to reduce emissions.[364] In January 2012, Apple requested that its cable maker, Volex, begin producing halogen-free USB and power cables.[365]\n\n\n\n### Green bonds[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2016, Apple issued a $1.5 billion green bond (climate bond), the first ever of its kind by a U.S. tech company. The green bond proceeds are dedicated to the financing of environmental projects.[366]\n\n\n\n## Supply chain[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple supply chain\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Apple supply chain.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\nApple products were made in America in Apple-owned factories until the late 1990s; however, as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by *The New York Times*, Apple insiders \"believe the vast scale of overseas factories, as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers, have so outpaced their American counterparts that \"Made in the USA\" is no longer a viable option for most Apple products\".[367]\n\n\nThe company's manufacturing, procurement, and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: \"Nobody wants to buy sour milk.\"[368][369]\n\n\nIn May 2017, the company announced a $1 billion funding project for \"advanced manufacturing\" in the United States,[370] and subsequently invested $200 million in Corning Inc., a manufacturer of toughened Gorilla Glass technology used in its iPhone devices.[371] The following December, Apple's chief operating officer, Jeff Williams, told *CNBC* that the \"$1 billion\" amount was \"absolutely not\" the final limit on its spending, elaborating that \"We're not thinking in terms of a fund limit... We're thinking about, where are the opportunities across the U.S. to help nurture companies that are making the advanced technology— and the advanced manufacturing that goes with that— that quite frankly is essential to our innovation.\"[372]\n\n\nAs of 2021[update], Apple uses components from 43 countries.[373] The majority of assembling is done by Taiwanese original design manufacturer firms Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Compal Electronics with factories mostly located inside China,[374] but also Brazil,[375] and India.[376]\n\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., (TSMC) is a pure-play semiconductor manufacturing company. They make the majority of Apple's smartphone SoCs, with Samsung Semiconductor, playing a minority role.[377] Apple, alone accounted for over 25% of TSMC's total income in 2021.[378] Apple's Bionic lineup of smartphone SoCs, are currently made exclusively by TSMC[379] from the A7 bionic onwards, previously manufacturing was shared with Samsung. The M series of Apple SoC for consumer computers and tablets is made by TSMC as well.[380]\n\n\nDuring the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.[381] This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the PCI bus in the 7500/8500/9500 Power Macs. Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as USB, AGP, HyperTransport, Wi-Fi, NVMe, PCIe and others in its products. FireWire is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as IEEE 1394 and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States.[382]\n\n\nApple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market. In July 2012, during a conference call with investors, CEO Tim Cook said that he \"[loves] India\", but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region.[383] India's requirement that 30% of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as \"really adds cost to getting product to market\".[384] In May 2016, Apple opened an iOS app development center in Bangalore and a maps development office for 4,000 staff in Hyderabad.[385] In March, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple would begin manufacturing iPhone models in India \"over the next two months\",[386] and in May, the *Journal* wrote that an Apple manufacturer had begun production of iPhone SE in the country,[387] while Apple told *CNBC* that the manufacturing was for a \"small number\" of units.[388] In April 2019, Apple initiated manufacturing of iPhone 7 at its Bengaluru facility, keeping in mind demand from local customers even as they seek more incentives from the government of India.[389] At the beginning of 2020, Tim Cook announced that Apple schedules the opening of its first physical outlet in India for 2021, while an online store is to be launched by the end of the year.[390]\n\n\nDuring the 2022 COVID-19 protests in China, Chinese state-owned company Wingtech was reported by *The Wall Street Journal* to gain an additional foothold in Apple's supply chain following protests at a Foxconn factory in the Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone.[391]\n\n\n\n### Worker organizations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple and unions\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Apple and unions.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\nIn 2006, one complex of factories in Shenzhen, China that assembled the iPod and other items had over 200,000 workers living and working within it. Employees regularly worked more than 60 hours per week and made around $100 per month. A little over half of the workers' earnings was required to pay for rent and food from the company.[392][393]\n\n\nApple immediately launched an investigation after the 2006 media report, and worked with their manufacturers to ensure acceptable working conditions.[394] In 2007, Apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding worker's rights, slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply. Yearly progress reports have been published as of 2008[update].[395] In 2011, Apple admitted that its suppliers' child labor practices in China had worsened.[396]\n\n\nThe Foxconn suicides occurred between January and November 2010, when 18 Foxconn (Chinese: 富士康) employees attempted suicide,[397] resulting in 14 deaths—the company was the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, for clients including Apple, at the time.[397][398][399] The suicides drew media attention, and employment practices at Foxconn were investigated by Apple.[400] Apple issued a public statement about the suicides, and company spokesperson Steven Dowling said:\n\n\n\n\n> [Apple is] saddened and upset by the recent suicides at Foxconn ... A team from Apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made.[401]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe statement was released after the results from the company's probe into its suppliers' labor practices were published in early 2010. Foxconn was not specifically named in the report, but Apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws, including Apple's own rules, and some child labor existed in a number of factories.[401] Apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides.[402]\n\n\nAlso in 2010, workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens. One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses.[403] After a high suicide rate in a Foxconn facility in China making iPads and iPhones, albeit a lower rate than that of China as a whole,[404] workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves.[405] Workers in factories producing Apple products have also been exposed to hexane, a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products.[406]\n\n\nA 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, despite Apple's promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was once again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. While the BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing as of 2010[update], Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: \"We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions\".[402]\n\n\nIn December 2014, the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple's iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65-hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in \"primitive, dark and filthy dorms\" where they sleep \"on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room.\" Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers.[407]\n\n\nIn 2019, there were reports stating that some of Foxconn's managers had used rejected parts to build iPhones and that Apple was investigating the issue.[408]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Apple Inc. media events\n* Pixar\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Apple 10-K Report FY2021\" (PDF).

Its products include desktop PCs, laptop PCs (clamshells, 2-in-1s, convertibles and Chromebooks), tablets, servers, storage devices, virtual reality devices, displays, smartphones and peripherals, as well as gaming PCs and accessories under its Predator brand. Acer is the world's 6th-largest PC vendor by unit sales as of September 2022.[4]\n\n\nIn the early 2000s, Acer implemented a new business model, shifting from a manufacturer to a designer, marketer, and distributor of products, while performing production processes via contract manufacturers.[5] Currently, in addition to its core IT products business, Acer also has a new business entity that focuses on the integration of cloud services and platforms, and the development of smartphones and wearable devices with value-added IoT applications.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n![Logo used from 1987 to 2001](image)Logo used from 1987 to 2001\n\n![](image)Micro-Professor MPF-I (1981)\nAcer was founded in 1976 by Stan Shih (Chinese: 施振榮), his wife Carolyn Yeh, and five others as Multitech in Hsinchu City, Taiwan. The company began with eleven employees and US$25,000 in capital. Initially, it was primarily a distributor of electronic parts and a consultant in the use of microprocessor technologies. It produced the Micro-Professor MPF-I training kit, then two Apple II clones–the Microprofessor II and III–before joining the emerging IBM PC compatible market and becoming a significant PC manufacturer. The company was renamed Acer in 1987.\n\n\nIn 1998, Acer reorganized into five groups: Acer International Service Group, Acer Sertek Service Group, Acer Semiconductor Group, Acer Information Products Group, and Acer Peripherals Group. To dispel complaints from clients that Acer competed with its own products and to alleviate the competitive nature of the branded sales versus contract manufacturing businesses, the company spun off the contract business in 2000, renaming it Wistron Corporation. The restructuring resulted in two primary units: brand name sales and contract manufacturing. In 2001, the company sold its manufacturing units BenQ and Wistron in order to focus resources on design and sales.\n\n\nAcer increased worldwide sales while simultaneously reducing its labor force by identifying and using marketing strategies that best utilized their existing distribution channels. In January 2005 Gianfranco Lanci [zh] became the president. By 2005, Acer employed a scant 7,800 people worldwide. Revenues rose from US$4.9 billion in 2003[7] to US$11.31 billion in 2006.[8]\n\n\nAcer's North American market share has slipped in the early 2000s, while its European market share has risen.[9]\n\n\nIn the mid-2000s, consumer notebooks were almost the sole growth drivers for the PC industry, and Acer's exceptionally low overheads and dedication to the channel made it one of the main beneficiaries of this trend.[10] Acer grew quickly in Europe in part by embracing the use of more traditional distribution channels targeting retail consumers when some rivals were pursuing online sales and business customers. In 2007, Acer bought Gateway in the United States and Packard Bell in Europe, and became the third-largest provider of computers and the second largest for notebooks, achieving significant improvement in profitability. Acer has strived to become the world's largest PC vendor in the belief that the goal can help it achieve economy of scale and garner higher margin.[11] However, such a reliance on the high-volume, low-value PC market made Acer exposed when buying habits changed.\n\n\nIn September 2018, Acer spun-off its smart gadget unit GadgeTek Inc., which produces Leap Beads, smart prayer beads that track mantras and footsteps.[12][13]\n\n\nIn 2019, Acer announced the esports social platform PLANET9.gg, which aims to provide game analytics, community-organized competitions, and social experiences.[14]\n\n\n\n## 2013 re-organisation[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2013, chairman and CEO J.T. Wang and president Jim Wong both resigned due to the company's poor financial performance. Wang had been reportedly due to leave Acer at the end of the year and was supposed to have been succeeded by Wong. Acer co-founder Stan Shih took over as board chairman and interim president after the departure of Wang and Wong and began to search for new candidates to assume the roles of CEO and president. On 23 December, Acer named Jason Chen, then the vice president of worldwide sales and marketing at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, as its new president and CEO, effective 1 January.[15]\n\n\n\n## Acquisitions and joint ventures[edit]\n\n\n* In 1988, Acer acquired Counterpoint Computers.\n* In 1990, Acer acquired Altos Computer Corporation.\n* In 1993, Acer acquired the PC division of Commodore International.[16]\n* In 1997, Acer acquired Texas Instruments notebook computer business.\n* On 27 August 2007, Acer announced plans to acquire its US-based rival Gateway, Inc. for US$710 million. Acer's former chairman, J.T. Wang, stated that the acquisition completed Acer's \"global footprint, by strengthening [its] United States presence\".[17] Included in this acquisition was the eMachines brand.\n* In January 2008, Acer announced that it had acquired a controlling interest of 75% of Packard Bell.[18]\n* In March 2008, Acer acquired Taiwanese electronics manufacturing company E-TEN.\n* In 2009, Acer acquired 29.9% of Italian computer system manufacturer Olidata.\n* In August 2010, Acer and Founder Technology signed a memorandum of mutual understanding to strengthen their long-term PC business cooperation.\n* In July 2011, Acer bought iGware Inc. (formally BroadOn)[19] for US$320 million. The aim is to create Acer Cloud to enter cloud computing market.[20] iGware had developed cloud software and infrastructure tools for devices. It had also notably partnered with Nintendo on several projects.[21]\n* In September 2015, Acer acquired GPS cycling computer brand Xplova.[22]\n* In September 2015, Acer invested in robotics start-up company Jibo.[23]\n* In March 2016, Acer made an equity investment in grandPad, a provider of technology solutions specifically designed for senior citizens.[24]\n* In June 2016, Acer's board of directors approved the establishment of a joint venture with Starbreeze AB to design, manufacture, promote, market and sell StarVR Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Displays.[25]\n* In 2016, Acer acquired wireless pet camera maker Pawbo.[26]\n* In 2017, Acer became the largest corporate shareholder of AOPEN Inc.[27]\n* In October 2017, Acer purchased a 66.7% majority stake in StarVR from Starbreeze.[28]\n* In 2019, Acer and Ubisoft teamed up for the Rainbow Six Pro League and other major esports events with the Predator brand as the PC and monitor sponsor.[29]\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nAs of September 2022, Acer has over 7,713 employees worldwide, operating in 40 countries/territories.[30]\n\n\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\n\nAcer Computer Australia (ACA) was established in 1990, and is currently Australia's third-largest personal computer vendor, behind Hewlett-Packard Australia and Dell Australia and New Zealand. ACA has Australia's highest overall market share in notebook PC and tablet PC sales. The company is also Australia's leading PC vendor in the government and education markets. As of 2006,[update] it has over 480 employees.\n\n\nThe company repairs, assembles and manufacturers laptops and desktops in Sydney.[31][32]\n\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\nAcer's EMEA headquarters are located in Lugano, Switzerland. From the late 1990s to mid-2000s, Acer had computer factories in Europe. The business area was the whole EMEA. In the Netherlands under the name of Acer IMS bv, there were two factories: Acer laptop factory in Den Bosch and Acer and IBM desktop factory in Tilburg.[33][34] Acer also had facilities in Germany under the name of IMS in Ahrensburg and Hamburg. Acer computers are also assembled in Mingachevir, Azerbaijan.\n\n\n\n### India[edit]\n\n\nAcer's subsidiary in India is **Acer India (Pvt) Limited**, and was incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acer Computer International, Ltd. in 1999. It is a notable vendor in key segments such as education, desktop computers, and low profile notebooks for education. The head office is in Bengaluru, Karnataka.\n\n\n\n### Indonesia[edit]\n\n\nPT Acer Indonesia is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acer and distributes its products through their main distributor PT Dragon Computer & Communication. Acer is currently the second-largest computer vendor in Indonesia. In the first quarter of 2016, Acer recorded >81% market share in Windows tablet in Indonesia.\n\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Acer America Headquarters in San Jose\nAcer America Corporation, headquartered in San Jose, California, is a member of the Acer Group. Acer's R&D, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing operations in the United States and Canada are handled by Acer America. The U.S. headquarters was opened with a staff of three in 1985, as Multitech Electronics USA, in Mountain View, California. In 1986, the U.S. headquarters were moved to San Jose, California.\n\n\n\n## Notable product lines[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An Acer Aspire laptop\n* Acer Extensa series – Business-oriented laptops\n* Acer Iconia – A series of tablet computers\n* Acer Aspire – Budget to entry level personal-use computer and laptops aimed for casual household use\n* Acer TravelMate – Lightweight business-oriented laptops\n* Acer Nitro – Acer's entry to mid-end gaming-oriented laptops\n* Acer Predator – Acer's mid to high-end gaming laptops and desktops\n* Acer Aspire One – Acer's mid to high-end personal-use laptop\n* Acer Swift – A series of mid to high-end ultra-portable notebooks\n* Acer Spin – A series of budget to mid-end two-in-one laptops\n* Acer ConceptD – Desktop and laptops designed for studios and rendering\n* Acer Veriton – A high-end business-oriented desktop\n* Acer Enduro – Acer's series of rugged laptops\n* Acer Enduro Urban – Lightweight semi-rugged laptops.\n* Acer Vero – Eco-friendly laptops.\n\n\n## Brands[edit]\n\n\n* Aazar\n* eMachines\n* ProPack\n* Gateway\n* Packard Bell\n* Pawbo\n* Predator\n* Xplova\n* Nitro\n\n\n## Corporate social responsibility[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Corporate social responsibility\n\nIn 2005, Acer published its first environmental report, for which the company used the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines. All of Acer's tier-one suppliers have acquired ISO 14001 certification.[35]\n\n\nIn November 2012, Acer was ranked 4th place out of 15 in Greenpeace's re-launched Guide to Greener Electronics, with a score of 5.1 points out of 10. The Guide ranks electronics makers according to their policies and practices to reduce their impact on the climate, produce greener products, and make their operations more sustainable.[36]\n\n\nGreenpeace criticized the company for not setting out targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as intended in 2010 and for not providing external verification for the GHG emissions it reports for its operations and business travel. It also scored badly on the products criteria receiving no points on product lifecycle while Greenpeace noted that a higher percentage of its products need to meet or exceed Energy Star standards in order for it to score more points.[36]\n\n\nIt received some praise for launching new products which are free from Polyvinyl chloride plastic (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and the company informed Greenpeace that the majority of its products will be PVC/BFR free in the near future. Acer also scored well on chemical management for lobbying for restrictions on organo-halogens and was commended for reporting on GHG emissions from its first-tier suppliers and investigating its second tier.[36]\n\n\nIn its 2012 report on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated Acer the seventh highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.[37]\n\n\nAcer has been listed on the DJSI's Emerging Markets Index since 2014 and on MSCI's Global Sustainability Indexes in 2015–2016.[38]\n\n\n\n## Sponsorships[edit]\n\n\n* Acer sponsored the BAR-Honda Formula One racing team in the year 2000.[39] In 2001, Acer provided sponsorship to the Prost Grand Prix Formula One team, and the team's Ferrari engines were badged as Acers.\n* Acer sponsored the Ferrari Formula 1 team from 2003 up to 2012 (Official Supplier since 2006) and its Top Sponsor of FC Internazionale – Milano (Inter Milan) Football Club. From 2007 to 2009 Acer has been Official Supplier of FC Barcelona.[40] On 19 March 2007, Acer announced it would sponsor the Factory Fiat Yamaha Team for the 2007 MotoGP World Championship season. Since 2009, Packard Bell (part of Acer Group) has been the sponsor of the Yamaha Factory Racing Team.[41]\n* Acer was the worldwide TOP Partners for both the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games and Singapore Youth Olympic Games. Acer was TOP Partner of the London 2012 Summer Olympics.[42]\n* On 18 June 2019, Acer Predator sponsored Ubisoft Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege Pro League Season X, becoming the official PC Monitor of Rainbow Six Pro League and Majors.[43]\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Acer refused to join the international community and withdraw from the Russian market. Research from Yale University from March 28, 2022, identifying how companies were reacting to Russia's aggression identified Acer in the worst category \"Digging in\" meaning Defying Demands for Exit: companies defying demands for exit/reduction of activities.[44] Acer subsequently reversed its decision and suspended business in Russia.[45] Despite stating that it would suspend business in Russia, a Reuters investigation of customs data found that Acer supplied at least $70.4 million worth of computer hardware to Russia between April 8, 2022 and March 31, 2023, and it was supplied to Russia both through Acer's wholly-owned Swiss registered subsidiary. Since the shipments occurred outside Taiwan, they did not violate Taiwanese sanctions against Russia.[46]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Taiwan portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![flag](image)California portal\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Acer Inc..\n\n* Acer Value Line\n* Asus, a rival Taiwan-based company started in 1989 by former Acer engineers\n* E-TEN\n* eMachines\n* Packard Bell\n* Gateway, Inc.\n* BenQ, formerly Acer CM\n* ACC (computer company)\n* AOpen, formerly AcerOpen\n* List of companies of Taiwan\n* Microprofessor I, Acer's first product\n* List of computer system manufacturers\n* ALi, formerly Acer Laboratories Incorporated\n* Wistron, formerly the manufacturing arm of Acer Inc.\n* PLANET9.gg\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** \"2020 Acer Annual Report\" (PDF).

Its products include desktop PCs, laptop PCs (clamshells, 2-in-1s, convertibles and Chromebooks), tablets, servers, storage devices, virtual reality devices, displays, smartphones and peripherals, as well as gaming PCs and accessories under its Predator brand. Acer is the world's 6th-largest PC vendor by unit sales as of September 2022.[4]\n\n\nIn the early 2000s, Acer implemented a new business model, shifting from a manufacturer to a designer, marketer, and distributor of products, while performing production processes via contract manufacturers.[5] Currently, in addition to its core IT products business, Acer also has a new business entity that focuses on the integration of cloud services and platforms, and the development of smartphones and wearable devices with value-added IoT applications.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n![Logo used from 1987 to 2001](image)Logo used from 1987 to 2001\n\n![](image)Micro-Professor MPF-I (1981)\nAcer was founded in 1976 by Stan Shih (Chinese: 施振榮), his wife Carolyn Yeh, and five others as Multitech in Hsinchu City, Taiwan. The company began with eleven employees and US$25,000 in capital. Initially, it was primarily a distributor of electronic parts and a consultant in the use of microprocessor technologies. It produced the Micro-Professor MPF-I training kit, then two Apple II clones–the Microprofessor II and III–before joining the emerging IBM PC compatible market and becoming a significant PC manufacturer. The company was renamed Acer in 1987.\n\n\nIn 1998, Acer reorganized into five groups: Acer International Service Group, Acer Sertek Service Group, Acer Semiconductor Group, Acer Information Products Group, and Acer Peripherals Group. To dispel complaints from clients that Acer competed with its own products and to alleviate the competitive nature of the branded sales versus contract manufacturing businesses, the company spun off the contract business in 2000, renaming it Wistron Corporation. The restructuring resulted in two primary units: brand name sales and contract manufacturing. In 2001, the company sold its manufacturing units BenQ and Wistron in order to focus resources on design and sales.\n\n\nAcer increased worldwide sales while simultaneously reducing its labor force by identifying and using marketing strategies that best utilized their existing distribution channels. In January 2005 Gianfranco Lanci [zh] became the president. By 2005, Acer employed a scant 7,800 people worldwide. Revenues rose from US$4.9 billion in 2003[7] to US$11.31 billion in 2006.[8]\n\n\nAcer's North American market share has slipped in the early 2000s, while its European market share has risen.[9]\n\n\nIn the mid-2000s, consumer notebooks were almost the sole growth drivers for the PC industry, and Acer's exceptionally low overheads and dedication to the channel made it one of the main beneficiaries of this trend.[10] Acer grew quickly in Europe in part by embracing the use of more traditional distribution channels targeting retail consumers when some rivals were pursuing online sales and business customers. In 2007, Acer bought Gateway in the United States and Packard Bell in Europe, and became the third-largest provider of computers and the second largest for notebooks, achieving significant improvement in profitability. Acer has strived to become the world's largest PC vendor in the belief that the goal can help it achieve economy of scale and garner higher margin.[11] However, such a reliance on the high-volume, low-value PC market made Acer exposed when buying habits changed.\n\n\nIn September 2018, Acer spun-off its smart gadget unit GadgeTek Inc., which produces Leap Beads, smart prayer beads that track mantras and footsteps.[12][13]\n\n\nIn 2019, Acer announced the esports social platform PLANET9.gg, which aims to provide game analytics, community-organized competitions, and social experiences.[14]\n\n\n\n## 2013 re-organisation[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2013, chairman and CEO J.T. Wang and president Jim Wong both resigned due to the company's poor financial performance. Wang had been reportedly due to leave Acer at the end of the year and was supposed to have been succeeded by Wong. Acer co-founder Stan Shih took over as board chairman and interim president after the departure of Wang and Wong and began to search for new candidates to assume the roles of CEO and president. On 23 December, Acer named Jason Chen, then the vice president of worldwide sales and marketing at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, as its new president and CEO, effective 1 January.[15]\n\n\n\n## Acquisitions and joint ventures[edit]\n\n\n* In 1988, Acer acquired Counterpoint Computers.\n* In 1990, Acer acquired Altos Computer Corporation.\n* In 1993, Acer acquired the PC division of Commodore International.[16]\n* In 1997, Acer acquired Texas Instruments notebook computer business.\n* On 27 August 2007, Acer announced plans to acquire its US-based rival Gateway, Inc. for US$710 million. Acer's former chairman, J.T. Wang, stated that the acquisition completed Acer's \"global footprint, by strengthening [its] United States presence\".[17] Included in this acquisition was the eMachines brand.\n* In January 2008, Acer announced that it had acquired a controlling interest of 75% of Packard Bell.[18]\n* In March 2008, Acer acquired Taiwanese electronics manufacturing company E-TEN.\n* In 2009, Acer acquired 29.9% of Italian computer system manufacturer Olidata.\n* In August 2010, Acer and Founder Technology signed a memorandum of mutual understanding to strengthen their long-term PC business cooperation.\n* In July 2011, Acer bought iGware Inc. (formally BroadOn)[19] for US$320 million. The aim is to create Acer Cloud to enter cloud computing market.[20] iGware had developed cloud software and infrastructure tools for devices. It had also notably partnered with Nintendo on several projects.[21]\n* In September 2015, Acer acquired GPS cycling computer brand Xplova.[22]\n* In September 2015, Acer invested in robotics start-up company Jibo.[23]\n* In March 2016, Acer made an equity investment in grandPad, a provider of technology solutions specifically designed for senior citizens.[24]\n* In June 2016, Acer's board of directors approved the establishment of a joint venture with Starbreeze AB to design, manufacture, promote, market and sell StarVR Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Displays.[25]\n* In 2016, Acer acquired wireless pet camera maker Pawbo.[26]\n* In 2017, Acer became the largest corporate shareholder of AOPEN Inc.[27]\n* In October 2017, Acer purchased a 66.7% majority stake in StarVR from Starbreeze.[28]\n* In 2019, Acer and Ubisoft teamed up for the Rainbow Six Pro League and other major esports events with the Predator brand as the PC and monitor sponsor.[29]\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nAs of September 2022, Acer has over 7,713 employees worldwide, operating in 40 countries/territories.[30]\n\n\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\n\nAcer Computer Australia (ACA) was established in 1990, and is currently Australia's third-largest personal computer vendor, behind Hewlett-Packard Australia and Dell Australia and New Zealand. ACA has Australia's highest overall market share in notebook PC and tablet PC sales. The company is also Australia's leading PC vendor in the government and education markets. As of 2006,[update] it has over 480 employees.\n\n\nThe company repairs, assembles and manufacturers laptops and desktops in Sydney.[31][32]\n\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\nAcer's EMEA headquarters are located in Lugano, Switzerland. From the late 1990s to mid-2000s, Acer had computer factories in Europe. The business area was the whole EMEA. In the Netherlands under the name of Acer IMS bv, there were two factories: Acer laptop factory in Den Bosch and Acer and IBM desktop factory in Tilburg.[33][34] Acer also had facilities in Germany under the name of IMS in Ahrensburg and Hamburg. Acer computers are also assembled in Mingachevir, Azerbaijan.\n\n\n\n### India[edit]\n\n\nAcer's subsidiary in India is **Acer India (Pvt) Limited**, and was incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acer Computer International, Ltd. in 1999. It is a notable vendor in key segments such as education, desktop computers, and low profile notebooks for education. The head office is in Bengaluru, Karnataka.\n\n\n\n### Indonesia[edit]\n\n\nPT Acer Indonesia is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acer and distributes its products through their main distributor PT Dragon Computer & Communication. Acer is currently the second-largest computer vendor in Indonesia. In the first quarter of 2016, Acer recorded >81% market share in Windows tablet in Indonesia.\n\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Acer America Headquarters in San Jose\nAcer America Corporation, headquartered in San Jose, California, is a member of the Acer Group. Acer's R&D, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing operations in the United States and Canada are handled by Acer America. The U.S. headquarters was opened with a staff of three in 1985, as Multitech Electronics USA, in Mountain View, California. In 1986, the U.S. headquarters were moved to San Jose, California.\n\n\n\n## Notable product lines[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An Acer Aspire laptop\n* Acer Extensa series – Business-oriented laptops\n* Acer Iconia – A series of tablet computers\n* Acer Aspire – Budget to entry level personal-use computer and laptops aimed for casual household use\n* Acer TravelMate – Lightweight business-oriented laptops\n* Acer Nitro – Acer's entry to mid-end gaming-oriented laptops\n* Acer Predator – Acer's mid to high-end gaming laptops and desktops\n* Acer Aspire One – Acer's mid to high-end personal-use laptop\n* Acer Swift – A series of mid to high-end ultra-portable notebooks\n* Acer Spin – A series of budget to mid-end two-in-one laptops\n* Acer ConceptD – Desktop and laptops designed for studios and rendering\n* Acer Veriton – A high-end business-oriented desktop\n* Acer Enduro – Acer's series of rugged laptops\n* Acer Enduro Urban – Lightweight semi-rugged laptops.\n* Acer Vero – Eco-friendly laptops.\n\n\n## Brands[edit]\n\n\n* Aazar\n* eMachines\n* ProPack\n* Gateway\n* Packard Bell\n* Pawbo\n* Predator\n* Xplova\n* Nitro\n\n\n## Corporate social responsibility[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Corporate social responsibility\n\nIn 2005, Acer published its first environmental report, for which the company used the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines. All of Acer's tier-one suppliers have acquired ISO 14001 certification.[35]\n\n\nIn November 2012, Acer was ranked 4th place out of 15 in Greenpeace's re-launched Guide to Greener Electronics, with a score of 5.1 points out of 10. The Guide ranks electronics makers according to their policies and practices to reduce their impact on the climate, produce greener products, and make their operations more sustainable.[36]\n\n\nGreenpeace criticized the company for not setting out targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as intended in 2010 and for not providing external verification for the GHG emissions it reports for its operations and business travel. It also scored badly on the products criteria receiving no points on product lifecycle while Greenpeace noted that a higher percentage of its products need to meet or exceed Energy Star standards in order for it to score more points.[36]\n\n\nIt received some praise for launching new products which are free from Polyvinyl chloride plastic (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and the company informed Greenpeace that the majority of its products will be PVC/BFR free in the near future. Acer also scored well on chemical management for lobbying for restrictions on organo-halogens and was commended for reporting on GHG emissions from its first-tier suppliers and investigating its second tier.[36]\n\n\nIn its 2012 report on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated Acer the seventh highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.[37]\n\n\nAcer has been listed on the DJSI's Emerging Markets Index since 2014 and on MSCI's Global Sustainability Indexes in 2015–2016.[38]\n\n\n\n## Sponsorships[edit]\n\n\n* Acer sponsored the BAR-Honda Formula One racing team in the year 2000.[39] In 2001, Acer provided sponsorship to the Prost Grand Prix Formula One team, and the team's Ferrari engines were badged as Acers.\n* Acer sponsored the Ferrari Formula 1 team from 2003 up to 2012 (Official Supplier since 2006) and its Top Sponsor of FC Internazionale – Milano (Inter Milan) Football Club. From 2007 to 2009 Acer has been Official Supplier of FC Barcelona.[40] On 19 March 2007, Acer announced it would sponsor the Factory Fiat Yamaha Team for the 2007 MotoGP World Championship season. Since 2009, Packard Bell (part of Acer Group) has been the sponsor of the Yamaha Factory Racing Team.[41]\n* Acer was the worldwide TOP Partners for both the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games and Singapore Youth Olympic Games. Acer was TOP Partner of the London 2012 Summer Olympics.[42]\n* On 18 June 2019, Acer Predator sponsored Ubisoft Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege Pro League Season X, becoming the official PC Monitor of Rainbow Six Pro League and Majors.[43]\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Acer refused to join the international community and withdraw from the Russian market. Research from Yale University from March 28, 2022, identifying how companies were reacting to Russia's aggression identified Acer in the worst category \"Digging in\" meaning Defying Demands for Exit: companies defying demands for exit/reduction of activities.[44] Acer subsequently reversed its decision and suspended business in Russia.[45] Despite stating that it would suspend business in Russia, a Reuters investigation of customs data found that Acer supplied at least $70.4 million worth of computer hardware to Russia between April 8, 2022 and March 31, 2023, and it was supplied to Russia both through Acer's wholly-owned Swiss registered subsidiary. Since the shipments occurred outside Taiwan, they did not violate Taiwanese sanctions against Russia.[46]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Taiwan portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![flag](image)California portal\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Acer Inc..\n\n* Acer Value Line\n* Asus, a rival Taiwan-based company started in 1989 by former Acer engineers\n* E-TEN\n* eMachines\n* Packard Bell\n* Gateway, Inc.\n* BenQ, formerly Acer CM\n* ACC (computer company)\n* AOpen, formerly AcerOpen\n* List of companies of Taiwan\n* Microprofessor I, Acer's first product\n* List of computer system manufacturers\n* ALi, formerly Acer Laboratories Incorporated\n* Wistron, formerly the manufacturing arm of Acer Inc.\n* PLANET9.gg\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** \"2020 Acer Annual Report\" (PDF).
