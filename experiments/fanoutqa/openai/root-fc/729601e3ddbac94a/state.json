The Thunder compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Northwest Division of the Western Conference.[8][9] The team plays its home games at Paycom Center.[10]\n\n\nThe Thunder's NBA G League affiliate is the Oklahoma City Blue, which it owns.[11] The Thunder are the only team in the major professional North American sports leagues based in the state of Oklahoma.[12] Oklahoma City previously hosted the New Orleans Hornets for two seasons following devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.[13][14]\n\n\nThe team was originally established as the **Seattle SuperSonics**, an expansion team that joined the NBA for the 1967\u201368\u00a0season. The SuperSonics relocated from Seattle to Oklahoma City on July 3, 2008 after a settlement was reached between the ownership group led by Clay Bennett and lawmakers in Seattle following a lawsuit.[15] In Seattle, the SuperSonics qualified for the NBA playoffs 22 times, won their division six times, advanced to three NBA Finals, and won the 1979 NBA Championship.\n\n\nIn Oklahoma City, the Thunder qualified for their first playoff berth during the 2009\u201310 season. They won their first division title as the Thunder in the 2010\u201311 season and their first Western Conference championship as the Thunder in the 2011\u201312 season, appearing in the NBA Finals for the fourth time in franchise history and first time since 1996, when the team was based in Seattle. The team has yet to win a championship since moving to Oklahoma City.\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\n### 1967\u20132008: Seattle SuperSonics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seattle SuperSonics\n\nThe Thunder's previous incarnation, the **Seattle SuperSonics** were formed in 1967. In their 41 seasons in Seattle, the SuperSonics compiled a 1,745\u20131,585 (.524) win\u2013loss record in the regular season and went 107\u2013110 (.493) in the playoffs. The franchise's titles include three Western Conference championships (1978, 1979 and 1996) and one NBA title in 1979.\n\n\n\n### 2008\u20132009: Move to Oklahoma City and inaugural season[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City and 2008\u201309 Oklahoma City Thunder season\n\nIn 2006, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz sold the SuperSonics and its Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) sister franchise, the Seattle Storm, for $350 million to the Professional Basketball Club LLC, a group of Oklahoma City investors led by Clay Bennett.[16] The sale of the SuperSonics and Storm was approved by NBA owners the following October.[17][18] In 2007, Bennett announced that the franchise would move to Oklahoma City as soon as the lease with KeyArena expired.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)Paycom Center began hosting the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008.\nIn June 2008, a lawsuit brought by the city of Seattle against Bennett due to his attempts to break the final two years of the Sonics' lease at KeyArena went to federal court. Nearly a month later, the two sides reached a settlement agreement.[20] The terms awarded the city $45 million to get out of the remaining lease at KeyArena, and would have provided an additional $30 million payment to Seattle in 2013 if certain conditions had been met. The owners agreed to leave the SuperSonics name, logo and colors in Seattle for a possible future NBA franchise;[*disputed \u2013 discuss*][21] however, the items would remain the property of the Oklahoma City team along with other \"assets\", including championship banners and trophies.[*disputed \u2013 discuss*][22] On September 3, 2008, the team name, logo and colors for the Oklahoma City franchise were revealed to the public. The name \"Thunder\" was chosen in reference to Oklahoma's location in Tornado Alley and Oklahoma City as the home of the U.S. Army's 45th Infantry Division, the Thunderbirds.[23][24][25] The SuperSonics' final NBA draft was in 2008, and they used the fourth overall pick to select Russell Westbrook, a young point guard from UCLA, who would become the team's franchise player.\n\n\nThe Thunder participated in the Orlando Pro Summer League featuring their second-year players, potential free agents and rookies. The players wore generic black and white jerseys reading \"OKC-NBA\" against an outline of a basketball. The Thunder's temporary practice facility was the Sawyer Center at Southern Nazarene University, which had been used by the New Orleans Hornets when they relocated to Oklahoma City after Hurricane Katrina.[26]\n\n\nThe Thunder played several preseason games before the 2008\u201309 regular season, but only one of those games was in Oklahoma City. The Thunder made their first appearance in Billings, Montana on October 8, 2008 in an 88\u201382 preseason loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves.[27] The Thunder played their first Ford Center game on October 14 against the Los Angeles Clippers.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)Oklahoma City defeated Minnesota on November 2, 2008 for their first win.\nIn their regular-season home opener, the Thunder faced (and lost to) the Milwaukee Bucks. Earl Watson scored the first points of the season with a layup. Three nights later on November 2, the Thunder won their first game by defeating the Timberwolves, improving their record to 1\u20133. The team then went on a 10-game losing streak before deciding on November 22 to fire head coach P. J. Carlesimo and assistant Paul Westhead. Assistant coach Scott Brooks then took over on an interim basis.[29] Oklahoma City lost its next four games to tie the franchise losing streak of 14 set in Seattle the previous season. But the team managed to prevent history by winning their next game on the road against the Memphis Grizzlies.[30]\n\n\nAs the season continued, the Thunder began to improve. After starting 3\u201329, the Thunder finished the regular season 20\u201330 for the remaining fifty games. Not only were they winning more often, they played much more competitively than in the first part of the season. The team brought their record to 23\u201359 and improved upon their record of 20\u201362 from the team's final season in Seattle. The late-season successes of the Thunder contributed to the signing of Scott Brooks as the team's official head coach.\n\n\nAfter moving to Oklahoma City from Seattle, the team's operating situation improved markedly. In December 2008, *Forbes* magazine estimated the team's franchise value at $300 million\u2014a 12 percent increase from the previous year's $268 million, when the club was located in Seattle.[31] *Forbes* also noted an increase in percentage of available tickets sold, from 78 percent in the team's last season in Seattle to 100 percent in 2008\u201309.[32]\n\n\n\n### 2009\u20132012: Rise to contention and first Finals appearance[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2009\u201310 Oklahoma City Thunder season and 2011\u201312 Oklahoma City Thunder season\n\n![](image)\nRussell Westbrook\n![](image)\nJames Harden\n![](image)\nKevin Durant\n![](image)\nSerge Ibaka\n\nAfter an inaugural season filled with many adjustments, the Thunder hoped to improve during their second season in Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City did not make any major moves in the off-season, other than drafting James Harden from Arizona State University with the third overall pick in the NBA draft. The Thunder selected Rodrigue Beaubois with the 25th pick in the 2009 draft before immediately trading him to the Dallas Mavericks for the 24th pick, center Byron Mullens from Ohio State University. The team then added veteran center Etan Thomas and guard Kevin Ollie. The last major change to their roster occurred on December 22, 2009, when the team traded for Eric Maynor from the Utah Jazz. Maynor immediately supplanted Ollie as the backup point guard.\n\n\nFrom the outset the young team looked determined and cohesive. The increasing leadership of Kevin Durant, along with the growing experience of the Thunder's younger players, including future MVPs Russell Westbrook and James Harden, were signs of the Thunder's improvement. The 2009\u201310 season included several victories over the NBA's elite teams, including a 28-point win over the Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic and a 16-point win over the reigning NBA champion, the Los Angeles Lakers. Road victories over the San Antonio Spurs, Utah Jazz, Miami Heat, Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks further enhanced their reputation. Though they hovered around .500 for the first half of the season, they went on a 9-game winning streak that sent them into serious playoff contention. Kevin Durant became the youngest player in league history to win the scoring title, averaging 30.1 points per game while playing in all 82 games.\n\n\nThe Thunder finished 50\u201332, more than doubling their win total from the previous season. The 50\u201332 record tied the 2008 Denver Nuggets for the most wins by an 8th seed in the modern playoffs era. The Oklahoma City Thunder also had the same record as the Boston Celtics in this season.[33] They finished fourth in the Northwest Division and eighth in the Western Conference playoff standings, and earned a spot in the 2010 NBA playoffs. On April 22, the team secured their first playoff win in Oklahoma City when they defeated the defending-champion Los Angeles Lakers 101\u201396. This was also the Thunder's first playoff win at the Ford Center. The Thunder would go on to tie the series at two games each, but the Lakers won the last two games in the series to win it 4\u20132.\n\n\nOklahoma City ranked twelfth in overall attendance in the NBA, and seventh in percentage of available seats occupied (98.9 percent, including 28 sellouts in 41 home games).[34] The team's operating situation also continued to improve in 2009\u201310. *Forbes* magazine estimated the team's franchise value at $310 million (an increase of $10 million over the prior year) with an estimated operating profit of $12.7 million (the first operating profit in years for the franchise).[35]\n\n\nFinancially, the Thunder organization continued to build on the positive returns experienced from relocating from Seattle to Oklahoma City. In January 2011, *Forbes* magazine estimated the franchise's worth at $329 million, up six percent from 2009\u201310 and ranking No. 18 in the NBA.[36] The magazine also estimated the franchise's revenue at $118 million and operating profit at $22.6 million\u2014up 6.3 percent and 78 percent, respectively, from the previous year.[35][36] The Thunder finished the 2010\u20132011 season with a 55\u201327 record, a five-win increase from their breakout season the previous year. The team also captured their first division title since moving to Oklahoma City, and seventh in franchise history.[37]\n\n\nIn the wake of a fourth-seed versus fifth-seed match-up against the Denver Nuggets, Kevin Durant scored 41 points in game 1 to set a new career playoff high. In the final game of the series, he again scored 41 and forward Serge Ibaka nearly tied the record for most blocks in a playoff game (10, set by Mark Eaton, Hakeem Olajuwon and Andrew Bynum) with nine blocks.[38] The Thunder won the series four games to one and were set to face off against the Memphis Grizzlies who achieved an eight-seed upset over the San Antonio Spurs just days before. The Thunder advanced to the Western Conference Finals with a seven-game series triumph over the Grizzlies. Durant was again the star, scoring 39 points in the clinching game 7, while Russell Westbrook also had a triple-double. Despite hard-fought battles with the eventual NBA champs, the Thunder fell to the Dallas Mavericks 4\u20131 in the Western Conference Finals. The Thunder had a chance to tie the series in game 4, but they were unable to hold a 15-point lead with five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. They ended up losing in overtime, 112\u2013105.\n\n\nDuring the extended lockout, Thunder players played in exhibition games and even local pickup games to stay in shape.[39][40][41][42] When the abbreviated training camp began, Oklahoma City started with an intact roster and all players, except for Russell Westbrook. In addition, Kendrick Perkins lost more than 30 pounds during the lockout. The Thunder made their two pre-season appearances, after the lockout, against the Dallas Mavericks, winning both games. They won their first regular-season game against Orlando at home and went on a five-game winning streak. Kevin Durant became the sixth player to score 30 or more points in four consecutive games at the start of a season. In addition, the Thunder was the first to sweep their back-to-back-to-back games, winning a home-and-home series with the Houston Rockets, then routing the San Antonio Spurs. Thunder players Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Perkins and Ibaka made it onto the 2012 All-Star ballots. After the Thunder's win over the Utah Jazz on February 11, 2012, Scott Brooks was named as the head coach for the Western Conference All-Star squad for the 2012 NBA All-Star Game in Orlando, Florida.\n\n\nIn the 2012 NBA playoffs, the Thunder swept the defending champion Dallas Mavericks in the first round to advance and face off against their first-round foes from 2010, the Los Angeles Lakers. They defeated the Lakers in five games and advanced to play the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals. The Thunder lost the first two games against the Spurs but won the next three including a game 5 road win, to take a commanding 3\u20132 game lead in the series. In game 6, the Thunder defeated the Spurs 107\u201399 and advanced to the 2012 NBA Finals. Durant led the way with 34 points, playing all of regulation time in the game. In the 2012 NBA Finals against the Miami Heat, the Thunder won the first game at home but then lost four in a row losing the series in five games.\n\n\n\n### 2012\u20132016: The Durant and Westbrook era[edit]\n\n\n#### 2012\u201313 season[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012\u201313 Oklahoma City Thunder season\n\n![](image)Daequan Cook\nIn the 2012 NBA draft, the Thunder selected Baylor University forward Perry Jones III with the 28th overall pick. The Thunder also signed free agents Hasheem Thabeet and Daniel Orton, and signed guards Andy Rautins and DeAndre Liggins. They re-signed forward Serge Ibaka to a four-year, $48 million extension. After failing to sign James Harden to an extension that was reportedly worth four years and $52 million, the team decided to trade Harden rather than having to pay the luxury tax penalty. On October 27, 2012, the Thunder traded Harden along with center Cole Aldrich and forwards Daequan Cook and Lazar Hayward to the Houston Rockets for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, first-round draft picks from Toronto and Dallas, and one second-round draft pick. Martin took over Harden's sixth-man role for the season. The Thunder finished with a 60\u201322 regular season, taking both the Northwest division title and top seed of the Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced the 8th-seeded Houston Rockets, featuring former team member James Harden. In game two of the series, Russell Westbrook was struck by Rockets point guard Patrick Beverley, and fell down with an injury and missed the rest of the playoffs after having knee surgery. Without the team's second-leading scorer, the Thunder, who had a 3\u20130 lead, lost the next two games to bring the series to 3\u20132. In game 6, the Thunder defeated the Rockets to advance to the second round, facing a rematch of the 2011 second round, with the Memphis Grizzlies. The Thunder lost the series 4\u20131, losing four straight games after winning game 1 at home.\n\n\n\n#### 2013\u201314 season[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2013\u201314 Oklahoma City Thunder season\n\n![](image)The Thunder selected Steven Adams as the 12th pick in the 2013 NBA draft.\nIn the 2013 NBA draft, the Thunder selected 12th pick Steven Adams, traded for the 26th pick Andr\u00e9 Roberson, and selected 47th pick Grant Jerrett. Kevin Martin was not re-signed, and he opted to join the Timberwolves, while the team were only able add free agent Ryan Gomes and re-sign Derek Fisher to conclude their off-season movements. The team finished second in the Western conference with a 59\u201323 record. They met the Memphis Grizzlies for the third time in the playoffs, which set a record for most consecutive overtimes in a playoff series, with four. Oklahoma City prevailed in seven games to play the Los Angeles Clippers in the semi-finals, whom they defeated in six games. Their final playoff opponent, in the Western Conference Finals, was the San Antonio Spurs in a rematch of the 2012 Western Conference Finals, this time with the Spurs winning, 4\u20132.\n\n\n\n#### 2014\u20132016[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2014\u201315 Oklahoma City Thunder season and 2015\u201316 Oklahoma City Thunder season\n\nWith the 21st and 29th picks in the 2014 NBA draft, the Thunder selected Mitch McGary from Michigan and Josh Huestis from Stanford. \"He brings energy, passion, and great basketball IQ and toughness what we value\" said Presti on drafting McGary.[43] Oklahoma City also signed Semaj Christon after acquiring his draft rights from the Charlotte Hornets.[44] On July 3, the Thunder signed Sebastian Telfair. But they lost shooting guard Thabo Sefolosha as his contract expired and he agreed to a three-year, $12 million contract with the Atlanta Hawks. Several weeks before the season started, the Thunder suffered a setback as Durant was diagnosed with a Jones fracture in his right foot and missed the first 17 games of the season. During the opening game against the Portland Trail Blazers, Westbrook scored 38 points, but found himself sidelined due to a small fracture in his right hand. He missed 16 games, during which Oklahoma City went 4\u201312. During the middle of the season Westbrook and Durant both came back, and similarly suffered more injuries. Durant was ruled out of the rest of the season in March, deciding to have foot surgery. Westbrook also had to undergo surgery in early March, to repair a fracture in the zygomatic arch bone of his right cheek. Several days later he returned and recorded several triple-doubles on his way to Western Conference Player of the Month honors from February to April. He also won the 2014\u20132015 NBA scoring title. However, despite the effort, the Thunder missed the playoffs due to a tiebreaker with the New Orleans Pelicans, and Westbrook fell short of the MVP award, finishing fourth in voting. They finished with a 45\u201337 record. On April 22, 2015, Scott Brooks was fired as the Thunder head coach. Billy Donovan was hired on April 30, 2015. This was Donovan's first major NBA coaching job, after he initially accepted and then left the Orlando Magic job in 2007.[45][46] With the 14th and the 48th picks in the 2015 NBA draft, the Thunder selected Cameron Payne from Murray State and Dakari Johnson from Kentucky. With Billy Donovan as the team's head coach the Thunder won the Northwest Division and clinched the third seed in the Western Conference. The team reached the Western Conference Finals for the fourth time in a span of six seasons, but was eliminated by the Golden State Warriors in seven games, after having a 3\u20131 series lead.\n\n\n\n### 2016\u20132017: Durant's departure and Westbrook's MVP season[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016\u201317 Oklahoma City Thunder season\n\nAfter much speculation on the future of free agent superstar Kevin Durant, he announced on July 4, 2016, that he was joining the Warriors. The move to join the 73-win team from last season was heavily criticized by the public and sports media, with many comparing the move to LeBron James' 2010 off-season departure from Cleveland to the Miami Heat.[47] On July 7, Durant was officially introduced by the Warriors organization[48] and signed a two-year, $54.3 million contract,[49] with a player option after the first year.[50]\n\n\nOn August 4, 2016, Westbrook agreed to a three-year extension to remain with the Thunder.[51]\nWith an average of 31.6 points, 10.4 assists and 10.7 rebounds, Westbrook became the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double for an entire NBA regular season, and only the second in NBA history (the other being Robertson). On April 2, 2017, Westbrook tied Oscar Robertson's record for most triple-doubles in an NBA season (41); he broke the record on April 9 against the Denver Nuggets, marking his 42nd triple-double of the season. Westbrook, in that game, also hit the game-winning buzzer beater from 36 feet, ending the Nuggets' playoffs hopes and securing the Thunder's third-seed matchup with the Houston Rockets in the NBA playoffs. Oklahoma City lost the playoff series in the first round to the Rockets 4\u20131. Despite the team's loss, Westbrook averaged a +14 while on the court and a triple-double during the series and was named league MVP after the season.\n\n\n\n### 2017\u20132019: The Westbrook and George era[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2017\u201318 Oklahoma City Thunder season and 2018\u201319 Oklahoma City Thunder season\n\nIn the 2017 NBA draft, the Thunder selected guard Terrance Ferguson with the 21st pick, and signed him to a four-year rookie-scale contract.[52]\n\n\nTo further bolster the roster and improve Westbrook's supporting cast, the Thunder's front office made a series of aggressive moves to reshape the team. On July 6, 2017, the Thunder acquired four-time All-Star forward Paul George in a trade with the Indiana Pacers in exchange for guard Victor Oladipo and forward Domantas Sabonis.[53] The team then signed veteran point guard Raymond Felton and sharp-shooting power forward Patrick Patterson in free agency on July 10.[54][55] Finally, on September 25, the Thunder acquired ten-time All-Star forward Carmelo Anthony from the New York Knicks in exchange for center Enes Kanter, forward Doug McDermott, and a 2018 second-round draft pick they had previously acquired from the Chicago Bulls in the Cameron Payne trade.[56][57] On September 29, 2017, the Thunder signed its star point guard Russell Westbrook to a five-year extension.[58] The Thunder finished the 2017\u201318 season with a 48\u201334 record and lost to the Utah Jazz 4\u20132 in the first round of the playoffs.\n\n\nIn the 2018 NBA draft, the Thunder selected guard Devon Hall with the 53rd pick and forward Kevin Hervey with the 57th pick.[59] Hall did not sign with the Thunder, instead signing with the Cairns Taipans of the Australian National Basketball League.[60] Hervey signed with the Thunder's NBA G League affiliate, Oklahoma City Blue.[61] Additionally, the Thunder traded a 2019 second-round pick to acquire Hamidou Diallo, who had been selected by the Brooklyn Nets with the 45th pick.[62] Diallo signed a three-year contract with the Thunder.[63]\n\n\nOn July 6, 2018, Paul George re-signed with the Thunder.[64] In July 2018, the Thunder traded forward Carmelo Anthony and a 2022 protected first-round pick to the Atlanta Hawks in a three-way trade. In the trade, the Thunder acquired guard Dennis Schr\u00f6der from the Hawks and forward Timoth\u00e9 Luwawu-Cabarrot from the Philadelphia 76ers.[65] The Thunder also acquired guard Deonte Burton, signing him to a two-way contract with the Oklahoma City Blue.[66] Additionally, the Thunder acquired center Nerlens Noel in free agency,[67] and traded for Abdel Nader from the Boston Celtics.[68]\n\n\n\n### 2019\u2013present: Post-Westbrook rebuild[edit]\n\n\n#### 2019\u20132020: Chris Paul year[edit]\n\n\nGeneral manager Sam Presti traded Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers on July 10, 2019. In return, they received Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and a record collection of future first-round draft picks. It was reported after the trade was announced that George had privately requested the trade to the Clippers as a result of superstar free agent Kawhi Leonard convincing George to team up with him on the Clippers.[69] They also traded forward Jerami Grant to the Denver Nuggets for a 2020 protected first-round pick.\n\n\nAfter the George trade, general manager Presti sensed that the future of the franchise was in jeopardy as the team could not seriously contend with Westbrook as the lone star. On July 16, the Thunder traded Westbrook to the Houston Rockets. In exchange, the Thunder received Chris Paul, two future first-round draft picks, and the rights to two future pick swaps with the Rockets.[70]\n\n\nPaul made the 2020 NBA All-Star Game as a reserve, making it his tenth selection, and his first since 2016.\n\n\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Thunder were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season.[71]\n\n\n\n#### 2020\u2013present: Young core rebuild[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the season, Billy Donovan's contract was not renewed, and both sides agreed to mutually part ways.[72] On November 11, 2020, Mark Daigneault was promoted from the assistant coach position to become the new head coach.[73]\n\n\nBefore the start of the 2020\u201321 NBA season, Chris Paul was traded to the Phoenix Suns for Kelly Oubre Jr., Ricky Rubio, two additional players and a 2022 first-round draft pick.[74] Oubre, Rubio and several Thunder veterans from the 2019\u201320 season, such as Steven Adams, Dennis Schr\u00f6der and Danilo Gallinari, were traded away in the next several days as well, with Thunder receiving draft picks as part of compensation in most of those transactions. Overall, Thunder executed 14 separate trades after the end of the 2019\u201320 season and before the 2021 trade deadline.\n\n\n\n![](image)Shai Gilgeous-Alexander\nFive-time NBA All-Star Al Horford was one of the players acquired before the season.[75] After one season, he was also traded for four-time All-Star Kemba Walker,[76] with Thunder acquiring first-round draft picks as well in both transactions.\n\n\nBy the summer of 2021, Thunder accumulated 36 total draft picks over the next seven years, 18 in the first round and 18 in the second.[77] In the 2021 NBA draft, Thunder drafted Josh Giddey, Alperen \u015eeng\u00fcn and Tre Mann with their first-round picks, \u015eeng\u00fcn was then traded for two future draft picks. On August 6, 2021, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander signed a 5-year maximum contract extension worth $172 million.[78][79] On the same day, Thunder waived Kemba Walker after he agreed to a buy-out.[80]\n\n\nOn December 2, 2021, the Thunder suffered the largest loss in NBA history, falling 152\u201379 to the Memphis Grizzlies. This 73-point defeat broke the previous NBA record. Eight months prior, the Thunder set the record for the largest home loss in NBA history, losing to the Indiana Pacers by a margin of 57 points (152\u201395).[81] As a result, the Thunder hold the unfortunate distinction of having the largest losses both at home and on the road in NBA history.[82]\n\n\nAt the 2022 NBA draft, the Thunder used their second overall pick to select Chet Holmgren and the twelfth pick to select Jalen Williams.[83] On August 25, 2022, it was announced that Holmgren would miss the entire 2022\u201323 NBA season due to a Lisfranc injury in his foot that occurred during a Pro-am game.[84] In the 2022\u201323 season, the Thunder finished regular season with the 10th-best record in the Western conference, qualifying for the play-in-tournament. After defeating the New Orleans Pelicans in their first play-in game,[85] the Thunder lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves and did not qualify for the playoffs.[86]\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the Thunder.

It was finished at a cost of $89.2 million.[88]\n\n\nA plan for such build-out improvements began in 2007. It came in the wake of the acquisition of the Seattle SuperSonics by an Oklahoma City-based ownership group the previous October. A city ballot initiative approved by a 62 percent margin on March 4, 2008, extended a prior one-cent city sales tax for a period of 15 months in order to fund $101 million in budgeted improvements to the arena and a separate $20 million practice facility for a relocated franchise.[89]\n\n\nRenovation work on the arena was delayed by a sales tax-receipts shortfall during the 2008\u201310 economic crisis.[90] Revised plans limited the size of a new glass entryway and eliminated a practice court to accommodate the shortfall.[91] Major construction work on the arena expansion was also delayed from the summer of 2010 to the summer of 2011. Seating capacity of the stadium is 18,203 for professional NBA basketball games.\n\n\nSimilar revisions were made to the plans for the Thunder's separate practice facility, for a total savings of approximately $14 million.[92] The Thunder's practice facility completion date was pushed back to approximately March 2011.[93] Chesapeake Energy, which had naming rights after 2011 filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 28, 2020, with a debt of $9 billion, with the effect on the arena's naming rights not yet known at that time.[94] However, on April 20, 2021, the company terminated the deal as part of its corporate restructuring. The arena retained its name during the Thunder's search for a new sponsor.[95]\n\n\nOn July 27, 2021, it was announced that Paycom will acquire the naming rights for the arena for a 15-year period, renaming it Paycom Center.[96]\n\n\nOn September 12, 2023, Oklahoma City announced they were planning on building a new downtown arena for the Thunder at the cost of $900 million and with an estimated 2029 opening.[97]\n\n\n\n## Mascots[edit]\n\n\n*Note: All mascots used before 2008 were used by the original Seattle SuperSonics franchise.*\n\n\n\n* Wheedle, 1978\u20131985\n* Squatch, 1993\u20132008\n\n\n### Rumble the Bison[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rumble the Bison\n\nOn February 17, 2009, Rumble the Bison was introduced as the Oklahoma City Thunder mascot during halftime of a game against the New Orleans Hornets.[98] Rumble was the winner of the 2008\u20132009 NBA Mascot of the Year.[99]\n\n\n\n## Fanbase[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2012 NBA Finals, sportswriter Bill Simmons published a piece on the team's fan base in his ESPN-sponsored Web outlet, *Grantland.com*, in which he noted the unusual enthusiasm of the city for its team:\n\n\n\n\n> With the possible exception of Portland, no NBA team means more to its city. This goes beyond having the loudest fans. There's genuine devotion here. These people arrived a good 45 minutes early for last night's Game 1\u2014and by \"these people\" I mean \"everyone with a ticket\"\u2014then clapped their way through pregame warm-ups with such infectious enthusiasm that I remember saying to a friend, \"No way these yahoos keep this up for three hours, they're going to burn out.\" Wrong. You know what burned out? My eardrums. My head is still ringing.[100]\n> \n> \n\n\nSimmons speculated that the Oklahoma City bombing played a major part in the team's culture, noting that Thunder general manager Sam Presti has every new Thunder player visit the Oklahoma City National Memorial, and encourages players to look into the stands and consider that many of the team's fans were personally affected by the event. He also noted, however, that the fact that the Thunder is the only team from Oklahoma City (or indeed the state of Oklahoma) in one of the nation's four major leagues contributes mightily to the city's devotion.[100]\n\n\nThunder fans are also reportedly much more likely to attend major home games than most other NBA fanbases. According to a source in the ticket industry, only five percent of tickets to the 2012 NBA conference finals listed for sale on secondary market sites such as StubHub were for Thunder home games, and for every ticket listed for a Thunder home game in the 2012 NBA Finals, 10 tickets for Heat home games were listed.[100]\n\n\nThe team and its fanbase regularly use the slogan \"Thunder Up!\" which was prominently displayed on T-shirts during the 2012 playoffs.\n\n\nHowever, as of late the attendance has suffered. They ranked 28th out of 30 teams in attendance in the 2021\u201322 season, only filling under 82 percent of their arena.[101]\n\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Oklahoma City Thunder roster*** v\n* t\n* e\n\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| C | 15 | Biyombo, Bismack\u00a0(FA)\n | 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m)\n | 255\u00a0lb (116\u00a0kg)\n | 1992-08-28\n | DR Congo |\n| F | 13 | Dieng, Ousmane | 6\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (2.08\u00a0m)\n | 205\u00a0lb (93\u00a0kg)\n | 2003-05-21\n | France |\n| G/F | 5 | Dort, Luguentz | 6\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (1.93\u00a0m)\n | 215\u00a0lb (98\u00a0kg)\n | 1999-04-19\n | Arizona State |\n| G | 14 | Flagler, Adam\u00a0(TW, FA)\n | 6\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in (1.91\u00a0m)\n | 180\u00a0lb (82\u00a0kg)\n | 1999-12-01\n | Baylor |\n| G | 3 | Giddey, Josh | 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m)\n | 205\u00a0lb (93\u00a0kg)\n | 2002-10-10\n | Australia |\n| G | 2 | Gilgeous-Alexander, Shai | 6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (1.98\u00a0m)\n | 180\u00a0lb (82\u00a0kg)\n | 1998-07-12\n | Kentucky |\n| F | 33 | Hayward, Gordon\u00a0(FA)\n | 6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in (2.01\u00a0m)\n | 225\u00a0lb (102\u00a0kg)\n | 1990-03-23\n | Butler |\n| F/C | 7 | Holmgren, Chet | 7\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in (2.16\u00a0m)\n | 208\u00a0lb (94\u00a0kg)\n | 2002-05-01\n | Gonzaga |\n| G | 11 | Joe, Isaiah | 6\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (1.93\u00a0m)\n | 165\u00a0lb (75\u00a0kg)\n | 1999-07-02\n | Arkansas |\n| G | 18 | Johnson, Keyontae\u00a0(TW, FA)\n | 6\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in (1.96\u00a0m)\n | 238\u00a0lb (108\u00a0kg)\n | 2000-05-24\n | Kansas State |\n| F | 50 | Muscala, Mike\u00a0(FA)\n | 6\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in (2.11\u00a0m)\n | 240\u00a0lb (109\u00a0kg)\n | 1991-07-01\n | Bucknell |\n| C | 30 | Sarr, Olivier\u00a0(TW, FA)\n | 7\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in (2.13\u00a0m)\n | 240\u00a0lb (109\u00a0kg)\n | 1999-02-20\n | Kentucky |\n| G | 22 | Wallace, Cason | 6\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (1.93\u00a0m)\n | 193\u00a0lb (88\u00a0kg)\n | 2003-11-07\n | Kentucky |\n| G/F | 12 | Waters, Lindy III | 6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (1.98\u00a0m)\n | 215\u00a0lb (98\u00a0kg)\n | 1997-07-28\n | Oklahoma State |\n| G | 21 | Wiggins, Aaron | 6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (1.98\u00a0m)\n | 200\u00a0lb (91\u00a0kg)\n | 1999-01-02\n | Maryland |\n| G/F | 8 | Williams, Jalen | 6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (1.98\u00a0m)\n | 211\u00a0lb (96\u00a0kg)\n | 2001-04-14\n | Santa Clara |\n| F/C | 6 | Williams, Jaylin | 6\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (2.08\u00a0m)\n | 240\u00a0lb (109\u00a0kg)\n | 2002-06-29\n | Arkansas |\n| G/F | 34 | Williams, Kenrich | 6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (1.98\u00a0m)\n | 210\u00a0lb (95\u00a0kg)\n | 1994-12-02\n | TCU |\n\n | Head coach* Mark Daigneault\n\nAssistant coach(es)* David Akinyooye\n* Dave Bliss\n* Chip Engelland\n* Grant Gibbs\n* Connor Johnson\n* Eric Maynor\n* Mike Wilks\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nLegend\n* **(DP)** Unsigned draft pick\n* **(FA)** Free agent\n* **(S)** Suspended\n* **(GL)** On assignment to G League affiliate\n* **(TW)** Two-way affiliate player\n* ![Injured](image) Injured\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nRoster  Last transaction: April 16, 2024\n |\n\n\n### Former players[edit]\n\n\nFor the complete list of players, see Seattle SuperSonics all-time roster and Oklahoma City Thunder all-time roster.\n\n### Retained draft rights[edit]\n\n\nThe Thunder hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA.

On March 20, 2019, the club officially retired number 4 in honor of Nick Collison, who played for the team from 2003 to 2018.[103]\n\n\nAs the Thunder's original iteration, the Seattle SuperSonics had retired six numbers. In addition, the SuperSonics awarded an honorary microphone to longtime broadcaster Bob Blackburn, who had called the majority of the team's games from 1967 through 1992.[104][105]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Oklahoma City Thunder retired numbers** |\n| No.\n | Player\n | Position\n | Tenure\n | Date\n |\n| **1** | Gus Williams | G | 1977\u20131984 | March 26, 2004\n |\n| **4** | Nick Collison | F | 2003\u20132018 | March 20, 2019\n |\n| **10** | Nate McMillan | G | 1986\u20131998 1 | March 24, 1999\n |\n| **19** | Lenny Wilkens | G | 1968\u20131972 2 | October 19, 1979\n |\n| **24** | Spencer Haywood | F | 1970\u20131975 | February 26, 2007\n |\n| **32** | Fred Brown | G | 1971\u20131984 | November 6, 1986\n |\n| **43** | Jack Sikma | C | 1977\u20131986 | November 21, 1992\n |\n| ![](image) | Bob Blackburn | Broadcaster | 1967\u20131992 |  |\n\n\n**Notes:**\n\n\n\n* 1 *Served as head coach (2000\u20132005).*\n* 2 *Served as head coach (1969\u20131972; 1977\u20131985).*\n* The NBA retired Bill Russell's No. 6 for all its member teams on August 11, 2022.[106][107]\n\n\n## Staff[edit]\n\n\n### Head coaches[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Oklahoma City Thunder head coaches\n\n### General managers[edit]\n\n\nFor the complete list of Seattle SuperSonics general managers, see: *Seattle SuperSonics general managers*.\n\n\n\n* 2008\u2013present: Sam Presti\n\n\n## Logos and uniforms[edit]\n\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder unveiled their first logo on September 3, 2008. According to majority owner Clay Bennett, the team's logo takes several of its elements from other Oklahoma sports teams, such as the Oklahoma Sooners and Oklahoma State Cowboys and Cowgirls.[23][108][109] The uniform design was unveiled on September 29, 2008.[110][111][112]\n\n\nAn alternate uniform was unveiled on November 8, 2012, featuring only navy blue and white colors. Unlike their regular uniforms, the wordmarks on the alternate are written vertically.[113][114]\n\n\nA second alternate uniform was unveiled on March 1, 2015. A white uniform with sleeves, it features the Thunder partial logo in the center of the chest, and the shorts showcase bolts in light blue and sunset colors.[115]\n\n\nA third alternate uniform was unveiled on September 25, 2015. A sunset-colored uniform, it features the Oklahoma City abbreviation \"OKC\" in navy block letters trimmed in white. On the back of the jersey, player names sit below the numbers. The shorts display a sunset base with navy panels down the side showcasing the Thunder partial logo on each leg. The Thunder wore the sunset alternates for 18 games in the 2015\u20132016 season, including all 13 of its Sunday games.[116]\n\n\nMoving to Nike in 2017, the Thunder kept their existing white (\"Association\") and blue (\"Icon\") uniforms almost intact with the exception of the \"OKC\" abbreviation on the beltline and truncated shoulder stripes.[117] The team also released a new alternate \"Statement\" uniform with an italicized \"OKC\" lettering in sunset orange and a navy base with blue gradients that evoke sound waves generated from the team's fan base.[118]\n\n\nThe Thunder also collaborated with Nike to produce annual \"City\" edition uniforms that intend to pay tribute to local cultures or team traditions. The 2017\u201318 \"City\" uniform featured a grey base with sunset orange and blue lines that were inspired by the Thunder's uptempo style.[119] For 2018\u201319, the Thunder's \"City\" uniform featured a turquoise base and bold white lettering with navy and sunset orange trim; the uniform was inspired by Oklahoma's Native American heritage.[120]\n\n\nNike also released an \"Earned\" uniform starting with the 2018\u201319 season and were only given to the 16 teams who qualified in the 2018 NBA playoffs. The Thunder's \"Earned\" uniform was a basic palette swap of the team's \"Statement\" uniforms, featuring a sunset orange base and navy letters.[121]\n\n\nBeginning with the 2019\u201320 season, the Thunder unveiled new uniforms. The white \"Association\" uniform now featured the city name in front along with the outline of the state of Oklahoma on the beltline. The front of the blue \"Icon\" uniform now reads the team name in front while keeping the OKC acronym on the beltline. Their sunset orange \"Earned\" uniforms from the previous season became the basis of their new \"Statement\" uniform, albeit with lighter blue lettering. A new \"City\" uniform for the season commemorated the 25th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing and it featured a black and gold palette.[3]\n\n\nThe \"City\" uniform for 2020\u201321 contained a black base along with the Thunder's signature blue and orange colors splashed throughout. The uniform featured the state name \"Oklahoma\" in front as homage to the state itself.[122] As in 2019, the Thunder's appearance in the 2020 NBA playoffs gave them an \"Earned\" uniform for the 2021 season. The uniform featured a navy blue base with \"Thunder\" written in white with light blue drop shadows. Orange was noticeably absent on the uniform.[123]\n\n\nThe Thunder's 2021\u201322 \"City\" uniform mixed various elements from their previous and current uniforms. The white and gray uniform featured the vertically arranged \"OKC\" lettering on the right chest (taken from the 2012\u201316 navy alternates), the white and gray patterns within the \"OKC\" lettering (taken from the 2017\u201319 \"Statement\" uniforms), the white and gray sash on the left leg (taken from the 2018\u201319 \"City\" uniforms), and the generic logo the Thunder first used in 2008 on the waist.[124]\n\n\nFor the Thunder's 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform, they went with a black base, blue letters and red, orange and white accents in honor of the people of Oklahoma.[125]\n\n\n\n## Television and radio[edit]\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Thunder Radio Network\n\nAll Thunder games are broadcast on the Thunder Radio Network, fronted by flagship stations WWLS-FM 98.1 and KWPN AM 640 in Oklahoma City. Matt Pinto is the radio voice of the Thunder.[126]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nFor their first two seasons, the Thunder's TV broadcasts were split between Fox Sports Oklahoma (a regional fork of Fox Sports Southwest), which broadcast most of the games, and independent station KSBI (channel 52), with around 65 Thunder games airing during the season and more than half of the games available in HD on Fox Sports Oklahoma, along with other team-related programming such as pre-game shows. Around 15 to 20 regular-season games were broadcast over the air on KSBI, which had a network of re-broadcasters spanning the entire state. All televised games are called by Brian Davis on play-by-play and Michael Cage as color commentator.[127][128] During the 2009\u201310 season, KSBI telecast all Thunder games it aired in high definition (KSBI had previously aired in HD the first regular-season game played at the Ford Center\u2014against the Milwaukee Bucks on October 29, 2008\u2014while all other games during the 2008\u201309 season were telecast on KSBI in standard definition).\n\n\nOn August 3, 2010, the Thunder signed a new exclusive multi-year agreement with Fox Sports Oklahoma (since rebranded as Bally Sports Oklahoma as of 2021), beginning with the 2010\u201311 season, ending the team's broadcasts on KSBI.[129] On October 22, 2012, the Thunder announced that Lesley McCaslin would be the new Thunder sideline reporter.[130] On July 21, 2014, the Thunder announced that Long would not return to be its TV color commentator on Fox Sports Oklahoma.[131] On September 17, 2014, the Oklahoma City Thunder announced that 15-year NBA veteran Michael Cage would be the new color analyst, joining Brian Davis on television and Matt Pinto on the radio when the game is exclusive to a national television broadcast.[132]\n\n\nDavis was replaced as the television play-by-play announcer by Chris Fisher prior to the 2018\u201319 season.[133]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** \"History: Team by Team\u2013Oklahoma City Thunder\" (PDF). *2019-20 Official NBA Guide* (PDF).

The Nuggets compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Northwest Division of the Western Conference. The team was founded as the **Denver Larks** in 1967 as a charter franchise of the American Basketball Association (ABA) but changed their name to the **Rockets** before the first season.[14] The Rockets then changed their name again to the Nuggets in 1974.[15] After the name change, the Nuggets played for the final ABA Championship title in 1976, losing to the New York Nets.\n\n\nThe team has had some periods of success, qualifying for the ABA Playoffs in every season of the ABA's existence, losing in the 1976 ABA Finals to the New York Nets.[16] The team joined the NBA in 1976 after the ABA\u2013NBA merger and qualified for the NBA playoffs in nine consecutive seasons in the 1980s and ten consecutive seasons from 2004 to 2013.[16] In 2023, the Nuggets, led by Nikola Joki\u0107 and Jamal Murray, reached their first NBA Finals and defeated the Miami Heat to capture the franchise's first NBA championship. The Nuggets were the last of the four surviving former ABA teams to reach the NBA Finals, and the second former ABA team to win an NBA title (after the San Antonio Spurs).[16][17] The Nuggets play their home games at Ball Arena,[3] which they share with the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League (NHL) and the Colorado Mammoth of the National Lacrosse League (NLL).\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\n### 1967\u20131969: Franchise background and founding[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the 1948\u201349 National Basketball League (NBL) season, the original Denver Nuggets were founded. Following that season, the NBL merged with the Basketball Association of America (BAA), with the newly unified circuit named the National Basketball Association to reflect the merger. The Denver Nuggets played the 1949\u201350 season as one of the charter NBA teams before folding. This franchise's records and statistics remain separate from the modern-day Denver Nuggets.\n\n\n\n![](image)Byron Beck, a University of Denver alumnus, is shown wearing the \"**Denver Rockets**\" uniform\nThe current franchise traces its roots to 1967, when one of the American Basketball Association (ABA)'s charter franchises was awarded to a group in Kansas City, Missouri, headed by Southern California businessman James Trindle. However, Trindle was unable to find a suitable arena in the Kansas City area. League commissioner George Mikan suggested moving the team to Denver. After agreeing to name Denver resident and former NBA player Vince Boryla as general manager, Trindle moved his team to Denver as the Denver Larks, named after Colorado's state bird.[18] The Trindle group was severely undercapitalized, leading Mikan to order the Larks to post a $100,000 performance bond or lose the franchise. Hours before the deadline, Trindle sold a \u2154 controlling interest to Denver trucking magnate Bill Ringsby for $350,000. Ringsby then renamed the team the Rockets, after his company's long-haul trucks.[19]\n\n\n\n### 1969\u20131976: ABA years[edit]\n\n\nPlaying at the Denver Auditorium Arena, the Rockets had early successes on the court, developing a strong fan base along the way.[20] However, the team had a history of early playoff exits and only once played in the ABA championship series.\n\n\nEarly, Denver had a solid lineup led by Byron Beck and Larry Jones, then later by Beck and Ralph Simpson. Lonnie Wright of the American Football League's Denver Broncos signed with the Rockets during that first season and became the first player to play professional football and basketball in the same season. Wright played four seasons with Denver.[20] Controversial rookie Spencer Haywood joined the team for the 1969\u201370 season. Haywood was one of the first players to turn pro before graduating from college, and the NBA initially refused to let him play in the league. Haywood averaged nearly 30 points and 19.5 rebounds per game in his only ABA season, being named ABA MVP, ABA rookie of the year, as well as the All-Star Game MVP. The team finished 51\u201333, winning their division, before exiting the playoffs in the 2nd round.\n\n\nJust before the start of the 1970\u201371 season, Haywood signed with the Seattle SuperSonics, jumping to the NBA. The team tumbled to a 30\u201354 record and attendance suffered.[20]\n\n\n\n#### Becoming the Denver Nuggets[edit]\n\n\nRingsby sold the team to San Diego businessmen Frank Goldberg and Bud Fischer in 1972.[18] In 1974, in anticipation of moving into the NBA, and the new McNichols Arena, the franchise held a contest to choose a new team nickname, as \"Rockets\" was already in use by the Houston Rockets. The winning choice was \"Nuggets\", in honor of the original Nuggets team in Denver from 1948 to 1950, the last year as a charter member of the NBA. Their new logo was a miner \"discovering\" an ABA ball. Goldberg and Fischer in turn sold the team to a local investment group in 1976.\n\n\nWith the drafting and signing of future Hall of Fame player David Thompson out of North Carolina State and Marvin Webster, and the acquisitions of Dan Issel and Bobby Jones, with Larry Brown coaching, they had their best seasons in team history in their first two as the Nuggets. Playing in the Denver Auditorium Arena for the last season the 1974\u201375 team went 65\u201316, including a 40\u20132 record at home. However, a quick playoff exit followed.[21]\n\n\nIn 1975\u201376, playing at their new arena, the Nuggets edged the reigning champion Kentucky Colonels four games to three to make the 1976 ABA finals for the first time. Eventually, they lost to the New York Nets and Julius Erving.[21] They did not get a second chance to win an ABA league championship, as the ABA\u2013NBA merger took place after the 1975\u201376 season. The Nuggets, Nets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs were merged into the NBA. The Spirits of St. Louis and Kentucky Colonels were disbanded.[22]\n\n\n\n### 1976\u20131982: Early NBA years[edit]\n\n\nThe Nuggets and Nets had actually applied to join the NBA in 1975, but were forced to stay in the ABA by a court order. The Nuggets continued their strong play early on in the NBA, as they won division titles in their first two seasons in the league, and missed a third by a single game. However, neither of these teams were ultimately successful in the postseason. Similarly to the other new NBA teams, the Nuggets were saddled with stiff financial obligations upon joining the NBA, including a $2 million entry fee. Red McCombs bought the team in 1978.\n\n\nIn 1979, Brown left the team, helping usher in a brief decline in their performance. It ended in 1981, when they hired Doug Moe as a head coach. Moe brought with him a \"motion offense\" philosophy, a style of play focusing on attempting to move the ball until someone got open. Moe was also known for not paying as much attention to defense as other NBA coaches. The offense helped the team become highly competitive. During the 1980s, the Nuggets often[*quantify*] scored in excess of 115 points a game, and during the 1981\u201382 season, they scored at least 100 points in every game. The NBA-record streak was halted at 136 consecutive games.[23] During the 1981\u201382 season, the Nuggets set the league scoring record for the highest points per game average at 126.5 points.\n\n\n\n### 1982\u20131989: The Alex English era[edit]\n\n\nAnchored by scoring machines Alex English and Kiki Vandeweghe at the two forward spots, and Dan Issel at center, Denver led the league in scoring, with English and Vandeweghe both averaging above 25 points per game. It was a novel strategy, allowing the Nuggets to top the Midwest Division and qualify for the playoffs during that span. (On December 13, 1983, the Nuggets and the visiting Detroit Pistons combined for an NBA record 370 points, with Detroit winning in triple overtime, 186\u2013184.) At the end of the season, English won the NBA scoring title, becoming the only Nugget to win the award despite the heavily favored offensive play of Doug Moe. In 1984\u201385, they made it to the Western Conference finals after being perennial playoff contenders, and they lost in five games to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\nVandeweghe was traded before the 1984\u201385 season to the Portland Trail Blazers for 6\u20133 rebounding guard Fat Lever, undersized power forward Calvin Natt and center Wayne Cooper. Spearheaded by Alex English and supported by the three new acquisitions and defensive specialists Bill Hanzlik and TR Dunn, the team replicated its success in the Western Conference despite the loss of Vandeweghe. They even managed to win 54 games in the 1987\u201388 season, the most they had ever won as an NBA team. However, the Mavericks eliminated the Nuggets in the second round of the 1988 NBA Playoffs. McCombs sold the team to Sidney Shlenker in 1985. Shlenker, in turn, sold the team to COMSAT in 1989.\n\n\n\n### 1989\u20131991: A period of decline[edit]\n\n\nMoe left the team in 1990, and was replaced by Paul Westhead. Westhead also believed in a \"run and gun\" style of play, and gave the green light for players like Michael Adams and Chris Jackson to light up the scoreboards within seconds of possession.\n\n\nHowever, Westhead cared even less about defense than Moe. As a result, the Nuggets gave up points so quickly that even their prolific offense could not keep up. They finished with the worst record in the league during the 1990\u201391 season, despite setting many scoring records. As an insult, many sportswriters nicknamed the team at the time as the \"Enver Nuggets\" (as in no \"D\", or no defense).\n\n\n\n### 1991\u20131996: The Dikembe Mutombo era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dikembe Mutombo was drafted by the Nuggets in 1991.\nDenver took a positive step in rebuilding by drafting Georgetown University center Dikembe Mutombo in 1991. Mutombo finished runner-up to Larry Johnson for the NBA rookie of the year that season. Denver finished 24\u201358 that year.\n\n\nDenver fired Westhead prior to the 1992\u201393 season and hired former star player Dan Issel as his successor. The Nuggets had two lottery picks that year and drafted University of Notre Dame forward LaPhonso Ellis and University of Virginia guard Bryant Stith. Denver improved to 36\u201346, just missing the playoffs that year.\n\n\nDenver ditched their rainbow colors for a dark navy, metallic gold and wine color scheme starting in the 1993\u201394 season. Led by Mutombo, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf (who changed his name from Chris Jackson prior to the season), and Ellis, Denver finished with its first winning season since the Doug Moe era at 42\u201340. Denver clinched the eighth seed in the Western Conference playoffs, playing the first place Seattle SuperSonics. Denver was a heavy underdog, having only a couple of players on their roster with actual NBA playoff experience. After dropping the first two games of the five-game set in Seattle, the series returned to Denver. Denver won both games and tied the series at 2. The Nuggets made NBA history in Game 5, upsetting Seattle in overtime 98\u201394. They became the first 8th-seeded team to defeat a 1st-seeded team in NBA playoff history. Denver almost repeated the feat before falling to the Utah Jazz in Game 7 of the second round.\n\n\nDenver acquired Sonics sharp-shooter Dale Ellis in the off-season and drafted University of Michigan guard Jalen Rose. Denver struggled, causing Issel to resign as coach partway into the season. Assistant Coach Gene Littles assumed control for a brief period before relinquishing control to general manager Bernie Bickerstaff. Denver rebounded and earned the eighth seed again in the playoffs, finishing 41\u201341. The Nuggets were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the playoffs that season.\n\n\nFollowing that season, Denver acquired Antonio McDyess in a draft-day trade with the Los Angeles Clippers. McDyess was the face of the franchise for the next few years, as Mutombo left after the 1995\u201396 season for the Atlanta Hawks, Ellis missed the majority of the next few seasons due to recurring knee and leg injuries, Rose was traded to the Indiana Pacers for Mark Jackson, and Abdul-Rauf was traded to the Sacramento Kings prior to the 1996\u201397 season.\n\n\n\n### 1996\u20132003: Another period of struggle[edit]\n\n\nAfter finishing the 1996\u201397 season with the fourth-worst record in the league (21\u201361), the Nuggets sent Antonio McDyess to the Phoenix Suns, and Dale Ellis returned to Seattle. Denver flirted with history in the 1997\u201398, by nearly setting the mark for fewest wins in an 82-game season (11). They tied the then-NBA's all-time worst single-season losing streak at 23\u2014only one game shy of the overall worst mark of 24 by the Cleveland Cavaliers of the early 1980s. The losing streak was later broken by the Cavaliers in 2011 and the Philadelphia 76ers in 2014 with 26 consecutive losses. Several years later, the Nuggets tied for the worst record in the NBA in 2002\u201303, also with the Cavaliers.\n\n\n\n#### New ownerships[edit]\n\n\nThe team's struggles in the late 1990s were due in part to ownership instability. COMSAT bought the NHL's Quebec Nordiques in 1995 and moved them to Denver as the Colorado Avalanche. However, its diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company. In particular, cost overruns associated with the construction of Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent Entertainment Group, the umbrella corporation for its sporting assets, to Liberty Media.[18] However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought the Atlanta Braves), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.[24]\n\n\nAfter almost two years, Ascent sold the Avalanche and Nuggets to Walmart heirs Bill and Nancy Laurie for $400 million. However, a group of Ascent shareholders sued, claiming that the sale price was several million dollars too low. Ascent then agreed to sell the Avalanche and Nuggets to Denver banking tycoon Donald Sturm for $461 million.[25]\n\n\nHowever, a new wrinkle appeared when the city of Denver refused to transfer the parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had bought the teams in his own name, and the city wanted to protect taxpayers in the event Sturm either died or sold the teams. While Sturm was willing to make a long-term commitment to the city, he was not willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.[26] In the meantime, Issel had returned as head coach in 1999, but the protracted ownership negotiations made it difficult for him to rebuild the team. Just before the start of the 1999\u20132000 season, he told reporters there were several personnel moves he simply could not make due to the unstable ownership situation. Under the terms of Strum's purchase agreement, all basketball decisions required the approval of both Ascent/Liberty *and* Sturm.[27]\n\n\nFinally, in July 2000, the Avalanche, Nuggets and Pepsi Center were bought by real estate entrepreneur Stan Kroenke in a $450 million deal.[18] Kroenke is the brother-in-law of the Lauries; his wife Ann is Nancy Laurie's sister. Liberty retained a 6.5% interest. As part of the deal, Kroenke placed the teams into a trust that would ensure the teams will stay in Denver until at least 2025.[26] After the deal, Kroenke organized his sports assets under Kroenke Sports Enterprises.\n\n\n\n### 2003\u20132011: The Carmelo Anthony era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Denver drafted Carmelo Anthony 3rd overall in the 2003 draft.\nIn 2003, the Nuggets drafted future All-Star Carmelo Anthony with the third overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft.[28] That same year, the team also updated their logos and uniforms, with a new color scheme of powder blue, gold and royal blue; the latter color was changed to navy blue in 2008.[29] In just two months of the season, the Nuggets recorded more wins than they had in 5\u00bd months of play in 2002\u201303. Much of the reason for this incredible turnaround were the front-office moves of general manager Kiki Vandeweghe, a former Nuggets player who assumed general manager duties on August 9, 2001.[30] In April, the turnaround was complete as they became the first franchise in NBA history to qualify for the postseason following a sub-20-win campaign the previous year since the NBA went to an 82-game schedule.[30] They were eliminated in the first round four games to one by the Minnesota Timberwolves.[31]\n\n\nOn December 28, 2004, head coach Jeff Bzdelik was fired from the organization and replaced by interim coach, former Los Angeles Lakers player and Los Angeles Sparks head coach Michael Cooper.[32] The Nuggets later hired George Karl as a permanent replacement.[33] Karl led the team to a record of 32\u20138 in the second half of the regular season, which vaulted the team into the playoffs for the second consecutive year.[34]\n\n\nIn the playoffs, however, the Nuggets could not survive the San Antonio Spurs. After winning game one in San Antonio, the Nuggets proceeded to lose the next four games and lost the series 4\u20131.[35] The Nuggets picked 20th in the 2005 NBA draft; it was acquired from the Washington Wizards via the Orlando Magic.[36] Denver selected Julius Hodge with the pick. The Nuggets also had the 22nd overall selection in the draft, in which they selected Jarrett Jack, but sent him to the Portland Trail Blazers for rights to Portland's 27th overall pick, Linas Kleiza.[36]\n\n\nIn 2005\u201306, for the first time in 18 years, the club won the Northwest division title.[37] This placed the team in the third seed of the Western Conference playoffs. Denver played the Los Angeles Clippers who, despite their sixth seeding, had a better regular season record. As a result, the Clippers received home-court advantage. They defeated the Nuggets in 5 games. Shortly after, the Nuggets announced that general manager Kiki Vandeweghe's contract would not be renewed. He was replaced by Mark Warkentien.[38]\n\n\nOn December 18, 2006, team co-captain Carmelo Anthony, shooting guard J. R. Smith and power forward Nen\u00ea were suspended by the NBA (15, 10 and one games respectively) for a fight that occurred in the last two minutes of a game against the New York Knicks two days earlier.[39][40] The fight was sparked by Knicks rookie Mardy Collins, when he tackled J. R. Smith on a breakaway layup. According to Anthony, Knicks coach Isiah Thomas warned him to not go in the paint shortly before the hard foul.[41]\n\n\n\n#### 2006\u20132008: The Anthony and Iverson duo[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Allen Iverson helped Denver to their first 50-win season since 1988.\nOn December 19, 2006, the Nuggets traded Joe Smith, Andre Miller and two first-round draft picks of the 2007 NBA draft to the Philadelphia 76ers for Ivan McFarlin and superstar Allen Iverson (McFarlin was waived immediately following the trade's approval). The moves gave the Nuggets the top two scorers in the league at the time in Anthony and Iverson, who were both scoring over 30 points per game at the time of the trade. On January 11, 2007, Earl Boykins, Julius Hodge and cash considerations were traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, in exchange for point guard Steve Blake. With Iverson, many considered the Nuggets as one of the elite in the West. However, chemistry was an issue, as the Nuggets finished the season with the sixth seed, giving them a first-round matchup against the San Antonio Spurs. In the playoffs, the Nuggets took Game 1 and home-court advantage away from the Spurs. However, as had occurred in the 2005 playoffs, the Spurs bounced back to sweep the next four, as the Nuggets were eliminated in the first round in five games for the fourth straight year.\n\n\nOn March 16, 2008, the Nuggets scored 168 points in a 168\u2013116 home win over Seattle SuperSonics.[42] It was the third-most points scored for a regulation game in NBA history (The Nuggets and the Pistons hold the spot for most combined points scored in a game which was over 360 points total.)[42]\n\n\nThey finished the 2007\u201308 NBA season with exactly 50 wins as well as finishing the first half of that season 25\u201316 (50\u201332 overall record, tied for the third-best all-time Nuggets record since the team officially joined the NBA in 1976), following a 120\u2013111 home victory over the Memphis Grizzlies in the last game of the season.[43] It was the first time since the 1987\u201388 NBA season that the Nuggets finished with at least 50 wins in a season.[43] Denver ended up as the eighth seed in the Western Conference of the 2008 NBA playoffs, and their 50 wins marked the highest win total for an eighth seed in NBA history.[43] It also meant that for the first time in NBA history, all eight playoff seeds in a Conference had at least 50 wins. The Nuggets faced the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers (57\u201325) in the first round. The seven games separating the Nuggets and the Lakers overall records is the closest margin between an eighth seed and a top seed since the NBA went to a 16-team playoff format in 1983\u201384.[43] However, the Lakers swept them in four games, marking the second time in NBA history that a 50-win team was swept in a best-of-seven playoff series in the first round. It was Denver's fifth straight first-round loss.[44][45]\n\n\n\n#### 2008\u20132011: The Anthony and Billups duo[edit]\n\n\nOn July 16, 2008, at the end of the 2007\u201308 NBA season, the Nuggets traded former NBA Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Camby to the Los Angeles Clippers for a second-round draft pick (that was then traded to the New York Knicks for Renaldo Balkman). This trade was to reduce the Nuggets' payroll costs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn November 3, 2008, guard Allen Iverson was traded to the Detroit Pistons for Chauncey Billups, Antonio McDyess, and Cheikh Samb (part of the trade exception from the Marcus Camby trade was used to allow the deal to go through). McDyess was waived though on November 10, 2008, and he returned to Detroit shortly afterwards.\n\n\n\n![](image)Chauncey Billups, acquired in 2008, helped the George Karl/Carmelo Anthony duo to their first playoff series win.\nWith Carmelo Anthony averaging 22.8 points per game and Billups averaging 6.4 assists in the 2008\u201309 NBA season the Nuggets accomplished a great number of franchise milestones. Their 54\u201328 record matched the most wins the franchise had gotten since their induction in the NBA; their 27\u201314 start was also a record for wins in the first half of a season. This also marked the first time in the franchise's history the team had back-to-back 50-win seasons. They led the Northwest division for much of the season, eventually winning the division and placing #2 in the Western Conference, matching the highest the team has ever been seeded for the playoffs. General manager Mark Warkentien won the NBA Executive of the Year Award for the Nuggets' improvement. They won Game 1 of the playoffs against the New Orleans Hornets, the first time they had home-court advantage since 1988 and also, the 29-point victory was the largest victory for any team for Game 1 of the first round of the 2009 NBA playoffs. Chauncey Billups set a Nuggets franchise record with the most three-pointers in a playoff game with 8, and his 19 three-pointers in total is also a Nuggets record for threes made in a playoff series.[46] They went on to beat the Hornets in 5, including a 58-point victory in Game 4 which matched the most lopsided win in NBA playoff history. They then went on to beat the sixth seed Dallas Mavericks four games to one in the Conference Semifinals to make their first trip to the Western Conference Finals since 1985. That was also the first time the Nuggets had ever led 3\u20130 in a best-of-seven series. Up to that point, they held an NBA Playoffs-high in three-pointers made and a 16-point average margin of victory, the largest average margin of victory in the first 10 playoff games in NBA Playoff history. They lost the first game of the Western Conference Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers but won the second game to tie the series. Anthony became the first Denver player to score at least 30 points in five consecutive playoff games since the Nuggets joined the NBA in 1976. They lost the series 4\u20132, ending Denver's longest playoff run in team history.[47]\n\n\nIn the 2009 NBA draft, the Nuggets traded a first-round draft pick acquired from the Charlotte Bobcats to the Minnesota Timberwolves for the rights to rookie Ty Lawson, who was drafted 18th overall. On July 13, 2009, the Nuggets traded a second-round draft pick to the Detroit Pistons for Arron Afflalo (part of the trade exception from the Iverson trade was used to allow the deal to go through) and Walter Sharpe. Afflalo replaced starting guard Dahntay Jones, who signed with the Indiana Pacers.[48] However, on August 10, the Nuggets lost forward Linas Kleiza, who signed with Olympiacos Piraeus of the Greek League.[49]\n\n\nThe 2009\u201310 season saw Anthony average 28.2 points per game and Billups average a career-high 19.6 points per game. In the opening two games of the season, Anthony totaled 71 points, scoring 30 points in the home opener and 41 the next night, in wins against division rivals Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers, respectively. Anthony became one of two players in the Nuggets' history to open with more than 70 points through two games (Alex English also accomplished the feat). It was also only the second time since 1987 that the Nuggets started the season 2\u20130.[50] They later went 3\u20130, 4\u20130, and 5\u20130 for the first time since 1985 after defeating the Memphis Grizzlies, Indiana Pacers, and New Jersey Nets respectively. Despite injuries that caused all three captains \u2013 Carmelo Anthony, Chauncey Billups, and Kenyon Martin \u2013 to miss a total of 46 games, and then later on in the second half of the season the absence of head coach George Karl, who underwent treatment for neck and throat cancer, the Nuggets were still able to win 53 games (third consecutive 50-win season, a Nuggets first) for the season which gave them a second consecutive Northwest division title and finished as the fourth seed in the West Conference. However, they were eliminated by the Utah Jazz 4\u20132, their sixth first-round elimination in 7 seasons. Anthony averaged a career-high 30.7 points per game in the playoffs.\n\n\nOn July 14, 2010, the Nuggets bolstered their frontcourt depth by signing Al Harrington.[51] During the 2010 off-season, Masai Ujiri replaced Mark Warkentien as the general manager, while Josh Kroenke was named team president.\n\n\n\n#### 2011\u20132012: The departure of Carmelo Anthony[edit]\n\n\nOn February 22, 2011, after months of speculation that he wanted to leave the Nuggets, Carmelo Anthony was traded along with Chauncey Billups, Anthony Carter, Shelden Williams and Renaldo Balkman to the New York Knicks in a multi-player deal also involving the Minnesota Timberwolves in which the Nuggets received Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Timofey Mozgov and Kosta Koufos. On the day when the trade was done, the Nuggets were left with nine players to play against the Memphis Grizzlies. The Nuggets won 120\u2013107, where they led by as many as 27 points. In the closing minutes of the game, the arena resounded with chants of \"Who needs Melo?\" George Karl said after the game, \"Our guys, when their backs are confronted with a difficult situation, they usually play at a high level. We always react to tough situations in a very positive way.\" However, the trade only seemed to make them better. Post-trade, the Nuggets averaged 24.1 assists, showing their newfound teamwork. The defense of the Nuggets also improved, from allowing 105.2 points per game before the trade to 97.1 points per game for the remainder of the season. [52] Despite the franchise-changing trade which saw eighteen different starting lineups through the whole season, Denver finished with 50 wins (fourth consecutive 50 win seasons for the first time in Nuggets history), clinching the fifth seed of the Western Conference. They met the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the playoffs and lost four games to one.\n\n\n\n![](image)George Karl was named NBA Coach of the Year in 2013, his final season in Denver\nThe first full season of the post-Melo Nuggets saw the steady rise of Danilo Gallinari, who averaged 17 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.6 assists through the first 25 games of the season, which resulted to the Nuggets' best start through the first 20 games. However, Gallinari sustained injuries to his ankle, thumb, and wrist that year. On March 15, 2012, the Nuggets decided to make their team younger by trading Nen\u00ea, who had played the previous nine seasons for Denver, to the Washington Wizards for JaVale McGee.[53] In his first game as a Nugget, McGee made a putback dunk off an Arron Afflalo miss which proved to be the game-winning basket in Denver's 116\u2013115 victory over the Detroit Pistons. In two of the Nuggets' final games of their season, McGee finally earned national attention when he had a 16-point, 15-rebound effort, and a 21-point, 14-rebound effort in Denver's playoff series against the Los Angeles Lakers. These performances helped the Nuggets come back from a 2\u20130 and a 3\u20131 series deficit, but the Nuggets eventually lost in Game 7, 87\u201396.\n\n\n\n#### 2012\u20132013: Team concept[edit]\n\n\nOn August 10, 2012, Denver was involved in a four-team trade where they received All-Star Andre Iguodala and sent Arron Afflalo and Al Harrington to the Orlando Magic. This same trade also sent Dwight Howard to the Los Angeles Lakers. After the trade, Iguodala tweeted \"I'm excited to be joining the Denver Nuggets and I know my best basketball is ahead of me!\"[54] Despite losing their first three games, the 2012\u20132013 Nuggets finished with a franchise-best 57\u201325 record, and a 38\u20133 record in Pepsi Center (the Washington Wizards, Miami Heat, and Minnesota Timberwolves were the only 3 visitors to defeat Denver on their home during the regular season). Denver also clinched the third seed in the Western Conference, with a first-round matchup with the Golden State Warriors. The Nuggets won Game 1 97\u201395 on their home court on a last-second Andre Miller game-winner, but the Warriors won the next three games, putting the Nuggets on the brink of elimination. Denver won Game 5 at home to keep their season alive, but the Warriors eliminated the Nuggets in Game 6, winning 92\u201388 in Oakland. It was Denver's ninth first-round loss in the previous 10 seasons, and the eighth of Karl's tenure. Although Karl won that year's NBA Coach of the Year Award and had led Denver to the playoffs in every year of his nine-year tenure, it was not enough to keep him from being fired after the season.\n\n\n\n### 2013\u20132015: Post\u2013Karl and pre\u2013Joki\u0107 seasons[edit]\n\n\nAlong with Karl being fired, Denver saw a major shake-up in the front office with Executive of the Year Masai Ujiri accepting the general manager position with the Toronto Raptors[55] and vice-president Pete D'Alessandro, who was expected to replace Ujiri, being named general manager of the Sacramento Kings. On June 21, 2013, Tim Connelly was announced as the new general manager.[56] To replace Karl, the Nuggets hired the Indiana Pacers' associate head coach, former NBA player, Brian Shaw. Guard-forward Andre Iguodala was sent to the Golden State Warriors in a sign-and-trade in which they acquired guard Randy Foye from the Utah Jazz. They also signed center-forward JJ Hickson, who was previously with the Portland Trail Blazers and 5' 9\" guard Nate Robinson, who played for the Bulls during the 2012\u20132013 season. They also acquired Darrell Arthur from the Memphis Grizzlies and 55th pick Joffrey Lauvergne in return for Kosta Koufos.[57] In a tough 2013\u201314 season which saw numerous injuries to key players missing a significant amount of the season, the Nuggets finished with 36 wins, their worst in 11 years, and missed the playoffs.\n\n\nDuring the 2014 off-season, the Nuggets brought back Arron Afflalo for whom they traded Evan Fournier. During the 2014 NBA Draft, Denver traded their first lottery pick (11th overall pick) since 2003 to Chicago to acquire two later first-round draft picks, which were used to draft Jusuf Nurki\u0107 and Gary Harris; with the 41st overall pick and their first pick of the second round of the draft, the Nuggets selected 19-year old Nikola Joki\u0107 from Mega Basket in Serbia. On March 3, 2015, general manager Tim Connelly announced the Nuggets fired head coach Brian Shaw and named Melvin Hunt interim head coach.[58]\n\n\n\n### 2015\u2013present: The Nikola Joki\u0107 era and first NBA championship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nikola Joki\u0107 was named NBA Most Valuable Player in 2021 (first player in franchise history) and won the award again in 2022.\nOn June 15, 2015, at the end of the 2014\u201315 season, Michael Malone was named as the new head coach of the Denver Nuggets.[59] Entering the 2015 NBA draft with their lowest draft pick (seventh overall) since 2003, the Nuggets drafted Emmanuel Mudiay who was widely regarded as the top point guard of the draft, leading to speculation that current starting point guard, Ty Lawson, would be traded.[60] On July 14, 2015, Lawson was arrested in Los Angeles on suspicion of driving under the influence, his second in six months.[61] The Nuggets traded Lawson a week later to the Houston Rockets along with a second round draft pick for Joey Dorsey, Nick Johnson, Kostas Papanikolaou, Pablo Prigioni (all of whom were waived), and a first round pick that was used to draft Juan Hernang\u00f3mez.[62]\n\n\nUnder Michael Malone's leadership, the Denver Nuggets slightly started to improve while primarily relying on the youth movement consisting of Emmanuel Mudiay, Nikola Joki\u0107, Gary Harris and later also on the recovered Jusuf Nurki\u0107. On January 27, 2016, it was announced that both Mudiay and Joki\u0107 would participate in BBVA Compass Rising Stars Challenge during NBA All-Star 2016.[63] On February 18, the Denver Nuggets announced that they decided to trade veteran shooting guard Randy Foye to Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for D. J. Augustin, Steve Novak and two second-round draft picks.[64] One day later, JJ Hickson and the newly acquired Novak were waived.[65]\n\n\nOver the course of the 2016 NBA draft, the Denver Nuggets added the Kentucky guard Jamal Murray as well as Juan Hernang\u00f3mez, Malik Beasley, and Petr Cornelie.[66] Meanwhile, their 56th pick was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder. On February 13, 2017, Nurki\u0107 was traded, along with the rights to the Memphis Grizzlies' 2017 first-round draft pick, to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Mason Plumlee, a 2018 second-round pick and cash considerations.[67] Thanks to the continuing improvements of Nikola Joki\u0107, the Nuggets would make significant improvements to their team, although they would be just one game shy from reaching the 2017 NBA playoffs, finishing 9th in the Western Conference.[68]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2017, the Nuggets officially promoted both Art\u016bras Karni\u0161ovas and Tim Connelly to become the team's newest general manager and president of basketball operations respectively.[69][70] In the 2017 NBA draft, the Denver Nuggets selected Tyler Lydon, Vlatko \u010can\u010dar, and Mont\u00e9 Morris, with the 24th, 49th, and 51st picks respectively. On December 2, 2017, the Nuggets would retire Fat Lever's number during their 115\u2013100 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite compiling their first winning season since 2013, they missed the 2018 playoffs, the fifth straight missed playoff run, after losing to the Minnesota Timberwolves in a win-or-go-home situation in the regular season finale, also ending the Timberwolves' 14-year playoff drought.[71] The Nuggets finished 9th, one game behind the eighth seeded Timberwolves.[72]\n\n\nIn the 2018 NBA draft, the Nuggets drafted Michael Porter Jr. and traded with the Magic to get Jarred Vanderbilt. On January 31, 2019, Joki\u0107 received his first All-Star selection as a Western Conference reserve for the 2019 NBA All-Star Game, becoming the Nuggets' first All-Star since Carmelo Anthony in 2011.[73] The Nuggets finished the 2018\u20132019 season with 54 wins, first in their division and second in the Western Conference, and made the playoffs for the first time since 2012\u20132013.[74][75] In the first round, the Nuggets played against the San Antonio Spurs, winning the round in game seven. The Nuggets were eliminated in the second round by the Portland Trail Blazers in 7 games.[74] Game three of the second round had four overtimes, tying a 1953 game for the longest NBA playoff game.[76]\n\n\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Nuggets were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season.[77] Led by Joki\u0107 and Murray, the team is the first in NBA playoff history to consecutively come from 3\u20131 deficits. In the first round, they defeated Utah in 7 games in a record-breaking scoring duel between Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell.[78] The Nuggets repeated the same feat against Paul George and Kawhi Leonard of the Los Angeles Clippers in the second round, becoming the only team in NBA history to overcome multiple 3\u20131 deficits in a single playoff run. In the Western Conference Finals, the Nuggets' title race came to an end, after the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers trounced them in five games.[79]\n\n\nIn the 2020\u201321 NBA season, Joki\u0107 was named the NBA Most Valuable Player, becoming the first center since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000 and the first player in Nuggets franchise history to win the award. He also became the first Serbian player, third European player overall (along with Dirk Nowitzki of Germany and Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece), and sixth international player to ever win the award (along with Hakeem Olajuwon of Nigeria, Tim Duncan of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Steve Nash of Canada, Nowitzki of Germany, and Antetokounmpo of Greece). Joki\u0107 also became the lowest ever drafted player at #41, and the first player in NBA history to be selected in the second round of the common era draft, to win the MVP award.[80][81] Although the Nuggets finished the season with the third seed in the Western Conference and beat their first round opponents, the Portland Trail Blazers, in six games, the loss of starting guard Jamal Murray to an ACL tear contributed to the team's sweep by the eventual Western Conference champions, the second-seeded Phoenix Suns.[82]\n\n\nThe following season saw more poor injury luck for the Denver Nuggets. Nine games into the season, starting forward Michael Porter Jr. joined Murray on the sidelines with season-ending back surgery.[83] In spite of the injuries, Joki\u0107 and starting power forward Aaron Gordon carried the Nuggets to the sixth seed, the former becoming the first-ever player in NBA history to accumulate 2,000 points, 1,000 rebounds, and 500 assists in a single season.[84] Joki\u0107 went on to receive the Kia MVP Award for the second year in a row \u2013 joining 12 other players in NBA history to achieve the award in back to back years, and the first center to do so since Moses Malone in 1982 and 1983.[84] In the first round of the playoffs, Joki\u0107's Nuggets fell five games to the Golden State Warriors, who went on to win the championship.\n\n\n\n#### 2023: First title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nuggets owner Stan Kroenke (centre), star players Nikola Joki\u0107 (right), Jamal Murray (left) parading the teams' first NBA championship\nIn the 2022\u201323 season, the Nuggets secured the top seed in the Western Conference with 53 wins and 29 losses, two games ahead of the Memphis Grizzlies. The Nuggets defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 4\u20131 in the first round of the 2023 playoffs, before defeating the Phoenix Suns 4\u20132 in the Conference Semifinals. The Nuggets' playoff dominance continued in the Conference Finals; spearheaded by outstanding play from Joki\u0107, who was named the Western Conference Finals Most Valuable Player, the team swept the Los Angeles Lakers in four games to advance to their first ever NBA Finals.[85] This also marked the first time that the Nuggets had beaten the Lakers in a playoff series (having previously been 0\u20137 against them), as well as the first playoff series sweep in franchise history.[86] In the NBA Finals, on June 12, 2023, the Nuggets would beat the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat 4\u20131 to win their first NBA championship, with Joki\u0107 receiving the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.[87][88]\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the Nuggets.

From 1971\u201372 through 1973\u201374, the Rockets wore gold and purple (Columbine blue) uniforms, and their logo featured a cartoonish rocket bouncing a gold and purple basketball, with a purple and white snow-capped mountain in the background.[90]\n\n\n\n### 1974\u20131981: Maxie The Miner[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Nuggets' final two seasons in the ABA, the team's logo featured a cartoonish miner known as \"Maxie The Miner,\" with a large red beard, a pick-axe in one hand and a red and blue basketball in the other hand. When the Nuggets joined the NBA in the 1976\u201377 season, they retained the pick-axe logo on their jerseys from the ABA days. The home uniforms feature \"Nuggets\" in red, with a red pick-axe inside a blue oval, and gold numbers with blue trim in front, blue numbers and letters at the back. The road uniforms were blue, with \"Denver\" in blue with a blue pick-axe in a red oval, and gold numbers in front, white numbers and letters at the back. The Nuggets simplified their uniforms following their inaugural season in the NBA. From 1977 to 1982, their home uniforms were white, with a \"Nuggets\" script written across the chest in a darker royal blue, with gold trim around the script and jersey numbers. The royal blue away jersey had \"Denver\" written across the chest in white, with gold trim.\n\n\n\n### 1981\u20131993: Rainbow City Skyline[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1981\u201382 through 1992\u201393, the Nuggets wore the Denver \"rainbow city\" skyline across the chest and back on both the home and away uniforms. Some fans also call the iconic 1980s logo the \"Tetris\" logo, due to the buildings that shadow the mountains on the logo which are in the shape of squares. The initial home uniforms were white with navy and green trim, with \"Nuggets\" and the uniform number in gold with blue trim. The player names were written in block lettering and in a straight position. In 1985, they changed the shade of blue to royal and eliminated green, and in 1986, changed the back numbers to royal blue. In 1991, coinciding with the debut of Dikembe Mutombo, the word \"Nuggets\" became white with royal blue and gold trim. The road uniforms were initially navy blue with green trim, with \"Denver\" and the uniform number in white with gold trim, before likewise changing it to royal blue, with gold serifed block letters for player names in an arch (royal blue in home uniforms). The font and \"skyline\" logo were later reintroduced on alternate jerseys beginning with the 2012\u201313 season.\n\n\n\n### 1993\u20132003: Navy blue, metallic gold and maroon[edit]\n\n\nFor the 1993\u201394 season, the Nuggets drastically changed their look, with a navy blue, metallic gold and maroon color scheme on their uniforms. The \"rainbow city skyline,\" which had been synonymous with the team since 1981, was replaced with a logo that featured a navy blue snow-capped mountain above an enlarged western-style \"Nuggets\" wordmark in metallic gold, and a curved maroon ribbon with a \"Denver\" wordmark positioned in between the mountain and the \"Nuggets\" wordmark. The home jerseys had a \"Nuggets\" script in a modified version of the typeface Aachen across the chest in navy blue, with maroon and metallic gold trim around the script and numbers, while the navy blue away jerseys had the same script in metallic gold, with maroon and white trim. The Nuggets wore these uniforms for a decade, until the end of the 2002\u201303 season.\n\n\n\n### 2003\u20132018: Powder blue, navy blue and gold[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2003\u201304 season, the Nuggets made another uniform change, coinciding with Carmelo Anthony's debut, with a color scheme of powder blue, gold (yellow) and royal blue. The primary logo, featuring a snow-capped mountain, curved ribbon with a \"Denver\" wordmark and an enlarged western-style \"Nuggets\" workmark *(see previous section)*, was modified, with the mountain royal blue, the ribbon powder blue and the \"Nuggets\" wordmark a golden yellow. Like the 1990s uniforms, the Nuggets' revised jerseys also had the \"Aachen\" typeface across the chest\u2014it was \"Nuggets\" in powder blue, with royal blue and gold trim on the home white jersey, while the powder blue road jerseys had \"Denver\" in white, with gold and royal blue trim. These jerseys, along with the team logo, were tweaked prior to the 2008\u201309 season, with the royal blue replaced by the shade of navy blue that was part of the team's color scheme from 1993 to 2003. These jerseys were used until the 2014\u201315 season, while the snow-capped mountain logo would serve as the team's primary logo until the 2017\u201318 season.\n\n\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, the Nuggets also introduced an alternate logo, as well as an alternate navy blue uniform. The alternate logo featured twin intersecting gold pick-axes in a powder blue circle, with a half-white/half-yellow \"mountain peaks\" at the top of the circle and a basketball with gold outlining and navy blue accents at the bottom of the circle. The navy blue jersey featured an alternate \"Nuggets\" script in gold, with navy blue interior trim and powder blue outlining. This uniform was used until the end of the 2011\u201312 season, while the circular \"pick axe\" logo would become the team's new primary logo for the 2018\u201319 season.\n\n\nWhile the \"pick axe\" logo was officially introduced in 2005, former NBA director of creative services Tom O'Grady had planned on introducing the logo as early as 1998, but then-NBA commissioner David Stern was not informed of the possible logo change. As a result, the logo was shelved until was brought in as an alternate seven years later.[91]\n\n\nFor the 2012\u201313 season, the Nuggets unveiled a gold alternate jersey, replacing the aforementioned navy blue jerseys that had been used during the previous seven seasons. This jersey featured a return to the Denver \"rainbow skyline\" logo, but used the team's \"Aachen\" typeface and color scheme of powder blue, navy and gold.[92]\n\n\nFor the 2015\u201316 season, the Nuggets modified the script and numbering fonts on their home and away jerseys, with a gold \"Nuggets\" script on the home white jersey and a gold \"Denver\" script on the powder blue away jersey\u2014both with the \"Coliseum\" typeface. Navy blue numerals trimmed in gold, as well as navy blue nameplates, were featured on both the home and away jerseys. The alternate gold \"skyline\" jerseys were also tweaked, with a retro \"Nuggets\" wordmark (that was used on the 1980s rainbow skyline jerseys) in navy blue trimmed in white. The numerals were also modified with the Coliseum typeface, but remained white, with powder blue interior trim and navy blue exterior outlining.[93]\n\n\nThe Nuggets updated their uniforms for the 2017\u201318 season. The light uniform (dubbed by Nike as the \"Association\" jersey), the dark uniform (dubbed by Nike as the \"Icon\" jersey) and the alternate uniform (dubbed by Nike as the \"Statement\" jersey) saw the return of navy blue as a primary color for the first time since the 2002\u201303 season, while powder blue was drastically diminished and relegated to trim color status. Slight tweaks were made to the striping and lettering.[94][95] The Nuggets' gold \"Statement\" jersey made some noticeable alterations as well, relegating the navy, powder blue and white rainbow to the sides and relocating the number to the bottom. Western Union became the team's jersey sponsor.\n\n\n\n### 2018\u2013present: Evolved new identity[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2018\u201319 season, the Nuggets modified their logos and uniforms, featuring various color schemes that the team has worn in their history. The current color scheme consists of midnight blue (navy), sunshine yellow, flatirons red (maroon) and skyline blue (royal)\u2014the latter color is only featured on the \"Statement\" jersey and two of the team's new alternate logos. Powder blue, which had been part of the team's color scheme since 2003, was eliminated from all logos and uniforms. The white \"Association\" jersey features \"Nuggets\" in flatirons red, with sunshine yellow trim and midnight blue numbers with sunshine yellow trim, while the midnight blue \"Icon\" jersey features \"Denver\" in sunshine yellow, with flatirons red trim and white numbers with flatirons red trim. Both sets also include mountain peak striping on the shorts and the pick axe logo on the waistline. The skyline blue \"Statement\" jersey features \"Mile High City\" in white surrounding sunshine yellow numbers, plus a midnight blue mountain peak silhouette and a sunshine yellow pick axe logo on the sides of the shorts. A modernized version of the skyline logo adorns the waistline. The circular \"pick axe logo,\" which had served as the Nuggets' alternate logo since 2005, became the team's new primary logo, replacing the snow-capped mountain/enlarged western-style wordmark logo that had served as the team's primary logo (in three different versions) since 1993. The colors on the circular pick axe logo were also modified with the team's new color scheme.[96][97]\n\n\nPrior to the 2022\u201323 season, the \"Statement\" uniform was slightly tweaked with greater usage of gold on the letters, and red on the trim and mountain silhouette. Two \"gold strikes\" were also added between the words \"Mile High City\".[98]\n\n\n\n### City Edition uniforms[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2017\u201318 season, Nike released a fourth uniform option known as the \"City\" series, which is updated annually. The Nuggets' first \"City\" uniform had a navy base, highlighting the pick-axe and mountain logo in front and incorporating sublimated mountain peak patterns on the shorts.[99]\n\n\nThe Nuggets' 2018\u201319 \"City\" uniform was a callback to the team's 1982\u201393 rainbow uniforms, featuring a sublimated pattern of the rainbow logo and navy lettering.[100] The same design was used for the 2019\u201320 \"City\" uniform, albeit with a black base and white letters.[101]\n\n\nFor 2020\u201321, the Nuggets kept the same \"City\" uniform design but eliminated the rainbow pattern and went with a red/yellow/orange gradient within the mountains and a flatirons red base.[102]\n\n\nThe Nuggets were one of 27 teams to receive mashup \"City\" uniforms as part of the NBA's 75th anniversary during the 2021\u201322 season. Denver's uniform featured various design takes from past uniforms, including the throwback \"Nuggets\" wordmark and rainbow pattern from the 1980s uniforms, navy blue and stylized numbers from the 1993\u20132003 uniforms, Maxie the Miner and striping based on the ABA Nuggets uniforms, and the powder blue and \"DN\" alternate logo from the 2000s uniforms.[103]\n\n\nFor the 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform, the Nuggets wore white uniforms with navy letters, gold and red trim, and royal blue/white gradient stripes. The uniform was inspired by Denver's iconic architecture and its civic organizations.[104]\n\n\nFor their 2023\u201324 \"City\" uniform, the Nuggets revisited the mountain-themed motif from their 1980s \"Rainbow\" uniforms. The black-based design featured sublimated blue lines representing the Rocky Mountains, and \"5280\" below in gold to symbolize Denver's high elevation. Other elements include a secondary team logo on the shorts, \"Denver\" wordmark on the waistband, white numbers above the left chest, and burgundy stripes.[105] The uniform would be worn for select games, and in home games during the 2023 NBA in-season tournament, it would be paired with a specially-painted alternate blue court with a gold middle strip and the silhouette of the NBA Cup.[106]\n\n\n\n### Earned Edition uniforms[edit]\n\n\nAs a reward for making the NBA playoffs the previous season, 16 teams were given an exclusive fifth or sixth uniform option: the \"Earned\" uniform. The Nuggets, having qualified for the 2020 NBA playoffs, were given this option in the 2020\u201321 season. The white-based design featured a modified pickaxe logo, with the top half in skyline blue and the bottom half in flatirons red. Names are written in blue and numbers are written in red with gold trim.[107]\n\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Denver Nuggets all-time roster\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Denver Nuggets roster*** v\n* t\n* e\n\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| G | 0 | Braun, Christian | 6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (1.98\u00a0m)\n | 220\u00a0lb (100\u00a0kg)\n | 2001-04-17\n | Kansas |\n| G | 5 | Caldwell-Pope, Kentavious | 6\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in (1.96\u00a0m)\n | 204\u00a0lb (93\u00a0kg)\n | 1993-02-18\n | Georgia |\n| F | 31 | \u010can\u010dar, Vlatko\u00a0![Injured](image) | 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m)\n | 236\u00a0lb (107\u00a0kg)\n | 1997-04-10\n | Slovenia |\n| G | 21 | Gillespie, Collin\u00a0![Injured](image)\u00a0(TW)\n | 6\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in (1.85\u00a0m)\n | 195\u00a0lb (88\u00a0kg)\n | 1999-06-25\n | Villanova |\n| F | 50 | Gordon, Aaron | 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m)\n | 235\u00a0lb (107\u00a0kg)\n | 1995-09-16\n | Arizona |\n| G/F | 9 | Holiday, Justin | 6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (1.98\u00a0m)\n | 180\u00a0lb (82\u00a0kg)\n | 1989-04-05\n | Washington |\n| C | 30 | Huff, Jay\u00a0(TW)\n | 7\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in (2.16\u00a0m)\n | 240\u00a0lb (109\u00a0kg)\n | 1997-08-25\n | Virginia |\n| G | 7 | Jackson, Reggie | 6\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in (1.88\u00a0m)\n | 208\u00a0lb (94\u00a0kg)\n | 1990-04-16\n | Boston College |\n| C | 15 | Joki\u0107, Nikola | 6\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in (2.11\u00a0m)\n | 284\u00a0lb (129\u00a0kg)\n | 1995-02-19\n | Serbia |\n| C | 6 | Jordan, DeAndre | 6\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in (2.11\u00a0m)\n | 265\u00a0lb (120\u00a0kg)\n | 1988-07-21\n | Texas A&M |\n| F | 11 | Key, Braxton\u00a0(TW)\n | 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m)\n | 225\u00a0lb (102\u00a0kg)\n | 1997-02-14\n | Virginia |\n| G | 27 | Murray, Jamal | 6\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (1.93\u00a0m)\n | 215\u00a0lb (98\u00a0kg)\n | 1997-02-23\n | Kentucky |\n| F/C | 22 | Nnaji, Zeke | 6\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in (2.06\u00a0m)\n | 240\u00a0lb (109\u00a0kg)\n | 2001-01-09\n | Arizona |\n| G | 24 | Pickett, Jalen | 6\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in (1.88\u00a0m)\n | 202\u00a0lb (92\u00a0kg)\n | 1999-10-22\n | Penn State |\n| F | 1 | Porter, Michael Jr. | 6\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (2.08\u00a0m)\n | 218\u00a0lb (99\u00a0kg)\n | 1998-06-29\n | Missouri |\n| G/F | 3 | Strawther, Julian | 6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (1.98\u00a0m)\n | 205\u00a0lb (93\u00a0kg)\n | 2002-04-18\n | Gonzaga |\n| F | 4 | Tyson, Hunter | 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m)\n | 215\u00a0lb (98\u00a0kg)\n | 2000-06-13\n | Clemson |\n| G/F | 8 | Watson, Peyton | 6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in (2.01\u00a0m)\n | 200\u00a0lb (91\u00a0kg)\n | 2002-09-11\n | UCLA |\n\n | Head coach* Michael Malone\n\nAssistant coach(es)* David Adelman\n* John Beckett\n* Ryan Bowen\n* Popeye Jones\n* Charles Klask\n* Ryan Saunders\n* Ognjen Stojakovi\u0107\n* Elvis Valcarcel\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nLegend\n* **(DP)** Unsigned draft pick\n* **(FA)** Free agent\n* **(S)** Suspended\n* **(GL)** On assignment to G League\n* **(TW)** Two-way affiliate player\n* ![Injured](image) Injured\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nRoster  Last transaction: March 17, 2024\n |\n\n\n### Retained draft rights[edit]\n\n\nThe Nuggets hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA.

The Timberwolves compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Northwest Division of the Western Conference.[8] Founded in 1989, the team is owned by Glen Taylor who also owns the WNBA's Minnesota Lynx.[9] The Timberwolves play their home games at Target Center, their home since 1990.[10]\n\n\nLike most expansion teams, the Timberwolves struggled in their early years, but after the acquisition of Kevin Garnett in the 1995 NBA draft, the team qualified for the playoffs in eight consecutive seasons from 1997 to 2004. Despite losing in the first round in their first seven attempts, the Timberwolves won their first division championship in 2004 and advanced to the Western Conference Finals that same season. Garnett was also named the NBA Most Valuable Player for that season.[11] The team then went into rebuilding mode for more than a decade after missing the postseason in 2005, and trading Garnett to the Boston Celtics in 2007.[12] Garnett returned to the Timberwolves in a February 2015 trade and finished his career there, retiring in the 2016 offseason. The Timberwolves ended a 14-year playoff drought when they returned to the postseason in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\n### 1989\u20131995: Team creation and early years[edit]\n\n\nNBA basketball returned to the Twin Cities in 1989 for the first time since the Minneapolis Lakers (1947\u20131960) departed to Los Angeles in 1960. The NBA had granted one of its four new expansion teams on April 22, 1987 (the others being the Orlando Magic, Charlotte Hornets, and the Miami Heat) to original owners Harvey Ratner and Marv Wolfenson to begin play beginning in the 1989\u201390 season. There were two previous American Basketball Association (ABA) franchises that played in between the Lakers' departure and the Timberwolves arrival: the Minnesota Muskies (1967\u201368), and the Minnesota Pipers (1968\u201369). The Timberwolves have worn throwback uniforms for each of the previous franchises.[13][14]\n\n\nThe franchise conducted a \"name the team\" contest[15] and eventually selected two finalists, \"Timberwolves\" and \"Polars\", in December 1986. The team then asked the 842 city councils in Minnesota to select the winner and \"Timberwolves\" prevailed by nearly 2\u20131.[16][17] The team was officially named the \"Minnesota Timberwolves\" on January 23, 1987. Minnesota is home to the largest population of timberwolves in the contiguous 48 states.[18]\n\n\nThe Timberwolves debuted on November 3, 1989, losing to the Seattle SuperSonics on the road 106\u201394. Five days later, they made their home debut at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, losing to the Chicago Bulls 96\u201384. Two nights later on November 10, the Wolves got their first win, beating the Philadelphia 76ers at home 125\u2013118. The Timberwolves, led by Tony Campbell with 23.2\u00a0ppg, went on to a 22\u201360 record, finishing in sixth place in the Midwest Division. Playing in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, the expansion Timberwolves set an NBA record by drawing over 1\u00a0million fans to their home games.[19] This included a crowd of 49,551 on April 17, 1990, which saw the Timberwolves lose to the Denver Nuggets 99\u201388 in the final home game of the season.[20]\n\n\nThe next season, the team moved into their permanent home, the Target Center, and improved somewhat, finishing 29\u201353. However, they fired their head coach, Bill Musselman. They fared far worse in the 1991\u201392 NBA season under Musselman's successor, ex-Celtics coach Jimmy Rodgers, finishing with an NBA-worst 15\u201367 record. Looking to turn the corner, the Wolves hired former Detroit Pistons general manager Jack McCloskey to the same position, but even with notable first-round selections such as Christian Laettner and Isaiah Rider, the Timberwolves were unable to duplicate McCloskey's \"Detroit Bad Boys\" success in the Twin Cities, finishing 19\u201363 and 20\u201362 the next two seasons. One of the few highlights from that era was when the Target Center served as host of the 1994 All-Star Game where Rider won the Slam Dunk Contest with his between-the-leg \"East Bay Funk Dunk\".[21]\n\n\nAs winning basketball continued to elude the Wolves, Ratner and Wolfenson nearly sold the team to New Orleans interests in 1994 before NBA owners rejected the proposed move. Eventually, Glen Taylor bought the team and named Kevin McHale general manager. The Wolves finished 21\u201361 in 1994\u201395, and the future looked bleak.[22]\n\n\n\n### 1995\u20132007: The Kevin Garnett era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kevin Garnett played for the Timberwolves from 1995 to 2007 before returning in 2015.\nIn the 1995 NBA draft, the Timberwolves selected high school standout Kevin Garnett in the first round (5th overall),[23] and Flip Saunders was named head coach. Christian Laettner was traded along with Sean Rooks to the Atlanta Hawks for Andrew Lang and Spud Webb. Also, first-round pick Donyell Marshall was traded the previous season for Golden State Warriors' forward Tom Gugliotta. These trades paved the way for rookie Kevin Garnett to become the go-to player inside. Garnett went on to average 10.4 ppg in his rookie season as the Wolves finished in 5th place in the Midwest Division, with a 26\u201356 record.[22]\n\n\nIn 1996, the Wolves added another star player in the draft, trading Ray Allen to the Milwaukee Bucks for the rights to Stephon Marbury, the 4th overall pick. The addition of Marbury had a positive effect on the entire team, as Garnett and Gugliotta became the first Wolves to be selected to the All-Star team. Gugliotta and Garnett led the Timberwolves in scoring as the team made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history with a record of 40\u201342. However, in the playoffs the Timberwolves made a quick exit as they were swept by the Houston Rockets in three straight games.[24] The T-Wolves also decided to change their image by changing their team logo and color scheme, adding black to the team colors and replacing the original logo with one featuring a snarling wolf looming over a field of trees. It was also during this season that Minnesota began to play on a parquet floor.\n\n\nIn 1997, Garnett and Marbury established themselves as two of the brightest rising stars in the NBA. Garnett averaged 18.5 ppg and 9.6 rebounds per game, while Marbury averaged 17.7 ppg and dished out 8.6 assists per game. Despite losing leading scorer Tom Gugliotta for half the season, the Timberwolves went on to post their first winning season at 45\u201337, making the playoffs for the second straight season. After dropping Game 1 of the playoffs on the road to the Seattle SuperSonics, the Timberwolves won their first postseason game in Game 2, winning in Seattle 98\u201393. As the series shifted to Minnesota, the Timberwolves had an opportunity to pull off the upset as they won Game 3 by a score of 98\u201390. However, the Wolves dropped Game 4 at home as the Sonics went on to win the series in five games.[25]\n\n\nIn 1998, a year after signing Kevin Garnett to a six-year, $126 million contract, the Timberwolves were then used as the poster child of irresponsible spending as the NBA endured a four-month lockout that wiped out much of the season. With an already cap-heavy payroll, the Wolves let Tom Gugliotta walk, partially because the team wanted to save money in order to sign Stephon Marbury to a long-term contract, and in part because Gugliotta did not want to play with the young player. This move proved unsuccessful, however, as Stephon Marbury wanted to be the biggest star on a team and subsequently forced an in-season trade by refusing a contract extension. In the three-team mid-season deal that sent Marbury to the New Jersey Nets, the Wolves got Terrell Brandon in return and a first-round draft pick in the 1999 draft (which turned out to be the sixth pick). The Wolves made the playoffs for the third straight season by finishing in fourth place with a 25\u201325 record. In the playoffs, the Timberwolves were beaten by the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in four games.[26]\n\n\nIn 1999, the Timberwolves drafted Wally Szczerbiak with the sixth pick in the draft.[27] He had a solid season, finishing third on the team in scoring with 11.6 points per game. Led by Kevin Garnett, who averaged 22.9 points per game and 11.8 rebounds per game, the Timberwolves had their first 50-win season and finished in 3rd place with a record of 50\u201332. However, in the playoffs the Wolves again fell in the first round, losing to the Portland Trail Blazers in four games.[28] The Wolves opened the 1999\u20132000 regular season with two home games against the Sacramento Kings at the Tokyo Dome on November 6 and 7.\n\n\nIn the summer of 2000, guard Malik Sealy was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver. Sealy's number has since been retired: the number 2 jersey memorialized with Sealy's name on a banner hanging from the rafters of Target Center. It remains the only number retired by the team.[29]\n\n\nAlso in that season, a free agent deal signed by Joe Smith was voided by the NBA, who ruled that the Timberwolves violated proper procedure in signing the contract. The league stripped the Timberwolves of five draft picks (first round 2001\u201305), but it was eventually reduced to three first-round picks (2001, 2002, and 2004). The league also fined the Timberwolves $3.5 million and suspended general manager Kevin McHale for one year. Smith eventually signed with the Detroit Pistons before re-signing with the Timberwolves in 2001. Despite those setbacks, the Timberwolves made the playoffs for the fifth straight season with a 47\u201335 record.[30] In the playoffs, the Timberwolves were eliminated in the first round again by the San Antonio Spurs in four games in the spring of 2001.[31]\n\n\nA number of newcomers arrived prior to the start of the next season, including Gary Trent, Loren Woods and Maurice Evans and the return of Joe Smith. The Timberwolves started the season by winning their first six games and went on to achieve a franchise-best start of 30\u201310. The Timberwolves had a franchise-record 53-point win over Chicago in November. They finished with a 50\u201332 record: their second-ever 50-win season that was highlighted by another All-Star appearance by Garnett and a breakout season by Wally Szczerbiak, who earned his first All-Star appearance. Once again, Minnesota lost in the first round of the playoffs, where they were swept by the Dallas Mavericks in three straight games.[32]\n\n\nThe 2002\u201303 season seemed to look up for the Timberwolves. Garnett had a great season where he finished second in MVP voting with 23.0 points per game and 13.4 rebounds per game and the Timberwolves finished in third place with a 51\u201331 record. As a result, they were awarded home-court advantage for the first time when facing the three-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers. After being blown out at home in Game 1, the Timberwolves had a chance to take a 3\u20131 series lead heading into the 4th quarter of Game 4 in Los Angeles, but the Lakers came back to win the game and eventually won the series in six games. In the end, the Timberwolves were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the seventh straight year.[33]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n#### 2003\u201304 season: Western Conference Finals appearance[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Rob Babcock was promoted to vice-president of player personnel. He and general manager Kevin McHale made a series of strong off-season moves in an attempt to get the team over the hump and beyond the first round of the playoffs. They made two important trades, sending away forward Joe Smith and guard Terrell Brandon in a multi-player deal for Ervin Johnson, Sam Cassell and embattled guard Latrell Sprewell. They also signed sharp-shooter Fred Hoiberg, and former #1 pick Michael Olowokandi as free agents, with both becoming key contributors during the season. The Timberwolves rounded out their bench by signing veteran role players Trenton Hassell, Troy Hudson, and Mark Madsen.\n\n\nDespite injuries to a revitalized Olowokandi (who missed half the season) and 6th man Wally Szczerbiak (who only played in 28 games), the revamped Timberwolves became the team to beat during the 2003\u201304 NBA season, finishing the season as the top seed in the Western Conference with a record of 58\u201324. Garnett had his best season to date, and both Sprewell and Cassell had career years as well. Garnett and Cassell both made the all-star team, and after the season, Garnett was named 1st Team All NBA, and earned his first MVP award averaging 24.2 points, 13.9 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game.[34]\n\n\nDuring the 2004 NBA playoffs, the Wolves won their first-ever playoff series against the Denver Nuggets, before beating the Sacramento Kings in a hard-fought seven-game series to advance to the franchise's first Western Conference Finals. Kevin Garnett leapt upon the scorer's table upon the winning Game 7 in the Sacramento series, which became one of the more iconic moments in Minnesota sports history. The Timberwolves' run ended in the Western Conference finals as the team lost to the Los Angeles Lakers. Sam Cassell injured his groin during Game 7 against the Kings, doing his infamous *big balls* dance after knocking down the series-clinching bucket, and as a result, played only sparingly during the Lakers series. Many around the NBA, including both Flip Saunders and Phil Jackson believe that had he been healthy, the Wolves would have advanced to the finals.[35][36]\n\n\n\n#### Departure of Flip Saunders[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Timberwolves conduct pre-game warm-ups at their home Arena, the Target Center\nGoing into the 2004\u201305 season, the Wolves roster remained virtually the same from the previous season; however, Babcock left to become the general manager of the Toronto Raptors, and the team was also plagued with contract disputes and the complaining of key players Latrell Sprewell, Sam Cassell, and Troy Hudson during the off-season. After a disappointing start to the season, Head Coach Flip Saunders was replaced by general manager and long-time friend Kevin McHale, who took over as coach for the rest of the season. Despite a strong finish, the Timberwolves missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years, by one game, to the Memphis Grizzlies, ending the season with a record of 44\u201338.\n\n\nDuring the 2005 offseason, McHale and the Wolves started their search for a head coach. McHale interviewed Seattle SuperSonics assistant coach Dwane Casey, San Antonio Spurs assistant P. J. Carlesimo, former coach John Lucas and Wolves assistants Randy Wittman, Sidney Lowe and Jerry Sichting, among others.\n\n\nOn June 17, 2005, the Timberwolves hired Casey as the new head coach. It was Casey's first head coaching job, making him the Wolves' seventh head coach in their 16-year history.[37]\n\n\nIn the 2005 draft, the Timberwolves selected Rashad McCants, a shooting guard from North Carolina with the 14th overall pick of the first round.[38] The Timberwolves also selected Bracey Wright, a guard from Indiana, with the 17th pick of the second round (47th overall).[39]\n\n\nDuring the offseason, they traded All-Star Sam Cassell and a protected future first-round draft pick to the Los Angeles Clippers for Marko Jari\u0107 and Lionel Chalmers. They also signed free agent Nikoloz Tskitishvili.[40]\n\n\nOn January 26, 2006, the Wolves traded forward Wally Szczerbiak, centers Dwayne Jones and Michael Olowokandi, and a future first-round draft pick to the Boston Celtics. In return, they received forward-guard Ricky Davis, center Mark Blount, forward Justin Reed, guard Marcus Banks, and two second-round draft picks. In a separate trade on the same day, the Timberwolves traded Tskitishvili to the Phoenix Suns for a 2006 second-round draft pick. The Timberwolves finished 33\u201349, missing the playoffs for the second consecutive year.[41]\n\n\nIn the 2006 NBA draft, the Timberwolves selected future NBA Rookie of the Year Brandon Roy with the 6th overall pick, Craig Smith with the 36th pick, forward Bobby Jones with the 37th pick and center Loukas Mavrokefalidis with the 57th pick. The Timberwolves traded Roy to the Portland Trail Blazers for Randy Foye and cash considerations. The Timberwolves then traded Bobby Jones to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2007 second-round pick and cash.\n\n\nOn January 23, McHale fired head coach Casey and replaced him with Randy Wittman. McHale explained in a news conference that it was inconsistency by Casey that led to the firing. Casey had compiled an overall record of 53\u201369. They finished the 2006\u201307 season with a record of 32\u201350, allowing them to keep their 2007 first-round pick.[42]\n\n\n\n### 2007\u20132010: Post-Kevin Garnett era[edit]\n\n\nOn July 31, 2007, the Minnesota Timberwolves reached a deal to trade All-Star Kevin Garnett to the Boston Celtics for Al Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Gerald Green, Sebastian Telfair, Ryan Gomes, two first-round draft picks, and cash considerations. This is the largest combination of players and picks ever traded for a single player in NBA history.[43][44] Garnett and the Celtics went on to win the 2008 NBA Finals in six games over the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\nThat summer, the Timberwolves traded Mike James and Justin Reed to the Houston Rockets for Juwan Howard.[45] In October of the same year, the Timberwolves waived Howard after reaching a contractual buyout agreement, worth $10 million of roughly $14.25 million which Minnesota would have owed him. The team also traded Ricky Davis and Mark Blount to the Miami Heat in exchange for the Heat's Antoine Walker, Michael Doleac, Wayne Simien, and a 2008 protected first-round draft pick.\n\n\nIn the 2007 NBA draft the Timberwolves selected Corey Brewer, with the 7th pick, and Chris Richard with the 41st overall pick, both being from the two-time NCAA national champion Florida Gators.[46]\n\n\nMinnesota began the NBA preseason with two games in London and Istanbul, as part of NBA Europe Live 2007. On October 10, The Wolves lost to Garnett and the revamped Celtics, 92\u201381. To start the season, the Wolves began 0\u20135 before ending the drought with a home win over the Sacramento Kings. That drought also brought about speculation of the possible dismissal of coach Wittman. The youngest team in the NBA began adjusting to life after trading franchise star Garnett to Boston, meanwhile playing without budding talent Randy Foye for the first half of the season. Guards Sebastian Telfair and Marko Jari\u0107 were deputized as starting point guards during Foye's injury absence. The Timberwolves finished the season 22\u201360.[47] On a handful of occasions during the season, the team showed flashes of its potential in wins or very close contests with top-tier teams.\n\n\nIn the 2008 NBA draft, the Timberwolves selected O. J. Mayo of USC with the third overall pick. When the draft concluded, the Timberwolves traded Mayo, Antoine Walker, Greg Buckner, and Marko Jari\u0107 to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for fifth overall pick Kevin Love, Mike Miller, Jason Collins, and Brian Cardinal in a move that Jim Stack called, \"a deal we couldn't pass up.\"[48]\n\n\nIn 2008, in celebration of the franchise's 20th anniversary, the team unveiled an updated version of its logo and uniforms.[49] The new designs first appeared in the first preseason game against the Chicago Bulls at United Center on October 14, 2008. They also refurbished the floor at Target Center, returning to the traditional floor pattern and added touches of varnish while exposing most of the hardwood.\n\n\nOn December 8, 2008, after a 23-point loss to the Los Angeles Clippers that dropped the team to 4\u201315, the Timberwolves fired head coach Wittman and McHale took over. McHale also relinquished his vice president of basketball operations duties. It was unclear whether McHale's future with the team was dependent on the success or progress of the team which he had put together over the previous four years.\n\n\nThose questions seemed to be answered when the Timberwolves went 10\u20134 for the month of January, giving McHale the coach of the month honors. But on February 8, 2009, the team's main star Al Jefferson tore his ACL in his right knee in a game at New Orleans, sidelining him for the rest of the season. At the time of the injury, Jefferson was having his best season to date, averaging 23 points, 11 rebounds and 2 blocks.[50] Without Jefferson and Corey Brewer (who also suffered a season-ending injury), the Wolves sputtered, to finish with a 24\u201358 record.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kevin Love became the fifth Timberwolves player to be named NBA All-Star.\nOn June 17, 2009, new president of basketball operations David Kahn announced that McHale would not be returning to the team as head coach. Kahn did not give a specific reason for McHale's dismissal, only saying \"this is going to be a transition period.\" For his part, McHale said he wanted to come back but was not offered a contract. Later, in August, the Timberwolves announced the signing of Kurt Rambis, then an assistant for the Los Angeles Lakers, to a four-year, $8 million contract to be their new head coach. In Rambis's first season, the team stumbled to the second-worst record in the league, as their 15\u201367 record was only surpassed by that of the New Jersey Nets, who finished at 12\u201370.[52]\n\n\n\n### 2010\u20132014: The Kevin Love era[edit]\n\n\nOn July 12, 2010, Minnesota traded for Miami Heat forward Michael Beasley, the second pick from the 2008 NBA draft.[53]\nIn a locally untelevised game on November 12, 2010, Kevin Love grabbed a franchise-record 31 rebounds and scored 31 points in a win over the New York Knicks, the NBA's first 30\u201330 game in 28 years.[54]\nLove was later named an All Star for the 2010\u201311 NBA season, the franchise's first All Star selection since Kevin Garnett in 2007. Love would later break Garnett's team record of 37 straight double-doubles on February 8, 2011, in a win over the Houston Rockets. On March 8, 2011, Love acquired his 52nd straight double-double, surpassing the mark of Moses Malone for the most consecutive double-doubles since the NBA-ABA merger in a win over the Indiana Pacers. The streak eventually reached 53 games and came to an end with a six-point, 12-rebound performance in a 100\u201377 loss to the Golden State Warriors on March 13. In October 2011, Love was ranked 16th among active players by ESPN.[55]\n\n\nOn February 21, 2011, Corey Brewer and Kosta Koufos were traded to the New York Knicks and Denver Nuggets respectively for Knicks Anthony Randolph and Eddy Curry (plus $3 million in cash from New York and a 2015 second-round draft pick from Denver) as part of a larger trade that sent all-star Carmelo Anthony from Denver to New York.[56]\n\n\nOn the downside, with a 121\u2013102 loss to the Houston Rockets, the Timberwolves fell to 17\u201365, finishing last in the Western Conference for the second straight year. They also clinched the 2010\u201311 NBA season's worst record. During the offseason, the Timberwolves were finally able to bring 2009 fifth overall pick Ricky Rubio over from Spain. In the 2011 NBA draft, with the second overall pick, the Timberwolves selected Derrick Williams of Arizona. The Timberwolves then traded guard Jonny Flynn and the draft rights to Donatas Motiej\u016bnas (No. 20) to the Houston Rockets for center Brad Miller, the draft rights to Nikola Miroti\u0107 (No. 23), Chandler Parsons (No. 38) and a future first-round pick. The Timberwolves traded Mirotic's rights to the Chicago Bulls for the rights to Norris Cole (No. 28) and Malcolm Lee (No. 43). The Timberwolves then sold the rights to Parsons back to the Rockets. The Timberwolves traded Norris Cole (No. 28) to the Miami Heat for the draft rights to Bojan Bogdanovic (No. 31), a future second-round pick and cash considerations. The Timberwolves then traded Bogdanovic's rights to the New Jersey Nets for a future second-rounder and cash. The Trail Blazers traded the draft rights to Tanguy Ngombo (No. 57) to the Timberwolves.[57]\n\n\nOn July 12, 2011, Kurt Rambis was fired as coach of the team after compiling a 32\u2013132 record in two seasons with the team. On September 13, 2011, the team announced that they had hired Rick Adelman to be the team's new head coach.[58][59]\n\n\nThe Timberwolves began the 2011\u201312 NBA season with a 17\u201317 record before the All-Star break.[60] On March 9, 2012, Rubio tore his left ACL and LCL in a collision with Kobe Bryant. The injury ended his season and severely hurt the Timberwolves' chances of making the playoffs. Despite being in contention at mid-season, the team ultimately failed to reach the postseason for the eighth straight year due to injuries to a number of key players.[61][62][63] The team finished with a record of 26\u201340, with the only win of the team's final 14 games coming against the Detroit Pistons. The team traded the 18th overall pick of the 2012 NBA draft to the Houston Rockets for Chase Budinger.[64][65][66][67]\n\n\nOn June 26, 2012, the Timberwolves selected Robbie Hummel with the 58th overall pick, the team's only selection during the draft.[68] During the offseason, the team signed former Timberwolves draft pick Brandon Roy to a two-year, $10 million contract.[69] The deal was announced on July 31.[70] With the inclusion of Roy in the shooting guard position, players that also signed during the offseason included Andrei Kirilenko, Alexey Shved and Louis Amundson. While technically in playoff contention early, multiple injuries began to plague the team. Roy, Budinger, Lee and free-agent signing Josh Howard succumbed to knee injuries. The mood of despair was shortly lifted by the splashy return of Rubio.[71] But not long after, Love, who missed the first nine games of the season after fracturing the third and fourth metacarpals in his right hand in a preseason home workout, suffered a recurrence of the injury in a win over the Denver Nuggets on January 3.[72] One of the few highlights in the second half of the season was Rubio's triple-double performance during a surprising win over the then-first place San Antonio Spurs, albeit without Spurs stars Tony Parker and Tim Duncan playing due to injury.[73] On April 6, in a game against the Detroit Pistons, Adelman won his 1000th game as a head coach.[74] This season marked the first time the franchise had won at least 30 games without Kevin Garnett on the roster.[75] The team decided to part ways with David Kahn after the season ended, with Flip Saunders being brought in to replace him.[76] In the 2013 NBA draft, the team traded the 9th overall pick Trey Burke for Shabazz Muhammad (14th pick) and Gorgui Dieng (21st pick) in the first round from the Utah Jazz.[77]\n\n\nOn March 28, 2014, the Timberwolves set a franchise record for points in a regular-season game with a 143\u2013107 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. The win also marked the Timberwolves' first season-series win over the Lakers since the 2005\u201306 season.[78] The team accumulated 40 wins for the first time since the 2005 season, but missed the playoffs for the tenth consecutive year, despite holding the league's highest point differential at the end of the season.[79] On April 21, 2014, Rick Adelman announced his retirement from coaching in the NBA. Adelman acquired a 97\u2013133 record in three seasons with the team.\n\n\n\n### 2014\u20132020: The Wiggins and Towns era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kevin Garnett's first game back with the Timberwolves in 2015.\nOn August 23, 2014, the Timberwolves, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Philadelphia 76ers agreed on a three-way trade that would send Kevin Love to the Cavaliers to join LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. Minnesota received Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Thaddeus Young, and a trade exception as part of the deal. The 76ers received Alexey Shved, Luc Mbah a Moute, and a 2015 first-round pick via the Miami Heat.[80]\n\n\nThe 2014\u201315 season marked a new era for the Timberwolves, beginning with the Kevin Love trade. Flip Saunders was promoted to head coach, making it his second stint with the Timberwolves after coaching the team from 1995 to 2005. The Timberwolves started the new season with a 105\u2013101 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, with Wiggins making his debut. The team recorded its first win the following game, a 97\u201391 victory over the Detroit Pistons.[81] On November 12, 2014, the Timberwolves played an international home game at Mexico City Arena against the Houston Rockets. The Timberwolves had a 16\u201366 record for the season and missed the playoffs for the 11th consecutive year.\n\n\nDespite this, Wiggins was selected as the NBA Rookie of the Year, the first player in franchise history to be so honored. Draft pick Zach LaVine gained league notoriety after winning the Slam Dunk Contest. LaVine and Wiggins, dubbed \"The Bounce Brothers\", were seen as being the future of the franchise.[82]\n\n\n\n\"The Bounce Brothers\"\n![](image)\nAndrew Wiggins\n![](image)\nZach LaVine\n\nDue to having the worst record in the NBA for the 2014\u201315 season, the Timberwolves had the highest chance, at 25%, to receive the first pick in the 2015 NBA draft at the 2015 NBA draft lottery. On May 19, the Timberwolves received the first overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft for the first time in franchise history. On June 25, the Timberwolves selected Karl-Anthony Towns as the number one pick and acquired Minnesota's own Tyus Jones through a trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n\nThe 2015 season also saw the return of Kevin Garnett. In February, Garnett, at the time with the Brooklyn Nets, waived his no-trade clause to enable a trade back to Minnesota which sent Thaddeus Young to Brooklyn. In his first game back, Garnett resumed wearing the No. 21 jersey that had not been worn by any other Timberwolves player since his departure and the team defeated the Washington Wizards 97\u201377 at the Target Center.\n\n\nOn June 6, 2014, Saunders was named the head coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves, returning to the franchise for a second stint.[83] During his second stint with the Timberwolves, Saunders was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. As a result, during his recovery, he would delegate his coaching position over to assistant coach and former NBA Coach of the Year winner Sam Mitchell. On October 25, 2015, Saunders died at age 60. Mitchell took over as head coach. In honor of Saunders, the team announced that they would wear a patch reading \"FLIP\" on their uniforms for the duration of the 2015\u201316 season.[84]\n\n\n\n#### 2016\u20132019: The Tom Thibodeau saga[edit]\n\n\nOn April 20, 2016, the Timberwolves agreed to sign Tom Thibodeau to be their head coach and president of basketball operations. He was previously an assistant coach for the team from 1989 to 1991.[85] On September 23, 2016, Kevin Garnett announced his retirement after 21 seasons in the NBA. He expressed interest in playing one more year for the Timberwolves but felt that his knees would be unable to hold up for the duration of the season. The Timberwolves ended their season with a 31\u201351 record, having only a two-game improvement from their previous season.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAndrew Wiggins\n![](image)\nKarl-Anthony Towns\n\n![](image)Derrick Rose warming up with the Timberwolves.\n#### 2018: The Arrival of Jimmy Butler and the return to the playoffs[edit]\n\n\nOn June 22, 2017, the Timberwolves acquired Jimmy Butler and the 16th overall pick in the 2017 draft in trade for Zach Lavine, Kris Dunn and the 7th overall pick in the draft (used to select Lauri Markkanen).[86] This trade marked the end of the LaVine and Wiggins duo, dubbed \"Bounce Brothers\". Later that night, the Timberwolves selected center Justin Patton with the 16th overall pick in the draft. Later, the team added Taj Gibson, Jeff Teague, Jamal Crawford and Derrick Rose during free agency. The Timberwolves ended their season with a 47\u201335 record, which became the first winning season since the 2004\u201305 season, and secured the last spot in the playoffs on the final day of the regular season with a 112\u2013106 win over the Denver Nuggets. The 2017\u201318 season also ended the longest streak without a playoff appearance at 13 seasons. The Timberwolves would be eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Houston Rockets in five games.\n\n\nOn November 12, 2018, the Timberwolves traded Butler and Justin Patton to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Robert Covington, Dario \u0160ari\u0107, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round draft pick.[87] On January 6, 2019, Thibodeau was fired as head coach and president of basketball operations. After Thibodeau's firing, it was announced that Ryan Saunders would serve as interim head coach until a permanent head coach is found.[88]\n\n\n\n### 2020\u2013present: The Towns/Gobert/Edwards (Big Three) era and new ownership[edit]\n\n\nOn May 1, it was announced that the Timberwolves had hired Gersson Rosas, who previously served as the Houston Rockets' executive vice president of basketball operations, as their new president of basketball operations.[89] On May 20, after conducting interviews with several candidates, the Timberwolves announced that Ryan Saunders had been hired to a multi-year deal to become the team's permanent head coach, removing his \"interim\" status.[90][91] With Rosas' hiring, the Timberwolves also made several front office changes in the organization. The Timberwolves held both a first- and second-round draft pick in the 2019 NBA draft. The 11th pick (which was Cameron Johnson) along with Dario \u0160ari\u0107 was traded to the Suns in exchange for the 6th pick in Jarrett Culver, a small forward from Texas Tech. With the 43rd pick, the Timberwolves selected Jaylen Nowell, a point guard from Washington.\n\n\nOn February 6, 2020, The Timberwolves traded Andrew Wiggins to the Golden State Warriors for Karl-Anthony Towns' longtime friend D'Angelo Russell. At the season's end the Timberwolves got the 1st pick in the 2020 NBA draft.[92] With that pick, the team drafted Anthony Edwards out of Georgia.[93]\n\n\nOn February 21, 2021, head coach Ryan Saunders was fired, and Toronto Raptors assistant coach Chris Finch was hired to replace him.[94][95] The Timberwolves finished the season 23-49 and missing the playoffs.[96]\n\n\nIn April 2021, the Timberwolves announced that owner Glen Taylor had reached a deal with Marc Lore and Alex Rodriguez to sell the team. Lore and Rodriguez will become majority owners over the course of two years. On July 21, 2021, it was announced that Lore and Rodriguez had purchased 20% of the team. They will purchase 20% more in 2022, and 40% more in 2023, at which time they will be the majority owners of the club. The transaction also includes ownership in the Timberwolves' WNBA sister-club, the Minnesota Lynx.[97] The deal values the team at $1.5 billion.[98]\n\n\nIn the offseason the Wolves traded guard Ricky Rubio to the Cleveland Cavaliers for forward Taurean Prince.[99] The Wolves then acquired guard Patrick Beverley in exchange for Juancho Hernangomez and former first round pick Jarrett Culver.[100] The final move they made was signing former 2020 draft pick Leandro Bolmaro to a 4-year, 11.8-million-dollar rookie contract.[101]\n\n\nOn September 22, 2021, after Gersson Rosas was relieved of his President of Basketball Operations duties,[102] Sachin Gupta was promoted as the new interim President of Basketball Operations, while keeping his role as EVP of Basketball Operations.[103]\n\n\nThe Timberwolves 2021-22 season began on October 20 at Target Center against the Houston Rockets.[104] The Timberwolves finished the season 46-36 overall, the second most regular season wins since making the conference finals in 2004. Despite All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns fouling out with 11 points in 24 minutes, the Wolves beat the LA Clippers in the 7-8 play-in game to secure their spot in the 2022 NBA playoffs. The Timberwolves were eliminated by the Memphis Grizzlies in the First Round 4 games to 2.[105]\n\n\nOn May 23, 2022 it was announced that the Timberwolves had hired Tim Connelly, who previously served as the Denver Nuggets' president of basketball operations, as their president of basketball operations, taking over Gupta\u2019s job. He was reportedly signed to a 5-year, $40 million contract by the Timberwolves, that includes ownership equity.[106]\n\n\nOn July 1, 2022 the Timberwolves traded Malik Beasley, Patrick Beverley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Leandro Bolmaro, and 2022 #22 pick Walker Kessler and 4 future first round draft picks for 3x NBA DPOY Rudy Gobert from the Utah Jazz.[107]\n\n\nThe Timberwolves began the 2022\u201323 season with high expectations following the Gobert trade. They were dealt a blow on November 28, 2022, when Karl-Anthony Towns suffered a severe calf strain that cost him 52 games.[108] The injury pushed Anthony Edwards into a leadership role,[109] with the first-time All-Star guiding the team to a 42-40 finish and a play-in tournament berth. After falling to the Los Angeles Lakers in the first game, the Timberwolves secured the 8th seed with a 25-point win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.[110] They went on to lose to the #1 seed (and eventual NBA champion) Denver Nuggets in the First Round, 4 games to 1.[111]\n\n\n\n## Logos and uniforms[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Minnesota Timberwolves' wordmark logo used from 2008 to 2017.\nIn their inaugural season in 1989, the Timberwolves (or \"Wolves\" as it said on their jerseys) debuted blue road uniforms with green lettering and numbers with white. Their home uniforms featured blue lettering and numbers with green outlining. The creation of both uniforms was led by head designer, Brian Mulligan.[112] There was going to be a green alternate jersey with blue lettering to go with the uniforms, but the idea was dropped. It would've followed a similar move the Dallas Mavericks took when they switched back to blue in the early 1990s, opting the Wolves a chance to use green for a jersey color instead.[112] The Timberwolves would resurrect the blue uniforms from this era during the 2009\u201310 season, as part of the franchise's 20th anniversary.[113]\n\n\nAfter drafting Kevin Garnett, the Timberwolves design team, under guidance from Brian Mulligan, changed their uniforms yet again in 1996.[112] This time, the team added black and gray to the mix, and changing to a darker shade of blue.[112] The front of the jerseys then said the team's full name \"Timberwolves\" in a different font. For the 1997\u201398 season, a black alternate uniform was introduced. Those uniforms were used until the 2007\u201308 season.[112] The Timberwolves unveiled a new alternate logo on June 25, 2008.[114]\n\n\nThe uniforms changed again in the 2008 off-season, this time with the road jerseys reading \"Minnesota\" and the home jerseys reading \"Wolves\", similar to that of the team's early years. Both uniforms had green, black, gray and blue on the pits and sides of the shorts.[115] The Timberwolves unveiled modified uniforms on August 16, 2010. The new uniforms eliminated the green from the collar, jersey and shorts, and the team also adjusted its number font again.[116] On November 23, 2010, the Timberwolves unveiled a black alternate uniform.[117][118] On November 27, 2013, the team changed their black road alternate jersey to a short sleeved jersey. The change came about due to the NBA's introduction of sleeved jerseys.[119]\n\n\nOn April 11, 2017, the team unveiled a new logo to coincide with the massive roster turnaround of the past few years.[120][4] The Timberwolves revealed four new uniforms for the 2017\u201318 season as a part of a Nike-sponsored, league-wide initiative to redesign team uniforms.[121][122] All four uniforms used \"Wolves\" for the team name and included the Nike Swoosh and Fitbit logos. The Association Edition uniform, revealed on August 10, 2017, consisted of a white uniform with navy and blue stripes and lettering.[121][123] The Icon Edition uniform, which was revealed alongside its Association counterpart, has a navy body with white stripes and lettering.[121][123] On September 15, the Timberwolves revealed their Statement Edition uniform which is primarily neon green with navy stripes, navy lettering for the team and player names, and white text with a navy stroke for the jersey numbers.[124][125] The City Edition uniform, which is primarily gray with white lettering, was the last to be revealed on December 27.[126][127]\n\n\nOn August 30, 2018, the Timberwolves unveiled their first \"Classic\" edition uniforms based on the black alternates used from 1997 to 2008.[128] They also unveiled a dark purple \"City\" uniform inspired by Prince's 1984 album *Purple Rain*, as well as a white \"Earned\" version that was exclusive only to the 16 teams that made the 2018 playoffs.[129][130]\n\n\nThe Timberwolves' 2019\u201320 \"City\" uniform, which was unveiled on November 20, 2019, featured a sky blue base with white letters and trim that paid homage to the waters of the Mississippi River and the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area (the \"Twin Cities\").[131]\n\n\nFor the 2020\u201321 season, the Timberwolves' \"City\" uniform paid homage to the North Star, featuring a midnight black base and aurora green trim. A green star is affixed below the neckline and above the abbreviation \"MINN\" in gray.[132]\n\n\nAs part of the NBA's 75th anniversary, the Timberwolves' \"City\" uniform in the 2021\u201322 season mixed various elements from the franchise's previous uniforms. The royal blue base recalled the original 1989\u20131996 uniforms. The tree accents and lettering visually honored the 1996\u20132008 uniforms. The dark blue accents were inspired by the 2017\u201318 \"City\" uniforms. The original 1989\u20131996 logo was placed on the right leg, while the current logo was affixed on the left leg.[133]\n\n\nBeginning with the 2022\u201323 season, the Timberwolves unveiled a new \"Statement\" uniform, relegating neon green to trim color and featured a dark gray base. The full name \"Timberwolves\" was featured in front along with green-trimmed gray numbers.[134] Also during the season, a new \"City\" uniform was unveiled, featuring a white base, black letters and stripes, and rainbow palette to represent Minnesota's colorful community.[135]\n\n\nThe \"City\" uniform in the 2023\u201324 season featured a mostly blue base with white lake water gradients; the design represented the fun summertime activities of Minnesota's citizens, from camping to fishing and swimming.[136] A special alternate court for the 2023 NBA in-season tournament was also unveiled to go with this uniform, featuring a light blue base with a lakewater blue strip in the middle.[137] Also for the season, the Timberwolves brought back the original 1989\u20131996 white uniform for its \"Classic\" edition, this to celebrate the franchise's 35th season.[138]\n\n\n\n## Mascot[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Crunch the Wolf\n**Crunch the Wolf** is the official mascot of the Minnesota Timberwolves, According to the team's official website, \"Crunch was born in the northernmost part of Minnesota\u2019s wilderness areas. Deep in the forest, he grew with a love for something never before seen by others in his pack. Crunch's love for the game of basketball puzzled his mother and father, for he seemed to pick up the game on his own. With a makeshift basket built of pine-cones and birch bark, Crunch began to refine his game when he was still just a young pup. He learned the rules and techniques that make the game of basketball so great. He studied players and coaches alike, and soon would find himself on a journey like no other. Years later, when Minnesota\u2019s expansion team, the Timberwolves, came to town, Crunch said goodbye to all he had known growing up in the woods, and migrated south to the Twin Cities where the team was to be based. No one is quite sure where Crunch lives, but legend has it he has a den somewhere deep inside the Target Center. He is lured out on game-days by the deafening howl made by Wolves fans. This howl creates an atmosphere in the Target Center that reminds Crunch of his days back in the forest, and yet keeps him here in Minneapolis, with the pursuit of helping the team to a victory.\"[139]\n\n\n\n## Arenas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Arenas** |\n| Arena\n | Tenure\n |\n| Hubert H.

The Clippers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. The Clippers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, which they share with NBA team Los Angeles Lakers, the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Clippers plan to move into their own arena, the Intuit Dome in nearby Inglewood, by 2024.\n\n\nThe franchise was founded as the **Buffalo Braves** in 1970 as an expansion team. Led by Hall of Famer Bob McAdoo, the Braves reached the NBA playoffs three times during their eight seasons in Buffalo. Conflicts with the Canisius Golden Griffins over the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium and the sale of the franchise led to their relocation from Buffalo to San Diego, California in 1978 and subsequent rebranding as the **San Diego Clippers**, in reference to the sailing ships synonymous with San Diego Bay.[9] The team saw little success on the court and missed the playoffs during all six of their years in San Diego.\n\n\nIn 1984, owner Donald Sterling controversially relocated the franchise to Los Angeles without NBA approval. The NBA spent more than three years on a lawsuit to force the team back to San Diego before eventually dropping the suit in exchange for Sterling paying a fine. Over the course of their first 27 seasons in Los Angeles, the Clippers qualified for the postseason only four times and won a single playoff round. They were frequently considered a perennial loser in American professional sports, drawing unfavorable comparisons to the historically successful Lakers.\n\n\nThe Clippers' reputation improved during the 2010s, which saw them transform into consistent postseason contenders. Aided by the \"Lob City\" lineup of Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, and Chris Paul, the team qualified for the playoffs in six consecutive seasons from 2012 to 2017 and won two consecutive division titles in 2013 and 2014, both firsts for the franchise. Despite this success, the Clippers struggled in the postseason and were frequently eliminated in the conference semifinals; the team reached the Conference finals for the first time in 2021. To date, they are the oldest franchise in North American professional sports to have never played in a championship game.\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The Braves qualified for the playoffs three times in a row, losing twice to the eventual Eastern Conference champions (the Boston Celtics in 1974 and 1976, and the Washington Bullets in 1975). Despite the team's modest success in Buffalo, Braves owner Paul Snyder and the league found it impossible to schedule home games at the auditorium because of the Canisius Golden Griffins men's basketball team, which had a pre-existing lease on the arena and priority on game dates over the Braves, with the next best dates in turn taken by the much more successful Sabres. At a time where the NBA was nearing a nadir and the league did not have its current prestige, the Griffins saw the Braves as a threat to their own success, and purposely scheduled all the best dates at the arena to prevent the Braves from succeeding. As a result, after a failed attempt to sell the team to an owner who intended to move it to South Florida, Snyder sold the team to Kentucky Colonels owner John Y. Brown, Jr., who decimated the team's roster, traded away all of its stars, and drove attendance down to the point where they could break their own lease on the arena.[13] Eventually, Brown met with Celtics owner Irv Levin in 1978 so they could trade franchise ownerships. Southern California resident Levin then decided to move the Braves to San Diego, something the league would have never allowed him to do with the Celtics.[14] Asked about the move, Levin nominated a shorter commute for himself as a key reason.[15]\n\n\n\n### 1978\u20131984: San Diego Clippers[edit]\n\n\nIn 1978, San Diego welcomed the relocation of the Buffalo Braves franchise, as the city's previous NBA franchise, the San Diego Rockets, had relocated to Houston seven years earlier in 1971. Another failed basketball franchise in the city had been the San Diego Conquistadors.[15] San Diego team officials did not think \"Braves\" was a proper representative nickname for the club in San Diego, and a local naming contest ultimately decided on \"Clippers\", in reference to the city being known for the great sailing ships that passed through San Diego Bay.[9] The first head coach of the Clippers was chosen to be Gene Shue, a respected tactician.[16] He preferred a fast playing style with many scoring opportunities.[16] Only three players from the Braves started in the team: Randy Smith, Swen Nater, and Scott Lloyd.[17] Other starting players included Kermit Washington, and Sidney Wicks.[16] World B. Free was also brought in, in exchange for a future first round pick for the Philadelphia 76ers.[17]\n\n\nThe 1978\u201379 season started off poorly, with the Clippers' first win only on the fourth game against the Chicago Bulls.[17] The team lost 12 of its 18 first games and dropped to the bottom of the Pacific Division.[18] Player Kevin Kunnert argued they had the \"killer instinct of a field mouse\".[18] The worst loss came against the San Antonio Spurs, with a loss of 163 to 125.[18] Nevertheless, within weeks, Free had become the leading scorer, as well as becoming a public icon.[18] He finished second overall in NBA scoring average, with 28.9 per game (George Gervin of the San Antonio Spurs had a 29.6 average). Shue, meanwhile, tried to create a team spirit by creating a common social life.[19] By the annual break for the All-Star game, however, the Clippers had improved, winning half of their 54 games, leading to a sixth ranking in the Western Conference.[20] Aiming for one of the six play-off spots for the Conference, they managed to win eight games in a row, and then another five games consecutively.[20] Playing at the San Diego Sports Arena, the Clippers posted a record of 43\u201339 in their first season in California under, leaving them two wins shy of the final playoff spot. It was also the first season in Southern California for long-time announcer Ralph Lawler began his association with the franchise.\n\n\nThe 1979\u201380 season saw the Clippers begin to struggle, despite adding center Bill Walton, a San Diego native who was two years removed from winning an NBA Championship and the NBA Most Valuable Player Award with the Portland Trail Blazers. Walton missed 68 games in his first season in San Diego due to foot injuries (which he also suffered in his final years in Portland). San Diego finished 35\u201347, as Walton and other key players missed significant time due to injuries. Free again finished second in league scoring, with 30.2 points per game. Paul Silas replaced Shue as head coach the following season, and the Clippers finished 36\u201346, again missing the postseason. Walton missed the entire season due to foot injuries, while Free was traded to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for guard Phil Smith.\n\n\nThe 1981\u201382 season brought ultimately unwelcome changes to the franchise as Levin sold the team to Los Angeles-area real estate developer and attorney Donald Sterling for $12.5 million. The Clippers experienced poor play, as foot injuries again caused Walton to miss the entire season, and the team limped to a 17\u201365 record. Rumors of a move to Sterling's hometown of Los Angeles and franchise mismanagement plagued the team immediately from the onset of Sterling's acquisition. On one occasion, Sterling was fined $10,000 by the NBA, the largest sum ever levied by the NBA against an owner at the time, for publicly guaranteeing the Clippers would lose enough games to contend for a high enough draft pick to select Ralph Sampson. On another, he was fined for flying his players to away games in coach seats on commercial airliners, a violation of the league's collective bargaining agreement. Hotels refused to house the Clippers because of alleged non-payment for previous accommodations on multiple occasions. A bus company in Newark once stranded the team at the airport after Sterling failed to pay for previous trips, which nearly caused the team to miss a scheduled regular-season game that day against the New Jersey Nets.[21]\n\n\nSterling attempted to relocate the franchise to Los Angeles in June 1982 but the NBA denied his request. Sterling then filed an unsuccessful antitrust lawsuit against the league, which subsequently filed a countersuit against the club and the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, which Sterling had a tentative agreement with to become the franchise's new home.[22] The attempted move, combined with the franchise mismanagement issues, prompted an investigation of the Clippers by an NBA committee of other owners. In September of that year, the committee recommended that Sterling's ownership be terminated, having found that he was late in paying creditors and players.[23] Days before a league scheduled vote in October to remove Sterling, he agreed to sell the team, and the league sought buyers who would keep the franchise in San Diego. At the suggestion of David Stern, then the league's vice president, Sterling was able to maintain his position as owner, by instead handing over operations duties of the franchise to Alan Rothenberg, who became the team's president. By February 1983, Stern called the Clippers a \"first-class\" franchise, and the ouster of Sterling was no longer pursued.[24] Later in 1983, Larry Fleisher, then the general counsel of the National Basketball Players Association, stated ''in all my years of involvement with the NBA, no team ever provided as much difficulties for the players than the Clippers under Sterling.\" \"He almost caused three strikes last season.''[23] The team's final two seasons in San Diego were not much better on the court despite Walton finally returning to the court, finishing 25\u201357 in 1982\u201383 and 30\u201352 in 1983\u201384.\n\n\nIn 1984, Sterling, despite again being denied permission from the NBA to do so, moved the Clippers north to Los Angeles. The NBA subsequently fined Sterling $25 million for violating league rules and filed a lawsuit demanding the franchise be returned to San Diego. The league threatened to dissolve the franchise if ownership did not comply and return the team to San Diego.[25][26] Sterling then filed another antitrust lawsuit against the league (for $100 million). This time, thanks to the court decision that allowed Al Davis to move the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League (NFL) to Los Angeles, it appeared Sterling would win his case. The league soon agreed to drop their lawsuit in exchange for Sterling dropping his case, allowing him to keep the team in Los Angeles and decreasing his fine to $6 million.[27]\n\n\n\n### 1984\u20131989: Move to Los Angeles, and early struggles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Los Angeles Clippers secondary logo from 1991 to 2010. A variation was used from 2010 to 2015.\nIn 1984, despite the pending lawsuits between franchise ownership and the NBA following the move, the Clippers began play at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.[27] The Clippers finished their first season in Los Angeles 31\u201351 under head coach Jim Lynam.\n\n\nThe Clippers' early days in Los Angeles were marred with many seasons of hapless performances. Despite fielding a squad of talented veterans, the organization suffered systematic injuries to many of its star players. The phenomenon was dubbed the \"Clipper Triangle\" by some sports writers.[28] Derek Smith suffered a knee injury during the 1985\u201386 season, followed by Norm Nixon (knee) and Marques Johnson (spinal cord) the following season.[28] The team's 12\u201370 finish in the 1987 season was the second-worst single-season record in NBA history at the time (and is now the third-worst winning percentage in NBA history, behind the 1973 Philadelphia 76ers and the 2012 Charlotte Bobcats). That same season also saw Hall of Famer Elgin Baylor join the team as the general manager and vice president of basketball operations. Nixon suffered an ailing Achilles tendon in 1987\u201388 season, while number one draft pick rookie Danny Manning injured his anterior cruciate ligament during the 1988\u201389 campaign.[28]\n\n\n\n### 1989\u20131994: Playoff appearances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ken Norman, the Clippers' scoring leader in 1988\u201389, was a key part of the team's nucleus during the late 1980s and early 1990s\nThe Clippers traded the rights to the recently drafted Danny Ferry and Reggie Williams for high-scoring shooting guard Ron Harper at the start of the 1989\u201390 season. Los Angeles had a 19\u201319 record nearly halfway into the season, prompting some to seriously consider the team as a possible playoff contender.[28] That move, along with the 1987 NBA draft of Ken Norman, the 1988 selections of Danny Manning and Charles Smith (Smith was acquired from Philadelphia in exchange for the draft rights to Hersey Hawkins), and the 1990 draft of Loy Vaught, formed a nucleus that would make the franchise a playoff contender.\n\n\nMidway through the 1991\u201392 season, the Clippers made yet another coaching change. Larry Brown, recently fired by the San Antonio Spurs, was hired as the team's head coach in late January 1992. He replaced Mike Schuler, who had led the team to a 22\u201325 record before his firing. Brown finished the season with a 23\u201312 mark, for a 45\u201337 overall\u2014the franchise's first winning season in 13 years. For the first time since moving to Los Angeles, they finished with a better record than the crosstown Los Angeles Lakers. The Clippers advanced to the playoffs for the first time in 16 years (since the franchise's Buffalo heyday), but were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Utah Jazz, 3\u20132. Due to the late April 1992 Los Angeles riots, the Anaheim Convention Center was the site of Game 4 of the series, which the Clippers won. The team made the playoffs again in the 1992\u201393 season with a 41\u201341 record, but lost again in five games in the first round, this time to the Rockets.\n\n\nBrown left to become the Indiana Pacers' head coach after the season and Bob Weiss was brought in to replace him. That 1993\u201394 season proved to be one of the worst in Los Angeles history, with the Clippers and Lakers going a combined 60\u2013104. In February 1994, the Clippers traded Manning to the Atlanta Hawks for Dominique Wilkins. Wilkins played 25 games for the club, averaging 29.1 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 2.2 assists in 37.9 minutes per game. After one year on the job, Weiss was fired, Wilkins left in free agency, and veteran head coach Bill Fitch was brought in to guide a new roster of young and inexperienced players.\n\n\n\n### 1994\u20132000: Fitch, Anaheim and the move to Staples Center[edit]\n\n\n#### Anaheim relocation talks[edit]\n\n\nAnaheim, a suburb approximately thirty miles (48\u00a0km) south of Downtown Los Angeles in Orange County, expressed interest in obtaining an NBA franchise. The city, expecting to lose the NFL's Los Angeles Rams (who relocated to St. Louis in 1995 for 21 seasons, before moving back to Los Angeles in 2016), was looking for a new professional team and began courting the Clippers, who struggled to carve out an identity competing against the popular Lakers for audience share. From 1994 to 1999, the Clippers played several games annually (usually five to eight regular-season games a season, and an annual preseason game) at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, sharing the venue with the NHL's Ducks and the Splash indoor soccer team. Clippers games regularly drew a much-higher average attendance per game at the Pond than when the team played its home games at their regular venue, the Los Angeles Sports Arena; the Anaheim games proved so popular that many Clippers players and much of the fan base, as well as the NBA, wanted to the team to stay in what was considered at the time a state-of-the-art arena.[*citation needed*] For instance, between 1994 and 1997, the Clippers drew an average of nearly 16,000 fans per game at the Pond, while in Los Angeles, they drew in the neighborhood of 9,200 per home game.[29] Anaheim officials and the Clippers had had on-going talks about moving to Anaheim full-time years before the Pond was eventually built,[30] as Donald Sterling was pursuing options to play elsewhere in the Los Angeles metropolitan region if there was not a replacement for the Sports Arena being built.\n\n\nThe Clippers, however, nearly moved to Anaheim permanently in time for the 1996\u201397 season, but according to a *Los Angeles Times* article published in June 1996,[31] owner Donald Sterling turned down a deal that would have paid the team $95 million over 12 years. Odgen Corporation, who at the time managed the Pond, and the city of Anaheim offered the Clippers a multi-tiered deal that would have included upwards of $33 million paid to the team over the first six years of their Pond agreement, plus other monies allocated towards new locker rooms, team offices, and a practice facility. In another related *Times* article,[32] Odgen and Sterling were in talks to have the management company take care of the Clippers' day-to-day operations for a $4 million a year fee. Also at the time, the Walt Disney Company, owners of the Ducks and Anaheim Angels baseball team during that period, were pursuing at least a partial ownership of the Clippers, with the key element being that its game telecasts would be part of a planned ESPN regional network for Southern California. However, as the planned ESPN West network never came to reality, all three teams had continued to maintain broadcast partnerships with Fox Sports West and Prime Ticket. This remained a sticking point in any deal to relocate to Anaheim, eventually leaving the team to remain in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n#### Bill Fitch era[edit]\n\n\nOn the court, the Clippers continued to make frequent roster changes throughout this particular period, which only resulted in one playoff appearance under Fitch. Along with Loy Vaught, a collection of young players (including Lamond Murray, Eric Piatkowski, and Lorenzen Wright), and journeyman veterans (among them Pooh Richardson, Tony Massenburg, Rodney Rogers, Darrick Martin, and Brian Williams), the Fitch-coached teams during this particular era struggled mightily, although they did make the playoffs once during this time. The 1996\u201397 team made the playoffs with a losing record (36\u201346) and were swept in the first round by the eventual Western Conference champions, the Utah Jazz, three games to none.\n\n\nFour members of the 1996\u201397 squad are now deceased. Malik Sealy died in a car accident in 2000, Kevin Duckworth died of heart disease in 2008, Lorenzen Wright went missing and was murdered in 2010, and Dwayne Schintzius died from cancer complications in 2012. Two other players from the Fitch era suffered tragic circumstances of their own; Brian Williams (who played for the Clippers during the 1995\u201396 season, and later became known as Bison Dele) was believed to have been murdered by his brother while the two were vacationing in 2002 while in the South Pacific, and Rodney Rogers became paralyzed after a dirt bike crash in 2008 in his native North Carolina.[33]\n\n\nIn December, Vaught, the team's leading scorer for the past three seasons, had season-ending back surgery. Without Vaught, the Clippers finished 17\u201365, the third-worst record in the league. Fitch was fired after the 1997\u201398 season (and later sued the team to recover the remaining money on his contract), and was replaced by one of his proteges, former Celtics and Bucks coach Chris Ford. Meanwhile, Vaught's career as a Clipper was effectively finished, as he left as a free agent after that season, and signed with the Detroit Pistons; at the time of his departure, he was the franchise's all-time rebounds leader with 4,471 (a number that was later surpassed by Elton Brand, with 4,710).[34]\n\n\nThe Clippers won the first overall pick in the 1998 Draft Lottery and selected center Michael Olowokandi from University of the Pacific. The team had a 0\u201317 start and finished with a 9\u201341 record in the lockout-shortened 1998\u201399 season. They were led by second-year forward Maurice Taylor, who averaged 16.8 points per game, and won the fourth overall pick in the following draft, which coincided with their move to the Staples Center. The Clippers would draft Lamar Odom, and then hired former All-Star (and Los Angeles native) Dennis Johnson as an assistant coach, as well as Hall of Fame former Laker great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to help tutor Olowokandi during his second-year. Johnson remained an assistant coach until the middle of the 2002\u201303 season, when he took over as head coach. Abdul-Jabbar remained only one season, detailing a lack of improvement in Olowokandi, who is largely considered one of the biggest draft busts in league history.\n\n\nDuring the 1999 off-season, Rodney Rogers signed with the Phoenix Suns. The Clippers also sent Lamond Murray to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Derek Anderson and Johnny Newman. However, Newman was then traded to the New Jersey Nets for Eric Murdock a month later without ever playing a game for the Clippers. The team finished with the worst record in the league (15\u201367) in the 1999\u20132000 season, while the Lakers had the best record that year (67\u201315), and won the NBA championship.\n\n\n\n#### Move to Staples Center[edit]\n\n\nIn what was supposed to be a counter-move, the Coliseum Commission, the management entity that managed the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and Coliseum, had planned to build a new 18,700-seat arena in the parking lot next to the Sports Arena that would have cost up to $94 million, that would have included 1,100 club seats, 84 luxury suites, and an on-site practice facility for the Clippers. However, those plans were scuttled once planning for Staples Center (two miles directly up the street from the Sports Arena) were taking place, and the Clippers decided to become a tenant at Staples.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1999, the Clippers joined the Lakers and Los Angeles Kings in the new Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles.[35] In sharing the building with other tenants, such as the more popular Lakers, the Clippers, with relatively low success, were often overshadowed.[*citation needed*] Also, because of the terms of its leasing agreement with Staples Center, the Kings and Lakers had scheduling priority over the Clippers, with the Clippers taking whatever dates that were available, including scheduling same-day Clipper-Laker and Clipper-King doubleheaders. However, in the years after, the Clippers' scheduling at Staples Center became gradually more favorable (especially given the popularity of the team in recent years) in their lease renewals in 2004 and 2013, with the team receiving increased profits, including more of a share of luxury suite and concession revenue. Since February 2011, the Clippers have sold out every regular season and postseason home game, behind the popularity of stars Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, and Chris Paul.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2000\u20132009: Further struggles at Staples Center[edit]\n\n\nThe 2000\u201301 season brought changes. Derek Strong was sent to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Corey Maggette and the draft rights to Keyon Dooling. The Clippers' two draft picks that year were childhood friends from Illinois: high schooler Darius Miles (3rd overall pick) and Quentin Richardson (18th overall pick). The team became popular among fans with its high-flying style of basketball and the Clippers did improve slightly, registering a 31\u201351 record. The team also lead the NBA in bench-scoring, with 37 points per game.\n\n\nTo improve upon the previous season, the Clippers acquired high-scoring and rebounding power forward Elton Brand from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for the draft rights to Tyson Chandler. Brand earned a spot on the 2002 NBA Western Conference All-Star team as an injury replacement for Shaquille O'Neal. The Clippers contended for most of the season, but won only 3 of the last 12 games and finished 39\u201343, five games out of the playoffs. In order to seriously challenge for playoff contention in 2003, the franchise traded Miles to the Cavaliers for Andre Miller, who led the NBA in assists in 2001\u201302 with 11 per game. With a seasoned point guard in Miller, Lamar Odom at small forward, one of the league's best power forwards in Brand, and center Olowokandi, as well as having the best supporting cast in the league, the Clippers threatened a potential playoff run. However, poor team chemistry and injuries (the Clippers lost 293 man-games to injury), they finished with a disappointing 27\u201355 record. Coach Alvin Gentry was also replaced, with Dennis Johnson entering midway through the 2002\u201303 season.\n\n\nAfter the dismal season prior, the team lost several of its core players, with Miller, Odom, Olowakandi, and forward Eric Piatkowski (who was one of the longest-tenured players in franchise history)[36] departing via free agency prior to the 2003\u201304 season. The team opted to retain Brand and Maggette with long-term contracts. They, along with Richardson, made up one of the NBA's best high-scoring trios, with a combined 58 points per game. With new head coach Mike Dunleavy, Sr., they finished 28\u201354, due to inexperience and injuries. The following season again saw the team missing the playoffs, although, they posted a better record than the Lakers for the first time since 1993. Bobby Simmons, a former second-round pick, won the 2004\u201305 NBA Most Improved Player award after averaging 16 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists per game. As a result, Simmons signed a 5-year, $47\u00a0million deal with the Milwaukee Bucks. To counter Simmons' defection, the Clippers announced they would sign Cuttino Mobley. Mobley's contract was identical in length, but for five million less than Simmons', and marked the first significant free-agent signing from outside the organization since Walton in the late 1970s. The Clippers also completed the building of a practice facility (the first NBA practice facility within the four corners of the City of Los Angeles) in the Playa Vista development.[37] Midway through the season, the Clippers traded Marko Jari\u0107 (in a sign and trade transaction) and Lionel Chalmers to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Sam Cassell and a lottery-protected first round pick in the 2006 NBA draft.\n\n\nThe 2005\u201306 season was a turning point for the team's image; marked by several wins over top teams, Brand's performances were greatly praised, and he was chosen for the All-Star Game. Many sports writers noted the team's improvement, especially after acquiring sharpshooter Vladimir Radmanovi\u0107 from the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for big-man Chris Wilcox.[*citation needed*] While the team had a few stretches of poor play, they were able to maintain a solid record, including posting several winning streaks. They achieved their first winning record in 14 seasons, and clinched their first playoff spot since 1997. They also finished with a better record than the Lakers for the second straight year. By finishing sixth in the Western Conference, with a record of 47\u201335 (their highest finish since the team left Buffalo), they benefited from the current NBA playoff format of regular-season records taking precedence over winning the division, and secured home court advantage over the Denver Nuggets.\n\n\nOn April 22, 2006, the Clippers won their first NBA playoff game in 13 years. Two days later, they won their second playoff game, going 2\u20130 against an opponent for the first time in franchise history. They lost Game 3, won Game 4, and on May 1, they won Game 5 in Los Angeles. This would mark their first playoff series win since they moved from Buffalo. In the next round, the team faced the Phoenix Suns. After losing a close Game 1, they won Game 2, 122\u201397. The series shifted to Staples Center for Game 3, but the Suns won, 94\u201391. In Game 4, Brand posted 30 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists as the Clippers evened the series. In Game 5, Raja Bell made a key 3-pointer for the Suns with 1.1 seconds left in the first overtime to send the game into a second overtime. However, Phoenix won in double-overtime, 125\u2013118. They bounced back with a series-saving 118\u2013106 Game 6 win. Second-year defensive specialist Quinton Ross had a timely offensive game, scoring a then career-high 18 points. Brand had 30 points (his scoring average in this series), 12 rebounds, and five blocks. Corey Maggette came off the bench to score 25 points, with 7\u20138 shooting from the field, and 9\u20139 from the free-throw line. Kaman and Cassell each scored 15 points. However, the Clippers lost the seventh game, 127\u2013107. General Manager (and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame member) Elgin Baylor won the NBA Executive of the Year award for leading the Clippers' playoff run.\n\n\nThe 2006 off-season started as the team drafted Paul Davis in the second round of the 2006 NBA draft, as the 34th overall pick. The pick was acquired by the Clippers by way of a 2004 trade for Melvin Ely. The team also drafted Guillermo Diaz as the 52nd overall pick. While Davis signed with the team, Diaz decided to play overseas. However, the team still holds his draft rights. Meanwhile, in free agency, they signed Tim Thomas away from divisional Phoenix, in a four-year, $24\u00a0million deal. That was to counter the defection of Vladimir Radmanovi\u0107 to the Lakers in a similar deal. Radmanovic's contract lasted another year, but both players would make the same amount of money annually, which would be $6\u00a0million. Cassell (widely credited as the biggest reason for the Clippers' recent success) re-signed on a two-year, $13\u00a0million deal, while the team also signed veteran Aaron Williams to an undisclosed deal.\n\n\nIn September, the Clippers also announced a radio broadcast deal with KSPN-AM, the local ESPN Radio-operated outlet. Despite several additions, the team did not perform to expectations, with a lack of team chemistry and injuries to several key players, including Cassell, Thomas, and Kaman, forcing the team to sign journeymen Luke Jackson, Alvin Williams, and Doug Christie to help solidify the team's bench. The season disappointment extended as Shaun Livingston suffered a dislocated left knee in which he tore every ligament in his knee. This was one of the most devastating injuries that season, and considered one of the worst in league history.[38] The extent of the injury was so severe, local news outlets such as KCBS-TV/KCAL-TV and KNBC-TV elected not to air the clip of the injury. According to the team's lead physician, Dr. Tony Daly, Livingston's prognosis for him to return to basketball activity was eight months (which was around the first week of the upcoming season) to a full calendar year.[39] The Clippers finished the season 40\u201342, two games behind the eighth-seed, while the Lakers finished with a better record for the first time since the 2003\u201304 season. The Clippers received the 14th draft pick from the NBA lottery in the 2007 NBA Draft, selecting Al Thornton.\n\n\nThe 2007\u201308 season started off negatively, with Brand rupturing his left Achilles tendon. Brand missed most of the season, and the team struggled to stay competitive. Chris Kaman took advantage of a depleted roster by averaging 15.7 points and 12.7 rebounds per game, but was limited to playing 56 games, also due to various injuries. The Clippers ended the season 23\u201359, and the team aimed to rebuild for the following season. Both Brand and Maggette were allowed to depart, while ten players were acquired. Brand stated his desire to stay, but the contract faltered, allowing him to move to the Philadelphia 76ers. Baron Davis, a Los Angeles native and formerly of the Golden State Warriors, signed a five-year contract with the Clippers, worth an estimated $65\u00a0million.[40] In the upcoming draft, the Clippers obtained the seventh pick, and selected Eric Gordon.[41] They also selected DeAndre Jordan, who was picked 35th overall. Mike Taylor, the 55th overall pick, was acquired from the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for a future second-round pick.\n\n\nIn July 2008, they acquired Marcus Camby from the Denver Nuggets in return for a $10\u00a0million trade exception and the choice to exchange second round picks with the Clippers in 2010.[42] The Clippers also acquired guard Jason Hart from the Utah Jazz, in exchange for guard Brevin Knight,[43] and signed Ricky Davis to a one-year deal.[44] They continued an active off-season by re-signing former Clippers player Brian Skinner in July, while trading for Steve Novak. The team would also sign Jason Williams to a one-year deal.[45] However, just prior to the start of training camp in September, Williams announced his retirement. Other mid-season acquisitions came in the form of Zach Randolph and Mardy Collins, who arrived from the New York Knicks in exchange for Tim Thomas and Cuttino Mobley.[46] This trade made Kaman the sole member still on the team from their playoff run two years prior.\n\n\nIn October 2008, Baylor ended his 22-year reign as vice president and general manager of basketball operations. It remains one of the longest tenures in professional sports history. The Clippers indicated that Baylor had retired from his post,[47] and as a result, head coach Mike Dunleavy, Sr. assumed the role of General Manager, while director of player personnel Neil Olshey was promoted to assistant general manager.[48][49][50] However, several other reports indicated Baylor had been fired or resigned, and when questioned, Baylor responded he had been advised by his attorneys not to comment on the matter.[51] This prompted speculation that the team and Baylor were in negotiations to work out a settlement agreement for his departure, with Baylor reportedly working without a formal contract since the early 1990s.\n\n\nThe 2008\u201309 season ended with the team 14th in the Western Conference, with a record of 19\u201363.[52] They were then awarded the first overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft.\n\n\n\n### 2009\u20132011: The arrival of Blake Griffin and steady improvement[edit]\n\n\nWith the first overall pick, the team selected Blake Griffin. To clear a spot in the lineup for him, they traded Zach Randolph to Memphis for Quentin Richardson. Richardson was then traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Sebastian Telfair, Craig Smith, and Mark Madsen.[53]\n\n\nGriffin immediately impressed in training camp and preseason. On October 23, he broke his kneecap during the Clippers' final exhibition game against the New Orleans Hornets, following a dunk. Initially, the Clippers' stated that he only had a sore left knee, which would make him questionable for the season opener the following night, before they revealed the break. The injury sidelined Griffin for the entire season.[54]\n\n\nOn February 4, 2010, head coach Mike Dunleavy resigned, and Kim Hughes was named interim coach.[55] Dunleavy retained his front-office title and duties for just over a month, but on March 10 he was fired as General Manager, being replaced by Neil Olshey. Dunleavy received the news of his dismissal from the internet, as well as friends and reporters calling his cell phone.[56] The Los Angeles Times reported that Dunleavy had filed for arbitration and that the Clippers had cut off his salary, even though his guaranteed contract did not end until after the 2010\u201311 season.[57] Although the Clippers saw minor improvement, finishing with ten more wins at 29\u201353, Hughes was fired as head coach at the end of the season.\n\n\nIn July, former Chicago Bulls coach Vinny Del Negro was hired as the next head coach.[58] In August, the team introduced new uniform designs at a photoshoot, at the team's practice facility. Griffin and DeAndre Jordan, who saw significant improvement in his two years with the team, modeled the new uniforms, which were re-designed for the first time since the 2000\u201301 season.[59] The Clippers' primary and secondary logos, which are modifications of the previous ones, were introduced to the public weeks earlier, on the night of the 2010 NBA draft, where the Clippers selected Al-Farouq Aminu eighth overall.\n\n\nWith an improved Gordon, stalwart Kaman, rookie Aminu, starting center Jordan, a re-energized Baron Davis, and the debut of Griffin, the Clippers had high hopes for the season. However, they started slowly, losing ten of the first 11 games, with Davis and Kaman out with injuries. However, the Clippers showed strength when three of their first four wins came from the top teams in the Western Conference. Griffin got off to a strong start, drawing increased media attention in Clippers games and boosting ratings of local broadcasts of Clippers games.[60] Griffin was chosen as a Western Conference Reserve in the 2011 NBA All-Star Game, a rare honor for a rookie, the first chosen by the coaches for the game since Tim Duncan in 1997. He also won the NBA Sprite Slam Dunk Contest, and was named the Rookie of the Year as the team finished with a record of 32\u201350. As the trade deadline approached, the Clippers sent Baron Davis along with their 2011 first-round draft pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Mo Williams and Jamario Moon. The pick eventually became the number one overall pick, which the Cavaliers used to select Kyrie Irving.\n\n\n\n### 2011\u20132017: Arrival of Chris Paul and Lob City[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nBlake Griffin\n![](image)\nChris Paul\n![](image)\nDeAndre Jordan\n\nIn December 2011, the Clippers signed Caron Butler to a $24 million deal and claimed veteran point guard Chauncey Billups three days later. On December 14, they traded Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu and Minnesota's 2012 first-round pick acquired in 2005 for New Orleans Hornets' four-time all-star Chris Paul. Paul had previously almost been traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, but NBA commissioner David Stern had vetoed the trade (the NBA was owner of the Hornets at the time). Paul and Griffin were selected as starters for the Western Conference team in the 2012 NBA All-Star Game, the first time in franchise history the team had two All-Star starters in the same year.\n\n\nThe team gained the nickname \"Lob City\" due to a comment made by Griffin during the Clippers Media Day when the announcement of Chris Paul's trade reached the team. Griffin, after being told the news by Jordan, declared, \"Yeah! It's going to be lob city!\"[61]\n\n\nIn February 2012, the Clippers signed Kenyon Martin. An 11-year NBA veteran and former NBA All-Star (2004), Martin joined the Clippers after signing with the Xinjiang Guanghui Flying Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association the previous summer. On February 6, 2012, during a game against the Orlando Magic, Billups tore his Achilles tendon and missed the remainder of the season. In March 2012, Nick Young joined the Clippers as part of a three-team trade with the Washington Wizards and the Denver Nuggets. He became the eighth player to debut in the 2011\u201312 season.\n\n\nAfter a stretch that saw the Clippers lose 12 of 19 games after Billups's season-ending injury, with rumors of Vinny Del Negro's career as head coach of the Clippers possibly coming to an abrupt end, Los Angeles went on a tear.[62] The Clippers won 12 of their next 14 games, including road wins over the defending champions Dallas Mavericks and the Western Conference-leading Oklahoma City Thunder, clinching their fifth playoff berth since their 1976 conference semifinals loss to the Boston Celtics (the last time they made the playoffs as the Buffalo Braves) before a dominating home win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on April 16, 2012. It was their third win in four regular-season games against the Thunder. Chris Paul's push for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award was at its peak, and the 2011\u201312 season was the first time the Clippers were in the playoffs since 2005\u201306 season.\n\n\nIn their first playoff game, the Clippers rallied from a 27-point deficit against the Grizzlies to win 99\u201398 in one of the biggest rallies in playoff history. They led the series 3\u20131, then lost two straight, before coming back to win Game 7 in Memphis 82\u201372, becoming the sixth NBA road team to win Game 7 after leading series 3\u20131, and prevail to the second round. The Clippers relied on their bench during that game, and they came through, scoring all but two of their points in the fourth quarter. In the second round of the playoffs, the team was swept by the San Antonio Spurs.[63] The following off-season, GM Neil Olshey reached an agreement to become General Manager of the Portland Trail Blazers.[64] Olshey was replaced by Gary Sacks. On draft night, the team re-acquired Lamar Odom from the Dallas Mavericks as part of a four-team deal that also sent Mo Williams and Furkan Aldemir, their 2012 draftee, to the Utah Jazz and Houston Rockets, respectively. The team then sent Reggie Evans to the Brooklyn Nets for the right to swap second-round draft picks with the Nets in the 2016 NBA draft.[65] On the same day, the Clippers signed free agent Jamal Crawford, formerly of the Portland Trail Blazers, and re-signed Billups to a one-year deal. The franchise then rounded out its roster for the upcoming season with Grant Hill, Ryan Hollins, and Ronny Turiaf, while signing Matt Barnes to a one-year deal early in the season.\n\n\nOn November 29, 2012, public address announcer David Courtney died in hospital, and was replaced by former Clippers and current Los Angeles Dodgers PA announcer, Eric Smith. On December 15, with a 111\u201385 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, the Clippers recorded their record ninth consecutive win, breaking their previous franchise record (in Los Angeles) of eight wins set in the 1991\u201392 season.[66] On December 21, with a 97\u201385 win over the Sacramento Kings, they notched their twelfth consecutive victory, breaking their previous 11-game streak as the Buffalo Braves in the 1974\u201375 season.[67] On December 30, the Clippers recorded a team-record 17th straight win against the Utah Jazz, beating them 107\u201396. The win also made the Clippers the third team in NBA history to record an undefeated month ending the month of December 16\u20130. The streak ended when they lost to the Denver Nuggets on January 2, 2013.\n\n\n\n![](image)Doc Rivers became head coach during the 2013 off-season.\nOn January 9, 2013, with a 99\u201393 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, the Clippers recorded another franchise record with their 13th straight home victory.[68] On January 12, the Clippers 13 game home win streak came to an end with a 104\u2013101 loss to the Orlando Magic.[69] A 126\u2013101 victory over the Phoenix Suns saw the Clippers reach the 50-win mark for the first time in franchise history, breaking their previous mark of 49 from 1974\u201375, when they were in Buffalo.[70] On April 7, with a 109\u201395 victory over the Lakers, they swept the LA season series, and clinched their first division title in franchise history.[71] They would finish the season with a 56\u201326 record, and entered the playoffs as the fourth seed, to once again face the fifth seeded Memphis Grizzlies. The Clippers would go up 2\u20130 early in the series after a buzzer beater by Chris Paul in game 2. After being up 2\u20130 in the series, the Clippers would lose 4 games in a row to be eliminated the first round. This caused the team to not renew Vinny Del Negro's contract as head coach, and acquired Doc Rivers from the Boston Celtics.[72] The deal was announced to have included two future first-round draft picks, in addition to an anti-trade clause preventing the Clippers and Celtics from engaging in further transactions amongst each other, including the exchanging of players, for the duration of the 2013\u201314 season.[73][74][75]\n\n\nOn July 3, 2013, the Clippers traded Eric Bledsoe and Caron Butler to the Phoenix Suns for Jared Dudley and JJ Redick (from the Milwaukee Bucks). The Clippers and Suns also sent a second-round pick each to the Bucks. On July 7, the team re-signed Barnes, Paul, and Ryan Hollins. Paul's deal was for 5 years, worth around $105.3 million. The team also signed Darren Collison to fill the back-up point guard role, replacing Bledsoe and free agent Chauncey Billups, who signed with the Detroit Pistons. On August 28, the Clippers signed free agent power forward Antawn Jamison to a one-year deal worth the veteran minimum. Jamison only appeared in 22 games, and was eventually traded to the Atlanta Hawks on February 20, 2014, in exchange for the draft rights to Cenk Akyol. On December 19, 2013, the Clippers signed free agent small forward Stephen Jackson. Jackson also appeared sporadically, and was eventually waived on January 7, 2014. On January 16, the Clippers signed free agent small forward Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu, while also acquiring both Glen Davis and Danny Granger for the remainder of 2013\u201314 season. On March 6, the Clippers defeated their crosstown rivals by 48 points 142\u201394, the most lopsided victory ever for the Clippers' franchise, and the most one-sided loss in Lakers history. On April 15, the Clippers broke the franchise record of wins with 57. In the playoffs, they defeated the Warriors in seven games before falling again, this time to the Thunder, in six games in the second round.\n\n\n\n#### Donald Sterling controversy[edit]\n\n\nOn April 25, 2014, entertainment news website TMZ released a taped conversation in which team owner Donald Sterling\u2014who had a history of accusations of racist behavior against African Americans and Latinos dating back to the 1990s\u2014reprimanded V. Stiviano (of African American and Mexican heritage, who had reportedly been dating Sterling while he was estranged from wife) for posting an Instagram photo featuring her, former Los Angeles Lakers point guard Magic Johnson, and another woman. Sterling stated that it bothered him that she had \"broadcast that [she is] associating with black people\", and that he did not want Stiviano to bring them to the team's games.[76] The remarks in the tape caused public backlash (including condemnations from many players, with Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Charles Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal, LeBron James, and Kobe Bryant all voicing their disapproval); several sponsors also severed ties with the team, among them Kia Motors (for whom Griffin serves as its television spokesperson), State Farm Insurance, and Virgin America.[77] Threats of boycotts against the Clippers were also considered, with the team itself briefly contemplating one at the April 27 playoff game against the Golden State Warriors (the fourth game in the team's first round playoff series). They opted to conduct a silent protest instead, by wearing their shirts inside-out, obscuring team logos.[78][79]\n\n\nOn April 29, the NBA issued Sterling a lifetime ban from the organization after a league investigation into the recording confirmed that he was the one conversing with Stiviano. The league also issued a $2.5 million fine against Sterling (the highest allowable by the NBA) and barred him from attending games or practices involving any NBA team; being present in any Clippers office or facility; and from participating in any team business, player personnel decisions or league activity. NBA commissioner Adam Silver stated in a press conference regarding the decision that he will try to force Sterling to sell the Clippers, which would require the consent of three-quarters of the league's 29 other team owners.[80] Silver later announced that the NBA would appoint a CEO to run the team.[81] Before the ban was issued, Sterling told Fox News contributor Jim Gray that he had no plans to sell the team.[82] The NBA installed former Citigroup and Time Warner chairman Richard Parsons as the interim CEO of the team on May 9,[83] prior to allowing Steve Ballmer, a former CEO of Microsoft, to purchase the team for $2 billion.[84][85] To buy the team, Ballmer reportedly beat out other candidates, including Eric Piatkowski and his group, Oprah Winfrey, Floyd Mayweather, Magic Johnson, as well as a group of crowdfunders.[86][87] The team's sale price, which was four times the expected purchase-evaluated price, prompted speculation that Ballmer aimed to relocate the team to Seattle, his hometown. He had previously been a part of an ownership group that had unsuccessfully attempted to move the Sacramento Kings to that city, but later stated no intention to relocate the team.[88]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Clippers hosting the San Antonio Spurs in Game 5 of the 2015 NBA playoffs first-round series\nOn August 12, 2014, Ballmer officially took control of the team following an order by a California court that confirmed the sale from Shelly Sterling to Ballmer. As part of the deal, Shelly received the titles of \"Owner Emeritus\" and \"Clippers' Number 1 Fan\", as well as ten tickets in sections 101 or 111 for all Clippers games, two courtside tickets for all games in Los Angeles, six parking spots in Lot C for each game, 12 VIP passes that include access to the Lexus Club, Arena Club, or Chairman's Lounge and Media room or equivalent, for each Staples games, three championship rings following any Clippers title, and will run a charitable foundation.[8][89][90][91] The deal also included a stipulation that Steve Ballmer would keep the Clippers in Los Angeles.[92] On November 6, the team hired its first major female executive as former Auto Club Speedway president Gillian Zucker was hired as the Clippers' president of business operations.[93] Zucker became one of two women to serve in an executive capacity in any of the four major professional sports leagues; the other being Jeanie Buss, president and part-owner of the crosstown Lakers.\n\n\n\n#### 2014\u20132017: Final seasons of Lob City[edit]\n\n\nThe Clippers' first regular season under Ballmer's co-ownership ended with a 56\u201326 record and the third seed in the Western Conference going into the 2015 playoffs. They met the defending NBA champion San Antonio Spurs, winning the series in the seventh game on a game-winning shot by Paul with one second left.[94] In the next series against the second-seeded Houston Rockets, they took a 3\u20131 series lead that included 25 and 33-point wins in games three and four, respectively. However, Houston won the final three games to eliminate Los Angeles. In the off-season, the Clippers acquired Lance Stephenson,[95] Wesley Johnson,[96] and Paul Pierce[97] while re-signing Austin Rivers.[98] Griffin missed half of the season and the Clippers finished with the fourth playoff seed before being then eliminated in the first round of the 2016 playoffs by the fifth-seeded Portland Trail Blazers.\n\n\nThe Clippers finished the 2016\u201317 season with a 51\u201331 record, the team's fifth straight 50-win season, despite injuries to both Griffin and Paul during the regular season.[99] The Clippers won their last seven games and earned the fourth playoff seed by defeating the Sacramento Kings in the final game of the season.[100] The Clippers faced the Utah Jazz in the first round of the playoffs, but lost in seven games. Paul Pierce retired after the season.\n\n\n\n### 2017\u20132019: Rebuild[edit]\n\n\nIn preparation for a rebuild, the Clippers brought in two-time Executive Of The Year winner Jerry West to serve as their special consultant; West was the architect behind the dynasties of the 2000 to 2002 Los Angeles Lakers and mid to late 2010s Golden State Warriors, and had helped to establish the Memphis Grizzlies as a relevant playoff contender.[101] On June 28, 2017, Chris Paul was sent to the Houston Rockets in a sign-and-trade in exchange for Lou Williams, Patrick Beverley, Montrezl Harrell, Sam Dekker, Darrun Hilliard, DeAndre Liggins, Kyle Wiltjer, a future first-round pick, and cash considerations. The team retained Griffin and acquired Italian wing Danilo Gallinari in a three-team trade with the Denver Nuggets and Atlanta Hawks. Due to injuries to Griffin and Gallinari and no serious depth on the roster, the team was struggling by the 2018 trade deadline and traded Griffin to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, Boban Marjanovi\u0107, a protected first-round pick in 2018, and a second-round pick in 2019. With the added depth, they finished with a winning record of 42\u201340 but missed the playoffs for the first time since 2011.\n\n\nIn the 2018 NBA draft, the team were awarded the 12th and 13th overall picks, and selected Miles Bridges and Jerome Robinson, respectively. They then traded Bridges and two future second-round picks on draft night to Charlotte for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Austin Rivers was traded to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Marcin Gortat, while long-time Clipper DeAndre Jordan, who had been with the team since 2008, opted out of his contract and became a free agent.[102] Despite the departure of Griffin and Jordan for the 2018\u201319 season, the Clippers clinched a playoff berth and finished the regular season with a 48\u201334 record. The team faced the defending two-time NBA champion Golden State Warriors in the first round, losing in six games.\n\n\n\n### 2019\u2013present: Kawhi Leonard/Paul George Era[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2019 off-season, Kawhi Leonard opted out of his final year on his contract with the Toronto Raptors to become one of the top free agents. Leonard chose to sign with the Clippers when the team agreed to trade for the Oklahoma City Thunder's Paul George.[103] For George, the Clippers traded Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Danilo Gallinari, four unprotected first-round picks, a protected first-round pick, and two pick swaps.\n\n\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Clippers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season.[104] They finished the year with a 49\u201323 record as the Western Conferences second seed. Despite high expectations, the Clippers failed to win their first conference semifinals series when they were eliminated by the Denver Nuggets in seven games.[105] The defeat marked the second time that the Clippers lost the conference semifinals after taking a 3\u20131 series lead. A week later, Ballmer announced that Rivers stepped down as head coach in a mutual decision.[106] Rivers was succeeded by Tyronn Lue.\n\n\nDespite losing Leonard to injury during the 2021 playoffs, the Clippers defeated the top-seeded Utah Jazz in the semifinals, leading them to their first Western Conference finals appearance in franchise history.[107][108] The Clippers lost the conference finals in six games to the Phoenix Suns, preventing them from reaching their first NBA Finals.\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lakers\u2013Clippers rivalry\n\nThe rivalry between the Clippers and the Los Angeles Lakers is unique because they are the only two NBA teams to share an arena, the Crypto.com Arena. It is also one of only two intra-city rivalries in the NBA, the other being the crosstown rivalry between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets.\n\n\nLos Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers.[109][110] Some contend that the term *rivalry* is inaccurate due to the Lakers historical success and the Clippers historical lack thereof.[111]\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the Clippers.

The arena is also expected to house a practice facility and team headquarters for the Clippers, as the team's current practice facility in Los Angeles' Playa Vista neighborhood is still owned by the Sterling Family Trust, and is leased back to the team. The Inglewood city council unanimously voted for the agreement in which a subsidiary of the Clippers will purchase 22 acres covering four large city blocks in what is largely a lower-class/lower-middle-class residential neighborhood (Century to the north, 104th Street to the south, Doty to the east, and Prairie to the west) to build the new facility.\n\n\nThe planned arena was met with immediate opposition from the nearby Forum and its operator, the Madison Square Garden Company (parent company of the New York Knicks), as they accused both the Clippers and the Inglewood city government of \"backroom dealing\" and the fear that a new Clippers' arena would siphon events from the recently renovated sports arena-turned-concert venue. In March 2020, Steve Ballmer, owner of the Clippers, reached an agreement with the Madison Square Garden Company to buy The Forum, eliminating any opposition related to the construction of the Clippers' new arena.[114]\n\n\nOn July 25, 2019, the Clippers released images of the proposed arena with the construction planned to begin in 2021 and completed in fall 2024 following the expiration of the Clippers' lease with the Staples Center.[115] On September 17, 2021, the Clippers unveiled the first renditions of the new arena with an expected cost of up to $2 billion. The team also revealed the arena's name as the Intuit Dome through a 23-year naming rights deal with Intuit worth $500 million.[116][117]\n\n\n\n## Logos and uniforms[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Clippers' updated wordmark logo, unveiled on June 18, 2015.[118]\nWhen the Braves franchise moved to San Diego and renamed the Clippers, they retained the baby blue base on their uniforms, but replaced black with orange trim. A series of nautical flags which spelled \"Clippers\" adorned each side of the shorts. The team's original logo featured a large baby blue circle enclosing a small orange circle to represent Southern California's sunny climate and three white sails to represent a clipper.[119][120]\n\n\nIn a foreshadowing move, the Clippers redesigned their logo and uniforms for the 1983\u201384 season. This set, which the team carried over upon moving to Los Angeles the following season, replaced baby blue and orange with royal blue and red. The uniforms featured a royal blue base and red trim and were emblazoned with the team name in front; the \"C\" in the word \"Clippers\" was enlarged in the same manner as the logo.[121] The Clippers also wore red uniforms on a number of occasions in 1984. The logo was now a generic moving white basketball with red lines superimposed over the full team name, which the team used until 2015, albeit with some tweaks to the design.[119]\n\n\nIn 1987, the Clippers uniforms changed to a set that remained mostly intact until 2010. Red became the base color while blue was relegated to trim color. On the home white uniform, the team name was written in script lettering, while on the road red uniform, the city name in script was used. Later on, the road uniforms replaced the city name with the team name, and blue numerals were replaced with white numerals.[121] Before the 2000\u201301 season, the Clippers made slight changes to their uniform, adding the interlocking \"LAC\" logo on the neckline and gaining thicker contrasting stripes and bolder numerals. Later on, the Clippers unveiled a blue alternate uniform which spelled the city name in red with white trim.[122]\n\n\nIn 2010, the Clippers changed their uniforms, adjusting the stripes and letters. The white uniforms featured the team name in blue and the numerals in red, while the red uniforms were emblazoned with the city name in white and numerals in blue. Later on, the Clippers added a blue alternate uniform and a sleeved baby blue alternate uniform; both designs featured the city name in white and numerals in red.[122]\n\n\nOn June 18, 2015, the Los Angeles Clippers unveiled its new brand identity. The club's primary logo features a basketball in the shape of a compass, with the club's \"LAC\" monogram situated in the middle. Below that is the club's wordmark logo in black, with the two curved lines below the wordmark symbolizing the horizon of the ocean, which the club says it alludes to its nautical roots. The team also unveiled its new home and away uniforms, which kept the design template from the previous uniforms. The home white uniform features the club's wordmark logo in black across the front. The away red uniform features the club's \"LAC\" monogram across the right breast, with the player's jersey number across the left breast.[123][118]\n\n\nThe Clippers introduced an alternate black uniform intended to celebrate downtown Los Angeles on November 6, 2015. The uniform keeps the design template from the previous uniform, and features the club's primary logo without the wordmark.[124]\n\n\nThe Clippers unveiled their new Nike Association (white) and Icon (team color) uniform designs on August 11, 2017.[3] The home and road designations were dropped, and the team replaced its seldom-used road red uniform with a new blue \"Icon\" uniform that resembles the white \"Association\" uniform, which dropped the black accents. The black alternate (a.k.a. Statement uniform) was also retained. All three sets featured updated numeral and letter fonts.\n\n\nA fourth uniform option, the City uniform, was later unveiled. For the 2017\u201318 season, the Clippers brought back the classic San Diego baby blue and orange scheme for their first City uniform, including the nautical flags which spell the acronym \"LAC\".[125] The next season, the Clippers wore navy blue City uniforms to commemorate the team's 35th season in Los Angeles, as well as to pay tribute to the 1984 Summer Olympics.[126] In the 2019\u201320 season, the Clippers donned white City uniforms with black letters and \"Los Angeles\" in Old English font as a tribute to Los Angeles' street culture.[127] The Clippers kept most of the same design for the 2020\u201321 \"City\" uniform, this time with a black base.[128] The 2021\u201322 \"City\" uniform saw the Clippers incorporate various uniform styles from the past, including the baby blue and orange of the Buffalo/San Diego era, the \"Clippers\" script from 1987 to 2015, and the three sails motif from the 2017\u201318 \"City\" uniform.[129]\n\n\nIn the 2022\u201323 season, the Clippers wore black \"City\" uniforms as homage to the Drew League, a summer tournament in Los Angeles that celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2023. The white \"Los Angeles\" script was surrounded by a mosaic inspired by the Watts Towers.[130]\n\n\nThe 2023\u201324 \"City\" uniform featured the shortened nickname \"Clips\" in a font based on the team's 1978\u20131983 logo. The mostly navy uniform was designed by local artist Jonas Wood, who drew inspiration from the city's love for basketball.[131]\n\n\nAfter reaching the 2020 NBA playoffs, the Clippers were rewarded with an \"Earned\" uniform for the 2020\u201321 season. The uniform essentially recreated the team's \"Icon\" uniform, but had a grey base with thick white stripes, and red and blue were relegated to the arm piping.[132]\n\n\nIn the 2022\u201323 season, the Clippers updated their black \"Statement\" uniforms, replacing the \"LAC\" logo with the \"Los Angeles\" script first used in their 2019\u201320 and 2020\u201321 \"City\" uniforms. The three sails motif from the 2017\u201318 and 2021\u201322 \"City\" uniforms was also added.[133]\n\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\n### All-time roster[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Los Angeles Clippers all-time roster\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Los Angeles Clippers roster*** v\n* t\n* e\n\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| G | 4 | Boston, Brandon Jr. | 6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (1.98\u00a0m)\n | 188\u00a0lb (85\u00a0kg)\n | 2001-11-28\n | Kentucky |\n| F | 21 | Brown, Kobe | 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m)\n | 250\u00a0lb (113\u00a0kg)\n | 2000-01-01\n | Missouri |\n| G/F | 7 | Coffey, Amir | 6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in (2.01\u00a0m)\n | 210\u00a0lb (95\u00a0kg)\n | 1997-06-17\n | Minnesota |\n| C | 25 | Diabat\u00e9, Moussa\u00a0(TW)\n | 6\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (2.08\u00a0m)\n | 210\u00a0lb (95\u00a0kg)\n | 2002-01-21\n | Michigan |\n| F | 13 | George, Paul | 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m)\n | 220\u00a0lb (100\u00a0kg)\n | 1990-05-02\n | Fresno State |\n| G | 1 | Harden, James | 6\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in (1.96\u00a0m)\n | 220\u00a0lb (100\u00a0kg)\n | 1989-08-26\n | Arizona State |\n| G | 5 | Hyland, Bones | 6\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in (1.88\u00a0m)\n | 173\u00a0lb (78\u00a0kg)\n | 2000-09-14\n | VCU |\n| F/C | 23 | Jones, Kai | 6\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in (2.11\u00a0m)\n | 221\u00a0lb (100\u00a0kg)\n | 2001-01-19\n | Texas |\n| F | 2 | Leonard, Kawhi | 6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in (2.01\u00a0m)\n | 225\u00a0lb (102\u00a0kg)\n | 1991-06-29\n | San Diego State |\n| G/F | 14 | Mann, Terance | 6\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in (1.96\u00a0m)\n | 215\u00a0lb (98\u00a0kg)\n | 1996-10-18\n | Florida State |\n| F | 11 | Miller, Jordan\u00a0(TW)\n | 6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in (2.01\u00a0m)\n | 195\u00a0lb (88\u00a0kg)\n | 2000-01-23\n | Miami (FL) |\n| G | 22 | Moon, Xavier\u00a0(TW)\n | 6\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in (1.88\u00a0m)\n | 165\u00a0lb (75\u00a0kg)\n | 1995-01-02\n | Morehead State |\n| F/C | 44 | Plumlee, Mason | 6\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (2.08\u00a0m)\n | 254\u00a0lb (115\u00a0kg)\n | 1990-03-05\n | Duke |\n| G | 24 | Powell, Norman | 6\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (1.93\u00a0m)\n | 215\u00a0lb (98\u00a0kg)\n | 1993-05-25\n | UCLA |\n| F/C | 10 | Theis, Daniel | 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m)\n | 245\u00a0lb (111\u00a0kg)\n | 1992-04-04\n | Germany |\n| F | 17 | Tucker, P.

The Mavericks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Southwest Division of the Western Conference. The team plays its home games at the American Airlines Center, which it shares with the National Hockey League's Dallas Stars. \n\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the Mavericks were a perennial playoff team, led by All-Stars Rolando Blackman and Mark Aguirre. The team struggled during the 1990s, entering into a period of rebuilding. In 1998, the franchise's fortunes would change drastically with the acquisition of Dirk Nowitzki, who would become the cornerstone of the most successful period in franchise history, leading the team to its first and only NBA championship in 2011. The Mavericks later entered a rebuilding phase in the tail end of Nowitzki's storied career. They missed the playoffs in three consecutive years from 2017 to 2019, after which Nowitzki retired following his record-breaking 21st season with Dallas. Led by Luka Don\u010di\u0107, who was named the 2019 Rookie of the Year , the Mavericks returned to the playoffs in 2020 and reached the Western Conference Finals in 2022 for the first time since their 2011 championship.\n\n\nIn February 2020, the Mavericks sold out their NBA-record 815th consecutive game, dating back to December 15, 2001. The sellout streak, which includes 67 playoff games, is the longest currently running in North American major league sports.[6]\n\n\nCurrently, the Dallas Mavericks are owned by investor Mark Cuban. Since the Mavericks' inaugural 1980\u201381 season, the Mavericks have won four division titles (1987, 2007, 2010, 2021), two conference championships (2006, 2011), and one NBA championship (2011).\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Dallas Mavericks\n\nSee also: List of Dallas Mavericks seasons\n\n### 1978\u20131981: The creation and early years of the Mavericks[edit]\n\n\nIn 1978, Californian businessman Garn Eckardt met Dallas lawyer Doug Adkins and mentioned he was trying to raise capital to move an NBA team to Dallas. Asking for a possible partner, Adkins recommended him one of his clients, Home Interiors and Gifts owner Don Carter. Negotiations with Eckardt fell through, but Carter remained interested in the enterprise as a gift to his wife Linda, who played basketball while at Duncanville High School. Simultaneously, Buffalo Braves president and general manager Norm Sonju developed an interest in bringing the NBA to Dallas as he studied possible new locations for the ailing franchise. While the Braves went to California as the San Diego Clippers, Sonju eventually returned to Texas. He was introduced to Carter by Mayor Robert Folsom, one of the owners and team president of the last professional basketball team in the city, the Dallas Chaparrals of the American Basketball Association, which moved to San Antonio in 1973 becoming the San Antonio Spurs. Sonju and Carter tried purchasing both the Milwaukee Bucks and the Kansas City Kings, but disagreement on relocation stalled the negotiations, leading them to instead aim for an expansion team.\n\n\nThe league was initially reluctant to expand to Dallas, given Texas had both the Spurs and Houston Rockets. The 1978\u201379 season was proving unprofitable (18 out of the 22 teams lost money) and unpopular (television ratings fell 26 percent). Still, during the 1979 NBA All-Star Game weekend, NBA commissioner Larry O'Brien announced the league would add two new teams in the 1980\u201381 season, with teams in Dallas and Minneapolis. Once the potential Minnesota owners backed out, only Dallas remained. (The Minnesota Timberwolves would not join until 1989.) Through negotiations with general counselor and future commissioner David Stern, the expansion fee was settled on $12.5\u00a0million. Carter would provide half the amount.[7][8]\n\n\nAt the 1980 NBA All-Star Game, league owners voted to admit the new team, with the team's name coming from the 1957\u20131962 TV western *Maverick*; the fans chose the title with 4,600 postcards received, beating *Wranglers* and *Express*.[9][10] James Garner, who played the title character, was a member of the ownership group.[11] The University of Texas at Arlington, who also uses the Mavericks nickname, had objections about a shared name but did not attempt any legal action.[12] They joined the Midwest Division of the Western Conference, where they would stay until the league went to six divisions for the 2004\u201305 season. Dick Motta, who had guided the Washington Bullets to the NBA Championship in 1977\u201378, was hired as the team's first head coach.\n\n\nThe Mavs drafted Kiki VanDeWeghe of UCLA with the 11th pick of the 1980 NBA draft. Still, VanDeWeghe refused to play for the expansion Mavericks and staged a holdout that lasted a month into its inaugural season. VanDeWeghe was traded to the Denver Nuggets, along with a first-round pick, in 1981, in exchange for two future first-round picks that eventually materialized into Rolando Blackman in 1981, and Sam Vincent in 1985.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mavs' founder Don Carter\nIn the Mavericks debut game, taking place in the brand-new Reunion Arena, the Mavericks defeated the Spurs, 103\u201392. But the Mavs started the season with a 6\u201340 record on their way to finishing 15\u201367. However, the Mavericks did make a player acquisition that, while it seemed minor at the time, turned out to play a significant role in the early years of their franchise. Journeyman 6\u00a0ft 3 in guard Brad Davis, who played for the Anchorage Northern Knights of the Continental Basketball Association, was tracked down and signed by the Mavericks in December after a scout watched a game with Davis. He had to be convinced to play for the team rather than attend to his studies at the University of Maryland (which he was funding by playing for Anchorage).[13] He would play for the remainder of the season after joining in December. Davis would spend the next twelve years with the Mavericks, and eventually, his number 15 jersey was retired. The Mavericks also marked the first NBA team to have a good debut season, with 7,789 spectators per game.[14]\n\n\nThe 1981 NBA Draft brought three players who would become vital parts of the team. The Mavs selected forward Mark Aguirre with the first pick, guard Rolando Blackman ninth, and forward Jay Vincent at 24th. By the end of his seven-year Mavericks career, Aguirre would average 24.6 points per game. Blackman contributed 19.2 points over his 11-year career in Dallas. But it was Jay Vincent who made the most significant difference for the Mavs in their second season, leading the team in scoring with 21.4 points per game and earning NBA All-Rookie Team honors. The Mavericks improved to 28\u201354, getting out of the Midwest Division cellar as they finished above the Utah Jazz.\n\n\n\n### 1982\u20131990: Playoff contention[edit]\n\n\nIn 1982\u201383, the Mavericks were serious contenders for the first time. At the All-Star break, they were 25\u201324 and had won 12 of their last 15 games. They could not sustain that momentum and finished seven games behind the Denver Nuggets for the sixth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. But the Mavs' 38\u201344 record was a 10-game improvement from the previous season.\n\n\nMark Aguirre led the 1982\u201383 Mavericks with 24.4 points per game, finishing sixth in the NBA. Jay Vincent and Rolando Blackman contributed 18.7 and 17.7 points per game, respectively. Brad Davis was 10th in the NBA in assists with 7.2 per game and shot .845 from the free-throw line, sixth in the league. The Mavs drafted Derek Harper with the 11th pick of the 1983 NBA draft. The 6\u00a0ft 4 in guard would spend the next decade with the organization, averaging 15 points and 6.1 assists. The Mavericks' in 1983\u201384 posted a winning record for the first time in franchise history, finishing 43\u201339 and second in the Midwest Division. The Mavs also earned the first playoff berth in franchise history. Mark Aguirre was named the team's first NBA All-Star, as he finished with an average of 29.5 points per game\u2014second in the league to Utah's Adrian Dantley.\n\n\nDallas finished with the fourth seed in the Western Conference playoffs, and in their first playoff trip, they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in five games. The fifth and deciding game of that series was played at Moody Coliseum, as Reunion Arena, then the home court for the Mavericks was hosting a tennis tournament. The Magic Johnson-led Los Angeles Lakers, were next for the Mavs, and the young club fell short, losing four games to one. But a trade the Mavericks made in their inaugural season of 1980 paid off for them in 1984 because they owned Cleveland's first-round pick, which ended up being the fourth pick overall. The Mavs used it to select forward-center Sam Perkins, a former North Carolina Tar Heel, with a surprising range from the three-point line who would average 14.4 points and 8.0 rebounds in six seasons with Dallas.\n\n\nAbout this time, the Dallas Cowboys, once one of the NFL's elite teams, began a slow decline that eventually saw them fall to 1\u201315 in 1989. The Mavs were hitting their stride simultaneously and replaced the Cowboys as the Metroplex's most popular team. The 1984\u201385 team finished a game better than the previous year at 44\u201338. Mark Aguirre led the team in scoring again with 25.7 ppg, Sam Perkins made the All-Rookie team, and Rolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the 1985 NBA All-Star Game. The Mavs returned to the playoffs in 1985 but were not as successful as they had been. They won Game 1 in double-overtime against the Portland Trail Blazers in their first-round playoff series, but lost the next three games in a row, ending their season.\n\n\nDallas had the eighth pick in the 1985 NBA draft\u2014again due to a trade with the Cavaliers\u2014and drafted German-born forward Detlef Schrempf out of Washington. He would show flashes of brilliance in his three-plus seasons with the team, but it was not until he was traded to the Indiana Pacers that he displayed his full potential. The Mavericks also traded center Kurt Nimphius to the Los Angeles Clippers for center James Donaldson, who would play for the Mavericks until halfway through the 1991\u201392 season. This trade allowed the Mavericks to have a steady hand at the center position lacking throughout the franchise's first five years. In 1988, James Donaldson became the first Dallas Mavericks center in club history to be selected to play in the NBA All-Star Game.\n\n\nRolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the 1986 NBA All-Star Game, hosted by Dallas at Reunion Arena. The 1985\u201386 Mavericks were second in scoring at 115.3 points per game, gaining their third-straight playoff appearance. They defeated Utah three games to one in the first round. In the conference semi-finals, they ran into the Lakers again, and L.A. defeated Dallas in six games. But four of those games were decided by four points or fewer, and Dallas won half of those, leaving Mavericks fans room to hope that they could finally top the Lakers in the following season. The Mavs drafted Michigan center Roy Tarpley with the seventh overall pick, who would become a very talented\u2014but troubled\u2014member of the roster.\n\n\nThe 1986\u201387 Mavericks team had their most successful regular season to date, going 55\u201327 and winning their first Midwest Division title. But despite the great expectations surrounding the team, they self-destructed in the playoffs. After hammering the Seattle SuperSonics by 22 points in Game 1, the bottom dropped out for the Mavs, as they lost Games 2 and 3 in close fashion before succumbing to Game 4 in Seattle. Following the unexpected early playoff exit, Motta, who had been with the team since its inception, shockingly resigned as head coach. John MacLeod, who had led the Phoenix Suns to nine playoff berths in 11 seasons, including an NBA Finals run in 1976, was hired as his replacement.\n\n\nThe 1987\u201388 NBA season saw the Mavericks dip just a little bit in the regular season\u2014finishing 53\u201329 and losing their Midwest Division title to the Denver Nuggets\u2014but it was another successful year for the team. Mark Aguirre and James Donaldson both played in the 1988 NBA All-Star Game, the Mavericks rattled off a franchise-best 11-game winning streak, and Rolando Blackman scored his 10,000th career point. Aguirre led the team in scoring for the sixth consecutive year with 25.1 points per game, and Roy Tarpley won the NBA Sixth Man Award with averages of 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. The season saw the Mavs' deepest playoff run to date. They dispatched the Houston Rockets in four games and the Nuggets in six, leaving only the defending NBA Champion Lakers between them and their first-ever trip to the NBA Finals. The Mavericks gave the Lakers everything they could handle. Still, in the end, the more experienced Lakers prevailed, defeating Dallas in seven games on the way to eventually winning their second consecutive NBA Championship.\n\n\nDespite all the changes, the Mavs remained in contention. However, their season effectively ended when James Donaldson went down with a ruptured patella tendon on March 10, 1989, and missed the rest of the season. The Mavericks were left understaffed, demoralized, and disheartened as they finished with a 38\u201344 record. It was their first losing season since 1982\u201383\u2014which was also the last time they missed the playoffs.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mark Aguirre was traded to the Detroit Pistons in 1989.\nThe Mavericks returned to the playoffs in 1989\u201390 with a 47\u201335 record, but it was another season of off-court chaos. On November 15, only six games into the Mavs' season, Tarpley was arrested for driving while intoxicated and resisting arrest. The team started 5\u20136, and MacLeod was fired, replaced by assistant coach Richie Adubato. The Mavs finished the season with four straight victories to surge into the playoffs but went down rather meekly to the Portland Trail Blazers in three games. It would be the team's last winning season and playoff appearance until 2001.\n\n\n\n### 1990\u20131998: Rebuilding[edit]\n\n\n#### 1990\u20131994: Free falling[edit]\n\n\nThe team endured numerous changes in 1990, losing Sam Perkins to the Lakers via free agency and suffering injuries to practically their entire 1990\u201391 starting lineup. The players they managed to acquire\u2014Rodney McCray, Fat Lever, and Alex English\u2014were all in the twilight of their careers. On November 9, it was announced that Fat Lever would have season-ending surgery on his right knee, and that very night, Tarpley suffered a knee injury of his own, which ended his season. The Mavericks' season only got worse from there, and they finished with a record of 28\u201354, falling behind even the second-year Minnesota Timberwolves and Orlando Magic. In March 1991, Tarpley was charged with suspicion of driving while intoxicated and was suspended again by the NBA.\n\n\nIt got even worse in 1991\u201392. Before the season even began, Tarpley violated the league's substance abuse policy for the third time and was banned from the NBA for life. The former Sixth Man Award winner's fall from grace was complete. The few talented players the Mavericks had remaining to them were lost to injury. Brad Davis' back problems forced him to retire in mid-January, and Fat Lever had knee surgery again on January 29, missing the remainder of the season\u2014hardly worth the cost of losing two first-round draft picks. The team finished with a 22\u201360 record.\n\n\nIn 1992\u201393, the rebuilding began in earnest, with the Mavs trading Rolando Blackman\u2014who by that point had surpassed Mark Aguirre as the team's all-time leading scorer\u2014to the New York Knicks for a first-round draft pick. Blackman had made four All-Star Game appearances in his Mavericks career. Herb Williams joined the Knicks as a free agent. Fat Lever underwent more surgery and missed the entire 1992\u201393 season. Derek Harper was the team's only bright spot, leading the team with 18.3 points per game.\n\n\nThe Mavericks selected Ohio State guard Jim Jackson with the fourth overall pick of the 1992 NBA draft, but he and owner Donald Carter could not come to terms on a contract for half of his rookie season. Jackson only played 28 games in 1992\u201393, a season also ruined by trades, a coaching change, and injuries. The Mavericks started 2\u201327 and fired Adubato on January 13, replacing him with Gar Heard. The Mavericks came dangerously close to setting the all-time worst record in NBA history (at the time, 9\u201373 by the 1972\u201373 Philadelphia 76ers). But when Jackson was signed on March 3, the Mavs rallied, closing the season with a 7\u201314 mark, including two straight wins to end the season and finishing 11\u201371, the second-worst record in NBA history.\n\n\nDallas selected Kentucky forward Jamal Mashburn with the fourth overall pick of the 1993 NBA draft and hired Quinn Buckner as head coach. Buckner decided from the start to be a disciplinarian on the model of his college coach, Bobby Knight, who told Buckner that the only way he would succeed with the Mavs would be to run the team with an iron hand.[15] The mostly young roster did not respond very well to Buckner's stern coaching style and started 1\u201323. By the end of January, they were 3\u201340, and it was once again possible that they could tie the 1973 Sixers for the all-time worst record in the league. But 5\u20139 records in February and April, coupled with Buckner loosening the reins a little bit, helped the Mavs finish 13\u201369. It was still the worst record in the league by far, but the Mavericks again avoided setting an all-time futility record. However, they did tie the NBA's *single-season* record for consecutive losses at 20 games (since broken).\n\n\nBuckner was fired at the end of the season despite having a five-year contract. However, Carter decided that Buckner had \"burned too many bridges\" due to his autocratic coaching style.[15] He compiled the worst record for a rookie NBA head coach, a record that only lasted four years until Bill Hanzlik broke it with the Denver Nuggets. The Mavericks brought back Dick Motta, who had led the franchise to some of its most successful seasons. The Mavericks also wound up with the number two pick in the 1994 NBA draft and picked up Cal point guard Jason Kidd, giving them a solid tandem of Jackson, Mashburn, and Kidd, known as \"The Three Js.\"\n\n\n\n#### 1994\u20131996: Arrival of Jason Kidd[edit]\n\n\nThe addition of Jason Kidd infused the Mavericks with new life in 1994\u201395. Kidd averaged 11.7 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 7.7 assists in his rookie season and led the league in triple-doubles. Roy Tarpley was allowed to return to the league after three years and helped with 12.6 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. The tandem of Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn combined as the league's highest-scoring pair of teammates. On separate occasions, Mashburn and Jackson scored 50 points in a game that season. Mashburn contributed 24.1 points per game, fifth in the NBA; Jackson averaged 25.7 points but suffered a severe ankle sprain in February, which caused him to miss the regular season's remainder. Second-year forward Popeye Jones had a great year as well, as he averaged 10.6 rebounds and led the NBA in offensive rebounds.\n\n\nThe Mavericks' improvement was dramatic. The team jumped to 36\u201346, 10th in the Western Conference, and only five games behind the Denver Nuggets for the eighth and final playoff spot. It was the most significant one-year improvement in the team's history and the highest in the NBA. Many[*who?*] expected the Mavericks' improvement to continue with the franchise's first foray into the NBA playoffs since 1990. But despite a 4\u20130 start, the 1995\u201396 season was a disappointment about every conceivable way.[*according to whom?*] For the second time in his career, Roy Tarpley was given a lifelong ban from the NBA for repeated violations of the anti-drug policy\u2014he never played in the NBA again. Jamal Mashburn had season-ending surgery to repair his sore right knee, only 18 games into the Mavericks' schedule.\n\n\nThe team's two remaining stars, Jason Kidd and Jim Jackson bickered throughout the season, though neither of them had trouble establishing his stardom. Jackson led the team scoring with 19.6 ppg, made 121 three-pointers, and was the only Mav to start 82 games. Kidd became the first Maverick to be elected a starter in the NBA All-Star Game and finished second in the league in assists and fourth in steals while averaging 16.6 ppg. George McCloud, who averaged 9.6 ppg in his previous year, blew away his career-high scoring average as the Mavs resorted to the outside shot time and again due to their lack of an inside scoring threat. McCloud averaged 18.9 ppg and made 257 three-pointers, equaling the second-highest individual season total in league history.\n\n\nOverall, the Mavericks connected on 735 of their 2,039 three-point attempts, both new league records. The Mavs finished 26\u201356, fifth in the Midwest Division, and 33 games out of first place. Motta was relieved of his head coaching responsibilities at season's end and replaced by former Bulls assistant coach Jim Cleamons. And Don Carter, the only owner the Mavericks had ever had, sold the team to a group of investors led by H. Ross Perot, Jr.\n\n\n\n#### 1996\u20131998: Arrival of Michael Finley[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shawn Bradley spent nine seasons with Dallas and ranks second all time in blocked shots. The 1996\u201397 season was a year of transition for the Mavericks as they re-designed their entire team; 27 different players saw action for that Dallas team, setting an all-time NBA record. By the time the season was over only rookie forward, Samaki Walker, had remained from the opening-day roster. The first big move came in December, as Jason Kidd, Loren Meyer, and Tony Dumas were traded to the Phoenix Suns for guards Michael Finley and Sam Cassell and forward A. C. Green. Cassell would play just one season while Green played three, but Finley, who, after his first half-season in Dallas, went on to average over or near twenty points per game for at least the next seven years of his Mavericks career. He made two visits to the NBA All-Star Game and played in each of the Mavericks games until the 2004\u201305 season.[16]\n\n\nDon Nelson was hired as Dallas' general manager on February 7. Within a week of his hiring, the Mavericks had released Fred Roberts and Oliver Miller. They then traded Jamal Mashburn to the Miami Heat for forwards Kurt Thomas and Martin M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp and guard Sasha Danilovi\u0107. Thomas did not play in 1996\u201397 and only ended up playing in five games as a Maverick before signing as a free agent with the New York Knicks. Danilovi\u0107 played in 13 games for the Mavericks before opting out of his contract and signing with Bucker Bologna. M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp played in 73 games for the Mavericks over the next two years before leaving the NBA.\n\n\nChris Gatling was the Mavericks' sole representative in the NBA All-Star Game, but he did not last much longer in Dallas. In one of the most massive two-team trades in NBA history, the Mavericks traded Gatling, Jim Jackson, Sam Cassell, George McCloud, and Eric Montross to the New Jersey Nets for 7\u00a0ft 6 in center Shawn Bradley, forward Ed O'Bannon, and guards Khalid Reeves and Robert Pack. Nelson claimed the trades were necessary because the situation in the locker room was unacceptable. However, whereas Cassell became a consistent floor leader, and Jackson, Gatling and, McCloud all continued to be substantial contributors to their teams for several more years, only Bradley lasted any time in Dallas. He would spend part of the next eight years putting up modest contributions for Dallas and giving them substantial numbers in blocked shots.\n\n\nUndrafted rookie guard Erick Strickland averaged 10.6 ppg. Along with Finley and Bradley, he was expected to be the core of this new Mavericks team. The constant changes made it impossible to establish any team chemistry in 1996\u201397, and the Mavericks finished 24\u201358. But they had acquired some of the pieces that would help them start to turn things around in years to come. In 1997\u201398, despite a poor record of 20\u201362, Dallas had a knack for giving some of the NBA's elite teams a hard time to beat the Seattle SuperSonics, New York Knicks, Indiana Pacers, and Chicago Bulls. Against the Bulls, Dallas went on a 17\u20132 run to force overtime, where they won 104\u201397. Midway through that season, Nelson fired Cleamons and named himself head coach.\n\n\n\n### 1998\u20132019: The Dirk Nowitzki era[edit]\n\n\n#### 1998\u20132001: New beginnings with Nowitzki & Nash[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dirk Nowitzki was acquired by the Mavericks from the Milwaukee Bucks in 1998 and would become the face of the franchise in later years.\nIn the lockout-shortened 1998\u201399 season, the Mavericks finished with a lowly 19\u201331 record, but Michael Finley and Gary Trent put up substantial numbers and led their team to their first winning home record (15\u201310) since 1989\u201390. Notable were the acquisitions of power forward Dirk Nowitzki and point guard Steve Nash, two seemingly unspectacular moves that would significantly impact the future. In the following season, the team finally \"clicked\" and started to win consistently. Led by Finley, the Mavericks earned their first 40-win season since 1989\u201390. He was much helped by Nowitzki, who finally \"arrived\" in the NBA and established himself as a potent offensive threat.\n\n\nOn January 14, 2000, Ross Perot's group sold the Dallas Mavericks to Internet entrepreneur and season ticket-holder Mark Cuban for $285\u00a0million. Cuban immediately set out to revitalize the Mavericks and increase the team's popularity in Dallas and nationwide. His controversial moves (he allowed Dennis Rodman to live in his house for a week before temporarily signing him) and outspoken personality quickly made him a fan favorite in Dallas. They garnered the team much press in the national media. He has also been fined millions of dollars for violating NBA rules.[17]\n\n\nIn 2000\u201301, the Mavericks improved further and finished with a 53\u201329 record fueled by Nowitzki, Finley, and Nash's offensive triangle. The Mavs made a trade minutes before the trade deadline that sent Hubert Davis, Christian Laettner, Courtney Alexander, Loy Vaught, and Etan Thomas to the Washington Wizards for Juwan Howard, Calvin Booth, and Obinna Ekezie. This move brought in fresh blood that secured the club's first playoff visit in 11 years. Also, Wang Zhizhi became the first Chinese player to play in the NBA, signing with the Mavs in January, along with Eduardo N\u00e1jera, bringing Dallas an international cast that included Canada's Nash and Germany's Nowitzki. Nowitzki was named to the All NBA Third Team, becoming the first Maverick receive an All NBA honor. In the playoffs, the Mavericks won in the first round against the Utah Jazz. They advanced to the second round for the first time since 1988. Even though the San Antonio Spurs eliminated them in five games, it marked a sense of optimism for Dallas in earnestly contending for an NBA title. This season was also the last in the old Reunion Arena before moving to the modern American Airlines Center.\n\n\n\n#### 2001\u20132005: Run-and-gun Nellie ball[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mavericks began playing at the American Airlines Center in 2001.\nThe 2001\u201302 season was an excellent season for the Mavericks, with a 57\u201325 record and many sellout crowds. This season also saw a change in logo and colors, changing from the cowboy hat logo and green to a new horse logo and blue, almost on the same colors of fellow Dallas-based team, the Cowboys. Also, the team gained sleeker uniforms. Another blockbuster trade sent Juwan Howard, Tim Hardaway, and Donnell Harvey to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for Raef LaFrentz, Nick Van Exel, Tariq Abdul-Wahad, and Avery Johnson. The Mavericks also made several attempts to sign the Utah Jazz's star Karl Malone. The Mavericks swept the Kevin Garnett-led Minnesota Timberwolves in the 2002 playoffs but lost again in the second round to the Chris Webber-led Sacramento Kings.\n\n\nBut it was only in the next season that the Mavericks finally broke through. The team started the 2002\u201303 season with a 14\u20130 record, which was one win shy of tying the NBA record set by the 1993\u201394 Houston Rockets (15\u20130). The Mavericks finished with a 60\u201322 record in the regular season, impressing fans and critics with their sparkling offense. Since acquiring the \"Big Three\" of Nowitzki, Finley, and Nash, the Mavericks were a Western Conference power in waiting.[18] Finally, they led the team to the Conference Finals against the San Antonio Spurs. However, with the series tied 1\u20131, Dirk Nowitzki, the team's leading scorer, suffered a knee injury in game three that kept him out. This injury further worsened the Mavs' front-court depth problems (both of their backup centers were injured for the entire series), and the Spurs took the series in 6 games.\n\n\nIn 2003\u201304, two blockbuster trades were announced. The Mavericks acquired Antawn Jamison, Danny Fortson, Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch, and Chris Mills from Golden State in exchange for Nick Van Exel, Evan Eschmeyer, Popeye Jones, Avery Johnson, and Antoine Rigaudeau. Another high-profile trade sent Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills, and Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch to Boston for Antoine Walker and Tony Delk. Although the team struggled with chemistry, the Mavericks comfortably qualified for the playoffs. With the trio Nowitzki-Finley-Nash and NBA Sixth Man of the Year Jamison, the Mavericks continued their reputation as the NBA's best offensive team. Notable were two rookies, Josh Howard and Marquis Daniels, who made an immediate impact. However, the Mavericks were eliminated quickly in the 2004 playoffs, losing in the first round to the Chris Webber-led Sacramento Kings, a better defensive team. The Mavericks management had to re-evaluate their strategy.\n\n\nThe 2004\u201305 season saw trades which (among others) brought in robust center Erick Dampier, combo guard Jason Terry, speedy rookie point guard Devin Harris, scoring machine Jerry Stackhouse, and defensive stalwart Alan Henderson. Although the loss of All-Star Steve Nash via free agency visibly hurt the Mavericks' offense, the new acquisitions strengthened the team defense. The run-and-gun style of former times changed into a more balanced style of play. At the All-Star break, the Mavericks acquired Keith Van Horn for Calvin Booth and Henderson, the latter resigning only days later. Nowitzki added his third consecutive Euroscar during this season as well. On March 19, longtime coach Don Nelson stepped down, and his assistant Avery Johnson succeeded him. Under Johnson's tutelage, the Mavericks' defense became more vigorous, and they quickly qualified for the 2005 playoffs with an impressive 58\u201324 record. The Mavericks defeated the Houston Rockets in Round 1 of the playoffs in 7 games but then lost to the Phoenix Suns 4\u20132, led by former Maverick star Steve Nash.\n\n\n\n#### 2005\u20132006: First finals appearance[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2005\u201306 Dallas Mavericks season\n\nBefore the 2005 NBA draft, the Mavericks had traded all their picks away and were left empty-handed. On August 15, 2005, veteran guard Michael Finley was waived under the new \"Allan Houston Rule.\"[19] Under that rule, the Orlando Magic waived Doug Christie, who then signed with the Mavericks. On August 19, the Mavericks held a press conference announcing they had re-signed Darrell Armstrong and introduced Christie, DeSagana Diop, Rawle Marshall, and Josh Powell as new Mavericks. Christie's playing time was minimal amid a surgically repaired ankle still hampering his play. He was waived on November 25, 2005. At the end of calendar 2005, Nowitzki achieved a rare double by winning both the Euroscar and Mr. Europa, a second prestigious award for the top European player. He additionally was named the inaugural FIBA Europe Player of the Year.\n\n\nUp until the very end of the season, the Mavericks were toe-to-toe with the San Antonio Spurs for the crown of the Southwest Division and the #1 spot in the Western Conference. However, they fell short of the title and had to settle for a fourth seed. Nonetheless, they once again achieved a 60\u201322 record, with Avery Johnson winning NBA Coach of the Year honors. They swept the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2006 playoffs, leading to a titanic series against their state rivals and the reigning NBA champions the San Antonio Spurs. Five out of the seven games were decided in the last minute, including a Game 7 that had to go into overtime, with the Mavs prevailing under the guidance of Dirk Nowitzki and an incredibly deep bench. The Mavericks were able to advance to the conference finals against former teammate Steve Nash and the Phoenix Suns. The Mavs' defense and depth enabled them to take the series as they defeated the Phoenix Suns in game 6 of the Western Conference Finals on June 3, 2006, in the US Airways Center in Phoenix, and the Mavs advanced to their first NBA Finals in franchise history.\n\n\n\nMain article: 2006 NBA Finals\n\nIn the NBA Finals, the Mavericks faced the Miami Heat, held the home-court advantage, and scored two convincing wins. After game 2, Dallas city officials had already planned the victory parade. However, in Game 3, the Mavs blew a late double-digit lead, courtesy of Heat guard Dwyane Wade. He carried the Heat to the win, with Nowitzki missing a potentially game-tying free throw in the last seconds. After getting blown out in Game 4, the Mavericks suffered another loss in Game 5 when Wade scored the game-tying basket in the final possession of regular time, putting the Heat ahead with last-second free throws in overtime. The tragic figure was Josh Howard, who missed a pair of clutch free throws in overtime and mistakenly called an early timeout, so the Mavs had to bring in the ball at backcourt rather than half-court for the last possession. In Game 6, the Mavericks took an early double-digit lead, but again, Wade poured in 36 points, helped by Alonzo Mourning's five blocked shots, and the Mavericks lost their fourth game and the title after a string of botched three-pointers. Many Mavericks fans were stunned by the defeat. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was fined a total of $250,000 for \"several acts of misconduct\" during the series, and Nowitzki was fined $5,000 for kicking a ball into the stands after Game 5. Nowitzki was also caught by TV cameras attacking a stationary bicycle in the hallway outside of the Mavericks locker room. Jerry Stackhouse was suspended for Game 5 after fouling Shaquille O'Neal on a breakaway dunk attempt. The latter marked the third time a Mavericks player was suspended in the 2006 playoffs.\n\n\nThe Mavericks became only the third team in NBA history (the first since 1977) to lose in the finals after taking a 2\u20130 lead. In Game 3, the Mavs held a 13-point lead under seven minutes remaining but were outscored 22\u20137 in the momentum-changing 98\u201396 defeat. The Heat's performance in the last seven minutes represented the team's most remarkable postseason comeback in team history.[20]\n\n\n\n#### 2006\u20132007: Nowitzki wins MVP[edit]\n\n\nAfter an end to their playoff run in 2006, the Mavericks sought retribution in the new season. After a 0\u20134 start, the Mavericks went on a historic run and posted a 52\u20135 record over their next 57 games. They finished the regular season with a record of 67\u201315, good enough to be tied for sixth place all-time, first in the league, and the number 1 seed in the Western Conference playoffs. Dirk Nowitzki had a dominant season, further cementing his place as one of the game's elite players; he won his fifth consecutive Euroscar during the season and was named the NBA MVP at its end. Josh Howard was named to the all-star team.\n\n\nHowever, the first-place Mavericks were defeated in six games by the eighth-seeded Golden State Warriors. This outcome is regarded as one of the biggest upsets in NBA history.[21] The Mavs were exposed defensively, and the Warriors systematically dismantled the Mavericks by exploiting match-ups and preying on Dirk Nowitzki's weaknesses. The Mavericks went 67\u201312 against the rest of the league and 0\u20133 against Golden State on the year. The Warriors were coached by Don Nelson, the immediate past manager and coach of the Mavericks. He had been appointed head coach of the Warriors in the 2006\u201307 mid-season.\n\n\nNowitzki's winning of regular season MVP honors and his team's first-round exit created an awkward dilemma regarding the MVP trophy ceremony. Traditionally, MVP awards are given to the winner in a ceremony between the first and second rounds of the playoffs. It is believed[22] that the league opted to put some distance between the MVP presentation and the Mavericks' elimination against the Warriors. By the time Nowitzki collected his MVP award, nearly two weeks had elapsed since the Mavs were ousted.\n\n\n\n#### 2007\u20132008: The return of Jason Kidd[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2007\u201308 Dallas Mavericks season\n\n![](image)Kidd drives to the basket during a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.\nThe Mavericks dealt Devin Harris, two first-round picks, and others to the New Jersey Nets for veteran all-star Jason Kidd and other role players; Cuban also tried to sign the free agent Kevin Garnett unsuccessfully. The Mavericks were 3\u201311 against winning teams since the trade and lost Nowitzki for a little over a week due to a high ankle sprain injury. He returned April 2 in a crucial game against the Golden State Warriors in a 111\u201386 Mavericks victory and helped defeat the Phoenix Suns in a 105\u201398 win on April 6. Dallas' win in Phoenix was especially significant because the Mavs had been nearly unable to defeat a contending team on the road the entire season. Continuing their playoff push, Dirk hit a crucial three-pointer with 0.9 seconds left, beating the Utah Jazz 97\u201394 on April 10. This victory guaranteed them a playoff spot and their eighth consecutive 50-win season. The Mavericks ended the season with a record of 51\u201331. In the first round of the playoffs, the Mavericks were eliminated by the New Orleans Hornets 4\u20131 on the road, 99\u201394.\n\n\nJust one day after a disappointing season ended, Avery Johnson was dismissed as head coach of the Dallas Mavericks. On May 9, 2008, Rick Carlisle was hired as the head coach.[23][24][25][26][27]\n\n\n\n#### 2008\u20132010: Falls in the playoffs[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2008\u201309 Dallas Mavericks season and 2009\u201310 Dallas Mavericks season\n\nAfter getting off to 2\u20137 start, the Mavericks eventually found themselves with the sixth spot in the Western Conference playoff bracket for 2009 after going 50\u201332 (ninth consecutive 50+-win season). About three to four weeks earlier, they were not even sure if they would make the eighth and final spot. But a run of 5\u20131 in their last six regular season games got them to a game over the Hornets for sixth place. Dirk Nowitzki also entered the postseason with a streak of twenty-five consecutive games of scoring 20 or more points, which was ended in the first game of the quarterfinals series versus the arch-rival, San Antonio Spurs.\n\n\nThe Mavericks surprised many people by winning Game 1, 106\u201397 in San Antonio.[28] The Spurs quickly won game two in a rout. As the series shifted to Dallas, who had only lost one game there after the All-Star Break, won both Games 3 and 4. San Antonio was trying to win Game 5 to extend the series, but they could not do it as the Mavericks closed out the series with a 13-point-victory, 106\u201393. With the Victory, the Mavericks advanced to the Conference semi-finals for the first time since 2006.\n\n\nThey faced the two-seeded Denver Nuggets in the semi-finals, who were fresh off a 4\u20131 series win against the New Orleans Hornets, including a 58-point win in New Orleans. The Mavericks stayed close with the Nuggets in the first three-quarters of Games 1 and 2, but it was the fourth quarter when Carmelo Anthony and the Nuggets woke up, as they took the first two games by double-digit figures. Game 3 in Dallas was close the whole way, and Dallas led by five points with less than a minute to go. But Carmelo Anthony hit a three-pointer to give the Nuggets a 106\u2013105 victory. The play generated quite a bit of controversy because Maverick guard Antoine Wright fouled Anthony, but since there was no replay used in the NBA in 2009, the Mavericks suffered a Game 3 loss. The league later announced that the referees made the wrong call,[29] but despite that, the Mavericks still faced a 3\u20130 deficit in the series.\n\n\nNowitzki's 44 points in Game 4 saved the Mavericks season, sending the series back to Denver for a Game 5, with the series in Denver's favor, 3\u20131. Game 5 would prove to be the final game for the Mavericks of the 2009 season, as a score of 124\u2013110 would oust them. The elimination led to an off-season facing many questions about the future construction of the team.\n\n\nAfter a disappointing loss to the Nuggets in the playoffs, the Mavericks entered the off-season with many questions about the team's future construction. They began by re-signing Jason Kidd to a three-year contract extension, which took care of their pending point guard issue. The Mavericks also made a transaction to compound their age problem by trading for All-Star small forward Shawn Marion. In a three-team deal with the Grizzlies and Raptors, the Mavericks sent swingman Antoine Wright and defensive stalwart Devean George to Toronto, while aging guard Jerry Stackhouse landed in Memphis. Dallas also acquired athletic center Nathan Jawai and power forward Kris Humphries. Many analysts viewed this as a beneficial trade for the Mavericks, given that it countered their age issues while also providing them with more depth on the bench.[30] The Mavericks also added veteran forwards Tim Thomas, Drew Gooden, and Quinton Ross.\n\n\n\n![](image)Jason Terry spent eight years with the Mavericks, playing both of the teams' NBA Finals.\nThese moves proved successful because after dropping the season opener to the Wizards, the Mavericks beat many contenders such as the Los Angeles Lakers, San Antonio Spurs, Houston Rockets, and the Phoenix Suns.\n\n\nA day before the trade deadline, the Mavericks instigated a deal. The trade sent Josh Howard, James Singleton, and Drew Gooden to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Caron Butler, Brendan Haywood, and Deshawn Stevenson. The Mavericks felt that this trade was necessary due to Howard's declining performance and apparent unhappiness with the Mavericks organization. Some NBA analysts thought that this was a good move, because not only did it remove a disgruntled Howard from the line-up, it simultaneously brought Dirk Nowitzki a quality supporting cast. Many believed that the Mavs could contend for a title after the trade went through.[31][32] The trade worked because the new-look Mavericks came out of the all-star break with a vengeance. On January 24, 2010, the Dallas Mavericks routed The New York Knicks 128\u201378. This win was the third-largest margin of victory in NBA history. The previous largest margin of victory for the Mavericks was 45 points. After dropping the second-half opener to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavericks went on to win 13-straight games before losing to the New York Knicks. On April 10, the Mavericks clinched the Southwest division after defeating the Portland Trail Blazers 83\u201377. The Mavericks finished the season with a 55\u201327 record, good enough for the Western Conference's second seed. The Mavericks then entered the postseason with quite a bit of optimism and an assurance that they could earnestly contend for a title.\n\n\nDuring the playoffs, though, this optimism proved to be short-lived. After winning game one 100\u201394, behind Nowitzki's 36-point performance, the Mavericks dropped the next three games to their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, before winning game five. Dallas would eventually lose against San Antonio in six games 97\u201387, leading to yet another off-season full of speculation, mostly centering on franchise player Dirk Nowitzki's pending free agent status.\n\n\n\n#### 2010\u20132011: Championship season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2011 NBA Finals\n\n![](image)Mavericks owner Mark Cuban holding the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy during the championship parade\nAfter yet another first-round exit, the Mavericks began an unexpectedly early off-season. The first order of business for Mark Cuban and the Mavericks[33] was to re-sign Dirk Nowitzki, and they did so on July 4, 2010, when the Mavericks and Nowitzki agreed to a four-year deal worth $80\u00a0million. On July 13, the Mavericks, after losing the opportunity to sign LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, or Amar'e Stoudemire, acquired centers Tyson Chandler and Alexis Ajin\u00e7a from the Charlotte Bobcats for center Erick Dampier, forward Eduardo N\u00e1jera, and guard Matt Carroll. *USA Today* called this trade one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history, saying Chandler \"was the perfect fit during his first season with the Mavericks, anchoring their defense on the way to the franchise's first championship.\"[34]\n\n\nThe 2010\u201311 campaign saw the Mavericks fly out of the gate, winning 24 out of their first 29 games. However, on December 27, Dirk Nowitzki sustained a knee injury that derailed the Mavericks' momentum. The team's second-leading scorer Caron Butler suffered a season-ending knee injury himself only four nights later. The Mavericks then went on to drop seven of their next nine games, causing serious concern as to who would lead the offense in Nowitzki's absence. However, this injury would prove to only be a temporary setback because Nowitzki only missed nine games and admittedly rushed back to assist the Mavericks' reeling offense. Consequently, they quickly returned to their winning ways. The Mavericks re-invented their defensive reputation around the league during the 2010\u201311 campaign, mostly in part to off-season acquisition Tyson Chandler (who was later named to the All-Defensive Second Team).[35] The Mavericks battled the San Antonio Spurs all season long for the division title, but instead settled for the third seed, with a 57\u201325 record. The Mavericks had a lousy reputation of struggling during the playoffs; many predicted them to be eliminated in the first round against the six-seeded Portland Trail Blazers.[36] Yahoo! Sports analyst Adrian Wojnarowski even went so far as to predict a sweep for the Trail Blazers.\n\n\nThe Mavs won Games 1 and 2 on their home floor in convincing fashion. However, upon their arrival at the Rose Garden in Portland, problems began to arise. After dropping game three to Portland, the Mavericks blew a 23-point fourth-quarter lead in game four to allow Portland to tie the series at two games apiece. The whispers then began to re-surface that the Mavericks would let another impressive regular season go down the drain.[37] The Mavericks then responded, posting back-to-back wins to oust the Blazers in six games. They then met the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Semi-finals. This series would be the first and only time that Kobe Bryant met Dirk Nowitzki in a playoff series and was expected to be extremely competitive; however, it did not prove the case. The Mavericks shocked the NBA world by winning the first two games in Los Angeles, heading back to Dallas. They then won a thrilling game three in Dallas, courtesy of 32 points from Nowitzki in a 98\u201392 victory. The Mavericks then provided the perfect \"exclamation point\"[38] crushing the Lakers in Game 4 by a final score of 122\u201386. In that game, Jason Terry set an NBA playoff record with nine three-pointers with just one miss, ousting the Lakers in a four-game sweep. The Mavericks then met the upstart Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Finals. Dirk Nowitzki set the tone in the series in game one with a 48-point performance, with the Mavericks taking Game 1 by a score of 121\u2013112. The Thunder then responded with 106\u2013100 victory in Game 2. The Mavericks then won the next three games, including a 15-point comeback in Game 4, to take the five-game series. The Mavericks claimed their second Western Conference Championship in franchise history and met the team that defeated them in the 2006 NBA Finals, the Miami Heat.\n\n\nThe Mavericks entered the 2011 NBA Finals as underdogs, due to Miami's Big Three coming together at the start of the season. After dropping Game 1 in Miami by a score of 92\u201384, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of Game 2, with the Mavericks trailing 88\u201373, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0\u20132 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22\u20135 run to end the game, stunned the Heat with a game two victory, and evened the series at one game apiece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in Game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a final score of 88\u201386. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal Game 4 with Nowitzki hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch, and the Mavericks defeated the Heat 112\u2013103, putting them one game from their first-ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first-ever NBA title with a 105\u201395 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors after averaging 26 points a game during the series, shedding the Mavericks label as \"soft\" and putting an end to the Mavericks' postseason futility.\n\n\n\n#### 2011\u20132013: Post-championship struggles and later absence from playoffs[edit]\n\n\nThe 2011\u201312 season was shortened to 66 games due to a lockout, which meant the Mavericks had to wait until Christmas Day to raise their first championship banner. During the brief off-season, owner Mark Cuban decided to maintain financial flexibility by letting Tyson Chandler, DeShawn Stevenson, J.J. Barea, and Caron Butler go. Chandler signed with the New York Knicks, Stevenson joined the New Jersey Nets, Barea went to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and Butler joined the Los Angeles Clippers. Meanwhile, they acquired incumbent Sixth Man of the Year Lamar Odom via a trade with the Lakers, while signing veterans Vince Carter and Delonte West.\n\n\nThe Mavericks raised their championship banner before their Finals rematch with the Heat on Christmas Day. Still, in what would soon become a mirror image of the 2006\u201307 Heat's eventual failed title defense, Miami blew them out in a 105\u201394 loss, marking Dallas's first regular season loss to Miami in eight seasons. Things did not get better for Dallas after starting the season 0\u20133, losing to the Thunder in a playoff rematch on December 29. As the calendar turned to 2012, the Mavericks won 14 of 18 games in January, but they posted a 22\u201322 record the rest of the way, eventually finishing seventh with a 36\u201330 record, their lowest finish since the 2007\u201308 season. Nowitzki produced 21.6 points, 6 rebounds, and 45.7% shooting, his most insufficient numbers since the 2000\u201301 season. Meanwhile, Odom, who proved to be a bad fit for the Mavericks, was deactivated for the final two months of the season.\n\n\nIn a rematch from the previous year, the Mavericks faced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the 2012 NBA playoffs. Games 1 and 2 went down to the wire, but the Mavericks fell short on both occasions as Kevin Durant made a game-winning jumper in Game 1, and late-game free throws in Game 2. Back in Dallas for Game 3, the Mavericks suffered a 95\u201379 defeat to fall behind 0\u20133. In Game 4, the Mavericks led for much of the second half, but James Harden's 15-point fourth-quarter rallied the Thunder to a 103\u201397 win to eliminate the defending champions. It marked the first time Dallas was swept in a seven-game series. They became the third defending champion to be swept in the first round after the aforementioned 2006\u201307 Heat and the 1956\u201357 Philadelphia Warriors.\n\n\nDuring the 2012 off-season, the Mavericks lost both Jason Kidd and Jason Terry to free agency. Kidd signed with the New York Knicks, while Terry joined the Boston Celtics. Brendan Haywood was later amnestied before moving to the Charlotte Bobcats. The Mavericks acquired Darren Collison from the Indiana Pacers and signed O.J. Mayo from the Memphis Grizzlies. Also joining the team were former All-Stars Chris Kaman and Elton Brand.\n\n\nThe 2012\u201313 season was a struggle for the Mavericks, as Nowitzki recovered from knee surgery and missed 29 games. Also, Collison was inexperienced at the point, leading the Mavericks to sign veteran Derek Fisher for nine games,[39] before settling on Mike James. Mayo was the team's leading scorer for the first two months of the season before Nowitzki's return saw his averages dip. Injuries also hounded Kaman and Brand. The Mavericks were 23\u201329 at the All-Star break, before making a late push for a playoff berth. Still, it did not save their season, and the Mavericks missed the playoffs for the first time since 2000.\n\n\n\n#### 2013\u20132016: Return to the playoffs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Monta Ellis (right) and Chandler Parsons (left) each spent two seasons with the Mavericks.\nDuring the 2013 off-season, the Mavericks chose not to re-sign role players Collison, Brand, and Kaman. Mayo then declined to exercise his player option and later signed with the Milwaukee Bucks. The Mavericks signed Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n from the Detroit Pistons and Monta Ellis from the Bucks. They also signed veteran Samuel Dalembert.\n\n\nOn April 4, 2014, the Mavericks swept the season series with the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time since the 1980\u201381 season with a 107\u201395 win.[40]\n\n\nThe Mavericks finished 49\u201333, one game ahead of Phoenix for the eighth and final playoff spot, which meant that they would once again have to face their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, the top seed in the Western Conference with a 62\u201320 record. In Game 1 in San Antonio, Dallas had an 81\u201371 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1, 85\u201390. However, the Mavs forced 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113\u201392, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, Manu Gin\u00f3bili hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108\u2013106 with 1.7 seconds left, but a buzzer-beater by Vince Carter gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2\u20131 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93\u201389 despite a late Dallas comeback, after the Spurs at one point had a 20-point lead and later won Game 5 at home, 109\u2013103, giving them a 3\u20132 series lead. The Mavs avoided elimination in Game 6 at home by rallying in the fourth quarter, winning 111\u2013113. Game 7 was on the Spurs home court, and the Spurs beat the Mavericks 119\u201396, putting an end to the Mavericks' season.\n\n\nIn the 2014 off-season, the Mavericks made several moves, the first of which was trading for Tyson Chandler and Raymond Felton from the New York Knicks, sending Calder\u00f3n, Dalembert, Shane Larkin, and Wayne Ellington as well as two-second-round draft picks, on June 26, 2014, right before the draft. Nowitzki also took a generous discount, re-signing for three years and $25\u00a0million, which helped Dallas sign restricted free agent Chandler Parsons from the Houston Rockets to a three-year contract at $46\u00a0million. Devin Harris was re-signed for four years and $16\u00a0million. Dallas brought in Richard Jefferson, Al-Farouq Aminu, Jameer Nelson, Greg Smith to build a deep bench. The Mavs' sixth man, Vince Carter, left in free agency to the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\n\nOn November 13, 2014, the Mavericks recorded their largest victory ever with a 123\u201370 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. The 53-point margin for Dallas surpassed its 50-point win over the New York Knicks in January 2010.[41] Two days later, they scored 131 points to record their biggest point tally since 2009 in the win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.[42]\n\n\nOn December 18, 2014, the Mavericks sent Jae Crowder, Jameer Nelson, Brandan Wright, a 2015 first-round pick and a 2016 second-round pick to the Boston Celtics for Rajon Rondo and Dwight Powell.[43]\n\n\nOn April 28, 2015, the Mavericks were knocked out of the first round by their in-state rivals, the Houston Rockets, in a 4\u20131 series loss. After going down 3\u20130 in a Game 3 overtime, the Mavericks managed to win one on their homecourt before losing in Houston in the clinching game, 103\u201394. The Mavericks were the seventh seed in the playoffs and finished the season 50\u201332.\n\n\nOn April 25, 2016, the Mavericks were once again knocked out of the first round, this time, by the Oklahoma City Thunder in a 4\u20131 series loss. After managing to win a game at OKC and tying the series 1\u20131, the Mavericks lost three straight to lose the series. This series was marked by both teams' physicality, including a Kevin Durant Flagrant 2 foul and several Mavericks playing very aggressive defense on Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant.\n\n\n\n#### 2016\u20132019: Lottery return, the arrival of Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Dirk's final years[edit]\n\n\nThe Mavericks did not make the playoffs during the 2016\u201317 season, despite efforts from their newest additions, Seth Curry, Harrison Barnes, Nerlens Noel, and Yogi Ferrell. They began the season going 3\u201315 through their first 18 games, and could not bounce back, finishing at a 33\u201349 record despite fighting towards a winning record, even reaching a 28\u201336 record partway through the season. This season was the second time in 17 years they missed the playoffs, with the other being the 2012\u20132013 season. The season marked the first time the team finished with a losing record since the 1999\u20132000 season.\n\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks received the ninth pick in the 2017 NBA draft and used it to select point guard Dennis Smith Jr. out of North Carolina State. They began the 2017\u201318 season 3\u201315 through their first eighteen games as in the year prior and concluded it on a 2\u201312 slump to finish with a 24\u201358 record despite a solid rookie season from Smith Jr., who averaged 15.2 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 5.2 assists over 69 games, landing a spot on the All-Rookie Second Team. This season was the team's worst season since the 1997\u201398 season, in which they finished 20\u201362 and drafted Dirk Nowitzki afterward.\n\n\nIn the 2018 NBA draft, Dallas traded for Luka Don\u010di\u0107, who was drafted third by the Atlanta Hawks.[44] Dallas traded their 2018 first-round pick, the fifth overall pick, and their 2019 first-round pick, the 10th overall pick. The two selections resulted in Trae Young and Cam Reddish, respectively.[45] Head coach Rick Carlisle described Don\u010di\u0107 as \"a guy that we think is a franchise foundation piece.\"[46] On July 6, 2018, long-time Los Angeles Clippers center DeAndre Jordan (who had been with the Clippers since 2008), signed a one-year deal.[47][48] The Mavericks finished the season with a record of 33\u201349 and missed the playoffs despite Don\u010di\u0107 winning Rookie of the Year.[49] Nowitzki announced his retirement at season's end; his 21st season with the Mavericks marked the longest that any NBA player in history spent with a single franchise.\n\n\n\n### 2019\u2013present: The Luka Don\u010di\u0107 era[edit]\n\n\n#### 2019\u20132021: Return to playoff contention and Don\u010di\u0107's rise[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Luka Don\u010di\u0107 in 2021\nOn January 31, 2019, the Mavericks sent Dennis Smith Jr., DeAndre Jordan, Wesley Matthews, and two future first-round draft picks to the New York Knicks in exchange for Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is, Tim Hardaway Jr., Courtney Lee, and Trey Burke.[50] At the quarter-mark of the 2019\u201320 season, the Mavericks began with a 15\u20136 record through their first 21 games. With Luka Don\u010di\u0107 averaging a near 30-point triple-double, leading the Mavericks in points, rebounds, and assists and entering MVP contention, he led the Mavericks to the top-rated offense in the league.[51] On December 12, 2019, the Mavericks won against the Detroit Pistons in Mexico City, due to the NBA's efforts to expand internationally.[52] During that game, Luka Don\u010di\u0107 tallied 41 points, 12 rebounds, and 11 assists, becoming the first player in NBA history to record multiple 40-point triple-doubles before turning 21-years-old. Don\u010di\u0107 was later selected to his first NBA All-Star Game as a Western Conference starter.[53]\n\n\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Mavericks were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the regular season's final eight games. They resumed play on July 31, with a 153\u2013149 loss against the Houston Rockets.[54] On August 2, after the Memphis Grizzlies lost against the San Antonio Spurs, the Mavericks clinched a spot in the 2020 NBA playoffs no worse than the seventh seed, marking their first trip since 2016.[55] Don\u010di\u0107 was announced as one of the three finalists for the NBA Most Improved Player Award.[56] In the first round against the Los Angeles Clippers, which was the first time the two teams ever faced off in the playoffs, the Mavericks lost 4\u20132, despite historically great performances by Don\u010di\u0107.[57] Don\u010di\u0107 later was selected to the All-NBA First Team.\n\n\nThe 2020\u201321 season saw Dallas have players miss 41 games to COVID-19 protocols,[58] with Maxi Kleber, Jalen Brunson, Josh Richardson and Dorian Finney-Smith missing most of those 41 games. Additionally the start of the season saw forward Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is missing the first 9 games as he recovered from off-season meniscus surgery. At one point Dallas dropped to 14th in the Western conference largely in part due to missing key pieces of their rotation.[59] Despite this, Dallas improved on their previous season record and finished the season 42\u201330. The Mavericks clinched the Southwest division for the first time since the 2009\u201310 season following a 110\u201390 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on May 7, 2021.[60] However the Mavericks lost in the first round to the Los Angeles Clippers for the second consecutive season in seven games.[61]\n\n\n\n#### 2021\u2013present: Post-Carlisle era[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the season on June 17, 2021, longtime head coach Rick Carlisle resigned from his position as head coach after 13 seasons.[62][63]\n\n\nThe 2021\u201322 season is the first season since 2004\u201305 without long-time general manager Donnie Nelson, as he announced his departure from the team on June 17, 2021, a day prior to Rick Carlisle's mutual parting with the team. Carlisle and Nelson were part of the Mavericks' 2010\u201311 championship squad, with Nelson being part of the 2005\u201306 team that made the 2006 NBA Finals.[64][65]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2021, Jason Kidd, a player on the 2010\u201311 championship team, was hired as head coach of the team.[66]\n\n\nUnder Kidd, the Mavericks finished the 2021\u201322 season with a 52\u201330 record, which netted them the fourth seed in the Western Conference. The Mavericks won their first playoff series since their 2011 championship season by defeating the Utah Jazz, 4\u20132, in the first round of the 2022 NBA playoffs.[67] The Mavericks won two of the games with Don\u010di\u0107 out due to injury. The Mavericks then faced the Phoenix Suns, who won a league-best 64 games in the regular season. After being down 3\u20132, Mavericks star Luka Don\u010di\u0107 said, \"Everybody acts tough when they're up.\"[68] The Mavericks won the next two games to advance to their first Western Conference Finals since 2011. In Game 7, the Mavericks beat the Suns by 33 points, and at one point they had a 46-point lead. Jalen Brunson broke out as a star alongside Spencer Dinwiddie and Don\u010di\u0107, averaging 23 points in the first two series.[69]\n\n\nAfter Voyager Digital, a cryptocurrency lender, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022,[70] Mark Cuban and the Mavericks were named in a class-action lawsuit that alleged that Voyager Digital was a Ponzi scheme the following month due to Cuban's promotion of Voyager and Voyager's sponsorship with the team.[71][72] In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media.[73]\n\n\n\n## Uniforms[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![1980\u20132001 h jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**1980\u20132001 h**\n | ![](image)\n\n![1980\u201381 a jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**1980\u201381 a**\n | ![](image)\n\n![1981\u20131992 a jersey](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**1981\u20131992 a**\n | ![](image)\n\n![1992\u20132001 a jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**1992\u20132001 a**\n | ![](image)\n\n![2003\u201304 t jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2003\u201304 t**\n | ![](image)\n\n![2001\u20132010 a jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2001\u20132010 a**\n |\n\n\nDuring their expansion season of 1980\u201381, the Mavericks road uniform colors were royal blue with green and white trim, but the green and blue were reversed a year later, and green was the dominant road uniform color through 1992. However, in the 1992\u201393 season, they went back to their original road uniform scheme from their expansion season, with minor alterations to the \"Dallas\" script, a design that the Mavericks used until 2001. From 1980 to 2001, the home white uniforms had \"Mavericks\" in blue, with green and white trim, with a few minor alterations to the \"Mavericks\" script during the 1990s.[74] The 1980s green road jerseys were revived in the 2004\u201305 season as part of the Mavericks' 25th anniversary. However, while the lettering from the 1980s uniform was present, the number scheme resembled the 1993\u20132001 uniforms. The green uniforms would be revived again in the 2015\u201316 season, still with the 1990s number scheme. The aforementioned uniforms were brought back for the 2020\u201321 season as part of Nike's \"Classic\" set, this time with the proper number scheme.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Dallas Mavericks' wordmark logo\nIn the 2001\u201302 NBA season, the Mavericks drastically updated their logos and uniforms, with a new Dallas Cowboys-inspired color scheme of midnight blue, royal blue and silver. The new uniforms consist of a \"Dallas\" script on both the home and road jerseys. On the home jersey, \"Dallas\" is in midnight blue across the chest and the numbers are in royal blue with silver trim, while on the road jersey, \"Dallas\" is in white, with the numbers in silver and white trim.\n\n\nIn the 2003\u201304 NBA season, the Mavericks debuted their shiny silver alternate uniforms, with \"Mavericks\" in white and royal blue trim, with blue numerals. However, it proved to be unpopular with fans (thus derisively nicknamed the 'Trash Bags'), and it was scrapped after just one game (at Lakers on October 28, 2003).\n\n\nIn the 2004\u201305 NBA season, the Mavericks introduced an alternate green uniform similar to their 1980s road uniforms. They were designed by rapper Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs, and featured \"Mavs\" in white on the front side of the jersey with blue trim, and the numbers in silver with white trim above the script on the left chest.\n\n\nOn September 21, 2009, the Mavericks unveiled a new alternate royal blue uniform with the same \"Mavs\" script, replacing the green uniform. The said uniform will also be used for the NBA's Noche Latina promotion, with the wordmark \"Los Mavs.\".[75]\n\n\nOn August 19, 2010, the Mavericks unveiled yet another change to their uniform set, with a new royal blue road uniform that displays the \"Dallas\" script in navy blue with silver numbers, both with white trim. The alternate royal blue uniform was retired as a result and this new uniform has replaced the midnight blue one as the main road uniform.[76] However the 'Los Mavs' uniforms were still in use despite the change, but would be the last time the Mavericks participated in the 'Noche Latina' uniform events.\n\n\nOn December 13, 2011, during media day, the Mavericks unveiled an alternate uniform based on the last alternate uniform they wore in the 2009\u201310 season, except that the base color is navy blue and the number is positioned below the team nickname 'Mavs' rather than above, effectively reversing roles.\n\n\nOn September 23, 2014, the Mavericks unveiled a new navy alternate uniform, featuring a depiction of the Dallas skyline in silver with white trim. The uniform was selected among thousands of entries as part of a design-a-uniform contest the Mavericks initiated during the 2013\u201314 season, but was not worn until the 2015\u201316 season.\n\n\nWith the switch to Nike as the uniform supplier in 2017, the home and away uniform designations were eliminated. In its place are the \"Icon\" uniforms, \"Association\" uniforms, \"Statement\" uniforms and \"City\" uniforms. The Mavericks' white uniforms are part of the \"Association\" set, the royal blue uniforms are identified with the \"Icon\" set, and the navy blue uniforms are included in the \"Statement\" set.\n\n\nFor the \"City\" set, the Mavericks wore black uniforms with \"DAL\" and the numbers in royal blue with neon green trim (a nod to the original Mavericks' colors). This set was worn only during the 2017\u201318 season, after which a new \"City\" uniform would be designed. The new \"City\" uniform was unveiled in November 2018. The \"DAL\" across the chest was replaced with the team's secondary logo and the neon green trim was removed, with the numbers no longer having a trim color. The \"City\" uniform for the 2019\u201320 season featured a stylized \"MAVS\" wordmark inspired from graffiti paintings. The uniform base had a light blue/navy blue gradient and neon green trim. The \"City\" uniform for 2020\u201321 featured a white base with gold and silver trim, which was said to be inspired by Pegasus, a Dallas symbol.\n\n\nPrior to the 2019\u201320 season, the Mavericks drastically redesigned their navy \"Statement\" uniforms, eliminating the Dallas skyline and reverting to the full team name \"Mavericks\" in front. The uniform contains white lettering and white and royal blue side stripes.\n\n\nDuring the 2021\u201322 season, in commemoration of the NBA's 75th anniversary, the Mavericks wore \"City\" uniforms featuring various elements taken from past uniforms. The template used is from their current uniforms, but with green striping. The typography resembled the Mavericks' uniforms from 1980 to 2001, and featured a modified version of the cowboy hat logo (except the \"M\" was replaced with a \"D\"). A recolored version of the current horse logo appears on the shorts, and the skyline silhouette from their 2015\u20132019 navy alternates is placed on the beltline.\n\n\nThe 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform featured retro-style white letters with green trim on a blue base, which was a nod to the late 1970s\u2013early 1980s disco era that served as a boom period within the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex.[77]\n\n\n\n## Head coaches[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Dallas Mavericks head coaches\n\n![](image)Rick Carlisle, head coach from 2008 to 2021\nThere have been nine head coaches for the Mavericks franchise. The franchise's first head coach was Dick Motta, who served for two non-consecutive stints and coached for nine seasons with the Mavericks. Motta is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular season games coached (738); Don Nelson, Donnie Nelson's father, is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular season game wins (339); Avery Johnson is the franchise's all-time leader for the most playoff games coached (47), the most playoff-game wins (23), and the highest winning percentage in the regular season (.735). Nelson is also named one of the top 10 coaches in NBA history.[78] Johnson was the first coach to win the Western Conference championship, losing the 2006 NBA Finals to the Miami Heat.[79] Johnson is also the only Mavericks coach to have won the NBA Coach of the Year Award, having won it in the 2005\u201306 season.[80] Quinn Buckner and Jim Cleamons have spent their entire NBA coaching careers with the Mavericks. Only one of the Mavericks coaches, Don Nelson, has been elected into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach.[81] Rick Carlisle was the head coach of the Mavericks from 2008 to 2021.[82][62][63] Carlisle led the team to their first championship in franchise history in 2011, against their 2006 Finals opponent, the Miami Heat, in a rematch. In 2015, he passed Motta as the winningest coach in franchise history. Currently, the head coach is Jason Kidd, who in 2022 led the Mavericks to the team's first playoff series win since the 2011 championship season that he won as a player.\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

First they came head to head in the 2006 NBA Finals, in which the two teams captured their first respective conference titles. The Mavericks came into the series 60\u201322 with a strong group of players while the Miami Heat came in with a respectable 52\u201330 record and sported an aging but still strong Shaquille O'Neal as well as an up-and-coming Dwyane Wade. Dallas was favored by many in the media to win the series. The Dallas Mavericks won the first two games but Miami went on to sweep the next four and win the NBA championship for the first time in team history.\n\n\nBoth teams saw success over the next few seasons and appeared in the playoffs multiple times, and would ultimately go on to have a rematch in the 2011 NBA Finals. It was also the first time that either team had reached the Finals since 2006. This time, however, Miami was favored to win after the highly publicized signings of LeBron James and Chris Bosh to their roster. Dallas came in with a 57\u201325 record while the Heat came in 58\u201324. Miami won the first game 92\u201384, but Dallas went on to win four of the next five and upset the Heat to win the first title in franchise history.\n\n\n\n### San Antonio Spurs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mavericks\u2013Spurs rivalry\n\nThe Mavericks-Spurs rivalry is relatively new but very fierce. It features two teams with Dallas roots\u2014the Spurs began their life in the ABA as the Dallas Chaparrals and did not move to San Antonio until 1973. On October 11, 1980, the Mavericks made their NBA debut by defeating the Spurs 103\u201392. The teams have met numerous times in the playoffs, with the Spurs defeating the Mavericks in 2001, 2003, 2010, and 2014, while the Mavericks defeated the Spurs in 2006 and 2009. The Spurs have won five championships and six conference titles, while the Mavericks have won one championship and two conference titles. The Spurs have won 15 division titles, while the Mavericks have won 3. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks have 3 60-win seasons. This is known as the \"I-35 rivalry\" because both cities lie on Interstate 35.\n\n\nThe two teams met in the playoffs during the 2000\u20132001 season with the Spurs winning in five games. Little was made during this series, as the Spurs won their first NBA championship only two years before. The Mavericks, run by a trio of Steve Nash, Michael Finley, and Dirk Nowitzki, had just defeated the Utah Jazz despite not having home-court advantage and were only starting to meld into a title contender.\n\n\nThe two teams met again in 2003 in the Western Conference Finals. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks had 60-win seasons and reached the Western Conference Finals after defeating the Los Angeles Lakers and the Sacramento Kings, respectively. Despite having the best season of their history, the Mavericks fell in six games to the Spurs.\n\n\nThe rivalry took on a new meaning in 2005 when, near the end of the regular season, Don Nelson would resign as head coach of the Mavericks, apparently satisfied with the state of the team, and hand the coaching reins to former Spur Avery Johnson, the point guard of the 1999 NBA champion Spurs team who hit the game-winning shot against the New York Knicks. Since Johnson was coached under Spurs' head coach Gregg Popovich, he would be familiar with most, if not all, of Popovich's coaching style and philosophy. During the 2005 off-season, Michael Finley, waived by the Mavericks under the amnesty clause, joined the Spurs in search for the elusive title.\n\n\nDuring the 2006 playoffs the two rivals met again. San Antonio won the first game at home 87\u201385. The Mavericks got revenge the next game, winning 113\u201391 and evening the series up at 1\u20131. The Mavericks then won a dramatic Game 3 by a single point, 104\u2013103. Though Manu Gin\u00f3bili could have made a game-winning basket with five seconds on the clock, he committed an error, allowing the ball to bounce away from him with one second remaining. Dallas won a tightly-contested Game 4 123\u2013118 in overtime. The Spurs proceeded to avoid elimination by taking Game 5. In the final seconds of the game, Jason Terry was seen punching former teammate Michael Finley under the belt, leading to his suspension for Game 6. He was sorely missed as the Spurs won, taking the series back home for a Game 7. In the crucial Game 7, with 2.6 seconds to go, Nowitzki converted a three-point play to force overtime. Manu Gin\u00f3bili, who fouled Dirk on the play, had just given San Antonio their first lead one possession earlier. Tim Duncan, who had played in all 48 minutes of regulation, was too fatigued to carry his team in overtime. The Mavericks, meanwhile, were set to take control of the game and they did just that, winning 119\u2013111. The Mavericks went on to the Conference Finals where they defeated the Suns in six games, but succumbed to the champion Heat in the NBA Finals.\n\n\nDespite much anticipation of a renewed meeting in the 2007 Western Conference finals, the Mavericks lost to the Golden State Warriors in one of the greatest upsets in NBA history. The Spurs won the NBA finals after beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4\u20130.[83] The eighth seed Warriors, who made the playoffs on the last game of the NBA season, defeated the 67-win, first-seed Mavericks in six games.[84] Meanwhile, the Spurs would ultimately go on to win the 2007 NBA Championship, establishing themselves as a true NBA dynasty.[85][86][87][88] The season also gave longtime former Maverick Michael Finley his first championship. Many Spurs teammates claimed that the drive to win this season was partially to give Finley his first championship, especially since Finley had lost a bitter-fought series to his longtime team the year previous.[89]\n\n\nWorth noting in a regular season meeting between the two rivals in April 2007, a game that the Spurs won 91\u201386, Tim Duncan suffered his first career ejection for supposedly laughing while sitting on the bench. Joey Crawford, the referee who ejected Duncan, allegedly asked Duncan to a fight which led to the longtime ref's season-ending suspension. As Duncan was heading into the locker room, American Airlines Center erupted into a huge cheer, applauding Duncan's ejection. The game saw chippy play, with Jerry Stackhouse and Manu Gin\u00f3bili getting into an altercation after a rebound.\n\n\nIn the 2009 NBA playoffs, the Mavericks and Spurs squared off again in the first round. The Spurs and Mavericks split the first two games in San Antonio, but Dallas defeated the Spurs in games 3 and 4, both in Dallas. The Mavericks then went on to close out the series and eliminated the Spurs at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.\n\n\nIn 2010, the Dallas Mavericks matched up against the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Playoffs. Although the Mavericks managed to obtain the number two seed, they were defeated by the Spurs in six games.\n\n\nDuring the 2011 playoffs, a role reversal of sorts occurred between the two rivals, when the top-seeded Spurs were defeated by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies, the first time an eight-seed defeated a one-seed since the Mavericks-Warriors series of 2007. In addition, the Mavericks defeated the LeBron James-led Miami Heat in the NBA Finals.\n\n\nThe Mavericks were swept in the 2012\u201313 season by the Spurs for the first time since the 1997\u201398 season, Tim Duncan's rookie season. In their last match-up of the season, San Antonio escaped with a 92\u201391 victory over Dallas when a Vince Carter 3-point attempt bounced off the rim at the buzzer. With the win, the Spurs clinched a playoff spot for the 16th straight season, currently the longest streak in the NBA. San Antonio also reached 50 wins for the 14th straight season, the longest streak in NBA history.[90]\n\n\nIn the 2013\u201314 season, the Spurs once again swept the Mavericks in the regular season, giving them nine straight victories. In addition, an overtime loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on April 16, 2014, ensured that the Mavericks would face the Spurs once again in the 2014 NBA playoffs, where the Mavericks were the eighth seed and San Antonio the first. In Game 1 in San Antonio, the game was relatively close. Dallas reached an 81\u201371 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1 at home, 90\u201385. However, the Mavericks managed to force 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113\u201392, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, Manu Gin\u00f3bili managed to hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108\u2013106 with 1.7 left, but a buzzer-beater by Vince Carter gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2\u20131 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93\u201389 and later Game 5 at home 109\u2013103, giving them a 3\u20132 lead. The Mavericks won Game 6 at home by 113\u2013111. The Spurs won game 7 119\u201396, eliminating the Mavericks in the first round.\n\n\n\n### Phoenix Suns[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2004 off-season, former Dallas Mavericks point guard Steve Nash signed a free-agent deal with the 29\u201353 Phoenix Suns to help out their offense. The addition of Nash helped as Phoenix rolled to a 62\u201320 record and the best record in the NBA. The teams met in the 2005 Western Conference Semifinals with Phoenix having the home-court advantage.\n\n\nPhoenix won game 1 127\u2013102 with a 40-point game by Amar'e Stoudemire. Steve Nash was also given his NBA MVP award during that game, a game in which he terrorized his former team. However, Mavericks star Dirk Nowitzki hit a game-winning turn-around jumper in game 2 to beat Phoenix 108\u2013106 to send the series back to Dallas tied 1\u20131. Phoenix and Dallas split the two games in Dallas which saw both winners of games score 119 points. The series went back to Phoenix then took care of Dallas 114\u2013108 in the America West Arena (now US Airways Center). Then, in game 6, with Dallas facing elimination, Phoenix beat Dallas in a thriller which saw Steve Nash with a 39-point game, to go along with 12 assists. In the Western Conference Finals, Phoenix lost to the San Antonio Spurs, who then went on to win the NBA title.\n\n\nThe following year, a Suns team without Stoudemire (who was injured), Joe Johnson, and Quentin Richardson, but with a core of new players led by Raja Bell (who clotheslined Lakers star Kobe Bryant in a first-round series game), Boris Diaw and Tim Thomas to go along with Nash and fellow All-Star Shawn Marion. Phoenix had to play seven-game series against the two Los Angeles teams, the Los Angeles Lakers (who had a 3\u20131 lead against Phoenix) and the resurgent Los Angeles Clippers. In the Western Conference Finals, they faced a Mavericks team who won 60 games, but were forced to be the fourth seed since the division winners got the top three seeds. On their way to the Western Conference Finals, Dallas swept the Memphis Grizzlies, and beat in-state rival San Antonio Spurs in seven tense games. Phoenix won game 1 121\u2013118 after Diaw hit a game-winning shot in the dying seconds of the fourth quarter. Bell, though injured himself in game 1, missing Games Two and Three. After that, Dallas took control of the series, winning Games Two and Three by the scores of 105\u201398 and 95\u201388. Bell came back for game 4 and led Phoenix to a 106\u201386 win. Dallas however, beat Phoenix 117\u2013101 in game 5 which included a 50-point performance from Dirk Nowitzki, and eliminated the Suns in Phoenix 102\u201393 in game 6. Dallas would later lose to the Miami Heat in six games, despite winning the first two games.\n\n\nOn March 14, 2007, in Dallas, Phoenix beat Dallas in a 129\u2013127 double-overtime thriller. With the Mavericks up by 7 with a minute left in regulation, Dirk Nowitzki (a 90% free throw shooter) missed two free throws. Steve Nash fed off his mistakes and scored 10 straight points including the game-tying three-pointer with 3 seconds left to go. Dirk Nowitzki's potential game-winning shot bounced off the rim and sent the game to overtime. Jason Terry sent the game into another overtime with a game-tying three-pointer of his own. Dirk Nowitzki's potential game-tying shot in double overtime went in and out of the rim as Amar'e Stoudemire's 41 points were too much for Dallas to handle.\n\n\nOn April 10, 2013, the Mavericks 12-season playoff streak, since 2001, ended in a loss to the Suns 102\u201391.[91]\n\n\nOn April 12, 2014, the Mavs handed the Suns one of three straight losses to keep them out of the playoffs, 101\u201398. Their other two losses were to the San Antonio Spurs and Memphis Grizzlies.\n\n\nFrom the 2016\u201317 season through the 2021\u201322 regular season, the Suns dominated the rivalry, winning 17 out of 21 head-to-head games, including separate winning streaks of nine and seven games.[92]\n\n\nThe Mavericks and the Suns met again in the 2022 Western Conference Semifinals, in which the Suns were coming off a historic franchise-record 64 wins, while the Mavericks compiled 52 regular season wins. Despite the Suns being heavily favored to win and going up 2\u20130 in the series, the Suns' season ended in an upset 123\u201390 game 7 loss to the Mavericks on their home floor.[93]\n\n\n\n### Houston Rockets[edit]\n\n\nAn NBA intrastate rivalry, both in Texas linked by I-45, as well as both Dallas and Houston fans traditionally having a disdain for each other's city, the rivalry started when the Mavericks were the last Texas team to join the NBA. This is also known as the I-45 rivalry because they both lie on Interstate 45. In the Mavericks' inaugural season in 1980\u201381, the Rockets won all six meetings including a 116\u201368 win.[94] In the playoffs, the Mavericks defeated the Rockets in the 1988 and 2005 playoffs, the latter of which was plagued with allegations of game-fixing,[95] while the Rockets swept several season series with the Mavericks during the 1990s, and also during the Rockets' championship years. On April 11, 1995, the Mavericks defeated the Rockets 156\u2013147 in double overtime, making that win one of their most memorable victories against Houston who were the reigning champions. Two years later, the Rockets and Mavericks have clashed in their first-ever regular season game played in Mexico City, which was won by the Rockets 108\u2013106. In the 2010s, the rivalry has once again flourished with Dallas owner Mark Cuban and Rockets general manager Daryl Morey taking shots at each other on social media, as well as Houston fan-favorite Chandler Parsons signing an offer sheet to leave the Rockets to sign with the rival Mavericks for $46\u00a0million, while making negative statements about the city of Houston upon leaving,[96] causing massive backlash among Rockets fans. Finally, longtime Mavericks' player Jason Terry, who was a starter on the Mavericks' 2011 championship team, joined the Rockets for the 2014\u201315 season, and both teams met in the first round of the 2015 NBA playoffs, with the Rockets as the second seed and Mavericks the seventh seed, and the Rockets got the best of them 4\u20131.\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers[edit]\n\n\nThe rivalry between the Lakers and Mavericks began in the 1980s during the Lakers' Showtime era. In the 1984 NBA playoffs, the Lakers won over the Mavericks in the Western Conference Semi-finals with the series 4\u20131. In 1986, they met again in the semi-finals and the Lakers won the series 4\u20132. In the 1988 NBA playoffs, the Lakers, who were the defending champions, defeated the Mavericks in a seven-game series in the Western Conference Finals and eventually became the back-to-back champions after winning the NBA Finals. In 2011, the Mavericks met the two-time defending champions Lakers in the semi-finals and rejected their three-peat by sweeping them in four games and eventually won the NBA Finals. In Game 2 of the 2011 NBA playoffs, Ron Artest was ejected for hitting J. J. Barea and suspended for Game 3. In Game 4, Lamar Odom was ejected for pushing Dirk Nowitzki and then Andrew Bynum was ejected for elbowing J. J. Barea. Both players received flagrant foul 2. After the 2011 NBA lockout, Lamar Odom was sent to the Mavericks after he requested to leave the Lakers due to the vetoed Chris Paul trade. Andrew Bynum made a formal apology for what he did to Barea before the start of the following season.\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the Mavericks.

Sneed.[104][105] Marshall was the first black female CEO of an NBA franchise as well as the first woman ever to hold the position.[106]\n\n\nOwner Mark Cuban formally responded in March 2018 to allegations of a 2011 sexual assault that surfaced in a Sports Illustrated investigation released in February.[107] In an email to The Associated Press on March 6, Cuban stated, \"It didn't happen.\"[108] The organization hired a pair of independent investigators to look into allegations.[109] On September 19, 2018, the team's investigation report concluded that there were \"numerous instances of sexual harassment and other improper workplace conduct\" that had occurred within the organization, none of which being related to the allegation on Cuban himself. Cuban also agreed to donate $10\u00a0million in reparations to organizations related to women's causes, mainly those committed to combating domestic violence and supporting the professional development of women within the sports industry.\n\n\nOn October 5, 2018, over two weeks after the team publicly released their sexual harassment report, it was reported that team photographer Danny Bollinger made propositions to four now-former employees over the course of a decade. Bollinger was laid off by Cuban four days later.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"NBA.com\". National Basketball Association. Archived from the original on December 2, 2022.

It is modeled after the WNBA Commissioner's Cup and in-season multi-stage competitions held in European soccer. The tournament is structured as follows:[36][37][38]\n\n\n\n* Six intraconference pools of five.\n* Tuesdays and Fridays during November will feature group games against each of the other teams in their pool (two at home and two on the road). These games will still count as regular season games.\n* The winners of each pool and two wild-card teams will advance to a single-elimination tournament.\n* The semifinals and championship game will be played in Las Vegas.\n* Players for the tournament champion will each receive $500,000.\n* To compensate, the NBA's regular season scheduling formula will be modified so only 80 games for each team are initially announced during the offseason. The first two rounds of the in-season tournament would then count as regular season games 81 and 82. The championship game would then be an extra 83rd game that would not count toward the regular season. Teams that do not qualify for the in-season tournament, or are eliminated in the quarterfinals, would then be scheduled additional games against each other that are eliminated in the same conference (if possible) and round to reach 82 games.\n\n\nThe schedule for the in-season tournament was released on August 15, 2023.[33] The additional conclusion games for those teams that do not qualify for the in-season tournament, or are eliminated in the quarterfinals, will be announced at a later date.\n\n\n\n### Standings[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Crypto.com Arena, as the team is scheduled move to the new Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California, beginning with the 2024\u201325 season.[42]\n* The Utah Jazz's home arena, known for several years as Vivint Arena, reverted back to its original Delta Center name on July 1, 2023 as the team came to a new naming rights agreement with Delta Airlines.[43]\n* The San Antonio Spurs' home arena, formerly known as AT&T Center, was renamed Frost Bank Center on August 3, 2023.[44][45]\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### National[edit]\n\n\n#### Linear television[edit]\n\n\nThis is the eighth year of a nine-year deal with ABC, ESPN, TNT, and NBA TV.[46] ESPN has Wednesday and Friday night games during most of the regular season, along with selected Sunday games from February to April, and a Monday night doubleheader on March 18.[47] TNT has Tuesday games, and Thursday games during opening week and again from January to April.[48] NBA TV televises games primarily on Mondays all season, Saturday and Sunday nights for most of the season, Thursdays during the first half of the season, Fridays during the second half of the season, and any other time when the other national broadcasters are not airing games.[49] ABC's schedule includes *NBA Saturday Primetime* games on selected Saturdays between December and March (including a tripleheader on January 27), and *NBA Sunday Showcase* games on four selected Sunday afternoons in February and March.[47] On October 2, 2023, it was announced that five January games originally scheduled as part of ESPN's Wednesday doubleheaders would instead air on ABC.[50]\n\n\nFor the NBA in-season tournament, TNT and ESPN will air selected group stage games as part of their regular Tuesday and Friday coverage, respectively. NBA TV will also have two on Friday, November 24.[51] During the knockout stage, TNT will air all four quarterfinals on December 4 and 5. For the semifinals on December 7, ESPN will televise the early game and TNT will have the late game. The championship game on Saturday, December 9 will be on ABC as part of a special *NBA Saturday Primetime*.[52] During these weeks, ESPN and NBA TV will continue to air other regular season games on Wednesdays and other days, including ESPN's coverage of consolation games on December 6 and December 8.[47][53]\n\n\nFive Christmas Day games are scheduled for this season. With Christmas Day falling on a Monday in 2023, the NFL also scheduled a *Monday Night Football* on that day. Because ABC/ESPN holds the broadcast rights to both NBA Christmas games and *Monday Night Football*, it was decided that ESPN will again air all five NBA games, but ABC will only simulcast two of them in favor of exclusively airing the *Monday Night Football* game. This would mark the first time since 2016 that ABC will televise fewer than three NBA Christmas games.[47]\n\n\nFour Martin Luther King Jr. Day games will be televised nationally, with TNT and NBA TV airing two apiece.[2][48][49]\n\n\nOn January 23\u201327, the league will hold \"NBA Rivals Week\" for the second consecutive season, with every nationally televised game featuring \"classic and budding rivalries between teams and players\".[2]\n\n\nOn the final day of the regular season, Sunday, April 14, two games with playoff implications will be flexed into ESPN's afternoon doubleheader.[2][47]\n\n\n\n#### Streaming[edit]\n\n\nThis is the first regular season that the streaming service Max will have live access to TNT's games on its Bleacher Report Sports Add-on tier.[54]\n\n\nNBA League Pass will continue to offer out-of-market games, live access to NBA TV, and on-demand replays of every game.\n\n\n\n### Local[edit]\n\n\nThe Washington Wizards' broadcaster became Monumental Sports Network prior to the start of the season. In September 2022, Ted Leonsis's Monumental Sports & Entertainment bought out NBCUniversal's ownership stake in what was then its Regional Network brand, NBC Sports Washington.[55][56]\n\n\n\n#### Diamond Sports Group bankruptcy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Diamond Sports Group \u00a7\u00a0Bankruptcy\n\nThe 16 NBA teams who had deals with the Bally Sports regional sports networks may be affected by its operator Diamond Sports Group's March 14, 2023, decision to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Diamond had initially sought to continue broadcasting regional games while it plans to separate from majority parent Sinclair Broadcast Group as part of the reorganization.[57]\n\n\nOn April 20, 2023, the Phoenix Suns signed a five-year agreement with Gray Television to replace Bally Sports Arizona as their broadcaster. Most Suns games would then be carried on broadcast television by Gray's KTVK, KPHO-TV, or KPHE-LD in Phoenix (as well as Tucson sister station KOLD-DT5, a new Gray station in Flagstaff, KAZF, and a new Gray station in Yuma, KAZS, with the latter two launching before the season starts). The Suns will also operate an over-the-top subscription service called \"Suns Live\", which is created by Kiswe.[58][59][60] After the announcement, Diamond accused the team of breaching its contract and bankruptcy law, stating that the team was making an \"improper effort\" to \"change their broadcasting partner without permitting Diamond to exercise our contractual rights.\" In response, Phoenix Suns CEO Josh Bartelstein stated that \"Diamond's position is totally inaccurate. We are moving forward with this deal and could not be more excited about what it means for our fans and our future.\"[58][59][61] On May 10, 2023, the bankruptcy judge voided the Suns contract with Gray, ruling that the Suns violated Bally Sports Arizona's contractual right of first refusal. He ordered the parties into arbitration.[62] On July 14, 2023, the deal became official when Diamond declined to match Gray's contract offer, going forward with the intended plan of theirs, only removing CBS 5 from the initial list that included 3TV and Arizona's Family Sports.[63] With Bally Sports later losing airing rights to the Arizona Diamondbacks to the MLB itself and the NHL's Arizona Coyotes to Scripps Sports, Bally Sports Arizona ended up shutting down services on October 21, 2023.\n\n\nOn October 1, 2023, Diamond Sports missed a payment to the Orlando Magic. However, on November 6, 2023, Diamond Sports and the NBA reached a one-year agreement that will result in the contracts for teams airing on Diamond expiring after the 2023\u201324 NBA season, but will result in the Magic being paid in the process. Across the board, all NBA teams airing on Diamond Sports will receive a 16% reduction in the money they receive, but teams will now be able to sell 10 games of their choosing to local over-the-air networks. However, the deal still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy court first.[64][65]\n\n\n\n#### AT&T SportsNet closure[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was winding down its AT&T SportsNet regional sports network business, affecting the Houston Rockets and the Utah Jazz's broadcasters, AT&T SportsNet Southwest and AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain, respectively. The Portland Trail Blazers' deal with Root Sports Northwest is not affected because Warner Bros. Discovery only has minority control of that network.[66][67]\n\n\nOn June 20, 2023, the Jazz reached an agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group owned stations KJZZ-TV and KUTV to become its new television home. Jazz owner Ryan Smith will start a new in-house production division, SEG Media, to produce the telecasts. While all games will air on KJZZ, Sinclair retains the right to carry select telecasts on KUTV, and KUTV will maintain an \"official station\" relationship with the team, allowing more coverage of the Jazz and its players. The deal will also include a streaming service, which will not involve KJZZ-TV.[68] AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain later rebranded itself to just SportsNet Rocky Mountain before shutting down services on October 21, 2023.\n\n\nThe Houston Rockets and the MLB's Houston Astros took over ownership of AT&T SportsNet Southwest, rebranding it as Space City Home Network on October 3, 2023.[69]\n\n\n\n### Personnel[edit]\n\n\nAs part of a wave of layoffs, ESPN released analysts Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy, and replaced them with Doris Burke and Doc Rivers on the lead announce team with Mike Breen.[70]\n\n\nBoston Celtics television announcer Mike Gorman announced his retirement effective after this season.[71] For this season, Gorman is only calling home games, with Drew Carter taking over for preseason and road games. Carter was also announced as Gorman's successor effective next season.[72]\n\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets added Noah Eagle, son of primary television announcer Ian Eagle, to the broadcast team calling select games. The younger Eagle is expected to call around 10 games in lieu of Ian and secondary announcer Ryan Ruocco.[73]\n\n\n\n## Notable occurrences[edit]\n\n\n* On July 25, 2023, Jaylen Brown signed a five-year, $304 million contract extension with the Boston Celtics, the largest and richest in league history.[74]\n* On October 25, 2023, Victor Wembanyama scored three 3-pointers in his regular season debut, the most by a Spurs rookie in a single game.[75]\n* On October 31, 2023, Kevin Durant passed Hakeem Olajuwon for 12th on the league's all-time scoring list.[76]\n* On November 1, 2023, LeBron James scored 35 points in the Los Angeles Lakers' 130\u2013125 overtime victory against the Los Angeles Clippers. His performance marked his 81st 30-point game since turning 35 years old in December 2019, surpassing Karl Malone for the most 30-point games by any player since turning 35 in NBA history.[77]\n* On November 1, 2023, Stephen Curry became the first player in NBA history to score at least one three-pointer in 250 consecutive regular season games.[78]\n* On November 6, 2023, Nikola Joki\u0107 passed LeBron James and Jason Kidd for the 4th place on the NBA all-time triple-double list.[79]\n* For the second consecutive season, the league did not schedule regular season games on Election Day in the United States, which fell on November 7.[2]\n* On November 14, 2023, an altercation occurred during a game between the Golden State Warriors and the Minnesota Timberwolves.[80] As a result of the incident, Draymond Green was suspended for five games.[81] Green was also fined for the same reason, alongside Klay Thompson, Rudy Gobert, and Jaden McDaniels.[82][83]\n* On November 15, 2023, LeBron James passed Jason Kidd for 5th on the all-time triple-doubles list.[84] He also passed Jason Terry for 8th in the career 3-pointers made list.[85] James also became the second-oldest player to record a triple-double, behind only Karl Malone.[86]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Key dates for 2023-24 NBA season\". *NBA.com*.

**^** The Finals MVP Award was first awarded in 1969.\n2. **^** Minneapolis was the Central Division (now defunct, no relation to the current Central Division) playoff champion, while the Anderson Packers were the Western Division playoff champion.[20] Due to the NBA's realignment into three divisions,[21][22] the team with the best regular season record after the Divisional Finals advanced automatically to the NBA Finals, while the other two teams faced off in the NBA Semifinals to determine the other finalist. Eastern Division playoff champion Syracuse had the best regular season record among the division playoff champions, causing Minneapolis to face Anderson in the NBA Semifinals.[20][23]\n3. **^** The trophy was renamed for Walter A. Brown.\n4. **^** The trophy was replaced by a new design.[51][52]\n5. **^** The trophy was renamed for Larry O'Brien.\n6. **^** After a lockout, the season started on February 5, 1999, and all 29 teams played a shortened 50-game regular season schedule.[75]\n7. **^** After a lockout, the season started on December 25, 2011, and all 30 teams played a shortened 66-game regular season schedule.[89][90]\n8. **^** The 2019\u201320 NBA season was delayed and shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic and finished in October 2020 with a bubble tournament.[99]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Rosen, Charley (2008). *The First Tip-Off: The Incredible Story of the Birth of the NBA*.

It is modeled after the WNBA Commissioner's Cup and in-season multi-stage competitions held in European soccer. The tournament is structured as follows:[36][37][38]\n\n\n\n* Six intraconference pools of five.\n* Tuesdays and Fridays during November will feature group games against each of the other teams in their pool (two at home and two on the road). These games will still count as regular season games.\n* The winners of each pool and two wild-card teams will advance to a single-elimination tournament.\n* The semifinals and championship game will be played in Las Vegas.\n* Players for the tournament champion will each receive $500,000.\n* To compensate, the NBA's regular season scheduling formula will be modified so only 80 games for each team are initially announced during the offseason. The first two rounds of the in-season tournament would then count as regular season games 81 and 82. The championship game would then be an extra 83rd game that would not count toward the regular season. Teams that do not qualify for the in-season tournament, or are eliminated in the quarterfinals, would then be scheduled additional games against each other that are eliminated in the same conference (if possible) and round to reach 82 games.\n\n\nThe schedule for the in-season tournament was released on August 15, 2023.[33] The additional conclusion games for those teams that do not qualify for the in-season tournament, or are eliminated in the quarterfinals, will be announced at a later date.\n\n\n\n### Standings[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Crypto.com Arena, as the team is scheduled move to the new Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California, beginning with the 2024\u201325 season.[42]\n* The Utah Jazz's home arena, known for several years as Vivint Arena, reverted back to its original Delta Center name on July 1, 2023 as the team came to a new naming rights agreement with Delta Airlines.[43]\n* The San Antonio Spurs' home arena, formerly known as AT&T Center, was renamed Frost Bank Center on August 3, 2023.[44][45]\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### National[edit]\n\n\n#### Linear television[edit]\n\n\nThis is the eighth year of a nine-year deal with ABC, ESPN, TNT, and NBA TV.[46] ESPN has Wednesday and Friday night games during most of the regular season, along with selected Sunday games from February to April, and a Monday night doubleheader on March 18.[47] TNT has Tuesday games, and Thursday games during opening week and again from January to April.[48] NBA TV televises games primarily on Mondays all season, Saturday and Sunday nights for most of the season, Thursdays during the first half of the season, Fridays during the second half of the season, and any other time when the other national broadcasters are not airing games.[49] ABC's schedule includes *NBA Saturday Primetime* games on selected Saturdays between December and March (including a tripleheader on January 27), and *NBA Sunday Showcase* games on four selected Sunday afternoons in February and March.[47] On October 2, 2023, it was announced that five January games originally scheduled as part of ESPN's Wednesday doubleheaders would instead air on ABC.[50]\n\n\nFor the NBA in-season tournament, TNT and ESPN will air selected group stage games as part of their regular Tuesday and Friday coverage, respectively. NBA TV will also have two on Friday, November 24.[51] During the knockout stage, TNT will air all four quarterfinals on December 4 and 5. For the semifinals on December 7, ESPN will televise the early game and TNT will have the late game. The championship game on Saturday, December 9 will be on ABC as part of a special *NBA Saturday Primetime*.[52] During these weeks, ESPN and NBA TV will continue to air other regular season games on Wednesdays and other days, including ESPN's coverage of consolation games on December 6 and December 8.[47][53]\n\n\nFive Christmas Day games are scheduled for this season. With Christmas Day falling on a Monday in 2023, the NFL also scheduled a *Monday Night Football* on that day. Because ABC/ESPN holds the broadcast rights to both NBA Christmas games and *Monday Night Football*, it was decided that ESPN will again air all five NBA games, but ABC will only simulcast two of them in favor of exclusively airing the *Monday Night Football* game. This would mark the first time since 2016 that ABC will televise fewer than three NBA Christmas games.[47]\n\n\nFour Martin Luther King Jr. Day games will be televised nationally, with TNT and NBA TV airing two apiece.[2][48][49]\n\n\nOn January 23\u201327, the league will hold \"NBA Rivals Week\" for the second consecutive season, with every nationally televised game featuring \"classic and budding rivalries between teams and players\".[2]\n\n\nOn the final day of the regular season, Sunday, April 14, two games with playoff implications will be flexed into ESPN's afternoon doubleheader.[2][47]\n\n\n\n#### Streaming[edit]\n\n\nThis is the first regular season that the streaming service Max will have live access to TNT's games on its Bleacher Report Sports Add-on tier.[54]\n\n\nNBA League Pass will continue to offer out-of-market games, live access to NBA TV, and on-demand replays of every game.\n\n\n\n### Local[edit]\n\n\nThe Washington Wizards' broadcaster became Monumental Sports Network prior to the start of the season. In September 2022, Ted Leonsis's Monumental Sports & Entertainment bought out NBCUniversal's ownership stake in what was then its Regional Network brand, NBC Sports Washington.[55][56]\n\n\n\n#### Diamond Sports Group bankruptcy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Diamond Sports Group \u00a7\u00a0Bankruptcy\n\nThe 16 NBA teams who had deals with the Bally Sports regional sports networks may be affected by its operator Diamond Sports Group's March 14, 2023, decision to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Diamond had initially sought to continue broadcasting regional games while it plans to separate from majority parent Sinclair Broadcast Group as part of the reorganization.[57]\n\n\nOn April 20, 2023, the Phoenix Suns signed a five-year agreement with Gray Television to replace Bally Sports Arizona as their broadcaster. Most Suns games would then be carried on broadcast television by Gray's KTVK, KPHO-TV, or KPHE-LD in Phoenix (as well as Tucson sister station KOLD-DT5, a new Gray station in Flagstaff, KAZF, and a new Gray station in Yuma, KAZS, with the latter two launching before the season starts). The Suns will also operate an over-the-top subscription service called \"Suns Live\", which is created by Kiswe.[58][59][60] After the announcement, Diamond accused the team of breaching its contract and bankruptcy law, stating that the team was making an \"improper effort\" to \"change their broadcasting partner without permitting Diamond to exercise our contractual rights.\" In response, Phoenix Suns CEO Josh Bartelstein stated that \"Diamond's position is totally inaccurate. We are moving forward with this deal and could not be more excited about what it means for our fans and our future.\"[58][59][61] On May 10, 2023, the bankruptcy judge voided the Suns contract with Gray, ruling that the Suns violated Bally Sports Arizona's contractual right of first refusal. He ordered the parties into arbitration.[62] On July 14, 2023, the deal became official when Diamond declined to match Gray's contract offer, going forward with the intended plan of theirs, only removing CBS 5 from the initial list that included 3TV and Arizona's Family Sports.[63] With Bally Sports later losing airing rights to the Arizona Diamondbacks to the MLB itself and the NHL's Arizona Coyotes to Scripps Sports, Bally Sports Arizona ended up shutting down services on October 21, 2023.\n\n\nOn October 1, 2023, Diamond Sports missed a payment to the Orlando Magic. However, on November 6, 2023, Diamond Sports and the NBA reached a one-year agreement that will result in the contracts for teams airing on Diamond expiring after the 2023\u201324 NBA season, but will result in the Magic being paid in the process. Across the board, all NBA teams airing on Diamond Sports will receive a 16% reduction in the money they receive, but teams will now be able to sell 10 games of their choosing to local over-the-air networks. However, the deal still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy court first.[64][65]\n\n\n\n#### AT&T SportsNet closure[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was winding down its AT&T SportsNet regional sports network business, affecting the Houston Rockets and the Utah Jazz's broadcasters, AT&T SportsNet Southwest and AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain, respectively. The Portland Trail Blazers' deal with Root Sports Northwest is not affected because Warner Bros. Discovery only has minority control of that network.[66][67]\n\n\nOn June 20, 2023, the Jazz reached an agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group owned stations KJZZ-TV and KUTV to become its new television home. Jazz owner Ryan Smith will start a new in-house production division, SEG Media, to produce the telecasts. While all games will air on KJZZ, Sinclair retains the right to carry select telecasts on KUTV, and KUTV will maintain an \"official station\" relationship with the team, allowing more coverage of the Jazz and its players. The deal will also include a streaming service, which will not involve KJZZ-TV.[68] AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain later rebranded itself to just SportsNet Rocky Mountain before shutting down services on October 21, 2023.\n\n\nThe Houston Rockets and the MLB's Houston Astros took over ownership of AT&T SportsNet Southwest, rebranding it as Space City Home Network on October 3, 2023.[69]\n\n\n\n### Personnel[edit]\n\n\nAs part of a wave of layoffs, ESPN released analysts Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy, and replaced them with Doris Burke and Doc Rivers on the lead announce team with Mike Breen.[70]\n\n\nBoston Celtics television announcer Mike Gorman announced his retirement effective after this season.[71] For this season, Gorman is only calling home games, with Drew Carter taking over for preseason and road games. Carter was also announced as Gorman's successor effective next season.[72]\n\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets added Noah Eagle, son of primary television announcer Ian Eagle, to the broadcast team calling select games. The younger Eagle is expected to call around 10 games in lieu of Ian and secondary announcer Ryan Ruocco.[73]\n\n\n\n## Notable occurrences[edit]\n\n\n* On July 25, 2023, Jaylen Brown signed a five-year, $304 million contract extension with the Boston Celtics, the largest and richest in league history.[74]\n* On October 25, 2023, Victor Wembanyama scored three 3-pointers in his regular season debut, the most by a Spurs rookie in a single game.[75]\n* On October 31, 2023, Kevin Durant passed Hakeem Olajuwon for 12th on the league's all-time scoring list.[76]\n* On November 1, 2023, LeBron James scored 35 points in the Los Angeles Lakers' 130\u2013125 overtime victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
