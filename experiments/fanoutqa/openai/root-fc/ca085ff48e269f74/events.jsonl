Roosevelt4,422 days(1933–1945)\n | ![](image)Shortest presidency:William Henry Harrison31 days(1841)\n |\n\n\nThis is a **list of presidents of the United States by time in office**. The listed number of days is calculated as the *difference between dates*, which counts the number of *calendar days* except the last day. The length of a full four-year presidential term of office usually amounts to 1,461 days (three common years of 365 days plus one leap year of 366 days). If the last day is included, all numbers would be one day more, except Grover Cleveland would have two more days, as he served two non-consecutive terms.[a]\n\n\nOf the individuals elected president of the United States, four died of natural causes while in office (William Henry Harrison,[1] Zachary Taylor,[2] Warren G. Harding[3] and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln,[4] James A. Garfield,[4][5] William McKinley[6] and John F. Kennedy) and one resigned from office (Richard Nixon).[7]\n\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison spent the shortest time in office, while Franklin D. Roosevelt spent the longest. Roosevelt is the only American president to have served more than two terms. Following ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment in 1951, presidents—beginning with Dwight D. Eisenhower—have been ineligible for election to a third term or, after serving more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected president, to a second term. The amendment contained a grandfather clause that explicitly exempted the incumbent president, then Harry S. Truman, from the new term limitations.\n\n\nGrover Cleveland is the only president to leave office and return for a second non-consecutive term. Consequently, while there have been 46 presidencies in the nation's history, only 45 people have been sworn into office as Cleveland is numbered as both the 22nd and 24th president.\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents by time in office[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Rank | President | Length*in days* | Order of presidency | Number of terms\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Franklin D.

The years 1800 and 1900 are divisible by 100, but not by 400. John Adams's term and William McKinley's first term did not include a 366-day leap year, so those terms were one day shorter than a normal full term. 2000, being divisible by 400, had 366 days, thus Bill Clinton's second term was not shorter than his first.\n2. **^** The Twentieth Amendment (ratified in 1933) moved Inauguration Day from March 4 to January 20. The 1937 presidential inauguration was the first to take place on the new date. As a result, Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term in office (1933–1937) was only 1,418 days long, 1 month and 12 days shorter than a normal term.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** Died in office\n4. **^** Did not seek re-election in 1876.

The years 1800 and 1900 are divisible by 100, but not by 400. John Adams's term and William McKinley's first term did not include a 366-day leap year, so those terms were one day shorter than a normal full term. 2000, being divisible by 400, had 366 days, thus Bill Clinton's second term was not shorter than his first.\n2. **^** The Twentieth Amendment (ratified in 1933) moved Inauguration Day from March 4 to January 20. The 1937 presidential inauguration was the first to take place on the new date. As a result, Franklin D.

The first president, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College.[4] Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is therefore counted as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, giving rise to the discrepancy between the number of presidencies and the number of individuals who have served as president.[5] The incumbent president is Joe Biden.[6]\n\n\nThe presidency of William Henry Harrison, who died 31 days after taking office in 1841, was the shortest in American history.[7] Franklin D. Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms.[8] Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.[9]\n\n\nFour presidents died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon, facing impeachment and removal from office).[10] John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, and set the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with his presidency.[11]\n\n\nThroughout most of its history, American politics has been dominated by political parties. The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, no organized parties existed. Soon after the 1st Congress convened, political factions began rallying around dominant Washington administration officials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson.[12] Concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never affiliated with a political party.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of presidents of the United States from 1789 – till date.\n| No.[a] | Portrait\n | Name(Birth–Death) | Term[14] | Party[b][15] | Election\n | Vice President[16] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![Painting of George Washington](image) | **George Washington**(1732–1799)[17] | April 30, 1789–March 4, 1797 |  | *Unaffiliated* | 1788–1789\n\n\n---\n\n\n1792\n | John Adams[c] |\n| 2 | ![Painting of John Adams](image) | **John Adams**(1735–1826)[19] | March 4, 1797–March 4, 1801 |  | Federalist | 1796 | Thomas Jefferson[d] |\n| 3 | ![Painting of Thomas Jefferson](image) | **Thomas Jefferson**(1743–1826)[21] | March 4, 1801–March 4, 1809 |  | Democratic-Republican | 1800\n\n\n---\n\n\n1804\n | Aaron Burr\n\n\n---\n\n\nGeorge Clinton\n |\n| 4 | ![Painting of James Madison](image) | **James Madison**(1751–1836)[22] | March 4, 1809–March 4, 1817 |  | Democratic-Republican | 1808\n\n\n---\n\n\n1812\n | George Clinton[e]\n\n\n---\n\n\n*Vacant afterApril 20, 1812*\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nElbridge Gerry[e]\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n*Vacant afterNovember 23, 1814*\n |\n| 5 | ![Painting of James Monroe](image) | **James Monroe**(1758–1831)[24] | March 4, 1817–March 4, 1825 |  | Democratic-Republican | 1816\n\n\n---\n\n\n1820\n | Daniel D.

For example, George Washington served two consecutive terms and is counted as the first president (not the first and second). Upon the resignation of 37th president, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford became the 38th president even though he simply served out the remainder of Nixon's second term and was never elected to the presidency in his own right. Grover Cleveland was both the 22nd president and the 24th president because his two terms were not consecutive. A vice president who temporarily becomes acting president under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution is not counted, because the president remains in office during such a period.\n2. **^** Reflects the president's political party at the start of their presidency. Changes during their time in office are noted. Also reflects the vice president's political party unless otherwise noted beside the individual's name.\n3. **^** Political parties had not been anticipated when the Constitution was drafted, nor did they exist at the time of the first presidential election in 1788–89. When they did develop, during Washington's first term, Adams joined the faction that became the Federalist Party. The elections of 1792 were the first ones in the United States that were contested on anything resembling a partisan basis.[18]\n4. **^** The 1796 presidential election was the first contested American presidential election and the only one in which a president and vice president were elected from opposing political parties. Federalist John Adams was elected president, and Jefferson of the Democratic-Republicans was elected vice president.[20]\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** Died in office[23]\n6. **^** Early during John Quincy Adams' term, the Democratic-Republican Party dissolved; his allies in Congress and at the state level were referred to as \"Adams' Men\" during the Adams presidency. When Andrew Jackson became president in 1829, this group became the \"Anti-Jackson\" opposition, and organized themselves as the National Republican Party.[26]\n7. **^** John Calhoun, formerly a Democratic-Republican, founded the Nullifier Party in 1828 to oppose the Tariff of 1828 and advance the cause of states' rights, but was brought on as Andrew Jackson's running mate in the 1828 presidential election in an effort to broaden the democratic coalition led by Jackson.[27]\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Resigned from office[23]\n9. **^** John Tyler succeeded to the presidency upon the death of William Henry Harrison.[32]\n10. **^** John Tyler was elected vice president on the Whig Party ticket in 1840. His policy priorities as president soon proved to be opposed to most of the Whig agenda, and he was expelled from the party five months after assuming office.[33]\n11. **^** Millard Fillmore succeeded to the presidency upon the death of Zachary Taylor.[37]\n12. **^** When he ran for reelection in 1864, Republican Abraham Lincoln formed a bipartisan electoral alliance with War Democrats by selecting Democrat Andrew Johnson as his running mate, and running on the National Union Party ticket.[41]\n13. **^** Andrew Johnson succeeded to the presidency upon the death of Abraham Lincoln.[42]\n14. **^** While president, Andrew Johnson tried and failed to build a party of loyalists under the National Union banner. Near the end of his presidency, Johnson rejoined the Democratic Party.[42]\n15. **^** Chester A. Arthur succeeded to the presidency upon the death of James A. Garfield.[47]\n16. **^** Theodore Roosevelt succeeded to the presidency upon the death of William McKinley.[52]\n17. **^** Calvin Coolidge succeeded to the presidency upon the death of Warren G. Harding.[57]\n18. **^** Harry S. Truman succeeded to the presidency upon the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt.[61]\n19. **^** Lyndon B. Johnson succeeded to the presidency upon the death of John F. Kennedy.[65]\n20. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Appointed as vice president under terms of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Section 2[23]\n21. **^** Gerald Ford succeeded to the presidency upon the resignation of Richard Nixon.[67]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Rossiter (1962), p. 86.\n2. **^** Shugart (2004), pp. 633–636.\n3. **^** Epstein (2005), p. 318.\n4. **^** Matuz (2001), p. xxii.\n5. **^** Schaller & Williams (2003), p. 192.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** whitehouse.gov (g).\n7. **^** McHugh & Mackowiak (2014), pp. 990–995.\n8. **^** Skau (1974), pp. 246–275.\n9. **^** Peabody & Gant (1999), p. 565.\n10. **^** Abbott (2005), pp. 627–644.\n11. **^** Dinnerstein (1962), pp. 447–451.\n12. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), p. 197; Nardulli (1992), p. 179.\n13. **^** LOC (2); Jamison (2014).\n14. **^** LOC; whitehouse.gov.\n15. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), pp. 257–258.\n16. **^** LOC.\n17. **^** McDonald (2000).\n18. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), pp. 197, 272; Nardulli (1992), p. 179.\n19. **^** Pencak (2000).\n20. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), p. 274.\n21. **^** Peterson (2000).\n22. **^** Banning (2000).\n23. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Neale (2004), p. 22.\n24. **^** Ammon (2000).\n25. **^** Hargreaves (2000).\n26. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), p. 228; Goldman (1951), p. 159.\n27. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), p. 892; Houpt (2010), pp. 26, 280.\n28. **^** Remini (2000).\n29. **^** Cole (2000).\n30. **^** Gutzman (2000).\n31. **^** Shade (2000).\n32. **^** Abbott (2013), p. 23.\n33. **^** Cash (2018), pp. 34–36.\n34. **^** Rawley (2000).\n35. **^** Smith (2000).\n36. **^** Anbinder (2000).\n37. **^** Abbott (2005), p. 639.\n38. **^** Gara (2000).\n39. **^** Gienapp (2000).\n40. **^** McPherson (b) (2000).\n41. **^** McSeveney (1986), p. 139.\n42. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Trefousse (2000).\n43. **^** McPherson (a) (2000).\n44. **^** Hoogenboom (2000).\n45. **^** Peskin (2000).\n46. **^** Reeves (2000).\n47. **^** Greenberger (2017), pp. 174–175.\n48. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Campbell (2000).\n49. **^** Spetter (2000).\n50. **^** Gould (a) (2000).\n51. **^** Harbaugh (2000).\n52. **^** Abbott (2005), pp. 639–640.\n53. **^** Gould (b) (2000).\n54. **^** Ambrosius (2000).\n55. **^** Hawley (2000).\n56. **^** McCoy (2000).\n57. **^** Senate.\n58. **^** Hoff (a) (2000).\n59. **^** Brinkley (2000).\n60. **^** Hamby (2000).\n61. **^** Abbott (2005), p. 636.\n62. **^** Ambrose (2000).\n63. **^** Parmet (2000).\n64. **^** Gardner (2000).\n65. **^** Abbott (2005), p. 633.\n66. **^** Hoff (b) (2000).\n67. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Greene (2013).\n68. **^** whitehouse.gov (a).\n69. **^** Schaller (2004).\n70. **^** whitehouse.gov (b).\n71. **^** whitehouse.gov (c).\n72. **^** whitehouse.gov (d).\n73. **^** whitehouse.gov (e).\n74. **^** whitehouse.gov (f).\n\n## Works cited[edit]\n\n\n**General**\n\n\n\n* *Guide to U.S. Elections*.

The first president, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College.[4] Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is therefore counted as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, giving rise to the discrepancy between the number of presidencies and the number of individuals who have served as president.[5] The incumbent president is Joe Biden.[6]\n\n\nThe presidency of William Henry Harrison, who died 31 days after taking office in 1841, was the shortest in American history.[7] Franklin D. Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms.[8] Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.[9]\n\n\nFour presidents died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon, facing impeachment and removal from office).[10] John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, and set the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with his presidency.[11]\n\n\nThroughout most of its history, American politics has been dominated by political parties. The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, no organized parties existed. Soon after the 1st Congress convened, political factions began rallying around dominant Washington administration officials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson.[12] Concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never affiliated with a political party.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of presidents of the United States from 1789 – till date.\n| No.[a] | Portrait\n | Name(Birth–Death) | Term[14] | Party[b][15] | Election\n | Vice President[16] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![Painting of George Washington](image) | **George Washington**(1732–1799)[17] | April 30, 1789–March 4, 1797 |  | *Unaffiliated* | 1788–1789\n\n\n---\n\n\n1792\n | John Adams[c] |\n| 2 | ![Painting of John Adams](image) | **John Adams**(1735–1826)[19] | March 4, 1797–March 4, 1801 |  | Federalist | 1796 | Thomas Jefferson[d] |\n| 3 | ![Painting of Thomas Jefferson](image) | **Thomas Jefferson**(1743–1826)[21] | March 4, 1801–March 4, 1809 |  | Democratic-Republican | 1800\n\n\n---\n\n\n1804\n | Aaron Burr\n\n\n---\n\n\nGeorge Clinton\n |\n| 4 | ![Painting of James Madison](image) | **James Madison**(1751–1836)[22] | March 4, 1809–March 4, 1817 |  | Democratic-Republican | 1808\n\n\n---\n\n\n1812\n | George Clinton[e]\n\n\n---\n\n\n*Vacant afterApril 20, 1812*\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nElbridge Gerry[e]\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n*Vacant afterNovember 23, 1814*\n |\n| 5 | ![Painting of James Monroe](image) | **James Monroe**(1758–1831)[24] | March 4, 1817–March 4, 1825 |  | Democratic-Republican | 1816\n\n\n---\n\n\n1820\n | Daniel D.

For example, George Washington served two consecutive terms and is counted as the first president (not the first and second). Upon the resignation of 37th president, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford became the 38th president even though he simply served out the remainder of Nixon's second term and was never elected to the presidency in his own right. Grover Cleveland was both the 22nd president and the 24th president because his two terms were not consecutive. A vice president who temporarily becomes acting president under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution is not counted, because the president remains in office during such a period.\n2. **^** Reflects the president's political party at the start of their presidency. Changes during their time in office are noted. Also reflects the vice president's political party unless otherwise noted beside the individual's name.\n3. **^** Political parties had not been anticipated when the Constitution was drafted, nor did they exist at the time of the first presidential election in 1788–89. When they did develop, during Washington's first term, Adams joined the faction that became the Federalist Party. The elections of 1792 were the first ones in the United States that were contested on anything resembling a partisan basis.[18]\n4. **^** The 1796 presidential election was the first contested American presidential election and the only one in which a president and vice president were elected from opposing political parties. Federalist John Adams was elected president, and Jefferson of the Democratic-Republicans was elected vice president.[20]\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** Died in office[23]\n6. **^** Early during John Quincy Adams' term, the Democratic-Republican Party dissolved; his allies in Congress and at the state level were referred to as \"Adams' Men\" during the Adams presidency. When Andrew Jackson became president in 1829, this group became the \"Anti-Jackson\" opposition, and organized themselves as the National Republican Party.[26]\n7. **^** John Calhoun, formerly a Democratic-Republican, founded the Nullifier Party in 1828 to oppose the Tariff of 1828 and advance the cause of states' rights, but was brought on as Andrew Jackson's running mate in the 1828 presidential election in an effort to broaden the democratic coalition led by Jackson.[27]\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Resigned from office[23]\n9. **^** John Tyler succeeded to the presidency upon the death of William Henry Harrison.[32]\n10. **^** John Tyler was elected vice president on the Whig Party ticket in 1840. His policy priorities as president soon proved to be opposed to most of the Whig agenda, and he was expelled from the party five months after assuming office.[33]\n11. **^** Millard Fillmore succeeded to the presidency upon the death of Zachary Taylor.[37]\n12. **^** When he ran for reelection in 1864, Republican Abraham Lincoln formed a bipartisan electoral alliance with War Democrats by selecting Democrat Andrew Johnson as his running mate, and running on the National Union Party ticket.[41]\n13. **^** Andrew Johnson succeeded to the presidency upon the death of Abraham Lincoln.[42]\n14. **^** While president, Andrew Johnson tried and failed to build a party of loyalists under the National Union banner. Near the end of his presidency, Johnson rejoined the Democratic Party.[42]\n15. **^** Chester A. Arthur succeeded to the presidency upon the death of James A. Garfield.[47]\n16. **^** Theodore Roosevelt succeeded to the presidency upon the death of William McKinley.[52]\n17. **^** Calvin Coolidge succeeded to the presidency upon the death of Warren G. Harding.[57]\n18. **^** Harry S. Truman succeeded to the presidency upon the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt.[61]\n19. **^** Lyndon B. Johnson succeeded to the presidency upon the death of John F. Kennedy.[65]\n20. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Appointed as vice president under terms of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Section 2[23]\n21. **^** Gerald Ford succeeded to the presidency upon the resignation of Richard Nixon.[67]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Rossiter (1962), p. 86.\n2. **^** Shugart (2004), pp. 633–636.\n3. **^** Epstein (2005), p. 318.\n4. **^** Matuz (2001), p. xxii.\n5. **^** Schaller & Williams (2003), p. 192.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** whitehouse.gov (g).\n7. **^** McHugh & Mackowiak (2014), pp. 990–995.\n8. **^** Skau (1974), pp. 246–275.\n9. **^** Peabody & Gant (1999), p. 565.\n10. **^** Abbott (2005), pp. 627–644.\n11. **^** Dinnerstein (1962), pp. 447–451.\n12. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), p. 197; Nardulli (1992), p. 179.\n13. **^** LOC (2); Jamison (2014).\n14. **^** LOC; whitehouse.gov.\n15. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), pp. 257–258.\n16. **^** LOC.\n17. **^** McDonald (2000).\n18. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), pp. 197, 272; Nardulli (1992), p. 179.\n19. **^** Pencak (2000).\n20. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), p. 274.\n21. **^** Peterson (2000).\n22. **^** Banning (2000).\n23. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Neale (2004), p. 22.\n24. **^** Ammon (2000).\n25. **^** Hargreaves (2000).\n26. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), p. 228; Goldman (1951), p. 159.\n27. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), p. 892; Houpt (2010), pp. 26, 280.\n28. **^** Remini (2000).\n29. **^** Cole (2000).\n30. **^** Gutzman (2000).\n31. **^** Shade (2000).\n32. **^** Abbott (2013), p. 23.\n33. **^** Cash (2018), pp. 34–36.\n34. **^** Rawley (2000).\n35. **^** Smith (2000).\n36. **^** Anbinder (2000).\n37. **^** Abbott (2005), p. 639.\n38. **^** Gara (2000).\n39. **^** Gienapp (2000).\n40. **^** McPherson (b) (2000).\n41. **^** McSeveney (1986), p. 139.\n42. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Trefousse (2000).\n43. **^** McPherson (a) (2000).\n44. **^** Hoogenboom (2000).\n45. **^** Peskin (2000).\n46. **^** Reeves (2000).\n47. **^** Greenberger (2017), pp. 174–175.\n48. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Campbell (2000).\n49. **^** Spetter (2000).\n50. **^** Gould (a) (2000).\n51. **^** Harbaugh (2000).\n52. **^** Abbott (2005), pp. 639–640.\n53. **^** Gould (b) (2000).\n54. **^** Ambrosius (2000).\n55. **^** Hawley (2000).\n56. **^** McCoy (2000).\n57. **^** Senate.\n58. **^** Hoff (a) (2000).\n59. **^** Brinkley (2000).\n60. **^** Hamby (2000).\n61. **^** Abbott (2005), p. 636.\n62. **^** Ambrose (2000).\n63. **^** Parmet (2000).\n64. **^** Gardner (2000).\n65. **^** Abbott (2005), p. 633.\n66. **^** Hoff (b) (2000).\n67. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Greene (2013).\n68. **^** whitehouse.gov (a).\n69. **^** Schaller (2004).\n70. **^** whitehouse.gov (b).\n71. **^** whitehouse.gov (c).\n72. **^** whitehouse.gov (d).\n73. **^** whitehouse.gov (e).\n74. **^** whitehouse.gov (f).\n\n## Works cited[edit]\n\n\n**General**\n\n\n\n* *Guide to U.S. Elections*.
