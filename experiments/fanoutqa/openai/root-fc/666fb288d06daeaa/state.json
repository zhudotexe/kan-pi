The series centers on Raven Baxter (Raven-Symon\u00e9), a teenager with hidden psychic abilities. Episodes show Raven experiencing visions of future events; she must also deal with the social and personal issues of her youth. Raven often misinterprets the events she foresees, and intervenes to prevent a vision from coming true or to protect her friends and families. She uses her skills in fashion design to create elaborate disguises she wears during these schemes. Raven's secret is shared with her best friends Eddie Thomas (Orlando Brown) and Chelsea Daniels (Anneliese van der Pol), along with her brother Cory (Kyle Massey) and parents Tanya (T'Keyah Crystal Keym\u00e1h) and Victor (Rondell Sheridan). The series explores supernatural elements, family, friendship, and adolescence.\n\n\nThe Walt Disney Company created the series as its television network's first multi-camera sitcom after the success of its earlier single-camera comedy series such as *Even Stevens* and *Lizzie McGuire*, the former of which executive producers David Brookwell and Sean McNamara concurrently worked on. Their joint company Brookwell McNamara Entertainment produced *That's So Raven*, which premiered on January 17, 2003. The series concluded on November 10, 2007, after becoming the first program on the network to reach 100 episodes, and ended because the actors were aging beyond the show's target teenage demographic. All four seasons of the show have been distributed through digital download and on the streaming service Disney+.\n\n\n*That's So Raven* enjoyed high viewership on broadcast television in the United States, and gave rise to the development of merchandise, soundtrack albums, and video game adaptations. Television critics praised Raven-Symon\u00e9 for her physical comedy in what is considered her breakthrough role. The series received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Children's Program in 2005 and 2007. A spin-off entitled *Cory in the House*, which stars Massey and Sheridan, aired on Disney Channel for two seasons from 2007 to 2008. Raven-Symon\u00e9, van der Pol, Sheridan and Keym\u00e1h reprised their roles for the spin-off *Raven's Home*, which premiered in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\n![A mid shot of a woman with mid-length brown hair, wearing a black, translucent dress. She is posing at a press event and smiling, looking away from the camera. Behind her is the corner of a brick wall.](image)Raven-Symon\u00e9, pictured in 2010, serves as the program's central focus during its four-season run.\nRaven Baxter is a high-school student who has a secret psychic ability that allows her to experience short visions of future events. Often, she finds herself misinterpreting the events she sees, resulting in trouble for herself, her friends and family.[1] Raven keeps her supernatural ability a secret; only her close friends and family are aware of it. Raven attends school alongside her best friends Chelsea, who is described as \"ditzy\", and is an environmentalist and an artist; and Eddie, who is an aspiring rapper, is athletic and plays on the school basketball team. Raven lives with her younger brother Cory, an aspiring businessperson, and her parents Victor and Tanya. Victor initially works in a restaurant as a chef, and in the second season he opens his own restaurant called \"The Chill Grill\". Tanya halted her studies to raise her family but decided to continue studying law once her children were older; after the third season, she leaves the family to study in England. Raven is an aspiring fashion designer who frequently creates costumes to disguise her identity; she often implements schemes to rectify a situation or her own mistakes.[2] In the fourth season, the show's format is slightly revised; Raven works as an intern for the famous fashion designer Donna Cabonna.[3][4]\n\n\nThe series explores the fantasy of wanting a supernatural power children may experience.[5] It shares similarities with series such as *Sabrina the Teenage Witch* and other fantasy television programs in which adolescents experience and learn to deal with miraculous abilities.[2] Disney Channel president Rich Ross stated Raven's powers are not \"dark\" but rather a metaphorical representation of the unpredictability of future events.[6] The series does not explore the origin or discovery of Raven's powers; however, her grandmother Vivian also has psychic powers.[7] Raven often intervenes in situations to prevent a vision from coming true but she does not regularly try to control her ability or take advantage of it. Her visions often represent a self-fulfilling prophecy. Many of the program's stories take place in the high-school setting.[2]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 2000s, The Walt Disney Company's pay television network Disney Channel experienced success with single-camera comedy series *Even Stevens* and *Lizzie McGuire*, and others that were also aimed at a pre-adolescent audience.[6] *That's So Raven* was intended to appeal to a family audience while having a female character in the comedy lead role.[6][8] Michael Poryes and Susan Sherman created the series.[1][6] Sherman first conceived the idea of a buddy comedy for a pre-adolescent audience, and she and Poryes decided to base it around the idea of being able to see the future, which they thought would interest young viewers.[5] The creators pitched the concept to network executives under the working title *The Future is On Me* and later as *Absolutely Psychic*.[5][2][8] Poryes said at her audition, Raven-Symon\u00e9 read for the role of the lead character and for the comedic best-friend character Chelsea, and that she wanted to play Chelsea.[5] Subsequently, a pilot episode in which she starred as the best friend rather than in the central role was filmed but after the test audience responded well to her and producers were impressed, the program was re-written with Raven-Symon\u00e9 in the main role.[5] Test audiences also responded favorably to the show's supernatural premise and its comedy.[6] The series was also retitled *That's So Raven*.[5] Poryes also served as an executive producer alongside David Brookwell and Sean McNamara, who concurrently produced *Even Stevens* for Disney Channel.[9] Their joint company, Brookwell McNamara Entertainment produced the program in association with the network.[1] *That's So Raven* became Disney Channel's first multi-camera sitcom.[10] The series is centered on an African American family in a deliberate attempt to represent the diversity of the network's audience.[6]\n\n\n*That's So Raven* and Raven-Symon\u00e9's involvement as the titular character Raven were announced in a press release in November 2001. Twenty-one episodes were ordered for the first season, which began filming in Los Angeles, California, in the same month.[1] The series was initially expected to premiere in early 2002 but the whole first season was filmed before it aired on television.[11] The premiere broadcast of *That's So Raven*, which included the first four episodes of the series, occurred on Friday, January 17, 2003.[6][12]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cast members (L-R, above): Kyle Massey, T'Keyah Crystal Keym\u00e1h, Rondell Sheridan, (below): Orlando Brown, Raven-Symon\u00e9 and Anneliese van der Pol.\nThe program and its primary cast were announced in November 2001; Raven-Symon\u00e9 was revealed to be portraying the titular character Raven; she had previously worked as a child actor on the NBC sitcom *The Cosby Show*.[1] Raven-Symon\u00e9 was reported to be Disney's first African American female star,[13] and the first African American woman to have her name in the title of a comedy series at the network.[10] Joshua Alston of *The A.V. Club* called Raven-Symon\u00e9's role on the show her \"most successful phase\" and praised her physical comedy.[2] Marsh cited her humor and commitment to comedy as a reason for her success.[14] She is credited as \"Raven\" throughout the series.[2]\n\n\nThe supporting cast was also first announced in November 2001.[1] Orlando Brown portrays Raven's close friend Eddie and Anneliese van der Pol plays Chelsea, another of Raven's friends.[2] Tricia Dixon was originally listed in the casting announcement before van der Pol joined the cast.[1] Kyle Massey portrays Raven's younger brother, Cory. Rondell Sheridan portrays Raven's father, Victor.[2]\n\n\nT'Keyah Crystal Keym\u00e1h plays Raven's mother Tanya for the first three seasons; she left the show because she had initially expected to only work on three seasons[11] and because she was required to provide full-time care for her ailing grandmother.[11] Within the show's storyline, it is explained Tanya has traveled to England to pursue higher education.[2]\n\n\nGuest stars in the series include Jenifer Lewis as Raven's grandmother Vivian[7] and Anne-Marie Johnson as famous fashion designer Donna Cabonna in the show's fourth season.[3]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nPoryes believed it was important to write the scripts with honesty rather than talking down to the young audience.[5] The writers endeavored to present meaningful stories to children, including lessons about friendship, but tried not to make the messages too \"preachy\".[5] The series was written to reflect life as a typical teenager while also incorporating comedy, particularly through its central focus on physical humor.[5][6] Van der Pol said the actors typically were not permitted to deviate from their scripted lines;[15] however, Ross stated Raven-Symon\u00e9 would improvise \"comic bits\".[6] Alston described the show's nature as \"goofy\" with a \"kid-friendly\" comedy style, but also noted its complex stories revolving around \"ethical challenges\". The episodes did not typically air in the order of their production due to the lack of serialization in their stories.[2]\n\n\n\n### Filming and conclusion[edit]\n\n\n*That's So Raven* was recorded in front of a live studio audience in a set on a sound stage in Los Angeles.[5] Filming of the first season began in November 2001. The series was filmed on two days each week and the child actors attended school on set.[6] Prior to filming, the weekly schedule would also consist of script read-throughs, rewrites and rehearsals.[1] A stunt coordinator was present for Raven-Symon\u00e9's slapstick and physical stunts.[6]\n\n\nThe series was renewed for a second season in April 2003.[16] Prior to the renewal, a musical episode of *Even Stevens* was aired in 2002; its success among the show's audience led network executives to ask Brookwell and McNamara to also produce a musical episode of *That's So Raven*.[9] The musical episode of *That's So Raven*, entitled \"The Road to Audition\", was aired as part of the second season in July 2004.[17] The success of the musical format on both *Even Stevens* and *That's So Raven* gave executives confidence in the appeal and interest of the musical genre, and inspired the development of the television film *High School Musical*.[9]\n\n\nWhile it was originally planned for a maximum of three seasons,[11] in June 2005, *That's So Raven* was renewed for a fourth season, which would consist of 22 episodes and bring the program's total number of episodes to 100.[18][19] The announcement marked the first time an original Disney Channel series would exceed three seasons and the first to reach 100 episodes for syndication.[2][19][i] A film adaptation was also ordered to debut in 2007.[19] Ross called *That's So Raven* the network's \"most successful series\".[19] Production on the season was expected to begin in July and the episodes would be aired over the following two years.[19] Raven-Symon\u00e9 became a producer on the show's fourth season at the age of 19;[19] her roles included having input toward casting, scripts and special effects; however, she rejected the offer to direct an episode.[8] Brookwell and McNamara departed the series at the end of the third season when their company was replaced with Warren & Rinsler Productions. An episode of the series was aired as part of the network crossover special *That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana*, which was aired in July 2006 as a crossover of *The Suite Life of Zack & Cody* and *Hannah Montana*.[20]\n\n\nProduction of the series finished in January 2006,[21] and by August, president of Disney Channels Worldwide Gary Marsh stated it was unlikely any further episodes would be produced.[14] Due to the heavy focus on high-school stories in the series, the network decided to end the show once the characters were beginning to age beyond their teenage years.[2]\n\n\n\n## Episodes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *That's So Raven* episodes\n\n| Season | Episodes | Originally aired |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| First aired | Last aired |\n| 1 | 21 | January\u00a017,\u00a02003\u00a0(2003-01-17) | March\u00a05,\u00a02004\u00a0(2004-03-05) |\n| 2 | 22 | October\u00a03,\u00a02003\u00a0(2003-10-03) | September\u00a024,\u00a02004\u00a0(2004-09-24) |\n| 3 | 35 | October\u00a01,\u00a02004\u00a0(2004-10-01) | January\u00a016,\u00a02006\u00a0(2006-01-16) |\n| 4 | 22 | February\u00a020,\u00a02006\u00a0(2006-02-20) | November\u00a010,\u00a02007\u00a0(2007-11-10) |\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n*That's So Raven* was reported to be the highest-rating original program in Disney Channel's history, a record previously held by *Lizzie McGuire*.[22] The program's success led to two Primetime Emmy Awards nominations for Outstanding Children's Program, in 2005 and 2007. Alston said the success of *That's So Raven* led to Disney Channel changing its approach to original programming. He praised the chemistry between Raven-Symon\u00e9, Brown and van der Pol, which he attributed to their real-life friendships. Alston cited the episodes \"A Goat's Tale\" and \"Out of Control\" as the ones that best represent this dynamic. Raven-Symon\u00e9 was widely recognized for her charisma and physical comedy in the series; Massey's \"knack\" for physical comedy was also praised.[2][23]\n\n\nJack Seiley from *DVDizzy.com* said the series adheres to the format of the network's earlier sitcoms such as *Lizzie McGuire* but does so with lower quality; he called it their worst show.[24] Aaron Wallace also called the show \"weaker\" than *Lizzie McGuire* in a similar DVD review.[23] Seiley criticized the show's concept and the cast's \"over-acting\".[24] According to Wallace, the structure of the episodes is repetitive and rigid.[4][23]\n\n\n\n### Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of awards and nominations received by *That's So Raven*\n| Award\n | Year\n | Recipient(s) and nominee(s)\n | Category\n | Result\n

media[edit]\n\n\n### Merchandising[edit]\n\n\n\n*That's So Raven* became a successful merchandising franchise during its run; the show's merchandise includes a series of novels, dolls, board games, lunch boxes, jewelry, a fragrance and a clothing range.[8] A line of video games was also developed;[2] two games were released on the Game Boy Advance and *That's So Raven: Psychic on the Scene* was released on the Nintendo DS on November 2, 2006.[58] Soundtrack albums *That's So Raven* (2004) and *That's So Raven Too!* (2006) feature recordings by some of the cast and guest performers.[59][60] By 2006, merchandise based on the series had grossed over $400 million.[61]\n\n\n\n### Spin-offs and adaptations[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cory in the House, Raven's Home, and Palak Pe Jhalak\n\nIn 2005, Disney ordered a film adaptation of *That's So Raven* alongside the program's fourth-season renewal, which was planned for a 2007 release.[19] Van der Pol said in 2010 a script for the film had been written but that Raven-Symon\u00e9 was too busy to be involved at the time of development.[15] The plot would have depicted Raven starting a fashion line with Eddie and Chelsea in France.[15] The film did not enter production.[15]\n\n\nThe network ordered a spin-off series entitled *Cory in the House* starring Massey and Sheridan in May 2006; this was the first time Disney Channel had developed a spin-off of an original series.[14][62] The series depicts Cory and Victor moving to Washington, D.C., to live in the White House, where Victor begins work as the personal chef of a fictional President of the United States.[62] The series aired for two seasons from 2007 to 2008.[62] Another spin-off, which is entitled *Raven's Home*, was first reported in October 2016; Raven-Symon\u00e9 and van der Pol were both revealed to be reprising their roles as Raven and Chelsea, respectively.[10][21][63] The series follows Raven as a divorced mother of children Booker, who has inherited Raven's psychic abilities, and Nia.[10][63] Chelsea, also a divorced mother, moves in with Raven to raise her son Levi.[63] Raven-Symon\u00e9 is an executive producer on the series, which premiered on July 21, 2017.[64] Sheridan is featured as a guest and returns as a regular character for the program's fifth season; Keym\u00e1h also guest-stars in the fifth-season finale.[65][66] The sixth season premiered in April 2023. An Indian adaptation of the series entitled *Palak Pe Jhalak* premiered on Disney Channel in India in September 2015, and incorporates Indian culture and languages.[67]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\n\n1. **^** By August 2006, there were no plans to syndicate the show.[14]\n2. **^** Also awarded to *Lisa Knight and the Round Table*.\n\n**Citations**\n\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** \"Raven Symone To Star in Disney Channel Original Series *That's So Raven*; Production To Begin in Los Angeles Nov. 9\". *Business Wire*.

The series follows stepbrothers Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher during summer vacation. Every day, the boys undertake the construction of a grand project, or embark on a spectacular adventure, to make the most of their time on vacation. This annoys their controlling older sister Candace, who frequently tries to expose their schemes to her and Phineas's mother. The series follows a standard plot system; running gags occur in every episode.\n\n\nPovenmire and Marsh conceived the characters while working together on animated programs *The Simpsons* and *Rocko's Modern Life* in the 1990s, and were inspired by the summers of their own childhoods. They developed the series together and pitched it to networks for 16 years before successfully selling the idea to The Walt Disney Company. *Phineas and Ferb* is produced by Disney Television Animation, and was originally broadcast as a one-episode preview on August 17, 2007, following the premiere of the made-for-television film *High School Musical 2*. It again previewed on September 28, 2007, and officially premiered on Disney Channel on February 1, 2008. The series originally concluded on June 12, 2015, before two new seasons were ordered in January 2023.\n\n\n*Phineas and Ferb* is one of Disney Channel's most successful animated franchises. It received high viewership in the United States on cable television and influenced the development of merchandise, a live tour, spin-offs and movies. A made-for-television film, *Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension*, aired in 2011, while a follow-up titled *Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe* was released on Disney+ in 2020. Critics praised the writing and humor of the show, citing its appeal to a wide range of ages, however, some reviewers criticized its lack of originality and formulaic approach. The series won a Daytime Emmy Award in 2010 for Outstanding Writing in Animation, and won several Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nThe show follows the adventures of stepbrothers Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher, who are between eight and ten years old.[2][3] They live in the fictional city of Danville in an unspecified tri-state area, as they seek ways to occupy their time during their \"104 days of summer vacation\". Often these adventures involve elaborate, life-sized and ostensibly dangerous construction projects, which are usually unrealistic in scale given the protagonists' ages (and are sometimes physically impossible). Phineas' older sister Candace Flynn has two obsessions: unveil Phineas and Ferb's schemes and ideas, and winning the attention of a boy named Jeremy.[4]\n\n\nThe subplot almost always features Phineas and Ferb's pet platypus Perry, who works as a secret agent identified as Agent P, for an all-animal government organization named O.W.C.A. (\"Organization Without a Cool Acronym\").[5][6] His regular objective is to defeat the latest scheme of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, a mad scientist driven largely by a need to assert his evilness who is often defeated by his own ineptitude.[7] The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys' project just before Candace can show it to their mother, which usually leaves Candace very frustrated.\n\n\n\n## Characters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Phineas and Ferb characters\n\n![](image)A platypus was included in the series because of its interesting appearance.[8]\nThe series' main characters live in a blended family, a premise that the creators considered underused in children's programming and that reflected Marsh's own upbringing. Marsh considers explaining the family background \"not important to the kids' lives. They are a great blended family and that's all we need to know.\"[9] The choice of a platypus as the boys' pet was similarly inspired by media underuse, as well as to exploit the animal's striking appearance.[8] Povenmire and Marsh wanted to select an uncommon species, an animal that kids could not \"pick out at a pet store and beg [their parents] for.\"[10] The platypus also gives them freedom to \"make stuff up\" since \"no one knows very much about them.\"[9] Choosing a platypus also allowed them to own that \"mental real estate,\" so that if someone thinks of the word \"platypus,\" they will associate it with Agent P, just as an ogre is now commonly associated with Shrek.[11] Marsh called the characters \"cool, edgy and clever without ... being mean-spirited.\" Animation director Rob Hughes is said to have noted that \"in all the other shows every character is either stupid or a jerk, but there are no stupid characters or jerks in this one.\"[4]\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\n### Early inspirations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Povenmire drew inspiration for the show from his boyhood in Mobile, Alabama.[12]\nDan Povenmire attributes the show's genesis to his childhood in Mobile, Alabama, where his mother told him to never waste a day of summer. To occupy himself, Povenmire undertook projects such as hole-digging and home movie-making. Povenmire recalled, \"My mom let me drape black material all the way across one end of our living room to use as a space field. I would hang little models of spaceships for these little movies I made with a Super 8 camera.\"[2][12][13] He was an artistic prodigy and displayed his very detailed drawings at art shows.[14] Marsh was raised in a large, blended family.[15] As with Povenmire, Marsh spent his summers exploring and taking part in various activities to have fun.[4]\n\n\n\n### Conception[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Drawn on butcher paper, this first drawing of Phineas began a rapid growth of characters and the outline of the artistic style.[4]\nWhile attending the University of Southern California, Povenmire started a daily comic strip called *Life Is a Fish*, and received money from the sale of its related merchandise. He eventually dropped out and started drawing people on street corners to make a living, until he was finally called by Tommy Chong to work on a short bit of animation in the film *Far Out Man*. Povenmire began to take up animation professionally, working on shows such as *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles*.[14] Marsh had become a vice president of sales and marketing for a computer company until he \"freaked out\" and decided to quit. His friend helped him put together a portfolio and enter the animation business.[15]\n\n\nPovenmire and Marsh started working across from each other as layout artists on *The Simpsons*. The two bonded over mutual tastes in humor and music, becoming fast friends. They continued their working relationship as a writing team on the Nickelodeon series *Rocko's Modern Life*,[2] where they conceived the idea for their own series.[2] While eating dinner at a Wild Thyme restaurant in South Pasadena, Povenmire drew a quick sketch of a \"triangle kid\" on butcher paper.[16] He tore it out and called Marsh that night to report, \"Hey, I think we have our show.\"[8] The triangle doodle sparked rapid development of characters and designs.[16] Povenmire decided that his sketch \"looked like a Phineas,\" and named Ferb after a friend who \"owns more tools than anyone in the world.\"[17] The creators based their character designs on angular shapes in homage to Tex Avery, an animator and director for MGM and Warner Bros., adding geometric shapes to the backgrounds for continuity.[16]\n\n\n\n### Pitching and pickup[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Disney Channel was the first network to give the series a chance, though initially declined when Dan Povenmire originally pitched it to them.\nThe writing duo's early attempts to pitch the show failed and, though they remained committed to the concept, Povenmire and Marsh began to drift apart after their work on *Rocko's*. Marsh moved to London and worked on shows including *Postman Pat* and *Bounty Hamster*. Povenmire began working on the primetime Fox series *Family Guy*[2] and the Nickelodeon series *SpongeBob SquarePants*, always carrying a *Phineas and Ferb* portfolio[8] for convenient pitching to networks such as Cartoon Network and Fox Kids. The networks passed on the show, believing the series' premise was too complex to succeed.[2]\n\n\nPovenmire persisted and again pitched the series to Nickelodeon, where it was considered by high-level executives but rejected once more as overly complicated.[2] Then, after 16 years of trying, Povenmire landed a pitch with Disney. The network did not immediately accept the show, but told Povenmire that it would keep the packet. Povenmire assumed that this had meant an end to negotiations, aware that the phrase usually \"means they throw it in the trash later.\" Disney then surprised him by accepting.[14] Said Povenmire, \"Disney was the first to say, 'Let's see if you can do it in 11 minutes.' We did it in the pilot and they said, 'Let's see if you can do it for 26 episodes.'\"[4]\n\n\nPovenmire was initially worried that his work on *Family Guy* (an adult show known for its lowbrow humor) would concern Disney, which markets its fare primarily to families. However, Disney Channel senior vice president of original series Adam Bonnett was a *Family Guy* fan who appreciated Povenmire's connection to the show and received his pitch well.[4]\n\n\nIn 2006, after the Disney Channel had accepted the show, Povenmire and Marsh turned their attention to the company's overseas executives. Instead of penning a normal script, the two drew out storyboards and played them in a reel. Povenmire voiced over the reel with his dialogue and added sound effects. This novel approach secured the executives' support.[12]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Writing style[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Phineas and Ferb* co-creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh in 2009\nThe show uses four main writers to devise story ideas according to \"strict guidelines\", such as that the boys' schemes never appear to be \"magical.\" Stories are reviewed at weekly sessions on a Monday, then simultaneously scripted and storyboarded. A very rough design is built before the storyboard, featuring little more than suggested scenes and dialogue, is drafted; the writers then gather for a \"play-by-play\" walkthrough of the storyboard in front of the whole crew, whose reactions to the jokes are assessed before rewrites are made.[18] The writers also include running gags in every episode, which are generally lines spoken by characters.[2][19] Almost every episode is split into two 11-minute segments.[20] Dan Povenmire admitted that the \"a-plot\" of each episode, the one following Phineas and Ferb's inventions, is not actually a plot, but instead the setting, with the actual plot being Candace, Perry and Dr. Doofenshmirtz's story, \"The essence of story is that the characters are changed by what happens to them. Nothing ever changes the boys, they never learn anything, there's never any obstacles they have to overcome, everything just works out for them.\"[21]\n\n\nMuch of the series' humor relies on running gags used in almost every episode, with slight variation.[22] \nCertain aspects of the show's humor are aimed at adults,[15] including its frequent pop-culture references.[23] Co-creator Dan Povenmire, who had previously worked on *Family Guy*, sought to create a less raunchy show that would make similar use of comic timing, metahumor, humorous blank stares, wordplay and breaking the fourth wall.[16] Povenmire describes the show as a combination of *Family Guy* and *SpongeBob SquarePants*.[24] Co-creator Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh has said that the show was not created exclusively for children; he simply did not exclude them as an audience.[15]\n\n\n\n### Visual aspects and animation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The stages of development for a scene during the opening theme, from the original draft (top) to the final design (bottom). The top appears briefly in the Season 1 theme.\nRough Draft Studios in South Korea, Wang Film Productions in Taiwan, Morning Sun Animation and Synergy Animation in Shanghai and Hong Ying Animation and Hong Guang Animation in Suzhou animate the series in 2D Animation using the software package Toon Boom.[25] Povenmire undertakes the bulk of production direction, along with Zac Moncrief and Robert Hughes.[26] The series adopts artistic features from animator Tex Avery, such as geometric shapes integrated into characters, objects, and backgrounds. Povenmire says of this inclusion, \"There's a little bit of Tex Avery in there-he had that very graphic style [in his later cartoons].\"[16] Triangles are featured as an easter egg in the background of every episode, sometimes in trees or buildings.[15]\n\n\nBright colors are also a prominent element of the animation. Marsh elaborates, \"The idea at the end of the day was candy. One of the things that I think works so well is that the characters are so bright and candy-colored and our backgrounds are a much more realistic depiction of the world: the soft green of the grass, the natural woods for the fence. In order for all the stuff that they do to work, their world needs to be grounded in reality.\" The designers sought to keep their characters visually simple, so that kids \"would easily be able to draw [them] themselves.\" Characters were also crafted to be recognizable from a distance, a technique that the creators say is based on Matt Groening's goal of making characters recognizable by silhouette.[15]\n\n\n\n### Cast[edit]\n\n\nPhineas and Ferb are voiced by Vincent Martella and Thomas Sangster, respectively.[27] Sangster was one of many British actors cast, as Marsh lived in the United Kingdom for seven years and developed a fondness for the British.[28] The rest of the cast includes Ashley Tisdale as their sister Candace; Bobby Gaylor as Buford van Stomm, who has a tendency to bully but is kept distracted by being included in the adventures; Maulik Pancholy as Baljeet Tjinder, a very intelligent boy who avoids being Buford's main victim by their participation in the adventures; Dee Bradley Baker as Perry the Platypus; Caroline Rhea as Linda Flynn-Fletcher, Phineas and Candace's mother and stepmother to Ferb;[27] Richard O'Brien as Lawrence Fletcher, Ferb's father and Phineas and Candace's stepfather;[29] Jack McBrayer as Irving, who admires Phineas and Ferb, and is the creator of the Phineas and Ferb fansite; Kelly Hu as Candace's best friend Stacy;[28] Povenmire as Dr. Doofenshmirtz; Marsh as Major Monogram; Olivia Olson as Dr. Doofenshmirtz's daughter Vanessa; Tyler Mann as Carl, Major Monogram's goofy super genius intern; Alyson Stoner as neighbor Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, a sweet Mexican/Jewish girl with a crush on Phineas; Mitchel Musso as Jeremy, Candace's crush and later her boyfriend; and Madison Pettis as Adyson Sweetwater, a member of Isabella's Fireside Girls troop.\n\n\nThe show's casting organization is responsible for selecting most of the voice actors and actresses, choosing actors such as Martella and Musso for major roles based on perceived popularity with target demographics. Povenmire and Marsh select guest stars, casting people that they \"really want to work with.\" They also solicit guest roles from actors whom they feel would lend an interesting presence to the show.[17]\n\n\nGuest stars have included pop-culture figures such as Damian Lewis, boxer Evander Holyfield, film stars Cloris Leachman and Ben Stiller and pop singer Kelly Clarkson. Povenmire and Marsh have also solicited Tim Curry and Barry Bostwick, stars of *The Rocky Horror Picture Show*, to make guest appearances, while *Rocky Horror* creator Richard O'Brien voices Lawrence Fletcher.[29] *Top Gear* stars Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May guest-starred in a race-car themed episode as commentators.[30] Other guest stars include Tina Fey, Seth MacFarlane, David Mitchell, Jaret Reddick, Clay Aiken, Chaka Khan and Kevin Smith.[29][31]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nThe series is known for its original songs that appear in almost every episode since the first-season \"Flop Starz\". Disney's executives particularly enjoyed the episode's song \"Gitchee, Gitchee Goo\" and requested that a song appear in each subsequent episode.[4] The music earned the series a total of four Emmy nominations: in 2008 for the main title theme and for the song \"I Ain't Got Rhythm\" from the episode \"Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together\",[32] and in 2010 for the song \"Come Home Perry\" from the episode \"Oh, There You Are, Perry\" as well as one for its score.\n\n\n\n> \n> \"Every episode since [Flop Starz] has a song in it. It's not always the characters singing onscreen\u00a0\u2013 they don't break into song just to advance the plot. The music doesn't come out of nowhere, sometimes it's just a montage over action. We've done every genre known to man: ABBA, Broadway show tunes, 16th-century madrigals\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Dan Povenmire on the songs.[4]\n\n*Phineas and Ferb* follows structural conventions that Povenmire and Marsh developed while writing *Rocko's Modern Life*, whereby each episode features \"a song or a musical number, plus a big action/chase scene.\"[4] Both creators had musical backgrounds, as Povenmire performed rock and roll in his college years[14] and Marsh's grandfather was the bandleader Les Brown.[15]\n\n\nThe series' songs span many genres, from 16th-century madrigals to Broadway show tunes.[4] Each is written in an intensive session during episode production; a concept, score and lyrics are developed quickly.[33] Together, Marsh and Povenmire can \"write a song about almost anything\" within one hour.[9] After they finish writing their songs, Povenmire and Marsh sing them over the answering machine of series composer Danny Jacob on Friday nights. By the following Monday, the song is fully produced.[34]\n\n\nThe title sequence song \"Today is Gonna Be a Great Day\", performed by the American group Bowling for Soup, was nominated for an Emmy award in 2008.[7][32] The creators originally wrote a slower number more in keeping with a \"classic Disney song\", but the network felt that changes were needed to especially appeal to children and commissioned the rock version that made the final cut.[12]\n\n\nA season two clip show, entitled \"Phineas and Ferb's Musical Cliptastic Countdown\", was broadcast in October 2009. The show focuses on the series' music, featuring a viewer-voted list of the top ten songs from the series.[35] This clip show spawned a sequel, \"Phineas and Ferb Musical Cliptastic Countdown Hosted by Kelly Osbourne\", which aired on June 28, 2013. Osbourne hosted the special in live form, while Dr. Doofenshmirtz and Major Monogram appeared as animated.[36]\n\n\n\n### Conclusion and revival[edit]\n\n\n*Phineas and Ferb* was renewed for a fourth season in August 2011.[37] The series finale was announced in May 2015; the hour-long episode titled \"Last Day of Summer\" aired on June 12, 2015. Povenmire and Marsh remained with the network and together created a new series, *Milo Murphy's Law*, which aired from 2016 to 2019.[38]\n\n\nIn January 2023, 40 new episodes of *Phineas and Ferb* were ordered, to be split across two seasons, with Povenmire returning as executive producer. The deal also included a second season renewal for Povenmire's series *Hamster & Gretel*.[39] Disney Branded Television made the announcement at the Television Critics Association.[39] On March 16, 2023, it was announced that Marsh would also be returning as executive producer and voice director.[40] Writing for the revival began in May, and voice recording had begun by September. It was neither affected by the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike nor the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[41][42] The revival is expected to release in 2024.[43]\n\n\n\n## Episodes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Phineas and Ferb episodes\n\n| Season | Segments | Episodes | Originally aired |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First aired | Last aired |\n| 1 | 47 | 26 | August\u00a017,\u00a02007\u00a0(2007-08-17) | February\u00a018,\u00a02009\u00a0(2009-02-18) |\n| 2 | 65 | 38 | February\u00a019,\u00a02009\u00a0(2009-02-19) | February\u00a011,\u00a02011\u00a0(2011-02-11) |\n| 3 | 62 | 35 | March\u00a04,\u00a02011\u00a0(2011-03-04) | November\u00a030,\u00a02012\u00a0(2012-11-30) |\n| 4 | 48 | 30 | December\u00a07,\u00a02012\u00a0(2012-12-07) | June\u00a012,\u00a02015\u00a0(2015-06-12) |\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nThe show has received generally positive reviews. *The New York Times* commented favorably, describing the show as \"*Family Guy* with an espionage subplot and a big dose of magical realism.\" It considered the pop-culture references ubiquitous \"but [placed] with such skill that it seems smart, not cheap.\"[23] Whitney Matheson wrote in her *USA Today* blog *Pop Candy* that the series was an achievement in children's programming, applauding the writing and calling the show \"an animated version of *Parker Lewis Can't Lose*.\"[44] Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media praised the show's humor and plot, giving it four out of five stars.[45] *The Seattle Times* wrote that the story of the show was \"valiant\" and that the main characters are \"young heroes.\"[46]\n\n\n*Variety* noted the show's appeal to all ages with its \"sense of wit and irreverence.\"[47] Similar reviews have emphasized the series' popularity with adults; Rebecca Wright of *Elastic Pops* wrote, \"As an adult, I really enjoyed watching this *Phineas and Ferb* DVD, and I think it is one that the whole family can enjoy.\" Wright also called the series' \"irreverent style\" reminiscent of *The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle*.[48] *Wired*'s Matt Blum has stated in reviews of the series that he \"can stand to watch just about anything with [his] kids, but [he] actually look[s] forward to watching *Phineas and Ferb* with them.\"[22] Notable celebrities identified as fans of the series include Bob Eubanks, Anthony LaPaglia, Ben Stiller, Chaka Khan, Jeff Sullivan and Jake Gyllenhaal.[49][50][51]\n\n\nAmong the negative reviews is one that charges the series with a lack of originality. Maxie Zeus of *Toon Zone* argues that the show is \"derivative, but obviously so, and shorn of even the best features of what has been stolen.\" Zeus takes issue with the writing, feeling that certain jokes and conventions were \"ripped-off\" from other shows.[52] Kevin McDonough of *Sun Coast Today* criticized the show for its plot complexity, constant action and \"characters [that] can do just about anything.\" McDonough stated that \"it's never clear whether P&F are intended to entertain children or are merely a reflection of grown-up animators engaged in a juvenile lark.\"[53] Marylin Moss of *The Hollywood Reporter* described *Phineas and Ferb* as \"Pretty mindless but kids of all ages might find a humorous moment in it.\" Moss called the plot lines redundant but praised the music styles and guest stars.[54]\n\n\nAlan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz gave a positive assessment in their 2016 book *TV (The Book)*, stating that \"In television, formula often seems to come from a lack of imagination. ... *Phineas and Ferb* though, managed at the same time to be wildly imaginative and slavishly formulaic, using its repetitive structure not as a crutch, but as a sturdy framework on which it could hang all kinds of fantastic new ideas.\" They further added that \"the characters' awareness of that formula, and any deviations from it, quickly became one of the show's most fertile sources of humor.\"[55]\n\n\n\n### Ratings[edit]\n\n\nThe first episode, \"Rollercoaster\", garnered a total of 10.8 million viewers when aired as a preview on August 17, 2007, holding onto more than half of the record-setting audience of its lead-in, *High School Musical 2*.[56] When *Phineas and Ferb* officially debuted in February the next year, it proved to be cable's number-one watched animated series premiere by tweens. Throughout the quarter that followed, it peaked as the top-rated animated series for ages 6\u201310 and 9\u201314, also becoming the number-three animated series on cable television for viewers age 6\u201310.[27] By the time the second season was announced in May 2008, the series had become a top-rated program in the 6\u201311 and 9\u201314 age groups.[57]\n\n\nThe Disney Channel airing of \"Phineas and Ferb Get Busted!\" was watched by 3.7 million viewers.[58] The episodes \"Perry Lays an Egg\" and \"Gaming the System\" achieved the most views by ages 6\u201311 and 9\u201314 of any channel in that night's time slot. This achievement made the series the number-one animated telecast that week for its target demographics.[59] On June 7, 2009, Disney announced that the show had become the number-one primetime animated show for the 6\u201310 and 9\u201314 groups.[8]\n\n\nThe premiere of \"Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation\" garnered 2.62 million viewers during its debut on Disney XD, the most watched telecast in the channel's history (including Toon Disney) and the number-three program of the night across all demographics. It received 5.2 million viewers for its debut on Disney Channel and was the highest-rated episode of the series to date and fifth-highest for the week.[60][61][62]\n\n\nThe premiere of \"Phineas and Ferb: Summer Belongs to You!\" garnered 3.862 million viewers and was watched by 22% of children 2\u201311, 13% of teens, 5% of households and 3% of adults 18\u201349, also ranking as the number-one program for that night and as 25th for the week.[63][64] On Disney XD, the episode ranked among the channel's top three telecasts of the year with 1.32 million viewers, including 365,000 among boys 6\u201311, with a 2.9 rating. The hour-long telecast on August 2, 2010, was the series' number-two telecast of all time on Disney XD in total viewers, behind only December 2009's \"Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation\".[65]\n\n\n\n### Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of awards and nominations received by *Phineas and Ferb*\n| Award\n | Year\n | Recipient(s) and nominee(s)\n | Category\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Annie Awards | 2009 | *Phineas and Ferb* | Best Animated Television Program\n | Nominated\n | [66] |\n| 2010 | \"Nerds of a Feather\"\n | Best Writing in a Television Production\n | Nominated\n | [67] |\n| 2021 | Ashley Tisdale (for *Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe*)\n | Outstanding Achievement for Voice Acting in an Animated Television / Broadcast Production\n | Nominated\n | [68] |\n| British Academy Children's Awards | 2008\n | *Phineas and Ferb* | Best International | Nominated\n | [69] |\n| 2009\n | *Phineas and Ferb* | Nominated\n | [70] |\n| 2010\n | *Phineas and Ferb* | Nominated\n | [71] |\n| 2011\n | *Phineas and Ferb* | Nominated\n | [72] |\n| 2012\n | *Phineas and Ferb* | Nominated\n | [73] |\n| 2014\n | *Phineas and Ferb* | BAFTA Kids' Vote: Television\n | Nominated\n | [74] |\n| Critics' Choice Television Awards | 2013 | *Phineas and Ferb* | Best Animated Series | Nominated\n | [75] |\n| 2014 | *Phineas and Ferb* | Nominated\n | [76] |\n| Daytime Emmy Awards | 2010 | *Phineas and Ferb* | Outstanding Writing in Animation\n | WonB | [77] |\n| \"Come Home Perry\"\n | Outstanding Original Song \u2013 Children's and Animation\n | Nominated\n | [78] |\n| Danny Jacob\n | Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction and Composition\n | Nominated\n |\n| Robert Poole II, Robbi Smith, and Roy Braverman | Outstanding Achievement in Sound Editing \u2013 Live Action and Animation\n | Nominated\n |\n| 2015 | \"Phineas and Ferb Save Summer\"\n | Outstanding Special Class Animated Program\n | Nominated\n |  |\n| 2021 | Dan Povenmire, Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh, Jon Colton Barry, Jim Bernstein, Joshua Pruett, Kate Kondell, Jeffrey M.

As an area award, nominees had to garner 50% approval to win the award. None of the nominees met the benchmark, and no award was given.[97]\n2.**^B** Shared with *Back at the Barnyard*.[77]\n## Other media[edit]\n\n\n### Films[edit]\n\n\nOn March 3, 2010, a Disney press release announced a made-for-television film based on the series, entitled *Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension*, which aired on the Disney Channel on August 5, 2011. The film depicts Phineas and Ferb accidentally helping Dr. Doofenshmirtz with an invention that takes them to a parallel dimension, where Perry reveals his double life as a secret agent to them, and, to save their friends from a devious alternative Dr. Doofenshmirtz, they team up with their alternate-dimension selves to stop him.[98]\n\n\nIn January 2011, Gary Marsh, the president of Disney Channels Worldwide announced that early development on a theatrical feature film adaptation of *Phineas and Ferb* had commenced. Sean Bailey, head of production at Walt Disney Pictures, led the development, which would combine live-action and animation.[99] By July, Povenmire and Marsh were in the early stages of writing the film's script; Michael Arndt, the writer of *Little Miss Sunshine* and *Toy Story 3*, was hired to write a further draft of the screenplay.[100][101] The film was to be produced by Mandeville Films, and was originally scheduled for release on July 26, 2013.[101][102] In October 2012, Disney moved the release date to 2014, and in August 2013, the film was removed from its schedule.[103][104]\n\n\nOn April 11, 2019, it was announced that a film, titled *Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe*, would be released on Disney+ within a year of its launch; it would eventually premiere on August 28, 2020.[105] Most of the series' cast reprised their roles, with the exception of Thomas Sangster as Ferb, who was replaced by David Errigo Jr., who had previously voiced Ferb on *Milo Murphy's Law*.[106][107][108][109] According to writer Jim Bernstein, the film is unrelated to the previously shelved theatrical *Phineas and Ferb* film.[110][111]\n\n\n\n### Crossovers and short series[edit]\n\n\nDisney produced *Take Two with Phineas and Ferb*, a live-action talk show in which the two characters (as cartoons) interviewed celebrities, similarly to *Space Ghost Coast to Coast*, which began aired from December 2010 to November 25, 2011 as a two-minute talk-show format featuring real-life celebrities.[112] Several other local guests have appeared in countries outside the United States.\n\n\n*Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel*, a crossover between *Phineas and Ferb* and Marvel Entertainment aired in the summer of 2013, as 22nd episode of the 4th season.[113] It features Marvel Comics superheroes Iron Man, Spider-Man, the Hulk and Thor and the villains the Red Skull, Whiplash, Venom and M.O.D.O.K. It is the first major animated crossover between Marvel and Disney since the acquisition of Marvel Entertainment by Disney in 2009.[114]\n\n\n*Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars*, a crossover between *Phineas and Ferb* and *Star Wars* aired on July 26, 2014 as the 41st episode of the 4th season,[115][116] taking place as a sidebar to the events of *Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope* (1977). \n\n\nPovenmire has stated that he would like to do a crossover with his and Marsh's follow-up show, *Milo Murphy's Law*, which takes place in the same universe as *Phineas and Ferb*.[117] The crossover eventually took place in *Milo Murphy's Law*'s second season premiere, titled \"The Phineas and Ferb Effect\". The entire *Phineas and Ferb* cast reprised their roles for the episode, with the exception of Thomas Sangster, the original voice of Ferb, who was instead voiced by David Errigo, Jr.[118] Before the crossover aired, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz cameoed at the end of the episode \"Fungus Among Us\"; following the crossover, the characters Dr. Doofenshmirtz, Perry, Major Monogram and Carl joined the cast of *Milo Murphy's Law* in a recurring capacity.\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Disney licensed a Nintendo DS video game titled *Phineas and Ferb*. The game's story follows the title characters as they try to build a roller coaster. The player controls Phineas, Ferb and occasionally Perry the Platypus. Phineas scavenges for spare parts for the roller coaster while Ferb fixes various objects around town, gaining access to new areas as a result. Ferb can also construct new parts of the coaster and its vehicle-themed carts. Each activity features a short mini-game.[119][120][121] The game was well-received and garners a 76.67% on GameRankings.[122] A sequel entitled *Phineas and Ferb: Ride Again* was released on September 14, 2010.[123] Another game, *Phineas and Ferb: Across the Second Dimension*, was released for the Wii and PlayStation 3 platforms in 2011.[124]\n\n\nIn 2012, Walt Disney World opened an interactive game based on the series at Epcot, titled *Agent P's World Showcase Adventure*, which centered around Perry and Dr. Doofenshmirtz, based on the previous attraction *Kim Possible World Showcase Adventure*.[125]\n\n\nAlso in 2012, Disney Mobile launched a mobile game titled *Where's My Perry?* for iOS and Android. It was based on Disney's popular *Where's My Water?* game, using similar physics.[126]\n\n\nIn 2013, Disney commissioned Majesco Entertainment to create *Phineas and Ferb: Quest for Cool Stuff*, which was released for the Xbox 360, Wii U, Wii, Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo DS platforms.[127][128]\n\n\nPhineas and Agent P appear as playable characters in all the video games of the *Disney Infinity* series. As with the other playable characters in the games, tie-in figures for them were also released.[129]\n\n\n\n### Live tour[edit]\n\n\n*Phineas and Ferb: The Best LIVE Tour Ever* was a touring two-act adaptation of the TV show. A projection system played video in the same style as the TV show on the rear of the stage; the characters were first introduced there in their cartoon forms, but then used a backyard slide that continued into a physical slide, out of which the live cast members emerged into the real world. The performers wore prosthetics to make their characters resemble their cartoon counterparts\u2014mostly head pieces, but a full body suit in the cases of Buford and Perry.[130] The 2011\u20132012 season of the tour began on August 21, 2011, in Lakeland, Florida and ended on April 22, 2012, in East Rutherford, New Jersey.[131] The 2012\u20132013 season began on August 23, 2012, in Wheeling, West Virginia and ran until February 18, 2013, in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nDisney has licensed a number of products from the show, including figures and plush toys of characters Perry, Ferb, Phineas and Candace.[132] As with the other playable characters in the *Disney Infinity* games, tie-in figures for Phineas and Agent P were also released.[129] Disney released several T-shirts for the show and launched a \"Make your own T-shirt\" program on its website.[133]\n\n\nTwo Season 1 DVDs, entitled *The Fast and the Phineas* and *The Daze of Summer*, have been released; the discs include episodes never previously broadcast in the U.S.[134][135] A third DVD was released on October 5, 2010, called *A Very Perry Christmas*. Some reviewers were displeased that the discs covered selected episodes rather than the entire series, but noted that Disney does not generally release full-season DVD sets.[134] Authors have novelized several episodes.[136]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Holz, Jo (August 23, 2017). *Kids' TV Grows Up: The Path from Howdy Doody to SpongeBob*.

The series centers on Miley Stewart (Miley Cyrus), a teenage girl living a double life as famous pop singer Hannah Montana, an alter ego she adopted so she could maintain her anonymity and live a normal life as a typical teenager. Episodes deal with Miley's everyday struggles to cope with the social and personal issues of adolescence while maintaining the added complexities of her secret identity, which she sustains by wearing a blonde wig. Miley has strong relationships with her brother Jackson (Jason Earles) and father Robby Ray (Billy Ray Cyrus), as well as her best friends Lilly Truscott (Emily Osment) and Oliver Oken (Mitchel Musso), who become aware of her secret. Overarching themes include a focus on family and friendships as well as the importance of music and discovering one's identity.\n\n\nThe Walt Disney Company commissioned the series after the success of Disney Channel's previous music-based franchises, such as the made-for-television film *High School Musical* (2006). *Hannah Montana* was produced by It's a Laugh Productions in association with Poryes's production company, and premiered on Disney Channel on March 24, 2006. A concert film, *Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert*, in which Miley Cyrus performs as Hannah Montana and herself, was released in 2008. The following year, the feature film *Hannah Montana: The Movie* was released. The series concluded on January 16, 2011, as a result of Cyrus's growing popularity and music career, and her desire to move into more mature acting roles.\n\n\n*Hannah Montana* is one of Disney Channel's most commercially successful franchises. It received consistently high viewership in the United States on cable television and influenced the development of merchandise, soundtrack albums, and concert tours; however, television critics disliked the writing and depiction of gender roles and stereotypes. *Hannah Montana* helped launch Cyrus's musical career and established her as a teen idol; after Cyrus began developing an increasingly provocative public image, commentators criticized *Hannah Montana* as having a negative influence on its audience. The series was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Children's Program between 2007 and 2010; Cyrus won a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Series, Leading Young Actress in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\n### Story and characters[edit]\n\n\n![A mid shot of a female performer wearing bright pink clothes and playing a musical keyboard. Musical equipment and staging sits around her.](image)Miley Cyrus, pictured in 2008, serves as the program's central focus during its four-season run.\nMiley Stewart is a fourteen-year-old middle school student who appears to live a normal life but has a secret identity, pop singer Hannah Montana, an alias she chose so she could have a private life away from the public spotlight.[2] To conceal her true identity, she wears a blonde wig when she appears as Hannah.[3] Miley's father, Robby Ray Stewart, was a famous country music singer[i] before retiring after his wife's death to focus on raising his two children: Miley and her older brother Jackson.[5] At the start of the series, the family have moved from Tennessee to Malibu, California, to allow Miley to develop her musical career; Robby Ray works as her manager.[6][7] As her schoolmates idolize Hannah Montana, Miley is often tempted to reveal her secret and assume a celebrity status at school.[8] In the pilot episode, Miley's best friend Lilly Truscott uncovers the truth about her alter ego and throughout the first season, Lilly adopts the alias Lola Luftnagle to help protect Miley's secret.[7][9] Miley later reveals her secret to close friend Oliver Oken, leaving him and Lilly as the only schoolmates she trusts with the secret;[8] he adopts the alias Mike Stanley III.[7] Jackson works for Rico Suave at a local beach food stand; he and Rico often feature in the show's subplots.[7] Miley and her friends begin attending high school at the start of the second season,[10] and in the following season, Lilly and Oliver develop a romantic relationship.\n\n\nIn the third season finale, Miley relocates her horse Blue Jeans to California after she feels homesick for Tennessee. The horse is uncomfortable after being moved, and Miley contemplates permanently returning to her hometown.[11] The Stewart family compromise and move out of their house in Malibu to a nearby ranch.[1][12] In the final season, Miley is faced with extra difficulties in maintaining her double life, which affect her capacity to attend college with Lilly.[1] She must decide between continuing being Hannah Montana and divulging her secret.[13] Ultimately, she reveals her true identity to the world and before leaving for college has to deal with the effects of this decision.[1][14] She merges her celebrity persona with her former private identity, and Miley Stewart enters adulthood with a newfound celebrity status.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### Themes[edit]\n\n\n![A mid shot of a female performer, wearing a long blonde wig, singing into a microphone. She is wearing a dress with pink sequins. A screen projecting images of the performance appears behind her.](image)Miley Cyrus performing as Hannah Montana; the persona is identifiable by her blonde wig.\nThe central conflict of the series is the disconnect between the public and private lives of Miley Stewart, and the lengths to which she must go to secure her life as a normal teenager and protect her relationships with her friends. She values her core identity as \"just Miley\" and endeavors to protect her sense of self. This is made evident in the pilot when she fears her friends might not treat her the same way if they become aware of her celebrity status; Miley's friendships and social opportunities at school are important to her.[9] Jacques Steinberg of *The New York Times* said the series suggests celebrity status should not be confused with real life and that happiness comes as a result of staying true to one's self.[8] In the *Celebrity Studies* journal, Melanie Kennedy states Miley must learn to remain as her \"authentic self\" while still being a celebrity;[16] Tyler Bickford of *Women's Studies Quarterly* observes that lyrics in the theme song \"celebrate authenticity\" while also accentuating the benefits of a celebrity lifestyle.[17] Morgan Genevieve Blue of *Feminist Media Studies* distinguished *Hannah Montana* from other programs about secret identities because of the public nature of Miley's alter ego.[18]\n\n\nSeries creator Michael Poryes said his goal was not to focus on the gimmick but to write about characters and relationships, exploring the real issues Miley faces and how they would be affected by her celebrity lifestyle.[19] While Miley discloses her secret to her close friends, she largely continues to hide her identity because the loss of the anonymity would, to her, represent a loss of her youth. When she reveals her true identity to the world, it is a symbolic representation of the end of her childhood.[14] The final episodes reflect Miley's struggle to say goodbye to her alter ego.[13]\n\n\nAccording to Kennedy, *Hannah Montana* parallels the idea of \"becoming a celebrity\" with \"growing up female\" and teaches young women the perceived importance of investing in celebrity culture.[20] This intensifies and normalizes the desire of young people to become famous.[21] Bickford said the series discusses themes of publicness and consumerism.[2] Friendship is an important theme of the series, which is evident between Miley and her best friend Lilly. When Miley tells Lilly about her hidden persona in the pilot episode, Lilly promises not to divulge the secret to anyone. Bickford described these relationships as the \"emotionally fraught\", \"intensely valued\" core of the series, reflecting the way best-friendship is an important element of childhood.[22]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 2000s, The Walt Disney Company found success with its pay television network Disney Channel, which had a pattern of original programming for a preadolescent audience that featured music.[3][23] The girl group The Cheetah Girls was made popular by the eponymous television film and found commercial success outside the movie, and Hilary Duff's music was used to cross-promote the series *Lizzie McGuire*.[3] Disney sponsored concerts featuring music from the network and used their talent to build on the brands; Gary Marsh, the president of Disney Channels Worldwide, cited *Lizzie McGuire* as its \"first success\".[3][24] The network believed the new series *Hannah Montana* could be marketed in a similar manner.[8] Disney Channel had also found success with musical episodes of its earlier comedy series *Even Stevens* and *That's So Raven*.[25] Hollywood.com said the show could build on the success of Disney's television film *High School Musical* (2006), which also includes music.[23][26] The sitcom premiered two months after *High School Musical*.[26][27] The concept of *Hannah Montana* was originally labeled \"cast contingent\", meaning the series would not progress until the central roles were appropriately cast.[3] The project was publicly announced in 2004; casting advertisements for the filming of a pilot were published in January 2005.[28][29][30]\n\n\nDisney Channel officially greenlit *Hannah Montana* as a new, half-hour sitcom in August\u00a02005.[8][30] Twenty episodes were initially ordered for the first season and six extra episodes were later added to the commission.[8][10][30][ii] The series was developed by Poryes, who had previously co-created and produced *That's So Raven* for Disney Channel.[28][30] Poryes created the show with Rich Correll and Barry O'Brien, and Steven Peterman joined Poryes as an executive producer.[30][32] Disney selected the pilot for *Hannah Montana* to progress to a series against a potential spin-off of *Lizzie McGuire*, which the network also considered during the 2004\u201305 pilot season.[28][30][33] The full main cast were attached to the project in August and filming for the remainder of the first season was scheduled to begin in November 2005.[30] It's a Laugh Productions produced the program in association with the network.[30] Former president of Disney Channels Worldwide Rich Ross stated the concept of the series conforms to the typical Disney Channel formula; \"an ordinary person in an extraordinary situation\".[3] The series is primarily aimed at a preadolescent female audience,[iii] however, its framework as a family sitcom allows it to have a wider appeal.[35]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *Hannah Montana* characters\n\n![A head shot of a teenage girl with blonde, curly hair, wearing a grey, feathered dress.

He is posing at a press event and smiling.](image)\nEmily Osment (left, 2009) and Mitchel Musso (right, 2010) portrayed Stewart's best friends, Lilly Truscott and Oliver Oken, throughout the series.\n\nThe program and its primary cast were announced in August\u00a02005; Miley Cyrus would be portraying the central character of Miley Stewart.[30] After receiving the script from her agents, Miley Cyrus, aged eleven at the time, auditioned against over 1,000 applicants for the lead role, originally named Chloe Stewart.[8][36] She was rejected for being too young to play the character; Marsh cited her lack of professional experience.[10][iv] Cyrus persistently sent the producers more audition tapes.[3] After six months of further casting searches, Marsh asked Cyrus, aged twelve, to audition again, and she received the role.[10][38] Poryes later stated Marsh was responsible for selecting Cyrus over other \"safe\" choices who were more in-line with the producers' original vision.[19][v] After Cyrus was cast, the character's name was changed to Miley Stewart in an attempt to limit confusion about the show's characters and premise.[40][vi] Network executives cited her confidence, comic timing, and \"husky\" singing voice as reasons for her casting on the series.[8] In 2006, *Time* commented that Disney typically selected actors who had the potential to become popular celebrity figures and that Cyrus would likely experience the same process.[3]\n\n\nCyrus's father, Billy Ray Cyrus, joined the cast as Miley's father Robby Ray Stewart;[30] he was only asked to audition after his daughter had received the role. Peterman praised the pair's \"natural chemistry\".[8][27] Billy Ray Cyrus was initially apprehensive about being cast in the series\u2014he did not want to \"screw up Miley's show\" and suggested a \"real actor\" be cast instead\u2014but later accepted the role.[8]\n\n\nThe series also stars Emily Osment as Lilly Truscott, Mitchel Musso as Oliver Oken, and Jason Earles as Miley's older brother Jackson Stewart.[30][vii] Mois\u00e9s Arias appears as Rico Suave in a supporting role throughout the first season; he was promoted to the main cast for the show's second season.[42][43] The network dropped Musso's character Oliver to a recurring role in the fourth season because he had been cast in *Pair of Kings*, which was developed for the sister channel Disney XD.[44]\n\n\nGuest stars including Vicki Lawrence, Jesse McCartney, and the Jonas Brothers appear throughout the series.[27][45][46] Brooke Shields portrays Miley's deceased mother in dream sequences, through which she typically offers advice.[7] Singer Dolly Parton, Cyrus's real life godmother, had a recurring role as Miley's godmother, Aunt Dolly.[47] Parton stated Cyrus persuaded executives to write her into the series and credited her role for gaining her a following among young people.[47] The final season includes guest roles from musicians Sheryl Crow and Iyaz; actors Christine Taylor, Ray Liotta, and Angus T. Jones; and television personalities Phil McGraw, Jay Leno, and Kelly Ripa.[1][11]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Hannah Montana songs and Hannah Montana discography\n\n![A long shot of a female performer, with long brown hair, singing into a microphone.

To her right is a male musician wearing a leather jacket, playing an acoustic guitar and also singing into a microphone.](image)Miley Cyrus and Billy Ray Cyrus performing \"Ready, Set, Don't Go\" at a 2009 concert\n*Hannah Montana* includes original music; Disney released albums of songs from the series.[8][23] Miley Cyrus performs as Hannah Montana and sings the show's theme song, \"The Best of Both Worlds\".[8][23] By April 2006, a soundtrack was scheduled for release in the latter half of the year; this would be followed by a studio album by Cyrus the following year.[8] The soundtrack album *Hannah Montana* was released in October\u00a02006; many of the songs' lyrics allude to the show's premise and Miley Stewart's secret identity.[10][48] Songwriter Matthew Gerrard intended to encompass the show's premise in the lyrics of the songs.[49] Jeannie Lurie, another key songwriter, explained that it was important for their team to capture the character's voice and feelings within each song's lyrics.[49] The soundtrack albums *Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus* (2007), *Hannah Montana 3* (2009), and *Hannah Montana Forever* (2010) were released to coincide with their respective seasons. The lyrical themes later became more mature, and reflected storylines from the series such as romantic relationships.[49]\n\n\nThe show's music includes elements of teen pop, pop rock, and country pop genres.[50] Steve Vincent, an executive of Disney Channel music, had previously worked on *The Cheetah Girls* and *High School Musical*, and helped to develop the sound of the projects.[49] Vincent drew inspiration from country pop artists Shania Twain and Carrie Underwood, as well as pop artists such as Kelly Clarkson, to establish Hannah Montana's musical style.[49] The music makes prominent use of acoustic guitars, synthesizers, and backing vocals.[50] \"Ready, Set, Don't Go\", a song Billy Ray Cyrus wrote when Miley was cast, was used in the program.[51] Guest stars, such as singer-songwriter David Archuleta, also contributed to songs on the series.[49]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n*Hannah Montana* was recorded in front of a live studio audience at Sunset Bronson Studios on Thursdays and Fridays.[36] Cyrus was required to attend school on set, while Osment attended an external prep school.[36] While filming the pilot, Cyrus performed a concert as Hannah Montana at Glendale Centre Theatre to acquire footage for the show.[52]\n\n\nProduction of the second season began in Los Angeles, California, in November\u00a02006,[3] and concluded in September\u00a02007.[53] In April\u00a02008, the program was renewed for a third season,[54] which had commenced production by August.[55][56] By this time, Disney had optioned the program for a fourth season.[55]\nThat December, the network ordered another six episodes, extending the third season to 30 episodes.[57] Filming for the third season concluded in mid-2009.[58]\n\n\nThe series also filmed episodes which aired as part of network crossover specials. The first special, *That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana*, aired on July 28, 2006, as a crossover featuring *That's So Raven* and *The Suite Life of Zack & Cody*.[59] The second special, *Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana*, aired on July 17, 2009, and contained episodes of *Wizards of Waverly Place* and *The Suite Life on Deck*.[60]\n\n\n\n### Conclusion and impact on Cyrus[edit]\n\n\n*Hannah Montana* was renewed for a fourth season on June 1, 2009.[12] The new set of episodes has a new setting; the Stewart family move out of their Malibu home to a nearby ranch.[1][12] Billy Ray Cyrus stated this would be the final season and that Miley Cyrus hoped there would be a conclusion to the show's story.[58] Production for the season began in January\u00a02010, when Disney confirmed the program would be officially concluding.[11][13][61] The series finale was scheduled to air in early 2011.[11] As the final season was filmed, Cyrus said she wanted to move on from the series, stating, \"I can't base my career off of the six-year-olds\".[1] She became increasingly uncomfortable wearing the extravagant, colorful costumes associated with Hannah and stated she had \"grown out of it\".[62] In 2019, Cyrus said at the time she felt she had matured beyond working on the series and dressing up as Hannah Montana.[63] The final season premiered on July 11, 2010.[1]\n\n\n\n## Episodes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *Hannah Montana* episodes\n\n| Season | Episodes | Originally aired |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| First aired | Last aired |\n| 1 | 26 | March\u00a024,\u00a02006\u00a0(2006-03-24) | March\u00a030,\u00a02007\u00a0(2007-03-30) |\n| 2 | 29 | April\u00a023,\u00a02007\u00a0(2007-04-23) | October\u00a012,\u00a02008\u00a0(2008-10-12) |\n| 3 | 30 | November\u00a02,\u00a02008\u00a0(2008-11-02) | March\u00a014,\u00a02010\u00a0(2010-03-14) |\n| 4 | 13 | July\u00a011,\u00a02010\u00a0(2010-07-11) | January\u00a016,\u00a02011\u00a0(2011-01-16) |\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nBickford said *Hannah Montana* helped Disney return to a level of commercial success that had been absent since its musical films of the 1990s, and built on the success of the network's programs *Lizzie McGuire* and *That's So Raven*. He explained that *Hannah Montana* adopted a business model of combining celebrity acts with film, television, and popular music for a pre-adolescent audience and compared this model to 1990s teen pop artists such as Britney Spears and NSYNC, who were also marketed to children.[2] Heather Phares of AllMusic described the melodies of the featured songs as strong and Cyrus's vocals as charismatic.[50] Ruthann Mayes-Elma said in a journal article *Hannah Montana* is a wholesome, \"bubble-gum\" television show, and that the use of Miley's catchphrase \"sweet nibblets\" in the place of profanity in the scripts helped solidify the show's family-friendly appeal.[46] *The A.V. Club*'s Marah Eakin found fault with the writing of *Hannah Montana*, criticizing its \"oppressive\" laugh track, and its use of stereotypes.[64]\n\n\nThe series has been examined for its depiction of gender roles and stereotypes. Blue said the series establishes stereotypical femininity as part of girlhood.[65] She explained that the primary female characters, Miley and her alter ego\u2014Hannah, are positioned as post-feminist subjects in a way their representation is confined to notions of celebrity and consumerism.[66] Bickford interpreted the theme song \"The Best of Both Worlds\" as an expression of Miley's choice between her contradictory identities, saying the choice is \"as simple as choosing a pair of shoes\" and that the character is privileged because she has multiple shoes and identities.[17] Blue noted the contradiction of Miley's \"normal life\" being directly influenced by her celebrity status in ways such as financial security and a spacious home; she suggested Miley supports the family financially.[67] Mayes-Elma criticized the portrayal of Miley as an \"airhead\" rather than as a \"strong, agentic girl\",[68] and Blue said Lilly is depicted as a tomboy who does not uphold the femininity Miley represents.[69]\n\n\nIn the book *The Queer Fantasies of the American Family Sitcom*, Tison Pugh analyzed the subtle sexualization present within the characters of *Hannah Montana*, such as Jackson's girlfriend Siena, who works as a bikini model.[7] In a journal article, Shirley Steinberg cites Miley as a character who maintains chastity but wears objectifying clothing.[70] Mayes-Elma said guest stars such as the Jonas Brothers were incorporated by Disney to encourage the viewership of young teenage girls.[71] Pugh stated that the program obscures the divergence between fiction and reality, due to the character of Miley Stewart sharing similarities to Miley Cyrus, Robby Ray Stewart being difficult to distinguish from Billy Ray Cyrus, and guest actors such as Parton and the Jonas Brothers playing fictional versions of themselves.[72] Kennedy added that featuring celebrity guests, such as Leno and his real talk-show *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,* contributed to Miley being placed in the \"real world\" and thus becoming easily confusable with Cyrus.[73] Pugh explained that displaying Miley as an authentic and likable character was a key marketing strategy, which led to Cyrus becoming closely associated with the *Hannah Montana* branding;[74] Mayes-Elma explicated that Disney was selling Cyrus\u2014a then-sixteen-year-old girl\u2014to consumers as a \"form of pop cultural prostitution\".[75] Blue also took note of the intersection between the world of the fictional characters and that of Cyrus.[65]\n\n\n\n### U.S. television ratings[edit]\n\n\nThe series premiere of *Hannah Montana* was aired on March 24, 2006, as a lead-in to a rerun of *High School Musical*, and received 5.4 million viewers.[8][10] This was the highest-rating premiere episode in the history of Disney Channel as of 2006.[10] By April\u00a02006, *Hannah Montana* had an average of more than 3.5 million viewers for each episode, many whom were aged between six and fourteen.[8] The show's most-viewed episode, \"Me and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas\", was aired on August 17, 2007, as a lead-out to the premiere of *High School Musical 2* and was viewed by 10.7\u00a0million people.[76]\n\n\n\n\n\nViewership and ratings per season of *Hannah Montana*\n| Season\n | Episodes\n | First aired\n | Last aired | Avg. viewers(millions)\n

while starring on the network. He said, \"for Miley Cyrus to be a 'good girl' is now a business decision for her\".[24] Cyrus, however, continued to develop an increasingly provocative image as *Hannah Montana* progressed and the series received criticism for appearing to be a negative influence on its younger audience. Pugh writes that the series acted as a natural appendage to Cyrus's \"controversial transition into a sexual provocateur\".[7] Cyrus performed a pole dance the following year during her act at the Teen Choice Awards, later defending it as \"right for the song and that performance\", while Disney representatives did not comment.[120][62] Her suggestive persona continued with the music video for \"Can't Be Tamed\" in 2010.[1] The following year, Cyrus was listed as the worst celebrity influence in a *JSYK* poll voted on by children, following the leakage of a video showing her smoking the psychoactive plant *Salvia divinorum* at the age of eighteen.[121][122] In the journal *Tobacco Control*, Cyrus's high-risk actions were described as a \"turning point\" for how fans perceived her behavior.[123] Cyrus's public image continued to become more provocative and sexualized following the conclusion of the series. After a controversial performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, Melissa Henson of the Parents Television Council said parents would no longer feel comfortable allowing their children to watch *Hannah Montana* due to Cyrus's sexualized stage persona.[124]\n\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus blamed the program for damaging his family and causing Miley's unpredictable behavior.[125] Miley Cyrus expressed her annoyance at her history with the program in 2013, stating she wanted to suppress her previous music and re-establish her career as a mature artist.[126] By 2019, while Cyrus believed many had viewed her as a \"Disney mascot\" rather than as a person during her time working for the company, she said she was proud of her work on the series.[63] She said she would like to play the character of Hannah Montana again.[127] Cyrus explained in 2021 that she found it difficult to separate herself from the persona of Hannah Montana.[38]\n\n\n\n### Revised episode[edit]\n\n\nA second-season episode titled \"No Sugar, Sugar\" was planned to air in the United States on November 2, 2008, but was removed from the schedule after complaints about its subject matter.[128] The episode, in which Oliver is diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, was previewed online; viewers said it presented inaccurate information about the disorder.[129] Some viewers said there was a risk of uninformed children following the episode's health information, while others commended the episode's themes of acceptance and support for diabetics.[129] The network revised the episode after consulting diabetes research-funding organization JDRF and filming new scenes; an updated version of the episode titled \"Uptight (Oliver's Alright)\" was aired during the program's third season on September 20, 2009.[130]\n\n\n\n### Lawsuits[edit]\n\n\nTelevision writer Buddy Sheffield alleged he pitched the concept for a television series titled *Rock and Roland* to Disney Channel in 2001; it would have focused on a junior-high school student who leads a secret double life as a rock star.[131] The initial proposal was unsuccessful, and in August\u00a02007, Sheffield filed a lawsuit against the network based on the similarities between his pitch and *Hannah Montana*.[131] The lawsuit said Sheffield was owed millions of dollars in damages.[131] A trial was scheduled to begin in August\u00a02008, but the case was resolved privately beforehand.[132]\n\n\nIn April\u00a02010, Correll and O'Brien filed a lawsuit against Disney Channel for $5\u00a0million over profits from the program.[32] The pair alleged they were denied their share of profits based on requirements for creators from the Writers Guild of America West.[32] Correll, who also directed a number of episodes, further alleged he was unfairly terminated by Disney in response to giving testimony within the arbitration.[32] By 2016, it was reported the arbitrator found $18 million in under-reported amounts, but the franchise was still operating at a $24 million deficit so no compensation was owed.[133] The pair took their case to open court and claimed they were prejudiced by their arbitrator; in 2018, however, the request to overturn the ruling was refused.[134] Poryes had filed a similar lawsuit in October\u00a02008, but this was ultimately settled.[32][133]\n\n\n\n## Other media[edit]\n\n\n### Films[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Walt Disney Pictures released a concert film, *Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert*, as a three-dimensional film for a limited theatrical run.[135] The film consists of footage of Cyrus performing as herself and as Hannah Montana at a concert during the 2007\u20132008 Best of Both Worlds Tour.[135] It earned a gross of $70.6\u00a0million worldwide.[136] A soundtrack album of the live performances, *Best of Both Worlds Concert*, was released in April\u00a02008.[137]\n\n\nIn 2007, Cyrus reported plans to adapt the television series into a theatrical feature film had commenced, and that she would like to film it in her hometown, Nashville, Tennessee;[138] production began in Los Angeles and Nashville in April\u00a02008.[139][140] *Hannah Montana: The Movie*, was originally scheduled for release on May 1, 2009,[141] but its release was preponed to April 10 that year.[142] The film, directed by Peter Chelsom, follows Miley as the popularity of Hannah Montana begins to take control of her life.[139] It grossed $169.2\u00a0million worldwide.[143] A soundtrack album, *Hannah Montana: The Movie*, was released in March\u00a02009.[144]\n\n\n\n### Merchandising[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *Hannah Montana* home video releases, List of *Hannah Montana* books, and *Hannah Montana* video games\n\nIn December 2006, Disney released its first line of merchandise linked to *Hannah Montana*, which included clothing, jewelry, toys, and dolls; the line of clothing duplicated outfits Hannah wears in the series.[8][145][146] A line of video games was also developed; the first, *Hannah Montana*, was released on the Nintendo DS on October 5, 2006.[147] By February 2008, the *Hannah Montana* franchise had become so profitable Disney convened an \"80-person, all-platform international meeting\" to discuss its future.[24] Disney's 2008 annual report to shareholders listed the brand as one of the leading contributors to growth across the company.[148] MSNBC estimated the *Hannah Montana* franchise was worth $1\u00a0billion by the end of 2008.[148] The program was a commercially successful franchise for Disney Channel.[149]\n\n\n\n### Potential spin-off[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Billy Ray Cyrus had said he wanted to produce a prequel series.[150] *Hollywood Life* reported in 2020 that a potential prequel about Miley Stewart's rise to fame as a pop singer, with another child actor playing the character, was being discussed for Disney+.[5] Billy Ray Cyrus again expressed his interest in being involved, while reports said Miley Cyrus would not be.[5]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\n\n1. **^** Robby Ray Stewart is known to the public under the stage name of \"Robbie Ray\".

Greenwald that aired on Disney Channel for four seasons between October 2007 and January 2012. The series centers on Alex Russo (Selena Gomez), a teenage wizard living on the titular street in the Greenwich Village section of New York City, who undertakes training alongside her siblings, Justin (David Henrie) and Max (Jake T. Austin), who are also equipped with magical abilities. The siblings are trained knowing that one day they will compete to win sole custody of their family's powers. Episodes focus on Alex's challenges in keeping her secret powers hidden while she deals with the social and personal issues of her youth. She frequently uses magic in her everyday life, sometimes irresponsibly, and develops her supernatural abilities over the course of the series. The main themes depicted include family, friendship, and adolescence; the series also contains fantasy elements.\n\n\nThe Walt Disney Company developed the series to follow on from its successful line of comedy series in the 2000s, including *Lizzie McGuire*, *The Suite Life of Zack & Cody* and *Hannah Montana*. It's a Laugh Productions produced the program and it premiered on Disney Channel on October\u00a012, 2007. A made-for-television film adaptation, *Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie* aired on the network in 2009 and was awarded a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program in 2010. The series ended on January\u00a06, 2012, to allow Gomez to take on more mature roles. After its conclusion, the cast returned for a stand-alone television special, *The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex*, in 2013.\n\n\n*Wizards of Waverly Place* enjoyed consistently high viewership in the United States on broadcast television and tie-ins included merchandise, a soundtrack album and video game adaptations. Television critics praised the show for its humor and cast; Gomez's affiliation with the network led to a prominent musical career apart from the program. *Wizards of Waverly Place* won two additional Emmys for Outstanding Children's Program in 2009 and 2012, as well as two Artios Awards from the Casting Society of America for Outstanding Achievement in Casting\u00a0\u2013 Children's Series Programming\u00a0\u2013 between 2009 and 2012. Its series finale was the most-watched final episode of any Disney Channel show.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\n### Story and characters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *Wizards of Waverly Place* characters\n\n![A mid shot of a teenage girl with tied back brown hair, wearing a black, frilled dress. She is posing at a press event and smiling, looking directly towards the camera. Behind her are hoarding signs with names of commercial sponsors.](image)Selena Gomez, pictured in 2009, serves as the program's central focus during its four-season run.\nAlex, Justin and Max Russo are three teenage wizards-in-training living in an apartment on Waverly Place in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, New York City.[1] In his spare time, their father Jerry Russo, a former wizard, provides his children with daily lessons in their secret lair on how to use magic responsibly.[2] Jerry and his wife Theresa run a family business, a sandwich shop designed to look like a subway station, on the ground level of their apartment building.[1] According to the rules of the \"Wizard World\", once they complete their training, the Russo children will compete to determine which sibling will retain their powers permanently and become the sole wizard of the family.[1] Since the other children will eventually lose their powers, Jerry tries to teach them not to become dependent on magic.[2] Jerry descends from a family of wizards and won his own family's competition as a teenager, but relinquished his powers when he married Theresa, who is a mortal. His powers were transferred to his younger brother, Kelbo.[1][2][3] Alex must keep her powers hidden from her best friend, Harper Finkle, which causes an occasional strain on their relationship.[4] Alex reveals her secret to Harper in the second season; however, the existence of wizards must remain hidden to the wider mortal world.[5][6]\n\n\nIn the third season Harper moves in with the Russo family and Max's efforts to win the family wizard competition become more serious.[7] Leading into the fourth and final season Alex and Justin are both tricked into exposing the existence of wizards to government officials and a group of reporters.[8][9] It is revealed that the whole scenario was a test devised as part of their training, and consequently, Alex and Justin are demoted to lower positions in the family competition. Alex is overwhelmed by her loss of progress and quits;[8] she later rejoins to continue dating her werewolf boyfriend, Mason Greyback.[10] Meanwhile, Justin becomes a tutor for a group of delinquent wizards, which assists him in recovering his position in the competition.[11] At the conclusion of the series, the siblings compete to see who will retain their supernatural abilities.[12] Alex wins the family wizard competition and is awarded full magic powers, while Justin is allowed to retain his abilities when he assumes the role of headmaster at WizTech, a boarding school for young wizards-in-training. Max loses his powers but becomes the new manager of the family's sandwich shop, also securing investments from the wizard world.[11][13]\n\n\n\n### Themes[edit]\n\n\nThe series deals with the theme of secret identities.[1][14] It explores the fantasy that children may experience of wanting magical powers, in the same way *Hannah Montana* explores the fantasy of being a pop star.[14][15][16] Series such as *Sabrina the Teenage Witch* and the *Harry Potter* franchise, and a trend towards the fantasy television genre, made stories about children with magical powers popular.[17][18][19] Episodes of *Wizards of Waverly Place* typically show the Russo children using magic to solve an issue in their personal lives quickly, but they learn not to become dependent on their powers, as only one of the siblings is expected to retain them following the family competition.[2] The children try to live normal lives; the show presents the idea that life can be enjoyable without magic.[11][18] Conflicts in the series arise from Alex's struggle to balance both her private and her public life; her identity is built upon the magical powers which she must keep hidden.[20] Scholar Colin Ackerman suggests that the concept of magic in the series is a form of social privilege and the Russo children are encouraged to keep their advantage hidden. He believed that the characters are influenced by consumer-driven values, for things which they are easily able to attain using magic.[13]\n\n\nThe program's stories center on family, friends and growing up. The Russo family is depicted as working class and they run a family business in the service industry. Jerry and Theresa teach their children the significance of family, hard work and responsibility; the characters regularly learn lessons such as the importance of staying true to one's self.[21] Academic Heidi Denzel de Tirado argued that Alex understands the depth of family values only during the wizard competition, when she and Justin decide to set aside their personal success for the benefit of family.[22] The series explores family heritage; the Russo family have a mixed background\u00a0\u2013 Italian, Mexican and American\u00a0\u2013 but their culture is not prominently featured in most episodes, with occasional exceptions such as Alex's quincea\u00f1era.[23] Scholar Morgan Genevieve Blue said Alex is designed to be representative of Latina-American girlhood.[24]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![A long shot of a mid-rise apartment building on the side of the street. The building has gates and trees at its front, with trees leaning over the street and pedestrians walking on the sidewalk.](image)The series is set on Waverly Place in New York's Greenwich Village.\nIn the early 2000s, The Walt Disney Company found success through its pay television network Disney Channel with a pattern of original comedy series for a tween and family audience, such as *Lizzie McGuire*, *The Suite Life of Zack & Cody* and *Hannah Montana*.[15][25] The network planned to build on these successes with a new comedy series aimed at girls.[15][17] *Wizards of Waverly Place* was created by Todd J. Greenwald, who had previously worked on the first season of *Hannah Montana*.[26] He had also worked on a pilot for NBC; Disney hired him after seeing it.[26] Greenwald adopted the network's idea of a show centering on a family of wizards.[26] The series is set in a fictionalized version of Waverly Place in Greenwich Village.[1] Peter Murrieta had worked previously on the sitcom *Hope & Faith* in New York City and had moved to Los Angeles before being approached by Disney to help develop the series.[27] When Murrieta joined the project as an executive producer, it was titled *The Amazing O'Malleys*; he thought they would produce only a pilot.[28] He had never produced a show targeted at a youth audience and was apprehensive about being involved.[27][28] Murrieta helped guide the writing and casting throughout the development process and re-wrote the pilot.[27][29] Adam Bonnett, a Disney Channel programming executive, cited the influence of sitcoms *Bewitched* and *I Dream of Jeannie* on the series.[15]\n\n\nDisney executives first became aware of Selena Gomez at an open casting call in Texas at age twelve,[a][15][30] and she went on to appear in guest roles on Disney Channel programs, including *The Suite Life of Zack & Cody*.[31] The network saw potential in Gomez and wanted her to star in a full series.[30] She filmed two pilots for the network, *Arwin!* (a spin-off of *The Suite Life of Zack & Cody*) and *Stevie Sanchez* (a spin-off of *Lizzie McGuire*); neither of these series were green-lit, but Gomez was ultimately cast in *Wizards of Waverly Place*.[32][33][34] The unaired pilot was set in a magic store and featured only two siblings, twins Jordan and Julia.[35][36][b] The show was green-lit after this pilot.[35] Gomez was attached to the series by February 2007, as well as David Henrie and Jake T. Austin; the characters were named Brooke, Sully and Max O'Malley at this stage.[37] In March 2007 the network officially announced *Disney's Wizards* as an upcoming comedy to premiere in the fall.[38] At the time of the announcement, the characters were named Alexa, Aaron and Max Esposito.[38] Greenwald and Murrieta served as executive producers;[38] Murrieta changed the family's surname to Russo and wrote the children as \"mixed-race\".[28] Gomez appeared in a guest role on *Hannah Montana* as cross-promotion for the new series;[39] *Wizards* would eventually be aired in a timeslot after its peer series.[19]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *Wizards of Waverly Place* characters\n\n![A mid shot of a man with spiked, light brown hair, wearing a brown, leather jacket.

Austin (right, 2011) portrayed Alex Russo's siblings, Justin and Max, throughout the series.\n\nSelena Gomez portrays the central character of Alex Russo. Gomez had left traditional school after the seventh grade and moved to Los Angeles.[40] She sings the series' theme song, \"Everything Is Not What It Seems\".[41] Her band Selena Gomez & the Scene was signed by Disney to their label, Hollywood Records; Gomez subsequently pursued a prominent solo music career.[40] Alex has been described as dark, crass and a jerk, as well as a \"wisecracking underachiever\".[1][11][42] She is characterized by her tomboyish, rebellious and lazy attitude.[1][11][39] Gomez asked for her character to remain edgy to resemble her own style.[39] Jennifer Aniston's portrayal of Rachel Green on *Friends* inspired Gomez, who adopted similar mannerisms while playing Alex.[43]\n\n\nDavid Henrie plays Justin Russo, who is considered to be sarcastic.[17][44] Greenwald described Justin as a nerd, in comparison to Alex's \"tough female character\".[17][44] Henrie wrote two episodes of the series, \"Alex's Logo\" and \"Meet the Werewolves\".[44][45][46] Max Russo is portrayed by Jake T. Austin, who said the character was unintelligent, but becomes slightly smarter toward the end of the series.[12] His character was temporarily transformed into a younger female in the fourth season because of a magic spell; Bailee Madison played the female counterpart, Maxine, while Austin took a hiatus from the program.[9][12][18] Maria Canals-Barrera plays the children's mother Theresa Russo;[18] David DeLuise plays their father Jerry Russo.[5][17] The parents are described by Barry Garron of *The Hollywood Reporter* as loving but \"slightly goofy\".[5] DeLuise and Austin were not featured in the unaired pilot.[35][36] Jennifer Stone portrays Alex's best friend, Harper, who was described as \"comic relief\" by *Boston.com*'s Joanna Weiss.[17][18] Stone had previously auditioned for a Disney Channel pilot called *Bus Life*, which was not picked up.[16] She originally planned to audition for the role of Alex on *Wizards* before being cast as Harper, and stated that she \"fought\" to become a series regular.[36] Guest stars during the course of the series include Bridgit Mendler as Juliet van Heusen, Justin's vampire girlfriend,[18] and Gregg Sulkin as Mason Greyback, Alex's werewolf boyfriend.[9][18]\n\n\n\n### Writing and filming[edit]\n\n\nMurrieta chose to write the Russo family as \"mixed-race\", and he felt that the argumentative relationships between the Russo siblings resembled those of his childhood.[28] Greenwald believed that the brother\u2013sister dynamic was at the heart of the show.[35] Murrieta stated that it was the intention of the creative team for Alex to be openly bisexual, but they were unable to make it explicit at the time. He referred to the guest character Stevie, played by Hayley Kiyoko, as a potential female love interest for Alex.[47] *Wizards of Waverly Place* was filmed at Hollywood Center Studios.[37]\n\n\nThe series was renewed for a third season in May 2009,[7][30] with eight episodes added to the order in September.[48] Murrieta left the program at the conclusion of the third season in April 2010.[29] He later claimed that he was not invited back as the showrunner for the fourth season due to creative differences.[49] The fourth season of *Wizards of Waverly Place* was ordered in June 2010.[50] Vince Cheung and Ben Montanio became the new showrunners and executive producers alongside Greenwald; Gomez announced in July that it would be the final season of the program.[50][51] Austin claimed the series ended to allow Gomez to pursue more mature roles;[52] *The A.V. Club*'s Marah Eakin speculated that Gomez had become more popular than the show itself and it was time for her to move on.[42] The series finale aired on January\u00a06, 2012; the episode depicts the family's wizard competition.[12]\n\n\n\n## Series overview[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *Wizards of Waverly Place* episodes\n\n| Season | Episodes | Originally aired |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| First aired | Last aired |\n| 1 | 21 | October\u00a012,\u00a02007\u00a0(2007-10-12) | August\u00a031,\u00a02008\u00a0(2008-08-31) |\n| 2 | 30 | September\u00a012,\u00a02008\u00a0(2008-09-12) | August\u00a021,\u00a02009\u00a0(2009-08-21) |\n| Film | August\u00a028,\u00a02009\u00a0(2009-08-28) |\n| 3 | 28 | October\u00a09,\u00a02009\u00a0(2009-10-09) | October\u00a015,\u00a02010\u00a0(2010-10-15) |\n| 4 | 27 | November\u00a012,\u00a02010\u00a0(2010-11-12) | January\u00a06,\u00a02012\u00a0(2012-01-06) |\n| Special | March\u00a015,\u00a02013\u00a0(2013-03-15) |\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n*Wizards of Waverly Place* has received positive reviews for its actors and their comedic skills. Marah Eakin felt that it was a positive departure from Disney's typical series, with minimal slapstick humor but still having exaggerated acting.[1] Gomez was praised for her comic timing and sarcastic delivery; the *Los Angeles Times*'s Mary McNamara described her portrayal of Alex as \"sweet and sassy\".[18][53] Additionally, McNamara believed that Justin and Max did not serve as comic relief; Jake T. Austin was called \"absurdly hilarious\" by blogger Mark Robinson.[18][53] The central characters were described as \"cute, precocious, but far from angelic\" by Garron, who said child viewers would want to watch more.[5] In addition to the cast and humor, the series' concept and themes were also praised. Critics suggested that the series capitalized on the success of the *Harry Potter* franchise,[54][18][53] and it was also compared to *Bewitched* for the similarities in their magical elements.[18] It was listed as one of Disney's best sitcoms by Robinson, who wrote that the series combined fantasy and comedy \"seamlessly\".[53] While the fourth season was on air, Eakin said the quality of the series had not diminished, and has a lot of heart, depth and \"actual feeling\".[1] McNamara praised the show for not relying on shtick or its laugh track.[18]\n\n\nSome characters were criticized by reviewers; Paul Asay of Christian website *Plugged In* did not view Alex as a positive role model because of her rebellious nature, and the parents were described as foolish by Weiss.[11][17] Ackerman found fault with the show's contradictory messages, saying there are never consequences for the Russo children abusing their magical powers; he felt that the characters seem to forget the lessons they learn and continue to make the same mistakes. The lessons Jerry teaches about how to live life without magic were interpreted as pointless, as when the series ends, both Alex and Justin retain their abilities.[55] The setting of Greenwich Village was also problematic for Ackerman, as he suggested that the Russos, a working-class family, would not be financially able to live in one of the most expensive New York neighborhoods.[56] The show has been criticized for its predictable premise and supernatural elements, described as \"less magical than milquetoast\" by Weiss.[17] Reviewing the series finale, Eakin criticized the quality of the wizards' robe costuming and the use of a laugh track.[42] Critics have found fault with the program's special effects, such as the computer animation of a griffin.[11][17][42] Asay referred to the program's depiction of angels as \"spiritually misleading\".[11]\n\n\n\n### U.S. television ratings[edit]\n\n\n*Wizards of Waverly Place* premiered on October\u00a012, 2007, on the same night as the network's premiere of *Twitches Too*, and attracted 5.9\u00a0million viewers.[57] The one-hour series finale, \"Who Will Be the Family Wizard?\", aired on January\u00a06, 2012, and became the show's most-watched episode, with an audience of 9.8\u00a0million.[58] It was the finale with the highest rating for any Disney Channel series.[58]\n\n\n\n\n\n*Wizards of Waverly Place* season viewership in the U.S. television market\n| Season\n | Episodes\n | Timeslot (ET)\n | Season premiere\n | Season finale\n | Average viewers(millions)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 21\n | Friday 8:30pm[5] | October\u00a012,\u00a02007\u00a0(2007-10-12)[16] | August\u00a031,\u00a02008\u00a0(2008-08-31) | 4.2[c] |\n| 2 | 30\n | Sunday 8:30pm[59] | September\u00a012,\u00a02008\u00a0(2008-09-12) | August\u00a021,\u00a02009\u00a0(2009-08-21) | 4.54[d] |\n| 3 | 28\n | Friday 8:00pm[48] | October\u00a09,\u00a02009\u00a0(2009-10-09)[48] | October\u00a015,\u00a02010\u00a0(2010-10-15)[9] | 3.94\n |\n| 4 | 27\n | Friday 8:00pm[60] | November\u00a012,\u00a02010\u00a0(2010-11-12)[9] | January\u00a06,\u00a02012\u00a0(2012-01-06)[12] | 3.87[e] |\n\n\n### Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of awards and nominations received by *Wizards of Waverly Place*\n| Award\n | Year\n | Recipient(s) and nominee(s)\n | Category\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ALMA Award | 2008\n | Jake T.

In 2012, however, Austin said it had been canceled because of the maturing careers of the cast.[9][12][50] Berendsen was to write the screenplay.[50]\n\n\nIt was reported in September 2012 that an hour-long television special, *The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex*, would be produced for the network, with Gomez in an executive producer role alongside Cheung, Dan Cross and David Hoge.[115] Gomez, Austin, Stone, Canals-Barrera, DeLuise and Sulkin returned for the special which began filming in October in Los Angeles.[115] The special depicts the Russo family traveling to Tuscany, Italy, to meet with relatives, before Alex accidentally casts a spell which creates a good and evil version of herself.[115] Cheung, Montanio and Berendsen wrote the screenplay, and Victor Gonzalez directed.[115] The special premiered on March\u00a015, 2013, watched by 5.9\u00a0million viewers.[114]\n\n\n\n### Malaysian adaptation[edit]\n\n\nA Malaysian adaptation of the series, *Wizards of Warna Walk*, was produced for Disney Channel in Southeast Asia in 2019.[116] The series ran for 14\u00a0episodes and was filmed at Pinewood Studios in Johor, over two months.[116] Set in Kuala Lumpur, the adaptation was designed to use local actors, music compositions, the Malaysian language and Asian values.[116] Network executives considered adapting other series such as *Hannah Montana*, but ultimately found that *Wizards* resonated the best with test audiences.[116] *Wizards of Warna Walk* was broadcast in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.[116]\n\n\n\n### Merchandising[edit]\n\n\nWalt Disney Records released a soundtrack album for the series on August\u00a04, 2009, including songs from, and inspired by, the series and film.[117] Disney Interactive Studios released two video games based on the series for the Nintendo DS: *Wizards of Waverly Place* in August 2009, and *Wizards of Waverly Place: Spellbound* in November 2010.[118][119]\n\n\n\n### Rumored revival[edit]\n\n\nThe possibility of a reunion series has been mentioned by several main cast members since 2017.[120] In August 2020, Henrie commented that all key actors were open to producing a revival of the series.[121] He clarified that formal discussions with Disney had not yet occurred.[121]\n\n\nIn October 2017, Greenwald said he would like to see *Wizards of Waverly Place* continue with a high-budget feature film in the vein of *Harry Potter*.[35] He also shared an idea for a prequel series which would follow Jerry as he attended WizTech in his high school years, and would feature his siblings.[35] Henrie suggested that the revival could revolve around a disconnected Russo family, several years later, who are all finding success separately but must learn to come together again.[122]\n\n\n\n### Rewatch podcast[edit]\n\n\nIt was teased in December 2022 that DeLuise and Stone would begin hosting a podcast entitled *Wizards of Waverly Pod*.[123] The podcast premiered on February 6, 2023, through the podcast network PodCo owned by Christy Carlson Romano. Gomez was featured as a guest in an episode.[124]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** It has been stated that the casting call was in Austin,[15] as well as Dallas.[30]\n2. **^** Greenwald named the characters after his children, but altered these to avoid confusion with the series *Just Jordan*. He named the character Justin after his own middle name.[35]\n3. **^** This data accounts for only nine of the 21\u00a0episodes of the first season.\n4. **^** This data accounts for only 21\u00a0of the 30\u00a0episodes of the second season.\n5. **^** This data accounts for only 25\u00a0of the 27\u00a0episodes of the fourth season.\n6. **^** The film was credited as the second most-viewed cable TV film broadcast of all time, behind *High School Musical 2*.[114]\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** Eakin, Marah (February 18, 2011). \"*Wizards Of Waverly Place*\". *The A.V.
