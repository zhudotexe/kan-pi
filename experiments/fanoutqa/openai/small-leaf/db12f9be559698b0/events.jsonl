It includes a list of all women who have served in the Senate, a list of current female senators, and a list of states represented by women in the Senate. The first female U.S. senator, Rebecca Latimer Felton, represented Georgia for a single day in 1922, and the first woman elected to the Senate, Hattie Caraway, was elected from Arkansas in 1932. Sixty women have served in the upper house of the United States Congress since its establishment in 1789. As of October 3, 2023, there are 25 women (15 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 1 Independent) serving as U.S. senators.\n\n\nNancy Kassebaum is currently the oldest living former female member of the Senate at the age 91.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| State\n | Current\n | Previous\n | Total\n | First woman senator\n | Years represented by female senators\n | Year first *elected* a female senator\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Alabama | 1 | 2 | 3 | Dixie Graves | 1937–1938, 1978, 2023–present | 2022 |\n| Alaska | 1 | 0 | 1 | Lisa Murkowski | 2002–present | 2004 |\n| Arizona | 1 | 1 | 2 | Kyrsten Sinema & Martha McSally | 2019–present | 2018 |\n| Arkansas | 0 | 2 | 2 | Hattie Caraway | 1931–1945, 1999–2011 | 1932 |\n| California | 1 | 3 | 4 | Dianne Feinstein | 1992–2023, 2023–present | 1992 (special) |\n| Colorado | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| Connecticut | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| Delaware | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| Florida | 0 | 1 | 1 | Paula Hawkins | 1981–1987 | 1980 |\n| Georgia | 0 | 2 | 2 | Rebecca Felton | 1922, 2020–2021 | N / A; both women senators appointed\n |\n| Hawaii | 1 | 0 | 1 | Mazie Hirono | 2013–present | 2012 |\n| Idaho | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| Illinois | 1 | 1 | 2 | Carol Moseley-Braun | 1993–1999, 2017–present | 1992 |\n| Indiana | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn December 9, 2022, Sinema defected from the Democratic Party to become a registered independent, leaving 15 of her fellow women senators from her former party, and on January 3, 2023, Katie Britt, the first Republican woman senator from Alabama and also the first woman ever elected to the Senate from her state, began her term as well, increasing the number to 25 again. The death of Dianne Feinstein on September 29, 2023, brought the number back down to 24. The seating of Feinstein's replacement, appointed senator Laphonza Butler, on October 3 returned the figure to 25.\n\n\nAs of January 2023, four states (Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Washington) are represented by two female U.S. senators. Eleven incumbent women in the Senate are former U.S. representatives: Senators Stabenow, Cantwell, Gillibrand, Baldwin, Hirono, Moore Capito, Duckworth, Sinema, Rosen, Blackburn, and Lummis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHistory of female representation in the US Senate\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on the |\n| United States Senate |\n| ![Great Seal of the United States Senate](image)Great Seal of the United States Senate |\n| History of the United States Senate |\n| \nMembers |\n| * Current members + (by seniority\n\t+ by class)\n* Former members\n* Hill committees + (DSCC\n\t+ NRSC)\n* Women in the Senate\n\n\n\n---\n\n* United States Vice President (list)\n* President pro tempore (list)\n* Presiding officer\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Shelley Moore Capito | Republican | West Virginia House of Delegates, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2015\n(age 62)\n | 1953\n |\n| 1\n | Wisconsin\n | Tammy Baldwin | Democratic | Wisconsin State Assembly, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2013\n(age 51)\n | 1962\n |\n| 2\n | Wyoming\n | Cynthia Lummis | Republican | Wyoming House of Representatives, Wyoming Senate, Wyoming Treasurer, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2021\n(age 66)\n | 1954\n |\n\n\n## List of states represented by women[edit]\n\n\nThirty-three states have been represented by female senators.

This is the second-highest number of women to have served concurrently in the Senate in U.S. history. Fifteen are Democrats, nine are Republicans, and one is an independent.\n\n\nIn January 2019, four new women senators (Blackburn, McSally, Rosen, and Sinema) were seated although two others (Heitkamp and McCaskill) lost reelection bids, so the number of female senators reached 25, at the time with 17 being Democrats and 8 being Republicans. In January 2020, Kelly Loeffler was appointed to the Senate from Georgia, increasing the number of women in the Senate to 26, the highest proportion of women serving as U.S. senators in history.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nClinton joined the Senate in 2001, becoming the first female senator from New York, and served until 2009, when she resigned to become the 67th United States Secretary of State, under President Barack Obama. She was replaced by Kirsten Gillibrand, who has been elected three times and was herself a candidate for president in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.\n\n\nIn 2008, Kay Hagan became the first woman to unseat a female incumbent, Elizabeth Dole. Upon the opening of the 112th United States Congress in 2011, New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen was joined by newly elected Republican Kelly Ayotte, making up the first Senate delegation of two women belonging to different parties.\n\n\nIn November 2022, Dianne Feinstein became the longest-serving female senator in history,[8] surpassing Barbara Mikulski,[9][10] having served for 30 years.[11] Feinstein was retiring at the end of her last term, scheduled for January 3, 2025,[12] but died on September 29, 2023, before her term ended.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSixty women have served in the United States Senate since its establishment in 1789.[17] Cumulatively, 36 female U.S. senators have been Democrats, while 23 have been Republicans and one is an independent. As of 2023, no female U.S. senator has ever won election to the House after her Senate term, resigned from a state governorship for the purpose of a Senate appointment by her successor, also won election as an independent or to represent more than one state in non-consecutive elections, served both seats of a state at different times, or represented a third party in her career. In December 2022, Senator Kyrsten Sinema became the first female senator to switch her party affiliation while in office. In September 2023, Senator Dianne Feinstein became the first female senator to die in office.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  | Maggie Hassan (D)(January 3, 2017–present),2,718 days (7 years, 162 days) |\n| Minnesota\n | January 3, 2018 | Present\n | 2,353 days(6 years, 162 days)\n |  | Amy Klobuchar (DFL)\n |  | Tina Smith (DFL)\n |\n| Nevada\n | January 3, 2019 | Present\n | 1,988 days(5 years, 162 days)\n |  | Catherine Cortez Masto (D)\n |  | Jacky Rosen (D)\n |\n| Arizona\n | January 3, 2019 | December 2, 2020 | 699 days(1 year, 334 days)\n |  | Kyrsten Sinema (D)\n |  | Martha McSally (R)\n |\n\n\n## Elections with two women major-party nominees[edit]\n\n\nIncumbent senators are in bold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![Sen.

Until 1920, few women ran for the Senate. Until the 1990s, very few were elected. This paucity of women was due to many factors, including the lack of women's suffrage in many states until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, women's limited access to higher education until the mid-1900s, public perceptions of gender roles, and barriers to women's advancement such as sex discrimination.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first time two female senators from the same state served concurrently was beginning in 1993; Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer (both D-CA) were both elected in 1992, with Feinstein taking office that same year (as the result of a special election) and Boxer taking office in 1993; Boxer served until 2016, when she retired, and Feinstein was joined by Kamala Harris. In June 1993, Kay Bailey Hutchison won a special election in Texas, and joined Kassebaum as a fellow female Republican senator. These additions significantly diminished the popular perception of the Senate as an exclusive \"boys' club\". Since 1992, there has been at least one new woman elected to the Senate every two years, with the exception of 2004 (Lisa Murkowski was elected for the first time in 2004, but had been appointed to the seat since 2002). \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Serfaty, Sunlen (April 18, 2018). \"Babies now allowed on Senate floor after rule change\". *CNN*.\n23. **^** \"A duckling onesie and a blazer: The Senate floor sees its first baby, but many traditions stand\". *The Washington Post*.

On January 3, 2021, Cynthia Lummis, the first woman senator from Wyoming, began her term, so the number of female senators reached 26 once again. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris was elected Vice President of the United States; she resigned her Senate seat on January 18 in anticipation of the scheduled commencement of her term as Vice President (and thus President of the Senate) on January 20, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. In addition, Loeffler lost the January 5 special election runoff for the remainder of the term to which she had been appointed, and she left office also on January 20, which further reduced the number of women serving in the Senate to 24. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![Sen.

In 2020, Kamala Harris became the first female senator, current or past, to win her vice presidential election bid and become the first female President of the United States Senate in American history.\n\n\n\n## Election, selection, and family[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2001, a plurality of women joined the U.S. Senate through appointment following the death or resignation of a husband or father who previously held the seat. An example is Muriel Humphrey (D-MN), the widow of former senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey; she was appointed to fill his seat until a special election was held (in which she did not run). However, with the election of three women in 2000, the balance shifted; more women have now entered service as a senator by winning elections than by being appointed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Iowa\n | Joni Ernst | Republican | Montgomery County Auditor, Iowa Senate | 2015\n(age 45)\n | 1970\n |\n| 2\n | Maine\n | Susan Collins | Republican | Massachusetts Deputy Treasurer, gubernatorial nominee | 1997\n(age 45)\n | 1952\n |\n| 1\n | Massachusetts\n | Elizabeth Warren | Democratic | Special Advisor to the President for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau | 2013\n(age 64)\n | 1949\n |\n| 1\n | Michigan\n | Debbie Stabenow | Democratic | Michigan House of Representatives, Michigan Senate, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2001\n(age 51)\n | 1950\n |\n| 1\n | Minnesota\n | Amy Klobuchar | Democratic-Farmer-Labor | Hennepin County Attorney\n | 2007\n(age 47)\n | 1960\n |\n| 2\n | Minnesota\n | Tina Smith | Democratic-Farmer-Labor | Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota | 2018\n(age 60)\n | 1958\n |\n| 2\n | Mississippi\n | Cindy Hyde-Smith | Republican | Mississippi Senate, Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce | 2018\n(age 59)\n | 1959\n |\n| 1\n | Nebraska\n | Deb Fischer | Republican | Nebraska Legislature | 2013\n(age 62)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Democratic (DFL) |\n| ![Sen.
