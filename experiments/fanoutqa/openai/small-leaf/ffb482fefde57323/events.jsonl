Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2 billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n† *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation, several attempts have been made. Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses,[31] and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also affect the calculations, both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. *Gone with the Wind*—first released in 1939—is generally considered to be the most successful film, with *Guinness World Records* in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4 billion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile inflation has eroded the achievements of most films from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nT*Guinness*' adjusted total for *Titanic* only increased by $102,000,000 between the 2012 (published in 2011) and 2015 editions, a rise of 4.2% shared by the other adjusted totals in the chart, and omitted the gross from a 3D re-release in 2012.[35][38] This chart incorporates the gross of $343,550,770 from the reissue and adjusts it from the 2013 index.[39] *Titanic* grossed a further $762,994 during limited re-releases in 2017 and 2020, but this sum is not represented in the adjusted total.[40]\n\n\nAEThe gross for *Avengers: Endgame* is adjusted from the 2020 index.\n\n\nTFAThe gross for *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* is adjusted from the 2016 index.\n\n## High-grossing films by year[edit]\n\n\nGlossary: Distributor rentals\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHigh-grossing films by year of release[47][48][49]\n| Year\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Budget\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915 | *The Birth of a Nation* | $50,000,000–100,000,000$20,000,000+R ($5,200,000)R | $110,000 | [# 84][# 85][# 86] |\n| 1916 | *Intolerance* | $1,750,000R IN | $385,907 | [50][51] |\n| 1917 | *Cleopatra* | $500,000\\*R | $300,000 | [# 87][# 88] |\n| 1918 | *Mickey* | $8,000,000 | $250,000 | [# 89] |\n| 1919 | *The Miracle Man* | $3,000,000R | $120,000 | [# 90] |\n| 1920 | *Way Down East* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 91][# 92] |\n| 1921 | *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $600,000–800,000 | [# 93] |\n| 1922 | *Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood* | $2,500,000R | $930,042.78 | [# 94][# 95] |\n| 1923 | *The Covered Wagon* | $5,000,000R | $800,000 | [# 96][# 97] |\n| 1924 | *The Sea Hawk* | $3,000,000R | $700,000 | [# 96] |\n| 1925 | *The Big Parade* | $18,000,000–22,000,000R  ($6,131,000)R | $382,000 | [# 98][# 99][# 100] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt least eleven films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since *The Birth of a Nation* assumed the top spot in 1915. Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInfInflation adjustment is carried out using the Consumer price index for advanced economies published by the International Monetary Fund.[36] The index is uniformly applied to the grosses in the chart published by *Guinness World Records* in 2014, beginning with the 2014 index. The figures in the above chart take into account inflation that occurred in 2014, and in every available year since then, through 2022.\n\n\nA1The adjusted gross for *Avatar* includes revenue from the original release and all four reissues. The original release and 2010 Special Edition grosses are adjusted from the Guinness base year, whilst the 2020 and 2021 grosses are adjusted from the 2021 index and the 2022 gross from 2022.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Gone with the Wind* is likewise represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939–1942 release (roadshow/​general release/​second-run)[86] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to *The Sound of Music* in 1966; its 1971 entry—after it took back the record—includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. *The Godfather* was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and *Jaws* was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. *The Sound of Music*, *The Godfather*, *Jaws*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Titanic* increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013, and 2012, respectively, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of the highest-grossing film record\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Established\n | Title\n | Record-setting gross\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915[64] | *The Birth of a Nation* | $5,200,000R | [# 85] |\n| *1940* | $15,000,000R ‡ | [# 309] |\n| 1940[32] | *Gone with the Wind* | $32,000,000R | [# 135] |\n| *1963* | $67,000,000R ‡ | [# 310] |\n| 1966[64] | *The Sound of Music* | $114,600,000R | [# 210] |\n| 1971[64] | *Gone with the Wind* | $116,000,000R ‡ | [# 311] |\n| 1972[64] | *The Godfather* | $127,600,000–142,000,000R | [# 236][# 312] |\n| 1976[87][88] | *Jaws* | $193,700,000R | [# 251] |\n| 1978[89][90] | *Star Wars* | $410,000,000/$268,500,000R | [# 313][# 236] |\n| *1982* | $530,000,000 ‡ | [# 257] |\n| 1983[91] | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $619,000,000–664,000,000\n | [# 257][# 270] |\n| *1993* | $701,000,000 ‡ | [# 314] |\n| 1993[64] | *Jurassic Park* | $912,667,947\n | [# 73] |\n| 1998[92] | *Titanic* | $1,843,373,318\n | [# 7] |\n| 2010[93][94] | *Avatar* | $2,743,577,587\n | [# 1] |\n| $2,788,416,135 ‡ |\n| 2019[95][96] | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause of release schedules—especially in the case of films released towards the end of the year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTS3Box Office Mojo revised the grosses for Pixar films in August 2016, resulting in the gross for *Toy Story 3* being corrected from $1.063 billion to $1.067 billion.[20][21] This means that it peaked at number 4 at the end of its run, ahead of *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest*, rather than at number 5 as indicated by the source.\n\n## Highest-grossing films adjusted for inflation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada § Adjusted for ticket-price inflation, and List of films by box office admissions\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 10\n | *Frozen II* | $1,450,026,933\n | 2019\n | [# 24][# 25] |\n| 14\n | 14\n | *Barbie* †\n | $1,441,740,954\n | 2023\n | [# 26][# 27] |\n| 15\n | 5\n | *Avengers: Age of Ultron* | $1,402,809,540\n | 2015\n | [# 28][# 21] |\n| 16\n | 15\n | *The Super Mario Bros.

Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 44][# 45] |\n| 26\n | 10\n | *Minions* | $1,159,444,662\n | 2015\n | [# 46][# 16] |\n| 27\n | 12\n | *Captain America: Civil War* | $1,153,337,496\n | 2016\n | [# 47][# 48] |\n| 28\n | 20\n | *Aquaman* | $1,148,528,393\n | 2018\n | [# 49][# 12] |\n| 29\n | 2\n | *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* | $1,147,997,407\n | 2003\n | [# 50][# 51] |\n| 30\n | 24RK | *Spider-Man: Far From Home* | $1,131,927,996\n | 2019\n | [# 52][# 4] |\n| 31\n | 23RK | *Captain Marvel* | $1,128,274,794\n | 2019\n | [# 53][# 54] |\n| 32\n | 5RK | *Transformers: Dark of the Moon* | $1,123,794,079\n | 2011\n | [# 55][# 34] |\n| 33\n | 7\n | *Skyfall* | $1,108,569,499\n | 2012\n | [# 56][# 57] |\n| 34\n | 10\n | *Transformers: Age of Extinction* | $1,104,054,072\n | 2014\n | [# 58][# 59] |\n| 35\n | 7\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* | $1,081,169,825\n | 2012\n | [# 60][# 61] |\n| 36\n | 31\n | *Joker* | $1,074,458,282\n | 2019\n | [# 62][# 25] |\n| 37\n | 32\n | *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* | $1,074,144,248\n | 2019\n | [# 63][# 25] |\n| 38\n | 30\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nF8In the case of *The Fate of the Furious* the gross is from an archived version of Box Office Mojo, after irregularities were discovered in the current figure.

Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2 billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n† *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile inflation has eroded the achievements of most films from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation, several attempts have been made.

Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInfInflation adjustment is carried out using the Consumer price index for advanced economies published by the International Monetary Fund.[36] The index is uniformly applied to the grosses in the chart published by *Guinness World Records* in 2014, beginning with the 2014 index. The figures in the above chart take into account inflation that occurred in 2014, and in every available year since then, through 2022.\n\n\nA1The adjusted gross for *Avatar* includes revenue from the original release and all four reissues. The original release and 2010 Special Edition grosses are adjusted from the Guinness base year, whilst the 2020 and 2021 grosses are adjusted from the 2021 index and the 2022 gross from 2022.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause of release schedules—especially in the case of films released towards the end of the year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Established\n | Title\n | Record-setting gross\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915[64] | *The Birth of a Nation* | $5,200,000R | [# 85] |\n| *1940* | $15,000,000R ‡ | [# 309] |\n| 1940[32] | *Gone with the Wind* | $32,000,000R | [# 135] |\n| *1963* | $67,000,000R ‡ | [# 310] |\n| 1966[64] | *The Sound of Music* | $114,600,000R | [# 210] |\n| 1971[64] | *Gone with the Wind* | $116,000,000R ‡ | [# 311] |\n| 1972[64] | *The Godfather* | $127,600,000–142,000,000R | [# 236][# 312] |\n| 1976[87][88] | *Jaws* | $193,700,000R | [# 251] |\n| 1978[89][90] | *Star Wars* | $410,000,000/$268,500,000R | [# 313][# 236] |\n| *1982* | $530,000,000 ‡ | [# 257] |\n| 1983[91] | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $619,000,000–664,000,000\n | [# 257][# 270] |\n| *1993* | $701,000,000 ‡ | [# 314] |\n| 1993[64] | *Jurassic Park* | $912,667,947\n | [# 73] |\n| 1998[92] | *Titanic* | $1,843,373,318\n | [# 7] |\n| 2010[93][94] | *Avatar* | $2,743,577,587\n | [# 1] |\n| $2,788,416,135 ‡ |\n| 2019[95][96] | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Lightyear* (2022) | $226,425,420\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n\nSShared universes for which some properties also have their own entries.\n\n\n\\*Canada and U.S. gross only.\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* Lists of highest-grossing films\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Prior to the release of *Spectre* in 2015, the James Bond series had grossed approximately $17.7 billion at 2015 prices;[111] after factoring in earnings of over $1.6 billion from *Spectre* and *No Time to Die*, the series has earned at least $19.3 billion adjusted for inflation.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 10\n | *Frozen II* | $1,450,026,933\n | 2019\n | [# 24][# 25] |\n| 14\n | 14\n | *Barbie* †\n | $1,441,740,954\n | 2023\n | [# 26][# 27] |\n| 15\n | 5\n | *Avengers: Age of Ultron* | $1,402,809,540\n | 2015\n | [# 28][# 21] |\n| 16\n | 15\n | *The Super Mario Bros.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons. On the basis of the number of paid admissions, and *continuous* exhibition, its number one position seems justified.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n† *Background shading indicates that at least one film in the series is playing in the week commencing 7 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n**Highest-grossing franchises and film series**[§]\n\n(The films in each franchise can be viewed by selecting \"show\".)\n| \n\n| Rank\n | Series\n | Total worldwide gross\n | No. of films\n | Average of films\n | Highest-grossing film\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Marvel Cinematic Universe*S †* | $29,782,530,744\n | 33\n | $902,500,932\n | *Avengers: Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | The Infinity Saga | $22,587,759,303\n | 23\n | $982,076,491\n | *Avengers: Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time.

Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause of release schedules—especially in the case of films released towards the end of the year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons.

Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2 billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n† *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile inflation has eroded the achievements of most films from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation, several attempts have been made. Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses,[31] and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also affect the calculations, both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. *Gone with the Wind*—first released in 1939—is generally considered to be the most successful film, with *Guinness World Records* in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4 billion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 ‡ | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 ‡ |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n‡Includes revenue from re-releases.

The figures in the above chart take into account inflation that occurred in 2014, and in every available year since then, through 2022.\n\n\nA1The adjusted gross for *Avatar* includes revenue from the original release and all four reissues. The original release and 2010 Special Edition grosses are adjusted from the Guinness base year, whilst the 2020 and 2021 grosses are adjusted from the 2021 index and the 2022 gross from 2022.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt least eleven films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since *The Birth of a Nation* assumed the top spot in 1915. Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Gone with the Wind* is likewise represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939–1942 release (roadshow/​general release/​second-run)[86] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to *The Sound of Music* in 1966; its 1971 entry—after it took back the record—includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. *The Godfather* was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and *Jaws* was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. *The Sound of Music*, *The Godfather*, *Jaws*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Titanic* increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013, and 2012, respectively, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of the highest-grossing film record\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Established\n | Title\n | Record-setting gross\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915[64] | *The Birth of a Nation* | $5,200,000R | [# 85] |\n| *1940* | $15,000,000R ‡ | [# 309] |\n| 1940[32] | *Gone with the Wind* | $32,000,000R | [# 135] |\n| *1963* | $67,000,000R ‡ | [# 310] |\n| 1966[64] | *The Sound of Music* | $114,600,000R | [# 210] |\n| 1971[64] | *Gone with the Wind* | $116,000,000R ‡ | [# 311] |\n| 1972[64] | *The Godfather* | $127,600,000–142,000,000R | [# 236][# 312] |\n| 1976[87][88] | *Jaws* | $193,700,000R | [# 251] |\n| 1978[89][90] | *Star Wars* | $410,000,000/$268,500,000R | [# 313][# 236] |\n| *1982* | $530,000,000 ‡ | [# 257] |\n| 1983[91] | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $619,000,000–664,000,000\n | [# 257][# 270] |\n| *1993* | $701,000,000 ‡ | [# 314] |\n| 1993[64] | *Jurassic Park* | $912,667,947\n | [# 73] |\n| 1998[92] | *Titanic* | $1,843,373,318\n | [# 7] |\n| 2010[93][94] | *Avatar* | $2,743,577,587\n | [# 1] |\n| $2,788,416,135 ‡ |\n| 2019[95][96] | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause of release schedules—especially in the case of films released towards the end of the year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n71. **^** Everson, William K. (1998) [First published 1978]. *American silent film*. Da Capo Press. p. 374. ISBN 978-0-306-80876-0. Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons. On the basis of the number of paid admissions, and *continuous* exhibition, its number one position seems justified.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n† *Background shading indicates that at least one film in the series is playing in the week commencing 7 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n**Highest-grossing franchises and film series**[§]\n\n(The films in each franchise can be viewed by selecting \"show\".)\n| \n\n| Rank\n | Series\n | Total worldwide gross\n | No. of films\n | Average of films\n | Highest-grossing film\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Marvel Cinematic Universe*S †* | $29,782,530,744\n | 33\n | $902,500,932\n | *Avengers: Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | The Infinity Saga | $22,587,759,303\n | 23\n | $982,076,491\n | *Avengers: Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Lightyear* (2022) | $226,425,420\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n\nSShared universes for which some properties also have their own entries.\n\n\n\\*Canada and U.S. gross only.\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* Lists of highest-grossing films\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Prior to the release of *Spectre* in 2015, the James Bond series had grossed approximately $17.7 billion at 2015 prices;[111] after factoring in earnings of over $1.6 billion from *Spectre* and *No Time to Die*, the series has earned at least $19.3 billion adjusted for inflation.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 10\n | *Frozen II* | $1,450,026,933\n | 2019\n | [# 24][# 25] |\n| 14\n | 14\n | *Barbie* †\n | $1,441,740,954\n | 2023\n | [# 26][# 27] |\n| 15\n | 5\n | *Avengers: Age of Ultron* | $1,402,809,540\n | 2015\n | [# 28][# 21] |\n| 16\n | 15\n | *The Super Mario Bros.

Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series.

Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2 billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n† *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile inflation has eroded the achievements of most films from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 ‡ | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 ‡ |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n‡Includes revenue from re-releases.

Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses,[31] and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also affect the calculations, both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. *Gone with the Wind*—first released in 1939—is generally considered to be the most successful film, with *Guinness World Records* in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4 billion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt least eleven films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since *The Birth of a Nation* assumed the top spot in 1915.

When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHigh-grossing films by year of release[47][48][49]\n| Year\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Budget\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915 | *The Birth of a Nation* | $50,000,000–100,000,000$20,000,000+R ($5,200,000)R | $110,000 | [# 84][# 85][# 86] |\n| 1916 | *Intolerance* | $1,750,000R IN | $385,907 | [50][51] |\n| 1917 | *Cleopatra* | $500,000\\*R | $300,000 | [# 87][# 88] |\n| 1918 | *Mickey* | $8,000,000 | $250,000 | [# 89] |\n| 1919 | *The Miracle Man* | $3,000,000R | $120,000 | [# 90] |\n| 1920 | *Way Down East* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 91][# 92] |\n| 1921 | *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $600,000–800,000 | [# 93] |\n| 1922 | *Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood* | $2,500,000R | $930,042.78 | [# 94][# 95] |\n| 1923 | *The Covered Wagon* | $5,000,000R | $800,000 | [# 96][# 97] |\n| 1924 | *The Sea Hawk* | $3,000,000R | $700,000 | [# 96] |\n| 1925 | *The Big Parade* | $18,000,000–22,000,000R  ($6,131,000)R | $382,000 | [# 98][# 99][# 100] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nT*Guinness*' adjusted total for *Titanic* only increased by $102,000,000 between the 2012 (published in 2011) and 2015 editions, a rise of 4.2% shared by the other adjusted totals in the chart, and omitted the gross from a 3D re-release in 2012.[35][38] This chart incorporates the gross of $343,550,770 from the reissue and adjusts it from the 2013 index.[39] *Titanic* grossed a further $762,994 during limited re-releases in 2017 and 2020, but this sum is not represented in the adjusted total.[40]\n\n\nAEThe gross for *Avengers: Endgame* is adjusted from the 2020 index.\n\n\nTFAThe gross for *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* is adjusted from the 2016 index.\n\n## High-grossing films by year[edit]\n\n\nGlossary: Distributor rentals\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInfInflation adjustment is carried out using the Consumer price index for advanced economies published by the International Monetary Fund.[36] The index is uniformly applied to the grosses in the chart published by *Guinness World Records* in 2014, beginning with the 2014 index. The figures in the above chart take into account inflation that occurred in 2014, and in every available year since then, through 2022.\n\n\nA1The adjusted gross for *Avatar* includes revenue from the original release and all four reissues. The original release and 2010 Special Edition grosses are adjusted from the Guinness base year, whilst the 2020 and 2021 grosses are adjusted from the 2021 index and the 2022 gross from 2022.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause of release schedules—especially in the case of films released towards the end of the year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Established\n | Title\n | Record-setting gross\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915[64] | *The Birth of a Nation* | $5,200,000R | [# 85] |\n| *1940* | $15,000,000R ‡ | [# 309] |\n| 1940[32] | *Gone with the Wind* | $32,000,000R | [# 135] |\n| *1963* | $67,000,000R ‡ | [# 310] |\n| 1966[64] | *The Sound of Music* | $114,600,000R | [# 210] |\n| 1971[64] | *Gone with the Wind* | $116,000,000R ‡ | [# 311] |\n| 1972[64] | *The Godfather* | $127,600,000–142,000,000R | [# 236][# 312] |\n| 1976[87][88] | *Jaws* | $193,700,000R | [# 251] |\n| 1978[89][90] | *Star Wars* | $410,000,000/$268,500,000R | [# 313][# 236] |\n| *1982* | $530,000,000 ‡ | [# 257] |\n| 1983[91] | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $619,000,000–664,000,000\n | [# 257][# 270] |\n| *1993* | $701,000,000 ‡ | [# 314] |\n| 1993[64] | *Jurassic Park* | $912,667,947\n | [# 73] |\n| 1998[92] | *Titanic* | $1,843,373,318\n | [# 7] |\n| 2010[93][94] | *Avatar* | $2,743,577,587\n | [# 1] |\n| $2,788,416,135 ‡ |\n| 2019[95][96] | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Gone with the Wind* is likewise represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939–1942 release (roadshow/​general release/​second-run)[86] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to *The Sound of Music* in 1966; its 1971 entry—after it took back the record—includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. *The Godfather* was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and *Jaws* was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. *The Sound of Music*, *The Godfather*, *Jaws*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Titanic* increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013, and 2012, respectively, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of the highest-grossing film record\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Lightyear* (2022) | $226,425,420\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n\nSShared universes for which some properties also have their own entries.\n\n\n\\*Canada and U.S. gross only.\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* Lists of highest-grossing films\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Prior to the release of *Spectre* in 2015, the James Bond series had grossed approximately $17.7 billion at 2015 prices;[111] after factoring in earnings of over $1.6 billion from *Spectre* and *No Time to Die*, the series has earned at least $19.3 billion adjusted for inflation.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n† *Background shading indicates that at least one film in the series is playing in the week commencing 7 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n**Highest-grossing franchises and film series**[§]\n\n(The films in each franchise can be viewed by selecting \"show\".)\n| \n\n| Rank\n | Series\n | Total worldwide gross\n | No. of films\n | Average of films\n | Highest-grossing film\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Marvel Cinematic Universe*S †* | $29,782,530,744\n | 33\n | $902,500,932\n | *Avengers: Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | The Infinity Saga | $22,587,759,303\n | 23\n | $982,076,491\n | *Avengers: Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons.

The total for *Avatar*'s first appearance on the chart includes revenue from the 2010 Special Edition, which represents all of its earnings up to the point it relinquished the record, whereas its second appearance also incorporates revenue from a 2020 re-release in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the 2021 re-release in China which helped it to reclaim the record. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** \"The Fate of the Furious (2017)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

He said, \"The Russos have peculiarly little sense of visual pleasure, little sense of beauty, little sense of metaphor, little aptitude for texture or composition; their spectacular conceit is purely one of scale, which is why their finest moments are quiet and dramatic ones\".[200] Anthony Lane of *The New Yorker* gave the film a compromising review, finding it to be overdeveloped and overwrought, stating, \"The one thing you do need to know about *Avengers: Endgame* is that it runs for a little over three hours, and that you can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won't have missed a thing.\"[201]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as *Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2*, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with *Infinity War*, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, the state of New York, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356–400 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt the 92nd Academy Awards, *Avengers: Endgame* received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.[202] The film's other nominations include an Annie Award (which it won),[203] a British Academy Film Award,[204] and three Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two).[205] It was the most-viewed Wikipedia article of 2019, garnering 44.2 million page views.[206] In March 2020, *Endgame* was ranked 41st in an *Empire* magazine poll for the 100 greatest films of the 21st century.[207] In February 2022, the Avengers assembling moment was named one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment as part of the \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest for the 94th Academy Awards, despite the film not being eligible for other Academy Awards that year.[208]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Six\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019.[133][134] Disney converted the convention center's Hall K for the film's premiere, working with Dolby and QSC Audio to install a 70 foot (21 metres) screen, Dolby Vision projectors, and a Dolby Atmos sound system. The convention center also held the premiere's red carpet arrival and after-party.[134] The film was released in Australia, China, and other parts of Asia and Europe on April 24,[135] in the United Kingdom on April 25,[136] in the United States and India on April 26,[103][135] and in Russia on April 29,[135] in IMAX and 3D.[137][138] It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on May 3.[77] Radio Liberty alleged that the Russian government postponed the film's release in that country to promote Russian-produced films.[139] *Avengers: Endgame* is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[140]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_eLp2QeJRUd5tcl4tGn41k9F7","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The film is the first *Star Wars* film to not extensively involve franchise creator George Lucas, who only served as a creative consultant in the early stages of production. *The Force Awakens* was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original trilogy films *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) and *Return of the Jedi*, rewrote an initial script by Michael Arndt. John Williams, composer for the previous episodic films, returned to compose the score. Principal photography began in April 2014 and concluded the following November. Filming took place on sets at Pinewood Studios in England, and on location mainly in Abu Dhabi, Iceland, and Ireland. On a budget of $447 million, it is the most expensive film ever made.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Box office | $2.071 billion[3] |\n\n\n***Star Wars: The Force Awakens*** (also known as ***Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens***) is a 2015 American epic space opera film co-produced, co-written, and directed by J. J. Abrams. The sequel to *Return of the Jedi* (1983), it is the seventh film in the \"Skywalker Saga\". Set thirty years after *Return of the Jedi*, *The Force Awakens* follows Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron, and Han Solo's search for Luke Skywalker and their fight in the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa and veterans of the Rebel Alliance, against Kylo Ren and the First Order, a successor to the Galactic Empire. The ensemble cast includes Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Max von Sydow.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBeginning in September 2013, production spaces at the Bad Robot facility were converted for shooting of *The Force Awakens* for the benefit of shooting a minor portion of the film in the United States.[114] The film's costume designer was Michael Kaplan, who had previously worked with Abrams on the films *Star Trek* (2009) and *Star Trek Into Darkness* (2013).[115] Film editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon, long-term collaborators with Abrams, were also signed.[116] In August 2013, it was announced that cinematographer Daniel Mindel would be shooting the film on 35 mm film (specifically Kodak 5219).[117] In October 2013, other crew members were confirmed, including sound designer Ben Burtt, director of photography Mindel, production designers Rick Carter and Darren Gilford, costume designer Michael Kaplan, special effects supervisor Chris Corbould, re-recording mixer Gary Rydstrom, supervising sound editor Matthew Wood, visual effects supervisors Roger Guyett, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n187. **^** Cohen, David (February 11, 2014). \"'Star Wars,' 'Avengers' Spawn Industrial Light & Magic's London Expansion\". *Variety*.

A major figure in the post-New Hollywood era, Cameron is considered one of the industry's most innovative filmmakers, regularly making use of novel technologies with a classical filmmaking style. He first gained recognition for writing and directing *The Terminator* (1984) and found further success with *Aliens* (1986), *The Abyss* (1989), *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991), and the action comedy *True Lies* (1994). He wrote and directed *Titanic* (1997), *Avatar* (2009) and its sequels, with *Titanic* earning him Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Film Editing. A recipient of various other industry accolades, two of his films have been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe lets you know exactly how he feels\", but complimented Cameron, \"he's of the lineage of John Ford. He knows what he wants his film to be.\"[185] Sam Worthington, who starred in *Avatar*, said that if a mobile phone rang during filming, Cameron would \"nail it to the wall with a nail gun\".[186] Composer James Horner was also not immune to Cameron's demands; he recalls having to write music in a short time frame for *Aliens.*[187] After the experience, Horner did not work with Cameron for a decade.[188] In 1996, they reconciled their friendship and Horner produced the soundtracks for *Titanic* and *Avatar*.[189]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n93. **^** Mike Fleming Jr (January 20, 2017). \"He's Back!
