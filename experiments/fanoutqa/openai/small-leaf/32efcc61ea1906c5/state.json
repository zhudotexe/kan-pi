Kellogg's also introduced new products, including Crispix, Raisin Squares, and Nutri-Grain Biscuits, and reached out internationally with Just Right aimed at Australians and Genmai Flakes for Japan. During this time, the company maintained success over its top competitors: General Mills, which largely marketed children's cereals, and Post, which had difficulty in the adult cereal market.[15]\n\n\nIn 2001, Kellogg's acquired the Keebler Company for $3.87 billion.[16] Over the years, it has also gone on to acquire Morningstar Farms and Kashi divisions or subsidiaries. Kellogg's also owns the Bear Naked, Natural Touch, Cheez-It, Murray, Austin cookies and crackers, Famous Amos, Gardenburger (acquired 2007), and Plantation brands. Presently, Kellogg's is a member of the World Cocoa Foundation.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** Valinsky, Jordan (March 15, 2023). \"Cheez-It and Pringles company gets a new name\". *CNN*.

Kellogg broke away from his brother and in 1907 founded his own company, the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company (renamed the Kellogg Company in 1922). Kellogg's Corn Flakes eventually overtook Post Toasties in popularity and the latter brand is today only a minor player in the dry-cereal market.\n5. **^** See *International Directory of Company Histories*, Volume 2, pp 530-32, published by St. James Press, 1990, for details relating to the company during this period.\n6. **^** Biographical details of Post's life may be found in *American National Biography*, Volume 7, p. 732.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n40. **^** \"Fortified Oat Flakes Cereal - MrBreakfast.com\". *mrbreakfast.com*.\n41. **^** *Vintage Old 1950s Post Heart of Oats Cereal Commercial*. *YouTube*. 24 July 2013.

Growth accelerated and numerous companies were acquired. In 1947 Nestl\u00e9 merged with Maggi, a manufacturer of seasonings and soups. Crosse & Blackwell followed in 1950, as did Findus (1963), Libby's (1971), and Stouffer's (1973).[31] Diversification came under chairman & CEO Pierre Liotard-Vogt with a shareholding in L'Oreal in 1974 and the acquisition of Alcon Laboratories Inc. in 1977 for $280 million.[31]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Nestl\u00e9's improved bottom line allowed the company to launch further acquisitions. Carnation was acquired for US$3\u00a0billion in 1984 and brought the evaporated milk brand, as well as Coffee-Mate and Friskies, to Nestl\u00e9. In 1986, the company founded Nestl\u00e9 Nespresso S.A. The British confectionery company Rowntree Mackintosh was acquired in 1988 for $4.5\u00a0billion, which brought brands such as Kit Kat, Rolo, Smarties, and Aero.[32]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13 NA rights and specific trade dress to all packaged coffee and other products under the Starbucks brand owned by Nestl\u00e9 since 2019. 14 Brand owned by Mars, sold by Nestl\u00e9 in Canada. 15 Produced by Froneri in the U.S. since 2020.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* ![](image) **Category**\n* ![](image) **Commons**\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRowntree's\n |\n| --- |\n| Parent | * Nestl\u00e9\n |\n| Brands and subsidiaries | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Current | * Fruit Gums\n* Fruit Pastilles\n |\n| Former | * Aero\n* After Eight\n* Black Magic\n* Caramac\n* Gale's\n* Hoadley's\n\t+ Polly Waffle\n\t+ Violet Crumble\n* Hot Sam Pretzels\n* Kit Kat\n* Laura Secord\n* Lion\n* Matchmakers\n* Menier\n* Polo\n* Quality Street\n* Rolo\n* Smarties\n* Tom's Snacks\n* Yorkie\n |\n\n |\n| People | * Henry Isaac Rowntree\n* Joseph Rowntree\n* Seebohm Rowntree\n |\n| Related | * Mackintosh's\n* Rowntree Mackintosh Confectionery\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Commons\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * 1 Currently manufactured by General Mills in the U.S. and Canada.
