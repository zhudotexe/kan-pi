Much of the population is concentrated in the major cities of Dallas\u2013Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio, Houston, McAllen, and El Paso and their corresponding metropolitan areas. The first four aforementioned main urban centers are also referred to as the Texas Triangle megaregion.\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTexas is the second-largest U.S. state in population, after California.[7] The state is also the most populous state in the South Central United States, and the most populous state in the South.[8] Texas' population growth between 2000 and 2010 represents the highest population increase, by number of people, for any U.S. state during this time period. \n\n\nAt the 2020 United States census it was reported that Texas had a resident population of 29,145,505,[1] a 15.9% increase since the 2010 U.S. census. Its apportioned population in 2020 was 29,183,290.[3] At the 2010 census, Texas had a population of 25.1 million\u2014an increase of 4.3 million since the year 2000, involving an increase in population in all three subcategories of population growth: natural increase (births minus deaths), net immigration, and net migration. Texas added almost 4 million people between the 2010 and 2020 census'.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** \"Race and Ethnicity in the United States: 2010 Census and 2020 Census\". *United States Census Bureau*.

Challenges include the state's size, sparse population, and numerous isolated communities.[132] Likewise, the Census Bureau estimated that roughly 43% of the state's population (about 900,000 people) live in such \"hard-to-count\" areas.[132] In response, the New Mexico government invested heavily in public outreach to increase census participation, resulting in a final tally that exceeded earlier estimates and outperformed several neighboring states.[140]\n\n\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 2,560 homeless people in New Mexico.[141][142]\n\n\nIn 2018, In 2018, The top countries of origin for New Mexico's immigrants were Mexico, the Philippines, India, Germany and Cuba.[143]\n\n\n\n### Birth data[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2020 census recorded a population of 2,117,522, an increase of 2.8% from 2,059,179 in the 2010 census.[131] This was the lowest rate of growth in the western U.S. after Wyoming, and among the slowest nationwide.[132] By comparison, between 2000 and 2010, New Mexico's population increased by 11.7% from 1,819,046\u2014among the fastest growth rates in the country.[133] A report commissioned in 2021 by the New Mexico Legislature attributed the state's slow growth to a negative net migration rate, particularly among those 18 or younger, and to a 19% decline in the birth rate.[132] However, growth among Hispanics and Native Americans remained healthy.[134]\n\n\nEstimates from the U.S. Census Bureau found a slight decrease in population, with 3,333 fewer people from July 2021 to July 2022.[135] This was attributed to deaths exceeding births by roughly 5,000, with net migration mitigating the loss by 1,389.[135]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n127. **^** \"Annual Estimates of the Resident Population: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2018 \u2013 United States \u2013 Combined Statistical Area; and for Puerto Rico\".

Centered in Bernalillo County, the Albuquerque metropolitan area includes New Mexico's third-largest city, Rio Rancho, and has a population of over 918,000, accounting for one-third of all New Mexicans. It is adjacent to Santa Fe, the capital and fourth-largest city. Altogether, the Albuquerque\u2013Santa Fe\u2013Las Vegas combined statistical area includes more than 1.17 million people, or nearly 60% of the state population.\n\n\nNew Mexico's other major center of population is in south-central area around Las Cruces, its second-largest city and the largest city in the southern region of the state. The Las Cruces metropolitan area includes roughly 214,000 residents, but with neighboring El Paso, Texas forms a combined statistical area numbering over 1 million.[127]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | *12,783*(55.4%)\n | *12,924*(56.3%)\n | *12,406*(56.6%)\n | *12,354*(57.7%)\n |\n| **Total** | **26,354** | **26,052** | **25,816** | **24,692** | **23,767** | **23,039** | **22,960** | **21,903** | **21,391** |\n\n\n### Race and ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nNew Mexico is one of six \"majority-minority\" states where non-Hispanic whites constitute less than half the population.[153] As early as 1940, roughly half the population was estimated to be nonwhite.[154] Prior to becoming a state in 1912, New Mexico was among the few U.S. territories that was predominately nonwhite, which contributed to its delayed admission into the Union.[155]\n\n\nThe largest ethnic group is Hispanic and Latino Americans, according to the 2020 census they account for 47.7%, which is nearly half of the state's population.

New Mexico's somewhat older population is partly reflective of its popularity among retirees: It ranked as the most popular retirement destination in 2018,[137] with an estimated 42% of new residents being retired.[138]\n\n\nHispanics and Latinos constitute nearly half of all residents (49.3%), giving New Mexico the highest proportion of Hispanic ancestry among the fifty states.

Comprising roughly one-tenth of all residents, this is the second largest population by percentage after Alaska.[157][158] New Mexico is also the only state besides Alaska where indigenous people have maintained a stable proportion of the population for over a century: In 1890, Native Americans made up 9.4% of New Mexico's population, almost the same percentage as in 2020.[159] By contrast, during that same period, neighboring Arizona went from one-third indigenous to less than 5%.[159] New Mexico's population consists of many mestizo Indo-Hispano groups, including Hispanos of Oasisamerican descent and Indigenous Mexican American with Mesoamerican ancestry.[160][161]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNew Mexico is the fifth largest by area of the fifty states, but with just over 2.1 million residents, ranks 36th in population and 46th in population density.[8] Its climate and geography are highly varied, ranging from forested mountains to sparse deserts; the northern and eastern regions exhibit a colder alpine climate, while the west and south are warmer and more arid. The Rio Grande and its fertile valley runs from north-to-south, creating a riparian climate through the center of the state that supports a bosque habitat and distinct Albuquerque Basin climate. One\u2013third of New Mexico's land is federally owned, and the state hosts many protected wilderness areas and national monuments, including three UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the most of any U.S. state.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2021, New Mexico's gross domestic product was over $95 billion,[221] compared to roughly $80 billion in 2010.[222] State GDP peaked in 2019 at nearly $99 billion but declined in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the per capita personal income was slightly over $45,800, compared to $31,474 in 2007;[223] it was the third lowest in the country after West Virginia and Mississippi.[224] The percentage of persons below the poverty level has largely plateaued in the 21st century, from 18.4% in 2005 to 18.2% in 2021.[225][226]\n\n\nTraditionally dependent on resource extraction, ranching, and railroad transportation, New Mexico has increasingly shifted towards services, high-end manufacturing, and tourism.[227][228] Since 2017, the state has seen a steady rise in the number of annual visitors, culminating in a record-breaking 39.2 million tourists in 2021, which had a total economic income of $10 billion.[229] New Mexico has also seen greater investment in media and scientific research.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n219. **^** \"New Mexico\". *Forbes*.
