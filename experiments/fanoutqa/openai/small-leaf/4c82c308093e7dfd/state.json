As provost of Princeton University from 2001 to 2004, she oversaw Princeton's plan to expand the undergraduate student body by 10 percent and recruited professor K.

Under her superb leadership, Penn is a stronger and more vibrant institution than at any time in its storied history.\"[53] In November 2016 Cohen, still Board Chairman, announced that Gutmann's contract would be extended until 2022, making her the longest-serving president ever at Penn.[54]\n\n\nIn 2017, Gutmann's total compensation was $2.9 million, making her the highest paid private college president in Pennsylvania and fourth highest in the United States.[55]\n\n\n\n### United States Ambassador to Germany[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** Gutmann, Amy (1976). *The Egalitarian Tradition: The Foundations and Limits of a Liberal Theory of Equality* (Ph.D. thesis).

It achieved its $3.5-billion target 16 months ahead of its December 31, 2012, conclusion. It was an unusually broad-based campaign, attracting gifts from nearly 327,000 donors.[28] Gutmann is the only Penn president to lead two fundraising campaigns, and since 2004 she has helped raise over $10 billion for Penn.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince arriving at Penn, Gutmann has also spearheaded a major campus development plan, Penn Connects, that includes 24 acres (97,000\u00a0m2) that Penn purchased from the US Postal Service along the Schuylkill River, which opened as Penn Park in September 2011.[44] Penn Connects is designed to boost the economic, educational and social capacity of Philadelphia and to create seamless gateways between West Philadelphia and Center City across the Schuylkill River.\n\n\nPenn began an expansion east of the Schuylkill River with the purchase of the DuPont Marshall Laboratory in September 2010. Gutmann said that the Marshall Lab property has \"infinite possibilities\" as a place to nurture startups and \"technology transfer\", where faculty with \"great discoveries can attract venture capital\" and bring ideas to market.[45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2017, one out of eight incoming Penn students were the first in their families to attend college, up from one out of 20 in 2004.[30] She and her husband Michael Doyle have also funded an endowed undergraduate scholarship and an undergraduate research fund at Penn.[31][32] In 2017, they committed an additional more than $1 million for scholarships, supporting multiple students and matching funds for other donors.[33] In 2020, Gutmann and Doyle donated $2 million to Penn's nursing school to establish leadership scholarships for undergraduates and graduates who are passionate about making lasting impact in underserved urban and rural communities.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. **^** \"#IdeasMatter: Interview with Nicolas Berggruen\".

As a gesture of support for the students' cause, Gutmann joined them in lying on the ground to symbolize the four-and-a-half hours that Brown's body was left lying on the street in Ferguson after his death.[49] Members of the Penn police force publicly responded to the show of support, with the head of the police union writing a public letter criticizing the move and the chief of the police department responding with a letter defending Gutmann's actions.[50][51]\n\n\n\n#### Tenure as president[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, Gutmann announced Penn Compact 2020 initiatives to create up to 50 new endowed professorships utilizing matching donor funds,[35] and to raise an additional $240 million for undergraduate financial aid on top of the $360 million raised for undergraduate aid during the Making History campaign.[36] Additionally, Gutmann announced unique and unprecedented awards for undergraduate students \"with the most promising plans to improve local, national, or global conditions in the year after their graduation\".[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother highlight in innovation is Penn's biomedical research and clinical breakthroughs, approved by the FDA to treat cancer using a patient's own immune system.[22] *The Wall Street Journal* noted that \"Today the university [Penn] lays claim to having incubated the world's biggest cancer breakthrough.\"[23] In addition, it is Penn Medicine researchers who developed the mRNA vaccine technology that is a critical component of Pfizer/BioNTech's and Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines, which are being deployed globally in the fight against COVID-19.[24] A third priority through the Compact is to have an impact locally, nationally, and globally to bring the benefits of Penn's research, teaching, and service to individuals and communities at home and around the world. This is recently illustrated by the University's $100 million commitment to the Philadelphia School District to remediate environmental hazards\u2014the largest private contribution to the School District in its history.[25]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n94. **^** Photographer, Tom Gralish, Staff (November 30, 2018). \"The 2018 Inquirer Industry Icons Awards\". *inquirer.com*.

The $35-million project is about 1 1/2 miles from the center of Penn's West Philadelphia campus. A large, red-letter sign reads \"Pennovation\" over the three-story, 58,000-square foot facility.[46] Pennovation includes an addition that resembles a crystal formation, representing the \"crystallization of ideas\", and architecture critic Inga Saffron says that its unique design \"announces the future\", rather than harkening back to the past.[47] Johnson & Johnson announced in July 2018[48] that Pennovation Works would house J&J's first US-based JPOD, a networking hub that seeks to connect J&J researchers and the local life sciences community. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Eugene M.
