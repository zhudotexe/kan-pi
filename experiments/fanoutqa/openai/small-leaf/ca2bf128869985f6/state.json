A points-based competition founded on six major marathon races recognised as the most high-profile on the calendar, the series comprises annual races for the cities of Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago and New York. In addition, each edition of the series recognises and includes the results of the major global championship marathon held in that year, usually on a one-off lapped course. These races are the biennial World Athletics Championships Marathon, and the quadrennial Olympic Games Marathon.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEach World Marathon Majors series originally spanned two full calendar years; the second year of a series overlapped with the first year of the next. Starting in 2015, each series began with a defined city race and ended with the following race in the same city. So, series IX started in February 2015 at the 2015 Tokyo Marathon and ended there in February 2016 at the 2016 Tokyo Marathon. Series X started at the 2016 Boston Marathon and finished at the 2017 Boston Marathon. Series XI started at the 2017 London Marathon and finished at the 2018 London Marathon.\n\n\nIt began being sponsored by Abbott Laboratories in 2015.[2] On April 26, 2017, Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd., one of the leading Chinese private conglomerates, announced a ten-year strategic partnership aimed at the continued growth and development of marathon events worldwide.\n\n\nBeginning with Series X at the 2016 Boston Marathon, wheelchair competitions were added for men and women.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMarathon running\n |\n| --- |\n| List of marathon races | * \n* Africa\n* Asia\n* Europe\n* North America\n* Oceania\n* South America\n |\n| International competitions | * African Games\n* Asian Games\u200e\u200e\n* Commonwealth Games\u200e\n* European Championships\n* European Marathon Cup\u200e\u200e\n* Olympics\n* Pan American Games\u200e\n* Paralympics\n* World Championships\n* World Marathon Cup\u200e\u200e\n* World Athletics Label Road Races\n |\n| World Marathon Majors\u200e\u200e | * Tokyo\n* Boston\n* London\n* Berlin\n* Chicago\n* New York City\n |\n| Winner lists | * Amsterdam\n* Boston\n* Chicago\n* London\n* New York City\n* Rotterdam\n* Taipei\n* Tokyo\n* World Marathon Majors\n |\n| Years | * 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n |\n| Other lists | * Fatalities\n* Professional marathoners\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Six star finishers** are marathoners who have completed all 6 of the World Marathon Majors. In 2016 following the Tokyo Marathon a Six Star Finisher Medal was introduced[25] In July 2018 a \"Reach for the Stars\" campaign was launched wherein a runner could claim a star for each WMM race completed. The system allows runners to create a profile, search for their \u2018stars\u2019 and add them to their page.[26]\n\n\nFollowing the WMM Series XI in April 2018, the verified total of Six Star Finishers was 3,786.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* World Athletics Label Road Races\n* List of World Athletics Label marathon races\n* List of final standings of the World Marathon Majors\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** \"World Marathon Majors statement\".

It is traditionally held on Patriots' Day, the third Monday of April.[1] Begun in 1897, the event was inspired by the success of the first marathon competition in the 1896 Summer Olympics.[2] The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon and ranks as one of the world's best-known road racing events. It is one of six World Marathon Majors. Its course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston.\n\n\nThe Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) has organized this event annually since 1897,[3] including a \"virtual alternative\" after the 2020 road race was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race has been managed by DMSE Sports since 1988. Amateur and professional runners from all over the world compete in the Boston Marathon each year, braving the hilly Massachusetts terrain and varying weather to take part in the race.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Marathon | * Barcelona\n* Dubai\n* Hong Kong\n* New Taipei\n* Rotterdam\n* Taipei\n |\n\n |\n| Elite | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 50K ultramarathon | * Gqeberha\n |\n| Marathon | * Abu Dhabi\n* Bali\n* Doha\n* Guadalajara\n* H\u014dfu\n* Ottawa\n* Riyadh\n* Toronto\n |\n| Half marathon | * Bogot\u00e1\n |\n| 10K | * Bra\u0219ov\n* Port-Gentil\n |\n\n |\n| Label | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Marathon | * Astana\n* Bratislava\n* Castell\u00f3n\n* Cholpon-Ata\n* Durban\n* \u0130zmir\n* Kigali\n* Libreville\n* M\u00e1laga\n* Rabat\n* Riga\n* Rio de Janeiro\n* Tashkent\n* Tunis\n |\n| Half marathon | * M\u00e1laga\n* Riga\n* Warsaw\n |\n| 10K | * Castell\u00f3n\n* Valencia\n |\n\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * Germany\n* United States\n* Czech Republic\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Gibbs, Roberta \"Bobbi\". \"Roberta \"Bobbi\" Gibb - A Run of One's Own\".

Organized by the British Sports Association for the Disabled (BASD), 19 people competed and 17 finished. Gordon Perry of the United Kingdom won the Men's Wheelchair Race, coming in at 3:20:07, and Denise Smith, also of the UK, won the Women's Wheelchair Race in 4:29:03.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince 2006, the elite race has been part of the World Marathon Majors, which includes six of the world's top level marathon races. The London Marathon has seen the marathon world record broken on seven occasions: Khalid Khannouchi broke the men's record in 2002, while women's records have been broken by Grete Waitz (1983), Ingrid Kristiansen (1985), Paula Radcliffe (2002, 2003, 2005) and Mary Jepkosgei Keitany (2017). The current elite course records are held by Kelvin Kiptum (2:01:25 in 2023) and Paula Radcliffe (2:15:25 in 2003). The current wheelchair course records are held by Marcel Hug (1:23:44 in 2023) and Catherine Debrunner (1:38:24 in 2022).

After that, it winds west between Kreuzberg and Neuk\u00f6lln, through Sch\u00f6neberg, over to Friedenau and Zehlendorf, before turning north back toward the city's center. Looping above Sch\u00f6neberg, the course comes full circle as it finishes through the Gate.[11]\n\n\nThere have been two other major international marathons in Berlin. At the 1936 Olympic Games and at the 2009 IAAF World Championships, both using different routes. A marathon in Berlin on 14 Oct 1973 was won by Ulrich Hutmacher (GER) with a time of 2:19:32, but that race is not considered to be part of the Berlin Marathon series.\n\n\n\n## Sponsors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 50K ultramarathon | * Gqeberha\n |\n| Marathon | * Abu Dhabi\n* Bali\n* Doha\n* Guadalajara\n* H\u014dfu\n* Ottawa\n* Riyadh\n* Toronto\n |\n| Half marathon | * Bogot\u00e1\n |\n| 10K | * Bra\u0219ov\n* Port-Gentil\n |\n\n |\n| Label | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Marathon | * Astana\n* Bratislava\n* Castell\u00f3n\n* Cholpon-Ata\n* Durban\n* \u0130zmir\n* Kigali\n* Libreville\n* M\u00e1laga\n* Rabat\n* Riga\n* Rio de Janeiro\n* Tashkent\n* Tunis\n |\n| Half marathon | * M\u00e1laga\n* Riga\n* Warsaw\n |\n| 10K | * Castell\u00f3n\n* Valencia\n |\n\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMarathon races in Germany\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n | * Berlin\n* Brocken (Harz)\n* Cologne\n* D\u00fcsseldorf\n* Essen\n* Frankfurt\n* Hamburg\n* Hannover\n* Kassel\n* Leipzig\n* M\u00fcnster\n* Munich\n* Rhein-Ruhr (Duisburg)\n | ![](image)\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * Germany\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of marathon races in Europe\n* Sport in Berlin\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The event was cancelled in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.[3]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** h:m:s\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 10,574\n | 876\n | 92%\n | 8%\n |\n| 1985\n | 9,810\n | 9,146\n | 664\n | 93%\n | 7%\n |\n| 1984\n | 7,297\n | 6,875\n | 422\n | 94%\n | 6%\n |\n| 1983\n | 5,121\n | 4,886\n | 235\n | 95%\n | 5%\n |\n| 1982\n | 3,448\n | 3,318\n | 130\n | 96%\n | 4%\n |\n| 1981\n | 2,567\n | 2,418\n | 149\n | 94%\n | 6%\n |\n| 1980\n | 294\n | 276\n | 18\n | 94%\n | 6%\n |\n| 1979\n | 222\n | 207\n | 15\n | 93%\n | 7%\n |\n| 1978\n | 197\n | 187\n | 10\n | 95%\n | 5%\n |\n| 1977\n | 230\n | 219\n | 11\n | 95%\n | 5%\n |\n| 1976\n | 311\n | 296\n | 15\n | 95%\n | 5%\n |\n| 1975\n | 236\n | 232\n | 4\n | **98%** | 2%\n |\n| 1974\n | 244\n | 234\n | 10\n | 96%\n | 4%\n |\n\n\n## Elite race[edit]\n\n\n![World record winner Tigst Assefa (left) about 25\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) into the 2023 Berlin Marathon, alongside pacemaker Girmay Birhanu Gebru](image)\n\nWorld record winner Tigst Assefa (left) about 25\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) into the 2023 Berlin Marathon, alongside pacemaker Girmay Birhanu Gebru\n\n### World records[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nPatrick Makau Musyoki and Irina Mikitenko in 2011\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

While marathons sporadically occurred in New York City and St. Louis,[12] the Boston Marathon had established an annual marathon in 1897, soon to be followed by a Chicago annual race.[13] Beginning in 1905,[14] the Chicago Marathon (organized first by the Illinois Athletic Club 1905 to 1909, then sponsored by the *Chicago Daily News* after 1910) was held annually, with significant community and spectator support, until the early 1920s.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Marathon | * Amsterdam\n* Berlin\n* Boston\n* Chicago\n* London\n* Nagoya\n* New York City\n* Osaka Women's\n* Seoul\n* Shanghai\n* Sydney\n* Tokyo\n* Valencia\n* Xiamen\n |\n| Half marathon | * Bangsaen\n* Guadalajara\n |\n\n |\n| Gold | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Marathon | * Barcelona\n* Dubai\n* Hong Kong\n* New Taipei\n* Rotterdam\n* Taipei\n |\n\n |\n| Elite | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 50K ultramarathon | * Gqeberha\n |\n| Marathon | * Abu Dhabi\n* Bali\n* Doha\n* Guadalajara\n* H\u014dfu\n* Ottawa\n* Riyadh\n* Toronto\n |\n| Half marathon | * Bogot\u00e1\n |\n| 10K | * Bra\u0219ov\n* Port-Gentil\n |\n\n |\n| Label | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Marathon | * Astana\n* Bratislava\n* Castell\u00f3n\n* Cholpon-Ata\n* Durban\n* \u0130zmir\n* Kigali\n* Libreville\n* M\u00e1laga\n* Rabat\n* Riga\n* Rio de Janeiro\n* Tashkent\n* Tunis\n |\n| Half marathon | * M\u00e1laga\n* Riga\n* Warsaw\n |\n| 10K | * Castell\u00f3n\n* Valencia\n |\n\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt was not until the health consciousness of the 1960s that marathon growth gained traction in the public's eyes. Frank Shorter's 1972 Games of the XX Olympiad marathon victory represented the convergence of many middle-class American ideals.[18] Then the 1976 New York City Marathon, which was the first New York City Marathon to embrace the five borough course, popularized the big city marathon. As the New York marathon began to grow exponentially in the 1970s, the Chicago Marathon was established as a rival to the New York City Marathon.[3] By the mid-1980s, the Chicago Marathon was ensconced as one of the big four marathons.[19] During the mid-1980s, it was named America's Marathon/Chicago and opened up the way for appearance payments. Joan Benoit Samuelson described the Chicago Marathons of the mid-1980s as \"The World's Marathon\".[20] The Bank of America Chicago Marathon is an open race with no qualifying time to participate.[6]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** \"Course & Amenities\".

Professional women runners were given a separate, earlier start and the balance of the runners began in three staggered starts. The official times are those recorded by a computer chip attached to the back of the runner's bib number, which calculates when a runner crosses the start and when she crosses the finish, known as \"net time\" (as opposed to \"gun time\").\n\n\nRunners also pass timing mats at 5\u00a0km intervals along the course, and e-mail notifications can be received by people following runners during the race to track their progress. Although the marathon publicity material uses miles, the timing mats are at 5\u00a0km intervals to accommodate the publishing of splits and also enabling potential world records for 20\u00a0km, 30\u00a0km and other sub-marathon distances to be recorded.\n\n\n\n### Different initial routes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"November in New York City Weather and Event Guide\".

Each year nearly two million spectators line the course. Before 2013, the marathon was broadcast live in the New York area on WNBC and on Universal Sports for the entire country; however, in 2013, WABC-TV and ESPN announced they would begin broadcasting the New York City Marathon. Since 2022, the marathon has also been aired in Spanish via ESPN Deportes.[11] The Marathon can also be watched online.[12][13]\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n### Initial course[edit]\n\n\nThe race was founded by Fred Lebow. Ted Corbitt helped plan the course of the New York City Marathon.[14] The initial course of 1970 consisted of repeated racing around Central Park.[15] As per Ted Corbitt, who measured the original course:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican race\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| New York City Marathon |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)The TCS New York City Marathon logo\n |\n| Date | First Sunday in November[1] |\n| Location | New York City, U.S. |\n| Event type | Road |\n| Distance | Marathon26.219 miles (42.195\u00a0km) |\n| Primary sponsor | TCS (since 2013)[2] |\n| Established | 1970, 54 years ago |\n| Course records | 2:04:58 Tamirat Tola (2023)2:22:31 Margaret Okayo (2003) |\n| Official site | www.nycmarathon.org |\n\n\nThe **New York City Marathon**, currently branded as the **TCS New York City Marathon** for sponsorship reasons, is an annual marathon (42.195\u00a0km or 26.219\u00a0mi) that courses through the five boroughs of New York City.

It was the final race of the 2006\u20132007 World Marathon Majors, a two-year series of elite marathon racing that also included the Boston, Chicago, London and Berlin marathons. However, there were very few elite American marathoners participating in 2007 because many had competed the day before at the 2008 USA Men's Olympic Marathon Trials, which was held in conjunction with the New York City Marathon on some of the same course.\n\n\nMartin Lel from Kenya won the men's race in a time of 2:09:04, completing a double of the 2007 London and New York Marathons.
