During January\u2013July 2018, T-Series earned an income of \u20b9720 crore (equivalent to \u20b9895\u00a0crore or US$110\u00a0million in 2023) from YouTube.[56] Online revenue contributes to at least 60% of the company's overall revenue.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a film production company, T-Series has had some moderate success. The highest-grossing T-Series film production to date is the critically acclaimed sleeper hit *Hindi Medium* (2017), written by Zeenat Lakhani, directed by Saket Chaudhary, and starring Irrfan Khan and Saba Qamar.[39] It grossed \u20b9322.4 crore ($44 million) worldwide,[40] with $34 million in China alone,[41] becoming one of the top 20 highest-grossing Indian films of all time.[42] One of the most expensive Indian films was T-Series's *Saaho*,[43] a sci-fi thriller with a production budget of \u20b9300 crore (equivalent to \u20b9373\u00a0crore or US$45\u00a0million in 2023), released in 2019.[44][45]\n\n\n\n##  YouTube presence[edit]\n\n\nSee also: PewDiePie vs T-Series\n\nT-Series joined YouTube on 13 March 2006, but only started uploading videos in late 2010.

More recently, the channel's overseas viewership has increased further, as a result of attention and controversy drawn to the channel by foreign YouTubers such as PewDiePie and MrBeast.[2] On 22 February 2019 at 6:04 AM, T-Series surpassed PewDiePie for the first time to become the most-subscribed YouTube channel, with PewDiePie regaining the spot 8 minutes later. T-Series overtook PewDiePie in a similar manner many more times over the following weeks, and on 27 March, finally gained and maintained, until 1 April, the top spot by a fluctuating, but overall growing, margin.[69][70]\n\n\n\n## Legal issues[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** \"Compare T-series and Mr. Beast YouTube Statistics (By Social Blade)\". *Social Blade*.

India currently has 500 million Internet users and this number is expected to grow rapidly.[67] A major breakthrough in India's Internet growth came in September 2016 with the advent of 4G network Reliance Jio, offering data at very low costs.[15] India has since emerged as the world's second-largest online population (behind China, where YouTube is blocked), with YouTube alone having over 225 million monthly Indian users. India's high demand for YouTube content and the lack of local content creators has contributed significantly to the rapid growth of T-Series.[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n66. **^** Desk, India com Buzz (20 April 2019). \"Punjabi Singer Guru Randhawa Grooves to His Latest Hit Track 'Slowly Slowly' as he Celebrates The Success of The Peppy Song\". *India.com*.

Cocomelon specializes in 3D animation videos of both traditional nursery rhymes and their own original children's songs.\n\n\n\n\n## Content[edit]\n\n\nCocomelon's videos feature children, adults, and animals who interact with each other in daily life. The lyrics appear at the bottom of the screen in the same way on all displays. In 2020, Treasure Studio added Cocomelon content to Netflix, Roku, and Hulu.[2][3] The company also delivers music through popular streaming services.[4] YouTube's content consists of standalone music videos, compilations, and livestreams.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Videos[edit]\n\n\n#### checkgate aka ThatsMeOnTV.com (2006\u20132013)[edit]\n\n\nOn September 1, 2006, Cocomelon was created on YouTube to provide free education and entertainment for the founder of Cocomelon, Jay Jeon, his wife, his children. Then known as \"checkgate\",[5] the channel uploaded two versions of the alphabet song to YouTube on their first day.[6] The channel uploaded their third video 9 months later, titled \"Learning ABC Alphabet \u2013 Letter \"K\" \u2014 Kangaroo Game\". Most videos on the channel taught the alphabet, with a typical length of between one and two minutes.\n\n\n\n#### ABC Kid TV (2013\u20132018)[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, after several years of making content for Jay Jeon's children, Treasure Studio began the ABC Kid TV era which introduced a new intro and logo to start a fresh new look to expand their brand. The logo showed a TV with a ladybug in the upper left corner. The channel began remastering older videos, followed by a transition from alphabet videos to nursery rhymes and longer video lengths. Within a few years, the channel introduced computer animation, with their first 3D character being used in *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star* on April 8, 2016. The video featured a 3D flying star guiding 2D characters through the sky. Towards the end of 2016, 3D animation video uploads became more frequent and longer, with some videos using motion capture technology. Animation and music production continued to modernize, and a recurring cast of characters formed before the 2018 rebrand. [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Cocomelon (2018\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nIn summer 2018, the channel rebranded again to Cocomelon, introducing a new intro and outro to all their videos. They also added the logo of a watermelon stylized to resemble a traditional box TV, while retaining the ladybug as part of the opening and closing sequences.\n\n\nIn April 2019, *The Wall Street Journal* estimated Cocomelon's yearly ad revenue at $120 million.[7] In late 2020, Cocomelon added content in Spanish and Portuguese.[8][9] Early in 2021, they also added Mandarin Chinese, German, and Arabic.[10][11][12]\n\n\nNina Reyes, who first appeared on the show in 2019, got her own show *Nina's Familia*, a bilingual series following the format of the original, with educational songs and nursery rhymes. The spinoff, to start September 29, 2023, was intended both for children who knew Spanish and for those who did not, and care was taken to make sure Latino culture was well represented.[13]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Jeon sold his company, Treasure Studio, to Moonbug, which had been founded just two years earlier.[14] Moonbug expanded the show to more audiences, inking deals with platforms in South Korea, China, and Europe. \n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2020, the company's chief executive announced plans to introduce toys based on these characters and has mentioned the possibility of a feature-length film. The toys are expected to include plush dolls and toy vehicles, with an anticipated rollout date in the fall of 2020.[15] Shipment of some toys was later announced for August.[16][17] In December, the company began selling apparel through their website directly.[18]\n\n\n\n### Rise in popularity[edit]\n\n\nAfter nine years on YouTube, Cocomelon reached 1 million subscribers on May 16, 2016. Half a month later, the channel reached one billion total views. The following two years continued to grow with nearly 400,000 subscribers per month to ten million subscribers, and the channel reached seven billion total views. They started increasing rapidly with the release of \"Yes Yes\" Bedtime Song, a video in which TomTom has to use stuffed animals to get JJ to prepare for bed, which was released in July 2017 and became their most viewed video, currently over 1 billion views.\n\n\nCocomelon had the second-largest YouTube channel subscriptions gain in 2019 with an increase of over 36 million, ending the year on 67.4 million in channel subscriptions.[19] In 2018, YouTube's algorithm recommended Cocomelon's video \"Bath Song + More Nursery Rhymes & Kids Songs\" 650 times \"among the 696,468 suggestions that Pew Research Center tracked\" making it the most recommended video on YouTube.[20] As of September 2020, that video has received over 3.2 billion views on YouTube, making it the 19th-most viewed video on the site.[21] In addition, their second-most popular video, \"Yes Yes Vegetables Song\", has received over 2.5 billion views, making it the 36th-most viewed video on the site.[21]\n\n\nBetween May and June 2019, Cocomelon received 2.5 billion total views, averaging 83 million daily viewers. Comparatively, the \"major four TV broadcast networks averaged just 13 million viewers daily during the TV season\".[22] In July 2019, YouTube changed its algorithm after the Federal Trade Commission raised concerns over child safety. Several children's channels were affected, including Cocomelon, which \"dropped from 575 million total views the week before the change, to 436 million the week of, to 307 million the week after, and 282 million the week after that\".[23]\n\n\nOn December 12, 2020, Cocomelon became the third YouTube channel in the world to get 100 million subscribers.\n\n\nCocomelon's videos also achieved popularity outside YouTube; in September 2020 Netflix ranked *Cocomelon* as its third most popular show.[24]\n\n\nCocomelon was ranked #1 on Reelgood's list of Netflix shows for 2020, ahead of *The Office* and *The Queen's Gambit*.[25]\n\n\nIt was predicted Cocomelon would surpass PewDiePie at some point in April\u2013May 2021, becoming the second-most subscribed YouTube channel.[26][27][28] In response to this, PewDiePie released \"Coco,\" a diss track targeted at Cocomelon on February 14, 2021. The video was removed from YouTube shortly after its upload. YouTube cited its harassment and cyberbullying policy as the reason for the video being taken down.[29][30] Two months later, on April 25, 2021, Cocomelon surpassed PewDiePie as predicted. The song remains on major streaming platforms.\n\n\nCocomelon has been involved in the Riyadh Season 2021 show in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where the companies Spacetoon Event and Moonbug Entertainment collaborated with the Saudi General Entertainment Authority to bring the Cocomelon Town show for 3 months.[31][32]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2023, Netflix released a teaser for a new original series based on the franchise titled *Cocomelon Lane*. It is set to debut on Netflix on November 17, 2023.\n\n\n\n## Telecast[edit]\n\n\nCocomelon has aired on Universal Kids since June 21, 2021, and Cartoon Network's Cartoonito block since January 31, 2022.[33] Cocomelon also premiered on SAB TV in Pakistan on March 29, 2021,[*citation needed*] Cartoonito in the United Kingdom on April 4, 2021, BBC iPlayer in the United Kingdom on June 18, 2021, Tiny Pop in the United Kingdom on November 15, 2021, TV5 in the Philippines as part of Moonbug Kids since September 2022, and Gulli in France since November 7, 2022.[34] Cocomelon also airs on RT\u00c9 Jr Radio.\n\n\n\n### Netflix Original series[edit]\n\n\nNetflix has been airing CoComelon episodes as acquired programming but starting with season 6 the show gained the Netflix Original billing.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.overall | No. inseason | Title | Original release date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Season 6** |\n| 1 | 1 | \"Fun with Family and Friends\" | September\u00a05,\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-09-05) |\n| **Season 7** |\n| 2 | 1 | \"It's Cody Time\" | February\u00a015,\u00a02023\u00a0(2023-02-15) |\n| 3 | 2 | \"Happy Days\" | February\u00a015,\u00a02023\u00a0(2023-02-15) |\n| 4 | 3 | \"Wild Imagination\" | February\u00a015,\u00a02023\u00a0(2023-02-15) |\n| **Season 8** |\n| 5 | 1 | \"Learning with JJ\" | April\u00a010,\u00a02023\u00a0(2023-04-10) |\n\n\n## Concerns[edit]\n\n\nNews media have expressed concern over the anonymous nature of the channel and its visually intense content.\n\n\n\n### Identity of original owners[edit]\n\n\nCocomelon's website has described the company as having 20 employees.[6] When *The Wall Street Journal* attempted to find out who creates Cocomelon videos, they were unable to contact Treasure Studio, which owns the channel.[35] *Wired* magazine located a couple in Irvine, California who seemed to have some ties with Treasure Studio but was unable to confirm that they owned the channel.[36] In February 2020, *Bloomberg Businessweek* identified a couple from Orange County, California as the owners of Treasure Studio and Cocomelon.[37] In mid-2020, Cocomelon was purchased by the children's new media conglomerate Moonbug.[17] In 2022, Moonbug was itself acquired by Candle Media, owned by two former Disney executives.[38]\n\n\n\n### Content[edit]\n\n\nThe *New York Times* has discussed Cocomelon's focus on maintaining children's attention. Jordy Kaufman, a media researcher who runs the Babylab research facility at the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia was quoted as saying that the effect of screen time on child development is \"a big question without clear answers.\"[38]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 August 2023, Moonbug Entertainment was awarded US$23.4 million in a copyright case involving against Fuzhou-based company BabyBus, accused of \"blatantly copying\" Cocomelon videos.[39]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of most-subscribed YouTube channels\n* List of most-viewed YouTube channels\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"About Cocomelon - Nursery Rhymes\".
