Balochistan, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan provinces lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian Plate on the Iranian Plateau. Sindh, Punjab and Azad Jammu & Kashmir provinces lie on the north-western edge of the Indian plate in South Asia.

The yellow star is the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.\nThis is a **List of earthquakes in China**, part of the series of lists of disasters in China. China has been the location of some of the most deadly earthquakes in history. The deadliest was the 1556 Shaanxi Earthquake with 830,000 deaths.[1] Earthquakes in the loess plateau where residents lived in yaodong caves tended to have big casualties, including the 1303 Hongdong and 1920 Haiyuan earthquakes. The most recent earthquake with a death toll of more than a thousand was the 2010 Yushu earthquake, which killed 2,698.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1976-07-27 | 1976 Tangshan earthquake | 39°38′N 118°06′E﻿ / ﻿39.63°N 118.10°E﻿ / 39.63; 118.10 | Tangshan, Hebei | 7.5 MW | 300,000+[1] | Deadliest earthquake in Chinese history.
