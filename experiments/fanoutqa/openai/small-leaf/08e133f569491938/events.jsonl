In the round-robin stage, he defeated Alexander Zverev, Marin Čilić, and John Isner without dropping a set. In the semifinals, he defeated Kevin Anderson to reach his seventh final at the tournament but was upset by Zverev.[283] At the 2018 Mubadala Championship, he scored victories over Karen Khachanov & Kevin Anderson to win the title.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1992: Jim Courier (AO&FO)\n* 1993: Pete Sampras (WI&US)\n* 1994: Pete Sampras (AO&WI)\n* 1995: Pete Sampras (WI&US)\n* 1997: Pete Sampras (AO&WI)\n* 1999: Andre Agassi (FO&US)\n* 2005: Roger Federer (WI&US)\n* 2008: Rafael Nadal (FO&WI)\n* 2009: Roger Federer (FO&WI)\n* 2013: Rafael Nadal (FO&US)\n* 2016: Novak Djokovic (AO&FO)\n* 2017: Roger Federer (AO&WI)\n* 2017: Rafael Nadal (FO&US)\n* 2018: Novak Djokovic (WI&US)\n* 2019: Novak Djokovic (AO&WI)\n* 2019: Rafael Nadal (FO&US)\n* 2022: Rafael Nadal (AO&FO)\n |\n\n |\n| AC=Australasian/Australian Championships, AO=Australian Open, FC=French Championships, FO=French Open, WI=Wimbledon, US=U.S. National Championships/US Open\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMen's tennis players who won two or more Grand Slam singles titles in one calendar year\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n| Four wins\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1938: Don Budge\n* 1962: Rod Laver\n* 1969: Rod Laver\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2002, Djokovic continued his dominance, now in the under 16 circuit, winning prestigious tournaments such as *La Boule* and *La Poet* in France, Prince's Cup in Miami,[56] as well as his first-ever ITF tournament, which was played at just twenty kilometers away from his home in Belgrade, in the small town of Pančevo.[2] He entered the tournament as a wild card and won all of his matches in straight sets, some of which against rivals three years older than him, including the No. 1 seed David Savić in the final, 6–2, 6–2.[57] At 16, after winning five ITF tournaments, he was ranked the 40th best junior tennis player in the world.[22]\n\n\nIn juniors, he compiled a singles win-loss record of 40–11 (and 23–6 in doubles), reaching a combined junior world ranking of No. 24 in February 2004.[58] At the junior Grand Slam events, his best showing was at the Australian Open where he reached the semifinals in 2004.

As a wild card at the Rotterdam Open, he earned his first top 10 victory against world No. 10 David Goffin.[28]\n\n\nFollowing the ATP Tour shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sinner had a successful restart to the season. Although he lost his opening round match to Karen Khachanov at the US Open, he fared better in Europe. He reached the third round at the Rome Masters, highlighted by a victory over world No. 6 Stefanos Tsitsipas.[29] He then progressed to become the youngest quarterfinalist at the French Open since Novak Djokovic in 2006, and the first to make the quarterfinals on debut since Rafael Nadal in 2005. During the tournament, he defeated Goffin again as well as US Open runner-up and world No. 7 Alexander Zverev before losing to Nadal.[30][31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAssociation of Tennis Professionals ![Italy](image) Top Italian male singles tennis players\n |\n| --- |\n| *As of Jun 9, 2024*\n |\n| * 1.

He had a strong start to 2021, highlighted by his second ATP title in a row and a Masters 1000 runner-up at the Miami Open. On 1 November 2021, he became the first player born in the 2000s to enter the ATP top 10. He became the first teenage ATP 500 champion since the category was renamed in 2009 by winning the 2021 Citi Open. Sinner won his first Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open in Toronto.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and background[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the second half of the season, Sinner played more often on the ATP Tour than the Challenger Tour.[20] His first ATP Masters victory came at the Italian Open against Steve Johnson, and he broke into the top 200 with his next ATP win at the Croatia Open Umag in July.[15] The next month, he won a second ATP Challenger title in Lexington to become one of just eleven 17-year-olds to have won multiple Challenger titles.[21] After losing in qualifying at Wimbledon, Sinner qualified for his first Grand Slam main draw at the US Open.[22] He lost his debut match to No. 24 Stan Wawrinka.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the ATP Finals in Turin, Sinner was present as the first alternate. Sinner entered the tournament after countryman Matteo Berrettini was forced to withdraw with an abdominal injury after his first match with Alexander Zverev.[51] He defeated Hubert Hurkacz and became the youngest player to win an ATP Finals match on debut since Lleyton Hewitt in Lisbon in 2000 and the first alternate to win a match since Janko Tipsarević in London in 2011.[52][53] Sinner played Daniil Medvedev next in the round robin stage, holding a match point before being defeated in 3 sets. As a result, he re-entered the top-10 in the rankings and finished the year at world No. 10 on 22 November 2021.\n\n\nIn the Davis Cup Finals, Sinner defeated John Isner becoming only the second player (after Thiemo de Bakker) ever to bagel Isner.[54]\n\n\n\n### 2022: Three Major quarterfinals, Davis Cup success[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win%\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 2R | 1R | QF | 4R |  | 0 / 4\n | 8–4\n | 67%\n |\n| French Open | A\n | QF | 4R | 4R | 2R |  | 0 / 4\n | 11–4\n | 73%\n |\n| Wimbledon | Q1 | NH\n | 1R | QF | SF |  | 0 / 3\n | 9–3\n | 75%\n |\n| US Open | 1R | 1R | 4R | QF | 4R |  | 0 / 5\n | 10–5\n | 67%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–1\n | 5–3\n | 6–4\n | 15–4\n | 12–4\n |  | 0 / 16\n | 38–16\n | 70%\n |\n\n\nSource: ATP profile[3]\n\n\n\n### Year-end championships finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 1 (1 runner-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSinner grew up in northern Italy in the region of South Tyrol. He was active in skiing, football, and tennis as a child. After winning a national championship in skiing at age eight, Sinner switched his focus to tennis at age thirteen and moved to Bordighera on the Italian Riviera to train with veteran coach Riccardo Piatti. Despite limited success as a junior, Sinner began playing in professional events at age 16 and became one of the few players to win multiple ATP Challenger Tour titles at age 17. He won the ATP Newcomer of the Year award in 2019 after breaking through into the top 100, reaching his first ATP semifinal, and winning the Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September, during the Davis Cup Finals after Matteo Berrettini won his singles match against Argentina, Sinner won the second match (best of three matches) and thus secured a place for Italy's Davis Cup team at the Final 8 of the Davis Cup Finals.[75] Following close to a month break due to an injury sustained in the semifinal at the 2022 Sofia Open[76] he returned to the 2022 Erste Bank Open in Vienna and reached also the quarterfinals losing to top seed and eventual champion Daniil Medvedev.[77] In his next tournament, the 2022 Rolex Paris Masters, he lost in the first round to qualifier Marc-Andrea Huesler.[78]\n\n\nSinner finished the year ranked 15th in the world, one space ahead of countryman Matteo Berrettini.\n\n\n\n### 2023: Major semifinal, first Masters & world No. 1 wins, World No. 4, ATP Finals debut[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the age of thirteen, Sinner decided to give up skiing and football in favour of tennis. He preferred it over skiing because he wanted to compete directly against an opponent and to have more margin of error over the course of an entire match. He also wanted to be in an individual sport where he could make all of the decisions, an opportunity he would not have in a team sport like football.[10] He decided to move on his own to Bordighera on the Italian Riviera to train at the Piatti Tennis Centre under Riccardo Piatti and Massimo Sartori, a decision which his parents supported.[3][5][7] At the centre, Sinner lived with the family of Luka Cvjetković, one of his coaches.[11] Before Sinner began training in tennis full-time with Piatti, he had been playing only twice a week.[9]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSinner resides in Monte Carlo in Monaco.[3] He is a fan of A.C. Milan football club.[9] One of his tennis idols is compatriot Andreas Seppi, who is also from Alto Adige. Nonetheless, he has already surpassed Seppi in terms of achievements, with his main idols being Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic.[17]\n\n\nSinner speaks three languages: German (mother tongue), Italian and English.[109]\n\n\n\n### Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nSinner endorses Nike,[110] Head,[111] Rolex,[112] Gucci,[113] Lavazza,[114] Alfa Romeo,[115] FASTWEB,[116] Technogym,[117] and Parmigiano Reggiano.[118]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jannik Sinner career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam singles performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Sinner at the 2019 NextGen ATP Finals in Milan\nSinner won his first ATP Challenger title in Bergamo in February 2019 at the age of 17 years and 6 months, despite entering the tournament with no match wins at the Challenger level.

With the title, he rose over 200 spots in ATP rankings up to No. 324.[16][17] After his first two ITF Futures titles, Sinner entered his first ATP tournament at the Hungarian Open as a lucky loser, where he notched his first tour-level win over home wild card Máté Valkusz.[18] The next week, he reached his second ATP Challenger final in Ostrava, finishing runner-up to Kamil Majchrzak.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. ![Australia](image)Found atpsingles, Storm Hunter\n5. ![Czech Republic](image)Found atpsingles, Kateřina Siniaková\n6. ![Germany](image)Found atpsingles, Laura Siegemund\n7. ![Canada](image)Found atpsingles, Gabriela Dabrowski\n8. ![](image)Found atpsingles, Vera Zvonareva\n9. ![United States](image)Found atpsingles, Nicole Melichar\n10. ![Australia](image)Found atpsingles, Ellen Perez\n |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Marat Safin\n* Andrei Pavel\n* Guillermo Cañas\n* Andy Roddick\n* Roger Federer\n* Rafael Nadal (**5**)\n* Roger Federer (2)\n* Novak Djokovic (4)\n* Andy Murray (3)\n* Jo-Wilfried Tsonga\n* Alexander Zverev\n* Daniil Medvedev\n* Pablo Carreño Busta\n* Jannik Sinner\n |\n| Cincinnati Open | * Stefan Edberg\n* Guy Forget\n* Pete Sampras (3)\n* Michael Chang (2)\n* Andre Agassi (3)\n* Pat Rafter\n* Thomas Enqvist\n* Gustavo Kuerten\n* Carlos Moyá\n* Andy Roddick (2)\n* Roger Federer (**7**)\n* Andy Murray (2)\n* Rafael Nadal\n* Marin Čilić\n* Grigor Dimitrov\n* Novak Djokovic (3)\n* Daniil Medvedev\n* Alexander Zverev\n* Borna Ćorić\n |\n| Stockholm Open / Eurocard Open / Madrid Open / Shanghai Masters | * *Stockholm*→ Boris Becker (**3**)\n* Goran Ivanišević\n* Michael Stich\n* *Stuttgart*→ Thomas Muster\n* Boris Becker\n* Petr Korda\n* Richard Krajicek\n* Thomas Enqvist\n* Wayne Ferreira\n* Tommy Haas\n* *Madrid*→ Andre Agassi\n* Juan Carlos Ferrero\n* Marat Safin\n* Rafael Nadal\n* Roger Federer\n* David Nalbandian\n* Andy Murray\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** \"One Year On, Sinner Earns Second De Minaur Victory\". *ATP Tour*. 12 November 2020.

He became the youngest man to win five ATP titles since 19-year-old Novak Djokovic.[49]\n\n\nOn 1 November, Sinner became the first male player born in the 2000s to break into the top-10 after a semifinal appearance at the Vienna Open.\nAt the Rolex Paris Masters, Sinner received a bye in the first round but was defeated by Carlos Alcaraz. Because of this, Sinner was unable to directly qualify for the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe reached back to back quarterfinals at the 2023 Wimbledon Championships defeating Juan Manuel Cerundolo, Diego Schwartzman, Quentin Halys and Daniel Elahi Galan.[93] He reached his first Major semifinal defeating Roman Safiullin, before losing to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[94]\n\n\nIn August, he won his maiden Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open in Toronto defeating Alex de Minaur in straight sets for his eighth ATP title.[95] En route to the final, he defeated compatriot Matteo Berrettini, Andy Murray by walkover, Gaël Monfils, and Tommy Paul.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe also possesses a powerful first serve, which can reach up to speeds of 221 kilometres per hour (137.3 mph) although it has been criticised for its low average in percentage at 59.2%, and it can frequently dip below 55%. His coaching team has tried to combat this by alternating between the pinpoint(legs together) and platform(legs apart) stances, although as of late 2023 it seems they have settled on the pinpoint stance. Sinner is aiming to incorporate more variety into his game, hence he has been developing his net game and ability to serve-and-volley, as well as his slices and dropshots, to reduce the number of long rallies he has to play from the baseline.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"First-Time Winner Spotlight: Jannik Sinner\". *ATP Tour*. 14 November 2020.

He grew up in the town of Sexten, where his father and mother work as a chef and a waitress at a ski lodge.[2] He has a brother named Marc.[3] Sinner began both skiing and playing tennis at age three. He was one of Italy's top junior skiers from eight to twelve years old, winning a national championship in giant slalom at age eight and earning a national runner-up at the age of twelve.[4][5][6]\n\n\nWhile training in skiing, Sinner gave up tennis for a year at the age of seven before his father pushed him to return to the sport.[7] When he resumed playing, he began working with Heribert Mayr as his first regular coach.[8] Nonetheless, tennis was still only his third priority behind skiing and football.[9][10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** \"Stat of the Day: 20-year-old Sinner becomes youngest man to win five ATP titles since 19-year-old Djokovic\".\n50. **^** \"Carlos Alcaraz Stops Jannik Sinner's Nitto ATP Finals Tilt | ATP Tour | Tennis\".

Sinner's groundstroke strength is his two-handed-backhand, which he hits with more topspin than any other player on the tour, registering an average of 1858 revolutions per minute on the shot along with the fifth-best average speed of 111.2 kilometres per hour (69.1 mph).[103] His forehand is also a strength, owing to the fact he has a short compact takeback, meaning he rarely has to rush the shot, and the ability to rapidly open up his body, generating huge racket head speed and allowing him to hit the shot at over 100 mph on occasion. He uses a modern, semi-western grip to generate large amounts of topspin, increasing net clearance and reducing the likelihood of unforced errors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Rafael Nadal (**11**)\n* Novak Djokovic (2)\n* Stan Wawrinka\n* Fabio Fognini\n* Stefanos Tsitsipas (2)\n* Andrey Rublev\n |\n| German Open / Madrid Open | * *Hamburg*→ Juan Aguilera\n* Karel Nováček\n* Stefan Edberg\n* Michael Stich\n* Andriy Medvedev (3)\n* Roberto Carretero\n* Albert Costa\n* Marcelo Ríos\n* Gustavo Kuerten\n* Albert Portas\n* Roger Federer (**4**)\n* Guillermo Coria\n* Tommy Robredo\n* Rafael Nadal\n* *Madrid*→ Roger Federer (3)\n* Rafael Nadal (**5**)\n* Novak Djokovic (3)\n* Andy Murray\n* Alexander Zverev (2)\n* Carlos Alcaraz (2)\n |\n| Italian Open | * Thomas Muster (3)\n* Emilio Sánchez\n* Jim Courier (2)\n* Pete Sampras\n* Àlex Corretja\n* Marcelo Ríos\n* Gustavo Kuerten\n* Magnus Norman\n* Juan Carlos Ferrero\n* Andre Agassi\n* Félix Mantilla\n* Carlos Moyá\n* Rafael Nadal (**10**)\n* Novak Djokovic (6)\n* Andy Murray\n* Alexander Zverev\n* Daniil Medvedev\n |\n| Canadian Open | * Michael Chang\n* Andrei Chesnokov\n* Andre Agassi (3)\n* Mikael Pernfors\n* Wayne Ferreira\n* Chris Woodruff\n* Patrick Rafter\n* Thomas Johansson\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Sinner at the 2021 French Open\nSinner carried over his success from late 2020 into the start of the 2021 season.
