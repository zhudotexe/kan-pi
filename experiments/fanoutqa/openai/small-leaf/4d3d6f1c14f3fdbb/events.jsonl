In 2009, he was appointed to Professor at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nLindenstrauss was born into an Israeli-Jewish family with German Jewish origins, the son of the mathematician Joram Lindenstrauss, the namesake of the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma, and computer scientist Naomi Lindenstrauss, both professors at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His sister Ayelet Lindenstrauss is also a mathematician. He attended the Hebrew University Secondary School. In 1988 he was awarded a bronze medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad. He enlisted to the IDF's Talpiot program, and studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he earned his BSc in Mathematics and Physics in 1991 and his master's degree in mathematics in 1995. In 1999 he finished his Ph.D., his thesis being \"Entropy properties of dynamical systems\", under the guidance of Prof. Benjamin Weiss. He was a member at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, then a Szego Assistant Prof. at Stanford University. From 2003 to 2005, he was a Long Term Prize Fellow at the Clay Mathematics Institute.\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\nIn Fall 2014, he was Visiting Miller Professor at the University of California, Berkeley.[3] Lindenstrauss is an editor for Duke Mathematical Journal and Journal d'Analyse Mathématique.[4][5]\n\n\nLindenstrauss works in the area of dynamics, particularly in the area of ergodic theory and its applications in number theory. With Anatole Katok and Manfred Einsiedler, he made progress on the Littlewood conjecture.[6]\n\n\nIn a series of two papers (one co-authored with Jean Bourgain) he made major progress on Peter Sarnak's Arithmetic Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture. The proof of the conjecture was completed by Kannan Soundararajan.\n\n\nRecently with Manfred Einsiedler, Philippe Michel and Akshay Venkatesh, he studied distributions of torus periodic orbits in some arithmetic spaces, generalizing theorems by Hermann Minkowski and Yuri Linnik.\n\n\nTogether with Benjamin Weiss he developed and studied systematically the invariant of mean dimension[7] introduced in 1999 by Mikhail Gromov.[8] In related work he introduced and studied the small boundary property and stated fundamental conjectures.[9]\n\n\nAmong his co-authors are Jean Bourgain, Manfred Einsiedler, Philippe Michel, Shahar Mozes, Akshay Venkatesh and Barak Weiss.\n\n\n\n## Awards and recognition[edit]\n\n\n* In 1988, Lindenstrauss represented Israel in the International Mathematical Olympiad and won a bronze medal.\n* During his service in the IDF, he was awarded the Israel Defense Prize.\n* In 2003, he was awarded the Salem Prize jointly with Kannan Soundararajan.\n* In 2004, he was awarded the European Mathematical Society Prize.\n* In 2008, he received the Michael Bruno Memorial Award.\n* In 2009, he was awarded the Erdős Prize.\n* In 2009, he received the Fermat Prize.\n* In 2010, he became the first Israeli to be awarded the Fields Medal, *for his results on measure rigidity in ergodic theory, and their applications to number theory*.[10]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Israeli wins world's most prestigious math prize\". *ynet*. 19 August 2010.

He is the first Vietnamese national to have received the Fields Medal.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nNgô Bảo Châu was born in 1972, the son of an intellectual family in Hanoi, North Vietnam. His father, professor Ngô Huy Cẩn, is full professor of physics at the Vietnam National Institute of Mechanics. His mother, Trần Lưu Vân Hiền, is a physician and associate professor at an herbal medicine hospital in Hanoi.\n\n\nThe beginning of Châu's schooling was at an experimental elementary school that had been founded by the revolutionary pedagogue Hồ Ngọc Đại, but when his father returned from the Soviet Union with his doctoral degree, he decided that Châu would learn more in traditional schools and enrolled him in the \"chuyên toán\" (special classes for gifted students in mathematics) at the Trưng Vương Middle School.[9]\nAt age 15, Châu entered the special mathematics class at the High School for Gifted Students, Hanoi University of Science (Khối chuyên Tổng Hợp – Đại học Khoa Học Tự Nhiên Hà Nội[10]), formerly known as the A0-class. In grades 11 and 12, Châu participated in the 29th and 30th International Mathematical Olympiads (IMO) and became the first Vietnamese student to win two IMO gold medals,[11] of which the first one was won with a perfect score (42/42).[12]\n\n\nAfter high school, Châu expected to study in Budapest, but in the aftermath of the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, the new Hungarian government halted scholarships to students from Vietnam.[13] After visiting Châu's father, Paul Germain, secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, arranged for Châu to study in France. He was offered a scholarship by the French government for undergraduate study at the Paris VI University, then in 1992, he entered the École Normale Supérieure. He obtained a PhD in 1997 from the Universite Paris-Sud under the supervision of Gérard Laumon. He became a member of CNRS at Paris 13 University from 1998 to 2005, and defended his habilitation degree there in 2003. He holds both Vietnamese and French citizenship.[14]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nChâu became a professor at Paris-Sud 11 University in 2005. In 2005, at age 33, Chau received the title of professor in Vietnam, becoming the country's youngest-ever professor.[12] Since 2007, Châu has worked at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, as well as the Hanoi Institute of Mathematics.[15] He joined the mathematics faculty at the University of Chicago on September 1, 2010. In addition, since 2011 he has been Scientific Director of the newly founded Vietnam Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics (VIASM).[16] In 2016 Châu was Co-General Chair of Asiacrypt the first time that the Asian cryptography conference was held in Vietnam.[17]\n\n\n\n## Work[edit]\n\n\nChâu first came to prominence by proving, in joint work with Gérard Laumon, the fundamental lemma for unitary groups. Their general strategy was to understand the local orbital integrals appearing in the fundamental lemma in terms of affine Springer fibers arising in the Hitchin fibration. This allowed them to employ the tools of geometric representation theory, namely the theory of perverse sheaves, to study what was initially a combinatorial problem of a number-theoretic nature. Chau eventually succeeded in formulating the proof for the fundamental lemma for Lie algebras in 2008.[12] Together with earlier results from Jean-Loup Waldspurger, who had shown that the full fundamental lemma results from this then missing result, this completed the proof of the fundamental lemma in all cases.

In 2009, he was appointed to Professor at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nLindenstrauss was born into an Israeli-Jewish family with German Jewish origins, the son of the mathematician Joram Lindenstrauss, the namesake of the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma, and computer scientist Naomi Lindenstrauss, both professors at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His sister Ayelet Lindenstrauss is also a mathematician. He attended the Hebrew University Secondary School. In 1988 he was awarded a bronze medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad. He enlisted to the IDF's Talpiot program, and studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he earned his BSc in Mathematics and Physics in 1991 and his master's degree in mathematics in 1995. In 1999 he finished his Ph.D., his thesis being \"Entropy properties of dynamical systems\", under the guidance of Prof. Benjamin Weiss. He was a member at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, then a Szego Assistant Prof. at Stanford University. From 2003 to 2005, he was a Long Term Prize Fellow at the Clay Mathematics Institute.\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\nIn Fall 2014, he was Visiting Miller Professor at the University of California, Berkeley.[3] Lindenstrauss is an editor for Duke Mathematical Journal and Journal d'Analyse Mathématique.[4][5]\n\n\nLindenstrauss works in the area of dynamics, particularly in the area of ergodic theory and its applications in number theory. With Anatole Katok and Manfred Einsiedler, he made progress on the Littlewood conjecture.[6]\n\n\nIn a series of two papers (one co-authored with Jean Bourgain) he made major progress on Peter Sarnak's Arithmetic Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture. The proof of the conjecture was completed by Kannan Soundararajan.\n\n\nRecently with Manfred Einsiedler, Philippe Michel and Akshay Venkatesh, he studied distributions of torus periodic orbits in some arithmetic spaces, generalizing theorems by Hermann Minkowski and Yuri Linnik.\n\n\nTogether with Benjamin Weiss he developed and studied systematically the invariant of mean dimension[7] introduced in 1999 by Mikhail Gromov.[8] In related work he introduced and studied the small boundary property and stated fundamental conjectures.[9]\n\n\nAmong his co-authors are Jean Bourgain, Manfred Einsiedler, Philippe Michel, Shahar Mozes, Akshay Venkatesh and Barak Weiss.\n\n\n\n## Awards and recognition[edit]\n\n\n* In 1988, Lindenstrauss represented Israel in the International Mathematical Olympiad and won a bronze medal.\n* During his service in the IDF, he was awarded the Israel Defense Prize.\n* In 2003, he was awarded the Salem Prize jointly with Kannan Soundararajan.\n* In 2004, he was awarded the European Mathematical Society Prize.\n* In 2008, he received the Michael Bruno Memorial Award.\n* In 2009, he was awarded the Erdős Prize.\n* In 2009, he received the Fermat Prize.\n* In 2010, he became the first Israeli to be awarded the Fields Medal, *for his results on measure rigidity in ergodic theory, and their applications to number theory*.[10]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Israeli wins world's most prestigious math prize\". *ynet*. 19 August 2010.

He is the first Vietnamese national to have received the Fields Medal.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nNgô Bảo Châu was born in 1972, the son of an intellectual family in Hanoi, North Vietnam. His father, professor Ngô Huy Cẩn, is full professor of physics at the Vietnam National Institute of Mechanics. His mother, Trần Lưu Vân Hiền, is a physician and associate professor at an herbal medicine hospital in Hanoi.\n\n\nThe beginning of Châu's schooling was at an experimental elementary school that had been founded by the revolutionary pedagogue Hồ Ngọc Đại, but when his father returned from the Soviet Union with his doctoral degree, he decided that Châu would learn more in traditional schools and enrolled him in the \"chuyên toán\" (special classes for gifted students in mathematics) at the Trưng Vương Middle School.[9]\nAt age 15, Châu entered the special mathematics class at the High School for Gifted Students, Hanoi University of Science (Khối chuyên Tổng Hợp – Đại học Khoa Học Tự Nhiên Hà Nội[10]), formerly known as the A0-class. In grades 11 and 12, Châu participated in the 29th and 30th International Mathematical Olympiads (IMO) and became the first Vietnamese student to win two IMO gold medals,[11] of which the first one was won with a perfect score (42/42).[12]\n\n\nAfter high school, Châu expected to study in Budapest, but in the aftermath of the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, the new Hungarian government halted scholarships to students from Vietnam.[13] After visiting Châu's father, Paul Germain, secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, arranged for Châu to study in France. He was offered a scholarship by the French government for undergraduate study at the Paris VI University, then in 1992, he entered the École Normale Supérieure. He obtained a PhD in 1997 from the Universite Paris-Sud under the supervision of Gérard Laumon. He became a member of CNRS at Paris 13 University from 1998 to 2005, and defended his habilitation degree there in 2003. He holds both Vietnamese and French citizenship.[14]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nChâu became a professor at Paris-Sud 11 University in 2005. In 2005, at age 33, Chau received the title of professor in Vietnam, becoming the country's youngest-ever professor.[12] Since 2007, Châu has worked at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, as well as the Hanoi Institute of Mathematics.[15] He joined the mathematics faculty at the University of Chicago on September 1, 2010. In addition, since 2011 he has been Scientific Director of the newly founded Vietnam Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics (VIASM).[16] In 2016 Châu was Co-General Chair of Asiacrypt the first time that the Asian cryptography conference was held in Vietnam.[17]\n\n\n\n## Work[edit]\n\n\nChâu first came to prominence by proving, in joint work with Gérard Laumon, the fundamental lemma for unitary groups. Their general strategy was to understand the local orbital integrals appearing in the fundamental lemma in terms of affine Springer fibers arising in the Hitchin fibration. This allowed them to employ the tools of geometric representation theory, namely the theory of perverse sheaves, to study what was initially a combinatorial problem of a number-theoretic nature. Chau eventually succeeded in formulating the proof for the fundamental lemma for Lie algebras in 2008.[12] Together with earlier results from Jean-Loup Waldspurger, who had shown that the full fundamental lemma results from this then missing result, this completed the proof of the fundamental lemma in all cases. As a result, Châu was awarded a Fields Medal in 2010.\n\n\nNgô Bảo Châu was the co-author of the Vietnamese children's book *Ai and Ky in the land of the invisible numbers*.\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Châu and Laumon were awarded the Clay Research Award for their achievement in solving the fundamental lemma for the case of unitary groups.[12] Châu's proof of the general case was selected by *Time* as one of the Top Ten Scientific Discoveries of 2009.[15] In 2010, he received the Fields Medal. By decree on 22 April 2011, he was awarded a Knight of France's Legion of Honour.[18] In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[19] In 2021, he became an honorary member of the London Mathematical Society.[20][21]\n\n\n\n## Major publications[edit]\n\n\n* Ngô, Bao Châu. *Le lemme fondamental pour les algèbres de Lie.
