Of the estimated 70\u201385 million deaths attributed to World War II, around 30\u00a0million occurred on the Eastern Front, including 9 million children.[1][2] The Eastern Front was decisive in determining the outcome in the European theatre of operations in World War II, eventually serving as the main reason for the defeat of Nazi Germany and the Axis nations.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe battles on the Eastern Front of the Second World War constituted the largest military confrontation in history.[4] They were characterised by unprecedented ferocity and brutality, wholesale destruction, mass deportations, and immense loss of life due to combat, starvation, exposure, disease, and massacres. The two principal belligerent powers were Germany and the Soviet Union, along with their respective allies. Though never sending in ground troops to the Eastern Front, the United States and the United Kingdom both provided substantial material aid to the Soviet Union in the form of the Lend-Lease program along with naval and air support. The joint German\u2013Finnish operations across the northernmost Finnish\u2013Soviet border and in the Murmansk region are considered part of the Eastern Front. In addition, the Soviet\u2013Finnish Continuation War is generally also considered the northern flank of the Eastern Front.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Anschluss, Munich Agreement, and Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Timeline of the Eastern Front of World War II\n* Historiography of World War II\n* Outline of World War II\n* *The Battle of Russia* \u2013 a film from the *Why We Fight* propaganda film series\n* Horses in World War II\n* Severity Order\n* Barbarossa decree\n* Commissar Order\n* Kantokuen - Japanese plan to invade the Soviet Far East in 1941\n\n### National and regional experiences[edit]\n\n\n* Bulgaria during World War II\n* Byelorussia in World War II\n* Carpathian Ruthenia during World War II\n* Estonia in World War II\n* Finland in World War II\n* German occupation of the Baltic states during World War II\n* Greece during World War II\n* Hungary in World War II\n* Italian participation on the Eastern Front\n* Romania in World War II\n* Soviet\u2013Japanese War\n* Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)\n* Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1944)\n* Soviet Union in World War II\n* Women in the Russian and Soviet military\n* Women in World War II\n* World War II in Yugoslavia\n\n### Lists[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

It is generally accepted as being the deadliest conflict in human history, with over 30\u00a0million killed as a result.[2] The German armed forces suffered 80% of its military deaths in the Eastern Front.[112] It involved more land combat than all other World War II theatres combined. The distinctly brutal nature of warfare on the Eastern Front was exemplified by an often wilful disregard for human life by both sides. It was also reflected in the ideological premise for the war, which also saw a momentous clash between two directly opposed ideologies.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of military operations on the Eastern Front of World War II\n* Strategic operations of the Red Army in World War II\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Date | 22\u00a0June\u00a01941\u00a0(1941-06-22) \u2013 8\u00a0May\u00a01945\u00a0(1945-05-08)(3\u00a0years, 10\u00a0months, 2\u00a0weeks and 2\u00a0days) |\n| Location | Europe, east of Germany: Central and Eastern Europe, in later stages: Germany and Austria\n |\n| Result | Soviet victory[i]\n* Fall of Nazi Germany (concurrently with the Western Front)\n* Beginning of the Cold War and creation of the Eastern Bloc and the Iron Curtain\n* Beginning of anti-communist insurgencies\n |\n| Territorialchanges | Soviet occupation ofCentral and Eastern Europe\n\n* Allied occupation of Germany, Austria and Partition of Germany\n* Polish puppet state and change of borders\n* Soviet occupation of Romania\n* Soviet occupation of Hungary\n* Bulgarian communist coup and Soviet occupation\n* Soviet re-occupation of the Baltics\n* Czechoslovakia cedes Carpathian Ruthenia\n* East Prussia split between the Soviet Union (Kaliningrad Oblast) and Poland (Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMilitary losses on the Eastern Front during World War II[153]\n| Forces fighting with the Axis\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Total Dead\n | KIA/DOW/MIA | Prisoners taken by the Soviets\n | Prisoners who died in Captivity\n | WIA (not including DOW)\n |\n| Greater Germany\n | est 4,137,000[154] | est 3,637,000\n | 2,733,739\u20133,000,060\n | 500,000[155] | Unknown\n |\n| Soviet residents who joined German army\n | 215,000\n | 215,000\n | 400,000+\n | Unknown\n | 118,127\n |\n| Romania\n | 281,000\n | 226,000\n | 500,000\n | 55,000\n |  |\n| Hungary\n | 300,000\n | 245,000\n | 500,000\n | 55,000\n | 89,313\n |\n| Italy\n | 82,000\n | 55,000\n | 70,000\n | 27,000\n |  |\n| Finland[156] | 63,204\n | 62,731\n | 3,500\n | 473\n | 158,000\n |\n| Total\n | est 5,078,000\n | est 4,437,400\n | 4,264,497\u20134,530,818\n | est 637,000\n | Unknown\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nComparative strengths of combat forces, Eastern Front, 1941\u20131945[33][34][35]\n| Date\n | Axis forces\n | Soviet forces\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 22 June 1941 | 3,050,000 Germans, 67,000 (northern Norway); 500,000 Finns, 150,000 RomaniansTotal: **3,767,000** in the east (80% of the German Army) | 2,680,000 active in Western Military Districts out of **5,500,000** (overall); 12,000,000 mobilizable reserves\n |\n| 7 June 1942 | 2,600,000 Germans, 90,000 (northern Norway); 600,000 Romanians, Hungarians, and ItaliansTotal: **3,720,000** in the east (80% of the German Army) | 5,313,000 (front); 383,000 (hospital)Total: **9,350,000** |\n| 9 July 1943 | 3,403,000 Germans, 80,000 (northern Norway); 400,000 Finns, 150,000 Romanians and HungariansTotal: **3,933,000** in the east (63% of the German Army) | 6,724,000 (front); 446,445 (hospital);Total: **10,300,000** |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMilitary losses on the Eastern Front during World War II[157]\n| Forces fighting with the Soviet Union\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Total Dead\n | KIA/DOW/MIA\n | Prisoners taken by the Axis\n | Prisoners who died in captivity\n | WIA (not including DOW)\n |\n| Soviet\n | 8,668,400\u201310,000,000\n | 6,829,600\n | 4,059,000 (military personnel only)\u20135,700,000\n | 2,250,000\u20133,300,000[158][159] of which 1,283,200 confirmed[151] | 13,581,483[160] |\n| Poland\n | 24,000\n | 24,000\n | Unknown\n | Unknown\n |  |\n| Romania\n | 17,000\n | 17,000\n | 80,000\n | Unknown\n |  |\n| Bulgaria\n | 10,000\n | 10,000\n | Unknown\n | Unknown\n |  |\n| Total\n | Up to ~8,719,000 \u2013 10,000,000\n | 6,880,600\n | 4,139,000\u20135,780,000\n | 2,250,000\u20133,300,000\n | 13,581,483\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn a lightning campaign, the Germans were pushed back from Leningrad and Novgorod was captured by Soviet forces. After a 120-kilometre (75\u00a0mi) advance in January and February, the Leningrad Front had reached the borders of Estonia. To Stalin, the Baltic Sea seemed the quickest way to take the battles to the German territory in East Prussia and seize control of Finland.[87] The Leningrad Front's offensives towards Tallinn, a main Baltic port, were stopped in February 1944. The German army group \"Narwa\" included Estonian conscripts, defending the re-establishment of Estonian independence.[88][89]\n\n\n\n### Summer 1944[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Crimean Offensive (1944), Operation Bagration, Lvov\u2013Sandomierz Offensive, Battle of Tannenberg Line, Warsaw Uprising, Slovak National Uprising, Battle of Romania (1944), Battle of Debrecen, and Vyborg\u2013Petrozavodsk Offensive\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder the pressure of the Soviet Baltic Offensive, the German Army Group North were withdrawn to fight in the sieges of Saaremaa, Courland and Memel.\n\n\n\n### January\u2013March 1945[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Vistula\u2013Oder Offensive, East Pomeranian Offensive, Silesian Offensives, East Prussian Offensive, and Vienna Offensive\n\n![](image)Soviet advances from 1 January 1945 to 11 May 1945: to 30 March 1945\n to 11 May 1945\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A map of the South Western Front (Ukrainian) at 22 June 1941\nWhile German historians do not apply any specific periodisation to the conduct of operations on the Eastern Front, all Soviet and Russian historians divide the war against Germany and its allies into three periods, which are further subdivided into eight major campaigns of the Theatre of war:[64]\n\n\n\n* **First period** (Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0434 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b) (22 June 1941 \u2013 18 November 1942)\n\n\n1.

The diversion of the well-equipped *Gro\u00dfdeutschland Division* from Belgorod to Karachev could not counteract it, and the Wehrmacht began a withdrawal from Orel (retaken by the Red Army on 5 August 1943), falling back to the Hagen line in front of Bryansk. To the south, the Red Army broke through Army Group South's Belgorod positions and headed for Kharkov once again. Although intense battles of movement throughout late July and into August 1943 saw the Tigers blunting Soviet tank attacks on one axis, they were soon outflanked on another line to the west as the Soviet forces advanced down the Psel, and Kharkov was abandoned for the final time on 22 August.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough the Soviet Union had not signed the Geneva Convention (1929), it is generally accepted that it considered itself bound by the provisions of the Hague convention.[131] A month after the German invasion in 1941, an offer was made for a reciprocal adherence to Hague convention. This 'note' was left unanswered by Third Reich officials.[132]\n\n\nSoviet repressions also contributed into the Eastern Front's death toll. Mass repression occurred in the occupied portions of Poland as well as in the Baltic states and Bessarabia. Immediately after the start of the German invasion, the NKVD massacred large numbers of inmates in most of their prisons in Western Belarus and Western Ukraine, while the remainder was to be evacuated in death marches.[133]\n\n\n\n## Industrial output[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever, if one last great *blitzkrieg* offensive could be mounted, then attention could then be turned to the Allied threat to the Western Front. Certainly, the peace negotiations in April had gone nowhere.[86] The advance would be executed from the Orel salient to the north of Kursk and from Belgorod to the south. Both wings would converge on the area east of Kursk, and by that means restore the lines of Army Group South to the exact points that it held over the winter of 1941\u20131942.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Germany's initial success at the Battle of Kiev in 1941, Hitler saw the Soviet Union as militarily weak and ripe for immediate conquest. In a speech at the Berlin Sportpalast on 3 October, he announced, \"We have only to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down.\"[19] Thus, Germany expected another short *Blitzkrieg* and made no serious preparations for prolonged warfare. However, following the decisive Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943 and the resulting dire German military situation, Nazi propaganda began to portray the war as a German defence of Western civilisation against destruction by the vast \"Bolshevik hordes\" that were pouring into Europe.\n\n\n\n### Soviet situation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Semyon Timoshenko and Georgy Zhukov in 1940\nSee also: Great Purge, Purge of the Red Army in 1941, Spanish Civil War, and Battles of Khalkhin Gol\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Dutch famine of 1944\u20131945\n |\n| 1945 | * Vistula\u2013Oder\n* Battle of Manila\n* Battle of Iwo Jima\n* Indochina\n* Vienna offensive\n* Project Hula\n* Western invasion of Germany\n* Bratislava\u2013Brno offensive\n* Battle of Okinawa\n* Second Guangxi campaign\n* West Hunan\n* Italy (Spring 1945)\n* Battle of Berlin\n* Prague offensive\n* Surrender of Germany\n\t+ document\n* Borneo\n* Taipei\n* Naval bombardment of Japan\n* Manchuria\n* Atomic bombings\n\t+ Debate\n* South Sakhalin\n* Kuril Islands\n\t+ Shumshu\n* Surrender of Japan\n\t+ Potsdam Declaration\n\t+ document\n\t+ End of World War II in Asia\n |\n\n |\n| * **![](image) World portal**\n* Bibliography\n* Category\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Topics | * Air warfare of World War II\n\t+ In Europe\n* Blitzkrieg\n* Comparative military ranks\n* Cryptography\n* Declarations of war\n* Diplomacy\n* Governments in exile\n* Home front\n\t+ Australian\n\t+ United Kingdom\n\t+ United States\n* Lend-Lease\n* Manhattan Project\n\t+ British contribution\n* Military awards\n* Military equipment\n* Military production\n* Naval history\n* Nazi plunder\n* Opposition\n* Technology\n\t+ Allied cooperation\n\t+ Mulberry harbour\n* Total war\n* Strategic bombing\n* Puppet states\n* Women\n* Art and World War II\n* Music in World War II\n |\n| Theaters | * Asia and Pacific\n\t+ China\n\t+ South-East Asia\n\t+ Pacific\n\t+ North and Central Pacific\n\t+ South-West Pacific\n\t+ Indian Ocean\n* Europe\n\t+ Western Front\n\t+ Eastern Front\n* Mediterranean and Middle East\n\t+ North Africa\n\t+ East Africa\n\t+ Italy\n* West Africa\n* Atlantic\n\t+ timeline\n* Americas\n |\n| Aftermath | * Chinese Civil War\n* Cold War\n* Decolonization\n* Division of Korea\n* First Indochina War\n* Expulsion of Germans\n* Greek Civil War\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAside from the ideological conflict, the mindframe of the leaders of Germany and the Soviet Union, Hitler and Stalin, respectively, contributed to the escalation of terror and murder on an unprecedented scale. Stalin and Hitler both disregarded human life in order to achieve their goal of victory. This included the terrorisation of their own people, as well as mass deportations of entire populations. All these factors resulted in tremendous brutality both to combatants and civilians that found no parallel on the Western Front. According to *Time* magazine: \"By measure of manpower, duration, territorial reach and casualties, the Eastern Front was as much as four times the scale of the conflict on the Western Front that opened with the Normandy invasion.\"[113] Conversely, General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, calculated that without the Eastern Front, the United States would have had to double the number of its soldiers on the Western Front.[114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1941\n* *Barbarossa*\n\t+ Brest\n\t+ Bia\u0142ystok\u2013Minsk\n\t+ 1st Baltic\n\t+ Brody\n\t+ Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina\n\t+ 1st Smolensk\n\t+ Uman\n\t+ Odessa\n\t+ 1st Kiev\n\t+ Tallinn\n\t+ Leningrad\n\t+ Sea of Azov\n\t+ 1st Kharkov\n\t+ 1st Crimea\n\t+ Sevastopol\n\t+ Rostov\n\t+ Gorky\n\t+ Moscow\n* Finland\n* Kerch\n* Chechnya\n* Air war 1941\n\n\n1942\n* Lyuban\n* Barvenkovo\u2013Lozovaya\n* Rzhev\n* Toropets\u2013Kholm\n* Demyansk\n* Kholm\n* 2nd Kharkov\n* *Case Blue*\n* Caucasus\n* Rzhev\u2013Sychyovka\n* Sinyavino\n* Stalingrad\n* Velikiye Luki\n* *Mars*\n* *Little Saturn*\n\n\n1943\n* *Iskra*\n* Ostrogozhsk\u2013Rossosh\n* Voronezh\u2013Kharkov\n* *Polar Star*\n* 3rd Kharkov\n* Gorky Blitz\n* Kursk\n* 1st Donbas\n* Belgorod-Kharkov\n* 2nd Donbas\n* 2nd Smolensk\n\t+ Lenino\n* Dnieper\n* Nevel\n* 2nd Kiev\n\n\n1944\n* Dnieper\u2013Carpathian\n* Leningrad\u2013Novgorod\n* Narva\n* 2nd Crimea\n* 1st Jassy\u2013Kishinev\n* Karelia\n* *Bagration*\n* Lvov\u2013Sandomierz\n* *Doppelkopf*\n* 2nd Jassy\u2013Kishinev\n* Dukla Pass\n* 2nd Baltic\n* Belgrade\n* Debrecen\n* Petsamo\u2013Kirkenes\n* Courland\n* Gumbinnen\n* Budapest\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Axis forces, led by Nazi Germany, began their advance into the Soviet Union under the codename Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, the opening date of the Eastern Front. Initially, Soviet forces were unable to halt the Axis forces, which came close to Moscow. Despite their many attempts, the Axis failed to capture Moscow and soon focused on the oil fields in the Caucasus. German forces invaded the Caucasus under *Fall Blau* (\"Case Blue\") on 28 June 1942. The Soviets successfully halting further Axis advance at Stalingrad \u2014 the bloodiest battle in the war \u2014 lost the Axis powers their morale and became the turning point of the front.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** Askey, Nigel (30 October 2017). \"The Myth of German Superiority on the WW2 Eastern Front\" (PDF). *operationbarbarossa.net/*. For example, my own extensive study of German forces in 1941 (Volume IIA and IIB of 'Operation Barbarossa: the complete Organisational and Statistical Analysis') shows the entire German force on the Eastern Front (up to 4 July 1941) had around 3,359,000 men (page 74, Vol IIB). This includes around 87,600 in the Northern Norway command (Bef. Fin.), and 238,700 in OKH Reserve units (some of which had not yet arrived in the East). It includes all personnel in the German Army (including the security units), Waffen SS, Luftwaffe ground forces and even naval coastal artillery (in the East).

The Germans cut the wire network in all Soviet western military districts to undermine the Red Army's communications.[65] Panicky transmissions from the Soviet front-line units to their command headquarters were picked up like this: \"We are being fired upon. What shall we do?\" The answer was just as confusing: \"You must be insane. And why is your signal not in code?\"[66]\n\n\nAt 03:15 on 22 June 1941, 99 of 190 German divisions, including fourteen panzer divisions and ten motorised, were deployed against the Soviet Union from the Baltic to the Black Sea. They were accompanied by ten Romanian divisions, three Italian divisions, two Slovakian divisions and nine Romanian and four Hungarian brigades.[67] On the same day, the Baltic, Western and Kiev Special military districts were renamed the Northwestern, Western and Southwestern Fronts respectively.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Soviets bury their fallen, July 1944\n![](image)World War II military deaths in Europe by theatre, year\nThe fighting involved millions of Axis and Soviet troops along the broadest land front in military history.

Army Group North became Army Group Courland; Army Group Centre became Army Group North and Army Group A became Army Group Centre. Army Group North (old Army Group Centre) was driven into an ever-smaller pocket around K\u00f6nigsberg in East Prussia.\n\n\nA limited counter-attack (codenamed Operation Solstice) by the newly created Army Group Vistula, under the command of *Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS* Heinrich Himmler, had failed by 24 February, and the Red Army drove on to Pomerania and cleared the right bank of the Oder River. In the south, the German attempts, in Operation Konrad, to relieve the encircled garrison at Budapest failed and the city fell on 13 February. On 6 March, the Germans launched what would be their final major offensive of the war, Operation Spring Awakening, which failed by 16 March. On 30 March the Red Army entered Austria and captured Vienna on 13 April.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the end of the day both sides had fought each other to a standstill, but regardless of the German failure in the north Manstein proposed he continue the attack with the 4th Panzer Army. The Red Army started the strong offensive operation in the northern Orel salient and achieved a breakthrough on the flank of the German 9th Army. Also worried by the Allies' landing in Sicily on 10 July, Hitler made the decision to halt the offensive even as the German 9th Army was rapidly giving ground in the north. The Germans' final strategic offensive in the Soviet Union ended with their defence against a major Soviet counteroffensive that lasted into August.\n\n\nThe Kursk offensive was the last on the scale of 1940 and 1941 that the *Wehrmacht* was able to launch; subsequent offensives would represent only a shadow of previous German offensive might.\n\n\n\n### Autumn and winter 1943\u201344[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The Western Front was marked by two phases of large-scale combat operations. The first phase saw the capitulation of Luxembourg, Netherlands, Belgium, and France during May and June 1940 after their defeat in the Low Countries and the northern half of France, and continued into an air war between Germany and Britain that climaxed with the Battle of Britain. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n39. **^** \"12th Army Group Situation Map for 18 April 1945\".

In doing so, the Germans beat the Allies to the punch; the Allies had been planning an amphibious landing in which they could begin to surround Germany, cutting off her supply of raw materials from Sweden. However, when the Allies made a counter-landing in Norway following the German invasion, the Germans repulsed them and defeated the Norwegian armed forces, driving the latter into exile. The *Kriegsmarine*, nonetheless, suffered very heavy losses during the two months of fighting required to seize all of mainland Norway.\n\n\n\n### Battles for Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and France[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German invasion of Luxembourg, Battle of the Netherlands, Battle of Belgium, and Battle of France\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Topics | * Air warfare of World War II\n\t+ In Europe\n* Blitzkrieg\n* Comparative military ranks\n* Cryptography\n* Declarations of war\n* Diplomacy\n* Governments in exile\n* Home front\n\t+ Australian\n\t+ United Kingdom\n\t+ United States\n* Lend-Lease\n* Manhattan Project\n\t+ British contribution\n* Military awards\n* Military equipment\n* Military production\n* Naval history\n* Nazi plunder\n* Opposition\n* Technology\n\t+ Allied cooperation\n\t+ Mulberry harbour\n* Total war\n* Strategic bombing\n* Puppet states\n* Women\n* Art and World War II\n* Music in World War II\n |\n| Theaters | * Asia and Pacific\n\t+ China\n\t+ South-East Asia\n\t+ Pacific\n\t+ North and Central Pacific\n\t+ South-West Pacific\n\t+ Indian Ocean\n* Europe\n\t+ Western Front\n\t+ Eastern Front\n* Mediterranean and Middle East\n\t+ North Africa\n\t+ East Africa\n\t+ Italy\n* West Africa\n* Atlantic\n\t+ timeline\n* Americas\n |\n| Aftermath | * Chinese Civil War\n* Cold War\n* Decolonization\n* Division of Korea\n* First Indochina War\n* Expulsion of Germans\n* Greek Civil War\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Date | * 3\u00a0September\u00a01939\u00a0\u2013 8\u00a0May\u00a01945\u00a0(1939-09-03\u00a0\u2013 1945-05-08)[nb 2]\n* (5\u00a0years, 8\u00a0months and 5\u00a0days)\n |\n| Location | Northern and Western Europe\n |\n| Result | **1939\u20131940**: Axis victory\n* Occupation of most of Western and Northern Europe by Axis troops\n* End of the French Third Republic and creation of the Vichy regime\n* Strategic stalemate following the Battle of Britain\n* Continuation with the Defense of the Reich and the Battle of the Atlantic\n* Beginning of the North Africa and East Africa campaigns\n\n**1944\u20131945**: Allied victory\n* Fall of Nazi Germany (concurrently with the Eastern Front)\n* Liberation of occupied countries in Western and Northern Europe\n* Beginning of the Iron Curtain and the Cold War\n |\n| Territorialchanges | Partition of Germany (1945) |\n\n |\n| Belligerents |\n| **Allies** ![](image)\u00a0United States![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom\n![](image)\u00a0France\n* ![](image)\u00a0Free France\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe second phase consisted of large-scale ground combat (supported by a massive strategic air war considered to be an additional front), which began in June 1944 with the Allied landings in Normandy and continued until the defeat of Germany in May 1945 with its invasion.\n\n\n\n\n## 1939\u20131940: Axis victories[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 September 1939, World War II began with the German invasion of Poland.

Meanwhile, Germany suffered a more modest 43,110 killed and 111,000 wounded. Hitler had expected a million men to die in the conquest of France. Remarkedly low casualties and France's quick defeat led to a massive rise in morale among the German people. With the fighting ended, the Germans began to consider ways of resolving the question of how to deal with Britain. If the British refused to agree to a peace treaty, one option was to invade. However, Nazi Germany's *Kriegsmarine*, had suffered serious losses in Norway, and in order to even consider an amphibious landing, Germany's Air Force (the Luftwaffe) had to first gain air superiority or air supremacy.\n\n\n\n## 1941\u20131944: Interlude[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Commando raids on the Atlantic Wall and Defence of the Reich\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** German deployments to the Western Front (plus Italy) reached levels as high as approximately 40% of their ground forces, and 75% of the Luftwaffe.

However, in the meantime, the Allies took the war to Germany, with a strategic bombing campaign the US Eighth Air Force bombing Germany by day and RAF Bomber Command bombing by night. The bulk of the Allied armies were occupied in the Mediterranean, seeking to clear the sea lanes to the Indian Ocean and capture the Foggia Airfield Complex.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Allies had been arguing about whether to advance on a broad-front or a narrow-front from before D-Day.[32] If the British had broken out of the Normandy bridgehead (or beachhead) around Caen when they launched Operation Goodwood and pushed along the coast, facts on the ground might have turned the argument in favour of a narrow front. However, as the breakout took place during Operation Cobra at the western end of the bridge-head, the 21st Army Group that included the British and Canadian forces swung east and headed for Belgium, the Netherlands and Northern Germany, while the U.S. Twelfth Army Group advanced to their south via eastern France, Luxembourg and the Ruhr Area, rapidly fanning out into a broad front. As this was the strategy favoured by the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, and most of the American high command, it was soon adopted.\n\n\n\n### Liberation of France[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** Frumkin 1951, p.\u00a0144\n28. **^** \"Hvor mange dr\u00e6bte danskere?\".

Overmans (p. 288f.) considers it \"plausible, though not provable\" that these additional 700,000 perished in Soviet captivity.) Nevertheless, Overmans claims (pp. 275, 279) that all 1,230,045 deaths occurred during the period from January to May 1945. He states that about 2/3 of these deaths occurred on the Eastern Front, without explaining how he arrived at this proportion (according to Table 59 on p. 277, there were 883,130 deaths on the Eastern Front between June and December 1944, and according to Table 53 on p. 266 there were 244,891 deaths on the Western Front in the whole of 1944; the relation between these two figures is 78.29% in the East vs. 21.71% in the West). This would leave 410,000 deaths attributable to the Western Allied invasion of Germany between January and May 1945. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn their hurry to re-arm, Britain and France had both begun to buy large numbers of weapons from manufacturers in the United States at the outbreak of hostilities, supplementing their own production. The non-belligerent United States contributed to the Western Allies by discounted sales of military equipment and supplies. German efforts to interdict the Allies' trans-Atlantic trade at sea ignited the Battle of the Atlantic.\n\n\n\n### Operation Weser\u00fcbung[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGerman losses are much more difficult to deal with, as different sources claim conflicting information. According to George Marshall, the Germans lost 263,000 killed. German historian R\u00fcdger Overmans points to other numbers: 244,891 killed and missing on the Western Front in 1944. He also claims that in the \"final battles\" from January to May 1945, Germany lost 1,230,000 killed and missing, of which 1/3 on the Western Front. Due to low morale, the Germans often surrendered. Unlike their colleagues on the Eastern Front and their Japanese colleagues, the Wehrmacht did not fight to the last and for the most part surrendered when the defeat was obvious. 7,614,790 were held in POW camps by early June of 1945 (including 3,404,950 who were disarmed following the surrender of Germany).[9] See also: Disarmed Enemy Forces\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Ultimately under the command of Field Marshal Harold Alexander, the supreme commander of the Mediterranean, not Eisenhower.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Vichy officially pursued a policy of armed neutrality and conducted military actions against armed incursions from both Axis and Allied belligerents. The cease fire and pledging of allegiance to the Allies of the Vichy troops in French North Africa during Operation Torch convinced the Axis that Vichy could no longer be trusted to continue this policy, so they invaded and occupied the French rump state in November 1942. Collaborationist units, such as the Milice, continued to fight alongside German troops against French Resistance fighters until the liberation of France in 1944.\n2. **^** Interlude with only minimal activity, excluding the Battle of Britain and The Blitz, between 25 June 1940 to 6 June 1944\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe French forces launched a small offensive, the Saar Offensive against Germany in the Saar region but halted their advance and returned.

At the Maginot Line on the other side of the border, French troops stood facing them, whilst the British Expeditionary Force and other elements of the French Army created a defensive line along the Belgian border. There were only some local, minor skirmishes.

In turn, it commanded three groups: the Wehrmacht Netherlands Command (*Wehrmachtbefehlshaber Niederlande*) or WBN, covering the Dutch and Belgian coasts and Army Group B, covering the coast of northern France with the German 15th Army (HQ in Tourcoing), in the area north of the Seine; the 7th Army, (HQ in Le Mans), between the Seine and the Loire defending the English Channel and the Atlantic coast, and Army Group G with responsibility for the Bay of Biscay coast and Vichy France, with its 1st Army, (HQ in Bordeaux), responsible for the Atlantic coast between the Loire and the Spanish border and the 19th Army, (HQ in Avignon), responsible for the Mediterranean coast.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder the onslaught in both the north and south of France, the German Army fell back. On 19 August, the French Resistance (FFI) organised a general uprising and the liberation of Paris took place on 25 August when general Dietrich von Choltitz accepted the French ultimatum and surrendered to general Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, commander of the Free French 2nd Armored Division, ignoring orders from Hitler that Paris should be held to the last and destroyed.\n\n\nThe liberation of Northern France and the Benelux countries was of special significance for the inhabitants of London and the southeast of England because it denied the Germans launch sites for their mobile V-1 and V-2 *Vergeltungswaffen* (reprisal weapons).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Bradley warned that capturing a city located in a region that the Soviets had already received at the Yalta Conference might cost 100,000 casualties,[43] by 15 April Eisenhower ordered all armies to halt when they reached the Elbe and Mulde Rivers, thus immobilizing these spearheads while the war continued for three more weeks. 21st Army Group was then instead ordered to move northeast toward Bremen and Hamburg. While the U.S. Ninth and First Armies held their ground from Magdeburg through Leipzig to western Czechoslovakia, Eisenhower ordered three Allied field armies (1st French, and the U.S. Seventh and Third Armies) into southeastern Germany and Austria. Advancing from northern Italy, the British Eighth Army[a] pushed to the borders of Yugoslavia to defeat the remaining *Wehrmacht* elements there.[42] This later caused some friction with the Yugoslav forces, notably around Trieste.\n\n\n\n### End of the Third Reich[edit]\n\n\nMain article: End of World War II in Europe\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Germans had been preparing a massive counter-attack in the West since the Allied breakout from Normandy. The plan called *Wacht am Rhein (\"Watch on the Rhine\")* was to attack through the Ardennes and swing north to Antwerp, splitting the American and British armies. The attack started on 16 December in what became known as the Battle of the Bulge. Defending the Ardennes were troops of the US First Army. Initial successes in bad weather, which gave them cover from the Allied air forces, resulted in a German penetration of over 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) to within less than 16\u00a0km (10\u00a0mi) of the Meuse. Having been taken by surprise, the Allies regrouped and the Germans were stopped by a combined air and land counter-attack which eventually pushed them back to their starting points by 25 January 1945.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** R\u00fcdiger Overmans, *Deutsche milit\u00e4rische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg*, Oldenbourg 2000. pp. 265, 266, 275 and 279.

As for 1945, Overmans claims that the German armed forces suffered 1,230,045 deaths in the \"Final Battles\" on the Eastern and Western Fronts from January to May 1945. This figure is broken down as follows (p. 272): 401,660 fallen, 131,066 dead from other causes, 697,319 missing. The number of missing obviously includes soldiers who fell into captivity and died there, possibly months or years later. (The number of deaths in captivity calculated by Overmans is about 459,000, thereof 363,000 in Soviet captivity (p. 286). Overmans' figure of deaths in Soviet captivity is about 700,000 lower than the number (ca. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Nov 1940 | * Battle of Gabon\n |\n| Jun 1941 | * Syria\u2013Lebanon campaign\n |\n| Dec 1941 | * Capture of Saint Pierre and Miquelon\n |\n| Nov 1942 | * Operation Torch\n* Tunisian campaign\n* Battle of R\u00e9union\n |\n| Sept 1943 | * Liberation of Corsica\n |\n| Jan 1944 | * Battle of Vercors\n* Battle of Gli\u00e8res\n |\n| March 1944 | * Liberation of Limousin\n |\n| May 1944 | * Battle of Mont Mouchet\n |\n| Jun 1944 | * Operation Overlord\n* Battle of Carentan\n* Battle of Cherbourg\n* Battle for Caen\n* Liberation of Limousin\n* Tulle massacre\n* Liberation of Gu\u00e9ret[fr]\n* Oradour-sur-Glane massacre\n* Maquis de Saint-Marcel\n* Maquis de Saffr\u00e9\n* Battle of Ushant\n |\n| July 1944 | * Liberation of Saint-L\u00f4\n* Battle of Mont Gargan[fr]\n* Operation Cobra\n |\n| Aug 1944 | * Battle for Brittany\n\t+ Rennes\n\t+ Saint-Malo\n\t+ Liberation of Brest\n\t+ Atlantic pockets:\n\t\t- Lorient\n\t\t- Saint-Nazaire\n* Lioran[fr]\n* \u00c9gletons[fr]\n* Battle of Port Cros\n* Battle of La Ciotat\n* Provence landings\n* Liberation of Toulon\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The key events on the Western Front included:\n\n1. **1940 Axis Victories**: The Germans launched the Battle of France, employing the \"blitzkrieg\" strategy, leading to the collapse of the Western Allies and the trapping of the British Expeditionary Force in Flanders. The Belgian, Dutch, and Luxembourg armies surrendered quickly.\n\n2. **1941-1944 Interlude**: There was minimal land-fighting on the Western Front, with commando raids and resistance actions. The Allies focused on strategic bombing campaigns and operations in the Mediterranean.\n\n3. **1944-1945 Second Front**: The Allied landings in Normandy in June 1944 marked the beginning of large-scale ground combat. The Battle of Normandy and subsequent operations led to the defeat of Germany in May 1945.\n\n4. **Liberation of France**: The French Resistance organized a general uprising, leading to the liberation of Paris on August 25, 1944. The Allies advanced through France, pushing the German Army back.\n\n5. **End of the Third Reich**: The Germans launched a massive counter-attack in the Ardennes in December 1944, known as the Battle of the Bulge. The Allies regrouped and pushed the Germans back by January 1945.\n\n6. **Casualties and Surrender**: The combined Allied armies suffered significant casualties, with over 375,000 killed or wounded in the initial phase. Germany suffered lower casualties but faced defeat and surrender.\n\nThese events on the Western Front played a crucial role in the overall outcome of World War II in Europe.",

It was defined by the Allied powers' Pacific Ocean Area command, which included most of the Pacific Ocean and its islands, while mainland Asia was excluded, as were the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Borneo, Australia, most of the Territory of New Guinea, and the western part of the Solomon Islands.\n\n\nIt officially came into existence on March 30, 1942, when US Admiral Chester Nimitz was appointed *Supreme Allied Commander Pacific Ocean Areas*.[1] In the other major theater in the Pacific region, known as the South West Pacific theater, Allied forces were commanded by US General Douglas MacArthur. Both Nimitz and MacArthur were overseen by the US Joint Chiefs and the Western Allies Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCoS).\n\n\nMost Japanese forces in the theater were part of the **Combined Fleet** (\u9023\u5408\u8266\u968a, *Reng\u014d Kantai*) of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), which was responsible for all Japanese warships, naval aircraft, and marine infantry units. The *Reng\u014d Kantai* was led by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, until he was killed in an attack by U.S. fighter planes in April 1943.[2] Yamamoto was succeeded by Admiral Mineichi Koga (1943\u201344)[2] and Admiral Soemu Toyoda (1944\u201345).[3] The **General Staff**  (\u53c2\u8b00\u672c\u90e8, *Sanb\u014d Honbu*) of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) was responsible for Imperial Japanese Army ground and air units in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. The IJN and IJA did not formally use joint/combined staff at the operational level, and their command structures/geographical areas of operations overlapped with each other and those of the Allies.\n\n\nIn the Pacific Ocean theater, Japanese forces fought primarily against the United States Navy, the U.S. Army, which had 6 Corps and 21 Divisions, and the U.S. Marine Corps, which had only 6 Divisions. The United Kingdom (British Pacific Fleet), New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and other Allied nations, also contributed forces.\n\n\n\n## Major campaigns and battles[edit]\n\n\n* Pacific Theater\n\t+ Attack on Pearl Harbor 7 December 1941[4]\n\t+ Battle of Wake Island 7\u201323 December 1941[5]\n\t+ Philippines campaign  8 December 1941 \u2013 8 May 1942\n\t\t- Battle of Bataan\n\t\t- Battle of Corregidor\n\t+ Battle of Ambon\n\t+ Battle of Timor\n\t+ Battle of Rabaul\n\t+ Battle of the Java Sea\n\t+ Bombing of Darwin\n\t+ Battle of the Coral Sea 4\u20138 May 1942\n\t+ Doolittle Raid 18 April 1942[4]\n\t+ Battle of Midway 4\u20137 June 1942[4]\n\t+ Guadalcanal campaign 7 August 1942 to 9 February 1943\n\t\t- Battle of Savo Island\n\t\t- Battle of Cape Esperance\n\t\t- Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal\n\t\t- Battle of Tassafaronga\n\t+ New Guinea campaign\n\t+ Solomon Islands Campaign\n\t+ Battle of the Bismark Sea\n\t+ Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign 1943\u201344\n\t\t- Makin Island raid 17\u201318 August 1942[6]\n\t\t- Battle of Tarawa 20 November 1943[4]\n\t\t- Battle of Makin 20\u201323 November 1943\n\t\t- Battle of Kwajalein 14 February 1944[7]\n\t\t- Battle of Eniwetok 17 February 1944[8]\n\t+ Attack on Truk Island 17\u201318 February 1944\n\t+ Mariana and Palau Islands campaign 1944\n\t\t- Battle of Saipan 15 June 1944[9]\n\t\t- Battle of the Philippine Sea 19\u201321 June 1944[10]\n\t\t- Battle of Guam 21 July 1944[11]\n\t\t- Battle of Tinian 24 July 1944[11]\n\t\t- Battle of Peleliu 15 September 1944[12]\n\t\t- Battle of Angaur 17 September 1944[12]\n\t\t- Battle of Leyte 17 October 1944\n\t\t- Battle of Luzon 9 January 1945\n\t+ Battle of Iwo Jima 19 February 1945[4]\n\t+ Battle of Okinawa 1 April 1945[4]\n* North Pacific Theater\n\t+ Aleutian Islands Campaign 1942\u201343\n\t+ Battle of the Komandorski Islands 26 March 1943[4]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Cressman 2000, p.\u00a084.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Potter & Nimitz 1960, p.\u00a0717.\n3. **^** Potter & Nimitz 1960, pp.\u00a0759\u201360.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** Silverstone 1968, pp.\u00a09\u201311.\n5. **^** Potter & Nimitz 1960, pp.\u00a0651\u201362.\n6. **^** Kafka & Pepperburg 1946, p.\u00a0185.\n7. **^** Potter & Nimitz 1960, p.\u00a0751.\n8. **^** Ofstie 1946, p.\u00a0194.\n9. **^** Potter & Nimitz 1960, p.\u00a0761.\n10. **^** Potter & Nimitz 1960, p.\u00a0765.\n11. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Potter & Nimitz 1960, p.\u00a0770.\n12. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Ofstie 1946, p.\u00a0275.\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* Cressman, Robert J.

It included campaigns fought in the Libyan and Egyptian deserts (Western Desert campaign, also known as the Desert War) and in Morocco and Algeria (Operation Torch), as well as Tunisia (Tunisia campaign). The campaign was fought between the Allies and the Axis Powers. The Allied war effort was dominated by the British Commonwealth and exiles from German-occupied Europe. The United States officially entered the war in December 1941 and began direct military assistance in North Africa on 11 May 1942.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Willmott, H.P. (1984). *June, 1944*.

After Operation Torch, the Anglo-American landings in North-West Africa in November 1942 and fighting against Vichy France forces (which then changed sides), the Allies trapped about 250,000 German and Italian personnel in northern Tunisia, forcing their surrender in May 1943.\n\n\nInformation gleaned via British Ultra code-breaking was important in the Allied victory in North Africa. The Italian campaign followed, which culminated in the downfall of the fascist government in Italy and the elimination of Germany's main European ally. German and Italian forces committed atrocities against prisoners of war and Jewish, Berber and Arab populations.\n\n\n\n\n## Western Desert campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Western Desert campaign\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: Jews outside Europe under Axis occupation\n\nThe North African campaign was often labeled a \"war without hate\", a pure military clash in the desert without the partisan roundups and ethnic cleansing happening in Europe. This view has been challenged by recent historians, given that there were indeed many civilians who lived in the region,[73] and the campaign was marked by numerous atrocities and abuses by both Italian and German forces towards Allied prisoners of war and local Jewish, Berber, and Arab populations.[74] These acts were often motivated by racism and antisemitism.[75]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wehrmacht fuel barrel in Tunisia, 2010\nAfter victory by the Allies in the North African campaign, the stage was set for the Italian campaign to begin. The invasion of Sicily followed two months later. Nearly 400,000 Axis and Allied troops were lost, injured or died of disease by the end of the North African campaign.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCampaigns of World\u00a0War\u00a0II\n |\n| --- |\n| **Europe**\n* Poland\n* Phoney War\n* Finland\n\t+ Winter War\n\t+ Karelia\n\t+ Lapland\n* Denmark and Norway\n* Western Front\n\t+ 1940\n\t+ 1944\u20131945\n* Britain\n* Balkans\n* Eastern Front\n* Italy\n\t+ Sicily\n\n\n**Asia-Pacific**\n\n* China\n* Pacific Ocean\n\t+ South West Pacific\n* Franco-Thai War\n* South-East Asia\n* Burma and India\n* Japan\n* Manchuria and Northern Korea\n\t+ pre-war border conflicts\n\n\n**Mediterranean and Middle East**\n\n* Africa\n\t+ North Africa\n\t+ East Africa\n* Mediterranean Sea\n* Adriatic\n* Malta\n* Middle East\n\t+ Iraq\n\t+ Syria\u2013Lebanon\n\t+ Iran\n* Dodecanese\n* Southern France\n\n\n**Other campaigns**\n\n* Americas\n* Atlantic\n* Arctic\n* Strategic bombing\n* French West Africa\n* Indian Ocean\n\t+ Madagascar\n\n\n**Coups**\n\n* Yugoslavia\n* Iraq\n* Italy\n* Romania\n* Bulgaria\n* Hungary\n* French Indochina\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNorth African campaign\n |\n| --- |\n| **Western Desert campaign**\n\n- Invasion of Egypt\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Atkinson, Rick (2004) [2002]. *An Army at Dawn: The War in North Africa, 1942\u20131943*.

During Operation Torch, Americans fought Vichy French and German navy vessels in the Naval Battle of Casablanca, which ended in an American victory.\n\n\nThe Allied landings prompted the Axis occupation of Vichy France (Case Anton). In addition, the Italians captured the French fleet at Toulon, which did them little good, as the main portion of the fleet had been scuttled to prevent their use by the Axis.\n\n\nThe Vichy Army in North Africa joined the Allies.\n\n\n\n## Tunisian campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tunisian campaign\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter receiving supplies and reinforcements from Tripoli, the Axis attacked again, defeating the Allies in the Battle of Gazala in June and capturing Tobruk. The Axis forces drove the Eighth Army back over the Egyptian border, but their advance was stopped in July only 90 miles (140\u00a0km) from Alexandria in the First Battle of El Alamein.\n\n\nOf great significance, on 29 June reports of British military operations in North Africa sent to Washington by the US military attach\u00e9 in Cairo, Bonner Fellers, no longer used the compromised \"Black Code\" which the Axis forces had been reading, so the Axis could no longer learn of British \"strengths, positions, losses, reinforcements, supply, situation, plans, morale etc\" as they had since 1940.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Rochat, Giorgio. *Le guerre italiane 1935\u20131943.

On 14 June, the British 11th Hussars and part of the 1st Royal Tank Regiment, 1st RTR) crossed the border from Egypt into Libya and captured Fort Capuzzo. This was followed by an Italian counter-offensive into Egypt and the capture of Sidi Barrani in September. The British recaptured Sidi Barrani in December during Operation Compass. The Italian 10th Army was destroyed and the German *Afrika Korps* was dispatched to North Africa in February 1941 in Operation Sonnenblume to reinforce Italians and prevent an Axis defeat.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn early December, the Allies were met with the reality that they would not be successful in capturing the key cities of Tunis and Bizerta. The air campaigns by the Axis forces proved to be a difficult challenge for the British forces. However, the Allies were left with the advantage of having secured the island of Malta, enabling the Allies to carry out future aerial operations. Additionally, on land, allied British and American forces were able to hold onto their possessions. On December 4, 1942, the Allied Force Headquarters in North Africa reported that military operations were ongoing in the Tebourba area. The Axis powers attempted a second counter-attack in the neighborhood of Tebourba following their failed attempt on December 1. The attack was successfully repulsed by the Allied powers, and the enemy sustained significant damage to their weaponry. During the winter, there followed a period of stalemate during which time both sides continued to build up their forces. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prelude | * Africa\n\t+ Second Italo-Ethiopian War\n* Asia\n\t+ Second Sino-Japanese War\n\t+ Battles of Khalkhin Gol\n* Europe\n\t+ Anschluss\n\t+ Munich Agreement\n\t+ Occupation of Czechoslovakia\n\t+ Operation Himmler\n\t+ Italian invasion of Albania\n |\n| 1939 | * Invasion of Poland\n* Battle of the Atlantic\n* Phoney War\n* First Battle of Changsha\n* Battle of South Guangxi\n* Winter War\n* 1939\u20131940 Winter Offensive\n |\n| 1940 | * Norwegian campaign\n* German invasion of Denmark\n* Battle of Zaoyang\u2013Yichang\n* German invasion of Luxembourg\n* German invasion of the Netherlands\n* German invasion of Belgium\n* Battle of France\n* Dunkirk evacuation\n* Battle of Britain\n* Battle of the Mediterranean\n* North Africa\n* West Africa\n* British Somaliland\n* Hundred Regiments Offensive\n* Baltic states\n* Eastern Romania\n* Japanese invasion of French Indochina\n* Italian invasion of Greece\n* *Compass*\n |\n| 1941 | * Battle of South Henan\n* Battle of Shanggao\n* Invasion of Yugoslavia\n* German invasion of Greece\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe British Eighth Army bypassed the Axis defence on the Mareth Line in late March after harsh fighting[*citation needed*] and First Army in central Tunisia launched their main offensive in mid-April to squeeze the Axis forces until their resistance in Africa collapsed. The Axis forces surrendered on 13 May 1943 yielding over 275,000 prisoners of war. The last Axis force to surrender in North Africa was the 1st Italian Army of general Messe.[57] This huge loss of experienced troops greatly reduced the military capacity of the Axis powers, although some Axis troops escaped Tunisia. This defeat in Africa led to all Italian colonies in Africa being captured.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Intelligence[edit]\n\n\n### Axis[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy 16 September, the Italian force had advanced to Maktila, around 130 kilometres (80\u00a0mi) west of Mersa Matruh, where they halted due to supply problems.[21] Despite Mussolini urging them to carry on, Graziani ordered his men to dig in around Sidi Barrani, and fortified camps were established in forward locations; additional troops were also positioned behind the main force.[22] In response to the dispersed Italian camps, the British planned a limited five-day attack, Operation Compass, to strike at these fortified camps one by one.[23][24] The British Commonwealth force, totalling 36,000 men,[25] attacked the forward elements of the 10-division-strong Italian army on 9 December.[26] Following their initial success, the forces of Operation Compass[27] pursued the retreating Italian forces.[28] In January, the small port at Bardia was taken,[29] soon followed by the seizure of the fortified port of Tobruk.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSenior U.S. commanders were strongly opposed to proposed landings in North-West Africa. After the western Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS) met in London on 30 July 1942 General George Marshall and Admiral Ernest King declined to approve the plan. Marshall and other U.S. generals advocated the invasion of northern Europe later that year, which the British rejected.[52][53] After Prime Minister Winston Churchill pressed for a landing in French North Africa in 1942, Marshall suggested instead to President Franklin D. Roosevelt that the U.S. abandon the Germany first strategy and take the offensive in the Pacific. Roosevelt said it would do nothing to help Russia.[54] With Marshall unable to persuade the British to change their minds,[55] President Roosevelt gave a direct order that Operation Torch was to have precedence over other operations and was to take place at the earliest possible date, one of only two direct orders he gave to military commanders during the war.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of British military equipment of World War II\n\n\n\n* List of equipment of the United States Army during World War II\n* List of French military equipment of World War II\n* List of German military equipment of World War II\n* List of Italian Army equipment in World War II\n* List of North African campaign battles\n* North African campaign timeline\n* Timelines of World War II by year: 1940\u00a0/ 1941\u00a0/ 1942\u00a0/ 1943\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGeneral Auchinleck, although he had checked Rommel's advance at the First Battle of El Alamein, was replaced by General Harold Alexander. Lieutenant-General William Gott was promoted from XIII Corps commander to command of the entire Eighth Army, but he was killed when his aircraft was intercepted and shot down over Egypt. He was replaced by Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery.\n\n\nAt the end of June, Axis forces made a second attempt to break through the Allied defences at El Alamein at Alam Halfa, but were unsuccessful. After a lengthy period of build-up and training, the Eighth Army launched a major offensive, decisively defeating the Italian-German army in the Second Battle of El Alamein in late October, driving Axis forces west and capturing Tripoli in mid-January 1943. By February, the Eighth Army was facing the Italian-German *Panzer* Army near the Mareth Line and came under command of Alexander's 18th Army Group for the concluding phase of the war in North Africa\u00a0\u2013 the Tunisia campaign.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Operation Torch[edit]\n\n\n![](image)American troops on board a Landing Craft Assault heading into Oran, November 1942\nMain article: Operation Torch\n\nOperation Torch in November 1942 was a compromise operation that met the British objective of securing victory in North Africa while allowing American armed forces the opportunity to engage in the fight against Nazi Germany on a limited scale.[50] In addition, as Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, had long been pleading for a second front to be opened to engage the Wehrmacht and relieve pressure on the Red Army, it provided some degree of relief for the Red Army on the Eastern Front by diverting Axis forces to the North African theatre. Over half the German Ju 52 transport planes that were needed to supply the encircled Axis forces at Stalingrad were tied up supplying Axis forces in North Africa.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 10 June, the Kingdom of Italy aligned itself with Nazi Germany and declared war upon France and the United Kingdom.[13] British forces (along with Indian and Rhodesian troops) based in Egypt were ordered to take defensive measures, but to avoid provocation as much as possible.[14] However, on 11 June they began a series of raids against Italian positions in Libya.[15] Following the defeat of France on 25 June, Italian forces in Tripolitania\u2014facing French troops based in Tunisia\u2014redeployed to Cyrenaica to reinforce the Italian Tenth Army.[16] This, coupled with the steadily degrading equipment of the British forces, led General Archibald Wavell to order an end to the raids and place the defence of the Egyptian border with a small screening force.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Guadalcanal campaign\n* *Torch*\n* Chinese famine of 1942\u20131943\n |\n| 1943 | * Tunisian campaign\n* Battle of West Hubei\n* Battle of Attu\n* Bombing of Gorky\n* Battle of Kursk\n* Allied invasion of Sicily\n* Smolensk\n* Solomon Islands campaign\n* *Cottage*\n* Battle of the Dnieper\n* Allied invasion of Italy\n\t+ Armistice of Cassibile\n* Burma\n* Northern Burma and Western Yunnan\n* Changde\n* Second Battle of Kiev\n* Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign\n\t+ Tarawa\n\t+ Makin\n* Bengal famine of 1943\n |\n| 1944 | * *Tempest*\n* Monte Cassino / Anzio\n* Korsun\u2013Cherkassy\n* Narva\n* *Ichi-Go*\n* *Overlord*\n* *Neptune*\n* Mariana and Palau\n* *Bagration*\n* Western Ukraine\n* Second Battle of Guam\n* Tannenberg Line\n* Warsaw Uprising\n* Eastern Romania\n* Liberation of Paris\n* *Dragoon*\n* Gothic Line\n* Belgrade offensive\n* Lapland\n* *Market Garden*\n* Estonia\n* *Crossbow*\n* *Pointblank*\n* Vietnamese famine of 1944\u20131945\n* Philippines (1944\u20131945)\n* Leyte\n* Syrmian Front\n* Hungary\n\t+ Budapest\n* Burma (1944\u20131945)\n* Ardennes\n\t+ *Bodenplatte*\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe landings started on 8 November, and finished on 16 November. In an attempt to pincer German and Italian forces, Allied forces (American and British Commonwealth) landed in Vichy-held French North Africa under the assumption that there would be little to no resistance. Nevertheless, Vichy French forces put up a strong and bloody resistance to the Allies in Oran and Morocco, but not in Algiers, where a *coup d'\u00e9tat* by the French resistance on 8 November succeeded in neutralizing the French XIX Corps before the landing and arresting the Vichy commanders. Consequently, the landings met no practical opposition in Algiers, and the city was captured on the first day along with the entire Vichy African command. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nZfGen, Volume 17 (2019), Issue 1\u20132, ISSN: 1438-8332, ISSN online: 1438-8332, \"the North African Campaign was anything but war without hate.

Rommel's forces did not have the strength or training to take the fortress. This created a supply problem for his forward units. His front-line positions at Sollum were at the end of an extended supply chain that stretched back to Tripoli and had to bypass the coast road at Tobruk. Further, he was constantly threatened with a breakout of the British forces at Tobruk.[47] Without Tobruk in Axis hands, further advances into Egypt were impractical.[48][49]\n\n\nThe Allies launched a small-scale counter-attack called Operation Brevity in an attempt to push Axis forces off the key passes at the border, with some initial success. However they could not hold the advance positions and followed *Brevity* up with a much larger-scale offensive, Operation Battleaxe intended to relieve the siege at Tobruk, but this operation also failed.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Keegan, John (2001). *Oxford Companion to World War II*.

Two days later, no invasion having been launched, Mussolini ordered Marshal Graziani that, the moment German forces launched Operation Sea Lion to invade Great Britain, he was to attack.[18] Beaten in the Battle of Britain, the German invasion never took place. On 8 September, the Italians\u2014hampered by a lack of transport, enfeebled by the low level of training among officers, and weakened by the state of its supporting equipment[16]\u2014were ordered to invade Egypt the following day.

This would make the most of the natural defensive geography of Central Italy, whilst denying the Allies the easy capture of a succession of airfields, each one being ever closer to Germany.

On the front of the U.S. Fifth Army, divisions drove north toward Austria and northwest to Milan. On the Fifth Army's left flank, the U.S. 92nd Infantry Division (the \"Buffalo Soldiers Division\") went along the coast to Genoa. A rapid advance towards Turin by the Brazilian division on their right took the German\u2013Italian Army of Liguria by surprise, causing its collapse.[57]\n\n\nBetween 26 April and 1 May there were the Battles of Collecchio-Fornovo di Taro, which resulted in the surrender of the 148th German Infantry Division to Brazilian soldiers of the FEB; the Brazilian soldiers captured about 15,000 Italian and Nazi soldiers, the end of these battles marked the end of the conflicts in Italy and the end of the Italian fascist army.[63][64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt is estimated that between September 1943 and April 1945, 60,000\u201370,000 Allied and 38,805\u201350,660 German soldiers died in Italy.[32][j] The number of Allied casualties was about 330,000 and the German figure (excluding those involved in the final surrender) was over 330,000.[32][k] Fascist Italy, prior to its collapse, suffered about 200,000 casualties, mostly prisoners-of-war taken in the invasion of Sicily, including more than 40,000 killed or missing.[34] Over 150,000 Italian civilians died, as did 35,828 anti-fascist partisans and some 35,000 troops of the Italian Social Republic.[35][36][l] On the Western Front of World War II, Italy was the most costly campaign in terms of casualties suffered by infantry forces of both sides, during bitter small-scale fighting around strongpoints at the Winter Line, the Anzio beachhead and the Gothic Line.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** American: 119,279 casualties; Brazilian: 2,211 casualties; British: 89,436 casualties; British Colonial troops: 448 casualties; Canadian: 25,889 casualties; French: 27,625 casualties; Greeks: 452 casualties; Indian, 19,373 casualties; Italian: 4,729 casualties; New Zealand; 8,668 casualties; Polish: 11,217 casualties; South African: 4,168 casualties.[21]\n6. **^** Between 1 September 1943 and 10 May 1944: 87,579 casualties.

In the city itself, anti-Fascist Forces began an uprising, later known as the Four days of Naples, holding out despite continuous German reprisals until the arrival of Allied forces.\n\n\nAs the Allies advanced, they encountered increasingly difficult terrain: the Apennine Mountains form a spine along the Italian peninsula offset somewhat to the east. In the most mountainous areas of Abruzzo, more than half the width of the peninsula comprises crests and peaks over 900 metres (3,000 feet) that are relatively easy to defend; and the spurs and re-entrants to the spine confronted the Allies with a succession of ridges and rivers across their line of advance. The rivers were subject to sudden and unexpected flooding, which had the potential to thwart the Allied commanders' plans.[47]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prelude | * Africa\n\t+ Second Italo-Ethiopian War\n* Asia\n\t+ Second Sino-Japanese War\n\t+ Battles of Khalkhin Gol\n* Europe\n\t+ Anschluss\n\t+ Munich Agreement\n\t+ Occupation of Czechoslovakia\n\t+ Operation Himmler\n\t+ Italian invasion of Albania\n |\n| 1939 | * Invasion of Poland\n* Battle of the Atlantic\n* Phoney War\n* First Battle of Changsha\n* Battle of South Guangxi\n* Winter War\n* 1939\u20131940 Winter Offensive\n |\n| 1940 | * Norwegian campaign\n* German invasion of Denmark\n* Battle of Zaoyang\u2013Yichang\n* German invasion of Luxembourg\n* German invasion of the Netherlands\n* German invasion of Belgium\n* Battle of France\n* Dunkirk evacuation\n* Battle of Britain\n* Battle of the Mediterranean\n* North Africa\n* West Africa\n* British Somaliland\n* Hundred Regiments Offensive\n* Baltic states\n* Eastern Romania\n* Japanese invasion of French Indochina\n* Italian invasion of Greece\n* *Compass*\n |\n| 1941 | * Battle of South Henan\n* Battle of Shanggao\n* Invasion of Yugoslavia\n* German invasion of Greece\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* \"Gothic Line\".

However, German forces soon took control of Northern and Central Italy; Mussolini, who was rescued by German paratroopers, established a collaborationist puppet state, the Italian Social Republic (RSI), to administer the German-occupied territory. The Germans, sometimes with Italian fascists, also committed several atrocities against civilians and non-fascist troops. The Italian Co-Belligerent Army was created to fight against the RSI and its German allies, alongside the large Italian resistance movement, while other Italian troops continued to fight alongside the Germans in the National Republican Army; this period is known as the Italian Civil War. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** Overmans lists the total death toll of German troops in Italy (including Sicily) as 150,660.[27] The US military estimated 91,000 German dead in the Italian campaign, thereof 5,000 in Sicily and 86,000 on the Italian mainland, and 364,189 captured prior to the surrender of Army Group C, thereof 7,100 in Sicily and 357,086 on the Italian mainland[28][29] Including 10 killed, 15 wounded and 800 defected from the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia\n9. **^** \"The surrender of nearly one million men from Army Group C, effective at noon on May 2, brought to an end the Mediterranean struggle that had begun five years earlier.\"[30]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKesselring was given command of the whole of Italy and immediately ordered the preparation of a series of defensive lines across Italy, south of Rome.

The victims were primarily Italian civilians, sometimes in retaliation for partisan attacks, and Italian Jews.[66]\n\n\nApproximately 14,000 Italian non-Jewish civilians, often women, children and elderly, have been documented to have died in over 5,300 individual instances of war crimes committed by Nazi Germany. The largest of those was the Marzabotto massacre, where in excess of 770 civilians were murdered. The Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre saw 560 civilians killed while the Ardeatine massacre saw 335 randomly selected people executed, among them 75 Italian Jews. In the Padule di Fucecchio massacre up to 184 civilians were executed.[67]\n\n\n\n### Allied crimes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Allied war crimes during World War II\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Italian mainland:**[c][d][e]![United States](image): 119,200![United Kingdom](image): 89,440![](image): 35,000![Free France](image): 30,000![Canada](image): 25,890![British Raj](image): 20,000![Poland](image): 11,000![Dominion of New Zealand](image): 8,668![Kingdom of Italy](image): 5,927![Union of South Africa](image): 3,860![Vargas Era](image): 2,300![Kingdom of Greece](image): 452**Total**:358,295\u2013376,637 casualties\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Vehicles**:8,011 aircraft destroyed![United States](image): 3,377 armoured vehicles destroyed[22] | **Sicily:**\n![Fascist Italy](image): 150,000[23]![Nazi Germany](image): 27,940[24][16][25]**Italian mainland:**[f][g][h]![Nazi Germany](image): 336,650\u2013580,630![Italian Social Republic](image): 35,000 (dead only)**Surrender of Caserta:**1,000,000 captured[i][11]**Total**:1,549,590\u20131,793,570 casualties\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Aircraft**:![Nazi Germany](image): ~4,500 aircraft lost[31] |\n| \n152,940 civilians killed |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Royal Artillery\". *www.heritage.nf.ca*.\n2. **^** Gaujac, p. 68\n3. **^** \"Canada and the Italian Campaign\". *www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca*.\n4. **^** Canada, Veterans Affairs (June 23, 2021). \"Canada - Italy 1943-1945 - The Second World War - History - Remembrance - Veterans Affairs Canada\". *www.veterans.gc.ca*.\n5. **^** RAN, n.d., *Sicily 1943* and Australian War Memorial, n.d., *Sicily 1943* Archived 2018-09-23 at the Wayback Machine (23 September 2018)\n6. **^** \"History\". *hrad.army.cz*.
