Figures are given in United States dollars (USD). Many films that were released during the 20th century do not appear on this list as figures have not been adjusted for inflation, and as a result the films on this list have all had a theatrical run (including re-releases) since 2004. Films that have not played since then do not appear on the chart due to ticket price inflation, population size, and ticket purchasing trends not being considered. If inflation were adjusted for, *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* would appear at the top of the chart with an adjusted gross of $1,977,000,000.[2][nb 1] All except two\u2014*The Simpsons Movie* and the original 1994 version of *The Lion King*\u2014are computer-animated films. *Despicable Me* is the most represented franchise with all five films in the top 50 highest-grossing animated films. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe top 48 films listed are also among the 50 highest-grossing animated films and the top 11 are among the 50 highest-grossing films, each having grossed in excess of $1\u00a0billion worldwide.\n\n\n\n\u2020\u00a0*Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 7 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | $100,000,000 | [# 4][# 5] |\n\n\n* ( ... ) Since grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs, a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known.\n* \\*U.S. and Canada gross only\n* ITItaly only\n* ESSpanish only\n* SWSwedish gross only\n* NWNorwegian gross only\n* AUAustralian gross only\n* JPJapanese gross only\n* RDistributor rental\n* TBDTo be determined\n* N/ANot applicable; no animated feature length film was released in that year.\n* HFilms contain animated/live-action scenes.\n\n\n## Timeline of highest-grossing animated films[edit]\n\n\nAt least eight animated films have held the record of highest-grossing animated film at different times. Four of these were Disney films and two by Pixar. *Shrek 2*, made by DreamWorks Animation, is the only film on the list not produced by Disney or Pixar.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIncluded in the list are charts of the top box-office earners, a chart of high-grossing animated films by the calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing animated film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing animated film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe following chart is a list of the highest-grossing animated film franchises. The top three are among the highest-grossing film franchises of all time and, respectively, are ranked 15th, 17th, and 20th of all time. Pixar is the most represented studio with five franchises on this list. *Despicable Me* is the highest-grossing animated franchise of all time with $4.6\u00a0billion; it is also one of three animated franchises (*Toy Story* and *Frozen*) with two films grossing over $1\u00a0billion worldwide. *Frozen* is the only animated franchise where every installment grossed $1\u00a0billion; it has the highest per-film average, with nearly $1.4\u00a0billion unadjusted.

They concluded that the first film successfully combined the two elements.[5] Allison Schroeder was hired to assist Lee with the script in August 2018 after Lee succeeded Lasseter as Disney Animation's CCO;[29] Lee was credited as the film's screenwriter, and Schroeder was credited with additional screenplay material.[30] The film's story contributions were made by Lee, Buck, Marc Smith, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, and Robert Lopez.[31] Overall, the budget was approximately $150\u00a0million.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMegan Harding (who had directed a 2014 making-of ABC television special about *Frozen*) reached out to Disney Animation about documenting the production of *Frozen II*; with the company's cooperation, Harding, working with Lincoln Square Productions, commuted from New York City to Burbank, California and shot 1,300 hours of footage in 115 days between December 2018 and the November 2019 world premiere.[74] She edited the footage[115] down to six episodes, about 35 to 45 minutes long.[74] Disney Animation knew that Harding intended to take a \"fearless\" and \"honest look\" at the filmmaking process; her crew was asked to leave only once,[73] when the production team wanted to decide the mysterious voice's identity.[50] The documentary series, *Into the Unknown: Making Frozen II*, was released on June 26, 2020.[74]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Box office | $1.453\u00a0billion |\n\n\n***Frozen 2*** (stylized as ***Frozen II***) is a 2019 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures as the sequel to *Frozen* (2013). Produced by Peter Del Vecho, the film was directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee from a screenplay by Lee. The directors co-wrote the story with Marc Smith, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, and Robert Lopez. It stars the voices of Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Josh Gad, and Jonathan Groff. Set three years after the first film, *Frozen II* follows sisters Anna and Elsa, and their companions Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf as they travel to an enchanted forest to unravel the origin of Elsa's magical power.

The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $1.450\u00a0billion worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the third-highest-grossing film of 2019, the tenth-highest-grossing film of all time, and the second-highest-grossing animated film of all time. It also held the title of the highest-grossing worldwide opening of all time for an animated film for three years. *Frozen II* received a nomination for Best Original Song at the 92nd Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Two sequels are in development.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Frozen II* was greenlit in March 2015 after a company debate about whether it would be perceived as inferior to the original. It used more-complex, enhanced animation technology than *Frozen*, and was an interdepartmental collaboration. Anderson-Lopez and Lopez returned as the film's songwriters, and Christophe Beck again composed the score. The film was translated into 46 languages and was accompanied by *Into the Unknown: Making Frozen II*, a documentary series.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"2015 Meeting of Shareholders\" (PDF).

According to Del Vecho, the scene \"required all of the resources at the studio\" to get the film done on time.[23] Lopez said that the first draft of \"Show Yourself\" was very different from its final version.[51] Megan Harding directed an official documentary series on the production of *Frozen II*, which depicted the process of Del Vecho and Lopez determining The Voice's identity. Once the production team settled on Queen Iduna, the lyrics of \"Show Yourself\" finally began to come together, but then the studio's artists, designers, and animators needed to quickly figure out how to stage the dramatic culmination of Elsa's journey towards becoming the Snow Queen.[50] The film was edited by Jeff Draheim.[52]\n\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Frozen II* received generally positive reviews.[138][139][140] It has an approval rating of 77% based on 336 professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.7/10, lower than *Frozen*'s 90% rating out of 251 reviews. The former's critical consensus reads, \"*Frozen II* can't quite recapture the showstopping feel of its predecessor, but it remains a dazzling adventure into the unknown.\"[141][142] Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned *Frozen II* a score of 64 out of 100 score based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\", whereas *Frozen* received a higher 75 score out of 48 critics.[143][144] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A\u2212 (lower than *Frozen*'s A+) on an A+ to F scale,[145] and PostTrak rated it 4.5 out of five stars on the film's opening day.[123]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n148. ^ ***a*** ***b*** McCarthy, Todd (November 14, 2019). \"*Frozen 2*: Film Review\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

The production team realized they needed to clarify the identity of the Voice and the point of Elsa's transformation, and add more comedy and shots of Bruni (the fire salamander). A scene of expository dialogue in which the lead characters explained to the people trapped in the Enchanted Forest why they had come there was replaced with Olaf's humorous recap of *Frozen*. Due to the changes, the animators needed to create 61 new shots and redo another 35. An undisclosed number of shots were cut from the finished film; about a dozen animators and artists worked for two months on an elaborate resurrection scene for Olaf before it was cut.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n40. **^** Nyren, Erin (November 12, 2019). \"Sterling K.

Horn said that a sequel would not be immediately forthcoming because the studio was focusing on a Broadway musical adaptation of *Frozen*.[19][20] In a May 2014 CNBC interview with David Faber, Disney CEO Bob Iger said that the company would not force the development of a sequel, because it was concerned about not living up to the first film. Iger said that the *Frozen* franchise \"is something that is kind of forever for the company\", similar to *The Lion King*.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Frozen II*'s animation software was influenced by the software in several other Disney films. Anna's hair was animated with Quicksilver, developed for *Moana* (2016) to deal with wind; for Elsa's hair, the lighting software Beast was used. A vocal coach instructed the animators on how a singer would breathe.[65] The animators then spent about eight months creating N\u00f8kk, which has a liquid appearance, with effects supervised by Erin Ramos. *J\u00f6tunns* had a long rigging process to avoid making rocks distracting.[30] The water simulation was intended to be more realistic than in *Moana*.[66] To create Gale, the wind spirit, a tool called Swoop was developed. They later received real-time feedback from the supervisors, directors, and producer.[67][68]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Frozen II* (soundtrack)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Robinson, Tasha (November 22, 2019). \"*Frozen 2*'s post-credits scene is a cute gag with creepy implications\". *Polygon*.

Dargis cited *Frozen II*'s engaging visual imagery, balanced by romance and history, and Minow noted the film's autumnal palette.[31][146] Peter Travers (*Rolling Stone*), Simran Hans (*The Guardian*), and Todd McCarthy (*The Hollywood Reporter*) praised the film. Travers, who enjoyed reconnecting with the characters, called the animation stunning and referred to the music as \"tantalizing earworms\". Hans compared the film's narrative to real-world efforts to mitigate climate change. McCarthy praised its \"catchy songs\", \"easy-to-like characters\", and \"astonishing backdrops\", with humor and a plot driven by \"female empowerment galore\".[147][148][149]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Joff\u00e9 met Nintendo of America president and Hiroshi Yamauchi's son-in law, Minoru Arakawa. He presented Arakawa with an initial draft of the script. One month after their meeting, Joff\u00e9 went to Nintendo's headquarters in Kyoto to meet Hiroshi Yamauchi.

The setting was inspired by the game *Super Mario World* (1990) with elements drawn from fairy tales and contemporary American culture.

Gilchrist was hired to get the most out of the low-quality VHS. The film is extended by twenty minutes in this cut, with additional scenes including Koopa devolving a technician into slime for the crime of sneezing, Mario's rivalry with the mafia-affiliated Scapelli plumbing company, and an anti-Koopa rap by Spike and Iggy at the Boom Boom Bar, backed up with scantily clad lizard dancers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Beck, Marilyn (December 8, 1990). \"Danny DiVito may be a super 'Mario Brother'\". *The News*.[*permanent dead link*]\n18. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Owen, Luke (2017). *Lights, Camera GAME OVER!: How Video Game Movies Get Made*.

A month later, Disney announced that the film would be computer-animated instead of the initially planned traditional animation.[47] Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez joined the project and started writing songs for *Frozen* in January 2012.[48]:\u200a44:00 On March 5, 2012, it was announced that Buck would be directing, with Lasseter and Peter Del Vecho producing.[49] Lasseter was later credited as executive producer.[1]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** Fischer, Russ (January 11, 2012). \"Disney's \"Frozen\", Formerly \"The Snow Queen\", Will Be CG Rather Than Hand-Drawn\". */Film*.

Laili said that the film promotes feminism and challenges traditional gender stereotypes including rational thought, meritocracy, and various aspects of socio-political life.[113] Elsa assumes her responsibility as queen and stresses understanding her powers and determining the future.[114] She denies Anna's marriage request to Hans because Anna had only just met him.[115] Anna assumes her responsibility to save Arendelle from Elsa's powers and denies male companionship.[116] They work together to defeat the antagonist, Hans.[114] In the song \"Let It Go\", Elsa undergoes a self-transformation, shedding her societal constraints and embracing her power. She discards the gloves that her parents gave her to obstruct her powers, and she her modest attire with a thigh-high slit dress and silver-white high heels. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** McCarthy, Todd (November 3, 2013). \"Frozen: Film Review\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

Bird stated that the lingering plotlines could lead to a third installment, just as they did with the second. \"There were a lot of ideas that we had on this film that could be [used]... whether it's another *Incredibles* film, or something else.\" Cast members including Samuel L.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"*Incredibles 2* reunites Pixar's family crimefighting team for a long-awaited follow-up that may not quite live up to the original, but comes close enough to earn its name.\"[79] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[80] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score as the first film, and those at PostTrak gave the film a 93% overall positive score and an 83% \"definite recommend\".[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne advantage that Pixar had with *Incredibles 2* was the advancement of technology the company had seen since the original film and a team of much more experienced animators. Producer John Walker said, \"I think that one of the things that excited Brad and Ralph Eggleston, the production designer, was that the technology existed now to finally realize the designs in the way that they had hoped to realize them in 2004. There were no notions of, 'Well, we don't know how to do long hair, we don't know how to do humans, we don't know how to do muscles.' Everybody knows how to do it. It's just now about doing it quickly.\"[31] Because Pixar no longer used the same systems from the first film, all the characters had to be created from scratch on the computer again. The studio also used physically based human eye models for the characters for the first time, which possibly made the eyes larger and more stylized than that of real humans.[32]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Incredibles 2* (soundtrack)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the Disney shareholder meeting in March 2014, Disney CEO and chairman Bob Iger confirmed that Pixar was working on an *Incredibles* sequel, and that Bird would return as both director and screenwriter.[20] Bird started the script around April 2015,[21] and said that the *Incredibles* sequel would be his next film after *Tomorrowland*.[22]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n55. **^** \"All Time Domestic Box Office\".

For me, the interesting thing was never the superhero part of it. It was more the family dynamic, and how do superhero things play into that.\"[24] He said he wanted to include some unused ideas from the first film,[25][26] and that the new story would focus on Helen Parr / Elastigirl.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn its second weekend the film dropped 56% to $80.9\u00a0million, finishing second behind newcomer *Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom* ($148\u00a0million), marking the first time two films opened to over $100\u00a0million in back-to-back weekends.[68] It remained in second place in its third weekend, grossing $45.5\u00a0million and third in its fourth weekend with $29\u00a0million, respectively.[54] On July 7, its 23rd day of release, the film crossed $495\u00a0million, passing *Finding Dory* to become the highest-grossing animated film and Pixar's highest-grossing film of all time domestically,[69] and the following day became the first animated film to gross over $500\u00a0million domestically.[70] On September 2, its 80th day of release, it became the first animated film to gross over $600\u00a0million domestically.[71] *Incredibles 2* ended its run at the box office as the third highest-grossing film of 2018 behind *Black Panther* and *Avengers: Infinity War*.[72]\n\n\n\n#### Internationally[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn April 2018, early box office projections had *Incredibles 2* grossing $110\u00a0million in its opening weekend in the United States and Canada.[59] In May 2018, a month before the film's release, tracking revised to an opening weekend of $140\u00a0million or more.[60] A week prior to the film's opening, Fandango reported that pre-sale of tickets for the film had exceeded that of previous mid-year blockbusters *Finding Dory*, *Wonder Woman*, *Spider-Man: Homecoming* and *Suicide Squad* at the same point in their release cycles.[61] By the week of its release, opening weekend projections had reached upwards of $150\u00a0million.[62] A day before release, it became Fandango's top pre-selling animated film of all time, outselling the previous record-holder, *Finding Dory*.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
