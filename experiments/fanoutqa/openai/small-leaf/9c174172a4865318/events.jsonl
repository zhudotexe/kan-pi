In battles with the Portuguese and natives in 1644 the fort was destroyed.[6] Under captain Matthias Beck the Dutch West Indies Company built a new fortress by the banks of river Pajeú. Fort *Schoonenborch* (\"graceful stronghold\") officially opened on August 19, 1649. After the capitulation of Pernambuco in 1654, the Dutch handed over this fortress to the Portuguese, who renamed it *Fortaleza da Nossa Senhora de Assunção* (\"Fort of Our Lady of the Assumption\"), after which the city of Fortaleza takes its name.[7]\n\n\nFortaleza was officially founded as a village 1726, becoming the capital of Ceará state in 1799.[8]\n\n\n\n### Imperial period[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)In 2016 the Federal University of Ceará located in Fortaleza was classified as the 10th best university in Brazil, 1st in the North and Northeast regions and the best university in Ceará.\nIn 2010, the level of the education factor of the Strengthening Human Development Index was medium, despite its great advance, which went from 0.367 to 0.695 between 1991 and 2010.
