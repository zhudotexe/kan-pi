The park is inserted in the area of greater environmental sensitivity of the city, where it is possible to identify geoenvironmental formations such as coastal plain, fluvial plain and surface of the coastal trays. The Coc\u00f3 river mangrove is home to mollusks, crustaceans, fish, reptiles, birds and mammals. The park has a structure of visitation, with guides, ecological trails and equipment and events of environmental education and ecotourism.

Fort *Schoonenborch* (\"graceful stronghold\") officially opened on August 19, 1649. After the capitulation of Pernambuco in 1654, the Dutch handed over this fortress to the Portuguese, who renamed it *Fortaleza da Nossa Senhora de Assun\u00e7\u00e3o* (\"Fort of Our Lady of the Assumption\"), after which the city of Fortaleza takes its name.[7]\n\n\nFortaleza was officially founded as a village 1726, becoming the capital of Cear\u00e1 state in 1799.[8]\n\n\n\n### Imperial period[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)In 2016 the Federal University of Cear\u00e1 located in Fortaleza was classified as the 10th best university in Brazil, 1st in the North and Northeast regions and the best university in Cear\u00e1.\nIn 2010, the level of the education factor of the Strengthening Human Development Index was medium, despite its great advance, which went from 0.367 to 0.695 between 1991 and 2010.
