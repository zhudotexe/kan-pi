Fitzpatrick's longest stint was with the Buffalo Bills for four seasons, while his only two winning seasons were with the 2015 New York Jets and the 2020 Miami Dolphins. As a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2018, Fitzpatrick became the first NFL quarterback to throw for over 400 yards in three consecutive games. He holds the most career passing yards and passing touchdowns among NFL quarterbacks without a postseason appearance.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nWhile an economics student at Harvard University, Fitzpatrick had five starts for the Crimson during the 2001 and 2002 seasons, working as the backup for Neil Rose.[3] In 2002, Fitzpatrick recorded 1,155 passing yards with eight touchdowns and no interceptions to go along with 523 rushing yards and five touchdowns.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n105. **^** Laine, Jenna (November 6, 2017). \"Jameis Winston shut down for at least 2 weeks to rest injured shoulder\". *espn.com*.

          "content": "<document>\n<title>List of New York Jets head coaches</title>\n<content>\nThere have been 22 head coaches in the history of the New York Jets football franchise. The team began as the New York Titans in the American Football League in 1960, but was renamed the New York Jets three years later.[1] The Jets remained in the American Football League until the merger with the National Football League prior to the 1970 season. The current head coach of the Jets is Robert Saleh since January 14, 2021.\n\n\nSammy Baugh became the first head coach of the New York Titans in 1960, serving for two seasons before team owner Harry Wismer replaced him with Clyde \"Bulldog\" Turner.[2] In terms of tenure, Weeb Ewbank has coached more games (158) and more complete seasons (11) than any other head coach in franchise history. He led the Jets to the AFL championship in 1968 and the AFL-NFL championship in Super Bowl III. Walt Michaels led the team to the AFC championship game in 1982; he was also honored as the Pro Football Weekly NFL Coach of the Year and UPI AFC Coach of the Year in 1978. Coaches Baugh, Turner and Ewbank are all members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame; Baugh and Turner were inducted as players, while Ewbank was inducted as a coach/administrator.\n\n\nTwice in Jets history has there been an \"interim\" head coach. In 1975, Charley Winner was fired as head coach after leading the Jets to a 2\u20137 record.[3] The team offensive coordinator Ken Shipp was named the interim coach for the remainder of the season, during which he won only one of five games. Shipp was succeeded by Lou Holtz for the 1976 season.[4] Holtz resigned as Jets head coach with one game left in the 1976 season; Mike Holovak was named interim coach for the season finale against the Cincinnati Bengals.[4]\n\n\nBill Belichick was twice named head coach of the Jets but never coached a single game or practice in that capacity. In 1997, he was named head coach for six days before the deal to allow Bill Parcells to leave the New England Patriots for the Jets was brokered, and Belichick became defensive coordinator;[5] then, when Parcells stepped down after the 1999 season Belichick was named to replace him, but resigned the next day.[6]\n\n\nHerman Edwards is the only Jets head coach to lead the team to the playoffs more than twice; Rex Ryan is the only one with more than two postseason wins. Todd Bowles is the only one to coach the Jets for more than two seasons without making the playoffs.\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **#** | Number of coaches[N 1] |\n| **GC** | Games coached\n |\n| **W** | Wins\n |\n| **L** | Losses\n |\n| **T** | Ties\n |\n| **Win%** | Winning percentage |\n| 00\u2020\n | Elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a coach\n |\n| 00\u2021\n | Elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a player\n |\n| 00\\*\n | Spent entire NFL head coaching career with the Jets\n |\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| #\n | Image\n | Name\n | Term\n | Regular season\n | Playoffs\n | Awards\n | Reference\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GC\n | W\n | L\n | T\n | Win%[a] | GC\n | W\n | L\n |\n| **New York Titans** |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | Sammy Baugh\u2021\n | 1960\u20131961 | 28\n | 14\n | 14\n | 0\n | .500\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |  | [7] |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Bulldog Turner\u2021\n | 1962\\*\n | 14\n | 5\n | 9\n | 0\n | .357\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |  | [8] |\n| **New York Jets** |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | Weeb Ewbank\u2020\n | 1963\u20131973 | 154\n | 71\n | 77\n | 6\n | .481\n | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n |  | [9] |\n| 4\n |  | Charley Winner | 1974\u20131975 | 23\n | 9\n | 14\n | 0\n | .391\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |  | [10] |\n| 5\n |  | Ken Shipp\\*\n | 1975\\*[b] | 5\n | 1\n | 4\n | 0\n | .200\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |  | [11] |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | Lou Holtz\\*\n | 1976\\*[c] | 13\n | 3\n | 10\n | 0\n | .231\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |  | [12] |\n| 7\n |  | Mike Holovak | 1976[d] | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n | .000\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |  | [13] |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Walt Michaels\\*\n | 1977\u20131982\\*\n | 87\n | 39\n | 47\n | 1\n | .454\n | 4\n | 2\n | 2\n | Pro Football Weekly NFL Coach of the Year (1978)[14]UPI NFL Coach of the Year (1978)\n | [15] |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | Joe Walton\\*\n | 1983\u20131989\\*\n | 111\n | 53\n | 57\n | 1\n | .482\n | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n |  | [16] |\n| 10\n |  | Bruce Coslet | 1990\u20131993 | 64\n | 26\n | 38\n | 0\n | .406\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |  | [17] |\n| 11\n | ![](image) | Pete Carroll | 1994 | 16\n | 6\n | 10\n | 0\n | .375\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |  | [18] |\n| 12\n |  | Rich Kotite | 1995\u20131996 | 32\n | 4\n | 28\n | 0\n | .125\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |  | [19] |\n| 13\n | ![](image) | Bill Parcells\u2020\n | 1997\u20131999 | 48\n | 29\n | 19\n | 0\n | .604\n | 2\n | 1\n | 1\n |  | [20] |\n| 14\n | ![](image) | Al Groh\\*\n | 2000\\*\n | 16\n | 9\n | 7\n | 0\n | .563\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |  | [21] |\n| 15\n | ![](image) | Herman Edwards | 2001\u20132005 | 80\n | 39\n | 41\n | 0\n | .488\n | 5\n | 2\n | 3\n |  | [22] |\n| 16\n | ![](image) | Eric Mangini | 2006\u20132008 | 48\n | 23\n | 25\n | 0\n | .479\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |  | [23] |\n| 17\n | ![](image) | Rex Ryan | 2009\u20132014 | 96\n | 46\n | 50\n | 0\n | .479\n | 6\n | 4\n | 2\n |  | [24] |\n| 18\n |  | Todd Bowles | 2015\u20132018 | 64\n | 24\n | 40\n | 0\n | .375\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |  | [25] |\n| 19\n | ![](image) | Adam Gase | 2019\u20132020 | 32\n | 9\n | 23\n | 0\n | .281\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |  | [26] |\n| 20\n | ![](image) | Robert Saleh\\*\n | 2021\u2013present\\*\n | 34\n | 12\n | 24\n | 0\n | .333\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |  | [27] |\n\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** A running total of the number of Jets head coaches.

But St. Louis faltered to 3-13 in 2007 and after an 0-4 start in 2008, Linehan was fired. Defensive coordinator Jim Haslett was elevated to interim head coach, having previously been head coach with the New Orleans Saints. Though he began his brief tenure with two straight wins, the Rams under Haslett ended the 2008 season with 10 straight losses, and Haslett was not considered as a candidate for the permanent head coaching position. The Rams then hired Steve Spagnuolo as head coach after Spagnuolo's successful stretch running the New York Giants defense. But as dismal as St. Louis was in 2008, when the Rams went 2-14, it was even worse in 2009 as St. Louis went 1-15, with only a 17-10 win at Detroit staving off a winless season. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** \"Mike Martz\". *Pro Football Reference*.

After struggling to win, Brooks was fired after just two seasons and replaced by Dick Vermeil. The former Philadelphia Eagles head coach, Vermeil had not coached on any level since retiring in 1982. But after two double-digit loss seasons, Vermeil shepherded the Rams to remarkable turnaround in 1999. Led by the arrival of running back Marshall Faulk and the emergence of quarterback Kurt Warner, the St. Louis Rams took the NFL by storm and went on to win Super Bowl XXXIV 23-16 over the Tennessee Titans. Vermeil then retired and was succeeded by his offensive coordinator Mike Martz, who would ultimately lead the Rams back to the Super Bowl. But after being upset 20-17 by the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI and then losing to the Carolina Panthers in double overtime during the 2003 NFC Divisional Playoff, Martz began to fall out of favor with Rams management. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** \"Jeff Fisher Record, Statistics, and Category Ranks\". *Pro Football Reference*.

Damon Wetzel became the first head coach of the Cleveland Rams in 1936. He served for one season before he was replaced by Hugo Bezdek in 1937 as the Rams became a National Football League franchise. But after losing 13 of 14 games, Bezdek was dismissed and replaced by Art Lewis three games into the 1938 season. Dutch Clark, who was later one of the charter inductees into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, became head coach of the Rams and coached the team for four seasons until the franchise suspended operations for the 1943 season. When the Rams resumed play in 1944, Aldo \"Buff\" Donelli became head coach and was 4-4 in his only season. In 1945, Adam Walsh became head coach and proceeded to lead the Cleveland Rams to a 9-1 record and the franchise's first NFL championship. Walsh was named the league's Coach of the Year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Rams interviewed a variety of candidates, but surprised many observers by hiring then 30-year-old Sean McVay as head coach on January 12, 2017. With a work ethic and reservoir of knowledge that belied his age, McVay refashioned the team in his own image. The youngest head coach in modern league history hired longtime NFL coach Wade Phillips as defensive coordinator and retained Fassel as special teams coordinator. The results were overwhelmingly positive as McVay's new-look Rams went 11-5 in 2017 and clinched their first NFC West title since 2003, and McVay was named NFL Coach of the Year. In 2018, the Rams improved to 13-3, tying for the second-most regular season wins in team history, and qualified to play in Super Bowl LIII against the New England Patriots.\n\n\nSid Gillman, George Allen and Dick Vermeil have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as coaches. To date, Vermeil and Sean McVay are the only coach to win a Super Bowl championship in franchise history.\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlthough he was successful as head coach, an internal dispute between Stydahar and assistant coach Hamp Pool spilled over into the public and Stydahar resigned one game into the 1952 season. Pool was elevated to head coach and led the Rams to their fourth straight postseason appearance in 1953, this time losing to the Detroit Lions in a playoff. Pool stayed as head coach for two more seasons before giving way to Sid Gillman, who led the Rams to the 1955 NFL Championship game where they again lost to Cleveland. Although his innovative offensive style would influence pro football for decades to come, Gillman never equaled the success of his first season, and left after five seasons to coach the American Football League's Los Angeles Chargers. The Rams continued without success under head coaches Bob Waterfield and Harland Svare.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNew Rams owner Stan Kroenke made his first hire with former Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans head coach Jeff Fisher taking over. The Rams did show overall improvement during a 7-8-1 season. But it was the best that Fisher would be able to do, as the Rams went 7-9, 6-10, and 7-9 in their final seasons in St. Louis. Following the end of the 2015 season, the Rams were approved to return to Los Angeles, ending the NFL's 21-year absence from the market. Fisher, who had guided the Oilers/Titans franchise in its relocation from Houston to Memphis and ultimately to Nashville, was retained and shepherded the Rams through the turmoil of the move. And while the newly-rebranded Los Angeles Rams began the 2016 season 3-1, the team would win only one of its remaining 12 games. Though he had acquired strong talent in successive drafts with Aaron Donald in 2014 and Todd Gurley in 2015 Fisher was unable to put together a consistently winning combination on the field. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1966, George Allen was hired as head coach and instantly turned around the Rams' on-field fortunes. In his five seasons, Allen never had a losing record and led the Rams to division titles in 1967 and 1969. But the Rams fell both times to the eventual NFL champion, and that combined with ongoing friction between himself and owner Dan Reeves, made Allen's situation unstable. Allen was originally fired in 1968, but after players interceded on his behalf, Reeves retained him for two more seasons. After failing to make the playoffs in 1970, Allen was released once his contract expired, and he was replaced by former UCLA coach Tommy Prothro, who led the Rams for two unsuccessful seasons.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAgain, the Rams had the opportunity to go with a well-regarded young offensive mind, having interviewed then-San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Mike Holmgren. But as her late husband had once done, Georgia Frontiere opted to play it safe by bringing back Chuck Knox, who had just weeks earlier stepped down from coaching the Seattle Seahawks. But Knox was unable to recreate the magic of his earlier tenure with the Rams, as Los Angeles finished 6-10 in 1992 and got progressively worse each following season. Additionally, Frontiere openly flirted with a possible franchise move to St. Louis, and Knox was fired following the Rams' 4-12 finish in 1994.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1999 AP NFL Coach of the Year[17]1999 Sporting News NFL Coach of the Year[12]1999 Pro Football Weekly NFL Coach of the Year[21]1999 Maxwell Football Club NFL Coach of the Year[27]\n | [28] |\n| 21\n |  | Mike Martz\\*\n | 2000\u20132005\\* [g] | 85 | 53 | 32 | 0 | .624\n | 7 | 3 | 4 | .429\n |  | [29] |\n| 22\n |  | Joe Vitt | 2005 | 11 | 4 | 7 | 0 | .364\n | \u2014 |  |  |  |  | [30] |\n| 23\n | ![](image) | Scott Linehan\\*\n | 2006\u20132008\\*\n | 36 | 11 | 25 | 0 | .306\n | \u2014 |  |  |  |  | [31] |\n| 24\n | ![](image) | Jim Haslett | 2008 | 12 | 2 | 10 | 0 | .167\n | \u2014 |  |  |  |  | [32] |\n| 25\n | ![](image) | Steve Spagnuolo | 2009\u20132011 | 48 | 10 | 38 | 0 | .208\n | \u2014 |  |  |  |  | [33][34] |\n| 26\n | ![](image) | Jeff Fisher | 2012\u20132015 | 64 | 27 | 36 | 1 | .430\n | \u2014 |  |  |  |  | [35][36] |\n| **Los Angeles Rams** |\n| \u2013\n | ![](image) | Jeff Fisher[h] | 2016 | 13 | 4 | 9 | 0 | .308\n | \u2014 |  |  |  |  | [37] |\n| 27\n |  | John Fassel\\*\n | 2016\\* [i] | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0 | .000\n | \u2014 |  |  |  |  | [38] |\n| 28\n | ![](image) | Sean McVay\\*\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite the title, the Rams' faltering financial fortunes in Cleveland sparked a move to Los Angeles by owner Dan Reeves. Walsh remained head coach, but left after the Rams finished 6-4-1 in their inaugural season on the west coast. Walsh was succeeded by Bob Snyder, who went 6-6 in his only season in 1947. Clark Shaughnessy took over for the next two seasons and led the Rams to the 1949 NFL Championship game (losing to the Philadelphia Eagles), but he was dismissed for reportedly for creating \"internal friction\" within the club. Line coach Joe Stydahar was elevated to head coach and guided the Rams back to the NFL championship game in 1950, where they again lost, this time to the Cleveland Browns 30-28. A year later, the teams would rematch, but this time the Rams prevailed 24-17 over the Browns to win the 1951 NFL Championship. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFive games into the 2005 season, Martz took a leave of absence to treat a bacterial infection in his heart. For the remainder of the season, Martz was replaced on an interim basis by Joe Vitt. The Rams finished 6-10 overall and both Martz and Vitt were fired following the season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFortunes improved in 2010 thanks to a strong season from rookie quarterback Sam Bradford, as the Rams went 7-9 and were in the playoff hunt until the season's final week, when Seattle defeated them 16-6 to win the NFC West. But the Rams reverted to their losing form in 2011 with a 2-14 record. After losing their final seven games, Spagnuolo was fired along with general manager Billy Devaney.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLos Angeles Rams\n |\n| --- |\n| * Founded in 1936\n* Played in **Cleveland, Ohio** (1936\u20131945) and **St. Louis, Missouri** (1995\u20132015)\n* Based in **Inglewood, California**\n* Headquartered in **Agoura Hills, California**\n |\n| Franchise | * Franchise\n* History\n\t+ in Cleveland\n\t+ in St. Louis\n\t+ NFL in Los Angeles\n* Seasons\n* Players\n* Coaches\n* First-round draft picks\n* Starting quarterbacks\n* Statistics\n* Broadcasters\n* Awards\n |\n| Stadiums | * Cleveland Stadium\n* League Park\n* Shaw Stadium\n* Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum\n* Anaheim Stadium\n* Busch Memorial Stadium\n* The Dome at America's Center\n* **SoFi Stadium**\n |\n| Culture | * Rampage\n* Cheerleaders\n* *Triple Threat*\n* *Crazylegs*\n* *Heaven Can Wait*\n* Melonheads\n* Mob Squad (fans)\n* Nelly\n* John Ramsey\n* \"Win\"\n* Red Hot Chili Peppers\n* Big A Sign\n* *American Underdog*\n |\n| Lore | * Bull Elephant backfield\n* Fearsome Foursome\n* Jerome Bettis trade\n* The Greatest Show on Turf\n* The Tackle\n* Mob Squad (2015-19)\n* Sean McVay effect\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1967 AP NFL Coach of the Year[17]1967 Sporting News NFL Coach of the Year[12]1967 UPI NFL Coach of the Year[18]\n | [19] |\n| 15\n | ![](image) | Tommy Prothro | 1971\u20131972 | 28 | 14 | 12 | 2 | .536\n | \u2014 |  |  |  |  | [20] |\n| 16\n |  | Chuck Knox | 1973\u20131977 | 70 | 54 | 15 | 1 | .779\n | 8 | 3 | 5 | .375\n | List\n\n* 1973 AP NFL Coach of the Year[17]1973 Sporting News NFL Coach of the Year[12]1973 Pro Football Weekly NFL Coach of the Year[21]1973 UPI NFC Coach of the Year[22]\n | [23] |\n| 17\n |  | Ray Malavasi | 1978\u20131982 | 73 | 40 | 33 | 0 | .548\n | 6 | 3 | 3 | .500\n |  | [24] |\n| 18\n |  | John Robinson\\*\n | 1983\u20131991\\*\n | 143 | 75 | 68 | 0 | .524\n | 10 | 4 | 6 | .400\n |  | [25] |\n| \u2013\n |  | Chuck Knox [f] | 1992\u20131994 | 48 | 15 | 33 | 0 | .313\n | \u2014 |  |  |  |  | [23] |\n| **St. Louis Rams** |\n| 19\n |  | Rich Brooks\\*\n | 1995\u20131996\\*\n | 32 | 13 | 19 | 0 | .406\n | \u2014 |  |  |  |  | [26] |\n| 20\n | ![](image) | Dick Vermeil \u2020\n | 1997\u20131999 | 48 | 22 | 26 | 0 | .458\n | 3 | 3 | 0 | 1.000\n | List\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRams owner Georgia Frontiere, who had taken over the team following the death of her husband Carroll Rosenbloom in 1979, hired former USC head coach John Robinson for the 1983 season. Bringing a host of former Trojan assistants with him, Robinson installed his trademark running game that worked perfectly with the Rams' powerful offensive line and explosive running back Eric Dickerson. Robinson led the Rams to playoff appearances in six of the next seven seasons, including an NFC West title in 1985 as well as reaching the NFC Championship Games in 1985 and 1989. But back-to-back losing seasons in 1990 and 1991 doomed Robinson, who stepped down after a 3-13 campaign. Robinson ended his NFL career with the most wins (79) in Rams franchise history.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy this time, Dan Reeves had died, and the franchise was then sold to Robert Irsay, who then immediately traded the franchise to Carroll Rosenbloom in exchange for the Baltimore Colts. Following the 1972 season, Rosenbloom dismissed Prothro and brought in as his replacement Chuck Knox. Installing his trademark \"Ground Chuck\" offense, Knox led the Rams to a 12-2 record and their first NFC West title, and was named NFL Coach of the Year for 1973. Los Angeles would repeat as division champions four more times under Knox, while also reaching the NFC Championship Game three consecutive years from 1974 through 1976. But the Rams were frustrated each time in their attempt to reach the Super Bowl, and after an upset loss to Minnesota in a 1977 NFC Divisional Playoff, Knox left Los Angeles to take the head coaching job with the Buffalo Bills.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"St. Louis Rams History: Chronology\".

There have been ten head coaches for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL). A professional American football team based in Cincinnati, Ohio, the Bengals are a member of the North Division of the American Football Conference (AFC). The Bengals franchise was founded in 1968 as a member of the Western Division of the American Football League (AFL),[1] before merging with the NFL in 1970.[1]\n\n\nThe current head coach is Zac Taylor, who was hired after the 2018 season. Taylor replaced Marvin Lewis, who remains the Bengals all-time leader in seasons coached, games coached, wins, and playoff games coached. Three coaches have won a conference championship with the team: Forrest Gregg in 1981, Sam Wyche in 1988 and Taylor in 2021.[2] Gregg leads all coaches in winning percentage with .561.[3] Dick LeBeau had the lowest winning percentage, with .267.[4] Of the nine Bengals head coaches, three have been elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Paul Brown, Forrest Gregg, and Dick LeBeau (although only Brown was inducted as a coach, the other two were inducted as players).[5] Two former players have been head coach for the Bengals: Sam Wyche and Bruce Coslet.\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **#** | Number of coaches[N 1] |\n| **Yrs** | Years coached\n |\n| **First** | First season coached\n |\n| **Last** | Last season coached\n |\n| **GC** | Games Coached\n |\n| **W** | Wins\n |\n| **L** | Loses\n |\n| **T** | Ties\n |\n| **Win%** | Win\u00a0\u2013 Loss percentage\n |\n| 00\u2020\n | Elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a coach\n |\n| 00\u2021\n | Elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a player\n |\n| 00\\*\n | Spent entire NFL head coaching career with the Bengals\n |\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\n*Note: Statistics are accurate through the end of the 2021 NFL season.*\n\n\n| #\n | Image\n | Name\n | Term[N 2] | Regular season\n | Playoffs\n | Accomplishments\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Yrs\n | First\n | Last\n | GC\n | W\n | L\n | T\n | Win%\n | GC\n | W\n | L\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | Paul Brown\u2020 | 8\n | 1968 | 1975 | 112\n | 55\n | 56\n | 1\n | .495\n | 3\n | 0\n | 3\n | **Inducted Pro Football Hall of Fame (1967)**2 AFC Central Championships (1970, 1973)3 Playoff Berths 2 UPI NFL Coach of the Year Awards (1969, 1970)  | [6] |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Bill Johnson\\*\n | 3\n | 1976 | 1978[N 3] | 33\n | 18\n | 15\n | 0\n | .545\n | \u2014\n |  | [7] |\n| 3\n |  | Homer Rice | 3\n | 1978[N 3] | 1979 | 27\n | 8\n | 19\n | 0\n | .296\n | \u2014\n |  | [8] |\n| 4\n |  | Forrest Gregg\u2021 | 4\n | 1980 | 1983 | 57\n | 32\n | 25\n | 0\n | .561\n | 4\n | 2\n | 2\n | 1 AFC Championship (1981)1 AFC Central Championship (1981)2 Playoff Berths 1 UPI NFL Coach of the Year Award (1981)  | [9] |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | Sam Wyche | 8\n | 1984 | 1991 | 121\n | 61\n | 66\n | 0\n | .480\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 1 AFC Championship (1988)2 AFC Central Championships (1988, 1990)2 Playoff Berths | [10] |\n| 6\n |  | Dave Shula\\*\n | 5\n | 1992 | 1996[N 4] | 71\n | 19\n | 52\n | 0\n | .268\n | \u2014\n |  | [11] |\n| 7\n |  | Bruce Coslet | 5\n | 1996[N 4] | 2000[N 5] | 60\n | 21\n | 39\n | 0\n | .350\n | \u2014\n |  | [12] |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Dick LeBeau\u2021 | 3\n | 2000[N 5] | 2002 | 45\n | 12\n | 33\n | 0\n | .267\n | \u2014\n |  | [13] |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | Marvin Lewis\\*\n | 16\n | 2003 | 2018 | 256\n | 131\n | 122\n | 3\n | .518\n | 7\n | 0\n | 7\n | 4 AFC North Championships (2005, 2009, 2013, 2015)7 Playoff Berths  1 AP NFL Coach of the Year Award (2009)  | [14] |\n| 10\n | ![](image) | Zac Taylor\\*\n | 3\n | 2019 | present | 65\n | 28\n | 36\n | 1\n | .438\n | 4\n | 4\n | 1\n | 1 AFC Championship (2021) 2 AFC North Championships (2021, 2022)2 Playoff Berths | [15] |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** A running total of the number of coaches of the Bengals.

First, in 1968, head coach Joe Collier was fired two games into the season and replaced by Bills personnel director Harvey Johnson.[4] Johnson did not serve as head coach the following season. Then, five games into the 1976 season, Saban unexpectedly resigned as head coach. He was replaced by Ringo, the team's offensive line coach.[5] Ringo returned to coach the team again in the 1977 season. In October 1985, Kay Stephenson was fired and replaced by assistant head coach Hank Bullough.[5] Just over a year later, Bullough was himself fired and replaced by Marv Levy, who had previously served as coach of the Kansas City Chiefs.[6] Levy would then serve as Bills head coach for the next 12 seasons. In 2016, Anthony Lynn replaced Rex Ryan for the final game of the season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere have been 19\u00a0head coaches for the Bills franchise. Buster Ramsey became the first head coach of the Buffalo Bills in 1960, serving for two seasons before being fired by Bills owner Ralph Wilson after the 1961 season.[2] In terms of tenure, Marv Levy has coached more games (182) and seasons (12) than any other coach in franchise history. He coached the Bills to four straight AFC Championships from 1990 to 1993, but failed to lead the team to a victory in the Super Bowl. One of Levy's predecessors, Lou Saban, who coached the team on two occasions, led the team to the victories in the AFL championship in 1964 and 1965. Three Bills coaches\u2014Saban, Levy and Chuck Knox\u2014have been named coach of the year by at least one major news organization.[3] Levy and Jim Ringo are the only Bills coaches to have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Bills experienced less success under Mularkey during 2005, and Mularkey resigned as head coach at the completion of the 2005 season.[9] The Bills then named Dick Jauron as their head coach for the 2006 season.[8] Jauron was the first coach since Phillips' dismissal with prior head coaching experience, having previously served as head coach of the Chicago Bears and interim head coach of the Detroit Lions. Jauron coached the Bills to three consecutive 7\u20139 seasons before being fired on November 17, 2009, nine games into the 2009 season. Defensive Coordinator Perry Fewell was named as the interim head coach, going 3-4 to finish out the season before all of the Bills coaching staff was fired on January 4, 2010. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) **Commons**\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBuffalo Bills head coaches\n |\n| --- |\n| * Buster Ramsey (1960\u20131961)\n* Lou Saban (1962\u20131965)\n* Joe Collier (1966\u20131968)\n* Harvey Johnson # (1968)\n* John Rauch (1969\u20131970)\n* Harvey Johnson (1971)\n* Lou Saban (1972\u20131976)\n* Jim Ringo (1976\u20131977)\n* Chuck Knox (1978\u20131982)\n* Kay Stephenson (1983\u20131985)\n* Hank Bullough (1985\u20131986)\n* Marv Levy (1986\u20131997)\n* Wade Phillips (1998\u20132000)\n* Gregg Williams (2001\u20132003)\n* Mike Mularkey (2004\u20132005)\n* Dick Jauron (2006\u20132009)\n* Perry Fewell # (2009)\n* Chan Gailey (2010\u20132012)\n* Doug Marrone (2013\u20132014)\n* Rex Ryan (2015\u20132016)\n* Anthony Lynn # (2016)\n* Sean McDermott (2017\u2013present)\n\n\n*# denotes interim head coach*\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNFL head coaches\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing Levy's retirement, the Bills experienced limited success under a series of successive head coaches. Wade Phillips, the Bills defensive coordinator for the last three years under Levy, took over head coaching duties for the 1998 season. Phillips served as head coach for three seasons, making the playoffs in his first two (He was the last coach to lead the Bills to the playoffs until Sean McDermott became coach in 2017).[7] After Phillips' departure following the 2000 season, Gregg Williams was named head coach.[8] Williams served as coach for three seasons. At the end of the 2003 season, Williams' contract was not renewed.[9] Mike Mularkey was named as the new head coach for the 2004 season,[8] leading the Bills to their first winning season since 1999. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **A** A running total of the number of coaches of the Bills.

They are a member of the South division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The Tennessee Titans have had 18\u00a0head coaches in its franchise history. As the Houston Oilers based in Houston, Texas, the team began playing in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL). The Oilers won two AFL championships before joining the NFL as part of the AFL-NFL merger. The team relocated to Tennessee in 1997 and played in Memphis for one season before moving to Nashville. For two seasons, the team was known as the Tennessee Oilers before changing its name to the Titans in 1999.[1]\n\n\nHead coach Jeff Fisher led the Titans to their only Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XXXIV following the 1999 season. He continued his success with playoff appearances in 2000, 2002, and 2003. His coaching career began to decline and, from 2004\u20132010, his only playoff appearances included 2007 and 2008. In January 2011, it was announced that Fisher and the Titans had mutually parted ways. Fisher's tenure at head coach from 1994\u20132010 included six playoff appearances, one AFC Championship appearance, and one Super Bowl appearance. \n\n\nFollowing Fisher, the Titans promoted former player and longtime offensive line coach Mike Munchak to head coach. He missed the playoffs from 2011\u20132013 before being fired in January 2014. Ken Whisenhunt became head coach shortly after, and tied a franchise worst 2\u201314 record in 2014. Mike Mularkey, who was originally hired as tight ends coach in 2014 and promoted to assistant head coach in 2015, replaced Whisenhunt on an interim basis after a 1\u20136 start in 2015. Mularkey was retained as head coach and led the Titans to two 9\u20137 seasons, including a playoff appearance in 2017. \n\n\nMularkey and the Titans agreed to part ways in January 2018. Former NFL player and coach, Mike Vrabel, was hired as head coach soon after. In his first four seasons, Vrabel led the Titans to an AFC Championship appearance in 2019, back-to-back AFC South division titles in 2020 and 2021, and earned the #1 seed for the AFC in the 2021\u201322 NFL playoffs.

          "content": "<document>\n<title>List of Houston Texans head coaches</title>\n<content>\n![](image)Gary Kubiak led the Texans to their 1st division championship and 1st playoff win.\nThere have been six head coaches of the Houston Texans, a professional American football team based in Houston, Texas, United States. The Texans play in the South Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL).\n\n\nIn 2002, the Texans entered the NFL as an expansion team, with Dom Capers (2002\u201305) as the team's first head coach. Capers was selected, in part, due to his success in having led the expansion Carolina Panthers to the playoffs in just their second season in the league.\n\n\nAfter three straight seasons of consistent improvement, the Texans took a major step backward in 2005 with a 2\u201314 finish. At the end of the season, Capers was fired and replaced with Gary Kubiak (2006\u20132013), then the offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos. Kubiak, a Houston native and alumnus of nearby Texas A&M, would eventually become the longest-tenured head coach in franchise history, coaching 125 games and posting a 61\u201364 record.\n\n\nKubiak earned several distinctions as head coach, having led the Texans to their first non-losing season (2007), their first winning season (2009), and their first division title, playoff appearance, and playoff win (2011). In both 2011 and 2012, the Texans won the AFC South and the first game of the playoffs but lost the divisional game the following week.\n\n\nIn 2013, the Texans started the season 2\u20130, but then lost their next 11 games. Kubiak was fired mid-season, on December 6, 2013[1] and was replaced on an interim basis by defensive coordinator Wade Phillips (2013, 3 games).\n\n\nDuring the 2013 off-season, Bill O'Brien (2014\u20132020) was hired to be the Texans' next head coach.[2] O'Brien had previously served as head coach at Penn State and as offensive coordinator under Bill Belichick with the New England Patriots.\n\n\nIn the 2020 season, the Texans started 0-4, and O'Brien was fired and replaced by interim head coach Romeo Crennel during the regular season on October 5, 2020[3]\n\n\nDuring the 2020 offseason, David Culley was hired as the Texans' next head coach.[4] Culley had previously served as an assistant head coach and wide receivers coach with multiple NFL franchises, most recently the Baltimore Ravens. However, he was fired after just one season, with the team posting a 4\u201313 record during his brief tenure.[5][6]\n\n\nDuring the 2021 offseason, Lovie Smith was hired as the Texans' next head coach.[7] Smith had previously served as associate head coach and defensive coordinator during the 2021 season. Smith was previously the head coach of the Chicago Bears and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, as well as the Illinois Fighting Illini. Smith, however, was fired after posting a 3\u201313\u20131 record, becoming the second-straight Texans head coach to be fired after one season.[8]\n\n\nDuring the 2022 offseason, DeMeco Ryans was hired as the Texans' next head coach;[9] Ryans served as defensive coordinator with the San Francisco 49ers. Ryans also was drafted in 2006 by the Texans where he played for six seasons.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **#** | Number of coaches[N 1] |\n| **Yrs** | Years coached\n |\n| **First** | First season coached\n |\n| **Last** | Last season coached\n |\n| **GC** | Games Coached\n |\n| **W** | Wins\n |\n| **L** | Loses\n |\n| **T** | Ties\n |\n| **Win%** | Win\u00a0\u2013 Loss percentage\n |\n| 00\\*\n | Spent entire NFL head coaching career with the Texans\n |\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\n*Note: Statistics are accurate through the end of the 2022 NFL season.*\n\n\n| #\n | Image\n | Name\n | Term[N 2] | Regular season\n | Playoffs\n | Accomplishments\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First\n | Last\n | GC\n | W\n | L\n | T\n | Win%\n | GC\n | W\n | L\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | Dom Capers | 2002 | 2005 | 64\n | 18\n | 46\n | 0\n | .281\n | \u2014\n |  | [10] |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Gary Kubiak | 2006 | 2013[N 3] | 125\n | 61\n | 64\n | 0\n | .488\n | 4\n | 2\n | 2\n | 2 AFC South Championships (2011, 2012)2 Playoff Berths | [11] |\n| \u2013\n | ![](image) | Wade Phillips | 2013[N 3] | 3\n | 0\n | 3\n | 0\n | .000\n | \u2014\n |  | [12] |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | Bill O'Brien\\*\n | 2014 | 2020[N 4] | 100\n | 52\n | 48\n | 0\n | .520\n | 6\n | 2\n | 4\n | 4 AFC South Championships (2015, 2016, 2018, 2019) 4 Playoff Berths | [13] |\n| \u2013\n | ![](image) | Romeo Crennel | 2020[N 4] | 12\n | 4\n | 8\n | 0\n | .333\n | \u2014\n |  | [14] |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | David Culley\\*\n | 2021 | 17\n | 4\n | 13\n | 0\n | .235\n | \u2014\n |  | [15] |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | Lovie Smith | 2022 | 17\n | 3\n | 13\n | 1\n | .206\n | \u2014\n |  | [16] |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | DeMeco Ryans\\*\n | 2023 | present\n |  |  |  |  | \u2013\n | \u2014\n |  | [17] |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** A running total of the number of coaches of the Texans.

He holds NFL record for wins.\n![](image)Tony Sparano set NFL record for best 1 season turnaround.\nThe Miami Dolphins are a professional American football franchise based in Miami Gardens, Florida. They are members of the East Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The Dolphins began play in 1966 as an expansion team in the American Football League (AFL), and joined the NFL as part of the AFL\u2013NFL merger. The team has played their home games at Hard Rock Stadium, originally known as Joe Robbie Stadium, Pro Player Stadium, Dolphins Stadium, Dolphin Stadium, Landshark Stadium, and Sun Life Stadium, since 1987.[1] The Dolphins are currently owned by Stephen M. Ross.[2]\n\n\nThere have been thirteen head coaches for the Dolphins franchise. The team's first head coach was George Wilson, who coached for four complete seasons.[3] Don Shula, who coached the Dolphins for 26 consecutive seasons, is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular-season games coached (392), the most regular-season game wins (257), the most playoff games coached (31), and the most playoff-game wins (17). Shula is also the only Dolphins head coach to win a Super Bowl with the team, winning two. He was named the United Press International (UPI) NFL Coach of the Year twice during his tenure with the Dolphins.[4] Mike McDaniel is the current head coach of the Dolphins since his hiring on February 6, 2022.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **#** | Number of coaches[N 1] |\n| **Yrs** | Years coached\n |\n| **First** | First season coached\n |\n| **Last** | Last season coached\n |\n| **GC** | Games Coached\n |\n| **W** | Wins\n |\n| **L** | Loses\n |\n| **T** | Ties\n |\n| **Win%** | Win\u00a0\u2013 Loss percentage\n |\n| 00\u2020\n | Elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a coach\n |\n| 00\\*\n | Spent entire NFL head coaching career with the Dolphins\n |\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\n*Note: Statistics are accurate through the end of the 2022 NFL season.*\n\n\n| #\n | Image\n | Name\n | Term[N 2] | Regular season\n | Playoffs\n | Accomplishments\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Yrs\n | First\n | Last\n | GC\n | W\n | L\n | T\n | Win%\n | GC\n | W\n | L\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | George Wilson | 4\n | 1966 | 1969 | 56\n | 15\n | 39\n | 2\n | .286\n | \u2014\n |  | [3] |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Don Shula \u2020 | 26\n | 1970 | 1995 | 392\n | 257\n | 133\n | 2\n | .658\n | 31\n | 17\n | 14\n | **Inducted Pro Football Hall of Fame (1997)**2 Super Bowl championships (VII, VIII)5 AFC championships (1971, 1972, 1973, 1982, 1984)11 AFC East Division Champion (1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1991, 1994)19 Playoff Berths2 UPI NFL Coach of the Year (1970, 1972) | [4][6] |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | Jimmy Johnson \u2020 | 4\n | 1996 | 1999 | 64\n | 36\n | 28\n | 0\n | .563\n | 5\n | 2\n | 3\n | **Inducted Pro Football Hall of Fame (2020)**3 Playoff Berths | [7] |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | Dave Wannstedt | 5\n | 2000 | 2004[N 3] | 73\n | 42\n | 31\n | 0\n | .575\n | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1 AFC East Division Champion (2000) 2 Playoff Berths | [8] |\n| 5\n |  | Jim Bates\\*\n | 1\n | 2004[N 3] | 7\n | 3\n | 4\n | 0\n | .429\n | \u2014\n |  | [9] |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | Nick Saban\\*\n | 2\n | 2005 | 2006 | 32\n | 15\n | 17\n | 0\n | .469\n | \u2014\n |  | [10] |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | Cam Cameron\\*\n | 1\n | 2007 | 16\n | 1\n | 15\n | 0\n | .063\n | \u2014\n |  | [11] |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Tony Sparano | 4\n | 2008 | 2011[N 4] | 61\n | 29\n | 32\n | 0\n | .475\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1 AFC East Division Champion (2008) 1 Playoff Berth | [12] |\n| 9\n |  | Todd Bowles | 1\n | 2011[N 4] | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | .667\n | \u2014\n |  | [13] |\n| 10\n |  | Joe Philbin | 4\n | 2012 | 2015[N 5] | 52\n | 24\n | 28\n | 0\n | .462\n | \u2014\n |  | [14] |\n| 11\n | ![](image) | Dan Campbell | 1\n | 2015[N 5] | 12\n | 5\n | 7\n | 0\n | .417\n | \u2014\n |  | [15] |\n| 12\n | ![](image) | Adam Gase | 3\n | 2016 | 2018 | 48\n | 23\n | 25\n | 0\n | .479\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1 Playoff Berth | [16] |\n| 13\n |  | Brian Flores\\*\n | 3\n | 2019 | 2021 | 49\n | 24\n | 25\n | 0\n | .490\n | \u2014\n |  | [17] |\n| 14\n | ![](image) | Mike McDaniel\\*\n | 1\n | 2022\u2013present\n | 17\n | 9\n | 8\n | 0\n | .529\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1 Playoff Berth | [18] |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** A running total of the number of coaches of the Dolphins.
