Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2 billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n† *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFilms generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men – Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n71. **^** Everson, William K. (1998) [First published 1978]. *American silent film*. Da Capo Press. p. 374. ISBN 978-0-306-80876-0. Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Established\n | Title\n | Record-setting gross\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915[64] | *The Birth of a Nation* | $5,200,000R | [# 85] |\n| *1940* | $15,000,000R ‡ | [# 309] |\n| 1940[32] | *Gone with the Wind* | $32,000,000R | [# 135] |\n| *1963* | $67,000,000R ‡ | [# 310] |\n| 1966[64] | *The Sound of Music* | $114,600,000R | [# 210] |\n| 1971[64] | *Gone with the Wind* | $116,000,000R ‡ | [# 311] |\n| 1972[64] | *The Godfather* | $127,600,000–142,000,000R | [# 236][# 312] |\n| 1976[87][88] | *Jaws* | $193,700,000R | [# 251] |\n| 1978[89][90] | *Star Wars* | $410,000,000/$268,500,000R | [# 313][# 236] |\n| *1982* | $530,000,000 ‡ | [# 257] |\n| 1983[91] | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $619,000,000–664,000,000\n | [# 257][# 270] |\n| *1993* | $701,000,000 ‡ | [# 314] |\n| 1993[64] | *Jurassic Park* | $912,667,947\n | [# 73] |\n| 1998[92] | *Titanic* | $1,843,373,318\n | [# 7] |\n| 2010[93][94] | *Avatar* | $2,743,577,587\n | [# 1] |\n| $2,788,416,135 ‡ |\n| 2019[95][96] | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n63. **^** Hall & Neale 2010, p. 145. \"The commercial success of the five Cinerama travelogues, which earned an aggregate worldwide box-office gross of $120 million by 1962 (including $82 million in the United States and Canada), nevertheless demonstrated to the mainstream industry the market value of special screen formats.\"\n64. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Dirks, Tim. \"Top Films of All-Time: Part 1 – Box-Office Blockbusters\".

The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the visual effects and technical achievements but criticized the plot and lengthy runtime.[10] It was a major box office success, breaking multiple records, and grossing over $2.320 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2022, the highest-grossing film since the COVID-19 pandemic, and the third-highest-grossing film of all time. The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named *The Way of Water* one of the top-ten films of 2022. Among its many accolades, the film was nominated for four awards at the 95th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won for Best Visual Effects. Three further sequels are in production, with the next film set to be released in December 2025.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2022 American sci-fi fantasy film\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Avatar: The Way of Water |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Theatrical release poster\n |\n| Directed by | James Cameron |\n| Screenplay by | * James Cameron\n* Rick JaffaAmanda Silver\n |\n| Story by | * James Cameron\n* Rick Jaffa\n* Amanda Silver\n* Josh Friedman\n* Shane Salerno\n |\n| Produced by | * James Cameron\n* Jon Landau\n |\n| Starring | * Sam Worthington\n* Zoe Saldaña\n* Sigourney Weaver\n* Stephen Lang\n* Kate Winslet\n |\n| Cinematography | Russell Carpenter |\n| Edited by | * Stephen Rivkin\n* David Brenner\n* John Refoua\n* James Cameron\n |\n| Music by | Simon Franglen |\n| Productioncompanies\n | * TSG Entertainment II\n* Lightstorm Entertainment\n |\n| Distributed by | 20th Century Studios |\n| Release dates\n | * December 6, 2022 (2022-12-06) (Odeon Luxe Leicester Square)\n* December 16, 2022 (2022-12-16) (United States)\n |\n| Running time\n | 192 minutes[1] |\n| Country | United States |\n| Language | English |\n| Budget | $350–460 million[2][3] |\n| Box office | $2.32 billion[4][5] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n222. **^** Hogg, Ryan (December 17, 2022). \"'Avatar: The Way of Water' failed to live up to box office expectations on its opening weekend, reports say — putting pressure on Disney's $2 billion bet\". *Business Insider*.

To cope with the huge amount of data, Wētā used the services of cloud storage company Amazon Web Services.[135]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*The Way of Water* is the first of four planned sequels to *Avatar*. *Avatar 3* started filming simultaneously with this film in New Zealand on September 25, 2017.

This included a gross of $51.3 million during the weekend. The box-office gross of the film was impacted by the recent surge in COVID-19 infections in the country.

The ensemble cast includes Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Max von Sydow.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nand other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2015's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[162]\n\n\n\n#### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nAnalysts said that the box office receipts of the film, when compared to predecessors, must be adjusted for inflation, and that the first *Star Wars* film made more when this adjustment is made.[286] It has further been observed that each of the first three films in the series was more profitable in calculating revenue against production costs.[286]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe film was announced after The Walt Disney Company's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012. The film is the first *Star Wars* film to not extensively involve franchise creator George Lucas, who only served as a creative consultant in the early stages of production. *The Force Awakens* was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original trilogy films *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) and *Return of the Jedi*, rewrote an initial script by Michael Arndt. John Williams, composer for the previous episodic films, returned to compose the score. Principal photography began in April 2014 and concluded the following November. Filming took place on sets at Pinewood Studios in England, and on location mainly in Abu Dhabi, Iceland, and Ireland. On a budget of $447 million, it is the most expensive film ever made.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n250. ^ ***a*** ***b*** D'Alessandro, Anthony; Tartaglione, Nancy (December 14, 2015). \"Planet Earth Braces For 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' To Make Intergalactic B.O.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in *Infinity War*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe marketing campaign for *Endgame* cost over $200 million, the most for any Marvel Studios film. Promotional partners included Stand Up to Cancer, Mastercard, Ulta Beauty, the Audi e-tron GT concept car (which appears in the film), McDonald's, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Google, General Mills, Hertz, Ziploc, Oppo, and Synchrony Financial.[119] A year prior to the film's release, Germain Lussier of *io9* spoke on the approach Marvel might have to take in marketing the film, given the end of *Infinity War* where many established characters die. He questioned if those characters would appear on posters and in toy campaigns and if the actors portraying them would participate in press events leading up to the film's release. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n154. **^** D'Alessandro, Anthony (April 24, 2020). \"*Avengers: Endgame* Is No. 1 in *Deadline*'s 2019 Most Valuable Blockbuster Tournament; How Its Billion-Dollar Opening Rocked Exhibition and Generated a $900M Profit\". *Deadline Hollywood*.
