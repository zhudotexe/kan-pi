LaGuardia High School) as specialized high schools of New York City. The act called for a uniform exam to be administered for admission to Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, and Stuyvesant.[27] The exam, named the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), tested the mathematical and verbal abilities of students who were applying to any of the specialized high schools. The only exception was for applicants to LaGuardia High School, who were accepted by audition rather than examination.[27]\n\n\n\n#### September 11 attacks[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. **^** \"Stuyvesant High School\".

Operated by the New York City Department of Education, these specialized schools offer tuition-free accelerated academics to city residents. It is one of the most selective public high schools in New York City, New York State, and the United States.\n\n\nStuyvesant was established as an all-boys school in the East Village of Manhattan in 1904. An entrance examination was mandated for all applicants starting in 1934, and the school started accepting female students in 1969. Stuyvesant moved to its current location at Battery Park City in 1992 because the student body had become too large to be suitably accommodated in the original campus. The old building now houses several high schools.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** \"Girl Challenges Stuyvesant High's All-Boy Policy; She Seeks to Take Exam at School Thursday Bid to Advance in Grade Is Factor in Rejection\" (PDF). *The New York Times*.

The exam would become known as the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) and tested students in Math and English. With its statewide recognition, the school had to become co-educational.

Routinely, 99% of its graduates are accepted to four-year colleges[13] with the 2020 graduating class being offered more than $150 million in scholarships and grants.[14] In 2011, *U.S. News & World Report* ranked Brooklyn Tech among the nation's 50 best high schools for mathematics and science.[15] It was ranked #2 on *Niche*'s \"Standout High Schools in America\" list.[16]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Admissions | Competitive Examination |\n| Website | bths.edu |\n\n\n**Brooklyn Technical High School**, commonly called **Brooklyn Tech** and administratively designated **High School 430**, is a public high school in New York City that specializes in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. It is one of the three original specialized high schools operated by the New York City Department of Education, along with Stuyvesant High School and the Bronx High School of Science. Brooklyn Tech is considered one of the country's most prestigious and selective high schools.[4][5]\n\n\nAdmission to Brooklyn Tech involves taking the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test and scoring the cutoff for Brooklyn Tech. Each November, about 30,000 eighth and ninth graders take the 3-hour test for admittance to eight of the nine specialized high schools. About 1,400 to 1,500 students are admitted each year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrooklyn Tech counts top scientists, inventors, innovators, *Fortune* 500 company CEOs and founders, high-ranking diplomats, academic scholars, literary and media figures, professional athletes, National Medal recipients, Nobel laureates, and Olympic medalists among its alumni.\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n### Admission[edit]\n\n\nAdmission to Brooklyn Tech is based exclusively on the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), open to all eighth-grade and first-time ninth-grade New York City students. The test has math (word problems and computation) and verbal (reading comprehension and grammar) sections. Of the approximately 30,000 students taking the SHSAT for September 2011 admission, with 23,085 students listing Brooklyn Tech as a choice on their application, about 1,951 offers were made (the most of any of the specialized high schools, partly due to the school's size).[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Graduation requirements[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1918, Dr. Albert L. Colston, chair of the Math Department at Manual Training High School, recommended establishing a technical high school for Brooklyn boys. His plan envisioned a heavy concentration of math, science, and drafting courses with parallel paths leading either to college or to a technical career in industry. By 1922, Dr. Colston's concept was approved by the Board of Education, and Brooklyn Technical High School opened in a converted warehouse at 49 Flatbush Avenue Extension, with 2,400 students. This location, in the shadow of the Manhattan Bridge, is the reason the school seal bears that bridge's image, rather than the more obvious symbol for the borough, the Brooklyn Bridge. Brooklyn Tech would occupy one more location before settling into its site at 29 Fort Greene Place, for which the groundbreaking was held in 1930.[17]\n\n\n\n### Early years[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Abraham Lincoln HS\n* James Madison HS\n* William H.

The curriculum consists of two years of general studies with a technical and engineering emphasis, followed by two years of a student-chosen major.\n\n\nThe curriculum remained largely unchanged until the end of Dr. Colston's 20-year term as principal in 1942. Upon his retirement, Tech was led briefly by acting principal Ralph Breiling, who was succeeded by Principal Harold Taylor in 1944. Tech's modernization would come under Principal William Pabst, who assumed stewardship in 1946 after serving as chair of the Electrical Department. Pabst created new majors and refined older ones, allowing students to select science and engineering preparatory majors including Aeronautical, Architecture, Chemical, Civil, Electrical (later including Electronics and Broadcast), Industrial Design, Mechanical, Structural, and Arts and Sciences. A general College Preparatory curriculum was added later.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_cTfEqD3B9zhVg0lqQRdrtx5x","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
