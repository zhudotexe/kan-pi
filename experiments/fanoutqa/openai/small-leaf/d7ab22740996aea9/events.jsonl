Such occurrences have been reported in many countries throughout history.[1] One hypothesis is that tornadic waterspouts sometimes pick up creatures such as fish or frogs, and carry them for up to several miles.[1][2] However, this aspect of the phenomenon has never been witnessed by scientists.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nRain of flightless animals and things has been reported throughout history.[1] In the first century AD, Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder documented storms of frogs and fish.[4] In 1794, French soldiers saw toads fall from the sky during heavy rain at Lalain, near the French city of Lille.[5] Rural inhabitants in Yoro, Honduras claim \"fish rain\" happens there every summer, a phenomenon they call Lluvia de Peces.[6]\n\n\n\n## Explanations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tornadoes and waterspouts may lift up animals into the air and deposit them miles away\nFrench physicist André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836) was among the first scientists to take seriously accounts of raining animals. Addressing the Society of Natural Science, Ampère suggested that at times frogs and toads roam the countryside in large numbers, and that violent winds could pick them up and carry them great distances.[3]\n\n\nAfter a reported rain of fish in Singapore in 1861, French naturalist Francis de Laporte de Castelnau speculated that a migration of walking catfish had taken place, dragging themselves over land from one puddle to another, following the rain.[7]\n\n\nThe likeliest explanation for many of the supposed cases is that there is no falling happening at all and the animals are driven along by winds or a deluge of some sort.[8] This explanation also accounts for the prevalence of reports that only a single species or type of animal is ever reported raining from the sky.\n\n\nA current scientific hypothesis involves tornadic waterspouts: a tornado that forms over the water.[1][9][10][11] Under this hypothesis, a tornadic waterspout transports animals to relatively high altitudes, carrying them over large distances. This hypothesis appears supported by the type of animals in these rains: small and light, usually aquatic,[12] and by the suggestion that the rain of animals is often preceded by a storm. However, the theory does not account for how all the animals involved in each individual incident would be from only one species, and not a group of similarly sized animals from a single area.[13] Further, the theory also does not account for a genuine tornadic waterspout not actually sucking objects up and carrying them rather than flinging objects out to the sides.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Doppler Image from Texas showing the collision of a thunderstorm with a group of bats in flight. The color red indicates the animals flying into the storm.\nIn the case of birds, storms may overcome a flock in flight, especially in times of migration. The Doppler image to the right shows an example wherein a group of bats is overtaken by a thunderstorm.[15] In the image, the bats are in the red zone, which corresponds to winds moving away from the radar station, and enter into a mesocyclone associated with a tornado (in green). These events may occur easily with birds, which can get killed in flight, or stunned and then fall (unlike flightless creatures, which first have to be lifted into the air by an outside force). Sometimes this happens in large groups, for instance, the blackbirds falling from the sky in Beebe, Arkansas, United States on December 31, 2010.[16] It is common for birds to become disoriented (for example, because of bad weather or fireworks) and collide with objects such as trees or buildings, killing them or stunning them into falling to their death. The number of blackbirds killed in Beebe is not spectacular considering the size of their congregations, which can be in the millions.[17] The event in Beebe, however, captured the imagination and led to more reports in the media of birds falling from the sky across the globe, such as in Sweden and Italy,[18] though many scientists claim such mass deaths are common occurrences but usually go unnoticed.[19] In contrast, it is harder to find a plausible explanation for rains of terrestrial animals.\n\n\nSome cases are thought to be caused by birds dropping fish. With regard to a documented rain of fish that occurred on December 29, 2021 in Texarkana, Texas, independent researchers Sharon A. Hill and Paul Cropper proposed that the fish had been dropped or possibly regurgitated by passing birds.[20] The theory found some favor with airport workers who had cleaned up the fish; they noted that there were birds in the area around the same time, and the fish \"were kind of chewed up\". In June 2022 around the San Francisco coast, a boom of anchovies is likely to be the cause of fair weather falling of fish from birds' mouths, such as pelicans.[21]\n\n\n\n## Occurrences[edit]\n\n\nThe following list is a selection of examples.\n\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1555 engraving of rain of fish\n* Singapore, February 22, 1861[22]\n* Tarai, Nepal, May 15, 1900[23]\n* Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada, July 1, 1903[24]\n* Marksville, Louisiana, October 23, 1947[25]\n* Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria, May 19, 1993\n* Knighton, Powys, Wales, 18 August 2004[26]\n* Kerala State, India, February 12, 2008[27]\n* Bhanwad, Jamnagar, India, October 24, 2009[28]\n* Lajamanu, Northern Territory, Australia, February 25 and 26, 2010[29]\n* Loreto, Agusan del Sur, Philippines, January 13, 2012[30][31]\n* IIT Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India September 12, 2013[32]\n* The annual Lluvia de Peces in Yoro, Honduras\n* Chilaw, Sri Lanka, 6 May 2014[33]\n* Nandigama, Andhra Pradesh India, 19 June 2015,[34]\n* Guntur, Andhra Pradesh India, 16 August 2015[35]\n* Dire Dawa, Ethiopia, 20 January 2016[36]\n* Pathapatnam, Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh, 19 May 2016[37]\n* Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 9 September 2016[38]\n* Mexico, Tamaulipas, Tampico, 26 September 2017[39]\n* Oroville, California, 16 May 2017[40]\n* Jaffna, Sri Lanka, 7 November 2017[41]\n* Texarkana, Texas, 30 December 2021[42]\n\n\n### Spiders[edit]\n\n\n* Albury, Australia, 1974[43]\n* Santo Antônio da Platina, Brazil, February 3, 2013[44]\n* Goulburn, Australia, 15 May 2015[43]\n\n\n### Frogs and toads[edit]\n\n\n* Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan, June 2009 (occurrences reported throughout the month)[45]\n* Rákóczifalva, Hungary, 18–20 June 2010 (twice)[46]\n* Cabo Polonio, Uruguay, Since 2011 (twice)[47]\n\n\n### Others[edit]\n\n\n* Jellyfish: Bath, England, 1894[48]\n* Worms: Jennings, Louisiana, July 11, 2007[49]\n* Various marine animals, including octopuses, seashells and starfish: Qingdao, Shandong Province, China, June 13, 2018[50]\n\n\n## Examples in popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* *Magnolia*\n* *Sharknado (film series)*\n* *Watchmen (TV series)*\n* *Good Omens (book and in the title sequence of Amazon Prime video series)*\n* *Fuego gris* (also here: at the article's Spanish version).\n* *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 6: Stone Ocean (manga/anime series)*\n* *The Sarah Jane Adventures, series 5, episode 2, The Curse of Clyde Langer*\n* Fargo (TV series)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Blood rain\n* Flying fish\n* Kentucky meat shower\n* Lluvia de Peces, (Honduras, \"Fish rain\")\n* Raining cats and dogs\n* Red rain in Kerala\n* Star jelly\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Can it rain frogs, fish or other objects\". *Library of Congress*. 26 August 2010.\n2. **^** How can it rain fish?

The variety of religions is a direct reflection of the diversity of races living there. The Chinese are mainly Buddhists, Taoists and Christians, with many irreligious exceptions. Malays are predominantly Muslims (around 99%), while Indians are mostly Hindus, but with significant numbers of Muslims, Christians and Sikhs from the Indian ethnic groups.\n\n\nReligion is still an integral part of cosmopolitan Singapore. Many of its significant buildings are religious, be it temples, churches or mosques. An understanding of these buildings do play a part in contributing to appreciation of their art.\n\n\nTaoist and Confucian doctrines and deities, together with ancestral worship, are combined in various ways in the Chinese folk religions and Chinese folk religious sects.\n\n\n\n## Major religious communities[edit]\n\n\n### Buddhism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Main Shrine Hall of Singapore Buddhist Lodge\nMain article: Buddhism in Singapore\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Ethnic Group | Total Resident Population of Ethnic Group | Population of Resident Ethnic Group registered as Muslims | Percentage of Resident Ethnic Group registered as Muslims | Percentage of Muslim Residents by Ethnic Group\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chinese | 2,606,881 | 11,953 | 0.46% | 2.22%\n |\n| Malays | 447,747 | 442,368 | 98.80% | 82.03%\n |\n| Indians | 299,056 | 69,964 | 23.39% | 12.97%\n |\n| Others | 105,410 | 14,966 | 14.20% | 2.78%\n |\n| **Overall** | **3,459,093** | **539,251** | **15.59%** | **100%** |\n\n\n### Taoism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Taoism in Singapore\n\n![](image)Thian Hock Keng (built 1842) is the oldest Taoist temple in Singapore.\nAccording to the 2020 Census, 8.8% of Singaporeans declared themselves as Taoist.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBelow are the ethnic breakdown of Buddhists according to the 2020 Singapore Census of Population as follows:[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Ethnic Group | Total Resident Population of Ethnic Group | Population of Resident Ethnic Group registered as Buddhists | Percentage of Resident Ethnic Group registered as Buddhists | Percentage of Buddhist Residents by Ethnic Group\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chinese | 2,606,881 | 1,052,114 | 40.36% | 97.95%\n |\n| Malays | 447,747 | 447 | 0.10% | 0.04%\n |\n| Indians | 299,056 | 2,031 | 0.68% | 0.19%\n |\n| Others | 105,410 | 19,566 | 18.56% | 1.82%\n |\n| **Overall** | **3,459,093** | **1,074,159** | **31.05%** | **100%** |\n\n\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Christianity in Singapore\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Ethnic Group | Total Resident Population of Ethnic Group | Population of Resident Ethnic Group registered as Taoists | Percentage of Resident Ethnic Group registered as Taoists | Percentage of Taoist Residents by Ethnic Group\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chinese | 2,606,881 | 303,095 | 11.63% | 99.72%\n |\n| Malays | 447,747 | 133 | 0.03% | 0.04%\n |\n| Indians | 299,056 | 63 | 0.02% | 0.02%\n |\n| Others | 105,410 | 669 | 0.63% | 0.22%\n |\n| **Overall** | **3,459,093** | **303,960** | **8.79%** | **100%** |\n\n\n### Hinduism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hinduism in Singapore\n\n![](image)Sri Mariamman Temple (built 1827) in the Chinatown district is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore.\nAccording to the latest 2020 census, 5.0% of Singaporeans declare themselves as Hindus.\n\n\nThe majority of Singapore's present Hindus are descendants of Indians who migrated soon after the founding of Singapore in 1819.

However, some religions or denominations are officially banned by the government, as they are deemed as cults, such as Jehovah's Witnesses and the Unification Church, although their followers practised in secrecy in the 2010s.[6][7] Some religions, especially those practised by Chinese ethnic groups, have merged their places of worship with other religions such as Hinduism and Islam. A prominent example is that of Loyang Tua Pek Kong Temple (situated in the eastern coastal line) wherein three religions, namely Taoism, Hinduism, and Buddhism are co-located.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of 2020, 20% of Singaporeans had no religious affiliation.[1]The proportion of Irregious people is higher among Chinese people, with one in four Chinese having no religion in the 2020 Census.[1] The Singapore non-religious community itself is very diverse, with many calling themselves atheists, agnostics, free thinkers, humanists, secularists, theists or sceptics. In addition, there some people who decline religious labels but still practice traditional rituals like ancestor worship. The number of non-religious people in Singapore has risen gradually over the decades. Census reports show that those who said they have no religion rose from 13.0% in 1980 to 17.0% in 2010 and to 20.0% in 2020 . In recent years, social gatherings of non-religious people are becoming popular in Singapore. The Singapore Humanism Meetup is a major network of over 400 secular Humanists, freethinkers, atheists, and agnostics. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Age Group | Buddhist | Irreligious | Muslim | Christian | Taoist | Hindu | Others\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 15-24 | 24.9% | 24.2% | 21.4% | 18.6% | 4.9% | 5.4% | 0.6%\n |\n| 25-34 | 26.0% | 26.2% | 19.4% | 17.7% | 6.1% | 4.0% | 0.6%\n |\n| 35-44 | 30.2% | 22.3% | 14.2% | 18.5% | 7.2% | 7.0% | 0.6%\n |\n| 45-54 | 33.3% | 18.3% | 13.8% | 20.6% | 7.1% | 6.2% | 0.7%\n |\n| 55 and above | 35.1% | 15.2% | 13.2% | 19.0% | 13.1% | 3.7% | 0.7%\n |\n\n\nThe above figures refer to the resident population only, and do not include the non-resident population (Singapore authorities do not release figures for the non-resident population which accounted for 18.33% of Singapore's population in 2005).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough Taoist temples and shrines are abundant in Singapore, the official number of followers has dwindled drastically over the years from 22.4% to 8.5% between the years 1990 to 2000. This, however, may be accounted for by the unclear delineation between Taoism and Buddhism in popular perception. For example, the difference between the two religions can be negligible enough that when a Chinese says that they \"offer incense sticks\" it is usually assumed that they are Buddhist even though they may not actually be Buddhist. The 2010 and 2015 censuses have shown that Taoist identity has declined again to represent about 10% of Singapore's population.\n\n\nBelow are the ethnic breakdown of Taoists according to the 2020 Singapore Census of Population as follows:[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Ethnic Group | Total Resident Population of Ethnic Group | Population of Resident Ethnic Group registered as Sikhs | Percentage of Resident Ethnic Group registered as Sikhs | Percentage of Sikh Residents by Ethnic Group\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chinese | 2,606,881 | 11 | 0.0004% | 0.09%\n |\n| Malays | 447,747 | 80 | 0.02% | 0.66%\n |\n| Indians | 299,056 | 10,265 | 3.43% | 85.18%\n |\n| Others | 105,410 | 1,695 | 1.61% | 14.07%\n |\n| **Overall** | **3,459,093** | **12,051** | **0.35%** | **100%** |\n\n\n## Small religious communities[edit]\n\n\n### Jainism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jainism in Singapore\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Ethnic Group | Total Resident Population of Ethnic Group | Population of Resident Ethnic Group registered as Hindus | Percentage of Resident Ethnic Group registered as Hindus | Percentage of Hindu Residents by Ethnic Group\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chinese | 2,606,881 | 458 | 0.018% | 0.26%\n |\n| Malays | 447,747 | 223 | 0.05% | 0.13%\n |\n| Indians | 299,056 | 171,326 | 57.29% | 99.05%\n |\n| Others | 105,410 | 956 | 0.91% | 0.55%\n |\n| **Overall** | **3,459,093** | **172,963** | **5.00%** | **100%** |\n\n\n### Sikhism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sikhism in Singapore\n\n![](image)Central Sikh Temple (founded 1912) is the oldest Sikh gurdwara in Singapore.\nThe first Sikhs to settle in Singapore came in 1849.

The Government does not tolerate speech or actions that it deems could adversely affect racial or religious harmony.\n\n\nIn 2023, the country was scored 3 out of 4 for religious freedom, according to Freedom House based in America.[50]\n\n\n\n### Jehovah's Witnesses[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses § Singapore\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShinnyo-en is a Japanese Buddhist order founded in 1936 by Shinjō Itō and his wife Tomoji in the tradition of the Daigo branch of Shingon Buddhism.

Its membership was estimated to be about 40,000 people in 25,000 households in 2005.[38] The group has been an active participant at the annual National Day Parade and Chingay events. The association is headquartered in Tampines and runs a Soka Kindergarten there.

The Singapore Jain Religious Society actively engages in keeping traditions and practices alive by transmitting Jain principles to the next generation. It also has a strong history of community involvement. The Jains have no temple, but the Singapore Jain Religious Society has a building on 18 Jalan Yasin.\n\n\nAs of 2006, there were 1,000 Jains in Singapore.[18]\n\n\n\n### Zoroastrianism[edit]\n\n\nThere is a small community of about 300 Parsi Zoroastrians residing in Singapore.[19] There is no fire temple in Singapore,[19] but Zoroastrian House is home to the Parsi Zoroastrian Association of South East Asia, and contains a prayer hall for the community.[20]\n\n\n\n### Judaism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Jews in Singapore\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Bahá`u'lláh:  Bishárát, *Tablets of Bahá`u'lláh revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas*, p. 22-13\n23. **^** \"Baha'i Faith - Inter-Religious Organisation, Singapore\".\n24. **^** \"The Brahma Kumaris in a Nutshell « Brahma Kumaris Info - the Truth about the BKWSU\".

In 2011, these two religions represented 81.3% and 9.04% of the national population, respectively. Outside of India, Nepal is home to the greatest number of Hindus in the world.[6][7]\n\n\nThe majority of prominent Hindu pilgrimage sites are located in this nation. Shiva is widely regarded as the guardian deity of Nepal.[8] Nepal is home to the world-famous Pashupatinath Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site where Hindus from around the world come for pilgrimage purposes. According to the Hindu epic *Ramayana*, the goddess Sita was born in the Mithila Kingdom of King Janaka.[9] The national animal of Nepal is the cow,[10] which is considered a sacred animal in Hinduism.[11] Because of this, the slaughter of cows is illegal in Nepal.[12]\n\n\nNepal is the birthplace of Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha). As such, Buddhism has a special place in the country and is often intertwined with Hinduism among some communities.[7][13] Nepal is a multicultural, multi-ethnic, multilingual, and multi-religious nation through democracy.[14][15]\n\n\nThe Nepali constitution guarantees freedom of religion. Forced conversion from Hinduism to other religions is against the law, especially when money is used as a direct or indirect incentive to convert. However, anyone can choose to change their religion on their own. Nationalists have sometimes protested against secularism, and many citizens wish to see Nepal as a Hindu-Democratic state.[16] Prior to the movement for democracy in early 2006 and the sacking of King Gyanendra in 2008, the country was officially a Hindu kingdom, and the constitution still protects and fosters the Hindu religion. Recently, Nepal's senior minister, Prem Ale, has advocated for declaring Nepal a Hindu state constitutionally.[17] Hinduism is the majority religion in Nepal and profoundly influences its social structure and politics, while Buddhism (Tibetan Buddhism) is practiced by some ethnic groups (such as the Newar people) in forms that are strongly influenced by Hinduism. Kiratism is the indigenous religion of the population belonging to the Kirati ethnicity. Small populations, especially in eastern Nepal, adhere to Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Jainism, Bön, and the Bahá’í Faith.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nepali bride and bridegroom\nHinduism have been present in Nepal since the beginning of recorded history in the area. Muslims came to the country around the 11th century and brought Islam with them. Sikhism came to Nepal during the 18th century and spread throughout Nepal, and Jainism came to Nepal during the 19th century but spread only to Kathmandu and some districts of Nepal.\n\n\nReligious tolerance can be found in royal orders dated Falgun Sudi 12, 1884 V.S. issued by the Hindu Shah monarch Rajendra Bikram Shah under the premiership of Bhimsen Thapa to Buddhist monks in the Kingdom of Nepal:\n\n\n\n\n> Our father (i.e. King Girban) has issued a copper plate inscription declaring that nobody shall harass you so long as you observe traditional religious practices (dharma). We hereby reconfirm that order.\n> \n> — Royal Order to Jhimuryas of Tukucha-Gumba[18]\n> \n\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, 81.3% of the Nepalese population is Hindu, 9.0% are Buddhist, 4.4% are Muslim, 3.0% are Kiratist (indigenous ethnic religion), 1.4% are Christian, 0.1% are Sikhs, 0.1% are Jains and 0.7% follow other religions or no religion.[1] This varies from the 2001 census, where 80.62% of Nepalese were Hindu, 10.74% were Buddhist, 4.20% were Muslim,[19] 3.60% were Kirant (an indigenous religion), 0.45% were Christian, and 0.4% were classified as other groups such as Bön. \n\n\nIn 1971, Hindus made up 89.4% of the population, Buddhists 7.5%, and Kirants statistically, 0%. However, the prevalence of dual-faith practices - particularly among Hindus and Buddhists - complicates statistics on religious groups.\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, Hindus made up at least 87% of the population in every region. The largest concentrations of Buddhists were found in the eastern hills, the Kathmandu Valley, and the central Tarai; in each area, about 10% of the people were Buddhist. Buddhism was more common among the Newar and Tibeto-Nepalese groups. Among the Tibeto-Nepalese, those most influenced by Hinduism were the Magar, Sunuwar, and Rai peoples. Hindu influence was less prominent among the Gurung, Limbu, Bhote, Tamang, and Thakali groups, who continued to employ Buddhist monks for their religious ceremonies. Since Hinduism and Buddhism are both Dharmic religions, their practices usually complement each other, and many people practice a combination of both. In 2015, a new constitution was adopted, and equal rights were granted to all religions in Nepal. However, influencing others to change their religion is prohibited.[20]\n\n\nNepal's constitution does not give anyone the right to evangelise or convert anyone to another religion. Nepal also passed a more stringent anti-conversion law in 2017.[21]\n\n\n\n## Secularism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: freedom of religion in Nepal\n\nNepal was declared a secular state in 2015 after the success of the Constitution of Nepal 2072 bs that saw the abolition of hinduisim and the formation of democracy as a criterion for running the nation on the path of equality, fraternity, freedom, justice, and liberty.[22]\n\n\nIn 2023, the country was scored 2 out of 4 for religious freedom.[23]\n\n\nThe five main provisions of secularism in Nepal are as follows:[24]\n\n\n1) A clause that says, \"Religious and cultural freedom, with the protection of religion and culture practiced since ancient times,\" This has been questioned by some people, who say that it indirectly favours \"Hinduism\" as a state-sponsored religion.[25]\n\n\n2) Proselytizing remains illegal.\n\n\n3) Critics say that the constitution discriminates against women in terms of passing on citizenship rights, and the citizenship policy was hotly debated during the drafting of the constitution.[26]\n\n\n4) It is against the law for the state and the courts to treat people differently because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The constitution of Nepal has been an inspiration for Asia and beyond the world to specifically protect the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities.[27]\n\n\n5) The rhododendron is the national flower, and the cow, which is a holy animal in Hinduism, is the national animal.[28]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPopulation trends for major religious groups in Nepal[29][30]\n| Religion\n | Population\n% 1952/1954\n | Population\n% 1961\n | Population\n% 1971\n | Population\n% 1981\n | Population\n% 1991\n | Population\n% 2001\n | Population\n% 2011\n | Population\n% 2021\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hinduism\n | 88.87%\n | 87.69%\n | 89.39%\n | 89.50%\n | 86.51%\n | 80.62%\n | 81.34%\n | 81.19%\n |\n| Buddhism\n | 8.59%\n | 9.25%\n | 7.50%\n | 5.32%\n | 7.78%\n | 10.74%\n | 9.04%\n | 8.21%\n |\n| Islam\n | 2.54%\n | 2.98%\n | 3.04%\n | 2.66%\n | 3.53%\n | 4.20%\n | 4.39%\n | 5.09%\n |\n| Kirat\n | N/A\n | N/A\n | N/A\n | N/A\n | 1.72%\n | 3.60%\n | 3.04%\n | 3.17%\n |\n| Christianity\n | N/A\n | N/A\n | 0.02%\n | 0.03%\n | 0.17%\n | 0.45%\n | 1.41%\n | 1.76%\n |\n| Others/Unspecified\n | 0.01%\n | 0.07%\n | 0.05%\n | 2.49%\n | 0.28%\n | 0.39%\n | 0.78%\n | 0.58%\n |\n\n\n\n\nReligion in Nepal (2021 Census)[31]\n| Religion\n | Population\n | Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hinduism | 23,677,744\n | 81.19%\n |\n| Buddhism | 2,393,549\n | 8.2%\n |\n| Islam | 1,483,060\n | 5.09%\n |\n| Kirat | 924,204\n | 3.17%\n |\n| Christianity | 512,313\n | 1.76%\n |\n| Prakriti (Nature Worship) | 102,048\n | 0.46%\n |\n| Bon | 67,223\n | 0.04%\n |\n| Jainism | 2,398\n | 0.01%\n |\n| Sikhism | 1,496\n | 0.01%\n |\n| Bahá'í | 537\n | 0.01%\n |\n| Total\n | **29,164,578** | **100%** |\n\n\n## Hinduism in Nepalese culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hinduism in Nepal\n\n![](image)Procession of Nepali Hindu wedding; groom puts *Sindoor* (vermilion powder) on bride's head\n![](image)Procession of Nepali Hindu wedding; groom being carried by a helper\nAccording to Nepalese theology, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva came to Nepal in the form of deer.[32]\n\n\n\n### Establishment of Nepal by Ne Muni[edit]\n\n\nKing Muni used to perform religious ceremonies at Teku, the confluence of the Bagmati and Bishnumati rivers.[33] He selected Bhuktaman to be the first king in the line of the Gopal (*Cowherd*) Dynasty.[33] The Gopal dynasty ruled for 300 years. Yakshya Yadav was the last king of this dynasty. The Kirat Dynasty ruled for 550 - 800 years. The first king of Kirat Yalambar and Gasti was the last king of this dynasty. The Licchavi dynasty ruled for 200 - 350 years. The Malla dynasty ruled for 400 - 600 years. The Shah dynasty ruled for 300 years.\n\n\n\n### Flag of Nepal[edit]\n\n\nThe current flag of Nepal was established in 1962. It depicts a white moon and crescent shape emitting eight rays above a white sun which emits 12 rays.[34]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Nepal portal\n* ![icon](image)Religion portal\n\n\n* Buddhism in Nepal\n* Newar Buddhism\n* Banishment of Buddhist monks from Nepal\n* Hinduism in Nepal\n* Newar Hinduism\n* Gurung shamanism\n* Islam in Nepal\n\t+ Nepali Muslims\n* Judaism in Nepal\n* Christianity in Nepal\n\t+ Roman Catholicism in Nepal\n* Jainism in Nepal\n* Bahá'í Faith in Nepal\n* Sikhism in Nepal\n* Irreligion in Nepal\n* Freedom of religion in Nepal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"नेपालमा ८१ प्रतिशत हिन्दु, क्रिश्चियन २ प्रतिशत भन्दा कम\".\n2. **^** Interim Constitution of Nepal - Equal Rights Trust\n3. **^** \"The Interim constitution of Nepal (2015), privileges Hinduism as the state sponsored religion\". *Scroll In*. 20 September 2015.

Muslims are a majority in states Jammu and Kashmir and Lakshadweep,[102] and live in high concentrations in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, and Kerala.[102][103] There has been no particular census conducted in India with regards to sects, but sources suggest the largest denomination is Sunni Islam[104] with a substantial minority of Shia Muslims and Ahmadiyya Muslims. Indian sources like Times of India and DNA reported the Indian Shiite population in mid-2005–2006 to be between 25% and 31% of entire Muslim population of India, which accounts them in numbers between 40 and 50 million.[105][106][104][107]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAround 2.9 million people in India did not state their religion in the 2001 census and were counted in the category, \"religion not stated\".

The effective religion in Sikkim, which joined the Indian Union in 1975 (making it India's 22nd state) remains Vajrayana Buddhism, and Padmasambhava or Guru Ugyen is a revered presence there.\n\n\n\n### Jainism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jainism in India\n\n![](image)Ranakpur Jain temple\nJainism is a non-theistic Indian religion and philosophical system originating in Iron Age India. Jains compose 0.4% (around 4.45 million) of India's population, and are concentrated in the states of Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan.[102]\n\n\n\n### Judaism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Jews in India\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt is difficult to establish the exact numbers of Baháʼís in India. The religion came to India from Iran in about 1850 and gained some converts from the Muslim population of India. The first Sikh and Hindu converts came by 1910, and in 1960 there were fewer than 1,000 Baháʼís in all of India. Beginning in 1961, large numbers from scheduled castes became Baháʼís, and by 1993 Baháʼís reported about 2.2 million members,[5] though later sources have claimed 2 million,[119] or \"more than 1 million\".[120]\n\n\n\n### Atheism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Irreligion in India\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Baháʼí Faith's Lotus Temple in Delhi, India\nAs of the census of 2001, Parsis (followers of Zoroastrianism in India) represent approximately 0.006% of the total population of India,[117] with relatively high concentrations in and around the city of Mumbai. Parsis number around 61,000 in India.[118]\n\n\nThere are several tribal religions in India, such as Donyi-Polo.

According to a survey, 31% of Indian population claims to be vegetarian, and mainly practice lacto-vegetarianism.[135][136][137] Vegetarianism is less common among Sikhs, Muslims, Christians, Bahá'ís, Parsis, and Jews.Despite the majority of population having no objection to meat consumption, globally India has the lowest meat consumption per capita.[138] Non-vegetarian Indians mostly prefer poultry, fish, other seafood, goat, and sheep as their sources of meat.[139] Hinduism forbids beef whilst islam forbids pork. The smaller populations of christians, tribals, and some dalit communities have no objection to eating either beef or pork.[140] \nJainism requires followers, from all its sects and traditions, to be vegetarian. Furthermore, the religion also forbids \n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Christianity in India\n\n![](image)The Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health of Velankanni, in Tamil Nadu, is a very devoted Catholic Marian shrine.\nChristianity is a monotheistic religion centred on the life and teachings of Jesus as presented in the New Testament. It is the third largest religion of India, making up 2.3% of the population. St. Thomas is credited with introduction of Christianity in India. He arrived on the Malabar Coast in 52 CE.[108][109][110] \nThe tradition of origin among Saint Thomas Christians relates to the arrival of Saint Thomas, one of the 12 disciples of Jesus at the ancient seaport Muziris on the Kerala coast in 52 CE. The families Sankaramangalam, Pakalomattam, Kalli, and Kaliyankal were considered particularly preeminent, and historically the most aristocratic Syriac Christian families tended to claim descent from these families.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther minor sects in India carry no specific name, but they are uniquely identified by the last names of each family. This convention is used more frequently in South India than in North India. For example, a relatively prominent sect in southern India prohibits making important decisions, commencing new tasks, and doing other intellectually or spiritually engaged actions after sunset. Historians believe that this tradition was derived from the concept of Rahukaalam, in which Hindus believe that a specific period of the day is inauspicious. Stringent family beliefs are thought to have led to the development of a more constrained religious hierarchy.[156] Over time, this belief was extended to discourage taking major actions and even staying awake for long periods after sunset. Examples of families which follow this tradition include *Gudivada*, *Padalapalli*, *Pantham*, and *Kashyap*.[155]\n\n\n\n## Religiosity[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Irreligion in India\n\nReligiosity among Indians (2012 Survey)[123]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCharacteristics of religious groups[85]\n| Religiousgroup\n | Population (2011)%\n | Growth(2001-2011)[86][87] | Sex ratio (2011)(total)[88] | Sex ratio (2011)(rural)\n | Sex ratio (2011)(urban)\n | Sex ratio (2011)(child)[89] | Literacy (2011)(%)[90] | Work participation (2011)(%)[88][91] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hinduism\n | 79.80% | 16.8% | 939 | 946 | 921 | 913 | 73.3% | 41.0%\n |\n| Islam | 14.23% | 24.6% | 951 | 957 | 941 | 943 | 68.5% | 32.6%\n |\n| Christianity | 2.30% | 15.5% | 1023 | 1008 | 1046 | 958 | 84.5% | 41.9%\n |\n| Sikhism | 1.72% | 8.4% | 903 | 905 | 898 | 828 | 75.4% | 36.3%\n |\n| Buddhism | 0.70% | 6.1% | 965 | 960 | 973 | 933 | 81.3% | 43.1%\n |\n| Jainism | 0.37% | 5.4% | 954 | 935 | 959 | 889 | 94.9% | 35.5%\n |\n| Others/Religion not specified\n | 0.90% | n/a | 959 | 947 | 975 | 974 | n/a | n/a\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. **^** Nambiar, Sridevi (26 July 2017). \"The Story Behind India's Oldest Mosque\". *Culture Trip*.

Around 8.5 million Buddhists live in India, about 0.7% of the total population.[116] Buddhism as a religion is practised mainly in the foothills of the Himalayas and is a significant religion in Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Ladakh, Darjeeling in West Bengal, and the Lahaul and Spiti districts of Himachal Pradesh. Besides, a significant number of Buddhists reside in Maharashtra. They are the Buddhists or Navayana Buddhists who, under the influence of B. R. Ambedkar embraced Buddhism in order to escape the casteist practices within Hinduism. Ambedkar is a crucial figure, along with Anagarika Dharmapala of Sri Lanka and Kripasaran Mahasthavira of Chittagong behind the revival of Buddhism in India in the 19th and 20th centuries. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"India has 79.8% Hindus, 14.2% Muslims, says 2011 census data on religion\". *Firstpost*. 26 August 2016.

There are a few Israelis in Manila recruiting caregivers for Israel, some work in call centers, entrepreneurs, and a few other executives.\n\n\n\n## Indian religions[edit]\n\n\n### Buddhism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Buddhism in the Philippines\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the 2015 census, Evangelicals comprised 2% of the population. It is particularly strong among American and Korean communities, Northern Luzon especially in Cordillera Administrative Region, Southern Mindanao[11] and many other tribal groups in the Philippines.[*citation needed*] Protestants both mainline and evangelical have gained significant annual growth rate up to 10% since 1910 to 2015.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020, the Philippine Independent Church had around 1,458,992 adherents (1.4% of the Philippine population).[4] Aglipayans in the Philippines claim to number at least 6 to 8 million members, with most from the northern part of Luzon, especially in the Ilocos Region and in the parts of Visayas like Antique, Iloilo and Guimaras provinces. Congregations are also found throughout the Philippine diaspora in North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. The church is the second-largest single Christian denomination in the country after the Roman Catholic Church (some 80.2% of the population), comprising about 6.7% of the total population of the Philippines. It has 48 dioceses plus the dioceses outside the Philippines such as the Diocese of Tampa (USA) and the Diocese of Western USA, Western Canada, and Pacific Islands. It has Fellowship congregations in the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong and Singapore. IFI is in full communion with the Anglican Churches and The Episcopal Church.[21][22][23]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Baháʼí Faith in the Philippines started in 1921 with the first Baháʼí first visiting the Philippines that year,[64] and by 1944 a Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assembly was established.[65] In the early 1960s, during a period of accelerated growth, the community grew from 200 in 1960 to 1000 by 1962 and 2000 by 1963. In 1964 the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʼís of the Philippines was elected and by 1980 there were 64,000 Baháʼís and 45 local assemblies.[66] The Baháʼís have been active in multi/inter-faith developments. The 2010 World Christian Encyclopedia estimates the Philippines has the world's sixth largest population of Baháʼís, at just over 275,000.[67]\n\n\n\n### Judaism[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of the Jews in the Philippines\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mosque in Cotabato City\nIslam reached the Philippines in the 14th century with the arrival of Muslim traders from the Persian Gulf, Southern India, and their followers from several sultanate governments in Maritime Southeast Asia. Islam's predominance reached all the way to the shores of Manila Bay, home to several Muslim kingdoms. During the Spanish conquest, Islam had a rapid decline as the predominant monotheistic faith in the Philippines as a result of the introduction of Roman Catholicism by Spanish missionaries and via the Spanish Inquisition.[60] The southern Filipino tribes were among the few indigenous Filipino communities that resisted Spanish rule and conversions to Roman Catholicism. The vast majority of Muslims in Philippines follow Sunni Islam of Shafi and Ash'ari school of jurisprudence and Theology, with small Shia and Ahmadiyya minorities.[15] Islam is the oldest recorded monotheistic religion in the Philippines.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThey claimed that this violates the Philippine constitution's separation of Church and State clause. The named respondents were the Archbishop of Manila Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, El Shaddai Movement Leader Mike Velarde, Iglesia ni Cristo Executive Minister Eduardo V. Manalo and Jesus Is Lord Church Worldwide leader Eddie Villanueva. Manalo's Iglesia ni Cristo practices bloc voting. Former Catholic Archbishop Cardinal Jaime Sin had been instrumental in rallying support for the assumption to power of Corazon Aquino and Gloria Arroyo. Velarde supported Fidel V. Ramos, Joseph Estrada, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and Benigno Aquino III while Villanueva endorsed Fidel Ramos and Jose De Venecia.

Each possess their own set of belief systems and religious stories and narratives, mostly originating from beliefs held during the pre-Hispanic era, although many are also modern. Some of these beliefs have been influenced by Hinduism and Buddhism and were falsely regarded by the Spanish and American colonizers as \"myths\" and \"superstitions\" in an effort to de-legitimize the precolonial beliefs of Filipinos against Filipinos. Today, some of these native beliefs are still held by many Filipinos, both in urban and rural areas.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Redeeming Grace Christian Centre\n* The Salvation Army\n* Seventh-day Adventist Church\n* TEAM Ministries international\n* The Blessed Word International Church (Evangelical)\n* The United Methodist Church (Methodist)\n* Union Church Manila\n* Union Espiritista Cristiana de Filipinas (established on 1905)[50]\n* United Church of Christ in the Philippines (Congregationalist, Presbyterian, Disciples, United Brethren, Methodist).\n* United Evangelical Church of the Philippines\n* United Methodist Church[51]\n* Victory Christian Fellowship (Evangelical)\n* Vineyard Christian Fellowship (Evangelical)\n* Word for the World Christian Fellowship (Evangelical)\n* Word of Life World Mission Church (Pentecostal)\n* Words of Life Christian Ministries\n* His Life Ministries (Non-Denominational)\n* His Life City Church (Pentecostal)\n* City of God Celebration Church (Pentecostal)\n\n### The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Philippines\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** Anna T.

Following it were the United Church of Canada (including Methodists, Congregationalists and Presbyterians), with 2 million; the Anglican Church, with nearly 2 million; and the Presbyterian Church, with approximately 870,000. The Canada Year Book 1936 reported that \"of the non-Christian sects, 155,614 or 1.50% were Jews, 24,087 or 0.23% were Confucians, 15,784 or 0.15% were Buddhists and 5,008 or 0.05% were pagans.[58]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBefore the European colonization, a wide diversity of Indigenous religions and belief systems were largely animistic or shamanistic.[8] The French colonization beginning in the 16th century established a Roman Catholic francophone population in New France.[9] British colonization brought waves of Anglicans and other Protestants to Upper Canada, now Ontario.[10] The settlement of the West brought significant Eastern Orthodox immigrants from Eastern Europe and Mormon and Pentecostal immigrants from the United States.[11] The Jewish, Islamic, Jains, Sikh, Hindu, and Buddhist communities—although small—are as old as the nation itself.[12] Rates of religious adherence have steadily decreased since the 1970s.[5] After having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life,[13] Canada has become a post-Christian, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCanada as a nation is becoming increasingly religiously diverse, especially in large urban centres such as Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal, where minority groups and new immigrants who make up the growth in most religious groups congregate. Two significant trends become clear when the current religious landscape is examined closely. One is the loss of ‘secularized' Canadians as active and regular participants in the churches and denominations they grew up in, which were overwhelmingly Christian, while these churches remain a part of Canadians' cultural identity. The other is the increasing presence of ethnically diverse immigration within the religious makeup of the country.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe majority of Canadian Christians attend church services infrequently. Cross-national surveys of religiosity rates such as the Pew Global Attitudes Project indicate that, on average, Canadian Christians are less observant than those of the United States but are still more overtly religious than their counterparts in Western Europe. In 2002, 30% of Canadians reported to Pew researchers that religion was \"very important\" to them. A 2005 Gallup poll showed that 28% of Canadians consider religion to be \"very important\" (55% of Americans and 19% of Britons say the same).[81] Regional differences within Canada exist, however, with British Columbia and Quebec reporting especially low metrics of traditional religious observance, as well as a significant urban-rural divide, while Saskatchewan and rural Alberta saw high rates of religious attendance. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBuddhism populations| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1981  | 51,955 | —     |\n| 1991  | 163,415 | +214.5% |\n| 2001  | 300,345 | +83.8% |\n| 2011  | 366,830 | +22.1% |\n| 2021 | 356,975 | −2.7% |\n\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, Buddhism is followed by 1.1% of the population of the Canada.[156]\n\n\nBuddhism has been practised in Canada for more than a century and in recent years has grown dramatically.

The United Church of Canada, the country's largest Protestant denomination, became one of the most liberal major Protestant churches in the world. Flatt argues that in the 1960s Canada's rapid cultural changes led the United Church to end its evangelical programs and change its identity. It made revolutionary changes in its evangelistic campaigns, educational programs, moral stances, and theological image. However, membership declined sharply as the United Church affirmed a commitment to gay rights including marriage and ordination, and to the ordination of women.[64][65]\n\n\nIn 1971, Canada was 47% Catholic, 41% Protestant, 4% other religion and 4% unaffiliated.[66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** Raymond J.

When they began, one in ten Americans were members of congregations; by the time they ended, eight in ten were.[15] The aftermath led to what historian Martin Marty calls the \"Evangelical Empire\", a period in which evangelicals dominated U.S. cultural institutions. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMembers of the Druze faith face the difficulty of finding a Druze partner and practicing endogamy; marriage outside the Druze faith is strongly discouraged according to the Druze doctrine.

Majorities of white evangelical Protestants (79%), white mainline Protestants (67%), black Protestants (56%), Catholics (71%), and the religiously unaffiliated (62%) all agreed that religion was losing influence on American life; 53% of the total public said this was a bad thing, while just 10% see it as a good thing.[255]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The Catholic Church in the United States, 71,000,000 members[64]\n* The Southern Baptist Convention, 13,680,493 members[65]\n* The National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc., 8,415,100 members[66]\n* The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 6,920,086 members[67]\n* The United Methodist Church, 5,714,815 members[68]\n\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention, with over 13 million adherents, is the largest of more than 200[69] distinctly named Protestant denominations.[70] In 2007, members of evangelical churches comprised 26% of the American population, while another 18% belonged to mainline Protestant churches, and 7% belonged to historically black churches.[71]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nExpert researchers and authors have referred to the United States as a \"Protestant nation\" or \"founded on Protestant principles\",[43][44][45][46] specifically emphasizing its Calvinist heritage.[47][48]\n\n\nThe modern official motto of the United States of America, as established in a 1956 law signed by President Dwight D.

No rich country prays nearly as much as the U.S, and no country that prays as much as the U.S. is nearly as rich... Stubbornly pious Americans threw a wrench in the secularization thesis. Deep into the 20th century, more than nine in 10 Americans said they believed in God and belonged to an organized religion, with the great majority of them calling themselves Christian. That number held steady—through the sexual-revolution '60s, through the rootless and anxious '70s, and through the \"greed is good\" '80s. But in the early 1990s, the historical tether between American identity and faith snapped. Religious non-affiliation in the U.S. started to rise—and rise, and rise. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. **^** Froese, Paul; Uecker, Jeremy E.

Still, a small but growing minority of Americans describe themselves as spiritual but not religious, as figure 3.4 shows. In 1998, 9 percent of Americans described themselves as at least moderately spiritual but not more than slightly religious.
