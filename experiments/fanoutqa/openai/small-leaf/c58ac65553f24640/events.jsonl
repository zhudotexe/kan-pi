The president has the authority to nominate members of his Cabinet to the United States Senate for confirmation under the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution.\n\n\nBefore confirmation and during congressional hearings, a high-level career member of an executive department heads this pre-confirmed cabinet on an acting basis. The Cabinet's creation was part of the transition of power following the 2020 United States presidential election.\n\n\nIn addition to the 15 heads of executive departments, there are 10 Cabinet-level officials. Biden altered his cabinet structure, elevating the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers,[1] director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy[2] and ambassador to the United Nations as Cabinet-level positions.[3] Biden initially removed the director of the Central Intelligence Agency from his Cabinet, but reversed the move in July 2023.[4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConfirmations had occurred at the slowest pace of any presidential cabinet in modern history that resulted from delays in facilitating an orderly transition of power and passing the organizing resolution for governing an evenly split Senate following the 2020–2021 United States Senate run-off elections in Georgia; and the second impeachment of Donald Trump.[6] By March 2021, a pick-up in the first half of the month brought confirmations close to pace.[7] Biden is the first president since Ronald Reagan in 1981 to have all of his original Cabinet secretary nominees confirmed to their posts.[8]\n\n\nThis page documents the confirmation process for Cabinet nominees of Joe Biden's administration.

During President Abraham Lincoln's administration, Secretary of State William H. Seward advocated the use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet government. However, Lincoln rebuffed Seward. While a professor Woodrow Wilson also advocated a parliamentary-style Cabinet, but after becoming president did not implement it in his administration. In recent administrations, Cabinets have grown to include key White House staff in addition to department and various agency heads. President Ronald Reagan formed seven sub-cabinet councils to review many policy issues, and subsequent presidents have followed that practice.[3]\n\n\n\n## Federal law[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe president may designate additional positions to be members of the Cabinet, which can vary under each president. They are not in the line of succession and are not necessarily officers of the United States.[9]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Cabinet of the United States** is a body consisting of the vice president of the United States and the heads of the executive branch's departments in the federal government of the United States. It is the principal official advisory body to the president of the United States. The president chairs the meetings but is not formally a member of the Cabinet. The heads of departments, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, are members of the Cabinet, and acting department heads also participate in Cabinet meetings whether or not they have been officially nominated for Senate confirmation. The president may designate heads of other agencies and non-Senate-confirmed members of the Executive Office of the President as members of the Cabinet.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe heads of the executive departments and most other senior federal officers at cabinet or sub-cabinet level receive their salary under a fixed five-level pay plan known as the Executive Schedule, which is codified in Title 5 of the United States Code. Twenty-one positions, including the heads of the executive departments and others, receiving Level I pay are listed in 5 U.S.C. § 5312, and those forty-six positions on Level II pay (including the number two positions of the executive departments) are listed in 5 U.S.C. § 5313. As of January 2023[update], the Level I annual pay was set at $235,600.\n\n\nThe annual salary of the vice president is $235,300.[7] The salary level was set by the Government Salary Reform Act of 1989, which provides an automatic cost of living adjustment for federal employees. The vice president receives the same pension as other members of Congress based on their *ex officio* position as the president of the Senate.[8]\n\n\n\n## Current Cabinet and Cabinet-rank officials[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Cabinet does not have any collective executive powers or functions of its own, and no votes need to be taken. There are 25 members (26 including the vice president): 15 department heads and 10 Cabinet-level members, all of whom, except two, require Senate confirmation. The Cabinet meets with the president in a room adjacent to the Oval Office. The members sit in the order in which their respective department was created, with the earliest being closest to the president and the newest farthest away.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe members of the Cabinet serve at the pleasure of the president, who can dismiss them at any time without the approval of the Senate, as affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in *Myers v. United States* (1926) or downgrade their Cabinet membership status. Often it is legally possible for a Cabinet member to exercise certain powers over his or her own department against the president's wishes, but in practice this is highly unusual due to the threat of dismissal. The president also has the authority to organize the Cabinet, such as instituting committees. Like all federal public officials, Cabinet members are also subject to impeachment by the House of Representatives and trial in the Senate for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **(List of Elections)**\n |\n| Political parties\n* Democratic\n* Republican\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Third parties\n\t+ Libertarian\n\t+ Green\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* List of political parties\n |\n| Political ideologies\n* Conservatism\n\t+ history\n\t+ Black\n\t+ Neo-\n\t+ Paleo-\n\t+ Social\n\t+ Traditionalist\n* Liberalism\n\t+ Modern\n\t+ Progressivism\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Abolitionism\n* Constitutionalism\n* Environmentalism\n* Feminism\n* Libertarianism\n* Monarchism\n* Populism\n* Protectionism\n* Republicanism\n* Socialism\n\t+ Anarchism\n\t+ Individualist anarchism\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Political culture\n* Political polarization\n |\n| Federalism\n* **State and Territorial government**\n\n\n* Governors\n* Legislatures (list)\n* Courts\n\n\n* Local government\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* **District of Columbia Government**\n\n\n* District Council\n* Mayor\n* Superior Court\n |\n| Foreign relations\n* Department of State\n\n\n* Secretary of State: Antony Blinken\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Diplomatic missions of / in the United States\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Nationality law\n* Passports\n* Visa requirements\n* Visa policy\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Administrator of the Small Business Administration (1994–2001, 2012–present)\n* Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (1996–2001): Created as an independent agency in 1979, raised to Cabinet rank in 1996,[17] and dropped from Cabinet rank in 2001.[18]\n* Director of National Intelligence (2017–present)\n* Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (2017–2021, 2023–present)\n* Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (2021–present)\n\n\n## Proposed Cabinet departments[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Ambassador to the United Nations (1953–1989, 1993–2001, 2009–2018, 2021–present)\n* Director of the Office of Management and Budget (1953–1961, 1969–present)\n* White House Chief of Staff (1953–1961, 1974–1977, 1993–present)\n* Counselor to the President (1969–1977, 1981–1985, 1992–1993): A title used by high-ranking political advisers to the president of the United States and senior members of the Executive Office of the President since the Nixon administration.[11] Incumbents with Cabinet rank included Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Donald Rumsfeld, and Anne Armstrong.\n* White House Counsel (1974–1977)\n* United States Trade Representative (1975–present)\n* Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (1977–1981, 1993–2001, 2009–2017, 2021–present)\n* National Security Advisor (1977–1981)\n* Director of Central Intelligence (1981–1989, 1995–2001)[12][13][14]\n* Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (1993–present)\n* Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (1993–2009)[15][16]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Pierce, Olga (January 22, 2009). \"Who Runs Departments Before Heads Are Confirmed?\". *ProPublica*.

Washington's Cabinet consisted of five members: himself, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of War Henry Knox and Attorney General Edmund Randolph. Vice President John Adams was not included in Washington's Cabinet because the position was initially regarded as a legislative officer (president of the Senate).[4] Furthermore, until there was a vacancy in the presidency (which did not occur until the death of William Henry Harrison in 1841) it was not certain that a vice president would be allowed to serve as president for the duration of the original term as opposed to merely acting as president until new elections could be held. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)James K. Polk and his Cabinet in 1846: the first Cabinet to be photographed.\nThe tradition of the Cabinet arose out of the debates at the 1787 Constitutional Convention regarding whether the president would exercise executive authority solely or collaboratively with a cabinet of ministers or a privy council. As a result of the debates, the Constitution (Article II, Section 1, Clause 1) vests \"all executive power\" in the president singly, and authorizes—but does not compel—the president (Article II, Section 2, Clause 1) to \"require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices\".[2][3] The Constitution does not specify what the executive departments will be, how many there will be, or what their duties will be.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Small Business Administration, the Science Information Exchange program from the Smithsonian Institution, the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Office of Technology Utilization from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would also be included in the new Department.\n32. **^** \"Public Notes on 02-RMSP3\".

His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate by unanimous consent on January 20, 2009. Until his January 13, 2017 resignation[2] one week prior to the end of Obama's second term as president, he had been the only member of the U.S. Cabinet who had served since the day Obama originally took office. As of the end of that term[update] he was the fourth-longest-serving holder of the office.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nVilsack is a former member of the National Governors Association Executive Committee. He was chair of the Democratic Governors Association in 2004. He was also chair of the Governors Biotechnology Partnership, the Governors Ethanol Coalition, and the Midwest Governors Conference, and has also been chair and vice-chair of the National Governors Association's committee on Natural Resources, where he worked to develop the NGA's farm and energy policies.[18]\n\n\nVilsack was thought to be high on the list of potential running mates for Kerry in the 2004 presidential election.[19] In 2005, Vilsack established Heartland PAC, a political action committee aimed at electing Democratic governors. In the first report, he raised over half a million dollars. Vilsack left office in 2007; he did not seek a third term and was succeeded by Chet Culver.\n\n\n\n## 2008 U.S. presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tom Vilsack 2008 presidential campaign\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"Tom Vilsack for President\".

The edited tape had been posted online by conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart.[35] Vilsack expressed his \"deep regret\" to Sherrod in acting hastily.[36]\n\n\nOn January 24, 2012, Obama appointed Vilsack the designated survivor during the President's State of the Union address.[37]\n\n\n\n### Beef advocacy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **1994 election for Iowa State Senate, 49th District:**\n\n\n**Democratic Primary**[60]\n* Tom Vilsack (D), 99.9% – 1,201 votes\n* *scattering*, 0.1% – 1 vote\n\n**1994 General Election:[61]**\n* Tom Vilsack (D), 98.8% – 12,288 votes\n* *scattering*, 1.2% – 145 votes\n\n* \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic primary results[62]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Tom Vilsack**  | **59,130**  | **51.20**  |\n|  | Democratic | Mark McCormick\n | 55,950\n | 48.45\n |\n|  | Democratic | Write-ins\n | 410\n | 0.36\n |\n| Total votes\n | **115,490**  | **100.00**  |\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn November 30, 2006, Tom Vilsack became the second Democrat (after Mike Gravel) to officially announce intentions to run for the presidency in the 2008 election.

He vetoed portions of the bill that would have cut income taxes and eased business regulations. After a special session of the Iowa General Assembly on September 7, 2004, $100 million in state money was set aside to honor previously made commitments.

Proponents accused Becerra multiple times of writing biased descriptions that violated the law, which requires \"a true and impartial statement of the purpose\" of measures. In one of many unsuccessful lawsuits against Becerra, a state judge wrote that attorneys general have \"wide latitude\" in how they write ballot descriptions. Critics said the responsibility to write the ballot title and summary should be transferred to a different, non-partisan office.[72][73]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Health and Human Services (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Confirmation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Sacramento, California, on January 26, 1958,[2][3] Becerra is the son of working-class parents, Maria Teresa and Manuel Guerrero Becerra. His father was born in the U.S. and raised in Tijuana, Mexico, and his mother was from Guadalajara.[4][5][6] As a child, Becerra grew up in a one-room apartment with his three sisters.[7] He graduated in 1976 from C.K. McClatchy High School, located in the center of Sacramento.[8] He studied abroad at the University of Salamanca in Salamanca, Spain, from 1978 to 1979, before earning his Bachelor of Arts in economics from Stanford University in 1980, becoming the first person in his family to graduate from college.[9][10] He received his Juris Doctor from Stanford Law School in 1984, and was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1985.[11]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecerra won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 32% of the vote.[18] In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee Morry Waksberg, 58%–24%.[19] He won re-election to a second term in 1994 with 66%[20] of the vote. His district was renumbered as the 31st district after the 2000 census.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter redistricting, ahead of the 2012 elections, most of Becerra's old district became the 34th district. He defeated Republican Stephen Smith 85.6% to 14.4%.[21]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Elijah Cummings, Xavier Becerra, and Robert Matsui at a press conference on civil rights in 1997\n![](image)Tipper Gore, Becerra, and President Bill Clinton\nBecerra was a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, of which he served as chairman during the 105th Congress.[22]\n\n\nBecerra voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 because he \"wanted to see direct protections for responsible homeowners\" in the bill.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n2004 United States House of Representatives in California, District 31[106][107]\n| Primary election\n |\n| --- |\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Xavier Becerra (incumbent)**  | **26,308**  | **89.45**  |\n|  | Democratic | Mervin Leon Evans\n | 3,103\n | 10.55\n |\n| Total votes\n | **29,411**  | **100%**  |\n| General election\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Xavier Becerra (incumbent)**  | **89,363**  | **80.21**  |\n|  | Republican | Luis Vega\n | 22,048\n | 19.79\n |\n| Total votes\n | **111,411**  | **100%**  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecerra was on the shortlist of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for the vice presidential nomination in 2016.[44] Senator Tim Kaine was eventually chosen.\n\n\nDuring the presidential transition of Joe Biden in 2020, it was reported that Becerra was being considered for the Cabinet positions of Secretary of Homeland Security and Attorney General.[45]\n\n\n\n### 2020 U.S. Senate speculation[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2020, California Senator Kamala Harris was selected by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate. After Biden ultimately won the general election, Becerra was floated as a possible replacement for Harris, along with others such as Representative Karen Bass, Representative Barbara Lee, Secretary of State Alex Padilla (who was eventually chosen), and former Secretary of Labor Hilda Solís.[46][47][48] Early December reports that Biden planned to nominate Becerra as Secretary of Health and Human Services rendered such speculation moot.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** Wire, Sarah D.; Myers, John (December 1, 2016). \"Gov.

Her father was Julius Yellen (1906–1975), a family physician who worked from the ground floor of their house. Janet has an older brother, John (born 1942), who is a program director for archaeology at the National Science Foundation.[7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Solomon, Brian (January 6, 2014). \"She's Confirmed: Janet Yellen Is First Woman Federal Reserve Chair\". *Forbes*.

The pair struck up a close friendship and went on to write several academic papers together.[18] In 1977, Yellen took a job within the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors after failing to win tenure at Harvard; she was recruited as a staff economist for the Board of Governors by Edwin M. Truman, who had known her from Yale. Truman was a junior professor when he heard Yellen's oral exam and was then about to take over the Fed's Division of International Finance. She was assigned to research international monetary reform.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Biography at the United States Department of the Treasury\n* Biography at the Federal Reserve\n* Clinton White House biography (archived)\n* Expert profile at the Brookings Institution\n* Faculty profile at the Haas School of Business\n* Faculty profile at University of California, Berkeley\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\n* Appearances on C-SPAN ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Profile and papers at Research Papers in Economics\n* Janet Yellen collected news and commentary at *The Guardian* ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee unanimously approved Yellen's candidacy by a 26–0 vote on January 22, 2021.[129] The full U.S. Senate confirmed her nomination with a vote of 84–15 (with one abstention, Marco Rubio, R-FL)[130] on January 25.[131] With her oath of office administered by Vice President Harris the next day,[132] Yellen became the first female Secretary of the Treasury and the first person in American history to lead the three most powerful economic bodies in the federal government of the United States: the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, and the White House Council of Economic Advisers.[3][131]\n\n\nOnly two other women within the G7 nations – France's Christine Lagarde and Canada's Chrystia Freeland – have held positions analogous to Yellen's as Treasury Secretary.[133]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n#### Proposed international tax reform[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n177. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sillars, James (October 16, 2023). \"Janet Yellen: America can 'certainly' afford to support Israel and Ukraine, US Treasury secretary says\". *Sky News*.\n178. **^** Cassidy, John (October 8, 2013). \"A Janet Yellen Question: Just How Dovish Is She?\". *The New Yorker*.

Unlike her predecessors, she is viewed as more of an academic economist than a traditional politician used to horse-trading and dealmaking, qualities that could be critical to achieving the goals of Biden's economic agenda in a deeply partisan Congress.[125][126][127] All living former U.S. treasury secretaries, from George Shultz to Jack Lew, endorsed Yellen for the position in a bipartisan letter calling on the Senate to swiftly confirm her.[128]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n123. **^** Lane, Sylvan (November 30, 2020). \"Biden names Janet Yellen as his Treasury nominee\". *The Hill*.

After returning to academia, she resumed her teaching assignment at Haas and received a joint appointment with Berkeley's Department of Economics.[26] She was appointed the Eugene E. and Catherine M. Trefethen Professor of Business Administration and Professor of Economics in 1999[24] and remained an active faculty member until she was appointed president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in 2004.[27] Yellen was awarded the title of Professor Emeritus at UC Berkeley in 2006.[25]\n\n\nThroughout her career, Yellen served as an adviser to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Brookings Panel on Economic Activity, and the National Science Foundation's Panel in Economics. She was also a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research from 1999 to 2010.[25]\n\n\n\n### Contributions to economics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYellen and Akerlof have often collaborated on research, including topics such as poverty, unemployment and a paper on the costs of out-of-wedlock childbearing. One of their most discussed papers at Berkeley, on why lower wages sometimes lead to lower employment, came from the personal experience of hiring a nanny for the first time.[238] Yellen says Akerlof has been her biggest intellectual influence.[238] Both frequently state that their lone disagreement is that she is a bit more supportive of free trade than he is.[21][22]\n\n\nYellen has an estimated net worth of $20 million, accrued from stock holdings, speaking engagements, and various government and academic positions.[240] Upon taking office as U.S. Treasury Secretary, she divested her shares including those in Pfizer, ConocoPhillips, and AT&T, among others.[241]\n\n\nYellen inherited from her mother a collection of postage stamps worth between $15,000 and $50,000.[242][115] She doesn't collect them on her own.[243]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n75. **^** Zumbrun, Joshua (June 27, 2013). \"Yellen Betting Defies 100-Year Jinx of Fed No. 2 Never Elevated\". *Bloomberg News*.

Granholm was seen as one of Biden’s least controversial nominees, winning support from unions, environmental groups, and some Republicans.[121] University of California, Berkeley professor of energy Daniel Kammen, who worked with Granholm at UC Berkeley, said she will be \"phenomenal for DOE\" because \"she understands the technology, she understands deployment and she knows how to run a big agency.\"[122] She appeared before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on January 27, 2021, and the committee voted to advance her nomination in a 13–4 vote on February 3, 2021.[123] She was confirmed by the Senate 64–35 on February 25, 2021, and was sworn into office later that day by Vice President Kamala Harris.[124][125] She is the first secretary of energy born outside the United States.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1998, Granholm ran for attorney general of Michigan, defeating Republican nominee John Smietanka.

In 2004 she asked Lieutenant Governor John D. Cherry to lead the Commission on Higher Education and Economic Growth to double the number of college graduates in Michigan. Many of the commission's recommendations were enacted into law during Granholm's tenure as governor, e.g. increasing high school graduation standards (The Michigan Merit Curriculum) so that every Michigan high school student takes a college preparatory curriculum, which includes four years of math and English/language arts and three years of science and social studies, beginning with students who entered high school in the fall of 2006.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** Granholm, Jennifer. \"Governor's Letter\" (PDF).
