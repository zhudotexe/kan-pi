The outbreak led to lockdowns being announced in Kerala on 23 March 2020, and in the rest of the country on 25 March 2020. The infection rates started to drop in September 2020. India faced a devastating second wave of the pandemic in March 2021, with shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and other medical supplies in parts of the country.\n\nIndia initiated its vaccination program on 16 January 2021 with the AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield) and the indigenous Covaxin. Later, the Sputnik V and Moderna vaccines were also approved for emergency use.

On March 6, 2020, Trump allocated $8.3 billion to fight the outbreak and declared a national emergency on March 13. The government also purchased large quantities of medical equipment, invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950 to assist.[25] By mid-April, disaster declarations were made by all states and territories as they all had increasing cases. A second wave of infections began in June, following relaxed restrictions in several states, leading to daily cases surpassing 60,000. By mid-October, a third surge of cases began; there were over 200,000 new daily cases during parts of December 2020 and January 2021.[26][27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy May 27, less than four months after the pandemic reached the U.S., 100,000 Americans had died with COVID-19.[84] State economic reopenings and lack of widespread mask orders resulted in a sharp rise in cases across most of the continental U.S. outside of the Northeast.[85] A study conducted in May 2020 indicated that the true number of COVID-19 cases in the United States was much higher than the number of confirmed cases with some locations having 6\u201324 times higher infections, which was further confirmed by a later population-wide serosurvey.[86][87][88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThroughout March and early April, several state, city, and county governments imposed \"stay at home\" quarantines on their populations to stem the spread of the virus.[77] By March 26, *New York Times* data showed the United States to have the highest number of known cases of any country.[78] By March 27, the country had reported over 100,000 cases.[79] On April 2, at President Trump's direction, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and CDC ordered additional preventive guidelines to the long-term care facility industry.[80] On April 11, the U.S. death toll became the highest in the world when the number of deaths reached 20,000, surpassing that of Italy.[81] On April 19, the CMS added new regulations requiring nursing homes to inform residents, their families and representatives, of COVID-19 cases in their facilities.[82] On April 28, the total number of confirmed cases across the country surpassed 1\u00a0million.[83]\n\n\n\n### May to August 2020[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** Butcher, Lola (November 17, 2020). \"Pandemic puts all eyes on public health\". *Knowable Magazine*. doi:10.1146/knowable-111720-1.

The virus was confirmed to have spread to Brazil on 25 February 2020,[4] when a man from S\u00e3o Paulo who had traveled to Italy[5] tested positive for the virus. The disease had spread to every federative unit of Brazil by 21 March. On 19 June 2020, the country reported its one millionth case and nearly 49,000 reported deaths.[6][7] One estimate of under-reporting was 22.62% of total reported COVID-19 mortality in 2020.[8][9][10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 20 March, experts from Italy warned that the coronavirus growth curve in Brazil would repeat that of European countries. An observatory with physicists from USP, University of Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo State University, University of Bras\u00edlia, Federal University of ABC, UC Berkeley and the University of Oldenburg showed that the number of infected people, considering data from 19 March, had been doubling every 54 hours, and that the case total would exceed 3,000 by the 24th.[157][158]\n\n\nOn 21 March, researchers began to mobilize to increase the availability of testing in Brazil. The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro was attempting to create a serology test, as opposed to the more common PCR test, to detect infections through a patient's blood samples.[159]\nMinister of Health Luiz Henrique Mandetta said that the number of cases would increase exponentially until the end of June.[160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a variety of responses from federal, state and local governments, having an impact on politics, education, the environment,[11] and the economy. On 27 March 2020 Brazil announced a temporary ban on foreign air travelers[12] and most state governors have imposed quarantines to prevent the spread of the virus.[13] President Jair Bolsonaro has perpetuated conspiracy theories surrounding COVID-19 treatments[14] and its origins,[15] and was accused of downplaying effective mitigations and pursuing a strategy of herd immunity.[16] In October 2021, a congressional panel recommended criminal charges against the president for his handling of the pandemic, including crimes against humanity.[16]\n\n\nAs of 13 June 2024, Brazil, with 37,519,960[1] confirmed cases and 702,116[1] deaths, has the third-highest number of confirmed cases and second-highest death toll from COVID-19 in the world, behind only those of the United States and of India.\n\n\n\n\n## Timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 25 February, the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Brazil (and the first in South America) was announced by the Health Department of S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 a 61-year-old man who had returned from Lombardy, Italy.[28][29] A second case was confirmed soon after in another person who had recently returned from Italy.[30] On 28 February, scientists of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo's Tropical Medicine Institute and the Adolfo Lutz Institute reported that they had sequenced the genomes of these two cases, which had been separately introduced from Northern Italy to Brazil on two occasions.[31][32] In an address on 6 March, President Jair Bolsonaro advised residents to \"strictly follow the experts' recommendations as the best protective measure\", but that \"there is no reason to panic\".[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe virus had reached remote locations; a Yanomami teen died of it in Roraima.[51]\n* **14 April:** The Ministry of Health reported a total of 25,262 confirmed cases and 1,532 confirmed deaths. Over 14,000 people were declared recovered, although they were not confirmed virus-free, only discharged from a hospital or asymptomatic.[52]\n* **16 April:** President Bolsonaro fired the Minister of Health, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, over disagreements about social distancing guidelines.[53] He said he would appoint a health minister who favored reopening businesses \"as quickly as possible\".[54] Shortly afterwards, Nelson Teich was appointed to replace him.[55]\n* **20 April:** Several cities started to ease social isolation guidelines in favor of contact tracing. Some retail stores were allowed to open as long as customers wore masks, the number of in-person customers was reduced, and customer personal information was tracked.[*citation needed*]\n* **24 April:** Brazil confirmed more than fifty thousand cases.[56]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **27 November:** Two raw sewage samples collected independently on 27 November 2019 in Santa Catarina, Brazil, will later detect SARS-CoV-2 (100,000 copies per litre), 66 days in advance of the first COVID-19 confirmed case in the Americas. Subsequent samplings are positive on 11 December 2019 and 20 February 2020. These samples can show that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in Brazil at least as early as late November 2019.[18] However, this is highly contested by the scientific consensus which shows that the virus emerged in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Thus, it is highly unlikely that it was circulating in Brazil before early 2020.[19] Researchers from the Institute of Tropical Medicine and international colleagues showed in the scientific journal Science that the first sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil occurred between late February and early March 2020.[20]\n\n\n### 2020[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **3 August:** General Braga Netto, the chief of staff to President Bolsonaro, tests positive for COVID-19.[79]\n* **8 August:** Brazil reaches three million infections and 100,000 deaths.[80]\n* **25 August:** Senator Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, the eldest son of President Bolsonaro, tests positive for COVID-19.[81]\n\n\n#### September[edit]\n\n\n* **3 September:** Brazil reaches four million infections and about 125,000 deaths.[82]\n* **9 September:** A two month old child dies of COVID-19 in S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, possible the youngest death in the ABC Region.[83]\n\n\n#### October[edit]\n\n\n* **6 October:** Brazil reaches five million infections.[84]\n\n\n#### November[edit]\n\n\n* **20 November:** Brazil reaches six million infections.[85]\n\n\n#### December[edit]\n\n\n* **25 December:** Brazil reaches 190,000 deaths.[86]\n* **31 December:** Variant B117 is identified in S\u00e3o Paulo.[87]\n\n\n### 2021[edit]\n\n\n#### January[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** \"Brasil \u00e9 2\u00ba pa\u00eds com mais casos de coronav\u00edrus na alta c\u00fapula do governo\". *VEJA*.

The contagion rate was the same as that registered in Italy, as the number of infected people had been doubling every 54 hours. According to estimates, the number of confirmed cases might reach 3,000 by 24 March.[157] According to the Ministry of Health, the number of infected patients would grow exponentially until the end of June.[160] The mayor of Belo Horizonte, Alexandre Kalil (PSD), asked General Altair Jos\u00e9 Polsin, commander of the 4th Army Region, for the temporary assignment of 51 professionals from the army garrison to assist in the demands of fighting the coronavirus.

The Russian government has also taken measures to prevent foreign citizens from heavily affected countries from visiting Russia.[*citation needed*] Local governments have also responded to the pandemic by imposing their own preventive measures in their communities.\n\n\n\n### Lockdowns[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of federal subjects that have announced the \"self-isolation regime\".

The first cases were reported in Tyumen (Siberia) and Chita (Russian Far East) when two Chinese citizens tested positive for the virus. Early prevention measures included restricting the China-Russia border and extensive testing. The infection later spread from Italy to Russia, leading to additional measures such as cancelling events, closing schools, theatres, and museums, as well as implementing a non-working period that lasted until May 11, 2020. Lockdowns were imposed in various regions of Russia, including Moscow, by the end of March 2020. By the beginning of September 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases in Russia exceeded a million.",
