Therefore, none of these common variations of dice shapes are non-Platonic solids. \n\nHowever, there are other dice shapes that are not Platonic solids, such as:\n- **10-sided dice (Pentagonal trapezohedron)** - Not a Platonic solid\n\nSo, the 10-sided dice (Pentagonal trapezohedron) is a common variation of dice that is not a Platonic solid.",
