Thus the University of Paris assumed its basic form. It was composed of seven groups, the four nations of the faculty of arts, and the three superior faculties of theology, law, and medicine. Men who had studied at Paris became an increasing presence in the high ranks of the Church hierarchy; eventually, students at the University of Paris saw it as a right that they would be eligible to benefices. Church officials such as St. Louis and Clement IV lavishly praised the university.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOfficially chartered in 1200 by King Philip II of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was later often nicknamed after its theological College of Sorbonne, founded by Robert de Sorbon and chartered by King Louis IX around 1257.[1]\n\n\nHighly reputed internationally for its academic performance in the humanities ever since the Middle Ages – notably in theology and philosophy – it introduced several academic standards and traditions that have endured ever since and spread internationally, such as doctoral degrees and student nations. Notable popes, royalty, scientists, and intellectuals were educated at the University of Paris. A few of the colleges of the time are still visible close to the Panthéon and Jardin du Luxembourg: Collège des Bernardins (18 rue de Poissy, 5th arr.), Hôtel de Cluny (6 Place Paul Painlevé, 5th arr.), Collège Sainte-Barbe (4 rue Valette, 5th arr.), Collège d'Harcourt (44 Boulevard Saint-Michel, 6th arr.), and Cordeliers (21 rue École de Médecine, 6th arr.).[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe student revolts of the late 1960s were caused in part by the French government's failure to plan for a sudden explosion in the number of university students as a result of the postwar baby boom. The number of French university students skyrocketed from only 280,000 during the 1962–63 academic year to 500,000 in 1967–68, but at the start of the decade, there were only 16 public universities in the entire country. To accommodate this rapid growth, the government hastily developed bare-bones off-site faculties as annexes of existing universities (roughly equivalent to American satellite campuses). These faculties did not have university status of their own, and lacked academic traditions, amenities to support student life, or resident professors. One-third of all French university students ended up in these new faculties, and were ripe for radicalization as a result of being forced to pursue their studies in such shabby conditions.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** Marshall, p. xviii.\n16. **^** Readings, p. 136; Rotman, pp. 10–11; Pudal, p. 190.\n17. **^** Pudal, p. 190; Giles & Snyder, ed., p. 86.\n18. **^** Pudal, p. 191; Mathieu, p. 197; Giles & Snyder, ed., p. 86.\n19. **^** Readings, pp. 136–137.\n20. **^** Berstein, p. 229.\n21. **^** Berstein, p. 229; *loi no 68-978 du 12 novembre 1968*.\n22. **^** Conac, p. 177.\n23. **^** \"\" Sorbonne Université \" : Pierre-et-Marie-Curie et Paris-Sorbonne en route vers la fusion\". *Le Monde* (in French). 2017-01-20.

French students included princes of the blood, sons of the nobility, and ranking gentry. The courses at Paris were considered so necessary as a completion of studies that many foreigners flocked to them. Popes Celestine II, Adrian IV and Innocent III studied at Paris, and Alexander III sent his nephews there. Noted German and English students included Otto of Freisingen, Cardinal Conrad, Archbishop of Mainz, St. Thomas of Canterbury, and John of Salisbury; while Ste-Geneviève became practically the seminary for Denmark. The chroniclers of the time called Paris the city of letters par excellence, placing it above Athens, Alexandria, Rome, and other cities: \"At that time, there flourished at Paris philosophy and all branches of learning, and there the seven arts were studied and held in such esteem as they never were at Athens, Egypt, Rome, or elsewhere in the world.\" (\"Les gestes de Philippe-Auguste\"). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1150, the future University of Paris was a student-teacher corporation operating as an annex of the Notre-Dame cathedral school. The earliest historical reference to it is found in Matthew Paris' reference to the studies of his own teacher (an abbot of St. Albans) and his acceptance into \"the fellowship of the elect Masters\" there in about 1170,[4] and it is known that Lotario dei Conti di Segni, the future Pope Innocent III, completed his studies there in 1182 at the age of 21.\n\n\nThe corporation was formally recognised as an \"*Universitas*\" in an edict by King Philippe-Auguste in 1200: in it, among other accommodations granted to future students, he allowed the corporation to operate under ecclesiastic law which would be governed by the elders of the Notre-Dame Cathedral school, and assured all those completing courses there that they would be granted a diploma.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1966, after a student revolt in Paris, Christian Fouchet, minister of education, proposed \"the reorganisation of university studies into separate two- and four-year degrees, alongside the introduction of selective admission criteria\" as a response to overcrowding in lecture halls.[13] Dissatisfied with these educational reforms, students began protesting in November 1967, at the campus of the University of Paris in Nanterre;[14] indeed, according to James Marshall, these reforms were seen \"as the manifestations of the technocratic-capitalist state by some, and by others as attempts to destroy the liberal university\".[15] After student activists protested against the Vietnam War, the campus was closed by authorities on 22 March and again on 2 May 1968.[16] Agitation spread to the Sorbonne the next day, and many students were arrested in the following week.[17] Barricades were erected throughout the Latin Quarter, and a massive demonstration took place on 13 May, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIts patriotism was especially manifested on two occasions. During the captivity of King John, when Paris was given over to factions, the university sought to restore peace; and under Louis XIV, when the Spaniards crossed the Somme and threatened the capital, it placed two hundred men at the king's disposal and offered the Master of Arts degree gratuitously to scholars who should present certificates of service in the army (Jourdain, *Hist. de l'Univers. de Paris au XVIIe et XVIIIe siècle*, 132–34; *Archiv. du ministère de l'instruction publique*).\n\n\n\n### 1793: Abolition by the French Revolution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sorbonne as seen from *rue des Écoles*.\nThe ancient university disappeared with the ancien régime in the French Revolution. On 15 September 1793, petitioned by the Department of Paris and several departmental groups, the National Convention decided that independently of the primary schools, \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1793, during the French Revolution, the university was closed and, by Item 27 of the Revolutionary Convention, the college endowments and buildings were sold.[3] A new University of France replaced it in 1806 with four independent faculties: the Faculty of Humanities (French: *Faculté des Lettres*), the Faculty of Law (later including Economics), the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Theology (closed in 1885).\n\n\nIn 1970, following the civil unrest of May 1968, the university was divided into 13 autonomous universities.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe faculty and nation system of the University of Paris (along with that of the University of Bologna) became the model for all later medieval universities. Under the governance of the Church, students wore robes and shaved the tops of their heads in tonsure, to signify they were under the protection of the church. Students followed the rules and laws of the Church and were not subject to the king's laws or courts. This presented problems for the city of Paris, as students ran wild, and its official had to appeal to Church courts for justice. Students were often very young, entering the school at 13 or 14 years of age and staying for six to 12 years.\n\n\n\n### 12th century: Organisation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Map showing the territories covered by the four nations of the University of Paris during the Middle Ages.\nMain article: Nation (university)\n\nThe \"nations\" appeared in the second half of the twelfth century. They were mentioned in the Bull of Honorius III in 1222. Later, they formed a distinct body. By 1249, the four nations existed with their procurators, their rights (more or less well-defined), and their keen rivalries: the nations were the French, English, Normans, and Picards. After the Hundred Years' War, the English nation was replaced by the Germanic. The four nations constituted the faculty of arts or letters.\n\n\nThe territories covered by the four nations were:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)La Sorbonne\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Rue Saint-Jacques and the Sorbonne in Paris\nThe scattered condition of the scholars in Paris often made lodging difficult. Some students rented rooms from townspeople, who often exacted high rates while the students demanded lower. This tension between scholars and citizens would have developed into a sort of civil war if Robert de Courçon had not found the remedy of taxation. It was upheld in the Bull of Gregory IX of 1231, but with an important modification: its exercise was to be shared with the citizens. The aim was to offer the students a shelter where they would fear neither annoyance from the owners nor the dangers of the world. Thus were founded the colleges (colligere, to assemble); meaning not centers of instruction, but simple student boarding-houses. Each had a special goal, being established for students of the same nationality or the same science. Often, masters lived in each college and oversaw its activities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe pope authorized Pierre Le Mangeur to collect a moderate fee for the conferring of the license of professorship. Also, for the first time, the scholars had to pay tuition fees for their education: two sous weekly, to be deposited in the common fund.\n\n\n\n#### Rector[edit]\n\n\nThe university was organized as follows: at the head of the teaching body was a rector. The office was elective and of short duration; at first it was limited to four or six weeks. Simon de Brion, legate of the Holy See in France, realizing that such frequent changes caused serious inconvenience, decided that the rectorate should last three months, and this rule was observed for three years. Then the term was lengthened to one, two, and sometimes three years. The right of election belonged to the procurators of the four nations. Henry of Unna was proctor of the University of Paris in the 14th century, beginning his term on January 13, 1340.\n\n\n\n#### Four \"nations\"[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1229, a denial of justice by the queen led to suspension of the courses. The pope intervened with a bull that began with lavish praise of the university: \"Paris\", said Gregory IX, \"mother of the sciences, is another Cariath-Sepher, city of letters\". He commissioned the Bishops of Le Mans and Senlis and the Archdeacon of Châlons to negotiate with the French Court for the restoration of the university, but by the end of 1230 they had accomplished nothing. Gregory IX then addressed a Bull of 1231 to the masters and scholars of Paris. Not only did he settle the dispute, he empowered the university to frame statutes concerning the discipline of the schools, the method of instruction, the defence of theses, the costume of the professors, and the obsequies of masters and students (expanding upon Robert de Courçon's statutes). Most importantly, the pope granted the university the right to suspend its courses, if justice were denied it, until it should receive full satisfaction.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Hundred Years' War was fatal to these establishments, but the university set about remedying the injury.\n\n\nBesides its teaching, the University of Paris played an important part in several disputes: in the Church, during the Great Schism; in the councils, in dealing with heresies and divisions; in the State, during national crises. Under the domination of England it played a role in the trial of Joan of Arc.\n\n\nProud of its rights and privileges, the University of Paris fought energetically to maintain them, hence the long struggle against the mendicant orders on academic as well as on religious grounds. Hence also the shorter conflict against the Jesuits, who claimed by word and action a share in its teaching. It made extensive use of its right to decide administratively according to occasion and necessity. In some instances it openly endorsed the censures of the faculty of theology and pronounced condemnation in its own name, as in the case of the Flagellants.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Picard nation: the Romance-speaking bishoprics of Beauvais, Noyon, Amiens, Laon, and Arras; the bilingual (Romance and Germanic-speaking) bishoprics of Thérouanne, Cambrai, and Tournai; a large part of the bilingual bishopric of Liège; and the southernmost part of the Germanic-speaking bishopric of Utrecht (the part of that bishopric located south of the river Meuse; the rest of the bishopric north of the Meuse belonged to the English nation). It was estimated that about half of the students in the Picard nation were Romance-speakers (Picard and Walloon), and the other half were Germanic-speakers (West Flemish, East Flemish, Brabantian and Limburgish dialects).[9]\n\n\n#### Faculties[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Faculty of Law of Paris\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe chancellor of Ste-Geneviève continued to give degrees in arts, something he would have ceased if his abbey had no part in the university organization.\n\n\n\n### 13th–14th century: Expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Meeting of doctors at the University of Paris. From a 16th-century miniature.\nIn 1200, King Philip II issued a diploma \"for the security of the scholars of Paris,\" which affirmed that students were subject only to ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The provost and other officers were forbidden to arrest a student for any offence, unless to transfer him to ecclesiastical authority. The king's officers could not intervene with any member unless having a mandate from an ecclesiastical authority. His action followed a violent incident between students and officers outside the city walls at a pub.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe three schools: Notre-Dame, Sainte-Geneviève, and Saint-Victor, may be regarded as the triple cradle of the *Universitas scholarium*, which included masters and students; hence the name *University*. Henry Denifle and some others hold that this honour is exclusive to the school of Notre-Dame (Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis), but the reasons do not seem convincing. He excludes Saint-Victor because, at the request of the abbot and the religious of Saint-Victor, Gregory IX in 1237 authorized them to resume the interrupted teaching of theology. But the university was largely founded about 1208, as is shown by a Bull of Innocent III. Consequently, the schools of Saint-Victor might well have contributed to its formation. Secondly, Denifle excludes the schools of Ste-Geneviève because there had been no interruption in the teaching of the liberal arts. This is debatable and through the period, theology was taught. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe university was re-established by Napoleon on 1 May 1806. All the faculties were replaced by a single centre, the University of France. The decree of 17 March 1808 created five distinct faculties: Law, Medicine, Letters/Humanities, Sciences, and Theology; traditionally, Letters and Sciences had been grouped together into one faculty, that of \"Arts\". After a century, people recognized that the new system was less favourable to study. The defeat of 1870 at the hands of Prussia was partially blamed on the growth of the superiority of the German university system of the 19th century, and led to another serious reform of the French university. In the 1880s, the \"licence\" (bachelor) degree is divided into, for the Faculty of Letters: Letters, Philosophy, History, Modern Languages, with French, Latin and Greek being requirements for all of them; and for the Faculty of Science, into: Mathematics, Physical Sciences and Natural Sciences; the Faculty of Theology is abolished by the Republic. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"M.

The decline of royalty brought about the decline of the first. The other two were ancient but did not have much visibility in the early centuries. The glory of the palatine school doubtless eclipsed theirs, until it completely gave way to them. These two centres were much frequented and many of their masters were esteemed for their learning. The first renowned professor at the school of Ste-Geneviève was Hubold, who lived in the tenth century. Not content with the courses at Liège, he continued his studies at Paris, entered or allied himself with the chapter of Ste-Geneviève, and attracted many pupils via his teaching. Distinguished professors from the school of Notre-Dame in the eleventh century include Lambert, disciple of Fulbert of Chartres; Drogo of Paris; Manegold of Germany; and Anselm of Laon. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26.

The diocese and the abbey or chapter, through their chancellor, gave professorial investiture in their respective territories where they had jurisdiction. Besides Notre-Dame, Ste-Geneviève, and Saint-Victor, there were several schools on the \"Island\" and on the \"Mount\". \"Whoever\", says Crevier \"had the right to teach might open a school where he pleased, provided it was not in the vicinity of a principal school.\" Thus a certain Adam, who was of English origin, kept his \"near the Petit Pont\"; another Adam, Parisian by birth, \"taught at the Grand Pont which is called the Pont-au-Change\" (*Hist. de l'Univers. de Paris,* I, 272).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Old Sorbonne on fire in 1670.\n![](image)The Sorbonne, Paris, in a 17th-century engraving\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPoets extolled the university in their verses, comparing it to all that was greatest, noblest, and most valuable in the world.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sorbonne covered by snow.\nTo allow poor students to study the first college des dix-Huit was founded by a knight returning from Jerusalem called Josse of London for 18 scholars who received lodgings and 12 pence or denarii a month.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the fifteenth century, Guillaume d'Estouteville, a cardinal and Apostolic legate, reformed the university, correcting its perceived abuses and introducing various modifications. This reform was less an innovation than a recall to observance of the old rules, as was the reform of 1600, undertaken by the royal government with regard to the three higher faculties. Nonetheless, and as to the faculty of arts, the reform of 1600 introduced the study of Greek, of French poets and orators, and of additional classical figures like Hesiod, Plato, Demosthenes, Cicero, Virgil, and Sallust. The prohibition from teaching civil law was never well observed at Paris, but in 1679 Louis XIV officially authorized the teaching of civil law in the faculty of decretals. The \"faculty of law\" hence replaced the \"faculty of decretals\".

It was founded in 1218 by King Alfonso IX. It is the oldest university in the Hispanic world and one of the oldest in the world in continuous operation. It has over 30,000 students from 50 different nationalities.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The university was founded as a *studium generale* by the Leonese king Alfonso IX in 1218 as the *scholas Salamanticae*, with the actual creation of the university (or the transformation of the existing school into the university) occurring between August 1218 and the following winter.[1] A further royal charter from King Alfonso X, dated 8 May 1254, established rules for the organisation and financial endowment of the university, and referred to it for the first time by that name.[10] A papal bull of Alexander IV in 1255 confirmed the Royal Charter of Alfonso X and granted universal recognition to the university's degrees.[11]\n\n\nThe historical phrases *Quod natura non dat, Salmantica non praestat* (what nature does not give, Salamanca does not lend, in Latin) and *Multos et doctissimos Salmantica habet* (many and very versed Salamanca has) give an idea of the prestige the institution rapidly acquired.[12][*failed verification*]\n\n\nIn the reign of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, the Spanish government was revamped. Contemporary with the Spanish Inquisition, the expulsion of the Jews and Muslims, and the conquest of Granada, there was a certain professionalization of the apparatus of the state. This involved the massive employment of \"letrados\", i.e., bureaucrats and lawyers, who were \"licenciados\" (university graduates), particularly, of Salamanca, and the newly founded University of Alcalá. These men staffed the various councils of state, including, eventually, the Consejo de Indias and Casa de Contratacion, the two highest bodies in metropolitan Spain for the government of the Spanish Empire in the New World.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWhile Columbus was lobbying the King and Queen for a contract to seek out a western route to the Indies, he made his case to a council of geographers at the University of Salamanca. While the geographers were skeptical of Columbus and his voyage calculations, the University of Salamanca always defended the theory of unknown territories to the west, and supported Columbus' voyage, believing that new territories may be discovered. In the next century, the morality and laws of colonization in the Indies were debated by the School of Salamanca, along with the development of the study of science, geography and cartography of the Americas, and as well as the study of general subjects of economics, philosophy and theology.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nLike Oxford and Cambridge, Salamanca had a number of colleges (*Colegios Mayores*). These were founded as charitable institutions to enable poor scholars to attend the university. By the eighteenth century they had become closed corporations controlled by the families of their founders, and dominated the university between them. Most were destroyed by Napoleon's troops. In the 19th century, the Spanish government dissolved the university's faculties of canon law and theology. They were later reestablished in the 1940s as part of the Pontifical University of Salamanca.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Related affairs[edit]\n\n\nThe faculty renovated the theology department, laid the foundation for modern-day law, international law, modern economic science and actively participated in the Council of Trent. The school's mathematicians studied the calendar reform, commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII and proposed the solution that was later implemented. By 1580, 6,500 new students had arrived at Salamanca each year, amongst the graduates were state officials of the Spanish monarchy administration. It was also during this period when the first female university students were probably admitted, Beatriz Galindo and Luisa de Medrano, the latter probably being the first woman ever to give classes at a university.[13]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Sorcery[edit]\n\n\nIn popular belief, the university was associated with sorcery. A certain cave in Salamanca was considered the site of a school of black magic. In Spanish, Salamanca may mean \"cave\", \"an evil iguana\" and \"hand trick\"[14] and the *salamanquesa* (*Tarentola mauritanica*, the Spanish name is also derived from \"salamander\") is a reptile with magical attributes in Spanish tradition.[15]\nIn Romanian folklore, the devil runs a school of black magic named *Scholomance*.\n\n\nThe name is derived from \"Salamanca\" and the wise king \"Solomon\".[16][17]\n\n\n\n## Present day[edit]\n\n\nSalamanca draws undergraduate and graduate students from across Spain and the world; it is the top-ranked university in Spain based on the number of students coming from other regions.[18] It is also known for its Spanish courses for non-native speakers, which attract more than two thousand foreign students each year.[19]\n\n\nToday, the University of Salamanca is an important center for the study of humanities and is particularly noted for its language studies, as well as in laws and economics. Scientific research is carried out in the university and research centers associated with it, such as at the Centro de Investigación del Cáncer [Cancer Research Centre],[20] Instituto de Neurociencias de Castilla y León or INCyL [Institute of Neuroscience of Castile and León],[21] Centro de Láseres Pulsados Ultracortos Ultraintensos [Ultrashort Ultraintense Pulse Lasers Centre]. It is one of only two Hispanophone universities in the world that have a MoU with the United Nations to train language professionals for the organization.[22] In conjunction with the University of Cambridge, the University of Salamanca co-founded the Association of Language Testers in Europe (ALTE) in 1989.\n\n\nIn 2018, the institution celebrated its eighth centennial.[23]\n\n\n\n## Library[edit]\n\n\nThe library holds about 906,000 volumes.[24]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n### Notable staff[edit]\n\n\n* Juan de Galavís, professor of theology; later became Archbishop of Santo Domingo and Archbishop of Bogotá\n* Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola, professor of Philosophy of Law and Natural Law\n* Enrique Gil Robles, professor of Natural Law\n* Paul Nuñez Coronel (d.1534), professor of Hebrew\n* Miguel de Unamuno, writer\n* Beatriz Galindo, (d. 1534), professor of Latin and rhetoric\n* Luisa de Medrano (d. 1527) professor of Latin.

All students are members of a college.[15] It does not have a main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford consists of lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further tutorials provided by the central university faculties and departments.

This role incorporates student discipline and complaints, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings.[85] The university's professors are collectively referred to as the Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford. They are particularly influential in the running of the university's graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the Chichele Professorships and the Drummond Professor of Political Economy. \n\n\nThe University of Oxford is only a \"public university\" in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a \"private university\" in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.[86]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colleges of the University of Oxford\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"The University as a charity\". *University of Oxford*.

Founded in 1088 by an organised guild of students (*studiorum*), it is the oldest university in continuous operation in the world, and the first degree-awarding institution of higher learning. At its foundation, the word *universitas* was first coined.[3][4] The university's emblem carries the motto, *Alma Mater Studiorum* (\"Nourishing mother of studies\"), the date *A.D. 1088*.[5] With over 90,000 students, the University of Bologna is one of the largest universities in Europe. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** \"Campuses and Structures\".

The university was granted a charter (*Authentica habita*) by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158, but in the 19th century, a committee of historians led by Giosuè Carducci traced the founding of the university back to 1088, which would make it the oldest continuously operating university in the world.[11][12][13] However, the development of the institution at Bologna into a university was a gradual process. Paul Grendler writes that \"it is not likely that enough instruction and organization existed to merit the term *university* before the 1150s, and it might not have happened before the 1180s.\"[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** *Charters of foundation and early documents of the universities of the Coimbra Group*, Hermans, Jos.

The University of Bologna has had a central role in the sciences during the medieval age and the Italian renaissance, where it housed and educated Nicholas Copernicus as well as numerous other renaissance mathematicians.[6] It has educated a wide range of notable alumni, amongst them a large number of Italian scientists, prime ministers, supreme court judges, and priests.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe university arose around mutual aid societies (known as *universitates scholarium*) of foreign students called \"nations\" (as they were grouped by nationality) for protection against city laws which imposed collective punishment on foreigners for the crimes and debts of their countrymen. These students then hired scholars from the city's pre-existing lay and ecclesiastical schools to teach them subjects such as liberal arts, notarial law, theology, and *ars dictaminis* (scrivenery).[15] The lectures were given in informal schools called *scholae*. In time the various *universitates scholarium* decided to form a larger association, or *Studium*—thus, the university. The *Studium* grew to have a strong position of collective bargaining with the city, since by then it derived significant revenue through visiting foreign students, who would depart if they were not well treated. The foreign students in Bologna received greater rights, and collective punishment was ended. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"Ulisse Aldrovandi | Italian naturalist\". *Encyclopedia Britannica*.

However 11 other courses have maintained the previous rules of \"*Laurea specialistica a ciclo unico*\" or \"*Laurea magistrale a ciclo unico*\", with only one cycle of study of five years, except for medicine and dentistry, which require six years of courses. After the \"*Laurea*\" one may attain first-level Master (one-year diploma, similar to a postgraduate diploma). After second-level degrees are attained, one may proceed to second-level Master, specialisation schools (residency) or research doctorates (PhD).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the early 1950s, some students of the University of Bologna were among the founders of the review \"il Mulino\". On 25 April 1951 the first issue of the review was published in Bologna.[36] In a short time, \"il Mulino\" became one of the most interesting reference points in Italy for the political and cultural debate and established important editorial relationships in Italy and abroad. Editorial activities evolved along with the review. In 1954, the il Mulino publishing house (It. *Società editrice il Mulino*) was founded, which today represents one of the most relevant Italian publishers. In addition to this were initiated research projects (focusing mostly on the educational institutions and the political system in Italy), that eventually led, in 1964, to the establishment of the Istituto Carlo Cattaneo.\n\n\n\n### Collegio Superiore[edit]\n\n\nThe *Collegio Superiore* is an excellence institution inside the University of Bologna, aimed at promoting students' merit through dedicated learning programmes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Venice IUAV\n* Vercelli\n |\n| Private | * Benevento Giustino Fortunato\n* Bra Gastronomic Sciences\n* Casamassima LUM\n* Castellanza\n* Milan Bocconi\n* Milan Cattolica del Sacro Cuore\n* Milan Humanitas\n* Milan IULM\n* Milan San Raffaele\n* Naples Benincasa\n* Naples Pegaso\n* Reggio Calabria Dante Alighieri\n* Rome Biomedical\n* Rome Guglielmo Marconi\n* Rome International Studies\n* Rome Link Campus\n* Rome LUISS\n* Rome Maria SS.

Women were first admitted to the institution in the 1940s.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost students at al-Qarawiyyin range are between 13 and 30 years old, and study towards high school-level diplomas and university-level bachelor's degrees, although Muslims with a sufficiently high level of Arabic can attend lecture circles on an informal basis, given the traditional category of visitors \"in search of [religious and legal] knowledge\" (\"zuwwaar li'l-talab fii 'ilm\"). In addition to being Muslim, prospective students of al-Qarawiyyin are required to have fully memorized the Quran, as well as other shorter medieval Islamic texts on grammar and *Maliki* law, and to be proficient in classical Arabic.[56][58]\n\n\n\n## Architecture of the mosque[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> This is considerably later than the beginning of instruction at the al-Azhar under the Fatimids. So it is very difficult to sustain the claim that the University of Qarawiyyin is the \"oldest university\", and not only in the Muslim world! The mosque school or college did not assume the name of university until 1960 when in a ceremony Muhammad V invested it with that dignified title.[107]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nA number of well-known philosophers, scholars, and politicians in the history of Morocco and the western Mediterranean have either studied or taught at the Qarawiyyin since its founding.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome scholars consider that al-Qarawiyyin operated essentially as an Islamic madrasa until after World War II.[6][3][7][8][9] These scholars date al-Qarawiyyin's transformation into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963.[3][1][2] In the wake of these reforms, al-Qarawiyyin was officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" two years later.[1] Organization at the pre-modern al-Qarawiyyin differed from European universities and other Muslim institutions at al-Azhar (in Cairo) and al-Zaytouna (in Tunis) in that there was no defined scholastic year, registration was not imposed, study durations were not fixed, and there was no examination to ratify studies.[30] Students were expected to attend courses for a minimum of five years and would receive an *ijazah* if they were proven to have reached a high level of expertise.[22]: 457[30][102][43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The main entrance to the library and other southern annexes of the mosque today, off Place SeffarineIn 1947 al-Qarawiyyin was integrated into the state educational system,[7] and women were first admitted to study there during the 1940s.[15] In 1963, after Moroccan independence, al-Qarawiyyin was officially transformed by royal decree into a university under the supervision of the ministry of education.[1][53][2] Classes at the old mosque ceased and a new campus was established at a former French Army barracks.[1] While the dean took his seat at Fez, four faculties were founded in and outside the city: a faculty of Islamic law in Fez, a faculty of Arab studies in Marrakech, and two faculties of theology in Tétouan and near Agadir. Modern curricula and textbooks were introduced and the professional training of the teachers improved.[1][54] Following the reforms, al-Qarawiyyin was officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" in 1965.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Arabic name of the university, جَامِعَةُ الْقَرَوِيِّينَ pronounced [ʒaːmiʕtu lqarawijiːn] means \"University of the People from Kairouan (القَيْرَوَان [alqajrawaːn])\". Factors such as the provenance of Fatima al-Fihriya's family in Tunisia,[16] the presence of the letter *Qāf* (ق) – a voiceless uvular plosive which has no equivalent in European languages – the ويّي ([awijiː]) triphthong in the university's name, and the French colonization of Morocco have resulted in a number of different orthographies for the romanization of the university's name, including *al-Qarawiyyin*, a standard anglicization; *Al Quaraouiyine*, following French orthography; and *Al-Karaouine*, another rendering using French orthography.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Qarawiyyin Mosque on the skyline of central Fes el-Bali: the green-tiled roofs of the prayer hall and the minaret (white tower on the left) are visible.\n### Foundation of the mosque[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nScholars consider al-Qarawiyyin to have been effectively run as a madrasa until after World War II.[6][3][7][8][9] Many scholars distinguish this status from the status of \"university\", which they view as a distinctly European invention.[10][11] They date al-Qarawiyyin's transformation from a madrasa into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963.[1][2][3] Some sources, such as UNESCO and the *Guinness World Records*, have cited al-Qarawiyyin as the oldest university or oldest continually operating higher learning institution in the world.[12][13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Scholar at the Al-Qarawiyyin library\nEducation at al-Qarawiyyin University concentrates on the Islamic religious and legal sciences with a heavy emphasis on, and particular strengths in, Classical Arabic grammar/linguistics and Maliki law, though some lessons on other non-Islamic subjects such as French and English are also offered to students.[56][57] Teaching is delivered with students seated in a semi-circle around a sheikh, who prompts them to read sections of a particular text; asks them questions on particular points of grammar, law, or interpretation; and explains difficult points. Students from Morocco and Islamic West Africa attend al-Qarawiyyin, though some come from Muslim Central Asia. Spanish Muslim converts frequently attend the institution, largely attracted by the fact that the sheikhs of al-Qarawiyyin, and Islamic scholarship in Morocco in general, are heirs to the rich, religious, and scholarly heritage of Muslim al-Andalus.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** Hardaker, Glenn; Ahmad Sabki, A'ishah (2012). \"An insight into Islamic pedagogy at the University of al-Qarawiyyin\". *Multicultural Education & Technology Journal*. **6** (2): 106–110. doi:10.1108/17504971211236308.\n84. **^** Gathiram, Prem; Hänninen, Osmo (2014). \"Medicine and medical sciences in Africa\". *Pathophysiology*. **21** (2): 129–133. doi:10.1016/j.pathophys.2013.11.003.

This system of basic education called al-ta'lim al-aSil was funded by the sultans of Morocco and many famous traditional families. After independence, al-qarawiyin maintained its reputation, but it seemed important to transform it into a university that would prepare graduates for a modern country while maintaining an emphasis on Islamic studies. Hence, al-qarawiyin university was founded in February 1963 and, while the dean's residence was kept in Fès, the new university initially had four colleges located in major regions of the country known for their religious influences and madrasas. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> As for the nature of its curriculum, it was typical of other major madrasahs such as al-Azhar and Al Qarawiyyin, though many of the texts used at the institution came from Muslim Spain [...] Al-Qarawiyyin began its life as a small mosque constructed in 859 C.E. by means of an endowment bequeathed by a wealthy woman of much piety, Fatima bint Muhammed al-Fahri.\n> \n>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Shillington, Kevin: *Encyclopedia of African History*, Vol. 2, Fitzroy Dearborn, 2005, ISBN 978-1-57958-245-6, p. 1025: \n> Higher education has always been an integral part of Morocco, going back to the ninth century when the Karaouine Mosque was established.

The strength of its teaching stagnated and its curriculum decreased in range and scope, becoming focused on traditional Islamic sciences and Arabic linguistic studies. Even some traditional Islamic specializations like *tafsir* (Quranic exegesis) were progressively neglected or abandoned.[1][30] In 1788–89, the Alaouite sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah introduced reforms that regulated the institution's program, but also imposed stricter limits and excluded logic, philosophy, and the more radical Sufi texts from the curriculum.[26][30][50] Other subjects also disappeared over time, such as astronomy and medicine.[30] In 1845 Sultan Abd al-Rahman carried out further reforms, but it is unclear if this had any significant long-term effects.[1][30] Between 1830 and 1906 the number of faculty decreased from 425 to 266 (of which, among the latter, only 101 were still teaching).[1]: 71\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** Park, Thomas K.; Boum, Aomar: *Historical Dictionary of Morocco*, 2nd ed., Scarecrow Press, 2006, ISBN 978-0-8108-5341-6, p. 348\n55. **^** Tazi, Abdelhadi (2000). *جامع القرويين* [*The al-Qarawiyyin Mosque*] (in Arabic).

(Based on an early 20th-century survey; since then the southern part of the complex, the library, has been modified.)Al-Qarawiyyin Mosque was founded in the 9th century, but its present form is the result of a long historical evolution over the course of more than 1,000 years. Successive dynasties expanded the mosque until it became the largest in Africa, with a capacity of 22,000 worshipers.[59] The present-day mosque covers an extensive area of about half a hectare.[34]: 136 Broadly speaking, it consists of a large hypostyle interior space for prayers (the prayer hall), a courtyard with fountains (the *sahn*), a minaret at the courtyard's western end, and a number of annexes around the mosque itself.\n\n\n### Historical evolution[edit]\n\n\n#### Early history (9th–10th centuries)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe first of these was the Saffarin Madrasa in 1271, followed by al-Attarine in 1323, and the Mesbahiya Madrasa in 1346.[35] A larger but much later madrasa, the Cherratine Madrasa, was also built nearby in 1670.[36] These madrasas taught their own courses and sometimes became well-known institutions, but they usually had narrower curricula or specializations.[34]: 141[37] One of their most important functions seems to have been to provide housing for students from other towns and cities – many of them poor – who needed a place to stay while studying at al-Qarawiyyin.[38]: 137[34]: 110[22]: 463 Thus, these buildings acted as complimentary or auxiliary institutions to al-Qarawiyyin itself, which remained the center of intellectual life in the city.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStudents were male, but traditionally it has been said that \"facilities were at times provided for interested women to listen to the discourse while accommodated in a special gallery (*riwaq*) overlooking the scholars' circle\".[26] The 12th-century cartographer Mohammed al-Idrisi, whose maps aided European exploration during the Renaissance, is said to have lived in Fez for some time, suggesting that he may have worked or studied at al-Qarawiyyin. The institution has produced numerous scholars who have strongly influenced the intellectual and academic history of the Muslim world. Among them are Ibn Rushayd al-Sabti (d. 1321), Mohammed Ibn al-Hajj al-Abdari al-Fasi (d. 1336), Abu Imran al-Fasi (d. 1015) – a leading theorist of the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, and Leo Africanus. Pioneer scholars such as Muhammad al-Idrissi (d.1166 AD), Ibn al-Arabi (1165–1240 AD), Ibn Khaldun (1332–1395 AD), Ibn al-Khatib (d. 1374), Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji (Alpetragius) (d. 1294), and Ali ibn Hirzihim (d. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nView into the modern reading room (قاعة المطالعة) of the Qarawiyyin library\n\nBehind the southern wall of the mosque and east of the *mihrab* axis is the historic library of the mosque and university.[5] It is sometimes cited as the world's oldest library that remains open.[34]: 147[76][77] The first purpose-built library structure was added to the mosque by the Marinid sultan Abu Inan Faris in 1349 CE, though it was located at the mosque's northeastern corner instead of to the south.[78][5] The first structure still exists embedded near the women's section of the mosque, and consists of a square chamber measuring 5.4 meters per side. Its entrance is covered by a wooden screen from the Marinid period which features an inscription carved in cursive Arabic above the doorway recording Abu Inan's foundation of the library.[5]: 64\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n82. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Pallavicini, Yahya Sergio Yahe (2009), \"Islamic Knowledge in Italy\", in Aslan, Ednan (ed.), *Islamic Education in Europe*, Wiener islamisch-religionspädagogische Studien, vol. 1, Böhlau Verlag Wien, pp. 220–221, ISBN 978-3-205-78310-7, The Muslim community maintained, favoured, and organized the institutions for higher education that became the new centres for the diffusion of Islamic knowledge. These centres were places where teachers and students of that time would meet and also where all intellectuals would gather and take part in extremely important scientific debates. It is not a coincidence that around the 9th century the first university in the world, the Qarawiyyin University in Fez, was established in the Muslim world followed by az-Zaytuna in Tunis and Al-Azhar in Cairo. The university model, which in the West was widespread starting only from the 12th century, had an extraordinary fortune and was spread throughout the Muslim world at least until the colonial period.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSome scholars suggest that some teaching and instruction probably took place at al-Qarawiyyin Mosque from a very early period[25][22]: 453 or from its beginning.[26]: 287[1]: 71[27] Major mosques in the early Islamic period were typically multi-functional buildings where teaching and education took place alongside other religious and civic activities.[28][29] The al-Andalusiyyin Mosque, in the district across the river, may have also served a similar role up until at least the Marinid period, though it never equaled the Qarawiyyin's later prestige.[22]: 453 It is unclear at what time al-Qarawiyyin began to act more formally as an educational institution, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. **^** Norman Daniel: Review of \"The Rise of Colleges.
