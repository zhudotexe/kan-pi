Journalists and others gave O'Neal several nicknames, including \"Shaq\", \"The Diesel\", \"Shaq Fu\", \"The Big Daddy\", \"Superman\", \"The Big Agave\", \"The Big Cactus\", \"The Big Shaqtus\", \"The Big Galactus\", \"Wilt Chamberneezy\", \"The Big Baryshnikov\", \"The Real Deal\", \"The Big Shamrock\", \"The Big Leprechaun\", \"Shaqovic\",[157][158] and \"The Big Conductor\".[159] Although he was a favorite interviewee of the press, O'Neal was sensitive and often went weeks without speaking.[160] When he did not want to speak with the press, he employed an interview technique whereby, sitting in front of his cubicle, he would murmur in his low-pitched voice.[160][161]\n\n\nDuring the 2000 Screen Actors Guild strike, O'Neal performed in a commercial for Disney. O'Neal was fined by the union for crossing the picket line.[162][163]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOpposing teams often used up many fouls on O'Neal, reducing the playing time of their own big men. O'Neal's imposing physical presence inside the paint caused dramatic changes in many teams' offensive and defensive strategies.[146]\n\n\nO'Neal's primary weakness was his free throw shooting, with a career average of 52.7%. He once missed all 11 of his free throw attempts in a game against the Seattle SuperSonics on December 8, 2000, a record.[147] O'Neal believes his free throw woes were a mental issue, as he often shot 80 percent in practice.[148] In hope of exploiting O'Neal's poor foul shooting, opponents often committed intentional fouls against him, a tactic known as \"Hack-a-Shaq\". O'Neal was the third-ranked player all-time in free throws taken,[149] having attempted 11,252 free-throws in 1,207 games up to and including the 2010–11 season. On December 25, 2008, O'Neal missed his 5,000th free throw, becoming the second player in NBA history to do so, along with Chamberlain.[150]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n109. **^** \"Cleveland Cavaliers' Shaquille O'Neal leaves game with 'significant thumb injury Archived March 1, 2010, at the Wayback Machine\".

On April 2, 2022, Hardaway was announced as one of thirteen members to be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame for the Class of 2022 later this year.[7]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nHardaway was originally selected to play for \"Dream Team II\" in the 1994 FIBA World Championship but was replaced after suffering a torn knee ligament.[8]\n\n\nHe was also selected (as one of the last two players selected) for the 1998 FIBA World Championship team. The team was later replaced with CBA and college players due to the NBA lockout.[9]\n\n\nIn 2000, he played in the Sydney Olympics, scoring 5.5 points/Game and shooting .385 (15–39) from the field.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Denver Nuggets (2002)[edit]\n\n\nWith the Nuggets he started all 14 games he played with them before retiring and becoming a basketball analyst for ESPN.\n\n\nWhile playing for the Nuggets, Hardaway was suspended for two games and fined $10,000 by the league when he threw a television monitor onto the court.[3]\n\n\n\n### Indiana Pacers (2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn March 27, 2003, Hardaway signed a contract with the Indiana Pacers, and in his first game registered a season-high 14 points and seven assists against the Chicago Bulls. By the end of his career, Hardaway competed in five NBA All-Star Games.\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\n### Detroit Pistons (2014–2018)[edit]\n\n\nOn August 7, 2014, it was announced that Hardaway was named an assistant coach for the Detroit Pistons.[4]\n\n\n\n## Achievements[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHardaway started in 81 games, averaging 20.3 points, 8.6 assists, while placing fourth in the league with 203 three-point baskets. He also played in the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, scoring 10 points in 14 minutes. In the playoffs, Hardaway averaged 26 points a game as the Heat defeated the Orlando Magic in the first round in 5 games, and then defeated the New York Knicks in 7 games in the semifinals, in which Hardaway scored 38 points in the 7th game. Miami would once again fall to the defending champion Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals in 5 games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican basketball player (born 1966)\n\nThis article is about the former NBA player. For his son and the current player, see Tim Hardaway Jr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHardaway was the 1989 WAC Player of the Year. He recorded 5,000 points and 2,500 assists, second fastest in NBA history after Oscar Robertson. Hardaway accomplished it in 262 games; Robertson took only 247.[5] He held the record for most assists in Miami Heat franchise history with 1,947,[5] until his total was surpassed by Dwyane Wade on January 16, 2010.\n\n\nHardaway shares the record for second most steals in an NBA playoffs game, with 8 in Game 2 of the 1991 Western Conference Semifinals against the Los Angeles Lakers and in Game 4 of the 1992 Western Conference First Round against the Seattle SuperSonics. In 1991–92, Hardaway became the 7th player in NBA history to average 20 points (23.4 ppg) and 10 assists (10.0 apg) in a season, a feat he accomplished again in 1992–93 (21.5 ppg, 10.6 apg).[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a Warrior, Hardaway made the NBA All-Star Game three straight years, and a knee injury kept him out of the entire 1993–94 season. He reached 5,000 points and 2,500 assists faster than any other NBA player except Oscar Robertson. Hardaway played for the Warriors until the middle of 1995–96 season when he was traded to the Miami Heat along with Chris Gatling in exchange for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (1996–2001)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the mid-season trade to Miami, Hardaway started 28 games to finish the season, averaging 17.2 points a game with 10 assists. Miami made the playoffs but were swept in the first round by the 72 win Chicago Bulls. The following season was a huge success for Miami and for Hardaway, as he finished 4th in voting for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, was selected to the All-NBA First Team as Miami won a franchise record 61 wins.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn an interview on February 11, 2010, on Hardcore Sports Radio on Sirius, Hardaway spoke about his recent work with The Trevor Project and The YES Institute, which he has done to educate himself on LGBT issues.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn April 2013, when Jason Collins came out as the first active openly gay male player in a major American professional team sport, Collins said that Hardaway called him in support of his homosexuality.[21] In July 2013, Hardaway was the symbolic first signer of a petition to put a proposed amendment to the Florida State Constitution overturning Florida Amendment 2 and allowing same-sex marriage in his home state of Florida on the ballot in 2014.[22]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHardaway and his wife Yolanda reside in Michigan. They have a son, Tim Jr., and daughters, Nia and Nina.[5][23] Tim Jr. was drafted by the New York Knicks in 2013, and currently plays for the Dallas Mavericks.[24]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"NBA Asia Challenge 2009\". *NBA.com*.

The Heat won 55 games and won the Atlantic Division, but lost to the Knicks in 5 games in the first round of the playoffs. In the lockout shortened 1998–99 season, he averaged 17.4 points a game with 7.3 assists, and Miami won the Atlantic Division again but could once again not defeat the Knicks in the first round of the playoffs despite having home court advantage and the Knicks being the 8th seed in the playoffs.\n\n\nHardaway's production slipped in the 1999–2000 season, with Alonzo Mourning and Jamal Mashburn carrying more of the offensive load. Hardaway averaged 13.4 points with 7.4 assists a game, but shot a personal best .367 percent from beyond the three-point arc. After playing just 52 games, Hardaway was further limited in the playoffs, as Miami defeated the Detroit Pistons but once again fell to New York in 7 games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHardaway was selected as the 14th overall pick of the 1989 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. In his rookie season, Hardaway wore number *5* on his jersey, as Manute Bol wore Hardaway's *10*. After Bol left the Warriors, Hardaway acquired the number. Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin formed a trio known as Run TMC (the initials of the players' first names and a play on the name of the popular rap group Run-DMC). As part of the Warriors' attack, Hardaway was responsible for leading Run TMC's fast break, displaying his excellent passing and one-on-one skills to complement Richmond's slashing and Mullin's shooting.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThat summer, Hardaway and Mourning won a gold medal playing for the U.S.A. men's basketball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Before the 2000–01 season Mourning would be diagnosed with a rare kidney disease, and would be sidelined for much of the season. Hardaway upped his offensive production to 14.9 points a game with 6.3 assists a game as Miami won 50 games and captured the East's third best record, only to be swept in the first round by the Charlotte Hornets.\n\n\n\n### Dallas Mavericks (2001–2002)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the 2000–01 season, and with his skills declining with age, Hardaway was traded to the Dallas Mavericks on August 22, 2001, for a second-round draft pick. He was at one time Miami's all-time leader in assists. With Dallas, Hardaway was mainly utilized off the bench, starting only two games out of 54 and averaging almost ten points a game. In the middle of the season, he was traded to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for point guard Nick Van Exel.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGolden State made the playoffs during the 1990–91 season, Hardaway's second season and his first season in the playoffs. In the first round, the 7th seeded Warriors defeated the 2nd seeded San Antonio Spurs led by All-Star David Robinson in 4 games to advance to face the 3rd seeded Los Angeles Lakers led by NBA legend Magic Johnson. The Warriors managed to steal a game on the road in game 2, but could not defeat the more experienced Lakers, falling in five games despite Hardaway averaging 26.8 points, 12.8 assists and 3.8 steals for the series.\n\n\nHardaway averaged a career-high 23.4 points a game in the 1991–92 season, as the Warriors fell in the first round of the playoffs to the Seattle SuperSonics. The following season Hardaway averaged a career-high 10.6 assists a game to get with his scoring average of 21.5, but the Warriors did not make the playoffs and would not return to postseason action for the remainder of Hardaway's tenure with the team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHardaway was a player/head coach of the Florida Pit Bulls of the ABA in 2006.[11][12]\n\n\nIn September 2009, he played for the NBA Generations team in the 2009 NBA Asia Challenge, a series of exhibitions against Korean Basketball League and Philippine Basketball Association players.[13]\n\n\n\n## Homophobia controversy[edit]\n\n\nDuring a February 14, 2007, interview on Miami's *The Dan Le Batard Show*, in response to the coming out of former NBA player John Amaechi, Hardaway remarked that he would try to distance himself from a player he knew was homosexual. When asked by the radio show host whether he realized that his remarks were homophobic, Hardaway responded by saying: \"Well, you know I hate gay people, so I let it be known. I don't like gay people and I don't like to be around gay people. I am homophobic. I don't like it. It shouldn't be in the world or in the United States.\" He also said that if he found out he had one or more gay teammates, he would try to get them fired.[14][15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1997–98 | Miami | 81 | 81 | 37.4 | .431 | .351 | .781 | 3.7 | 8.3 | 1.7 | **.2** | 18.9\n |\n| 1998–99 | Miami | 48 | 48 | 36.9 | .400 | .360 | .812 | 3.2 | 7.3 | 1.2 | .1 | 17.4\n |\n| 1999–00 | Miami | 52 | 52 | 32.2 | .386 | .367 | .827 | 2.9 | 7.4 | .9 | .1 | 13.4\n |\n| 2000–01 | Miami | 77 | 77 | 33.9 | .392 | .366 | .801 | 2.6 | 6.3 | 1.2 | .1 | 14.9\n |\n| 2001–02 | Dallas | 54 | 2 | 23.6 | .362 | .341 | **.833** | 1.8 | 3.7 | .4 | .1 | 9.6\n |\n| 2001–02 | Denver | 14 | 14 | 23.2 | .373 | .373 | .632 | 1.9 | 5.5 | 1.2 | .1 | 9.6\n |\n| 2002–03 | Indiana | 10 | 0 | 12.7 | .367 | .355 | .500 | 1.5 | 2.4 | .9 | .0 | 4.9\n |\n| Career\n | 867 | 770 | 35.3 | .431 | .355 | .782 | 3.3 | 8.2 | 1.6 | .1 | 17.7\n |\n| All-Star\n | 5 | 0 | 16.8 | .386 | .381 | .786 | 2.6 | 4.6 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 10.6\n |\n\n\n### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1991 | Golden State | 9 | 9 | 44.0 | **.486** | .354 | .789 | 3.7 | **11.2** | 3.1 | **.8** | 25.2\n |\n| 1992 | Golden State | 4 | 4 | 44.0 | .400 | .345 | .649 | 3.8 | 7.3 | **3.3** | .0 | 24.5\n |\n| 1996 | Miami | 3 | 3 | 36.7 | .465 | .364 | .714 | 1.7 | 5.7 | 1.0 | .0 | 17.7\n |\n| 1997 | Miami | **17** | **17** | 41.2 | .359 | .313 | **.795** | **4.1** | 7.0 | 1.6 | .1 | 18.7\n |\n| 1998 | Miami | 5 | 5 | **44.4** | .447 | **.436** | .784 | 3.4 | 6.6 | 1.2 | .0 | **26.0** |\n| 1999 | Miami | 5 | 5 | 36.4 | .268 | .200 | .625 | 2.8 | 6.4 | 1.0 | .2 | 9.0\n |\n| 2000 | Miami | 7 | 7 | 26.0 | .294 | .206 | .700 | 2.1 | 4.7 | .7 | .0 | 7.7\n |\n| 2001 | Miami | 2 | 2 | 18.0 | .222 | .333 | .000 | 1.0 | 4.5 | .0 | .0 | 2.5\n |\n| 2003 | Indiana | 4 | 0 | 11.8 | .333 | .300 | .000 | .5 | 2.3 | .3 | .0 | 3.3\n |\n| Career\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Guards | * R.

More impressively, he finished with 453 blocked shots in his college career, ranking first all-time in NCAA history at that time. Interestingly, Mourning was never listed as the all-time leader in Georgetown history, as the school credits Patrick Ewing with 493 blocks during his college career,[4] but blocked shots were not an official NCAA statistic at that time.\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Charlotte Hornets (1992–1995)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNicknamed \"**Zo**\", Mourning played the center position. Following his college basketball career at Georgetown University, his tenacity on defense twice earned him the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award and twice placed him on the NBA All-Defensive Team. Mourning made a comeback after undergoing a kidney transplant and later won the 2006 NBA championship with the Heat. Mourning also played for the Charlotte Hornets and New Jersey Nets. On March 30, 2009, Mourning became the first Miami Heat player to have his number retired.[3] In 2010, Mourning was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. In August 2014, Mourning was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and in August 2019 he was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. **^** Hamacher, Brian; Sohn, Amara (July 20, 2011). \"Mourning Sued Over Alleged Hit-And-Run\". *NBC 6 South Florida*.

The following year, Mourning played in just 60 games, posting almost similar averages of 21.5 points, 10.2 rebounds and 3.1 blocks per game, but the Hornets missed the playoffs.\n\n\nIn the 1994–95 season, Mourning and teammate Larry Johnson led the Hornets to a 50-win season and reached the playoffs. Mourning ranked first on the team in scoring (21.3 per game), rebounding (9.9 per game), blocked shots (2.92 per game), and field goal percentage (.519), and played in the 1995 NBA All-Star Game where he scored 10 points and grabbed 8 rebounds. The Hornets lost in four games to the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the playoffs, despite Mourning averaging 22 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 3.3 blocks during the series.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (1995–2003)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 1997–98 season, Mourning played 58 games and averaged 19.2 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.2 blocks per game as the Heat won 55 games. However, Miami lost in the first round to the Knicks, with Mourning missing the deciding Game 5 due to a suspension caused by a fight between Mourning and former teammate Larry Johnson in Game 4.[10] The brawl also involved Knicks head coach Jeff Van Gundy, who was seen dangling on Mourning's leg in an attempt to break up the fight.[11] The following season, the Heat won 31 games in a lockout-shortened 50-game schedule, and Mourning won his first of two consecutive Defensive Player of the Year awards after leading the league in blocks with 3.9 per game. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| FIBA Hall of Fame as player |\n|  |\n| Medals\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Men's basketball |\n| Representing ![](image) United States |\n| Summer Olympics |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) | 2000 Sydney  |  |\n| FIBA World Cup |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) |  1994 Canada  |  |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) |  1990 Argentina  |  |\n| Goodwill Games |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  1990 Seattle  |  |\n |\n\n\n**Alonzo Harding Mourning Jr.** (born February 8, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player who has served as vice president of player programs and development for the Miami Heat since June 2009.[1][2] Mourning played most of his 15-year National Basketball Association (NBA) career for the Heat.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 2007–08 season, he became the Heat's all-time leader in points scored (which has since been surpassed by Dwyane Wade).[41]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nMourning announced his retirement from the NBA on January 22, 2009. In his press conference he said, \"At 38 I feel like I've physically done all I can for this game.\"[42][43] One month later, the Heat announced that they would retire Mourning's number 33 jersey, making him the first Heat player to be so honored.[3] The jersey retirement ceremony occurred on March 30, 2009, when the Heat hosted the Orlando Magic. During the extended halftime ceremony, Mourning was introduced by Florida Governor Charlie Crist; former Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson; Basketball Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing; Heat players Dwyane Wade and Udonis Haslem; and Heat head coach Pat Riley.[44][45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn November 3, 1995, after Mourning rejected Charlotte's contract extension offer worth an average of $11.2 million for seven years and knowing they would not be able to re-sign him, the Hornets traded him, along with reserves Pete Myers and LeRon Ellis in exchange for Glen Rice, Matt Geiger, Khalid Reeves and a first-round pick in the 1996 NBA draft.[7]\n\n\nMourning would immediately serve as the centerpiece of the Pat Riley-coached Heat, and in his first season in Miami he averaged 23.2 points, 10.4 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game as Miami made the playoffs before being swept in the first round by the 72-win Bulls. Mourning played in the 1996 NBA All-Star Game and was joined by All-Star point guard Tim Hardaway who arrived through a mid-season trade.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"Mourning, Raptors part ways\". *CBC.ca*.

He finished second to Shaquille O'Neal in rookie of the year voting.[6] He posted the highest scoring average of any rookie in Hornets history. Mourning and O'Neal were the first NBA rookies since David Robinson in the 1989–90 season to average 20 or more points and 10-plus rebounds in their first seasons. Mourning shattered Charlotte's blocked-shots records, becoming the Hornets' all-time career leader in the 49th game of the season. The greatest moment of Mourning's rookie season came on May 5, 1993, in Game 4 of a first-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics. His 20-footer with .4 seconds left gave the Hornets a 104–103 victory in the game and a 3–1 victory in the series. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn July 1996, Mourning signed a seven-year, $105 million contract with the Heat.[8] In the 1996–97 season, the Heat would go on to win a then franchise-record 61 games, finishing second in the Eastern Conference behind the defending champions Bulls, while Mourning averaged 19.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game. In the playoffs, Miami defeated the Orlando Magic in five games, and advanced to the conference semifinals against the Knicks, where the rivalry between the Heat and the New York Knicks intensified. The Knicks took a 3–1 series lead, but following a brawl between Charlie Ward and P. J. Brown late in Game 5, multiple suspensions were handed down. Mourning scored 28 points in Game 6, followed by a 22-point, 12-rebound performance in Game 7 to help Miami advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, a franchise first, to face Chicago. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn June 17, 2005, the Heat picked up the team option on Mourning,[32] as the Heat once again overhauled their roster, acquiring other veterans seeking a title such as Antoine Walker and Gary Payton.[33][34] Mourning continued to serve as the Heat's backup center, and early on stepped in to serve as the team's starting center after O'Neal suffered an injury. Mourning started in 20 games out of a total of 65 games played, averaging 7.8 points and 5.5 rebounds, while finishing third in the league with 2.7 blocks per game despite playing as a reserve. In the playoffs, Mourning continued to shine in his role as a defensive player off the bench, as Miami advanced past the Bulls and the Nets before defeating the Pistons in six games to advance to the 2006 NBA Finals, the first NBA Finals in franchise history and the first for Mourning. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShortly after playing for the gold medal-winning U.S. national team in the 2000 Summer Olympics, Mourning was diagnosed with a serious kidney disease.[15] Initially deemed out for the remainder of the season, Mourning returned for the final 13 games, helping the Heat win 50 games despite playing limited minutes. However, Miami was swept 3–0 in the first round by the Hornets.[16] In the 2001–02 season, Mourning played 75 games and averaged 15.7 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game, earning his final All-Star nod. Despite that, the Heat missed the playoffs with a 36–46 record. Mourning missed the entire 2002–03 season as he continued to deal with a serious kidney disorder, and without their star center, the Heat won only 25 games and missed the playoffs again.[17]\n\n\n\n### New Jersey Nets (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMourning's scoring and rebounding improved over the next two seasons, but his shot-blocking declined significantly, as his taller teammate Dikembe Mutombo established himself as starting center for Georgetown, forcing Mourning to play at power forward. After Mutombo entered the NBA draft in 1991, Mourning re-took his place as starting center, and responded with a spectacular senior season in 1991–92. He averaged 21.3 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 5.0 blocks per game that year, and collected numerous awards, including Consensus First-Team All-American and Big East Conference Player of the Year. He was also named Big East Defensive Player of the Year, which he had won twice previously (as a freshman in 1988–89, and again as a sophomore in 1989–90, sharing the award with Mutombo that season; Mutombo won the award alone in 1990–91).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2007, Mourning along with Andre Agassi, Muhammad Ali, Lance Armstrong, Warrick Dunn, Mia Hamm, Jeff Gordon, Tony Hawk, Andrea Jaeger, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Mario Lemieux, and Cal Ripken Jr. founded Athletes for Hope, a charitable organization, which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and inspires millions of non-athletes to volunteer and support the community.[58]\n\n\nIn 2003, he also founded the Overtown Youth Center for underprivileged kids, located in Miami, Florida. The program aims to inspire, empower, and enrich these children while teaching them to become positive contributing citizens.\n\n\nIn 2009, the Miami-Dade school board named a new high school in North Miami, Florida, in his honor, Alonzo and Tracy Mourning Senior High Biscayne Bay Campus.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMourning and his ex-wife Tracy have three children.[59] Like his father, his oldest son, Trey Mourning played for the Georgetown Hoyas basketball team, wearing his father's signature number 33 jersey. They resided in Pinecrest, Florida, where Mourning purchased a two-story, 9,786-square-foot residence for $4.5 million in 2012.[60] On June 26, 2019, Trey was included on the Miami Heat roster for the 2019 NBA Summer League,[61] and was later selected second overall by the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the NBA G League in the 2019 NBA G League draft.[62]\n\n\nIn July 2011, Mourning was sued by Miami-based lawyer Spencer Aronfeld on behalf of Alberto Candoleria for crashing his car into another car and then leaving the scene of the accident. The Florida Highway Patrol later charged Mourning with leaving the scene of a car accident. The accident allegedly occurred after he left Chris Bosh's wedding in Miami Beach after 3:00 a.m. Candoleria had just been in an accident when Mourning struck his car.[63][64][65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMourning re-signed with the Heat on March 1, 2005.[31] His role was reduced as a backup because of superstar Shaquille O'Neal, although he was called upon as a starter due to O'Neal missing stretches due to injury. O'Neal and Mourning even played together on the court at times, with Mourning playing power forward. Because of physical limitations, his minutes were reduced, but was still a steady contributor. Mourning's tenacious defense, steady offense, and all around hustle helped the Heat gain and maintain the first seed in Eastern Conference during the 2004–05 season. Mourning finished the regular season ranking third in blocked shots at 2.66 per game, despite only playing 20 minutes per contest. Miami swept the Nets in the first round of the playoffs, with Mourning recording 21 points and nine rebounds in just 16 minutes in Game 2. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Cawthon, Raad; Michael Sokolov (November 4, 1995). \"Hornets Forced To Deal Alonzo Mourning, Seeking $13 Million A Year, Went To Miami In A Six-player Swap.

S. Marine, Jason Cooper, was visiting Mourning's gravely ill grandmother in the hospital. Mourning's father was present and informed Cooper that Mourning was retiring that day from the NBA because of a life-threatening kidney disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, the same problem that Sean Elliott had in 1999. Cooper asked if there was anything he could do, and began to contemplate donating one of his kidneys to his estranged cousin, whom he had not seen in 25 years and whom he only knew through basketball. Cooper was tested for compatibility, along with many other family members and friends (including fellow NBA center and good friend Patrick Ewing); during his grandmother's funeral, Mourning received the news that Jason Cooper was a match.[67][68]\n\n\nMourning received Cooper's left kidney on December 19, 2003.[66][68]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the second round against the Washington Wizards, Mourning stepped in for the injured O'Neal and scored 14 points with 13 rebounds and blocked four shots in Game 3 as Miami completed another four-game sweep. Miami fell in seven games to the defending champions, the Detroit Pistons, in the Eastern Conference Finals, with Mourning leading the team in blocks with three per game for the series.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn May 2009, he was named to the Hampton Roads Sports Hall of Fame, which honors athletes, coaches, and administrators who contributed to sports in southeastern Virginia. In the following April, he was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in recognition of his outstanding high school, collegiate, and professional career as well as his commitment to volunteer service in the communities in which he has lived and worked throughout his life.[46]\n\n\nMourning announced his return to the Heat in late June 2009; he holds the position of vice president of player programs and development, which covers community outreach and mentoring young players.[47]\n\n\nMourning played in a basketball game for Barack Obama's 50th birthday at the basketball court at the White House in 2011.

He made an immediate impact as a freshman, starting all 34 games for the Hoyas, averaging 13.1 points and 7.3 rebounds per game. But his most notable accomplishment was leading the nation in total blocked shots (169) and blocks per game (5.0); both figures led the nation and set NCAA records for a freshman at that time.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Alonzo Mourning with former U.S. President Bill Clinton during Clinton Global Initiative University Day of Service at Carrfour Supportive Housing community for formerly homeless families in Miami, Florida, April 2010\nIn 1997, Mourning established Alonzo Mourning Charities Inc. to aid in the development of children and families living in at-risk situations and provides support and services that enhance the lives of youth of promise.\n\n\nAfter being diagnosed with focal glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Mourning launched Zo's Fund for Life, a campaign which seeks to raise funds for research, education, and testing to fight focal glomerulosclerosis. Funds are allocated toward research for a cure, education for doctors and the general public, testing for early detection and a fund for those not able to afford medication.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMourning signed a four-year deal with the New Jersey Nets in July 2003 as a free agent.[18][19] On November 24, 2003, after appearing in 12 games, Mourning retired from the NBA due to complications from his kidney disease.[20][21] On December 19, he underwent a successful kidney transplant.[22] In 2004, he started practicing with the Nets again, and made the team's regular season roster during the 2004–05 season. He did not play a significant role with the Nets, however, and openly complained to the media that he wanted out of New Jersey, especially after the team traded away Kenyon Martin.[23][24] After playing in just 30 total games for New Jersey, Mourning, Eric Williams and Aaron Williams were traded to the Toronto Raptors for Vince Carter on December 17, 2004.[25][26] Mourning never reported to the Raptors, and was bought out of his contract at a remaining $9 million on February 11, 2005. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2001–02 | Miami | 75 | 74 | 32.7 | .516 | **.333** | .657 | 8.4 | 1.2 | .4 | 2.5 | 15.7\n |\n| 2003–04 | New Jersey | 12 | 0 | 17.9 | .465 | .000 | **.882** | 2.3 | .7 | .2 | .5 | 8.0\n |\n| 2004–05 | New Jersey | 18 | 14 | 25.4 | .453 | .000 | .593 | 7.1 | .8 | .3 | 2.3 | 10.4\n |\n| 2004–05 | Miami | 19 | 3 | 12.9 | .516 | .000 | .564 | 3.7 | .2 | .2 | 1.7 | 5.0\n |\n| 2005–06†\n | Miami | 65 | 20 | 20.0 | **.597** | .000 | .594 | 5.5 | .2 | .2 | 2.7 | 7.8\n |\n| 2006–07 | Miami | 77 | 43 | 20.4 | .560 | .000 | .601 | 4.5 | .2 | .2 | 2.3 | 8.6\n |\n| 2007–08 | Miami | 25 | 0 | 15.6 | .547 | .000 | .592 | 3.7 | .3 | .2 | 1.7 | 6.0\n |\n| Career\n | 838 | 686 | 31.0 | .527 | .247 | .692 | 8.5 | 1.1 | .5 | 2.8 | 17.1\n |\n| All-Star\n | 4 | 1 | 18.8 | .545 | .000 | .667 | 4.8 | 1.0 | .8 | 2.0 | 10.0\n |\n\n\n### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_0Povo23VcLKnJ919TkaHPELZ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

A Texas Mr. Basketball in high school, he played one season of college basketball for Georgia Tech before declaring for the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn October 28, 2015, Bosh made his return to the court in the Heat's season opener against the Charlotte Hornets, recording 21 points and 10 rebounds in a 104–94 win.[95] On November 10, 2015, he scored a then season-high 30 points in a 101–88 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.[96] On December 28, 2015, he recorded 24 points and 12 rebounds against the Brooklyn Nets, and hit a career-best 5-of-5 from three-point range.[97] On January 4, 2016, he recorded a season-high 31 points and 11 rebounds in a 103–100 overtime win over the Indiana Pacers.[98] Though he was voted to play in the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, and selected to compete in the Three-Point Contest, due to a calf injury, Bosh was forced to withdraw from both.[99]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Bosh and his teammates in a 2005–06 game against the Milwaukee Bucks. From left: Pape Sow, Bosh, Mike James and Morris Peterson.\nWith the departure of the disenchanted franchise face of the team, Vince Carter, in December 2004, Bosh was simultaneously anointed as the new leader around whom Toronto would build.[23] In the remaining games following Carter's departure, the power forward averaged 18.4 points, 9.5 rebounds, 1.6 blocks, and 38.1 minutes per game, improving in every major statistical category.[11] He was awarded his first ever NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played between January 3 and 9, 2005.[11] As the season drew to a close, analysts predicted that Bosh would become an All-Star one day.[24][25] Bosh ended the 2004–05 season as the leading scorer and leading rebounder for the team on 21 and 46 occasions respectively.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn February 7, 2007, Bosh's career-high 41 points prompted the home fans to chant \"MVP\"—an unprecedented event in the Air Canada Centre.[38] Two days later, Bosh collected 29 points and 11 rebounds against the Los Angeles Lakers, shooting 10-of-10 in the second half.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Bosh with Team USA at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games\nBosh's national team career began in 2002 when he was selected as a member of the 2002 USA Basketball Junior World Championship Qualifying Team that finished with a 4–1 record and the bronze medal.[112]\n\n\nAfter his NBA career began, Bosh was named in March 2006 to the 2006–2008 United States men's national basketball team program, and helped lead the team to a 5–0 record during its pre-World Championship tour.[112] In August 2006, Bosh was named as a member of the 2006 USA World Championship Team.[112] Together with fellow 2003 draftees Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Kirk Hinrich, this team competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship. The team won the bronze medal, defeating former 2004 Olympic champion Argentina.[113] Bosh was ranked sixth in field goal percentage.[112]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn January 5, 2012, Bosh led the Heat to a 116–109 triple-overtime win against the Atlanta Hawks, highlighted by a three-point shot he made to force the game into overtime with 0.6 seconds left to play in the fourth quarter. Bosh finished the game with 33 points, 14 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 2 blocked shots.[83] By season's end, the Heat had embraced a small-ball strategy that featured Bosh at the center position. In the playoffs, Bosh averaged 14.0 points and 7.8 rebounds a game. In game 1 of the Conference Semi-finals against the Indiana Pacers, he suffered a lower abdominal strain that forced him to miss the rest of the series and the first four games of the Eastern Conference Finals against Boston. Bosh returned in the Conference Finals against the Celtics. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBosh was the league leader in double-doubles at the time, being only one of two players in the league who averaged at least 20 points and 10 rebounds a game.[71] On January 20, 2010, he scored a career-high 44 points in a loss against the Milwaukee Bucks, while collecting his 220th career double-double.[72] That same month, Bosh was named a reserve for the Eastern Conference All-Star team,[73] and was Eastern Conference Player of the Week.[74] After the All-Star break, the Raptors went on several losing streaks and an injury to Bosh exacerbated the situation. As the regular season came to a close, the Raptors went from being the fifth seed before the All-Star break to fighting for the eighth and final playoff spot with the Chicago Bulls. After recording his 44th double-double on March 22, 2010, Bosh became the Raptors' all-time leader in number of double-doubles in a season. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2010, after seven seasons with the Raptors, Bosh entered into a sign-and-trade deal whereby he was traded to the Miami Heat.[2] In Miami, he joined fellow stars Dwyane Wade and LeBron James; the trio became known as the Big Three. Bosh spent the second half of his career with Miami, appearing in the NBA Finals each year from 2011 to 2014 and winning NBA titles in 2012 and 2013. He made the NBA All-Star team every year during his time in Miami. Bosh's career was cut short by a blood clotting condition that the NBA ruled to be a career-ending illness.[3][4] He played his final NBA game on February 9, 2016.[5] Notwithstanding the NBA's ruling, Bosh fought to resume his playing career for three years[6] before announcing in February 2019 that he intended to retire.[7] The same year, the Heat retired his No. 1 jersey.[8][9] In 2021, Bosh was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn June 2, 2017, the NBA ruled that Bosh's blood clotting issues were a career-ending illness, meaning the Heat would be allowed to remove his contract from their salary cap once they officially released him.[4] Two days later, the Heat announced that they had waived Bosh, ending a seven-year stint with the organization.[107] Following Bosh's release, Heat President Pat Riley said, \"The number '1' will never be worn by another player and we can't wait to someday hang his jersey in the rafters\".[108] In February 2018, Bosh declared himself on the comeback trail, having refused to rule out a return to the NBA.[6][109]\n\n\nOn February 12, 2019, Bosh announced that he was no longer pursuing his NBA career[110] and that he planned to retire from the NBA when his jersey was retired by the Heat.[111] The Heat retired Bosh's No. 1 jersey on March 26 before a regular season game against the Orlando Magic.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBosh eventually chose to follow the footsteps of his cousin and aunt and attended Georgia Tech to study graphic design and computer imaging, and subsequently, management.[13] There, he led the Yellow Jackets in averaging 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 31 games, and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in field goal percentage (.560), joining Antawn Jamison as the only freshmen ever to do so.[11] Bosh originally intended to complete his degree, but by the end of the 2002–03 season, his strong performances convinced him that he was ready for the NBA.[17] He left Georgia Tech after his freshman season[11] and entered the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh said in future interviews that although he misses his college days, he believes he made the right decision to pursue a professional career.[15]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Toronto Raptors (2003–2010)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh shooting a free throw during a game in the 2005–06 season\n#### Rookie year (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican basketball player (born 1984)\n\nThis article is about the basketball player.

In the 2006–07 season, Bosh led the Raptors to their first playoff appearance in five years and their first-ever division title.

Bosh continued to work on his game as he consistently chalked up double-doubles, leading the team in scoring, rebounding, and field goal percentage for the first half of the season.[26] On February 9, 2006, for the first time in his career, Bosh was selected to play in the 2006 NBA All-Star Game in Houston, Texas as a reserve forward for the Eastern Conference.[11] He was only the third Raptor to make an All-Star game, after Carter and Antonio Davis. Bosh's selection was just three days after he was named NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the second time in his career.[26] In March 2006, following a season-ending injury to Bosh,[27] the Raptors hit a 1–10 skid.[28] This highlighted Bosh's importance as the centerpiece of the offense, as well as the leader of the team. The Raptors finished the season 27–55 and Bosh averaged 22.5 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game.[29]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBosh traditionally played the power forward position, including during his first season with the Miami Heat. However, starting in the 2011–12 season, he began to start at center and played the position during the team's consecutive championships. Listed at 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m) and 235 pounds (107 kg),[29] Bosh possessed excellent speed, athleticism, and ball handling for a player of his size.[120] He was particularly noted for his ability to drive to the basket and finish strong or get to the free throw line—where he was also proficient, but he was also known for his well-developed jump shot.[121] Indiana Pacers coach Jim O'Brien once commented on the match-up problems Bosh posed for opposing defenders: \"We've tried over the years to put big guys on him. It doesn't work. We've tried to put small guys on him. It doesn't seem to work either. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the final seconds of game 6, James missed a three-pointer, and Bosh grabbed the offensive rebound and found a wide-open Ray Allen in the corner. Allen hit the shot to tie the game, and in overtime the Heat had a three-point lead with seconds left. San Antonio inbounded the ball to Danny Green, who attempted a corner three, but Green's shot was blocked by Bosh to secure the Heat's victory. Bosh was held scoreless in game 7 by Tim Duncan, but the Heat still won the game and the series to claim their second consecutive NBA championship.[87]\n\n\n\n#### Coming up short (2013–2014)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2013–14 season, Bosh played and started in 79 games, averaging 16.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. He also hit a career-high 74 three-point shots on 33 percent shooting from beyond the arc. In the playoffs, Bosh helped the Heat return to the NBA Finals, where they faced the San Antonio Spurs once again. This time, however, the Heat were outclassed by the Spurs, as they lost the series in five games.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn November 8, 2006, against the Philadelphia 76ers, he hit a game-winning three-point shot with 6.1 seconds left.[124] It was reminiscent of the shot that marked his \"arrival\" to the NBA in his first season, when he hit a game-tying three-pointer against Houston to send the game to overtime.[11] When the 2006–07 season concluded, Bosh had shot .343 from the three-point arc for the season; he improved to .400 the following season.[29] Because of his ability to hit three-pointers, it was during his tenure with the Miami Heat that he began to be relied upon as one of the team's outside shooters, taking multiple three-pointers throughout the 2012 and 2013 championship runs. During the 2013–14 season, Bosh shot and made more three-pointers than at any point during his career, and continued to make crucial shots during the playoffs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Bosh in 2007\nBefore the 2007–08 season began, Andrea Bargnani, the number one pick in the 2006 NBA draft, was slated to start at center and Bosh at power forward to form a strong Toronto frontcourt and Jason Kapono, a three-point specialist, was acquired via free agency from the Miami Heat to add offensive firepower; however, as the season unfolded, neither plans materialized as hoped.[48] Bosh himself had a slow start to the season, but as mid-season approached, his form picked up and he was named Player of the Week for the second week of January.[49] On January 31, 2008, he was selected to be on the Eastern Conference team for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game.[50] Bosh missed 15 games throughout the season, but the Raptors still managed to conclude the regular season with a 41–41 record, thus clinching the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2008 NBA playoffs. However, they were defeated by the Orlando Magic in the first round, losing 4–1.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeeking to promote sports and education amongst youths in Dallas and Toronto, Bosh set up the Chris Bosh Foundation and regularly speaks to youths about the benefits of reading.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBorn to Noel and Freida Bosh in Dallas, Texas,[11] Bosh was raised in Hutchins, a suburb of the city.[12] A family-oriented person, Bosh would often play basketball in the house with his younger brother, Joel.[13] At the early age of four years old, he started learning how to dribble a basketball in the gym where his father played pick-up games.[14] Since Bosh was always tall for his age, he was accustomed to out-rebounding his peers whenever he played;[15] but he only started learning the game of basketball seriously around fourth grade, doing so at a playground near his grandmother's house.[13]\n\n\nAs a child, Bosh participated in karate and gymnastics.[16] He also played baseball up until high school, chiefly as a first baseman according to his preference.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBosh was initially optimistic about a return to the Heat for the 2016–17 season, and the organization had become increasingly hopeful that he would be cleared for camp. Those hopes quickly faded due to Bosh's continued issues with blood clotting.[103] In September 2016, Bosh failed his physical exam and was not cleared by the team to participate in training camp.[104] On September 26, 2016, Heat president Pat Riley said that the team viewed Bosh's career with the team as over.[105] In May 2017, Bosh and the Heat reportedly reached a unique agreement in which Bosh would leave the Heat without his salary taking up the team's salary cap space for the 2017–18 season.[106]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTwo weeks later, in a bid to bring in a wing player and create greater salary flexibility, O'Neal and Jamario Moon were traded to Miami for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks.[61] The trade did not improve the team's win–loss record, however, and the Raptors were eliminated from contention with seven games of the regular season remaining.[63] The bright spark in Bosh's campaign was his career-high 22.7 points per game, as well as his being one of two players in the league that season (the other being Dwight Howard) to average a 20/10 in points and rebounds.[64] On April 20, 2009, Colangelo announced that he would offer Bosh a contract extension during the summer,[65] which Bosh later refused to sign.[66]\n\n\n\n#### Overhauling the roster (2009–2010)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBosh was noted for his leadership. When he was the leader of the Raptors, he was not known for being vocal on the court, preferring to maintain his quiet and humble demeanor but expecting his teammates to match his work ethic.[121] However, Bosh was also known to deliver stern rebukes to teammates who made bad calls on the court.[125] Throughout his career, comparisons were made between him and Kevin Garnett due to their similar style of play and physique.\n\n\n\n## Honors and achievements[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n94. **^** Windhorst, Brian; Gutierrez, Israel (February 22, 2015). \"Heat's Chris Bosh out for season\". *ESPN*.

Wade established himself on defense for his ability to block shots and accumulate steals.[138] He holds the NBA record for blocks by players listed 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and under, which he achieved in only 679 games; this is over 400 games less than the previous record-holder Dennis Johnson (1,100).[139]\n\n\nIn 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Wade as the 28th greatest player in NBA history.[140]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Associated Press. \"Dwyane Wade to enter NBA draft.\" Archived October 12, 2007, at the Wayback Machine *www.signonsandiego.com*, May 1, 2003.

On offense, he was one of the quickest and most difficult players to guard, as well as one of the best slashers in NBA history. Wade's signature one-two step allowed him to dash past bigger defenders and draw fouls.[134] Wade ranked first in free-throw attempts per 48 minutes in 2004–05 and again in the 2006–07 season. Wade was an unselfish player, averaging 5.4 assists for his career.[34] After winning the NBA Finals MVP Award in 2006, Wade developed a reputation as one of the league's premier clutch players.[135]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWade tied his career-high with 16 assists and added 35 points on 62% shooting, 6 rebounds, plus a steal and a block, as the Heat beat the Phoenix Suns 135–129.[63] Wade became the only player in Heat history to have multiple games with 30-plus points and 15 or more assists.[63] Less than a week later, Wade hit the buzzer-beater and tied his earlier franchise record with his 78th straight double-digit scoring game in double-overtime against the Chicago Bulls.[64] Wade finished the game with 48 points on 71.4% shooting, 12 assists, 6 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks in 50 minutes of play.[64] Wade joined Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to record that many points and that many assists in a single game while having as high of a field goal percentage.[65] Two games later, Wade surpassed Alonzo Mourning to become the Heat's all-time leading scorer in triple overtime versus the Utah Jazz.[66] Wade finished that 140–129 victory with 50 points to go along with his 10 rebounds, 9 assists, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn April 3, in a 101–98 win over the Atlanta Hawks, Wade reached 5,000 assists in a Heat uniform, becoming the ninth player to score 20,000 points and collect 5,000 assists with one team, joining Karl Malone, Bryant, Jordan, James, Larry Bird, John Havlicek, Oscar Robertson and Jerry West.[112] On April 16, Wade scored 28 points to end the 76ers' 17-game winning streak and lead the Heat to a 113–103 Game 2 win over Philadelphia and even the first-round playoff series.

The following day, Wade was suspended by the NBA for one game.[89] Wade finished the 2012–2013 season with averages of 21.2 points, 5 rebounds and 5.1 assists.\n\n\nIn the playoffs, injuries limited Wade to a career-low scoring average of 15.9 points per game, but he upped his average to 19.6 points during the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs.

In his third season, Wade led the Heat to their first NBA Championship and was named the 2006 NBA Finals MVP. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Wade led the United States men's basketball team, commonly known as the \"Redeem Team\", in scoring and helped them capture the gold medal. In the 2008–09 season, Wade led the league in both total points (2,386) and points per game (30.2), the latter stat earning him his sole NBA scoring title. Wade was selected as the NBA All-Star Game MVP in 2010. With LeBron James and Chris Bosh, Wade helped guide Miami to four consecutive NBA Finals from 2011 to 2014, and won back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 2007 playoffs, Wade averaged 23.5 points, 6.3 assists, and 4.8 rebounds per contest, but were swept in the first round by the Chicago Bulls.[48] Post-playoffs, Wade underwent a pair of surgeries to repair his dislocated left shoulder and left knee, both of which proved successful. However, the knee ailment, commonly called \"jumper's knee\", prevented Wade from joining USA Basketball in the Olympic Qualifying Tournament over that summer.[49]\n\n\nAfter missing the Tournament of Americas' Olympic Qualifiers as well as the preseason and the first seven games, Wade began the 2007–08 season on November 14, 2007.[50] Despite battling pain in his injured knee throughout the season,[51] Wade was elected to his fourth consecutive All-Star Game appearance.[52] However, the Heat held the worst record in the NBA.

O'Neal starred in *Shaq Fu*, a fighting game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis. A sequel, *Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn*, was released in 2018.[221] O'Neal also appeared in *Quest for the Code* in 2002 as a voice actor,[222] *Backyard Basketball* in 2004, *Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2* as a playable boxer, and as an unlockable character in *Delta Force: Black Hawk Down*. O'Neal was also an unlockable character in *UFC Undisputed 2010*.[223]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOpposing teams often used up many fouls on O'Neal, reducing the playing time of their own big men. O'Neal's imposing physical presence inside the paint caused dramatic changes in many teams' offensive and defensive strategies.[146]\n\n\nO'Neal's primary weakness was his free throw shooting, with a career average of 52.7%. He once missed all 11 of his free throw attempts in a game against the Seattle SuperSonics on December 8, 2000, a record.[147] O'Neal believes his free throw woes were a mental issue, as he often shot 80 percent in practice.[148] In hope of exploiting O'Neal's poor foul shooting, opponents often committed intentional fouls against him, a tactic known as \"Hack-a-Shaq\". O'Neal was the third-ranked player all-time in free throws taken,[149] having attempted 11,252 free-throws in 1,207 games up to and including the 2010–11 season. On December 25, 2008, O'Neal missed his 5,000th free throw, becoming the second player in NBA history to do so, along with Chamberlain.[150]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nO'Neal only made one three-point shot during his entire career. He made the shot during the 1995–96 NBA season with the Orlando Magic. His career three-point-shot record is 1 for 22 (a 4.5% career percentage).\n\n\nO'Neal was a capable defender, named three times to the All-NBA Second Defensive Team. His presence intimidated opposing players shooting near the basket, and he averaged 2.3 blocked shots per game over the course of his career.[151]\n\n\nPhil Jackson believed O'Neal underachieved in his career, saying he \"could and should have been the MVP player for 10 consecutive seasons.\"[152] In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named O'Neal as the 8th greatest player in NBA history.[153]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n170. **^** Brown, Tim (January 10, 2003). \"Tall tale?
