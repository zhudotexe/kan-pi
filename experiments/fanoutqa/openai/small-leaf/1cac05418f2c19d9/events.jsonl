relation between China and Vietnam also declined following reunification in 1975, with Vietnam siding with the Soviet Union against China in the Chinese-Soviet split. Tensions peaked when Vietnam and Cambodia started a war, Cambodia lead by Pol Pot being a Chinese ally, resulting in a Chinese invasion of Vietnam in 1979. In 1978-79, some 450,000 ethnic Chinese left Vietnam by boat as refugees (many officially encouraged and assisted) or were expelled across the land border with China. In recent years the government has performed an about turn and is encouraging overseas Hoa to return and invest, but the ethnic Chinese population has been in continuous decline since the 1970s due to assimilation and low birth rates.\n\n\nThe central highland peoples commonly termed Degar or Montagnards (mountain people) comprise two main ethnolinguistic groups--Malayo-Polynesian and Mon‚ÄìKhmer. About 30 groups of various cultures and dialects are spread over the highland territory.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_ZgmRECjZ36FOYUpTyhFwfmcA","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

At this rate, Indonesia's population is projected to surpass the population of the United States if the recent population growth continues.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Province\n | Population (2010 census)\n | Urban¬†%in 2010\n | TotalFertilityRate\n | Population (2015 census)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Aceh | 4,494,410 | 23.6 | 2.79 | 4,496,570\n |\n| North Sumatra | 12,982,204 | 42.4 | 3.01 | 13,923,262\n |\n| West Sumatra | 4,846,909 | 29.0 | 2.91 | 5,190,577\n |\n| Riau | 5,538,367 | 43.7 | 2.82 | 6,330,941\n |\n| Jambi | 3,092,265 | 28.3 | 2.51 | 3,397,164\n |\n| South Sumatra | 7,450,394 | 34.4 | 2.56 | 8,043,042\n |\n| Bengkulu | 1,715,518 | 29.4 | 2.51 | 1,872,136\n |\n| Lampung | 7,608,405 | 21.0 | 2.45 | 8,109,601\n |\n| Bangka Belitung Islands | 1,223,296 | 43.0 | 2.54 | 1,370,331\n |\n| Riau Islands | 1,679,163 | 67.4 | 2.38 | 1,968,313\n |\n| Banten | 10,632,166 | 52.2 | 2.35 | 11,934,373\n |\n| Jakarta | 9,607,787 | 100.0 | 1.82 | 10,154,134\n |\n| West Java | 43,053,732 | 50.3 | 2.43 | 46,668,214\n |\n| Central Java | 32,382,657 | 40.4 | 2.20 | 33,753,023\n |\n| Yogyakarta | 3,457,491 | 57.7 | 1.94 | 3,675,768\n |\n| East Java | 37,476,757 | 40.9 | 2.00 | 38,828,061\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*urban population:* 57.9% of total population (2022)\n*rate of urbanisation:* 1.99% annual rate of change (2020-25 est.)\n**Sex ratio**\n\n\n\n*at birth:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*0-14 years:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*15-24 years:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*25-54 years:* 0.99 male(s)/female\n*55-64 years:* 0.98 male(s)/female\n*65 years and over:* 0.66 male(s)/female\n*total population:* 1 male(s)/female (2022 est.)\n**Infant mortality rate**\n\n\n\n*total:* 19.73 deaths/1,000 live births\n*male:* 22.15 deaths/1,000 live births\n*female:* 17.18 deaths/1,000 live births (2022 est.)\n**Life expectancy at birth**\n\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in Indonesia since 1927\n![](image)Life expectancy in Indonesia since 1960 by gender\n*total population:* 73.08 years\n*male:* 70.86 years\n*female:* 75.4 years (2022 est.)\n**Total fertility rate**\n\n\n\n2.01 children born/woman (2022 est.)\n**HIV/AIDS**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| South Sulawesi | 2.55\n | 2.22 | 8.2\n |\n| Southeast Sulawesi | 3.20\n | 2.57 | 5.8\n |\n| Gorontalo | 2.76\n | 2.30 | 5.9\n |\n| West Sulawesi | 3.33\n | 2.58 | 6.2\n |\n| Maluku | 3.56\n | 2.52 | 6.2\n |\n| North Maluku | 3.35\n | 2.47 | 4.8\n |\n| West Papua | 3.18\n | 2.66 | 3.2\n |\n| Papua | 2.87\n | 2.76 | 2.4\n |\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ethnic groups |  | Percentage |\n| Javanese |  | 42.65% |\n| Sundanese |  | 15.41% |\n| Malay |  | 3.45% |\n| Madurese |  | 3.37% |\n| Batak |  | 3.02% |\n| Minangkabau |  | 2.72% |\n| Betawi |  | 2.51% |\n| Bugis |  | 2.49% |\n| Bantenese |  | 2.05% |\n| Banjarese |  | 1.74% |\n| Acehnese |  | 1.66% |\n| Balinese |  | 1.51% |\n| Chinese |  | 1.20% |\n| Makassarese |  | 0.99% |\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in Indonesia\n\nThere are over 1,300 ethnic groups in Indonesia;[19] 95% of those are of Native Indonesian ancestry.

Following independence they constituted the largest non-indigenous ethnic group in Uganda, at around 80,000 people, and they dominated trade, industry, and the professions. This caused resentment among the native African majority, which was exploited by post-Independence leaders.\n\n\nAfter Idi Amin came to power in 1971, he declared \"economic war\" on the Indians, culminating in the Expulsion of Asians in Uganda in 1972. Since Amin's overthrow in 1979 some Asians have returned. There are between 15,000 and 25,000 in Uganda today, nearly all in the capital Kampala.\n\n\nThere are also about 10,000 Europeans, mostly of native English origin, and 3,000 Arabs of various national origins in Uganda.\n\n\n\n## Other demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nDemographic statistics of Uganda in 2022:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAspect of human geography in Uganda\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

The urban population increased from 31% of the total population in 1938, to 57% in 1951 and about 70% by 1990. Currently the figure is about 77%. The list of the most populated cities in the country only contains the population living in the urban area of the municipalities, according to the results of the 2018 population census.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **demographics of Colombia** consist of statistics regarding Colombians' health, economic status, religions affiliations, ethnicity, population density and other aspects of the population. Colombia is the second-most populous country in South America after Brazil, and the third-most populous in Latin America, after Brazil and Mexico.\n\n\nColombia's population has grown steadily for most of its history, although the growth rate slowed marekdly in the late 20th century, due in part to emigration resulting from a sustained internal conflict. However, the economy has improved noticeably in recent decades, especially un urban areas, and living standards have risen in line with this.\n\n\n\n\n## Census[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in Colombia since 1900\n![](image)Life expectancy in Colombia since 1960 by gender\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[45]\n\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\n48,637,910 (May 2016 est.)\n\n\n\n### Median age[edit]\n\n\ntotal: 27.7 years\n\n\nmale: 26.7 years\n\n\nfemale: 28.6 years (2010 est.)\n\n\n\n### Sex ratio[edit]\n\n\nAt birth: 1.03 male(s)/female\n\n\nUnder 15 years: 1.02 male(s)/female\n\n\n15‚Äì64 years: 0.95 male(s)/female\n\n\n65 years and over: 0.75 male(s)/female\n\n\ntotal population: 0.96 male(s)/female (2009 est.)\n\n\n\n### HIV/AIDS ‚Äì adult prevalence rate[edit]\n\n\n0.7% (2007 est.)\n\n\n\n### HIV/AIDS ‚Äì people living with HIV/AIDS[edit]\n\n\n170,000 (2007 est.)\n\n\n\n### HIV/AIDS ‚Äì deaths[edit]\n\n\n9,800 (2007 est.)\n\n\n\n### Nationality[edit]\n\n\nnoun: Colombia\nadjective: Colombian(s)\n\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\n\ntotal population: 99.4%\n\n\nmale: 99.1% (2018 census)\n\n\nfemale: 99.7% (2018 census)\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ‚àí | ‚àí | **Colombia** | **48,258,494** | **42,888,592** | **12.5%** | **+5,369,902** | **-** | **1,141,748** | **42.3** | **-** | **52,215,503** |\n\n\n## Current vital statistics by department[edit]\n\n\nTotal Fertility Rates (number of children born per mother) and the expected number of births and deaths in 2021.

Whites tend to live mainly in urban centers, like Bogot√°, Medell√≠n or Cali, and the burgeoning highland cities. The populations of the major cities also include mestizos.

This has resulted in numerous applications for political asylum abroad.\n\n\nColombians have emigrated in comparably high rates to the United States.

Many of the Brazilians found in these countries are descendants of the early immigrants who came to Brazil in the early 1900s.\n\n\nThere is also a sizeable Brazilian community in France (172,000 Brazilians in 2021), almost equally split between Metropolitan France and French Guyana.\n\n\n\n## Racial composition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Race and ethnicity in Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to the IBGE census 2010[114] 64.6% are Roman Catholics; 24% are Protestants and other Christians, 8% are agnostics, atheists or have no religion, 2% are followers of Spiritism, and 1% are members of other religions. Some of these religions are Jehovah's Witnesses (1,100,000), Latter-day Saints (200,000), Buddhism (215,000), Judaism (86,000), and Islam (27,000).[115]\n\n\nBrazil has the largest Roman Catholic population in the world.[116]\n\n\nFollowers of Protestantism are rising in number. Until 1970, the majority of Brazilian Protestants were adherents of \"traditional churches\", mostly Lutherans, Presbyterians and Baptists. There are 120,000 Episcopalians in 9 dioceses (Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil). Since then, numbers of Pentecostal and Neopentecostal adherents have increased significantly.\n\n\nIslam in Brazil was first practiced by African slaves.[117] The Muslim population in Brazil is made up mostly of Arab immigrants.[118]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image)¬†Ireland | 86 | 217 | 23 | 11,800 | 48 | -11,583\n |\n| ![](image)¬†North Korea | 88 | 182 | 36 | 2,841 | 37 | -2,659\n |\n| ![](image)¬†Luxembourg | 111 | 68 | 34 | 3,722 | 40 | -3,654\n |\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Brazil\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2000 Brazilian census provides some information about the high number of migrants returning to Brazil. For instance, of those who reported residing in another country less than 10 years before the 2000 census, 66.9 percent were Brazilians. If only the returning migrants (former Brazilian immigrants) are considered, 26.8 percent of Brazilians came from Paraguay, 17 percent came from Japan, and 15.8 percent came from the United States.[37]\n\n\nAs political unrest, increasing violence, inflation, soaring unemployment rates and an economic crisis hit Brazil, millions of citizens moved abroad starting in 2011, generating the largest emigration process ever witnessed in Brazilian history, since Brazil has historically been a land of immigrants. In 2021 more than 4.4 million Brazilians live abroad,[38] this is an increase of around 132% compared to the previous 10 years.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe largest Brazilian community abroad - comprising almost half of the diaspora - is the one in the US, where around 2,000,000 Brazilians live; they are present especially in Florida. Almost 300,000 Brazilians - hence 6.8% of all Brazilians living abroad - lived in other Portuguese-speaking countries (94% in Portugal). In the same year around 680,000 Brazilians - hence 15.5% of the Brazilian diaspora - lived in Spanish-speaking countries, with the majority found in neighbouring countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\n\nOther major communities are found in countries such as the UK (220,000 Brazilians in 2021), Canada (122,500 Brazilians in 2021) Ireland (70,000 Brazilians in 2021) and Australia (60,000 Brazilians in 2021).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nS√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are far larger than any other Brazilian cities. S√£o Paulo's influence in most economic aspects can be noted in a national (and even international) scale; Rio de Janeiro ‚Äì partially due to its former status as the national capital ‚Äì still host various large corporations' headquarters, besides being Brazil's cultural center with respect to film production and other such televised media. Bras√≠lia, the capital of Brazil, is its 3rd biggest city.\n\n\n\n## Migration[edit]\n\n\n### Summary[edit]\n\n\nThe United Nations reported in the International Migration Stock that 64 countries had significant emigration or immigration with Brazil in 2020.[26][27] The Migration Policy Institute defines significant migration if 1,000+ people are in the emigration or/and migration group.[28] Venezuela, Haiti, Portugal, Bolivia, and Uruguay have the most positive net migration, while the United States, Japan, Spain, Italy, and France have the most negative net migration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Years | 1961 | 1962 | 1963 | 1964 | 1965 | 1966 | 1967 | 1968 | 1969 | 1970[16] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total fertility rate in Brazil | 6.05 | 6 | 5.94 | 5.85 | 5.73 | 5.6 | 5.45 | 5.3 | 5.15 | 5.01\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Years | 1971 | 1972 | 1973 | 1974 | 1975 | 1976 | 1977 | 1978 | 1979 | 1980[16] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total fertility rate in Brazil | 4.88 | 4.76 | 4.65 | 4.55 | 4.46 | 4.39 | 4.31 | 4.24 | 4.16 | 4.07\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Years | 1981 | 1982 | 1983 | 1984 | 1985 | 1986 | 1987 | 1988 | 1989 | 1990[16] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total fertility rate in Brazil | 3.97 | 3.86 | 3.74 | 3.62 | 3.49 | 3.36 | 3.23 | 3.11 | 3.01 | 2.91\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. **^** \"Venetian or Talian\".

The Portuguese came to explore the precious stones that were found there. Contact between the Portuguese and the Indians created a mixed-race population. Until the mid-20th century, Central-West Brazil had a very small population. The situation changed with the construction of Bras√≠lia, the new capital of Brazil, in 1960. Many workers were attracted to the region, mostly from northeastern Brazil.\n\n\nA new wave of settlers started arriving from the 1970s. With the mechanization of agriculture in the South of Brazil, many rural workers of German and Italian origin migrated to Central-West Brazil. In some areas, they are already the majority of the population.\n\n\n\n## Education and health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Brazil and Health care in Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_rl7i2IO15qrMyxT0IcUmEL3h","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Among these, Semitic speakers often collectively refer to themselves as the Habesha people. The Arabic form of this term (*al-·∏§abasha*) is the etymological basis of \"Abyssinia\", the former name of Ethiopia in English and other European languages.[4] Additionally, Nilo-Saharan-speaking ethnic minorities inhabit the southern regions of the country, particularly in areas of the Gambela Region which borders South Sudan. The largest ethnic groups among these include the Nuer and Anuak.[*citation needed*]The Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region, being an amalgam of the main homelands of numerous ethnicities, contains over 56 indigenous ethnic groups.[5]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOromo serves as one of the official working languages of Ethiopia[9][10][11] and is also the working language of several of the states within the Ethiopian federal system including Oromia,[12] Harar and Dire Dawa regional states and of the Oromia Zone in the Amhara Region.\n\n\n\n## Modern contraception utilization[edit]\n\n\nOnly 28.1% within the ages of 15‚Äì49 years used modern contraceptives, according to the data from 2019 Ethiopian Mini Demographic and Health Survey.[13]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Ethiopia\n| Religion in Ethiopia in 2015 by ARDA[14] |\n| --- |\n| Ethiopian Orthodox |  | 42.1% |\n| Islam |  | 34.6% |\n| Protestant |  | 20.8% |\n| Traditional faiths |  | 1.4% |\n| Roman Catholic |  | 0.6% |\n| Other and No religion |  | 0.1% |\n|  |  |  |\nVarious religions are adhered to in Ethiopia.

Together, these four groups make up about three-quarters of Ethiopia's population. Other Afroasiatic languages with a significant number of speakers include the Cushitic Sidamo, Afar, Hadiyya and Agaw languages, as well as the Semitic Gurage languages, Harari, Silt'e, and Argobba languages. Arabic, which also belongs to the Afroasiatic family, is likewise spoken in some areas.[8]\n\n\nThe principal Semitic language of the north-west and centre of the country is Amharic, which is the language of the Amhara Region. Moreover, Amharic is also one of the official working languages of Ethiopia.[9][10][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Glottolog 4.8 - Languages of Ethiopia\". *glottolog.org*.

It is the largest Spanish-speaking country in the world and the third-most populous country in the Americas after the United States and Brazil.[5] Throughout most of the 20th century Mexico's population was characterized by rapid growth. Although this tendency has been reversed and average annual population growth over the last five years was less than 1%, the demographic transition is still in progress; Mexico still has a large youth cohort. The most populous city in the country is the capital, Mexico City, with a population of 8.9¬†million (2016), and its metropolitan area is also the most populated with 20.1¬†million (2010). Approximately 50% of the population lives in one of the 55 large metropolitan areas in the country. In total, about 78.84% of the population of the country lives in urban areas, and only about 21.16% in rural ones.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 8 | Quer√©taro | Quer√©taro | 1,594,212 | 18 | Morelia | Michoac√°n | 988,704\n |\n| 9 | Ju√°rez | Chihuahua | 1,512,450 | 19 | Chihuahua | Chihuahua | 988,065\n |\n| 10 | La Laguna | Coahuila, Durango | 1,434,283 | 20 | Veracruz | Veracruz | 939,046\n |\n\n\n\n\n\n## Other demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mexican mestizo population is the most diverse of all the mestizo groups of Latin America, with its mestizos being either largely European or Amerindian rather than having a uniform admixture.[83] Distribution of Admixture Estimates for Individuals from Mexico City and Quetalmahue (indigenous community in Chile).\n![](image)Regional variation of ancestry according to a study made by Ruiz-Linares in 2014, each dot represents a volunteer, with most coming from south Mexico and Mexico City.[84]\n![](image)Trivate for ancestry, from the same study as the image above.[84]\nDemographic statistics according to the 2022 World Population Review.[85]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Place | Foreign-born population in Mexico | 2020\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image)¬†United States | 797,266\n |\n| 2 | ![](image)¬†Guatemala | 56,810\n |\n| 3 | ![](image)¬†Venezuela | 52,948\n |\n| 4 | ![](image)¬†Colombia | 36,234\n |\n| 5 | ![](image)¬†Honduras | 35,361\n |\n| 6 | ![](image)¬†Cuba | 25,976\n |\n| 7 | ![](image)¬†Spain | 20,763\n |\n| 8 | ![](image)¬†El Salvador | 19,736\n |\n| 9 | ![](image)¬†Argentina | 18,693\n |\n| 10 | ![](image)¬†Canada | 12,439\n |\n| 11 | ![](image)¬†China | 10,547\n |\n| 12 | ![](image)¬†France | 9,080\n |\n| 13 | ![](image)¬†Brazil | 8,689\n |\n| 14 | ![](image)¬†Peru | 8,670\n |\n| 15 | ![](image)¬†Germany | 6,860\n |\n| 16 | ![](image)¬†Italy | 6,619\n |\n| 17 | ![](image)¬†Chile | 6,532\n |\n| 18 | ![](image)¬†Haiti | 5,895\n |\n| 19 | ![](image)¬†Nicaragua | 5,731\n |\n| 20 | ![](image)¬†Japan | 5,539\n |\n| 21 | ![](image)¬†South Korea | 5,339\n |\n| 22 | ![](image)¬†United Kingdom | 4,030\n |\n| 23 | ![](image)¬†Ecuador | 3,995\n |\n| 24 | ![](image)¬†Costa Rica | 3,803\n |\n| 25 | ![](image)¬†Dominican Republic | 2,849\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHistorically, population studies and censuses have never been up to the standards that a population as diverse and numerous such as Mexico's require: the first racial census was made in 1793, being also Mexico's (then known as New Spain) first ever nationwide population census.

The five most populous federal entities in 2005 were the State of Mexico (14.4¬†million), Mexico City (8.7¬†million), Veracruz (7.1¬†million), Jalisco (6.7¬†million) and Puebla (5.4¬†million), which collectively contain 40.7% of the national population.

The most populous metropolitan area in Mexico is the *Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico*, or Greater Mexico City, which in 2005 had a population of 19.23¬†million, or 19% of the nation's population. The next four largest metropolitan areas in Mexico are Greater Guadalajara (4.1¬†million), Greater Monterrey (3.7¬†million), Greater Puebla (2.1¬†million) and Greater Toluca (1.6¬†million),[81] whose added population, along with Greater Mexico City, is equivalent to 30% of the nation's population. Greater Mexico City was the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country since the 1930s until the late 1980s. Since then, the country has slowly become economically and demographically less centralized. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. **^** \"As Spain's Economy Worsens, Young Adults Flock to Mexico for Jobs ‚Äì New America Media\". *newamericamedia.org*.

A city is defined to be a settlement with more than 2,500 inhabitants. In 2005 there were 2,640 cities with a population between 2,500 and 15,000 inhabitants, 427 with a population between 15,000 and 100,000 inhabitants, 112 with a population between 100,000 and one million, and 11 with a population of more than one million.[79] All cities are considered \"urban areas\" and represent 76.5% of total population.

While Mexico is now transitioning to the third phase of demographic transition, close to 50% of the population in 2009 was 25 years old or younger.[8] Fertility rates have also decreased from 5.7 children per woman in 1976 to 2.2 in 2006.[9] After decades of the gap narrowing, in 2020 the fertility rate in Mexico fell below the United States for the first time falling 22% in 2020 and a further 10.5% in the first half of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Federative Units\n | Mestizo Population (%)\n | Amerindian Population (%)\n | White Population (%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Aguascalientes | 66.12%\n | 16.70%\n | 16.77%\n |\n| Baja California(Distrito Norte) | 72.50%\n | 07.72%\n | 00.35%\n |\n| Baja California(Distrito Sur) | 59.61%\n | 06.06%\n | 33.40%\n |\n| Campeche | 41.45%\n | 43.41%\n | 14.17%\n |\n| Coahuila | 77.88%\n | 11.38%\n | 10.13%\n |\n| Colima | 68.54%\n | 26.00%\n | 04.50%\n |\n| Chiapas | 36.27%\n | 47.64%\n | 11.82%\n |\n| Chihuahua | 50.09%\n | 12.76%\n | 36.33%\n |\n| Durango | 89.85%\n | 09.99%\n | 00.01%\n |\n| Guanajuato | 96.33%\n | 02.96%\n | 00.54%\n |\n| Guerrero | 54.05%\n | 43.84%\n | 02.07%\n |\n| Hidalgo | 51.47%\n | 39.49%\n | 08.83%\n |\n| Jalisco | 75.83%\n | 16.76%\n | 07.31%\n |\n| Mexico City | 54.78%\n | 18.75%\n | 22.79%\n |\n| State of Mexico | 47.71%\n | 42.13%\n | 10.02%\n |\n| Michoac√°n | 70.95%\n | 21.04%\n | 06.94%\n |\n| Morelos | 61.24%\n | 34.93%\n | 03.59%\n |\n| Nayarit | 73.45%\n | 20.38%\n | 05.83%\n |\n| Nuevo Le√≥n | 75.47%\n | 05.14%\n | 19.23%\n |\n| Oaxaca | 28.15%\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ¬±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1865  | 8,259,080[6] | ‚Äî¬†¬†¬†¬† |\n| 1895  | 12,700,294 | +1.44% |\n| 1900  | 13,607,272 | +1.39% |\n| 1910  | 15,160,369 | +1.09% |\n| 1921  | 14,334,780 | ‚àí0.51% |\n| 1930  | 16,552,722 | +1.61% |\n| 1940  | 19,653,552 | +1.73% |\n| 1950  | 25,791,017 | +2.75% |\n| 1960  | 34,923,129 | +3.08% |\n| 1970  | 48,225,238 | +3.28% |\n| 1980  | 66,846,833 | +3.32% |\n| 1990  | 81,249,645 | +1.97% |\n| 2000  | 97,483,412 | +1.84% |\n| 2010  | 112,336,538 | +1.43% |\n| 2020  | 126,014,024 | +1.16% |\n| Source: INEGI |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image)¬†Costa Rica | 2,327[74] | 17 | North America\n |\n| ![](image)¬†Panama | 2,299[75] | 18 | North America\n |\n| ![](image)¬†Colombia | 2,286[76] | 19 | South America\n |\n| ![](image)¬†Chile | 1,874[77] | 20 | South America\n |\n| ![](image)¬†Paraguay | 1,778[78] | 21 | South America\n |\n| The list includes also temporary residents (1‚Äì3 years' stay) |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMexican diaspora\n |\n| --- |\n| Americas | * Argentina\n* Belize\n* Brazil\n* Canada\n* Chile\n* Costa Rica\n* Cuba\n* El Salvador\n* Guatemala\n* Honduras\n* Panama\n* Paraguay\n* United States\n |\n| Asia | * Israel\n* Japan\n* Philippines\n |\n| Europe | * France\n* Germany\n* Italy\n* Netherlands\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* United Kingdom\n |\n| Oceania | * Australia\n* New Zealand\n |\n\n## Cities and metropolitan areas[edit]\n\n\n### Settlements, cities and municipalities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of cities in Mexico\n\nSee also: Municipalities of Mexico\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_ZPYo17KWyUxeDu4cQiuMmIez","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

This ratio stands at 1.05 at birth, 1.04 from 15 to 24 years old, 1.02 from 25 to 54 years old, .88 from 55 to 64 years old, and .77 for those 65 years or older.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSpanish is the official, national language, spoken by virtually all Hondurans. In addition to Spanish, a number of indigenous languages are spoken in some small communities. Other languages spoken by some include Honduran sign language and Bay Islands Creole English.[118]\n\n\nThe main indigenous languages are:\n\n\n\n* Garifuna (Arawakan) (almost 100,000 speakers in Honduras including monolinguals)\n* M√≠skito (Misumalpan) (29,000 speakers in Honduras)\n* Mayangna (Misumalpan) (less than 1000 speakers in Honduras, more in Nicaragua)\n* Pech/Paya, (Chibchan) (less than 1000 speakers)\n* Tol (Jicaquean) (less than 500 speakers)\n* Ch'orti' (Mayan) (less than 50 speakers)\n\n\nThe Lenca isolate lost all its fluent native speakers in the 20th century but is currently undergoing revival efforts among the members of the ethnic population of about 100,000. The largest immigrant languages are Arabic (42,000), Armenian (1,300), Turkish (900), Yue Chinese (1,000).[118]\n\n\n\n### Largest cities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe nation's economy is primarily agricultural, making it especially vulnerable to natural disasters such as Hurricane Mitch in 1998.[9] The lower class is primarily agriculturally based while wealth is concentrated in the country's urban centers.[10] Honduras has a Human Development Index of 0.625, classifying it as a nation with medium development.[11] When adjusted for income inequality, its Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index is 0.443.[11]\n\n\nHonduran society is predominantly Mestizo; however, there are also significant Indigenous Americans, black and white communities in Honduras.[12] The nation had a relatively high political stability until its 2009 coup and again with the 2017 presidential election.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. **^** \"Chapter XXVI: Disarmament¬†‚Äì No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons\".

Honduras has one of the highest national murder rates in the world; cities such as San Pedro Sula and the Tegucigalpa likewise have registered homicide rates among the highest in the world. The violence is associated with drug trafficking as Honduras is often a transit point, and with a number of urban gangs, mainly the MS-13 and the 18th Street gang. Homicide violence reached a peak in 2012 with an average of 20 homicides a day.[130] Official statistics from the Honduran Observatory on National Violence show Honduras's homicide rate was 60 per 100,000 in 2015 with the majority of homicide cases unprosecuted.[131] But as recently as 2017, organizations such as InSight Crime's show figures of 42 per 100,000 inhabitants,[132] a 26% drop from 2016 figures.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHonduras has rain forests, cloud forests (which can rise up to nearly 3,000 metres or 9,800 feet above sea level), mangroves, savannas and mountain ranges with pine and oak trees, and the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. In the Bay Islands there are bottlenose dolphins, manta rays, parrot fish, schools of blue tang and whale shark.\n\n\nDeforestation resulting from logging is rampant in Olancho Department. The clearing of land for agriculture is prevalent in the largely undeveloped La Mosquitia region, causing land degradation and soil erosion. Honduras had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.48/10, ranking it 126th globally out of 172 countries.[62]\n\n\nLake Yojoa, which is Honduras's largest source of fresh water, is polluted by heavy metals produced from mining activities.[63] Some rivers and streams are also polluted by mining.[64]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Honduras\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** *Objetivos de desarrollo del milenio, Honduras 2010: tercer informe de pa√≠s* [*Millennium Development Goals, Honduras 2010: Third Country Report*] (PDF) (in Spanish).
