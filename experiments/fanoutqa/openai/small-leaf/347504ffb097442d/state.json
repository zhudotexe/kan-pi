Over the previous fifty seasons, they had tallied five 100-win seasons, tying the Los Angeles Dodgers and trailing only the Atlanta Braves (7) and New York Yankees (10).[224]\nThe following accomplishments were rate-statistic qualifying records for a 162-game season, and in second place inclusive of all qualifying seasons:\n* Astros pitching registered a 2.90 earned run average (ERA), a franchise record over a 162-game season, Only the 1981 club posted a lower ERA, at 2.66, over an entire season, which was shortened to 110 games due to the players\u2019 strike.[225] Maldonado was recognized with the 2022 Darryl Kile Award due in large part to his work handling the pitching staff.[226]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHouston Astros 2022 World Series champions\n |\n| --- |\n| 2 Alex Bregman\n3 Jeremy Pe\u00f1a (ALCS & World Series MVP)\n9 Christian V\u00e1zquez\n10 Yuli Gurriel\n14 Mauricio Dub\u00f3n\n15 Mart\u00edn Maldonado\n16 Aledmys D\u00edaz\n17 David Hensley\n20 Chas McCormick\n26 Trey Mancini\n27 Jos\u00e9 Altuve\n30 Kyle Tucker\n35 Justin Verlander (AL CYA)\n38 Korey Lee\n43 Lance McCullers\n44 Yordan \u00c1lvarez\n45 Ryne Stanek\n47 Rafael Montero\n50 H\u00e9ctor Neris\n51 Will Smith\n52 Bryan Abreu\n53 Cristian Javier\n55 Ryan Pressly\n58 Hunter Brown\n59 Framber Valdez\n65 Jos\u00e9 Urquidy\n77 Luis Garc\u00eda\n |\n| Manager\n12 Dusty Baker\nCoaches\nBench 19 Joe Espada\nFirst base 22 Omar L\u00f3pez\nThird base 8 Gary Pettis\nHitting 37 Alex Cintr\u00f3n\nAssistant Hitting 46 Troy Snitker\nPitching 41 Bill Murphy\nBullpen 36 Josh Miller\nQuality control 54 Dan Firova\nCatching Coach 29 Michael Collins\nBullpen catcher 85 Javier Bracamonte\n |\n| Regular season\nAmerican League Division Series\nAmerican League Championship Series\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Houston Astros entered the 2022 MLB season as runners-up in the 2021 World Series championship, falling to the Atlanta Braves in six games. It was the Astros' third World Series appearance in five years, including a route to their fifth consecutive American League (AL) Championship Series. They had won the AL West division with 95\u201367 record, their fourth division championship in five seasons.\n\n\n\n#### Personnel[edit]\n\n\nOn November 3, 2021, the day following the ending of the World Series, seven Astros were declared free agents, including Carlos Correa, Yimi Garc\u00eda, Marwin Gonz\u00e1lez, Kendall Graveman, Zack Greinke, Brooks Raley, and Justin Verlander.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \u2190\u00a02021 | **Seasons** | 2023\u00a0\u2192 |\n\n |\n\n\nThe **2022 Houston Astros season** was the 61st season for the Houston Astros, a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise located in Houston, Texas, their 58th as the Astros, 10th in both the American League (AL) and AL West division, and 23rd at Minute Maid Park. The Astros entered the season as both the defending AL and AL West champions, and they looked to avenge their 2021 World Series loss to the Atlanta Braves in six games.\n\n\nThe collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between MLB and the MLB Players Association (MLBPA) expired on December 1, 2021. With no new agreement in place, Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred announced a lockout of players the following day. On March 10, 2022, MLB and MLBPA agreed to a new CBA, thus ending the lockout. Opening Day, originally scheduled for March 31, instead took place on April 7, and a full 162-game season was played.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn Game 4, Javier, Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero, and Pressly all combined for a no-hitter, just the second in World Series history. On November 5, they beat the Phillies 4-1 in Game 6 at Minute Maid Park to win their second world championship and first since 2017. A historic bullpen that allowed just five earned runs all postseason was boosted by contributions by players such as Jeremy Pe\u00f1a (ALCS and World Series MVP) and Yordan Alvarez (who had go-ahead home runs in three of the eleven Astro postseason wins). Dusty Baker earned his first championship as a manager with the win. The Astros became the first team to have a winning percentage of .622 (or better) in a six-season span (2017-2022) with multiple World Series titles since the 1953-1958 New York Yankees, and they became the sixth team since 1960 to win the World Series after losing it the previous year.\n[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\n### Summary of Astros' offseason[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **may be too long to read and navigate comfortably**.

On September 19, the Astros clinched the AL West, their fifth division title in the last six seasons. This made them the first team to win the AL West five times in six years since the Anaheim Angels from 2004 to 2009. They swept Seattle in the Division Series to reach the AL Championship Series (ALCS) for a sixth straight season, in doing so becoming the first team in major league history to win a postseason series in six consecutive seasons.[2] They swept the New York Yankees in the ALCS and defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in six games in the World Series, becoming just the third team after the 1995 Atlanta Braves and the 2019 Washington Nationals to sweep the LCS since it became a best-of-seven-game series and subsequently win the World Series. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n221. **^** \"Pe\u00f1a homers, drives in 3 to lead Astros over Rays 3\u20131\". *ESPN.com*.

The Braves were managed by Brian Snitker, in his sixth season as the team\u2019s manager. The Braves clinched their fourth consecutive National League East division title. They defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in the Division Series and faced the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Championship Series for the second straight year. They defeated the Dodgers in six games to reach the World Series for the first time since 1999. They would go on to defeat the Houston Astros in six games, winning their first World Series since 1995, their second since moving to Atlanta, and their fourth in franchise history. Jorge Soler won the Most Valuable Player award in the World Series.\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\n### November[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMajor League Baseball team season\n\n\n\n| 2021\u00a0Atlanta Braves |\n| --- |\n| World Series Champions National League Champions National League East Division Champions |\n| ![](image) |\n| League | National League |\n| Division | Eastern Division |\n| Ballpark | Truist Park |\n| City | Atlanta |\n| Record | 88\u201373 (.547) |\n| Divisional place | 1st |\n| Owners | Liberty Media/John Malone |\n| General managers | Alex Anthopoulos |\n| Managers | Brian Snitker |\n| Television | Bally Sports SoutheastBally Sports South(Chip Caray, Jeff Francoeur, Paul Byrd, Tom Glavine, Dale Murphy, Joe Simpson, Kelly Crull) |\n| Radio | 680 The FanRock 100.5 Atlanta Braves Radio Network(Ben Ingram, Jim Powell, Joe Simpson)1600 La Mejor(Daniel Cant\u00fa, Emanuel Zamarr\u00f3n) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \u2190\u00a02020 | **Seasons** | 2022\u00a0\u2192 |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAtlanta Braves 2021 World Series champions\n |\n| --- |\n| 1 Ozzie Albies\n5 Freddie Freeman\n7 Dansby Swanson\n8 Eddie Rosario (NLCS MVP)\n9 Orlando Arcia\n11 Terrance Gore\n12 Jorge Soler (World Series MVP)\n14 Adam Duvall\n16 Travis d'Arnaud\n18 Drew Smyly\n22 Joc Pederson\n23 Ehire Adrianza\n24 William Contreras\n27 Austin Riley\n30 Kyle Wright\n33 A.

The last such Dodgers start came in 1977, along with the Brooklyn teams in 1888 and 1955. This was also the best 40-game start in the majors since the 116-win Mariners began 31\u20139 in 2001.[4] The Dodgers led MLB in runs scored (349), home runs (118) and slugging percentage (.483, tied with the Atlanta Braves).[5] The Dodgers finished the regular season 43\u201317, winning their eighth straight division title, and swept both the Milwaukee Brewers in the 2020 National League Wild Card Series and the San Diego Padres in the 2020 National League Division Series. They then defeated the Braves in the 2020 National League Championship Series to advance to the 2020 World Series against the Tampa Bay Rays, their third World Series appearance in the last four years and their 24th pennant in franchise history, surpassing the San Francisco Giants for the most in the National League. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLos Angeles Dodgers 2020 World Series champions\n |\n| --- |\n| 3 Chris Taylor\n5 Corey Seager (NLCS and World Series MVP)\n7 Julio Ur\u00edas\n10 Justin Turner\n11 A.

The Nationals won their first ever National League pennant on October 15, and eventually won their first World Series in franchise history on October 30, becoming the seventh Wild Card team to win the World Series.

An investigation into the allegation stated that the sign stealing was \"limited in scope and impact,\" but nonetheless resulted in the suspension of a team video replay operator and the loss of a second-round draft pick in the 2020 draft for the organization.[1] Regardless, the team has been considered the best MLB team of the 2010s, one of the best Red Sox teams ever, and one of the best baseball teams since the 1998 New York Yankees.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\n### October 2017[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2018\n |\n| Wild card berths (8) | * 1998\n* 1999\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2021\n |\n| Minor league affiliates | * Triple-A\n\t+ Worcester Red Sox\n* Double-A\n\t+ Portland Sea Dogs\n* High-A\n\t+ Greenville Drive\n* Single-A\n\t+ Salem Red Sox\n* Rookie\n\t+ FCL Red Sox\n\t+ DSL Red Sox\n |\n| Broadcasting | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Television | * New England Sports Network (NESN)\n |\n| Radio | * WEEI-FM\n* Radio network affiliates\n |\n| Broadcasters | * Dave O'Brien\n* Dennis Eckersley\n* Joe Castiglione\n* Tom Caron\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Red Sox' 16\u20131 defeat of the Yankees in Game 3, during a misty evening in The Bronx, included two historical footnotes. Firstly, the fifteen-run margin of victory for Boston accounted for the Yankees' worst-ever postseason defeat.[64] The Red Sox failed to score in only the first, fifth, and sixth innings, and generated 7 of their 16 runs in the fourth inning, chasing starter Luis Severino and batting through the order. In addition, Brock Holt hit for the cycle, the first player ever to do so in an MLB postseason game, capping off his performance with a ninth-inning home run against catcher Austin Romine, brought in to pitch when the New York bullpen was overtaxed.[65]\n\n\n\n![](image)Chris Sale got the win at Fenway in Game 1.\n![](image)Xander Bogaerts hit Boston's only home run in Game 2.\n![](image)Brock Holt hit the first postseason cycle in MLB history in Game 3.\n![](image)Boston starter Rick Porcello got the win in Game 4, sending the Red Sox to the ALCS.\nGame 1, October 5 at Fenway Park\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA 5\u20133 win in the first game of the series gave Boston a 71\u201331 record, reaching 40 games over .500 for the first time since their 1949 season.[47] Rick Porcello pitched six scoreless innings for the win, while Mitch Moreland hit his 12th home run of the season. For the second game of the series, the Red Sox activated Drew Pomeranz from the disabled list; he took the mound for the first time since May 31. Pomeranz allowed four runs in 4+2\u20443 innings, taking the loss as Baltimore prevailed, 7\u20136. Trailing 7\u20133 after five innings, Boston scored twice in the eighth and once in the ninth to nearly force extra innings. J. D. Martinez had two home runs, increasing his total to 31 for the season; Blake Swihart and Mookie Betts had one each. The third and final game of the series was postponed, due to rain. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDavid Price threw a 95-pitch complete game in the first game of the series, as the Red Sox won, 6\u20132. Baltimore's only runs came on a Manny Machado two-run homer with two outs in the ninth. With the win, the Red Sox became the first MLB team to reach 30 wins in the 2018 season. The second game of the series was tied at one in the top of the fourth with two outs, when Baltimore scored four runs off of Boston starter Drew Pomeranz. Despite a 3-for-5 effort from Mookie Betts, including his 14th home run of the season, the Red Sox could not make up the deficit; final score 7\u20134 for the Orioles. In the third game of the series, the Red Sox broke a 1\u20131 tie with three runs in the fifth inning, on back-to-back home runs from Betts (with Sandy Le\u00f3n on base) and Andrew Benintendi. Craig Kimbrel earned his 13th save of the season in closing out the 6\u20133 victory. In the final game of the series, a pair of J.

There was no further scoring until the Red Sox scored one run in each of the sixth, seventh, and eighth innings. Price, pitching on short rest, held the Dodgers to one run on three hits in seven innings. The game ended in a 5\u20131 final for Boston, the franchise's fourth World Series championship in 15 years. Price got the win, his second of the World Series and third of the postseason. Pearce had three RBIs on two home runs in the game, giving him a total of three home runs and eight RBIs in the series\u2014he was named World Series MVP. The team's motto during the season, \"do damage\",[67] became \"damage done\" upon their victory.[68]\n\n\n\nGame 1, October 23 at Fenway Park\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Infielders**\n* 2 Xander Bogaerts\n* 11 Rafael Devers\n* 12 Brock Holt\n* 5 Ian Kinsler\n* 5,30 Tzu-Wei Lin\n* 18 Mitch Moreland\n* 36 Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez\n* 25 Steve Pearce\n* 0 Brandon Phillips\n* 15 Dustin Pedroia\n* 13 Hanley Ram\u00edrez\n* 38 Tony Renda\n* 59 Sam Travis\n |  | **Outfielders*** 16 Andrew Benintendi\n* 50 Mookie Betts\n* 19 Jackie Bradley Jr.\n* 28 J.
