In his subsequent experiments, he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of electrolysis. He produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named it *boracium*.[10] Gay-Lussac and Thénard used iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures. By oxidizing boron with air, they showed that boric acid is its oxidation product.[9][17] Jöns Jacob Berzelius identified it as an element in 1824.[18] Pure boron was arguably first produced by the American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub in 1909.[19][20][21]\n\n\n\n## Preparation of elemental boron in the laboratory[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Davy H (1809). \"An account of some new analytical researches on the nature of certain bodies, particularly the alkalies, phosphorus, sulphur, carbonaceous matter, and the acids hitherto undecomposed: with some general observations on chemical theory\". *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London*. **99**: 39–104. doi:10.1098/rstl.1809.0005.\n11. **^** \"Q & A: Where does the element Boron come from?\". *physics.illinois.edu*.

Consensus on it as essential for mammalian life is lacking. Borates have low toxicity in mammals (similar to table salt) but are more toxic to arthropods and are occasionally used as insecticides. Boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Although only traces are required, it is an essential plant nutrient.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe word *boron* was coined from *borax*, the mineral from which it was isolated, by analogy with *carbon*, which boron resembles chemically.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn humans, boron is usually consumed with food that contains boron, such as fruits, leafy vegetables, and nuts.[153] Foods that are particularly rich in boron include avocados, dried fruits such as raisins, peanuts, pecans, prune juice, grape juice, wine and chocolate powder.[155][153] According to 2-day food records from the respondents to the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), adult dietary intake was recorded at 0.9 to 1.4 mg/day.[157]\n\n\nIn 2013, a hypothesis suggested it was possible that boron and molybdenum catalyzed the production of RNA on Mars with life being transported to Earth via a meteorite around 3 billion years ago.[158]\n\n\nThere exist several known boron-containing natural antibiotics.[159] The first one found was boromycin, isolated from streptomyces in the 1960s.[160][161] Others are tartrolons, a group of antibiotics discovered in the 1990s from culture broth of the myxobacterium *Sorangium cellulosum*.[162]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n|  |\n| ![](image) Category: Boron* view\n* talk\n* edit\n | references |\n\n\n**Boron** is a chemical element; it has symbol **B** and atomic number 5. In its crystalline form it is a brittle, dark, lustrous metalloid; in its amorphous form it is a brown powder. As the lightest element of the boron group it has three valence electrons for forming covalent bonds, resulting in many compounds such as boric acid, the mineral sodium borate, and the ultra-hard crystals of boron carbide and boron nitride.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 5 September 2017, scientists reported that the *Curiosity* rover detected boron, an essential ingredient for life on Earth, on the planet Mars. Such a finding, along with previous discoveries that water may have been present on ancient Mars, further supports the possible early habitability of Gale Crater on Mars.[71][72]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nEconomically important sources of boron are the minerals colemanite, rasorite (kernite), ulexite and tincal. Together these constitute 90% of mined boron-containing ore. The largest global borax deposits known, many still untapped, are in Central and Western Turkey, including the provinces of Eskişehir, Kütahya and Balıkesir.[73][74][75] Global proven boron mineral mining reserves exceed one billion metric tonnes, against a yearly production of about four million tonnes.[76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n170. **^** Zekri, Mongi; Obreza, Tom. \"Boron (B) and Chlorine (Cl) for Citrus Trees\" (PDF). *IFAS Extension*.

Most studies of \"boron\" involve samples that contain small amounts of carbon. The chemical behavior of boron resembles that of silicon more than aluminium. Crystalline boron is chemically inert and resistant to attack by boiling hydrofluoric or hydrochloric acid. When finely divided, it is attacked slowly by hot concentrated hydrogen peroxide, hot concentrated nitric acid, hot sulfuric acid or hot mixture of sulfuric and chromic acids.[20]\n\n\nThe rate of oxidation of boron depends on the crystallinity, particle size, purity and temperature.

The mass difference results in a wide range of δ11B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the 11B and 10B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron; the shortest-lived isotope is 7B which decays through proton emission and alpha decay with a half-life of 3.5×10−22 s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH)3 and [B(OH)4]−. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H2O phase changes in hydrothermal systems, and during hydrothermal alteration of rock. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the [10B(OH)4]− ion onto clays. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n66. **^** Yu, J.; Chen, Y.; Elliman, R. G.; Petravic, M.

More than one hundred borate minerals contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although it is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, boron minerals never contain it with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na+) in borax.[42] The tourmaline group of borate-silicates is also a very important boron-bearing mineral group, and a number of borosilicates are also known to exist naturally.[47]\n\n\n\n##### Boranes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Boranes\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nElemental boron is a metalloid that is found in small amounts in meteoroids, but chemically uncombined boron is not otherwise found naturally on Earth. Industrially, the very pure element is produced with difficulty because of contamination by carbon or other elements that resist removal.[13] Several allotropes exist: amorphous boron is a brown powder; crystalline boron is silvery to black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the Mohs scale), and a poor electrical conductor at room temperature. The primary use of the element itself is as boron filaments with applications similar to carbon fibers in some high-strength materials.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTurkey and the United States are the largest producers of boron products. Turkey produces about half of the global yearly demand, through Eti Mine Works (Turkish: *Eti Maden İşletmeleri*) a Turkish state-owned mining and chemicals company focusing on boron products. It holds a government monopoly on the mining of borate minerals in Turkey, which possesses 72% of the world's known deposits.[77] In 2012, it held a 47% share of production of global borate minerals, ahead of its main competitor, Rio Tinto Group.[78]\n\n\nAlmost a quarter (23%) of global boron production comes from the single Rio Tinto Borax Mine (also known as the U.S. Borax Boron Mine) 35°2′34.447″N 117°40′45.412″W﻿ / ﻿35.04290194°N 117.67928111°W﻿ / 35.04290194; -117.67928111﻿ (Rio Tinto Borax Mine) near Boron, California.[79][80]\n\n\n\n### Market trend[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A fragment of ulexite\n![](image)Borax crystals\nBoron is rare in the Universe and solar system due to trace formation in the Big Bang and in stars. It is formed in minor amounts in cosmic ray spallation nucleosynthesis and may be found uncombined in cosmic dust and meteoroid materials.\n\n\nIn the high oxygen environment of Earth, boron is always found fully oxidized to borate. Boron does not appear on Earth in elemental form. Extremely small traces of elemental boron were detected in Lunar regolith.[69][70]\n\n\nAlthough boron is a relatively rare element in the Earth's crust, representing only 0.001% of the crust mass, it can be highly concentrated by the action of water, in which many borates are soluble.\nIt is found naturally combined in compounds such as borax and boric acid (sometimes found in volcanic spring waters). About a hundred borate minerals are known.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe average cost of crystalline elemental boron is US$5/g.[81] Elemental boron is chiefly used in making boron fibers, where it is deposited by chemical vapor deposition on a tungsten core (see below). Boron fibers are used in lightweight composite applications, such as high strength tapes. This use is a very small fraction of total boron use. Boron is introduced into semiconductors as boron compounds, by ion implantation.\n\n\nEstimated global consumption of boron (almost entirely as boron compounds) was about 4 million tonnes of B2O3 in 2012. As compounds such as borax and kernite its cost was US$377/tonne in 2019.[82] Boron mining and refining capacities are considered to be adequate to meet expected levels of growth through the next decade.\n\n\nThe form in which boron is consumed has changed in recent years. The use of ores like colemanite has declined following concerns over arsenic content. Consumers have moved toward the use of refined borates and boric acid that have a lower pollutant content.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe earliest routes to elemental boron involved the reduction of boric oxide with metals such as magnesium or aluminium. However, the product is almost always contaminated with borides of those metals.[*citation needed*] Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with hydrogen at high temperatures. Ultrapure boron for use in the semiconductor industry is produced by the decomposition of diborane at high temperatures and then further purified by the zone melting or Czochralski processes.[22]\n\n\nThe production of boron compounds does not involve the formation of elemental boron, but exploits the convenient availability of borates.\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n### Allotropes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Allotropes of boron\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_QI1sdZdp1feMI4mu9tkWDDjc","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Pogson,[15] and Lieutenant John Herschel,[16] and was subsequently confirmed by French astronomer Jules Janssen.[17] Janssen is often jointly credited with detecting the element, along with Norman Lockyer. Janssen recorded the helium spectral line during the solar eclipse of 1868, while Lockyer observed it from Britain. Lockyer was the first to propose that the line was due to a new element, which he named after the Sun. The formal discovery of the element was made in 1895 by chemists Sir William Ramsay, Per Teodor Cleve, and Nils Abraham Langlet, who found helium emanating from the uranium ore cleveite, which is now not regarded as a separate mineral species, but as a variety of uraninite.[18][19] In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in natural gas fields in parts of the United States, by far the largest supplier of the gas today.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn March 26, 1895, Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay isolated helium on Earth by treating the mineral cleveite (a variety of uraninite with at least 10% rare-earth elements) with mineral acids. Ramsay was looking for argon but, after separating nitrogen and oxygen from the gas, liberated by sulfuric acid, he noticed a bright yellow line that matched the D3 line observed in the spectrum of the Sun.[28][33][34][35] These samples were identified as helium by Lockyer and British physicist William Crookes.[36][37] It was independently isolated from cleveite, in the same year, by chemists, Per Teodor Cleve and Abraham Langlet, in Uppsala, Sweden, who collected enough of the gas to accurately determine its atomic weight.[38][39][26][40] Helium was also isolated by the American geochemist, William Francis Hillebrand, prior to Ramsay's discovery, when he noticed unusual spectral lines while testing a sample of the mineral uraninite. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHillebrand, however, attributed the lines to nitrogen.[41] His letter of congratulations to Ramsay offers an interesting case of discovery, and near-discovery, in science.[42]\n\n\nIn 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds demonstrated that alpha particles are helium nuclei, by allowing the particles to penetrate the thin, glass wall of an evacuated tube, then creating a discharge in the tube, to study the spectrum of the new gas inside.[43] In 1908, helium was first liquefied by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling the gas to less than 5 K (−268.15 °C; −450.67 °F).[44][45] He tried to solidify it, by further reducing the temperature, but failed, because helium does not solidify at atmospheric pressure. Onnes' student Willem Hendrik Keesom was eventually able to solidify 1 cm3 of helium in 1926 by applying additional external pressure.[46][47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** Hampel, Clifford A.

Most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation. Terrestrial helium is a non-renewable resource because once released into the atmosphere, it promptly escapes into space. Its supply is thought to be rapidly diminishing.[21][22] However, some studies suggest that helium produced deep in the Earth by radioactive decay can collect in natural gas reserves in larger-than-expected quantities,[23] in some cases having been released by volcanic activity.[24]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Scientific discoveries[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![Color lines in a spectral range](image)**Spectral lines of helium** |\n| Other properties |\n| Natural occurrence | primordial |\n| Crystal structure |  ​hexagonal close-packed (hcp)![Hexagonal close-packed crystal structure for helium](image)\n |\n| Thermal conductivity | 0.1513 W/(m⋅K)  |\n| Magnetic ordering | diamagnetic[4] |\n| Molar magnetic susceptibility | −1.88×10−6 cm3/mol (298 K)[5] |\n| Speed of sound | 972 m/s |\n| CAS Number | 7440-59-7  |\n| History |\n| Naming | after Helios, Greek god of the Sun |\n| Discovery | Norman Lockyer (1868) |\n| First isolation | William Ramsay, Per Teodor Cleve, Abraham Langlet (1895) |\n| Isotopes of helium* v\n* e\n |\n|  |\n| \n\n| Main isotopes[6] | Decay |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | abun­dance | half-life (*t*1/2) | mode | pro­duct |\n| 3He | 0.0002% | stable |\n| 4He | 99.9998% | stable\n |\n\n |\n|  |\n| ![](image) Category: Helium* view\n* talk\n* edit\n | references |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. **^** McFarland, D.

Helium is found in large amounts in minerals of uranium and thorium, including uraninite and its varieties cleveite and pitchblende,[18][130] carnotite and monazite (a group name; \"monazite\" usually refers to monazite-(Ce)),[131][132] because they emit alpha particles (helium nuclei, He2+) to which electrons immediately combine as soon as the particle is stopped by the rock. In this way an estimated 3000 metric tons of helium are generated per year throughout the lithosphere.[133][134][135] In the Earth's crust, the concentration of helium is 8 parts per billion. In seawater, the concentration is only 4 parts per trillion. There are also small amounts in mineral springs, volcanic gas, and meteoric iron. Because helium is trapped in the subsurface under conditions that also trap natural gas, the greatest natural concentrations of helium on the planet are found in natural gas, from which most commercial helium is extracted. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Helium** (from Greek: ἥλιος, romanized: *helios*, lit. 'sun') is a chemical element; it has symbol **He** and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas and the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table.[a] Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements, and it does not have a melting point at standard pressure. It is the second-lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe, after hydrogen. It is present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this in both the Sun and Jupiter, because of the very high nuclear binding energy (per nucleon) of helium-4, with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n131. **^** \"Monazite\". *Mindat.org*.

It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster. It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n199. **^** Furr, A. K. (2000). *CRC handbook of laboratory safety*.

The first major application of lithium was in high-temperature lithium greases for aircraft engines and similar applications in World War II and shortly after. This use was supported by the fact that lithium-based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps, and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps. The small demand for lithium soaps and lubricating greases was supported by several small mining operations, mostly in the US.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** Moores, S.

There are a fairly large number of both lithium mineral and brine deposits but only comparatively few of them are of actual or potential commercial value. Many are very small, others are too low in grade.\"[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor instance, studies of lithium-treated patients with bipolar disorder show that, among many other effects, lithium partially reverses telomere shortening in these patients and also increases mitochondrial function, although how lithium produces these pharmacological effects is not understood.[68][69]\nEven the exact mechanisms involved in lithium toxicity are not fully understood.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNuclear weapons manufacture and other nuclear physics applications are a major source of artificial lithium fractionation, with the light isotope 6Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles to such an extent that it has caused slight but measurable change in the 6Li to 7Li ratios in natural sources, such as rivers. This has led to unusual uncertainty in the standardized atomic weight of lithium, since this quantity depends on the natural abundance ratios of these naturally-occurring stable lithium isotopes, as they are available in commercial lithium mineral sources.[32]\n\n\nBoth stable isotopes of lithium can be laser cooled and were used to produce the first quantum degenerate Bose-Fermi mixture.[33]\n\n\n\n## Occurrence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lithium is about as common as chlorine in the Earth's upper continental crust, on a per-atom basis.\n### Astronomical[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Nucleosynthesis, Stellar nucleosynthesis, and Lithium burning\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Atomic radius | empirical: 152 pm |\n| Covalent radius | 128±7 pm  |\n| Van der Waals radius | 182 pm  |\n| ![Color lines in a spectral range](image)**Spectral lines of lithium** |\n| Other properties |\n| Natural occurrence | primordial |\n| Crystal structure |  ​body-centered cubic (bcc) (cI2) |\n| Lattice constant | ![Body-centered cubic crystal structure for lithium](image)\n*a* = 350.93 pm (at 20 °C)[3] |\n| Thermal expansion | 46.56×10−6/K (at 20 °C)[3] |\n| Thermal conductivity | 84.8 W/(m⋅K)  |\n| Electrical resistivity | 92.8 nΩ⋅m (at 20 °C)  |\n| Magnetic ordering | paramagnetic  |\n| Molar magnetic susceptibility | +14.2×10−6 cm3/mol (298 K)[5] |\n| Young's modulus | 4.9 GPa  |\n| Shear modulus | 4.2 GPa  |\n| Bulk modulus | 11 GPa  |\n| Speed of sound thin rod | 6000 m/s (at 20 °C)  |\n| Mohs hardness | 0.6  |\n| Brinell hardness | 5 MPa  |\n| CAS Number | 7439-93-2  |\n| History |\n| Discovery | Johan August Arfwedson (1817) |\n| First isolation | William Thomas Brande (1821) |\n| Isotopes of lithium* v\n* e\n |\n|  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. **^** Schwochau, Klaus (1984). \"Extraction of metals from sea water\". *Inorganic Chemistry*.

Currently, most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with magnesium.[73] The price on the American market for vacuum-cast beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.[74]\n\n\nBetween 1998 and 2008, the world's production of beryllium had decreased from 343 to about 200 tonnes. It then increased to 230 tonnes by 2018, of which 170 tonnes came from the United States.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nNamed after beryl, a semiprecious mineral, from which it was first isolated.[77][78][79]\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\n### Radiation windows[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn a 1798 paper read before the Institut de France, Vauquelin reported that he found a new \"earth\" by dissolving aluminium hydroxide from emerald and beryl in an additional alkali.[62] The editors of the journal *Annales de Chimie et de Physique* named the new earth \"glucine\" for the sweet taste of some of its compounds.[63] Klaproth preferred the name \"beryllina\" due to the fact that yttria also formed sweet salts.[64][65] The name \"beryllium\" was first used by Wöhler in 1828.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)Friedrich Wöhler was one of the men who independently isolated beryllium\nFriedrich Wöhler[67] and Antoine Bussy[68] independently isolated beryllium in 1828 by the chemical reaction of metallic potassium with beryllium chloride, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Beryllium** is a chemical element; it has symbol **Be** and atomic number 4. It is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal. It is a divalent element that occurs naturally only in combination with other elements to form minerals. Gemstones high in beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald, red beryl) and chrysoberyl. It is a relatively rare element in the universe, usually occurring as a product of the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars, beryllium is depleted as it is fused into heavier elements. Beryllium constitutes about 0.0004 percent by mass of Earth's crust. The world's annual beryllium production of 220 tons is usually manufactured by extraction from the mineral beryl, a difficult process because beryllium bonds strongly to oxygen.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Standard Atomic Weights: Beryllium\".

The original industrial involvement included subsidiaries and scientists related to the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation in Cleveland, Ohio, and Siemens & Halske AG in Berlin. In the US, the process was ruled by Hugh S. Cooper, director of The Kemet Laboratories Company. In Germany, the first commercially successful process for producing beryllium was developed in 1921 by Alfred Stock and Hans Goldschmidt.[70]\n\n\nA sample of beryllium was bombarded with alpha rays from the decay of radium in a 1932 experiment by James Chadwick that uncovered the existence of the neutron.[32] This same method is used in one class of radioisotope-based laboratory neutron sources that produce 30 neutrons for every million α particles.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Alderghi, Lucia; Gans, Peter; Midollini, Stefano; Vacca, Alberto (2000).

Identification is now performed using safe modern diagnostics techniques.[9] A successful test for beryllium in air and on surfaces has been developed and published as an international voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeryllium may be found in coal slag. When the slag is formulated into an abrasive agent for blasting paint and rust from hard surfaces, the beryllium can become airborne and become a source of exposure.[122]\n\n\nAlthough the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.[123]\n\n\n\n### Detection[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe mineral beryl, which contains beryllium, has been used at least since the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt.[59] In the first century CE, Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder mentioned in his encyclopedia *Natural History* that beryl and emerald (\"smaragdus\") were similar.[60] The Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis, written in the third or fourth century CE, contains notes on how to prepare artificial emerald and beryl.[60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin discovered beryllium\nEarly analyses of emeralds and beryls by Martin Heinrich Klaproth, Torbern Olof Bergman, Franz Karl Achard, and Johann Jakob Bindheim always yielded similar elements, leading to the mistaken conclusion that both substances are aluminium silicates.[61] Mineralogist René Just Haüy discovered that both crystals are geometrically identical, and he asked chemist Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin for a chemical analysis.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| First isolation | Friedrich Wöhler & Antoine Bussy (1828) |\n| Isotopes of beryllium* v\n* e\n |\n|  |\n| \n\n| Main isotopes[8] | Decay |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | abun­dance | half-life (*t*1/2) | mode | pro­duct |\n| 7Be\n | trace | 53.22 d | ε | 7Li |\n| 8Be | synth | 81.9 as | α | 4He |\n| 9Be\n | 100%\n | stable |\n| 10Be | trace\n | 1.387×106 y | β− | 10B |\n\n |\n|  |\n| ![](image) Category: Beryllium* view\n* talk\n* edit\n | references |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeryllium production saw a rapid increase during World War II, due to the rising demand for hard beryllium-copper alloys and phosphors for fluorescent lights. Most early fluorescent lamps used zinc orthosilicate with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium tungstate improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield an acceptable white light. Halophosphate-based phosphors replaced beryllium-based phosphors after beryllium was found to be toxic.[71]\n\n\nElectrolysis of a mixture of beryllium fluoride and sodium fluoride was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the alkali metals. Early in the 20th century, the production of beryllium by the thermal decomposition of beryllium iodide was investigated following the success of a similar process for the production of zirconium, but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production.[72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe two main ores of beryllium, beryl and bertrandite, are found in Argentina, Brazil, India, Madagascar, Russia and the United States.[32] Total world reserves of beryllium ore are greater than 400,000 tonnes.[32]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nThe extraction of beryllium from its compounds is a difficult process due to its high affinity for oxygen at elevated temperatures, and its ability to reduce water when its oxide film is removed. Currently the United States, China and Kazakhstan are the only three countries involved in the industrial-scale extraction of beryllium.[33] Kazakhstan produces beryllium from a concentrate stockpiled before the breakup of the Soviet Union around 1991. This resource had become nearly depleted by mid-2010s.[34]\n\n\nProduction of beryllium in Russia was halted in 1997, and is planned to be resumed in the 2020s.[35][36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Beryllium ore with 1US¢ coin for scale\n![](image)Emerald is a naturally occurring compound of beryllium.\nThe Sun has a concentration of 0.1 parts per billion (ppb) of beryllium.[24] Beryllium has a concentration of 2 to 6 parts per million (ppm) in the Earth's crust.[25] It is most concentrated in the soils, 6 ppm.[26] Trace amounts of 9Be are found in the Earth's atmosphere.[26] The concentration of beryllium in sea water is 0.2–0.6 parts per trillion.[26][27] In stream water, however, beryllium is more abundant with a concentration of 0.1 ppb.[28]\n\n\nBeryllium is found in over 100 minerals,[29] but most are uncommon to rare. The more common beryllium containing minerals include: bertrandite (Be4Si2O7(OH)2), beryl (Al2Be3Si6O18), chrysoberyl (Al2BeO4) and phenakite (Be2SiO4). Precious forms of beryl are aquamarine, red beryl and emerald.[11][30][31] \nThe green color in gem-quality forms of beryl comes from varying amounts of chromium (about 2% for emerald).[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n71. **^** Kane, Raymond; Sell, Heinz (2001). \"A Review of Early Inorganic Phosphors\". *Revolution in lamps: a chronicle of 50 years of progress*.

PMID 27364901.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNaturally occurring beryllium, save for slight contamination by the cosmogenic radioisotopes, is isotopically pure beryllium-9, which has a nuclear spin of 3/2. Beryllium has a large scattering cross section for high-energy neutrons, about 6 barns for energies above approximately 10 keV. Therefore, it works as a neutron reflector and neutron moderator, effectively slowing the neutrons to the thermal energy range of below 0.03 eV, where the total cross section is at least an order of magnitude lower; the exact value strongly depends on the purity and size of the crystallites in the material.\n\n\nThe single primordial beryllium isotope 9Be also undergoes a (n,2n) neutron reaction with neutron energies over about 1.9 MeV, to produce 8Be, which almost immediately breaks into two alpha particles. Thus, for high-energy neutrons, beryllium is a neutron multiplier, releasing more neutrons than it absorbs. This nuclear reaction is:[12]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n39. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Boronski, Josef T.; Crumpton, Agamemnon E.; Wales, Lewis L.; Aldridge, Simon (16 June 2023). \"Diberyllocene, a stable compound of Be(I) with a Be–Be bond\". *Science*. **380** (6650): 1147–1149.

The modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 35% greater than that of steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium – about 12.9 km/s at ambient conditions. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg−1·K−1) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m−1·K−1), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (11.4×10−6 K−1), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.[11]\n\n\n\n### Nuclear properties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** \"Russia restarts beryllium production after 20 years\".

{"type":"root_message","msg":{"role":"function","content":"Helium was first detected as an unknown, yellow spectral line signature in sunlight during a solar eclipse in 1868 by Georges Rayet, Captain C. T. Haig, Norman R. Pogson, and Lieutenant John Herschel. It was subsequently confirmed by French astronomer Jules Janssen. Janssen is often jointly credited with detecting the element, along with Norman Lockyer. The formal discovery of the element was made in 1895 by chemists Sir William Ramsay, Per Teodor Cleve, and Nils Abraham Langlet, who found helium emanating from the uranium ore cleveite.\n\nSir William Ramsay isolated helium on Earth on March 26, 1895, by treating the mineral cleveite with mineral acids.
