During earlier periods of history, the head of government of France was known by different titles. As was common in European democracies of the 1815\u20131958 period (the Bourbon Restoration and July Monarchy, the Second, Third, and Fourth Republic, as well as the Vichy regime), the head of government was called President of the Council of Ministers (*Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil des ministres*), generally shortened to President of the council (*Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil*). This should not be confused with the elected office of president of the French Republic, who appoints the prime minister as head of state.\n\n\n\n\n## 9th century \u2013 18th century[edit]\n\n\n###

The office was established in its current form by the Constitution of 1978 and it was first regulated in 1823 as a chairmanship of the extant Council of Ministers, although it is not possible to determine when it actually originated.\n\n\nUpon a vacancy, the Spanish monarch nominates a presidency candidate for a vote of confidence by the Congress of Deputies, the lower house of the Cortes Generales (parliament). The process is a parliamentarian investiture by which the head of government is indirectly elected by the elected Congress of Deputies. In practice, the prime minister is almost always the leader of the largest party in the Congress. Since current constitutional practice in Spain calls for the monarch to act on the advice of his ministers, the prime minister is the country's *de facto* chief executive.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * President of the Government of Spain\n* First Vice President of the Government of Spain\n* Second Vice President of the Government of Spain\n* Third Vice President of the Government of Spain\n* Office of the Prime Minister\n* Minister of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation\n* Ministry of the Presidency, Justice and Relations with the Cortes\n* Ministry of Defence\n* Minister of Finance\n* Ministry of the Interior\n* Minister of Transport and Sustainable Mobility\n* Minister of Education, Vocational Training and Sports\n* Minister of Labour and Social Economy\n* Minister of Industry and Tourism\n* Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food\n* Minister of Territorial Policy and Democratic Memory\n* Minister for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge\n* Minister of Housing and Urban Agenda\n* Ministry of Culture\n* Minister of Economy, Trade and Business\n* Ministry of Health\n* Minister of Social Rights, Consumer Affairs and 2030 Agenda\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Sworn In as Prime Minister, Spain's S\u00e1nchez Readies Cabinet - The New York Times\". *www.nytimes.com*.

Spain was not unique in this regard: it was one of several European parliamentary systems including France, Italy and Ireland that styled the head of government as 'presidents' of the government rather than the Westminster term of 'prime minister' (see President of the Council for the full list of corresponding terms); similarly, the president of the Congress or Senate referred to the parliamentary speakers. This system of multiple distinct offices all labelled 'president' causes confusion among English-speakers: both President George W.

For this reason, the prime minister is usually the leader of the largest party in the Congress.[24] For the Crown to nominate the political leader whose party controls the Congress can be seen as a royal endorsement of the democratic process\u2014a fundamental concept enshrined in the 1978 Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlthough the position of deputy prime minister has existed intermittently since 1840, the Constitution endorses what was established in the Organic Act of the State of 1967,[50] which provided for the first time the possibility of appointing more than one deputy and, in 1974, this provision became effective when prime minister Carlos Arias Navarro, appointed three deputies (Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez, Antonio Barrera de Irimo and Licinio de la Fuente).[51] Since then, three more prime ministers (Adolfo Su\u00e1rez, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero and Pedro S\u00e1nchez) has had more than one deputy.[52] The second government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez holds the record of more deputies, with four.[53][52] This large volume of deputy premierships during the second cabinet of S\u00e1nchez was interpreted as a maneuver to reduce the political weight of his second deputy prime minister and leader of the minority party in the government coalition, Pablo Iglesias Turri\u00f3n.[54][55][56]\n\n\n\n### Succession[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Office of the Prime Minister[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Prime Minister's Office (Spain)\n\n![](image)Moncloa Government Complex seen from the Polytechnic University of Madrid.\nThe Office of the Prime Minister (Spanish: *Presidencia del Gobierno*, lit.\u2009'Presidency of the Government') is the combination of government departments and services that are at the service of the Prime Minister to fulfill its constitutional duties.[35] It was established around 1834 when officials and budget began to be assigned to the personal Secretariat of the Prime Minister.

Alcide De Gasperi is the only prime minister who has held this position both in the Kingdom of Italy and in the Republic of Italy. \n\n\nThe prime minister is appointed by the President of the Republic and must receive a confidence vote by both houses of Parliament: the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.[8] From 1946 to 2022, in the first 76 years after the creation of the Republic, 30 men served as prime ministers.[9][10] \nThe current officeholder is Giorgia Meloni, who was appointed on 22 October 2022, becoming the first woman to hold this office.[11][12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrime Ministers of the Italian Republic (1946\u2013present)\n| Portrait\n | Name(Birth\u2013Death) | Term of office\n | Party\n | Government\n | Composition\n | Legislature(Election) | President(Tenure) | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Took office\n | Left office\n | Time in office\n |\n| ![Alcide De Gasperi](image) | **Alcide De Gasperi**(1881\u20131954) | 13 July1946\n | 2 February1947\n | 7\u00a0years, 35\u00a0days\n |  | Christian Democracy | De Gasperi II | *CLN* DC \u2022 PSIUP \u2022 PCI \u2022 PRI | *ConstituentAssembly*(1946)\n | **EnricoDe Nicola**![](image)(1946\u20131948) | [82][83][84][85][86][87][88] |\n| 2 February1947\n | 1 June1947\n | De Gasperi III | *CLN* DC \u2022 PSI \u2022 PCI \u2022 PDL |\n| 1 June1947\n | 24 May1948\n | De Gasperi IV | *Centrism*DC \u2022 PSDI \u2022 PLI \u2022 PRI |\n| 24 May1948\n | 27 January1950\n | De Gasperi V | I(1948)\n | **Luigi Einaudi**![](image)(1948\u20131955) |\n| 27 January1950\n | 26 July1951\n | De Gasperi VI | *Centrism*DC \u2022 PSDI \u2022 PRI |\n| 26 July1951\n | 16 July1953\n | De Gasperi VII | *Centrism*DC \u2022 PRI |\n| 16 July1953\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n137. **^** \"II Governo Berlusconi\". *storia.camera.it* (in Italian).

The vice president was a political enemy of J\u00e2nio Quadros, the leftist Jo\u00e3o Goulart. Goulart was out of the country, and Congress was controlled by right wing politicians. During Goulart's absence, the president of the Chamber of deputies, Ranieri Mazzilli, took office as acting president of Brazil. There was then a plot to block the inauguration of the vice president as president, but Congressional resistance to the inauguration of Goulart led to a reaction by the governor of Rio Grande do Sul, who led a \"legality campaign\", and to a split in the military (that, during the fourth Republic, intervened heavily in politics). Amid the political crisis, the solution was the adoption by Congress of a Constitutional Amendment abolishing the presidential executive and replacing it with a parliamentary system of government. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** Costa e Silva was elected indirectly on 3 October 1966.

Jo\u00e3o Figueiredo became President in March 1979; in the same year he passed the Amnesty Law for political crimes committed for and against the regime. While combating the \"hardliners\" inside the government and supporting a re-democratization policy, Figueiredo could not control the crumbling economy, chronic inflation and concurrent fall of other military dictatorships in South America. Amid massive popular demonstrations in the streets of the main cities of the country, the first free elections in 20 years were held for the national legislature in 1982. In 1985, another election was held, this time to elect (indirectly) a new president, being contested between civilian candidates for the first time since the 1960s, being won by the opposition.

When the term of the last military president was to end, however, no direct elections for President of Brazil took place. For the election of the country's first civilian president since the military coup of 1964, the military maintained the rule that prevailed during the dictatorial regime, according to which an Electoral College made up of the entire National Congress and representatives from State Assemblies was to elect the president. This time, however, the military placed the Electoral College under no coercion, so that its members would be free to select the president of their choice. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlthough elected President of Brazil, Tancredo Neves became gravely ill on the eve of his inauguration and died without ever taking office. Therefore, the first civilian president since 1964 was Tancredo's running mate, Jos\u00e9 Sarney, himself an ex-member of ARENA. Jos\u00e9 Sarney's administration fulfilled Tancredo's campaign promise of passing a constitutional amendment to the Constitution inherited from the military regime, so as to summon elections for a National Constituent Assembly with full powers to draft and adopt a new Constitution for the country, to replace the authoritarian legislation that still remained in place. In October 1988, a new democratic Constitution was passed and democracy was consolidated. In 1989, the first elections for president under the new Constitution were held and the young Fernando Collor de Mello was elected for a five-year term, the first president to be elected by direct popular ballot since the military coup. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 29 | ![](image) | Ernesto Geisel(1907\u20131996) | 1974 | 15 March 1974\n | 15 March 1979\n | 5 years\n | ARENA | Adalberto Pereira dos Santos(ARENA)\n |\n| 30 | ![](image) | Jo\u00e3o Figueiredo(1918\u20131999) | 1978 | 15 March 1979\n | 15 March 1985\n | 6 years\n | ARENA(until Dec. 1979) | Aureliano Chaves(ARENA/PDS/PFL)\n |\n| PDS(from 1980) |\n\n\n## The Sixth Republic (1985\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Brazil since 1985\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** Get\u00falio Vargas was de facto president between 3 November 1930 and 20 July 1934, as head of the Provisional Government.

This practice was broken when the leaders of S\u00e3o Paulo and president Washington Lu\u00eds nominated their fellow Paulista J\u00falio Prestes as candidate for the presidential elections in 1930. In response, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul and Para\u00edba formed the \"Liberal Alliance\" backing opposition candidate Get\u00falio Vargas.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe military coup was fomented by Jos\u00e9 de Magalh\u00e3es Pinto, Adhemar de Barros, and Carlos Lacerda (who had already participated in the conspiracy to depose Get\u00falio Vargas in 1945), then governors of the states of Minas Gerais, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Guanabara, respectively. The coup was planned and executed by the most forefront commanders of the Brazilian Army and received the support of almost all high-ranking members of the military, along with conservative elements in society, like the Catholic Church and anti-communist civil movements among the Brazilian middle and upper classes. Internationally, it was supported by the State Department of the United States through its embassy in Brasilia.[1][2]\n\n\nDespite initial pledges to the contrary, the military regime enacted in 1967 a new, restrictive Constitution, and stifled freedom of speech and political opposition. The regime adopted nationalism, economic development, and anti-communism as its guidelines.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** On November 3, 1891, feeling threatened, Deodoro da Fonseca closed the National Congress.

During her last regency she sanctioned, on 13 May 1888, the Golden Law (Imperial Law No. 3,353), which abolished slavery in Brazil.\n\n\n\n## The First Republic (1889\u20131930)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Vice-president Delfim Moreira succeeded to the Presidency upon the death of president-elect Rodrigues Alves, but, in accordance with the constitutional provisions then in force, since the vacancy of the presidency occurred in the first half of the four-year presidential term, new elections were summoned and Delfim Moreira served only until an elected president was chosen and inaugurated to finish the 1918\u20131922 presidential term.\n8. **^** Delfim Moreira died on 1 July 1920, during his term as Epit\u00e1cio Pessoa's vice-president. A new election was held to fill the vacancy, electing Bueno de Paiva, who took office on 10 November of the same year.\n9. **^** J\u00falio Prestes, elected on 1 March 1930, was unable to take office due to the same coup that ousted Washington Lu\u00eds.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith the proclamation of the Brazilian Republic, the Imperial constitution ceased to operate, the Imperial Parliament (the General Assembly) ceased to exist, and not only was the Viscount of Ouro Preto removed from office, but the position of prime minister itself ceased to exist. As head of the provisional government, Deodoro da Fonseca ruled by decree, holding both the functions of head of state and of head of government. The former provinces of the Empire were reorganized as states and the newly proclaimed republic was declared a federation, formed by the perpetual union of those states.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| No. | Portrait\n | Name\n | Elected\n | Term of office\n | Political party\n | Vice president\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Took office\n | Left office\n | Time in office\n |\n| 25 | ![](image) | Ranieri Mazzilli(1910\u20131975)*Acting president* | \u2014\n | 2 April 1964\n | 15 April 1964\n | 13\u00a0days\n | PSD | *Vacant* |\n| 26 | ![](image) | Castelo Branco(1897\u20131967) | 1964 | 15 April 1964\n | 15 March 1967\n | 2\u00a0years, 334\u00a0days\n | *None*(until 1966) | Jos\u00e9 Maria Alkmin(PSD/ARENA)\n |\n| ARENA(from 1966) |\n| 27 | ![](image) | Costa e Silva(1899\u20131969) | 1966 | 15 March 1967\n | 31 August 1969[t] | 2\u00a0years, 169\u00a0days\n | ARENA | Pedro Aleixo(ARENA)\n |\n| \u2014 | ![](image) | Pedro Aleixo(1901\u20131975) | \u2014\n | *Never took office*[u] | ARENA | *Vacant* |\n| \u2014 | ![](image) | Military junta of 1969 | \u2014\n | 31 August 1969\n | 30 October 1969\n | 60\u00a0days\n | *None* | *Vacant* |\n| 28 | ![](image) | Em\u00edlio Garrastazu M\u00e9dici(1905\u20131985) | 1969 | 30 October 1969\n | 15 March 1974\n | 4\u00a0years, 136\u00a0days\n | ARENA | Augusto Rademaker(ARENA)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen Prestes won the March 1930 Presidential election, the Alliance denounced his victory as fraudulent, while Vargas's running mate, Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, was assassinated in July. A revolution then began on 3 October 1930 and quickly spread throughout the country; by 10 October, both Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais had announced their support. Washington Lu\u00eds was deposed on 24 October, and the Brazilian Military Junta of 1930 took over; Vargas assumed leadership of the junta on 3 November 1930, marking the end of the First Brazilian Republic and beginning of the Vargas Era.\n\n\nThe 1932 Constitutionalist Revolution led to the adoption of a new Constitution in 1934. However, the constitution was annulled and Vargas became a dictator in the name of law and order in 1937. His rule occupies two periods of Brazilian history, the Second Brazilian Republic and the Third Brazilian Republic, known as the Estado Novo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrazil had two monarchs during the time of the United Kingdom with Portugal: Maria I (1815\u20131816) and John VI (1816\u20131822). When this Kingdom was created, queen Maria I was already considered incapable due to mental illness and the Portuguese Empire was ruled by prince John, later king John VI, as regent. As an independent nation, Brazil had two monarchs, emperors Pedro I (1822\u20131831) and Pedro II (1831\u20131889). The second woman to govern Brazil, after Maria I, was Leopoldina of Austria, who acted as regent in 1822 and had a great influence on Brazil's independence process, having been responsible for signing the decree that separated Brazil from Portugal.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough it was theoretically a constitutional democracy, the Old Republic was characterized by the power of regional oligarchies and the seldom broken alternation of power in the federal sphere between the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais. The vote in the countryside was often controlled by local land owners, and less than 6% of the population had the right to vote due to literacy requirements.\n\n\nIn 1930, when Brazil was suffering the effects of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, a revolution broke out in the country and the Old Republic ended. President Washington Lu\u00eds, who was supported by S\u00e3o Paulo oligarchies, broke the expected alternation between S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais and supported a candidate who was also from S\u00e3o Paulo, J\u00falio Prestes. Prestes won the 1930 election, but Washington Lu\u00eds was deposed three weeks before the end of his term and Prestes was never inaugurated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
