Its membership, as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869, consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom constitute a quorum.[1][2] Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants plenary power to the president of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court; justices have life tenure.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSupreme Court of the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| The court | * Lists of cases\n* Court demographics\n* Ideological leanings\n* Nomination and confirmation\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Procedures | * *Amicus curiae* brief\n* *Certiorari*\n\t+ Cert. before judgment\n\t+ Cert. dismissed as improvidently granted\n\t+ Grant, vacate, remand\n* Shadow docket\n\t+ In-chambers opinion\n |\n| Current members | * **Chief justice:** John Roberts\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Although Lewis Powell and William H.

There are no formal names or numbers for the individual seats of the associate justices, which are listed in the table below simply by number.

The length of service on the Court for the 107 non-incumbent justices ranges from William O. Douglas's 36\u00a0years, 209\u00a0days to John Rutledge's 1\u00a0year, 18\u00a0days as associate justice and, separated by a period of years off the Court, his 138\u00a0days as chief justice. As of June 13, 2024, the length of service for the nine incumbent justices ranges from Clarence Thomas's 32\u00a0years, 234\u00a0days to Ketanji Brown Jackson's 1\u00a0year, 349\u00a0days. Five individuals, who were confirmed for associate justice, were later appointed chief justice separately: John Rutledge,[a] Edward Douglass White,[b] Charles Evans Hughes,[a] Harlan F. Stone[b] and William Rehnquist.[b] While listed twice, each of them has been assigned only one index number. The justices of the Supreme Court are:[9][10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile the justices of the Supreme Court are appointed for life, many have retired or resigned. Beginning in the early 20th century, many justices who left the Court voluntarily did so by retiring from the Court without leaving the federal judiciary altogether. A retired justice, according to the United States Code, is no longer a member of the Supreme Court, but remains eligible to serve by designation as a judge of a U.S. Court of Appeals or District Court, and many retired justices have served in these capacities. Historically, the average length of service on the Court has been less than 15 years. However, since 1970 the average length of service has increased to about 26 years.[8]\n\n\n\n## List of justices[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **106** | ![](image) | **Clarence Thomas(born 1948)** | **GA** | **AssociateJustice** | **T.

An 1801 act would have decreased the Court's size to five members upon its next vacancy. However, an 1802 act negated the effects of the 1801 act upon the Court before any such vacancy occurred, maintaining the Court's size at six members. Later legislation increased its size to seven members in 1807, to nine in 1837, and to ten in 1863. An 1866 act was to have reduced the Court's size from ten members to seven upon its next three vacancies, and two vacancies did occur during this period. However, before a third vacancy occurred, the Judiciary Act of 1869 intervened, restoring the Court's size to nine members, where it has remained ever since.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![](image) | Joseph P.

Like college and university rankings, law school rankings can be based on empirical data, subjectively-perceived qualitative data (often survey research of educators, law professors, lawyers, students, or others), or some combination of these. Such rankings are often consulted by prospective students as they choose which schools they will apply to or which school they will attend. There are several different law school rankings, each of which has a different emphasis and methodology.\n\n\n\n\n## *U.S. News & World Report* rankings[edit]\n\n\n*U.S. News & World Report* (USNWR) is considered to be the most influential ranking among law schools. USNWR organizes rankings into two main sections: the first is a \"Top 145\" listing the top 145 schools in order from highest to lowest ranked. *U.S. News* groups the remaining schools, or the bottom 25 percent of those that are ranked, into a \"Rank Not Published\" group.[1] Schools that fall into this category are listed alphabetically and not by actual ranking. *U.S. News* also ranks each school's specialty programs using a similar method, if applicable. U.S. News ranked 196 schools in 2016. Each school's *U.S. News* ranking tends to fluctuate annually.\n\n\n*U.S. News* published its first attempt at ranking U.S. law schools in 1987, and it has released annual rankings beginning in 1990.[2] There has been great consistency at the top of the *U.S. News* rankings since their inception, with Yale Law School consistently ranking first.[3] While Yale, Harvard, and Stanford have historically clustered at the top of the list,[4] Harvard was recently replaced by the University of Chicago in the third place spot.[5]\n\n\n\n### Top 14 law schools[edit]\n\n\nThere exists an informal and unofficial category known as the \"Top Fourteen\" or \"T14\", which has historically referred to the institutions that most frequently claim the top fourteen spots in the yearly *U.S. News & World Report* ranking of American law schools.[6] Furthermore, the \"T14\" schools remain the only ones to have ever placed within the top ten spots in these rankings.[7] Although \"T14\" is not a designation used by *U.S. News* itself, the term is \"widely known in the legal community\".[8] While these schools have seen their position within the top group shift frequently, they have consistently placed within the top fourteen since the inception of the rankings. Because of their consistent placement at the top of the US News rankings, the schools that have most frequently taken the top fourteen spots are commonly referred to as the \"Top Fourteen\" by published books on law school admissions,[9] undergraduate university pre-law advisers,[10] professional law school consultants, and newspaper articles on the subject.[11]\n\n\n\n![Law school rankings in the United States is located in the United States](image)![Berkeley](image)\nBerkeley\n![Columbia NYU](image)\nColumbia  \nNYU\n![Cornell](image)\nCornell\n![Duke](image)\nDuke\n![Harvard](image)\nHarvard\n![Law school rankings in the United States](image)\n![Law school rankings in the United States](image)\n![Stanford](image)\nStanford\n![Northwestern Chicago](image)\nNorthwestern  \nChicago\n![Michigan](image)\nMichigan\n![Penn](image)\nPenn\n![Georgetown](image)\nGeorgetown\n![Virginia](image)\nVirginia\n![Yale](image)\nYale\nclass=notpageimage|\n\"T14\" law schools, historically (public schools in blue)\n\nThe schools that most frequently have appeared at the top of the *U.S. News & World Report* ranking of American law schools, commonly known as the \"Top 14\" or \"T14\" are, in alphabetical order:[12]\n\n\n\n* Columbia Law School\n* Cornell Law School\n* Duke University School of Law\n* Georgetown University Law Center\n* Harvard Law School\n* New York University School of Law\n* Northwestern University School of Law\n* Stanford Law School\n* University of California, Berkeley School of Law\n* University of Chicago Law School\n* University of Michigan Law School\n* University of Pennsylvania Law School\n* University of Virginia School of Law\n* Yale Law School\n\n\n## ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities)[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, ARWU released its rankings of world universities in the subject of law by taking into account only the academic strength of the institution. In 2021, ARWU ranked all T-14 US Law Schools within the world's top 20 law schools.[13]\n\n\n\n## *National Law Journal*'s Go-To Law School Rankings[edit]\n\n\nSeveral ranking systems are explicitly designed to focus on employment outcomes at or shortly after graduation, including rankings by the *National Law Journal*[14] and Law.com.[15][16]\n\n\nThe *National Law Journal* ranks the top 50 law schools by the percentage of juris doctor graduates who took jobs at NLJ 250 firms, the nation's largest by headcount as identified by *The National Law Journal*'s annual survey. It provides an alternative comparison of its own employment-based rankings to the *U.S. New*s rankings.[17]\n\n\n\n## QS World University Rankings[edit]\n\n\nThe 2020 QS World University Rankings for Law ranked 14 U.S. institutions in the top 50 worldwide. The U.S. institutions in the top 10 were Harvard Law School, which ranked first, with Yale Law School ranked fourth, Stanford Law School ranked fifth, NYU School of Law ranked sixth, UC Berkeley School of Law ranked seventh, and Columbia Law School ranked tenth. Every other law school in *U.S. News & World Report*'s T14 rankings except University of Virginia School of Law made the QS Top 50.[18]\n\n\n\n## Social Science Research Network[edit]\n\n\nSocial Science Research Network\u2014a repository for draft and completed scholarship in law and the social sciences\u2014publishes monthly rankings of law schools[19] based on the number of times faculty members' scholarship was downloaded. Rankings are available by total number of downloads, total number of downloads within the last 12 months, and downloads per faculty member to adjust for the size of different institutions. SSRN also provides rankings of individual law school faculty members on these metrics.[20]\n\n\n\n## Criticisms of rankings[edit]\n\n\nAmong the criticisms of law school rankings is that they are arbitrary in the characteristics they measure and the value given to each one. Another complaint is that a prospective law student should take into account the \"fit\" and appropriateness of each school, and that there is not a \"one size fits all\" ranking. Others complain that common rankings shortchange schools due to geographical or demographic reasons.\n\n\nThe American Bar Association, which has consistently refused to support or participate in law school rankings, has issued disclaimers on law school rating systems, and encourages prospective law students to consider a variety of factors in making their choice among schools.[21] Further, the Association of American Law Schools has also voiced criticisms of *U.S. News*'s ranking system. Carl Monk, its former executive director, once went so far as to say \"these rankings are a misleading and deceptive, profit-generating commercial enterprise that compromises *U.S. News & World Report*'s journalistic integrity.\"[22]\n\n\nAs a response to the prevalence of law school rankings, the ABA and the LSAC publish an annual law school guide. This guide, which does not seek to rank or sort law schools by any criteria, instead seeks to provide the reader with a set of standard, important data on which to judge law schools. It contains information on all 200 ABA-Approved Law Schools. This reference, called The Official Guide to ABA-Approved Law Schools is provided free online and also in print for a small cost. A similar guide for Canadian Law Schools is also published by the Law School Admission Council and is called Official Guide to Canadian Law Schools. These guides seek to serve as an alternative to the *U.S. News* Rankings and law school rankings in general.\n\n\nAdditionally, the American Bar Association issued the MacCrate Report in 1992, which outlined many fundamental problems with modern legal education and called for reform in American law schools.[23] While the report was hailed as a \"template for modern legal education\", its practice-oriented tenets have met resistance by law schools continually ranked in the \"top 13.\"[24]\n\n\nRanking systems, most prominently that of *U.S. News*, has not allowed these criticisms to go unanswered. They regularly outline and justify their methodology alongside the rankings, and have even published defenses of their value.[25] Additionally, law professors William Henderson and Andrew Morriss have come out with a study criticizing law schools' (and the ABA's) refusal to adopt any better objective comparison method for the continued widespread reliance on *U.S. News*.[26] Henderson and Morriss allege that law schools' attempts to \"game\" their *U.S. News* ranking by manipulating postgraduation employment statistics or applicant selectivity have led *U.S. News* to adjust its methodology accordingly, resulting in a counter-productive cycle.[26] They go on to suggest that the ABA should use its accreditation power to mandate greater transparency in law schools' statistical reporting.[26]\n\n\nIn March 2011, Loyola Law School Dean Victor Gold penned an op-ed in the *Huffington Post*, accusing *U.S. News & World Report* of \"refus[ing] to consider diversity as a factor in its ranking system.\"[27] Gold asserted that \"[t]here is a broad consensus among law school deans and professors that diversity enriches law school education.\" Loyola, which has a large Asian student body, claims 37% of its students are \"minorities\", but it does not provide any specifics.\n\n\nFrom November to December 2022, 12 of the 14 *\"T14\"* law Schools announced that they would no longer participate in the *U.S. News* rankings by declining to submit admissions data, the remaining two schools being University of Chicago Law School and Cornell Law School.[28] One of their criticism was that the rankings don't give enough credit to programs that train lawyers interested in public service.[29][30] In response, *U.S. News* pledged to modify its law school rankings to capture the individual nuances of each school.[31] Additionally, the magazine said that it will continue ranking all fully accredited law schools, regardless of whether schools agree to submit their data.[32]\n\n\n\n## Impact of rankings[edit]\n\n\nDespite these criticisms, law school rankings in general and those by *U.S. News* in particular play a role in the world of legal education. This pressure has also resulted in various schools \"gaming the rankings\".[33] In a March 2003 article in *Student Lawyer*, Jane Easter Bahls stated that, in order to appear more selective, some law schools reject applicants whose high LSAT scores indicate that they probably would go somewhere else.[34][35] Other schools, in an attempt to increase the amount of money spent per student, increase tuition and return it to the students as financial aid.[34]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Methodology: 2023 Best Law Schools Rankings\". *US News & World Report*. 10 May 2023.

She was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 10, 2010, and has served since August 7, 2010. Kagan is the fourth woman to become a member of the Court.\n\n\nKagan was born and raised in New York City. After graduating from Princeton University, Worcester College, Oxford, and Harvard Law School, she clerked for a federal Court of Appeals judge and for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. She began her career as a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, leaving to serve as Associate White House Counsel, and later as a policy adviser under President Bill Clinton. After a nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which expired without action, she became a professor at Harvard Law School and was later named its first female dean.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n153. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Kraft, Brooks (August 5, 2010). \"Colleagues recall Kagan's years at Harvard\". *Harvard.edu*.

Her adjustment to Harvard's atmosphere was rocky; she received the worst grades of her entire law school career in her first semester. Kagan went on to earn an A in 17 of the 21 courses she took at Harvard, and she became a supervisory editor of the *Harvard Law Review*.[28] She worked as a summer associate at the Wall Street law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, where she worked in the litigation department.[29] She graduated in 1986 with a Juris Doctor *magna cum laude*.[30][31] Her friend Jeffrey Toobin recalls that Kagan \"stood out from the start as one with a formidable mind. She's good with people. At the time, the law school was a politically charged and divided place. She navigated the factions with ease, and won the respect of everyone.\"[32]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Education | Princeton University (BA)Worcester College, Oxford (MPhil)Harvard University (JD) |\n| Signature | ![Cursive signature in ink](image) |\n| Elena Kagan's voice\n\n\nElena Kagan's opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on her nomination to the Supreme CourtRecorded June 28, 2010\n |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n148. **^** Reilly, Mollie (October 28, 2013). \"The Women Of The Supreme Court Now Have The Badass Portrait They Deserve\". *The Huffington Post*.

Rodriguez* because she authorized a filing in the case when she was solicitor general.[116]\n\n\nKagan was the circuit justice, the justice responsible for handling emergency requests, for the Sixth and Seventh Circuits.[117] After Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, she was assigned to the Ninth Circuit, the largest US circuit court by area. It includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Nevada, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Washington state.[118][117]\n\n\n\n#### Jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring her 15 months as Solicitor General, Kagan argued six cases before the Supreme Court.[79] *The Washington Post* described her style during argument as \"confident\" and \"conversational\".[74] She helped win four cases: *Salazar v. Buono*, 559 U.S. 700 (2010), *United States v. Comstock*, 560 U.S. 126 (2010), *Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project*, 561 U.S. 1 (2010), and *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board*, 561 U.S. 477 (2010).[80][c]\n\n\n\n### Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\n#### Nomination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Elena Kagan Supreme Court nomination\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1991, Kagan became an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School.[38] While there she first met Barack Obama, a guest lecturer at the school.[39][40] While on the UC faculty, Kagan published a law review article on the regulation of First Amendment hate speech in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in *R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul*;[41] an article discussing the significance of governmental motive in regulating speech;[42] and a review of a book by Stephen L. Carter discussing the judicial confirmation process.[43] In the first article, which became highly influential, Kagan argued that the Supreme Court should examine governmental motives when deciding First Amendment cases and analyzed historic draft-card burning and flag burning cases in light of free speech arguments.[44]\n\n\nIn 1993, Senator Joe Biden appointed Kagan as a special counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee. During this time, she worked on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter law school, Kagan was a law clerk for judge Abner J. Mikva of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1987 to 1988. She became one of Mikva's favorite clerks; he called her \"the pick of the litter\".[33] From 1988 to 1989, Kagan clerked for justice Thurgood Marshall of the U.S. Supreme Court. Marshall said he hired Kagan to help him put the \"spark\" back into his opinions as the Court had been undergoing a conservative shift since William Rehnquist became Chief Justice in 1986.[34] Marshall nicknamed the 5-foot-3-inch (1.60-metre) Kagan \"Shorty\".[12]\n\n\nFrom 1989 to 1991, Kagan was in private practice at the Washington, D.C., law firm Williams & Connolly.[35] As a junior associate, she drafted briefs and conducted discovery.[36] During her short time at the firm, she handled five lawsuits that involved First Amendment or media law issues and libel issues.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Time* magazine named Kagan one of its Time 100 most influential people for 2013. Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the article on Kagan, calling her \"an incisive legal thinker\" and \"excellent communicator\".[147] That same year, a painting of the four women to have served as Supreme Court justices, Kagan, Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and O'Connor, was unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.[148] In 2018, Kagan received the Marshall-Wythe Medallion from William & Mary Law School,[149] and an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Hunter College.[150]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKagan has never married. During her confirmation, a photo of her playing softball, which is sometimes characterized in popular culture as unfeminine, led to unsubstantiated claims that Kagan was a lesbian.[151] Her friends have criticized the rumors. Kagan's law school roommate Sarah Walzer said, \"I've known her for most of her adult life and I know she's straight.\"[152]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2003, Kagan sent an email to students and faculty deploring that military recruiters had shown up on campus in violation of this policy. The email read in part, \"This action causes me deep distress. I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy\".[63] She also wrote that it was \"a profound wrong\u2014a moral injustice of the first order\".[63]\n\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, Kagan was a member of the Research Advisory Council of the Goldman Sachs Global Markets Institute. She received a $10,000 stipend for her service.[64]\n\n\nBy early 2007, Kagan was a finalist for the presidency of Harvard University after Lawrence Summers's resignation the previous year. The position ultimately went to Drew Gilpin Faust instead. Kagan was reportedly disappointed, and law school students threw her a party to express their appreciation for her leadership.[65]\n\n\n\n### Solicitor General[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Goldstein, Amy; Leonnig, Carol D.; Slevin, Peter (May 11, 2010). \"For Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan, a history of pragmatism over partisanship\". *The Washington Post*.

While there, she authored a law review article on United States administrative law, focusing on the president's role in formulating and influencing federal administrative law.

On August 5 the full Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63\u201337.[99] The voting was largely along party lines, with five Republicans (Richard Lugar, Judd Gregg, Lindsey Graham, Susan Collins, and Olympia Snowe) supporting her and one Democrat (Ben Nelson) opposing.[100]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2009, Kagan became the first female solicitor general of the United States.[5] The following year, President Obama nominated her to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy arising from the impending retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens.

Kagan initially offered to go hunting with Risch before promising instead to go hunting with Scalia if confirmed. According to Kagan, Scalia laughed when she told him of the promise and took her to his hunting club for the first of several hunting trips.[156] Kagan is known to spend time with longtime friends from law school and her stint in the Clinton administration rather than attending Washington, D.C., social events she is invited to as a justice.[155]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn June 17, 1999, Clinton nominated Kagan to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to replace James L.

He joined the Bush administration as White House staff secretary and was a central figure in its efforts to identify and confirm judicial nominees.[3] Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on July 25, 2003,[65] but his nomination stalled in the Senate for nearly three years. Democratic senators accused him of being too partisan, with Senator Dick Durbin calling him the \"Forrest Gump of Republican politics\".[66][67] In 2003, the American Bar Association had rated Kavanaugh \"well qualified\" (its highest category), but after doing dozens more interviews in 2006, downgraded him to \"qualified\".[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \"Conformation [sic] Hearing on the Nomination of Brett M.

He was nominated by President Donald Trump on July 9, 2018, and has served since October 6, 2018. He was previously a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kavanaugh (blue shirt) with President Bush, Andy Card, and Condoleezza Rice\nIn December 2000, Kavanaugh joined the legal team of George W. Bush, which was trying to stop the ballot recount in Florida.[57] After Bush became president in January 2001, White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales hired Kavanaugh as an associate.[40] There, Kavanaugh worked on the Enron scandal, the successful nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts, and the unsuccessful nomination of Miguel Estrada to the Court of Appeals.[40] Starting in July 2003, he served as Assistant to the President and White House staff secretary,[43] succeeding Harriet Miers.[58] In that position he was responsible for coordinating all documents going to and from the president.\n\n\n\n### Private practice[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPresident Trump nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court on July 9, 2018, to fill the position vacated by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Later in July, Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in the early 1980s.[6][7][8] Three other women also accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, one of whom later recanted her story.[9][10][11][12] None of the accusations were corroborated by eyewitness testimony, and Kavanaugh denied them. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a supplemental hearing over the allegations and voted 11\u201310 along party lines to advance the confirmation to a full Senate vote.[13] On October 6, the full Senate confirmed Kavanaugh by a vote of 50\u201348.[14][15]\n\n\nSince the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020, Kavanaugh has come to be regarded as a swing vote on the Court.[16][17] He was the target of an assassination attempt in June 2022; the suspect had hoped to disrupt the rulings in *Dobbs* and *Bruen*.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter his Supreme Court clerkship, Kavanaugh again worked for Ken Starr until 1997 as an Associate Counsel in the Office of the Independent Counsel with colleagues Rod Rosenstein and Alex Azar.[45] In that capacity, he reopened an investigation into the 1993 gunshot death of Vincent Foster.[45][46][47] After three years, the investigation concluded that Foster had committed suicide. In a September 2018 *New York Times* op-ed, Princeton University history professor Sean Wilentz criticized Kavanaugh for having invested federal money and other resources into investigating partisan conspiracy theories surrounding the cause of Foster's death.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n300. **^** \"Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh Didn't Cheat To Run Boston \u2013 Stop Asking\".
