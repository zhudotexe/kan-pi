Vitol has 40 offices worldwide and its largest operations are in Geneva, Houston, London, and Singapore.[8]\n\n\nWith revenues of $505 billion in 2022,[9] Vitol is the largest independent energy trader in the world, and would be the second-largest company worldwide as measured by revenue on the *Fortune* Global 500 list.[10] Given the secrecy Vitol maintains around all its business activities and the limited nature of its statutory disclosures,[11] it is excluded from rankings. The company, however, does provide some more financial information to its lenders and to a few other entities with which it trades.[12] The company ships more than 350 million tonnes of crude oil per year and controls 250 supertankers and other vessels to move it around the world. On average it handles more than 7.6 million barrels a day of oil and products, [9] roughly equivalent to the daily consumption of Japan, the world's fourth-largest oil consumer after the United States, China, and India.[13][14]\n\n\nVitol is a privately held company by about 400 partners who are current and former employees,[15] who are known for their intense culture of privacy and secrecy from both competitors and the general public.[16] It is reported that Vitol made a payout of $2.9 billion to all its partners in 2021[17][18]\n\n\n\n\n## Activities[edit]\n\n\n### Trading[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to the global crude and product trading businesses, the company trades coal, natural gas, power, ethanol, methanol, gasoline, LNG, LPG, naphtha, bitumen, base oils and carbon emissions.[19][20]\n\n\n\n### Terminals and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nIn total, Vitol has around 16 million cubic meters of storage capacity across the globe.[21]\n\n\nVitol (45% stake), along with IFM Investors (45% stake) and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (10% stake), own VTTI B.V., a storage and terminals business with a capacity of around 8.7 million cubic meters (MCM) in 11 countries: Netherlands (1.328 MCM + 1.118 MCM), Latvia (1.195 MCM), UAE (1.180 MCM), Belgium (0.965 MCM), Malaysia (0.893 MCM), Cyprus (0.544 MCM), USA (0.452 MCM), Argentina (0.218 MCM), Kenya (0.111 MCM), Russia (0.049 MCM), Nigeria (0.016 MCM).[22] MISC Berhad held a 50% stake in VTTI from May 2010 until August 2015.[23] In April 2022, Vitol announced its intention to stop trading Russian petrol by the end of 2022 due to International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War.[24]\n\n\nIn January 2012, Vitol acquired a stake in a subsidiary of the South African shipping firm Grindrod, which gives it access to a coal terminal in Mozambique.[25]\n\n\n\n### Refining[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to offices in Dubai and Bahrain, Vitol's key strategic asset in the Middle East is the Fujairah Refinery Company Limited (FRCL), which operates an 82,000 barrel per day refinery and a 1,034,000 cubic meter tank farm. FRCL has further development plans in place, which include a 140,000 cubic meter expansion of the tank farm, refurbishment of existing refining units and the installation of additional processing units.[26] Vitol also has invested in refining assets in Bayernoil (Germany), Cressier (Switzerland), Antwerp (Belgium) and the Geelong refinery near Melbourne (Australia). In 2018, Vitol bought the 85,000 barrel per day Rotterdam Condensate Splitter from Koch Industries.\n\n\n\n### Exploration and production[edit]\n\n\nVitol, through its wholly owned subsidiaries Arawak Energy Limited and Vitol E&P, has interests in various exploration and production projects worldwide. Arawak Energy is mainly focused on the FSU where it produces oil and gas in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, while Vitol E&P holds a portfolio of exploration and development assets along the West African Transform Margin in Ghana and the Ivory Coast.\n\n\nIn February 2014, it was reported that Vitol, in concert with the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, had bought the downstream businesses of Shell Australia (excluding aviation) for a total of approximately AU$2.9 billion. The purchase included Shell's Geelong Refinery and its 870-site retail business, along with its bulk fuels, bitumen, chemicals and part of its lubricants businesses in Australia.[27] The business trades as Viva Energy, although the Shell brand remains on many of its retail products.[28]\n\n\nFurther, in January 2015, Vitol in collaboration with Eni signed a $7 billion agreement with the government, for the production of oil and gas at Cape Three Points in Western Region of Ghana. The contract is expected to help meet Ghana's burgeoning energy needs.[29]\n\n\n\n### Aviation[edit]\n\n\nVitol Aviation is focused on Europe, North America and Africa, serving the world’s largest airlines and military customers with 5.7 million tonnes of jet fuel a year into wing.\n\n\n\n### Power[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Vitol invested in its first power plant, VPI Immingham in the UK. The combined heat and power plant (CHP) is one of the largest of its kind in Europe, capable of generating 1,240 MW and up to 930 tonnes of steam per hour which is used by nearby refineries. The gas-fired plant provides approximately 2.5% of UK peak electricity demand.\n\n\n\n### Renewable[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Vitol had 1.2 GW[9] of renewable power generation currently operational, planned & with further investments across the energy spectrum.\n\n\n\n## Figures[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Vitol traded:[20]\n\n\n\n* Oil: 367 million tonnes of crude oil and product sales\n* Natural Gas: over 20 billion cubic meters of physical gas globally\n* LPG: 14 million tonnes\n* Naphtha: 15 million tonnes\n* Gasoline: 1 million barrels of physical gasoline traded per day\n* Coal: over 30 million tonnes\n* Power: 93 TWh of power sales contracted\n* Carbon: 49 mm tonnes of contracted carbon volume\n* Methanol: 1.4 million tonnes\n* Chemicals: 4 million tonnes (Benzene and Paraxylene)\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nA 2001 article in The Observer stated that in 1995 Vitol had secretly paid US$1 million to Serbian war criminal Arkan to settle a deal with a Serbian Oil company, Orion.[30][31] Vitol has denied all charges, arguing that no government agency has ever prosecuted the company in this respect.[32]\n\n\nIn 2007, Vitol pleaded guilty to grand larceny in a New York court for paying surcharges to Iraq's national oil company during Saddam's regime and circumventing the UN oil-for-food program. Vitol subsequently paid $17.5 million in restitution for its actions.[33]\n\n\nAccording to an article in the Financial Times, Vitol was the company to organise the first controversial sale of Libyan rebel oil to Tesoro Corporation in early April 2011.[34] According to the *Financial Times*, the company was approached by the Qatari national oil company to sell a cargo of crude oil supplied by the Libyans in exchange for technological supplies and fuel for the National Transitional Council of Libya.[35]\n\n\nIn September 2012, an article in *Reuters* alleged that the company had bought and sold Iranian fuel oil, bypassing an EU embargo against Tehran. Vitol bought 2 million barrels using a ship-to-ship transfer off the coast of Malaysia from a National Iranian Tanker Company vessel and sold it to Chinese traders. The article stated that as Vitol is based in Switzerland, which did not implement Western sanctions, Vitol had skirted the charges.[36]\n\n\nIn 2013, The Telegraph alleged that the company had been using, for over a decade, an Employee Benefit Trust, avoiding paying income tax for its UK staff.[37]\n\n\nIn 2018, The Dispute Settlement and Sanctions Committee of CRE, the French Energy Regulatory Commission, fined VITOL S.A. €5 million for engaging in market manipulation on the French Southern virtual Gas Trading Point (“PEG Sud”) between 1 June 2013 and 31 March 2014.[38] Vitol appealed this decision,[39] but the French Council of State confirmed the sanction in June 2021.[40]\n\n\nIn 2020, Vitol Inc. agreed to pay a combined total criminal penalty of $135 million to resolve bribery charges with law enforcement authorities in the United States and Brazil.[41][42][43] The resolution arises out of Vitol schemes to pay bribes to officials in Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico.[41]\n\n\n\n## Vitol Asia Pte Ltd[edit]\n\n\nVitol Asia Pte Ltd operates as an energy and commodities company, and offers refining, trading, shipping, and storage of crude oil and energy products.[44]\n\n\nThe company was founded in April 1990 and is headquartered in Singapore. The CEO of this subsidiary has been Mike Muller since 10 September 2019.[45]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Meet The Mysterious Trading Firms Who Control The Price Of Commodities\". *BusinessNews*. 2011-10-31.

It is the largest utility company in the world. As of 2022[update], State Grid is the world's third largest company overall by revenue, behind Walmart and Saudi Aramco.[5] In 2022 it was reported as having 871,145 employees, 1.1 billion customers and revenue equivalent to US$460 billion. It is overseen by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council.\n\n\nAfter the electricity Plant-Grid Separation reform in early 2002, the assets of State Electric Power Corporation (国家电力公司) were divided into five power generation groups that retained the power plants and five regional subsidiaries belonging to the State Grid Corporation of China in Beijing.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nChina began an initiative to reform the country's power sector in a three-stage process in 1986.[7] In the third and final stage in March 2002 the State Council of the People's Republic of China put into effect a plan to restructure the country's electric power system in order to create competition and separate generation and transmission functions.[8] The State Grid Corporation of China was founded on December 29, 2002, when the restructuring divided the former State Power Corporation of China into two grid companies, five generation groups and four accessorial business companies.[9] The two grid companies created were the State Grid Corporation of China and a smaller China Southern Power Grid Company.[10] SGCC accounts for 80% of the Chinese grid, with China Southern Power Grid accounting for the other 20%.[11]: 40 At its creation, SGCC company had a generation capacity of 6.47 gigawatts.[8]\n\n\nIn 2003 and progressively so through the early 2000s, electrical shortages caused the government to institute rolling blackouts. The State Grid Corporation estimated there were 1 trillion yuan in losses from 2002 to 2005.[8] The State Grid Corporation of China ran the first 1,000-kilovolt alternating current power line between Northern Shanxi and center Hubei in January 2009. In 2012 it began operation of an 800-kilovolt direct current line that sends hydropower from western Sichuan to Shanghai. It also has an alternating current loop line in the Yangtze River delta, and three longitudinal alternating current lines that bring power to Southern China from the Northern region.[12]\n\n\nThe State Grid Corporation was involved in a multi-phase smart-grid project for China's electrical grid planned for 2011–2015.[13] China's smart grid efforts are different from those in the United States in that its plans heavily use ultra high voltage (UHV) lines. Several UHV construction projects began in 2012 to bring UHV power lines across Huainan, Wannan, and Shanghai and another from Xilingol League to Nanjing. By 2015, the company planned to have three more horizontal UHV lines through West Inner Mongolia to Weifang, from Central Shanxi–Xuzhou to Yaan–southern Anhui and 11 other lines by 2015.[12]\n\n\nIn 2012 the company invested in CDP Reti.\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020 the companies investments in grid expansion rose from 291.12 BioYuan to 460.5 BioYuan.[14]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2014, The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection declared that the general manager of State Grid Shanghai Municipal Electric Power, Feng Jun, was detained in an anti-graft operation overseen by the commission.[15] In 2017, his assets (worth 53 million yuan) were seized, and he was sentenced to life in prison.[16]\n\n\n\n## Overseas investments[edit]\n\n\n### Philippines[edit]\n\n\nOn December 12, 2007, two consortia bid for a 25-year license to run the Philippines power grid—privatization of the management of the Philippine government-owned National Transmission Corporation (TransCo), the consortium of Monte Oro Grid Resources Corp., led by businessman Enrique Razon, comprising the State Grid Corporation of China, and Calaca High Power Corp., won an auction conducted by the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management (PSALM) Corp. as it submitted the highest offer of $3.95 billion, for the right to operate TransCo for 25 years, outbidding San Miguel Energy, a unit of the Filipino San Miguel Corporation (bid of $3.905 billion), Dutch firm TPG Aurora BV, and Malaysia's TNB Prai Sdn Bhd.[17][18][19] This initiated the privatization process for the transmission sector. The resulting consortium became the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP).[20]\n\n\nOn February 21, 2008, NGCP was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n\nOn February 28, 2008, TransCo's concession agreement with NGCP was executed and became effective. The agreement between NGCP and TransCo was signed by TransCo president Arthur Aguilar, PSALM president Jose Ibazeta, and NGCP directors Walter Brown, Elmer Pedregosa and Du Zhigang.[21][22] In November of that same year, Congress approved bicameral resolution granting franchise to NGCP to manage and operate its transmission facilities nationwide. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Republic Act 9511 which granted NGCP to operate and manage the country's power grid in December 2008.\n\n\nOn January 15, 2009, TransCo turned over the operations, maintenance, and management of the transmission system to NGCP which marked the start of the 25-year concession period and franchise and renewable for another 25 years with a total of 50 years, which privatized the operations and maintenance of the Philippine power grid and its related assets and facilities and turned over from the Philippine government to the private sector. The franchise and concession period will end on December 1, 2058.[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n### Other countries[edit]\n\n\nIn Portugal, State Grid has a 25% stake in REN since the second stage of its privatization (in 2012–2014).[26]\n\n\nIn Australia, State Grid owns a 41% stake in ElectraNet, a 19.9% stake in AusNet Services, and 60% stake in Jemena.[27]\n\n\nIn Brazil, State Grid is involved in developing, building, and operating hydropower facilities.[11]: 207 State Grid acquired the control of CPFL Energia S.A. for the equivalent of US$3.4 billion in 2017.[28] State Grid built the 2000 km Ultra High Voltage power line delivering hydropower to the megacities Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.[29]\n\n\nIn Chile, State Grid acquired Chilquinta Energía, the third-largest distributor of electricity in Chile, and Tecnored SA, which provides construction services to Chilquinta, from U.S. power company Sempra Energy. The deal was closed on June 24, 2020.[30] On 13 November 2020, it was announced that State Grid had reached an agreement to acquire Compañia General de Electricidad (CGE), the largest distribution of electricity in this country.[31]\n\n\n\n## Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\n* State Grid Yingda Group\n\t+ Yingda International Trust (89.76%)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Energy portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* China Southern Power Grid\n* China Datang Corporation\n* List of companies of China\n* Smart grid\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"State Grid's 2017 financial report\".

It has repeatedly achieved the largest annual profits in global corporate history.

It increased its participation interest to 60% in 1974 and acquired the remaining 40% interest in 1976. Aramco continued to operate and manage the former Aramco assets, including its concessionary interest in certain Saudi Arab oil fields, on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government until 1988. In November 1988, a royal decree created a new Saudi Arab company, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, to take control of the former Aramco assets (or Saudi Aramco)[28] and took the management and operations control of Saudi Arabia's oil and gas fields from Aramco and its partners. In 1989–90, high-quality oil and gas were discovered in three areas south of Riyadh: the Raghib area about 77 miles (124 km) southeast of the capital.[29]\n\n\n\n### Persian Gulf War[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n(or Aramco).[21] In 1948, Standard Oil of New Jersey (later known as Exxon) purchased 30% and Socony Vacuum (later Mobil) purchased 10% of the company, with SoCal and Texaco retaining 30% each.[22] The newcomers were also shareholders in the Iraq Petroleum Co. and had to get the restrictions of the Red Line Agreement lifted in order to be free to enter into this arrangement.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Aramco compound in Saudi Arabia, 1954\nIn 1949, ARAMCO had made incursions into the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, leading to a border dispute between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia.[24]\nIn 1950, King Abdulaziz threatened to nationalize his country's oil facilities, thus pressuring Aramco to agree to share profits 50/50.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n127. **^** \"Wealthy Saudis Are Being Bullied Into Buying Aramco\". *OilPrice.com*.

The company has reported a fall in the net profit of its third-quarter for November 2020, due to increased crude prices and a drop in its demand following the COVID-19 pandemic.[67][68]\n\n\n\n### 2020s[edit]\n\n\nOn 10 March 2020 Saudi Aramco announced a global partnership with Formula One landing a multi year deal.[69]\n\n\nOn 17 June 2020, Saudi Aramco acquired a 70% share in SABIC, a chemicals manufacturing company.[70][71]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2019, sources told the Financial Times that wealthy families of Saudi Arabia had been coerced into joining the Saudi Aramco IPO.[126][127] According to analysts, Aramco could realistically reach a market capitalization of $1 to $1.5 trillion but the Saudis wanted $2 trillion. Oddly, many of those who signed up have relatives that were part of the 2017–2019 Saudi Arabian purge. According to four sources, the Saudi government \"strong-armed\", \"coerced\" or \"bullied\" some of the wealthiest families in the kingdom into becoming cornerstone investors.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Lobbying and research projects[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile the company did not originally plan on refining oil, the Saudi government wished to have only one company dealing with oil production. Therefore, on 1 July 1993, the government issued a royal decree merging Saudi Aramco with Samarec, the country's oil refining company. The following year, a Saudi Aramco subsidiary acquired a 40% equity interest in Petron Corporation, the largest crude oil refiner and marketer in the Philippines. Since then, Saudi Aramco has taken on the responsibility of refining oil and distributing it in the country.[13] In 2008, Saudi Aramco sold its entire stake to the Ashmore Group, a London-listed investment group. Ashmore acquired an additional 11% when it made a required tender offer to other shareholders. By July 2008, Ashmore, through its SEA Refinery Holdings B.V., had a 50.57% of Petron's stock. Ashmore's payment was made in December 2008. In December 2008, Ashmore acquired PNOC's 40% stake. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn May 2001, Saudi Arabia announced the Gas Initiative, which proposed forming three joint ventures with eight IOCs for gas exploration on pure upstream acreage.

In 2003, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalEnergies formed a partnership with Saudi Aramco in Core Venture 3.

Saudi Aramco has been exploring for oil and gas reservoirs since 1982. Most of this process takes place at the EXPEC Advanced Research Center. Originally, Saudi Aramco used Cray Supercomputers (CRAY-1M) in its EXPEC Advanced Research Center (ECC)[95] to assist in processing the colossal quantity of data obtained during exploration and in 2001, ECC decided to use Linux clusters as a replacement for the decommissioned Cray systems. ECC installed a new supercomputing system in late 2009 with a disk storage capacity of 1,050 terabytes (i.e, exceeding one petabyte), the largest storage installation in Saudi Aramco's history to support its exploration in the frontier areas and the Red Sea.[96]\n\n\n\n### Refining and chemicals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn August 2022, Saudi Aramco announced that it would acquire Valvoline's petroleum unit for $2.65 billion.[91]\n\n\nIn March 2023, Saudi Aramco announced that they had seen record profits of $161 billion as prices of petrol soared following the COVID-19 pandemic.
