The same year, the company opened a home office and first distribution center in Bentonville, Arkansas. It had 38  stores operating with 1,500 employees and sales of $44.2  million. It began trading stock as a publicly held company on October 1, 1970, and was soon listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The first stock split occurred in May 1971 for $47 per share. By this time, Wal-Mart was operating in five states: Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Oklahoma; it entered Tennessee in 1973 and Kentucky and Mississippi in 1974. As the company moved into Texas in 1975, there were 125 stores with 7,500 employees and total sales of $340.3  million.[34]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWalmart was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1972. By 1988, it was the most profitable retailer in the U.S.,[18] and it had become the largest in terms of revenue by October 1989.[19] The company was originally geographically limited to the South and lower Midwest, but it had stores from coast to coast by the early 1990s. Sam's Club opened in New Jersey in November 1989, and the first California outlet opened in Lancaster, in July 1990. A Walmart in York, Pennsylvania, opened in October 1990, the first main store in the Northeast.[20]\n\n\nWalmart's investments outside the U.S. have seen mixed results. Its operations and subsidiaries in Canada,[21] the United Kingdom (ASDA),[22] Central America, South America, and China are successful, but its ventures failed in Germany, Japan, South Korea, Brazil and Argentina.[23][24][25][26]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Walmart\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican multinational retail corporation\n\nThis article is about the retail chain.
