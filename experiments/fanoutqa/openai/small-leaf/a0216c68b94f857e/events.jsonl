If a person survived to age 20, they could expect to live around 30 years more. Life expectancy was probably slightly longer for women than men.[31]\nWhen infant mortality is factored out (i.e. counting only the 67[27]–75% who survived the first year), life expectancy is around 34–41 more years (i.e. expected to live to 35–42). When child mortality is factored out (i.e. counting only the 55-65% who survived to age 5), life expectancy is around 40–45 (i.e. age 45–50).[29] The ~50% that reached age 10 could also expect to reach ~45-50;[27] at 15 to ~48–54; at 40 to ~60;[27] at 50 to ~64–68; at 60 to ~70–72; at 70 to ~76–77.[29][31]\n |\n| Wang clan of China, 1st c.

If a large amount of data is available, a statistical population can be created that allow the age-specific death rates to be simply taken as the mortality rates actually experienced at each age (the number of deaths divided by the number of years \"exposed to risk\" in each data cell). However, it is customary to apply smoothing to remove (as much as possible) the random statistical fluctuations from one year of age to the next. In the past, a very simple model used for this purpose was the Gompertz function, but more sophisticated methods are now used.[147] The most common modern methods include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Expectations of Life\" by H.O.

For instance, the table above gives the life expectancy at birth among 13th-century English nobles as 30. Having survived to the age of 21, a male member of the English aristocracy in this period could expect to live:[38]\n\n\n\n* 1200–1300: to age 64\n* 1300–1400: to age 45 (because of the bubonic plague)\n* 1400–1500: to age 69\n* 1500–1550: to age 71\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Life expectancy** is a statistical measure of the estimate of the span of a life. The most commonly used measure is *life expectancy at birth* (LEB), which can be defined in two ways. *Cohort* LEB is the mean length of life of a birth cohort (in this case, all individuals born in a given year) and can be computed only for cohorts born so long ago that all their members have died. *Period* LEB is the mean length of life of a hypothetical cohort[1][2] assumed to be exposed, from birth through death, to the mortality rates observed at a given year.[3] National LEB figures reported by national agencies and international organizations for human populations are estimates of *period* LEB.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt is important to note that the life expectancy statistic is usually based on past mortality experience and assumes that the same age-specific mortality rates will continue. Thus, such life expectancy figures need to be adjusted for temporal trends before calculating how long a currently living individual of a particular age is expected to live. Period life expectancy remains a commonly used statistic to summarize the current health status of a population. However, for some purposes, such as pensions calculations, it is usual to adjust the life table used by assuming that age-specific death rates will continue to decrease over the years, as they have usually done in the past. That is often done by simply extrapolating past trends, but some models exist to account for the evolution of mortality, like the Lee–Carter model.[149]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"\"Life Expectancy\" – What does this actually mean?\". *Our World in Data*.

While the data required are easily identified in the case of humans, the computation of life expectancy of industrial products and wild animals involves more indirect techniques. The life expectancy and demography of wild animals are often estimated by capturing, marking, and recapturing them.[148] The life of a product, more often termed shelf life, is also computed using similar methods. In the case of long-lived components, such as those used in critical applications (e.g. aircraft), methods like accelerated aging are used to model the life expectancy of a component.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 70.7 years instead of 31.6 years, Botswana\n* 69.9 years instead of 41.5 years, South Africa\n* 70.5 years instead of 31.8 years, Zimbabwe\n\n\nActual life expectancy in Botswana declined from 65 in 1990 to 49 in 2000 before increasing to 66 in 2011.

This confusion may create the expectation that an adult would be unlikely to exceed an life expectancy, even though, with all statistical probability, an adult, who has already avoided many statistical causes of adolescent mortality, should be expected to outlive the life expectancy calculated from birth.[157] One must compare the life expectancy of the period after childhood to estimate also the life expectancy of an adult.[157]\n\n\n  \n\nLife expectancy can change dramatically after childhood. In the table above, note the life expectancy *at birth* in the Paleolithic is 22–33 years, but life expectancy at 15 is 54 years. Additional studies similarly show a dramatic increase in life expectancy once adulthood was reached.[158][159]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy definition, life expectancy is an arithmetic mean. It can also be calculated by integrating the survival curve from 0 to positive infinity (or equivalently to the maximum lifespan, sometimes called 'omega'). For an extinct or completed cohort (all people born in the year 1850, for example), it can of course simply be calculated by averaging the ages at death. For cohorts with some survivors, it is estimated by using mortality experience in recent years. The estimates are called period cohort life expectancies.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo assess the quality of these additional years of life, 'healthy life expectancy' has been calculated for the last 30 years. Since 2001, the World Health Organization has published statistics called **Healthy life expectancy** (**HALE**), defined as the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\" excluding the years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury.[150][151] Since 2004, Eurostat publishes annual statistics called Healthy Life Years (HLY) based on reported activity limitations. The United States uses similar indicators in the framework of the national health promotion and disease prevention plan \"Healthy People 2010\". More and more countries are using health expectancy indicators to monitor the health of their population.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"Life expectancy at birth, total (years) – Data\". *data.worldbank.org*.\n48. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \n\"Life Expectancy by Country and in the World - Worldometer\". *www.worldometers.info*.\n49. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Actuarial Life Table\".

The concept of life expectancy may also be used in the context of manufactured objects,[9] though the related term[*dubious – discuss*] shelf life is commonly used for consumer products, and the terms \"mean time to breakdown\" and \"mean time between failures\" are used in engineering.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest documented work on life expectancy was done in the 1660s by John Graunt,[10] Christiaan Huygens, and Lodewijck Huygens.[11]\n\n\n\n## Human patterns[edit]\n\n\n### Maximum[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n17th-century English life expectancy was only about 35 years, largely because infant and child mortality remained high. Life expectancy was under 25 years in the early Colony of Virginia,[50] and in seventeenth-century New England, about 40% died before reaching adulthood.[51] During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically.[52] The under-5 mortality rate in London decreased from 74.5% (in 1730–1749) to 31.8% (in 1810–1829).[53][54]\n\n\nPublic health measures are credited with much of the recent increase in life expectancy. During the 20th century, despite a brief drop due to the 1918 flu pandemic,[55] the average lifespan in the United States increased by more than 30 years, of which 25 years can be attributed to advances in public health.[56]\n\n\n\n### Regional variations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of countries by life expectancy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of this sensitivity, LEB can be grossly misinterpreted, leading to the belief that a population with a low LEB would have a small proportion of older people.[4] A different measure, such as life expectancy at age 5 (e5), can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood. For instance, in a society with a life expectancy of 30, it may nevertheless be common to have a 40-year remaining timespan at age 5 (but perhaps not a 60-year one).\n\n\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, infant mortality was approximately 40–60% of the total mortality. Excluding child mortality, the average life expectancy during the 12th–19th centuries was approximately 55 years. If a person survived childhood, they had about a 50% chance of living 50–55 years, instead of only 25–40 years.[5] As of 2016, the overall worldwide life expectancy had reached the highest level that has been measured in modern times.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** \"Life expectancy at birth, total (years)—Data\".\n62. **^** \"\"World Population Prospects—The 2002 Revision\", 2003, page 24\".\n63. **^** \"GHO—By category—Life expectancy—Data by country\".\n64. **^** \"Wealth & Health of Nations\".

This is usually more complex than simply forecasting life expectancy because the analyst must deal with correlated age-specific mortality rates, but it seems to be more robust than simple one-dimensional time series approaches. It also yields a set of age-specific rates that may be used to derive other measures, such as survival curves or life expectancies at different ages. The most important approach in this group is the Lee-Carter model,[153] which uses the singular value decomposition on a set of transformed age-specific mortality rates to reduce their dimensionality to a single time series, forecasts that time series, and then recovers a full set of age-specific mortality rates from that forecasted value. The software includes Professor Rob J. Hyndman's R package called 'demography' and UC Berkeley's LCFIT system.\n\n\n## Policy uses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n147. **^** Anderson, Robert N.

The modal age at death is the age when most deaths occur in a population, and is sometimes used instead of life expectancy for this kind of understanding. For example, in the table above, life expectancy in the Paleolithic is listed as 22–33 years. For many, this implies that most people in the Paleolithic died in their late twenties. However, in the Paleolithic, most adults in the Paleolithic died at *72 years* (the average modal adult life span).[161]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Biodemography\n* Calorie restriction\n* Demography\n* Depreciation\n* DNA damage theory of aging\n* Glasgow effect\n* Health equity\n* Life extension\n* Life table\n* Lindy effect\n* List of countries by life expectancy\n* List of countries by past life expectancy\n* List of longest-living organisms\n* LGBT life expectancy\n* Maximum life span\n* Medieval demography\n* Mitohormesis\n* Mortality rate\n* Population pyramid\n* Senescence\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nForecasting life expectancy and mortality form an important subdivision of demography. Future trends in life expectancy have huge implications for old-age support programs (like U.S. Social Security and pension) since the cash flow in these systems depends on the number of recipients who are still living (along with the rate of return on the investments or the tax rate in pay-as-you-go systems). With longer life expectancies, the systems see increased cash outflow; if the systems underestimate increases in life-expectancies, they will be unprepared for the large payments that will occur, as humans live longer and longer.\n\n\nLife expectancy forecasting is usually based on one of two different approaches:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** X.

If a large amount of data is available, a statistical population can be created that allow the age-specific death rates to be simply taken as the mortality rates actually experienced at each age (the number of deaths divided by the number of years \"exposed to risk\" in each data cell). However, it is customary to apply smoothing to remove (as much as possible) the random statistical fluctuations from one year of age to the next.

Life expectancy was under 25 years in the early Colony of Virginia,[50] and in seventeenth-century New England, about 40% died before reaching adulthood.[51] During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically.[52] The under-5 mortality rate in London decreased from 74.5% (in 1730–1749) to 31.8% (in 1810–1829).[53][54]\n\n\nPublic health measures are credited with much of the recent increase in life expectancy. During the 20th century, despite a brief drop due to the 1918 flu pandemic,[55] the average lifespan in the United States increased by more than 30 years, of which 25 years can be attributed to advances in public health.[56]\n\n\n\n### Regional variations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of countries by life expectancy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** \"Life expectancy at birth, total (years)—Data\".\n62. **^** \"\"World Population Prospects—The 2002 Revision\", 2003, page 24\".\n63. **^** \"GHO—By category—Life expectancy—Data by country\".\n64. **^** \"Wealth & Health of Nations\".

Since 2001, the World Health Organization has published statistics called **Healthy life expectancy** (**HALE**), defined as the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\" excluding the years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury.[150][151] Since 2004, Eurostat publishes annual statistics called Healthy Life Years (HLY) based on reported activity limitations. The United States uses similar indicators in the framework of the national health promotion and disease prevention plan \"Healthy People 2010\". More and more countries are using health expectancy indicators to monitor the health of their population.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Life expectancy** is a statistical measure of the estimate of the span of a life. The most commonly used measure is *life expectancy at birth* (LEB), which can be defined in two ways. *Cohort* LEB is the mean length of life of a birth cohort (in this case, all individuals born in a given year) and can be computed only for cohorts born so long ago that all their members have died. *Period* LEB is the mean length of life of a hypothetical cohort[1][2] assumed to be exposed, from birth through death, to the mortality rates observed at a given year.[3] National LEB figures reported by national agencies and international organizations for human populations are estimates of *period* LEB.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt is important to note that the life expectancy statistic is usually based on past mortality experience and assumes that the same age-specific mortality rates will continue. Thus, such life expectancy figures need to be adjusted for temporal trends before calculating how long a currently living individual of a particular age is expected to live. Period life expectancy remains a commonly used statistic to summarize the current health status of a population. However, for some purposes, such as pensions calculations, it is usual to adjust the life table used by assuming that age-specific death rates will continue to decrease over the years, as they have usually done in the past. That is often done by simply extrapolating past trends, but some models exist to account for the evolution of mortality, like the Lee–Carter model.[149]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. Forecasting the life expectancy directly, generally using ARIMA or other time-series extrapolation procedures. This has the advantage of simplicity, but it cannot account for changes in mortality at specific ages, and the forecast number cannot be used to derive other life table results. Analyses and forecasts using this approach can be done with any common statistical/mathematical software package, like EViews, R, SAS, Stata, Matlab, or SPSS.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2. Forecasting age-specific death rates and computing the life expectancy from the results with life table methods. This is usually more complex than simply forecasting life expectancy because the analyst must deal with correlated age-specific mortality rates, but it seems to be more robust than simple one-dimensional time series approaches. It also yields a set of age-specific rates that may be used to derive other measures, such as survival curves or life expectancies at different ages. The most important approach in this group is the Lee-Carter model,[153] which uses the singular value decomposition on a set of transformed age-specific mortality rates to reduce their dimensionality to a single time series, forecasts that time series, and then recovers a full set of age-specific mortality rates from that forecasted value. The software includes Professor Rob J. Hyndman's R package called 'demography' and UC Berkeley's LCFIT system.\n\n\n## Policy uses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"Life expectancy at birth, total (years) – Data\". *data.worldbank.org*.\n48. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \n\"Life Expectancy by Country and in the World - Worldometer\". *www.worldometers.info*.\n49. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Actuarial Life Table\".

It can also be calculated by integrating the survival curve from 0 to positive infinity (or equivalently to the maximum lifespan, sometimes called 'omega'). For an extinct or completed cohort (all people born in the year 1850, for example), it can of course simply be calculated by averaging the ages at death. For cohorts with some survivors, it is estimated by using mortality experience in recent years. The estimates are called period cohort life expectancies.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFurther information: Longevity and List of countries by past life expectancy\n\nThe following information is derived from the 1961 *Encyclopædia Britannica* and other sources, some with questionable accuracy. Unless otherwise stated, it represents estimates of the life expectancies of the world population as a whole. In many instances, life expectancy varied considerably according to class and gender.\n\n\nLife expectancy at birth takes account of infant mortality and child mortality but not prenatal mortality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe age-specific death rates are calculated separately for separate groups of data that are believed to have different mortality rates (such as males and females, or smokers and non-smokers) and are then used to calculate a life table from which one can calculate the probability of surviving to each age. While the data required are easily identified in the case of humans, the computation of life expectancy of industrial products and wild animals involves more indirect techniques. The life expectancy and demography of wild animals are often estimated by capturing, marking, and recapturing them.[148] The life of a product, more often termed shelf life, is also computed using similar methods. In the case of long-lived components, such as those used in critical applications (e.g. aircraft), methods like accelerated aging are used to model the life expectancy of a component.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nForecasting life expectancy and mortality form an important subdivision of demography. Future trends in life expectancy have huge implications for old-age support programs (like U.S. Social Security and pension) since the cash flow in these systems depends on the number of recipients who are still living (along with the rate of return on the investments or the tax rate in pay-as-you-go systems). With longer life expectancies, the systems see increased cash outflow; if the systems underestimate increases in life-expectancies, they will be unprepared for the large payments that will occur, as humans live longer and longer.\n\n\nLife expectancy forecasting is usually based on one of two different approaches:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Increasing life expectancy[edit]\n\n\n* Strategies for engineered negligible senescence (SENS)\n* John Sperling\n* Life extension\n* Longevity\n* Rejuvenation\n* Public health\n* Infant mortality\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** In standard actuarial notation, *ex* refers to the expected future lifetime of *(x)* in whole years, while *eͦx* (with a ring above the *e*) denotes the complete expected future lifetime of *(x)*, including the fraction.\n2. **^** Japan's recorded life expectancy may have been very slightly increased by counting many infant deaths as stillborn.[58]\n3. **^**  Note the different units: a probability is unit-less, whereas a mortality rate has units (such as deaths per population per year).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of this sensitivity, LEB can be grossly misinterpreted, leading to the belief that a population with a low LEB would have a small proportion of older people.[4] A different measure, such as life expectancy at age 5 (e5), can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood. For instance, in a society with a life expectancy of 30, it may nevertheless be common to have a 40-year remaining timespan at age 5 (but perhaps not a 60-year one).\n\n\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, infant mortality was approximately 40–60% of the total mortality. Excluding child mortality, the average life expectancy during the 12th–19th centuries was approximately 55 years. If a person survived childhood, they had about a 50% chance of living 50–55 years, instead of only 25–40 years.[5] As of 2016, the overall worldwide life expectancy had reached the highest level that has been measured in modern times.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n125. **^** \"Diabetes Life Expectancy – Type 1 and Type 2 Life Expectancy\".

This confusion may create the expectation that an adult would be unlikely to exceed an life expectancy, even though, with all statistical probability, an adult, who has already avoided many statistical causes of adolescent mortality, should be expected to outlive the life expectancy calculated from birth.[157] One must compare the life expectancy of the period after childhood to estimate also the life expectancy of an adult.[157]\n\n\n  \n\nLife expectancy can change dramatically after childhood. In the table above, note the life expectancy *at birth* in the Paleolithic is 22–33 years, but life expectancy at 15 is 54 years. Additional studies similarly show a dramatic increase in life expectancy once adulthood was reached.[158][159]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLife expectancy is one of the factors in measuring the Human Development Index (HDI) of each nation along with adult literacy, education, and standard of living.[154]\n\n\nLife expectancy is used in describing the physical quality of life of an area. It is also used for an individual when the value of a life settlement is determined a life insurance policy is sold for a cash asset.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nDisparities in life expectancy are often cited as demonstrating the need for better medical care or increased social support. A strongly associated indirect measure is income inequality. For the top 21 industrialized countries, if each person is counted equally, life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries (r = −0.907).[155] There is a similar relationship among states in the U.S. (r = −0.620).[156]\n\n\n\n## Life expectancy vs. other measures of longevity[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to a paper from 2015, the mortality rate for the Caucasian population in the United States from 1993 to 2001 is four times higher[*dubious – discuss*] for those who did not complete high school compared to those who have at least 16 years of education.[130] In fact, within the U.S. adult population, people with less than a high school education have the shortest life expectancies.\n\n\nPreschool education also plays a large role in life expectancy. It was found that high-quality early-stage childhood education had positive effects on health. Researchers discovered this by analyzing the results of the Carolina Abecedarian Project, finding that the disadvantaged children who were randomly assigned to treatment had lower instances of risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in their mid-30s.[132]\n\n\n\n## Evolution and aging rate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Life history theory\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) vs GDP per Capita in different countries](image)Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) vs GDP per Capita in different countries\nThe long-standing quest for longer life led in the 2010s to a more promising focus on increasing HALE, also known as a person's \"healthspan\".

For example, in the United Kingdom, life expectancy in the wealthiest and richest areas is several years higher than in the poorest areas. This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle, as well as access to medical care. It may also reflect a selective effect: people with chronic life-threatening illnesses are less likely to become wealthy or to reside in affluent areas.[72] In Glasgow, the disparity is amongst the highest in the world: life expectancy for males in the heavily deprived Calton area stands at 54, which is 28 years less than in the affluent area of Lenzie, which is only 8 km (5.0 mi) away.[73][74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCities also experience a wide range of life expectancy based on neighborhood breakdowns. This is largely due to economic clustering and poverty conditions that tend to associate based on geographic location. Multi-generational poverty found in struggling neighborhoods also contributes. In United States cities such as Cincinnati, the life expectancy gap between low income and high-income neighborhoods touches 20 years.[69]\n\n\n\n### Economic circumstances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have found an increased risk of death in the mentally ill.[122][123][124]\n\n\n\n### Other illnesses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Post-COVID life expectancy in the US, UK, Netherlands, and Austria\nThe life expectancy of people with diabetes, which is 9.3% of the U.S. population, is reduced by roughly 10–20 years.[125][126] People over 60 years old with Alzheimer's disease have about a 50% life expectancy of 3–10 years.[127] Other demographics that tend to have a lower life expectancy than average include transplant recipients[128] and the obese.[129]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nEducation on all levels has been shown to be strongly associated with increased life expectancy.[130] This association may be due partly to higher income,[131] which can lead to increased life expectancy. Despite the association, among identical twin pairs with different education levels, there is only weak evidence of a relationship between educational attainment and adult mortality.[130]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLife expectancy can also create popular misconceptions about at what age a certain population may expect to die at. The modal age at death is the age when most deaths occur in a population, and is sometimes used instead of life expectancy for this kind of understanding. For example, in the table above, life expectancy in the Paleolithic is listed as 22–33 years. For many, this implies that most people in the Paleolithic died in their late twenties. However, in the Paleolithic, most adults in the Paleolithic died at *72 years* (the average modal adult life span).[161]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Biodemography\n* Calorie restriction\n* Demography\n* Depreciation\n* DNA damage theory of aging\n* Glasgow effect\n* Health equity\n* Life extension\n* Life table\n* Lindy effect\n* List of countries by life expectancy\n* List of countries by past life expectancy\n* List of longest-living organisms\n* LGBT life expectancy\n* Maximum life span\n* Medieval demography\n* Mitohormesis\n* Mortality rate\n* Population pyramid\n* Senescence\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Arthur O'Sullivan; Steven M.

This is the average number of years a newborn would live if age-specific mortality rates in the current year were to stay the same throughout its life. The data is taken from the 2020 and 2022 United Nations World Population Prospects.[6][7] It is also used to calculate the Human Development Index. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. Due to this criterion, the table does not include Monaco (LE 85.9 years, population 39,000). By default, the list is sorted by 2021. Data for 2021 can also be viewed via Our World in Data.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nList of countries according to life expectancy figures from different sources\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of the life expectancy at birth in 2019 in the world (2020 report) \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ≥ 82.5\n 80.0 – 82.4\n 77.5 – 79.9\n 75.0 – 77.4\n | 72.5 – 74.9\n 70.0 – 72.4\n 67.5 – 69.9\n 65.0 – 67.4\n | 62.5 – 64.9\n 60.0 – 62.4\n 55.0 – 59.9\n < 55.0\n No data\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe life expectancy is shown separately for males and for females, as well as a combined figure. Several non-sovereign entities and territories are also included in this list.\n\n\nThe figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including HIV infections.\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the current century there is a tendency to also estimate **Healthy life expectancy** (HALE) — the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\".[1][2]\n\n\nComparing life expectancies across countries can be problematic. For example, due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. This is especially true for Healthy life expectancy, the definition of which criteria may change over time, even within a country.\n\n\n\n## World Bank Group (2021)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Healthy life expectancy (HALE) at 60 (years)\".

The data is differentiated by gender, presenting life expectancies for males, females, and a combined average. In addition to sovereign nations, the list encompasses several non-sovereign entities and territories. The figures serve as an indicator of the quality of healthcare in the respective countries and are influenced by various factors, including the prevalence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This article introduces the concept of Healthy life expectancy (HALE), which denotes the average number of years a person is expected to live in \"full health\". There are challenges in comparing life expectancies across countries due to disparities in data reporting and collection standards. The primary source of the most recent data presented is the World Bank Group's 2021 report.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Mozambique | 57.10 | 55.76 | 58.49\n | 2.73\n |\n| ![](image) Somalia | 55.72 | 53.39 | 58.12\n | 4.73\n |\n| ![](image) Central African Republic | 55.52 | 54.19 | 56.88\n | 2.69\n |\n| ![](image) Afghanistan | 53.65 | 52.10 | 54.28\n | 2.18\n |\n|  World (2020) | 70.50 | 68.40 | 72.60\n | 4.20\n |\n| *![](image) European Union (2021)* | 77.63 | 72.98 | 82.51\n | 9.53\n |\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Comparison of average female and male life expectancy as defined by WHO for 2019.

This is the average number of years a newborn would live if age-specific mortality rates in the current year were to stay the same throughout its life. The data is taken from the 2020 and 2022 United Nations World Population Prospects.[6][7] It is also used to calculate the Human Development Index. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. Due to this criterion, the table does not include Monaco (LE 85.9 years, population 39,000). By default, the list is sorted by 2021. Data for 2021 can also be viewed via Our World in Data.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe life expectancy is shown separately for males and for females, as well as a combined figure. Several non-sovereign entities and territories are also included in this list.\n\n\nThe figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including HIV infections.\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the current century there is a tendency to also estimate **Healthy life expectancy** (HALE) — the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\".[1][2]\n\n\nComparing life expectancies across countries can be problematic. For example, due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. This is especially true for Healthy life expectancy, the definition of which criteria may change over time, even within a country.\n\n\n\n## World Bank Group (2021)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis **list of countries by life expectancy** provides a comprehensive list of countries alongside their respective life expectancy figures. The data is differentiated by gender, presenting life expectancies for males, females, and a combined average. In addition to sovereign nations, the list encompasses several non-sovereign entities and territories. The figures serve as an indicator of the quality of healthcare in the respective countries and are influenced by various factors, including the prevalence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This article introduces the concept of Healthy life expectancy (HALE), which denotes the average number of years a person is expected to live in \"full health\". There are challenges in comparing life expectancies across countries due to disparities in data reporting and collection standards. The primary source of the most recent data presented is the World Bank Group's 2021 report.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Healthy life expectancy (HALE) at 60 (years)\".
