Founded in 1386 on instruction of Pope Urban VI, Heidelberg is Germany's oldest university and one of the world's oldest surviving universities; it was the third university established in the Holy Roman Empire after Vienna and Prague. Since 1899, it has been a coeducational institution. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 18 October 1386 a special Pontifical High Mass in the *Heiliggeistkirche* was the ceremony that established the university.[19] On 19 October 1386 the first lecture was held,[19] making Heidelberg the oldest university in Germany.[21] In November 1386, Marsilius of Inghen was elected first rector of the university.[22] The rector seal motto was *semper apertus*\u2014i.e., \"the book of learning is always open.\"[23] The university grew quickly and in March 1390, 185 students were enrolled at the university.[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Solemn Mass was offered in the *Heiliggeistkirche* in 1386 to mark and bless the establishment of the university.\n### Late Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nBetween 1414 and 1418, theology and jurisprudence professors of the university took part in the Council of Constance and acted as counselors for Louis III, who attended this council as representative of the emperor and chief magistrate of the realm. This resulted in establishing a good reputation for the university and its professors.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBesides several federal ministers of Germany and prime ministers of German states, five chancellors of Germany have attended the university, the latest being Helmut Kohl, the \"Chancellor of the Reunification\". Heads of state or government of Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Nicaragua, Serbia, Thailand, a British heir apparent, a secretary general of NATO and a director of the International Peace Bureau have also been educated at Heidelberg; among them Nobel Peace laureates Charles Albert Gobat and Auguste Beernaert. Former university affiliates in the field of religion include Pope Pius II, cardinals, bishops, and with Philipp Melanchthon and Zacharias Ursinus, two key leaders of the Protestant Reformation. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** The university does not include departments of business, visual arts, and engineering, except for computer engineering.

It was demolished by the socialist administration in 1968.\nThe university was modelled on the University of Prague, from which the German-speaking faculty members withdrew to Leipzig after the Jan Hus crisis and the Decree of Kutn\u00e1 Hora. The *Alma mater Lipsiensis* opened in 1409, after it had been officially chartered by Pope Alexander V in his *Bull of Acknowledgment* on (9 September of that year). Its first rector was Johannes Otto von M\u00fcnsterberg. From its foundation, the Paulinerkirche served as the university church. After the Reformation, the church and the monastery buildings were donated to the university in 1544. In order to secure independent and sustainable funding, the university was endowed with the lordship over nine villages east of Leipzig (university villages). It kept this status for nearly 400 years until land reforms were carried out in the 19th century. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university was kept open throughout World War II, even after the destruction of its buildings. During the war the acting rector, Erich Maschke, described the continuation of the university in a memo on 11 May 1945, announcing the vote for a new rector:\n\n\n\n\n> Since 4 December 1943 a fixed determination not to abandon the Leipzig University in the most difficult hour of its more than five-hundred-year history has bonded the professors with each other and with the students. The special task of repairing the damage caused by air attacks has now broadened out to the more general duty to save the continuity of our university and preserve its substance, at the very least its indestructible kernel, through the crisis that has now reached its fullest stage. After the destruction of most of the buildings and the majority of its libraries, this kernel is represented by the professoriate alone. This is what must be preserved as the great repository of value in the university.[6]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBesides the faculties and other teaching institutions, several other bodies serve the university: the University Library, a university archive and administration, numerous museums (e.g. the Museum for Music Instruments and the Museum of Ancient Egypt) and the university hospital. The university's Leipzig Botanical Garden, the second-oldest botanical garden in Europe. was established in 1542.\nThe university's Musical Instrument Museum includes one of the world's three surviving pianos built by Bartolomeo Cristofori, the piano's inventor. Five other Cristofori instruments are included in the museum's collections.[9]\n\n\nKey Central institutions[10] of the university are\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Luo Gan, Chinese Politician, Member of the Politburo Standing Committee\n* Johann Major, German Lutheran theologian, a principal author of the so-called Leipzig Interim, and author of the Majoristic Controversy\n* Angela Merkel, first female German Chancellor\n* Hans-Dietrich Genscher, German politician, Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor\n* Rudolph Sohm, lawyer and Church historian\n* Cai Yuanpei, president of Peking University and leading thinker in the early Chinese communist movement\n* Michelle Bachelet, first female President of Chile between 2006 and 2010\n* Selig Brodetsky, Israeli President of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem\n* Raila Amolo Odinga, Kenyan politician\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n* Luz Long, German Olympic long-jumper, noted for his sportsmanship\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Handelshochschule Leipzig (HHL)\n* Leipzig school (sociology)\n* List of medieval universities\n* List of universities in Germany\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Its first rector was Johannes Nauclerus.\n\n\nIts present name was conferred on it in 1769 by Duke Karl Eugen who appended his first name to that of the founder. The university later became the principal university of the kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg. Today, it is one of nine state universities funded by the German federal state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe University of T\u00fcbingen has a history of innovative thought, particularly in theology, in which the university and the T\u00fcbinger Stift are famous to this day. Philipp Melanchthon (1497\u20131560), the prime mover in building the German school system and a chief figure in the Protestant Reformation, helped establish its direction. Among T\u00fcbingen's eminent students (and/or professors) have been the astronomer Johannes Kepler; the economist Horst K\u00f6hler (President of Germany); Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI), poet Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin, and the philosophers Friedrich Schelling and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. \"The T\u00fcbingen Three\" refers to H\u00f6lderlin, Hegel and Schelling, who were roommates at the T\u00fcbinger Stift. Theologian Helmut Thielicke revived postwar T\u00fcbingen when he took over a professorship at the reopened theological faculty in 1947, being made administrative head of the university and President of the Chancellor's Conference in 1951. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:University of T\u00fcbingen alumni\n\n* ![Horst K\u00f6hler, President of Germany (2004\u20132010) and Head of the International Monetary Fund (2000\u20132004)](image)\n\nHorst K\u00f6hler, President of Germany (2004\u20132010) and Head of the International Monetary Fund (2000\u20132004)\n* ![Roman Herzog, President of Germany (1994\u20131999) and judge of the Federal Constitutional Court (1983\u20131994)](image)\n\nRoman Herzog, President of Germany (1994\u20131999) and judge of the Federal Constitutional Court (1983\u20131994)\n* ![G\u00fcnther Oettinger, European Commissioner (2010\u20132019)](image)\n\nG\u00fcnther Oettinger, European Commissioner (2010\u20132019)\n* ![J\u00fcrgen Stark, Chief Economist and Member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank (2006\u20132012)](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Eberhard Karls Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen \u2013 Organe der Universit\u00e4t: Senat Archived 7 June 2007 at the Wayback Machine.

T\u00fcbingen is therefore sometimes considered as the home of German idealism, a philosophical movement which had a severe impact on modern western thinking.\n\n\n\n## Nobel laureates[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Christiane N\u00fcsslein-Volhard (2007)\nFaculty members and alumni who have been awarded with the Nobel Prize:[37]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGerman Excellence Universities\n |\n| --- |\n| Current | * RWTH Aachen (2007\u2013)\n* Free University of Berlin (2007\u2013)\n* Humboldt University of Berlin (2012\u2013)\n* Technical University of Berlin (2019\u2013)\n* Charit\u00e9 (2019\u2013)\n* University of Bonn (2019\u2013)\n* TU Dresden (2012\u2013)\n* University of Hamburg (2019\u2013)\n* University of Heidelberg (2007\u2013)\n* Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (2006\u20132012; 2019\u2013)\n* University of Konstanz (2007\u2013)\n* Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (2006\u2013)\n* Technical University of Munich (2006\u2013)\n* University of T\u00fcbingen (2012\u2013)\n |\n| Former | * University of Bremen (2012\u20132019)\n* University of Cologne (2012\u20132019)\n* University of Freiburg (2007\u20132012)\n* University of G\u00f6ttingen (2007\u20132012)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. **^** \"Humboldt-Professuren | Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen\". *uni-tuebingen.de*.

Today, these are mainly used by smaller humanities departments, as is the adjacent medieval castle, *Schloss Hohent\u00fcbingen*.\n* Northeast of the old town, the *Wilhelmstra\u00dfe* area surrounding the street of the same name is home to larger humanities departments as well as the university's administration. The main university library and main refectory are also in this area.\n* A new campus for the sciences was built in the 1970s at *Morgenstelle*, a hill north of the historic centre of T\u00fcbingen. Facilities include a large refectory.![](image)Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, part of the *Klinikum*\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversities in Germany\n |\n| --- |\n| Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg | * Heidelberg\n* Freiburg\n* Karlsruhe\n* Konstanz\n* Mannheim\n* Hohenheim\n* Stuttgart\n* T\u00fcbingen\n* Ulm\n* Zeppelin University\n |\n| Bavaria | * Augsburg\n* Bamberg\n* Bayreuth\n* Eichst\u00e4tt-Ingolstadt\n* Erlangen-Nuremberg\n* Ingolstadt\n* LMU Munich\n* BU Munich\n* TU Munich\n* Ukrainian Free University in Munich\n* Passau\n* Regensburg\n* W\u00fcrzburg\n |\n| Berlin | * Berlin University of the Arts\n* FU Berlin\n* HU Berlin\n* TU Berlin\n |\n| Brandenburg | * TU Brandenburg\n* Frankfurt (Oder)\n* Potsdam\n |\n| Bremen | * Bremen\n* Constructor University\n |\n| Hamburg | * Hamburg\n* TU Hamburg\n* HafenCity University Hamburg\n* Helmut Schmidt University\n |\n| Hesse | * TU Darmstadt\n* Frankfurt (Main)\n* Giessen\n* Kassel\n* Marburg\n |\n| Lower Saxony | * TU Braunschweig\n* TU Clausthal\n* G\u00f6ttingen\n* Hannover\n* Hildesheim\n* L\u00fcneburg\n* Oldenburg\n* Osnabr\u00fcck\n* Vechta\n |\n| Mecklenburg-Vorpommern | * Greifswald\n* Rostock\n |\n| North Rhine-Westphalia | * Aachen\n* Bielefeld\n* Bochum\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGerman U15\n |\n| --- |\n| * Free University of Berlin (FU Berlin)\n* Humboldt University Berlin (HU Berlin)\n* University of Bonn\n* University of Cologne\n* University of Freiburg\n* Goethe University Frankfurt\n* University of G\u00f6ttingen\n* University of Hamburg (UHH)\n* Heidelberg University\n* Leipzig University\n* University of Mainz\n* Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU)\n* University of M\u00fcnster (WWU)\n* University of T\u00fcbingen\n* University of W\u00fcrzburg\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe MUT \u2013 and thus the Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcbingen \u2013 is the only university institution in the world to house artefacts with world heritage status, such as the oldest surviving figurative works of art and musical instruments of humanity, mammoth ivory figures and fragments of bone flutes. These come from the Vogelherdh\u00f6hle (Swabian Alb), which has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage \"Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura\" since 2017.\n\n\n\n## Libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Entrance to the Historical Reading Hall of the University Library of T\u00fcbingen\nThe University Library of T\u00fcbingen is not just available to those affiliated with the university, but also to the general public. The library provides more than three million individual volumes and more than 7,600 journals. Apart from the main library, more than 80 departmental libraries containing an additional three million volumes are also associated with the university.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university also offers gym and sports classes called *Hochschulsport*.[31] Since T\u00fcbingen has a department of sports science with a broad range of facilities, students of other subjects have the possibility to participate in various kinds of sports courses in teams or as individuals. Furthermore, even exotic sports, such as parachuting or martial arts, are offered. Students may attend courses either for free or at reduced rates. The sports department is located close to the *Wilhelmstra\u00dfe* area of university buildings and is served by a number of frequent bus routes.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bonn\n* Cologne\n* TU Dortmund\n* Duisburg-Essen\n* D\u00fcsseldorf\n* Hagen\n* M\u00fcnster\n* Paderborn\n* Siegen\n* Witten/Herdecke\n* Wuppertal\n |\n| Rhineland-Palatinate | * University of Kaiserslautern-Landau\n* University of Koblenz\n* Mainz\n* Speyer\n* Trier\n |\n| Saarland | * Saarland\n |\n| Saxony | * TU Chemnitz\n* TU Dresden\n* TU Freiberg\n* Leipzig\n |\n| Saxony-Anhalt | * Halle-Wittenberg\n* Magdeburg\n |\n| Schleswig-Holstein | * Flensburg\n* Kiel\n* L\u00fcbeck\n |\n| Thuringia | * Erfurt\n* TU Ilmenau\n* Jena\n* Weimar\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
