Founded in 1386 on instruction of Pope Urban VI, Heidelberg is Germany's oldest university and one of the world's oldest surviving universities; it was the third university established in the Holy Roman Empire after Vienna and Prague. Since 1899, it has been a coeducational institution. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 18 October 1386 a special Pontifical High Mass in the *Heiliggeistkirche* was the ceremony that established the university.[19] On 19 October 1386 the first lecture was held,[19] making Heidelberg the oldest university in Germany.[21] In November 1386, Marsilius of Inghen was elected first rector of the university.[22] The rector seal motto was *semper apertus*—i.e., \"the book of learning is always open.\"[23] The university grew quickly and in March 1390, 185 students were enrolled at the university.[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Solemn Mass was offered in the *Heiliggeistkirche* in 1386 to mark and bless the establishment of the university.\n### Late Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nBetween 1414 and 1418, theology and jurisprudence professors of the university took part in the Council of Constance and acted as counselors for Louis III, who attended this council as representative of the emperor and chief magistrate of the realm. This resulted in establishing a good reputation for the university and its professors.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBesides several federal ministers of Germany and prime ministers of German states, five chancellors of Germany have attended the university, the latest being Helmut Kohl, the \"Chancellor of the Reunification\". Heads of state or government of Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Nicaragua, Serbia, Thailand, a British heir apparent, a secretary general of NATO and a director of the International Peace Bureau have also been educated at Heidelberg; among them Nobel Peace laureates Charles Albert Gobat and Auguste Beernaert. Former university affiliates in the field of religion include Pope Pius II, cardinals, bishops, and with Philipp Melanchthon and Zacharias Ursinus, two key leaders of the Protestant Reformation. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** The university does not include departments of business, visual arts, and engineering, except for computer engineering.

It was demolished by the socialist administration in 1968.\nThe university was modelled on the University of Prague, from which the German-speaking faculty members withdrew to Leipzig after the Jan Hus crisis and the Decree of Kutná Hora. The *Alma mater Lipsiensis* opened in 1409, after it had been officially chartered by Pope Alexander V in his *Bull of Acknowledgment* on (9 September of that year). Its first rector was Johannes Otto von Münsterberg. From its foundation, the Paulinerkirche served as the university church. After the Reformation, the church and the monastery buildings were donated to the university in 1544. In order to secure independent and sustainable funding, the university was endowed with the lordship over nine villages east of Leipzig (university villages). It kept this status for nearly 400 years until land reforms were carried out in the 19th century. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university was kept open throughout World War II, even after the destruction of its buildings. During the war the acting rector, Erich Maschke, described the continuation of the university in a memo on 11 May 1945, announcing the vote for a new rector:\n\n\n\n\n> Since 4 December 1943 a fixed determination not to abandon the Leipzig University in the most difficult hour of its more than five-hundred-year history has bonded the professors with each other and with the students. The special task of repairing the damage caused by air attacks has now broadened out to the more general duty to save the continuity of our university and preserve its substance, at the very least its indestructible kernel, through the crisis that has now reached its fullest stage. After the destruction of most of the buildings and the majority of its libraries, this kernel is represented by the professoriate alone. This is what must be preserved as the great repository of value in the university.[6]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBesides the faculties and other teaching institutions, several other bodies serve the university: the University Library, a university archive and administration, numerous museums (e.g. the Museum for Music Instruments and the Museum of Ancient Egypt) and the university hospital. The university's Leipzig Botanical Garden, the second-oldest botanical garden in Europe. was established in 1542.\nThe university's Musical Instrument Museum includes one of the world's three surviving pianos built by Bartolomeo Cristofori, the piano's inventor.

The University of Tübingen is especially known as a centre for the study of plant biology, medicine, law, archeology, ancient cultures, philosophy, theology, religious studies, humanities, and more recently as a center of excellence for artificial intelligence. The university's noted alumni and faculty include presidents, a pope, EU Commissioners, and judges of the Federal Constitutional Court. The university is associated with eleven Nobel laureates, especially in the fields of medicine and chemistry. \n\n\n\n![](image)The *Neue Aula*\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Württemberg\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe University of Tübingen was founded in 1477 by Count Eberhard V (Eberhard im Bart, 1445–1496), later the first Duke of Württemberg, a civic and ecclesiastic reformer who established the school after becoming absorbed in the Renaissance revival of learning during his travels to Italy. Its first rector was Johannes Nauclerus.\n\n\nIts present name was conferred on it in 1769 by Duke Karl Eugen who appended his first name to that of the founder. The university later became the principal university of the kingdom of Württemberg. Today, it is one of nine state universities funded by the German federal state of Baden-Württemberg.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe University of Tübingen has a history of innovative thought, particularly in theology, in which the university and the Tübinger Stift are famous to this day. Philipp Melanchthon (1497–1560), the prime mover in building the German school system and a chief figure in the Protestant Reformation, helped establish its direction. Among Tübingen's eminent students (and/or professors) have been the astronomer Johannes Kepler; the economist Horst Köhler (President of Germany); Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI), poet Friedrich Hölderlin, and the philosophers Friedrich Schelling and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. \"The Tübingen Three\" refers to Hölderlin, Hegel and Schelling, who were roommates at the Tübinger Stift. Theologian Helmut Thielicke revived postwar Tübingen when he took over a professorship at the reopened theological faculty in 1947, being made administrative head of the university and President of the Chancellor's Conference in 1951. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:University of Tübingen alumni\n\n* ![Horst Köhler, President of Germany (2004–2010) and Head of the International Monetary Fund (2000–2004)](image)\n\nHorst Köhler, President of Germany (2004–2010) and Head of the International Monetary Fund (2000–2004)\n* ![Roman Herzog, President of Germany (1994–1999) and judge of the Federal Constitutional Court (1983–1994)](image)\n\nRoman Herzog, President of Germany (1994–1999) and judge of the Federal Constitutional Court (1983–1994)\n* ![Günther Oettinger, European Commissioner (2010–2019)](image)\n\nGünther Oettinger, European Commissioner (2010–2019)\n* ![Jürgen Stark, Chief Economist and Member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank (2006–2012)](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen – Organe der Universität: Senat Archived 7 June 2007 at the Wayback Machine.

The University of Tübingen is also host to a number of Collaborative Research Centres, producing fundamental interdisciplinary research.\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Institute of Political Science\nThe University of Tübingen is not a campus university, but is spread throughout the town: Tübingen is one of five classical \"university towns\" in Germany.

Among the more prominent ones in the natural sciences are the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, which focuses on general, cognitive and cellular neurology as well as neurodegeneration, and the Centre for Interdisciplinary Clinical Research, which deals primarily with cell biology in diagnostics and therapy of organ system diseases. In the liberal arts, the University of Tübingen is noteworthy for having the only faculty of rhetoric in Germany – the department was founded by Walter Jens, an important intellectual and literary critic.

As a result there is a slump of activity during university holidays, particularly over the summer when a large number of otherwise regular events are not happening.\n\n\nAround 30 *Studentenverbindungen*, the German type of fraternities, are associated with the university. While famous for their parties, public academic lectures and the yearly \"Stocherkahn-Rennen\" punting-boat race on the Neckar river, some of them are the subject of ongoing controversy surrounding alleged rightwing policial views, leading to strong criticism from leftist groups.[29] The university itself takes a neutral stance on this issue.

However, some persons serve in more than one body.\n\n\nThe **Rectorate** is the executive component of the university's governing body. The current rector, Professor Karla Pollmann, is supported by four deputies consisting of three prorectors and one provost. All are also permanent members of the university senate.[12][13]\n\n\nThe **Senate** forms the legislative section of governance. Apart from the members of the rectorate, it includes the equal opportunities commissioner, the deans and 20 elected members representing the professors, lecturers, students and non-academic staff. Two advisors represent the university's teaching hospitals.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPhilosopher and theologian Ernst Bloch is another prominent figure associated with Tübingen's postwar revival.\n\n\nThe university rose to the height of its prominence in the middle of the 19th century with the teachings of poet and civic leader Ludwig Uhland and the Protestant theologian Ferdinand Christian Baur, whose circle, colleagues and students became known as the \"Tübingen School\", which pioneered the historical-critical analysis of biblical and early Christian texts, an approach generally referred to as \"higher criticism\". The University of Tübingen also was the first German university to establish a faculty of natural sciences, in 1863. DNA was discovered in 1868 at the University of Tübingen by Friedrich Miescher. Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard, the first female Nobel Prize winner in medicine in Germany, also works at Tübingen. The faculty for economics and business was founded in 1817 as the \"Staatswissenschaftliche Fakultät\" and was the first of its kind in Germany.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The university's teaching hospitals are located between the Wilhelmstraße area and the Morgenstelle campus in an area collectively known as the *Klinikum*. The 17 hospitals in Tübingen affiliated with the university's faculty of medicine have 1,500 patient beds, and cater to 66,000 in-patients and 200,000 out-patients on an annual basis.[9]\n\n\nAccommodation provided by the Tübingen Studentenwerk is in several locations throughout the town. The largest of the eleven halls of residence are in the city's northern neighbourhood of *Waldhäuser Ost* (1,700 rooms) and in the city's southeasternmost neighbourhood, *Französisches Viertel* (500 rooms).[10]\n\n\n\n## Museum[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The field of religious studies in Tübingen has also been the educational center for the philosophers Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, Friedrich Hölderlin und Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.
