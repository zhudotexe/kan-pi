It is bordered by France's Alpes-Maritimes department on three sides, with one side bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Its centre is about 16 km (9.9 mi) from Italy and only 13 km (8.1 mi) northeast of Nice.[49]\n\n\nIt has an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), or 208 ha (510 acres), and a population of 38,400,[80] making Monaco the second-smallest and the most densely populated country in the world.[49] The country has a land border of only 5.47 km (3.40 mi),[80] a coastline of 3.83 km (2.38 mi), a maritime claim that extends 22.2 km (13.8 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft).[81][82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith an area of 2.02 km2 (0.78 sq mi), it is the second-smallest sovereign state in the world, after Vatican City. Its 19,009 inhabitants /km2 (49,230/sq mi) make it the most densely-populated sovereign state in the world. Monaco has a land border of 5.47 km (3.40 mi) and the world's shortest coastline of approximately 3.83 km (2.38 mi);[15] it has a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft). The highest point in the state is a narrow pathway named Chemin des Révoires on the slopes of Mont Agel, in the Les Révoires ward, which is 161 m (528 ft) above sea level. The principality is about 15 km (9.3 mi) from the border with Italy.[16] Since 2013, it consists of nine administrative wards, the largest of which is Monte Carlo (Monte Carlo/Spélugues, 0.44 km2 (0.17 sq mi)), and the most populous of which is Larvotto (Larvotto/Bas Moulins, 5,443 residents as of 2008). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)In the centre is La Condamine.

There is no geographical distinction between the State and City of Monaco, although responsibilities of the government (state-level) and of the municipality (city-level) are different.[65] According to the constitution of 1911, the principality was subdivided into three municipalities:[96]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter a recent[*when?*] expansion of Port Hercules,[87] Monaco's total area grew to 2.08 km2 (0.80 sq mi) or 208 ha (510 acres);[86] subsequently, new plans have been approved to extend the district of Fontvieille by 0.08 km2 (0.031 sq mi) or 8 ha (20 acres), with land reclaimed from the Mediterranean Sea. Land reclamation projects include extending the district of Fontvieille.[88][89][90][87][91] There are two ports in Monaco, Port Hercules and Port Fontvieille.[92] There is a neighbouring French port called Cap d'Ail that is near Monaco.[92] Monaco's only natural resource is fishing;[93] with almost the entire country being an urban area, Monaco lacks any sort of commercial agriculture industry.\n\n\n\n![](image)Panoramic view of La Condamine and Monte Carlo\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Monaco\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Average sea temperature °C (°F)\n | 13.4(56.2)\n | 13.0(55.5)\n | 13.4(56.1)\n | 14.6(58.4)\n | 18.0(64.3)\n | 21.8(71.3)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 23.6(74.4)\n | 22.2(71.9)\n | 19.6(67.2)\n | 17.4(63.3)\n | 14.9(58.9)\n | 17.9(64.3)\n |\n| Source: Weather Atlas[116] |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAdministrative divisions of Monaco\n |\n| --- |\n| Traditional *Quartiers* 1 | * Monaco-Ville\n* La Condamine\n* Monte Carlo\n* Fontvieille\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Reserved Sectors | * Monaco-Ville\n* Ravin de Sainte-Dévote\n |\n| Wards | * La Condamine\n* Fontvieille\n* Jardin Exotique\n* Larvotto\n* Les Moneghetti\n* Monte Carlo\n* La Rousse\n* *Le Portier* 2\n |\n| * 1 ordered by age of foundation\n* 2 Planned for 2025\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Recensement de la Population 2016\" (PDF) (in French).

Monaco has the world's highest life expectancy at nearly 90 years.[157][158]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Monaco\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe highest point in the country is at the access to the *Patio Palace* residential building on the Chemin des Révoires (ward Les Révoires) from the D6007 (*Moyenne Corniche* street) at 164.4 m (539 ft) above sea level.[83] The lowest point in the country is the Mediterranean Sea.[84]\n\n\nSaint-Jean brook is the longest flowing body of water, around 0.19 km (190 m; 0.12 mi; 620 ft) in length, and Fontvieille is the largest lake, approximately 0.5 ha (5,000 m2; 0 acres; 54,000 sq ft) in area.[85] Monaco's most populated *quartier* is Monte Carlo, and the most populated ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins.[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Fontvieille and its new harbour\nMonaco has the world's highest GDP nominal per capita at US$185,742, GDP PPP per capita at $132,571 and GNI per capita at $183,150.[117][118][119] It also has an unemployment rate of 2%,[120] with over 48,000 workers who commute from France and Italy each day.[86] According to the CIA World Factbook, Monaco has the world's lowest poverty rate[121] and the highest number of millionaires and billionaires per capita in the world.[122] For the fourth year in a row, Monaco in 2012 had the world's most expensive real estate market, at $58,300 per square metre.[123][124][125] Although the average price went down in 2020, to an average price of $53,378 per square metre, Monaco remains one of the most expensive places in the world to buy property.[126]\nThe world's most expensive apartment is located in Monaco, a penthouse at the Odeon Tower valued at $335 million according to *Forbes* in 2016.[127]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe four traditional *quartiers* of Monaco are Monaco-Ville, La Condamine, Monte Carlo and Fontvieille.[102] The suburb of Moneghetti, the high-level part of La Condamine, is generally seen today as an effective fifth *Quartier* of Monaco, having a very distinct atmosphere and topography when compared with low-level La Condamine.[103]\n\n\n\n#### Wards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wards of Monaco\nFor town planning purposes, a sovereign ordinance in 1966 divided the principality into reserved sectors, \"whose current character must be preserved\", and wards. The number and boundaries of these sectors and wards have been modified several times. The latest division dates from 2013 and created two reserved sectors and seven wards. A new 6-hectare district, Le Portier, is currently being built on the sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Embassy of Monaco, Paris, France\nFrance and Italy have embassies within Monaco, while most other nations represented via operations in Paris.[212][213] There are about another 30 or so consulates.[212] By the 21st century Monaco maintained embassies in Belgium (Brussels), France (Paris), Germany (Berlin), the Vatican, Italy (Rome), Portugal (Lisbon),[214] Spain (Madrid), Switzerland (Bern), United Kingdom (London) and the United States (Washington).[212]\n\n\nAs of 2000[update] nearly two-thirds of the residents of Monaco were foreigners.[215] In 2015 the immigrant population was estimated at 60%[211] It is reported to be difficult to gain citizenship in Monaco, or at least in relative number there are not many people who do so. In 2015 an immigration rate of about 4 people per 1,000 was noted, or about 100–150 people a year.[216] The population of Monaco went from 35,000 in 2008 to 36,000 in 2013, and of that about 20 per cent were native Monegasque[217] (see also Nationality law of Monaco).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMonaco made a special agreement with France in 1963 in which French customs laws apply in Monaco and its territorial waters.[141] Monaco uses the euro but is not a member of the European Union.[141] Monaco shares a 6 km (3.7 mi) border with France but also has about 2 km (1.2 mi) of coastline with the Mediterranean sea.[211] Two important agreements that support Monaco's independence from France include the Franco-Monégasque Treaty of 1861 and the French Treaty of 1918 (see also Kingdom of Sardinia).

It is Europe's fourth-smallest country, with an area of just over 160 square kilometres (62 square miles) and a population of 38,749 (as of 2019[update]).[15] Divided into 11 municipalities, its capital is Vaduz, and its largest municipality is Schaan. It is also the smallest country to border two countries.[16]\n\n\nEconomically, Liechtenstein has one of the highest gross domestic products per person in the world when adjusted for purchasing power parity.[17] The country has a strong financial sector centred in Vaduz. It was once known as a billionaire tax haven, but is no longer on any official blacklists of uncooperative tax haven countries. An Alpine country, Liechtenstein is mountainous, making it a winter sport destination.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Basic Data Selection, (Select all countries, \"GDP, Per Capita GDP - US Dollars\", and 2020 to generate table), United Nations Statistics Division.

Liechtenstein is the sixth-smallest independent nation in the world by area.\n\n\nThe principality of Liechtenstein is divided into 11 communes called *Gemeinden* (singular *Gemeinde*). The *Gemeinden* mostly consist of only a single town or village. Five of them (Eschen, Gamprin, Mauren, Ruggell, and Schellenberg) fall within the electoral district *Unterland* (the lower county), and the remainder (Balzers, Planken, Schaan, Triesen, Triesenberg, and Vaduz) within *Oberland* (the upper county).\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nDespite its alpine location, the prevailing southerly winds temper Liechtenstein's climate. Its climate is continental, with cloudy and cold winters, with frequent rain and snowfall. Summers are cool to slightly warm, cloudy, and humid.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Rhine: border between Liechtenstein and Switzerland (view towards the Swiss Alps)\nLiechtenstein is situated in the Upper Rhine valley of the European Alps and is bordered to the east by the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, to the south by the canton of Grisons (Switzerland) and to the west by the canton of St. Gallen (Switzerland). The Rhine forms the entire western border of Liechtenstein. Measured south to north the country is about 24 km (15 mi) long. Its highest point, Grauspitz, is 2,599 m (8,527 ft). Despite its Alpine location, prevailing southerly winds make the climate comparatively mild. In winter, the mountain slopes are well suited to winter sports.\n\n\nNew surveys using more accurate measurements of the country's borders in 2006 have set its area at 160 km2 (62 sq mi), with borders of 77.9 km (48.4 mi).[63] Liechtenstein's borders are 1.9 km (1.2 mi) longer than previously thought.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Bevölkerungsstatistik 2017 Llv.li, p. 7\n2. **^** \"Central Intelligence Agency\". *The World Factbook*.

Swiss Standard German is also understood and spoken by most Liechtensteiners.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Liechtenstein\n\n![](image)St. Florin Catholic Cathedral in Vaduz\nAccording to the Constitution of Liechtenstein, Catholicism is its official state religion:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAbout half of Liechtenstein's territory is mountainous.[68] Liechtenstein lies entirely in the Rhaetikon and is thus – depending on the classification of the Alps – assigned either to the Eastern Alps (two-part division of the Alps) or to the Central Alps (three-part division of the Alps).\n\n\nThe highest point of Liechtenstein is the Vordere Grauspitz (Vordergrauspitz) with an altitude of 2,599 m (8,527 ft) above sea level, while the lowest point is the Ruggeller Riet with an altitude of 430 metres (1,410 ft) above sea level.\n\n\nIn total, there are 32 mountains in Liechtenstein with an altitude of at least 2,000 metres (6,600 ft). The Falknishorn, at 2,452 metres (8,045 ft) above sea level, is the fifth highest mountain in Liechtenstein and represents the southernmost point of the country.

The country imports about 85% of its energy. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Union) since May 1995.\n\n\nThe government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. In 2008, the unemployment rate was 1.5%. Liechtenstein has only one hospital, the Liechtensteinisches Landesspital in Vaduz. As of 2014 the CIA World Factbook estimated the gross domestic product (GDP) on a purchasing power parity basis to be $4.978 billion. As of 2009 the estimate per capita was $139,100, the highest listed for the world.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Rhine is the longest and largest body of water in Liechtenstein. With a length of approximately 27 kilometres (17 mi), it represents the natural border with Switzerland and is of great importance for Liechtenstein's water supply. Furthermore, the Rhine is an important recreational area for the population. At 10 kilometres (6 mi), the Samina is the second longest river in the Principality. The troubled river begins at Triesenberg and flows into the Ill in Austria (near Feldkirch).\n\n\nThe only naturally formed lake in Liechtenstein is the Gampriner Seelein, which was not formed until 1927 by a flooding of the Rhine with enormous erosion. In addition, there are other artificially created lakes, which are mainly used to generate electricity. One of them is the Steg Reservoir, the largest lake in Liechtenstein.\n\n\n\n### Mountains[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Balzers Heliport\nThere are about 250 kilometres (155 mi) of paved roadway within Liechtenstein, with 90 km (56 mi) of marked bicycle paths.\n\n\nA 9.5 km (6 mi) railway connects Austria and Switzerland through Liechtenstein. The country's railways are administered by the Austrian Federal Railways as part of the route between Feldkirch, Austria, and Buchs, Switzerland. Liechtenstein is nominally within the Austrian Verkehrsverbund Vorarlberg tariff region.[93]\n\n\nThere are four railway stations in Liechtenstein, namely Schaan-Vaduz, Forst Hilti, Nendeln and Schaanwald, served by an irregularly stopping train service between Feldkirch and Buchs provided by Austrian Federal Railways.[94][95]\n\n\n\nSee also: Rail transport in Liechtenstein\n\nLiechtenstein Bus is a subsidiary of the Swiss Postbus system, but separately run, and connects to the Swiss bus network at Buchs and at Sargans.[96] Holders of a *Swiss Travel Pass* can travel for free on Liechtenstein’s buses.[97]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMicrostate in the Alps\n\nFor other uses, see Lichtenstein (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Principality of Liechtenstein\n*Fürstentum Liechtenstein* (German)\n |\n| --- |\n| ![Flag of Liechtenstein](image)\n\nFlag\n\n![Coat of arms of Liechtenstein](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConflicts over the handling of banking and tax data have repeatedly strained relations with Germany. On 2 September 2009, Liechtenstein and Germany signed an agreement on cooperation and the exchange of information in tax matters. The text of the agreement followed the OECD model agreement and provides for an exchange of information on tax matters upon request as of the 2010 tax year. In addition, Liechtenstein regards Germany as an important partner in safeguarding its interests in European integration. At the cultural level, project sponsorship plays a particularly important role. For example, the Hilti Foundation financed the exhibition \"Egypt's Sunken Treasures\" in Berlin, and the state donated 20,000 euros following the fire at the Duchess Anna Amalia Library in Weimar.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Liechtenstein\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)University of Liechtenstein\nThe literacy rate of Liechtenstein is 100%.[65] In 2006 Programme for International Student Assessment report, coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ranked Liechtenstein's education as the 10th-best in the world.[90] In 2012, Liechtenstein had the highest PISA scores of any European country.[91]\n\n\nWithin Liechtenstein, there are four main centres for higher education:\n\n\n\n* University of Liechtenstein\n* Private University in the Principality of Liechtenstein\n* Liechtenstein Institute\n* International Academy of Philosophy, Liechtenstein\n\n\nThere are nine public high schools in the country.

The diplomatic conflict revolving around the controversial postwar Beneš decrees resulted in Liechtenstein not having international relations with the Czech Republic or Slovakia. Diplomatic relations were established between Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic on 13 July 2009,[36][37][38] and with Slovakia on 9 December 2009.[39]\n\n\nOn 20 September 1990, Liechtenstein was admitted into the United Nations as 160th member state.

This placed Liechtenstein second in the world after Germany. Also in 2014, the SolarSuperState Association awarded the second place SolarSuperState Prize in the Solar category to Liechtenstein.[53] In the years 2015 and 2016, Liechtenstein was honoured with the first place SolarSuperState Prize in the Solar category because it had the world's biggest cumulative installed photovoltaic power output per capita.[54][55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Maltese consulate in Schaan\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Liechtenstein\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_LtwQxoSCE5kThU5Svx9qh7OI","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The Grand Duchy borders Belgium's Wallonia, in particular the Belgian provinces of Luxembourg and Liège, part of which comprises the German-speaking Community of Belgium, to the west and to the north, respectively.\n\n\nThe northern third of the country is known as the Oesling, and forms part of the Ardennes. It is dominated by hills and low mountains, including the Kneiff near Wilwerdange,[108] which is the highest point, at 560 meters (1,840 ft). Other mountains are the Buurgplaatz at 559 meters (1,834 ft) near Huldange and the Napoléonsgaard at 554 meters (1,818 ft) near Rambrouch. The region is sparsely populated, with only one town (Wiltz) with a population of more than five thousand people.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe southern two-thirds of the country is called the Gutland, and is more densely populated than the Oesling. It is also more diverse and can be divided into five geographic sub-regions. The Luxembourg plateau, in south-central Luxembourg, is a large, flat, sandstone formation, and the site of the city of Luxembourg. Little Switzerland, in the east of Luxembourg, has craggy terrain and thick forests. The Moselle valley is the lowest-lying region, running along the southeastern border. The Red Lands, in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg's industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg's largest towns.\n\n\nThe border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three rivers: the Moselle, the Sauer, and the Our. Other major rivers are the Alzette, the Attert, the Clerve, and the Wiltz. The valleys of the mid-Sauer and Attert form the border between the Gutland and the Oesling.\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| • Prime Minister\n | Luc Frieden |\n| • Deputy Prime Minister\n | Xavier Bettel |\n|  |\n| Legislature | Chamber of Deputies |\n| Independence |\n|  |\n| • From the French Empire and elevation to Grand Duchy of Luxembourg\n | 15 March 1815 |\n| • Independence in personal Union with the Netherlands (Treaty of London)\n | 19 April 1839 |\n| • Reaffirmation of Independence Treaty of London\n | 11 May 1867 |\n| • End of personal union with the Kingdom of the Netherlands\n | 23 November 1890 |\n| • Occupation during World War I by the German Empire\n | 1 August 1914 |\n| • Liberation from the Greater German Reich\n | 1944/1945 |\n| • Admitted to the United Nations\n | 24 October 1945 |\n| • Founded the EEC[a]\n | 1 January 1958 |\n|  |\n| Area  |\n| • Total\n | 2,586.4 km2 (998.6 sq mi) (168th) |\n| • Water (%)\n | 0.23 (2015)[3] |\n| Population |\n| • January 2023 estimate\n | ![Neutral increase](image) 660,809[4] (163rd) |\n| • 2021 census\n | 643,941 [5] |\n| • Density\n | 255/km2 (660.4/sq mi) (58th) |\n| GDP (PPP) | 2023 estimate |\n| • Total\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n93. **^** \"ISAF (International Security and Assistance Force)\". 24 April 2023.\n94. **^** solutions, EIU digital. \"Democracy Index 2016 - The Economist Intelligence Unit\". *www.eiu.com*.

The nation's levels of human development and LGBT equality are ranked among the highest in Europe.[19][8] The city of Luxembourg was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994 due to the exceptional preservation of its vast fortifications and historic quarters.[20] Luxembourg is a founding member of the European Union,[21] OECD, the United Nations, NATO, and the Benelux.[22][23] It served on the United Nations Security Council for the first time in 2013 and 2014.[24]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Luxembourg is part of the Schengen Area, the EU single market, and the eurozone (dark blue).\nLuxembourg's stable and high-income market economy features moderate growth, low inflation, and a high level of innovation.[115] Unemployment is traditionally low, though it reached 6.1% by May 2012, due largely to the 2008 global financial crisis.[116] In 2011, according to the IMF, Luxembourg was the world's second-richest country, with a per capita GDP on a purchasing-power parity (PPP) basis of $80,119.[117] Its GDP per capita in purchasing power standards was 261% of the EU average (100%) in 2019.[118] Luxembourg ranks 13th in The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom,[119] 26th in the United Nations Human Development Index, and 4th in the Economist Intelligence Unit's quality of life index.[120] It ranked 21st in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[121]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Grand Ducal Palace in Luxembourg City, the official residence of the grand duke of Luxembourg\nLegislative power is vested in the Chamber of Deputies, a unicameral legislature of sixty members, who are directly elected to five-year terms from four constituencies. A second body, the Council of State (*Conseil d'État*), composed of 21 ordinary citizens appointed by the grand duke, advises the Chamber of Deputies in the drafting of legislation.[98]\n\n\nLuxembourg has three lower tribunals (*justices de paix*; in Esch-sur-Alzette, the city of Luxembourg, and Diekirch), two district tribunals (Luxembourg and Diekirch), and a Superior Court of Justice (Luxembourg), which includes the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation.

The newspaper with the largest circulation is the German-language daily *Luxemburger Wort*.[218] Because of the strong multilingualism in Luxembourg, newspapers often alternate articles in French and articles in German, without translation. In addition, there are both English and Portuguese radio and national print publications, but accurate audience figures are difficult to gauge since the national media survey by ILRES is conducted in French.[219]\n\n\nLuxembourg is known in Europe for its radio and television stations (Radio Luxembourg and RTL Group). It is also the uplink home of SES, carrier of major European satellite services for Germany and Britain.[220]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a result of the recurring disputes between the major European powers, the people of Luxembourg gradually developed a consciousness of independence and a national awakening took place in the 19th century.[78] The people of Luxembourg began referring to themselves as *Luxembourgers*, rather than being part of one of the larger surrounding nations. This consciousness of *Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinn* (“*We want to remain what we are ”)* culminated in 1890, when the last step towards full independence was finally taken: due to a succession crisis the Dutch monarchy ceased to hold the title Grand-Duke of Luxembourg. Beginning with Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg, the Grand-Duchy would have their own monarchy, thus reaffirming its full independence.[79]\n\n\n\n### Two German occupations and interwar political crisis (1890–1945)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Frontier with Alsace-Lorraine from 1871 to 1918\nSee also: German occupation of Luxembourg during World War I and German occupation of Luxembourg during World War II\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith 2.45% of its prewar population killed, and a third of all buildings in Luxembourg being destroyed or heavily damaged (mainly due to the Battle of the Bulge), Luxembourg suffered the highest such loss in Western Europe and its commitment to the Allied war effort was never questioned.[90] Around 1,000-2,500 of Luxembourg's Jews were murdered in the Holocaust.\n\n\n\n### Integration into NATO and European Union (1945–)[edit]\n\n\nThe Grand Duchy became a founding member of the United Nations in 1945. Luxembourg's neutral status under the constitution formally ended in 1948, and in April 1949 it also became a founding member of NATO.[91] During the Cold War, Luxembourg continued its involvements on the side of the Western Bloc. In the early fifties a small contingent of troops fought in the Korean War.[92]\nLuxembourg troops have also deployed to Afghanistan, to support ISAF.[93]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_fjHBM0fmNtARQyQIqiCQptmg","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

It has a land area of 54 square kilometres (21 sq mi). Bermuda has a sub-tropical climate, with mild winters and warm summers. Its climate also exhibits oceanic features similar to other coastal areas in the Northern Hemisphere with warm, moist air from the ocean ensuring relatively high humidity and stabilising temperatures. Bermuda lies in Hurricane Alley and thus is prone to severe weather; however, it receives some protection from a coral reef and its position at the north of the belt, which limits the direction and severity of approaching storms.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe territory consists of 181 islands, with a total area of 53.3 km2 (20.6 sq mi).[45] The largest island is Main Island (also called *Bermuda*). Eight larger and populated islands are connected by bridges.[45] The territory's tallest peak is Town Hill on Main Island at 79 metres tall (260′).[1][46] The territory's coastline is 103 km (64 mi).[1]\n\n\nBermuda gives its name to the Bermuda Triangle, a region of sea in which, according to legend, a number of aircraft and boats have disappeared under unexplained or mysterious circumstances.[47]\n\n\n\n### Main sights[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** Rushe, George. \"Bermuda Islands\". *Britannica Online*.

The law requires that each household collect rainwater that is piped down from the roof of each house. Average monthly rainfall is highest in October, at over 6 in (150 mm), and lowest in April and May.\n\n\nAccess to biocapacity in Bermuda is much lower than world average. In 2016, Bermuda had 0.14 global hectares[58] of biocapacity per person within its territory, far lower than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person.[59] In 2016 Bermuda used 7.5 global hectares of biocapacity per person — their ecological footprint of consumption. This means they use much more biocapacity than Bermuda contains.

The House of Assembly dates from 1620, making it one of the world's oldest legislatures. The premier is the head of government and is formally appointed by the governor, who is nominated by the British government as the representative of the King. The United Kingdom is responsible for foreign affairs and defence. An independence referendum was held in 1995 with a large majority voting against independence. As of 2019, Bermuda had a population of around 64,000 people, making it the second-most populous of the British Overseas Territories. Black Bermudians, primarily descended from African slaves, make up around 50% of the population, while White Bermudians, primarily of British, Irish and Portuguese descent, make up 30% of the population. There are smaller groups from other races or identifying as mixed race and about 30% of the population is not Bermudian by birth. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBermuda consists of over 150 limestone islands, but especially five main islands, along the southern margin of the Bermuda Platform, one of three topographic highs found on the Bermuda Pedestal. This Bermuda Pedestal sits atop the Bermuda Rise, a mid-basin swell surrounded by abyssal plains. The Bermuda Pedestal is one of four topographic highs aligned roughly from North-East to South-West. The others, all submerged, being *Bowditch Seamount* to the North-East, and *Challenger Bank* and *Argus Bank* to the South-West.[52] Initial uplift of this rise occurred in the Middle to Late Eocene and concluded by the Late Oligocene, when it subsided below sea level. The volcanic rocks associated with this rise are tholeiitic lavas and intrusive lamprophyre sheets, which form a volcanic basement, on average, 50 m (160 ft) below the island carbonate surface.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)One of Bermuda's pink-sand beaches at Astwood Park\n![](image)View of Harrington Sound from behind Bermuda Aquarium, Museum, and Zoo\nTourism is Bermuda's second-largest industry, with the island attracting over half a million visitors annually, of whom more than 80% are from the United States.[1] Other significant sources of visitors are from Canada and the United Kingdom. However, the sector is vulnerable to external shocks, such as the 2008 recession.[1]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nThe affordability of housing became a prominent issue during Bermuda's business peak in 2005 but has softened with the decline of Bermuda's real estate prices. The World Factbook lists the average cost of a house in June 2003 as $976,000,[171] while real estate agencies have claimed that this figure had risen to between $1.6 million[172] and $1.845 million by 2007,[173] though such high figures have been disputed.[174]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of schools in Bermuda\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** ***x*** ***y*** ***z*** ***aa*** \n\"Bermuda\". *CIA World Factbook*.

For many years, Bermuda's bases were used by US Air Force transport and refuelling aircraft and by US Navy aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, first German and, later, Soviet. The principal installation, Kindley Air Force Base on the eastern coast, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 and redesignated Naval Air Station Bermuda. As a naval air station, the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, as well as transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and Canadian Forces aircraft.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 2021, the government implemented a new visa policy towards foreigners, through which residency can be obtained by way of investing at least $2.5 million in \"real estate, Bermuda government bonds, a contribution to the island's debt relief fund or the Bermuda Trust Fund, and charity\", among other options. According to the Labour Minister, Jason Hayward, this step had to be taken to relieve some of the country's debt resulting from the Covid pandemic.[115]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of Bermuda\n\n![](image)Parishes of Bermuda\nBermuda is divided into nine parishes and two incorporated municipalities.[1]\n\n\nBermuda's nine parishes are:\n\n\n\n* Devonshire\n* Hamilton\n* Paget\n* Pembroke\n* Sandys\n* Smith's\n* Southampton\n* St George's\n* Warwick\n\n\nBermuda's two incorporated municipalities are:\n\n\n\n* Hamilton (city)\n* St George's (town)\n\n\nBermuda's two informal villages are:\n\n\n\n* Flatts Village\n* Somerset Village\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Bermuda rock lizard (or *Bermuda rock skink*) was long thought to have been the only indigenous land vertebrate of Bermuda, discounting the marine turtles that lay their eggs on its beaches. However, scientists have recently discovered through genetic DNA studies that a species of turtle, the diamondback terrapin, previously thought to have been introduced to the archipelago, actually pre-dated the arrival of humans.[67]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Bermuda\n\n![](image)Young Bermudian man in the 19th century\n| Racial groups in Bermuda (2016 Census)[2] |\n| --- |\n| Ethnic groups |  | percent |\n| Black |  | 52% |\n| White |  | 31% |\n| Mixed |  | 9% |\n| Asian |  | 4% |\n| Other |  | 4% |\n\nBermuda's 2016 Census put its population at 63,779 and, with an area of 53.2 km2 (20.5 sq mi), it has a calculated population density of 1,201 people/km2 (3,111/mi2).[2] As of July 2018, the population is estimated to be 71,176.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe racial makeup of Bermuda was 52% Black, 31% White, 9% multiracial, 4% Asian, and 4% other races, these numbers being based on self-identification recorded by the 2016 census. The majority of those who answered \"Black\" may have any mixture of black, white or other ancestry. Native-born Bermudians made up 70% of the population, compared to 30% non-natives.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBermuda is named after Spanish explorer Juan de Bermúdez, who discovered the archipelago in 1505. The islands have been permanently inhabited since 1612 when an English settlement was established at St. George's. Forming part of British America, Bermuda was governed under royal charter by the Somers Isles Company until 1684, when it became a crown colony. The first African slaves were taken to Bermuda in 1616. A full plantation economy did not develop and the slave trade largely ceased by the end of the 17th century (citation needed). The economy instead became maritime-focused, with the colony serving as a base for merchants, privateers and the Royal Navy, giving its name to the Bermuda rig and Bermuda sloop. It became an imperial fortress, the most important British naval and military base in the western hemisphere with vast funds lavished on its Royal Naval Dockyard and military defences. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Geography | \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Bermuda Triangle\n* Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS)\n* Islands\n* National Trust\n* Sargasso Sea\n* Spittal Pond\n |\n| Environment | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Flora | * Bermuda onion (cultivated)\n* *Casuarina* (invasive)\n* *Cassine laneana*\n* *Juniperus bermudiana*\n* *Lilium longiflorum* (cultivated)\n* *Sabal bermudana*\n* *Sisyrinchium bermudiana*\n |\n| Fauna | * Bermuda land snail\n* Bermuda petrel\n* Bermuda rock skink\n* Common ground dove\n* Eastern bluebird\n* Gray catbird\n* Great kiskadee\n* Humpback whale\n* Mourning dove\n* Northern cardinal\n* White-eyed vireo\n* White-tailed tropicbird\n* Yellow-crowned night heron\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Schools | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| State | * Berkeley Institute\n* Cedarbridge Academy\n |\n| Independent | * Bermuda HS\n* Bermuda Institute\n* Saltus Grammar School\n* Warwick Academy\n |\n| Tertiary | * Bermuda College\n |\n\n |\n| Politics | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n164. **^** \"US Commercial Service: Doing Business in Bermuda\" (PDF).

Today, many types of palm trees, fruit trees, and bananas grow on Bermuda, though the cultivated coconut palms are considered non-native and may be removed.[*clarification needed*] The country contains the Bermuda subtropical conifer forests terrestrial ecoregion.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJones Village in Warwick, Cashew City (St. George's), Claytown (Hamilton), Middle Town (Pembroke), and Tucker's Town (St. George's) are neighbourhoods (the original settlement at Tucker's Town was replaced with a golf course in the 1920s and the few houses in the area today are mostly on the water's edge of Castle Harbour or the adjacent peninsula); Dandy Town and North Village are sports clubs, and Harbour View Village is a small public housing development.\n\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\nAs a British Overseas Territory, Bermuda does not have a seat in the United Nations; it is represented by Britain in matters of foreign affairs.[1] To promote its economic interests abroad, Bermuda maintains representative offices in London[116] and Washington, D.C.[117] Only the United States and Portugal have full-time diplomatic representation in Bermuda (the U.S. maintains a Consulate-General, and Portugal maintains a Consulate), while 17 countries maintain honorary consuls in Bermuda.[118]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are also several thousand expatriate workers, principally from the United Kingdom, Canada, the West Indies, South Africa, and the United States, who reside in Bermuda. They are primarily engaged in specialised professions such as accounting, finance, and insurance. Others are employed in various trades, such as hotels, restaurants, construction, and landscaping services. Despite the high cost of living, the high salaries offer expatriates several benefits by moving to Bermuda and working for a period of time.[71] Of the total workforce of 38,947 people in 2005, government employment figures stated that 11,223 (29%) were non-Bermudians.[72]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nThe predominant language in Bermuda is Bermudian English.[1]\n\n\nBritish English spellings and conventions are used in print media and formal written communications.[73] Portuguese is also spoken by migrants from the Azores, Madeira, and the Cape Verde Islands and their descendants.[1][74]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A proportional representation of Bermuda exports, 2019\n![](image)Front Street, Hamilton\n![](image)Bermuda electricity production by source\nBanking and other financial services now form the largest sector of the economy at about 85% of GDP, with tourism being the second largest industry at 5%.[1][17] Industrial and agriculture activities occur; however, these are on a very limited scale and Bermuda is heavily reliant on imports.[1] Living standards are high and as of 2019 Bermuda has the 6th-highest GDP per capita in the world.[1]\n\n\n\n### 1890s to 1920s: economy severely affected by lily virus[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBritish Overseas Territory in the North Atlantic Ocean\n\nThis article is about the British Overseas Territory.

It is separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea and the North Channel, which has a width of 23 kilometres (14 mi)[111] at its narrowest point. To the west is the northern Atlantic Ocean and to the south is the Celtic Sea, which lies between Ireland and Brittany, in France. Ireland has a total area of 84,421 km2 (32,595 sq mi),[1][2][112] of which the Republic of Ireland occupies 83 percent.[113] Ireland and Great Britain, together with many nearby smaller islands, are known collectively as the British Isles. As the term *British Isles* can be controversial in relation to Ireland, the alternate term *Britain and Ireland* is sometimes used as a neutral term for the islands.[114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIreland's largest religious group is Christianity. The largest denomination is Roman Catholicism, representing over 73% of the island (and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland). Most of the rest of the population adhere to one of the various Protestant denominations (about 48% of Northern Ireland).[144] The largest is the Anglican Church of Ireland. The Muslim community is growing in Ireland, mostly through increased immigration, with a 50% increase in the republic between the 2006 and 2011 census.[145] The island has a small Jewish community. About 4% of the Republic's population and about 14% of the Northern Ireland population[144] describe themselves as of no religion. In a 2010 survey conducted on behalf of the Irish Times, 32% of respondents said they went to a religious service more than once per week.\n\n\n\n### Divisions and settlements[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Provinces of Ireland, Counties of Ireland, and City status in Ireland\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGeopolitically, the island of Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), an independent state covering five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.

Today, woodland makes up about 10% of the island, compared with a European average of over 33%,[12] with most of it being non-native conifer plantations.[13][14] The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate,[15] and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area, although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe. Rainfall and cloud cover are abundant.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** The 2022 population of the Republic of Ireland was 5,123,536 and that of Northern Ireland in 2021 was 1,903,100.

Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.[143]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Irish people, Demographics of the Republic of Ireland, and Demography of Northern Ireland\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA ring of coastal mountains surrounds low plains at the centre of the island. The highest of these is Carrauntoohil (Irish: *Corrán Tuathail*) in County Kerry, which rises to 1,039 m (3,409 ft) above sea level.[115] The most arable land lies in the province of Leinster.[116] Western areas are mainly mountainous and rocky with green panoramic vistas. River Shannon, the island's longest river at 360.5 km (224 mi) long, rises in County Cavan in the north-west and flows through Limerick in the midwest.[115][117]\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of Ireland\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCounties in Northern Ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes,[147] but, as in the Republic, their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts.[148]\n\n\nCity status in Ireland is decided by legislative or royal charter. Dublin, with over one million residents in the Greater Dublin Area, is the largest city on the island. Belfast, with 579,726 residents, is the largest city in Northern Ireland. City status does not directly equate with population size. For example, Armagh, with 14,590 is the seat of the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland and was re-granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 (having lost that status in local government reforms of 1840). In the Republic of Ireland, Kilkenny, the seat of the Butler dynasty, while no longer a city for administrative purposes (since the 2001 Local Government Act), is entitled by law to continue to use the description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Forest Statistics – Ireland 2017\" (PDF).

In the west, around County Galway and County Donegal, is a medium to high grade metamorphic and igneous complex of Caledonide affinity, similar to the Scottish Highlands. Across southeast Ulster and extending southwest to Longford and south to Navan is a province of Ordovician and Silurian rocks, with similarities to the Southern Uplands province of Scotland.

In a system that developed between the 13th and 17th centuries,[146] Ireland has 32 traditional counties. Twenty-six of these counties are in the Republic of Ireland, and six are in Northern Ireland. The six counties that constitute Northern Ireland are all in the province of Ulster (which has nine counties in total). As such, *Ulster* is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous. In the Republic of Ireland, counties form the basis of the system of local government. Counties Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Tipperary have been broken up into smaller administrative areas. However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example, postal addresses and by the Ordnance Survey Ireland. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n108. **^** \"Queen and Martin McGuinness shake hands\".

Native species include deciduous trees such as oak, ash, hazel, birch, alder, willow, aspen, rowan and hawthorn, as well as evergreen trees such Scots pine, yew, holly and strawberry trees.[135] Only about 10% of Ireland today is woodland;[12] most of this is non-native conifer plantations, and only 2% is native woodland.[13][14] The average woodland cover of European countries is over 33%.[12] In the Republic, about 389,356 hectares (3,893.56 km2) is owned by the state, mainly by the forestry service Coillte.[12] Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHydrocarbon exploration is ongoing following the first major find at the Kinsale Head gas field off Cork in the mid-1970s.[122][123] In 1999, economically significant finds of natural gas were made in the Corrib Gas Field off the County Mayo coast. This has increased activity off the west coast in parallel with the \"West of Shetland\" step-out development from the North Sea hydrocarbon province. In 2000, the Helvick oil field was discovered, which was estimated to contain over 28 million barrels (4,500,000 m3) of oil.[124]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Ireland\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n117. **^** \"Landscape of the River\".

Though the climate and soil favoured certain forms of agriculture,[233] trade barriers frequently hobbled its development. Repeated invasions and plantations disrupted land-ownership, and multiple failed uprisings also contributed to repeated phases of deportation and of emigration.\n\n\nSalient events in the economic history of Ireland include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite the two jurisdictions using two distinct currencies (the euro and pound sterling), a growing amount of commercial activity is carried out on an all-Ireland basis. This has been facilitated by the two jurisdictions' former shared membership of the European Union, and there have been calls from members of the business community and policymakers for the creation of an \"all-Ireland economy\" to take advantage of economies of scale and boost competitiveness.[227]\n\n\n\n#### Regional economics[edit]\n\n\nBelow is a comparison of the regional GDP on the island of Ireland.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Republic of Ireland: Northern and Western | Republic of Ireland: Eastern and Midland | Republic of Ireland: Southern | United Kingdom: Northern Ireland\n |\n| GDP (2018[update]): €22 bn[228] | GDP (2018[update]): €175 bn[228] | GDP (2018[update]): €127 bn[228] | GDP (2021[update]): £52 bn[226] |\n| €24,926 per person[229] | €74,824 per person[229] | €77,794 per person[229] | £27,154 per person[226] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith growing prosperity since the last decade of the 20th century, Ireland became a destination for immigrants. Since the European Union expanded to include Poland in 2004, Polish people have comprised the largest number of immigrants (over 150,000)[155] from Central Europe. There has also been significant immigration from Lithuania, Czech Republic and Latvia.[156]\n\n\nThe Republic of Ireland in particular has seen large-scale immigration, with 420,000 foreign nationals as of 2006, about 10% of the population.[157] Nearly a quarter of births (24 percent) in 2009 were to mothers born outside of Ireland.[158] Up to 50,000 eastern and central European migrant workers left Ireland in response to the Irish financial crisis.[159]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Ireland\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Romans referred to Ireland by this name too in its Latinised form, *Hibernia*, or Scotia.[44][45] Ptolemy records sixteen nations inhabiting every part of Ireland in 100 AD.[46] The relationship between the Roman Empire and the kingdoms of ancient Ireland is unclear. However, a number of finds of Roman coins have been made, for example at the Iron Age settlement of Freestone Hill near Gowran and Newgrange.[47]\n\n\nIreland continued as a patchwork of rival kingdoms; however, beginning in the 7th century, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through the concept of a High King of Ireland. Medieval Irish literature portrays an almost unbroken sequence of high kings stretching back thousands of years, but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n144. ^ ***a*** ***b*** McKittrick, David (19 December 2002). \"Census Reveals Northern Ireland's Protestant Population is at Record Low\". *The Independent*.
