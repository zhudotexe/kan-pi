Microsoft's purchase included rights to place international advertisements.[45][46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n**Facebook** is an online social media and social networking service owned by American technology giant Meta Platforms. Created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with four other Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives from the face book directories often given to American university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities. Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone to register from 13 years old (or older), except in the case of a handful of nations, where the age limit is 14 years.[6] As of December\u00a02022[update], Facebook claimed 3\u00a0billion monthly active users.[7] As of October 2023 Facebook ranked as the 3rd most visited website in the world with 22.56% of its traffic coming from the United States.[8][9] It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nZuckerberg built a website called \"Facemash\" in 2003 while attending Harvard University. The site was comparable to Hot or Not and used \"photos compiled from the online face books of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the \"hotter\" person\".[15] Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours.[16] The site was sent to several campus group listservs, but was shut down a few days later by Harvard administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged with breaching security, violating copyrights and violating individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.[15] Zuckerberg expanded on this project that semester by creating a social study tool. He uploaded art images, each accompanied by a comments section, to a website he shared with his classmates.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n250. **^** \"Facebook: Celebrate Your Birthday Every Day\".

Accessible worldwide,[7] it was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is owned by Google and is the second most visited website in the world, after Google Search. YouTube has more than 2.5 billion monthly users,[8] who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos every day.[9] As of May 2019[update], videos were being uploaded to the platform at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.[10][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nYouTube began as a venture capital\u2013funded technology startup. Between November 2005 and April 2006, the company raised money from various investors, with Sequoia Capital and Artis Capital Management being the largest two.[14][21] YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California.[22] In February 2005, the company activated `www.youtube.com`.[23] The first video was uploaded on April 23, 2005. Titled \"Me at the zoo\", it shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the site.[24][25] In May, the company launched a public beta and by November, a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million total views.[26][27] The site launched officially on December 15, 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8\u00a0million views a day.[28][29] Clips at the time were limited to 100 megabytes, as little as 30 seconds of footage.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe choice of the name `www.youtube.com` led to problems for a similarly named website, `www.utube.com`. That site's owner, Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment, filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November 2006 after being regularly overloaded by people looking for YouTube. Universal Tube subsequently changed its website to `www.utubeonline.com`.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Broadcast Yourself era (2006\u20132013)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. **^** Alleyne, Richard (July 31, 2008). \"YouTube: Overnight success has sparked a backlash\". *The Daily Telegraph*.

Karim could not easily find video clips of the incident and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami online, which led to the idea of a video-sharing site.[17] Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not.[16][18] They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a $100 reward.[19] Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, with the site's founders deciding to accept uploads of any video.[20]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. **^** Higgens, Bill (October 5, 2017). \"Hollywood Flashback: 'SNL's' 'Lazy Sunday' Put YouTube on the Map in 2005\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found.[304] When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the video.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n168. **^** \"No more links in comments?\". *Google product forums*. 2009.

A month earlier, after Koum purchased an iPhone, he and Acton decided to create an app for the App Store. The idea started off as an app that would display statuses in a phone's Contacts menu, showing if a person was at work or on a call.[62]\n\n\nTheir discussions often took place at the home of Koum's Russian friend Alex Fishman in West San Jose. They realized that to take the idea further, they would need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Horwitz, Jeff (February 12, 2020). \"As WhatsApp Tops 2 Billion Users, Its Boss Vows to Defend Encryption\". *Wall Street Journal*.

He officially joined WhatsApp on November 1.[27] Koum then hired a friend in Los Angeles, Chris Peiffer, to develop a BlackBerry version, which arrived two months later.[27] Subsequently, WhatsApp for Symbian OS was added in May 2010, and for Android OS in August 2010.[64] In 2010 Google made multiple acquisition offers for WhatsApp, which were all declined.[65]\n\n\nTo cover the cost of sending verification texts to users, WhatsApp was changed from a free service to a paid one. In December 2009, the ability to send photos was added to the iOS version. By early 2011, WhatsApp was one of the top 20 apps in the U.S. Apple App Store.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn April 2018, WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum announced he would be leaving the company.[109] By leaving before November 2018, due to concerns about privacy, advertising, and monetization by Facebook,[110] Acton and Koum gave up $1.3 billion in unvested stock options.[111] Facebook later announced that Koum's replacement would be Chris Daniels.[112]\n\n\nOn November 25, 2019, WhatsApp announced an investment of $250,000 through a partnership with Startup India to provide 500 startups with Facebook ad credits of $500 each.[113]\n\n\nIn December 2019, WhatsApp announced that a new update would lock out any Apple users who hadn't updated to iOS 9 or higher and Samsung, Huawei, Sony and Google users who hadn't updated to version 4.0 by February 1, 2020. The company also reported that Windows Phone operating systems would no longer be supported after December 31, 2019.[114] WhatsApp was announced to be the 3rd most downloaded mobile phone app of the decade 2010\u20132019.[115]\n\n\n\n### Since 2020[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKoum named the app WhatsApp to sound like \"what's up\". On February 24, 2009, he incorporated[63] WhatsApp Inc. in California. However, when early versions of WhatsApp kept crashing, Koum considered giving up and looking for a new job. Acton encouraged him to wait for a \"few more months\".[62]\n\n\nIn June 2009, when the app had been downloaded by only a handful of Fishman's Russian-speaking friends, Apple launched push notifications, allowing users to be pinged even when not using the app.\n\n\nKoum updated WhatsApp so that everyone in the user's network would be notified when a user's status changed. This new facility, to Koum's surprise, was used by users to ping \"each other with jokey custom statuses like, 'I woke up late' or 'I'm on my way.'\"[62]\n\n\nFishman said \"At some point it sort of became instant messaging\".[62]\n\n\nWhatsApp 2.0, released for iPhone in August 2009, featured a purpose-designed messaging component; the number of active users suddenly increased to 250,000.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessaging and VoIP service owned by Meta Platforms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsApp| ![](image) |\n| Original author(s) | Brian Acton, Jan Koum |\n| Developer(s) | Meta Platforms, Will Cathcart (Head of WhatsApp)[1][2] |\n| Initial release | February\u00a02009; 15\u00a0years ago\u00a0(2009-02) |\n|  |\n| Stable release(s) [\u00b1] |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| iOS | 24.6.77[3]\u00a0![Edit this on Wikidata](image) / March 25, 2024; 2 months ago\u00a0(March 25, 2024) |\n| Android | 2.24.6.78[4]\u00a0![Edit this on Wikidata](image) / March 25, 2024; 2 months ago\u00a0(March 25, 2024) |\n| Windows | 2.2411.4.0[5]\u00a0![Edit this on Wikidata](image) / March 25, 2024; 2 months ago\u00a0(March 25, 2024) |\n| macOS | 2.24.5.76[6]\u00a0![Edit this on Wikidata](image) / March 14, 2024; 2 months ago\u00a0(March 14, 2024) |\n\n |\n| Preview release(s) [\u00b1] |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Android (Beta) | 2.24.7.25[7]\u00a0![Edit this on Wikidata](image) / March 29, 2024; 2 months ago\u00a0(March 29, 2024) |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** O'Connell, Ainsley (February 21, 2014). \"Inside Erlang, The Rare Programming Language Behind WhatsApp's Success\". *fastcompany.com*.

Previously the Android and Nokia Series 40 versions used an MD5-hashed, reversed-version of the phone's IMEI as password,[204] while the iOS version used the phone's Wi-Fi MAC address instead of IMEI.[205][206] A 2012 update implemented generation of a random password on the server side.[207] Alternatively a user can send to any contact in the WhatsApp database through the url `https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=[phone number]` where `[phone number]` is the number of the contact including the country code.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n167. **^** Porter, Jon (July 27, 2023). \"WhatsApp adds a quicker way to send short videos to your friends\". *The Verge*.

In April 2012, Facebook Inc. acquired the service for approximately US$1\u00a0billion in cash and stock. The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. As of October\u00a02015[update], over 40\u00a0billion photos had been uploaded. Although often admired for its success and influence, Instagram has also been criticized for negatively affecting teens' mental health, its policy and interface changes, its alleged censorship, and illegal and inappropriate content uploaded by users.\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Instagram.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Instagram icon from 2016 to 2022, when it was updated to include even more saturated colors\nInstagram began development in San Francisco as **Burbn**, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger.

At the time of the announcement, it was reported that 80% of Instagram's 600\u00a0million users were located outside the U.S., and while the aforementioned functionality was live at its announcement, Instagram also announced its intention to make more features available offline, and that they were \"exploring an iOS version\".On April 9, 2012, Facebook, Inc. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nstated that the company is developing a version of the feed that would show user posts in chronological order.[289] He later clarified the company would introduce two modes: a classic chronological feed and a version of it that would let users pick \"favorite\" users whose posts would be shown at the top in chronological order while other posts would be mixed in below.[290]\n\n\nSince 2017, Instagram has employed the ability to reduce the prominence of accounts (\"shadowbanning\") it believes may be generating non-genuine engagement and spam (including excessive use of unneeded hashtags), preventing posts from appearing in search results and in the app's Explore section. In a now-deleted Facebook post, Instagram wrote that \"When developing content, we recommend focusing on your business objective or goal rather than hashtags\".[291][292] Instagram has since been accused of extending the practice to censor posts under vague and inconsistent circumstances, particularly in regards to sexually suggestive material.[293]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n209. **^** Etherington, Darrell (May 25, 2017). \"Instagram direct messages now support web links and different photo orientations\". *TechCrunch*.
