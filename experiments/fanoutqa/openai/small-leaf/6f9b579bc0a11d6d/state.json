It was originally the home of Everton from 1884 to 1891, before they moved to Goodison Park after a dispute with the club president.[3]\n\n\nThe stadium has four stands: the Spion Kop, the Main Stand, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand and the Anfield Road End.[4] The record attendance of 61,905 was set at a match between Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952.[5] The ground converted to an all-seater stadium in 1994 as a result of the Taylor Report, which reduced its capacity.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group in October 2010 put into question whether Liverpool would leave Anfield. In February 2011 the new club owner, John W. Henry, stated he had a preference for staying at Anfield and expanding the capacity. After attending a number of games at Anfield, Henry stated that \"the Kop is unrivalled\", adding \"it would be hard to replicate that feeling anywhere else\".[61]\nOn 15 October 2012, Liverpool City Council announced plans to regenerate the Anfield area after securing a \u00a325m grant, with a housing association also set to invest.[62][63]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![A stand which is full of people standing to support their team. There are a number of flags, scarfs, and banners in the crowd.](image)*The Kop*; the atmosphere generated by the crowd in the stand led owner John W. Henry to reconsider the construction of a new stadium.\nPlans to replace Anfield were originally started by Liverpool F.C. in May 2002.[53] The proposed capacity was 55,000, but it was later changed to 61,000, with 1,000\u00a0seats given for segregation between home and away fans. Several attempts were made between 2003 and 2007 by the Liverpool City Council to instigate a groundshare of the proposed stadium with local rivals Everton, but this move was rejected, as neither club favoured it.[54] On 30 July 2004 Liverpool was granted planning permission to build a new stadium 300 yards (270\u00a0m) away from Anfield at Stanley Park.[55] On 8 September 2006 Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool F.C. a 999-year lease of the land on the proposed site.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Anfield (stadium).\n53\u00b025\u203251\u2033N 2\u00b057\u203239\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff53.43083\u00b0N 2.96083\u00b0W\ufeff / 53.43083; -2.96083\n\nListen to this article (24 minutes)\n![Spoken Wikipedia icon](image)\nThis audio file was created from a revision of this article dated 14\u00a0February\u00a02013\u00a0(2013-02-14), and does not reflect subsequent edits.\n(Audio help\u00a0\u00b7 More spoken articles)\n\n![](image) Media related to Anfield Stadium at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n* Anfield at LiverpoolFC.com\n* Football Ground Guide page\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLiverpool Football Club\n |\n| --- |\n| * Honours\n* Managers\n* Seasons\n* Records and statistics\n* Reserves & Academy\n* Current season\n |\n| History | * 1892\u20131959\n* 1959\u20131985\n* 1985\u2013present\n* European record\n\t+ List of matches\n* *Founding Fathers of Merseyside Football*\n |\n| Home stadium | * Anfield\n |\n| Training ground | * Melwood\n* The Academy\n |\n| Players | * 100+ appearances\n* 25\u201399 appearances\n* 1\u201324 appearances\n* Player of the Season Awards\n |\n| Rivalries | * League record by opponent\n* Chelsea rivalry\n* Manchester City rivalry\n* Manchester United rivalry\n* Merseyside derby\n |\n| Tragedies | * Heysel disaster\n* Hillsborough disaster\n |\n| Controversies | * 1915 British football match-fixing scandal\n* 2022 UEFA Champions League final chaos\n |\n| Supporters | * Spirit of Shankly\n* Fans Supporting Foodbanks\n |\n| Media | * LFC TV\n* *Being: Liverpool*\n* *Liverpool (video game)*\n* *The Anfield Wrap*\n* *Well Red magazine*\n* *Fearless*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLiverpool did not lose a league match at Anfield during the 1893\u201394, 1970\u201371, 1976\u201377, 1978\u201379, 1979\u201380, 1987\u201388, 2008\u201309, 2017\u201318, 2018\u201319, 2019\u201320 and 2021\u201322 seasons.

Liverpool won 4\u20130 in front of 5,000\u00a0spectators.[18] A new stand capable of holding 3,000\u00a0spectators was constructed in 1895 on the site of the present Main Stand. Designed by architect Archibald Leitch,[19] the stand had a distinctive red and white gable, and was similar to the main stand at Newcastle United's ground St James' Park.[17] Another stand was constructed at the Anfield Road end in 1903, built from timber and corrugated iron. After Liverpool had won their second League championship in 1906, a new stand was built along the Walton Breck Road. Local journalist Ernest Edwards, who was the sports editor of newspapers the *Liverpool Daily Post* and *Echo*, named it the Spion Kop; it was named after a famous hill in South Africa where a local regiment had suffered heavy losses during the Boer War in 1900. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPremier League venues\n |\n| --- |\n| Current | * Anfield\n* Bramall Lane\n* Brentford Community Stadium\n* City of Manchester Stadium\n* City Ground\n* Craven Cottage\n* Dean Court\n* Emirates Stadium\n* Falmer Stadium\n* Goodison Park\n* Kenilworth Road\n* London Stadium\n* Molineux\n* Old Trafford\n* St James' Park\n* Selhurst Park\n* Stamford Bridge\n* Tottenham Hotspur Stadium\n* Turf Moor\n* Villa Park\n |\n| Former | * Bet365 Stadium\n* Bloomfield Road\n* Boundary Park\n* Cardiff City Stadium\n* Carrow Road\n* County Ground\n* DW Stadium\n* Elland Road\n* Ewood Park\n* Fratton Park\n* The Hawthorns\n* Hillsborough Stadium\n* King Power Stadium\n* Kirklees Stadium\n* Loftus Road\n* Madejski Stadium\n* MKM Stadium\n* Oakwell\n* Portman Road\n* Pride Park\n* Riverside Stadium\n* Stadium of Light\n* St Andrew's\n* St Mary's Stadium\n* Swansea.com Stadium\n* Toughsheet Community Stadium\n* The Valley\n* Valley Parade\n* Vicarage Road\n* Wembley Stadium\n |\n| Demolished | * Ayresome Park\n* Baseball Ground\n* Boleyn Ground\n* Burnden Park\n* The Dell\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n52. **^** Moynihan (2008). p. 31.\n53. **^** \"Liverpool unveil new stadium\". *BBC Sport*. 17 May 2002.

Kirkdale Station, about 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) from the stadium, is the nearest station to Anfield. Fans travelling by train for matches may book direct to Anfield or Goodison Park, changing to the Peoplesbus Soccerbus service at Sandhills Station on the Merseyrail Northern Line.[116] The stadium has no parking facilities for supporters, and the streets around the ground allow parking only for residents with permits, although there are a small number of passes that can be allocated to over-65s. There are proposals under consideration for reinstating passenger traffic on the Bootle Branch, which would cut the distance from the nearest railway station to about 0.5 miles (1\u00a0km).[117]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* The Liverpool Sound\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe oldest stand at Anfield is the Main Stand, taking 76 years to complete. The stand was completed in 2016, however, the lower section dates from 1906. The bottom tier of the stand houses the directors' box. The directors' VIP box is located at the rear of the lower tier of the stand. The old large roof was supported by two thin central uprights, with a large suspended television camera gantry which has moved to the front of the third tier.[41] The players' tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match are in the middle of the stand at pitch level. Above the stairs leading down to the pitch hung a sign stating \"THIS IS ANFIELD\". Its purpose was to both intimidate the opposition and to bring the Liverpool players who touch it good luck. Accordingly, Liverpool players and coaching staff traditionally reached up and placed one or both hands on it as they passed underneath.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnfield has hosted numerous international matches, and was one of the venues used during UEFA Euro 1996; the ground hosted three group games and a quarter-final.[90] The first international match hosted at Anfield was between England and Ireland, in 1889. England won the match 6\u20131. Anfield was also the home venue for several of England's international football matches in the early 1900s, and for the Welsh national team in the later part of that century.[91][92] Anfield has also played host to five FA Cup semi-finals, the last of which was in 1929.[91] The most recent international to be hosted at Anfield was England's 2\u20131 victory over Uruguay on 1 March 2006.[93] The close proximity of the stands to the pitch prevents the club from extending the pitch to suit UEFA's parameter requirements; since 2006, the stadium has been ineligible to host England games, Champions League and Europa League finals, and UEFA tournaments (UEFA Euro 2028).[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n94. **^** \"Euro 2028 stadiums: Why Anfield and Old Trafford will not host any games\". *Give Me Sport*. 10 October 2023.

Both managers have been honoured with statues outside the stadium: Shankly's unveiled in 1997 by the Kop Stand and Paisley's in 2020 by the Main Stand. The ground is 2 miles (3\u00a0km) from Liverpool Lime Street railway station.\n\n\nIt was proposed in 2002 for the club to relocate to a new stadium in the adjacent Stanley Park, but after the acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group in 2010 it was made clear this would not happen, with the decision being taken to expand Anfield instead. Construction for an extension to the main stand began on 8 December 2014.[6] This extension, one of the largest all-seater single stands in European football, opened to the public on 9 September 2016, increasing the stadium capacity to 53,394.[7]\nThe Anfield Road Stand is currently being redeveloped to bring the stadium capacity to 61,000.

There's something about it that you will find in no other stadium in the world.\"[46] Following the 2005 Champions League semi-final second leg at Anfield which Liverpool won 1\u20130, defeated Chelsea manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho recognised the role Liverpool fans played on the match: \"I felt the power of Anfield, it was magnificent.\"[47]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n67. **^** \"LFC reveal stadium expansion vision\". *liverpoolfc.com*. 23 April 2014.

Events culminated in Everton's move to Goodison Park.[14] Houlding was left with an empty stadium, and decided to form a new club to occupy it. The new team was called Liverpool F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd, and the club's first match at Anfield was a friendly played in front of 200 people on 1 September 1892, against Rotherham Town. Liverpool won 7\u20131.[17]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Other sports[edit]\n\n\nAnfield has been the venue for many other events. During the mid-twenties, Anfield was the finishing line for the city marathon. Liverpool held an annual race which started from St George's plateau in the city centre and finished with a lap of Anfield.[91] Boxing matches were regularly held at Anfield during the inter-war years, including a number of British boxing championships; on 12 June 1934 Nel Tarleton beat Freddie Miller for the World Featherweight title. Professional tennis was played at Anfield on boards on the pitch. US Open champion, Bill Tilden, and Wimbledon champion, Fred Perry, entertained the crowds in an exhibition match. In 1958, an exhibition basketball match featuring the Harlem Globetrotters was held at the ground.[103]\n\n\n\n### Non sporting events[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Old Christ Church\n* The Oratory\n* Princes Road Synagogue\n* St George's Church\n* Saint John the Baptist's Church\n* St Luke's Church\n* St Luke's Church, Walton\n* St Michael's Church\n* St Peter's Church\n* Toxteth Unitarian Chapel\n* Ullet Road Unitarian Church\n* Welsh Presbyterian Church\n |\n| Transportation | * James Street station\n* Kingsway Tunnel\n* Liverpool Central station\n* Liverpool Coach Station\n* Liverpool John Lennon Airport\n* Liverpool Lime Street station\n* Liverpool One bus station\n* Liverpool South Parkway station\n* Mersey Railway Tunnel\n* Moorfields station\n* Queensway Tunnel\n |\n| Shopping complexes | * Clayton Square Shopping Centre\n* Lewis's Building\n* Liverpool ONE\n* Liverpool Shopping Park\n* Metquarter\n* New Mersey Shopping Park\n* St Johns Shopping Centre\n |\n| Sports venues and arenas | * Aigburth Cricket Ground\n* Anfield\n* Goodison Park\n* Liverpool Arena\n* O2 Academy Liverpool\n* Walton Hall Park\n* Wavertree Athletics Centre\n |\n| Sculptures and monuments | * Liverpool Cenotaph\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n108. **^** \"Rolling Stones announce new 2022 summer tour - how to get tickets to the big Liverpool show at Anfield\".

The arrangement allowed 1860 Munich to play at the stadium while retaining no ownership until 2025.[4] However, in July 2017 Bayern terminated the rental contract with 1860, making themselves the sole tenants of the stadium.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFC Bayern Munich\n |\n| --- |\n| Information | * Club\n* History\n* Players\n* Reserve team players\n* Managers\n* Matches\n* Records & Statistics\n* International competitions\n* Current season\n |\n| Stadia | * Allianz Arena\n* Olympiastadion\n* Gr\u00fcnwalder Stadion\n* FC Bayern Campus\n |\n| Other teams | * Women's Team\n* Reserve Team\n* Junior Team\n* Basketball Team\n |\n| Seasons | * List of seasons\n* List of women's team seasons\n* List of reserve team seasons\n |\n| Rivalries | * Munich derby\n* Bavarian derby\n* Der Klassiker\n* Real Madrid\n |\n| Related articles | * Franz Beckenbauer Cup\n* Uli Hoene\u00df Cup\n* Audi Cup\n* \"Stern des S\u00fcdens\"\n* \"Bayern\"\n* Bayern-luck\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEuropean Cup and UEFA Champions League final venues\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFootball stadium in the north of Munich, Bavaria, Germany\n\nFor other uses, see Allianz Stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllianz Arena| \"Schlauchboot\" (\"dinghy\").[1][2]Fu\u00dfball Arena M\u00fcnchen (UEFA competitions)\n |\n| ![](image) |\n| ![](image)**UEFA** ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)\n |\n| ![Map](image) |\n| ![Munich is located in Germany](image)![Munich](image)\nMunich\nLocation in Germany\nShow map of Germany\n![Munich is located in Europe](image)![Munich](image)\nMunich\nLocation in Europe\nShow map of Europe\n |\n| Full name | Allianz Arena |\n| Address | Werner-Heisenberg-Allee 25, 80939 |\n| Location | Munich, Bavaria, Germany |\n| Public transit | ![](image) at Fr\u00f6ttmaning |\n| Owner | Allianz Arena M\u00fcnchen Stadion GmbH |\n| Operator | Allianz Arena M\u00fcnchen Stadion GmbH |\n| Executive suites | 106 |\n| Capacity | * 75,024 (domestic matches)\n* 70,000 (international and European matches)\n* Capacity history\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\t+ 66,000 (2005)\n\t+ 69,901 (2006\u20132012)\n\t+ 71,137 (2012\u20132013)\n\t+ 71,437 (2013\u20132015)\n |\n| Field size | 105 by 68 metres (114.8\u00a0yd \u00d7\u00a074.4\u00a0yd) |\n| Surface | hybrid grass[3] |\n| Construction |\n| Broke ground | 21\u00a0October 2002;21 years ago\u00a0(2002-10-21) |\n| Opened | 30\u00a0May 2005; 19 years ago\u00a0(2005-05-30) |\n| Construction cost | \u20ac340\u00a0million |\n| Architect | * Herzog & de Meuron\n* ArupSport\n |\n| Structural engineer | Ove Arup & Partners |\n| Tenants |\n| * Bayern Munich (2005\u2013present)\n* 1860 Munich (2005\u20132017)\n* Germany national football team (selected matches)\n |\n| Website |\n| allianz-arena.com/en |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"Munich to host first-ever regular-season NFL game in Germany during 2022 season; Frankfurt also to host future games\". *NFL.com*.

This was to remain the visitors' only goal that day, as the game went to the FC Bayern with a final score of 3\u20131.\n\n\nFC Bayern broke its consecutive sell-out record by selling out each of its first ten home games at Allianz Arena.\n\n\n\n![](image)Inside Allianz Arena during a match between Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich, 10 June 2005\n## International tournament matches[edit]\n\n\n### 2006 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. However, due to sponsorship contracts, the arena was called *FIFA World Cup Stadium Munich* during the World Cup.\n\n\nThe following games were played at the stadium during the World Cup of 2006:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe large locally based financial services provider Allianz purchased the naming rights to the stadium for 30 years. However, this name cannot be used when hosting FIFA and UEFA events, since these governing bodies have policies forbidding corporate sponsorship from companies that are not official tournament partners. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the stadium was referred to as FIFA WM-Stadion M\u00fcnchen (FIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich).

Merchandise is offered at stands all along the inside of the exterior wall inside the area behind the seats. Numerous restaurants and fast-food establishments are also located around the stadium.\n\n\nThere are four team locker rooms (one each for the two home teams and their respective opponents), four coaches' locker rooms, and two locker rooms for referees. Two areas are provided where athletes can warm up (approx. 110 m2 each). There are also 550 toilets and 190 monitors in the arena.\n\n\nOn 28 April 2013, FC Bayern announced to sell 300 more tickets in the S\u00fcdkurve starting with the 2013\u201314 Bundesliga season.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Bridges | * Reichenbachbr\u00fccke\n |\n| * Architecture of Munich\n* Outline of Munich\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nTSV 1860 Munich\n |\n| --- |\n| Information | * Club\n* Players\n* Managers\n* Reserve team\n |\n| Stadia | * Allianz Arena\n* Olympiastadion\n* Gr\u00fcnwalder Stadion\n |\n| Rivalries | * Munich derby\n* FC Augsburg\n |\n| Seasons | * 1965\u201366\n* 1995\u201396\n* 1999\u20132000\n* 2003\u201304\n* 2011\u201312\n* 2012\u201313\n* 2013\u201314\n* 2014\u201315\n* 2015\u201316\n* 2022\u201323\n* 2023\u201324\n |\n| Matches | * 1931 German football championship Final\n* 1942 Tschammerpokal Final\n* 1964 DFB-Pokal Final\n* 1965 European Cup Winners' Cup Final\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Allianz Arena** (German: [a\u02c8li\u032fants \u0294a\u02cc\u0281e\u02d0na]; known as **Fu\u00dfball Arena M\u00fcnchen** for UEFA competitions) is a football stadium in Munich, Bavaria, Germany, with a 70,000 seating capacity for international matches and 75,000 for domestic matches. Widely known for its exterior of inflated ETFE plastic panels, it is the first stadium in the world with a full colour changing exterior. Located at 25 Werner-Heisenberg-Allee at the northern edge of Munich's Schwabing-Freimann borough on the Fr\u00f6ttmaning Heath, it is the second-largest arena in Germany behind Westfalenstadion in Dortmund.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The stadium's interior following the so-called \"Bayernization\" in 2018\nFollowing the departure of TSV 1860 Munich from the stadium due to its relegation to 3. Liga in 2016\u201317, Bayern Munich went on to give Allianz Arena a significant facelift a year later, replacing old grey seats with new ones that create a combination of red and white, the colors of the club. The stadium now presents FC Bayern crest on the stand, the \"FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen\" writing on one side and the \"Mia San Mia\" \u2013 the club's motto \u2013 on the other. Furthermore, several other modifications have also been made, including decorating walls with images of the club's history, bringing a larger quantity of red, and the opening of the FC Bayern store.[17]\n\n\n\n### Stadium corruption affair[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEffective with the city's approval of modifications that was granted 16 January 2006, the legal capacity of the stadium increased from 69,000 to 71,000 spectators (including standing room). The lower tier can seat up to 20,000, the middle tier up to 24,000, and the upper tier up to 22,000. 10,400 of the seats in the lower tier corners can be converted to standing room to allow an additional 3,120 spectators. The total capacity includes 2,000 business seats, 400 seats for the press, 106 luxury boxes with seating for up to 174, and 165 berths for wheelchairs and the like. From the second half of the 2005\u201306 Bundesliga season, the arena is able to accommodate 69,901 spectators at league and DFB-Pokal games, but because of UEFA regulations, the capacity remained at 66,000 seats for UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup games. Bayern Munich limited capacity during their league and cup games to 69,000. The partial roof covers all seats, although winds can still blow rain onto some of them. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 19 May 2012, the 2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League final was held at the Allianz Arena. Bayern Munich, who were drawn as home team, was set to play against Chelsea. Chelsea won on penalties after the game had tied 1\u20131 after regulation and extra time. Bastian Schweinsteiger's penalty hit Petr \u010cech's left post, and Didier Drogba scored the winning penalty. On 25 May 2012, Bayern opened a museum about its history, FC Bayern Erlebniswelt, inside the Allianz Arena.[16]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Surroundings[edit]\n\n\nFrom the subway station just south of the arena, visitors approach the stadium through a park that was designed to disentangle and guide them to the entrance. An esplanade rises gradually from ground level at the subway station entrance, practically building the parking garage's cover, to the entrance level of the stadium. On the other side of the Autobahn, the Fr\u00f6ttmaning Hill with its windmill affords a marvellous view on the stadium. Also the Romanesque Heilig-Kreuz-Kirche, the oldest structure on the area of the City of Munich designed to serve religious purposes, is located there together with its copy, an artwork in concrete as a reminder for the village of Fr\u00f6ttmaning which disappeared with the construction of the Autobahn.\n\n\n\n### Owners[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 21 January 2014, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge declared that FC Bayern discusses a further expansion of the Allianz Arena.[11] About 2,000 new seats to be installed in the upper tier and about 2,000 more tickets are to be sold in the Nord- and S\u00fcdkurve. In August 2014, it was reported that the capacity expansion was completed leading to a new maximum capacity of 75,024 in the Bundesliga and 69,334 in international matches.[12] An expansion was approved in January 2015 to expand the stadium's capacity to 75,000 for Bundesliga Games and 70,000 for games in the Champions League.[13]\n\n\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Aerial photo of Allianz Arena with surrounding area shortly before construction was complete (January 2005)\nOn 14 November 2005 at the annual general meeting, many FC Bayern Munich club members complained about the uncomfortable draft inside the arena. As a result, closable doors were installed and spectators now enjoy watching the games in greater comfort.\n\n\nThe Ultras and many other fans protested at several home games against the seats and some of the rules of the arena which they perceive as \"fan unfriendly.\" For example, a spectator may not enter with a megaphone or a pennant that a single person cannot carry unfurled, and pennant poles with a length of over one metre are prohibited. The complaint is that these rules and the designer seats put a damper on the fan experience. The presence of a large fence and safety nets in front of the southern curve (seat bloc reserved for fans of FC Bayern Munich) are also often criticized.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** \"Nuts and bolts\". allianz-arena.de.

In the same game, Thomas Hitzlsperger of VfB Stuttgart scored the first goal in an official game by a visiting team. The game ended with a 2\u20131 win for Stuttgart.\n\n\nThe first goal in a league game was scored by Owen Hargreaves of FC Bayern when the home team won 3\u20130 in its 2005\u201306 Bundesliga season opener against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach on 5 August 2005. The first goal in a league game by a visiting team was scored by Dynamo Dresden on 9 September 2005 in the 2. Bundesliga match against 1860 Munich. That game ended in a score of 1\u20132 in front of a full house which included approximately 20,000 \u2013 22,000 fans who had traveled to Munich from Dresden for the game. Dresden thus became the first visiting team to win a league game at Allianz Arena.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAllianz Arena's innovative stadium-facade lighting concept has been subsequently adopted in other recently built venues, like MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, which lights up in blue for the National Football League's Giants and green for the Jets. With electricity costs for the light of about \u20ac50 (USD$75) per hour, the construction emits enough light that, on clear nights, the stadium can easily be spotted from Austrian mountain tops, e.g. from a distance of 50 miles (80\u00a0km).\n\n\n\n![](image)Allianz Arena\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nPatrons may park their cars in Europe's largest parking structure, comprising four four-story parking garages with 9,800 parking places. In addition, 1,200 places were built into the first two tiers of the arena, 350 places are available for buses (240 at the north end, and 110 at the south entrance), and 130 more spots are reserved for those with disabilities.\n\n\nThe stadium is located next to the Fr\u00f6ttmaning U-Bahn station. This is on the U6 line of the Munich U-Bahn.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** \"Munich to host first-ever regular-season NFL game in Germany during 2022 season; Frankfurt also to host future games\". *NFL.com*.

FC N\u00fcrnberg and won, 3\u20132. The next day, the record German champions Bayern Munich played a game against the Germany national team.[18] Both games had been sold out since early March 2005. Patrick Milchraum of TSV 1860 scored the first official goal at the stadium.\n\n\nOn 2 June 2005, in response to high demand, the first \"arena derby\" took place between the two tenants. That game was won by TSV 1860 with the help of a goal by Paul Agostino.\n\n\nPrior to opening day, the alumni teams of both clubs played each other in an exhibition game in front of a crowd of 30,000. During the game, all stadium functions were thoroughly tested.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDue to 1860 Munich's financial turbulence, Bayern Munich took over all the shares and owns 100 per cent of the Allianz Arena.\n\n\n\n### Name[edit]\n\n\nAllianz paid significant sums for the right to lend its name to the stadium for a duration of 30 years. However, as Allianz was not a sponsor of the 2006 World Cup and is not an official UEFA sponsor, the Allianz logo had to be removed during the World Cup and is covered during Champions League games.\n\n\n\n### Cost[edit]\n\n\nThe cost of the construction itself ran to \u20ac286\u00a0million but financing costs raised that figure to a total of \u20ac340\u00a0million. In addition, the city and State incurred approximately \u20ac210\u00a0million for area development and infrastructure improvements.\n\n\n\n## Reactions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe arena facade is constructed of 2,874 ETFE-foil air panels that are kept inflated with dry air to a differential pressure of 3.5 Pa.[15] The panels appear white from far away but when examined closely, there are little dots on the panels. When viewed from far away, the eye combines the dots and sees white. When viewed close up however, it is possible to see through the foil. The foil has a thickness of 0.2\u00a0mm. Each panel can be independently lit with white, red, or blue light. The panels are lit for each game with the colours of the respective home team\u2014red for Bayern Munich, blue for TSV and white for the Germany national team. White is also used when the stadium is a neutral venue, like the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final. Other colours or multicolour or interchanging lighting schemes are theoretically possible, but the Munich Police strongly insists on using a single-colour lighting scheme due to several car accidents on the nearby A9 Autobahn with drivers being distracted by the changing lights.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe arena was commissioned by the Allianz Arena M\u00fcnchen Stadion GmbH, founded in 2001, and was owned in equal parts by the two football clubs that called it home. The GmbH's CEO was Karl-Heinz Wildmoser Jr. until the unraveling of the stadium corruption affair (see below). Since then, Bernd Rauch, Peter Kerspe, and Walter Leidecker have led the company. In April 2006, FC Bayern Munich bought out TSV 1860 Munich's 50 per cent share in the arena for a reported \u20ac11\u00a0million. 1860 managing director Stefan Ziffzer stated that the deal prevented insolvency for the club. The terms of the agreement gave 1860 the right to buy back their 50 per cent share of the arena for the price of sale plus interest anytime before June 2010. In November 2007, 1860 Munich resigned that right. In advance, the income of two friendly-games both clubs shared equally instead of having that money going to Allianz Arena GmbH. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese complaints have had some success. From the 2006\u201307 season, blocks 112 and 113 have been converted into terracing, in the usual German style so that seats can be installed for UEFA and international matches, whose regulations demand seating for all spectators.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seating area of the Allianz Arena\nOn 21 October 2002, voters went to the polls to determine whether a new stadium should be built in this location and whether the city of Munich should provide the necessary infrastructure.

The primary designers are architects Herzog & de Meuron. The stadium is designed so that the main entrance to the stadium would be from an elevated esplanade separated from the parking space consisting of Europe's biggest underground car park.[14] The roof of the stadium has built-in roller blinds which may be drawn back and forth during games to provide protection from the sun.\n\n\n\n* Total concrete used during stadium construction: 120,000 m\u00b3\n* Total concrete used for the parking garage: 85,000 m\u00b3\n* Total steel used during stadium construction: 22,000 tonnes\n* Total steel used for the parking garage: 14,000 tonnes\n\n\n### Luminous exterior[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSwiss architect firm Herzog & de Meuron then developed the concept of the stadium with a see-through exterior made of ETFE-foil panels that can be lit from the inside and are self-cleaning. Construction started in late 2002 and was completed by the end of April 2005.\n\n\nThe Fr\u00f6ttmaning and Marienplatz stations of the subway line U6 were expanded and improved in conjunction with the arena construction. The Fr\u00f6ttmaning subway stations platforms were moved slightly southwards and expanded from two to four tracks, while the Marienplatz U-Bahn station was outfitted with additional pedestrian connector tunnels running parallel to the subway tracks, which lead towards the S-Bahn portion of the station, lessening congestion among passengers making connections to the Munich S-Bahn. To be able to handle the additional traffic load, the Autobahn A9 was expanded to three and four lanes in each direction and another exit was added to the A99 north of the arena.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2020 stadiums\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![Netherlands](image) Johan Cruyff Arena (Amsterdam)\n* ![Azerbaijan](image) Olympic Stadium (Baku)\n* ![Romania](image) Arena Na\u021bional\u0103 (Bucharest)\n* ![Hungary](image) Pusk\u00e1s Ar\u00e9na (Budapest)\n* ![Denmark](image) Parken Stadium (Copenhagen)\n* ![Scotland](image) Hampden Park (Glasgow)\n* ![England](image) Wembley Stadium (London)\n* ![Germany](image) Allianz Arena (Munich)\n* ![Italy](image) Stadio Olimpico (Rome)\n* ![Russia](image) Krestovsky Stadium (Saint Petersburg)\n* ![Spain](image) Estadio La Cartuja (Seville)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2024 stadiums\n |\n| --- |\n| * Olympiastadion (Berlin)\n* RheinEnergieStadion (Cologne)\n* Westfalenstadion (Dortmund)\n* Merkur Spiel-Arena (D\u00fcsseldorf)\n* Waldstadion (Frankfurt)\n* Arena AufSchalke (Gelsenkirchen)\n* Volksparkstadion (Hamburg)\n* Red Bull Arena (Leipzig)\n* Allianz Arena (Munich)\n* MHPArena (Stuttgart)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween March 2004 and August 2006, a corruption affair relating to the stadium occupied the football world and German courts.

Some notable high-profile appearances include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2022, Barcelona had the largest known attendances for women's football since the 1971 Women's World Cup final,[58][59] Mexico\u2013Denmark (110,000), at the Azteca Stadium.[60][61] Real Madrid and Wolfsburg were the visiting teams at Camp Nou in the Women's Champions League (91,553 and 91,648).[59][60]\n\n\n\n## Transport connections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Avinguda de Xile Station\nThe stadium is accessible from the Barcelona Metro with the closest stations to Camp Nou are Palau Reial, Maria Cristina and Les Corts, on L3; Badal on L5 and Collblanc on L5 or L9.[62] All are 500 to 1,000 metres (0.31 to 0.62\u00a0mi) from Camp Nou, depending on which of the gates (accesses) to Camp Nou are used. Usually metro services are increased when there is a match, which causes significant passenger congestion.\n\n\nA new station, named Avinguda de Xile / Camp Nou, is under construction and will be served by L9 and L10.[63][64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn April 2022, it was announced that renovation of the stadium would commence in June 2023 after the season's end. It is expected to be completed during the 2025\u201326 season.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the stands displaying Barcelona's motto, *M\u00e9s que un club*, meaning \"More than a club\"\n![](image)A view of the supporters' side during a match, showing the FC Barcelona colours\n![](image)Main stand external view of the stadium\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\nThe construction of the Camp Nou started on 28 March 1954 as Barcelona's previous stadium, Camp de Les Corts, had no room for expansion. Although originally planned to be called the Estadi del FC Barcelona, the more popular name Camp Nou (\"new field\") was used.[13] The June 1950 signing of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala, regarded as one of Barcelona's greatest players, provided further impetus to the construction of a larger stadium.[14][15][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 18 September 2007, the British architect Norman Foster and his company were selected to \"restructure\" the Camp Nou. The plan included the addition of roughly 6,000 seats, for a maximum capacity of 105,000, at an estimated cost of \u20ac250 million.[43] The Barcelona board approved the sale of their former training ground (the Mini Estadi) against significant opposition in order to finance the remodeling. The project was planned to begin in 2009 and to be finished for the 2011\u201312 season.[44] However, due to the 2008 financial crisis, the sale of the training ground was postponed, and likewise the remodeling project. In May 2010, Sandro Rosell, then a candidate for president of Barcelona, dismissed the possibility of selling the Mini Estadi, saying it would be indefensible to \"sell the crown jewels\", and his election on 30 June 2010 effectively halted the plan to remodel the Camp Nou.[45][46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* La Romareda\n* L'Hospitalet de Llobregat Baseball Stadium\n* Mollet del Vall\u00e8s Shooting Range\n* Palau d'Esports de Granollers\n* Parc Ol\u00edmpic del Segre\n* Pavell\u00f3 Club Joventut Badalona\n* Pavell\u00f3 de l'Ateneu de Sant Sadurn\u00ed\n* Pavell\u00f3 del Club Pat\u00ed Vic\n* Pavell\u00f3 d'Esports de Reus\n* Pavell\u00f3 Ol\u00edmpic de Badalona\n* Sant Sadurn\u00ed Cycling Circuit\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOlympic venues in association football\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe architects were Francesc Mitjans and Josep Soteras, with the collaboration of Lorenzo Garc\u00eda-Barb\u00f3n.[21]\n\n\nFinally, on 24 September 1957, the feast of La Merc\u00e8, the Camp Nou was inaugurated.[22] A solemn mass presided over by the archbishop, who welcomed the finished stadium, preceded the Hallelujah from Handel's Messiah. Dignitaries of the Franco regime and of the city gathered in the presidential tribune, and some 90,000 people attended the opening ceremony in the stands of the huge stadium. During the event, football clubs from all over Catalonia paraded on the field, as well as members of the different sections of Bar\u00e7a, the penyes and the different Barcelona teams.[22][23]\n\n\nJust like Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium of Real Madrid, the stadium was inspired by De Kuip, home of Feyenoord Rotterdam, which was built in 1937, and featured oval rings around the pitch, resulting in continuous stands without open corners.\n\n\n\n### Early years and the 1982 World Cup[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Ball, Phill (2003). *Morbo: The Story of Spanish Football*.

The stadium was renovated in 1993\u201394, in which the pitch was lowered by 2.5\u00a0metres (8\u00a0feet), the security gap that separated the lawn from the galleries was removed, and standing room was eliminated in favour of individual seating. A new press box, renovation of the presidential grandstand and boxes, new parking under the main grandstand and new lighting and sound systems were completed in time for the 1998\u201399 season.[1] During 1998\u201399, UEFA rated Camp Nou a five-star stadium for its services and functionalities.[39] Although popularly called Camp Nou, the stadium\u2019s official name was actually \u201cEstadi del FC Barcelona\u201d since its completion, and it was not until the 2000-01 season that club members voted to officially rename the stadium to its popular nickname.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn January 2014, Barcelona's board of directors rejected the option of building a new stadium due to financial constraints, and instead opted to remodel the Camp Nou to bring the capacity up to 105,000.[47] The project was expected to run from 2017 to early 2021, with a cost of around \u00a3495 million (\u20ac600 million), making it one of the most expensive expansions on a per-seat basis.[48][49] A refined plan was released in May 2015 showing plans to add a canopy over the stands and showing the plans for seating expansion in greater detail.[50] Construction was planned in 2019 to begin in summer 2020 and to be completed in 2024.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe project was completed one year later, when the club entrusted the construction to the building company Ingar SA. The work was supposed to last eight months, but the costs were more than four times higher than expected, reaching 288 million pesetas. Through mortgages and loans, the club managed to finish the project, borrowing heavily for several years. The club hoped to cover the cost with the sale of the land at Les Corts, but the Barcelona City Council took five years to requalify it, giving rise to a period of certain economic hardship, Finally, the head of state and of the Spanish government at the time, the dictator Francisco Franco, authorised the requalification of the land at Les Corts and put an end to the crisis of the Barcelona club.[19][20] During the course of the Camp Nou construction work, La Masia served as a workshop for making the models and a workplace for architects and builders.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** \"1950-61.

Invested in February of the following year, Mir\u00f3-Sans decided in favour of the land acquired in 1950, and the first stone of the stadium was laid on 28 March 1954.[18] A procession of several thousands of people made the journey from the Camp de Les Corts to La Masia de Can Planes, where the ceremony of laying the first stone was held, a solemn ceremony in the presence of Mir\u00f3-Sans, the head of the Civil Government of Barcelona and the archbishop of Barcelona, Gregorio Modrego.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn May 1972, the Camp Nou hosted its first European Cup Winners' Cup final between Rangers and Dynamo Moscow. Rangers won the match with a score of 3\u20132. Electronic scoreboards were installed 1975 in the stadium.[24]\n\n\nThe stadium underwent an expansion in 1980, in anticipation of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, which added boxes, VIP lounges, a new press area, new markers and the construction of the third tier, which was smaller in height than the original design by 6 metres (46.60 metres compared to the original design of 52.50 metres). The expansion of the stadium added 22,150 new seats,[25] taking the total seating capacity to 71,731, and the standing capacity was expanded by 16,500 to 49,670, taking the total stadium capacity (seated and standing combined) to 121,401.[26] Barcelona's record attendance was set on 5 March 1986 in the European Cup quarter-final against Juventus in front of 120,000 spectators, just 1,401 shy of the stadium's capacity.[27][28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
