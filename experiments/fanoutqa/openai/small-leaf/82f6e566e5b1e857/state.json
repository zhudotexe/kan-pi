Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson billed Ball as \"the new face of the Lakers.\"[53] During the 2017 NBA Summer League in Las Vegas, Ball was named the league MVP after averaging 16.3 points, 9.3 assists, 7.7 rebounds, 2.5 steals, and 1.0 blocks per game. He had two triple-doubles, the first in Vegas since 2008 and the first ever in Vegas by a rookie.[54][55] He had four games with 10 or more assists, becoming the first in league history to have more than 10 assists in more than one game; his 9.3 assist average was also a league record.[56][57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Lonzo Ball\".

He is left-handed.\n\n\nComing out of Kentucky, Fox was highly regarded among scouts for his quickness, speed, and athleticism.[35] These attributes combined make Fox one of the most dangerous players on the fast break and driving to the rim. Fox himself stated in 2018 \"If we\u2019re talking about from baseline to baseline with the ball in my hands, I\u2019m definitely the fastest person in the league.\"[36]\n\n\nFox is a high end finisher at the rim, being able to use his body control and leaping ability to finish layups and draw fouls and often using his speed and quickness to blow by defenders. Fox is considered to be a poor 3-point shooter, as during the 2019\u20132020 NBA season, Fox shot a career low 29.2% shooting percentage from three.[37]\n\n\nFox has also demonstrated good passing ability, averaging around seven assists per game.[37] Fox generates most of his assists running the pick and roll and the fast break.\n\n\nOn defense, Fox can be exploited by bigger guards because of his small frame, but can intercept passes and makes quick rotations due to his elite quickness and nearly 6-foot 7 inch wingspan.[38]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nFox was born to his parents Aaron and Lorainne Harris-Fox and has one brother named Quentin Fox. Fox goes by the nicknames \u201cFox\u201d, \u201cSwipa\u201d, and \u201cSwipa da Fox\u201d. Fox chose the number zero at Kentucky because he \u201cfears no one\u201d, giving his original number five to teammate Malik Monk.[7] According to his high school coach, Fox would come to school at 6 AM and practice in the gym every morning. Fox would sleep on the couch almost every night and play the *NBA 2K* video game series. This, according to his father, is one of the reasons he has developed into the player that he is today.[39]\n\n\nFox signed a multi-year endorsement deal with Nike prior to the 2017 NBA draft.[40]\n\n\nFox is also a fan of the *Dragon Ball Z* anime series and says that Vegeta is his favorite character.[41] In 2017, Fox sported *Dragon Ball Z* inspired Nike shoes in game.[42]\n\n\nIn February 2022, Fox was the subject of criticism after he shut down his personal NFT project \u201cSwipaTheFox\u201d, with more than $1.5 million in unpaid investment to approximately 100,000 investors. Fox explained his decision in a Twitter thread, wherein he claimed he wasn't satisfied with the quality of the project so far and was shutting it down until the end of the NBA season, but did not answer critics who demanded a return of their investment.[43][44]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Fox married Recee Caldwell at an elaborate ceremony in Malibu, California. Caldwell gave birth to their son Reign Fox on February 3, 2023.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"De'aaron Fox\". *247 Sports*. 247 Sports.
