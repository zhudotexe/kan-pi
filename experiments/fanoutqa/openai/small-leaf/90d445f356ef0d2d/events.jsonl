Lisbon agrees to allow doctors into the bank while one of Sagasta's soldiers hides and secretly defuses bombs around the entrances of the bank so special forces could easily enter. In a flashback, Berlin's wife, Tatiana, leaves him for his own son, Rafael.\n |\n| 40 | 9 | \"Lo que se habla en la cama\"\"Pillow Talk\" | Koldo Serra | Javier Gómez Santander, Álex Pina, Juan Salvador López & David Barrocal | 3 December 2021 (2021-12-03) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2 | 2 | \"Imprudencias letales\"\"Lethal Negligence\" | Miguel Ángel Vivas | Álex Pina, Esther Martínez Lobato, Javier Gómez Santander, Pablo Roa, Fernando Sancristóbal and David Barrocal | 9 May 2017 (2017-05-09) | 3.04[13] |\n| The robbers begin to print the money while Arturo Román, one of the hostages, starts making escape plans, assisted by his secretary and mistress Mónica Gaztambide, who is pregnant with his child.

In the forest, a massive manhunt begins for the Professor and Lisbon. Lisbon is discovered in the barn by farmers, which begins a Mexican Standoff. The robbers create a diversion to make the police think that they are escaping, drawing resources away from the manhunt. Meanwhile, Sierra brings Nairobi's son, Axel, in front of the bank, luring Nairobi to a window. Sierra gives the green light for a police sniper to shoot, and Nairobi is shot in the chest. As the robbers scramble to aid Nairobi, the police begin the assault. In the forest, Suárez and the Civil Guard find Lisbon and remove the farmers from the barn.

Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go. Raquel visits Ángel in the hospital, where the police arrest her. At a moral crossroads, she initially refuses to divulge the Professor's hideout, but when Colonel Prieto threatens her with several charges that would cause her to lose custody of her daughter, she relents. As the police race to the hideout, a tactical squad inside the Mint is fought off by Berlin so the rest of the robbers can escape in time, until he is shot multiple times. The remaining robbers, with the addition of Mónica, escape to the Professor's hideout minutes before the police arrive to find it empty.

The government responds by mobilizing the army, which the robbers use to provide cover and entry into the Bank. In flashbacks, the Professor recruits Palermo, real name Martín Berrote, an experienced thief and former associate to replace Berlin. The Professor and Palermo explain that their strategy for this robbery is based on *Aikido*, a martial art that uses an enemy's force to create an advantage. As the robbers enter the Bank, public sentiment rallies to their side in the form of mass government protests and riots over the illegal imprisonment of Rio, demanding that he receive a public trial.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 28 | 5 | \"5 minutos antes\"\"5 Minutes Earlier\" | Koldo Serra and Álex Rodrigo | Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador López, Emilio Díez and Luis Moya | 3 April 2020 (2020-04-03) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Raquel takes the Professor into custody and interrogates him at the villa.

Palermo, the commander in charge, is temporarily blinded by glass shrapnel in the struggle, though he retains command after Nairobi removes it. The robbers locate accomplices among the hostages who were previously planted in the Bank and go to work on opening the vault, which is rigged to flood with water once tampered with. Bogotá uses his expertise in diving and welding to overcome the lock down, granting access to the gold. In flashbacks, Berlin and Palermo explain the plan for breaking into the vault, stating that every step of the plan requires perfection to work with no room for error.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| By the Professor's promise that he will free Tokyo from the police, Rio rejoins the robbers and helps them stop Arturo's latest escape plan. Meanwhile, Raquel sets a trap for the Professor by creating a hoax that Ángel has awakened from his coma, in hopes it will lure him to the hospital to finish him off before he can identify the Professor. The Professor, skeptical of the announcement, posts a fake casting call for clowns at the hospital and dresses up like one, blending in with the crowd while confirming the hoax. Later, while Salva meets with Raquel at a cafe, she sees an orange hair from his clown wig on his jacket. She finally realises that Salva is the Professor.\n |\n| 13 | 4 | \"¿Qué hemos hecho?\"\"What Have We Done?\" | Jesús Colmenar and Alex Rodrigo | Álex Pina, Esther Martínez Lobato, Javier Gómez Santander, Pablo Roa, Fernando Sancristóbal and David Barrocal | 9 November 2017 (2017-11-09) | 1.53[13] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Thanks to Arturo's plan, 17 hostages manage to escape, seriously injuring Oslo in the process. Before his car accident, Ángel had left a voice message on Raquel's landline explaining that Salva was the one behind the heist. Raquel's mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, listens to Ángel's message, writes it down, and tries calling Raquel's phone. When Raquel does not answer, she calls Salva for him to pass along the message. The Professor believes he has no choice but to kill Raquel's mother. He goes to her home and poisons her coffee, but cannot go through with it and knocks the cup out of her hand. When she thinks it was her fault, he realizes that she has Alzheimer's disease and simply deletes the message and takes her note. Later, Raquel brings Salva along to Toledo and finds the robbers' villa, where they planned the heist.\n |\n\n\n### Part 2 (2017)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| The gang rushes to save Nairobi's life, but given the risks surrounding the surgery that they must perform on her, she pleads to be released to the police so that she can get proper care. Meanwhile, the Professor manages to escape the forest after Marseille lures the police away with a tracker they believe to be the Professor escaping. After an argument between gang members develops about the decision to perform surgery on Nairobi, Tokyo stages a coup d'état and leads the surgery with the video aid of a surgeon in Pakistan. The Professor negotiates a truce with Tamayo for 48 hours to assess Nairobi. In flashbacks, Nairobi convinces Tokyo that she ask the Professor to be the leader of the heist, but the Professor insists that since Palermo came up with the idea for the heist, he will be in charge.\n |\n| 25 | 2 | \"La boda de Berlín\"\"Berlin's Wedding\" | Javier Quintas | Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador López, Emilio Díez and Luis Moya | 3 April 2020 (2020-04-03) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| The exchange proceeds smoothly and Rio rejoins the gang. While the hostages are leaving, Arturo, wanting to see Mónica, runs into the Bank of Spain and becomes a hostage. During the reunion, the police and government intelligence team listen in on their conversations, having implanted a listening device inside Rio before releasing him. In flashbacks, the Professor instructs the team, preparing them to detect and remove these devices surgically from Rio, if the time comes. He instructs Tokyo to act normally in spite of the listening device, as he hopes to use their sexual intimacy to convince the police that the listening device is working. Privately, Rio breaks up with Tokyo, believing that she will be better off with someone else. Nairobi then surgically removes the listening device. The police manage to locate the Professor and Lisbon using a drone, forcing them to separate and try to escape on foot; the Professor camouflages himself in a tree, while Lisbon is unable and takes refuge in a barn.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThey then manage to inform the team of the breach 10 minutes before it happens, who defeat, capture, unclothe, and humiliate the breaching team by forcing them to sing \"Bella ciao\" on video.

In the Mint, Helsinki decides to euthanise his cousin Oslo, which he does so tearfully. Salva rides back to Madrid with Alberto and provokes him into a fight, knocking him out and erasing the evidence. When Alberto awakes, he arrests the Professor and brings him to jail. The Professor uses the bathroom at the prison and beats himself up to make it look like Alberto was the aggressor. He calls Raquel, who helps release him. Meanwhile, the robbers start losing hope after many hours without news from the Professor, and Tokyo begins a mutiny after becoming restless.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_w4ZKKvQyvUfVVsnyA9HlhTiF","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Though he wrote the story in 2009, Hwang couldn't find a production company to fund the idea until Netflix took an interest around 2019 as part of a drive to expand their foreign programming offerings.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_marltay8d02smOrL0zE1YZ6A","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Jesse Jackson takes an interest in the case due to the large number of black and brown victims, and he meets with Glenda, who tells him of the horrors she witnessed, including a time when an angry Dahmer served her a sandwich made with possible human remains.

In 1991, an adult Dahmer buys alcohol for 14-year old Konerak Sinthasomphone and brings him to his apartment under the guise of paying the teen for lewd photographs. Dahmer drugs the teen, then experiments by using a power drill to drill into the boy's skull. While Dahmer goes out to buy more alcohol, a woozy Konerak awakes and tries to escape but only makes it to the stairwell where Glenda and her daughter find him. Glenda is concerned about the boy's age, and calls police, but the police take Dahmer's word that the boy is an adult who is Dahmer's boyfriend and simply drank too much. The police escort Konerak back inside, and Dahmer kills him after they leave. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| British Academy Television Awards | May 14, 2023 | Best International Programme | Ryan Murphy, Ian Brennan, Alexis Martin Woodall, David McMillan, Reilly Smith, Carl Franklin\n | Won\n | [41] |\n| Hollywood Critics Association TV Awards\n | 2023 | Best Streaming Limited or Anthology Series\n | *Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story* | Pending\n | [42] |\n| Best Actor in a Streaming Limited or Anthology Series or Movie\n | Evan Peters | Pending\n |\n| Best Supporting Actor in a Streaming Limited or Anthology Series or Movie\n | Kieran Tamondong\n | Pending\n |\n| Richard Jenkins | Pending\n |\n| Best Supporting Actress in a Streaming Limited or Anthology Series or Movie\n | Niecy Nash-Betts\n | Pending\n |\n| Best Directing in a Streaming Limited or Anthology Series or Movie\n | Paris Barclay (for \"God of Forgiveness, God of Vengeance\") | Pending\n |\n| Hollywood Critics Association Creative Arts TV Awards\n | 2023 | Best Casting in a Limited Series or TV Movie\n | *Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story* | Pending\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| As a high school senior in 1977–78, Dahmer continues to show interest in animal dissection while also becoming fully aware of his sexual preference for men. After his father and mother divorce, Lionel moves in with his new girlfriend Shari and soon after Joyce moves away with Jeffrey's younger brother David. Jeffrey is left alone in the house to fend for himself. He begins drinking heavily, lifting weights, and fantasizing about having a male companion in the house. He later picks up a hitchhiker named Steven Hicks and invites him to drink beer and work out. When Steven rejects Dahmer's sexual advance and uses a gay slur, Dahmer hits him with a barbell and then strangles him to death.

He begins to seek out victims with the conscious intention of killing, beginning a cycle of bringing men to Catherine's house, drugging them, strangling them to death, and dismembering them in the cellar. The smells coming from the cellar prompt a confrontation with Catherine and Lionel. When Dahmer tells them that it is caused by his taxidermy hobby, Lionel excoriates him for not cleaning up after it adequately, leading Dahmer to reassure them that he will cease that activity. Dahmer invites Ronald Flowers Jr., a man struggling with his car, to Catherine's house in an attempt to drug and kill him. After Flowers falls unconscious in her living room, Catherine finds him and forces Jeffrey to put him on a bus. After Flowers reports this to the police, they question Dahmer and Catherine, but find no evidence to arrest him. Dahmer is later arrested after another victim, Somsack Sinthasomphone, Konerak's older brother, escapes from him. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Lionel and Shari return to the Dahmer residence after three months, surprised to hear Joyce moved out, and discovers Jeff's drinking.

At her suggestion, Dahmer goes to a state fair, where he gets drunk and is arrested for indecent exposure. He takes a job as a phlebotomist, where he steals blood bags and drinks from them.

Dahmer gets a hammer, but lets Tony go. However, when Tony returns for his keys, Dahmer kills him with the hammer. Tony's mother, Shirley contacts police when her son has not checked in and missed work. They seemingly do nothing, so she posts \"Missing Person\" signs all over Milwaukee.
