It is the second largest cosmetics company in the world after L'Or\u00e9al. The company owns a diverse portfolio of brands, including La Mer, Jo Malone London, Clinique and Tom Ford Beauty, among many more, distributed internationally through both digital commerce and retail channels.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founders Est\u00e9e and Joseph H. Lauder in 1971\nThe company began in 1946 when Est\u00e9e Lauder and her husband Joseph began producing cosmetics in New York City. They first carried only four products: Cleansing Oil, Skin Lotion, Super Rich All-purpose Creme, and Creme Pack.[3] Two years later, in 1948 they established their first department store account with Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.\n\n\nOver the next 15 years, they expanded the range and continued to sell their products in the United States. In 1960, the company started its first international account in the London department store Harrods. The following year it opened an office in Hong Kong.\n\n\nIn 1964, they introduced Aramis, a line of fragrance and grooming products for men named after an exotic Turkish root originally used as an aphrodisiac.[4] In 1967, Est\u00e9e Lauder herself was named one of ten Outstanding Women in Business in the United States by business and financial editors.[5] This was followed by a Spirit of Achievement Award from Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in 1968.[*citation needed*] In that year, the company expanded again, opening Clinique, a dermatologist-guided (Dr. Norman Orentreich), allergy-tested, fragrance-free cosmetic brand.\n\n\nEst\u00e9e Lauder's Clinique brand became the first women's cosmetic company to introduce a second line for men when, in 1976, they began a separate line called \"Skin Supplies for Men\", which continues to be sold at Clinique counters worldwide. In 1981, the company's products became available in the Soviet Union.\n\n\nIn the 1990s, brand acquisitions and licensing agreements contributed to explosive growth as the company transformed from a family-owned business to a publicly traded, family-controlled organization. The decade opened with the creation of Origins \u2013 the first wellness brand in U.S. department stores. The first licensing agreement for fragrances was with fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger in 1993, followed by Kiton,[6] an Italian fashion house (1995), and with American fashion designer Donna Karan (1997).[7]\n\n\nBrand acquisitions began with an investment in the Toronto-based MAC Cosmetics in 1994, which the company then acquired in 1998. Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, designed by the celebrated makeup artist, was acquired in 1995, as was La Mer \u2013 along with the original recipe for its supreme luxury product, Cr\u00e8me de la Mer, containing the nutrient-rich Miracle Broth. The company ventured into its first hair care and holistic beauty brand with Aveda in 1997. The fragrance house Jo Malone London was acquired in 1999.[7]\n\n\nOn November 16, 1995, the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies went public on the New York Stock Exchange at $26.00 a share ($6.50 on a post-split basis).[8]\n\n\nAcquisitions and licensing continued in the 2000s as the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies bought a majority interest in the hair salon Bumble and bumble and completed its acquisition in 2006; an exclusive global licensing agreement was signed with fashion designer Michael Kors (2003). Designer Tom Ford begins a project with the company and later an agreement was signed with him (2005) to develop and distribute fragrances and cosmetics under the Tom Ford Beauty brand.[7]\n\n\nOn July 1, 2010, the company acquired Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics, Inc., a brand created in Smashbox Studios in Culver City, California, by brothers Dean and Davis Factor (as in Max).[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)The large Est\u00e9e Lauder cosmetics counter at MYER Sydney City\n![](image)Small-medium-sized pre-2013 style counter at New Zealand retailer Farmers\nOn October 28, 2011, Aramis and Designer Fragrances, a division of the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc., and Tory Burch LLC announced the signing of a multiyear agreement for the exclusive worldwide license of the Tory Burch fragrance business. This partnership marked Tory Burch's first step into the beauty industry. The first Tory Burch fragrance products were introduced in 2013.[10]\n\n\nIn 2012, the company launched AERIN Beauty, a luxury lifestyle beauty and fragrance brand inspired by the signature style of its founder, Aerin Lauder.\n\n\nIn 2014, the company acquired two insider beauty brands, RODIN olio lusso, a skin care brand known for its \"Luxury Face Oil\", and Le Labo, a fragrance and sensory lifestyle brand. Later that year, the company also made its first investment in India by buying a minority stake in Forest Essentials, a luxury cosmetics company specializing in Ayurvedic products.[11] In 2015, the company acquired Editions de Parfums Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle, a fragrance brand, and GLAMGLOW, a Hollywood skin care brand.[12]\n\n\nIn 2016, the company acquired Becca Cosmetics, its first color cosmetic group acquisition since Smashbox in 2010.[13] In November 2016, the company made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring California-based cosmetics company Too Faced for US$1.45 billion.[14]\n\n\nIn 2019, the company acquired Dr. Jart+. Founded in Korea in 2004, Dr. Jart+ pioneered the invention of BB Cream, setting the standard for multifunctional beauty.[15]\n\n\nIn 2021, the company acquired Canadian-based Deciem Beauty Group Inc.[16] In 2022, Est\u00e9e Lauder opened a 300,000 sq ft. distribution center in Galgenen, Switzerland.[17]\n\n\nIn November 2022, the company announced it was to acquire the designer fashion house Tom Ford in a deal worth $2.8bn, with Ford remaining as creative director until at least 2023.[18]\n\n\n\n### Response to the COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies announced on August 20, 2020, a reduction in their workforce by 1,500 to 2,000 personnel worldwide, or about 3 percent of total employees. Most of the reductions will be support workers and store employees. The company also announce they would be closing approximately 10 to 15 percent of their stores, close in-store beauty counters, and focus more on digital operations.[19]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe Est\u00e9e Lauder company has many brands and Est\u00e9e Lauder is one of the brands. It has had sometimes high-profile spokesmodels, sometimes referred to simply as 'faces'. Past 'faces' for Est\u00e9e Lauder include Karen Graham, Bruce Boxleitner, Shaun Casey, Willow Bay, Paulina Porizkova, Elizabeth Hurley, Carolyn Murphy, supermodel Liya Kebede \u2013 the first African 'face' of Estee Lauder, Anja Rubik, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow. As of 2008[update] the main spokesmodel for Est\u00e9e Lauder was supermodel Hilary Rhoda. In 2010, the company added three more faces to the roster, Chinese model Liu Wen, Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls, and French model Constance Jablonski.[20]\n\n\nIn 2015, Est\u00e9e Lauder signed model Kendall Jenner to promote the brand.[21]\n\n\nIn 2017, the company announced Violette Serrat as their Global Beauty Director.[22]\n\n\nAlvin Chereskin, the founder of AC&R, was the long-time creative partner of the company.[23]\n\n\n\n## Operations and finances[edit]\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nFor fiscal year 2016, the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies achieved net sales of $11.26 billion, a 4% increase compared with $10.78 billion in the prior year. Net earnings for the year were $1.11 billion, a 2% increase compared with $1.09 billion in the previous year, and diluted net earnings per common share rose 5% to $2.96, compared with $2.82 reported in the prior year.[24] As of 2018, Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies ranked 258 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.[25]\n\n\n\n### Executive management[edit]\n\n\nLeonard A. Lauder is chairman emeritus. William P. Lauder is executive chairman. Fabrizio Freda is president and chief executive officer.[26]\n\n\n\n## Breast Cancer Awareness campaign[edit]\n\n\nIn October 1992, the Breast Cancer Awareness campaign was launched by Evelyn Lauder (Est\u00e9e's daughter-in-law) who co-created the \"Pink Ribbon\"[27] with *Self* magazine as a symbol of breast health. Since then, millions of people globally have heard the message about the importance of breast health and early detection can save lives.\nThe Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' annual Breast Cancer Awareness campaign involves all of the 19 brands that make up the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies. They collectively represent The Breast Cancer Research Foundation's first and largest corporate supporter.\n\n\nSince 1992, the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' Breast Cancer campaign has raised more than $89 Million globally for lifesaving research, education, and medical services.[28]\n\n\n\n## Environmental activism[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies pledged \u00a3100,000 ($115,453) to investigate water quality in Windermere, the largest lake in England. The company has also pledged \u00a3500,000 ($577,222) over the next five years that will be used to fund the pioneering nature restoration projects that will be carried out across multiple UK National Parks.[29]\n\n\n\n## Brands[edit]\n\n\nThe Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies brands include:[30]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Cosmetics*** AERIN Beauty\n* Bobbi Brown\n* Clinique\n* DECIEM by Brandon Truaxe\n* Dr. Jart+\n* Est\u00e9e Lauder\n* GLAMGLOW\n* La Mer\n* Lab Series\n* MAC Cosmetics\n* Origins\n* Darphin Paris\n* Smashbox\n* Too Faced[31]\n* Tom Ford Beauty\n | **Fragrance*** Aramis\n* Kilian Paris\n* Editions de Parfums Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle\n* Jo Malone London\n* Lauder (Fragrances)\n* Le Labo\n\n**Haircare**\n* Aveda\n* Bumble and bumble\n\n\n |\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's \"criticism\" or \"controversy\" section **may compromise the article's neutrality**.

The contracted company was Common Sense Natural Soap & Bodycare, owned by a group led by cult leader Yoneq Gene Spriggs. Estee Lauder said it immediately moved to terminate the contract with the manufacturer it had been in business with for 5 years, stating it was totally unaware prior to the initial inspection.[34]\n\n\n\n### Animal testing[edit]\n\n\nThe Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies perform non-animal and human volunteer testing to assess product safety and efficacy. Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies product goes through animal testing where required by law by its country government. The Chinese government requires testing on animals for many cosmetic products.[35] This causes controversy for smaller brands that are \"cruelty free\" but were acquired by Est\u00e9e Lauder.[36]\n\n\n\n### Boycott and anti-boycott[edit]\n\n\n![](image)QUIT activists protesting Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, 2004.\nSince at least February 2001, Est\u00e9e Lauder and its brands have been the target of a boycott campaign led by pro-Palestine activists who have targeted the corporation because of the pro-Israel activities of Ronald Lauder.[37][38] In June 2003, the San Francisco-based Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) took up the boycott with their \"Est\u00e9e Slaughter\" campaign.[39] The boycott has generated an anti-boycott campaign by supporters of Israel.[40]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** \"The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. 2022 Annual Form 10-K Report\" (PDF). *elcompanies.com*.

Before the sale of Pringles to Kellogg's, its product portfolio also included food, snacks, and beverages.[3] P&G is incorporated in Ohio.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the fiscal year 2018, Procter & Gamble reported earnings of US$9.750 billion, with an annual revenue of US$66.832 billion, an increase of 2.7% over the previous fiscal cycle. Procter & Gamble's Shares traded at over $86 per share in 2017, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$221.5 billion in October 2018.[38] Procter & Gamble ranked No. 42 on the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe company moved into other countries, both in terms of manufacturing and product sales, becoming an international corporation with its 1930 acquisition of the Thomas Hedley Co.,[9] based in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. After this acquisition, Procter & Gamble had their UK Headquarters at 'Hedley House' in Newcastle upon Tyne, until quite recently, when they moved to The Heights, Brooklands. Numerous new products and brand names were introduced over time, and Procter & Gamble began branching out into new areas. The company introduced Tide laundry detergent in 1946[12] and Prell shampoo in 1947.[13] In 1955, Procter & Gamble began selling the first toothpaste to contain fluoride, known as Crest.[9] Branching out once again in 1957, the company purchased Charmin paper mills and began manufacturing toilet paper and other tissue paper products. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Kominicki, John, \"James Gamble's Candles and Soap Lit Up Profit: Do It Right: He Helped Put P&G on an Ethical Path to Top\", Los Angeles: *Investor's Business Daily*, March 6, 2015, p.

In addition to the increased profits experienced during the war, the military contracts introduced soldiers from all over the country to Procter & Gamble's products.\n\n\nIn the 1880s, Procter & Gamble began to market a new product, an inexpensive soap that floated in water.[9] The company called the soap Ivory.[9] William Arnett Procter, William Procter's grandson, began a profit-sharing program for the company's workforce in 1887. By giving the workers a stake in the company, he correctly assumed that they would be less likely to go on strike.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nProcter & Gamble acquired a number of other companies that diversified its product line and significantly increased profits. These acquisitions included Folgers Coffee, Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals (the makers of Pepto-Bismol), Richardson-Vicks, Noxell (Noxzema), Shulton's Old Spice, Max Factor, the Iams Company, and Pantene, among others. In 1994, the company made headlines for big losses resulting from leveraged positions in interest rate derivatives, and subsequently sued Bankers Trust for fraud; this placed their management in the unusual position of testifying in court that they had entered into transactions that they were not capable of understanding. In 1996, P&G again made headlines when the Food and Drug Administration approved a new product developed by the company, Olestra. Also known by its brand name 'Olean', Olestra is a lower-calorie substitute for fat in cooking potato chips and other snacks.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe company began to build factories in other locations in the United States because the demand for products had outgrown the capacity of the Cincinnati facilities. The company's leaders began to diversify its products as well, and in 1911 the company began producing Crisco, a shortening made of vegetable oils rather than animal fats.[9]\n\n\nBeginning in the 1880s, P&G advertised its wares in full-page advertisements in many general-interest magazines. By 1921, it had become a major international corporation with a diversified line of soaps, toiletries, and food products; in that year, its annual advertising budget reached $1 million. \nIn the 1920s, P&G advertised its products on the new medium of radio and, from 1932 forward, was one of the biggest sponsors of daytime serials, which soon acquired the nickname of *soap operas*.[10] In the television era, P&G sponsored and produced some twenty soap operas across six decades before the last of its shows ended in 2010.[11]\n\n\n\n### International expansion[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican multinational consumer goods corporation\n\n\"P&G\" redirects here.

P&G was also recognized as the most desirable FMCG business to work for in Africa.[58]\n\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, P&G was recognized as one of *Forbes* World's Most Reputable Companies.[59][60]\n\n\n\n### Brands[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see list of Procter & Gamble brands.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* + Baby Care\n\t+ Fabric Care\n\t+ Family Care\n\t+ Feminine Care\n\t+ Grooming\n\t+ Hair Care\n\t+ Home Care\n\t+ Oral Care\n\t+ Personal Health Care\n\t+ Skin and Personal Care\n* Selling and Market Organizations\n\t+ Asia Pacific, India, the Middle East and Africa (AMA)\n\t+ Europe\n\t+ Greater China\n\t+ Latin America\n\t+ North America\n\n### Management and staff[edit]\n\n\n**Board of Directors**\n\n\nThe board of directors of Procter & Gamble currently has 12 members.[46]\n\n\n\n* B.

P&G agreed to sell its SpinBrush battery-operated electric toothbrush business to Church & Dwight,[19] and Gillette's Rembrandt toothpaste line to Johnson & Johnson.[20] The deodorant brands Right Guard, Soft and Dri, and Dry Idea were sold to Dial Corporation.[21] In 2001, Liquid Paper and Gillette's stationery division, Paper Mate, were sold to Newell Rubbermaid.

Since then there is one class of shares.[106]\n\n\n\n### Senior management[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Alan Jope succeeded Paul Polman as the chief executive officer.[107] The chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly,[108] is executive director. Jope will be proposed as joint executive director at Unilever's 2019 AGM.[109]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** Manuel Hensmans; Gerry Johnson; George Yip (2013). *Strategic Transformation: Changing While Winning*.

Its product categories consist of: skin care, makeup, body care, hair care, and fragrances. The company is one of the oldest cosmetic companies in the world and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2022.[4][5] It is the largest cosmetic firm in Japan and the fifth largest cosmetic company in the world.[6] In Japan, Shiseido is available at cosmetic counters at selected department stores and most pharmacies. The company owns numerous brands and subsidiaries worldwide, in addition to its founding label. The company is headquartered in Tokyo, and is traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where it is a constituent of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Large70 indices.\n\n\n\n\n## Company History[edit]\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\nArinobu Fukuhara, former head pharmacist to the Imperial Japanese Navy, established the Shiseido Pharmacy in 1872. After a visit to the United States and Europe, Arinobu added a soda fountain to the store. This later grew into the Shiseido Parlor restaurant business, and eventually led to the introduction of ice cream in Japan. The name *Shiseido* derives from a Chinese expression meaning \"praise the virtues of the earth which nurtures new life and brings forth significant values\".[7][8][9]\n\n\nArinobu passed on his company to his son, Shinzo Fukuhara, who became the company's second president in 1913. After Shinzo's experience traveling to Europe and the United States, he became interested in advertising as a large selling point for Shiseido which lead him to dedicate extensive resources to the company's design, much of which can be seen from product packaging and magazines from this time.[10]\n\n\n\n### Expansion[edit]\n\n\nIn 1917, Shiseido introduced Rainbow Face Powder. This was a face powder with seven colors in a period when white face powders were the norm in Japan.[11] In 1923, the company began expanding its store-base; it now[*timeframe?*] has approximately 25,000 outlets. The company was incorporated as a *kabushiki gaisha* (Japanese joint-stock company) in 1927.[12] In 2017, Shiseido acquired AI and AR developer Giran to get ahead in the tech space. Shisheido plans to use Giaran\u2019s beauty simulation technology to boost its digital sales.[13][14]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th Century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1916, Shiseido transitioned from using historical images of Japanese female beauty to more Western ideals of beauty. The more contemporary images showed women with hair swept up rather than cascading back and incorporated trendy art nouveau style block scripts.[10] This shift in imagery coincided with increasing Western influence in Japan, allowing Shiseido to capitalize on this cultural change.[10]\n\n\nThe Ginza district burned during the Kanto Earthquake of 1923. This incident and the great depression in the 1930s, caused a decrease in sales of Shiseido. Shiseido partnered with stores to form the Shiseido Cosmetics Chain Store System. Therefore, consumers could rest assured that they could purchase Shiseido products at the same price at any store. In 1932, the representative Shiseido brand of top class cosmetic products of the time, De Luxe, was born. Following the outbreak of World War II, the De Luxe brand was considered an extravagance and production ceased.[15] However, it was re-launched in 1951, when the economy began to recover. Shiseido started to expand its cosmetics markets to the international market in the 1950s to 1980s.[16]\n\n\n\n### Reformation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Shiseido sold its personal care business to a company held by British equity firm CVC Capital Partners, Shiseido also transferred all of its domestic personal care businesses to its Fine Today Shiseido subsidiary and was sold to CVC after the completion in July 2021.[17][18]\n\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\n#### Luxury ordinances[edit]\n\n\nA major concern in Japan during the Second World War was wasteful consumption of luxury products. This led to the imposition of luxury ordinances against goods explicitly tailored to luxury consumption. Due to these concerns, Shiseido emphasized the health benefits, high quality (leading to a maximizing of efficacy) and patriotic national production of their cosmetic products. Since Shiseido did not want to tarnish their deluxe brand image their designs and advertisements continued to incorporate highly stylized luxurious motifs. Despite an adherence to these motifs, Shiseido advertisements explicitly emphasized the utilitarian aspects of their products over their luxury, for instance toothpaste was endorsed for keeping teeth and gums healthy (rather than for making them beautifully white).[10]\n\n\n\n### Company magazines[edit]\n\n\nThe company began publishing company magazines in 1924, with *Shiseido Monthly (Shiseido Geppo*), which contained product advertisements and advice about cosmetics and fashion. *Shiseido Monthly* was replaced in 1933, with *The Shiseido Graph* (*Shiseido Gurafu*), and then renamed to *Hanatsubaki* in 1937.[19] *Shiseido Monthly* and *The Shiseido Graph* featured photographs by Shinzo Fukuhara, the company's second president and a well-known photographer.[10]\n\n\nShiseido's public relations magazines are aimed at \u201cinspiring a life of beauty and culture,\u201d following the company's stated corporate ideal.[19]\n\n\n\n## International expansion[edit]\n\n\nIn 1957, Shiseido began sales in Taiwan, closely followed by Singapore and Hong Kong. In 1962, Shiseido expanded to Hawaii; in 1965, it established Shiseido Cosmetics America. European sales began with Italy in 1968, Oceania with New Zealand in 1971 and former USSR in 1992 with Russia.[20]\n\n\nIn 1985, Shiseido was the first company to produce sodium hyaluronate (hyaluronic acid/hyaluronan) from non-animal origin sources.[21]\n\n\n\n## Finances and operations[edit]\n\n\nIn the first quarter of 2013, Shiseido made a profit of \u00a52.66 billion (US$26.87 million) on sales of \u00a5162.36bn (US$1.64bn).[22] On 15 July 2013, Shiseido announced it was opening a wholly owned subsidiary in India.[23] On 20 February 2014, Shiseido agreed to sell its Carita and Decl\u00e9or brands to L\u2019Or\u00e9al for \u20ac227.5M (US$312.93M). This sale resulted in Shiseido showing profits despite running into losses.[24]\n\n\nIn November 2023, Shiseido cut their profit forecast and suffered a 14% decline in stock price, the largest drop in a single day since October 2008. Shiseido cited dropping demand in the Chinese market after the Japanese government approved releasing radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi reactor into the Pacific Ocean. This decision drove Chinese customers to boycott or avoid Japanese cosmetics brands.[25]\n\n\n\n## Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\nA partial list of Shiseido's wholly owned brands and subsidiaries, as well as exclusive licensing agreements.[26]\n\n\n\n### Prestige division[edit]\n\n\n* BAUM\n* BENEFIQUE\n* Cl\u00e9 de Peau Beaut\u00e9\n* Drunk Elephant\n* EFFECTIM\n* IPSA\n* ISSEY MIYAKE\n* NARS\n* narciso rodriguez\n* Serge Lutens\n* Shiseido\n* THE GINZA\n* Tory Burch\n* Ul\u00e9\n\n### Premium division[edit]\n\n\n* ANESSA\n* AQUA LABEL\n* AUPRES\n* d program\n* ELIXIR\n* GRACY\n* HAKU\n* INTEGRATE\n* MAJOLICA MAJORCA\n* MAQuillAGE\n* PRIOR\n* REVITAL\n* SIDEKICK\n* URARA\n\n### Inner Beauty division[edit]\n\n\n* INRYU\n* The Collagen\n\n### Life Quality Beauty division[edit]\n\n\n* Perfect Cover\n\n## Acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nOn January 18, 2017, Shiseido acquired Palo Alto, California-based, digital tech company MATCHCo, a startup described by co-founder and former professional skateboarder, Andy Howell, as \"AI for beauty.\"[27] The MATCHCo technology was rebranded by Shiseido as MADE-2-FIT, a bareMinerals iPhone app which offered \"precise skin tone analysis via a set of simple user scans, with the help of a virtual makeup artist with voice guidance.\"[27] To supplement MatchCo., Shiseido later acquired Giaran Inc., a data driven company, in November, 2017.[28]\n\n\nIn January 2018, the company acquired all of the assets of Olivo Laboratories.[29]\n\n\n\n## Make-up[edit]\n\n\nShiseido produces a line of cosmetics simply called \"The Makeup\" that provide a full range of products including: lip products, powder eye shadows, eye liner pencils, mascara, fluid and compact foundations, concealers, and powder blushes. Their hydro powder eye shadows which have a creamy texture are among *Allure* magazine's top beauty picks.[30]\n\n\nShiseido stepped into the world of cosmetics with the introduction of Eudermine in 1897, and established the Cosmetics Division and a store selling cosmetics in 1916. With the birth of new cosmetics, the\u00a0definition of makeup started to alter in the 1920s. The cosmetics were not used exclusively by women. Men started to use makeup to rebuild their image. Shiseido's scented hair tonics were among their most popular early cosmetics for both men and women, fueled by a reaction to Western distaste for less fragrant traditional hair oil products.[10] Shiseido also began to produce floral perfumes which contributed to the brand's \"De Luxe\" and \"rich\u201d aesthetic.[10]\n\n\nMeanwhile, modern beauty methods became a popular beauty topic in advertisements, newspaper columns and magazines in the late 1920s, to early 1930s. At that time, cosmetic consumers focused on the selection of the makeup and their uses. The single makeup method of painting the face white was considered outdated.[31] The beauty consumers liked to apply up to seven different colors of face powder including \u2018\u2019 white, yellow, flesh, rose, peony, green and purple\u2019\u2019 to match their skin tone.[32] In order to explore more potential consumers, Shiseido trained beauty advisers, who demonstrated and illustrated the uses of the cosmetics on the on-site demonstration briefing.\n\n\n\n## Animal testing[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Shiseido's subsidiary company, NARS Cosmetics, announced it was going to start testing their products on animals. In defense of its decision, the company stated \"We have decided to make NARS available in China because we feel it is important to bring our vision of beauty and artistry to fans in the region. Nars does not test on animals or ask others to do so on our behalf, except where required by law\".[33]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Weil, Jennifer (24 December 2013). \"Shiseido Names New President and CEO\".
