During the 1990s, birth rate increased by more than 100,000 children per year while death rates fell and immigration surged. In the early 2000s, birth rate declined as immigration increased further, with the context of unrest in the Middle East, upholding steady population growth.[10][11]\n\n\n\n### Population projections[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStatistics Sweden projects a Swedish population of 12.6 million in 2070.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Swedish population pyramid, 1860–2020\n\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review.[6]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 4 minutes\n* One death every 6 minutes\n* Net gain of one person every 8 minutes\n* One net migrant every 14 minutes\n\n\n### Cities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of cities in Sweden by population\n\nSweden has 17 cities with a population of over 100,000 people.

Sweden's population was 10,538,026 (Apr 2023), making it the 15th-most populous country in Europe after Czech Republic, the 10th-most populous member state of the European Union, and the 87th-most populous country in the world. The total fertility rate was rated at 1.66 in 2020,[1] which is far below the replacement rate of 2.1.\n\n\nThe population exceeded 10 million for the first time on Friday, 20 January 2017.[2][3] The three largest cities are Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. Sweden's population has become much more ethnically, religiously and linguistically diverse over the past 70 years as a result of immigration. Every fourth (24.9%) resident in the country has a foreign background and every third (32.3%) has at least one parent born abroad. The most common foreign ancestry is Finnish.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 7 | Västerås | Västmanland | 150,564 | 169,200 | 17 | Gävle | Gävleborg | 100,825 | 107,500\n |\n| 8 | Helsingborg | Skåne | 143,671 | 321,500 | 18 | Halmstad | Halland | 99,932 | 119,300\n |\n| 9 | Norrköping | Östergötland | 140,991 | 149,600 | 19 | Sundsvall | Västernorrland | 98,837 | 115,300\n |\n| 10 | Jönköping | Jönköping | 137,863 | 156,700 | 20 | Södertälje | Stockholm | 96,254 | 158,300\n |\n\n### Statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Estimated birth rate (blue) and death rate in Sweden for the period of 1735 to 2000.

The capital city Stockholm has a municipal population of about 950,000 (with 1.5 million in the urban area and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area). The second- and third-largest cities are Gothenburg and Malmö. Greater Gothenburg counts just over a million inhabitants and the same goes for the western part of Scania, along the Öresund. The Öresund Region, the Danish-Swedish cross-border region around the Öresund that Malmö is part of, has a population of 4 million. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** Wirén, Arne. 6 September 2005. \"Fattighjons-Sverige hotar” Metro.

In each constituent nation, the population of England was 49,449,700, Scotland had a population of 5,064,200, Wales had a population of 2,910,200 and Northern Ireland a population of 1,689,300.[5] Increased international migration which began to rapidly increase at the end of the 20th century also has brought increased ethnic heterogenization to the British population, not only in ethnicity and race, but also in country of birth. In 2001, the White British population was registered to be 88.52% of the total population, but by 2011, this proportion of the population had dropped to 81.88%, with other ethnic groups either rising by 50% of their respective total population in 2001 or doubling entirely.\n\n\nSuch rapid immigration growth boosted population growth in the United Kingdom.

Over the same period, the population of England is projected to grow by 5.9%; for Wales, this figure is 3.1%, while for Scotland and Northern Ireland the figures are 3.2% and 4.2% respectively.

The GAD produced population projections every year from 1955 to 1979 and then switched it to every 2 years up to 1991. The Office for National Statistics took control of producing population projections for the country in 2006.[35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Population pyramid from 1950 to 2022\n![](image)Population pyramid projections of the United Kingdom from 2023 up to 2100\nInterlinked with fertility and mortality, The age structure of the United Kingdom has varied with how rates of fertility and mortality have changed throughout the country's history. Due to the transition to an industrialised society, the United Kingdom has also undergone a 'demographic transition': that is to say, that it has gone from a high birth rate, high mortality rate society to a low birth rate, low mortality rate society over the space of two centuries.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![England](image) England\n* ![Wales](image)\n\n![Wales](image) Wales\n* ![Scotland](image)\n\n![Scotland](image) Scotland\n* ![Northern Ireland](image)\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\n\nEstimates and census figures of the growth of the ethnic minority population in the United Kingdom[154][fn 5]\n| Ethnic minority\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1939\\*[155] | 1951\\*\n | 1961\\*\n | 1971\\*\n | 1981\\*\n | 1986\\*\n | 1991\n | 1993\\*\n | 1998\\*\n | 2000\\*\n | 2001\n | 2011\n |\n| Number\n | 7,000\n | 50,000\n | 400,000\n | 1,370,000\n | 2,090,000\n | 2,470,000\n | 3,015,050\n | 3,200,000\n | 3,700,000\n | 4,040,000\n | 4,635,296\n | 8,108,626\n |\n| %\n | –\n | 0.1%\n | 0.8%\n | 2.5%\n | 3.9%\n | 4.5%\n | 5.5%\n | 5.7%\n | 6.5%\n | 7.1%\n | 7.88%\n | 12.83%\n |\n\n\n**Geographic distribution**\n\n* Distribution of ethnic groups within the United Kingdom in the 2011 census\n* ![White: Total (87.12%)](image)\n\nWhite: Total (87.12%)\n* ![White: British (81.5%)[fn 6]](image)\n\nWhite: British (81.5%)[fn 6]\n* ![White: Irish (0.95%)[fn 7]](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"2011 rural/urban classification – Office for National Statistics\". *www.ons.gov.uk*.
