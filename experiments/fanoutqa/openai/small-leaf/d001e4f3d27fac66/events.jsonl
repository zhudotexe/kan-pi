Along with Japanese, these languages are part of the Japonic language family, but they are separate languages,[*citation needed*] and are not mutually intelligible with Japanese, or with each other. All of the spoken Ryukyuan languages are classified by UNESCO as endangered.\n\n\nIn Hokkaidō, there is the Ainu language, which is spoken by the Ainu people, who are the indigenous people of the island. The Ainu languages, of which Hokkaidō Ainu is the only extant variety, are isolated and do not fall under any language family. Ever since the Meiji period, Japanese has become widely used among the Ainu people and consequently Ainu languages have been classified critically endangered by UNESCO.[2]\n\n\nIn addition, languages such as Orok, Evenki and Nivkh spoken in formerly Japanese controlled southern Sakhalin are becoming more and more endangered. After the Soviet Union took control of the region, speakers of these languages and their descendants migrated to mainland Japan and still exist in small numbers.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nNot until shortly after the turn of the second century did indications of language appear in Chinese texts. Chinese characters were adopted and records of spoken language were made in Japan. Hiragana and Katakana characters were incorporated as a relatively accurate way to represent the sounds of Chinese characters.\n\n\n\n### Ryūkyūan languages[edit]\n\n\nChinese characters were first introduced to Ryūkyūan languages shortly into the 13th-century. Details concerning the language before then are not well known. 14th-century records indicate that gifts from Ryūkyū Islands to China used Hiragana, which indicates that these languages were tied to Mainland Japanese at the time.\n\n\n\n### Ainu languages[edit]\n\n\nHistory records that people in Hokkaidō, Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands spoke Ainu languages,[*citation needed*] but there are also places in and around Tōhoku whose names derive from Ainu languages. According to 16th-century records, Ainu languages had no written form.[*citation needed*] Only from the 19th-century did the Ainu languages begin to use Katakana.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Orok language[edit]\n\n\nRecords show that the Orok language was spoken during the latter part of the Edo period in Hokkaidō,[*dubious – discuss*] Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands;[*dubious – discuss*] however, there are only a few speakers still in existence.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Nivkh language[edit]\n\n\nLike Orok, the Nivkh language was spoken in Sakhalin and later in Hokkaidō,[*citation needed*] and the Kuril Islands.[*dubious – discuss*] It is unknown whether speakers of Nivkh still remain in Japan.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### European languages[edit]\n\n\nSince the Middle Ages, owing to visits from Europeans, Japanese has adopted a number of foreign words.\n\n\nPost-1543 Portuguese was the initial contact language with Europeans, but this was later replaced by Dutch after the Japanese removed Portuguese people from the country.[3] The Japanese government conducted negotiations with Western authorities in Dutch until around 1870.[4] Since then English became the primary language of interaction with Western countries.\n\n\n\n## Language classifications[edit]\n\n\nThe oral languages spoken by the native peoples of the insular country of Japan at present and during recorded history belong to either of two primary phyla of human language:\n\n\n\n* Japonic languages\n\t+ Japanese language (See also Japanese dialects)\n\t\t- Hachijō Japanese\n\t\t- Eastern Japanese\n\t\t- Western Japanese\n\t\t- Kyūshū Japanese\n\t+ Ryūkyūan languages\n\t\t- Northern Ryūkyūan languages\n\t\t\t* Amami\n\t\t\t* Kunigami\n\t\t\t* Okinawa\n\t\t- Southern Ryūkyūan languages\n\t\t\t* Miyako\n\t\t\t* Yaeyama\n\t\t\t* Yonaguni\n* Ainu languages\n\t+ Hokkaidō Ainu language\n\t+ Sakhalin Ainu language (extinct)\n\t+ Kuril Ainu language (extinct)\n\n\nIn addition to these two indigenous language families, there is Japanese Sign Language, as well as significant minorities of ethnic Koreans and Chinese, who make up respectively about 0.5% and 0.4% of the country's population and many of whom continue to speak their ethnic language in private (see Zainichi Korean). There is also a notable history of use of *Kanbun* (Classical Chinese) as a language of literature and diplomacy in Japan, similar to the status of the Latin language in medieval Europe, which has left an indelible mark on the vocabulary of the Japanese language. *Kanbun* is a mandatory subject in the curricula of most Japanese secondary schools.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Demographics of Japan\n* Japanese people\n\t+ Yamato people\n\t+ Ryukyuan people\n\t+ Ainu people\n* Koreans in Japan\n* Chinese in Japan\n* Brazilians in Japan\n* Classical Chinese as a literary language of Japan\n* East Asian languages\n* Deafness in Japan\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"参議院法制局\".\n2. **^** Ertl, John, ed.

All federal legislation is enacted bilingually. Provincially, only in New Brunswick are both English and French official to the same extent.

However, the reserve system created more permanent stationary bands, which have generally selected only one of their various ancestral languages to try to preserve in the face of increasing Anglicization, Francization,[65] or Amslanization (the process by which American Sign Language replaces local sign languages).[66] In addition, the residential school system attempted to institutionally exterminate languages and cultures from coast to coast to coast. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOverview of the languages spoken in Canada\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article contains **too many charts, tables, or data**.

In Puerto Rico both English and Spanish are official, although Spanish has been declared the principal official language. The school system and the government operate almost entirely in Spanish, but federal law requires the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico to use English,[31] like the rest of the federal court system. Guam recognizes English and Chamorro. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, English is the only official language. In American Samoa, both English and Samoan are officially recognized; English is common but Samoan is also seen in some official communications. In the Northern Mariana Islands, English, Chamorro, and Carolinian are official.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn New Mexico, although the state constitution does not specify an official language, laws are published in English and Spanish, and government materials and services are legally required (by Act) to be made accessible to speakers of both languages as well as Navajo and various Pueblo languages. New Mexico also has its own dialect of Spanish, which differs from Spanish spoken in the rest of Latin America.\n\n\nAlgonquian, Cherokee, and Sioux are among many other Native American languages which are official or co-official on many U.S. Indian reservations and Pueblos. In Oklahoma before statehood in 1907, territory officials debated whether or not to have Cherokee, Choctaw, and Muscogee languages as co-official, but the idea never gained ground.

In October 2018, Louisiana became the first U.S. state to join the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie.[78]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| French | * Louisiana\n* Métis\n* Missouri\n* Muskrat\n* New England\n |\n| German | * Pennsylvania Dutch\n* Hutterite\n* Plautdietsch\n* Bernese\n* Alsatian\n* Texas\n |\n| Spanish | * Caló (Chicano)\n* Isleño\n* New Mexican\n* Puerto Rican\n* Sabine River\n |\n| Creole and mixed languages | * Gullah\n* Louisiana Creole\n* Spanglish\n* Angloromani\n |\n\n |\n| Manual settlerlanguages | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Francosign | * American Sign Language\n* Black American Sign Language\n* Protactile\n* Puerto Rican Sign Language\n |\n| BANZSL | * Samoan Sign Language\n |\n| *Kentish* | * *Martha's Vineyard Sign Language*\n |\n| Isolates | * *Sandy River Valley Sign Language*\n* *Henniker Sign Language*\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Articles Related to Languages of the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nLanguages of the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| Languages in *italics* are extinct.\n |\n| English | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBelow is an estimate of Native American languages \"spoken at home\" in the United States (American Community Survey 2006–2008).[117] This is not an exhaustive list of Native American languages in the US. Because the distinction between dialect and language is not always clear, multiple dialects of varying mutual intelligibility may be classified as a single language, while a group of effectively identical dialects may be classified separately for historical or cultural reasons. Languages included here may be classified as \"extinct\" (having no living native speakers), but many extinct or moribund Native American languages are the subjects of ongoing language revitalization efforts; other extinct languages undergoing revitalization might not be listed here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Attested historical ranges of sign languages of the US and Canada excluding ASL and LSQ.  \n |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Plains Sign Talk\n Inuiuuk (ᐃᓄᐃᐆᒃ)\n Hawai'i Sign Language\n Maritime Sign Language\n | *Plateau Sign Language*\n *Martha's Vineyard Sign Language*\n *Henniker Sign Language*\n *Sandy River Valley Sign Language*\n |\n\nSee also: Native American sign languages\n\nAlongside the numerous and varied oral languages, the United States also boasts several sign languages.

Spanish is spoken by approximately 35 million people.[14] The United States has the world's fourth largest Spanish-speaking population, outnumbered only by Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina; other estimates[*which?*] put the United States at over 50 million, second only to Mexico. Throughout the Southwestern United States and Puerto Rico, long-established Spanish-speaking communities coexist with large numbers of more recent Hispanophone immigrants. Although many new Latin American immigrants are less than fluent in English, nearly all second-generation Hispanic Americans speak English fluently, while only about half still speak Spanish.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n86. **^** Thomas A.

The largest French-speaking communities in the United States reside in Northeast Maine; Hollywood and Miami, Florida; New York City;[*citation needed*] certain areas of rural Louisiana; and small minorities in Vermont and New Hampshire. Many of the New England communities are connected to the dialect found across the border in Quebec or New Brunswick. More than 13 million Americans possess primary French heritage, but only 2 million speak French, or any regional creoles and variations language at home.
