          "content": "<document>\n<title>List of highest-grossing films</title>\n<fragment>\nDespite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation, several attempts have been made. Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses,[31] and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also affect the calculations, both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. *Gone with the Wind*\u2014first released in 1939\u2014is generally considered to be the most successful film, with *Guinness World Records* in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4\u00a0billion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile inflation has eroded the achievements of most films from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInfInflation adjustment is carried out using the Consumer price index for advanced economies published by the International Monetary Fund.[36] The index is uniformly applied to the grosses in the chart published by *Guinness World Records* in 2014, beginning with the 2014 index. The figures in the above chart take into account inflation that occurred in 2014, and in every available year since then, through 2022.\n\n\nA1The adjusted gross for *Avatar* includes revenue from the original release and all four reissues. The original release and 2010 Special Edition grosses are adjusted from the Guinness base year, whilst the 2020 and 2021 grosses are adjusted from the 2021 index and the 2022 gross from 2022.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nT*Guinness*' adjusted total for *Titanic* only increased by $102,000,000 between the 2012 (published in 2011) and 2015 editions, a rise of 4.2% shared by the other adjusted totals in the chart, and omitted the gross from a 3D re-release in 2012.[35][38] This chart incorporates the gross of $343,550,770 from the reissue and adjusts it from the 2013 index.[39] *Titanic* grossed a further $762,994 during limited re-releases in 2017 and 2020, but this sum is not represented in the adjusted total.[40]\n\n\nAEThe gross for *Avengers: Endgame* is adjusted from the 2020 index.\n\n\nTFAThe gross for *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* is adjusted from the 2016 index.\n\n## High-grossing films by year[edit]\n\n\nGlossary: Distributor rentals\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2\u00a0billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHigh-grossing films by year of release[47][48][49]\n| Year\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Budget\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915 | *The Birth of a Nation* | $50,000,000\u2013100,000,000$20,000,000+R ($5,200,000)R | $110,000 | [# 84][# 85][# 86] |\n| 1916 | *Intolerance* | $1,750,000R IN | $385,907 | [50][51] |\n| 1917 | *Cleopatra* | $500,000\\*R | $300,000 | [# 87][# 88] |\n| 1918 | *Mickey* | $8,000,000 | $250,000 | [# 89] |\n| 1919 | *The Miracle Man* | $3,000,000R | $120,000 | [# 90] |\n| 1920 | *Way Down East* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 91][# 92] |\n| 1921 | *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $600,000\u2013800,000 | [# 93] |\n| 1922 | *Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood* | $2,500,000R | $930,042.78 | [# 94][# 95] |\n| 1923 | *The Covered Wagon* | $5,000,000R | $800,000 | [# 96][# 97] |\n| 1924 | *The Sea Hawk* | $3,000,000R | $700,000 | [# 96] |\n| 1925 | *The Big Parade* | $18,000,000\u201322,000,000R  ($6,131,000)R | $382,000 | [# 98][# 99][# 100] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 \u2021 | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 \u2021 |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n\u2021Includes revenue from re-releases.

However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt least eleven films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since *The Birth of a Nation* assumed the top spot in 1915. Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. **^** Robertson, Patrick (1991). *Guinness Book of Movie Facts and Feats* (4\u00a0ed.).

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Gray, Brandon. \"'Avatar' Claims Highest Gross of All Time\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses,[31] and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also affect the calculations, both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. *Gone with the Wind*\u2014first released in 1939\u2014is generally considered to be the most successful film, with *Guinness World Records* in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4\u00a0billion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nT*Guinness*' adjusted total for *Titanic* only increased by $102,000,000 between the 2012 (published in 2011) and 2015 editions, a rise of 4.2% shared by the other adjusted totals in the chart, and omitted the gross from a 3D re-release in 2012.[35][38] This chart incorporates the gross of $343,550,770 from the reissue and adjusts it from the 2013 index.[39] *Titanic* grossed a further $762,994 during limited re-releases in 2017 and 2020, but this sum is not represented in the adjusted total.[40]\n\n\nAEThe gross for *Avengers: Endgame* is adjusted from the 2020 index.\n\n\nTFAThe gross for *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* is adjusted from the 2016 index.\n\n## High-grossing films by year[edit]\n\n\nGlossary: Distributor rentals\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile inflation has eroded the achievements of most films from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInfInflation adjustment is carried out using the Consumer price index for advanced economies published by the International Monetary Fund.[36] The index is uniformly applied to the grosses in the chart published by *Guinness World Records* in 2014, beginning with the 2014 index. The figures in the above chart take into account inflation that occurred in 2014, and in every available year since then, through 2022.\n\n\nA1The adjusted gross for *Avatar* includes revenue from the original release and all four reissues. The original release and 2010 Special Edition grosses are adjusted from the Guinness base year, whilst the 2020 and 2021 grosses are adjusted from the 2021 index and the 2022 gross from 2022.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2\u00a0billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 \u2021 | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 \u2021 |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n\u2021Includes revenue from re-releases.

However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Gone with the Wind* is likewise represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939\u20131942 release (roadshow/\u200bgeneral release/\u200bsecond-run)[86] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to *The Sound of Music* in 1966; its 1971 entry\u2014after it took back the record\u2014includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. *The Godfather* was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and *Jaws* was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. *The Sound of Music*, *The Godfather*, *Jaws*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Titanic* increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013, and 2012, respectively, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of the highest-grossing film record\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt least eleven films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since *The Birth of a Nation* assumed the top spot in 1915. Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSteven Spielberg is the most represented director on the chart, with six films to his credit, occupying the top spot in 1975, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1989 and 1993. Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. **^** Robertson, Patrick (1991). *Guinness Book of Movie Facts and Feats* (4\u00a0ed.).

Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause of release schedules\u2014especially in the case of films released towards the end of the year\u2014and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nF8In the case of *The Fate of the Furious* the gross is from an archived version of Box Office Mojo, after irregularities were discovered in the current figure. Ongoing weekly drops in the totals for several countries\u2014Argentina being the worst affected\u2014led to a drop in the overall worldwide total.[19] In view of what appears to be an aberration in the source, a previous figure is provided.\n\n\nRK*The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* saw its original gross corrected in early 2020. The result of this correction is that *Spider-Man: Far From Home*, *Captain Marvel* and *Transformers: Dark of the Moon* all peaked one place lower than shown in the accompanying source.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe measuring system for gauging a film's success is based on unadjusted grosses, mainly because historically this is the way it has always been done because of the practices of the film industry: the box-office receipts are compiled by theaters and relayed to the distributor, which in turn releases them to the media.[30] Converting to a more representative system that counts ticket sales rather than gross is also fraught with problems because the only data available for older films are the sale totals.[26] As the motion picture industry is highly oriented towards marketing currently released films, unadjusted figures are always used in marketing campaigns so that new blockbuster films can much more easily achieve a high sales ranking, and thus be promoted as a \"top film of all time\",[24][31] so there is little incentive to switch to a more robust analysis from a marketing or even newsworthy point of view.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** \"All Time Worldwide Box Office\". *Box Office Mojo*.
