Its first and earliest edition was published in collaboration with *Times Higher Education* (*THE*) magazine as Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings, inaugurated in 2004 to provide an independent source of comparative data about university performance. In 2009, the two organizations parted ways to produce independent university rankings, the QS World University Rankings and THE World University Rankings. \n\n\nQS’ rankings portfolio have since been expanded to consist of the QS World University Rankings, the QS World University Rankings by Subject, four regional rankings tables including: Asia, Latin America, Europe, Central Asia, the Arab Region, several MBA rankings, and the QS Best Student Cities rankings. \n\n\nIn 2022, QS launched the QS World University Rankings: Sustainability.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### QS World University Rankings[edit]\n\n\nThe QS World University Rankings are released annually, typically in June. The 2023 edition featured 1418 institutions across 100 locations. The rankings are based on a methodology that considers a range of factors, including academic reputation, employer reputation, research impact, and internationalization. The methodology is reviewed annually to ensure that it remains relevant and up-to-date. The most recent methodology used by QS to calculate the rankings includes the following indicators:[19]\n\n\n\n#### Academic reputation[edit]\n\n\nAccounting for 40% of the overall score, academic reputation relates to academic excellence and the scholarly esteem in which the world’s universities are held. It collates more than 150,000 responses from academics in more than 140 countries and locations.[20][21] QS has previously published the job titles and geographical distribution of the participants in this survey.[21]\n\n\n\n#### Faculty/student ratio[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** \"QS Intelligence Unit – QS Graduate Employability Rankings\". *www.iu.qs.com*.

In 2023, QS will launch the QS World University Rankings: Europe. These editions include an expanded roster of ranked universities for each region than those featured in the QS World University Rankings which only feature the very best in location. \n\n\nWhile the same methodological indicators tend to be used for the regional rankings, the weightings are modified and additional lenses are included to account for the unique characteristics of each region. Additional metrics include incoming and outgoing exchange students, academic staff with a PhD, and web visibility. Accordingly, the performance of institutions within their respective regional rankings can differ significantly from the QS World University Rankings released in the same academic year.[31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** Baty, Phil (10 September 2010). \"Views: Ranking Confession\". *Inside Higher Ed*.

The first rankings produced by QS independently of *THE*, and using QS's methodology, were released in September 2010; the second rankings were released a year later, in September 2011.\n\n\nQS designed its rankings to assess performance according to what it believes to be key aspects of a university's mission: teaching, research, nurturing employability, and internationalisation.[17]\n\n\nQS has a global presence with offices in Europe, Asia, and the Americas and provides products and services related to student recruitment, events, and consulting services. In 2022, the firm's founder, Nunzio Quacquarelli, was appointed as the company's president. Jessica Turner serves as the company's chief executive officer, responsible for the firm's operations and strategy.[18]\n\n\n\n## Rankings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nQS World University Rankings: Arab Region: Top 10\n| Institution | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Saudi Arabia](image)King Abdulaziz University (KAU) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 4\n |\n| ![Qatar](image)Qatar University | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 6 | 7\n |\n| ![Saudi Arabia](image)King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals | 3 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 2\n |\n| ![Saudi Arabia](image)King Saud University | 4 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 4 | 3\n |\n| ![Lebanon](image)American University of Beirut (AUB) | 5 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1\n |\n| ![United Arab Emirates](image)United Arab Emirates University | 6 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5\n |\n| ![United Arab Emirates](image)Khalifa University | 7 | 9 | 9 | 12 | 15 | =21\n |\n| ![Oman](image)Sultan Qaboos University | 8 | 7 | 8 | 8 | 10 | 10\n |\n| ![United Arab Emirates](image)American University of Sharjah | 9 | 15 | 16 | 7 | 7 | =21\n |\n| ![Jordan](image)University of Jordan | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 9 | 9\n |\n\n\n#### Asia[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2009, QS launched the QS World University Rankings: Asia in partnership with The Chosun Ilbo newspaper in Korea to rank universities in Asia independently. The 15th edition, released in 2022, ranked 760 universities, with inclusion based on the United Nations' M49 Standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** \"促勿沉迷追逐QS大学排名 学者：教育不是利润商品|中國報\". *中國報 China Press*. 17 November 2023.

University standing here is of special interest to potential students, and acknowledging this was the impetus behind the inaugural QS Graduate Employability Rankings, published in November 2015.[27][28] However, these rankings were subsequently discontinued in 2021, with its data rolled into the QS World University Rankings methodology.\n\n\n\n#### Internationalization[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween 2004 and 2009, QS produced the rankings in partnership with *THE*. In 2009, *THE* announced they would produce their own rankings, the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*, in partnership with Thomson Reuters. *THE* cited an asserted weakness in the methodology of the original rankings,[14] as well as a perceived favoritism in the existing methodology for science over the humanities,[15] as two of the key reasons for the decision to split with QS.\n\n\nQS retained intellectual property in the prior rankings and the methodology used to compile them,[*citation needed*] which it continued to develop and refine over subsequent iterations.[16]\n\n\n*THE* created a new methodology with Thomson Reuters, and published the first *Times Higher Education World University Rankings* in September 2010.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn an article titled *The Globalisation of College and University Rankings* and appearing in the January/February 2012 issue of *Change*, Philip Altbach, professor of higher education at Boston College and also a member of the THE editorial board, said: \"The QS World University Rankings are the most problematical. From the beginning, the QS has relied on reputational indicators for half of its analysis … it probably accounts for the significant variability in the QS rankings over the years. In addition, QS queries employers, introducing even more variability and unreliability into the mix. Whether the QS rankings should be taken seriously by the higher education community is questionable.\"[49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 2011, the *New Statesman* labeled the rankings \"The QS World University Rankings are a load of old baloney\" in a headline for an article by David Blanchflower, a labour economist, who wrote that, \"This ranking is complete rubbish and nobody should place any credence in it. The results are based on an entirely flawed methodology that underweights the quality of research and overweights fluff... The QS is a flawed index and should be ignored.\"[47]\n\n\nThe QS Subject Rankings have been dismissed as unreliable by Brian Leiter, who points out that programmes that are known to be high quality, and which rank highly in the Blackwell rankings (e.g., the University of Pittsburgh) fare poorly in the QS ranking for reasons that are not at all clear.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCategories of QS World University Rankings by Faculty and Subject\n| Arts & Humanities | Engineering & Technology | Life Sciences & Medicine | Natural Sciences | Social Sciences\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Art & Design | Computer Science | Agriculture & Forestry | Biological Sciences | Accounting\n |\n| Architecture | Data Science | Anatomy | Chemistry | Business\n |\n| Archaeology | Engineering – Chemical | Anthropology | Earth & Marine Sciences | Communication\n |\n| Classics | Engineering – Civil | Dentistry | Environmental Sciences | Development Studies\n |\n| English Language | Engineering – Electrical | Medicine | Geography | Economics & Econometrics\n |\n| History | Engineering – Mechanical | Nursing | Geology | Education\n |\n| Performing Arts | Engineering – Mineral | Pharmacy | Geophysics | Hospitality & Leisure Management\n |\n| History of Art | Petroleum Engineering | Veterinary Science | Mathematics | Law\n |\n| Linguistics |  |  | Materials Science | Library Management\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Employability (35% – 30% in Finance and Business Analytics)\n* Alumni Outcomes (15% – 20% in Finance and Business Analytics)\n* Return on Investment (20%)\n* Thought Leadership (15%)\n* Class and Faculty Diversity (10%)\n\n\nIn addition, QS produces two other annual MBA comparisons, the Online MBA Rankings[33] and the Executive MBA Rankings.[34]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2015, *The Guardian* referred to the QS World University Rankings as \"the most authoritative of their kind\".[35][36]\n\n\nIn September 2012, *The Independent* described the QS World University Rankings as being \"widely recognised throughout higher education as the most trusted international tables\".[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Official website\n* QS Intelligence Unit Blog, a blog on rankings and higher education from the team that compiles  *QS World University Rankings*\n* universityrankings.ch: Comparison and results of *QS World University Rankings*, Shanghai Ranking, Leiden Ranking and Times Higher Education Ranking\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_UudpReXnSzdy0nHm7o3fSbG8","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

MIT is one of three private land grant universities in the United States, the others being Cornell University and Tuskegee University. The institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the Charles River, and encompasses a number of major off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates Center, and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Research Laboratory of Electronics\n* Senseable City Lab\n* Whitehead Institute\n |\n| People | * Alumni\n* Faculty\n* Institute Professors\n* Presidents\n* William Barton Rogers\n |\n| Culture | * Brass Rat\n* Caltech rivalry\n* Hacks\n* Lemelson–MIT Prize\n* List Visual Arts Center\n* MIT $100K\n* MIT Press\n* *MIT Technology Review*\n* MIT Science Fiction Society\n* Mystery Hunt\n* Project Athena\n* Smoot\n* Student Information Processing Board\n* Tech Model Railroad Club\n* Tech Squares\n* *The Tech*\n* Traditions and activities\n |\n| Campus | * Building 20\n* Chapel\n* Dormitories\n* Fraternities and sororities\n* Green Building\n* Infinite Corridor\n* Killian Court\n* Kresge Auditorium\n* Libraries\n* MIT Museum\n* Police\n* Stata Center\n* Sean Collier Memorial\n* Wiesner Building\n |\n| History | * History of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n* Round Hill\n |\n| Athletics | * Engineers\n* Tech Dinghy\n |\n| Notable projects | * MIT App Inventor\n* MIT OpenCourseWare\n* MITx\n* Scratch\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Symbols: Seal\". *MIT Graphic Identity*.

In 2005, Caltech students pranked MIT's Campus Preview Weekend by distributing t-shirts that read \"MIT\" on the front, and \"...because not everyone can go to Caltech\" on the back.[355][356][357] Additionally, the word Massachusetts in the \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" engraving on the exterior of the Lobby 7 dome was covered with a banner so that it read \"That Other Institute of Technology.\" In 2006, MIT retaliated by posing as contractors and stealing the 1.7-ton, 130-year-old Fleming cannon, a Caltech landmark. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n380. **^** Cohen, Rachel (2010-05-18). \"MIT the No. 1 jock school?

A few months later, Caltech students collaborated to help MIT students place the TARDIS on top of their originally planned destination.[360] The rivalry has continued, most recently in 2014, when a group of Caltech students gave out mugs sporting the MIT logo on the front and the words \"The Institute of Technology\" on the back. When heated, the mugs turned orange and read, \"Caltech, The Hotter Institute of Technology.\"[361]\n\n\n\n### Activities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Traditions and student activities at MIT\n\nSee also: Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nSee also: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology fraternities, sororities, and ILGs\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Wildes, Karl L.; Lindgren, Nilo A.
