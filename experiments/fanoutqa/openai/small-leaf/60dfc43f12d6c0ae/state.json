It was released on 6 January 2017 as one of the double lead singles from his third studio album *\u00f7* (2017), along with \"Castle on the Hill\". The dancehall and R&B-infused pop song was written by Sheeran, Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid. Due to its interpolation of \"No Scrubs\" by TLC, Kandi Burruss, Tameka \"Tiny\" Cottle, and Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs are also credited as writers. The song was produced by Sheeran and Mac.\n\n\n\"Shape of You\" peaked at number one on the singles charts of 34 countries, including the US *Billboard* Hot 100 (later becoming the best performing song of 2017), as well as the UK, Australian and Canadian singles charts. It stayed at number one for a record-tying 16 consecutive weeks on the Canadian Hot 100, as well as 14 nonconsecutive weeks on the UK Singles Chart, and 12 non-consecutive weeks on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n105. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Shape of You (Acoustic): Ed Sheeran\". *Amazon UK*.

To further tease the release, Sheeran and his label used a sponsored Snapchat lens filter with 30 seconds of the song to increase buzz among the general public.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe official remix of \"Shape of You\" features newly additional verses and guest vocals by English grime artist Stormzy. The remix premiered during Sheeran and Stormzy's live collaboration at the 2017 Brit Awards at The O2 in London on 22 February 2017.\n[88]\n\n\nSheeran announced on Twitter that the remix would be released officially on 24 February 2017.[89] On the same date, various remixes of the song were released on digital music services. Sheeran teased the releases ahead of 2017 Brit Awards ceremony. \"I've got two things dropping on Friday that are pretty interesting\", he revealed in a BBC Radio 1 interview just hours before the big show. \"One that gets debuted at the Brits, which I think people will go a bit nuts for.\" He added, \"It's something that I think nobody is expecting. I think it'll be decent.\"[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n52. **^** Caulfield, Keith (11 December 2017). \"The Year in Charts 2017: Ed Sheeran Is Top Artist, Kendrick Lamar's 'DAMN.'

But that almost serves as an indication of what the 'Thinking Out Loud' singer has been up to during his hiatus: creating music that still feels like Sheeran, just with a new twist.\"[28] Jeremy Gordon of *Spin* gave the song a positive review, stating that the song \"is a plausible attempt at convincing us he has had sex ... a lot of it. It kind of slaps, though you can't really picture Sheeran ever saying 'put that body on me' to a real human woman.\"[29] *Entertainment Weekly* gave the song a B+ rating,[30] and *Rolling Stone* ranked the song at number 13 on its \"50 best songs of 2017\" list.[31] *USA Today* ranked it at number 36 of 2017 singles.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** 60th GRAMMY Awards: Full Nominees List Archived 28 January 2018 at the Wayback Machine National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, 28 November 2017\n7. **^** \"Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs\". *Billboard*.

It has received Latin Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Urban Fusion/Performance, and Best Short Form Music Video at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards. \"Despacito\" has been also ranked among the best Latin songs of all time and the best songs of 2017 by various publications, which referred to it as one of the most successful Spanish-language tracks in pop music history.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBoth Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee included the song on their setlists for the 2017\u201318 Love + Dance World Tour and the 2017 Tamo En Vivo Europe Tour, respectively.[168][169][170] On November 16, 2017, Luis Fonsi sang \"Despacito\" featuring Puerto Rican singer Victor Manuelle, Colombian band Bomba Est\u00e9reo and American disc jockey Diplo at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards.[171] On January 28, 2018, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee performed the song at the 60th Grammy Awards on the Madison Square Garden, becoming the 12th and 13th Latin artists ever to perform at the Grammy Awards.[172][173] Fonsi also participated on United States President Joe Biden's inauguration by performing \"Despacito\" at the *Celebrating America* special on January 20, 2021.[174]\n\n\n\n## Other remixes and cover versions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Drake's vocals were recorded by Noel Cadastre and Noah \"40\" Shebib at the Sandra Gale Studios in California and the SOTA Studios in Toronto. The vocal recording was assisted by Thomas Warren, while additional vocals were provided by PartyNextDoor. Manny Marroquin mixed \"Work\" at the Larrabee Studios, while Noel \"Gadget\" Campbell and Shebib did the mixing at the Studio 360 and SOTA Studios in Toronto. The mastering was done by Chris Gehringer at the Sterling Sound in New York City.[17] \"Work\" marked the third collaboration between Rihanna and Drake, following \"What's My Name?\" in 2010 and \"Take Care\" in 2012.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## Composition and lyrical interpretation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\"**Work**\" is a song by Barbadian singer Rihanna from her eighth studio album *Anti* (2016), featuring Canadian rapper Drake. The song was released as the lead single on January 27, 2016, through Westbury Road and Roc Nation. The song was written by the artists, PartyNextDoor, Monte Moir, Rupert \"Sevn\" Thomas, Allen Ritter, and producer Matthew \"Boi-1da\" Samuels, with additional production from Kuk Harrell and Noah \"40\" Shebib.[1] The dancehall, reggae-pop, and R&B song, contains an interpolation of \"If You Were Here Tonight\" (1985) performed by Alexander O'Neal. Lyrically, the song incorporates themes of working for money, as well as discussing fragile relationships. The song is written in Jamaican Patois and Bajan Creole.[2][3] Three of its writer-producers: Rupert \"Sevn\" Thomas, Matthew \"Boi-1da\" Samuels, and Jahron \"PartyNextDoor\" Brathwaite, are Jamaican Canadians.[4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2016 single by Rihanna featuring Drake\n\n\n| \"Work\" |\n| --- |\n| ![Rihanna covering her face with her hands](image) |\n| Single by Rihanna featuring Drake |\n| from the album  *Anti*  |\n| Language | * Bajan Creole\n* Jamaican Patois\n* English\n |\n| Released | January\u00a027,\u00a02016\u00a0(2016-01-27) |\n| Recorded | December 2015 |\n| Studio | * Westlake and Sandra Gale (Los Angeles)\n* S.O.T.A.
