Mass production of oil began around 1945, with Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates having large quantities of oil.[37] Estimated oil reserves, especially in Saudi Arabia and Iran, are some of the highest in the world, and the international oil cartel OPEC is dominated by Middle Eastern countries.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Countries and territory usually considered within the Middle East[edit]\n\n\nTraditionally included within the Middle East are Arabia, Asia Minor, East Thrace, Egypt, Iran, the Levant, Mesopotamia, and the Socotra Archipelago.

Industries of the Middle Eastern region include oil and oil-related products, agriculture, cotton, cattle, dairy, textiles, leather products, surgical instruments, defence equipment (guns, ammunition, tanks, submarines, fighter jets, UAVs, and missiles). Banking is also an important sector of the economies, especially in the case of UAE and Bahrain.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost Middle Eastern countries (13 out of 18) are part of the Arab world. The most populous countries in the region are Egypt, Turkey, and Iran, while Saudi Arabia is the largest Middle Eastern country by area. The history of the Middle East dates back to ancient times, with the geopolitical importance of the region being recognized for millennia.[4][5][6] Several major religions have their origins in the Middle East, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.[7] Arabs constitute the main ethnic group in the region,[8] followed by Turks, Persians, Kurds, Azeris, Copts, Jews, Assyrians, Iraqi Turkmen, Yazidis, and Greek Cypriots.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Oil and gas pipelines in the Middle-East\nMiddle Eastern economies range from being very poor (such as Gaza and Yemen) to extremely wealthy nations (such as Qatar and UAE).

The designation, *Mashriq*, also from the Arabic root for *East*, also denotes a variously defined region around the Levant, the eastern part of the Arabic-speaking world (as opposed to the *Maghreb*, the western part).[29] Even though the term originated in the West, apart from Arabic, other languages of countries of the Middle East also use a translation of it. The Persian equivalent for Middle East is خاورمیانه (*Khāvar-e miyāneh*), the Hebrew is המזרח התיכון (*hamizrach hatikhon*), the Turkish is Orta Doğu and the Greek is Μέση Ανατολή (*Mesi Anatoli*).\n\n\n\n## Countries and territory[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Middle Eastern countries by population\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Arms | Flag | Country | Area(km2)\n | Population(2023)[30] | Density(per km2)\n | Capital | NominalGDP, bn (2023)[30] | GDP per capita (2023)[30] | Currency\n | Government\n | Officiallanguage(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![United Kingdom](image) | ![Akrotiri and Dhekelia](image) | Akrotiri and Dhekelia | 254\n | 18,195\n | 72\n | Episkopi | N/A\n | N/A\n | Euro | *De facto* stratocratic dependency under a constitutional monarchy | English |\n| ![Bahrain](image) | ![Bahrain](image) | Bahrain | 780\n | 1,581,000\n | 2,027\n | Manama | $44.994\n | $28,464.173\n | Bahraini dinar | Absolute monarchy | Arabic |\n| ![Cyprus](image) | ![Cyprus](image) | Cyprus | 9,250\n | 921,000\n | 100\n | Nicosia | $32.032\n | $34,790.581\n | Euro | Presidential republic | Greek,Turkish |\n| ![Egypt](image) | ![Egypt](image) | Egypt | 1,010,407\n | 105,672,000\n | 105\n | Cairo | $398.397\n | $3,770.133\n | Egyptian pound | Presidential republic | Arabic |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) | ![Iran](image) | Iran | 1,648,195\n | 86,547,000\n | 53\n | Tehran | $366.438\n | $4,233.986\n | Iranian rial | Islamic republic | Persian |\n| ![Iraq](image) | ![Iraq](image) | Iraq | 438,317\n | 43,345,000\n | 99\n | Baghdad | $254.993\n | $5,882.894\n | Iraqi dinar | Parliamentary republic | Arabic,Kurdish |\n| ![Israel](image) | ![Israel](image) | Israel | 20,770\n | 9,807,000\n | 472\n | Jerusalema | $521.688\n | $53,195.879\n | Israeli shekel | Parliamentary republic | Hebrew |\n| ![Jordan](image) | ![Jordan](image) | Jordan | 92,300\n | 10,312,000\n | 112\n | Amman | $50.022\n | $4,850.663\n | Jordanian dinar | Constitutional monarchy | Arabic |\n| ![Kuwait](image) | ![Kuwait](image) | Kuwait | 17,820\n | 4,957,000\n | 278\n | Kuwait City | $159.687\n | $32,215.034\n | Kuwaiti dinar | Constitutional monarchy | Arabic |\n|  | ![Lebanon](image) | Lebanon | 10,452\n | 6,633,000 (2022)\n | 635\n | Beirut | $21.780 (2022)\n | $3,283.414 (2022)\n | Lebanese pound | Parliamentary republic | Arabic |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Lynch, Marc, ed. *The Arab Uprisings Explained: New Contentious Politics in the Middle East* (Columbia University Press, 2014). p. 352.\n* Palmer, Michael A.

Other defining events in this transformation included the establishment of Israel in 1948 and the eventual departure of European powers, notably Britain and France by the end of the 1960s.

The term came into widespread usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to the Far East) beginning in the early 20th century. The term \"Middle East\" has led to some confusion over its changing definitions,[2] and being seen as too Eurocentric.[3] The region includes the vast majority of the territories included in the closely associated definition of West Asia, but without the South Caucasus, and additionally includes all of Egypt (not just the Sinai) and all of Turkey (not just the part barring East Thrace).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith the exception of Cyprus, Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon and Israel, tourism has been a relatively undeveloped area of the economy, in part because of the socially conservative nature of the region as well as political turmoil in certain regions of the Middle East. In recent years,[*when?*] however, countries such as the UAE, Bahrain, and Jordan have begun attracting greater numbers of tourists because of improving tourist facilities and the relaxing of tourism-related restrictive policies.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nUnemployment is notably high in the Middle East and North Africa region, particularly among young people aged 15–29, a demographic representing 30% of the region's total population. The total regional unemployment rate in 2005, according to the International Labour Organization, was 13.2%,[55] and among youth is as high as 25%,[56] up to 37% in Morocco and 73% in Syria.[57]\n\n\n\n## Climate change[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDamascus – Syria\n* ![Doha – Qatar](image)\n\nDoha – Qatar\n* ![Dubai – United Arab Emirates](image)\n\nDubai – United Arab Emirates\n* ![Istanbul – Turkey](image)\n\nIstanbul – Turkey\n* ![Jerusalem – Israel](image)\n\nJerusalem – Israel\n* ![Kuwait City – Kuwait](image)\n\nKuwait City – Kuwait\n* ![Manama – Bahrain](image)\n\nManama – Bahrain\n* ![Muscat – Oman](image)\n\nMuscat – Oman\n* ![Nicosia – Cyprus](image)\n\nNicosia – Cyprus\n* ![Ramallah – Palestine](image)\n\nRamallah – Palestine\n* ![Riyadh – Saudi Arabia](image)\n\nRiyadh – Saudi Arabia\n* ![Sana'a – Yemen](image)\n\nSana'a – Yemen\n* ![Tehran – Iran](image)\n\nTehran – Iran\n* ![Tel Aviv – Israel](image)\n\nTel Aviv – Israel\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Islam is the largest religion in the Middle East. Here, Muslim men are prostrating during prayer in a mosque.\nThe Middle East is very diverse when it comes to religions, many of which originated there. Islam is the largest religion in the Middle East, but other faiths that originated there, such as Judaism and Christianity,[43] are also well represented. Christian communities have played a vital role in the Middle East,[44] and they represent 40.5% of Lebanon, where the Lebanese president, half of the cabinet, and half of the parliament follow one of the various Lebanese Christian rites. There are also important minority religions like the Baháʼí Faith, Yarsanism, Yazidism,[45] Zoroastrianism, Mandaeism, Druze,[46] and Shabakism, and in ancient times the region was home to Mesopotamian religions, Canaanite religions, Manichaeism, Mithraism and various monotheist gnostic sects.\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nArabs constitute the largest ethnic group in the Middle East, followed by various Iranian peoples and then by Turkic peoples (Turkish, Azeris, Syrian Turkmen, and Iraqi Turkmen). Native ethnic groups of the region include, in addition to Arabs, Arameans, Assyrians, Baloch, Berbers, Copts, Druze, Greek Cypriots, Jews, Kurds, Lurs, Mandaeans, Persians, Samaritans, Shabaks, Tats, and Zazas. European ethnic groups that form a diaspora in the region include Albanians, Bosniaks, Circassians (including Kabardians), Crimean Tatars, Greeks, Franco-Levantines, Italo-Levantines, and Iraqi Turkmens. Among other migrant populations are Chinese, Filipinos, Indians, Indonesians, Pakistanis, Pashtuns, Romani, and Afro-Arabs.\n\n\n\n### Migration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrom the 4th century CE onwards, the Middle East became the center of the two main powers at the time, the Byzantine Empire and the Sassanid Empire. However, it would be the later Islamic Caliphates of the Middle Ages, or Islamic Golden Age which began with the Islamic conquest of the region in the 7th century AD, that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant Islamic Arab ethnic identity that largely (but not exclusively) persists today. The 4 caliphates that dominated the Middle East for more than 600 years were the Rashidun Caliphate, the Umayyad caliphate, the Abbasid caliphate and the Fatimid caliphate. Additionally, the Mongols would come to dominate the region, the Kingdom of Armenia would incorporate parts of the region to their domain, the Seljuks would rule the region and spread Turko-Persian culture, and the Franks would found the Crusader states that would stand for roughly two centuries. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Middle East generally has a hot, arid climate, especially in the Arabian and Egyptian regions. Several major rivers provide irrigation to support agriculture in limited areas here, such as the Nile Delta in Egypt, the Tigris and Euphrates watersheds of Mesopotamia, and the basin of the Jordan River that spans most of the Levant. These regions are collectively known as the Fertile Crescent, and comprise the core of what historians had long referred to as the cradle of civilization (a label now applied to multiple regions of the world). Conversely, the Levantine coast and most of Turkey have relatively temperate climates typical of the Mediterranean, with dry summers and cool, wet winters. Most of the countries that border the Persian Gulf have vast reserves of petroleum, with monarchs of the Arabian Peninsula in particular benefiting economically from petroleum exports. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) UNBZC\n* ![](image) UNDOF Zone\n |\n| Languages | 60 languages\n\n* **Official languages**\n* Arabic\n* English\n* Greek\n* Hebrew\n* Kurdish\n* Persian\n* Turkish\n* **Languages without official status** (spoken by diaspora or other minorities)\n* Albanian\n* Armenian\n* Abaza\n* Abkhaz\n* Amharic\n* Azerbaijani\n* Balochi\n* Bosniak[*dubious – discuss*]\n* Chechen\n* Chinese\n* Circassian\n* Crimean Tatar\n* Coptic\n* Domari\n* French\n* Balkan Gagauz Turkish\n* Georgian\n* Gilaki\n* Hungarian\n* Hindi\n* Indonesian\n* Italian\n* Kazakh\n* Kumyk\n* Kurbet\n* Kyrgyz\n* Judæo-Spanish\n* Laz\n* Lurish\n* Marathi\n* Malayalam\n* Mazanderani\n* Neo-Aramaic\n* Nobiin\n* Qashqai\n* Romanian\n* Russian\n* Siwa\n* Somali\n* Syriac\n* Spanish\n* Punjabi\n* Tagalog\n* Talysh\n* Tatar\n* Turkmen\n* Turoyo\n* Ukrainian\n* Urdu\n* Uyghur\n* Yiddish\n* Zaza\n |\n| Time zones | UTC+02:00, UTC+03:00, UTC+03:30, UTC+04:00, UTC+04:30 |\n| Largest cities | 10 largest cities in the Middle East\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ Nicobar Islands\n* Maldives\n* Alpide belt\n* Asia–Pacific\n* Tropical Asia\n* Tibetan Plateau\n |\n| West(not to be confusedwith Middle East) | * Red Sea\n\t+ Hanish Islands\n* Caspian Sea\n* Mediterranean Sea\n* Zagros Mountains\n\t+ Elam\n* Persian Gulf\n\t+ Pirate Coast\n\t+ Strait of Hormuz\n\t+ Greater and Lesser Tunbs\n* Al-Faw Peninsula\n* Gulf of Oman\n* Gulf of Aqaba\n* Gulf of Aden\n* Balochistan\n* Arabian Peninsula\n\t+ Najd\n\t\t- Al-Yamama\n\t+ Hejaz\n\t+ Tihamah\n\t+ Eastern Arabia\n\t+ South Arabia\n\t\t- Hadhramaut\n\t\t- Arabian Peninsula coastal fog desert\n* Al-Sharat\n* Tigris–Euphrates\n* Mesopotamia\n\t+ Upper Mesopotamia\n\t+ Lower Mesopotamia\n\t+ Sawad\n\t+ Nineveh Plains\n\t+ Akkad (region)\n\t+ Babylonia\n* Suhum\n* Eastern Mediterranean\n* Mashriq\n* Eber-Nari\n* Kurdistan\n* Levant (Syria region)\n\t+ Palestine region\n\t+ Transjordan\n\t+ Jordan Rift Valley\n\t+ Philistia\n\t+ Golan Heights\n\t+ Hula Valley\n\t+ Galilee\n\t+ Canaan\n\t+ Gilead\n\t+ Syrian Desert\n\t+ Judea\n\t+ Samaria\n\t+ Arabah\n\t+ Aram\n\t\t- Aram-Naharaim\n\t+ Negev\n\t+ Phoenicia\n\t+ Retjenu\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArabic, with all its dialects, is the most widely spoken language in the Middle East, with Literary Arabic being official in all North African and in most West Asian countries.
