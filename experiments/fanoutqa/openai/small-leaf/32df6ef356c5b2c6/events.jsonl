Built in 1756, the John Maclean House, also known as the President's House, was where the president lived until Prospect House was acquired in 1878.[16] In 1968, the official residence switched again to Walter Lowrie House.[17] The Office of the President is housed in Nassau Hall.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of presidents\n| No. | President\n | Presidency\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![Portrait of Jonathan Dickinson](image) | Jonathan Dickinson | 1747\n | Died shortly after entering office from a pleuritic illness[19] | [6] |\n| 2\n | ![Portrait of Aaron Burr, Sr.](image) | Aaron Burr Sr. | 1748–1757[b] | Minister of the Presbyterian Church of Newark.[21] Father of Aaron Burr, the third Vice President of the United States.[22] Died from illness while in office.[23] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | David Cowell | 1757-1758\n | Served as acting president.[11] | [11] |\n| 3\n | ![Portrait of Jonathan Edwards](image) | Jonathan Edwards | 1758\n | Eminent theologian to the First Great Awakening.[24][25] Died five weeks into office after a fever from a smallpox vaccine.[26] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | Jacob Green | 1758–1759\n | Delegate for Morris County to the Provincial Congress of New Jersey.[27] Father of Ashbel Green, 8th president of the university.[28][27] Served as acting president.[6] | [6] |\n| 4\n | ![Portrait of Samuel Davies](image) | Samuel Davies | 1759–1761\n | Died shortly after entering office from pneumonia[29] | [6] |\n| 5\n | ![Portrait of Samuel Finley](image) | Samuel Finley | 1761–1766\n | Founder of West Nottingham Academy;[30][31] Minister of the Cold Spring Presbyterian Church.[32] Graduate of the Log College.[33] Died while in office in Philadelphia seeking medical treatment.[34] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | John Blair | 1767–1768\n | Graduate of the Log College.[33] Served as acting president.[6] | [6] |\n| 6\n | ![Portrait of John Witherspoon](image) | John Witherspoon | 1768–1794\n | Signer of the Declaration of Independence; Delegate to the Second Continental Congress; Moderator of the first General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.[35] Died while in office.[36] | [6] |\n| 7\n | ![Portrait of Samuel S.

A large number of students migrating to universities under the G.I. Bill, and the ensuing increase in Penn's student population highlighted that Penn had outgrown previous expansions, which ended during the Great Depression era. But in addition to a significant student population from the Delaware Valley, the university continued to attract international students from at least 50 countries and from all 50 states as early as of the second decade of the 1920s.[84][87] Penn Trustee Paul Miller wrote that, in the post-World War II era,: \"[t]he bricks-and-mortar Capital Campaign of the Sixties...built the facilities that turned Penn from a commuter school to a residential one....\"[88] By 1961, 79% of male undergraduates and 57% of female undergraduates lived on campus.[89]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n84. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Franklin, Michael (ed.). \"A Timeline of Diversity at the University of Pennsylvania\".

It is one of nine colonial colleges and was chartered prior to the U.S. Declaration of Independence when Benjamin Franklin, the university's founder and first president, advocated for an educational institution that trained leaders in academia, commerce, and public service. Penn identifies as the fourth oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by other universities, as Franklin first convened the Board of Trustees in 1749, arguably making it the fifth oldest institution of higher education in the U.S.[note 2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n101. **^** \"The life and accomplishments of Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander\".

Sometime later in its early history, Penn began naming 1749 as its founding date, which it continued to reference as the founding date for over a century, including at a centennial celebration in 1849.[49] In 1899, the board of trustees voted to adjust the founding date earlier again, this time to 1740, the date of \"the creation of the earliest of the many educational trusts the University has taken upon itself\", according to a book on the university's history.[50] The board of trustees voted in response to a three-year campaign by Penn's General Alumni Society to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740 for a number of reasons, including to appear older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746.[51]\n\n\n\n### First university[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHospital of the University of Pennsylvania (facing northwest towards front entrance)\n* ![](image)\n\nPenn owned Princeton Medical Center, eastern facade\n\n\n## Research and discoveries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer, was founded at Penn in 1946\n![](image)Claudia Cohen Hall, formerly Logan Hall, home of the College of Arts and Sciences and former home of the Wharton School and originally, the medical school\nPenn is classified as an \"R1\" doctoral university: \"Highest research activity.\"[200] Its economic impact on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for 2015 amounted to $14.3 billion.[201] Penn's research expenditures in the 2018 fiscal year were $1.442 billion, the fourth largest in the U.S.[202] In fiscal year 2019 Penn received $582.3 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health.[203]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs detailed in part above, by the first decades of the twentieth century, Penn made strides and took an active interest in attracting diverse students from around the globe. Two examples of such action occurred in 1910.

That same year, the Penn-affiliated organization, the Cosmopolitan Club, started an annual tradition of hosting an opening \"smoker\", which attracted students from 40 nations who were formally welcomed to the university by then-vice provost Edgar Fahs Smith (who the following year would start a ten-year tenure as provost)[304][305][306][307][308] who spoke about how Penn wanted to \"bring together students of different countries and break down misunderstandings existing between them\".[272]\n\n\nThe success of such efforts were reported in 1921 when the official Penn publicity department reported that\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A 1765 admission ticket to \"A Course of Lectures\" given by Dr. John Morgan, the founder and first professor of medicine at Penn's Medical School\nThe University of Pennsylvania considers itself the first university in the United States with both undergraduate and graduate studies, though that claim is contested by other universities.

One of its ten founding ministers, Abraham Pierson, became its first Rector, the administrative and ecclesiastical head of the college. After Pierson, four more ministers served as rectors of the collegiate school, until 1745 when Yale College was chartered by the Colony of Connecticut and Thomas Clap's title was changed to president. In 1878, Yale incorporated as a university, and incumbent Timothy Dwight V became the last president of the college and the first of Yale University. The first president not ordained as a minister was Arthur Twining Hadley, inaugurated in 1899; no ordained person has held the office since.\n\n\nThe president is elected by the Yale Corporation, the governing body of the University on which the president sits *ex-officio*. The corporation's bylaws state that the president is \"chief executive officer of the University and as such is responsible for the general direction of all its affairs.\"[1] The president nominates other university officers, including the provost, secretary, and other vice presidents, for election by the corporation. Other top-level administrative positions, such as university chaplain, deans of schools, and masters of residential colleges, are appointed by the president alone.\n\n\nThe university's current president is Peter Salovey, a professor of social psychology who formerly served as University Provost and Dean of Yale College and received his Ph.D. from Yale's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.\n\n\nThe Office of the President is located in Woodbridge Hall, a 1901 building erected specifically for administrative purpose.[2] The university maintains an official home for the president on Hillhouse Avenue, which hosts presidential events. Peter Salovey, inaugurated in 2013, is the first president since 1986 to use the home as his primary residence.[3]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ezra Stiles, by Samuel King\n## Rectors of Yale College (1701–)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  | Rectors of Yale College[4] | birth–death | years as rector\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Abraham Pierson | (1641–1707) | (1701–1707) Collegiate School\n |\n| 2 | Samuel Andrew | (1656–1738) | (1707–1719; *pro tempore*)\n |\n| 3 | Timothy Cutler | (1684–1765) | (1719–1726) 1718/9: renamed Yale College\n |\n| 4 | Elisha Williams | (1694–1755) | (1726–1739)\n |\n| 5 | Thomas Clap | (1703–1767) | (1740–1745)\n |\n\n\n## Presidents of Yale College (1740–1878) and Yale University (1878–)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  | Presidents of Yale College[4] | birth–death | years as president\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5 | Thomas Clap | (1703–1767) | (1745–1766)\n |\n| 6 | Naphtali Daggett | (1727–1780) | (1766–1777; *pro tempore*) - presidency during the American Revolution\n |\n| 7 | Ezra Stiles | (1727–1795) | (1778–1795) - presidency during the American Revolution\n |\n| 8 | Timothy Dwight IV | (1752–1817) | (1795–1817)\n |\n| 9 | Jeremiah Day | (1773–1867) | (1817–1846)\n |\n| 10 | Theodore Dwight Woolsey | (1801–1889) | (1846–1871)\n |\n| 11 | Noah Porter III | (1811–1892) | (1871–1886)\n |\n| 12 | Timothy Dwight V | (1828–1916) | (1886–1899) 1887: renamed Yale University\n |\n| 13 | Arthur Twining Hadley | (1856–1930) | (1899–1921)\n |\n| 14 | James Rowland Angell | (1869–1949) | (1921–1937)\n |\n| 15 | Charles Seymour | (1885–1963) | (1937–1951)\n |\n| 16 | Alfred Whitney Griswold | (1906–1963) | (1951–1963)\n |\n| 17 | Kingman Brewster, Jr. | (1919–1988) | (1963–1977)\n |\n| 18 | Hanna Holborn Gray | (1930– ) | (1977–1978; pro tempore)\n |\n| 19 | A.

They set their own academic standards and manage their own budgets. The president, however, plays an important part in university-wide planning and strategy. Each names a faculty's dean (and, since the foundation of the office in 1994, the university's provost), and grants tenure to recommended professors; however, the president is expected to make such decisions after extensive consultation with faculty members.\n\n\nHarvard presidents have traditionally influenced educational practices nationwide. Charles W. Eliot, for example, originated America's familiar system of a smorgasbord of elective courses available to each student;[2] James B. Conant worked to introduce standardized testing; Derek Bok and Neil L. Rudenstine argued for the continued importance of diversity in higher education.\n\n\nRecently, however, the job has become increasingly administrative, especially as fund-raising campaigns have taken on central importance in large institutions such as Harvard. Some have criticized this trend to the extent it has prevented the president from focusing on substantive issues in higher education.[3]\n\n\nEach president is professor in some department of the university and teaches from time to time.\n\n\nHarvard's current president is Claudine Gay, having become Harvard's 30th president on July 1, 2023.[4]\n\n\nShe succeeded Lawrence Bacow who retired on June 30, 2023.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nAt Harvard's founding it was headed by a \"schoolmaster,\" Nathaniel Eaton. In 1640, when Henry Dunster was brought in, he adopted the title president. The origins of this title have been grounds for a certain amount of speculation.\n\n\nHarvard was founded for the training of Puritan clergy, and even though its mission was soon broadened, nearly all presidents through the end of the 18th century were in holy orders.\n\n\nAll presidents from Leonard Hoar through Nathan Pusey were graduates of Harvard College. Of the presidents since Pusey, Bok earned his undergraduate degree at Stanford, Rudenstine at Princeton, and Summers and Bacow at MIT, but each earned a graduate degree at Harvard. Drew Gilpin Faust was the first president since the seventeenth century with no earned Harvard degree.\n\n\nJohn Winthrop served as acting president in 1769 and again in 1773; but both times he declined an offer of the full presidency on grounds of old age.\n\n\nOther minor acting presidents have included William Brattle, Edward Wigglesworth (1780–1781), Henry Ware (1810, 1828–1829), Andrew Preston Peabody (1862, 1868–1869), and Henry Pickering Walcott. Henry Rosovsky, former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, served as acting president for three months in 1987 when Bok traveled abroad. Provost Albert Carnesale served as acting president for three months, from November 1994 to February 1995, during Rudenstine's leave of absence. After Faust's retirement in 2018, Bok served as interim president for a year, from July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007, prior to Faust's appointment.\n\n\n\n## Presidents of Harvard[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Image\n | Presidents\n | Term of office\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| –\n | ![](image) | Nathaniel Eaton | 1637–1639\n | Referred to as \"schoolmaster\" of Harvard College\n |\n| 1\n |  | Henry Dunster | 1640–1654\n |  |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Charles Chauncy | 1654–1672\n |  |\n| 3\n |  | Leonard Hoar | 1672–1675\n |  |\n| 4\n |  | Urian Oakes | 1675–1680 (acting); 1680–1681\n |  |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | John Rogers | 1682–1684\n |  |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | Increase Mather | 1685–1686 (acting); 1686–1692 (rector); 1692–1701\n |  |\n| –\n | ![](image) | Samuel Willard | 1701–1707 (acting)\n |  |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | John Leverett | 1708–1724\n |  |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Benjamin Wadsworth | 1725–1737\n |  |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | Edward Holyoke | 1737–1769\n |  |\n| 10\n |  | Samuel Locke | 1770–1773\n |  |\n| 11\n |  | Samuel Langdon | 1774–1780\n |  |\n| 12\n |  | Joseph Willard | 1781–1804\n |  |\n| –\n | ![](image) | Eliphalet Pearson | 1804–1806 (acting)\n |  |\n| 13\n |  | Samuel Webber | 1806–1810\n |  |\n| 14\n | ![](image) | John Thornton Kirkland | 1810–1828\n |  |\n| 15\n | ![](image) | Josiah Quincy | 1829–1845\n |  |\n| 16\n | ![](image) | Edward Everett | 1846–1848\n |  |\n| 17\n | ![](image) | Jared Sparks | 1849–1853\n |  |\n| 18\n | ![](image) | James Walker | 1853–1860\n |  |\n| 19\n | ![](image) | Cornelius Conway Felton | 1860–1862\n |  |\n| 20\n | ![](image) | Thomas Hill | 1862–1868\n |  |\n| 21\n | ![](image) | Charles William Eliot | 1869–1909\n | Longest term of office (40 years)\n |\n| 22\n | ![](image) | A.

In 2005, sponsored project awards to Dartmouth faculty research amounted to $169 million.[62]\n\n\nDartmouth served as the host member of the University Press of New England, a university press founded in 1970 that included Brandeis University, Tufts University, the University of New Hampshire, and Northeastern University.

Dartmouth, which had been a men's institution, began admitting women as full-time students and undergraduate degree candidates in 1972 amid much controversy.[38] At about the same time, the college adopted its \"Dartmouth Plan\" of academic scheduling, permitting the student body to increase in size within the existing facilities.[37] In 1988, Dartmouth's alma mater song's lyrics changed from \"Men of Dartmouth\" to \"Dear old Dartmouth\".[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSituated on a terrace above the Connecticut River, Dartmouth's 269-acre (109 ha) main campus is in the rural Upper Valley region of New England.[13] The university functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms.[14] Dartmouth is known for its undergraduate focus, Greek culture, and campus traditions.[15][16] Its 34 varsity sports teams compete intercollegiately in the Ivy League conference of the NCAA Division I. The university has many prominent alumni, including 170 members of the United States Congress,[17] 24 U.S. governors, 23 billionaires,[a] 8 U.S. Cabinet secretaries, 3 Nobel Prize laureates, 2 U.S. Supreme Court justices, and a U.S. vice president.

Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, it is one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Although originally established to educate Native Americans in Christian theology and the English way of life, the university primarily trained Congregationalist ministers during its early history before it gradually secularized. Emerging into national prominence at the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth was considered to be the most prestigious undergraduate college in the United States in the early 1900s.[8][9] While Dartmouth is now a research university rather than simply an undergraduate college, it continues to go by \"Dartmouth College\" to emphasize its focus on undergraduate education.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, Dartmouth College was the third highest in the nation in \"total of reports of rape\" on their main campus, with 42 reports of rape.[170] The *Washington Post* attributed the high number of rape reports to the fact that a growing number of sexual assault victims feel comfortable enough to report sexual assaults that would have gone unreported in previous years.[170] In 2015, the Huffington Post reported that Dartmouth had the highest rate of bystander intervention of any college surveyed, with 57.7% of Dartmouth students reporting that they would take some sort of action if they saw someone acting in a \"sexually violent or harassing manner,\" compared to 45.5% of students nationally.[171]\n\n\nDartmouth fraternities have an extensive history of hazing and alcohol abuse, leading to police raids and accusations of sexual harassment.[172][173]\n\n\n\n### Student groups[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Dartmouth College student groups, Dartmouth College publications, and Dartmouth College Greek organizations\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Chase, Frederick; John King Lord (1913). *A History of Dartmouth College and the Town of Hanover, New Hampshire, Volume 2* (1 ed.).

The engraving may also be the first visual proof of cricket being played in the United States.[26]\nIn 1819, Dartmouth College was the subject of the historic Dartmouth College case, which challenged New Hampshire's 1816 attempt to amend the college' charter to make the school a public university. An institution called Dartmouth University occupied the college buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the college continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby.[22] Daniel Webster, an alumnus of the class of 1801, presented the college's case to the Supreme Court, which found the amendment of Dartmouth's charter to be an illegal impairment of a contract by the state and reversed New Hampshire's takeover of the college. Webster concluded his peroration with the famous words: \"It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it.\"[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century. Prior to this period, the college had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded.[30] Under President William Jewett Tucker (1893–1909), Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities, faculty, and the student body, following large endowments such as the $10,000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor John Ordronaux.[31] 20 new structures replaced antiquated buildings, while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold. Tucker is often credited for having \"refounded Dartmouth\" and bringing it into national prestige.[32] \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n170. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Anderson, Nick (June 7, 2016). \"These colleges have the most reports of rape\".

Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy,[227] the mascot has received approval from only the student government.[228] In November 2006, student government attempted to revive the \"Dartmoose\" as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former unofficial Indian mascot.[229]\n\n\n\n## Alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Dartmouth College alumni\n\nDartmouth's alumni are known for frequently donating to their alma mater.[230] Most start by giving to the Senior Class Gift.
