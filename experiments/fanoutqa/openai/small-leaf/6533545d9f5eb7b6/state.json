The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States.[2][3][4][5] The city is the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the U.S. by both population and urban area. With over 20.1 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, New York City is one of the world's most populous megacities.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Gibson, Campbell.Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States:1790 to 1990, United States Census Bureau, June 1998.

New York's two key demographic features are its population density and cultural diversity. The city's population density of 29,091.3 people per square mile (11,232/km2), makes it the densest of any American municipality with a population above 100,000.[23] Manhattan's population density is 74,781 people per square mile (28,872/km2), highest of any county in the United States.[24][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Neighborhood Tabulation Areas** (**NTA**s) are a geographic unit created to help project populations at a small area level, as part of the long-term sustainability plan for the city known as **PlaNYC**, covering the years 2000\u20132030. The minimum population for an NTA is 15,000 people, a level seen as a useful summary level which can be used both with the 2010 Census and the American Community Survey.[42]\n\n\nNew York has ranked first in population among American cities since the first census in 1790. New York will maintain this position for the foreseeable future, although there are varying forecasts on how much the population will increase. The most realistic population projections from the Department of City Planning anticipate a 1.1 million increase by 2030, bringing the city's population total to 9.1 million.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Map of racial distribution in New York, 2010 U.S. Census.

About 36% of the city's population is foreign-born,[25] one of the highest among US cities. The eleven nations constituting the largest sources of modern immigration to New York City are the Dominican Republic, China, Jamaica, Guyana, Mexico, Ecuador, Brazil, Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Colombia, Russia and El Salvador.[26]\n\n\nNew York is the largest city in the United States, with the city proper's population more than double the next largest city, Los Angeles (or roughly equivalent to the combined populations of Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston, the United States' second, third, and fourth most populous cities respectively). In 2006, demographers estimated New York's population would reach 9.1 million by 2030.[27]\nIn 2000 the reported life expectancy of New Yorkers was above the national average. Life expectancy for females born in 2009 in New York City is 80.2 years and for males is 74.5 years.[28]\n\n\n\n### Households[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile the city's projected 2030 population will be a new high, only two boroughs, Staten Island and Queens have reached their population peak every year for the last 5 years. The study projects that by 2030, Queens will have 2.57 million people and Staten Island 552,000. Manhattan, with 1.83 million, Bronx with 1.46 million and Brooklyn with 2.72 million, will still be below their population peaks.[43]\n\n\n\n#### Disputed 2010 Census data[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** \nRoberts, Sam (April 28, 2010). \"Listening to (and Saving) the World's Languages\". *The New York Times*.

This is mostly due to more and more immigrants choosing directly to locate to the city's suburbs and then commute to the city or work in many of its booming edge cities such as Fort Lee, NJ, Hempstead, NY, Morristown, NJ, Stamford, CT, White Plains, NY and others. Despite the slowdown in immigration the city's overall immigrant population has continued to increase and in 2006 it numbered 3.038 million (37.0%) up from 2.871 million (35.9%) in 2000.[81][82] By 2013, the population of foreign-born individuals living in New York City had increased to 3.07 million, and as a percentage of total population, was the highest it had been in the past 100 years.[83]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** \"Explore Census Data\".

The other boroughs, especially Queens and Staten Island, have large middle-class populations. New York City's per capita income in 2000 was $22,402; men and women had a median income of $37,435 and $32,949 respectively. 21.2% of the population and 18.5% of families had incomes below the federal poverty line; 30.0% of this group were under the age of 18 and 17.8% were 65 and older. Of Forbes Magazine's 400 richest American billionaires, 70 live in New York City.[33] Former mayor and Presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg is one of the nation's richest men. As of 2009 New York has regained the number one spot as the city with most billionaires (55), after losing out to Moscow in 2008.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThroughout its history New York City has been a principal entry point for immigration to the United States. These immigrants often form ethnic enclaves, neighborhoods dominated by one ethnicity. The city experienced major immigration from Europe in the 19th century and another major wave in the early 20th century, being admitted into the United States of America primarily through Ellis Island. Since the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, and particularly since the 1980s, New York City has seen renewed rates of high immigration. Newer immigrants are from Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. 36% of the city's population is foreign-born.[25] Among U.S. cities, this proportion is higher only in Los Angeles and Miami.[16] In New York no single country or region of origin dominates. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2000, about 3 out of every 10 New York City housing units were owner-occupied, compared to about 2 owner-occupied units out of every 3 units in the U.S. as a whole.[36] Rental vacancy is usually between 3% and 4.5%, well below the 5% threshold defined to be a housing emergency, justifying the continuation of rent control and rent stabilization. About 33% of rental units fall under rent stabilization, according to which increases are adjudicated periodically by city agencies. Rent control covers only a very small number of rental units.[37] Some critics point to New York City's strict zoning and other regulations as partial causes for the housing shortage, but during the city's decline in population from the 1960s through the 1980s, a large number of apartment buildings suffered suspected arson fires or were abandoned by their owners. Once the population trend was reversed, with rising prospects for rentals and sales, new construction has resumed, but generally for purchasers in higher income brackets.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n| Area\n | MedianHouse-holdIncome | MeanHouse-holdIncome | Percent-age in Poverty\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| The Bronx | $34,156\n | $46,298\n | 27.1%\n |\n| Brooklyn | $41,406\n | $60,020\n | 21.9%\n |\n| Manhattan | $64,217\n | $121,549\n | 17.6%\n |\n| Queens | $53,171\n | $67,027\n | 12.0%\n |\n| Staten Island | $66,985\n | $81,498\n | 9.8%\n |\n| New York City | $48,631\n | $75,809\n | 18.5%\n |\n| New York State | $53,514\n | $77,865\n | 13.7%\n |\n| United States | $50,140\n | $69,193\n | 13.0%\n |\n\n\n### Boroughs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It is the third largest city and metropolitan area in the United States by population. Chicago was home to over 2.7 million people in 2020, accounting for over 25% of the population in the Chicago metropolitan area, home to approximately 9.6 million. \n\n\nThe racial makeup of the city in 2020 was 35.9% White, 29.2% Black, 7% Asian, 1.3% Native American or Alaska Native, 10.8% from two or more races, and 15.8% from some other race.[1] The ethnic makeup of the population is 29.8% Hispanic, with 70.2% belonging to a non Hispanic background.[2] English is the primary language of the city. Christianity is the predominant faith.\n\n\nDuring its first century as a city, Chicago grew at a rate that ranked among the fastest growing in the world. Within the span of forty years, the city's population grew from slightly under 30,000 to over 1 million by 1890. By the close of the 19th century, Chicago was the fifth largest city in the world.[3] Within fifty years of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the population had tripled to over 3 million.[4] The city's population peaked in the 1950 Census, although two of the three most recent Censuses as of 2024 have shown moderate growth. \n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %\u00b1 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1840 | 4,470 |  | \u2014 |\n| 1850 | 29,963 |  | 570.3% |\n| 1860 | 112,172 |  | 274.4% |\n| 1870 | 298,977 |  | 166.5% |\n| 1880 | 503,185 |  | 68.3% |\n| 1890 | 1,099,850 |  | 118.6% |\n| 1900 | 1,698,575 |  | 54.4% |\n| 1910 | 2,185,283 |  | 28.7% |\n| 1920 | 2,701,705 |  | 23.6% |\n| 1930 | 3,376,438 |  | 25.0% |\n| 1940 | 3,396,808 |  | 0.6% |\n| 1950 | 3,620,962 |  | 6.6% |\n| 1960 | 3,550,404 |  | \u22121.9% |\n| 1970 | 3,366,957 |  | \u22125.2% |\n| 1980 | 3,005,072 |  | \u221210.7% |\n| 1990 | 2,783,911 |  | \u22127.4% |\n| 2000 | 2,896,016 |  | 4.0% |\n| 2010 | 2,695,598 |  | \u22126.9% |\n| 2020 | 2,746,388 |  | 1.9% |\n\n\nIn the 2010 United States Census, there were 2,695,598 people and 1,194,337 households residing within the city limits of Chicago. More than half the population of the state of Illinois lives in the Chicago metropolitan area. The 2000 United States Census had shown the population density of the city itself was 12,750.3 people per square mile (4,923.0/km2), making it one of the nation's most densely populated cities. There were 1,152,868 housing units at an average density of 5,075.8 per square mile (1,959.8/km2). \n\n\nOf the 1,061,928 households in the 2000 census, 28.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 35.1% were married couples living together, 18.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 40.4% were non-families. The median income for a household in the city was $38,625 in 2000, and the median income for a family was $46,748. Males had a median income of $35,907 versus $30,536 for females. Below the poverty line were 19.6% of the population and 16.6% of the families.\n\n\n\n## Racial and ethnic makeup[edit]\n\n\n### 2022 United States Census Bureau American Community Survey estimates[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Racial Makeup of Chicago (2022)[5]\n\nWhite alone (35.54%)\nBlack alone (27.63%)\nNative American alone (1.31%)\nAsian alone (7.42%)\nPacific Islander alone (0.05%)\nOther race alone (13.67%)\nTwo or more races (14.38%)\n | Racial Makeup of Chicago excluding Hispanics from Racial Categories (2022)[5]*NH=Non-Hispanic*\n\nWhite NH (31.75%)\nBlack NH (27.25%)\nNative American NH (0.11%)\nAsian NH (7.31%)\nPacific Islander NH (0.04%)\nOther race NH (0.35%)\nTwo or more races NH (3.10%)\nHispanic Any Race (30.10%)\n | Racial Makeup of Hispanics in Chicago (2022)[5]\n\nWhite alone (12.61%)\nBlack alone (1.25%)\nNative American alone (3.98%)\nAsian alone (0.37%)\nPacific Islander alone (0.03%)\nOther race alone (44.28%)\nTwo or more races (37.47%)\n |\n\n\nAccording to 2021 US Census Bureau American Community Survey one-year estimates, which is conducted annually for cities over 65,000 via sampling, the population of Chicago, Illinois was 36.1% White (32.9% Non-Hispanic White and 3.2% Hispanic White), 28.5% Black or African American, 6.9% Asian, 1.1% Native American and Alaskan Native, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 13.1% Some Other Race, and 14.2% from two or more races.[6]\n\n\nThe White population is the largest racial category and includes the 10.9% of Hispanics who identify as White, with the remaining Hispanics identifying as Other Race (43.5%), Multiracial (40.1%), Black (1.5%), American Indian and Alaskan Native (3.7%), Asian (0.3%), and Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (0.1%).[6] By ethnicity, 28.8% of the total population is Hispanic-Latino (of any race) and 71.2% is Non-Hispanic (of any race). If treated as a separate category, Hispanics are the largest minority group in Chicago, Illinois.[6]\n\n\nIn 2021, 20.4% of the population was foreign born.[7] Of this, 51.8% came from Latin America, 16.8% from Europe, 24.8% from Asia and 6.6% from other parts of the world. In 1996, Chicago had the sixth highest foreign-born population in the United States.[8]\n\n\nIn 2016, the population of Hispanics exceeded that of Blacks to become Chicago's largest minority group with non-Hispanic Whites representing 32.6% of the population, Hispanics at 29.7% of the population, and Blacks at 29.3% of the population.[9] The large Hispanic population is rather recent, with the segregation between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites being low when compared to Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites. Over the years neighborhoods have seen gradual ethnic change with White ethnic neighborhoods like Brighton Park transitioning to Hispanic, while former Latino neighborhoods like West Town transition to majority non-Hispanic White.\n\n\nThe vast majority of Chicago Hispanics are of Mexican descent. As of the 2010 Census, 578,100 residents of the City of Chicago, had full or partial Mexican origins.[10]\n\n\nThe Chicago metropolitan area has the third largest African American population, behind only New York City and Atlanta.\n\n\n\n![](image)A thematic map of African American population centers.\n![](image)The African American population by census tract\nThe main ethnic groups in Chicago include Irish, German, Italian, Mexican, Assyrian, Arab, Bangladeshi, Jews, English, Bosnian, Croatian, Bulgarian, Czech, Greek, Black, Korean, Chinese, Indian, Filipino, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Albanian, Pakistani, Polish, Hungarian, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Swedish, Ukrainian, Dutch, Belgian, Cuban, Vietnamese, and Puerto Rican.\n\n\nChicago has a large Irish American population, with many still residing on the South Side. The early years of Chicago coincided with the significant rise in Irish immigration in the 1830s and 1840s. Some Irish already lived in Chicago when it was incorporated as a city in 1837. In the next few years Irish numbers grew rapidly, particularly after the arrival of refugees from the Great Famine. By 1850 Irish immigrants accounted for about one-fifth of the city's population. Many of the city's politicians are descendants of this group, including previous mayor Richard M. Daley. The Irish were able to assert themselves in politics due to their large population but also the fact that they knew English and that \u2013 thanks to the geographic position of Ireland on the periphery of Europe \u2013 they did not have ancestral ethnic rivalries. As the old saying went, *\"A Lithuanian won\u2019t vote for a Pole, and a Pole won\u2019t vote for a Lithuanian. A German won\u2019t vote for either of them. But all three will vote for a turkey. \u2013 an Irishman.\" Only the WASPs hated the Irish, and the WASPs all lived on the North Shore.\"*[11] The Irish gained entry to Chicago's Fire and Police Departments and have kept family traditions of participation in these units. The Irish laid the foundations for many of the city's Roman Catholic churches, schools and hospitals. The Irish are still very active in the city's politics.\n\n\nGermans have constituted a major portion of ethnic whites in Chicago since the beginning of the city's history. When the Great Plains opened up for settlement in the 1830s and 1840s, many German immigrants stopped in Chicago to earn additional money before moving West to claim a homestead. Those with skills in demand could\u2014and often did\u2014stay. From 1850, when Germans constituted one-sixth of Chicago's population, until the turn of the 20th century, people of German descent constituted the largest ethnic group in the city, followed by Irish, Poles, and Swedes. In 1900, 470,000 Chicagoans\u2014one out of every four residents\u2014had either been born in Germany or had a parent born there. Although their numbers dropped because of reduced emigration from Germany and because World War I had made it unpopular to acknowledge one's German heritage, 22 percent of Chicago's population still did so in 1920.[12] One of the most distinct of these German groups were the Volga Germans, or ethnic Germans having lived along the Volga River in Russia. They largely clustered in Jefferson Park on the city's Northwest Side, coming to the area mostly between the years 1907\u20131920. By 1930 450 families of Volga German heritage were living in the Jefferson Park area, most of whom originated from *Wiesenseite*.[13] Chicago also hosts the headquarters of the largest Lutheran body in the United States, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.[14] [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bobak's Sausage Company's former Polish supermarket on the Southwest Side of ChicagoThe city has one of the largest Assyrian Diaspora populations, with the Assyrian community of Metropolitan Chicago numbering as many as 80,000.[15] The Patriarchal see of the Assyrian Church of the East was based in Chicago for several decades up until 2015 when it was moved to Erbil.\n\n\nThe city is the home to a large Romanian American community with more than 100,000.[16]\n\n\nPolish people have been prevalent from the city's early history, but the largest waves of immigration were in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; they have been influential in the economic and social development of Chicago. This is one of the most important centers of Polonia. The Taste of Polonia Festival in Jefferson Park celebrates Polish culture annually on Labor Day weekend.[17] The Southwest Side is home to the largest concentration of Gorals (Carpathian highlanders) outside Europe. The southwest side is also the location of the Polish Highlanders Alliance of North America. Many Polish churches are found in Chicago, built in the Polish Cathedral style of architecture. Some can be seen from the Kennedy Expressway, other roadways, and public transportation routes, as well as from the neighborhood streets.\n\n\nChicago has one of the largest concentrations of Italian Americans in the US, with more than 500,000 living in the metropolitan area.[18] Chicago has the third largest Italian American population in the United States, behind only New York City and Philadelphia. Chicago's Italian community has historically been based along the Taylor Street and Grand Avenue corridors on the West Side of the city. There are also significant Italian populations scattered throughout the city and surrounding suburbs.\n\n\nOther prevalent European ethnic groups include the Czechs, and Ukrainians. At the turn of the 20th century, Chicago was the third-largest Czech city in the world, after Prague and Vienna.[19] There are approximately 14,000 Ukrainians living within the Chicago city limits.[20] Chicago has a small community of Swedish Americans. Swedish Americans make up 0.9% of Chicago's population, and they number at 23,990.[21] After the Great Chicago Fire, many Swedish carpenters helped to rebuild the city, which led to the saying \"the Swedes built Chicago.\"[22] Swedish influence is evident in Andersonville on the far north side.\n\n\n\n![](image)A demographic map of Chicago, 1950.\nThe city has a large population of Bulgarians, Lithuanians,[23] Croats, Jews, Greeks and Serbs. Chicago has a sizeable Romanian American community,[16] As of 2018[update], the Lithuanian population is over 100,000 and was formerly over 300,000; the world's oldest continuously published Lithuanian-language newspaper *Draugus* is based in Chicago.[24] The city is the seat of the Evangelical Covenant Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.[14]\n[25]\n\n\nChicago has the third-largest South Asian population in the United States, especially many Indians, Bangladeshi and Pakistanis. The Devon Avenue corridor on the far north side is one of the largest South Asian neighborhoods/markets in North America. As of the 2010 Census, Chicago has the third-largest Puerto Rican population in the continental United States,[26] after New York City and Philadelphia, and the fourth largest Mexican population in the United States after Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston.[27] There are about 185,000 Arabs in Cook County with another 75,000 in the five surrounding counties. Chicago is the center of the Palestinian and Jordanian immigrant communities in the United States,[28][29] and additionally has a large Assyrian population.\n\n\nThere is a substantial Romani community in Chicago. The Roma first came to Chicago during the large waves of Southern and Eastern European immigration to the United States in the 1880s until World War I. They were following Serbian and Hungarian immigrants who found work in the steel mills and factories of the city.[30]\n\n\n\n### Bosnian population[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Bosnians in Chicago\n\nThe first Bosnians settled in Chicago in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, joining other immigrants seeking better opportunities and better lives. As the former Yugoslavia continued to find its identity as a nation over the last century, the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina sought stability and new beginnings in the city of Chicago many intending to return to their homeland. Bosnian Muslims were early leaders in the establishment of Chicago's Muslim community. In 1906, they established Dzemijetul Hajrije (The Benevolent Society) of Illinois to preserve the community's religious and national traditions as well as to provide mutual assistance for funerals and illness. The organization established chapters in Gary, Indiana, in 1913, and Butte, Montana, in 1916, and is the oldest existing Muslim organization in the United States.[31] The Bosnians were the first Muslims in the United States to incorporate an Islamic Association in 1906 in Chicago, Illinois.[32] Today, Chicago and St. Louis are tied for the largest Bosnian population in the United States and the largest Bosnian population outside of Europe, with 70,000 in each city. [33] [34] 40,000 of them came as refugees during the 1990s and early 2000s.[35]\n\n\n\n### American Community Survey[edit]\n\n\nThe city saw an increase of 20,606 people from July 1, 2007 to July 1, 2008, according to census data.
