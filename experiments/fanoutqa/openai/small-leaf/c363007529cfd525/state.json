He is the most successful and most decorated Olympian of all time[7] with a total of 28 medals.[8] Phelps also holds the all-time records for Olympic gold medals (23),[9] Olympic gold medals in individual events (13), and Olympic medals in individual events (16).[10] At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Phelps tied the record of eight medals of any color at a single Games, held by gymnast Alexander Dityatin, by winning six gold and two bronze medals. Four years later, when he won eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games, he broke fellow American swimmer Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven first-place finishes at any single Olympic Games. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps won four gold and two silver medals, and at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he won five gold medals and one silver. This made him the most successful athlete of the Games for the fourth Olympics in a row.[11][12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe relationship between Le Clos and Phelps had been cordial back in 2012\u201313 but it deteriorated in 2014 when Phelps came back from retirement and suggested that the current butterfly times were slow.[242] In the ready room prior to the preliminary race, Le Clos's shadow boxing while Phelps \"glowered in a corner\" spawned the Internet meme with the hashtag #PhelpsFace.[243] At age 31, the victory made Phelps not only the oldest male champion,[244] but also the oldest individual champion in Olympic swimming history,[245] beating the records set by Duke Kahanamoku in 1920, and Inge de Bruijn in 2004 respectively. Phelps also became the first swimmer to win individual gold medals 12 years apart.[246] Both these records were broken by Anthony Ervin three days later.[247][248]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n217. **^** \"2012 London Olympics: Michael Phelps Leads All Swimmers With Six Medals\". *Swimming World*.

My sisters and myself fell in love with the sport, and we decided to swim.\"[26] When Phelps was in the sixth grade, he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).[27][28] By the age of 10, he held a national record for his age group (in the 100-meter butterfly)[29] and began to train at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club under coach Bob Bowman. More age group records followed, and as of August 21, 2018, Phelps still held 11 age group records, eight in long course,[30] and three in short course.[31]\n\n\n\n## Swimming career[edit]\n\n\n### Training[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Her father was killed at the Battle of Stalingrad, where he served as a machine gun operator.[3] She first practiced ballet, but turned to gymnastics after her choreographer moved out of Kherson. She graduated from high school in 1953, and moved to Kyiv. She attended the Lenin Polytechnic Institute, and continued her training at the Burevestnik VSS. At the age of 19, she debuted internationally at the 1954 Rome World Championships, winning the gold medal in the team competition.\n\n\n\n## Gymnastics career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Latynina during the vault award ceremony at the 1964 Olympics\nIn 1956, at the age of 21, Latynina made her Olympic debut at the Melbourne Olympic Games. In the all-around event, she fought off stiff competition to win gold. She finished first in the vault, second in the uneven bars hand in the exercise on the floor and fourth in the balancing beam. She also led the Soviet Union in Team Event to victory.[4]\n\n\nAfter a very successful World Championships in 1958 (winning five out of six titles despite competing whilst four months pregnant and medaling in every event), Latynina was the favorite for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.[5] In the all-around event, she led the Soviet Union to take the first four places, thereby also securing a win in the team competition by a margin of nine points. Latynina defended her floor title, took silver medals in the balance beam and uneven bars events, and bronze in the vault competition.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| USSR World Trials |  | 6 |  |  |

She is the only woman to have won nine gold medals.[6] She is also the only female athlete who at some point has held the record for most Olympic gold medals. Additionally, within the sport of gymnastics, she is the only woman who has won an all-around medal in more than two Olympiads, the only woman who has won an individual event (floor exercise) in more than two Olympiads, and one of only three women who have won every individual event at either the World Championship or Olympic level.

The jury states that the Fair Play Mecenate is awarded Marit Bj\u00f8rgen \"for the particular ethical and fair play behaviour that you have always had both in your agonistic career and in your demonstrations of great sportsmanship and solidarity\".[11]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Marit Bj\u00f8rgen in Otep\u00e4\u00e4 during the 2005\u201306 FIS Cross-Country World Cup\nBj\u00f8rgen made the podium eight times during the 2005\u201306 season, six of them in first place, one second and one third place. Bj\u00f8rgen now has 70 podium finishes, 46 of them in first place, 13 in second and 11 in third. 22 of her victories have been in the sprint, which is by far her most successful event. Seven of these victories were in the 2003\u201304 season and they have decreased in the past few seasons whilst her results in the other disciplines have improved. She has nine victories in the 10\u00a0km and seven in the pursuit. Her four other victories have been in longer races (30\u00a0km. and Vasaloppet).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBj\u00f8rgen won gold at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi in the 15 km skiathlon, the Team sprint and the 30km freestyle race. These three Olympic medals brought her total up to ten, equaling the record for most Winter Olympic medals held by a woman, already achieved by Stefania Belmondo and Raisa Smetanina; but of the three record holders at the time, Bj\u00f8rgen had the most golds.[8]\n\n\nBj\u00f8rgen is a five-time Olympian, having competed in every Winter Olympics since Salt Lake City in 2002 where she won her first silver medal. At the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang she won her 11th\u201315th Olympic medals, the highest number of medals won by any athlete in Winter Olympics history.[9]\n\n\n\n## Holmenkollen[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBj\u00f8rgen has competed in the World Cup since 2000, when she finished the season in 53rd place overall and 48th in the sprints. The season after she finished the overall season in 32nd and the sprint in 36th. The season after however (2002\u201303) she won the sprint title and finished in 6th place overall. The 2003\u201304 season was Bj\u00f8rgen's best season up until that time when she again won the sprint title, and came 11th in the distance standings, finishing the season in 2nd place behind Gabriella Paruzzi. In the 2004\u201305 season she won all the titles, and again won the overall and sprint title in 2005\u201306.\nIn 2011\u201312 she claimed the overall title for the third time, ahead of Poland's Justyna Kowalczyk.\n\n\nIn 2015 Bj\u00f8rgen won her first Tour de Ski after nine attempts, defeating reigning champion and compatriot Therese Johaug by over one and a half minutes.[6]\n\n\n\n## World Championships[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Marit Bj\u00f8rgen celebrates sprint gold at the 2010 Olympics\nBj\u00f8rgen had a disappointing Winter Olympics in Turin. She suffered from bronchitis a week before the games started and was prescribed antibiotics, then in the first race of the games, the 7.5\u00a0km + 7.5\u00a0km double pursuit, Bj\u00f8rgen withdrew during the classic phase complaining of an upset stomach. In the next event, the team sprint, Bj\u00f8rgen and Hilde G. Pedersen came fourth, and despite winning a silver in the 10\u00a0km, the remainder of the games went poorly for her. The next event was the 4 \u00d7 5\u00a0km relay, where Bj\u00f8rgen took the anchor leg and finished in fifth place, the first time since 1988 that Norway had failed to reach the podium in the women's relay. In the individual sprint, Bj\u00f8rgen failed to make the semi-finals, and both Bj\u00f8rgen and Pedersen decided not to compete in the 30\u00a0km and returned home to Norway. Afterwards she was quoted as saying she was \"sick and tired of Pragelato and OL (Olympic games)\".[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the World Championships 2011, held at Holmenkollen, Oslo, during February and March 2011, Bj\u00f8rgen won gold medals in the Sprint, the 10-kilometre classic, the 15-kilometre pursuit and the 4 \u00d7 5-kilometre relay. She also finished second to Therese Johaug in the 30-kilometre freestyle.\n\n\n\n## Olympics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever Bj\u00f8rgen recovered to win the 45\u00a0km Vasaloppet from Oxberg to Mora on 4 March, eight days after the end of the Winter Olympics. Bj\u00f8rgen broke away with Hilde Pedersen and Vibeke Skofterud after only 10\u00a0km, but Skofterud could not keep up with the pace and fell back, and Bj\u00f8rgen powered away from Pedersen with a few kilometres left, winning in a time of 2:17:53, 1:22 ahead of Pedersen and 3:23 ahead of Petra Majdi\u010d of Slovenia. Winning a purse of 88,000 SEK and also winning two of the three sprints during the race to add another 10,000 SEK. Then three days later on 7 March, Bj\u00f8rgen finished second in the individual sprint event in Borl\u00e4nge, Sweden.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2007: Frode Estil (NOR), Odd-Bj\u00f8rn Hjelmeset (NOR), Harald V (NOR), Sonja (NOR), Simon Ammann (SUI)\n* 2010: Marit Bj\u00f8rgen (NOR)\n* 2011: Ole Einar Bj\u00f8rndalen (NOR), Michael Greis (GER), Andrea Henkel (GER), Janne Ahonen (FIN)\n* 2012: Magdalena Neuner (GER), Emil Hegle Svendsen (NOR)\n* 2013: Tora Berger (NOR), Martin Fourcade (FRA), Therese Johaug (NOR), Gregor Schlierenzauer (AUT)\n* 2014: Magnus Moan (NOR), Eric Frenzel (GER), Thomas Morgenstern (AUT), Darya Domracheva (BLR)\n* 2015: Eldar R\u00f8nning (NOR), Anders Bardal (NOR), Anette Sagen (NOR), Kamil Stoch (POL)\n* 2016: Noriaki Kasai (JPN), Tarjei B\u00f8 (NOR)\n* 2017: Marie Dorin Habert (FRA), Sara Takanashi (JPN)\n* 2018: Charlotte Kalla (SWE), Princess Astrid (NOR), Hannu Manninen (FIN), Kaisa M\u00e4k\u00e4r\u00e4inen (FIN)\n* 2021: Maren Lundby (NOR), Johannes Thingnes B\u00f8 (NOR), Dario Cologna (SWI), Johannes Rydzek (GER)\n* 2022: Tiril Eckhoff (NOR), Marte Olsbu R\u00f8iseland (NOR), Johannes H\u00f8sflot Kl\u00e6bo (NOR), J\u00f8rgen Graabak  (NOR)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBj\u00f8rgen has eighteen World Championship gold medals, twelve of them individual.

In 1990\u20131992 he also coached the Soviet senior gymnastics team, and in 1990\u20131993 headed the Soviet and later the Russian Gymnastics Federation.[1]\n\n\nIn 2001, Andrianov was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame.[1] Between 1994 and 2002 he coached the Japan Olympic gymnastics team, on the invitation of his former rival, Mitsuo Tsukahara. Andrianov coached Tsukahara's son, Naoya Tsukahara, and both father and son credit him with raising Naoya's skills and confidence to equip him to compete at the international level.[6] In 2002 he became the director of gymnastics at the N.G.

He dominated the 1976 gymnastics competition, winning four golds, including the all-around, two silvers, and a bronze.[3] These medals included golds in the floor exercises, rings, and vault, as well as a prized gold in the 1976 all-around. His record of four gymnastic golds at a single games stood until Vitaly Scherbo won six other medals in 1992.[4]\n\n\nAndrianov took the Olympic Oath for athletes at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. In the gymnastics competition, he won two more golds, two silvers, and a bronze.[3] Andrianov's golds in that Olympics were in the vault and team competition, his silvers were in the all-around and floor exercises, and his bronze medal was in the horizontal bar.[5] He retired shortly after that year's Olympics.[3]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn many other rankings among all-time medal winners at the Olympic, World, and European levels, he ranks very high (for example, he is second only to Vitaly Scherbo in total individual medal counts at either the gold level or any level at the combined Olympic and World levels as well as at the combined Olympic, World, and European levels), easily making him one of the most decorated gymnasts of all time.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and Olympic career[edit]\n\n\nAndrianov entered the Children and Youth Sports School of the Burevestnik sports society in Vladimir at age 11. His first international success came in 1971 at the European Championships in Madrid, where he won two gold medals. Between 1971 and 1980 he won many international gymnastics competitions, including the Olympic Games, world championships and European championships.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe held the record for men for the most Olympic medals at 15 (7 gold medals, 5 silver medals, 3 bronze medals) until Michael Phelps surpassed him at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics. Andrianov is the third athlete (male or female) in cumulative Olympic medals after Phelps's 28 and Larisa Latynina's 18. Andrianov won the most medals at the 1976 Summer Olympics with 6 individual medals and one team medal. Within the sport of Men's Artistic Gymnastics, he also holds the men's record for most individual Olympic medals (12) and shares the male record for most individual Olympic gold medals in gymnastics (6) with Boris Shakhlin and Dmitry Bilozerchev (the latter of which only if you count the 1984 Alternate Olympics). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **1980 ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\u00a0(URS)**:
