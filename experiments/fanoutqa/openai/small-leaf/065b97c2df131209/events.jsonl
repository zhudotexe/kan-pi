He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990.\nThe Dallas Cowboys are a professional American football team based in Frisco, Texas. Their stadium is located in Arlington, Texas. They are members of the Eastern Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The Cowboys franchise was founded in 1960 as an expansion team.[1] The team played their games in the Cotton Bowl from 1960 to 1970, then in Texas Stadium from 1971 to 2008, and AT&T Stadium from 2009 to present.\n\n\nThere have been nine head coaches for the Dallas Cowboys. Three coaches have won Super Bowls with the team: Tom Landry in Super Bowl VI and XII, Jimmy Johnson in Super Bowl XXVII and XXVIII, and Barry Switzer in Super Bowl XXX.[2] Landry is the team's all-time leader in games coached and wins, and Switzer leads all coaches in winning percentage with .625. Dave Campo is the only Cowboys coach with a losing record (.313), and is also the only coach in franchise history to have never posted a winning season. The team's first coach, Tom Landry, has been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[3] The most recent coach (before the current) was Jason Garrett who replaced Wade Phillips on November 8, 2010.[4] The current coach is Mike McCarthy, who replaced Jason Garrett on January 6, 2020.[5]\nBill Parcells 2003-2006\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **#** | Number of coaches[N 1] |\n| **Yrs** | Years coached\n |\n| **First** | First season coached\n |\n| **Last** | Last season coached\n |\n| **GC** | Games Coached\n |\n| **W** | Wins\n |\n| **L** | Loses\n |\n| **T** | Ties\n |\n| **W%** | Win – Loss percentage\n |\n| 00\\*†\n | Elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a coach andspent entire NFL head coaching career with the Cowboys\n |\n| 00†\n | Elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a coach\n |\n| 00\\*\n | Spent entire NFL head coaching career with the Cowboys\n |\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\n*Note: Statistics are accurate through end of the 2022 NFL season.*\n\n\n| #\n | Image\n | Name\n | Term[N 2] | Regular season\n | Playoffs\n | Accomplishments\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Yrs\n | First\n | Last\n | GC\n | W\n | L\n | T\n | W%\n | GC\n | W\n | L\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | Tom Landry\\*† | 28\n | 1960 | 1988 | 418\n | 250\n | 162\n | 6\n | .605\n | 36\n | 20\n | 16\n | **Inducted Pro Football Hall of Fame (1990)** 2 Super Bowl Championships (VI, XII)  5 NFC Championships (1970, 1971, 1975, 1977, 1978) 1 NFL Eastern Championship (1966)12 NFC East Championships (1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1985)18 Playoff Berths 1 AP Coach of the Year Award (1966)[6]1 Sporting News Coach of the Year Award (1966)[6]1 UPI NFL Coach of the Year Award (1966)[6] 1 UPI NFC Coach of the Year Award (1975)[6] | [7] |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Jimmy Johnson† | 5\n | 1989 | 1993 | 80\n | 44\n | 36\n | 0\n | .550\n | 8\n | 7\n | 1\n | **Inducted Pro Football Hall of Fame (2020)** 2 Super Bowl Championships (XXVII, XXVIII)  2 NFC Championships (1992, 1993)2 NFC East Championships (1992, 1993)3 Playoff Berths  1 AP Coach of the Year Award (1990)[6]1 UPI NFC Coach of the Year Award (1990)[6] | [8] |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | Barry Switzer\\*\n | 4\n | 1994 | 1997 | 64\n | 40\n | 24\n | 0\n | .625\n | 7\n | 5\n | 2\n |  1 Super Bowl Championship (XXX)  1 NFC Championship (1995)3 NFC East Championships (1994, 1995, 1996)3 Playoff Berths  | [9] |\n| 4\n |  | Chan Gailey | 2\n | 1998 | 1999 | 32\n | 18\n | 14\n | 0\n | .563\n | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n | 1 NFC East Championship (1998)2 Playoff Berths  | [10] |\n| 5\n |  | Dave Campo\\*\n | 3\n | 2000 | 2002 | 48\n | 15\n | 33\n | 0\n | .313\n | —\n |  | [11] |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | Bill Parcells† | 4\n | 2003 | 2006 | 64\n | 34\n | 30\n | 0\n | .531\n | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n | **Inducted Pro Football Hall of Fame (2013)**2 Playoff Berths  | [12] |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | Wade Phillips | 4\n | 2007 | 2010[N 3] | 56\n | 34\n | 22\n | 0\n | .607\n | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2 NFC East Championships (2007, 2009)2 Playoff Berths  | [13] |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Jason Garrett\\*\n | 10\n | 2010[N 3] | 2019 | 152\n | 85\n | 67\n | 0\n | .559\n | 5\n | 2\n | 3\n | 3 NFC East Championships (2014, 2016, 2018)3 Playoff Berths  1 AP Coach of the Year Award (2016)  | [14] |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | Mike McCarthy | 3\n | 2020 | *present* | 50\n | 30\n | 20\n | 0\n | .600\n | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1 NFC East Championship (2021)2 Playoff Berth | [15] |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** A running total of the number of coaches of the Cowboys.

They are a member of the East Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The team began as the Boston Patriots in the American Football League, a league which merged with the National Football League before the 1970 season.[1]\n\n\nThere have been 14 head coaches for the Patriots franchise. Lou Saban became the first coach of the Patriots in 1960, although he was fired part way through their second season.[2] Bill Belichick, the current coach since 2000, has led the team for more regular season games (288), post-season games (37) and more complete seasons (18) than any other head coach. His 214 wins with the Patriots are far and away the most in franchise history, more than three times those of runner-up Mike Holovak. Belichick has also led the team to nine of their eleven Super Bowl appearances, winning six of them. Holovak, Raymond Berry and Bill Parcells all led the Patriots to league championship games, with only one coach failing to reach the Super Bowl. Five Patriots head coaches, Holovak, Chuck Fairbanks, Berry, Parcells, and Belichick, have been named coach of the year by at least one major news organization. Additionally, Raymond Berry is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 1973, eleven years before he became the Patriots' head coach.[3]\n\n\nTwice in Patriots history there were \"interim\" head coaches. In 1972, John Mazur resigned with five games left in the season.[4] Phil Bengtson was named as the interim head coach for the rest of the season, during which he only won one game, and he was not made the permanent coach the next year. In 1978, head coach Fairbanks secretly made a deal to leave the team to coach the University of Colorado Buffaloes while he was still coaching Patriots. Team owner Billy Sullivan suspended Fairbanks for the final game of the regular season, stating \"You cannot serve two masters,\" and Ron Erhardt and Hank Bullough took co-head coaching responsibilities for that game.[5] Fairbanks was reinstated when the team qualified for the playoffs, and he lost the first playoff game, his last for the Patriots.\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **#** | Number of coaches\n |\n| **GC** | Games coached\n |\n| **W** | Wins\n |\n| **L** | Losses\n |\n| **T** | Ties\n |\n| **Win%** | Winning percentage |\n| 00†\n | Elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a coach\n |\n| 00‡\n | Elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a player\n |\n| 00\\*\n | Spent entire NFL head coaching career with the Patriots\n |\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\n*Note: Statistics are accurate through the end of the 2021 NFL season.*\n\n\n| #\n | Image\n | Name\n | Term\n | Regular season\n | Playoffs\n | Awards\n | Reference\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GC\n | W\n | L\n | T\n | Win%\n | GC\n | W\n | L\n |\n| **Boston Patriots** |\n| 1\n |  | Lou Saban | 1960–1961 | 19\n | 7\n | 12\n | 0\n | .368\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  | [6] |\n| 2\n |  | Mike Holovak | 1961–1968 | 107\n | 52\n | 46\n | 9\n | .528\n | 2\n | 1\n | 1\n | UPI AFL Coach of the Year (1966)[7] | [8] |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | Clive Rush\\*\n | 1969–1970 | 21\n | 5\n | 16\n | 0\n | .238\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  | [9] |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | John Mazur\\*\n | 1970 | 7\n | 1\n | 6\n | 0\n | .143\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  | [4] |\n| **New England Patriots** |\n| —\n | ![](image) | John Mazur\\*\n | 1971–1972 | 23\n | 8\n | 15\n | 0\n | .348\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  | [4] |\n| 5\n |  | Phil Bengtson | 1972[10] | 5\n | 1\n | 4\n | 0\n | .200\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  | [11] |\n| 6\n |  | Chuck Fairbanks\\*\n | 1973–1978[12] | 85\n | 46\n | 39\n | 0\n | .541\n | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n | UPI NFL Coach of the Year (1976)[13]\nSporting News NFL Coach of the Year (1976)\n | [14] |\n| 7\n |  | Ron Erhardt | 1979–1981[15] | 49\n | 21\n | 28\n | 0\n | .428\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  | [16] |\n| 8\n |  | Ron Meyer | 1982–1984 | 33\n | 18\n | 15\n | 0\n | .545\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |  | [17] |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | Raymond Berry \\*‡\n | 1984–1989\\*\n | 87\n | 48\n | 39\n | 0\n | .551\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | UPI NFL Coach of the Year (1985)AFC Championship (1985)\n | [18][19] |\n| 10\n |  | Rod Rust\\*\n | 1990 | 16\n | 1\n | 15\n | 0\n | .062\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  | [20] |\n| 11\n |  | Dick MacPherson\\*\n | 1991–1992 | 32\n | 8\n | 24\n | 0\n | .250\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  | [21] |\n| 12\n | ![](image) | Bill Parcells† | 1993–1996 | 64\n | 32\n | 32\n | 0\n | .500\n | 4\n | 2\n | 2\n | AP NFL Coach of the Year (1994)\nPro Football Weekly NFL Coach of the Year (1994)\nMaxwell Football Club NFL Coach of the Year (1994)\nUPI NFL Coach of the Year (1994)\nAFC Championship (1996)\n | [22][23] |\n| 13\n | ![](image) | Pete Carroll | 1997–1999 | 48\n | 27\n | 21\n | 0\n | .562\n | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n |  | [24] |\n| 14\n | ![](image) | Bill Belichick | 2000–present\n | 370\n | 262\n | 108\n | 0\n | .708\n | 41\n | 30\n | 12\n | AP NFL Coach of the Year (2003, 2007, 2010)\nSporting News NFL Coach of the Year (2003)\nPro Football Weekly NFL Coach of the Year (2003)\nMaxwell Football Club NFL Coach of the Year (2007)\nPFWA Executive of the Year (2021)\n6 Super Bowl Championships (2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016, 2018)\n9 AFC Championships (2001, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2011, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018)\n | [25][26] |\n\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Boston Patriots\".
