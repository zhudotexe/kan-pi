He was invited to audition by Kenneth Branagh, the film's director, after having previously worked with Branagh on *Ivanov* and *Wallander*. Hiddleston said of Branagh, \"Ken has had a life-changing effect. He was able to say to the executives, 'Trust me on this, you can cast Tom and he will deliver'. It was massive and it's completely changed the course of what is available to me to do. Ken gave me my break.\"[26] He originally auditioned for the role of Thor, recalling, \"That was what I was being considered for, because I'm tall and blonde and classically trained, and that seemed to be the mold for what Thor was, he was to be a classical character. And it was in my auditions. I owe this entirely to Marvel and their open-mindedness, they saw something that they thought was interesting. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe started his film career in the Joanna Hogg films *Unrelated* (2007) and *Archipelago* (2010). In 2011, Hiddleston portrayed F.
