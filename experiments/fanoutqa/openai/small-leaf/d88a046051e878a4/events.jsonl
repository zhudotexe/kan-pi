Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 820,388 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of about 800,213.\n\n\nThe distribution of change in population growth is uneven in the State of New York; the New York City metropolitan area is growing considerably, along with Saratoga County, and Western New York. The rest of the state is nearly stagnant. According to immigration statistics, the state is a leading recipient of migrants from around the globe. Since 2005, immigration failed to surpass emigration, a trend that was reversed since 2006. The State of New York lost two house seats in the 2011 congressional reapportionment, secondary to relatively slow growth when compared to the rest of the United States.\n\n\nThe center of population of New York is located in Orange County, in the town of Deerpark. Roughly 64% of the state's population lives in the New York City metropolitan area and 40% in New York City alone.[3]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Manhattan Chinatown (紐約華埠). Chinese people constitute the fastest-growing demographic nationality in New York State.[4][5][6]\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nThe State of New York has a primarily urban population. The largest city in the state is New York City, which is also one of the world's most ethnically diverse and cosmopolitan cities. Additional major urban centers include Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Utica. The state has 62 counties; the most populated one is Kings County (Brooklyn).\n\n\nThe intense development, urbanization and suburban sprawl of New York City makes it the most populated region in New York and the collective U.S., an estimated 20 to 30 million in the eight-state Megalopolis stretching 500 miles from Boston to Washington, D.C., with New York City in the middle has 15 million residents in a 100-mile radius including Philadelphia (1.5 million in its city limits), northern New Jersey and Connecticut. A simple majority of New York's population lives within two hours of New York City. According to the July 1, 2004 Census Bureau Estimate,[7] New York City and its six closest New York State satellite counties (Suffolk, Nassau, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam and Orange) have a combined population of 12,626,200 people, or 65.67% of the state's population.\n\n\n\n### Age[edit]\n\n\nIn age demographics: 6.5% of New York's population were under 5 years of age, 24.7% under 18, and 12.9% were 65 or older. Females made up 51.8% of the population. New York state has a fluctuating population growth rate, it has experienced some shrinkage in the 1970s and 1980s, but milder growth in the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century.\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2000 U.S. Census, 13.61% of the population aged 5 and older speak Spanish at home, while 2.04% speak Chinese (including Cantonese and Mandarin), 1.65% Italian, and 1.23% Russian.[8]\n\n\n\n### 2020 Census[edit]\n\n\nThe State of New York in the 2020 Census had a population of 20,201,249 and the racial makeup was 52.5% Non-Hispanic White, 19.5% Hispanic or Latino, 14.8% Black, 9.6% Asian, 0.7% Native American, and 0.1% Pacific Islander.[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)New York ethnic distribution, 2000\nAccording to 2004 estimates, 20.4% of the population was foreign-born. Among cities in the State of New York, 36% of New York City's population is foreign-born; this figure of approximately 3 million is a higher total number of foreign-born residents than any other U.S. city. This number is often around 20% in other cities across New York.\n\n\nIn the 2000 Census, Italian Americans make up the largest ancestral ethnic group in Staten Island and Long Island, followed by Irish Americans and Polish Americans. Manhattan's leading ethnic ancestry group is Dominicans since the 2000 census, followed by Irish Americans, then Italian Americans and more than 200 ethnicities are counted, plus comparably large numbers of residents with Dutch, Portuguese, Greek, Russian, and Swedish ethnic ancestry. Albany and the Mohawk Valley-Central New York are heavily Irish American and Italian American. In Buffalo and Western New York, German Americans are the largest ethnic group, along with Polish Americans and other Slavic ethnic groups; in the northern tip of the state the largest ethnic background is that of French Canadians. New York State has a higher number of Italian-Americans than any other U.S. state. New York City is also said to be home to two million of Italian descent alone. NYC was once called home to the largest German, Greek, Irish, Italian, Polish and Russian communities outside their representative countries of origin.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nConfusingly, the term American Jew is used to describe ethnic Jews by some demographers, and religious identity (religious Jews, see: Judaism) of various nationalities and various denominations by others. Regardless, collectively most are American-born and are a major social presence in New York. An estimated 1 to 2 million alone in New York City and another 1 to 1.5 million live in surrounding areas, sometimes New York is referred to as the \"world's largest Jewish city\" since the mid-19th century. The first wave of Jewish immigrants in New York are of Sephardic origin, a scant 10,000 from the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Portugal in the 17th and 18th centuries, but in the 19th century more newcomers were first German and finally in the early 20th century millions from Eastern Europe like Poland and Russia, both of Ashkenazi origin. In the late 20th century, a smaller wave of Russian Jews and Ukrainian Jews settled in the Brighton Beach section in Brooklyn, and New York has many Israeli-American residents.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNew York contains the largest Puerto Rican population in the contiguous United States, concentrated in parts of New York City such as the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Manhattan. New York also has the largest Dominican population in the country, concentrated in New York City's Upper Manhattan and the Bronx. New York City is home to many with roots in Caribbean Islands like Jamaica, Barbados, Guyana, Trinidad and Haiti, as well as recent immigrants from Sub-Saharan African countries.\n\n\nAt 520,000 of the State of New York's over 600,000 Chinese Americans, New York City has a higher total number of Chinese Americans than Los Angeles County. New York also has the highest and growing proportion of Pakistani Americans and Bangladeshi Americans in the country, and a very high Indian American community, mainly concentrated in New York City.\n\n\n\n#### US Racial-assignment System[edit]\n\n\n\n\nDemographics of New York (csv)\n| By race | White\n | Black\n | AIAN\\*\n | Asian\n | NHPI\\*\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2000 (total population)\n | 75.62%\n | 18.39%\n | 0.95%\n | 6.27%\n | 0.17%\n |\n| 2000 (Hispanic only)\n | 12.30%\n | 2.65%\n | 0.31%\n | 0.14%\n | 0.07%\n |\n| 2005 (total population)\n | 74.98%\n | 18.26%\n | 0.99%\n | 7.18%\n | 0.19%\n |\n| 2005 (Hispanic only)\n | 13.31%\n | 2.66%\n | 0.32%\n | 0.15%\n | 0.07%\n |\n| Growth 2000–05 (total population)\n | 0.62%\n | 0.74%\n | 5.06%\n | 16.18%\n | 15.92%\n |\n| Growth 2000–05 (non-Hispanic only)\n | -1.17%\n | 0.57%\n | 5.47%\n | 16.35%\n | 16.88%\n |\n| Growth 2000–05 (Hispanic only)\n | 9.81%\n | 1.72%\n | 4.23%\n | 8.64%\n | 14.40%\n |\n| \\* AIAN is American Indian or Alaskan Native; NHPI is Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander\n |\n\n\nAs of the 2010 census, the State of New York has a population of 19,378,102. Broken down via US Census Racial classifications, this includes 12,740,974 (65.7%) white, 3,073,800 (15.9%) black, 1,420,244 (7.3%) Asian, 8,766 (0.0%) Pacific Islander, and 1,441,563 (7.4%) of other races. 585,849 (3.0%) have two or more races. Hispanics and Latinos of all \"races\" make up 3,416,922 (17.6%) of the state's population; non-Hispanic whites make up 58.3% of the state's population.\n\n\nThe Bronx has a large population of blacks that are of Latin American origin, but so does northern Manhattan (Harlem) and Brooklyn which had American-born black majorities since the 1920s, as well the largest African American population of any state. New York City has 1 million of New York State's 1.4 million Asian Americans. Cities such as Buffalo and Rochester are predominantly made of African Americans, Hispanic, and various European and near-European ethnic groups. Southeast Asians, Eastern European and North/Central Asian, African and Caribbeans also have a noticeable presence.\n\n\nAmong the State of New York's cities, as of 2010 according to the US Racial System, New York City is 44% white(33%non hispanic white),28% Latino, 25% African American, and 13% percent Asian American.

Its residents include people from a wide variety of ethnic, racial, national and religious backgrounds. The state has attracted immigrants, particularly from Latin America.[8] Florida's majority ethnic group are European Americans, with approximately 65% of the population identifying as White. National ethnic communities in the state include Cubans, who migrated *en masse* following the revolution in the mid 20th century. They have been joined by other immigrants from Latin America, and Spanish is spoken by more than 20% of the state's population, with high usage especially in the Miami-Dade County area.\n\n\nBetween the 2010 and 2020 census, 50 counties would experience growth in their population while 17 counties saw their populations decline.

California's Asian population is estimated at 4.9 million, approximately one-third of the nation's estimated 15 million Asian Americans. California's Native American population of 285,512 is the third-largest of any state, behind Arizona and Oklahoma.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to 2018 U.S. Census Bureau estimates, California's population was 59.5% White (36.6% Non-Hispanic White), 14.7% Asian, 13.8% Some Other Race, 5.8% Black or African American, 0.8% Native American and Alaskan Native, 0.4% Pacific Islander, and 5.1% from two or more races.[28] with others identifying as Some Other Race (34.4%), Multiracial (5.1%), Black (0.7%), American Indian and Alaskan Native (1.1%), Asian (0.5%), and Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (0.1%).[28] By ethnicity, 39.3% of the total population is Hispanic-Latino (of any race) and 60.7% is Non-Hispanic (of any race).[28]\n\n\nCalifornia has the highest number, and second highest percentage, of Asian Americans by state. Only Hawaii has a higher Asian American percentage than California. While New Mexico and Texas have higher percentages of Hispanics, California has the highest total number of Hispanics of any U.S. state. Hispanics are the largest single ethnic group in the state.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n126. **^** Hill, Elizabeth G. (2000). *California's Changing Income Distribution* (PDF).

Hispanics (of any race) are the largest single ethnic group in the state.[17] Spanish is the state's second most widely spoken language. Areas with especially large Spanish speaking populations include the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the California-Mexico border counties of San Diego and Imperial, and the San Joaquin Valley. Nearly 43% of Californian residents speak a language other than English at home, a proportion far higher than any other state.[18]\n\n\nIn 2011, there were an estimated 2.6 million undocumented immigrants residing in California.[19] California is home to almost 25% of the country's undocumented population, making up 6% of California's residents overall. Two-thirds of California's undocumented population have lived in the state for more than 10 years.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEstimated ancestries of Californians[83]\n| Ancestry[fn 1] | 2013 population\n | Margin of error (+/-)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Total** | **43,071,506** | 33,741\n |\n| Afghan | 38,136 | 3,075\n |\n| Albanian | 4,792 | 681\n |\n| Alsatian | 730 | 163\n |\n| American | 1,124,070 | 10,956\n |\n| Arab: | 277,573 | 6,191\n |\n| Egyptian[fn 2] | 45,540 | 2,737\n |\n| Iraqi[fn 2] | 20,551 | 1,969\n |\n| Jordanian[fn 2] | 14,142 | 1,731\n |\n| Lebanese[fn 2] | 57,008 | 2,372\n |\n| Moroccan[fn 2] | 8,953 | 959\n |\n| Palestinian[fn 2] | 57,222 | 1,571\n |\n| Syrian[fn 2] | 23,298 | 1,749\n |\n| Arab[fn 2] | 44,851 | 2,645\n |\n| Arab other[fn 2] | 48,890 | 2,692\n |\n| Armenian | 258,260 | 5,292\n |\n| Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac | 35,690 | 2,687\n |\n| Australian | 18,803 | 1,253\n |\n| Austrian | 77,113 | 2,205\n |\n| Basque | 18,413 | 1,252\n |\n| Belgian | 25,581 | 1,354\n |\n| Brazilian | 34,776 | 1,964\n |\n| British | 146,221 | 3,425\n |\n| Bulgarian | 13,093 | 1,304\n |\n| Cajun | 3,752 | 858\n |\n| Canadian | 88,244 | 2,687\n |\n| Carpatho Rusyn | 462 | 151\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** US Census Bureau (2016). \"2012-2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates\". `{{cite web}}`: Missing or empty `|url=` (help)\n38. **^** Reese, Phillip; Magagnini, Stephen (June 30, 2015). \"Census: Hispanics overtake Whites to become California's largest ethnic group\". *The Sacramento Bee*.

Uses 2017 CPS data[123] about incomes in 2016. Comparison is of NAS Family Income minus Medical Out-of-Pocket to CE-Based Poverty Threshold with CPI-U and Geographical Price Adjustments, as per [1].\nThe trends of low income in California are complex; from 1975 to 2014, real (inflation-adjusted) incomes have alternated between rises and sharp declines. These incomes have decreased overall for those outside the top 20th percentile, with the bottom 20th percentile seeing an average decline of 1% per year during that period.[125][126] Correspondingly, the percent of Californians with income below their poverty threshold has risen and fallen, but has on average increased by a tenth of a percentage point per year.[127]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe complexity of the state's low-income trends were visible when, in response to growing Chinese and Spanish-speaking populations, the city of Oakland implemented the nation's first policy of recruiting bilingual applicants for public-facing city jobs in 2001. This increased the employment of Hispanic and Chinese bilinguals throughout the public workforce, but also lowered (monolingual) Black employment.[129]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* California locations by race\n* California statistical areas\n* California exodus\n* Demographics of the United States\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTop 12 Non-English Languages Spoken in California (as of 2010)[97]\n| Language | Percentage of population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Spanish | 28.46%\n |\n| Chinese (including Cantonese and Mandarin) | 2.80%\n |\n| Tagalog | 2.20%\n |\n| Vietnamese | 1.43%\n |\n| Korean | 1.08%\n |\n| Armenian and Persian (tied) | 0.52% (each)\n |\n| Japanese | 0.43%\n |\n| Russian | 0.42%\n |\n| Hindi and Arabic (tied) | 0.38% (each)\n |\n| French | 0.36%\n |\n\n\nAs of 2010, 20,379,282 of California residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 10,672,610 spoke Spanish, 1,231,425 Chinese (which includes Cantonese and Mandarin), 796,451 Tagalog, 559,932 Vietnamese, 367,523 Korean, 192,980 Armenian, and Persian was spoken as a main language by 203,770 of the population over the age of five.

This broad distribution combined with high housing and living costs give California an abnormally high poverty rate. The Census Bureau's Supplemental Poverty Measure, calculated by comparing household income to a locally-adjusted poverty threshold, reports that 20.7% of California's population has income insufficient for their basic needs, as compared to 12.9% for the U.S. as a whole.[123] This calculation of income includes the benefits of California welfare programs such as food stamps and earned income tax credits — without these, the state's poverty rate would be 28%.[124]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** \"Population of Texas: Census 2010 and 2000 Interactive Map, Demographics, Statistics, Quick Facts\". *Censusviewer.com*.
