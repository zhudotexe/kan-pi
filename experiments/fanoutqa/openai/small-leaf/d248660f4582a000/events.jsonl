In 1984, such patterns were observed in the arrangement of atoms in quasicrystals.[54] Another noteworthy contribution is his 1971 invention of spin networks, which later came to form the geometry of spacetime in loop quantum gravity.[55] He was influential in popularizing what are commonly known as Penrose diagrams (causal diagrams).[56]\n\n\nIn 1983, Penrose was invited to teach at Rice University in Houston, by the then provost Bill Gordon. He worked there from 1983 to 1987.[57] His doctoral students have included, among others, Andrew Hodges,[58] Lane Hughston, Richard Jozsa, Claude LeBrun, John McNamara, Tristan Needham, Tim Poston,[59] Asghar Qadir, and Richard S.

But I don't think that's a very fruitful or helpful way of looking at the universe, I think that there is something much deeper about it.\"[123]\n\n\nPenrose is a patron of Humanists UK.[124]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of things named after Roger Penrose\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** Penrose, R.
