The Kansas City Royals won the 2015 World Series, the St. Louis Blues won the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals, and the Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowl LIV following the 2019 season.\n\n\n10 years after the 2011 World Series, Ron Washington would finally win a World Series ring after 44 years in MLB, as he served as the third base coach for the Atlanta Braves. In addition, four players from the 2011 Rangers' World Series team later won a world championship with the Boston Red Sox: Mike Napoli and Koji Uehara in 2013, and Ian Kinsler and Mitch Moreland in 2018.\n\n\n\n> \n> \"May the ghosts of 2011 be forever erased!\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n- Rangers radio announcer Eric Nadel, after the Rangers won the 2023 World Series\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Series was noted for its back-and-forth Game 6, in which the Cardinals erased a two-run deficit in the bottom of the 9th inning, then did it again in the 10th. In both innings, the Rangers were one strike away from their first World Series championship. The Cardinals won the game in the 11th inning on a walk-off home run by David Freese, who was named World Series MVP. The Series was also known for the blowout Game\u00a03, in which Cardinals player Albert Pujols hit three home runs, a World Series feat previously accomplished only by Reggie Jackson and Babe Ruth, and subsequently by Pablo Sandoval in 2012. In 2020, ESPN named the 2011 World Series the fifth greatest of all-time.[4]\n\n\nThe Series began on October 19, earlier than the previous season, so that no games would be played in November.[5] The Cardinals enjoyed home-field advantage for the series because the NL won the 2011 All-Star Game 5\u20131 on July 12.[6] The 2011 World Series was the first World Series to go all seven games since the 2002 Series.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n2011 World Series **(4\u20133): St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.)** over Texas Rangers (A.L.)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **St. Louis Cardinals** | 5 | 2 | 1 | 7 | 5 | 6 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 38 | 56 | 6\n |\n| Texas Rangers | 4 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 6 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 30 | 60 | 8\n |\n| **Total\u00a0attendance:**\u00a0342,878\u00a0 \u00a0**Average\u00a0attendance:**\u00a048,983**Winning player's share:** $323,169.98\u00a0 \u00a0**Losing player's share:** $251,515.76[46] |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nThe series was televised in the United States and Canada by Fox.

Each of the other umpires had previously worked one World Series.[10]\n\n\nThe Cardinals were supported by fans brandishing Rally Squirrel memorabilia that alluded to a squirrel that ran across the field during a playoff game.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThey defeated the overall #1 seed Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Division Series 3 games to 2, and then defeated the second-seeded Milwaukee Brewers (who were the first team in history to reach both NLCS and ALCS and the team the Cardinals faced in the 1982 World Series) in six games in the National League Championship Series.\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n*St. Louis won the series, 4\u20133.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the New York Giants won Super Bowl XLVI during the offseason, some news organizations, among them *The St. Louis Post-Dispatch*, compared the Cardinals to the Giants, invoking Al Michaels's call of the Giants winning the Super Bowl: \"The New York Giants, given the last rites by many in December, are the Super Bowl Champs in February.\"[58]\n\n\nThe Rangers became the first team to lose in the World Series in consecutive years since the Atlanta Braves in 1991 and 1992 and the first American League team to do so since the New York Yankees in 1963 and 1964.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Sunday Night Baseball*\n |\n| Commentators | * All-Star Game\n* Wild Card Round\n* ALCS\n* ALDS\n* NLCS\n* NLDS\n* World Series\n* *Game of the Week*\n |\n| Lore | * 1998 MLB home run record chase\n* Grand Slam Single (1999)\n* Death of Osama bin Laden (2011)\n* Fort Bragg Game (2016)\n* London Series\n* MLB at Field of Dreams (2021)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Cardinals set two World Series milestones in their Game 6 win\u2014the first team to come back from deficits in both the 9th and 10th innings, and the first team to score in the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th innings.[33] On *Mike and Mike in the Morning* the next day, ESPN senior baseball analyst Buster Olney called it the greatest game in the history of baseball.[34]\n\n\nGame 6 was originally scheduled for Wednesday, October 26, but was postponed due to heavy rain in the forecast; this was the first time that a World Series game was postponed since 2006. Although rain was only falling fairly lightly in St. Louis when this decision was made, MLB officials did not want a repeat of Game 5 of the 2008 World Series (which was suspended after the top of the sixth inning and resumed two days later).[22]\n\n\nDavid Freese and Lance Berkman became the third and fourth players[35] in World Series history to get game-tying hits with their team one out from elimination.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Memphis hosted the Triple-A All-Star Game at AutoZone Park in 2003.[25] Players Jason Bowers, Matt Duff, and Jason Ryan represented Memphis, as they were elected to the PCL All-Star Team.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"2017 Rebranding\" (PDF). *2019 Memphis Redbirds Media Guide*.

Since 2018, a select number of games are also broadcast on KTRS 550 AM in St. Louis, allowing Cardinals fans to keep tabs on up-and-coming players as well as promoting the Redbirds and Memphis tourism to the St. Louis market.[87]\n\n\n\n## Mascot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Memphis Redbirds were created as an expansion franchise of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1998.[9] Initially, the team was owned as a non-profit community entity called the Memphis Redbirds Baseball Foundation, which operated the Redbirds until 2009 when management was turned over to Global Spectrum, a Comcast-owned company.[10][11] While a new ballpark, AutoZone Park, was being constructed for the team, they played their first two seasons (1998\u201399) at the city's Tim McCarver Stadium.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n81. **^** \"Sulbaran, Four Relievers Combine to Four-Hit Colorado Springs\". *Memphis Redbirds*.

They compete as a member of the Texas League's North Division. The Cardinals began play in 2005.\n\n\nThe team is owned by the 11-time Major League Baseball (MLB) World Champion St. Louis Cardinals, for which it has been the Double-A affiliate since its founding in 2005. Since its inception, the team's home venue has been Hammons Field.\n\n\nThe Springfield Cardinals won three Texas League North 1st Half Division titles, two Texas League North 2nd Half Division titles, two Texas League North championships and one Texas League championship (2012). Through the 2020 season, a total of 114 former Springfield Cardinals have gone on to make their Major League debut with St. Louis with an additional 27 others debuting with different MLB teams.[2]\n\n\nPreviously, the St. Louis Cardinals' Double-A affiliate was the Tennessee Smokies, located near Sevierville, Tennessee. The Springfield Cardinals' Texas League North rivals are the Arkansas Travelers (Seattle Mariners), Northwest Arkansas Naturals (Kansas City Royals), Tulsa Drillers (Los Angeles Dodgers), and Wichita Wind Surge (Minnesota Twins).\n\n\nOn May 1, 2023, the Springfield Cardinals were sold by their MLB affiliate, the St. Louis Cardinals, to Diamond Baseball Holdings.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## The original Springfield Cardinals[edit]\n\n\nSpringfield, Missouri, has hosted professional baseball teams since as early as 1905, when the Springfield Highlanders began play. For nearly 30 years, the team was variously called the Highlanders, Jobbers, Midgets, and Merchants. There were several years when no team existed at all.\n\n\nIn 1931, the St. Louis Cardinals purchased a minor league team, renamed it the Cardinals, and relocated it in Springfield. That year, the team won the first of several Western Association titles. With a front office led by future Hall of Famer Branch Rickey, Springfield also went to the playoffs in 1931, 1932, 1934, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1941, and won league titles in 1931, 1932, 1934, 1937, and 1939.\n\n\nFollowing the 1946 season, St. Louis moved the team to St. Joseph, Missouri, where it remained until 1953. The city of Springfield saw a brief re-emergence of minor league baseball when the rival Chicago Cubs moved its affiliate to Springfield for one season taking the name Springfield Cubs.\n\n\nThough there was a gap of 63 years, most in the Springfield and St. Louis organizations consider the current Cardinals the same group which existed in 1932. Many pieces of fan apparel actually say \"Springfield Cardinals circa 1932.\" The deck on top of the Cardinals dugout also has the championship banners from the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n\n\n## Previous franchise history[edit]\n\n\nThe current Cardinals are a relatively new team, dating back to just 2005. Previous to this, they were known as the El Paso Diablos. That team's owners sold the franchise to the St. Louis Cardinals and were then moved to Springfield as part of their minor league system.\n\n\nThe previous Double-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals was the Tennessee Smokies in 2003 and 2004.\n\n\nSpringfield has also been the home of various other non-affiliated minor league clubs including the Springfield Highlander (1905), Jobbers (1911), Merchants (1920), Springfield Midgets (1906-1909, 1921\u20131929; the 1930 club being affiliated with the St. Louis Browns) and the Red Wings (1931). These former teams were generally Class C ball clubs in the former Western Association.[4]\n\n\n\n## 2012 season[edit]\n\n\nThe Cardinals\u2019 most successful season has been the 2012 campaign, during which they finished first in the North Division in second half of the season, posted a division-best and franchise mark with a 77\u201361 record, and won the Texas League Championship. They went on to defeat the Tulsa Drillers 3\u20132 in the best-of-five divisional playoff series, advancing to the 2012 Texas League Championship Series, their second in franchise history. Springfield defeated the Frisco RoughRiders three games to one in the best-of-five Championship Series. Key players included Kolten Wong, Jermaine Curtis, Carlos Martinez, Trevor Rosenthal, Vance Albitz, Oscar Taveras, and Xavier Scruggs.\n\n\n\n## Hammons Field[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hammons Field in Springfield, Missouri\nThe Springfield Cardinals play at Hammons Field.[5] It is located in Springfield, Missouri, and has a capacity of 7,986 plus approximately 2,500 general admission seating.\n\n\n\n## Mascots[edit]\n\n\nThe Springfield Cardinals have two mascots. Their first and main mascot is a brightly colored red bird named Louie. He has been a mascot for the team since its formation in 2005. He is the \"little brother\" of Fredbird, the mascot of the MLB's St. Louis Cardinals. Their second mascot is a fluffy dog named Fetch. He is a fluffy beagle received by Louie as a birthday gift on Opening Day in 2006. During home games they can be found entertaining fans by tossing t-shirts and taking photos. When the team is on the road, Louie and Fetch attend local events in the community.\n\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\nSpringfield Cardinals roster* v\n* t\n* e\n\n| **Players** | **Coaches/Other** |\n| **Pitchers**\n* 36 Trent Baker\n* 32 Ian Bedell\n* 49 Alex Cornwell\n* 39 Giovanny Gallegos \\* #\n* 16 Benito Garcia\n* 7 Tink Hence\n* 15 Cooper Hjerpe\n* 46 Andrew Marrero\n* 40 Steven Matz \\* #\n* 39 Keynan Middleton \\* #\n* 43 Edwin Nu\u00f1ez\n* 44 Wilfredo Pereira\n* 38 Max Rajcic\n* 35 Jack Ralston\n* 18 Tekoah Roby ![](image)\n* 31 Ryan Shreve\n* 34 Matt Svanson\n* 30 Leonardo Taveras\n |  | **Catchers**\n* 33 Jimmy Crooks\n* 11 Aaron McKeithan\n* 25 Luis Rodriguez\n\n**Infielders**\n* 5 Jacob Buchberger\n* 29 Matt Lloyd\n* 48 Ramon Mendoza\n* 22 Chandler Redmond\n* 8 Jeremy Rivas\n* 21 Bryan Torres\n* 4 R.J.

Stan Musial played 87 games for Springfield during the 1941 season, batting .379 and quickly becoming a fan favorite. In April 2005, Musial threw out the ceremonial first pitch and played his harmonica to the tune of \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" to a crowd of nearly 12,000 during the inaugural St. Louis vs. Springfield Cardinals game.\n\n\nAmong other players to come through Springfield are Dizzy Dean and his brother Paul, Pepper Martin, and Joe Medwick.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Rice, Melissa (June 20, 2017). \"Gifford Promoted To St. Louis, Reiter Named New Springfield GM\". *Osarks First*.

The team was established in 1983 as the **Peoria Suns**. They are located in Peoria, Illinois, and are named for the Peoria Indian tribe for which the city was named. In 2005, the team replaced the indigenous imagery associated with the Chiefs name and moved to a logo of a dalmatian depicted as a fire chief.[1] The Chiefs play their home games at Dozer Park, which opened in 2002. They previously played at Vonachen Stadium near Bradley University from 1983 through 2001. The Chiefs have made the playoffs a total of 13 times, through eight wild-card berths, three first-half titles, and two second-half titles.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Earlier professional baseball in Peoria[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Benson, Michael (1989). *Baseball Parks of North America*.

The new park was just across Grant Street from Lake View Park. The Tractors continued to play in several leagues before folding after the 1937 season. The city was then without professional baseball for the next 15 years. The name Peoria Chiefs first appeared with a new franchise in the Three-I League in 1953. This club disbanded after 1957, and Peoria was again without professional ball, for the next 25 years until the current Chiefs set up shop. The Woodruff Field site is now a softball facility called Woodruff Park.\n\n\n\n### Current franchise[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Chiefs in action in 1990\nThe Peoria Suns were established in 1983. They played their home games at Meinen Field, built in 1968, near the Bradley University campus. The team's name was changed to the Chiefs in 1984.

The team set a Midwest League single-game attendance record on July 29, 2008, when the Chiefs drew a crowd of 32,103 to Wrigley Field in Chicago for a game against the Kane County Cougars.\n\n\nThe Chiefs' affiliation with the Cubs ended after the 2012 season,[4] and they entered into a player-development contract with the St. Louis Cardinals.[5]\n\n\nUnder Major League Baseball's restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Chiefs were organized into the High-A Central.[6] In 2022, the High-A Central became known as the Midwest League, the name used by the regional circuit before the 2021 reorganization.[7]\n\n\n\n### 2008 brawl[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Season\n | League\n | Division\n | Finish[d] | Wins[d] | Losses[d] | Win%\n | GB[e] | Postseason\n | MLB affiliate\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Peoria Suns** |\n| 1983\n | Midwest League | South\n | 4th\n | 54\n | 85\n | .388\n | 26\n | \u2014\n | California Angels |\n| **Peoria Chiefs** |\n| 1984\n | Midwest League | South\n | 2nd\n | 66\n | 73\n | .475\n | 4\n | \u2014\n | California Angels |\n| 1985\n | Midwest League | South\n | 1st\n | 75\n | 65\n | .536\n | \u2014\n | Wild Card BerthWon South Division title vs. Beloit, 2\u20131Lost MWL championship vs. Kenosha, 1\u20133\n | Chicago Cubs |\n| 1986\n | Midwest League | South\n | 2nd\n | 77\n | 63\n | .550\n | 10\n | Wild Card BerthWon South Division title vs. Springfield, 2\u20130 Lost MWL championship vs. Waterloo, 0\u20132\n | Chicago Cubs |\n| 1987\n | Midwest League | South\n | 2nd\n | 71\n | 69\n | .507\n | 23\n | \u2014\n | Chicago Cubs |\n| 1988\n | Midwest League | South\n | 5th\n | 70\n | 70\n | .500\n | 17\n | \u2014\n | Chicago Cubs |\n| 1989\n | Midwest League | South\n | 2nd\n | 80\n | 59\n | .576\n | 1\n | \u2014\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"How the Peoria Chiefs long ago moved away from Native American imagery\".\n2. **^** Benson 1989, p.\u00a0293.\n3. **^** Crying `Foul!` Over The Inside Story Of Would-be Cubs - tribunedigital-chicagotribune\n4. **^** Report: Chiefs losing Cubs affiliation to Kane County\n5. **^** Baliva, Nathan (September 18, 2012). \"Chiefs Sign Affiliation Agreement with St. Louis Cardinals\".

history of professional baseball in Peoria dates to the late 19th century. The Peoria Reds, Peoria Canaries, and Peoria Blackbirds played in several early leagues during parts of 1878 to 1895. The first ballpark used by these teams was reportedly called **Sylvan Park** and was located at the corner of Northeast Glendale Avenue and Spring Street on the location of the present-day St. Augustine Manor.[2] In 1883, the club moved a few blocks toward Peoria Lake, to a facility called **Lake View Park**, on the southeast corner of Northeast Adams Street and Grant Street, which would remain the home of various Peoria clubs for the next four decades.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 1895, club was dubbed the Peoria Distillers, referencing the Hiram Walker plant. From 1891 to 1911, Frank E. Murphy from Green Bay, Wisconsin, became involved with baseball, beginning with the purchase of the Peoria team of the Midwest League, which he later renamed the Peoria Hoosiers. That nickname would stick with the various Peoria clubs for the next couple of decades, including their first stretch with the Three-I League from 1905 to 1917. After the resumption of following the peak of American involvement in World War I, the Peoria Tractors name gained favor in 1919, with the growth of the nearby branch of the company later called Caterpillar Inc.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Chicago Cubs |\n| 1990\n | Midwest League | South\n | 7th\n | 55\n | 82\n | .401\n | 34.5\n | \u2014\n | Chicago Cubs |\n| 1991\n | Midwest League | South\n | 6th\n | 62\n | 76\n | .449\n | 18.5\n | \u2014\n | Chicago Cubs |\n| 1992\n | Midwest League | South\n | 4th\n | 62\n | 74\n | .456\n | 28.5\n | \u2014\n | Chicago Cubs |\n| 1993\n | Midwest League | South\n | 5th\n | 59\n | 79\n | .428\n | 23\n | \u2014\n | Chicago Cubs |\n| 1994\n | Midwest League | South\n | 2nd\n | 68\n | 70\n | .493\n | 8.5\n | \u2014\n | Chicago Cubs |\n| 1995\n | Midwest League | West\n | 4th\n | 62\n | 72\n | .463\n | 12.5\n | \u2014\n | St. Louis Cardinals |\n| 1996\n | Midwest League | Central\n | 1st\n | 79\n | 57\n | .581\n | \u2014\n | Won Second Half Central Division titleLost quarterfinals vs. Wisconsin, 1\u20132\n | St. Louis Cardinals |\n| 1997\n | Midwest League | Central\n | 3rd\n | 70\n | 69\n | .504\n | 6\n | \u2014\n | St. Louis Cardinals |\n| 1998\n | Midwest League | Central\n | 2nd\n | 72\n | 68\n | .514\n | 1.5\n | Wild Card BerthLost quarterfinals vs. Fort Wayne, 1\u20132\n | St. Louis Cardinals |\n| 1999\n | Midwest League | Central\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSports teams based in Illinois\n |\n| --- |\n| Baseball | MLB\nChicago Cubs\nChicago White Sox\nML\nPeoria Chiefs\nAA\nChicago Dogs\nKane County Cougars\nFL\nGateway Grizzlies\nJoliet Slammers\nSchaumburg Boomers\nWindy City ThunderBolts\nNWL\nRockford Rivets\nPL\nAlton River Dragons\nDanville Dans\nIllinois Valley Pistol Shrimp\nNormal CornBelters\nSpringfield Lucky Horseshoes\nThrillville Thrillbillies\n | ![Flag of Illinois](image)\n |\n| Basketball | NBA\nChicago Bulls\nWNBA\nChicago Sky\nG League\nWindy City Bulls\nABA\nChicago Fury\nChicago Steam\nLibertyville Vipers\nWindy City Groove\nIBA\nKankakee County Soldiers\nRockford Riverdawgs\nWindy City Blazers\nMPBA\nChampaign Swarm\nChicago Force\nPontiac 66ers\nWindy City Groove\n |\n| Football | NFL\nChicago Bears\nIFL\nQuad City Steamwheelers\n |\n| Hockey | NHL\nChicago Blackhawks\nAHL\nChicago Wolves\nRockford IceHogs\nECHL\n*Bloomington Bison (2024)*\nSPHL\nPeoria Rivermen\nQuad City Storm\nUSHL\nChicago Steel\nNAHL\nSpringfield Jr. Blues\n |\n| Inline hockey | MLRH\nChicago Carnage\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Jason Motte (2003) 2012 NL Saves Leader\n* Brendan Ryan (2003)\n* Sam Fuld (2005)\n* Rich Hill (2005)\n* Jody Davis (MGR: 2006) 2x MLB All-Star\n* Mark Prior (2006) MLB All-Star (Peoria Chiefs MLB Rehab)\n* Jeff Samardzija (2006) MLB All-Star\n* Darwin Barney (2007)\n* Henry Blanco (2007) (Peoria Chiefs MLB Rehab)\n* Welington Castillo (2007)\n* Wade Miller (2007) (Peoria Chiefs MLB Rehab)\n* Scott Eyre (2008) (Peoria Chiefs MLB Rehab)\n* Josh Harrison (2008) 2x MLB All-Star\n* Jon Lieber (2008) MLB All-Star\n* Chris Archer (2009) 2x MLB All-Star\n* Reed Johnson (2009) (Peoria Chiefs MLB Rehab)\n* DJ LeMahieu (2009) 3x Gold Glove; 3x MLB All-Star\n* Ted Lilly (2009\u201310) 2x MLB All-Star (Peoria Chiefs MLB Rehab)\n* Aramis Ram\u00edrez (2009) 3x MLB All-Star (Peoria Chiefs MLB Rehab)\n* Carlos Zambrano (2009) 3x MLB All-Star (Peoria Chiefs MLB Rehab)\n* Carlos Silva (2010) (Peoria Chiefs MLB Rehab)\n* Jake Westbrook (2013) MLB All-Star (Peoria Chiefs MLB Rehab)\n* Jon Jay (2015) (Peoria Chiefs MLB Rehab)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPalm Beach Cardinals\nRookie\n\nFlorida Complex League Cardinals\nForeign Rookie\n\nDominican Summer League Cardinals\n |\n| World SeriesChampionships | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| pre-MLB | * 1885\n* 1886\n |\n| MLB | * 1926\n* 1931\n* 1934\n* 1942\n* 1944\n* 1946\n* 1964\n* 1967\n* 1982\n* 2006\n* 2011\n |\n\n |\n| League pennants | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| American Association | * 1885\n* 1886\n* 1887\n* 1888\n |\n| National League | * 1926\n* 1928\n* 1930\n* 1931\n* 1934\n* 1942\n* 1943\n* 1944\n* 1946\n* 1964\n* 1967\n* 1968\n* 1982\n* 1985\n* 1987\n* 2004\n* 2006\n* 2011\n* 2013\n |\n\n |\n| Division titles | National League East\n\n1982\n1985\n1987\nNational League Central\n\n1996\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2009\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2019\n2022\n |\n| Wild card titles | * 2001\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2021\n |\n| All Star Games hosted | * 1940\n* 1957\n* 1966\n* 2009\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring a game on July 23, 2008, Dayton Dragons hit three Chiefs batters. The teams played again the following day, and in the first inning, Chiefs pitcher Julio Castillo hit Dragons batter Zack Cozart in the head. Two batters later, Castillo hit Angel Cabrera in the arm, and nearly hit another Dragon player in the head after that. Cabrera then spiked the Chiefs shortstop at second base on a slide. At that point, Chiefs fill-in manager Carmelo Martinez began arguing with the umpire. This brought out the Dragons manager, Donnie Scott, and the two argued for a few minutes before the umpires broke it up.\n\n\nDuring the coaches' argument, pitcher Castillo fired a ball at the Dragons' dugout. The ball struck a fan, who was taken to the hospital. Brandon Menchaca proceeded to tackle Castillo from behind as both benches cleared, delaying the game for 69\u00a0minutes. After the game, Castillo was arrested for felonious assault.[8] The injured fan, Chris McCarthy, suffered a concussion but recovered.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Javier Baez (2012) 2x MLB All-Star\n* Patrick Wisdom (2013)\n* Alex Reyes (2014) MLB All-Star\n* Carson Kelly (2013\u201314)\n* Harrison Bader (2015) Gold Glove Award winner\n* Paul DeJong (2015) MLB All-Star\n* Jack Flaherty (2015)\n* Sandy Alcantara (2016) 2x MLB All-Star, NL Cy Young Award\n* Ryan Helsley (2016) MLB All-Star\n* Jhonny Peralta (2016) 3x MLB All-Star (Peoria Chiefs MLB Rehab)\n* Jordan Hicks (2017)\n* Andrew Knizner (2017)\n* Dylan Carlson (2017)\n* Juan Yepez (2017)\n* Tommy Edman (2017) Gold Glove Award winner\n* Nolan Gorman (2018-19)\n* Lars Nootbaar (2019)\n* Brendan Donovan (2019) Gold Glove Award winner\n* Alec Burleson (2021)\n* Jordan Walker (2021)\n* Miles Mikolas (2021) 2x MLB All-Star (Peoria Chiefs MLB Rehab)\n* Iv\u00e1n Herrera (2021)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Wally Joyner (1983) 4x MLB All-Star\n* Mark McLemore (1983)\n* Devon White (1983) 7x Gold Glove;

Prior to 2021, the team was known as the **Gulf Coast League Cardinals**. The team plays its home games in Jupiter, Florida, at Roger Dean Stadium, which is also the spring training home of the St. Louis Cardinals and the Miami Marlins. The team is mainly composed of players who are in their first year of professional baseball either as draftees or non-drafted free agents. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe team first competed in the Sarasota Rookie League in 1964 and the Florida Rookie League in 1965, predecessors of the Gulf Coast League (GCL), which began play in 1966. The team competed until 1976, then was absent from the league for 30 years.\n\n\nIn 2007, the team returned to the GCL, and has operated continuously since then. The team claimed its first league championship in 2016.

The team plays in the Boca Chica South division of the Dominican Summer League.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe team first came into existence in 1989 as a shared affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates and the New York Mets.[1] In 1990, they shared an affiliation with the Houston Astros.[2] From 1991 to 1993, they shared an affiliation with the Detroit Tigers and from 1994 to 1995, they shared an affiliation with the Philadelphia Phillies. The team became an independent Cardinals affiliate in 1996 and has remained so ever since, with the exception of the 2004 season during which team operations were suspended.[3]\n\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\nDominican Summer League Cardinals roster* v\n* t\n* e\n\n| **Players** | **Coaches/Other** |\n| **Pitchers**\n* 38 Jarol Baez\n* -- Andrew Bolivar\n* 47 Emisael Carrera\n* -- Gabriel Chinchilla\n* 41 Xavier Cruz\n* -- Branneli Franco\n* -- Jesus Garcia\n* -- Oliver Gonzalez\n* 43 Justin Hernandez\n* 33 Reiner Lopez\n* 36 Bernard Mack\n* -- Guanchi Martinez\n* 46 Jefferson Moran\n* 39 Brailyn Paulino\n* 35 Kener Perez\n* 57 Keiverson Ramirez\n* -- Alan Reyes\n* 56 Jose Suriel\n* 28 Giovanni Vargas\n* -- Earle Zulueta\n |  | **Catchers**\n* 31 Paulo Asprilla\n* -- Juan Pablo Cabrera\n\n**Infielders**\n* 3 Yoerny Junco\n* -- Cristofer Lebron\n* -- Yairo Padilla\n* -- Rainiel Rodriguez\n* 19 Daniel Rojas\n* -- Christian Saez\n* 12 Bracewell Taveras\n\n**Outfielders**\n* -- Brayan Amoroso\n* 15 Andru Arthur\n* -- Edward Guribe\n* -- Yaxson Lucena\n* 22 Fernando Roquez\n* 16 Facundo Velasquez\n\n\n |  | **Manager**\n* 11 Fray Peniche\n\n**Coaches**\n* 88 Luis Cruz (hitting)\n* 87 Wesslye Cuas (hitting)\n* 89 Wilman Madera (pitching)\n* 54 Bill Villanueva (pitching)\n\n**60-day injured list**\n* 13 Hancel Almonte\n* -- Michael Correa\n* -- Ryan Rodriguez\n\n![](image) 7-day injured list\n\\* On St. Louis Cardinals 40-man roster\n~ Development list\n# Rehab assignment\n\u221e Reserve list\n\u2021 Restricted list\n\u00a7 Suspended list\n\u2020 Temporarily inactive list\n\nRoster updated June 3, 2024\n\nTransactions\n\u2192 More rosters: MiLB\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Dominican Summer League\n\u2192 St. Louis Cardinals minor league players\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"1989 DSL Pirates/Cardinals/Mets Statistics -- Minor Leagues - Baseball-Reference.com\".
