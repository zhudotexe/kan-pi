If household data is used, the measured value of income Gini depends on how the household is defined. The comparison is not meaningful when different populations are not measured with consistent definitions.\n\n\nDeininger and Squire (1996) show that the income Gini coefficient based on individual income rather than household income is different. For example, for the United States, they found that the individual income-based Gini index was 0.35, while for France, 0.43. According to their individual-focused method, in the 108 countries they studied, South Africa had the world's highest Gini coefficient at 0.62, Malaysia had Asia's highest Gini coefficient at 0.5, Brazil the highest at 0.57 in Latin America and the Caribbean region, and Turkey the highest at 0.5 in OECD countries.[81]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSmall sample bias – sparsely populated regions more likely to have low Gini coefficient\nGini index has a downward-bias for small populations.[79] Counties or states or countries with small populations and less diverse economies will tend to report small Gini coefficients. For economically diverse large population groups, a much higher coefficient is expected than for each of its regions. For example, taking the world economy as a whole and income distribution for all human beings, different scholars estimate the global Gini index to range between 0.61 and 0.68.[12][13]\nAs with other inequality coefficients, the Gini coefficient is influenced by the granularity of the measurements. For example, five 20% quantiles (low granularity) will usually yield a lower Gini coefficient than twenty 5% quantiles (high granularity) for the same distribution. Philippe Monfort has shown that using inconsistent or unspecified granularity limits the usefulness of Gini coefficient measurements.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Xu, Kuan (January 2004). \"How Has the Literature on Gini's Index Evolved in the Past 80 Years?\" (PDF).

It was developed by Italian statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini.\n\n\nThe Gini coefficient measures the inequality among the values of a frequency distribution, such as levels of income. A Gini coefficient of 0 reflects perfect equality, where all income or wealth values are the same, while a Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) reflects maximal inequality among values, a situation where a single individual has all the income while all others have none.[4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Dorfman, Robert (1979). \"A Formula for the Gini Coefficient\". *The Review of Economics and Statistics*. **61** (1): 146–149. doi:10.2307/1924845.

For example, suppose two equally egalitarian countries pursue different immigration policies. In that case, the country accepting a higher proportion of low-income or impoverished migrants will report a higher Gini coefficient and, therefore, may exhibit more income inequality.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Gini, C.

However, it should be borne in mind that the Gini coefficient can be misleading when used to make political comparisons between large and small countries or those with different immigration policies (see limitations section).\n\n\nThe Gini coefficient for the entire world has been estimated by various parties to be between 0.61 and 0.68.[12][13][51] The graph shows the values expressed as a percentage in their historical development for a number of countries.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Gini coefficient was proposed by Corrado Gini as a measure of inequality of income or wealth.[6] For OECD countries in the late 20th century, considering the effect of taxes and transfer payments, the income Gini coefficient ranged between 0.24 and 0.49, with Slovenia being the lowest and Mexico the highest.[7] African countries had the highest pre-tax Gini coefficients in 2008–2009, with South Africa having the world's highest, estimated to be 0.63 to 0.7.[8][9] However, this figure drops to 0.52 after social assistance is taken into account, and drops again to 0.47 after taxation.[10] The country with the lowest Gini coefficient is Slovenia, with a Gini coefficient of 0.232.[11] The Gini coefficient of the global income in 2005 has been estimated to be between 0.61 and 0.68 by various sources.[12][13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAssuming non-negative income or wealth for all, the Gini coefficient's theoretical range is from 0 (total equality) to 1 (absolute inequality). This measure is often rendered as a percentage, spanning 0 to 100. However, if negative values are factored in, as in cases of debt, the Gini index could exceed 1. Typically, we presuppose a positive mean or total, precluding a Gini coefficient below zero. [23]\n\n\nAn alternative approach is to define the Gini coefficient as half of the relative mean absolute difference, which is equivalent to the definition based on the Lorenz curve.[24] The mean absolute difference is the average absolute difference of all pairs of items of the population, and the relative mean absolute difference is the mean absolute difference divided by the average, \n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n¯\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\bar {x}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle {\\bar {x}}}](image), to normalize for scale.

The remaining regional averages were: sub-Saharan Africa (44.2), Asia (40.4), Middle East and North Africa (39.2), Eastern Europe and Central Asia (35.4), and High-income Countries (30.9). Using the same method, the United States is claimed to have a Gini index of 36, while South Africa had the highest income Gini index score of 67.8.[52]\n\n\n\n### World income Gini index since 1800s[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEducation Gini index estimates the inequality in education for a given population.[59] It is used to discern trends in social development through educational attainment over time. A study across 85 countries by three World Bank economists, Vinod Thomas, Yan Wang, and Xibo Fan, estimated Mali had the highest education Gini index of 0.92 in 1990 (implying very high inequality in educational attainment across the population), while the United States had the lowest education inequality Gini index of 0.14. Between 1960 and 1990, China, India and South Korea had the fastest drop in education inequality Gini Index. They also claim education Gini index for the United States slightly increased over the 1980–1990 period.\n\n\n  \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Gini coefficient has features that make it useful as a measure of dispersion in a population, and inequalities in particular.[45] The coefficient ranges from 0, for perfect equality, to 1, indicating perfect inequality. The Gini is based on the comparison of cumulative proportions of the population against cumulative proportions of income they receive.[71]\n\n\n\n## Limitations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Gini coefficient calculated from a sample is a statistic, and its standard error, or confidence intervals for the population Gini coefficient, should be reported. These can be calculated using bootstrap techniques, mathematically complicated and computationally demanding even in an era of fast computers.[40] Economist Tomson Ogwang made the process more efficient by setting up a \"trick regression model\" in which respective income variables in the sample are ranked, with the lowest income being allocated rank 1. The model then expresses the rank (dependent variable) as the sum of a constant *A* and a normal error term whose variance is inversely proportional to *y**k*:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk\n=\nA\n+\n \nN\n(\n0\n,\n\ns\n\n2\n\n\n\n/\n\n\ny\n\nk\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k=A+\\ N(0,s^{2}/y\\_{k})}\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![{\\displaystyle {\\text{Gini}}=2A=1-2B}](image).\nThe Gini coefficient is an index for the degree of inequality in the distribution of income/wealth, used to estimate how far a country's wealth or income distribution deviates from an equal distribution.[20]\n\n\nThe Gini coefficient is usually defined mathematically based on the Lorenz curve, which plots the proportion of the total income of the population (y-axis) that is cumulatively earned by the bottom *x* of the population (see diagram).[21] The line at 45 degrees thus represents perfect equality of incomes. The Gini coefficient can then be thought of as the ratio of the area that lies between the line of equality and the Lorenz curve (marked *A* in the diagram) over the total area under the line of equality (marked *A* and *B* in the diagram); i.e., G = *A*/(*A* + *B*). If there are no negative incomes, it is also equal to 2*A* and 1 − 2*B* due to the fact that *A* + *B* = 0.5.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![The change in Gini indices has differed across countries. Some countries have change little over time, such as Belgium, Canada, Germany, Japan, and Sweden. Brazil has oscillated around a steady value. France, Italy, Mexico, and Norway have shown marked declines. China and the US have increased steadily. Australia grew to moderate levels before dropping. India sank before rising again. The UK and Poland stayed at very low levels before rising. Bulgaria had an increase of fits-and-starts. .svg alt text](image)\n### Regional income Gini indices[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Modarres, Reza; Gastwirth, Joseph L.

To mitigate this, the demographic structure should be taken into account. Countries with an aging population, or those with an increased birth rate, experience an increasing pre-tax Gini coefficient even if real income distribution for working adults remains constant. Many scholars have devised over a dozen variants of the Gini coefficient.[14][15][16]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe Gini coefficient was developed by the Italian statistician Corrado Gini and published in his 1912 paper *Variabilità e mutabilità* (English: variability and mutability).[17][18] Building on the work of American economist Max Lorenz, Gini proposed that the difference between the hypothetical straight line depicting perfect equality, and the actual line depicting people's incomes, be used as a measure of inequality.[19]\n\n\n\n## Definition[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nN\n−\n1\n\n\n\n−\n\n\n2\n\nN\n(\nN\n−\n1\n)\nμ\n\n\n\n(\n\n∑\n\ni\n=\n1\n\n\nn\n\n\n\nP\n\ni\n\n\n\nX\n\ni\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G={\\frac {N+1}{N-1}}-{\\frac {2}{N(N-1)\\mu }}(\\sum \\_{i=1}^{n}P\\_{i}X\\_{i})}\n\n![{\\displaystyle G={\\frac {N+1}{N-1}}-{\\frac {2}{N(N-1)\\mu }}(\\sum _{i=1}^{n}P_{i}X_{i})}](image)\nwhere \n\n\n\nμ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu }\n\n![{\\displaystyle \\mu }](image) is mean income of the population, Pi is the income rank P of person i, with income X, such that the richest person receives a rank of 1 and the poorest a rank of *N*. This effectively gives higher weight to poorer people in the income distribution, which allows the Gini to meet the Transfer Principle. Note that the Jasso-Deaton formula rescales the coefficient so that its value is one if all the \n\n\n\n\nX\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X\\_{i}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle X_{i}}](image) are zero except one. Note however Allison's reply on the need to divide by N² instead.[44]\n\n\nFAO explains another version of the formula.[45]\n\n\n\n## Generalized inequality indices[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Generalized entropy index\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTable B.

The Gini coefficient on market income—sometimes referred to as a pre-tax Gini coefficient—is calculated on income before taxes and transfers. It measures inequality in income without considering the effect of taxes and social spending already in place in a country. The Gini coefficient on disposable income—sometimes referred to as the after-tax Gini coefficient—is calculated on income after taxes and transfers. It measures inequality in income after considering the effect of taxes and social spending already in place in a country.[7][47][48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEven when the total income of a population is the same, in certain situations two countries with different income distributions can have the same Gini index (e.g. cases when income Lorenz Curves cross).[45] Table A illustrates one such situation. Both countries have a Gini coefficient of 0.2, but the average income distributions for household groups are different. As another example, in a population where the lowest 50% of individuals have no income, and the other 50% have equal income, the Gini coefficient is 0.5; whereas for another population where the lowest 75% of people have 25% of income and the top 25% have 75% of the income, the Gini index is also 0.5. Economies with similar incomes and Gini coefficients can have very different income distributions. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhen men and women are considered together, the Gini coefficient-based Shorrocks index trends imply long-term income inequality has been substantially reduced among all workers, in recent decades for the United States.[68] Other scholars, using just 1990s data or other short periods have come to different conclusions.[69] For example, Sastre and Ayala conclude from their study of income Gini coefficient data between 1993 and 1998 for six developed economies that France had the least income mobility, Italy the highest, and the United States and Germany intermediate levels of income mobility over those five years.[70]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

The Gini coefficient (after-taxes and transfers) for a total population ranged between 0.25 and 0.48, with Denmark the lowest and Mexico the highest. For the United States, the country with the largest population among OECD countries, the pre-tax Gini index was 0.49, and the after-tax Gini index was 0.38 in 2008–2009. The OECD average for total populations in OECD countries was 0.46 for the pre-tax income Gini index and 0.31 for the after-tax income Gini index.[7][49] Taxes and social spending that were in place in 2008–2009 period in OECD countries significantly lowered effective income inequality, and in general, \"European countries—especially Nordic and Continental welfare states—achieve lower levels of income inequality than other countries.\"[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nExtreme wealth inequality, yet low-income Gini coefficient\nA Gini index does not contain information about absolute national or personal incomes. Populations can simultaneously have very low-income Gini indices and very high wealth Gini indexes. By measuring inequality in income, the Gini ignores the differential efficiency of the use of household income. By ignoring wealth (except as it contributes to income), the Gini can create the appearance of inequality when the people compared are at different stages in their life. Wealthy countries such as Sweden can show a low Gini coefficient for the disposable income of 0.31, thereby appearing equal, yet have a very high Gini coefficient for wealth of 0.79 to 0.86, suggesting an extremely unequal wealth distribution in its society.[77][78] These factors are not assessed in income-based Gini.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Amiel, Y.; Cowell, F. A.
