Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869\u20131909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHarvard University| ![](image)Coat of arms\n |\n| Latin: *Universitas Harvardiana* |\n| Former names\n | Harvard College |\n| Motto | *Veritas* (Latin)[1] |\n| Motto in\u00a0English\n | \"Truth\" |\n| Type | Private research university |\n| Established | 1636; 388\u00a0years ago\u00a0(1636)[2] |\n| Founder | Massachusetts General Court |\n| Accreditation | NECHE |\n| Academic affiliations\n | * AAU\n* AICUM\n* COFHE\n* NAICU\n* UArctic\n* URA\n* Space-grant\n |\n| Endowment | $50.7 billion (2023)[3][4] |\n| President | Claudine Gay |\n| Provost | Alan Garber |\n| Academic staff\n | ~2,400 faculty members (and >10,400 academic appointments in affiliated teaching hospitals)[5] |\n| Students | 21,613 (Fall 2022)[6] |\n| Undergraduates | 7,240 (Fall 2022)[6] |\n| Postgraduates | 14,373 (Fall 2022)[6] |\n| Location | Cambridge\n, Massachusetts\n, United States\n42\u00b022\u203228\u2033N 71\u00b007\u203201\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff42.37444\u00b0N 71.11694\u00b0W\ufeff / 42.37444; -71.11694 |\n| Campus | Midsize city[7], 209 acres (85\u00a0ha) |\n| Newspaper | *The Harvard Crimson* |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** Harvard, John. \"John Harvard Facts, Information\". *encyclopedia.com*.

A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university *ius non trahi extra*, or the right not to be drawn out, for three years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside of the diocese of Ely.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Zutshi, Patrick (2012). \"The Dispersal of Scholars from Oxford and the Beginnings of a University at Cambridge: A Study of the Sources\". *The English Historical Review*. **127** (528): 1041\u20131062. doi:10.1093/ehr/ces209.

The founding of the University of Cambridge, however, was inspired largely by an incident at the University of Oxford during which three Oxford scholars, as an administration of justice in the death of a local Oxford-area woman, were hanged by town authorities without first consulting ecclesiastical authorities, who traditionally would be inclined to pardon scholars in such cases. But during this time, Oxford's town authorities were in conflict with King John. Fearing more violence from Oxford townsfolk, University of Oxford scholars began leaving Oxford for more hospitable cities, including Paris, Reading, and Cambridge. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 617 hectares (1,520 acres)[7][a]\n |\n| Colours | \u00a0 Cambridge Blue[9] |\n| Sporting affiliations\n | British Universities and Colleges Sport |\n| Website | www.cam.ac.uk ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\nThe **University of Cambridge** is a public collegiate research university in Cambridge, England.

Prior to ultimately being permitted admission to the university in 1948, female students were granted the right to take University of Cambridge exams beginning in the late 19th century.[36] Women were also allowed to study courses, take examinations, and have prior exam results recorded retroactively, dating back to 1881; for a brief period after the turn of the 20th century, this allowed the steamboat ladies to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBetween 1896 and 1902, Downing College sold part of its land to permit the construction of Downing Site, the university's grouping of scientific laboratories for the study of anatomy, genetics, and Earth sciences.[30] During this period, the New Museums Site was erected, including the Cavendish Laboratory, which has since moved to West Cambridge, and other departments for chemistry and medicine.[31]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge began to award PhD degrees in the first third of the 20th century; the first Cambridge PhD in mathematics was awarded in 1924.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n91. **^** \"General Board of the Faculties\" Archived 1 March 2023 at the Wayback Machine, University of Cambridge website, retrieved 1 March 2023\n92. **^** \"Stormzy announces second year of 'The Stormzy Scholarship', a student funding scheme with Cambridge University\". *University of Cambridge*. 16 August 2019.

As chancellor, Albert reformed university curricula beyond its initial focus on mathematics and classics, adding modern era history and the natural sciences. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: A Classical Adventure: The Architectural History of Downing College, Cambridge; Cambridge Medical School building; Cambridge Observatory; Cambridge University Library; Cambridge University Real Tennis Club; Fitzwilliam Museum; Goldie Boathouse; Lady Mitchell Hall; Old Schools; Senate House, Cambridge; Scott Polar Research Institute; University of Cambridge Sports Centre; and William Gates Building, Cambridge\n\nThe university occupies a central location within the city of Cambridge. University of Cambridge students represent approximately 20 percent of the town's population, which was 145,674 as of 2021, and contributes on whole to a lower age demographic in the city.[52]\n\n\nMost of the university's older colleges are located near the city centre through which River Cam flows. Students and others traditionally punt on the River Cam, which provides views of the university's buildings and campuses that surround the river.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university is widely considered the birthplace of the computer; mathematician and father of the computer Charles Babbage designed the world's first computing system as early as the mid-1800s. Cambridge alumnus Alan Turing devised the basis for modern computing, and Maurice Wilkes later created the first programmable computer. The webcam was also invented at the University of Cambridge, showing the Trojan Room coffee pot in the university's computer laboratories.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThroughout its history, the University of Cambridge has frequently been featured in literature, artistic works, television, and film. As of February 2023, IMDb lists 82 films or television shows that feature the University of Cambridge as a filming location.[191][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nCambridge was mentioned as early as the 14th century in Geoffrey Chaucer's *The Canterbury Tales*. In *The Reeve's Tale*, the two main fictional characters are students at a University of Cambridge college called Soler Halle, which is believed to refer to King's Hall and is now part of Trinity College.[192]\n\n\nThe university has been the setting for all or parts of numerous novels, including Douglas Adams' *Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency*, Rose Macaulay's *They Were Defeated*,[193] and Tom Sharpe's *Porterhouse Blue*.[194]\n\n\nOther notable examples of the University of Cambridge in popular culture include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity of Cambridge\n |\n| --- |\n| People | * Chancellor\n\t+ The Lord Sainsbury of Turville\n* Vice-Chancellor\n\t+ Deborah Prentice\n* List of University of Cambridge people\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Colleges | * Christ's\n* Churchill\n* Clare\n* Clare\u00a0Hall\n* Corpus\u00a0Christi\n* Darwin\n* Downing\n* Emmanuel\n* Fitzwilliam\n* Girton\n* Gonville\u00a0and\u00a0Caius\n* Homerton\n* Hughes\u00a0Hall\n* Jesus\n* King\u2019s\n* Lucy\u00a0Cavendish\n* Magdalene\n* Murray\u00a0Edwards\n* Newnham\n* Pembroke\n* Peterhouse\n* Queens\u2019\n* Robinson\n* St\u00a0Catharine\u2019s\n* St\u00a0Edmund\u2019s\n* St\u00a0John\u2019s\n* Selwyn\n* Sidney\u00a0Sussex\n* Trinity\n* Trinity\u00a0Hall\n* Wolfson\n |\n| Faculties anddepartments, by school | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPublic collegiate university in Cambridge, England\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn January 2021, Cambridge created foundation courses for disadvantaged students.[139] While the usual entry requirements are A\\*AA in A-Levels, the one-year foundation course has 50 places for students who achieve BBB.[140] If successful on the course, students receive a recognised CertHE qualification and can progress to degrees in the arts, humanities, and social sciences at the university.[139] Candidates include those who have been in care, who are estranged from their families, who have missed significant periods of learning because of health issues, those from low-income backgrounds, and those from schools with few students attending universities.[139]\n\n\n\n### Teaching[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge School (intellectual history) and List of professorships at the University of Cambridge\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNotable University of Cambridge buildings include King's College Chapel,[54] the history faculty building[55] designed by James Stirling, and the Cripps Building at St John's College.[56] The brickwork of several colleges is notable: Queens' College has some of the earliest patterned brickwork in England[57] and the brick walls of St John's College are examples of English bond, Flemish bond, and Running bond.[58]\n\n\n\n### Sites[edit]\n\n\nThe university is divided into several sites, which house the university's various departments, including:[59]\n\n\n\n* Addenbrooke's Hospital\n* Downing Site\n* Madingley/Gorton\n* New Museums Site\n* North West Cambridge Development\n* Old Addenbrooke's Site\n* Old Schools\n* Silver Street/Mill Lane\n* Sidgwick Site\n* West Cambridge\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** Vitullo-Martin, J.

Many nobles, intellectuals, and even commoners saw the Church of England as too similar to the Catholic Church and felt that it was being used by The Crown to usurp the counties' rightful powers. East Anglia emerged as the centre of what ultimately became the Puritan movement. In Cambridge, the Puritan movement was particularly strong at Emmanuel, St Catharine Hall, Sidney Sussex, and Christ's Colleges.[24] These colleges produced many non-conformist graduates who greatly influenced, by social position or preaching, some 20,000 Puritans who ultimately left England for New England and especially Massachusetts Bay Colony during the Great Migration decade of the 1630s, joining the Virginia colony and others in becoming settlers in some of the fledgling American colonies.\n\n\n\n### Mathematics and mathematical physics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lucasian Professor of Mathematics and Mathematical Tripos\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Cambridge University Physics Society (1995).

The economic growth associated with the university's high tech and biotech growth has been labeled the Cambridge Phenomenon, and has included the addition of 1,500 new companies and as many as 40,000 new jobs added between 1960 and 2010, mostly at Silicon Fen, a business cluster launched by the university in the late 20th century.[48]\n\n\n\n### Myths, legends and traditions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Cambridge legends\n\nSee also: Category:Terminology of the University of Cambridge\n\nFurther information: Nine Lessons and Carols and wooden spoon (award)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2000, Bill Gates of Microsoft donated US$210\u00a0million through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to endow Gates Scholarships for students from outside the United Kingdom pursuing post-graduate study at Cambridge.[93]\n\n\nIn October 2021, the university suspended its \u00a3400m collaboration with the United Arab Emirates, citing allegations that UAE was involved in illegal hacking of the university's computer and storage systems using NSO Group's Pegasus software. UAE also was behind the leak of over 50,000 phone numbers, including hundreds belonging to British citizens. Stephen Toope, the university's outgoing Vice-Chancellor, said the decision to suspend its collaboration with UAE also was a result of additional revelations about UAE's Pegasus software hacking.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Bonds[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge borrowed \u00a3350\u00a0million in October 2012 by issuing 40-year security bonds,[95] whose interest rate is approximately 0.6 percent higher than the British government's 40-year bond.[96]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe University of Cambridge has research departments and teaching faculties in nearly every academic discipline, and ll research and lectures are conducted by university departments. The colleges are charged with giving or arranging most supervisions, student accommodation, and funding most extracurricular activities. During the 1990s, the University of Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several sites around the city, and major expansion continues.[147] From 2000 to 2006, the University of Cambridge maintained a research partnership with MIT in the United States, known as the Cambridge\u2013MIT Institute, which was discontinued after evolving into what is now called the CMI Partnership Programme.\n\n\n\n### Graduation tradition and ceremony[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Koyama, Noboru; Ruxton, Ian, transl. \"*Japanese Students at Cambridge University in the Meiji Era, 1868\u20131912: Pioneers for the Modernization of Japan*\".

There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096,[2] making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.[2][11][12] It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.[2] After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge.[13] The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmong the earliest such founders were William of Durham, who in 1249 endowed University College,[25] and John Balliol, father of a future King of Scots; Balliol College bears his name.[23] Another founder, Walter de Merton, a Lord Chancellor of England and afterwards Bishop of Rochester, devised a series of regulations for college life;[26][27] Merton College thereby became the model for such establishments at Oxford,[28] as well as at the University of Cambridge. Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.[25]\n\n\nIn 1333\u20131334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III.[29] Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.[30][31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"What is an Oxford college?\".

Among university scholars of the period were William Grocyn, who contributed to the revival of Greek language studies,[32] and John Colet, the noted biblical scholar.[33]\n\n\nWith the English Reformation and the breaking of communion with the Roman Catholic Church, recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the University of Douai.[34] The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford's reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.[35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Seccombe, Thomas and H.

In addition, members of many religious orders, including Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites and Augustinians, settled in Oxford in the mid-13th century, gained influence and maintained houses or halls for students.[25] At about the same time, private benefactors established colleges as self-contained scholarly communities. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. **^** *2014/15 Financial Statements* (PDF), Oxford: University of Oxford, 2015, archived (PDF) from the original on 22 December 2015, retrieved 22 December 2015\n100. **^** \"Oxford college to launch scholarship in attempt to address slavery legacy\". *The Guardian*. 10 November 2017.

The present University of Manchester considers this date, which is also the date of foundation of the Royal School of Medicine and Surgery, one of the predecessor institutions of the Victoria University of Manchester, as its official foundation year, as indicated in its crest and logo. The founders of the institute believed that all professions somewhat relied on scientific principles. As such, the institute taught working individuals branches of science applicable to their existing occupations. They believed that the practical application of science would encourage innovation and advancements within those trades and professions.[14] The Victoria University of Manchester was founded in 1851, as Owens College. Academic research undertaken by the university was published via the Manchester University Press from 1904.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** \"Our History\". The University of Manchester.

In addition, the university is one of the richest in the UK in terms of income and interest from endowments: an estimate in 2008 placed it third, surpassed only by Oxford and Cambridge.[71]\n\n\nThe University of Manchester has attracted the most research income from UK industry of any institution in the country. The figures, from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), show that Manchester attracted \u00a324,831,000 of research income in 2016\u20132017 from UK industry, commerce and public corporations.[72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMany notable people have worked or studied at the University of Manchester, or its predecessor institutions, including 25 Nobel Prize laureates. Some of the best-known scientists are: John Dalton (founder of modern atomic theory), Ernest Rutherford who proved the nuclear nature of the atom whilst working at Manchester, Ludwig Wittgenstein (considered one of the most significant philosophers of the 20th century, who studied for a doctorate in engineering), George E. Davis (founder of the discipline of chemical engineering), Alan Turing (a founder of computer science and AI, and notable figure in gay rights history), Marie Stopes (pioneer of birth control and campaigner for women's rights), Bernard Lovell (a pioneer of radio astronomy), Tom Kilburn and Frederic Calland Williams (who developed the Manchester Baby, the world's first stored-program computer at Victoria University of Manchester in 1948), and physicist and television presenter Brian Cox.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe medical college was established in 1874 and is one of the largest in the country,[49] with more than 400 medical students trained in each clinical year and more than 350 students in the pre-clinical/phase 1 years. The university is a founding partner of the Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, established to focus high-end healthcare research in Greater Manchester.[50] In November 2018, Expertscape recognized it as one of the top ten institutions worldwide in COPD research and treatment.[51]\n\n\nIn 1883, a department of pharmacy was established at the university and, in 1904, Manchester became the first British university to offer an honours degree in the subject. The School of Pharmacy[52] benefits from links with Manchester Royal Infirmary and Wythenshawe and Hope hospitals providing its undergraduate students with hospital experience.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. **^** \"A Short History of The Whitworth Art Gallery\".

The Municipal College of Technology, forerunner of UMIST, was the Victoria University of Manchester's Faculty of Technology while continuing in parallel as a technical college offering advanced courses of study. Although UMIST achieved independent university status in 1955, the universities continued to work together.[23] However, in the late-20th century, formal connections between the university and UMIST diminished and in 1994 most of the remaining institutional ties were severed as new legislation allowed UMIST to become an autonomous university with powers to award its own degrees. A decade later the development was reversed.[6] The Victoria University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology agreed to merge into a single institution in March 2003.[24][25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2013 Manchester was given the Regius Professorship in Physics, the only one of its kind in the UK; the current holder is Andre Geim.\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Grade-I listed John Rylands Library on Deansgate\nMain article: University of Manchester Library\n\nThe University of Manchester Library is the largest non-legal deposit library in the UK and the third-largest academic library after those of Oxford and Cambridge.[75] It has the largest collection of electronic resources of any library in the UK.[75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nManchester reached the semi-finals in the 2010 competition before being beaten by Emmanuel College, Cambridge.

Manchester has traditionally been strong in the sciences; it is where the nuclear nature of the atom was discovered by Ernest Rutherford, and the world's first electronic stored-program computer was built at the university. Notable scientists associated with the university include physicists Ernest Rutherford, Osborne Reynolds, Niels Bohr, James Chadwick, Arthur Schuster, Hans Geiger, Ernest Marsden and Balfour Stewart. Contributions in other fields such as mathematics were made by Paul Erd\u0151s, Horace Lamb and Alan Turing and in philosophy by Samuel Alexander, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Alasdair MacIntyre. The author Anthony Burgess, Pritzker Prize and RIBA Stirling Prize-winning architect Norman Foster and composer Peter Maxwell Davies all attended, or worked at, Manchester.\n\n\n\n### Post-merger (2004 to present)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the eight years up to 2013, Manchester has won the BBC2 quiz programme *University Challenge* four times, drawing equal with Magdalen College, Oxford, for the highest number of series wins.[100] Since merging as the University of Manchester, the university has consistently reached the latter stages of the competition, progressing to at least the semi-finals every year since 2005.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Facilities | * Computing Machine Laboratory\n* Contact Theatre\n* Firs Botanical Grounds\n* Godlee Observatory\n* Jodrell Bank Observatory\n* John Rylands Library\n* Manchester Academy\n* Manchester Aquatics Centre\n* Manchester Conference Centre\n* Manchester Museum\n* Tabley House\n* UMIST linear system\n* University of Manchester Library\n* Whitworth Art Gallery\n |\n| Student life | * Christie Cup\n* Fuse FM\n* Students' Union\n* The Mancunion\n |\n| Halls of residence | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| City | * Denmark Road (Private)\n* George Kenyon Hall\n* Horniman House\n* Weston Hall (Private)\n* Whitworth Park\n |\n| Victoria Park | * Brook Hall (Private)\n* Burkhardt House\n* Canterbury Court\n* Daisy Bank Hall (Private)\n* Dalton-Ellis Hall\n* Greygarth Hall (Private, Male)\n* Hulme Hall\n* Rusholme Place (Private)\n* St Anselm Hall (Male)\n* Wilmslow Park (Private)\n |\n| Fallowfield | * Ashburne Hall\n* Oak House\n* Owens Park (Closed)\n* Richmond Park\n* Sheavyn House\n* Unsworth Park\n* Uttley House\n* Woolton Hall\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe museum's first collections were assembled in 1821 by the Manchester Society of Natural History, and subsequently expanded by the addition of the collections of Manchester Geological Society. Due to the society's financial difficulties and on the advice of evolutionary biologist Thomas Huxley, Owens College accepted responsibility for the collections in 1867. The college commissioned Alfred Waterhouse, architect of London's Natural History Museum, to design a museum on a site in Oxford Road to house the collections for the benefit of students and the public. The Manchester Museum was opened to the public in 1888.[77]\n\n\n\n#### Whitworth Art Gallery[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Whitworth Art Gallery\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe University of Manchester Students' Union is the representative body of students at the university and the UK's largest students' union.

It is notable for its triangular shaped accommodation blocks. Their designer took inspiration from a hill created from excavated soil which had been left in 1962 from an archaeological dig led by John Gater. A consequence of the triangular design was a reduced cost for the construction company. A deal struck between the university and Manchester City Council meant the council would pay for the roofs of all student residential buildings in the area. They were built in the mid-1970s.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are other university buildings across the city and the wider region, such as Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire and One Central Park in Moston, a collaboration between the university and other partners which offers office space for start-up firms and venues for conferences and workshops,[43]\n\n\n\n### Major projects[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The atrium inside the \u00a338m Manchester Institute of Biotechnology\nFollowing the merger, the university embarked on a \u00a3600 million programme of capital investment, to deliver eight new buildings and 15 major refurbishment projects by 2010, partly financed by a sale of unused assets.[44] These include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Thus the University of Paris assumed its basic form. It was composed of seven groups, the four nations of the faculty of arts, and the three superior faculties of theology, law, and medicine. Men who had studied at Paris became an increasing presence in the high ranks of the Church hierarchy; eventually, students at the University of Paris saw it as a right that they would be eligible to benefices. Church officials such as St. Louis and Clement IV lavishly praised the university.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOfficially chartered in 1200 by King Philip II of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent\u00a0III, it was later often nicknamed after its theological College of Sorbonne, founded by Robert de Sorbon and chartered by King Louis\u00a0IX around 1257.[1]\n\n\nHighly reputed internationally for its academic performance in the humanities ever since the Middle Ages \u2013 notably in theology and philosophy \u2013 it introduced several academic standards and traditions that have endured ever since and spread internationally, such as doctoral degrees and student nations. Notable popes, royalty, scientists, and intellectuals were educated at the University of Paris. A few of the colleges of the time are still visible close to the Panth\u00e9on and Jardin du Luxembourg: Coll\u00e8ge des Bernardins (18 rue de Poissy, 5th arr.), H\u00f4tel de Cluny (6 Place Paul Painlev\u00e9, 5th arr.), Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Barbe (4 rue Valette, 5th arr.), Coll\u00e8ge d'Harcourt (44 Boulevard Saint-Michel, 6th arr.), and Cordeliers (21 rue \u00c9cole de M\u00e9decine, 6th arr.).[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Franklin, Alfred: *La Sorbonne: ses origines, sa biblioth\u00e8que, les d\u00e9buts de l'imprimerie \u00e0 Paris et la succession de Richelieu d'apr\u00e8s des documents in\u00e9dits, 2. \u00e9dition*, Paris: L.

The pope intervened with a bull that began with lavish praise of the university: \"Paris\", said Gregory IX, \"mother of the sciences, is another Cariath-Sepher, city of letters\". He commissioned the Bishops of Le Mans and Senlis and the Archdeacon of Ch\u00e2lons to negotiate with the French Court for the restoration of the university, but by the end of 1230 they had accomplished nothing. Gregory IX then addressed a Bull of 1231 to the masters and scholars of Paris. Not only did he settle the dispute, he empowered the university to frame statutes concerning the discipline of the schools, the method of instruction, the defence of theses, the costume of the professors, and the obsequies of masters and students (expanding upon Robert de Cour\u00e7on's statutes). Most importantly, the pope granted the university the right to suspend its courses, if justice were denied it, until it should receive full satisfaction.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIts patriotism was especially manifested on two occasions. During the captivity of King John, when Paris was given over to factions, the university sought to restore peace; and under Louis\u00a0XIV, when the Spaniards crossed the Somme and threatened the capital, it placed two hundred men at the king's disposal and offered the Master of Arts degree gratuitously to scholars who should present certificates of service in the army (Jourdain, *Hist. de l'Univers. de Paris au XVIIe et XVIIIe si\u00e8cle*, 132\u201334; *Archiv. du minist\u00e8re de l'instruction publique*).\n\n\n\n### 1793: Abolition by the French Revolution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sorbonne as seen from *rue des \u00c9coles*.\nThe ancient university disappeared with the ancien r\u00e9gime in the French Revolution.

This reform was less an innovation than a recall to observance of the old rules, as was the reform of 1600, undertaken by the royal government with regard to the three higher faculties. Nonetheless, and as to the faculty of arts, the reform of 1600 introduced the study of Greek, of French poets and orators, and of additional classical figures like Hesiod, Plato, Demosthenes, Cicero, Virgil, and Sallust. The prohibition from teaching civil law was never well observed at Paris, but in 1679 Louis\u00a0XIV officially authorized the teaching of civil law in the faculty of decretals. The \"faculty of law\" hence replaced the \"faculty of decretals\". The colleges meantime had multiplied; those of Cardinal Le-Moine and Navarre were founded in the fourteenth century. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFurther information: List of universities and higher education institutions in the Paris region \u00a7\u00a0History since the dissolution of the University of Paris (1970)\n\nFollowing the disruption, de Gaulle appointed Edgar Faure as minister of education; Faure was assigned to prepare a legislative proposal for reform of the French university system, with the help of academics.[20] Their proposal was adopted on 12 November 1968;[21] in accordance with the new law, the faculties of the University of Paris were to reorganize themselves.[22] This led to the division of the University of Paris into 13 universities.\n\n\nIn 2017, Paris 4 and Paris 6 universities merged to form the Sorbonne University.[23] In 2019, Paris 5 and Paris 7 universities merged to form the new Paris Cit\u00e9 University, leaving the number of successor universities at 11.[24]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1793, during the French Revolution, the university was closed and, by Item 27 of the Revolutionary Convention, the college endowments and buildings were sold.[3] A new University of France replaced it in 1806 with four independent faculties: the Faculty of Humanities (French: *Facult\u00e9 des Lettres*), the Faculty of Law (later including Economics), the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Theology (closed in 1885).\n\n\nIn 1970, following the civil unrest of May 1968, the university was divided into 13 autonomous universities.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe chancellor of Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve continued to give degrees in arts, something he would have ceased if his abbey had no part in the university organization.\n\n\n\n### 13th\u201314th century: Expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Meeting of doctors at the University of Paris. From a 16th-century miniature.\nIn 1200, King Philip II issued a diploma \"for the security of the scholars of Paris,\" which affirmed that students were subject only to ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The provost and other officers were forbidden to arrest a student for any offence, unless to transfer him to ecclesiastical authority. The king's officers could not intervene with any member unless having a mandate from an ecclesiastical authority. His action followed a violent incident between students and officers outside the city walls at a pub.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe faculty and nation system of the University of Paris (along with that of the University of Bologna) became the model for all later medieval universities. Under the governance of the Church, students wore robes and shaved the tops of their heads in tonsure, to signify they were under the protection of the church. Students followed the rules and laws of the Church and were not subject to the king's laws or courts. This presented problems for the city of Paris, as students ran wild, and its official had to appeal to Church courts for justice. Students were often very young, entering the school at 13 or 14 years of age and staying for six to 12 years.\n\n\n\n### 12th century: Organisation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe pope authorized Pierre Le Mangeur to collect a moderate fee for the conferring of the license of professorship. Also, for the first time, the scholars had to pay tuition fees for their education: two sous weekly, to be deposited in the common fund.\n\n\n\n#### Rector[edit]\n\n\nThe university was organized as follows: at the head of the teaching body was a rector. The office was elective and of short duration; at first it was limited to four or six weeks. Simon de Brion, legate of the Holy See in France, realizing that such frequent changes caused serious inconvenience, decided that the rectorate should last three months, and this rule was observed for three years. Then the term was lengthened to one, two, and sometimes three years. The right of election belonged to the procurators of the four nations. Henry of Unna was proctor of the University of Paris in the 14th century, beginning his term on January 13, 1340.\n\n\n\n#### Four \"nations\"[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Hundred Years' War was fatal to these establishments, but the university set about remedying the injury.\n\n\nBesides its teaching, the University of Paris played an important part in several disputes: in the Church, during the Great Schism; in the councils, in dealing with heresies and divisions; in the State, during national crises. Under the domination of England it played a role in the trial of Joan of Arc.\n\n\nProud of its rights and privileges, the University of Paris fought energetically to maintain them, hence the long struggle against the mendicant orders on academic as well as on religious grounds. Hence also the shorter conflict against the Jesuits, who claimed by word and action a share in its teaching. It made extensive use of its right to decide administratively according to occasion and necessity. In some instances it openly endorsed the censures of the faculty of theology and pronounced condemnation in its own name, as in the case of the Flagellants.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe three schools: Notre-Dame, Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve, and Saint-Victor, may be regarded as the triple cradle of the *Universitas scholarium*, which included masters and students; hence the name *University*. Henry Denifle and some others hold that this honour is exclusive to the school of Notre-Dame (Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis), but the reasons do not seem convincing. He excludes Saint-Victor because, at the request of the abbot and the religious of Saint-Victor, Gregory IX in 1237 authorized them to resume the interrupted teaching of theology. But the university was largely founded about 1208, as is shown by a Bull of Innocent III. Consequently, the schools of Saint-Victor might well have contributed to its formation. Secondly, Denifle excludes the schools of Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve because there had been no interruption in the teaching of the liberal arts. This is debatable and through the period, theology was taught. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Science, Social sciences, Medicine, Law\n | 23,078\n | Cr\u00e9teil\n |\n\n\nThe successor universities to the University of Paris are now split over the three academies[*clarify*] of the \u00cele-de-France region.\n\n\nMost of these successor universities have joined several groups of universities and higher education institutions in the Paris region, created in the 2010s.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of University of Paris people\n\n### Faculty[edit]\n\n\n* ![Bonaventure](image)\n\nBonaventure\n* ![Fran\u00e7ois Guizot](image)\n\nFran\u00e7ois Guizot\n* ![Jean-Jacques Amp\u00e8re](image)\n\nJean-Jacques Amp\u00e8re\n* ![Victor Cousin](image)\n\nVictor Cousin\n* ![Henri Poincar\u00e9](image)\n\nHenri Poincar\u00e9\n\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Rue Saint-Jacques and the Sorbonne in Paris\nThe scattered condition of the scholars in Paris often made lodging difficult. Some students rented rooms from townspeople, who often exacted high rates while the students demanded lower. This tension between scholars and citizens would have developed into a sort of civil war if Robert de Cour\u00e7on had not found the remedy of taxation. It was upheld in the Bull of Gregory IX of 1231, but with an important modification: its exercise was to be shared with the citizens. The aim was to offer the students a shelter where they would fear neither annoyance from the owners nor the dangers of the world. Thus were founded the colleges (colligere, to assemble); meaning not centers of instruction, but simple student boarding-houses. Each had a special goal, being established for students of the same nationality or the same science. Often, masters lived in each college and oversaw its activities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThree schools were especially famous in Paris: the *palatine or palace school*, the *school of Notre-Dame*, and that of Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve Abbey. The decline of royalty brought about the decline of the first. The other two were ancient but did not have much visibility in the early centuries. The glory of the palatine school doubtless eclipsed theirs, until it completely gave way to them. These two centres were much frequented and many of their masters were esteemed for their learning. The first renowned professor at the school of Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve was Hubold, who lived in the tenth century. Not content with the courses at Li\u00e8ge, he continued his studies at Paris, entered or allied himself with the chapter of Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve, and attracted many pupils via his teaching. Distinguished professors from the school of Notre-Dame in the eleventh century include Lambert, disciple of Fulbert of Chartres; Drogo of Paris; Manegold of Germany; and Anselm of Laon. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe number of students in the school of the capital grew constantly, so that lodgings were insufficient. French students included princes of the blood, sons of the nobility, and ranking gentry. The courses at Paris were considered so necessary as a completion of studies that many foreigners flocked to them. Popes Celestine II, Adrian IV and Innocent III studied at Paris, and Alexander III sent his nephews there. Noted German and English students included Otto of Freisingen, Cardinal Conrad, Archbishop of Mainz, St. Thomas of Canterbury, and John of Salisbury; while Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve became practically the seminary for Denmark. The chroniclers of the time called Paris the city of letters par excellence, placing it above Athens, Alexandria, Rome, and other cities: \"At that time, there flourished at Paris philosophy and all branches of learning, and there the seven arts were studied and held in such esteem as they never were at Athens, Egypt, Rome, or elsewhere in the world.\" (\"Les gestes de Philippe-Auguste\"). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Paris\n |\n| Paris VII\n | Paris Diderot University | Faculty of Sciences, Faculty of Letters, and Faculty of Medicine\n | Science, Medicine, Humanities, Social sciences, Arts\n | Paris\n |\n| Paris VIII\n | University of Vincennes\n | Paris 8 University Vincennes-Saint-Denis | Vincennes University Center (Most professors were from Faculty of Humanities)\n | Social sciences\n | 14,070\n | Cr\u00e9teil\n |\n| Paris IX\n | Paris-IX University\n | Paris Dauphine University - PSL (*grande \u00e9cole* of PSL University)\n | Dauphine University Center (The professors were from the Department of Economics of the Faculty of Law and Economics)\n | Mathematics, Computer Science, Management, Economics, Finance, Law, Political Science, Journalism\n | 10,000\n | Cr\u00e9teil\n |\n| Paris X\n | Universit\u00e9 Paris Ouest\n | Paris Nanterre University | Faculty of Law and Economics and Faculty of Humanities in Nanterre, along with Ville-d'Avray University Institute of Technology\n | Law, humanities, political science, social and natural sciences and economics.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPoets extolled the university in their verses, comparing it to all that was greatest, noblest, and most valuable in the world.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sorbonne covered by snow.\nTo allow poor students to study the first college des dix-Huit was founded by a knight returning from Jerusalem called Josse of London for 18 scholars who received lodgings and 12 pence or denarii a month.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Number\n | Previous name\n | Current name\n | Faculties/institutes before breakup\n | Current subjects\n | Students\n | Academy\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Paris I\n | University of Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne | Faculty of Law and Economics (35 out of 41 of the economics Professors joined, along with a few professors from law) and the Faculty of Humanities.

A Bolognese compendium of canon law called the *Decretum Gratiani* brought about a division of the theology department. Hitherto the discipline of the Church had not been separate from so-called theology; they were studied together under the same professor. But this vast collection necessitated a special course, which was undertaken first at Bologna, where Roman law was taught. In France, first Orl\u00e9ans and then Paris erected chairs of canon law. Before the end of the twelfth century, the Decretals of Gerard La Pucelle, Mathieu d'Angers, and Anselm (or Anselle) of Paris, were added to the Decretum Gratiani. However, civil law was not included at Paris. In the twelfth century, medicine began to be publicly taught at Paris: the first professor of medicine in Paris records is Hugo, *physicus excellens qui quadrivium docuit*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Map showing the territories covered by the four nations of the University of Paris during the Middle Ages.\nMain article: Nation (university)\n\nThe \"nations\" appeared in the second half of the twelfth century. They were mentioned in the Bull of Honorius III in 1222. Later, they formed a distinct body. By 1249, the four nations existed with their procurators, their rights (more or less well-defined), and their keen rivalries: the nations were the French, English, Normans, and Picards. After the Hundred Years' War, the English nation was replaced by the Germanic. The four nations constituted the faculty of arts or letters.\n\n\nThe territories covered by the four nations were:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Old Sorbonne on fire in 1670.\n![](image)The Sorbonne, Paris, in a 17th-century engraving\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe university was re-established by Napoleon on 1 May 1806. All the faculties were replaced by a single centre, the University of France. The decree of 17 March 1808 created five distinct faculties: Law, Medicine, Letters/Humanities, Sciences, and Theology; traditionally, Letters and Sciences had been grouped together into one faculty, that of \"Arts\". After a century, people recognized that the new system was less favourable to study. The defeat of 1870 at the hands of Prussia was partially blamed on the growth of the superiority of the German university system of the 19th century, and led to another serious reform of the French university. In the 1880s, the \"licence\" (bachelor) degree is divided into, for the Faculty of Letters: Letters, Philosophy, History, Modern Languages, with French, Latin and Greek being requirements for all of them; and for the Faculty of Science, into: Mathematics, Physical Sciences and Natural Sciences; the Faculty of Theology is abolished by the Republic. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Irish College in Paris originated in 1578 with students dispersed between Coll\u00e8ge Montaigu, Coll\u00e8ge de Boncourt, and the Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre, in 1677 it was awarded possession of the Coll\u00e8ge des Lombards.

In 1802, the university was renamed the Ludwig Maximilian University in honour of its two founders, Louis IX, Duke of Bavaria and Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria. The Minister of Education, Maximilian von Montgelas, initiated a number of reforms that sought to modernize the rather conservative and Jesuit-influenced university. In 1826, it was moved to Munich, the capital of the Kingdom of Bavaria. The university was situated in the Old Academy until a new building in the Ludwigstra\u00dfe was completed. The locals were somewhat critical of the number of Protestant professors Maximilian and later Ludwig I invited to Munich. They were dubbed the \"Nordlichter\" (northern lights) and especially physician Johann Nepomuk von Ringseis was quite angry about them.[4]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Portrait of Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, after whom the University of Munich was renamed in 1802\n![](image)Adolf von Baeyer, Emil Fischer, Jacob Volhard and other chemists at LMU in 1877\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Scherf, Martina (3 December 2019). \"Eingepfercht f\u00fcr die Forschung\". *S\u00fcddeutsche.de* (in German).

The Faculty of Forestry Operations with number 06 has been integrated into the Technical University of Munich in 1999 and faculty number 14 has been merged with faculty number 13.[14][15][16][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Academic Ranking of World Universities ranks LMU Munich joint 2nd nationally and 59th in the world as of 2023.[22] In the subjects of physics, education, communication, public administration, and hospitality, it is ranked first in Germany.[25]\n\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, the LMU took 1st place based on the number of DAX board of management members.[26][27] The top 3 universities in 2019 were the LMU Munich, the RWTH Aachen and the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt.[27] According to the funding report of the German Research Foundation (DFG) of 2021, which breaks down the grants from 2017 to 2019, LMU Munich ranked 1st among German universities. By area, it ranked 1st in the life sciences, 2nd in the humanities and social sciences, and 6th in the natural sciences.[28] In November 2018 Expertscape recognized it as one of the top ten institutions in the world in pancreatic cancer.[29]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the Third Reich, academic freedom was severely curtailed. In 1943, the White Rose group, consisting of anti-Nazi students, carried out a campaign opposing the National Socialists at this institution. The university subsequently removed Kurt Huber, a Nazi opposition fighter, from his position and revoked his doctorate upon his arrest.\n\n\nBetween 1933 and 1936, Karl Escherich served as rector at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, followed by Leopold K\u00f6lbl from 1936 to 1938, Philipp Broemser from 1938 to 1941, and finally, Walther W\u00fcst from 1941 to 1945.\n\n\n\n### 1945\u2013present[edit]\n\n\n![View of the main building of LMU from Professor-Huber-Platz in 2017](image)\nView of the main building of LMU from Professor-Huber-Platz in 2017\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: List of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich people and List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation\n\nThe alumni of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich played a major role in the development of quantum mechanics. Max Planck, the founder of quantum theory and Nobel laureate in Physics in 1918, was an alumnus of the university. Founders of quantum mechanics such as Werner Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, and others were associated with the university.\nMost recently, to honor the Nobel laureate in Chemistry Gerhard Ertl, who worked as a professor at the University of Munich from 1973 to 1986, the building of the Physical Chemistry was named after him.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversities and colleges in Munich\n |\n| --- |\n| Universities | * Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU)\n* Technical University of Munich (TUM)\n* Bundeswehr University Munich (UniBw)\n* Ukrainian Free University (UFU)\n |\n| Other | * Academy of Fine Arts (AdBK)\n* Bavarian School of Public Policy (HfP)\n* FOM University of Applied Sciences\n* Munich Business School (MBS)\n* University of Applied Sciences (HM)\n* University of Music and Theatre (HfMT)\n* University of Philosophy (HfPh)\n* University of Television and Film (HFF)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe LMU and the Technical University of Munich have come together to work on \"One Munich Strategy Forum\", with a \u20ac2.5 million fund from the state of Bavaria.[30]\n\n\n\n### Munich International Summer University[edit]\n\n\nThe Munich International Summer University (MISU at LMU) is the Summer University by LMU, which takes place annually in Munich and depending on the course also involves stays at different European cities. MISU invites international students to attend short-term programs at the LMU Munich in order to progress academically even in winter or summer breaks at their home university. MISU hereby offers two course formats: On the one hand German Language classes are held at different times over the year. On the other hand, MISU offers 16 subject-specific Summer Schools and Winter Schools covering a wide range of academic fields. Around 1000 students from nearly 90 countries joined MISU short-term programs in 2019.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn Friday 13 October 2006, a blue-ribbon panel announced the results of the Germany-wide Excellence Initiative for promoting top university research and education. The panel, composed of the German Research Foundation and the German Science Council, has decided that LMU Munich will receive funding for all three areas covered by the Initiative: one graduate school, three \"excellence clusters\" and general funding for the university's \"future concept\".\n\n\nIn January 2012, scientists at the Ludwig Maximilian University published details of the most sensitive listening device known so far. This has led to the college being inducted into the Guinness Book of World Records.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)LMU's institutes and research centers are spread throughout Munich.\n![](image)Entrance to LMU's main building\n![](image)Subway station Universit\u00e4t serves LMU's main campus via lines U3/U6.\n![](image)LMU Klinikum \u2013 Campus Gro\u00dfhadern, the hospital\nLMU's institutes and research centers are spread throughout Munich, with several buildings located in the suburbs of Oberschleissheim and Garching as well as Maisach and Bad T\u00f6lz. The university's main buildings are grouped around Geschwister-Scholl-Platz and Professor-Huber-Platz on Ludwigstrasse, extending into side streets such as Akademiestra\u00dfe, Schellingstra\u00dfe, and Veterin\u00e4rstra\u00dfe. Other large campuses and institutes are located in Gro\u00dfhadern (Klinikum Gro\u00dfhadern), Martinsried (chemistry and biotechnology campus), the Ludwigsvorstadt (Klinikum Innenstadt) and in the Lehel (Institut am Englischen Garten), across from the main buildings, through the Englischer Garten.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA central aim of MISU is to boost the internationality of the LMU Munich in terms of research and teaching.[35] Compared to semester-based student exchange programs, short-term programs such as Summer Schools have the advantage for international students to receive a very intensive and concise insight into the research areas and campus at the LMU Munich.[36] MISU hereby has the objective to combine excellent academic education with extra-curricular activities. Participants are thus not only supervised intensively by established researchers on selected topics but are also introduced to the history, culture and politics of Munich, Bavaria and Germany. Moreover, the Summer University allows the LMU Munich to intensify cooperation with international partner universities. MISU's short-term programs therefore strengthen the LMU's international visibility as one of the highest ranked universities in Europe.[37][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and faculty members[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| University rankings |\n| --- |\n| Overall \u2013 Global & National |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ***QS* World** 2024[20] | ![Rise](image)\u00a054 | ![Same position](image)\u00a02 |\n| ***THE* World** 2024[21] | ![Fall](image)\u00a0=38 | ![Same position](image)\u00a02 |\n| ***ARWU* World** 2023[22] | ![Fall](image)\u00a059 | ![Same position](image)\u00a0=2 |\n| ***QS* Europe**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***QS* Employability**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***THE* Employability**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n\n |\n\n\nThe 2024 QS World University Rankings rank LMU Munich 54th overall in the world and 2nd in Germany.[20] In the 2023 QS Subject Rankings, the university is highly ranked in the arts and humanities, natural sciences, and life sciences and medicine.[23]\n\n\nThe Times Higher Education Ranking 2024 ranks LMU Munich 2nd in Germany, and 38th in the world.[21] In the 2023 THE subject rankings, LMU is ranked first in Germany in the arts and humanities, law, and psychology.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPSM)\n* Graduate School of Systemic Neurosciences (GSN)\n* Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen \u2013 German Research Center for Environmental Health\n* Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM)\n* Parmenides Center for the Study of Thinking\n* Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society\n\n\n### Tuition and fees[edit]\n\n\nUniversities in Bavaria do not charge tuition fees. Instead, a semester fee and a mandatory off-hours public transportation semester ticket (for the Munich Transport and Tariff Association, MVV) have to be paid. A full network pass is optionally available. This mixed model is the result of several years of negotiations to allow students to get an affordable semester ticket despite the high costs of regular tickets in Munich. The current package was accepted by an overwhelming majority of 86.3% of students across all Munich universities in 2012 and introduced in the 2013 winter term.[19]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLMU is currently the second-largest university in Germany in terms of student population; in the 2018/19 winter semester, the university had a total of 51,606 matriculated students.
