Three of their films have won the Animage Grand Prix award, four have won the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year, and five have received Academy Award nominations. *Spirited Away* won the 2002 Golden Bear and the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[8]\n\n\nOn August 3, 2014, Studio Ghibli temporarily suspended production following Miyazaki's retirement. In February 2017, Suzuki announced that Miyazaki had come out of retirement to direct a new feature film, *The Boy and the Heron* (2023).[9][10] In September 2023, Nippon TV announced that Studio Ghibli would become a unit of Nippon Television Holdings in October.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n140. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Studio Ghibli Movies \u2013 A Deep Analysis of the Themes\". *Pop Up Tee*.

Their work has been well-received by audiences and recognized with numerous awards. Their mascot and most recognizable symbol, the character Totoro, is a giant spirit inspired by raccoon dogs (*tanuki*) and cats[5] from the 1988 film *My Neighbor Totoro*. Among the studio's highest-grossing films are *Spirited Away* (2001), *Howl's Moving Castle* (2004), and *Ponyo* (2008).[6] Studio Ghibli was founded on June 15, 1985, by the directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after acquiring Topcraft's assets. The studio has also collaborated with video game studios on the visual development of several games.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n125. **^** \"The Wind Rises (2014)\". *Rotten Tomatoes*.

The films use traditional methods of making animation where every frame is drawn and colored by hand. Computer animation techniques are used sparingly.[138] All the Studio Ghibli films use bright colors,[139][140] and have a \"whimsical and joyful aesthetic\".[141] Studio Ghibli\u2019s art style tends to be more of a cozy European style that put a lot of undertones on the background and nature in the scene.[142]\n\n\nThe films often focus on the lives of youth, especially school children. Common themes include the risks posed by progress to tradition,[143] environmentalism and the natural world,[143][141] independent female protagonists,[139] the cost of war, and youth.[140]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nRayna Denison argues that, despite the feminist themes of Ghibli films, the studio has been reluctant to promote women within the company and regularly overworks its laborers, including on public holidays.[144]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n87. **^** \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (1984)\". *Rotten Tomatoes*.

Other directors who have worked with Studio Ghibli include Yoshifumi Kond\u014d, Hiroyuki Morita, Gor\u014d Miyazaki, and Hiromasa Yonebayashi. Composer Joe Hisaishi has provided the soundtracks for most of Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli films. In their book *Anime Classics Zettai!*, Brian Camp and Julie Davis made note of Michiyo Yasuda as \"a mainstay of Studio Ghibli's extraordinary design and production team\".[18] At one time the studio was based in Kichij\u014dji, Musashino, Tokyo.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile not technically Studio Ghibli films, *The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun* (1968), *Panda! Go Panda!* (1972), *The Castle of Cagliostro* (1979), *Jarinko Chie* (1981), *Gauche the Cellist* (1982), *Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind* (1984), *The Red Turtle* (2016), *Mary and the Witch's Flower* (2017) and *Modest Heroes* (2018) are sometimes grouped together with the Studio Ghibli library (particularly with the *Ghibli ga Ippai* home video collection released by Walt Disney Studios Japan) due to their ties to the studio.\n\n\n*Horus* and *Cagliostro* were the feature-length directorial debuts of Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki respectively, and were produced by Toei Animation and TMS Entertainment years before the founding of Studio Ghibli.\n\n\n*Nausica\u00e4* was directed by Miyazaki at Topcraft, a studio which Miyazaki, Takahata and Toshio Suzuki later purchased and renamed Studio Ghibli. As a result, the film has often been rereleased and marketed as a Studio Ghibli movie.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | *Pom Poko* | Isao Takahata | Shang Shang Typhoon | July 16, 1994\n | 86%[103] | 77[104] |\n| 1995\n | *Whisper of the Heart* | Yoshifumi Kond\u014d | Hayao Miyazaki | Yuji Nomi | July 15, 1995\n | 94%[105] | 75[106] |\n| 1997\n | *Princess Mononoke* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 12, 1997\n | 93%[107] | 76[108] |\n| 1999\n | *My Neighbors the Yamadas* | Isao Takahata | Akiko Yano | July 17, 1999\n | 78%[109] | 75[110] |\n| 2001\n | *Spirited Away* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 20, 2001\n | 96%[111] | 96[112] |\n| 2002\n | *The Cat Returns* | Hiroyuki Morita | Reiko Yoshida | Toshio SuzukiNozomu Takahashi\n | Yuji Nomi | July 19, 2002\n | 88%[113] | 70[114] |\n| 2004\n | *Howl's Moving Castle* | Hayao Miyazaki | Toshio Suzuki | Joe Hisaishi | November 20, 2004\n | 87%[115] | 82[116] |\n| 2006\n | *Tales from Earthsea* | Gor\u014d Miyazaki | Gor\u014d MiyazakiKeiko Niwa\n | Tamiya Terashima\n | July 29, 2006\n | 38%[117] | 47[118] |\n| 2008\n | *Ponyo* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 19, 2008\n | 91%[119] | 86[120] |\n| 2010\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Screenwriter(s)\n | Producer(s)\n | Composer\n | Original release\n | RT | MC |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1984\n | *Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind* | Hayao Miyazaki | Isao Takahata | Joe Hisaishi | March 11, 1984\n | 90%[87] | 86[88] |\n| 1986\n | *Castle in the Sky* | August 2, 1986\n | 96%[89] | 78[90] |\n| 1988\n | *My Neighbor Totoro* | T\u014dru Hara\n | April 16, 1988\n | 93%[91] | 86[92] |\n| *Grave of the Fireflies* | Isao Takahata | Michio Mamiya | 100%[93] | 94[94] |\n| 1989\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 29, 1989\n | 98%[95] | 83[96] |\n| 1991\n | *Only Yesterday* | Isao Takahata | Toshio Suzuki | Katz Hoshi\n | July 20, 1991\n | 100%[97] | 90[98] |\n| 1992\n | *Porco Rosso* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 18, 1992\n | 96%[99] | 83[100] |\n| 1993\n | *Ocean Waves* | Tomomi Mochizuki | Seiji OkudaNozomu Takahashi\n | Shigeru Nagata\n | May 5, 1993[A] | 89%[101] | 73[102] |\n| 1994\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u7248\u5b98\u5831\". *kanpou.npb.go.jp*.
