The lowest scoring top scorer was in 1962, when six players tied at only four goals each. Across the 22 tournaments of the World Cup, 31 footballers have been credited with the most tournament goals, and no one has achieved this feat twice. Ten of them scored at least seven goals in a tournament, while Brazil's Jairzinho and Argentine's Lionel Messi were the only footballers to score at least seven goals without being the top goalscorer of the tournament in 1970 and 2022, respectively.

Since then, only 25 players have scored more at all the games played at the World Cup than St\u00e1bile did throughout the 1930 tournament. The first was Hungary's S\u00e1ndor Kocsis with eleven in 1954. At the next tournament, France's Just Fontaine improved on this record with 13 goals in only six games. Gerd M\u00fcller scored 10 for West Germany in 1970 and broke the overall record when he scored his 14th goal in a tournament match at a World Cup during West Germany's win in the 1974 final. His record stood for more than three decades until Ronaldo's 15 goals between 1998 and 2006 for Brazil. Germany's Miroslav Klose went on to score a record 16 goals across four consecutive tournaments between 2002 and 2014.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Valentin Ivanov | ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union | 9\n | 0.56\n | 1958, 1962\n | list[93] |\n| Emilio Butrague\u00f1o | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | 9\n | 0.56\n | 1986, (1990)\n | list[94] |\n| Roger Milla\u2666 | ![](image)\u00a0Cameroon | 9\n | 0.56\n | (1982), 1990, 1994\n | [95] |\n| Tim Cahill\u2666 | ![](image)\u00a0Australia | 9\n | 0.56\n | 2006, 2010, 2014, (2018)\n | list[96][97] |\n| Hans Krankl | ![](image)\u00a0Austria | 10\n | 0.50\n | 1978, 1982\n | list[98] |\n| Ra\u00fal | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | 11\n | 0.45\n | 1998, 2002, 2006\n | list[99] |\n| Garrincha | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 12\n | 0.42\n | (1958\u2020), 1962\u2020, 1966\n | [100] |\n| Johan Neeskens | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | 12\n | 0.42\n | 1974, (1978)\n | [101] |\n| Fernando Hierro | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | 12\n | 0.42\n | [1990], 1994, 1998, 2002\n | list[102] |\n| Zinedine Zidane | ![](image)\u00a0France | 12\n | 0.42\n | 1998\u2020, (2002), 2006\n | [103] |\n| Landon Donovan\u2666 | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 12\n | 0.42\n | 2002, (2006), 2010\n | list[104] |\n| Romelu Lukaku\u2666# | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | 12\n | 0.42\n | 2014, 2018, (2022)\n | list[105] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n90. **^** \"Rom\u00e1rio (Rom\u00e1rio de Souza Faria)\".

As a teenager, Neymar was inspired by Messi.[312]\nNeymar primarily plays as either a central striker, second striker, winger or occasionally as an attacking midfielder, and has been described as \"a true phenomenon\".[313][314] Highlighting both his prolific scoring and playmaking abilities, he stands as PSG's fourth-highest-goalscorer of all time and fifth-highest-assister of all time.[315] He often plays as a left sided forward for both club and country in the team's 4\u20133\u20133 formation, drifting infield, due to his energetic pace and playmaking skills; this position allows him to shoot with his stronger foot, or create chances for teammates.[314]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNeymar is a Christian,[11][12] and follows the Pentecostal branch of the religion.[370] Neymar has spoken about his faith saying: \"Life only makes sense when our highest ideal is to serve Christ!\"[371] Additionally, he has sometimes worn a headband with the words \"100% Jesus\".[372]\nNeymar reportedly also tithes (10%) his income to his church and has named Kak\u00e1 as his religious role model.[373] Each year, Neymar organises a charity match with fellow Brazilian footballer Nen\u00ea in Nen\u00ea's hometown of Jundia\u00ed, with the purpose of raising food for needy families.[374] In addition to his native Portuguese, Neymar also speaks Spanish.[375][376]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNeymar| ![](image)Neymar playing for Al Hilal in 2023\n |\n| Personal information |\n| Full name | \nNeymar da Silva Santos J\u00fanior[1] |\n| Date of birth |  (1992-02-05) 5 February 1992 (age\u00a032)[1] |\n| Place of birth | Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil[2] |\n| Height | \n1.75\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in)[1] |\n| Position(s) | Forward, attacking midfielder |\n| Team information |\n| Current team\n | Al Hilal |\n| Number | \n10 |\n| Youth career |\n| 1999\u20132003 | Portuguesa Santista |\n| 2003\u20132009 | Santos |\n| Senior career\\* |\n| Years | **Team** | **Apps** | **(Gls)** |\n| 2009\u20132013 | Santos | \n177 | \n(107) |\n| 2013\u20132017 | Barcelona | \n123 | \n(68) |\n| 2017\u20132023 | Paris Saint-Germain | \n112 | \n(82) |\n| 2023\u2013 | Al Hilal | \n3 | \n(0) |\n| International career\u2021 |\n| 2009 | Brazil U17 | \n3 | \n(1) |\n| 2011 | Brazil U20 | \n7 | \n(9) |\n| 2012\u20132016 | Brazil U23 | \n14 | \n(8) |\n| 2010\u2013 | Brazil | \n128 | \n(79) |\n| Medal record\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Neymar (middle) celebrating a goal with PSG team-mates Messi and Mbapp\u00e9\nFollowing a disappointing form in the previous season and with the club's change in transfer policy, Neymar was linked with a potential departure from the club, but the lack of potential suitors broke down a potential move, despite PSG's Football Advisor Lu\u00eds Campos dismissing those rumours \u2013 stating that Neymar was part of the club's project.[197] He quickly regained his form from his previous season, starting off the season by scoring a goal and providing an hat-trick of assists in a 5\u20130 win against Clermont on 6 August.[197][198] As part of his prolific attacking trio alongside Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Lionel Messi, on 21 August, all three scored and assisted with Neymar netting twice and registering three more assists in PSG's 7\u20131 away win over Lille.[199][200] After registering 13 goal contributions in his first five league games, Neymar was named Ligue 1's Player of the Month in August.[197][201]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn September 2011, Santos club president Lu\u00eds Ribeiro threatened to report Real Madrid to FIFA following reports that they had attempted to sign Neymar to a pre-contract agreement, and denied that such an agreement was in place.[44] On 9 November 2011, Neymar and Santos agreed to a contract extension that would see the player stay with the club until after the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The deal reportedly increased Neymar's wages by 50%, to the levels that top European clubs would be paying him.[45] On 14 December 2011, Neymar scored the opening goal for Santos as they defeated Kashiwa Reysol 3\u20131 in the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup at the Toyota Stadium in Toyota, Japan, but failed to score against Barcelona in the final on 18 December 2011, where Santos were defeated 4\u20130, finishing as runners-up in the competition.[46] He won the 2011 FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award for scoring a solo goal in the Brasileir\u00e3o S\u00e9rie A against Flamengo, in a 5\u20134 loss. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNeymar began playing football at an early age and he was soon spotted by Santos who offered him a contract in 2003, where he was inducted into their youth academy, which has, in the past, produced Brazilian internationals like Coutinho, Clodoaldo, Diego, Elano and Alex. He also joined the likes of Pepe, Pel\u00e9 and Robinho in starting out his career at the club, nicknamed *Peixe*.[20] While in the youth academy, Neymar met Paulo Henrique Ganso, becoming good friends in the process. Aged 14, Neymar travelled to Spain for try outs with the Real Madrid youth team, at the time when Real had stars like Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Roberto Carlos and Robinho. He did not stay in Madrid, however, as his father decided at the time that he preferred the young prodigy to keep growing up while playing at Santos.[21][22]\n\n\n\n#### 2009: Debut season[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Neymar (right) with Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Lionel Messi against Marseille during Le Classique, October 2021\nOn 10 August 2021, Neymar's former Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi signed for PSG.[186] On 29 August, Neymar made his first appearance of the season, being a starter in a 2\u20130 win over Reims. Messi replaced Neymar at 66th minute of the match, making his debut for the French club.[187] Neymar scored his first goal of the 2021\u201322 season on 19 September, converting a penalty in a 2\u20131 win over Lyon.[188] He scored his 400th career goal on 6 November against Bordeaux, where he scored a brace and helped the team to win the match 3\u20132.[189]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n423. **^** \"DAZN to premiere Neymar Jr And The Line Of Kings\". *Broadcastnow.co.uk*.

In the group stage, he scored the winning goal as Switzerland came from behind to defeat Serbia 2\u20131. He and fellow goalscorer Granit Xhaka, who is also of Kosovar descent, celebrated their goals by making an eagle gesture, a symbol of ethnic Albanians.[98][99][100][101] Switzerland captain Stephan Lichtsteiner, who is not of Albanian origin, did the same gesture to celebrate Shaqiri's goal, and defended both players after the match.[102] FIFA fined Xhaka and Shaqiri 10,000 Swiss francs \"for unsporting behaviour contrary to the principles of fair-play\", while Lichtsteiner paid 5,000 Swiss francs.[103][104] Additionally, with the goal he equalled St\u00e9phane Chapuisat's tally of 21 in internationals and entered Switzerland's top ten scorers of all time.[105]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShaqiri started his career at hometown club SV Augst, and at the age of eight he was scouted by FC Basel.[10] Whilst playing for Basel's youth team, he competed in the Under-15 Nike Cup 2007 and was named the best player of the tournament. Despite having several other clubs attempting to sign him, he decided to stay with Basel, where he played for their reserve team from 2007 to 2009 in the Swiss 1. Liga. Two years later, Shaqiri signed his first professional contract with Basel on 2 January 2009, with the new contract keeping him at St. Jakob-Park until December 2011.[12]\n\n\nShaqiri made his Basel club debut as a substitute on 12 July 2009 in Basel's 2009\u201310 season opening match against FC St. Gallen at the AFG Arena.[13] Four months later he scored his first goal for Basel in a 4\u20131 win over Neuch\u00e2tel Xamax at home on 9 November 2009.[14] At the end of the 2009\u201310 season Shaqiri won the national Double with Basel, and a year later won the league title again.[15][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShaqiri was part of Switzerland's squad at the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals in Portugal. He was named in the Team of the Tournament.[106]\n\n\n\n#### UEFA Euro 2020[edit]\n\n\nSee also: UEFA Euro 2020\n\nShaqiri was named in the 26-man Swiss squad for the postponed UEFA Euro 2020.[107] On 20 June 2021, he scored twice in the 26th and 68th minutes against Turkey in a group stage match.[108] On 2 July 2021, he scored in the quarter final of the tournament against Spain.[109] The match ended 1\u20131 and went to a penalty shoot-out, in which Spain progressed to the semi-finals.[110]\n\n\n\n#### 2022 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\nOn 15 November 2021, Shaqiri became only the fifth Swiss player to reach 100 caps when he started Switzerland's final 2022 World Cup qualifier against Bulgaria.[111]\n\n\n\n## Style of play[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlso capable of playing as an attacking midfielder, a 2011 scouting profile by Jamie Sanderson of *The Independent* described Shaqiri with the following words: \"Diminutive, agile and pacy across the turf, Shaqiri boasts excellent technique and balance. He's left footed, but comfortable and equally effective on either wing or as a classic play-maker, boasting good vision and almost zero back lift in his passing and shooting.\" He also added that Shaqiri's \"tricks,\" \"direct running style,\" and \"composure,\" made him \"a player who's dangerous in almost any attacking area.\" However, while he acknowledged the young winger's promising talent and potential to become a top player, he also noted that he had a poor work rate and lacked maturity.[115]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShaqiri primarily plays as a right winger and FIFA's official website describes him as \"unpredictable on the ball, adept with both feet, clinical in front of goal and possessing excellent vision.\"[112] He was described in *The Daily Telegraph* as \"stocky and powerful\" with a \"wand of a left foot\".[113] He is nicknamed \"the Alpine Messi\"[6] and \"the magic dwarf\".[114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShaqiri scored his first goal for Liverpool on 27 October, scoring the third goal in a 4\u20131 win over Cardiff City.[67] In November, he was left out of the club's Champions League trip to Red Star Belgrade in Serbia to avoid controversy over his pro-Albanian views.[68] The following month, during the North West derby, Shaqiri scored twice after coming on as a substitute to guide Liverpool to a 3\u20131 win which saw the club record a league victory over Manchester United for the first time since March 2014.[69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShaqiri was promoted to the Switzerland senior team in 2010, making his debut on 3 March 2010 in a 3\u20131 friendly loss against Uruguay. He was included in the 2010 World Cup squad, after receiving a surprise call-up from manager Ottmar Hitzfeld. Shaqiri scored his first goal for them on 7 September 2010, a long range left-footed shot, in a 1\u20133 loss against England in a Euro 2012 qualifier. He netted a hat-trick in another Euro 2012 qualifier on 6 September 2011, as Switzerland came from behind to beat Bulgaria 3\u20131.[87] Switzerland also tried to select him to participate in the 2012 Olympic Football tournament, but he opted to stay at his new club for pre-season training.[88]\n\n\n\n#### 2014 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\nOn 11 September 2012, Shaqiri did not sing the Swiss national anthem in a World Cup qualifier against his ancestral Albania in Lucerne, and did not celebrate when he scored the opening goal of a 2\u20130 win. He wore boots with the flags of Kosovo, Albania and Switzerland for the match.[89]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShaqiri transferred to Italian club Inter Milan on 9 January 2015 for \u20ac15\u00a0million,[26] signing a four-and-a-half-year contract,[27] though English club Stoke City had previously declared an interest in signing him.[28] With his previous number of 23 being taken by Andrea Ranocchia, Shaqiri chose the number 91 for his Inter shirt, representing his birth year.[29] He was an unused substitute in Inter's 3\u20131 victory over Genoa at San Siro.[30] He made his debut for Inter on 17 January, playing in the last 16 minutes as a substitute for fellow new signing Lukas Podolski.[31] Shaqiri made his Coppa Italia debut in a match against Sampdoria in the round of 16 on 22 January, scoring the first goal of the match and helping the team to a 2\u20130 win to progress into the quarter-finals.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing Switzerland's first game at Euro 2016, Shaqiri declared he would switch allegiance to Kosovo if their manager would make him captain, in reaction to Switzerland manager Vladimir Petkovi\u0107's decision to omit him from that position. Although already an international for Switzerland, FIFA rules would permit Shaqiri to represent Kosovo, who joined the federation earlier that year.[96][97] However, since Shaqiri continued to play for Switzerland after Kosovo had become a member of FIFA, it also ruled out the possibility of Shaqiri's eligibility to Kosovo.[96]\n\n\n\n#### 2018 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShaqiri's first goal of the 2020\u201321 season, and first goal for the club in over nine months, came on 24 September 2020, when he scored the opening goal in a 7\u20132 routing of Lincoln City in the EFL Cup.[80]\n\n\n\n### Lyon[edit]\n\n\nOn 23 August 2021, French side Lyon announced the signing of Shaqiri, paying Liverpool a fee of \u20ac6 million and signing a contract until 2024.[81] Less than six months later, having been involved in just half of their Ligue 1 matches during the campaign and started only nine times, it was reported that he could return to Switzerland and join FC Sion. Sion's president, Christian Constantin said: \"Shaqiri, lacking playing time in Lyon, wanted to meet. In anticipation of the World Cup, he was looking for a club where he would have more playing time.\"[82]\n\n\n\n### Chicago Fire FC[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShaqiri did not score his first Bundesliga goal until the final league match of the 2012 calendar year, rescuing a point for them in a 1\u20131 draw with Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, leaving Bayern in first place at the winter break.[24][25] On 16 April 2013, Shaqiri also scored in the DFB-Pokal semi-final against VfL Wolfsburg with a long-range shot. Although he did not play in the final, Shaqiri won the 2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League title with Bayern, as well as the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal title, making him one of the Bayern Munich players to have won the first treble in club history; he added the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup to his achievements that year.[10] By June 2014, Shaqiri was reported to be the most decorated Swiss footballer of all time at just 22, with 13 medals to his name.[10]\n\n\n\n### Inter Milan[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 2014, Shaqiri was named in Switzerland's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In the team's opening match, Shaqiri was named man of the match by FIFA as the *Nati* defeated Ecuador.[90] He earned the same title ten days later in Switzerland's third group match, for scoring a hat-trick against Honduras, which included a bending strike from 30 yards, and ensuring Switzerland a spot in the knockout stage.[91] They were eliminated following a 1\u20130 loss against Argentina in the last 16.[92]\n\n\n\n#### UEFA Euro 2016[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShaqiri began his career at FC Basel, winning honours including three Swiss Super League titles, before moving to Bayern Munich, where he gained nine domestic and continental honours despite playing less frequently. In January 2015, he moved to Inter Milan for a fee of \u20ac15 million, and seven months later to Stoke City for a club record \u00a312 million. After Stoke's relegation from the Premier League in 2018, Shaqiri was transferred to Liverpool prior to the following season for a reported \u00a313.5 million fee. He was part of the UEFA Champions League winning squad in his first season. He also won the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup in 2019, as well as the Premier League in 2020, Liverpool's first league title in 30 years.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"Xherdan Shaqiri: Inter Milan sign Bayern Munich winger\". *BBC Sport*. 10 January 2015.

In the 2008\u201309 season, he scored 16 goals in 36 league appearances to help the team back into the Eredivisie.[9] He became known as *Keizer Keisuke* (meaning *Emperor Keisuke*) among the club's fans.[10] Also, Honda introduced his agent, Tetsuro Kiyooka, to Maya Yoshida in 2008 and led him to VVV-Venlo two years later.[11]\n\n\n\n### CSKA Moscow[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 4 February 2021, Honda announced that he had reached an agreement with Primeira Liga club Portimonense.[43] The signing was officially confirmed two days later, with Honda joining the Portuguese side on a six-month deal with the option for a one-year extension.[44] The deal, however, broke down after Portmonense was unable to register him in the league, as a LPFP ruling required free agent players to be at least three months in that status in order to be registered outside of the transfer window period; Honda had spent less than two months out of contract.[45] He parted ways with the club amicably on 11 February.[46]\n\n\n\n### Neft\u00e7i[edit]\n\n\nOn 15 March 2021, Honda joined Azerbaijan Premier League club Neft\u00e7i PFK on a deal until the end of the season.[47] At the end of the season, Keisuke Honda won Azerbaijan Premier League title with Neft\u00e7i.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Honda plans to open soccer school in United States\". *The Yomiuri Shimbun*.

This secured a 2\u20131 (3\u20132 aggregate) victory to send the club to the quarterfinals, making Honda the first Japanese player to be in the quarter-finals as well as the first to score in the knock-out stages. Honda scored his first league goal on 12 March 2010, in the home match against Amkar Perm. He scored the goal in the third minute of injury time, slotting home a pass from Necid with his left. With the goal, he secured the win for CSKA Moscow.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJonathan Wilson of The Guardian cited him as a 'false nine': a player superficially employed as a centre forward but moving deeper to pull the opposition defence around the pitch.[57]\n\n\n\n### 2011 AFC Asian Cup[edit]\n\n\nHonda was included in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup by coach Alberto Zaccheroni.

As an infant, he was unusually active, and on recommendation of a doctor was signed up for football at age three. He also helped his parents with their work at a local coal yard along with his two sisters, Vanesa and Evelyn. Due to the low income his family earned, purchasing football boots and keeping up with Di Mar\u00eda's hobby was difficult for his parents. He considers himself to be a \"family man\" and has used a significant amount of his salary to \"give back\" to his family.[12] After being transferred to Benfica, he asked his father not to work any more and purchased a house for his parents and sisters.[13]\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Rosario Central[edit]\n\n\nAt age four, Di Mar\u00eda joined Rosario Central.

In 2010, Di Mar\u00eda moved to Spanish club Real Madrid in a transfer worth \u20ac25\u00a0million, where he won a 2011\u201312 La Liga title and the 2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League.
