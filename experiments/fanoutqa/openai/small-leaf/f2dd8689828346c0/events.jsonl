Since then, only 25 players have scored more at all the games played at the World Cup than Stábile did throughout the 1930 tournament. The first was Hungary's Sándor Kocsis with eleven in 1954. At the next tournament, France's Just Fontaine improved on this record with 13 goals in only six games. Gerd Müller scored 10 for West Germany in 1970 and broke the overall record when he scored his 14th goal in a tournament match at a World Cup during West Germany's win in the 1974 final. His record stood for more than three decades until Ronaldo's 15 goals between 1998 and 2006 for Brazil. Germany's Miroslav Klose went on to score a record 16 goals across four consecutive tournaments between 2002 and 2014.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Valentin Ivanov | ![](image) Soviet Union | 9\n | 0.56\n | 1958, 1962\n | list[93] |\n| Emilio Butragueño | ![](image) Spain | 9\n | 0.56\n | 1986, (1990)\n | list[94] |\n| Roger Milla♦ | ![](image) Cameroon | 9\n | 0.56\n | (1982), 1990, 1994\n | [95] |\n| Tim Cahill♦ | ![](image) Australia | 9\n | 0.56\n | 2006, 2010, 2014, (2018)\n | list[96][97] |\n| Hans Krankl | ![](image) Austria | 10\n | 0.50\n | 1978, 1982\n | list[98] |\n| Raúl | ![](image) Spain | 11\n | 0.45\n | 1998, 2002, 2006\n | list[99] |\n| Garrincha | ![](image) Brazil | 12\n | 0.42\n | (1958†), 1962†, 1966\n | [100] |\n| Johan Neeskens | ![](image) Netherlands | 12\n | 0.42\n | 1974, (1978)\n | [101] |\n| Fernando Hierro | ![](image) Spain | 12\n | 0.42\n | [1990], 1994, 1998, 2002\n | list[102] |\n| Zinedine Zidane | ![](image) France | 12\n | 0.42\n | 1998†, (2002), 2006\n | [103] |\n| Landon Donovan♦ | ![](image) United States | 12\n | 0.42\n | 2002, (2006), 2010\n | list[104] |\n| Romelu Lukaku♦# | ![](image) Belgium | 12\n | 0.42\n | 2014, 2018, (2022)\n | list[105] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n90. **^** \"Romário (Romário de Souza Faria)\".

In the 2008–09 season, he scored 16 goals in 36 league appearances to help the team back into the Eredivisie.[9] He became known as *Keizer Keisuke* (meaning *Emperor Keisuke*) among the club's fans.[10] Also, Honda introduced his agent, Tetsuro Kiyooka, to Maya Yoshida in 2008 and led him to VVV-Venlo two years later.[11]\n\n\n\n### CSKA Moscow[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 4 February 2021, Honda announced that he had reached an agreement with Primeira Liga club Portimonense.[43] The signing was officially confirmed two days later, with Honda joining the Portuguese side on a six-month deal with the option for a one-year extension.[44] The deal, however, broke down after Portmonense was unable to register him in the league, as a LPFP ruling required free agent players to be at least three months in that status in order to be registered outside of the transfer window period; Honda had spent less than two months out of contract.[45] He parted ways with the club amicably on 11 February.[46]\n\n\n\n### Neftçi[edit]\n\n\nOn 15 March 2021, Honda joined Azerbaijan Premier League club Neftçi PFK on a deal until the end of the season.[47] At the end of the season, Keisuke Honda won Azerbaijan Premier League title with Neftçi.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Honda plans to open soccer school in United States\". *The Yomiuri Shimbun*.

Honda scored his first league goal on 12 March 2010, in the home match against Amkar Perm. He scored the goal in the third minute of injury time, slotting home a pass from Necid with his left. With the goal, he secured the win for CSKA Moscow.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJonathan Wilson of The Guardian cited him as a 'false nine': a player superficially employed as a centre forward but moving deeper to pull the opposition defence around the pitch.[57]\n\n\n\n### 2011 AFC Asian Cup[edit]\n\n\nHonda was included in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup by coach Alberto Zaccheroni.

He was named in the Team of the Tournament.[106]\n\n\n\n#### UEFA Euro 2020[edit]\n\n\nSee also: UEFA Euro 2020\n\nShaqiri was named in the 26-man Swiss squad for the postponed UEFA Euro 2020.[107] On 20 June 2021, he scored twice in the 26th and 68th minutes against Turkey in a group stage match.[108] On 2 July 2021, he scored in the quarter final of the tournament against Spain.[109] The match ended 1–1 and went to a penalty shoot-out, in which Spain progressed to the semi-finals.[110]\n\n\n\n#### 2022 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\nOn 15 November 2021, Shaqiri became only the fifth Swiss player to reach 100 caps when he started Switzerland's final 2022 World Cup qualifier against Bulgaria.[111]\n\n\n\n## Style of play[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlso capable of playing as an attacking midfielder, a 2011 scouting profile by Jamie Sanderson of *The Independent* described Shaqiri with the following words: \"Diminutive, agile and pacy across the turf, Shaqiri boasts excellent technique and balance. He's left footed, but comfortable and equally effective on either wing or as a classic play-maker, boasting good vision and almost zero back lift in his passing and shooting.\" He also added that Shaqiri's \"tricks,\" \"direct running style,\" and \"composure,\" made him \"a player who's dangerous in almost any attacking area.\" However, while he acknowledged the young winger's promising talent and potential to become a top player, he also noted that he had a poor work rate and lacked maturity.[115]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShaqiri primarily plays as a right winger and FIFA's official website describes him as \"unpredictable on the ball, adept with both feet, clinical in front of goal and possessing excellent vision.\"[112] He was described in *The Daily Telegraph* as \"stocky and powerful\" with a \"wand of a left foot\".[113] He is nicknamed \"the Alpine Messi\"[6] and \"the magic dwarf\".[114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShaqiri scored his first goal for Liverpool on 27 October, scoring the third goal in a 4–1 win over Cardiff City.[67] In November, he was left out of the club's Champions League trip to Red Star Belgrade in Serbia to avoid controversy over his pro-Albanian views.[68] The following month, during the North West derby, Shaqiri scored twice after coming on as a substitute to guide Liverpool to a 3–1 win which saw the club record a league victory over Manchester United for the first time since March 2014.[69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShaqiri was promoted to the Switzerland senior team in 2010, making his debut on 3 March 2010 in a 3–1 friendly loss against Uruguay. He was included in the 2010 World Cup squad, after receiving a surprise call-up from manager Ottmar Hitzfeld. Shaqiri scored his first goal for them on 7 September 2010, a long range left-footed shot, in a 1–3 loss against England in a Euro 2012 qualifier. He netted a hat-trick in another Euro 2012 qualifier on 6 September 2011, as Switzerland came from behind to beat Bulgaria 3–1.[87] Switzerland also tried to select him to participate in the 2012 Olympic Football tournament, but he opted to stay at his new club for pre-season training.[88]\n\n\n\n#### 2014 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\nOn 11 September 2012, Shaqiri did not sing the Swiss national anthem in a World Cup qualifier against his ancestral Albania in Lucerne, and did not celebrate when he scored the opening goal of a 2–0 win. He wore boots with the flags of Kosovo, Albania and Switzerland for the match.[89]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShaqiri transferred to Italian club Inter Milan on 9 January 2015 for €15 million,[26] signing a four-and-a-half-year contract,[27] though English club Stoke City had previously declared an interest in signing him.[28] With his previous number of 23 being taken by Andrea Ranocchia, Shaqiri chose the number 91 for his Inter shirt, representing his birth year.[29] He was an unused substitute in Inter's 3–1 victory over Genoa at San Siro.[30] He made his debut for Inter on 17 January, playing in the last 16 minutes as a substitute for fellow new signing Lukas Podolski.[31] Shaqiri made his Coppa Italia debut in a match against Sampdoria in the round of 16 on 22 January, scoring the first goal of the match and helping the team to a 2–0 win to progress into the quarter-finals.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing Switzerland's first game at Euro 2016, Shaqiri declared he would switch allegiance to Kosovo if their manager would make him captain, in reaction to Switzerland manager Vladimir Petković's decision to omit him from that position. Although already an international for Switzerland, FIFA rules would permit Shaqiri to represent Kosovo, who joined the federation earlier that year.[96][97] However, since Shaqiri continued to play for Switzerland after Kosovo had become a member of FIFA, it also ruled out the possibility of Shaqiri's eligibility to Kosovo.[96]\n\n\n\n#### 2018 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShaqiri's first goal of the 2020–21 season, and first goal for the club in over nine months, came on 24 September 2020, when he scored the opening goal in a 7–2 routing of Lincoln City in the EFL Cup.[80]\n\n\n\n### Lyon[edit]\n\n\nOn 23 August 2021, French side Lyon announced the signing of Shaqiri, paying Liverpool a fee of €6 million and signing a contract until 2024.[81] Less than six months later, having been involved in just half of their Ligue 1 matches during the campaign and started only nine times, it was reported that he could return to Switzerland and join FC Sion. Sion's president, Christian Constantin said: \"Shaqiri, lacking playing time in Lyon, wanted to meet. In anticipation of the World Cup, he was looking for a club where he would have more playing time.\"[82]\n\n\n\n### Chicago Fire FC[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShaqiri did not score his first Bundesliga goal until the final league match of the 2012 calendar year, rescuing a point for them in a 1–1 draw with Borussia Mönchengladbach, leaving Bayern in first place at the winter break.[24][25] On 16 April 2013, Shaqiri also scored in the DFB-Pokal semi-final against VfL Wolfsburg with a long-range shot. Although he did not play in the final, Shaqiri won the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League title with Bayern, as well as the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal title, making him one of the Bayern Munich players to have won the first treble in club history; he added the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup to his achievements that year.[10] By June 2014, Shaqiri was reported to be the most decorated Swiss footballer of all time at just 22, with 13 medals to his name.[10]\n\n\n\n### Inter Milan[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 2014, Shaqiri was named in Switzerland's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In the team's opening match, Shaqiri was named man of the match by FIFA as the *Nati* defeated Ecuador.[90] He earned the same title ten days later in Switzerland's third group match, for scoring a hat-trick against Honduras, which included a bending strike from 30 yards, and ensuring Switzerland a spot in the knockout stage.[91] They were eliminated following a 1–0 loss against Argentina in the last 16.[92]\n\n\n\n#### UEFA Euro 2016[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShaqiri began his career at FC Basel, winning honours including three Swiss Super League titles, before moving to Bayern Munich, where he gained nine domestic and continental honours despite playing less frequently. In January 2015, he moved to Inter Milan for a fee of €15 million, and seven months later to Stoke City for a club record £12 million. After Stoke's relegation from the Premier League in 2018, Shaqiri was transferred to Liverpool prior to the following season for a reported £13.5 million fee. He was part of the UEFA Champions League winning squad in his first season. He also won the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup in 2019, as well as the Premier League in 2020, Liverpool's first league title in 30 years.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"Xherdan Shaqiri: Inter Milan sign Bayern Munich winger\". *BBC Sport*. 10 January 2015.

He considers himself to be a \"family man\" and has used a significant amount of his salary to \"give back\" to his family.[12] After being transferred to Benfica, he asked his father not to work any more and purchased a house for his parents and sisters.[13]\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Rosario Central[edit]\n\n\nAt age four, Di María joined Rosario Central. As he had already committed to playing for his local club, Torito, 35 footballs were given in compensation.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Ángel Fabián Di María** (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈaŋxel faˈβjan di maˈɾia]; born 14 February 1988) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a right winger or attacking midfielder for Primeira Liga club Benfica and the Argentina national team.

He helped Benfica win the Primeira Liga, the club's first league title in five years, and two Taça da Liga titles. In 2010, Di María moved to Spanish club Real Madrid in a transfer worth €25 million, where he won a 2011–12 La Liga title and the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League. He subsequently signed for Manchester United in 2014 in a then-British record deal worth £59.7 million (€75.6 million), but left a year later to join Paris Saint-Germain. During his time in England, Di María was selected in the FIFPRO Men's World 11 in 2014.[11] In France, Di María won five league titles, five Coupe de France and four Coupe de la Ligue, which includes three domestic quadruples, and helped the club reach its first Champions League final in 2020.

On 22 October, in the Europa League group stage match against Everton, he provided an hat-trick of assist for the first time in his career, in a 5–0 thrashing at the Estádio da Luz, marking the biggest loss of an English side in a European competition.[21][22] During that month, Di María signed a new deal with Benfica, adding three more years to his current deal, which was to last until 30 June 2015 with his release fee set at a minimum of €40  million.[23] Afterwards, he was backed by Diego Maradona to become \"Argentina's next superstar\".[24] He would score a brace in Benfica's 2–1 home win over AEK Athens, to ensure Benfica's qualification to the round of thirty-two, as group winners.[25] On 27 February 2010, Di María scored his first hat-trick in a classic 4–0 win against Leixões. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDi María is a quick, strong, tricky and talented winger who is also capable of playing as a more central attacking midfielder or on either side of the pitch, although he is predominantly a left-footed player.[152] He has also been deployed to great effect as a central midfielder, in particular under Carlo Ancelotti's tenure with Real Madrid.[45] Possessing a slender frame,[153] Di María is an agile, creative and highly technical player who possesses excellent dribbling skills and ball control, as well as great pace, stamina, movement, and acceleration, attributes which allow him to beat players easily in one-on-one situations. He is also gifted with excellent vision, set-piece delivery, passing, and crossing ability, which allow him to function effectively as a playmaker and as an assist provider, although he is also capable of scoring goals himself, and is an accurate free kick taker. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Di María playing for Benfica in 2007\nDi María was transferred to the Portuguese side Benfica in July 2007, where he played as a winger. He was signed as a replacement for Benfica's departing captain, Simão, who joined Atlético Madrid earlier that summer.[16] Benfica paid Rosario Central €6  million for 80% of his sports rights and 50% of sports rights of Andrés Díaz.[18] Later, in August 2008, the Portuguese club paid an extra €2  million for the remaining 20%,[19] but re-sold 10% to GestiFute.[20] Di María was signed by the Portuguese club with the intention of replacing Simão Sabrosa, who had just left the club to play for Atlético de Madrid.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring a match between PSG and Nantes on 14 March 2021, Di María's home was robbed and his family was held hostage.

He used a company in Panama to exploit his image rights for months before arriving at Real Madrid. He is the owner of a company in Panama created especially to manage his million-dollar contracts for the exploitation of his image rights, a shell company that he used since 2009 and that he maintains to this day while playing at Paris Saint-Germain with Lionel Messi.

The deal reportedly increased Neymar's wages by 50%, to the levels that top European clubs would be paying him.[45] On 14 December 2011, Neymar scored the opening goal for Santos as they defeated Kashiwa Reysol 3–1 in the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup at the Toyota Stadium in Toyota, Japan, but failed to score against Barcelona in the final on 18 December 2011, where Santos were defeated 4–0, finishing as runners-up in the competition.[46] He won the 2011 FIFA Puskás Award for scoring a solo goal in the Brasileirão Série A against Flamengo, in a 5–4 loss. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNeymar began playing football at an early age and he was soon spotted by Santos who offered him a contract in 2003, where he was inducted into their youth academy, which has, in the past, produced Brazilian internationals like Coutinho, Clodoaldo, Diego, Elano and Alex. He also joined the likes of Pepe, Pelé and Robinho in starting out his career at the club, nicknamed *Peixe*.[20] While in the youth academy, Neymar met Paulo Henrique Ganso, becoming good friends in the process. Aged 14, Neymar travelled to Spain for try outs with the Real Madrid youth team, at the time when Real had stars like Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Roberto Carlos and Robinho. He did not stay in Madrid, however, as his father decided at the time that he preferred the young prodigy to keep growing up while playing at Santos.[21][22]\n\n\n\n#### 2009: Debut season[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Neymar (right) with Kylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi against Marseille during Le Classique, October 2021\nOn 10 August 2021, Neymar's former Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi signed for PSG.[186] On 29 August, Neymar made his first appearance of the season, being a starter in a 2–0 win over Reims. Messi replaced Neymar at 66th minute of the match, making his debut for the French club.[187] Neymar scored his first goal of the 2021–22 season on 19 September, converting a penalty in a 2–1 win over Lyon.[188] He scored his 400th career goal on 6 November against Bordeaux, where he scored a brace and helped the team to win the match 3–2.[189]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n423. **^** \"DAZN to premiere Neymar Jr And The Line Of Kings\". *Broadcastnow.co.uk*.

He scored on his debut after 28 minutes, a header coming from an André Santos cross in a 2–0 win for Brazil.[222] On 1 March 2011, Neymar said: \"Being on the Brazilian team is a privilege, There are some marvelous players and I'm very happy to be among them.\"[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNeymar came into prominence at Santos, where he made his professional debut aged 17. Soon becoming the Brazilian league's star player, he won the 2011 Copa Libertadores with Santos, being their first since 1963. He was named the South American Footballer of the Year in 2011 and 2012, and relocated to Europe to join Barcelona in 2013. In his second season, as part of Barcelona's attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, dubbed *MSN*, he won the continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNeymar made his first appearance for PSG in the 2019–20 season on 14 September, in a 1–0 victory over Strasbourg in Ligue 1.

At 25-years old, Neymar was motivated to leave Barcelona to step out of Messi's shadow and be the sole star player, increasing the likelihood of him winning the Ballon d'Or.[122] Barcelona president, Bartomeu, admitted he was powerless to stop him from wanting to leave: “Neymar is one of our best players and so we don’t want to lose that player,” he said. “We want him to continue with us. He still has four years of his contract so there is nothing else to say [...] You know that players decide if they want to leave, they can decide.\"[123] On 2 August 2017, Neymar asked Barcelona to allow him to leave.[124]\n\n\n\n### Paris Saint-Germain[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 15 September, he made his debut in a 6–1 thrashing of Al-Riyadh, coming off the bench and providing an assist to a goal by Malcom.[213] On 3 October, Neymar scored his first goal for the club in a 3–0 away win against Nassaji Mazandaran in an AFC Champions League group stage match.[214] Having played five games for his new club, Neymar ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament while on international duty in October 2023.[215]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\n### 2010–2012: Senior debut and first major tournaments[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n314. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Francesco Letizia (17 March 2009). \"Neymar, la clonazione è permessa\". *Tutto Mercato* (in Italian).
