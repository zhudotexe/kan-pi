Butler's parents currently live on Mount Desert Island, Maine.[9] Butler's maternal grandfather was jazz steel guitarist Alvino Rey, a pioneer bandleader whose career spanned eight decades.[10] His maternal grandmother, Luise, was a member of The King Sisters, who starred in a weekly variety program on ABC called *The King Family Show*.\n\n\nAt the age of 15, Butler started attending the Phillips Exeter Academy preparatory school in New Hampshire, where he lived in Abbot Hall.[11] After graduation, he studied photography and creative writing at Sarah Lawrence College, but left after a year.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nButler moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 2000 to attend McGill University, where he met his future wife, R\u00e9gine Chassagne,[12] whom he married in 2003.[13] Butler graduated from McGill in 2004 with a bachelor's degree in religious studies.[14][15]\n\n\nButler participated in the 2005 UNICEF benefit project, \"Do They Know It's Hallowe'en?,\" along with Chassagne. The two also collaborated on the music for the Richard Kelly film *The Box*.[16]\n\n\nOn April 2, 2011, LCD Soundsystem played its last concert before its disbandment. Arcade Fire performed with them during the song \"North American Scum.\" During James Murphy's stumbling introduction to the song, Butler shouted out \"shut up and play the hits!\" Murphy immediately responded, \"ladies and gentlemen, for our live record entitled 'Shut Up and Play the Hits'\" and Butler's cry later became the title of the documentary of the concert.[17]\nIn September 2011, Butler played in a charity basketball tournament in Toronto, Ontario, known as \"Rock The Court.\" Several other celebrities and athletes participated, such as Matt Bonner of the San Antonio Spurs.[18]\n\n\nButler also works as a DJ using the stage name Windows 98. Sometimes he works under this moniker as the opening act for Arcade Fire itself.[1][19]\n\n\nIn March 2015, Butler and Chassagne attended the launch of music streaming service Tidal, and revealed themselves, along with other notable artists, as shareholders in the company.[20]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nButler is married to fellow Arcade Fire member R\u00e9gine Chassagne, who gave birth to the couple's only child, a son, in 2013.[21]\n\n\nButler was naturalized as a Canadian citizen on July 9, 2019, in a ceremony held in Montreal and hosted by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada minister Ahmed Hussen.[22]\n\n\nButler is a frequent participant in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game, and won the game's Most Valuable Player award in 2016.[23]\n\n\n\n### Sexual misconduct allegations[edit]\n\n\nAccording to a *Pitchfork* article published on August 27, 2022, four individuals have accused Butler of sexual misconduct, with some saying he initially contacted them on social media.[24] Butler said all contact with the accusers was consensual, and he denies all allegations of misconduct. In a statement to Pitchfork, a representative for Butler acknowledged he had sexual interactions with each of them, but said they were not initiated by him and were consensual. Chassagne corroborated his statements.[25]\n\n\nOn November 22, 2022, *Pitchfork* published a follow-up article detailing Butler's manipulative interactions towards a fifth person. These interactions were described by the individual as \"Emotionally abusive, manipulative, toxic, and using his power dynamic to exploit my body at times that were convenient for him.\"[26]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Yoshida, Emily (March 19, 2015). \"Arcade Fire's Win Butler is DJing at SXSW under the name DJ Windows 98, and this is what that's like\". *The Verge*.

She is married to co-founder Win Butler.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nR\u00e9gine Alexandra Chassagne was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and grew up in St-Lambert, a suburb south of Montreal.[2][3] Her parents, who were Haitians of mixed French and African descent, moved from Haiti during the dictatorship of Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier, which is alluded to in the Arcade Fire song \"Ha\u00efti\", in which she sings, **Mes cousins jamais n\u00e9s hantent les nuits de Duvalier** (\"My unborn cousins haunt Duvalier's nights\").[4] The line is in reference to the relatives who were killed during the J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Vespers massacre.\n\n\nChassagne attended *Coll\u00e8ge Jean-de-Br\u00e9beuf* before earning a B.A. in communication studies at Concordia University[5] in 1998,[6] and went on to study jazz voice briefly at McGill University.[7] She was singing jazz at an art opening at Concordia in 2000, when Win Butler met her and persuaded her to join his band. They married in 2003. Ten years later, their son was born on 21 April 2013.[8][9]\n\n\nChassagne has also been involved with a medieval-themed band called *Les Jongleurs de la Mandragore*[10] and with Jimmy Rouleau in the jazz duo Az\u00facar.[11] She also wrote the music for the two-minute David Uloth short film \"The Shine\", and she contributed to the UNICEF benefit project as part of the North American Hallowe'en Prevention Initiative, performing the song \"Do They Know It's Hallowe'en?\" along with Win Butler.\n\n\nShe plays many instruments on stage, including accordion, drums, xylophone, hurdy-gurdy, keyboards, organ and guitar. In Arcade Fire, Chassagne performs lead vocals on some songs, including \"Haiti\", \"In the Backseat\", \"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations\", \"Empty Room\", \"Abraham's Daughter\", \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\", \"Creature Comfort\", \"Electric Blue\", and \"Unconditional II (Race and Religion)\".\n\n\nIn March 2015, Chassagne, along with Win Butler, attended the launch of music streaming service Tidal, and revealed themselves, along with other notable artists, as shareholders in the company.[12]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nChassagne has been married to fellow Arcade Fire member Win Butler since 2003. They had a son in April 2013.[13]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Hoard, Christian (10 March 2005). \"The Fire This Time\". *Rolling Stone*. No.\u00a0969. pp.\u00a059\u201360.

His late father was David Parry of the folk band Friends of Fiddler's Green. His mother, Caroline Balderston Parry, was a poet and musician, and his sister, Evalyn Parry, is a theatre artist, songwriter, and spoken word performer.[2][3] Parry's family is Quaker and Parry grew up attending Toronto Monthly Meeting.[4][5]\n\n\nParry attended Canterbury High School in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and was one of a dozen members of the Literary Arts program (first generation). His classmates include *Stargate: Atlantis* writer Martin Gero and *The Holmes Show* comedian Kurt Smeaton.\n\n\nIn the mid 1990s, he worked summers at a vegetarian camp in near Chelsea, Quebec, called *Camp Au Grand Bois*.\n\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, he studied electroacoustics and contemporary dance at Concordia University in Montreal.\n\n\nThe Bell Orchestre was formed in 2005, along with Sarah Neufeld, Tim Kingsbury as well as Stefan Schneider and French horn player Pietro Amato. Parry primarily plays double bass and is the de facto producer.[6][7] Bell Orchestre released *As Seen Through Windows* with Arts & Crafts Records on March 10, 2009.[8] It was recorded with John Mcentire in Soma Electric Studios in Chicago, Illinois. The album since won a 2011 Juno Award for best instrumental album.\n\n\nA long-time core member of Arcade Fire, he co-produced and collaborated on the debut EP, *Arcade Fire*, before the first lineup of the band fell apart. Helping to reform and recreate the band, Parry brought in Bell Orchestre bandmate Sarah Neufeld, and New International Standards bandmates, Tim Kingsbury and Jeremy Gara.\n\n\nHe has also made musical contributions to albums by The National, Little Scream, Sufjan Stevens, The Unicorns and Islands. On the latter's critically acclaimed 2006 album Return to the Sea, he played several instruments, sang background vocals and arranged strings, and appeared with the band's 2016 10-year-anniversary shows where they played the album in full.\nParry has also performed in a cover band called Phi Slamma Jamma along with Arcade Fire bandmates Will Butler, Jeremy Gara, and Tim Kingsbury. The group performed at the 2011 POP Montreal Festival as well as the 2012 Crossing Brooklyn Ferry Festival.\n\n\nOn January 20, 2007, Parry returned to Canterbury High to perform a concert with Arcade Fire in the school's cafeteria. Only 400 students and staff were permitted to attend the show. Beforehand, those chosen had the opportunity to preview new, unreleased songs from the Arcade Fire's upcoming album. After the show, there was a brief autograph period and the students met with the band members.[9]\n\n\nHe was also formerly a member of the band the New International Standards, with Tim Kingsbury and Jeremy Gara.[5] His first work for Orchestra, entitled *For Heart, Breath and Orchestra.* It was recorded by the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony, on their 2011 album *From Here on Out* alongside pieces by Jonny Greenwood and Nico Muhly. He has also written commissioned works for Kronos Quartet, yMusic and Bryce Dessner, and his chamber works also have been performed by the Calder Quartet and Warhol Dervish.\nParry appeared at each night of the 2012 All Tomorrow's Parties festival, mounting a \"moving surround sound sci-fi composition for bicycles and boomboxes\" entitled *Drones/Revelations*, as well as performing songs with a folk trio called *Quiet River of Dust*, and as part of a chamber music ensemble performing Parry's *Music for Heart and Breath*. The lineup included Owen Pallett, Nico Muhly, Bryce Dessner, Aaron Dessner, Gaspar Claus, Nadia Sirota, Kyle Resnick, and Dave Nelson.\nHe occasionally performs as drummer and backup singer with Little Scream.[10]\n\n\nParry has also collaborated with The National, arranging vocals and writing guitar parts for their songs on their 2010 album *High Violet* and appeared with them singing and playing guitar and double bass in their Vevo live event as well as on their Late Night with David Letterman appearance in 2011. He has joined them frequently onstage as a guest during many performances, including Lollapalooza 2010 (at which Arcade Fire also performed) and also during a brief segment of Arcade Fire's 2011 midwestern US tour in which The National acted as openers. Parry has also collaborated with Bryce Dessner of The National on classical compositions, performing together at the Edinburgh Festival in 2015.[2]\n\n\nParry recently co-hosted a BBC 6 Music Takeover programme with the members of The National called Arcade Fire and the National Takeover\n[11] Parry and brothers Aaron & Bryce Dessner who play guitar in The National have been long-term friends since meeting on the American alt-rock circuit, regularly appearing on the same festival bills worldwide.\n[11] Their friendship was cemented when Richard from the Arcade Fire contributed to a number of songs on The National's album High Violet, most notably playing double bass and guitar on 'Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks', and doing the vocal harmony arrangements on 'Conversation 16' and 'Sorrow'. During this show Parry mentioned he was producing an album by a local Montreal artist named Little Scream.\n\n\nIn July 2018 Parry announced the upcoming release of two albums: *Quiet River Of Dust Vol. 1* and *Quiet River Of Dust Vol. 2*.[12] The albums are inspired by Buddhist myths, death poems, British folk songs, and a recent trip to Japan.[12]\n\n\nBetween 2019 and 2021, Richard Reed Parry produced The Sadies' 2022 album *Colder Streams* at Montr\u00e9al's Skybarn.[13] This was the last album by The Sadies to feature founding member Dallas Good, who died suddenly of natural causes on February 17, 2022, at the age of 48.[14] Shortly after, Parry announced via Instagram that he and Dallas had been working on an album on and off since 2008 with the working title The Watchtower. Unfinished at the time of Dallas Good's death, Parry plans to finish the album.[15]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### Solo works[edit]\n\n\n* *Master Mix: Red Hot + Arthur Russell* (2 tracks on compilation LP), (Yep Roc, 2012)\n* *From Here on Out* Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony, (LP, Analekta, 2012)\n* *Spirit of Talk Talk*, (track on compilation LP, Fierce Panda, 2012)\n* *Have Not Been the Same*, (track on compilation LP, Zunior, 2012)\n* *Music For Heart and Breath* Kronos Quartet, yMusic, Bryce and Aaron Dessner, Nadia Sirota, (LP, Deutsche Grammophon, 2014)\n* *Quiet River of Dust* (LP, Secret City Records, 2018)\n* *Quiet River of Dust Vol. 2: That Side of the River* (LP, ANTI-/Secret City Records, 2019)[16]\n* *The Nest* (soundtrack LP, 2020)[17]\n\n\n### Arcade Fire[edit]\n\n\n* *Arcade Fire* (EP, Merge, 2003)\n* *Funeral* (LP, Merge, 2004)\n* *Neon Bible* (LP, Merge, 2007)\n* *The Suburbs* (LP, Merge, 2010)\n* *Reflektor* (LP, Merge, 2013)\n* *Everything Now* (LP, Sonovox, 2017)\n* *We* (LP, Sonovox, 2022)\n\n\n### Bell Orchestre[edit]\n\n\n* *Bell Orchestre*, (demo, 2002)\n* *Recording a Tape the Colour of the Light*, (album, 2005)\n* *As Seen Through Windows*, (LP, released on March 10, 2009)\n* *Who Designs Nature's How*, (EP, released on August 25, 2009)\n\n\n### Little Scream[edit]\n\n\n* *The Golden Record*, (LP, Secretly Canadian, 2011)\n\n\n### The National[edit]\n\n\n* *Trouble Will Find Me*, (LP, 4AD, 2013)\n* *High Violet*, (LP, 4AD, 2010)\n\n\n### Barr Brothers[edit]\n\n\n* *Sleeping Operator*, (LP, Secret City Records, 2014)\n\n\n### Islands[edit]\n\n\n* *Return to the Sea*, (LP, Rough Trade, 2007)\n\n\n### The Unicorns[edit]\n\n\n* *Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?*, (LP, Rough Trade, 2004)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Jeremy Gara and Richard Reed Parry of Arcade Fire.

He plays synthesizer, bass, guitar and percussion. He is known for his spontaneity and antics during performances. He is the younger brother of Arcade Fire frontman Win Butler. In 2014, Will Butler was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score for his work on the original score of the 2013 film *Her*.\n\n\n\n\n## Life and career[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Truckee, California, United States,[1] and raised in The Woodlands, Texas, Will is the son of Liza Rey, a classical musician, and Edwin Farnham Butler II, a geologist.[2] His maternal grandfather was guitarist Alvino Rey. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 2001, where he lived in Abbot Hall, and subsequently attended Northwestern University, majoring in Poetry and Slavic studies.[3] During this time, he worked as a DJ for the WNUR Rock Show, where he also hired Nathan Amundson of Rivulets to be a substitute DJ at WNUR-FM. He also served as the poetry editor of Northwestern's literary magazine, Helicon. An excerpt of a poem from his senior thesis is quoted in Brian Bouldrey's book, \"Honorable Bandit: A Walk Across Corsica.\" While at Northwestern, Butler lived in Chicago, Illinois. He moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada in the mid-2000s to join his brother Win Butler and band Arcade Fire.\n\n\nIn January 2008 Butler married dancer Jenny Shore.[4]\n\n\nIn January 2014, Butler and Owen Pallett were nominated for Best Original Score at the 86th Academy Awards for their original score of *Her*.\n\n\nButler was a student at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government where he pursued a Mid-Career Master in Public Administration.[5][6]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Butler announced he had left Arcade Fire at the end of the previous year, stating \"there was no acute reason beyond that I've changed\u2014and the band has changed\u2014over the last almost 20 years. Time for new things.\"[7] The band's album *We*, released on May 6, 2022, was Butler's last performance with Arcade Fire on a studio album.[8]\n\n\nButler is now part of Will Butler + Sister Squares.[9]\n\n\n\n## Solo career[edit]\n\n\nOn March 3, 2015, Butler's debut solo album *Policy* was released under Merge Records, accompanied by an international tour alongside Arcade Fire drummer Jeremy Gara. According to Butler, *Policy* is intended to reflect his omnivorous musical taste.[10]\n\n\nButler wrote five songs for *The Guardian*, based on news headlines, with each song created and shared a day apart. They were mixed properly and released on *Policy Deluxe* in May 2015.\n\n\nButler's song \"Sun Comes Up\" from the 2016 solo album *Friday Night* caught the ear of DJ B-Roc of The Knocks, and subsequently the Knocks-produced remix of the song was released alongside a video directed by Butler, filmed in part on the New York City subway system.[11]\n\n\nButler wrote original songs for David Adjmi's play *Stereophonic*, which was originally scheduled to premier in 2021, but due to the coronavirus was pushed back until October 2023.[12]\n\n\n\n## Solo discography[edit]\n\n\n### Studio albums[edit]\n\n\n* *Policy* (Merge Records, 2015)\n* *Friday Night* (Merge Records, 2016)\n* *Generations* (Merge Records, 2020)\n* *Will Butler + Sister Squares* (Merge Records, 2023)\n\n\n### Singles[edit]\n\n\n* \"Anna\" (2015)\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\n* \"What I Want\" (2015)\n* \"Anna\" (2015)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hear Two New Arcade Fire Songs and an Interview\". *Npr.org*.

He plays bass guitar, guitar, and occasionally keyboards.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nKingsbury spent his early years living in and around Guelph, Ontario.[1] He comes from a musical family; his mother Birdie was a pianist and a music director and Parkwood Gardens Community church in Guelph, and Kingsbury sang in the church choir.[2] His brother Brett is a professional classical pianist. After piano lessons as a child, Kingsbury stopped playing music until a friend of his mother gave him a guitar when he was fourteen. He began to teach himself to play and write music.[3] Kingsbury attended John F. Ross in Guelph[4] where he began playing in bands when he was sixteen.[3] Christian rock was an early influence for Kingsbury,[2] especially the music of pioneering American Christian rock artist Larry Norman.[3] Kingsbury cites his later influences as Pavement and Palace and Dinosaur Jr.[3] He played with Gentleman Reg while in high school, only playing one show outside of Guelph.[5]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nAfter high school, Kingsbury moved to Ottawa where he played with a number of bands such as the Killers and Geoffrey Pye, before joining Clark the band. While in Ottawa he met Jeremy Gara. The two played together in a band in Ottawa and would later move to Montreal and play together in The New International Standards, Arcade Fire and Kingsbury's solo project, Sam Patch.[6]\n\n\nKingsbury moved to Montreal in 2001.[7] Kingsbury had a hard time finding full-time work with a band and made ends meet by working as a telemarketer for a pharmaceutical company.[4] At the same time, he played in a number of bands, including the New International Standards.[5] The New International Standards included Richard Reed Parry, Annesley Black and Mike Feuerstack. The band was active for about two years. It was Parry that brought Kingsbury into Arcade Fire.[5]\n\n\n\n### Arcade Fire[edit]\n\n\nKingsbury began to play with Arcade Fire in 2003 after the break-up of the band's original membership.[8] Although Kingsbury primarily plays bass in Arcade Fire, he also plays guitar and sings.[7]\n\n\nGuelph continues to be a contact for Kingsbury and the fellow members of Arcade Fire. Arcade Fire performed at Guelph\u2019s Hillside Festival in 2005, a performance Sam Baijal, artistic director of Hillside, credits with giving the Festival a huge boost in popularity.[4]\n\n\n\n### Other projects[edit]\n\n\nKingsbury also toured and recorded with Montreal band Wolf Parade as a bassist, appearing on the album the 2005 album *Apologies to the Queen Mary*.[9] He has also been involved with the bands Clark and The New International Standards in addition to recording as a solo artist.[10]\n\n\n\n### Sam Patch[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2015 he launched a side project under the name \"Sam Patch\" along with fellow Arcade Fire member Jeremy Gara and Toronto artist Basia Bulat.[11] He played his first show as Sam Patch at Montreal's *Bar Le Ritz*.[12] Kingsbury began writing music while on tour with Arcade Fire and recorded the album *Yeah You, and I* post-tour, with Gara, Bulat. John McEntire of the bands Sea and Cake, and Tortoise and fellow Tortoise member Doug McCombs also appear.[13] Kingsbury named the project after an early 19th-century daredevil by the same name. Sam Patch, also known as the Jersey Jumper, would jump from bridges, buildings and other heights, including the Niagara River at the base of the Falls. Patch met his death in 1829 attempting a stunt at Rochester's High Falls.[6]\n\n\nKingsbury recorded the song \"In to Trouble\" for the film 2020 film *Pieces of a Woman*, and in 2021 released the song as a digital single.[14]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Record, The. \"'To us, he'll always just be Tim'\". *www.therecord.com*.

Gara is an active performer in a number of other projects, including work as a solo performer.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nGara currently (2020) is a member of the indie rock band Arcade Fire.[3] He has played in many other bands in the past, including slowcore band Kepler and math rock band Weights and Measures and well as a frequent collaborator with Michael Feuerstack.[4] He also had a part in the eponymously-titled album *Arizona Amp and Alternator*, a project of musician Howe Gelb.[5] He is endorsed by Istanbul Agop Cymbals and C&C Custom Drum Company. He has also been involved in the bands Clark, Snailhouse (with fellow Arcade Fire member Sarah Neufeld) and The New International Standards (with Arcade Fire members Richard Reed Parry and Tim Kingsbury). He recently played percussion on Owen Pallett's *Heartland* album (Pallett being a former member and regular contributor to Arcade Fire).[6]\n\n\nAs with other members of Arcade Fire, during live performances he often swaps instruments with other members of the band between songs, often taking on the role of an extra guitarist on certain songs.\n\n\nOn 14 January 2016, Jeremy Gara announced he would release debut solo record 'Limn' on 11 March 2016 sharing the video for album track 'Divinity'.[2] The album is a primarily composed of improvisation and is accompanied by artwork created by Gara.[2] Reviewers have noted it fits in with the Montreal electronic scene and potentially has little crossover appeal.[4]\n\n\nGara has also occasionally filled in on drums on the television program Late Night with Seth Meyers.[7]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nKepler\n* 2000: *Fuck Fight Fail* (Troubleman Unlimited)\n* 2002: *Missionless Days* (Resonant Records)\n* 2005: *Attic Salt* (Troubleman Unlimited)[8]\n\n\nArcade Fire\n* 2007: *Neon Bible* (Merge Records)\n* 2010: *The Suburbs* (City Slang)\n* 2013: *Reflektor* (Sonovox Records)[9]\n* 2017: *Everything Now* (Sonovox Records)\n* 2022: *We* (Sonovox Records)\n\n\nArizona Amp and Alternator\n* 2005: *Arizona Amp and Alternator* (AAAA)\n\n\nSusanna Wallumr\u00f8d\n* 2012: *Wild Dog* (Sonovox Records)[10]\n\n\nMarnie Stern\n* 2023\u00a0: *The Comeback Kid* (Joyful Noise Records)[11]\n\n\nSolo release\n* 2016: *Limn* (NRCSS Industry)\n* 2020: *Passerine Finale* (Invada Records)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Canada portal\n* ![](image)Music portal\n\n\n1. **^** \"Jeremy Gara Discography\".
