At the end of a year, *Billboard* will publish an annual list of the 100 most successful songs throughout that year on the Hot 100 chart based on the information. For 2022, the list was published on December 1, calculated with data from November 20, 2021 to November 12, 2022.[1] At the number-one position was Glass Animals' \"Heat Waves\", which spent 5 weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100. It accumulated a total of 91 weeks on the chart, which is the longest-charting song in the 64-year history of the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\nThe 2022 Billboard Hot 100 Year-End list is also notable for being one of five Billboard Year-End lists that featured 14 songs that appeared in the previous year (in this case 2021's) repeat onto this list.

Both songs, along with six other original songs from the film, were written by Lin-Manuel Miranda *(pictured)*.\n![](image)After being featured in the fourth season of the Netflix show *Stranger
