It spent five weeks at number one on the weekly chart in 2022, and spent 91 weeks on the chart overall, becoming the longest-charting song in the Hot 100's 64-year history.[1]\nThe *Billboard* Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Its data, published by *Billboard* magazine and compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, is based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as airplay and streaming. At the end of a year, *Billboard* will publish an annual list of the 100 most successful songs throughout that year on the Hot 100 chart based on the information. For 2022, the list was published on December 1, calculated with data from November 20, 2021 to November 12, 2022.[1] At the number-one position was Glass Animals' \"Heat Waves\", which spent 5 weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100. It accumulated a total of 91 weeks on the chart, which is the longest-charting song in the 64-year history of the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\nThe 2022 Billboard Hot 100 Year-End list is also notable for being one of five Billboard Year-End lists that featured 14 songs that appeared in the previous year (in this case 2021's) repeat onto this list.

Both songs, along with six other original songs from the film, were written by Lin-Manuel Miranda *(pictured)*.\n![](image)After being featured in the fourth season of the Netflix show *Stranger

The song also topped the charts in Austria, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland and peaked at number four on the *Billboard* Hot 100.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSheeran referred to the song while explaining why the album title was *=* instead of *–*, as fans had predicted, in which he said: \"I was making the record and I wrote a song called 'Shivers' and I was like, 'This doesn't really feel like [*Minus*]\".[2] Sheeran wrote \"Shivers\" at the end of the Divide tour, when he set up a studio at a rented farm in Suffolk where he had his last date of the tour. It took him three days to write the song, which was unusually long for him, as he felt the song \"was too special to get wrong\".[3]\n\n\n\n## Release and promotion[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. \"Shivers\" (featuring Feduk and Slava Marlow) – 2:46\n\n\n |\n\n## Credits and personnel[edit]\n\n\nCredits adapted from Spotify[21] and Tidal.[22]\n\n\n\n* Ed Sheeran – vocals, songwriting, production, guitar, pizzicato violin\n* Johnny McDaid – songwriting, unknown vocals, guitar\n* Kal Lavelle – songwriting\n* Steve Mac – songwriting, production, keyboard, vocal production\n* Fred – production, bass, drums, guitar, keyboard, programming\n* Charlie Holmes – assistant mixing\n* Chris Laws – drums, programming, unknown vocals, recording\n* Dan Pursey – vocal production, unknown vocals, recording\n* Graham Archer – unknown vocals, vocal production\n* Joe Rubel – unknown vocals, recording, additional programming\n* Kieran Beardmore – assistant mixing\n* Mark “Spike” Stent – mixing\n* Matt Wolach – assistant mixing\n* Stuart Hawkes – mastering\n\n\n## Charts[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n138. **^** \"Italian single certifications – Ed Sheeran – Shivers\" (in Italian).
