Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2\u00a0billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFilms generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men \u2013 Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Gone with the Wind* is likewise represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939\u20131942 release (roadshow/\u200bgeneral release/\u200bsecond-run)[86] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to *The Sound of Music* in 1966; its 1971 entry\u2014after it took back the record\u2014includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. *The Godfather* was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and *Jaws* was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. *The Sound of Music*, *The Godfather*, *Jaws*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Titanic* increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013, and 2012, respectively, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of the highest-grossing film record\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** \"The Fate of the Furious (2017)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

It is likely that Birchard's figure is just the North American gross rental, and includes revenue from the 1954 and 1960 reissues.\n\n\nSWThe \"first run\" *Star Wars* grosses do not include revenue from the 1997 special-edition releases; however, the figure does include revenue from the re-releases prior to the special editions.\n\n\nHP1The *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* reissue totals recorded by Box Office Mojo for Brazil (2020), Italy (2021), Netherlands (2021) and South Korea (2021) have been deducted from the lifetime gross due to Box Office Mojo double-counting the original release grosses in those countries.\n\n\nHP8Production costs were shared with *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\u00a0\u2013 Part 1*.\n\n## Timeline of highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | The Fast Saga | $6,572,768,534\n | 10\n | $657,276,853\n | *Furious 7* ($1,515,341,399)\n |\n| 1\n | *Furious 7* (2015) | $1,515,341,399 |\n| 2\n | *The Fate of the Furious* (2017)*F8* | $1,238,764,765 |\n| 3\n | *Fast & Furious 6* (2013) | $788,680,968 |\n| 4\n | *F9* (2021) | $726,229,501 |\n| 5\n | *Fast X* (2023) | $714,414,576 |\n| 6\n | *Fast Five* (2011) | $626,137,675 |\n| 7\n | *Fast & Furious* (2009) | $360,366,870 |\n| 8\n | *2 Fast 2 Furious* (2003) | $236,350,661 |\n| 9\n | *The Fast and the Furious* (2001) | $207,517,509 |\n| 10\n | *Tokyo Drift* (2006) | $158,964,610\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Hobbs & Shaw* (2019) | $760,732,926\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 8\n | *Batman* | $6,843,842,452\n | 17\n | $402,578,968\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* ($1,081,169,825)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| General | * Highest-grossing films worldwide\n* Box office admissions\n* Non-English\n* Openings\n* R-rated\n* Video game adaptations\n* Independent films\n |\n| Animated | * Decades\n\t+ 1980s\n\t+ 1990s\n\t+ 2000s\n\t+ 2010s\n\t+ 2020s\n* Live-action/animated\n* Openings\n* Box office admissions\n* adult-oriented animated films\n |\n| By genre | * Action\n* Christmas\n* Fantasy\n* Horror\n* Live-action comedy\n* Musical\n* Puppet\n* Science fiction\n* Sports\n* Superhero\n |\n| By origin | * Bangladeshi\n* Czech\n* Filipino\n* Greek\n* Mexican\n* Indian\n\t+ overseas\n\t+ Bengali\n\t+ Hindi\n\t+ Malayalam\n\t+ Punjabi\n\t+ Telugu\n\t+ Tamil\n\t+ Kannada\n* Italian\n* Iranian\n* Japanese\n* Nigerian\n* Pakistani\n* Portuguese\n* Russian\n |\n| By region | * Australia\n* Austria\n* China\n* France\n* Germany\n* Hong Kong\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Italy\n* Japan\n* Malaysia\n* Nepal\n* Pakistan\n* Philippines\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* Singapore\n* South Korea\n* Soviet Union\n* Spain\n\t+ Catalan\n* Taiwan\n* Thailand\n* Turkey\n* United Kingdom\n* United States and Canada\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\u2020\u00a0*Background shading indicates that at least one film in the series is playing in the week commencing 7 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n**Highest-grossing franchises and film series**[\u00a7]\n\n(The films in each franchise can be viewed by selecting \"show\".)\n| \n\n| Rank\n | Series\n | Total worldwide gross\n | No. of films\n | Average of films\n | Highest-grossing film\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Marvel Cinematic Universe*S \u2020* | $29,782,530,744\n | 33\n | $902,500,932\n | *Avengers: Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | The Infinity Saga | $22,587,759,303\n | 23\n | $982,076,491\n | *Avengers: Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** \"The Dark Knight Rises (2012)\". *Box Office Mojo*.
