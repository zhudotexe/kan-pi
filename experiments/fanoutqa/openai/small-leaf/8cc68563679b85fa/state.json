Let me calculate the estimated population in 2023 based on the growth rate.\nTo calculate the estimated population in 2023, we need to consider the growth rate of the population in Shanghai. The population in 2022 was 26,875,500 and in 2021 it was 24,758,900. \n\nLet's calculate the growth rate first: \n\nPopulation growth rate = ((Population in 2022 - Population in 2021) / Population in 2021) * 100\n\nPopulation growth rate = ((26,875,500 - 24,758,900) / 24,758,900) * 100\nPopulation growth rate = (2,116,600 / 24,758,900) * 100\nPopulation growth rate \u2248 8.54%\n\nNow, we can estimate the population in 2023 by applying this growth rate to the population in 2022:\n\nPopulation in 2023 = Population in 2022 + (Population in 2022 * Population growth rate)\n\nLet's calculate the estimated population in 2023.",

The land is formed by the Yangtze's natural deposition and modern land reclamation projects. As such, it has sandy soil, and skyscrapers have to be built with deep concrete piles to avoid sinking into the soft ground.[73] The provincial-level Municipality of Shanghai administers both the estuary and many of its surrounding islands. It borders the provinces of Zhejiang to the south and Jiangsu to the west and north.[74] The municipality's northernmost point is on Chongming Island, which is the second-largest island in mainland China after its expansion during the 20th century.[75] It does not administratively include an exclave of Jiangsu on northern Chongming or the two islands forming Shanghai's Yangshan Port, which are parts of Zhejiang's Shengsi County.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \u00a0\u2013 Growth | ![Decrease](image) -0.2% |\n| HDI (2021) | 0.880[15] (2nd) \u2013 very high |\n| License plate prefixes | \u6caaA, B, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N\u6caaC (outer suburbs only) |\n| Abbreviation | SH / \u6caa (*H\u00f9*) |\n| City flower | Yulan magnolia |\n| Languages | ShanghaineseStandard Mandarin |\n| Website | shanghai.gov.cn |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. **^** Hou, Li (2021). *Building for Oil: Daqing and the Formation of the Chinese Socialist State*.

The growth of the city has extended beyond the limits of the city to 59 municipalities of the State of Mexico and 1 in the state of Hidalgo.[112] With a population of approximately 19.8\u00a0million inhabitants (2008),[113] it is one of the most populous conurbations in the world. Nonetheless, the annual rate of growth of the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City is much lower than that of other large urban agglomerations in Mexico,[114] a phenomenon most likely attributable to the environmental policy of decentralization. The net migration rate of Mexico City from 1995 to 2000 was negative.[115]\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan area[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Greater Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n111. **^** \"The Hispanic Experience \u2013 Indigenous Identity in Mexico\".

Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to nearly 9\u00a0million.[53]\n\n\nIn 1980 half of all the industrial jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City. Under relentless growth, the Mexico City government could barely keep up with services. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Mexico City Megalopolis as defined prior to 2019.

Some of the policies enacted included the installation of 11,000 security cameras around the city and a very large expansion of the police force. Mexico City has one of the world's highest police officer-to-resident ratios, with one uniformed officer per 100 citizens.[152] Since 1997 the prison population has increased by more than 500%.[153] Political scientist Markus-Michael M\u00fcller argues that mostly informal street vendors are hit by these measures. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGreater Mexico City was the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country until the late 1980s. Since then, government policies have supported decentralization with the aim of reducing pollution in Greater Mexico City. While still growing, the annual rate of growth has decreased and is lower than that of Greater Guadalajara and Greater Monterrey.[114]\n\n\nThe net migration rate of Mexico City proper from 1995 to 2000 was negative,[118] which implies that residents are moving to the suburbs of the metropolitan area, or to other states of Mexico. In addition, some inner suburbs are losing population to outer suburbs, indicating the continuing expansion of Greater Mexico City.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Mexico City from Torre Latinoamericana\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorically, and since Pre-Columbian times, the Valley of Anahuac has been one of the most densely populated areas in Mexico. When the Federal District was created in 1824, the urban area of Mexico City extended approximately to the area of today's Cuauht\u00e9moc borough. At the beginning of the 20th century, the *elites* began migrating to the south and west and soon the small towns of Mixcoac and San \u00c1ngel were incorporated by the growing conurbation. According to the 1921 census, 54.78% of the city's population was considered Mestizo (Indigenous mixed with European), 22.79% considered European, and 18.74% considered Indigenous.[111] This was the last Mexican Census which asked people to self-identify with a heritage other than Amerindian. In 1921, Mexico City had less than one million inhabitants.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. **^** Lafregua, J; Gutierrez, A; Aguilar E; Aparicio J; Mejia R; Santillan O; Suarez MA; Preciado M (2003). \"Balance h\u00eddrico del Valle de Mexico\" (PDF).

The city proper produces 15.8% of the country's gross domestic product.[162] In 2002, Mexico City had a Human Development Index score of 0.915,[163] identical to that of South Korea. In 2007, residents in the top twelve percent of GDP per capita holders in the city had a mean disposable income of US$98,517. The high spending power of Mexico City inhabitants makes the city attractive for companies offering prestige and luxury goods. According to a 2009 study conducted by PwC, Mexico City had a GDP of $390 billion, ranking it as the eighth richest city in the world and the richest in Latin America.[164] In 2009, Mexico City alone would rank as the 30th largest economy in the world.[165]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Mexico City** (Spanish: *Ciudad de M\u00e9xico*,[a][10] locally [sju\u02c8\u00f0a(\u00f0) \u00f0e \u02c8mexiko] \u24d8; abbr.: **CDMX**; Nahuatl: *\u0100ltep\u0113tl M\u0113xihco*, Nahuatl pronunciation: [a\u02d0l'tepe\u02d0t\u0361\u026c me\u02d0\u02c8\u0283i\u0294ko]; Otomi: *'Monda*) is the capital and largest city of Mexico, and the most populous city in North America.[11][12] Mexico City is one of the most important cultural and financial centers in the world.[13] It is located in the Valley of Mexico within the high Mexican central plateau, at an altitude of 2,240 meters (7,350\u00a0ft).

With a population of 21,804,515 (2020 census), Greater Mexico City is both the biggest and the densest metropolitan area in the country. Of the ca. 21.8 million, 9.2 million live in Mexico City proper[7] and 12.4 million in the State of Mexico (ca. 75% of the state's population), including the municipalities of:[7]\n\n\n\n* Ecatepec de Morelos (pop. 1,645,352)\n* Nezahualc\u00f3yotl (pop. 1,077,208)\n* Naucalpan (pop. 834,434)\n* Chimalhuac\u00e1n (pop. 705,193)\n* Tlalnepantla de Baz (pop. 672,202)\n\n\n#### Megalopolis[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico is the largest archdiocese in the world.[122] There are two Catholic cathedrals in the city, the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral and the Iztapalapa Cathedral, and three former Catholic churches who are now the cathedrals of other rites, the San Jos\u00e9 de Gracia Cathedral (Anglican church), the Porta Coeli Cathedral (Melkite Greek Catholic church) and the Valvanera Cathedral (Maronite church).\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nRepresenting around 18.74% of the city's population, indigenous peoples from different areas of Mexico have migrated to the capital in search of better economic opportunities.

(The Mexican\u2013American War had just been fought.) The last changes to the limits of Mexico City were made between 1898 and 1902, reducing the area to the current 1,479\u00a0km2 (571\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) by adjusting the southern border with the state of Morelos. By that time, the total number of municipalities within Mexico City was twenty-two. In 1941, the General Anaya borough was merged with the Central Department, which was then renamed \"Mexico City\" (thus reviving the name but not the autonomous municipality).

While they are not fully equivalent to municipalities, the boroughs have gained significant autonomy.[148] Formerly appointed by the Federal District's head of government, local authorities were first elected directly by plurality in 2000. From 2016, each borough is headed by a mayor, expanding their local government powers.[148]\n\n\nThe boroughs of Mexico City with their 2020 populations are:[149]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAdditionally, Mexico City is home to large communities of expatriates and immigrants from the rest of North America (U.S. and Canada), from South America (mainly from Argentina and Colombia, but also from Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Venezuela), from Central America and the Caribbean (mainly from Cuba, Guatemala, El Salvador, Haiti and Honduras); from Europe (mainly from Spain, Germany and Switzerland, but also from Czech Republic, Hungary, France, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania),[125][126] and from the Arab world (mostly from Lebanon, and other countries like Syria and Egypt).[127]\n\n\nMexico City is home to the largest population of Americans living outside the United States. Estimates are as high as 700,000 Americans living in Mexico City, while in 1999 the U.S. Bureau of Consular Affairs estimated over 440,000 Americans lived in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area.[128][129]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Founded | * + 13\u00a0March\u00a01325\u00a0(1325-03-13):Mexico-Tenochtitlan[1]\n\t+ 13\u00a0August\u00a01521\u00a0(1521-08-13):Ciudad de M\u00e9xico[2]\n\t+ 18\u00a0November\u00a01824\u00a0(1824-11-18):Distrito Federal[3]\n\t+ 29\u00a0January\u00a02016\u00a0(2016-01-29):Ciudad de M\u00e9xico[4]\n |\n| Founded by | * + Tenoch (as Mexico-Tenochtitlan)\n\t+ Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s (as Mexico City)\n |\n| Government |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Head of Government | Mart\u00ed Batres |\n| Area[5][b]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Total | 1,485\u00a0km2 (573\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n|  | Ranked 32nd |\n| Elevation | 2,240\u00a0m (7,350\u00a0ft) |\n| Highest\u00a0elevation[6] (Ajusco)\n | 3,930\u00a0m (12,890\u00a0ft) |\n| Population(2020)[7]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Total | 9,209,944 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Rank | 1st in North America1st in Mexico |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Density | 6,200/km2 (16,000/sq\u00a0mi) |\n| \u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Rank | 1st |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Metro area | 21,804,515 |\n| Demonyms | * Capitalino (a)\n* Mexique\u00f1o (a) (archaic)\n* Chilango (a) (colloquial)\n |\n| Time zone | UTC\u221206:00 (CST) |\n| Postal code | 00\u201316\n |\n| Area code | 55/56 |\n| ISO 3166 code | MX-CMX |\n| Patron Saint | Philip of Jesus (Spanish: *San Felipe de Jes\u00fas*) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Mexico City (Tacubaya), 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1877\u20132018\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 33.5(92.3)\n | 32.9(91.2)\n | 33.7(92.7)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 33.5(92.3)\n | 29.6(85.3)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 29.2(84.6)\n | 31.5(88.7)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 22.3(72.1)\n | 24.2(75.6)\n | 26.0(78.8)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 24.4(75.9)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 22.3(72.1)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n | 17.1(62.8)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n | 20.9(69.6)\n | 19.9(67.8)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 19.1(66.4)\n | 18.6(65.5)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 15.5(59.9)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 13.1(55.6)\n | 13.1(55.6)\n | 11.8(53.2)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** *Diccionario Porrua de Historia, Biografia y Geografia de Mexico 6th ed. \u2013 Mexico, Cuenca de* (in Spanish).

This valley is located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in the high plateaus of south-central Mexico.[77][78]\n\n\nIt has a minimum altitude of 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over 5,000 meters (16,000 feet).[79] This valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides, making the city vulnerable to flooding. Drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century.[77][79]\n\n\nMexico City primarily rests on what was Lake Texcoco.[77] Seismic activity is frequent there.[80] Lake Texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century. Although none of the lake waters remain, the city rests on the lake bed's heavily saturated clay. This soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater, called *groundwater-related subsidence*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Media related to Mexico City at Wikimedia Commons\n* ![](image) Geographic data related to Mexico City at OpenStreetMap\n* Mexico City Government (in Spanish)\n* Mexico City Tourism Ministry Archived 30 July 2013 at the Wayback Machine (in Spanish)\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMexico City\n |\n| --- |\n| Topics | * Administrative divisions\n\t+ Boroughs\n\t+ Neighborhoods\n\t+ Barrios M\u00e1gicos\n* Airport\n* Architecture\n\t+ Archaeological sites\n\t+ Colonial government and civil buildings\n\t+ Colonial churches\n\t+ Skyscrapers\n* Downtown\n* Folk art\n* Gentrification\n* Government\n\t+ Constituent Assembly\n\t+ Federal District buildings\n\t+ Heads of government\n\t+ Law enforcement\n\t+ Legislative Assembly\n* History\n\t+ Timeline\n* Metropolitan area\n* Parking\n* Pollution\n* Street vendors\n* Transport\n* Water management\n | ![Coat of arms of Mexico City](image)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| HDI | ![Increase](image)0.837 **Very High**[8] |\n| Gross metropolitan product | US$340.750\u00a0billion (Nominal)\nUS$711.405\u00a0billion (PPP)[9] |\n| Website | www.cdmx.gob.mx (in Spanish) |\n|  |\n| UNESCO World Heritage Site\n |\n| Official name | Historic center of Mexico City, Xochimilco and Central University City Campus of the UNAM |\n| Type | Cultural |\n| Criteria | i, ii, iii, iv, v |\n| Designated | 1987, 2007 (11th, 31st sessions) |\n| Reference\u00a0no. | 412, 1250 |\n| Region | Latin America and the Caribbean |\n|  |\n| **^** b.

On average Mexico City sinks 20 inches (1 foot and 8 inches) or 50 centimetres (1/2 meters) every year.[81] This sinking is causing problems with runoff and wastewater management, leading to flooding problems, especially during the summer.[79][80][82] The entire lake bed is now paved over and most of the city's remaining forested areas lie in the southern boroughs of Milpa Alta, Tlalpan and Xochimilco.[80]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Mexico City geophysical maps\n |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Topography\n | Hydrology\n | Climate patterns\n |\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Water management in Greater Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDue in large part to the persuasion of representative Servando Teresa de Mier, Mexico City was chosen because it was the center of the country's population and history, even though Quer\u00e9taro was closer to the center geographically. The choice was official on 18 November 1824, and Congress delineated a surface area of two leagues square (8,800 acres) centered on the Zocalo. This area was then separated from the State of Mexico, forcing that state's government to move from the Palace of the Inquisition (now Museum of Mexican Medicine) in the city to Texcoco. This area did not include the population centers of the towns of Coyoac\u00e1n, Xochimilco, Mexicaltzingo and Tlalpan, all of which remained as part of the State of Mexico.[138]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEconomically, Mexico City prospered as a result of trade. Unlike Brazil or Peru, Mexico had easy contact with both the Atlantic and Pacific worlds. Although the Spanish crown tried to completely regulate all commerce in the city, it had only partial success.[59]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
