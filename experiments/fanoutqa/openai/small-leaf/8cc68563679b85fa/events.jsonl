Nonetheless, the annual rate of growth of the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City is much lower than that of other large urban agglomerations in Mexico,[114] a phenomenon most likely attributable to the environmental policy of decentralization.

Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to nearly 9 million.[53]\n\n\nIn 1980 half of all the industrial jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City. Under relentless growth, the Mexico City government could barely keep up with services. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Mexico City Megalopolis as defined prior to 2019.

Some of the policies enacted included the installation of 11,000 security cameras around the city and a very large expansion of the police force. Mexico City has one of the world's highest police officer-to-resident ratios, with one uniformed officer per 100 citizens.[152] Since 1997 the prison population has increased by more than 500%.[153] Political scientist Markus-Michael Müller argues that mostly informal street vendors are hit by these measures. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGreater Mexico City was the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country until the late 1980s. Since then, government policies have supported decentralization with the aim of reducing pollution in Greater Mexico City. While still growing, the annual rate of growth has decreased and is lower than that of Greater Guadalajara and Greater Monterrey.[114]\n\n\nThe net migration rate of Mexico City proper from 1995 to 2000 was negative,[118] which implies that residents are moving to the suburbs of the metropolitan area, or to other states of Mexico. In addition, some inner suburbs are losing population to outer suburbs, indicating the continuing expansion of Greater Mexico City.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Mexico City from Torre Latinoamericana\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorically, and since Pre-Columbian times, the Valley of Anahuac has been one of the most densely populated areas in Mexico.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the *elites* began migrating to the south and west and soon the small towns of Mixcoac and San Ángel were incorporated by the growing conurbation. According to the 1921 census, 54.78% of the city's population was considered Mestizo (Indigenous mixed with European), 22.79% considered European, and 18.74% considered Indigenous.[111] This was the last Mexican Census which asked people to self-identify with a heritage other than Amerindian.

Estimates are as high as 700,000 Americans living in Mexico City, while in 1999 the U.S. Bureau of Consular Affairs estimated over 440,000 Americans lived in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area.[128][129]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Founded | * + 13 March 1325 (1325-03-13):Mexico-Tenochtitlan[1]\n\t+ 13 August 1521 (1521-08-13):Ciudad de México[2]\n\t+ 18 November 1824 (1824-11-18):Distrito Federal[3]\n\t+ 29 January 2016 (2016-01-29):Ciudad de México[4]\n |\n| Founded by | * + Tenoch (as Mexico-Tenochtitlan)\n\t+ Hernán Cortés (as Mexico City)\n |\n| Government |\n|  • Head of Government | Martí Batres |\n| Area[5][b]\n |\n|  • Total | 1,485 km2 (573 sq mi) |\n|  | Ranked 32nd |\n| Elevation | 2,240 m (7,350 ft) |\n| Highest elevation[6] (Ajusco)\n | 3,930 m (12,890 ft) |\n| Population(2020)[7]\n |\n|  • Total | 9,209,944 |\n|  • Rank | 1st in North America1st in Mexico |\n|  • Density | 6,200/km2 (16,000/sq mi) |\n|   • Rank | 1st |\n|  • Metro area | 21,804,515 |\n| Demonyms | * Capitalino (a)\n* Mexiqueño (a) (archaic)\n* Chilango (a) (colloquial)\n |\n| Time zone | UTC−06:00 (CST) |\n| Postal code | 00–16\n |\n| Area code | 55/56 |\n| ISO 3166 code | MX-CMX |\n| Patron Saint | Philip of Jesus (Spanish: *San Felipe de Jesús*) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Mexico City (Tacubaya), 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1877–2018\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 33.5(92.3)\n | 32.9(91.2)\n | 33.7(92.7)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 33.5(92.3)\n | 29.6(85.3)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 29.2(84.6)\n | 31.5(88.7)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 22.3(72.1)\n | 24.2(75.6)\n | 26.0(78.8)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 24.4(75.9)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 22.3(72.1)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n | 17.1(62.8)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n | 20.9(69.6)\n | 19.9(67.8)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 19.1(66.4)\n | 18.6(65.5)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 15.5(59.9)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 13.1(55.6)\n | 13.1(55.6)\n | 11.8(53.2)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** *Diccionario Porrua de Historia, Biografia y Geografia de Mexico 6th ed. – Mexico, Cuenca de* (in Spanish).

This valley is located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in the high plateaus of south-central Mexico.[77][78]\n\n\nIt has a minimum altitude of 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over 5,000 meters (16,000 feet).[79] This valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides, making the city vulnerable to flooding. Drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century.[77][79]\n\n\nMexico City primarily rests on what was Lake Texcoco.[77] Seismic activity is frequent there.[80] Lake Texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century. Although none of the lake waters remain, the city rests on the lake bed's heavily saturated clay. This soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater, called *groundwater-related subsidence*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Media related to Mexico City at Wikimedia Commons\n* ![](image) Geographic data related to Mexico City at OpenStreetMap\n* Mexico City Government (in Spanish)\n* Mexico City Tourism Ministry Archived 30 July 2013 at the Wayback Machine (in Spanish)\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMexico City\n |\n| --- |\n| Topics | * Administrative divisions\n\t+ Boroughs\n\t+ Neighborhoods\n\t+ Barrios Mágicos\n* Airport\n* Architecture\n\t+ Archaeological sites\n\t+ Colonial government and civil buildings\n\t+ Colonial churches\n\t+ Skyscrapers\n* Downtown\n* Folk art\n* Gentrification\n* Government\n\t+ Constituent Assembly\n\t+ Federal District buildings\n\t+ Heads of government\n\t+ Law enforcement\n\t+ Legislative Assembly\n* History\n\t+ Timeline\n* Metropolitan area\n* Parking\n* Pollution\n* Street vendors\n* Transport\n* Water management\n | ![Coat of arms of Mexico City](image)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| HDI | ![Increase](image)0.837 **Very High**[8] |\n| Gross metropolitan product | US$340.750 billion (Nominal)\nUS$711.405 billion (PPP)[9] |\n| Website | www.cdmx.gob.mx (in Spanish) |\n|  |\n| UNESCO World Heritage Site\n |\n| Official name | Historic center of Mexico City, Xochimilco and Central University City Campus of the UNAM |\n| Type | Cultural |\n| Criteria | i, ii, iii, iv, v |\n| Designated | 1987, 2007 (11th, 31st sessions) |\n| Reference no. | 412, 1250 |\n| Region | Latin America and the Caribbean |\n|  |\n| **^** b.

On average Mexico City sinks 20 inches (1 foot and 8 inches) or 50 centimetres (1/2 meters) every year.[81] This sinking is causing problems with runoff and wastewater management, leading to flooding problems, especially during the summer.[79][80][82] The entire lake bed is now paved over and most of the city's remaining forested areas lie in the southern boroughs of Milpa Alta, Tlalpan and Xochimilco.[80]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Mexico City geophysical maps\n |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Topography\n | Hydrology\n | Climate patterns\n |\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Water management in Greater Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDue in large part to the persuasion of representative Servando Teresa de Mier, Mexico City was chosen because it was the center of the country's population and history, even though Querétaro was closer to the center geographically. The choice was official on 18 November 1824, and Congress delineated a surface area of two leagues square (8,800 acres) centered on the Zocalo. This area was then separated from the State of Mexico, forcing that state's government to move from the Palace of the Inquisition (now Museum of Mexican Medicine) in the city to Texcoco. This area did not include the population centers of the towns of Coyoacán, Xochimilco, Mexicaltzingo and Tlalpan, all of which remained as part of the State of Mexico.[138]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEconomically, Mexico City prospered as a result of trade. Unlike Brazil or Peru, Mexico had easy contact with both the Atlantic and Pacific worlds. Although the Spanish crown tried to completely regulate all commerce in the city, it had only partial success.[59]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_leoIkN6rxy24DXHMurW70xmk","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
