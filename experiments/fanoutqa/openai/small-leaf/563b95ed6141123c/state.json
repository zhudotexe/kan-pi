Malay is the symbolic national language, while English is the main working language.[9] Education in Singapore is bilingual, with English being the medium of instruction. Students are also required to learn a second language, usually Malay, Mandarin, or Tamil.[10][11] Singlish, a local creole and accent, is often used in colloquial speech between all native races of Singapore. There is also Singdarin, a Mandarin creole.\n\n\nThe annual total population growth rate for the year 2020 was -0.3%.[12][13] Singapore's resident total fertility rate (TFR) was 1.10 in 2020; the Singaporean Chinese, Malay and Indian fertility rates were 0.94, 1.83 and 0.97 respectively.[14] In 2018, the Singaporean Malay fertility rate was about 85% higher than that of Singaporean Chinese and Singaporean Indians, while approximately 70% higher in 2010.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Population growth[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"Archived copy\" (PDF).

By the 1990\u20132000 period, the number of migrants had overtaken the natural population increase, constituting nearly two-thirds of the decadal population increase with 640,571 net migrants including non-residents.[16] While the racial composition of its citizens has been fairly constant in recent years, it shows a shift in the figures for its residents (citizens plus permanent residents). Fewer of the immigrants were Malays, therefore the percentage resident population of the Malays began to fall. Indian residents, however, rose to 9.2% in 2010 due to an increase in the number of Indians migrant workers (compared to 7.4% Indians in the figures for citizens).[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSingapore, following its founding as a British free port by Stamford Raffles in the 19th century, did not have a sizeable native population as the population became dominated by three main groups of immigrants.[21][57][58] When Raffles arrived in Singapore in January 1819, Singapore had approximately 120 Malays, 30 Chinese and some native tribes (Orang Laut) under the rule of the Temenggung.[59] Around 100 of the Malays had originally moved to Singapore from the mainland (Johor) in 1811, led by the Temenggung. Other estimates place the then population of Singapore at 1,000, belonging to various local tribes.[17] Early census figures show a long influx of migrant workers into the country, initially comprising mostly Malays, but shortly thereafter followed by the Chinese. By 1821, the population was estimated to have increased to 4,724 Malays and 1,150 Chinese.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 10 | Bukit Batok | West | 168,560 | 20 | Queenstown | Central | 99,690\n |\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Race in Singapore and Singaporeans\n\n### Post-independence[edit]\n\n\nIn the post-independence period, the population of Singapore has been categorised into four main groups: Chinese, Malays, Indians, and Others.

Large number of Chinese migrants started to enter Singapore just months after it became a British settlement, and they were predominantly male. In 1826, official census figures give a total population of 13,750, with 6,088 Chinese, 4,790 Malays, 1,242 Bugis, 1,021 Indians from Bengal (244) and the Coromandel Coast (777), smaller number of Javanese (267), Europeans (87) and other peoples.[19] The population total of Singapore increased to 16,000 in 1829, 26,000 five years later. By 1836, the Chinese at 13,749 had become the most populous ethnic group, overtaking the broad Malay grouping (12,538, including other groups such as the Bugis, Javanese, and Balinese from the Dutch East Indies).[60] By 1849, the population had reached 59,043, 24,790 of them Chinese.[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSingapore has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world.[29] In 2012, Singapore total fertility rate (TFR) was 1.20 children born per woman, a sub-replacement fertility rate. Ethnic Chinese had a fertility of 1.07 in 2004 (1.65 in 1990), while Malays had a TFR of 2.10 (2.69 in 1990). Both figures declined further in 2006. TFR for Indians was 1.30 in 2004 and 1.89 in 1990.[30] The Singapore government has launched several highly publicised attempts to raise the fertility rate and increase awareness of the negative effects of an ageing population, the elderly (65 and above) had constituted 9.9% of its population in 2012; this proportion is still significantly lower than that of many other developed nations, such as the United States and Japan. In February 2015, National University of Singapore launched the \"New Age Institute\" in conjunction with Washington University in St. Louis to conduct research on this issue.[31]\n\n\n\n### Area planning[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

An official Bahraini document revealed that 51% of the country's citizens are Sunnis, while the Shiite population has declined to 49% of the Muslim population.[28]\n\n\nForeigners, overwhelmingly from South Asia and other Arab countries, constituted 52.6% of the population in 2020.[10] Of these, 50.9% are Muslim and 49.1% are non-Muslim,[10] including Christians (primarily: Catholic, Protestant, Syriac Orthodox, and Mar Thoma from South India), Hindus, Buddhists, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, and Sikhs.\n\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRegarding the ethnicity of Bahrainis, a *Financial Times* article published on 31 May 1983 found that \"*Bahrain is a polyglot state, both religiously and racially.

Like neighbouring countries, Brunei is a Malay-dominated country. Many cultural and linguistic differences make Brunei Malays distinct from the larger Malay populations in nearby Malaysia and Indonesia, even though they are ethnically related and share the Muslim religion.\n\n\nBrunei has a hereditary nobility with the title Pengiran these are, more often than not, related to the Sultan by blood. The Sultan can award to commoners the title Pehin, the equivalent of a life peerage awarded in the United Kingdom. The Sultan also can award his subjects the Dato, the equivalent of a knighthood in the United Kingdom, and Datin, the equivalent of a damehood.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe official language is Malay, but English is widely understood and used in business. Other languages spoken are several Chinese dialects, Iban, and a number of native dialects. Islam is the official religion, but religious freedom is guaranteed under the constitution.\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nThe UN estimates Brunei's total population as 445,373 as of 2021.\n\n\nThe CIA World Factbook estimates the population at 450,565 as of July 2018.[1]\n\n\n\n### UN estimates[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 192,832\n | 260,482\n | 332,800\n | 393,372\n |\n| 1 The Kedayan were only mentioned as a separate ethnic group in the 1960 census; they are probably included in the Malay in the other censuses. 2 included in 'Others' |\n\n\nAccording to the 1991 census, Bruneian (Malay or also called Kedayan) were 67% of the population, Chinese were 16%, indigenous were 6%, and others (including Indians) were 12%.

Many Brunei Malay women wear the tudong, a traditional head covering. Men wear the songkok, a traditional Malay cap. Men who have completed the Haj wear a white songkok.\n\n\nThe requirements to attain Brunei citizenship include passing tests in Malay culture, customs and language. Stateless permanent residents of Brunei are given International Certificates of Identity, which allow them to travel overseas. The majority of Brunei's Chinese are permanent residents, and many are stateless.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPetroleum wealth allows the Brunei Government to provide the population with one of Asia's finest health care systems. The Brunei Medical and Health Department introduced the region's first government \"flying doctor service\" in early 1965. Malaria has been eradicated, and cholera is virtually nonexistent. There are three general hospitals\u2014in Bandar Seri Begawan, Tutong, and Kuala Belait\u2014and there are numerous health clinics throughout the country.\n\n\nEducation starts with preschool, followed by 6 years of primary education and up to 6 years of secondary education. Nine years of education are mandatory. Most of Brunei's college students attend universities and other institutions abroad, but approximately 2,542 study at the University of Brunei Darussalam. Opened in 1985, the university has a faculty of over 300 instructors and is located on a sprawling campus at Tungku, overlooking the South China Sea.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| *
