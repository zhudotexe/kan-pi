In preparation for this expansion in mission, William Smith was hired in 1754 to become the new provost. Neither George Whitefield nor Benjamin Franklin formally held this title.\n2. **^** Benjamin Franklin is the founder of the institution which grew to become the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin first convened a board of trustees for an organizational meeting on November 13, 1749. They opened a secondary school, the Academy of Philadelphia, in 1751. A collegiate charter was obtained for the College of Philadelphia in 1755 and post-secondary instruction began shortly thereafter. It was the College of Philadelphia which ultimately was renamed the University of Pennsylvania in 1791. Penn considered 1749 to be its founding date until 1899, when the board of trustees voted to retroactively revise its founding date to 1740 in order to make the university older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746. The 1740 date was selected because, in that year, a group of Philadelphians joined together to build a large preaching hall for the use of traveling evangelist George Whitefield who toured the American colonies delivering well attended open air sermons. The grand building was erected but, due to a shortage of funding, the interior was not furnished and the hall sat unused until Franklin's group purchased it in 1750. Thus, Whitefield himself was not involved in the school which eventually became Penn, but is listed here as a placeholder to signify the period that the preaching hall raised by his followers sat dormant between 1740 and 1750.\n3. **^** As described in more detail in the appended notes, a charity school was planned by followers of George Whitefield but it never opened before the building was purchased by Benjamin Franklin's group in 1750. The structure itself was known as the \"New Building\" but the associated educational trust itself was never named.\n4. **^** Franklin's formal title was president of the board of trustees, first of the \"Academy and Charitable School in the Province of Pennsylvania\" until the college was founded, and then of the \"College, Academy and Charity School of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.\"\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Schools | * Arts and Sciences\n\t+ College\n\t+ Graduate Division\n\t+ Liberal and Professional Studies\n* Communication\n* Dental Medicine\n* Design\n* Education\n* Engineering and Applied Science\n* Law\n* Medicine\n* Nursing\n* Social Policy and Practice\n* Veterinary Medicine\n* Wharton\n | ![Benjamin Franklin (University of Pennsylvania)](image)\n |\n| Programs | * Advanced Judaic Studies\n* Government\n* Global Communication Studies\n* Mediterranean Art and Archaeology\n* International Studies and Business\n* Management and Technology\n* Lauder Institute\n* Health Economics\n* Networked and Social Systems Engineering\n* Molecular Life Science\n* Public Policy\n* Diplomacy and Global Engagement\n |\n| Places | * University City\n* Annenberg Center\n* College Hall\n* College Houses\n* David Rittenhouse Laboratory\n* Fisher Fine Arts Library\n* Historic District\n* Houston Hall\n* Institute of Contemporary Art\n* Irvine Auditorium\n* Kelly Writers House\n* Meyerson Hall\n* Moore School\n* Morris Arboretum\n* Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology\n* New Bolton Center\n* Penn Park\n* Perelman Quadrangle\n* The Quadrangle\n* Richards Laboratories\n* Van Pelt Library\n |\n| Athletics | * Penn Quakers\n* Band\n* \"Fight on, Pennsylvania!\"\n* Basketball\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Football\n* College Boat Club\n* Lacrosse\n* Penn Relays\n* Soccer\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Men's squash\n* Class of 1923 Arena\n* Franklin Field\n* Meiklejohn Stadium\n* Palestra\n |\n| Media | * *The Daily Pennsylvanian*\n\t+ *34th Street Magazine*\n\t+ *Under the Button*\n* *Pennsylvania Punch Bowl*\n* Penn Press\n* Wharton School Publishing\n* WQHS\n* WXPN\n |\n| Life | * Student life\n* Penn Band\n* Mask and Wig\n* Glee Club\n* Masala\n* MERT\n* Philomathean Society\n* Penn Club of New York\n* \"Hail, Pennsylvania!\"\n* \"The Red and Blue\"\n |\n| People | * **President:** J.

A statue of George Whitefield was located in the Dormitory Quadrangle, standing in front of the Morris and Bodine sections of the present Ware College House on the University of Pennsylvania campus.[47] On 2 July 2020, the University of Pennsylvania announced they would be removing the statue because of Whitefield's connection to slavery.[48]\n\n\n\n## Marriage[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)*The Reverend George Whitefield* statue that formerly stood on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBorn in Gloucester, he matriculated at Pembroke College at the University of Oxford in 1732. There he joined the \"Holy Club\" and was introduced to the Wesley brothers, John and Charles, with whom he would work closely in his later ministry. Whitefield was ordained after receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree. He immediately began preaching, but he did not settle as the minister of any parish. Rather he became an itinerant preacher and evangelist. In 1740, Whitefield traveled to North America where he preached a series of revivals that became part of the \"Great Awakening\". His methods were controversial, and he engaged in numerous debates and disputes with other clergymen.\n\n\nWhitefield received widespread recognition during his ministry; he preached at least 18,000 times to perhaps 10 million listeners in Great Britain and her American colonies. Whitefield could enthrall large audiences through a potent combination of drama, religious eloquence, and patriotism.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Wesley 1774.\n32. **^** Yrigoyen & Daugherty 1999.\n33. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Koch 2015, pp.\u00a0369\u2013393.\n34. **^** Parr 2015, pp.\u00a05, 65.\n35. **^** Babb 2013.\n36. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Dallimore 2010, p.\u00a0148.\n37. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Stein 2009, p.\u00a0243.\n38. **^** Parr 2015, p.\u00a076.\n39. **^** Parr 2015, p.\u00a067.\n40. **^** Cashin 2001, p.\u00a075.\n41. **^** \"On the Death of the Rev.

The Church of England did not assign him a church, so he began preaching in parks and fields in England on his own, reaching out to people who normally did not attend church. In 1738 he went to Savannah, Georgia in the American colonies as parish priest[*citation needed*] of Christ Church, which had been founded by John Wesley while he was in Savannah. While there Whitefield decided that one of the great needs of the area was an orphan house. He decided this would be his life's work. In 1739 he returned to England to raise funds, as well as to receive priest's orders. While preparing for his return, he preached to large congregations. At the suggestion of friends he preached to the miners of Kingswood, outside Bristol, in the open air. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1740 he engaged Moravian Brethren from Georgia to build an orphanage for negro children on land he had bought in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania. Following a theological disagreement, he dismissed them and was unable to complete the building, which the Moravians subsequently bought and completed. This now is the Whitefield House in the center of the Moravian borough of Nazareth, Pennsylvania.[18][19]\n\n\n\n## Revival meetings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGeorge Whitefield College, Whitefield College of the Bible, and Whitefield Theological Seminary are all named after him.

He \"was the first internationally famous itinerant preacher and the first modern transatlantic celebrity of any kind.\"\n4. \"Perhaps he was the greatest evangelical preacher that the world has ever seen.\"\n\n\nMark Galli wrote of Whitefield's legacy:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Old Bell Inn, Southgate Street, Gloucester\nWhitefield was born on 27 December\u00a0[O.S. 16 December]\u00a01714 at the Bell Inn, Southgate Street, Gloucester. Whitefield was the fifth son (seventh and last child) of Thomas Whitefield and Elizabeth Edwards, who kept an inn at Gloucester.[4] His father died when he was only two years old, and he helped his mother with the inn. At an early age, he found that he had a passion and talent for acting in the theatre, a passion that he would carry on with the very theatrical re-enactments of Bible stories he told during his sermons. He was educated at The Crypt School in Gloucester[5] and at Pembroke College, Oxford.[6][7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* MacFarlan, D.

He wrote, \"I think God has a Quarrel with you for your Abuse of and Cruelty to the poor Negroes.\"[39] Furthermore, Whitefield wrote: \"Your dogs are caressed and fondled at your tables; but your slaves who are frequently styled dogs or beasts, have not an equal privilege.\"[29] However, Whitefield \"stopped short of rendering a moral judgment on slavery itself as an institution\".[37]\n\n\nWhitefield is remembered as one of the first to preach to slaves.[30] Some have claimed that the Bethesda Orphanage \"set an example of humane treatment\" of black people.[40] Phillis Wheatley (1753\u20131784), who was a slave, wrote a poem \"On the Death of the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield\" in 1770. The first line calls Whitefield a \"happy saint\".[41]\n\n\n\n## Relationship with Benjamin Franklin[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)George Whitefield's grave in the crypt of Old South Presbyterian Church in Newburyport, Massachusetts, between Jonathan Parsons and Joseph Prince\nIt was John Wesley who preached his funeral sermon in London, at Whitefield's request.[58]\n\n\nWhitefield left almost \u00a31,500 (equivalent to \u00a3263,000 in 2023) to friends and family.

The society meeting at the second Kingswood School at Kingswood was eventually also named Whitefield's Tabernacle. Whitefield acted as chaplain to Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, and some of his followers joined the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion, whose chapels were built by Selina, where a form of Calvinistic Methodism similar to Whitefield's was taught. Many of Selina's chapels were built in the English and Welsh counties,[13] and one, Spa Fields Chapel, was erected in London.[14][15]\n\n\n\n## Bethesda Orphanage[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn an age when crossing the Atlantic Ocean was a long and hazardous adventure, he visited America seven times, making 13 ocean crossings in total. (He died in America.) It is estimated that throughout his life, he preached more than 18,000 formal sermons, of which 78 have been published.[59] In addition to his work in North America and England, he made 15 journeys to Scotland\u2014most famously to the \"*Preaching Braes*\" of Cambuslang in 1742\u2014two journeys to Ireland, and one each to Bermuda, Gibraltar, and the Netherlands.[60] In England and Wales, Whitefield's itinerary included every county.[61]\n\n\nWhitfield County, Georgia, is named after Whitefield.[62] When the act by the Georgia General Assembly was written to create the county, the \"e\" was omitted from the spelling of the name to reflect the pronunciation of the name.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** Time Line adapted from \"The Life of George Whitefield: A Timeline 1714\u20131770\"\n50. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Galli 1993a.\n51. **^** Dallimore 1980, pp.\u00a0101, 109.\n52. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Schlenther, Boyd Stanley (2010) [2004]. \"Whitefield, George (1714\u20131770)\".

Whitefield wanted the orphanage to be a place of strong Gospel influence, with a wholesome atmosphere and strong discipline.[17] Having raised the money by his preaching, Whitefield \"insisted on sole control of the orphanage\". He refused to give the trustees a financial accounting. The trustees also objected to Whitefield's using \"a wrong method\" to control the children, who \"are often kept praying and crying all the night\".[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Choi\u0144ski, Micha\u0142 (2016). *The Rhetoric of the Revival: The Language of the Great Awakening Preachers*.

In 1747 he published *A Further Account of God's Dealings with the Reverend George Whitefield*, covering the period from his ordination to his first voyage to Georgia. In 1756, a vigorously edited version of his journals and autobiographical accounts was published.[92][93] Whitefield was \"profoundly image-conscious\". His writings were \"intended to convey Whitefield and his life as a model for biblical ethics ... , as humble and pious\".[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 14 November 1741 Whitefield married Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Gwynne), a widow previously known as Elizabeth James.[51] After their 1744\u20131748 stay in America, she never accompanied him on his travels. Whitefield reflected that \"none in America could bear her\". His wife believed that she had been \"but a load and burden\" to him.[52] In 1743 after four miscarriages, Elizabeth bore the couple's only child, a son. The baby died at four months old.[50] Twenty-five years later, Elizabeth died of a fever on 9 August 1768 and was buried in a vault at the Tottenham Court Road Chapel. At the end of the 19th century the Chapel needed restoration and all those interred there, except Augustus Toplady, were moved to Chingford Mount cemetery in north London; her grave is unmarked in its new location.[4][53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen Whitefield returned to England in 1742, an estimated crowd of 20\u201330,000 met him.[27] One such open-air congregation took place on Minchinhampton Common, Gloucestershire. Whitefield preached to the \"Rodborough congregation\"\u2014a gathering of 10,000 people\u2014at a place now known as \"Whitefield's tump\".[*citation needed*] Whitefield sought to influence the colonies after he returned to England. He contracted to have his autobiographical *Journals* published throughout America. These *Journals* have been characterized as \"the ideal vehicle for crafting a public image that could work in his absence.\" They depicted Whitefield in the \"best possible light\". When he returned to America for his third tour in 1745, he was better known than when he had left.[28]\n\n\n\n## Slaveholder and advocate of slavery[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Whitefield preaching. 1857 engraving\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Galli, Mark (1993b). \"Slaveholding Evangelist: Whitefield's Troubling Mix of Views\". *Christian History*.

Whitefield replied that if bishops did not authorize his itinerant preaching, God would give him the authority.[4] In 1740, Jonathan Edwards invited Whitefield to preach in his church in Northampton. Edwards was \"deeply disturbed by his unqualified appeals to emotion, his openly judging those he considered unconverted, and his demand for instant conversions\". Whitefield refused to discuss Edwards' misgivings with him. Later, Edwards delivered a series of sermons containing but \"thinly veiled critiques\" of Whitefield's preaching, \"warning against over-dependence upon a preacher's eloquence and fervency\".[4] During Whitefield's 1744\u20131748 visit to America, ten critical pamphlets were published, two by officials of Harvard and Yale. This criticism was in part evoked by Whitefield's criticism of \"their education and Christian commitment\" in his Journal of 1741. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBenjamin Franklin attended a revival meeting in Philadelphia and was greatly impressed with Whitefield's ability to deliver a message to such a large group. Franklin had previously dismissed as exaggeration reports of Whitefield preaching to crowds of the order of tens of thousands in England. When listening to Whitefield preaching from the Philadelphia court house, Franklin walked away towards his shop in Market Street until he could no longer hear Whitefield distinctly\u2014Whitefield could be heard over 500 feet. He then estimated his distance from Whitefield and calculated the area of a semicircle centred on Whitefield. Allowing two square feet per person he computed that Whitefield could be heard by over 30,000 people in the open air.[42][43] After one of Whitefield's sermons, Franklin noted the:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhitefield chastised other clergy for teaching only \"the shell and shadow of religion\" because they did not hold the necessity of a new birth, without which a person would be \"thrust down into Hell\".[4] In his 1740\u201341 visit to North America (as he had done in England), he attacked other clergy (mostly Anglican) calling them \"God's persecutors\". He said that Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London with supervision over Anglican clergy in America,[69] knew no \"more of Christianity, than Mahaomet, or an Infidel\".[4] After Whitefield preached at St. Philip's Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina, the Commissary, Alexander Garden, suspended him as a \"vagabond clergyman.\" After being suspended, Whitefield attacked all South Carolina's Anglican clergy in print. Whitefield issued a blanket indictment of New England's Congregational ministers for their \"lack of zeal\".[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
