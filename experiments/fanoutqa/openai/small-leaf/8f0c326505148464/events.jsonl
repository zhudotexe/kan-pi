Determining the origin of the Amazon River has evoked broad debates among scholars, explorers, and travelers all over the world. Different definitions of a river's source have been used and continue to be used. Generally, four main criteria can be applied to determine the main source of a river: source flow rate, source length, watershed area of the source, and an altitude of its spring.[2] At present, the Amazon River is not considered to have one unique source but a number of headstream areas. These are headwaters of three different Peruvian rivers that can be found in the high Andes: the Marañón, the Apurímac, and the Mantaro.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon River is the largest river in the world in terms of its flow rate. In addition, it is the second longest river, measuring 6,575 km (4,086 mi)[3] from its source to the mouth of the Atlantic Ocean[4] after the Nile River which is considered to be the longest river in the world (see Source of the Nile River), although there is some dispute. About halfway through its length, upstream from the city of Iquitos, Peru, the Amazon divides into the Marañón and Ucayali Rivers. Both of these rivers have been considered the main sources of the Amazon so far. The Marañón has the higher flow rate, while the Ucayali is longer. In the Ucayali basin are the two farthest sources of the Amazon, the Apurímac and Mantaro Rivers.[5]\n\n\nThe Marañón, Mantaro and Apurímac Rivers originate in the high mountain area of the Peruvian Andes at altitudes over 5,000 metres (16,000 ft). All three sources are considered to be the source of the Amazon, but from different points of view. The Marañón can be considered as the main source of the Amazon based on its discharge, but the Ucayali and its tributaries are longer—2,738 kilometres (1,701 mi) compared to 1,415 kilometres (879 mi) of the Marañón.[6][7] The main source of the Amazon River is therefore difficult to determine, so it is correct to talk about several of its source areas.\n\n\n\n## The Marañón River headwaters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Marañón River is formed by the union of the Nupe River (right) and the Lauricocha River (center) at an elevation of 10,882 feet (3,317 m).\nThe source of the Marañón River had been considered the main source of the Amazon River for a number of centuries. This source was determined by a Czech Jesuit priest named Father Samuel Fritz who sailed the Amazon River from its mouth upstream and drew the first map of the Amazon River basin. His map from 1707 shows the Marañón River as larger than the Ucayali River, and thus the main source of the Amazon River. Fritz believed that the Marañón contributed the most water of all the Amazon's tributaries, making it the most important headstream. He pinpointed the source of the Marañón River as Lake Lauricocha in the high Western Andes.[8][9] This lake (10°18′47″S 76°41′46″W﻿ / ﻿10.313°S 76.696°W﻿ / -10.313; -76.696) is located at an altitude of 3,856 metres (12,651 ft). The Lauricocha River issuing from Lake Lauricocha joins the Nupe River 22 kilometres (14 mi) north of the lake near the town of Rondos and the union of the two small rivers forms what is afterwards known as the Marañón River.[10]\n\n\nFritz's claim about the main source of the Amazon River was unchallenged for nearly 200 years. In the late 19th century, an Italian-born Peruvian geographer and scientist Antonio Raimondi proposed that the Nupe River, which he said was a longer and more voluminous river than the Lauricocha River, is the main head stream.[11][12] The Nupe River has its origin in a system of small lakes near one of the highest peaks of the Huayhuash Range called Siula Grande. The uppermost lake 4,351 metres (14,275 ft) is called Quesillococha (10°16′55″S 76°52′08″W﻿ / ﻿10.282°S 76.869°W﻿ / -10.282; -76.869).[13]\n\n\nHalf a century later, in 1952, two Englishmen, Sebastian Snow and John Brown, identified a small glacial lake called Niñococha, as the source of the Amazon River. The stream from this lake, located in the Raura mountain range, flows down through the Raura silver mine to Lake Lauricocha. Afterwards, Snow went down the Amazon River all the way to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean.[14] Lake Niñococha (10°27′29″S 76°45′50″W﻿ / ﻿10.458°S 76.764°W﻿ / -10.458; -76.764) is located at an altitude of 4,964 metres (16,286 ft).[15]\n\n\n\n## The Apurímac River headwaters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Climate station in the Amazon River headwaters near Nevado Mismi at the altitude of 5.280 m a.s.l.\nIn the 1930s attention turned to the headwaters of the Apurímac River. In 1935, Lake Vilafro (15°12′11″S 71°52′48″W﻿ / ﻿15.203°S 71.880°W﻿ / -15.203; -71.880), located at an altitude of 4,674 metres (15,335 ft)[16] was identified as the main source of the Amazon River. In 1969, Carlos Peñaherrera del Aguila, a prominent Peruvian geographer, was the first to label the Carhuasanta River (and the Lloqueta River) flowing down the Mismi Mountain in southern Peru as a possible ultimate source.[17] Two years later the eleven million dollar \"Cousteau Amazon Expedition\" examined the question, culminating in a six-hour television documentary entitled \"Cousteau's Amazon\", which was released in 1983. This expedition was broken into three separate groups and the upper Amazon section was covered by \"The Flying Expedition\" tasked with exploring the upper third from the river's origin on Mt. Mismi. The expedition utilised newly developed satellite imagery, measured by an American cartographic organization to determine the furthest point of flowing water to its meeting the Atlantic Ocean. The Upper Amazon expedition included an Eastern European multi-axled articulated Land Rover, a float plane Papagaiu, for aerial reconnaissance, and the Peruvian Air Force who offered a high elevation helicopter to examine the upper levels of the Chila mountain range and Mt. Mismi.\n\n\nCousteau dispatched a team of German alpinists to summit the 18,000 feet (5,486 m) volcano and during their descent they found melt water dropping into a fissure. This deep cleft in the southern slope of Mismi varied in size from two meters to half a meter wide, angling down the slope. The stream within flowed nearly fifty meters before disappearing, becoming ground water, then emerging lower downstream to continue its course. Within this fissure, the water was deep enough to float a small craft presenting the expedition with an opportunity to navigate the highest and furthest origin of the Amazon. Cousteau brought American, Olympic trained kayaker Caril Ridley to the mountain, who with expedition support ascended the mountain from a small pampas lake, using a Llama train bearing ropes, kayak and equipment, and in June, 1982 became the first person to run the origins of the Amazon.\n\n\nLater expeditions have refined our understanding of the river's many tributaries and meandering flow with its many-disputed origins. The definition of a \"rivers origin\" remains subject of debate by communities, organizations, expeditions and adventurers seeking to claim the prize. But this small lake at the northern foot of Mismi with its high elevation crevasse remains the most likely candidate.\n\n\nA National Geographic Society expedition led by Loren McIntyre identified a small lake 15°30′58″S 71°41′31″W﻿ / ﻿15.516°S 71.692°W﻿ / -15.516; -71.692, 5,319 metres (17,451 ft)[18] on the northern slope of the Mismi Mountain as the main source.[19] This lake, named Lake McIntyre, later incorrectly appeared on some maps as \"Laguna Bohemia\". The real Laguna Bohemia 15°30′43″S 71°42′07″W﻿ / ﻿15.512°S 71.702°W﻿ / -15.512; -71.702, 5,148 metres (16,890 ft)[20] was later identified by a Czech-Peruvian expedition led by Bohumír Janský as one of the main sources of the Amazon.[21]\n\n\nOther expeditions were led to this area. In 1996, Polish-born Jacek Palkiewicz and Peruvian Zaniel I. Novoa Goicochea refuted Lake McIntyre and identified a small spring beneath a cliff in the catchment of the Apacheta River near Nevado Choquecorao 15°31′16″S 71°45′40″W﻿ / ﻿15.521°S 71.761°W﻿ / -15.521; -71.761, 5,182 metres (17,001 ft) [22] as the main source.[23] Their argument was that the Apacheta is larger and longer than the Carhuasanta. However, this argument was later refuted. After the confluence of the Carhuasanta and Apacheta Rivers, the Lloqueta River originates.\n\n\nIn 1999–2000, a Czech scientific team led by Bohumír Janský from the Charles University in Prague, linked to the opinion of Carlos Peñaherrera del Aguila, cooperated with him and named the Carhuasanta River the main source of the Amazon. In 2011 Janský and his team published the results of a years-long project documenting their claim. They described four streams (Carhuasanta, Apacheta, Sillanque and Ccaccansa) forming the Lloqueta River in great detail. Based on these outcomes, the Carhuasanta River is the longest and has the largest drainage area. They identified two sources of the Carhuasanta River, Laguna Bohemia (or Lake Bohemia) and so-called Rocky Spring.[24] In order to monitor the hydrological conditions and have further evidence to support the claim, Janský's team has since installed a number of hydrological and climatic stations in this area. Present research confirms their claim of the Carhuasanta River as the main source of the Amazon in the sense of the highest uninterrupted flow rate. By 2007, all glaciers in the area of Lloqueta River headwaters disappeared as a consequence of ongoing climate change. This fact resulted in a change of local hydrological conditions but the two identified sources remain uninterrupted.[25]\n\n\n\n* ![Map of the Amazon River drainage basin with the Amazon River highlighted](image)\n\nMap of the Amazon River drainage basin with the Amazon River highlighted\n* ![The Apurímac source of the Amazon.](image)\n\nThe Apurímac source of the Amazon.\n* ![Amazon River headwaters map](image)\n\nAmazon River headwaters map\n* ![Carhuasanta Rocky Spring](image)\n\nCarhuasanta Rocky Spring\n* ![Carhuasanta Laguna Bohemia](image)\n\nCarhuasanta Laguna Bohemia\n* ![The cross marks a spring, the headwater of the Apacheta River, one of the two sources of the Amazon on the Apurímac River.](image)\n\nThe cross marks a spring, the headwater of the Apacheta River, one of the two sources of the Amazon on the Apurímac River.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## The Mantaro River headwaters[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, James Contos and Nicholas Tripcevich came up with a finding that the most distant source of the Amazon is called the Mantaro River. They located the most distant spring in the headwaters of Lake Junin in the Rumi Cruz mountains 10°43′55″S 76°38′53″W﻿ / ﻿10.732°S 76.648°W﻿ / -10.732; -76.648, at an elevation of 5,220 metres (17,130 ft). Contos and Tripcevich calculated and compared the length of the Apurímac 734.3 kilometres (456.3 mi) and Mantaro Rivers 809 kilometres (503 mi) and found that the Mantaro River is about 75 kilometres (47 mi) longer. Nevertheless, Contos and Tripcevich acknowledge that the flow of the Mantaro River source is interrupted several months a year and thus a drop of water at its source may not complete the journey to the mouth of the Amazon.[26]\n\n\n\n## Headstream areas of the Amazon River[edit]\n\n\nTraditionally, many geographers and explorers have defined a source as the most distant point upstream that provides the largest volume of water to a river. However, this criterion is not easy to employ in the case of most of the world's largest rivers. Depending on which definition or interpretation is preferred, there can certainly be a couple of different answers for the source of a given river.\nThus, a number of headstream areas of the Amazon River should be considered: \n\n\n\n1. the Marañon River (the Lauricocha and Nupe Rivers) in a historical context;\n2. the Mantaro River with the most distant but semi-permanent spring;\n3. the Apurímac River (the Carhuasanta River) with the most distant source of uninterrupted flow.\n\n\n\n\nHistory of claims and hypotheses concerning the Amazon River headwaters\n| Author | Year | Source\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| S.J.

The Yenisey divides the Western Siberian Plain in the west from the Central Siberian Plateau to the east; it drains a large part of central Siberia.\n\n\nIt is the central one of three large Siberian rivers that flow into the Arctic Ocean (the other two being the Ob and the Lena). The maximum depth of the Yenisey is 61 metres (200 ft) and the average depth is 14 metres (45 ft).\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map including the Yenisey River\nThe Yenisey proper, from the confluence of its source rivers Great Yenisey and Little Yenisey at Kyzyl to its mouth in the Kara Sea, is 3,487 km (2,167 mi) long. From the source of its tributary Selenga, it is 5,075 km (3,153 mi) long.[10] It has a drainage basin of 2,580,000 km2 (1,000,000 sq mi).[11] The Yenisey flows through the Russian federal subjects Tuva, Khakassia[*citation needed*] and Krasnoyarsk Krai. The city of Krasnoyarsk is situated on the Yenisey.[12]\n\n\n\n### Tributaries[edit]\n\n\nThe largest tributaries of the Yenisey are, from source to mouth:[11][13]\n\n\n\n* Little Yenisey (left)\n* Great Yenisey (right)\n* Khemchik (left)\n* Kantegir (left)\n* Abakan (left)\n* Tuba (right)\n* Mana (right)\n* Bazaikha (right)\n* Kacha (left)\n* Kan (right)\n* Angara (right)\n* Kem (left)\n* Bolshoy Pit (right)\n* Sym (left)\n* Dubches (left)\n* Podkamennaya Tunguska (right)\n* Bakhta (right)\n* Yeloguy (left)\n* Nizhnyaya Tunguska (right)\n* Turukhan (left)\n* Kureyka (right)\n* Khantayka (right)\n* Bolshaya Kheta (left)\n* Tanama (left)\n\n## Lake Baikal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lake Baikal\n\nA significant feature of the Upper Yenisei is Lake Baikal, the deepest and oldest lake in the world.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)The river flowing through the Shushensky Forest\n## Brekhovskie Islands[edit]\n\n\nThe Brekhovskie Islands (Russian-language article: *Бреховские острова*) lie in the Yenisey estuary and have an area of some 1,400,000 hectares. They provide a wetland habitat for rare and endangered birds and are an internationally important nesting and breeding area for several types of waterfowl.[15] The most north-easterly of the islands, Nosonovskij Ostrov (\"Nose Island\") was visited by Fridtjof Nansen in 1913.[16]\n\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nThe Yenisey basin (excluding Lake Baikal and lakes of the Khantayka headwaters) is home to 55 native fish species, including two endemics: *Gobio sibiricus* (a gobionine cyprinid) and *Thymallus nigrescens* (a grayling).[17] The grayling is restricted to Khövsgöl Nuur and its tributaries.[17] Most fish found in the Yenisey basin are relatively widespread Euro-Siberian or Siberian species, such as northern pike (*Esox lucius*), common roach (*Rutilus rutilus*), common dace (*Leuciscus leuciscus*), Siberian sculpin (*Cottus poecilopus*), European perch (*Perca fluviatilis*) and Prussian carp (*Carassius gibelio*). The basin is also home to many salmonids (trout, whitefish, charr, graylings, taimen and relatives) and the Siberian sturgeon (*Acipenser baerii*).[17]\n\n\nThe Yenisey valley is habitat for numerous flora and fauna, with Siberian pine and Siberian larch being notable tree species. In prehistoric times Scots pine, *Pinus sylvestris*, was abundant in the Yenisey valley c. 6000 BC.[18] There are also numerous bird species present in the watershed, including, for example, the hooded crow, *Corvus cornix*.[19]\n\n\n\n### Taimyr reindeer herd[edit]\n\n\nThe Taimyr herd of tundra reindeer (*Rangifer tarandus* *sibiricus*), the largest reindeer herd in the world,[20][21] migrates to winter grazing ranges along the Yenisey.[22]: 336 It had an estimated 800,000-850,000 individuals as of 2010, but has peaked at over one million.[23]\n\n\n\n## Navigation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Inclined plane at Krasnoyarsk Dam\nRiver steamers first came to the Yenisey River in 1864 and were brought in from Holland and England across the icy Kara Sea. One was the SS Nikolai. The SS Thames attempted to explore the river, overwintered in 1876, but was damaged in the ice and eventually wrecked in the river. Success came with the steamers Frazer, Express in 1878, and the next year, Moscow hauling supplies in and wheat out. The Dalman reached Yeniseisk in 1881.\n\n\nImperial Russia placed river steamers on the massive river in an attempt to free up communication with land-locked Siberia. One boat was the SS St. Nicholas which took the future Tsar Nicholas II on his voyage to Siberia, and later conveyed Vladimir Lenin to prison.\n\n\nEngineers attempted to place river steamers in regular service on the river during the building of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The boats were needed to bring in the rails, engines and supplies. Captain Joseph Wiggins sailed the Orestes with rail in 1893. However, the sea and river route proved very difficult with several ships lost at sea and on the river. Both the Ob and Yenisey mouths feed into very long inlets, several hundred kilometres in length, which are shallow, ice bound and prone to high winds and thus treacherous for navigation. After the completion of the railway, river traffic reduced only to local service as the Arctic route and long river proved much too indirect a route.\n\n\nThe first recreation team to navigate the Yenisey's entire length, including its violent upper tributary in Mongolia, was an Australian-Canadian effort completed in September 2001. Ben Kozel, Tim Cope, Colin Angus and Remy Quinter were on this team. Both Kozel and Angus wrote books detailing this expedition,[24] and a documentary was produced for National Geographic Television.\n\n\nA canal inclined plane was built on the river in 1985 at the Krasnoyarsk Dam.[25]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nNomadic tribes such as the Ket people and the Yugh people have lived along the banks of the Yenisey since ancient times, and this region is the location of the Yeniseian language family. The Ket, numbering about 1000, are the only survivors today of those who originally lived throughout central southern Siberia near the river banks. Their extinct relatives included the Kotts, Assans, Arins, Baikots and Pumpokols who lived further upriver to the south. The modern Ket lived in the eastern middle areas of the river before being assimilated politically into Russia during the 17th through 19th centuries.[26]\n\n\nSome of the earliest known evidence of Turkic origins was found in the Yenisey Valley in the form of stelae, stone monoliths and memorial tablets dating from between the seventh and ninth centuries AD, along with some documents that were found in China's Xinjiang region. The written evidence gathered from these sources tells of battles fought between the Turks and the Chinese and other legends. There are also examples of Uyghur poetry, though most have survived only in Chinese translation.[27]\n\n\nWheat from the Yenisey was sold by Muslims and Uighurs during inadequate harvests to Bukhara and Soghd during the Tahirid era.[28]\n\n\nRussians first reached the upper Yenisey in 1605, travelling from the Ob, up the Ket, portaging and then down the Yenisey as far as the Sym.[29]\n\n\nDuring World War II, Nazi Germany and the Japanese Empire agreed to divide Asia along a line that followed the Yenisey to the border of China and then along the border of China and the Soviet Union.[30]\n\n\n\n## Pollution[edit]\n\n\nStudies have shown that the Yenisey suffers from contamination caused by radioactive discharges from a factory that produced bomb-grade plutonium in the secret city of Krasnoyarsk-26, now known as Zheleznogorsk.[31]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![The bridge over the Yenisey in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, viewed from the left bank.](image)\n\nThe bridge over the Yenisey in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, viewed from the left bank.\n* ![Vinogradovsky Most, the bridge in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, viewed from the left bank.](image)\n\nVinogradovsky Most, the bridge in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, viewed from the left bank.\n* ![The Yenisey (left) and the Ob flow into Kara Sea (south at top in this view).](image)\n\nThe Yenisey (left) and the Ob flow into Kara Sea (south at top in this view).\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Siberia portal\n\n\n* List of rivers of Russia\n* Sayano-Shushenskaya Dam\n* Yenisey Range\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Mongolian: Горлог мөрөн, *Gorlog mörön*, pronounced [ˈɢɔrɮɜ̆q ˈmɵrʉ̆ŋ]; Buryat: Горлог мүрэн, *Gorlog müren*; Tuvan: Улуг-Хем, *Ulug-Hem*; Khakas: *Ким суғ*, *Kim suğ*\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Прокофьев, Александр Андреевич (30 August 1990). *Избранное : стихотворения, поэмы*. \"Худож. лит-ра\", Ленинградское отд-ние.

For millennia, travelers crossed the river by ferry. On occasions, the crossing may have been dangerous, as evidenced by the *Zhong'anlun* disaster (October 15, 1945).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe origin of the Yangtze River has been dated by some geologists to about 45 million years ago in the Eocene,[47] but this dating has been disputed.

From Yibin to Yichang, the river through Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality is also known as the *Chuān Jiāng* (川江) or \"Sichuan River.\" In Hubei, the river is also called the *Jīng Jiāng* (荆江; 荊江) or the \"Jing River\" after Jingzhou, one of the Nine Provinces of ancient China. In Anhui, the river takes on the local name *Wǎn Jiāng* after the shorthand name for Anhui, *wǎn* (皖). And *Yángzǐ Jiāng* (揚子江; 扬子江) or the \"Yangzi River\", from which the English name Yangtze is derived, is the local name for the Lower Yangtze in the region of Yangzhou. The name likely comes from an ancient ferry crossing called *Yángzǐ* or *Yángzǐjīn* (揚子 / 揚子津).[19] Europeans who arrived in the Yangtze River Delta region applied this local name to the whole river.[14] The dividing site between upstream and midstream is considered to be at Yichang and that between midstream and downstream at Hukou (Jiujiang).[20]\n\n\n\n### English[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Three Gorges Dam in 2006\n![](image)Diagram showing dams planned for the upper reaches of the Yangtze River\nAs of 2007, there are two dams built on the Yangtze river: Three Gorges Dam and Gezhouba Dam. The Three Gorges Dam is the largest power station in the world by installed capacity, at 22.5 GW. Several dams are operating or are being constructed on the upper portion of the river, the Jinsha River. Among them, the Xiluodu Dam is the third largest power station in the world, and the Baihetan Dam, planned to be commissioned in 2021, will be the second largest after the Three Gorges Dam.\n\n\n\n## Tributaries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A shipyard on the banks of the Yangtze building commercial river freight boats\nThe Yangtze River has over 700 tributaries. The major tributaries (listed from upstream to downstream) with the locations of where they join the Yangtze are:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese tributaries join and the river then runs eastward through Qinghai (Tsinghai), turning southward down a deep valley at the border of Sichuan (Szechwan) and Tibet to reach Yunnan. In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above 5,000 m (16,000 ft) to less than 1,000 m (3,300 ft). Thus, over the first 2,600 km (1,600 mi) of its length, the river has fallen more than 5,200 m (17,000 ft).[46]\n\n\nIt enters the basin of Sichuan at Yibin. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several mighty tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly.

In recent years, the river has suffered from industrial pollution, plastic pollution,[13] agricultural runoff, siltation, and loss of wetland and lakes, which exacerbates seasonal flooding.

It rises at Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and flows 6,300 km (3,915 mi) in a generally easterly direction to the East China Sea.[8] It is the fifth-largest primary river by discharge volume in the world. Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of the land area of China, and is home to nearly one-third of the country's population.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** Richardson, N.J.; Densmore, A.L.; Seward, D.

The largest of these lakes is Dongting Lake, which is located on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At Wuhan, it receives its biggest tributary, the Han River, bringing water from its northern basin as far as Shaanxi.\n\n\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi province, Lake Poyang, the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through Anhui and Jiangsu, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the East China Sea at Shanghai.\n\n\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River.

Winter winds blow south, up river, so ships could sail up river using sails and down river using the flow of the river. While most Egyptians still live in the Nile valley, the 1970 completion of the Aswan Dam ended the summer floods and their renewal of the fertile soil, fundamentally changing farming practices. The Nile supports much of the population living along its banks, enabling Egyptians to live in otherwise inhospitable regions of the Sahara. The river's flow is disturbed at several points by the Cataracts of the Nile which form an obstacle to navigation by boats. The Sudd also forms a formidable navigation obstacle and impedes water flow, to the extent that Sudan had once attempted to build the Jonglei Canal to bypass the swamp.[81][82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe English name *Nile* and the Arabic names *en-Nîl* and *an-Nîl* both derive from the Latin **Nilus** and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος.[18][19] Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed.[19][20] Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, *Aiguptos*, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as *Neilos*; this term became generalised for the entire river system.[21] Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression *n*ꜣ *r*ꜣ*w-ḥ*ꜣ*w(t)* (lit. 'the mouths of the front parts'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced *ni-lo-he* in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE.[21] Hesiod at his *Theogony* refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the Potamoi (river gods), son of Oceanus and Tethys.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** \"Bridging the Gap in the Nile Waters Dispute\". *Crisis Group*. 20 March 2019.

It flows over six groups of cataracts, from the sixth at Sabaloka just north of Khartoum northward to Abu Hamad. The tectonic uplift of the Nubian Swell diverts the river south-west for over 300 km, following the structure of the Central African Shear Zone embracing the Bayuda Desert. At Al Dabbah it resumes its northward course towards the first cataract at Aswan forming the 'S'-shaped Great Bend of the Nile[40] mentioned by Eratosthenes.[41]\n\n\nIn the north of Sudan, the river enters Lake Nasser (known in Sudan as Lake Nubia), the larger part of which is in Egypt.\n\n\n\n### In Egypt[edit]\n\n\nBelow the Aswan Dam, at the northern limit of Lake Nasser, the Nile resumes its historic course.

This is how the Nile river looked to Arabs when they first discovered it looking at the river from distance as an indigo snake in the yellow background of desert.[15][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Nile has two major tributaries – the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream. However, the Blue Nile is the source of most of the water of the Nile downstream, containing 80% of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia[11] and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNotes\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** The length of the Nile is usually said to be about 6,650 km (4,130 mi),[3] but reported values lie anywhere between 5,499 km (3,417 mi) and 7,088 km (4,404 mi).[4] The measurements of many rivers' lengths are only approximations and may differ from each other because there are many factors that determine the calculated length of a river, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the technique used to measure length (see also List of rivers by length).[4][8]\n2. **^** Arabic: النيل, romanized: *an-Nīl*, Arabic pronunciation: [an'niːl], Bohairic Coptic: ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ Coptic pronunciation: [pʰjaˈro],[1] Luganda: *Kiira* Luganda pronunciation: [ki:ra], Nobiin: Áman Dawū[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)John Hanning Speke c. 1863.

Vitruvius thought that source of the Nile is in Mauritania, on the \"other\" (south) side of the Atlas Mountains.[70] Various expeditions failed to determine the river's source. Agatharchides records that in the time of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, a military expedition had penetrated far enough along the course of the Blue Nile to determine that the summer floods were caused by heavy seasonal rainstorms in the Ethiopian Highlands, but no European of antiquity is known to have reached Lake Tana.

The drainage basin of the Nile covers 3,254,555 square kilometers (1,256,591 sq mi), about 10% of the area of Africa.[28] Compared to other major rivers, though, the Nile carries little water (5% of that of the Congo River, for example).[29] The Nile basin is complex, and because of this, the discharge at any given point along the main stem depends on many factors including weather, diversions, evaporation and evapotranspiration, and groundwater flow.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Reconstruction of the Oikoumene (inhabited world), an ancient map based on Herodotus' description of the world, circa 450 BC\nThe Nile has been the lifeline of civilization in Egypt since the Stone Age, with most of the population and all of the cities of Egypt developing along those parts of the Nile valley lying north of Aswan. However, the Nile used to run much more westerly through what is now Wadi Hamim and Wadi al Maqar in Libya and flow into the Gulf of Sidra.[52] As the sea level rose at the end of the most recent ice age, the stream which is now the northern Nile captured the ancestral Nile near Asyut.[53] This change in climate also led to the current extents of the Sahara desert, around 3400 BCE.[54]\n\n\n\n### Khufu branch[edit]\n\n\nThe Giza pyramid complex originally overlooked a branch of the Nile that no longer exists. This branch was highest during the African Humid Period.[55][56]\n\n\n\n### Ancient Niles[edit]\n\n\nThe existing Nile has five earlier phases;\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the late-Miocene Messinian salinity crisis, when the Mediterranean Sea was a closed basin and evaporated to the point of being empty or nearly so, the Nile cut its course down to the new base level until it was several hundred metres below world ocean level at Aswan and 2,400 m (7,900 ft) below Cairo.[59][60] This created a very long and deep canyon which was filled with sediment after the Mediterranean was recreated.[61] At some point the sediments raised the riverbed sufficiently for the river to overflow westward into a depression to create Lake Moeris.\n\n\nLake Tanganyika drained northwards into the Nile until the Virunga Volcanoes blocked its course in Rwanda. The Nile was much longer at that time, with its furthest headwaters in northern Zambia. The currently existing Nile first flowed during the former parts of the Würm glaciation period.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called *Ḥꜥpy* (Hapy) or *Jtrw* (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced *piaro* (Sahidic) or *phiaro* (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the.canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name.[17] In Nobiin the river is called *Áman Dawū*, meaning \"the great water\".[2] In Luganda the river is called *Kiira* or *Kiyira*. In Runyoro it is called *Kihiira*. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called *en-Nīl*, while in Standard Arabic it is called *an-Nīl*. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר‎, *Ha-Ye'or* or הַשִׁיחוֹר‎, *Ha-Shiḥor*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** Marshall et al.,\"Late Pleistocene and Holocene environmental and climatic change from Lake Tana, source of the Blue Nile\" (PDF).

The most remote source that is indisputably a source for the White Nile is the Kagera River; however, the Kagera has tributaries that are in contention for the farthest source of the White Nile. Two start in Burundi: the Ruvyironza River (also known as the Luvironza) and the Rurubu River.[34][33] In addition, in 2010, an exploration party in Rwanda[35] went to a place described as the source of the Rukarara tributary,[36] and by hacking a path up steep jungle-choked mountain slopes in the Nyungwe Forest found (in the dry season) an appreciable incoming surface flow for many kilometres upstream, and found a new source, giving the Nile a length of 6,758 km (4,199 mi).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### In Uganda[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n81. **^** Shahin, Mamdouh (2002). *Hydrology and Water Resources of Africa*.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa and has historically been considered the longest river in the world,[3][4] though this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.[5][6] Of the world's major rivers, the Nile is one of the smallest, as measured by annual flow in cubic metres of water.[7] About 6,650 km (4,130 mi)[a] long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan, and Egypt.[9] In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.[10] Additionally, the Nile is an important economic river, supporting agriculture and fishing.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1951, American John Goddard together with two French explorers became the first to successfully navigate the entire Nile from its source in Burundi at the potential headsprings of the Kagera River in Burundi to its mouth on the Mediterranean Sea, a journey of approximately 6,800 km (4,200 mi). Their 9-month journey is described in the book *Kayaks down the Nile*.[90]\n\n\nThe White Nile Expedition, led by South African national Hendrik Coetzee, navigated the White Nile's entire length of approximately 3,700 kilometres (2,300 mi). The expedition began at the White Nile's beginning at Lake Victoria in Uganda, on 17 January 2004 and arrived at the Mediterranean in Rosetta, four and a half months later.[91]\n\n\n\n### Blue Nile[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n64. **^** Williams, M.A.J.; Williams, F.
