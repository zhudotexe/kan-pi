Her childhood was deeply affected by her father's alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction, which contributed to her parents' strained marriage. Rihanna's father used to abuse her mother physically, and Rihanna would try to get in between them to break up fights.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Walker, Tim (October 31, 2011). \"Rihanna: Out for revenge\". *The Independent*.
