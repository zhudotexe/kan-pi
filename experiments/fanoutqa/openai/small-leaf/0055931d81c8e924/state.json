Three million copies of the book were sold over the first weekend in the US alone.[5] FedEx dispatched more than 9,000 trucks and 100 planes to fulfil book deliveries.[6] The pressure in editing caused a mistake which shows Harry's father emerging first from Voldemort's wand; however, as confirmed in *Prisoner of Azkaban*, James died first, so then Harry's mother ought to have come out first.[7] This was corrected in later editions.[8]\n\n\n\n#### Launch publicity[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Harry Potter* | * *The Philosopher's Stone* (1997)\n* *The Chamber of Secrets* (1998)\n* *The Prisoner of Azkaban* (1999)\n* *The Goblet of Fire* (2000)\n* *The Order of the Phoenix* (2003)\n* *The Half-Blood Prince* (2005)\n* *The Deathly Hallows* (2007)\n |\n| Other | * *Quidditch Through the Ages* (2001)\n* *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them* (2001)\n* Harry Potter prequel (2008)\n* *The Tales of Beedle the Bard* (2008)\n* *Hogwarts: An Incomplete and Unreliable Guide* (2016)\n* *Short Stories from Hogwarts of Power, Politics and Pesky Poltergeists* (2016)\n* *Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies* (2016)\n |\n\n |\n| *Cormoran Strike*books | * *The Cuckoo's Calling* (2013)\n* *The Silkworm* (2014)\n* *Career of Evil* (2015)\n* *Lethal White* (2018)\n* *Troubled Blood* (2020)\n* *The Ink Black Heart* (2022)\n* *The Running Grave* (2023)\n |\n| Films andTV series | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Lemmerman, Kristin (14 July 2000). \"Review: Gladly drinking from Rowling's 'Goblet of Fire'\".
