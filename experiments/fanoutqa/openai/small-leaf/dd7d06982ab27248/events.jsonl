He received the 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of the fresh originality and true inspiration of his poetic production, which faithfully reflects the natural scenery and native spirit of his people, and, in addition, his significant work as a Provençal philologist\". Mistral was a founding member of the Félibrige and member of the Académie de Marseille.\n\n\nHis name in his native language was Frederi Mistral (Mistrau) according to the Mistralian orthography or Frederic Mistral (or Mistrau) according to the classical orthography.\n\n\nMistral's fame was owing in part to Alphonse de Lamartine who sang his praises in the 40th edition of his periodical *Cours familier de littérature*, following the publication of Mistral's long poem *Mirèio*. Alphonse Daudet, with whom he maintained a long friendship, eulogized him in \"Poet Mistral\", one of the stories in his collection *Letters from My Windmill* (*Lettres de mon moulin*).\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Frédéric Mistral in Arles\nMistral was born in Maillane in the Bouches-du-Rhône department in Southern France.[1] His parents were wealthy landed farmers.[1] His father, François Mistral, was from Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.[1] His mother was Adelaide Poulinet. As early as 1471, his paternal ancestor, Mermet Mistral, lived in Maillane.[1] By 1588, the Mistral family lived in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.[1]\n\n\nMistral was given the Provençal name \"Frederi\" in memory \"of a poor small fellow who, at the time when my parents were courting, sweetly ran their errands of love, and who died shortly afterward of sunstroke.\"[2] Mistral did not begin school until he was about nine years old, and quickly began to play truant, leading his parents to send him to a boarding school in Saint-Michel-de-Frigolet, run by a Monsieur Donnat.\n\n\nAfter receiving his bachelor's degree in Nîmes, Mistral studied law in Aix-en-Provence from 1848 to 1851. He became a champion for the independence of Provence, and in particular for restoring the \"first literary language of civilized Europe\"—Provençal. He had studied the history of Provence during his time in Aix-en-Provence. Emancipated by his father, Mistral resolved: \"to raise, revive in Provence the feeling of race ...; to move this rebirth by the restoration of the natural and historical language of the country ...; to restore the fashion to Provence by the breath and flame of divine poetry\". For Mistral, the word race designates \"people linked by language, rooted in a country and in a story\".\n\n\nFor his lifelong efforts in restoring the language of Provence, Frédéric Mistral was one of the recipients of the 1904 Nobel Prize for Literature after having been nominated by two professors from the Swedish Uppsala University.[3][4] The other winner that year, José Echegaray, was honored for his Spanish dramas. They shared the prize money equally.[5] Mistral devoted his half to the creation of the Museum at Arles, known locally as \"Museon Arlaten\". The museum is considered to be the most important collection of Provençal folk art, displaying furniture, costumes, ceramics, tools and farming implements. In addition, Mistral was awarded the Légion d'honneur. This was a most unusual occurrence since it is usually only awarded for notable achievement on a national level, whereas Mistral was uniquely Provençal in his work and achievement.\n\n\nIn 1876, Mistral married a Burgundian woman, Marie-Louise Rivière (1857–1943) in Dijon Cathedral *(Cathédrale Saint-Bénigne de Dijon)*. They had no children. Mistral died on 25 March 1914 in Maillane, the same village where he was born.\n\n\n\n## Félibrige[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Plaque on the *rue* Louis Pasteur in Avignon where Joseph Roumanille taught such brilliant future poets as Anselme Matthieu and Frédéric Mistral\nMistral joined forces with one of his teachers, Joseph Roumanille, and five other Provençal poets and on 21 May 1854, they founded Félibrige, a literary and cultural association, which made it possible to promote the Occitan language. Placed under the patronage of Saint Estelle, the movement also welcomed Catalan poets from Spain, driven out by Isabelle II.\n\n\nThe seven founders of the organization were (to use their Provençal names): Jóusè Roumaniho, Frederi Mistral, Teodor Aubanel, Ansèume Matiéu, Jan Brunet, Anfos Tavan and Paul Giera. Félibrige exists to this day, one of the few remaining cultural organizations in 32 departments of the \"Langue d'Oc\".\n\n\nMistral strove to rehabilitate the language of Provence, while carrying it to the highest summits of epic poetry. He redefined the language in its purest form by creating a dictionary and transcribing the songs of the troubadours, who spoke the language in its original form.\n\n\n\n## Lexicography: *Lou Tresor dóu Felibrige*[edit]\n\n\nMistral is the author of *Lou Tresor dóu Félibrige* (1878–1886), which to date remains the most comprehensive dictionary of the Occitan language, and one of the most reliable, thanks to the precision of its definitions. It is a bilingual dictionary, Occitan-French, in two large volumes, with all of the dialects of *oc*, including Provençal. Mistral owes to François Vidal the work of typesetting and revising that dictionary.\n\n\n\n## *Mirèio* – *Mireille*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mistral during his career.\nMistral's most important work is *Mirèio* (*Mireille*), published in 1859, after eight years of effort. *Mirèio*, a long poem in Provençal consisting of twelve songs, tells of the thwarted love of Vincent and Mireille, two young Provençal people of different social backgrounds. The name Mireille (Mirèio in Provence) is a doublet of the word *meraviho* which means wonder.\n\n\nMistral used the occasion not only to promote his language but also to share the culture of an area. Among other tales, he tells of Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, where according to legend the dragon Tarasque was driven out, and of the famous and ancient Venus of Arles. He prefaced the poem with a short notice about Provençal pronunciation.\n\n\nThe poem tells how Mireille's parents wish her to marry a Provençal landowner, but she falls in love with a poor basket maker named Vincent, who loves her as well. After rejecting three rich suitors, a desperate Mireille, driven by the refusal of her parents to let her marry Vincent, runs off to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer to pray to the patrons of Provence to change her parents' minds. Having forgotten to bring a hat, she falls victim to the heat, dying in Vincent's arms under the gaze of her parents.\n\n\nMistral dedicated his book to Alphonse de Lamartine as follows:\n\n\n\"To Lamartine:\n\n\nTo you, I dedicate Mireille:\nIt is my heart and my soul;\nIt is the flower of my years;\nIt is bunch of grapes from La Crau, leaves and all, a peasant's offering.\"\n\n\nLamartine wrote enthusiastically: \"I will tell you good news today! A great epic poet is born ... A true Homeric poet in our time; ... Yes, your epic poem is a masterpiece; ... the perfume of your book will not evaporate in a thousand years.\"\n\n\n*Mirèio* was translated into some fifteen European languages, including into French by Mistral himself. In 1863, Charles Gounod made it into an opera, *Mireille*.\n\n\n\n## Quotations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Relief of Mistral by Jean Barnabé Amy\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

He was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of the numerous and brilliant compositions which, in an individual and original manner, have revived the great traditions of the Spanish drama\".\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHe was born in Madrid on 19 April 1832.[2] His father, a doctor and institute professor of Greek,[3] was from Aragon and his mother was from Navarra. He spent his childhood in Murcia, where he finished his elementary school education. It was there, at the Murcia Institute, where he first gained his love for mathematics. While still a child he read Goethe, Homer, and Balzac, readings that alternated with those of mathematicians like Gauss, Legendre, and Lagrange.\n\n\nIn order to earn enough money to attend the *Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería de Caminos, Canales y Puertos* (Engineering School of Roads, Channels and Ports), he moved at the age of fourteen to Madrid.[4] At the age of twenty, he left the Madrid School with a Civil Engineering degree, which he had obtained as first in his class, and he had to move to Almeria and Granada to begin working at his first job.[5]\n\n\n\n## Professor and scientist[edit]\n\n\nIn 1854 he began teaching a class at the Engineering School, working as a secretary there also. He taught mathematics, stereotomy, hydraulics, descriptive geometry, and differential and physical calculus from that year until 1868. From 1858 to 1860 he was also a professor at the Assistants' School of Public Works.\n\n\nHis *Problemas de geometría analítica* (1865) and *Teorías modernas de la física. Unidad de las fuerzas materiales* (1867) were held in some regard. He became a member of the Society of Political Economy, helped to found the magazine *La Revista*, and took a prominent part in propagating free trade doctrines in the press and on the platform.[5]\n\n\nHe was clearly marked out for office, and when the revolution of 1868 overthrew the monarchy, he resigned his post for a place in the revolutionary cabinet.[5]\n\n\n\n## Government service[edit]\n\n\nEchegaray also entered politics later in his life. As a founding member of the republican Radical Democratic Party,[6] he enjoyed a career in the government sector, being appointed Minister of Education, of Public Works and Finance Minister successively between 1867 and 1874.[3] He retired from politics after the Bourbon restoration in 1874.[5]\n\n\n\n## Literary career[edit]\n\n\nTheater had always been the love of José Echegaray's life. Although he had written earlier plays (*La Hija natural* and *La Última Noche*, both in 1867), he truly became a dramatist in 1874.[5] His plays reflected his sense of duty, which had made him famous during his time in the governmental offices. Dilemmas centered on duty and morality are the motif of his plays. He replicated the achievements of his predecessors of the Spanish Golden Age, remaining a prolific playwright.\n\n\nHis most famous play is *El gran Galeoto*, a drama written in the grand nineteenth century manner of melodrama. It is about the poisonous effect that unfounded gossip has on a middle-aged man's happiness. Echegaray filled it with elaborate stage instructions that illuminate what we would now consider a hammy style of acting popular in the 19th century. Paramount Pictures filmed it as a silent with the title changed to *The World and His Wife*, and it was the basis for a later film The Great Galeoto. His most remarkable plays[*citation needed*] are *O locura o santidad* (Saint or Madman?, 1877); *Mariana* (1892); *El estigma* (1895); *La duda*, 1898; and *El loco Dios* (God, the fool, 1900).\n\n\nAmong his other famous plays are *La esposa del vengador* (1874) (The Avenger's Wife); *En el puño de la espada* (1875) (In the Sword's Handle); *En el pilar y en la cruz* (1878) (On the Stake and on the Cross); and *Conflicto entre dos deberes* (1882) (Conflict of Two Duties).[3]\n\n\nAlong with the Provençal poet Frédéric Mistral, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1904, after having been nominated that year by a member of the Royal Spanish Academy, making him the first Spaniard to win the prize.[7]\n\n\n\n![](image)José Echegaray\nJosé Echegaray maintained constant activity until his death on 14 September 1916 in Madrid.[2] His extensive work did not stop growing in his old age: in the final stage of his life he wrote 25 or 30 mathematical physics volumes. At the age of 83 he commented: \n\n\n> I cannot die, because if I am going to write my mathematical physics encyclopedia, I need at least 25 more years.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\nSeveral streets in Spain are named after José Echegaray. *Calle Echegaray* in Madrid's *Barrio de las Letras* is especially noteworthy.[8][9] In 1971 the Bank of Spain issued a 1000-peseta banknote in his honor.[10]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Burell was elected for the position in 1916 but never took the seat\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"José Echegaray y Eizaguirre - Spanish dramatist\". *Britannica.com*.

He was the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901.\n\n\nBorn in Paris, Prudhomme originally studied to be an engineer, but turned to philosophy and later to poetry; he declared it as his intention to create scientific poetry for modern times. In character sincere and melancholic, he was linked to the Parnassus school, although, at the same time, his work displays characteristics of its own.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nPrudhomme was born to a French shopkeeper.[1]\n\n\nPrudhomme attended the Lycée Bonaparte, but eye trouble interrupted his studies. He worked for a while in the Creusot region for the Schneider steel foundry, and then began studying law in a notary's office. The favourable reception of his early poems by the *Conférence La Bruyère* (a student society) encouraged him to begin a literary career.\n\n\n\n## Writing[edit]\n\n\nHis first collection, *Stances et Poèmes* (\"Stanzas and Poems\", 1865), was praised by Sainte-Beuve. It included his most famous poem, *Le vase brisé*. He published more poetry before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. This war, which he discussed in *Impressions de la guerre* (1872) and *La France* (1874), permanently damaged his health.\n\n\nDuring his career, Prudhomme gradually shifted from the sentimental style of his first books towards a more personal style which unified the formality of the Parnassus school with his interest in philosophical and scientific subjects. One of his inspirations was clearly Lucretius's *De rerum natura*, whose first book he translated into verse. His philosophy was expressed in *La Justice* (1878) and *Le Bonheur* (1888). The extreme economy of means employed in these poems has, however, usually been judged as compromising their poetical quality without advancing their claims as works of philosophy. He was elected to the Académie française in 1881. Another distinction, *Chevalier de la Légion d’honneur*, was to follow in 1895.\n\n\nAfter *Le Bonheur*, Prudhomme turned from poetry to write essays on aesthetics and philosophy. He published two important essays: *L'Expression dans les beaux-arts* (1884) and *Réflexions sur l'art des vers* (1892), a series of articles on Blaise Pascal in *La Revue des Deux Mondes* (1890), and an article on free will (*La Psychologie du Libre-Arbitre*, 1906) in the *Revue de métaphysique et de morale*.\n\n\n\n## Nobel Prize[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1901 Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nThe first writer to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature (given \"in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of lofty idealism, artistic perfection and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect\"), he devoted the bulk of the money he received to the creation of a poetry prize awarded by the *Société des gens de lettres*. He also founded, in 1902, the *Société des poètes français* with Jose-Maria de Heredia and Leon Dierx.\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Grave of Sully Prudhomme at Père-Lachaise in Paris.\nAt the end of his life, his poor health (which had troubled him ever since 1870) forced him to live almost as a recluse at Châtenay-Malabry, suffering attacks of paralysis while continuing to work on essays. He died suddenly on 6 September 1907, and was buried at Père-Lachaise in Paris.\n\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n### Poetry[edit]\n\n\n* 1865: *Stances et poèmes*\n* 1866: *Les épreuves*\n* 1868: *Croquis italiens*\n* 1869: *Les solitudes: poésies* [*Les écuries d’Augias*]\n* 1872: *Les destins*\n* 1874: *La révolte des fleurs*\n* 1874: *La France*\n* 1875: *Les vaines tendresses*\n* 1876: *Le zénith*, previously published in *Revue des deux mondes*\n* 1878: *La justice*\n* 1865–1888: *Poésie*\n* 1886: *Le prisme, poésies diverses*\n* 1888: *Le bonheur*\n* 1908: *Épaves*\n\n\n### Prose[edit]\n\n\n* 1883–1908: *Œuvres de Sully Prudhomme* (poetry and prose), 8 volumes, A.

Their oldest daughter Maria married Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, the great Classics scholar. Their grandson Theodor Ernst Mommsen (1905–1958) became a professor of medieval history in the United States. Two of the great-grandsons, Hans Mommsen and Wolfgang Mommsen, were German historians.\n\n\n\n## Mommsen as editor and organiser[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Theodor Mommsen in 1881\nWhile he was secretary of the Historical-Philological Class at the Berlin Academy (1874–1895), Mommsen organised countless scientific projects, mostly editions of original sources.\n\n\n\n### *Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGerman classical scholar and historian (1817–1903)\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

His birthplace Garding in the west of Schleswig styles itself \"Mommsen-Stadt Garding\".\n\n\n\n### Mark Twain[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Krmnicek, Stefan (ed.).

He studied mostly at home, though he attended the Gymnasium Christianeum in Altona for four years. He studied Greek and Latin and received his diploma in 1837. As he could not afford to study at Göttingen, he enrolled at the University of Kiel.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMommsen studied jurisprudence at Kiel from 1838 to 1843, finishing his studies with the degree of Doctor of Roman Law. During this time he was the roommate of Theodor Storm, who was later to become a renowned poet. Together with Mommsen's brother Tycho, the three friends even published a collection of poems (*Liederbuch dreier Freunde*). Thanks to a royal Danish grant, Mommsen was able to visit France and Italy to study preserved classical Roman inscriptions. During the revolution of 1848 he worked as a war correspondent in then-Danish Rendsburg, supporting the German annexation of Schleswig-Holstein and a constitutional reform. Having been forced to leave the country by the Danes, he became a professor of law in the same year at the University of Leipzig. When Mommsen protested against the new constitution of Saxony in 1851, he had to resign. However, the next year he obtained a professorship in Roman law at the University of Zurich and then spent a couple of years in exile. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** \"10 Fin-de-Siècle and Empire's End\" (PDF).

He was very concerned with questions about academic and educational policies and held national positions. Although he had supported German Unification, he was disappointed with the politics of the German Empire and he was quite pessimistic about its future. Mommsen strongly disagreed with Otto von Bismarck about social policies in 1881, advising collaboration between Liberals and Social Democrats and using such strong language that he narrowly avoided prosecution.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a Liberal nationalist Mommsen favored assimilation of ethnic minorities into German society, not exclusion.[15] In 1879, his colleague Heinrich von Treitschke began a political campaign against Jews (the so-called *Berliner Antisemitismusstreit*). Mommsen strongly opposed antisemitism and wrote a harsh pamphlet in which he denounced von Treitschke's views. Mommsen viewed a solution to antisemitism in voluntary cultural assimilation, suggesting that the Jews could follow the example of the people of Schleswig-Holstein, Hanover and other German states, which gave up some of their special customs when integrating into Prussia.[16]\nMommsen was a vehement spokesman for German nationalism, maintaining a militant attitude towards the Slavic nations, to the point of advocating the use of violence against them. In an 1897 letter to the *Neue Freie Presse* of Vienna, Mommsen called Czechs \"apostles of barbarism\" and wrote that \"the Czech skull is impervious to reason, but it is susceptible to blows\".[17][18]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Digesta* (of Justinian), editor (1866–1870, two volumes)\n* *Iordanis Romana et Getica* (1882) was Mommsen's critical edition of Jordanes' *The Origin and Deeds of the Goths* and has subsequently come to be generally known simply as *Getica*.\n* *Codex Theodosianus*, editor (1905, posthumous)\n* *Monumentum Ancyranum*\n* More than 1,500 further studies and treatises on single issues.\n\n\nA bibliography of over 1,000 of his works is given by Zangemeister in *Mommsen als Schriftsteller* (1887; continued by Jacobs, 1905).\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Statue of Theodor Mommsen, Humboldt University of Berlin\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2022: Annie Ernaux\n* 2023: Jon Fosse\n* 2024: *to be announced*\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1902 Nobel Prize laureates\n |\n| --- |\n| Chemistry | * Hermann Emil Fischer (Germany)\n |\n| Literature (1902) | Theodor Mommsen (Germany)\n |\n| Peace | * Élie Ducommun (Switzerland)\n* Charles Albert Gobat (Switzerland)\n |\n| Physics | * Hendrik Lorentz (Netherlands)\n* Pieter Zeeman (Netherlands)\n |\n| Physiology or Medicine | * Ronald Ross (Great Britain)\n |\n| Nobel Prize recipients\n1901\n**1902** \n1903\n1904\n1905\n1906\n1907\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClassical epigraphy\n |\n| --- |\n| Publications | * *L'Année épigraphique*\n* *Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum*\n* *CIMRM*\n* *Inscriptiones Graecae*\n* *Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae*\n* *Roman Inscriptions of Britain*\n* *Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum*\n |\n| Epigraphers | * Herbert Bloch\n* Attilio Degrassi\n* Margherita Guarducci\n* Wilhelm Henzen\n* Adolf Kirchhoff\n* Jerzy Linderski\n* Cyriacus of Ancona\n* Theodor Mommsen\n* John Sandys\n* August Wilhelm Zumpt\n* Ernst Badian\n* Hermann Dessau\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Mommsen, Theodor. *Rome, from earliest times to 44 B.

He pioneered epigraphy, the study of inscriptions in material artefacts. Although the unfinished *History of Rome*, written early in his career, has long been widely considered as his main work, the work most relevant today is, perhaps, the *Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum*, a collection of Roman inscriptions he contributed to the Berlin Academy.[23]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1939: Frans Eemil Sillanpää\n* 1940\n |\n| 1941–1960 | * 1941\n* 1942\n* 1943\n* 1944: Johannes V.

Several old manuscripts were burnt to ashes, including *Manuscript 0.4.36*, which was on loan from the library of Trinity College, Cambridge.[11] There is information that the important Manuscript of Jordanes from Heidelberg University library was burnt.[12] Two other important manuscripts, from Brussels and Halle, were also destroyed.[13]\n\n\nMommsen was an indefatigable worker who rose at five to do research in his library. People often saw him reading whilst walking in the streets.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the beginning of his career, when he published the inscriptions of the Neapolitan Kingdom (1852), Mommsen already had in mind a collection of all known ancient Latin inscriptions. He received additional impetus and training from Bartolomeo Borghesi of San Marino. The complete *Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum* would consist of seventeen volumes, the latest of which was published in 1986. Fifteen of these volumes were published still in Mommsen's lifetime and he wrote five of them himself. The basic principle of the edition (contrary to previous collections) was the method of autopsy, according to which all copies (i.e., modern transcriptions) of inscriptions were to be checked and compared to the original.\n\n\n\n### Further editions and research projects[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1980: Czesław Miłosz\n |\n| 1981–2000 | * 1981: Elias Canetti\n* 1982: Gabriel García Márquez\n* 1983: William Golding\n* 1984: Jaroslav Seifert\n* 1985: Claude Simon\n* 1986: Wole Soyinka\n* 1987: Joseph Brodsky\n* 1988: Naguib Mahfouz\n* 1989: Camilo José Cela\n* 1990: Octavio Paz\n* 1991: Nadine Gordimer\n* 1992: Derek Walcott\n* 1993: Toni Morrison\n* 1994: Kenzaburō Ōe\n* 1995: Seamus Heaney\n* 1996: Wisława Szymborska\n* 1997: Dario Fo\n* 1998: José Saramago\n* 1999: Günter Grass\n* 2000: Gao Xingjian\n |\n| 2001–2020 | * 2001: V.

One morning as we approached a halting-place, I saw a little old gentleman with silvery hair leaning against a lamp-post and holding a large open volume near to his short-sighted eyes, oblivious of the uproar around: the conductor sprang down towards him, and tapping him reverentially on the shoulder conducted him gently to the tram and settled him in his place.

His new departure as a dramatic author began with *En fallit* (A Bankruptcy) and *Redaktøren* (The Editor) in 1874, social dramas of an extremely modern and realistic cast.\n\n\n\n## Collaborations with Grieg[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1870's Bjørnson and the composer Edvard Grieg, who shared his interests in Norwegian self-government, became friends. Grieg set several of his poems to music, including *Landkjenning* and *Sigurd Jorsalfar*.[9] Eventually they decided on an opera based on *King Olav Trygvason*, but a dispute as to whether music or lyrics should be created first led to Grieg being diverted to working on incidental music for Henrik Ibsen's play *Peer Gynt*, which naturally offended Bjørnson. Eventually their friendship was resumed.[10]\n\n\n\n## The \"national poet\"[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Boyesen, Hjalmar Hjorth (1873). \"Björnstjerne Björnson as a Dramatist,\" *The North American Review*, Vol. 116, No. 238, pp. 109–138.\n* Boyesen, Hjalmar Hjorth (1895). \"Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson.\" In: *Essays on Scandinavian Literature*.

In 1877 he published another novel, *Magnhild*, in which his ideas on social questions were seen to be in a state of fermentation, and gave expression to his republican sentiments in the polemical play *Kongen* (The King). In a later edition of the play, he prefixed an essay on \"Intellectual Freedom\" in further explanation of his position. *Kaptejn Mansana* (Captain Mansana), an episode of the war of Italian independence, was written in to 1878.\n\n\nExtremely anxious to obtain full success on the stage, Bjørnson concentrated his powers on a drama of social life, *Leonarda* (1879), which raised a violent controversy.[*why?*] A satirical play, *Det nye System* (The New System), was produced a few weeks later. Although these plays of Bjørnson's second period were greatly discussed, few were financially successful.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn his early fifties, Bjørnson had an affair with 17-year-old Guri Andersdotter (d. 1949), which resulted in the birth of their son, Anders Underdal (1880–1973). The affair was kept a secret, though early on Anders Underdal, a poet, would talk about his origins with his children. Later in life he stopped discussing the matter, no reason was given. Anders was the father of Norwegian-Swedish author Margit Sandemo. Audun Thorsen has written a book about Bjørnson's affair; \"Bjørnsons kvinne og Margit Sandemos \"familiehemmelighet\" (Genesis forlag, Oslo 1999).\n\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"To detach children from their mother tongue is identical to tearing them away from their mothers breasts,\" he wrote.\n\n\nBjørnson wrote in multiple newspapers about the Černová massacre under the title *The greatest industry of Hungary* – which was supposedly \"to produce Magyars\".\n\n\n\n## Last years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Illustration from *Vikingen* of a telegram exchange between Michelsen and Bjørnson.\nBjørnson was, from the beginning of the Dreyfus Affair, a staunch supporter of Alfred Dreyfus, and, according to a contemporary, wrote \"article after article in the papers and proclaimed in every manner his belief in his innocence\". \n\n\nBjørnson was one of the original members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, that awards the Nobel Peace Prize, where he sat from 1901 to 1906.[12] In 1903 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![a painting of the farmyard in winter shows the barn, house and outbuildings around a central yard.](image)Bjørgan farmyard in Kvikne. Drawing by Gerhard Munthe\nBjørnson was born at the farmstead of Bjørgan in Kvikne, a secluded village in the Østerdalen district, some sixty miles south of Trondheim. In 1837 Bjørnson's father Peder Bjørnson, who was the pastor of Kvikne, was transferred to the parish of Nesset, outside Molde in Romsdal. It was in this scenic district that Bjørnson spent his childhood, living at the Nesset Parsonage.\n\n\nAfter a few years studying in the neighbouring city Molde, Bjørnson was sent at the age of 17 to Heltberg Latin School (*Heltbergs Studentfabrikk*) in Christiania to prepare for university. This was the same school that trained Ibsen, Lie, and Vinje.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the close of 1857 Bjørnson had been appointed director of the theatre at Bergen, a post which he held for two years, when he returned to Christiania. From 1860 to 1863 he travelled widely throughout Europe. Early in 1865 he undertook the management of the Christiania Theatre,[8] and brought out his popular comedy of *De Nygifte* (The Newly Married) and his romantic tragedy of Mary Stuart in Scotland. In 1870 he published *Poems and Songs* and the epic cycle *Arnljot Gelline*; the latter volume contains the ode *Bergliot*, one of Bjørnson's finest contributions to lyrical poetry.\n\n\nBetween 1864 and 1874, Bjørnson displayed a slackening of the intellectual forces very remarkable in a man of his energy; he was mainly occupied with politics and with his business as a theatrical manager. This was the period of Bjørnson's most fiery propaganda as a radical agitator. In 1871 he began to supplement his journalistic work by delivering lectures throughout Scandinavia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBjørnson had realized that he wanted to pursue his talent for poetry (he had written verses since age eleven). He matriculated at the University of Oslo in 1852, soon embarking upon a career as a journalist, focusing on criticism of drama.[4][5]\n\n\n\n## Early production[edit]\n\n\nIn 1857 Bjørnson published *Synnøve Solbakken*, the first of his peasant novels. In 1858 this was followed by *Arne*, in 1860 by *En glad Gut* (A Happy Boy), and in 1868 by *Fiskerjentene* (The Fisher Girls). These are the most important specimens of his *bonde-fortellinger* or peasant tales.[6] At least seven Danish composers wrote music based on Arne: Morten Eskesen, C. J. Frydensberg, Peter Heise, Anton Nielsen, Oluf Ring, Henrik Rung, and Sigrid Henriette Wienecke.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMembers of the Norwegian Nobel Committee\n |\n| --- |\n| Chairs | * Jørgen Løvland (1901–21)\n* Fredrik Stang (1922–40)\n* Gunnar Jahn (1941–66)\n* Bernt Ingvaldsen (1967)\n* Aase Lionæs (1968–78)\n* John Sanness (1979–81)\n* Egil Aarvik (1982–89)\n* Gidske Anderson (1990)\n* Francis Sejersted (1991–99)\n* Gunnar Berge (2000–02)\n* Ole Danbolt Mjøs (2002–08)\n* Thorbjørn Jagland (2009–15)\n* Kaci Kullmann Five (2015–2017)\n* Berit Reiss-Andersen (2017–2023)\n* Jørgen Watne Frydnes (2024–)\n |\n| Members | * Løvland (1901–21)\n* Lund (1901–12)\n* Bjørnson (1901–06)\n* Steen (1901–04)\n* Horst (1901–30)\n* Carl Berner (1905–18)\n* Hagerup (1907–20)\n* Hanssen (1913–39)\n* Koht (1918–42)\n* Stang (1921–40)\n* Konow (1922–24)\n* Knudsen (1924)\n* Mowinckel (1925–36)\n* Thallaug (1931–33)\n* Lange (1934–39)\n* Jahn (1938–66)\n* Braadland (1938–48)\n* Vassbotn (1938–39)\n* Hambro (1940–63)\n* Tranmæl (1940–63)\n* Lange (1945–48)\n* Oftedal (1946–47)\n* Ingebretsen (1946)\n* Lionæs (1949–78)\n* Natvig-Pedersen (1964–66)\n* Langhelle (1964–67)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBjørnson produced a social drama, *En Handske* (A Gauntlet), in 1883, but was unable to persuade any manager to stage it except in a modified form. In the autumn of the same year, Bjørnson published a mystical or symbolic drama, *Over Ævne* (Beyond Powers), dealing with the abnormal features of religious excitement with extraordinary force; this was not acted until 1899, when it achieved a great success.\n\n\n\n## Political interests[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson in 1908\nFrom his youth and forwards, Bjørnson admired Henrik Wergeland, and became a vivid spokesman for the Norwegian left-wing movement. In this respect, he supported Ivar Aasen, and joined forces in the political struggles in the 1860s and 1870s. When the great monument over Henrik Wergeland were to be erected in 1881, it came to political struggle between left and right, and the left wing got the upper hand. Bjørnson presented the speech on behalf of Wergeland, and also honouring the constitution and the farmers.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA subject which interested him greatly was the question of the bondemaal, the adopting of a national language for Norway distinct from the *dansk-norsk* (Dano-Norwegian), in which most Norwegian literature had hitherto been written. At an early stage, before 1860, Bjørnson had himself experimented with at least one short story written in landsmål. The interest, however, did not last, and he soon abandoned this enterprise altogether. Afterwards, he regretted that he never felt he gained the mastery of this language. Bjørnson's strong and sometimes rather narrow patriotism did not blind him to what he considered the fatal folly of such a proposal, and his lectures and pamphlets against the *målstræv* in its extreme form were very effective. His attitude towards this must have changed sometime after 1881, as he still spoke on behalf of the farmers at this point. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBjørnson was anxious \"to create a new saga in the light of the peasant,\" as he put it, and he thought this should be done, not merely in prose fiction, but in national dramas or *folke-stykker*. The earliest of these was a one-act piece set in the 12th century, *Mellem Slagene* (Between the Battles), written in 1855 and produced in 1857. He was especially influenced at this time by the study of Jens Immanuel Baggesen and Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger, during a visit to Copenhagen. *Mellem Slagene* was followed by *Halte-Hulda* (Lame Hulda) in 1858, and *Kong Sverre* (King Sverre) in 1861. His most important work to date was the poetic trilogy of *Sigurd Slembe* (Sigurd the Bad), which Bjørnson published in 1862.[4][6]\n\n\n\n## The mature author[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Gosse, Edmund William (1911). \"Björnson, Björnstjerne\".

However, in 1905 he largely remained silent.\n\n\nWhen Norway was attempting to dissolve the forced union with Sweden, Bjørnson sent a telegram to the Norwegian Prime minister stating, \"Now is the time to unite.\" The minister replied, \"Now is the time to shut up.\"[3]\n\n\nThis was in fact a satirical illustration published in *Vikingen*, but the story got so popular and widespread that Bjørnson had to deny it, claiming that \"Michelsen has never asked me to shut up; it would not help if he did\".[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** \"GRIEG, E.: Orchestral Music, Vol. 7 – Olav Trygvason / Landkjenning / Sigurd Jorsalfar (Excerpts) (Malmo Symphony, Engeset)\".

The farmer can cultivate himself to this level, and no more*, he wrote in 1899. Rumour has it that he had been insulted by a farmer at some point, and uttered the statement in sheer anger. In 1881, he spoke of the farmer's clothing borne by Henrik Wergeland, and his opinion then states that this garment, worn by Wergeland, was \"of the most influential things\" in the initiation of the national day. Bjørnson's attitude towards the farmers remain ambiguous. His father himself was a farmer's son. During the last twenty years of his life he wrote hundreds of articles in major European papers. He attacked the French justice in the Dreyfus Affair, and he fought for the rights of children in Slovakia to learn their own mother tongue. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1939: Frans Eemil Sillanpää\n* 1940\n |\n| 1941–1960 | * 1941\n* 1942\n* 1943\n* 1944: Johannes V.
