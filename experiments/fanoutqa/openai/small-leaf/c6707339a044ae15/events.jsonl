The North Chinese language group is set up as the standard grammatically and lexically. Meanwhile, Mao Zedong and Lu Xun writings are used as the basis of the stylistic standard.[5] Pronunciation is taught with the use of the romanized phonetic system known as *pinyin*.

Those without a writing language or with an \"imperfect\" writing language should be helped to develop and reform their writing languages.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause many languages exist in China, they also have problems regarding diglossia. Recently, in terms of Fishman's typology of the relationships between bilingualism and diglossia and his taxonomy of diglossia (Fishman 1978, 1980) in China: more and more minority communities have been evolving from \"diglossia without bilingualism\" to \"bilingualism without diglossia.\" This could be an implication of mainland China's power expanding.[9]\n\n\nIn 2010, Tibetan students protested against changes in the Language Policy on the schools that promoted the use of Mandarin Chinese instead of Tibetan. They argued that the measure would erode their culture.[10] In 2013, China's Education Ministry said that about 400 million people were unable to speak the national language Mandarin. In that year, the government pushed linguistic unity in China, focusing on the countryside and areas with ethnic minorities.[11]\n\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Inner Mongolia protests\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMandarin Chinese is the prestige language in practice, and failure to protect ethnic languages does occur. In summer 2020, the Inner Mongolian government announced an education policy change to phase out Mongolian as the language of instructions for humanities in elementary and middle schools, adopting the national instruction material instead. Thousands of ethnic Mongolians in northern China gathered to protest the policy.[12] The Ministry of Education describes the move as a natural extension of the *Law of the People's Republic of China on the Standard Spoken and Written Chinese Language* (Chinese: 通用语言文字法) of 2000.[13]\n\n\n\n## Study of foreign languages[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* *Language Atlas of China*\n* *Linguistic Atlas of Chinese Dialects*\n* Varieties of Chinese\n* List of varieties of Chinese\n* Han Chinese subgroups\n* Demographics of China\n* Racism in China\n* Hong Kong English\n* Languages of Hong Kong\n* Culture of Macau\n* Macanese Portuguese\n* List of ethnic groups in China\n* Classification of Southeast Asian languages\n* Cantonese\n* Standard Chinese\n* Chinglish\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInterest in Portuguese and Spanish have increased greatly, due in part to Chinese investment in Latin America as well as in African nations such as Angola, Mozambique, and Cape Verde. Portuguese is also one of the official languages in Macau, although its use had stagnated since the nation's transfer from Portugal to the PRC. It was estimated in 2016 that 2.3% of Macau's locals spoke the language,[27] although with government backing since then, interest in it has increased.[28]\n\n\n\n### Use of English[edit]\n\n\nIn China, English is used as a lingua franca in several fields, especially for business settings,[29] and in schools to teach Standard Mandarin to people who are not Chinese citizens.[30] English is also one of the official languages in Hong Kong.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![icon](image)Language portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*The Economist* reported in 2006 that up to one fifth of the population was learning English. Gordon Brown, the former British prime minister, estimated that the total English-speaking population in China would outnumber the native speakers in the rest of the world in two decades.[22]\n\n\nThere have been a growing number of students studying Arabic, due to reasons of cultural interest and belief in better job opportunities.[23] The language is also widely studied amongst the Hui people.[24] In the past, literary Arabic education was promoted in Islamic schools by the Kuomintang when it ruled mainland China.[25]\n\n\nThere have also been a growing number of students choosing to learn Urdu, due to interest in Pakistani culture, close ties between the respective nations, and job opportunities provided by the CPEC.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. **^** Eberhard, David M.; Simons, Gary F.; Fennig, Charles D., eds.

For example, in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, the Javanese language is the region's official language along with Indonesian.[13] Javanese is the most spoken indigenous language, with native speakers constituting 31.8% of the total population of Indonesia (as of 2010).[14] Javanese speakers are predominantly located in the central to eastern parts of Java, and there are also sizable numbers in most provinces. The next most widely spoken regional languages in the country are Sundanese, local Malay, Madurese and Minangkabau. A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strong regional identities.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are hundreds of indigenous languages spoken in Indonesia. Most of them are locally used indigenous languages,[16] a category of languages referring to those spoken at the local, regional level, spoken by a small number of people, ranging from a few to a few thousands of people. These include small languages such as Benggoi, Mombum and Towei.[4][*page needed*] Other languages are spoken at the regional level to connect various ethnicities. For this reason, these languages are known as regional lingua francas (RLFs). According to Subhan Zein, there are at least 43 RLFs in Indonesia, categorized into two types: Malayic RLFs and Non-Malayic RLFs. The former refers to a group of regional lingua francas that are thought of as indigenised varieties of Malay or Indonesian. These include such languages as Ambon Malay, Banjar Malay and Papuan Malay. The latter refers to regional lingua francas that are not associated with Malay or Indonesian, including Biak, Iban and Onin.[17][4][*page needed*][a]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe official language of Indonesia is Indonesian[7] (locally known as *bahasa Indonesia*), a standardised form of Malay,[8] which serves as the lingua franca of the archipelago. The vocabulary of Indonesian borrows heavily from regional languages of Indonesia, such as Javanese, Sundanese and Minangkabau, as well as from Dutch, Sanskrit, Portuguese, Arabic and more recently English.[9][10][11] \nThe Indonesian language is primarily used in commerce, administration, education and the media, and thus nearly every Indonesian speaks the language to varying degrees of proficiency.[12] Most Indonesians speak other languages, such as Javanese, as their first language.[1] This makes plurilingualism a norm in Indonesia.[12]\n\n\n\n## Indigenous languages and regional lingua francas[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Languages of Indonesia.\n\n* Graph of Indonesian ethnolinguistics\n* Linguistic maps of Indonesia at Muturzikin.com\n* How many people speak Indonesian?\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLanguages of Indonesia\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n| Western languages\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

Muhammad stated that much of the public worry about the teaching of local languages being left out of the curriculum is misplaced, and that the new curriculum will be conveyed to them.[*clarification needed*][29]\n\n\n\n## Languages by speakers[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of languages by number of native speakers in Indonesia and List of languages by total number of speakers in Indonesia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEnglish has historically been categorized as the first foreign language in Indonesia.[22] However, increasing exposure to English, the decreasing influence of native-speaker norms in the country and the prevalent use of English as a lingua franca in the broader context such as ASEAN means that the categorization has been put into question.[23][24] Scholars such as Lowenberg argue that English is best seen as an additional language. Meanwhile, Zein argues that English in Indonesia is best categorized as a lingua franca,[23] an argument parallel with Kirkpatrick's contention on the use of English as a lingua franca in the broader ASEAN context.[25]\n\n\n\n### Other languages[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther languages, such as Arabic, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Russian, Portuguese and Spanish, are non-native to Indonesia. These languages are included in the educational curriculum and may be categorized as either foreign or additional languages, depending on the instrumental function of the languages, length and types of exposure, as well as the wide-ranging motivations of the speakers or learners who use and or learn them.[26]\n\n\n\n## Endangered languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of endangered languages in Indonesia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBelow is a chart of several Indonesian languages. All of them except for Galela belong to the Austronesian language family. While there have been misunderstandings on which ones should be classified as *languages* and which ones should be classified as *dialects*, the chart confirms that many have similarities, yet are not mutually comprehensible. The languages are arranged geographically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"Berapa Jumlah Bahasa Daerah di Indonesia?\" [How many regional languages in Indonesia?]. *Liputan6.com* (in Indonesian). 30 October 2017.

Marathi is the third most spoken and understood language in the country with a significant amount of speakers in the southwest,[26] followed closely by Telugu, which is most commonly spoken in southeastern areas.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLanguages spoken in the Republic of India belong to several language families, the major ones being the Indo-Aryan languages spoken by 78.05% of Indians and the Dravidian languages spoken by 19.64% of Indians;[5][6] both families together are sometimes known as Indic languages.[7][8][9][a] Languages spoken by the remaining 2.31% of the population belong to the Austroasiatic, Sino–Tibetan, Tai–Kadai, and a few other minor language families and isolates.[10]: 283 According to the People's Linguistic Survey of India, India has the second highest number of languages (780), after Papua New Guinea (840).[11] Ethnologue lists a lower number of 456.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEthnolinguistically, the languages of South Asia, echoing the complex history and geography of the region, form a complex patchwork of language families, language phyla and isolates.[10] Languages spoken in India belong to several language families, the major ones being the Indo-Aryan languages spoken by 78.05% of Indians and the Dravidian languages spoken by 19.64% of Indians.

The Dravidian languages are indigenous to the Indian subcontinent.[29] Proto-Dravidian languages were spoken in India in the 4th millennium BCE and started disintegrating into various branches around 3rd millennium BCE.[30] The Dravidian languages are classified in four groups: North, Central (Kolami–Parji), South-Central (Telugu–Kui), and South Dravidian (Tamil-Kannada).[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Institutional – 63\n* Developing – 130\n* Vigorous – 187\n* In trouble – 54\n* Dying – 13\n\n\nThe People's Linguistic Survey of India, a privately owned research institution in India, has recorded over 66 different scripts and more than 780 languages in India during its nationwide survey, which the organisation claims to be the biggest linguistic survey in India.[44]\n\n\nThe People of India (POI) project of Anthropological Survey of India reported 325 languages which are used for in-group communication by 5,633 Indian communities.[45]\n\n\n\n### Census of India figures[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe first official survey of language diversity in the Indian subcontinent was carried out by Sir George Abraham Grierson from 1898 to 1928. Titled the Linguistic Survey of India, it reported a total of 179 languages and 544 dialects.[40] However, the results were skewed due to ambiguities in distinguishing between \"dialect\" and \"language\",[40] use of untrained personnel and under-reporting of data from South India, as the former provinces of Burma and Madras, as well as the princely states of Cochin, Hyderabad, Mysore and Travancore were not included in the survey.[41]\n\n\nDifferent sources give widely differing figures, primarily based on how the terms \"language\" and \"dialect\" are defined and grouped. *Ethnologue*, produced by the Christian evangelist organisation SIL International, lists 461 tongues for India (out of 6,912 worldwide), 447 of which are living, while 14 are extinct. The 447 living languages are further subclassified in *Ethnologue* as follows:[42][43]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** Schiffrin, Deborah; Fina, Anna De; Nylund, Anastasia (2010). *Telling Stories: Language, Narrative, and Social Life*.
