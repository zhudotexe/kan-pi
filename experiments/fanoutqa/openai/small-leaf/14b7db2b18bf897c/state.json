They are probably quite accurate for the rarely climbed peaks (though omissions were noted), but greatly underestimate the number of ascending parties on the easier and/or more popular mountains, like most eight-thousanders. For instance, Mount Everest has been scaled 2,251 times by individuals up to 2004 .[14]\n7. **^** Given the large differences between multiple \"definitive\" measurements of Mount Everest, the traditional 8,848 m is listed.

Different sources often differ by many metres, and the heights given below may well differ from those elsewhere in this encyclopedia. As an extreme example, Ulugh Muztagh on the north Tibetan Plateau is often listed as 7,723\u00a0m (25,338\u00a0ft) to 7,754\u00a0m (25,440\u00a0ft), but appears to be only 6,973\u00a0m (22,877\u00a0ft) to 6,987\u00a0m (22,923\u00a0ft). Some mountains differ by > 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) on different maps, while even very thorough current measurements of Mount Everest range from 8,840\u00a0m (29,003\u00a0ft) to 8,848\u00a0m (29,029\u00a0ft). These discrepancies serve to emphasize the uncertainties in the listed heights.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Annapurna Himalaya | 28\u00b031\u203206\u2033N 83\u00b048\u203222\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff28.51833\u00b0N 83.80611\u00b0E\ufeff / 28.51833; 83.80611\ufeff (100.

As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached 7,000\u00a0m (22,970\u00a0ft) on the North Col, the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to 8,320\u00a0m (27,300\u00a0ft), marking the first time a human had climbed above 8,000\u00a0m (26,247\u00a0ft). The 1924 expedition resulted in one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day: George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether they were the first to reach the top. Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary made the first documented ascent of Everest in 1953, using the southeast ridge route. Norgay had reached 8,595\u00a0m (28,199\u00a0ft) the previous year as a member of the 1952 Swiss expedition. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe northern approach to the mountain was discovered by George Mallory and Guy Bullock on the initial 1921 British Reconnaissance Expedition. It was an exploratory expedition not equipped for a serious attempt to climb the mountain. With Mallory leading (and thus becoming the first European to set foot on Everest's flanks) they climbed the North Col to an altitude of 7,005 metres (22,982\u00a0ft). From there, Mallory espied a route to the top, but the party was unprepared to climb any further and descended.\n\n\nThe British returned for a 1922 expedition. George Finch climbed using oxygen for the first time. He ascended at a remarkable speed\u2014290 metres (951\u00a0ft) per hour\u2014and reached an altitude of 8,320\u00a0m (27,300\u00a0ft), the first time a human reported to climb higher than 8,000 m. Mallory and Col. Felix Norton made a second unsuccessful attempt.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition, led by Edouard Wyss-Dunant, was granted permission to attempt a climb from Nepal. It established a route through the Khumbu icefall and ascended to the South Col at an elevation of 7,986\u00a0m (26,201\u00a0ft). Raymond Lambert and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay were able to reach an elevation of about 8,595\u00a0m (28,199\u00a0ft) on the southeast ridge, setting a new climbing altitude record. Tenzing's experience was useful when he was hired to be part of the British expedition in 1953.[102] The Swiss decided to make another post-monsoon attempt in the autumn; they made it to the South Col but were driven back by winter winds and severe cold.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### First successful ascent by Tenzing and Hillary, 1953[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1953 British Mount Everest expedition\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1953, a ninth British expedition, led by John Hunt, returned to Nepal. Hunt selected two climbing pairs to attempt to reach the summit. The first pair, Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans, came within 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) of the summit on 26 May 1953, but turned back after running into oxygen problems. As planned, their work in route finding and breaking trail and their oxygen caches were of great aid to the following pair. Two days later, the expedition made its second assault on the summit with the second climbing pair: the New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepali Sherpa climber. They reached the summit at 11:30\u00a0am local time on 29 May 1953 via the South Col route. At the time, both acknowledged it as a team effort by the whole expedition, but Tenzing revealed a few years later that Hillary had put his foot on the summit first.[105] They paused at the summit to take photographs and buried a few sweets and a small cross in the snow before descending.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, it has attracted considerable attention and climbing attempts. Whether the mountain was climbed in ancient times is unknown. It may have been climbed in 1924, although this has never been confirmed, as neither of the men making the attempt returned. Several climbing routes have been established over several decades of climbing expeditions to the mountain.[87][88][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\nEverest's summit is first known to have been reached by a human in 1953, and interest from climbers increased thereafter.[89] Despite the effort and attention poured into expeditions, only about 200 people had summited by 1987.[89] Everest remained a difficult climb for decades, even for serious attempts by professional climbers and large national expeditions, which were the norm until the commercial era began in the 1990s.[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy March 2012, Everest had been climbed 5,656 times with 223 deaths.[91] Although lower mountains have longer or steeper climbs, Everest is so high the jet stream can hit it. Climbers can be faced with winds beyond 320\u00a0km/h (200\u00a0mph) when the weather shifts.[92] At certain times of the year the jet stream shifts north, providing periods of relative calm at the mountain.[93] Other dangers include blizzards and avalanches.[93]\n\n\nBy 2013, The Himalayan Database recorded 6,871 summits by 4,042 different people.[94]\n\n\n\n### Early attempts[edit]\n\n\nIn 1885, Clinton Thomas Dent, president of the Alpine Club, suggested that climbing Mount Everest was possible in his book *Above the Snow Line*.[95]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1975, Junko Tabei, a Japanese woman, became the first woman to summit Mount Everest.[90]\n\n\nThe 1975 British Mount Everest Southwest Face expedition led and organised by Chris Bonington made the first ascent of the south west face of Everest from the western cwm. \n\n\nThe 1976 British and Nepalese Army Expedition to Everest led by Tony Streather put Bronco Lane and Brummy Stokes on the summit by the normal route.\n\n\nIn 1978, Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler made the first ascent of Everest without supplemental oxygen.\n\n\n\n### 1979/1980: Winter Himalaism[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2021, Nepal banned three Indians for faking an ascent of Mount Everest in 2016.[321][322] In 2017, two Indian police officers, supposedly the first Indian couple to ascend Mount Everest, were sacked once it was found they had faked their ascent.[321]\n\n\n\n## Aviation[edit]\n\n\n### 1933: Flight over Everest[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Houston\u2013Mount Everest flight expedition\n\nLucy, Lady Houston, a British millionaire former showgirl, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933.

Starting in southern India, the survey teams moved northward using giant theodolites, each weighing 500\u00a0kg (1,100\u00a0lb) and requiring 12 men to carry, to measure heights as accurately as possible. They reached the Himalayan foothills by the 1830s, but Nepal was unwilling to allow the British to enter the country due to suspicions of their intentions. Several requests by the surveyors to enter Nepal were denied.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEarly expeditions\u2014such as Charles Bruce's in the 1920s and Hugh Ruttledge's two unsuccessful attempts in 1933 and 1936\u2014tried to ascend the mountain from Tibet, via the North Face. Access was closed from the north to Western expeditions in 1950 after China took control of Tibet. In 1950, Bill Tilman and a small party which included Charles Houston, Oscar Houston, and Betsy Cowles undertook an exploratory expedition to Everest through Nepal along the route which has now become the standard approach to Everest from the south.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1852, stationed at the survey headquarters in Dehradun, Radhanath Sikdar, an Indian mathematician and surveyor from Bengal was the first to identify Everest as the world's highest peak, using trigonometric calculations based on Nicolson's measurements.[28] An official announcement that Peak\u00a0XV was the highest was delayed for several years as the calculations were repeatedly verified. Waugh began work on Nicolson's data in 1854, and along with his staff spent almost two years working on the numbers, having to deal with the problems of light refraction, barometric pressure, and temperature over the vast distances of the observations. Finally, in March 1856 he announced his findings in a letter to his deputy in Calcutta. Kangchenjunga was declared to be 8,582\u00a0m (28,156\u00a0ft), while Peak\u00a0XV was given the height of 8,840\u00a0m (29,002\u00a0ft). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Based on the 2020 surveys of elevation of snow cap, not rock head.

It was the route used by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 and the first recognised of 15 routes to the top by 1996.[241] This was, however, a route decision dictated more by politics than by design, as the Chinese border was closed to the western world in the 1950s, after the People's Republic of China invaded Tibet.[242]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Astill, Tony (2005). *Mount Everest: The Reconnaissance 1935*.\n* Boukreev, Anatoli; DeWalt, G.

The amount of background radiation increases with higher altitudes.[284]\n\n\nThe mountain has also been climbed in the winter, but that is not popular because of the combination of cold high winds and shorter days.[285] By January the peak is typically battered by 170\u00a0mph (270\u00a0km/h) winds and the average temperature of the summit is around \u221233\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221236\u00a0\u00b0C).[66]\n\n\n\n### Selected climbing records[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Timeline of climbing Mount Everest\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1970, Japanese mountaineers conducted a major expedition. The centrepiece was a large \"siege\"-style expedition led by Saburo Matsukata, working on finding a new route up the southwest face.[113] Another element of the expedition was an attempt to ski Mount Everest.[90] Despite a staff of over one hundred people and a decade of planning work, the expedition suffered eight deaths and failed to summit via the planned routes.[90] However, Japanese expeditions did enjoy some successes. For example, Yuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest from the South Col\u2014he descended nearly 1,300 vertical metres (4,200\u00a0ft) from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries. Another success was an expedition that put four on the summit via the South Col route.[90][114][115] Miura's exploits became the subject of film, and he went on to become the oldest person to summit Mount Everest in 2003 at age 70 and again in 2013 at the age of 80.[116]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Khumbu Icefall in 2005\n![](image)The Western Cwm (\"Coom\"), with Everest on the left and Lhotse to the right\nBy the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals.[153] Some notable \"firsts\" by climbers include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 8,848\u00a0m (29,029\u00a0ft) height given was officially recognised by Nepal and China.[34] Nepal planned a new survey in 2019 to determine if the April 2015 Nepal earthquake affected the height of the mountain.[35]\n\n\nIn May 1999, an American Everest expedition directed by Bradford Washburn anchored a GPS unit into the highest bedrock. A rock head elevation of 8,850\u00a0m (29,035\u00a0ft), and a snow/ice elevation 1\u00a0m (3\u00a0ft) higher, were obtained via this device.[36] Although as of 2001, it has not been officially recognised by Nepal,[37] this figure is widely quoted. Geoid uncertainty casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 (see \u00a7 21st-century surveys) surveys.[38]\n\n\nIn 1955, a detailed photogrammetric map (at a scale of 1:50,000) of the Khumbu region, including the south side of Mount Everest, was made by Erwin Schneider as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, which also attempted Lhotse.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n89. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Mt.

The team of 20 Polish climbers and 4 Sherpas established a base camp on Khumbu Glacier in early January 1980. On 15 January, the team managed to set up Camp III at 7150 metres above sea level, but further action was stopped by hurricane-force winds. The weather improved after 11 February, when Leszek Cichy, Walenty Fiut and Krzysztof Wielicki set up camp IV on South Col (7906 m). Cichy and Wielicki started the final ascent at 6:50\u00a0am on 17 February. At 2:40\u00a0pm Andrzej Zawada at base camp heard the climbers' voices over the radio \u2013 \"We are on the summit!

Waugh argued that because there were many local names, it would be difficult to favour one name over all others; he decided that Peak XV should be named after British surveyor Sir George Everest, his predecessor as Surveyor General of India.[16][17][18] Everest himself opposed the name suggested by Waugh and told the Royal Geographical Society in 1857 that \"Everest\" could not be written in Hindi nor pronounced by \"the native of India\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n222. **^** Everest mountaineer warned of overcrowding before dying on climb *www.cnn.com*, accessed 12 December 2020\n223. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"What's causing Mount Everest's deadly season?

They failed because of poor weather and snow conditions.[16]\n* In 1931, Paul Bauer led a second German expedition team who attempted the northeast spur before being turned back by bad weather, illnesses and deaths. The team, including Peter Aufschnaiter, retreated after climbing 300 m higher than the 1929 attempt.[38]\n* In 1954, John Kempe led a party comprising J. W. Tucker, S. R. Jackson, G. C. Lewis, T. H. Braham and medical officer D. S. Mathews. They explored the upper Yalung glacier with the intention to discover a practicable route to the great ice-shelf that runs across the southwest face of Kangchenjunga.[39] This reconnaissance led to the route used by the successful 1955 expedition.[40]\n\n\n### First ascent[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* In 1883, a party of William Woodman Graham together with two Swiss mountaineers climbed in the area of Kangchenjunga. They were the first who ascended Kabru within 30\u201340\u00a0ft (9.1\u201312.2\u00a0m) below the summit. They crossed the Kang La pass and climbed a peak of nearly 19,000\u00a0ft (5,800\u00a0m) from which they examined Jannu. They concluded it was too late in the year for an attempt and returned once again to Darjeeling.[35]\n* Between October 1885 and January 1886, Rinzin Namgyal surveyed the unexplored north and west sides of Kangchenjunga. He was the first native surveyor to map the circuit of Kangchenjunga and provided sketches of each side of the peak and the adjoining valleys. He also defined the frontiers of Nepal, Tibet and Sikkim in this area.[36]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* In 1899, British mountaineer Douglas Freshfield set out with his party comprising the Italian photographer Vittorio Sella. They were the first mountaineers to examine the lower and upper ramparts, and the great western face of Kangchenjunga, rising from the Kangchenjunga Glacier.[3]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUntil 1852, Kangchenjunga was assumed to be the highest mountain in the world, but calculations and measurements by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in 1849 showed that Mount Everest, known as Peak XV at the time, is actually higher. After allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga was the third-highest mountain.[6]\n\n\nThe Kangchenjunga is a sacred mountain in Nepal and Sikkim and was first climbed on 25 May 1955 by Joe Brown and George Band, who were part of the 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition.

However, from a high camp at about 22,600\u00a0ft (6,900\u00a0m) they were eventually able to reach a point 50 or 60\u00a0ft (15 or 18\u00a0m) below the summit before they were turned back by strong winds.[35]\n* In 1929, the German Paul Bauer led an expedition team that reached 7,400\u00a0m (24,300\u00a0ft) on the northeast spur before being turned back by a five-day storm.[38]\n* In May 1929, the American E.

The key col for Kangchenjunga lies at a height of 4,664 metres (15,302\u00a0ft), along the watershed boundary between Arun and Brahmaputra rivers in Tibet.[28] It is, however, the fourth-most-prominent peak in the Himalayas, after Everest, and the western and eastern anchors of the Himalaya, Nanga Parbat and Namcha Barwa, respectively.[29]\n\n\n\n## Climbing routes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* In *The Epic of Mount Everest*, first published in 1926, Sir Francis Younghusband: \" For natural beauty Darjiling (Darjeeling) is surely unsurpassed in the world. From all countries travellers come there to see the famous view of Kangchenjunga, 28,150 feet (8,580\u00a0m) in height, and only 40 miles (64\u00a0km) distant. Darjiling (Darjeeling) itself is 7,000 feet (2,100\u00a0m) above sea-level and is set in a forest of oaks, magnolia, rhododendrons, laurels and sycamores. And through these forests, the observer looks down the steep mountain-sides to the Rangeet River only 1,000 feet (300\u00a0m) above sea-level, and then up and up through tier after tier of forest-clad ranges, each bathed in a haze of deeper and deeper purple, till the line of snow is reached; and then still up to the summit of Kangchenjunga, now so pure and ethereal we can scarcely believe it is part of the solid earth on which we stand; and so high it seems part of the very sky itself.\"\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kanchenjunga as seen from Gangtok, Sikkim\nBecause of its remote location in Nepal and the difficulty involved in accessing it from India, the Kangchenjunga region is not much explored by trekkers. It has, therefore, retained much of its pristine beauty. In Sikkim too, trekking into the Kangchenjunga region has just recently been permitted. The Goecha La trek is gaining popularity amongst tourists. It goes to the Goecha La Pass, located right in front of the huge southeast face of Kangchenjunga. Another trek to Green Lake Basin has recently[*when?*] been opened for trekking. This trek goes to the Northeast side of Kangchenjunga along the famous Zemu Glacier.

The main summit is on the border between Tibet Autonomous Region of China and the Khumbu region of Nepal.\n\n\nWith Everest to the north and Nuptse to the west, Lhotse forms the apex of the massive horseshoe-shaped arc of the Everest massif. Despite the tremendous vertical relief of its South and Northeast Faces, it is the least prominent of the eight-thousanders due to the great height of the South Col between it and Everest. Lhotse's Western Face, recessed behind the head of the Khumbu Glacier in the Western Cwm, plays an integral part in the standard routes of ascent for both peaks; the name Lhotse, which means \"South Peak\" in Tibetan, further emphasizes the close relationship between the two.\n\n\nThe main ridge of the mountain features four distinct summits: Lhotse Main at 8,516 metres (27,940\u00a0ft) above sea level, Lhotse Middle (also known as Lhotse Central I or Lhotse East) at 8,414\u00a0m (27,605\u00a0ft), Lhotse Central II at 8,372\u00a0m (27,467\u00a0ft) and Lhotse Shar at 8,383\u00a0m (27,503\u00a0ft). Though Lhotse Main is considered to be an intermediately difficult eight-thousander when ascended from the standard Reiss Couloir route, its secondary summits and extremely steep South Face are regarded as some of the most difficult and dangerous climbs in the world.[2][3]Its icy North East Face remains unclimbed.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Climbing[edit]\n\n\nAn early attempt on Lhotse was made by the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, headed by Norman Dyhrenfurth. It also included two Austrians (cartographers Erwin Schneider and Ernst Senn) and two Swiss (Bruno Spirig and Arthur Sp\u00f6hel), and was the first expedition in the Everest area to include Americans (Fred Beckey, George Bell, and Richard McGowan). The Nepalese liaison officer was Gaya Nanda Vaidya. They were accompanied by 200 local porters and several climbing Sherpas. After a brief look at the dangerous southern approaches of Lhotse Shar, they turned their attention, during September and October, to the Western Cwm and the northwest face of Lhotse, on which they achieved an altitude of about 8,100 metres (26,600\u00a0ft). They were beaten back by unexpectedly strong wind and low temperatures. Under Schneider's direction, they completed the first map of the Everest area (1:50,000 photogrammetric). The expedition also made several short films covering local cultural topics and made a number of first ascents of smaller peaks in the Khumbu region.[5]\n\n\nThe main summit of Lhotse was first climbed on 18 May 1956, by the Swiss team of Ernst Reiss and Fritz Luchsinger, members of the Swiss Mount Everest/Lhotse Expedition.[6][7]\n\n\nOn 12 May 1970, Sepp Mayerl and Rolf Walter of Austria made the first ascent of Lhotse Shar.[8]\n\n\nOn 12 May 1999, Czech climber So\u0148a Vom\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1 reached the main summit and thus became the first woman to reach it without supplemental oxygen.\n[9]\n\n\nLhotse Middle remained, for a long time, the highest unclimbed named point on Earth; its first ascent was made on 23 May 2001 by Eugeny Vinogradsky, Sergei Timofeev, Alexei Bolotov and Petr Kuznetsov of a Russian expedition.[10]\n\n\nThe Lhotse standard climbing route follows the same path as Everest's South Col route up to the Yellow Band beyond Camp 3. After the Yellow Band, the routes diverge with climbers bound for Everest taking a left over the Geneva Spur up to the South Col, while Lhotse climbers take a right further up the Lhotse face. The last part to the summit leads through the narrow \"Reiss couloir\" until the Lhotse main peak is reached.\n\n\nBy December 2008, 371 climbers had summited Lhotse while 20 had died during their attempt.[11] Lhotse was not summited in 2014, 2015, or 2016 due to a series of incidents. It was next summited in May 2017.[12]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nuptse Ridge, Everest, Lhotse, and Lhotse Shar peaks\n### Timeline[edit]\n\n\n* 1955 Attempt by the International Himalayan Expedition.[5]\n* 1956 May 18 First ascent of the main summit: Fritz Luchsinger and Ernst Reiss.[6]\n* 1965 First attempt on Lhotse Shar by a Japanese expedition \u2013 reached 8,100\u00a0m (26,570\u00a0ft).[13]\n* 1970 May 12 First ascent of Lhotse Shar by an Austrian expedition, Sepp Mayerl, Rolf Walter.\n* 1973 First attempt on the South Face by a Japanese expedition led by Ryohei Uchida.\n* 1974 December 25 First attempt of an 8,000-meter peak in winter.

The Lhotse Face (centre right) is connected to Mount Everest (centre left) by the South Col (centre, lowest point on horizon).\n### Lhotse Face[edit]\n\n\nThe western flank of Lhotse is known as the *Lhotse Face*. Any climber bound for the South Col on Everest must climb this 1,125\u00a0m (3,690\u00a0ft) wall of glacial blue ice. This face rises at 40 and 50-degree pitches with the occasional 80-degree bulges. High-altitude climbing Sherpas and the lead climbers will set fixed ropes up this wall of ice. Climbers and porters need to establish a good rhythm of foot placement and pull themselves up the ropes using their jumars. Two rocky sections called the Yellow Band and the Geneva Spur interrupt the icy ascent on the upper part of the face.\n\n\nOn 19 May 2016, a high-altitude mountain worker, Ang Furba Sherpa, died when he slipped and fell down the Lhotse face.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSouthern and northern climbing routes as seen from the International Space Station.

It is located in the Mahalangur Himalayas 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) southeast of Mount Everest, on the China\u2013Nepal border. One of the eight-thousanders, Makalu is an isolated peak in the shape of a four-sided pyramid.\n\n\nMakalu has two notable subsidiary peaks. Kangchungtse, or Makalu II (7,678\u00a0m) lies about three kilometres (two miles) north-northwest of the main summit. Rising about 5\u00a0km (3\u00a0mi) north-northeast of the main summit across a broad plateau, and connected to Kangchungtse by a narrow, 7,200\u00a0m saddle, is Chomo Lonzo (7,804\u00a0m).\n\n\n\n\n## Climbing history[edit]\n\n\nThe first climb on Makalu was made by an American team led by Riley Keegan in the spring of 1954. The expedition was composed of Sierra Club members including Bill Long and Allen Steck, and was called the California Himalayan Expedition to Makalu.[3]\nThey attempted the southeast ridge but were turned back at 7,100 metres (23,300\u00a0ft) by a constant barrage of storms. A New Zealand team including Sir Edmund Hillary was also active in the spring, but did not get very high due to injury and illness. In the fall of 1954, a French reconnaissance expedition made the first ascents of the subsidiary summits Kangchungtse (October 22: Jean Franco, Lionel Terray, sirdar Gyalzen Norbu Sherpa and Pa Norbu) and Chomo Lonzo (October 30?: Jean Couzy and Terray).[4]\n\n\n\n### First ascent[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1955 French Makalu expedition\n\nMakalu was first summited on May 15, 1955, by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy of a French expedition led by Jean Franco. Franco, Guido Magnone and Gyalzen Norbu Sherpa summitted the next day, followed by Jean Bouvier, Serge Coup\u00e9, Pierre Leroux and Andr\u00e9 Vialatte on the 17th. This was an amazing achievement at the time, to have the vast majority of expedition members summit, especially on such a difficult peak. Prior to this time, summits were reached by one to two expedition members at most, with the rest of teams providing logistical support before turning around and heading home. The French team climbed Makalu by the north face and northeast ridge, via the saddle between Makalu and Kangchungtse (the Makalu-La), establishing the standard route.[4]\n\n\nAn ascent without oxygen was attempted by the 1960-61 Silver Hut expedition but two attempts did not succeed.\n\n\n\n### Notable ascents[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Glacier on Makalu\n![](image)Makalu\n![](image)Makalu 3D\n* 1955 *North Face to Northeast Ridge* FA by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy of France.[4]\n* 1970: *Southeast Ridge* FA of ridge attempted by the Americans in 1954,[5] was made by Y. Ozaki and A. Tanaka from Japan on May 23.[6]\n* 1971: The very technical *West Pillar* route was climbed in May by Frenchmen B. Mellet and Y. Seigneur.[4]\n* 1975: *South Face* \u2013 an expedition led by Ale\u0161 Kunaver reached the top of Makalu up its steep southern side, becoming the first Slovenes to summit an eight-thousander. The first amongst them was Stane Belak. This was the third ascent of an eight-thousand meter peak by a great mountain face and the highest peak successfully summitted without supplementary oxygen (Marjan Manfreda).[7]\n* 1976 \u2013 South pillar route completed by Czechoslovak expedition (first attempt in 1973 ended shortly before Makalu South at 8010m due to the fatal fall of Jan Kounick\u00fd). Route goes via south buttress to Makalu South and then via southeast ridge. Makalu South was climbed by 11 expedition members. Two of them \u2013 Karel Schubert and Milan Kri\u0161\u0161\u00e1k summited main summit together with Jorge Camprubi from Spanish expedition which climbed southeast ridge. Karel Schubert died after bivouac near the summit.[*citation needed*]\n* 1980: The second ascent of the *West Pillar* was completed in May by John Roskelley (summit), Chris Kopczynski, James States and Kim Momb, without Sherpa support and without bottled oxygen.[8]\n* 1981: On 15 October renowned Polish climber Jerzy Kukuczka ascended Makalu via a new route up the north-western side and north crest. Kukuczka climbed solo, in Alpine style, without supplemental oxygen.[9]\n* 1982\u00a0: On 10 October Polish climber Andrzej Czok ascended Makalu via West face till 8000m and north-western ridge. Camp IV was reached by two more climbers, Janusz Skorek and Andrzej Machnik, but when their first summit attempt failed, Czok decided to try one more time solo.[10]\n* 1988: Frenchman Marc Batard climbed in one day (after camps were set up) to the summit via the *West Buttress* on April 27.[11]\n* 1989: *Direct South Face*, solo new start by Frenchman Pierre Beghin to 1975 Yugoslav route.[12]\n* 1990: First female ascent, Kitty Calhoun via the West Pillar route.[13]\n* 1994: On May 15, the anniversary of the first summit, Anatoli Boukreev made a speed ascent in 46 hours.[*citation needed*]\n* 1997: After seven failed attempts between 1977 and 1996, the West face was finally ascended. A Russian expedition led by Sergey Efimov brought Alexei Bolotov, Yuri Ermachek, Dmitri Pavlenko, Igor Bugachevski and Nikolai Jiline to the summit.[14] This ascent won the 1998 Piolet d'Or.\n* 2006: On or about January 27 the French mountaineer Jean-Christophe Lafaille disappeared on Makalu while trying to make the first winter ascent.[15]\n* 2009: Makalu was first climbed in winter on February 9, 2009, by Italian Simone Moro and Kazakh Denis Urubko.[16][17] It was the final Nepali eight-thousander to be climbed in winter conditions. Moro had previously made the first winter ascent of Shishapangma in winter 2005 with Pole Piotr Morawski.\n* 2022: Ecuadorian Karl Egloff set a new speed record by ascending in 17 hours 18 minutes on May 8, 2022. He climbed without sherpa support and without bottled oxygen. [18]\n* 2022: Adrian Ballinger made the first ski descent, skiing from 15m below the summit to the foot of the glacier.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n![](image)\n2004 photo mosaic: the Himalayas with Makalu and Mount Everest from the International Space Station, Expedition 8.\n\n## Makalu-Barun Valley[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Makalu-Barun Valley \u2013 A glacier valley starting from the foot of the Makalu.\nMain article: Barun Valley\n\nMakalu-Barun Valley is a Himalayan glacier valley situated at the base of Makalu in the Sankhuwasabha district of Nepal.
