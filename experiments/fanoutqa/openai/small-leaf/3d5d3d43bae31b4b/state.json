The current mayor of Philadelphia is Jim Kenney, whose term as mayor expires in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first mayor of Philadelphia was Humphrey Morrey, who was appointed to the position by William Penn, the founder of the city and the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania, which became the state of Pennsylvania following the American Revolutionary War. Penn subsequently appointed Edward Shippen under the city charter of 1701. The Philadelphia City Council then elected Shippen to a second term. Subsequent mayors, who held office for one year, were elected by the Philadelphia City Council. The initial mayors of Philadelphia were not compensated and candidates sometimes objected strongly to being selected to the position, sometimes choosing even to pay a fine rather than serve in the position.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe restriction was lifted in the 1940s allowing Bernard Samuel to run for re-election. In 1951, the city's Home Rule Charter established a two-term limit for mayors.[4] The term limit is consecutive, not lifetime. \n\n\nThe mayorship of Philadelphia has been held by Democrats since 1952. The only Republican who has come close to winning the position was Sam Katz, who in 1999 came within half a percentage point of being the first Republican mayor of Philadelphia elected in over 45 years.\n\n\n\n## List of Mayors[edit]\n\n\nParties\n\u00a0\u00a0Democratic (16) \n\u00a0\u00a0Democratic-Republican (4) \n\u00a0\u00a0Federalist (6) \n\u00a0\u00a0Keystone (1) \n\u00a0\u00a0National Republican (2) \n\u00a0\u00a0Republican (19) \n\u00a0\u00a0Whig (5) \n\n\n\n### Colonial mayors elected by the Common Council[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMayors of Philadelphia (chronologically)\n |\n| --- |\n| Colonial era(1691\u20131776) | * Morrey\n* Shippen (I)\n* Morris (I)\n* G.

When he could not be located after three days, a new election had to be arranged, and Attwood was re-elected to a second term.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1826, Council could elect any citizen of Philadelphia to the mayoralty. From 1839, mayors were elected by popular vote. If no candidate won a majority of the popular vote, then the joint Councils (Select and Common) would decide between the two leading candidates. John Swift was the first mayor to be elected directly by the people in the 1840 election.\n\n\nThe term of office was extended to two years in 1854, three years in 1861, and four years in 1885. Further, The Act of 1885 prohibited mayors from succeeding themselves.[4]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 59 |  | Benjamin W.

The mayor has the duty to enforce and execute the laws enacted by the San Diego City Council, the legislative branch. The mayor serves a four-year term and is limited to two successive terms.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of June 2024, 36 individuals have served as mayor. There have been 37 mayoralties because Edwin M. Capps served two non-consecutive terms; he is counted chronologically as both the ninth and sixteenth mayor. The longest term was that of Pete Wilson, who served for eleven years over three terms prior to the establishment of successive term limits. The shortest term, not counting interim or acting mayors, was that of George P. Tebbetts, who served for less than two months before the position of mayor was abolished due to the bankruptcy of the city. Percy J. Benbough is the only mayor to have died in office. Two women have been elected mayor: Maureen O'Connor and Susan Golding consecutively. John F. Forward Sr. and John F. Forward Jr. are the only father and son to have both served as mayor. Todd Gloria is the first mayor of color, with Filipino, Latino, and Native American heritage. Gloria is also the first elected mayor to be openly gay.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** \"Toni Atkins to serve as San Diego's deputy mayor until new mayor elected\". *San Diego Union-Tribune*.

However, the city went bankrupt in 1852, only two years after incorporation. As a result of the bankruptcy, the State of California dissolved the government and replaced the mayor and city council with a board of trustees.[1] The mayoral position was later re-established with a new charter in 1887.[2] This charter was replaced with a permanent City Charter on May 6, 1889, using the strong mayor form of government.\n\n\nIn 1931, a new charter was adopted using a council\u2013manager government with a citywide mayor as leader of the city council.\n\n\nIn November 2004, voters approved Proposition F, returning San Diego to the strong mayor form of government on a five-year trial basis. This was made permanent in June 2010 with the passage of Proposition D.[3]\n\n\n\n### Scandals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **i** Dick Murphy resigned from office amid criticism for his role in the San Diego pension scandal and after failing to win a majority of the votes in the 2004 election.[39] Michael Zucchet served as acting mayor for three days before he too resigned due to a corruption conviction that was later overturned.[40] A week later, the City Council elected Toni Atkins to serve as acting mayor until a new election could be held.[41]\n* **j** Bob Filner resigned from office amid multiple allegations of sexual harassment. Todd Gloria served as interim mayor until a new mayor was elected.[42]\n\n### References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** \"PERCY J.

The mayor has the authority to approve or veto council actions, subject to a two-thirds vote veto overrule. Under the strong mayor system, the mayor has sole authority to appoint and dismiss the city manager and to direct and control the city manager as permitted by the city charter. The mayor also has the authority to dismiss the chief of police or the chief of the fire department subject to a council overrule. The mayor may recommend measures and ordinance to the city council, but may not vote on these items.\n\n\nOn or before January 15, the mayor is obligated to communicate a State of the City address to the city council. The mayor must also propose a budget to the city council and for public review no later than April 15.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** Garrick, David (November 21, 2018). \"Ballot measures hiking council pay, boosting transparency approved by wide margins in San Diego\". *The San Diego Union-Tribune*.

The President of the Board was called *mayor* by courtesy, although there was no official office of mayor.[1] When the office of president was vacated due to death or resignation, the board of trustees would choose a president pro tempore to preside over meetings until a permanent president could be elected by the board.[26][27]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Filner apologizes, gets professional help, *San Diego Union Tribune*, July 11, 2013\n15. **^** Lah, Kyung (August 21, 2013). \"Another sex harassment accusation for San Diego Mayor Bob Filner\". *CNN*.

If the vacancy occurs with more than one year remaining, the city council is obligated to call a special election. The candidate with the majority of the votes in the special election is declared mayor. If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off must be held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending a special election, the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected.[24] If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or more, it will count as one full term.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** \"William Jefferson Hunsaker (1855-1933)\". *Biographies*.
