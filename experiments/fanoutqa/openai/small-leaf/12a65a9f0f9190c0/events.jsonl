The racial makeup of the county was 54.36% White (45.79% White Non-Hispanic), 9.40% Asian, 0.07% Pacific Islander, 17.39% African American, 0.50% Native American, 14.14% from other races, and 4.14% from two or more races. 27.18% of the population were Hispanic of any race. 29.43% of the population was foreign born; of this, 48.4% came from Latin America, 27.1% from Asia, 18.4% from Europe and 6.1% from other parts of the world.[15]\n\n\nThe census of 2000 showed that the neighborhoods of Lower Manhattan (i.e., Manhattan south of Houston street) had a sharply different population than the rest of the borough with 41% Asian, 32% white (non-Hispanic), 19% Hispanic, and 6% black. In addition, 43% of the inhabitants were immigrants. The high number of immigrants are related to those in Chinatown, whose population accounts for 55% of the total of Lower Manhattan. [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## 2009 American community survey[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ethnic origins in Manhattan\nAccording to the 2009 American Community Survey, White Americans made up 58.9% of Manhattan's population; non-Hispanic whites made up 50.7% of the population. Black Americans made up 15.5% of Manhattan's population; non-Hispanic blacks made up 13.0% of the population; Native Americans made up 0.3% of the population; Asian Americans made up 10.3% of the population; Multiracial Americans made up 3.4% of the population; Hispanics and Latinos made up 23.8% of Manhattan's population.[16]\nWhite Americans are the largest racial group in Manhattan; whites make up 58.9% of the borough's population. Whites of non-Hispanic origin form a slight majority, making up 50.7% of the population. Of Manhattan's 1,630,000 people, 960,000 are white, of which 825,000 are non-Hispanic whites. Manhattan's white population is ethnically heterogeneous. German Americans are the largest Euro-American ethnic group in the borough, making up 7.2% of the population. Irish Americans and Italian Americans make up 6.9% and 5.5% of the population, respectively. Russian Americans are also sizable, making up 6.2% of the populace. Americans of English descent form 5.2% of the borough's population, and Polish Americans make up 4.8% of the populace. Americans of French descent make up 1.9% of Manhattan's population, while those of Scottish descent form 1.3% of the populace. Jewish Americans, most of whom self-identify as \"white\" under the U.S. Census classifications, are most concentrated in the Upper West Side, Upper East Side, and Midtown regions of Manhattan.[17]\n\n\nBlack Americans make up 15.5% of the borough's population and are concentrated primarily in the Upper Manhattan region of Harlem. The percentage of Blacks in Manhattan has continually been on the decline since the end of World War II.[*citation needed*] This is in large part due to the exodus of Black residents from Harlem which peaked in population in 1950[*citation needed*] and the establishment of Black communities in the other boroughs such as Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Southeast Queens, and the Northeast Bronx. Blacks of non-Hispanic origin form 13.0% of the population. Roughly 253,000 are black, of which 211,000 are non-Hispanic blacks. Roughly 27,000 residents reported their ancestry as *Sub-Saharan African* in the survey, which is equal to 1.6% of Manhattan's population. Included in the African descendant population in Harlem are African immigrants and Afro-Caribbeans from the West Indies. Harlem has seen a pattern of gentrification and a wave of new businesses came to the section during the 1990s and it is home of an increasingly large upper-class of all races, but the majority happen to be African-American.[18][19]\n\n\nNative Americans are one of the borough's smallest ethnic minority groups. Only 5,500 individuals of the borough's 1.6 million people are Native Americans. The number of Native Americans who are of non-Hispanic origin is even smaller. Roughly 1,370 residents are Native Americans of non-Hispanic descent, which is 0.1% of the population. In addition, people who are of mixed Caucasian and Native American ancestry make up 0.2% of the population. There are a number of Mohawks indigenous to the New York city area and/or Upstate New York, and many Mohawks arrived in the 1930s to work in the skyscraper building construction industry.[20][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Manhattan Chinatown\nAsian Americans are one of the borough's larger racial groups. Asians represent 10.3% of Manhattan's population. Asians of non-Hispanic origin make up 10.2% of the population. Like the Caucasian population, the Asian population is ethnically heterogeneous. Chinese Americans make up the majority of the Asian population. Of Manhattan's 168,000 Asians, some 90,000 are of Chinese descent (5.6% of the population). Roughly 21,000 residents are of Indian descent. Manhattan is home to over 16,300 Koreans, 15,200 Japanese, 11,800 Filipinos, and nearly 3,000 Vietnamese.\n\n![](image)32nd street in Manhattan's Koreatown, 2009.\nPacific Islander Americans are, by far, the smallest racial minority group in Manhattan. Just over 540 people identified themselves as such. Also, just above 270 individuals are Pacific Islanders of non-Hispanic origin.\n\n\nMultiracial Americans are a smaller minority group in Manhattan, but they are sizable. Nearly 55,000 multiracial individuals call Manhattan home, and they make up 3.4% of the population. People of European American and African American heritage form 1.4% of the population, and number over 22,200 individuals. In addition, people of Caucasian and Asian heritage make up 0.8% of the population, and number over 13,400 individuals. People of African American and Native American heritage make up 0.1% of the population, and they number at nearly 1,800 individuals.\n\n\nHispanic and Latino Americans are the largest ethnic minority group in Manhattan. Over 387,000 Hispanics and Latinos represent 23.8% of Manhattan's total population. Significant groups include Puerto Ricans, Dominicans and Mexicans; Puerto Ricans make up 6.7% of the population, and number over 109,000 individuals. Mexicans make up 2.7% of the population, and number over 43,000 individuals. In addition, the borough is home to over 10,000 Cubans; people of Cuban descent form 0.6% of the population. Lastly, there are over 224,000 Hispanics that are of other ethnic groups, such as Ecuadorian, Salvadoran, etc. These people collectively make up 13.8% of the population. Hispanics are numerous throughout the borough but most prominently in East Harlem, Loisada, and Washington Heights.[16][21]\n\n\n\n## Household income[edit]\n\n\nThere were 738,644 households, out of which 17.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 25.2% were married couples living together, 12.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 59.1% were non-families. 48.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.00 and the average family size was 2.99.\n\n\nIn the county the population was spread out, with 16.8% under the age of 18, 10.2% from 18 to 24, 38.3% from 25 to 44, 22.6% from 45 to 64, and 12.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females there were 90.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.9 males. The largest age cohort in the county was 25–29(recent college graduates).[22]\n\n\nThe median income for a household in the county was $47,030, and the median income for a family was $50,229. Males had a median income of $51,856 versus $45,712 for females. The per capita income for the county was $42,922. About 17.6% of families and 20.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 31.8% of those under age 18 and 18.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\nManhattan is one of the highest-income places in the United States with a population over 1,000,000. In particular the Upper East Side, ZIP Code 10021, with over 100,000 inhabitants and a per capita income of over $90,000, is one of the largest concentrations of wealth in the entire United States, although this is offset by a high cost of living[*citation needed*]. Like all large US cities, Manhattan does have some large enclaves of concentrated poverty.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2010, 59.98% (902,267) of Manhattan residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 23.07% (347,033) spoke Spanish, 5.33% (80,240) Chinese, 2.03% (30,567) French, 0.78% (11,776) Japanese, 0.77% (11,517) Russian, 0.72% (10,788) Korean, 0.70% (10,496) German, 0.66% (9,868) Italian, 0.64% (9,555) Hebrew, and African languages were spoken as a main language by 0.48% (7,158) of the population over the age of five. In total, 40.02% (602,058) of Manhattan's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[23]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nNew York County is diverse religiously and ethnically. According to a report by The Association of Religion Data,[24] the largest religious affiliation in Manhattan is the Roman Catholic Church, whose adherents constitute 564,505 persons (more than 36% of the population) and maintain 110 congregations. Jewish-Americans comprise the second largest religious group, with 314,500 persons (around 20.5%), and have 102 congregations. Other large denominations include Protestants (139,732 adherents) and Muslims (37,078).\n\n\n\n## Population density[edit]\n\n\nAs of the 2020 census, the population density of New York County was 74,870.7 inhabitants per square mile (28,907.7/km2), the highest population density of any county in the United States.[5] In 1910, at the height of European immigration to New York, Manhattan's population density reached a peak of 101,548 people per square mile (39,208 people/km2).[5][13]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Demographics of New York City\n* Demographics of New York (state)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"A Story Map: 2020 Census Demographic Data Map Viewer\".

There is an 89.7 percent chance that any two residents, chosen at random, would be of different race or ethnicity.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## 2013 estimates[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Racial/ethnic concentrations within the Bronx, by block.

In addition, 54.6% of the population was of Hispanic or Latino origin, of any race.\n\n\nThe Census Bureau considers the Bronx to be the most diverse area in the country. There is an 89.7 percent chance that any two residents, chosen at random, would be of different race or ethnicity.[2] The borough's formerly most populous racial group, white, declined from 98.3% in 1940 to 45.8% by 2012.[3]\n\n\n31.7% of the population were foreign born and another 8.9% were born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or born abroad to American parents. 55.6% spoke a language other than English at home and 16.4% had a bachelor's degree or higher.[7]\n\n\nApproximately 44.3% of the population over the age of 5 speak only English at home, which is roughly 570,000 people. The majority (55.7%) of the population speak non-English languages at home. Over 580,600 people (45.2% of the population) speak Spanish at home.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## Demographics from the 2020 Census[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2020 census data from New York City Department of City Planning, there was a total population of 1,472,654 residents with 806,463 Hispanic residents making up 54.8%, 419,393 Black residents making up 28.5%, 130,796 White residents making up 8.9%, and 67,766 Asian residents making up 4.6%. Hispanic and Black populations overwhelmingly made up the vast majority of the Borough, but the Hispanic population was two times the size of the Black population. With the Hispanic making up a more than 50% majority in the borough, it is the largest concentration of Hispanic communities of NYC. Meanwhile, the other 3 boroughs like Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens had a more or less equal diverse racial and ethnic populations than The Bronx. Of all of the NYC boroughs, The Bronx has the highest overwhelming concentration of Non-White populations and it is the only borough in all of NYC to be almost exclusively populated by Non-White enclaves.[10][11]\n\n\n\n## Demographics from the 2010 Census[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, 10.9% of the population was non-Hispanic White, 30.1% non-Hispanic Black or African American, 3.4% non-Hispanic Asian, 0.6% from some other race (non-Hispanic) and 1.2% of two or more races (non-Hispanic). 53.5% of Bronx's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race).[12]\n\n\n\n## Demographics from the 2000 Census[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Poverty concentrations in the Bronx.\nAt the 2000 census there were 1,332,650 people, 463,212 households, and 314,984 families residing in the borough of The Bronx in New York City. The population density was 12,242.2/km2 (31,709.3/mi2). There were 490,659 housing units at an average density of 4,507.4/km2 (11,674.8/mi2). The racial makeup of the borough was 35.64% Black or African American, 29.87% White, 0.85% Native American, 3.01% Asian, 0.10% Pacific Islander, 24.74% from other races, and 5.78% from two or more races. 48.38% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 14.5%.[13] were whites, not of Hispanic origins. The Bronx has the largest number of Puerto Ricans of any county in the United States. It also has one of the highest percentages of Dominicans in the U.S. with 14.5%.\n\n\nBased on sample data from the same census, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 47.29% of the population 5 and older speak only English at home. 43.67% speak Spanish at home, either exclusively or along with English. Other languages or groups of languages spoken at home by more than 0.25% of the population of the Bronx include Italian (1.36%), Kru, Ibo, or Yoruba (3.07%), French/French Creole (2.72%), and Albanian (2.54%).\nOf the 463,212 households, 38.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.4% were married couples living together, 30.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.0% were non-families. 27.4% of households were one person, and 9.4% were one person aged 65 or older. The average household size was 2.78 and the average family size was 3.37.\n\n\nIn the borough the population was spread out, with 29.8% under the age of 18, 10.6% from 18 to 24, 30.7% from 25 to 44, 18.8% from 45 to 64, and 10.1% 65 or older. The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females there were 87.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and older, there were 80.7 males.\n\n\nThe median household income was $27,611 and the median family income was $30,682. Males had a median income of $31,178 versus $29,429 for females. The per capita income for the borough was $13,959. About 28.0% of families and 30.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 41.5% of those under age 18 and 21.3% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n\n## White population[edit]\n\n\nOut of all five boroughs, The Bronx has the lowest number and percentage of non Hispanic white residents. At the 2009 American Community Survey, Whites, of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin, represented 24.4% of the population, while non-Hispanic Whites made 12.1% of the population.[14] The 2010 Census puts the percentage of non-Hispanic Whites at 10.9% of the population.\n\n\nThe number of non-Hispanic Whites in the Bronx has been shrinking for decades. People of Irish descent number over 35,500 individuals and make up 2.6% of the population. German Americans and Polish Americans make up 1.4% and 0.8% of the population respectively.\n\n\nSome main European ancestries of Bronx residents, 2000 (percentage of total borough population): \n\n\n\n* Italian : 5.2%\n* Irish : 3.2%\n* Albanian : 2.54%\n* German : 1.3%\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020, the White population declined from 151,209 residents at 10.9% to 130,796 residents at 8.9%, a loss of -20,413 or -13.5%.[15]\n\n\n\n## Black and African American population[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2009 American Community Survey, Black people represented 37.5% of the population, with 30.8% being non-Hispanic Black people.[16]\nOver 526,200 black people reside in the borough, of which 419,600 are non-Hispanic black people. Over 61,000 people identified themselves as \"Sub-Saharan African\" in the survey, making up 4.4% of the population. Those whose ancestors have been in the United States since before the end of slavery are one group. Another is those of Caribbean ancestry. Colin Powell, a son of Jamaican immigrants, grew up in the Bronx. Some people have ancestries from both these groups, and like most African-American communities many people in both these groups have European and Native American ancestry as well. A third group, that is actually more internally diverse than these other two is African immigrants. They hail primarily from West Africa. There is also a small East African/Ethiopian population, mostly in and around Parkchester. The largest numbers come from Nigeria, but other nations such as Liberia, Ghana, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast, to name just a few, have contributed to this population.\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020, the Black population went from 416,695 residents at 30.1% to 419,393 residents at 28.5%, a gain of 2,698 residents or 0.6%. Though their percentage portion dropped slightly due to other racial populations increasing.[15]\n\n\n\n## Native American population[edit]\n\n\nNative Americans are a very small minority in the borough. Only some 5,560 individuals (out of the borough's 1.4 million people) are Native American, which is equal to just 0.4% of the population. In addition, roughly 2,500 people are Native Americans of non-Hispanic origin.\n\n\nHowever a significant amount of the Hispanic population are native but due to the confusion of the census it's not reflected.\n\n\n\n## Asian population[edit]\n\n\nAsians are a small but sizable minority in the borough. At the 2009 American Community Survey 3.8% of Bronx's population was Asian.[17]\n\n\n\n* Indian 1.0%\n* Chinese 0.7%\n* Filipino 0.5%\n* Vietnamese 0.2%\n* Japanese 0.1%\n* Korean 0.1%\n\n\nAlthough having fewer Asians than other borough of New York, there are some Asian groups more numerous in the Bronx than elsewhere in the city. In 2000 the Bronx had the most Cambodians, the only New York borough with over 1000 Cambodians, they numbered 1366 in the Bronx. Asian Indians were the Bronx's most numerous Asian group, numbering 19305. There were 7628 Chinese in the borough, and 5446 Filipinos. Koreans numbered 4076. The total for Vietnamese was 3289 while Bangladeshis were counted at 2442. The only other Asian group numbering over 1000 in the city was the 1727 Pakistanis.[18]\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020, the Asian population went from 47,335 residents at 3.4% to 67,766 residents at 4.6%, a gain of 20,431 residents or 43.2%.[15]\n\n\n\n## Multiracial population[edit]\n\n\nPeople identifying multiracial heritage are also a sizable minority in The Bronx, numbering over 41,800 individuals and represent 3.0% of the population. People of mixed Caucasian and African American heritage number over 6,850 members and form 0.5% of the population. People of mixed Caucasian and Native American heritage number over 2,450 members and form 0.2% of the population. People of mixed Caucasian and Asian heritage number over 880 members and form 0.1% of the population. People of mixed African American and Native American heritage number over 1,220 members and form 0.1% of the population. From 2010 to 2020, the multiracial population went from 15,962 residents at 1.2% to 28,370 residents at 1.9%, a gain of 12,408 residents or 77.7%.[15]\n\n\n\n## Hispanics and Latino population[edit]\n\n\nThe Bronx is the only New York borough with a Hispanic majority. At the 2010 Census, 53.5% of Bronx's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race). At the 2009 American Community Survey, Puerto Ricans represented 23.2% of the borough's population, Mexicans made 5.2%.[17] In 2005, more than 200,000 Dominicans called the Bronx home, other Hispanics such as Salvadorans and Ecuadorians also call the Bronx home,[19] and in 2000 Dominicans comprised 14.5% of the Bronx population.[20] The Puerto Rican population was at its height around 1980 when they represented about 30% of the Bronx, it declined in the 1990s and early 2000s, and it is relatively stagnant now. The Dominican population has been growing heavily since the 1990s. As of 2017, Dominicans made up 22.4% of the Bronx population, while Puerto Ricans made up 19.6%, giving the Bronx some of the highest concentrations of both in the country. Together these 2 groups make up over 75% of the borough's Hispanics.[21]\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020, the Hispanic population went from 741,413 residents at 53.5% to 806,463 residents at 54.8%, a gain of 65,050 residents or 8.8%.[15]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2010, 46.29% (584,463) of Bronx residents age 5 and older spoke Spanish at home as a primary language, while 44.02% (555,767) spoke English, 2.48% (31,361) African languages, 0.91% (11,455) French, 0.90% (11,355) Italian, 0.87% (10,946) various Indic languages, 0.70% (8,836) other Indo-European languages, and Chinese was spoken as a main language by 0.50% (6,610) of the population over the age of five. In total, 55.98% (706,783) of the Bronx's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[22]\n\n\n\n## Immigration[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2009 American Community Survey, 31.9% of Bronx's population was foreign born and another 8.5% was born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or born abroad to American parent(s).[23] During the 1960s, the Bronx transitioned from majority Irish, Italian and Jewish to majority Puerto Rican and African American. However, since around 2000, increases in cost of living in New York and heavy immigration from Latin America and Africa, a new transition has been taking place, with Dominicans now outnumbering Puerto Ricans and African immigrants growing in size to the African American population.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Bronx residents born abroad or overseas, 1930 and 2000** |\n| **1930 United States Census**[24] | **2000 United States Census**[25] |\n| **Total population of the Bronx** | **1,265,258** |  | **Total population of the Bronx** | **1,332,650** |  |\n|  |  |  | ***All born abroad or overseas*** ‡ | **524,410** | ***39.4%*** |\n|  |  |  | Puerto Rico | 126,649 | *9.5%* |\n| ***Foreign-born Whites*** | **477,342** | ***37.7%*** | ***All foreign-born*** | **385,827** | ***29.0%*** |\n| White persons born in Russia | 135,210 | *10.7%* | Dominican Republic | 124,032 | *9.3%* |\n| White persons born in Italy | 67,732 | *5.4%* | Jamaica | 51,120 | *3.8%* |\n| White persons born in Poland | 55,969 | *4.4%* | Mexico | 20,962 | *1.6%* |\n| White persons born in Germany | 43,349 | *3.4%* | Guyana | 14,868 | *1.1%* |\n| White persons born in the Irish Free State † | 34,538 | *2.7%* | Ecuador | 14,800 | *1.1%* |\n| Other foreign birthplaces of Whites | 140,544 | *11.1%* | Other foreign birthplaces | 160,045\n | *12.0%* |\n| † the 26 counties now within the Republic of Ireland |  ‡ beyond the 50 states & District of Columbia |\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** (1) **Population 1920-1990:** Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990, Compiled and edited by Richard L.

(Click on image to see full key and data.)\n\nThe **demographics of Queens**, the second-most populous borough in New York City, are highly diverse. No racial or ethnic group holds a majority in the borough.\n\n\nCoterminous with Queens County since 1899, the borough of Queens is the second-largest in population (behind Brooklyn), with approximately 2.3 million residents in 2013, approximately 48% of them foreign-born;[1] Queens County is also the second most populous county in New York State, behind neighboring Kings County, which is coterminous with the borough of Brooklyn. Queens is the fourth-most densely populated county among New York City's boroughs, as well as in the United States; and if each New York City borough were an independent city, Queens would also be the nation's fourth most populous city, after Los Angeles, Chicago, and Brooklyn.[2] Some say Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## General statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nQueens County  \nHistorical Population Figures[4][5][6]\n| CensusYear | Queens(old) | Nassauportion | Queens(new) | %increase |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1698 | 3,565 |  |  |  |\n| 1771 | 10,980 |  |  |  |\n| 1790 | 16,014 | 9,855 | 6,159 | -\n |\n| 1800 | 16,916 | 10,274 | 6,642 | 7.8%\n |\n| 1810 | 19,336 | 11,892 | 7,444 | 12.1%\n |\n| 1820 | 21,519 | 13,273 | 8,246 | 10.8%\n |\n| 1830 | 22,460 | 13,411 | 9,049 | 9.7%\n |\n| 1840 | 30,324 | 15,844 | 14,480 | 60.0%\n |\n| 1850 | 36,833 | 18,240 | 18,593 | 28.4%\n |\n| 1860 | 57,391 | 24,488 | 32,903 | 77.0%\n |\n| 1870 | 73,803 | 28,335 | 45,468 | 38.2%\n |\n| 1880 | 90,574 | 34,015 | 56,559 | 24.4%\n |\n| 1890 | 128,059 | 41,009 | 87,050 | 53.9%\n |\n| 1900 |  |  | 152,999 | 75.8%\n |\n| 1910 |  |  | 284,041 | 85.6%\n |\n| 1920 |  |  | 469,042 | 65.1%\n |\n| 1930 |  |  | 1,079,129 | 130.1%\n |\n| 1940 |  |  | 1,297,634 | 20.2%\n |\n| 1950 |  |  | 1,550,849 | 19.5%\n |\n| 1960 |  |  | 1,809,578 | 16.7%\n |\n| 1970 |  |  | 1,986,473 | 9.8%\n |\n| 1980 |  |  | 1,891,325 | -4.8%\n |\n| 1990 |  |  | 1,951,598 | 3.2%\n |\n| 2000 |  |  | 2,229,379 | 14.2%\n |\n| 2010 |  |  | 2,230,722 | 0.1%\n |\n| 2020 |  |  | 2,405,464 | 7.8%\n |\n\n\n### 2020s[edit]\n\n\nSince 2021, the population of Queens was estimated by the Census Bureau to have decreased 0.9% to 2,287,390 as of 2021, representing 27.3% of New York City's population, and 11.7% of New York State's population.[7][8][9][10][11] In the 2020 census data from New York City Department of City Planning, there were a total population of 2,405,464 residents. Within the Queens total population, there were 549,358 White residents making up 22.8%, there were 381,375 Black residents making up 15.9%, there were 656,583 Asian residents making up 27.3%, and there were 667,861 Hispanic residents making up 27.8%. Hispanic and Asian populations for the first time in Queens history now are at almost equal populations and together make up the vast majority of the immigrant populations, including being at the top ranks of the population. The Black population is now in the lowest rank of the population proportion while the White population is just second to lowest in the ranking population.[12] Queens tops out in the rank as being the most culturally and racially diverse borough in all of NYC while Brooklyn and Manhattan came in secondarily, however The Bronx and Staten Island fell at the lowest ranking in terms of cultural and racial diversity.[13]\n\n\n\n### 2010s[edit]\n\n\n#### 2013[edit]\n\n\nSince 2010, the population of Queens was estimated by the Census Bureau to have increased 2.9% to 2,296,175 as of 2013, representing 27.3% of New York City's population, and 11.7% of New York State's population.[7][8][9][10][11]\n\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nAccording to 2012 census estimates, 27.2% of the population was White,[14] 20.9% Black or African American, 24.8% Asian, 12.9% from some other race, and 2.7% of two or more races. 27.9% of Queens's population was of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race).[15]\n\n\n\n#### 2010[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, 39.7% of the population was White, 19.1% Black or African American, 22.9% Asian, 13.7% from some other race, and 4.5% of two or more races. 27.5% of Queens's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race).\n\n\n\n### 2000s[edit]\n\n\n#### 2009[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2009 American Community Survey, whites made up 46.1% of Queens' population, of which 30.2% were non-Hispanic whites.

A significant amount of the European American population is of Italian and Irish descent. Sizable populations of Germans and Poles are also present, as well as Greeks, Albanians, Serbs, Bosnians, and Russians. The White population in Queens is mainly concentrated in neighborhoods such as Astoria, Forest Hills, Rego Park, Glendale, Maspeth, Middle Village, Howard Beach,  Kew Gardens, Kew Gardens Hills, Bayside, Whitestone, Douglaston, Little Neck, Glen Oaks, Breezy Point and Belle Harbor. The top ten European ancestries are the following:\n\n\n\n* Italian: 7.7% (178,080)\n* Irish: 5.0% (115,345)\n* German: 3.5% (79,917)\n* Polish: 2.9% (66,718)\n* Greek: 2.3% (53,342)\n* Russian: 2.1% (47,842)\n* English: 1.0% (23,550)\n* French: 0.6% (14,913)\n* Hungarian: 0.5% (10,658)\n* Ukrainian: 0.4% (9,405)\n\n\nThe White and European population declined from 616,727 residents at 27.6% in 2010 to 549,358 residents at 22.8% in 2020, a loss of -67,369 or -10.9%.

Over 434,300 black people reside in Queens, of which some 406,000 are non-Hispanic. In addition, 23,527 people identified themselves as \"Sub-Saharan African\" in the survey, which is equal to 1.0% of the population. Black people are the majority in Queensbridge and LeFrak City but primarily concentrated in the Southeast Queens neighborhoods of South Jamaica, Springfield Gardens, Hollis, Laurelton, Cambria Heights, Locust Manor, St. Albans, Rosedale, and Far Rockaway.\n\n\nThe Black and African American population declined from 395,881 residents at 17.7% in 2010 to 381,375 residents at 15.9% in 2020, a loss of -14,506 residents or -3.7%.[17]\n\n\n\n## Native American population[edit]\n\n\nNative Americans are a very small minority in Queens.

However, people who identify as Native American with another racial group (and those who are Native American alone) make up 1.1% of the population, which is roughly 25,700 people.\n\n\n\n## Asian population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Queens Library in Flushing Chinatown\nAsians have a large presence in Queens, and Queens has the largest Asian American population by county outside the Western United States; according to the 2006 American Community Survey, Queens ranks fifth among US counties, with 477,772 Asian Americans making up 21.18% of the population. Over one-in-five residents (22.0%) are of Asian descent. Over 506,000 Asians live in the borough. The bulk of this group are composed of people of Chinese, Indian, Korean, and Filipino descent. Asians are numerous throughout the borough but most concentrated in Northeastern and Central Queens in areas such as Flushing, Little Neck, Bayside, Fresh Meadows, Jamaica Estates, Elmhurst, Woodside, Richmond Hill, and Ozone Park.

Similarly, it also has a visible presence of Bangladeshi Americans with a population of 88,310 (0.82% of the borough's population) and Pakistani Americans with a population of 75,604 ( 0.7% of the borough's population). There is also a large population of Afghan Americans, which reside predominantly in Flushing and Jackson Heights, and there is also a large portion of Arab Americans which live in Astoria concentrated in and around Steinway, with groups of Moroccan Americans, Egyptian Americans, Lebanese Americans, Algerian Americans and Syrian Americans.

Whites (both Hispanic and non-Hispanic) number near 1.3 million individuals, and there are nearly 1,150,000 non-Hispanic whites residing in Brooklyn. Brooklyn's European American population mainly consists of ethnic Europeans who are either from or descendants from Eastern and Southern European countries of Italy, Russia, Poland, Albania, and former Soviet Union countries, as well as Ireland, Germany and Scandinavia. Northwest and the Southern half sections of Brooklyn are predominantly European American communities, and most of the borough's European American residents are of the Catholic or Jewish faith. Amongst Catholics, Italian Americans are the predominant ethnic group in neighborhoods such as Bensonhurst, Dyker Heights, Bay Ridge, Bath Beach, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Williamsburg, East Williamsburg, Bergen Beach, and Mill Basin. Polish Americans are the predominant ethnic group in neighborhoods such as Greenpoint (\"Little Poland\") and Greenwood Heights; Russian Americans are the predominant ethnic group in neighborhoods such as Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay; and Irish Americans are the predominant ethnic group in neighborhoods such as Bay Ridge, Gerritsen Beach, and Marine Park. Brooklyn is 22.4% Jewish[12] with Jews being the predominant ethnic group in neighborhoods such as Borough Park, Williamsburg, Midwood, Ocean Parkway, a portion of Crown Heights, and a portion of Flatbush.\n\n\nNeighborhoods surrounding Bedford-Stuyvesant such as Ocean Hill, Brownsville, Bushwick, Crown Heights, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Flatbush, East Flatbush, Canarsie, and East New York were previously overwhelmingly majority Jewish and Italian with Germans and Irish in some sections in early-mid 20th century, but in the later part of the 20th century they slowly shifted into majority Black communities with a few Puerto Rican communities interspersed in Bushwick and a portion of East New York.[13] Though Bedford-Stuyvesant itself at one point in the early part of the 20th century did have large Italian and Jewish populations.[14][15] However, a section of Crown Heights and a section of Flatbush still have significant remaining small Jewish enclaves.[16][17][18] A subsection neighborhood of East New York called Starrett City or Spring Creek still have significant scattered numbers of European Americans.[19] However, in recent decades since the 2000s and especially since the 2010s, the White population has started to rapidly regrow in Bedford Stuyvesant, Crown Heights, Bushwick, and Flatbush, which these areas are undergoing gentrification.[20][21]\n\n\nAccording to the 2009 American Community Survey, the six most common European ancestries were the following.[22]\n\n\nAs according to the 2020 census data, the White European American population in Brooklyn increased from 893,306 residents at 35.7% in 2010 to 968,427 residents at 35.4% in 2020 a gain of 75,121 residents or 8.4%, though the percentage portion of White residents out of the total population of Brooklyn slightly declined due to other racial populations increasing adding to the population.[23]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Ancestry\n | Number\n | % of total population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Italian | 157,068\n | 6.1%\n |\n| Irish | 100,923\n | 3.9%\n |\n| Russian | 88,766\n | 3.5%\n |\n| Polish | 71,099\n | 2.8%\n |\n| German | 53,188\n | 2.1%\n |\n| English | 36,174\n | 1.4%\n |\n\n\n### African Americans[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2009 American Community Survey, African Americans made up over one-third (34.2%) of Brooklyn's population. There are over 877,000 African Americans residing in Brooklyn. The historical cultural center of the borough has long been Bedford-Stuyvesant; African Americans became a majority in Bedford-Stuyvesant in the 1930s following the construction of the A line subway between Harlem and Bedford. Bedford-Stuyvesant was the first large African American community to be established in Brooklyn back then.[24] After Bedford-Stuyvesant had largely developed into an African American community in the 1930s-40s, neighborhoods surrounding Bedford-Stuyvesant in Northern and Eastern Brooklyn such as Ocean Hill, Brownsville, Crown Heights, Flatbush, Canarsie, East Flatbush, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, East New York, and Fort Greene had continued to be mostly home to Italian and Jewish enclaves with some Germans and Irish intermixed in even though some of the growing African American population also did spillover into some of these neighborhoods, however through the processes of a Ripple effect, a Domino effect, and a Snowball effect, starting in the 1950s and throughout the remaining 20th century, these surrounding neighborhoods became the next following areas to slowly transition to majority African American communities going through neighborhood by neighborhood and going through decade by decade, though large West Indian Black communities have also emerged and intertwined in some of these areas. As a result, a very large portion of the northern half of Brooklyn are dominantly populated by African Americans with large West Indian Black populations intertwined in, though Crown Heights and Flatbush continue to have remaining small significant Jewish communities.[25] The roads of Eastern Parkway, Malcolm X Boulevard, Kings Highway, Broadway, Atlantic Avenue, Linden Boulevard, Flatlands Avenue and Jackie Robinson Parkway connect all of these neighborhoods to the point of being very comparatively similar to the city of Newark, New Jersey in terms of the geographic size and the dominantly Black communities.[26][27] Coney Island, which is another Brooklyn neighborhood very far into the very southern tip of Brooklyn also has a significant African American population. Together these neighborhoods have a population of about 940,000 and are roughly 82% African American, making it the largest African-American community in the United States.[28] However, the 2020 census data showed that the Black population in NYC has declined from 1,861,295 residents at 22.8% in 2010 to 1,776,891 residents at 20.2% in 2020 with a loss of -84,404 resident or -4.5%, however, Brooklyn itself had the sharpest declines of the Black population of all of the NYC boroughs going from 799,066 residents at 31.9% in 2010 to 729,696 residents at 26.7% in 2020 with a loss of -69,370 residents at -8.7%. In all of Brooklyn, the Black population was the only population to suffer significant declines while all other populations of racial groups experienced increases. Many of the Black neighborhoods in northern Brooklyn such as Bedford Stuyvesant, Crown Heights, Ocean Hill, and Flatbush are now undergoing gentrification and experiencing rapid increasing regaining population of White residents, which are wealthier professionals instead of the working class European immigrants and European Americans that were previously majority populations in these neighborhoods.[29] Fort Greene, which has been a majority Black neighborhood since the 1970s though with some significant mixtures of Hispanic and White residents and very limited Asian residents has re-transitioned back to a White population majority since the 2010s though significant amount of Black residents still remain with now a slow increasing population of Asian and Hispanic residents; the last time Fort Greene had a White majority population was back in the 1960s-70s.[30][31][32][33][34][35][36]\n\n\n\n### Caribbean Americans[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 US Census data on brooklyn.com there are approximately 370,000 (16.4%) Caribbean descendants in Brooklyn. That figure includes persons who identify with the Dominican Republic (3.3%), but does not include the (7.4%) Puerto Rican population. Including Puerto Ricans there are approximately 560,000 (23.8%) persons of Caribbean descent in Brooklyn. Similar, but not identical demographics in America can be found in Miami, but there are not as many Cubans in New York. A large population of Brooklyn's Caribbean decedents are of Trinidadian, Jamaican, Barbadian, Haitian, Saint Lucians and Guyanese immigrants. As of 2017, between the neighborhoods of Flatbush, East Flatbush, and Crown Heights, it has been given a nickname called, *Little Caribbean* due to the large concentrations of Caribbean populations.[37][38][39] The adjacent neighborhood Canarsie is also another large Caribbean neighborhood, which emerged more towards the late 1990s whereas the Caribbean communities of East Flatbush, Flatbush, and Crown Heights developed much earlier around the 1960s-70s.[40]\n\n\n\n### Hispanics and Latinos[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2009 American Community Survey, Hispanics and Latinos made up nearly one-fifth (19.6%) of Brooklyn's population. Over 500,000 Hispanics and Latinos reside in Brooklyn. Nearly 190,000 Puerto Ricans call the borough home, and they make up 7.4% of the population. The borough's 91,000 Mexican Americans make up 3.6% of its population. Many neighborhoods in the very Northern parts of Brooklyn are home to a high number of Hispanics mainly from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Central America. Hispanics are mainly concentrated in neighborhoods in the North Central and Northeast sections of Brooklyn, though there are some spillovers of the Hispanic population into Northwestern Brooklyn such as Williamsburg.[41] Hispanics have become the majority in former African-American neighborhoods such as Bushwick, East Williamsburg and Cypress Hills. Sunset Park, in South Brooklyn is also home to a large Hispanic community. Since the 2000s, especially since the 2010s, other southern Brooklyn neighborhoods such as Dyker Heights, Gravesend, and especially in Bensonhurst and Bay Ridge have started to receive significant growing Hispanic populations as well though are more mixed in with the populations of predominantly White Americans and Asian Americans.[42][43][44][45]\n\n\nThe 2020 census data showed that Brooklyn's Hispanic population increased from 496,285 residents at 19.8% in 2010 to 516,426 residents at 18.9% a gain of 20,141 residents or 4.1%, though as other racial populations increased in the borough, the Hispanic population percentage portion decreased slightly.[46][47]\n\n\n\n![](image)Brooklyn Chinatown\n### Asian Americans[edit]\n\n\nOver 243,000 Asians live in the borough. The most numerous Asian American group are those of Chinese descent. Chinese Americans make up 6.4% of the borough's population, and they number over 163,000 individuals. Much of Brooklyn's Asian population is concentrated in Southern Brooklyn neighborhoods such as Sunset Park (\"Brooklyn's Chinatown\"), Homecrest, Sheepshead Bay (\"Avenue U Chinatown\") and Bensonhurst. (\"Bensonhurst Chinatown\")[48] The Chinese were second only to Queens among New York boroughs, meaning Manhattan's Chinatown is no longer the main residence of Chinese in the city. Initially, Sunset Park was the primary destination for the newly arriving Chinese immigrants, many fleeing from the original Manhattan's Chinatown during the 1980s-90s and most of them were Cantonese speaking immigrants creating the original Brooklyn's Chinatown, however since the 2000s, a large influx of Fuzhou speaking immigrants have become the largest Chinese group population in Sunset Park expanding the Sunset Park Chinatown dramatically and now being given the name, *Brooklyn's Little Fuzhou* and since then, Cantonese speaking immigrants in Brooklyn including new arrivals have been dramatically shifting to and concentrating in Bensonhurst and Sheepshead Bay/Homecrest creating newer Chinatowns of Brooklyn or *Brooklyn's Little Hong Kong/Guangdong*.[49][50][51][52]\n\n\nApproximately 19,851 Asian Indians live in Brooklyn. Approximately 9,681 Filipino Americans live in Brooklyn. Approximately 6,977 Korean Americans reside here. Brooklyn has the most Vietnamese Americans of any borough, they numbered over 5,700 individuals. The 4,704 Japanese Americans rounded out Asian American groups with over 1,000 people in Brooklyn.\n\n\nThere is a sizable Pakistani American community in the Midwood section of Brooklyn[53] and there is a \"Little Pakistan\" on Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn.[54] Pakistanis are concentrated heavily in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, and are one of the fastest growing Asian ethnic groups in Brooklyn .[55] Pakistanis number around 30,000 and counting in Brooklyn and their community is growing rapidly. Many halal restaurants, fabric stores, Pakistani clothing stores and mosques are centered on Coney Island Avenue.[56]\n\n\nCurrently, the Brooklyn Asian enclaves are scattered and intertwined with the predominant European American communities in southern Brooklyn. Many Bangladeshis are now living here\n\n\nThe 2020 census data showed that the Asian population grew the fastest of all racial groups in Brooklyn going from 260,129 residents at 10.4% in 2010 to 370,776 residents at 13.6% in 2020 with a gain of 110,647 residents or 42.5% [57]\n\n\n\n### Arab Americans[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Bay Ridge currently holds the highest percentage of Arab Americans, with its main thoroughfare being 5th avenue. Other neighborhoods include Boerum Hill, which historically held the largest Yemeni population, but now many Yemeni Americans have moved to Bay Ridge due to the increase of rent in Boerum Hill. Bensonhurst, Bath Beach, parts of Sunset Park, Dyker Heights Park Slope, and East New York also hold a large amount of Arab Americans.\n\n\n\n![](image)Brooklyn has been the city's largest borough since the mid-1920s. (Key: Each borough's historical population in millions. **The Bronx**, **Brooklyn**, **Manhattan**, **Queens**, **Staten Island**)\n## Language[edit]\n\n\nBrooklyn has a high degree of linguistic diversity. As of 2010, 54.12% (1,240,416) of Brooklyn residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 17.16% (393,340) spoke Spanish, 6.46% (148,012) Chinese, 5.31% (121,607) Russian, 3.47% (79,469) Yiddish, 2.75% (63,019) French Creole, 1.35% (31,004) Italian, 1.20% (27,440) Hebrew, 1.01% (23,207) Polish, 0.99% (22,763) French, 0.95% (21,773) Arabic, 0.85% (19,388) various Indic languages, 0.99% (22,763) Turkish, 0.70% (15,936) Urdu, and African languages were spoken as a main language by 0.54% (12,305) of the population over the age of five. In total, 45.88% (1,051,456) of Brooklyn's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[58]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Furman, Gabriel; Royster, Paul (2006-03-21). \"\"Notes Geographical and Historical, relating to the Town of Brooklyn, i\" by Gabriel Furman and Paul Royster (transcriber & depositor)\". *Faculty Publications, Unl Libraries*.

The vast majority of the borough's African American and Hispanic residents live north of the Staten Island Expressway, or Interstate 278.\n\n\n\n### 2009 American community survey[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n**Staten Island Population by year**\n| \n\n| Year\n | Inhabitants\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900 | 67,021\n |\n| 1910 | 85,969\n |\n| 1920 | 116,531\n |\n| 1930 | 158,346\n |\n| 1940 | 174,441\n |\n| 1950 | 191,555\n |\n| 1960 | 221,991\n |\n| 1970 | 295,443\n |\n| 1980 | 352,029\n |\n| 1990 | 378,977\n |\n| 2000 | 443,728\n |\n| 2010 | 468,730\n |\n| 2020 | 475,000\n |\n\n |\n\n\nAccording to the 2009 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau,[2] Staten Island had a population 491,730, of which 48.7% were males and 51.3% were females. Approximately 6.0% of the population was under five years of age, and 76.9% of the populace was over eighteen years of age. One-eighth (12.5%) of the population was over sixty-five years of age. The median age was 38.4 years.\n\n\nIn terms of race, 98.1% of the population was of one race and 1.9% was of two or more races. The borough's population was 75.7% White (65.8% non-Hispanic White alone), 10.2% Black or African American (9.6% non-Hispanic Black or African American alone), 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 7.4% Asian, 0.0% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 4.6% from Some other race, and 1.9% from Two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up 15.9% of the population.\n\n\nWhites were the racial majority in Staten Island. Of the borough's 491,000 people, over 382,000 were white, which was over three-quarters (75.7%) of the population. Over 323,000 non-Hispanic whites reside in the borough, and they make up 65.8% of the population. The Caucasian population was largely Italian and Irish. Sizable communities of Germans, Russians, Albanians and Poles were present. There were over 175,000 Italian Americans living in Staten Island, and they make up over one-third (35.7%) of the population. Roughly 65,000 Irish Americans live in the borough, and they make up over one-eighth (13.2%) of the population. People of German, Russian, and Polish descent make up 5.7, 3.8, and 3.4% of the population, respectively.\n\n\nCompared to other New York City boroughs, Blacks were a relatively small percentage of Staten Island's residents. Only one out of every ten residents was Black compared to one out of every four residents in New York City overall. Of the borough's 50,000 Black residents, 47,000 were non-Hispanic, which was just under ten percent of the population. In addition, over 7,200 people identified themselves as \"Sub-Saharan African\" in the survey, which was equal to 1.5% of Staten Island's total population.\n\n\nAmerican Indians were a very small minority in Staten Island. Of the borough's 491,000 inhabitants, just over 900 were Native American. Overall, indigenous peoples make up only 0.2% of the population. People of mixed white and Native American ancestry & mixed black and Native American ancestry collectively outnumber people who were Native American alone. Over 630 people were of mixed Caucasian and Native American heritage, and over 410 people were of mixed African American and Native American heritage.\n\n\nAsians were a smaller minority group compared to blacks and Hispanics, but they were visible and growing. Over 36,600 Asians call Staten Island home, and they represent 7.4% of the borough's population. Chinese Americans and Indian Americans were the two main Asian ethnic groups. Over 12,100 Chinese Americans and 10,000 Indian Americans live in the conurbation. People of Chinese and Indian descent make up 2.5 and 2.0% of the population, respectively. Over 7,700 Filipinos reside here, making up 1.6% of the population. Staten Island was also home to the nations highest percentages of Sri Lankans. The **Little Sri Lanka** in the Tompkinsville neighborhood of Staten Island was one of the largest Sri Lankan communities outside of the country of Sri Lanka itself.[3][4]\n\n\nHispanics and Latinos were the largest minority group in Staten Island, and they're the second largest group after non-Hispanic whites. Over 78,000 Hispanics and Latinos live in the borough, and they make up 15.9% of the population. Puerto Ricans were the most numerous of the Hispanic subgroups; the borough's 35,600 Puerto Ricans make up 7.2% of its population. In addition, the borough's 15,300 Mexicans make up 3.1% of its population; over 1,200 Cubans form just 0.3% of Staten Island's population. In addition, over 26,100 people were of other Hispanic and Latino ethnicities, such as Dominican, Salvadoran, Ecuadorian etc.\n\n\nApproximately 80.0% of the population was native and 20.0% was foreign-born. About 78.2% of the population was born in the United States, and 1.8% was born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or abroad to American parents. The 98,000 foreign-born make up one-fifth of the population. Approximately 34.7% of the foreign-born population was born in Europe, 29.4% was born in Asia, 27.6% was born in Latin America, 7.8% was born in Africa, 0.4% was born in other parts of North America, and 0.1% was born in Oceania.\n\n\nApproximately 71.4% of the population over five years of age spoke English only at home, so 28.6% of the population spoke non-English languages. In addition, 10.1% of the population spoke Spanish, and 12.1% spoke other Indo-European languages. Lastly, 4.6% of the populace spoke an Asian language.\n\n\n\n### 2010 census[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, 64.0% of the population was non-Hispanic White, 9.5%[1] non-Hispanic Black or African American, 0.0% non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native, 7.4% non-Hispanic Asian, 0.2% from some other race (non-Hispanic) and 2.6% of two or more races (non-Hispanic). 17.3% of Staten Island's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin.\n\n\n\n### 2020 census[edit]\n\n\nOut of all of the boroughs of NYC, Staten Island has the lowest population concentration and as of the 2020 census data from New York City Department of City Planning, there were a total population of 495,747 residents with 277,981 White residents making up 56.1%, 96,960 Hispanic residents making up 19.6%, 58,753 Asian residents making up 11.9%, and 46,835 Black residents making up 9.4%. Through most of the 20th century, NYC has long been dominantly populated by European American White enclaves, but starting in the 1970s and moving forward, there was a rapid increasing changing cultural and racial diversity in the city and by the 1980s going forward, Non-White enclaves became the dominant majority of the city while the overall white population fell under 50% including in each other borough, however Staten Island is the only and last borough of NYC that is still retaining a more than 50% White European American majority despite the increasing cultural and racial diversity.[5][6][7][8] However, Staten Island's White population has been steadily declining from 300,169 residents at 64.0% in 2010 to 277,981 at 56.1% in 2020, a loss of -22,188 or -7.4%, meanwhile other racial populations are increasing with the Black population increasing from 44,313 residents at 9.5% in 2010 to 46,835 residents at 9.4% in 2020, a gain of 2,522 residents or 5.7%, though due to other racial population increases in the borough, the percentage portion of the Black residents out of the total Staten Island population slightly declined, the Hispanic population went from 81,051 residents at 17.3% in 2010 to 96,960 residents at 19.6%, a gain of 15,909 residents or 19.6%, and the Asian population experienced the largest increase from 34,697 residents at 7.4% in 2010 to 58,753 residents at 11.9% in 2020, a gain of 24,056 residents or 69.3%.[9]\n\n\n\n## Major racial groups[edit]\n\n\n### Italian Americans[edit]\n\n\nStaten Island has a higher percentage of Italian Americans than any other county in the United States, though it is 27th largest compared to other Italian American communities.[10]\n\n\nAbout 35.7% of Staten Island's residents have Italian origin. The South Shore of Staten Island has the highest proportion of Italians. Nearly 80% of the South Shore reports Italian ancestry. Several neighborhoods in the southernmost portion of the island are over 90% Italian.[2]\n\n\nA large number of Italian Americans and their descendants on Staten Island are transplants who migrated from Brooklyn in the 1960s following the construction of the Verrazzano Bridge. Only a few are Italian-born.\n\n\n\n### Asian Americans[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, Staten Island has a 7.4% non-Hispanic Asian population. The Asian population was mostly concentrated in the areas alongside the Staten Island Expressway. The area around Bradley Avenue has the highest concentration of Asians on Staten Island (Census tract 187.02 has a 24% Asian population, and census tract 189.02 has a 23% Asian population). Other areas with a small concentration of Asians were Graniteville, Willowbrook, Concord, Castleton Corners, Park Hill, Rosebank, South Beach, and Grasmere. There was also a small Asian concentration in Mariners' Harbor (Census Tract 231 was 13% Asian).[11]\n\n\n\n### Hispanic Americans[edit]\n\n\nStaten Island's Hispanic population was 17.3% as of the 2010 census. While Hispanics can be found in most Staten Island neighborhoods, their concentrations were highest north of the Staten Island Expressway. Roughly half of Staten Island's Hispanics were of Puerto Rican descent. However, the majority of the Hispanics residing in the Port Richmond area were Mexican:[12]\n\n\nThere were 2 census tracts with a Hispanic majority. Census tract 207 in northern Port Richmond was 53% Hispanic, and census tract 133.02 in northern West Brighton was 51% Hispanic. Census tract 213 in Port Richmond was 45% Hispanic, though the Hispanic percentage was brought down due to the area east of Port Richmond Avenue being majority White (though with a noticeable Hispanic presence). Other neighborhoods with a large Hispanic population include Mariners' Harbor, Arlington, Elm Park, Graniteville, New Brighton, St. George, Ward Hill, Stapleton, Park Hill, and Rosebank.\n\n\nHispanics were the fastest growing ethnic group on Staten Island. The Hispanic population has increased 51% between the 2000 & 2010 census.\n\n\n\n### African Americans[edit]\n\n\nStaten Island has the lowest percentage of Black residents as of the 2010 census, at only 9.5%. Most African Americans reside north of the Staten Island Expressway. The only census tracts having Black majorities were tracts 319.01, 319.02, and 133.01. Tract 133.01 is the West Brighton Houses (though a few residential homes along Alaska Street were also included), and census tracts 319.01 & 319.02 were in the western portion of Mariners' Harbor (Tract 319.02 was often referred to as Arlington). Back in 2000, tracts 4 & 29 in Park Hill/Stapleton had a Black majority, but that was no longer the case, due to an increasing Hispanic and Asian population in the area.\n\n\nSome other areas had a noticeable Black presence, although Blacks do not make up the majority (or even a plurality in most cases). These neighborhoods include Mariners' Harbor, Elm Park, Port Richmond, West New Brighton, New Brighton, St. George, Tompkinsville, Stapleton, Ward Hill, Park Hill & Sandy Ground as well as a growing population in Graniteville.\n\n\nWhile many African Americans living on Staten Island were descendants of Southern-born migrants of The Great Migration, a small contingent of free African Americans settled in Sandy Ground in the 1830s. Aside from this, others were American-born transplants from other boroughs and Southern and Midwestern states. Others were immigrants, or descendants of immigrants, from West Africa and the Caribbean.\n\n\nThe island houses more Liberians than anywhere outside Liberia,[13] and has included three Liberian heads of state: David D. Kpormakpor, Ruth Perry, and George Weah.\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2010, 70.39% (306,310) of Staten Island residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 10.02% (43,587) spoke Spanish, 3.14% (13,665) Russian, 3.11% (13,542) Italian, 2.39% (10,412) Chinese, 1.81% (7,867) other Indo-European languages, 1.38% (5,990) Arabic, 1.01% (4,390) Polish, 0.88% (3,812) Korean, 0.80% (3,500) Tagalog, 0.76% (3,308) other Asian languages, 0.62% (2,717) Urdu, 0.57% (2,479) other Indic languages, and African languages were spoken as a main language by 0.56% (2,458) of the population over the age of five. In total, 29.61% (128,827) of Staten Island's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[14]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nIn terms of religion, the population is largely Roman Catholic, and the Catholic Church exerts strong influence on many aspects of the island's social and cultural life. The Jewish community is large enough that it would be significant in most other parts of the country, but it is slightly less numerous compared to other parts of the New York Metropolitan Area.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"United States Census Quick Facts: Richmond County, New York\".
