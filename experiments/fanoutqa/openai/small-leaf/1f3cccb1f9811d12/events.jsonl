Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFourteen national parks are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS),[6] and 21 national parks are named UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BR),[7] with eight national parks in both programs.\n\n\nThirty states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The state with the most national parks is California with nine, followed by Alaska with eight, Utah with five, and Colorado with four. The largest national park is Wrangell–St. Elias in Alaska: at over 8 million acres (32,375 km2), it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri, at 192.83 acres (0.7804 km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52.4 million acres (212,000 km2), for an average of 833 thousand acres (3,370 km2) but a median of only 220 thousand acres (890 km2).[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n82. **^** \"Lake Clark National Park\".

The 17th century brought fur traders and other European explorers, while the 19th century saw an influx of summer visitors, then wealthy families. Many conservation-minded citizens, among them George B. Dorr (the \"Father of Acadia National Park\"), worked to establish this first U.S. national park east of the Mississippi River and the only one in the Northeastern United States. Acadia was initially designated Sieur de Monts National Monument by proclamation of President Woodrow Wilson in 1916, then renamed and redesignated Lafayette National Park in 1919. The park was renamed Acadia National Park in 1929.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Jonah crabs inhabit intertidal and subtidal zones\nThe ecological zones at Acadia National Park, from highest to lowest elevation, include: nearly barren mountain summits; northern boreal and eastern deciduous forests on the mountainsides; freshwater lakes and ponds, as well as wetlands like marshes and swamps in the valleys between mountains; and the Atlantic shoreline with rocky and sandy beaches, intertidal and subtidal zones.[54]\n\n\nTiny subalpine plants grow in the granite joints on mountaintops and on the downwind side of rocks. Stunted, gnarled trees also survive near the summits. Spruce-fir boreal forests cover much of the park. Stands of oak, maple, beech, and other hardwoods more typical of New England represent the eastern deciduous forest. Pitch pines and scrub oaks inhabit isolated forests at their northeastern range limit, while jack pines reach the southern limit of their range in Acadia.[54]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** Prins, Harald E.

The fire began along Crooked Road west of Hulls Cove (northwest of Bar Harbor). The forest fire was one of a series of fires that consumed much of Maine's forest in a dry year. The fire burned until November 14, and was fought by the Coast Guard, Army Air Corps, Navy, local residents, and National Park Service employees from around the country. Sixty-seven of the historic summer cottages along Millionaires’ Row, along with 170 other homes, and five hotels were destroyed. Restoration of the park was substantially supported by the Rockefeller family. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Mount Desert Island section of the park harbors more than half of the vascular plant species occurring in Maine.[4] Plant, algal, and fungal specimens collected during research activities at the park are deposited for future study at a herbarium jointly administered by the park and the College of the Atlantic.[58] A special garden called *The Wild Gardens of Acadia* was established in the Sieur de Monts area of the park in 1961 and has since grown to include more than 400 indigenous plant species found throughout all park areas.[59]\n\n\n\n### Fauna[edit]\n\n\nThe park's wide variety of natural habitats provides homes for many different animal species. The coastal location also encourages a large number of species; however, the small size and isolation of these habitats from mainland habitats limits the types of animals, especially their size. Smaller animals are better adapted to smaller habitats which makes them more common and easily observed than larger ones such as black bears and moose.[60]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Acadia Youth Conservation Corps was established by FOA and endowed by an anonymous donor in 1999 to employ 16 high school students in maintenance of trails and carriage roads in the summer months.[93] FOA also partnered with park administration to establish the Acadia Youth Technology Team in 2011,[91] an initiative involving local teenaged interns and college-age team leaders supplied with professional-quality imaging tools to foster an appreciation of nature and environmental stewardship, especially among younger people.[94] The team has since been renamed the Acadia Digital Media Team.[95]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nFrenchman Bay with Bar Island on the left and the Porcupine Islands around the town of Bar Harbor from the summit of Cadillac Mountain\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Maine portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe park hosts the annual Acadia Night Sky Festival, attracting speakers, researchers, photographers, and artists to the area.[81][82]\n\n\n\n## Current issues and challenges[edit]\n\n\n### Congestion[edit]\n\n\nPark attendance increased to 3.53 million in 2018, setting a new record for the second year in a row. The seasonal nature of the park means a concentration of visitors in the summer months that is beyond the capacity of park infrastructure. Congestion leads to lack of available parking and gridlock, requiring road closures. Traffic management places a toll on available rangers, competing with rescue operations that also see a sharp increase on peak attendance days.[83]\n\n\nThe Island Explorer bus system is offered in part to reduce congestion; it has served 7.7 million passengers since it began operations in 1999. A portion of park entrance fees partially funds the service.[84]\n\n\n\n### Environmental changes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe name of the park was changed to Acadia National Park on January 19, 1929, in honor of the former French colony of Acadia which once included Maine.[2] In 1929 Schoodic Peninsula was donated to Acadia by John Godfrey Moore's second wife Louise and daughters Ruth and Faith. Keeping up with the taxes on the Schoodic land became a drain on the family finances and they thought this world be a fitting way to honor John Godfrey Moore. There was an unspoken stipulation in the discussions — the heirs were anglophiles that did not want to have their land as part of Lafayette National Park. Conservationist George Dorr, who is referred to as the \"Father of Acadia National Park\", suggested the name Acadia, and the deal went through after the name changed, ensuring the expansion.[35][36]\n\n\n\n![](image)Carriage road with \"Rockefeller's Teeth\" (granite coping stones).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n52. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ![Public Domain](image) This article incorporates public domain material from *Written in Acadia's Rocks*.

The Wabanaki Confederacy (\"People of the Dawnland\") consists of five related Algonquian nations—the Maliseet, Mi'kmaq, Passamaquoddy, Abenaki and Penobscot. Some of the nations call Mount Desert Island *Pemetic* (\"range of mountains\"), which has remained at the center of the Wabanaki traditional ancestral homeland and territory of traditional stewardship responsibility to the present day.[21] The etymology of the park's name begins with the Mi'kmaq term *akadie* (\"piece of land\") which was rendered as *l'Acadie* by French explorers, and translated into English as Acadia.[22]\n\n\nThe Wabanaki traveled to the island in birch bark canoes to hunt, fish, gather berries, harvest clams and basket-making resources like sweetgrass, and to trade with other Wabanakis. They camped near places like Somes Sound.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_eM15g03btVzczYWShULRngSW","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The record high temperature was 99 °F (37 °C) in 2002, while the coldest temperature recorded is −66 °F (−54 °C) in 1933.[11] During the summer months of June to early September, daytime highs are normally in the 70 to 80 °F (21 to 27 °C) range, while nighttime lows can go to below freezing (0 °C), especially at higher altitudes. Summer afternoons are frequently accompanied by thunderstorms. Spring and fall temperatures range between 30 and 60 °F (−1 and 16 °C) with nights in the teens to single digits (−5 to −20 °C). Winter in Yellowstone is accompanied by high temperatures usually between 0 and 20 °F (−18 and −7 °C) and nighttime temperatures below 0 °F (−18 °C) for most of the winter.[152]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Yellowstone Lake, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1904–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 48(9)\n | 49(9)\n | 60(16)\n | 73(23)\n | 78(26)\n | 84(29)\n | 92(33)\n | 91(33)\n | 89(32)\n | 76(24)\n | 63(17)\n | 52(11)\n | 92(33)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 37.2(2.9)\n | 40.7(4.8)\n | 49.9(9.9)\n | 56.3(13.5)\n | 66.6(19.2)\n | 75.6(24.2)\n | 81.2(27.3)\n | 81.1(27.3)\n | 76.4(24.7)\n | 64.6(18.1)\n | 49.0(9.4)\n | 37.3(2.9)\n | 82.7(28.2)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 23.2(−4.9)\n | 26.7(−2.9)\n | 35.0(1.7)\n | 41.5(5.3)\n | 50.4(10.2)\n | 60.8(16.0)\n | 71.2(21.8)\n | 70.9(21.6)\n | 61.4(16.3)\n | 46.0(7.8)\n | 32.6(0.3)\n | 23.6(−4.7)\n | 45.3(7.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 13.3(−10.4)\n | 15.1(−9.4)\n | 22.9(−5.1)\n | 30.4(−0.9)\n | 39.7(4.3)\n | 48.5(9.2)\n | 56.9(13.8)\n | 56.2(13.4)\n | 47.7(8.7)\n | 35.6(2.0)\n | 23.7(−4.6)\n | 15.4(−9.2)\n | 33.8(1.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 3.3(−15.9)\n | 3.5(−15.8)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 38.8(99)\n | 40.1(102)\n | 28.7(73)\n | 7.2(18)\n | 0.1(0.25)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.5(1.3)\n | 4.5(11)\n | 12.9(33)\n | 27.3(69)\n | 43.3(110)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 14.1\n | 13.0\n | 12.2\n | 11.9\n | 12.7\n | 13.2\n | 9.0\n | 8.9\n | 9.5\n | 10.1\n | 12.0\n | 15.2\n | 141.8\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 13.8\n | 12.5\n | 11.3\n | 8.6\n | 2.4\n | 0.5\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.6\n | 4.1\n | 10.7\n | 15.4\n | 79.9\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA[165] |\n| Source 2: National Weather Service[166] |\n\n## Recreation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Trails of Yellowstone National Park and Angling in Yellowstone National Park\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrecipitation in Yellowstone is highly variable and ranges from 15 inches (380 mm) annually near Mammoth Hot Springs, to 80 inches (2,000 mm) in the southwestern sections of the park. The precipitation of Yellowstone is greatly influenced by the moisture channel formed by the Snake River Plain to the west that was, in turn, formed by Yellowstone itself. Snow is possible in any month of the year, but most common between November and April, with averages of 150 inches (3,800 mm) annually around Yellowstone Lake, to twice that amount at higher elevations.[152]\n\n\nThe climate at Yellowstone Lake is classified as subarctic (Dfc), according to Köppen-Geiger climate classification, while at the park headquarters, the classification is humid continental (Dfb).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe park sits on the Yellowstone Plateau, at an average elevation of 8,000 feet (2,400 m) above sea level. The plateau is bounded on nearly all sides by mountain ranges of the Middle Rocky Mountains, which range from 9,000 to 11,000 feet (2,700 to 3,400 m) in elevation. The highest point in the park is atop Eagle Peak (11,358 feet or 3,462 metres) and the lowest is along Reese Creek (5,282 feet or 1,610 metres).[11] Nearby mountain ranges include the Gallatin Range to the northwest, the Beartooth Mountains in the north, the Absaroka Range to the east, the Teton Range to the south, and the Madison Range to the west.

It was initially forecasted that the park would not be able to reopen the north entrance by Gardiner, MT, or the northeast entrance near Cooke City, MT, during the 2022 season.[157] The park partially reopened Wednesday, June 22, after a 9-day closure. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n159. **^** Bikales, James (October 14, 2022). \"Yellowstone to reopen northeast entrance 4 months after record floods\". *Washington Post*.

The caldera is considered a dormant volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years.[14] Well over half of the world's geysers[15][16] and hydrothermal features[17] are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest remaining nearly intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone.[18] In 1978, Yellowstone was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Yellowstone in United States of America\". *protectedplanet.net*.

New fumaroles were observed, and several geysers showed enhanced activity and increasing water temperatures. Several geysers became so hot that they were transformed into purely steaming features; the water had become superheated and they could no longer erupt normally.[95] This coincided with the release of reports of a multiple year United States Geological Survey research project which mapped the bottom of Yellowstone Lake and identified a structural dome that had uplifted at some time in the past. Research indicated that these uplifts posed no immediate threat of a volcanic eruption, since they may have developed long ago, and there had been no temperature increase found near the uplifts.[96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe most famous geyser in the park, and perhaps the world, is Old Faithful geyser, located in Upper Geyser Basin. Castle Geyser, Lion Geyser, Beehive Geyser, Grand Geyser (the world's tallest predictable geyser), Giant Geyser (the world's most voluminous geyser), Riverside Geyser and numerous other geysers are in the same basin. The park contains the tallest active geyser in the world—Steamboat Geyser in the Norris Geyser Basin. A study that was completed in 2011 found that at least 1,283 geysers have erupted in Yellowstone. Of these, an average of 465 are active in a given year.[90][91] Yellowstone contains at least 10,000 geothermal features altogether, including geysers, hot springs, mudpots, and fumaroles.[92] Over half of the world's geysers and hydrothermal features are concentrated in Yellowstone.[93][17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Official website ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) of the National Park Service\n* Travertine: Yellowstone's Hydrothermal Timekeeper USGS May 24, 2021\n* Act Establishing Yellowstone National Park from the Library of Congress\n* Congressional Acts Pertaining to Yellowstone\n* The Yellowstone magmatic system from the mantle plume to the upper crust at Science (registration required)\n* BYU Larsen Yellowstone collection at the L.

Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained firefighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive exhibits and an observation deck open to the public.[145] The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames.[146] Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September—the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity in the late afternoon and evening. Few fires burn more than 100 acres (40 ha), and the vast majority of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5 ha) before they burn themselves out.[147] Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil, and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![An old contour map showing mountainous terrain and a large lake](image)Ferdinand V. Hayden's map of Yellowstone National Park, 1871\nIn 1871, eleven years after his failed first effort, Ferdinand V. Hayden was finally able to explore the region. With government sponsorship, he returned to the region with a second, larger expedition, the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871. He compiled a comprehensive report, including large-format photographs by William Henry Jackson and paintings by Thomas Moran. The report helped to convince the U.S. Congress to withdraw this region from public auction. On March 1, 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant signed *The Act of Dedication*[8] law that created Yellowstone National Park.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** \"Yellowstone, History and Culture\". National Park Service.

The park is managed by the National Park Service and covers 759,620 acres (1,187 sq mi; 3,074 km2)[3] in four counties – centered in Tuolumne and Mariposa, extending north and east to Mono and south to Madera. Designated a World Heritage Site in 1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, giant sequoia groves, lakes, mountains, meadows, glaciers, and biological diversity.[8] Almost 95 percent of the park is designated wilderness.[9] Yosemite is one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the Sierra Nevada.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n121. **^** \"Yosemite Valley will close due to fire.

Lyell Glacier is the largest glacier in Yosemite (the Palisades Glaciers are the largest in the Sierra Nevada) and covers 160 acres (65 ha).[89] None of the Yosemite glaciers are a remnant of the Ice Age alpine glaciers responsible for sculpting the Yosemite landscape. Instead, they were formed during one of the neoglacial episodes that have occurred since the thawing of the Ice Age (such as the Little Ice Age).[82] Many Yosemite glaciers, such as the Black Mountain Glacier that was marked in 1871 and had gone by the mid-1980s, have disappeared.[90] Yosemite's final two glaciers – the Lyell and Maclure glaciers – have receded over the last 100 years and are expected to disappear as a result of climate change.[91][92]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Mule deer in Yosemite Valley\nThe park has an elevation range from 2,127 to 13,114 feet (648 to 3,997 m) and contains five major vegetation zones: chaparral and oak woodland, lower montane forest, upper montane forest, subalpine zone, and alpine. Of California's 7,000 plant species, approximately 50 percent occur in the Sierra Nevada and more than 20 percent within the park. The park contains suitable habitat for more than 160 rare plants, with rare local geologic formations and unique soils characterizing the restricted ranges many of these plants occupy.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| People | * John Muir\n* Stephen T.

Camp 4 is a walk-in campground in the Valley that was instrumental in the development of rock climbing as a sport, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[135] Climbers can generally be spotted in the snow-free months on anything from ten-foot-high (3 m) boulders to the 3,300-foot (1.0 km) face of El Capitan. Classes on rock climbing are offered there.\n\n\n\n### Winter activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A ranger-guided snowshoe walk in the park\nSome roads close in winter. Downhill skiing is available at the Badger Pass Ski Area—the oldest downhill skiing area in California, operating from mid-December through early April.[136] Much of the park is open to cross-country skiing and snowshoeing, and backcountry ski huts are available.[137][138] Wilderness permits are required for backcountry overnight ski trips.[130]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe house fires eventually spread to a large section of the forest and the militia group ended up having to abandon their raid to save their own camp from the conflagration.[119]\n\n\nForest fires clear the park of dead vegetation, making way for new growth.[120] Small fires damage the income generated by tourism. During late July and early August, 2018, the Valley and other sections of the park, temporarily closed due to the Ferguson Fire at its western boundary.[121] The closing was the largest in almost thirty years.[122]\n\n\n\n## Activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tunnel tree at Yosemite National Park in May 2022\n![](image)Yosemite Valley Shuttle System bus, a free bus service\n### Public access[edit]\n\n\nYosemite Valley is open year-round for hiking, and commercial recreational programs are available.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYosemite was critical to the development of the concept of national parks. Galen Clark and others lobbied to protect Yosemite Valley from development, ultimately leading to President Abraham Lincoln's signing of the Yosemite Grant of 1864 that declared Yosemite as federally preserved land.[13] In 1890 John Muir led a successful movement to motivate Congress to establish Yosemite Valley and its surrounding areas as a National Park. This helped pave the way for the National Park System.[13] Yosemite draws about four million visitors annually.[14] Most visitors spend the majority of their time in the valley's seven square miles (18 km2).[8] The park set a visitation record in 2016, surpassing five million visitors for the first time.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Toponym[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Hikers line the Half Dome cables on a busy summer day in 2008\nOver 800 miles (1,300 km) of trails are available to hikers[8]—everything from an easy stroll to a challenging mountain hike, or backpacking trips. The popular Half Dome hike to the summit of Half Dome and requires a permit whenever the cables are up (usually from Memorial Day weekend to Columbus Day).[127] A maximum of 300 hikers, selected by lottery, are permitted to advance beyond the base of the subdome each day, including 225 day hikers and 75 backpackers.[128]\n\n\nThe park can be divided into five sections—Yosemite Valley, Wawona/Mariposa Grove/Glacier Point, Tuolumne Meadows, Hetch Hetchy, and Crane Flat/White Wolf.[129] Numerous books describe park trails, while the National Park Service provides free information.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n72. **^** National Park Service. \"Ackerson Meadow Gifted to Yosemite National Park\".

According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone at Bear Lake Ranger Station (9492 ft / 2893 m) is 5a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -15.2 °F (-26.2 °C), and 5a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -16.1 °F (-26.7 °C) at Beaver Meadows Visitor Center (7825 ft / 2385 m).[49]\n\n\nThe complex interactions of elevation, slope, exposure and regional-scale air masses determine the climate within the park,[50][51] which is noted for its extreme weather patterns.[51] A \"collision of air masses\" from several directions produces some of the key weather events in the region. When cold arctic air from the north meets warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico at the Front Range, \"intense, very wet snowfalls with total snow depth measured in the feet\" accumulate in the park.[50]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of areas in the United States National Park System – parks, monuments, preserves, historic sites, etc.\n* Birds of Rocky Mountain National Park\n* List of national parks of the United States\n* Southern Rocky Mountain Front - where the Rocky Mountains meet the plains\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Montana State University states in their profile of Rocky Mountain National Park that there has been an increase of 2.5 °F (1.4 °C) in the average park temperature over \"the past century\" (charts show the period from about 1895 to 2010).[50] The National Park Service site states that the increase has been 3.4 °F (1.9 °C) over \"the last century\" (chart shows the period from about 1905-2010).[55]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRocky Mountain National Park is one of the highest national parks in the nation, with elevations from 7,860 to 14,259 feet (2,396 to 4,346 m),[31] the highest point of which is Longs Peak.[32] Trail Ridge Road is the highest paved through-road in the country, with a peak elevation of 12,183 feet (3,713 m).[33] Sixty mountain peaks over 12,000 feet (3,658 m) high provide scenic vistas.[31] On the north side of the park, the Mummy Range contains a number of thirteener peaks, including Hagues Peak, Mummy Mountain, Fairchild Mountain, Ypsilon Mountain, and Mount Chiquita.[34] Several small glaciers and permanent snowfields are found in the high mountain cirques.[35]\n\n\nThere are five regions, or geographical zones, within the park.\n\n\n\n### Region 1: Moose and big meadows[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Rocky Mountain in United States of America Archived 2019-07-24 at the Wayback Machine. *protectedplanet.net*.

It is a full-service community, including lodging, fuel, food, souvenirs, a hospital, churches, and access to trails and guided walks and talks.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Lodging[edit]\n\n\nSeveral lodging facilities are available along the South Rim.[24] Hotels and other lodging include El Tovar, Bright Angel Lodge, Kachina Lodge, Thunderbird Lodge, and Maswik Lodge, all of which are located in Grand Canyon Village, and Phantom Ranch, located on the canyon floor.[24] There is also an RV Park named Trailer Village. All of these facilities are managed by Xanterra Parks & Resorts, while the Yavapai Lodge (also in the village area) is managed by Delaware North.[24]\n\n\n\n### North Rim[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe creation of the park was an early success of the conservation movement. Its national park status may have helped thwart proposals to dam the Colorado River within its boundaries. (Later, the Glen Canyon Dam would be built upriver.) A second Grand Canyon National Monument to the west was proclaimed in 1932.[12] In 1975, that monument and Marble Canyon National Monument, which was established in 1969 and followed the Colorado River northeast from the Grand Canyon to Lees Ferry, were made part of Grand Canyon National Park. In 1979, UNESCO declared the park a World Heritage Site. The 1987 the National Parks Overflights Act[13] found that\n\"Noise associated with aircraft overflights at the Grand Canyon National Park is causing a significant adverse effect on the natural quiet and experience of the park and current aircraft operations at the Grand Canyon National Park have raised serious concerns regarding public safety, including concerns regarding the safety of park users.\"\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite Roosevelt's enthusiasm and strong interest in preserving land for public use, the Grand Canyon was not immediately designated as a national park. The first bill to establish Grand Canyon National Park was introduced in 1882 by then-Senator Benjamin Harrison, which would have established Grand Canyon as the third national park in the United States, after Yellowstone and Mackinac. Harrison unsuccessfully reintroduced his bill in 1883 and 1886; after his election to the presidency, he established the Grand Canyon Forest Reserve in 1893. Theodore Roosevelt created the Grand Canyon Game Preserve by proclamation on November 28, 1906,[9] and the Grand Canyon National Monument on January 11, 1908.[10] Further Senate bills to establish the site as a national park were introduced and defeated in 1910 and 1911, before the Grand Canyon National Park Act (Pub. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)From Toroweap Overlook on the North Rim\nThere are few roads on the North Rim, but there are some notable vehicle-accessible lookout points, including Point Imperial, Roosevelt Point, and Cape Royal. Mule rides are also available to a variety of places, including several thousand feet down into the canyon.\n\n\nMany visitors to the North Rim choose to make use of the variety of hiking trails including the Widforss Trail, Uncle Jim's Trail, the Transept Trail, and the North Kaibab Trail. The North Kaibab Trail can be followed all the way down to the Colorado River, connecting across the river to the South Kaibab Trail and the Bright Angel Trail, which continue up to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.\n\n\nThe Toroweap Overlook is located in the western part of the park on the North Rim. Access is via unpaved roads off Route 389 west of Fredonia, Arizona. The roads lead through Grand Canyon–Parashant National Monument and to the overlook.\n\n\n\n### South Rim[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| UNESCO World Heritage Site\n |\n| Criteria | Natural: vii, viii, ix, x |\n| Reference | 75 |\n| Inscription | 1979 (3rd Session) |\n|  |\n\n\n**Grand Canyon National Park**, located in northwestern Arizona, is the 15th site in the United States to have been named as a national park. The park's central feature is the Grand Canyon, a gorge of the Colorado River, which is often considered one of the Wonders of the World. The park, which covers 1,217,262 acres (1,901.972 sq mi; 4,926.08 km2) of unincorporated area in Coconino and Mohave counties, received more than 4.7 million recreational visitors in 2022, which is the second highest count of all American national parks after Great Smoky Mountains National Park.[5] The Grand Canyon was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. The park celebrated its 100th anniversary on February 26, 2019.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| National Parks | * Grand Canyon\n* Petrified Forest\n* Saguaro\n |\n| National Historical Parks,Historic Sites and Memorials | * Tumacácori NHP\n* Fort Bowie NHS\n* Hubbell Trading Post NHS\n* Coronado NMem\n |\n| National Monuments | National Park Service\nCanyon de Chelly\nCasa Grande Ruins\nChiricahua\nHohokam Pima\nMontezuma Castle\nNavajo\nOrgan Pipe Cactus\nPipe Spring\nSunset Crater\nTonto\nTuzigoot\nWalnut Canyon\nWupatki\nBureau of Land Management\nAgua Fria\nBaaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni – Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon\nGrand Canyon–Parashant\nIronwood Forest\nSonoran Desert\nVermilion Cliffs\n |\n| National Conservation Areas | * Gila Box Riparian\n* Las Cienegas\n* San Pedro Riparian\n |\n| National Recreation Areas | * Glen Canyon\n* Lake Mead\n |\n| National Trails | * Arizona National Scenic Trail\n* Butterfield Overland National Historic Trail\n* Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail\n* Old Spanish National Historic Trail\n |\n| National Forests | * Apache–Sitgreaves\n* Coconino\n\t+ Elden Pueblo\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* ![flag](image)Arizona portal\n\n\n![](image) Media related to Grand Canyon at Wikimedia Commons (image gallery)\n\n\n\n* List of trails in Grand Canyon National Park\n* List of national parks of the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)From Desert View on the South Rim\nA variety of activities at the South Rim cater to park visitors. A driving tour (35 miles (56 km)) along the South Rim is split into two segments. The western drive to Hermit's Point is eight miles (13 km) with several overlooks along the way, including Mohave Point, Hopi Point, and the Powell Memorial.[23] From March to December, access to Hermit's Rest is restricted to the free shuttle provided by the Park Service. The eastern portion to Desert View is 25 miles (40 km), and is open to private vehicles year round.\n\n\nWalking tours include the Rim Trail, which runs west from the Pipe Creek viewpoint for about eight miles (13 km) of paved road, followed by seven miles (11 km) unpaved to Hermit's Rest. Hikes can begin almost anywhere along this trail, and a shuttle can return hikers to their point of origin. Mather Point, the first view most people reach when entering from the south entrance, is a popular place to begin.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)1938 poster of the park\nThe Grand Canyon became well known to Americans in the 1880s after railroads were built and pioneers developed infrastructure and early tourism.[7] In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt visited the site and said, \n\n\n> The Grand Canyon fills me with awe. It is beyond comparison—beyond description; absolutely unparalleled through-out the wide world ... Let this great wonder of nature remain as it now is. Do nothing to mar its grandeur, sublimity and loveliness. You cannot improve on it. But you can keep it for your children, your children's children, and all who come after you, as the one great sight which every American should see.[8]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| State Parks | * Alamo Lake\n* Boyce Thompson Arboretum\n* Buckskin Mountain\n* Catalina\n* Cattail Cove\n* Dankworth Pond\n* Dead Horse Ranch\n* Fool Hollow Lake\n* Fort Verde\n* Granite Mountain Hotshots Memorial\n* Homolovi\n* Jerome\n* Kartchner Caverns\n* Lake Havasu\n* Lost Dutchman\n* Lyman Lake\n* McFarland\n* Oracle\n* Patagonia Lake\n* Picacho Peak\n* Red Rock\n* Riordan Mansion\n* River Island\n* Roper Lake\n* San Rafael\n* Slide Rock\n* Sonoita Creek\n* Tombstone Courthouse\n* Tonto Natural Bridge\n* Tubac Presidio\n* Verde River Greenway\n* Yuma Quartermaster Depot\n* Yuma Territorial Prison\n |\n| Wildlife areas | * Becker Lake\n* Cluff Ranch\n* Luna Lake\n* Mittry Lake\n* Powers Butte\n* Santa Rita\n* White Mountain Grasslands\n* Willcox Playa\n |\n\n |\n| Municipal | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Nature parks | * Papago Park\n* Phoenix Mountains Preserve\n* South Mountain Park\n |\n\n |\n| Other | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Designated areas | * Arches National Park\n* Canyonlands National Park\n* Colorado National Monument\n* Dead Horse Point State Park\n* Glen Canyon National Recreation Area\n* Grand Canyon National Park\n* Lake Mead National Recreation Area\n* Rocky Mountain National Park\n |\n| Related topics | * *Arizona v.

Within the park a total of sixteen mountains reach higher than 5,000 feet (1,520 m).[18]\n\n\nThe wide range of elevations mimics the latitudinal changes found throughout the entire eastern United States. Ascending the mountains is comparable to a trip from Tennessee to Canada. Plants and animals common in the country's Northeast have found suitable ecological niches in the park's higher elevations, while southern species find homes in the balmier lower reaches.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Great Smoky Mountains National Park has two climate types: humid subtropical (Cfa), and temperate oceanic (Cfb).[*citation needed*] The plant hardiness zone at Clingmans Dome Visitor Center is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of −14.3 °F (−25.7 °C).[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (sun data)[21] |\n\nThe humid, subtropical air mass typically in place over the Smoky Mountains produces large amounts of precipitation. Annual precipitation amounts range from 50–80 in (1,300–2,000 mm),[22] with heavy winter snowfall in the higher elevations.[23] Flash flooding often occurs after heavy rain.[22]\n\n\nThe average temperature difference between the mountains, such as Newfound Gap at 5,048 ft (1,539 m) above MSL, and the valleys at about 1,600 ft (488 m), is between 10–13 °F (5.6–7.2 °C) for highs, and between 3–6 °F (1.7–3.3 °C) for lows. The difference between high temperatures is similar to the moist adiabatic lapse rate of 3.3 °F (1.8 °C) per 1,000 ft (300 m), while the smaller difference between low temperatures is the result of frequent temperature inversions developing in the morning, most often in autumn.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Great Smoky Mountains National Park** is an American national park in the southeastern United States, with parts in North Carolina and Tennessee. The park straddles the ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains, part of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which are a division of the larger Appalachian Mountain chain. The park contains some of the highest mountains in eastern North America, including Clingmans Dome, Mount Guyot, and Mount Le Conte. The border between the two states runs northeast to southwest through the center of the park. The Appalachian Trail passes through the center of the park on its route from Georgia to Maine. With 14.1 million visitors in 2021, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited national park in the United States.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\nMap Highlighting the Park's Boundaries\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Great Smoky Mountains National Park |\n| --- |\n| IUCN category II (national park)[1]\n |\n| ![](image)View from the Cliff Tops formation atop Mount Le Conte\n |\n| ![Map showing the location of Great Smoky Mountains National Park](image)![Map showing the location of Great Smoky Mountains National Park](image)\nLocation on the Tennessee and North Carolina border\nShow map of Tennessee\n![Map showing the location of Great Smoky Mountains National Park](image)![Map showing the location of Great Smoky Mountains National Park](image)\nLocation in the United States\nShow map of the United States\n |\n| Location | Swain & Haywood counties in North Carolina; Sevier, Blount, & Cocke counties in Tennessee, United States |\n| Nearest city | Cherokee, North Carolina, Bryson City, North Carolina, Townsend, Tennessee, Cosby, Tennessee and Gatlinburg, Tennessee |\n| Coordinates | 35°36′40″N 83°25′30″W﻿ / ﻿35.61111°N 83.42500°W﻿ / 35.61111; -83.42500﻿ (Newfound Gap)[2] |\n| Area | 522,419 acres (2,114.15 km2)[3] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Great Smoky Mountains in United States of America Archived 24 July 2019 at the Wayback Machine. *protectedplanet.net*.

The park's waters have long had a reputation for healthy trout activity as well as challenging fishing terrain. Brook trout are native to the waters, while both brown and rainbow were introduced to the area. Partially due to the fact of recent droughts killing off the native fish, there are strict regulations regarding how fishing may be conducted. Horseback riding (offered by the national park and on limited trails), bicycling (available for rent in Cades Cove) and water tubing are all also practiced within the park.\n\n\nFrom late May to early June, the Elkmont area of the park hosts the peak display period for synchronous fireflies (*Photinus carolinus*), one of at least 19 species of fireflies that live in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.[41] They are the only species in America whose individuals can synchronize their flashing light patterns.[42]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn late November and early December 2016, a series of wildfires engulfed a total of 17,900 acres (72 km2) in the park and surrounding areas. The wildfires killed at least 14, injured 190, and forced the evacuation of more than 14,000 people.[45] The fires also damaged or destroyed at least 2,000 structures. The fires, which were initially suspected to have been caused by arson, occurred during a period of unusual drought, which accelerated the fires. The wildfires were the deadliest in the Eastern United States since the Great Fires of 1947, and comprised one of the worst natural disasters in the history of Tennessee.[46][47][48][49]\n\n\nIn 2015 Cassius Cash was appointed as the first African-American superintendent of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. He is the 16th superintendent of the park.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStrong damaging winds of 80–100 mph (130–160 km/h) or higher occur a few times each year around the Smoky Mountains, mainly during the cool season from October to April, as a result of a phenomenon known as mountain waves.[25] Mountain waves are strongest in a narrow area along the foothills, and can create extensive areas of fallen trees and roof damage, especially around Cades Cove and Cove Mountain.[26] Strong winds created by mountain waves were a contributing factor in the devastating Gatlinburg fire on November 28, 2016, during the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires.[27] Damaging winds can also be generated by strong thunderstorms, with tornadoes and strong thunderstorm complexes (also known as mesoscale convective systems) occasionally affecting the Smoky Mountains.[28]\n\n\n\n### Air pollution[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** Shadbolt, Ryan; Charney, Joseph; Fromm, Hannah (2019). *A mesoscale simulation of a mountain wave wind event associated with the Chimney Tops 2 fire (2016)*.

The park is internationally recognized for its mountains, waterfalls, biodiversity, and forests.[7] In addition, the park preserves multiple historical structures that were part of communities occupied by early European-American settlers of the area.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe two main visitor centers inside the park are Sugarlands Visitors' Center near the Gatlinburg entrance to the park and Oconaluftee Visitor Center near Cherokee, North Carolina, at the eastern entrance to the park. These ranger stations provide exhibits on wildlife, geology, and the history of the park. They also sell books, maps, and souvenirs. Entrance into the park is free.[39]\n\n\nU.S. Highway 441 (known in the park as Newfound Gap Road) bisects the park, providing automobile access to many trailheads and overlooks, most notably that of Newfound Gap. At an elevation of 5,048 feet (1,539 m), it is the lowest gap in the mountains and is situated near the center of the park, on the Tennessee/North Carolina state line, halfway between the border towns of Gatlinburg and Cherokee. It was here that in 1940, from the Rockefeller Memorial, Franklin Delano Roosevelt dedicated the national park. On clear days Newfound Gap offers arguably the most spectacular scenes accessible via highway in the park.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe majority of rocks in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are Late Precambrian rocks that are part of the Ocoee Supergroup. This group consists of metamorphosed sandstones, phyllites, schists, and slate. Early Precambrian rocks are not only the oldest rocks in the park but also the dominant rock type in sites such as the Raven Fork Valley and upper Tuckasegee River between Cherokee and Bryson City. They primarily consist of metamorphic gneiss, granite, and schist. Cambrian sedimentary rocks can be found among the bottom of the Foothills to the northwest, and in limestone coves such as Cades Cove.[16] One of the most visited attractions in the mountains is Cades Cove, which is a window or an area where older rocks made out of sandstone surround the valley floor of younger rocks made out of limestone.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Tilden, Freeman (1968). *The National Parks*.

This short but strenuous trek rewarded nature enthusiasts with a spectacular panorama of the surrounding mountain peaks. It was the flashpoint for the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires, and therefore sustained extensive damage, evident still today in clearly visible burn scars. The peak has been closed to tourists ever since.\n\n\nBoth the Laurel Falls and Clingmans Dome trails offer relatively easy, short, paved paths to their respective destinations. The Laurel Falls Trail leads to a powerful 80-foot (24 m) waterfall, and the Clingmans Dome Trail takes visitors on an uphill climb to a 50 feet (15 m) tall observation deck, which on a clear day offers views for many miles over the Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia mountains.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSituated in a Beech forest swag between Balsam High Top and Big Cataloochee Mountain, the Laurel Gap Shelter can accommodate up to 14 people per night. This shelter is a popular base camp for peakbaggers exploring the heart of the Smokies wilderness.\n\n\nDesignated backcountry campsites are scattered throughout the park. A permit, available at ranger stations and via the park website, is required for all backcountry camping. Additionally, reservations are required for all of the shelters and backcountry campsites. A maximum stay of one night, in the case of shelters, or three nights, in the case of campsites, may limit the traveler's itinerary.\n\n\n\n### Other activities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. **^** Rolando Zenteno; Jason Hanna; Madison Park (5 December 2016). \"Death toll in Sevier County still rising\".

Farms and timbering operations were abolished to establish the protected areas of the park. Travel writer Horace Kephart, for whom Mount Kephart was named, and photographers Jim Thompson and George Masa were instrumental in fostering the development of the park.[9][14] Ben W. Hooper, a former governor of Tennessee, was the principal land purchasing agent for the park,[15] which was officially established on June 15, 1934. During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Works Progress Administration, and other federal organizations hired workers to build trails, fire watchtowers, and other infrastructure improvements to the park and Smoky Mountains.\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Visitation Numbers\". *nps.gov*.

Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe park is located in southwestern Utah in Washington, Iron and Kane counties. Geomorphically, it is located on the Markagunt and Kolob plateaus, at the intersection of three North American geographic provinces: the Colorado Plateau, the Great Basin, and the Mojave Desert. The northern part of the park is known as the **Kolob Canyons** section and is accessible from Interstate 15, exit 40.[13]\n\n\nThe 8,726-foot (2,660 m) summit of Horse Ranch Mountain is the highest point in the park; the lowest point is the 3,666-foot (1,117 m) elevation of Coal Pits Wash, creating a relief of about 5,100 feet (1,600 m).[14]\n\n\nStreams in the area take rectangular paths because they follow jointing planes in the rocks.[15] The stream gradient of the Virgin River, whose North Fork flows through Zion Canyon in the park, ranges from 50 to 80 feet per mile (9.5 to 15.2 m/km) (0.9–1.5%)—one of the steepest stream gradients in North America.[16]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 6.0\n | 4.4\n | 4.8\n | 4.4\n | 6.5\n | 65.5\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 0.5\n | 0.5\n | 0.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n | 0.6\n | 2.0\n |\n| Source: NOAA[22][23] |\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nArchaeologists have divided the long span of Zion's human history into three cultural periods: the Archaic, Protohistoric and Historic periods.

Other roads in Zion are open to private vehicles year-round.\n\n\nThe east side of the park is served by Zion-Mount Carmel Highway (SR-9), which passes through the Zion–Mount Carmel Tunnel and ends at US 89 at Mount Carmel Junction.

Many believed that Spanish and Indian names would deter visitors who, if they could not pronounce the name of a place, might not bother to visit it.[7] The new name, Zion, had greater appeal to an ethnocentric audience.\"[8] On November 19, 1919, Congress redesignated the monument as **Zion National Park**, and the act was signed by President Woodrow Wilson.[9] The Kolob section was proclaimed a separate Zion National Monument in 1937, but was incorporated into the national park in 1956.[10] Congress designated 85% of the park a wilderness area in 2009.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOther often-used backcountry trails include the West Rim and LaVerkin Creek.[69] The more primitive sections of Zion include the Kolob Terrace and the Kolob Canyons.[14] A network of trails totaling 50 miles in distance connect Zion's northwest corner of the park (Lee Pass Trailhead) to its southeast section (East Rim Trailhead). Popularly known as the Zion Traverse, the route offers backpackers a diverse experience of the park.\n\n\nZion is a center for rock climbing, with short walls like Spaceshot, Moonlight Buttress, Prodigal Son, Ashtar Command, and Touchstone being the most popular, highly rated routes.[70][71]\n\n\n\nCamping and lodging\n![](image)Zion Lodge accommodations\nLodging in the park is available at Zion Lodge, located halfway through Zion Canyon.

Access for oversized vehicles requires a special permit, and is limited to daytime hours, as traffic through the tunnel must be one way to accommodate large vehicles. The 5-mile (8.0 km)-long Kolob Canyons Road was built to provide access to the Kolob Canyons section of the park.[44] This road often closes in the winter.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Harris, Ann G.; Tuttle, Esther; Tuttle, Sherwood D.

Dellenbaugh (1903)\nPaintings of the canyon by Frederick S. Dellenbaugh were exhibited at the Saint Louis World's Fair in 1904,[16] followed by a favorable article in *Scribner's Magazine* the next year. The article and paintings, along with previously created photographs, paintings, and reports, led to President William Howard Taft's proclamation on July 31, 1909, that created Mukuntuweap National Monument.[28] In 1917, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service visited the canyon and proposed changing its name from the locally unpopular Mukuntuweap to Zion, a name used by the local Mormon community.[33] The United States Congress added more land and established Zion National Park on November 19, 1919.[5] A separate Zion National Monument, the Kolob Canyons area, was proclaimed on January 22, 1937, and was incorporated into the park on July 11, 1956.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Taylor Creek with Horse Ranch Mountain in background. Desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest habitats are all visible.\nThe Great Basin, Mojave Desert, and Colorado Plateau converge at Zion and the Kolob canyons.[52] This, along with the varied topography of canyon–mesa country, differing soil types, and uneven water availability, provides diverse habitat for the equally diverse mix of plants and animals that live in the area. The park is home to 289 bird, 79 mammals, 28 reptiles, 7 fish, and 6 amphibian species.[53] These organisms make their homes in one or more of four life zones found in the park: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest.[54]\n\n\nDesert conditions persist on canyon bottoms and rocky ledges away from perennial streams. Sagebrush, prickly pear cactus, and rabbitbrush, along with sacred datura and Indian paintbrush, are common.[55] Utah penstemon and golden aster can also be found.[56] Milkvetch and prince's plume are found in pockets of selenium-rich soils.[54]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRangers at the visitor centers in Zion Canyon and Kolob Canyons can help visitors plan their stay.

The record high temperature was 99 °F (37 °C) in 2002, while the coldest temperature recorded is −66 °F (−54 °C) in 1933.[11] During the summer months of June to early September, daytime highs are normally in the 70 to 80 °F (21 to 27 °C) range, while nighttime lows can go to below freezing (0 °C), especially at higher altitudes. Summer afternoons are frequently accompanied by thunderstorms. Spring and fall temperatures range between 30 and 60 °F (−1 and 16 °C) with nights in the teens to single digits (−5 to −20 °C). Winter in Yellowstone is accompanied by high temperatures usually between 0 and 20 °F (−18 and −7 °C) and nighttime temperatures below 0 °F (−18 °C) for most of the winter.[152]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Yellowstone National Park – Old Faithful, Wyoming, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1904–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 55(13)\n | 62(17)\n | 63(17)\n | 76(24)\n | 82(28)\n | 89(32)\n | 94(34)\n | 98(37)\n | 87(31)\n | 79(26)\n | 63(17)\n | 58(14)\n | 98(37)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 42.1(5.6)\n | 44.8(7.1)\n | 52.4(11.3)\n | 60.2(15.7)\n | 70.7(21.5)\n | 79.8(26.6)\n | 85.0(29.4)\n | 84.6(29.2)\n | 79.4(26.3)\n | 67.2(19.6)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 40.7(4.8)\n | 86.4(30.2)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 28.3(−2.1)\n | 31.1(−0.5)\n | 38.7(3.7)\n | 45.5(7.5)\n | 55.2(12.9)\n | 65.1(18.4)\n | 75.9(24.4)\n | 75.0(23.9)\n | 64.8(18.2)\n | 49.9(9.9)\n | 35.3(1.8)\n | 26.5(−3.1)\n | 49.3(9.6)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 14.7(−9.6)\n | 16.5(−8.6)\n | 24.3(−4.3)\n | 32.3(0.2)\n | 42.0(5.6)\n | 49.9(9.9)\n | 57.6(14.2)\n | 55.9(13.3)\n | 47.3(8.5)\n | 35.9(2.2)\n | 22.6(−5.2)\n | 13.7(−10.2)\n | 34.4(1.3)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrecipitation in Yellowstone is highly variable and ranges from 15 inches (380 mm) annually near Mammoth Hot Springs, to 80 inches (2,000 mm) in the southwestern sections of the park.

Yellowstone is 2,219,789 acres (8,983 km2; 3,468 sq mi)[3] in area, larger than either of the states of Rhode Island or Delaware. Rivers and lakes cover five percent of the land area, with the largest water body being Yellowstone Lake at 87,040 acres (352 km2; 136 sq mi). Yellowstone Lake is up to 400 feet (120 m) deep and has 110 miles (180 km) of shoreline. At an elevation of 7,733 feet (2,357 m) above sea level, Yellowstone Lake is the largest high-elevation lake in North America.

The caldera is considered a dormant volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years.[14] Well over half of the world's geysers[15][16] and hydrothermal features[17] are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest remaining nearly intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone.[18] In 1978, Yellowstone was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n159. **^** Bikales, James (October 14, 2022). \"Yellowstone to reopen northeast entrance 4 months after record floods\". *Washington Post*.

Since the mid-1960s, at least 2 million tourists have visited the park almost every year.[167] Average annual visitation increased to 3.5 million during the ten years from 2007 to 2016, with a record of 4,257,177 recreational visitors in 2016.[168] July is the busiest month for Yellowstone National Park.[169] At peak summer levels, 3,700 employees work for Yellowstone National Park concessionaires. Concessionaires manage nine hotels and lodges, with a total of 2,238 hotel rooms and cabins available. They also oversee gas stations, stores, and most of the campgrounds. Another 800 employees work either permanently or seasonally for the National Park Service.[11]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor three months in 1985, 3,000 minor earthquakes were detected in the northwestern section of the park, during what has been referred to as an earthquake swarm, and has been attributed to minor subsidence of the Yellowstone caldera.[86] Beginning on April 30, 2007, 16 small earthquakes with magnitudes up to 2.7 occurred in the Yellowstone Caldera for several days. These swarms of earthquakes are common, and there have been 70 such swarms between 1983 and 2008.[103] In December 2008, over 250 earthquakes were measured over four days under Yellowstone Lake, the largest measuring a magnitude of 3.9.[104] In January 2010, more than 250 earthquakes were detected over two days.[105] Seismic activity in Yellowstone National Park continues and is reported hourly by the Earthquake Hazards Program of the U.S. Geological Survey.[106]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAbout thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by lightning, while another six to ten are started by people—in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained firefighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive exhibits and an observation deck open to the public.[145] The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames.[146] Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September—the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity in the late afternoon and evening. Few fires burn more than 100 acres (40 ha), and the vast majority of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5 ha) before they burn themselves out.[147] Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil, and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe spring season of 1988 was wet, but by summer, drought began moving in throughout the northern Rockies, creating the driest year on record to that point. Grasses and plants which grew well in the early summer from the abundant spring moisture produced plenty of grass, which soon turned to dry tinder. The National Park Service began firefighting efforts to keep the fires under control, but the extreme drought made suppression difficult. Between July 15 and 21, 1988, fires quickly spread from 8,500 acres (3,400 ha; 13.3 sq mi) throughout the entire Yellowstone region, which included areas outside the park, to 99,000 acres (40,000 ha; 155 sq mi) on the park land alone. By the end of the month, the fires were out of control. Large fires burned together, and on August 20, 1988, the single worst day of the fires, more than 150,000 acres (61,000 ha; 230 sq mi) were consumed. Seven large fires were responsible for 95% of the 793,000 acres (321,000 ha; 1,239 sq mi) that were burned over the next couple of months. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n93. **^** \"Yellowstone National Park\". *World Heritage Sites*.

New fumaroles were observed, and several geysers showed enhanced activity and increasing water temperatures. Several geysers became so hot that they were transformed into purely steaming features; the water had become superheated and they could no longer erupt normally.[95] This coincided with the release of reports of a multiple year United States Geological Survey research project which mapped the bottom of Yellowstone Lake and identified a structural dome that had uplifted at some time in the past. Research indicated that these uplifts posed no immediate threat of a volcanic eruption, since they may have developed long ago, and there had been no temperature increase found near the uplifts.[96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe most famous geyser in the park, and perhaps the world, is Old Faithful geyser, located in Upper Geyser Basin. Castle Geyser, Lion Geyser, Beehive Geyser, Grand Geyser (the world's tallest predictable geyser), Giant Geyser (the world's most voluminous geyser), Riverside Geyser and numerous other geysers are in the same basin. The park contains the tallest active geyser in the world—Steamboat Geyser in the Norris Geyser Basin. A study that was completed in 2011 found that at least 1,283 geysers have erupted in Yellowstone. Of these, an average of 465 are active in a given year.[90][91] Yellowstone contains at least 10,000 geothermal features altogether, including geysers, hot springs, mudpots, and fumaroles.[92] Over half of the world's geysers and hydrothermal features are concentrated in Yellowstone.[93][17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n153. **^** \"Severe Weather\".

The record high temperature was 99 °F (37 °C) in 2002, while the coldest temperature recorded is −66 °F (−54 °C) in 1933.[11] During the summer months of June to early September, daytime highs are normally in the 70 to 80 °F (21 to 27 °C) range, while nighttime lows can go to below freezing (0 °C), especially at higher altitudes. Summer afternoons are frequently accompanied by thunderstorms. Spring and fall temperatures range between 30 and 60 °F (−1 and 16 °C) with nights in the teens to single digits (−5 to −20 °C). Winter in Yellowstone is accompanied by high temperatures usually between 0 and 20 °F (−18 and −7 °C) and nighttime temperatures below 0 °F (−18 °C) for most of the winter.[152]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Yellowstone Lake, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1904–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 48(9)\n | 49(9)\n | 60(16)\n | 73(23)\n | 78(26)\n | 84(29)\n | 92(33)\n | 91(33)\n | 89(32)\n | 76(24)\n | 63(17)\n | 52(11)\n | 92(33)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 37.2(2.9)\n | 40.7(4.8)\n | 49.9(9.9)\n | 56.3(13.5)\n | 66.6(19.2)\n | 75.6(24.2)\n | 81.2(27.3)\n | 81.1(27.3)\n | 76.4(24.7)\n | 64.6(18.1)\n | 49.0(9.4)\n | 37.3(2.9)\n | 82.7(28.2)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 23.2(−4.9)\n | 26.7(−2.9)\n | 35.0(1.7)\n | 41.5(5.3)\n | 50.4(10.2)\n | 60.8(16.0)\n | 71.2(21.8)\n | 70.9(21.6)\n | 61.4(16.3)\n | 46.0(7.8)\n | 32.6(0.3)\n | 23.6(−4.7)\n | 45.3(7.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 13.3(−10.4)\n | 15.1(−9.4)\n | 22.9(−5.1)\n | 30.4(−0.9)\n | 39.7(4.3)\n | 48.5(9.2)\n | 56.9(13.8)\n | 56.2(13.4)\n | 47.7(8.7)\n | 35.6(2.0)\n | 23.7(−4.6)\n | 15.4(−9.2)\n | 33.8(1.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 3.3(−15.9)\n | 3.5(−15.8)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrecipitation in Yellowstone is highly variable and ranges from 15 inches (380 mm) annually near Mammoth Hot Springs, to 80 inches (2,000 mm) in the southwestern sections of the park. The precipitation of Yellowstone is greatly influenced by the moisture channel formed by the Snake River Plain to the west that was, in turn, formed by Yellowstone itself. Snow is possible in any month of the year, but most common between November and April, with averages of 150 inches (3,800 mm) annually around Yellowstone Lake, to twice that amount at higher elevations.[152]\n\n\nThe climate at Yellowstone Lake is classified as subarctic (Dfc), according to Köppen-Geiger climate classification, while at the park headquarters, the classification is humid continental (Dfb).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 38.8(99)\n | 40.1(102)\n | 28.7(73)\n | 7.2(18)\n | 0.1(0.25)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.5(1.3)\n | 4.5(11)\n | 12.9(33)\n | 27.3(69)\n | 43.3(110)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 14.1\n | 13.0\n | 12.2\n | 11.9\n | 12.7\n | 13.2\n | 9.0\n | 8.9\n | 9.5\n | 10.1\n | 12.0\n | 15.2\n | 141.8\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 13.8\n | 12.5\n | 11.3\n | 8.6\n | 2.4\n | 0.5\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.6\n | 4.1\n | 10.7\n | 15.4\n | 79.9\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA[165] |\n| Source 2: National Weather Service[166] |\n\n## Recreation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Trails of Yellowstone National Park and Angling in Yellowstone National Park\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe park sits on the Yellowstone Plateau, at an average elevation of 8,000 feet (2,400 m) above sea level.

The park is 63 miles (101 km) north to south, and 54 miles (87 km) west to east by air. Yellowstone is 2,219,789 acres (8,983 km2; 3,468 sq mi)[3] in area, larger than either of the states of Rhode Island or Delaware. Rivers and lakes cover five percent of the land area, with the largest water body being Yellowstone Lake at 87,040 acres (352 km2; 136 sq mi). Yellowstone Lake is up to 400 feet (120 m) deep and has 110 miles (180 km) of shoreline. At an elevation of 7,733 feet (2,357 m) above sea level, Yellowstone Lake is the largest high-elevation lake in North America. Forests comprise 80 percent of the land area of the park; most of the rest is grassland.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468.4 sq mi (8,983 km2),[3] comprising lakes, canyons, rivers, and mountain ranges.[11] Yellowstone Lake is one of the largest high-elevation lakes in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest super volcano on the continent. The caldera is considered a dormant volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years.[14] Well over half of the world's geysers[15][16] and hydrothermal features[17] are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest remaining nearly intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone.[18] In 1978, Yellowstone was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Yellowstone National Park\". *Encyclopædia Britannica*.

Completed in 1967, it was designed by Taliesin Associated Architects, and was one of the most significant commissions for that firm in the years immediately following the death of founder Frank Lloyd Wright.[3] It was also one of the last major projects completed under the Park Service Mission 66 project. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2001.[2][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Description and history[edit]\n\n\nThe Beaver Meadows Visitor Center is located on the south side of United States Route 36 near the principal eastern entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park. As seen from visitor (north) side, the building presents as a single-story structure, but is actually two stories owing to the sloping terrain on which it is built. It is a rectangular structure, built with a steel frame and cast concrete panels, into which slabs of sandstone have been embedded. The upper level framing has Cor-Ten steel set in a zigzag pattern inspired by Native American artworks. The building's eastern end is devoted to visitor facilities, including a lobby, amphitheater, and shop, with an inside observation area and outside balcony providing views of the Rocky Mountains. The western end houses park offices in a modular design with movable partitions.[4]\n\n\nRocky Mountain National Park was founded in 1915. As part of the Park Service's Mission 66 program to revitalize the nation's park system, the Park Service hired the firm of Taliesin Associated Architects in 1964 to design a new visitors center for the park. Construction began in 1965 and was completed in 1967. The building has been relatively little altered since then: the shop occupies a former lobby area that included benches and a fireplace, and changes in equipment for the theater necessitated the closure of a balcony entrance.[4]\n\n\n\n## Map[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beaver Meadows map. *Courtesy of Rocky Mountain National Park*.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Rocky Mountain National Park Utility Area Historic District\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Larimer County, Colorado\n* List of National Historic Landmarks in Colorado\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"National Register Information System\". *National Register of Historic Places*.

According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone at Bear Lake Ranger Station (9492 ft / 2893 m) is 5a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -15.2 °F (-26.2 °C), and 5a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -16.1 °F (-26.7 °C) at Beaver Meadows Visitor Center (7825 ft / 2385 m).[49]\n\n\nThe complex interactions of elevation, slope, exposure and regional-scale air masses determine the climate within the park,[50][51] which is noted for its extreme weather patterns.[51] A \"collision of air masses\" from several directions produces some of the key weather events in the region. When cold arctic air from the north meets warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico at the Front Range, \"intense, very wet snowfalls with total snow depth measured in the feet\" accumulate in the park.[50]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of areas in the United States National Park System – parks, monuments, preserves, historic sites, etc.\n* Birds of Rocky Mountain National Park\n* List of national parks of the United States\n* Southern Rocky Mountain Front - where the Rocky Mountains meet the plains\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Montana State University states in their profile of Rocky Mountain National Park that there has been an increase of 2.5 °F (1.4 °C) in the average park temperature over \"the past century\" (charts show the period from about 1895 to 2010).[50] The National Park Service site states that the increase has been 3.4 °F (1.9 °C) over \"the last century\" (chart shows the period from about 1905-2010).[55]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Rocky Mountain in United States of America Archived 2019-07-24 at the Wayback Machine. *protectedplanet.net*.

The park is situated between the towns of Estes Park to the east and Grand Lake to the west. The eastern and western slopes of the Continental Divide run directly through the center of the park with the headwaters of the Colorado River located in the park's northwestern region.[6] The main features of the park include mountains, alpine lakes and a wide variety of wildlife within various climates and environments, from wooded forests to mountain tundra.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Rocky Mountain National Park\". *Backpacker Magazine*.

As seen from visitor (north) side, the building presents as a single-story structure, but is actually two stories owing to the sloping terrain on which it is built. It is a rectangular structure, built with a steel frame and cast concrete panels, into which slabs of sandstone have been embedded. The upper level framing has Cor-Ten steel set in a zigzag pattern inspired by Native American artworks. The building's eastern end is devoted to visitor facilities, including a lobby, amphitheater, and shop, with an inside observation area and outside balcony providing views of the Rocky Mountains. The western end houses park offices in a modular design with movable partitions.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"National Register Information System\". *National Register of Historic Places*.

As part of the Park Service's Mission 66 program to revitalize the nation's park system, the Park Service hired the firm of Taliesin Associated Architects in 1964 to design a new visitors center for the park. Construction began in 1965 and was completed in 1967. The building has been relatively little altered since then: the shop occupies a former lobby area that included benches and a fireplace, and changes in equipment for the theater necessitated the closure of a balcony entrance.[4]\n\n\n\n## Map[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beaver Meadows map. *Courtesy of Rocky Mountain National Park*.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Rocky Mountain National Park Utility Area Historic District\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Larimer County, Colorado\n* List of National Historic Landmarks in Colorado\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Rocky Mountain National Park Administration Building\n |\n| U.S. National Register of Historic Places\n |\n| U.S. National Historic Landmark\n |\n| U.S. Historic districtContributing property\n |\n|  |\n| ![](image) |\n| ![Beaver Meadows Visitor Center is located in Colorado](image)![Beaver Meadows Visitor Center](image)\nShow map of Colorado\n![Beaver Meadows Visitor Center is located in the United States](image)![Beaver Meadows Visitor Center](image)\nShow map of the United States\n |\n| Location | Rocky Mountain National Park, Estes Park, Colorado |\n| Coordinates | 40°21′58″N 105°33′39″W﻿ / ﻿40.36611°N 105.56083°W﻿ / 40.36611; -105.56083 |\n| Area | less than one acre |\n| Architect | Taliesin Associated Architects |\n| Architectural style | Park Service Modern |\n| Part of | Rocky Mountain National Park Utility Area Historic District (ID82001717) |\n| MPS | Rocky Mountain National Park MRA |\n| NRHP reference No. | 01000069 |\n| Significant dates |\n| Added to NRHP | January 3, 2001[1] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNational Register of Historic Places in Rocky Mountain National Park\n |\n| --- |\n| NationalHistoric Landmarks | * Rocky Mountain National Park Administration Building\n |\n| Otherhistoric districts | * Cascade Cottages\n* Fall River Entrance Historic District\n* Holzwarth Historic District\n* McGraw Ranch\n* Moraine Park Museum and Amphitheater\n* Rocky Mountain National Park Utility Area Historic District\n* William Allen White Cabins\n* Beatrice Willard Alpine Tundra Research Plots\n |\n| Other properties | * Bear Lake Comfort Station\n* Dutchtown\n* East Inlet Trail\n* East Longs Peak Trail\n* Fall River Pass Ranger Station\n* Fall River Pump House and Catchment Basin\n* Fall River Road\n* Fern Lake Patrol Cabin\n* Fern Lake Trail\n* Flattop Mountain Trail\n* Gem Lake Trail\n* Glacier Basin Campground Ranger Station\n* Grand River Ditch\n* Lake Haiyaha Trail\n* Little Buckaroo Ranch Barn\n* Lost Lake Trail\n* Lulu City Site\n* Milner Pass Road Camp Mess Hall and House\n* Moraine Lodge\n* North Inlet Trail\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Designated NHL | January 3, 2001[2] |\n| Designated CP | March 18, 1982 |\n\n\n**Beaver Meadows Visitor Center**, also known as **Rocky Mountain National Park Administration Building**, is the park headquarters and principal visitors center of Rocky Mountain National Park in central northern Colorado.

As of 2005, no areas are currently off limits aside from those normally allowing limited access such as around the West Thumb Geyser Basin. There is a \"bulge\" about 2,000 ft (610 m) long and 100 ft (30 m) high under a section of Yellowstone Lake, where there are a variety of faults, hot springs and small craters. Seismic imaging has recently shown that sediment layers are tilted, but how old this feature is has not yet been established.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the magma chamber under the Yellowstone area collapsed 640,000 years ago in its previous great eruption, it formed a large caldera that was later partially filled by subsequent lava flows (see Yellowstone Caldera). Part of this caldera is the 136 sq mi (350 km2) basin of Yellowstone Lake. The original lake was 200 ft (61 m) higher than the present-day lake, extending northward across Hayden Valley to the base of Mount Washburn.\n\n\nIt is thought that Yellowstone Lake originally drained south into the Pacific Ocean via the Snake River. The lake currently drains north from its only outlet, the Yellowstone River, at Fishing Bridge. The elevation of the lake's north end does not drop substantially until LeHardy Rapids. Therefore, this spot is considered the actual northern boundary of Yellowstone Lake. Within a short distance downstream the Yellowstone River plunges first over the upper and then the lower falls and races north through the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough many prospecting parties traversed the Yellowstone region throughout the 1850–60s, the first detailed descriptions of the lake came in 1869, 1870 and 1871 as a result of the Cook–Folsom–Peterson Expedition, the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition and the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871.\n\n\nCook, Folsom and Peterson first encountered the lake near Pelican Creek 44°33′12″N 110°21′37″W﻿ / ﻿44.55333°N 110.36028°W﻿ / 44.55333; -110.36028﻿ (Pelican Creek) as they moved south along the Yellowstone River on September 24, 1869.

Montana and Wyoming politicians, the Army Corps of Engineers and lobbying groups in both states all had a variety of reasons to support the dams—flood control in the Yellowstone Valley, reclamation, or diversion of water over the continental divide to the Snake River. All the proposals and legislation were eventually defeated.[11]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Panorama of the West Thumb area of Yellowstone Lake in 2018\nIn the southwest area of the lake, the West Thumb Geyser Basin is easily accessible to visitors. Geysers, fumaroles, and hot springs are found both alongside and in the lake.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe forest and valleys surrounding Yellowstone Lake had been populated with Native Americans since pre-historic times. Archeologists have found evidence of human presence in the park long before 1872. They found that Native Americans hunted bison and bighorn sheep, fished for cutthroat trout, and gathered bitterroot and camas bulbs for at least 11,000 years. Also 26 tribes claim cultural association with Yellowstone today.[3] The first human of European descent to see the lake was trapper John Colter in the early 19th century. During the fur trading era of 1820–1840, the lake was probably visited by many trapping parties moving through the park region. In trapper Osborne Russell's diary, he describes a visit to the lake in 1836 as follows:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Yellowstone Lake\". *National Park Service*.

Completed in 1967, it was designed by Taliesin Associated Architects, and was one of the most significant commissions for that firm in the years immediately following the death of founder Frank Lloyd Wright.[3] It was also one of the last major projects completed under the Park Service Mission 66 project. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2001.[2][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Description and history[edit]\n\n\nThe Beaver Meadows Visitor Center is located on the south side of United States Route 36 near the principal eastern entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park. As seen from visitor (north) side, the building presents as a single-story structure, but is actually two stories owing to the sloping terrain on which it is built. It is a rectangular structure, built with a steel frame and cast concrete panels, into which slabs of sandstone have been embedded. The upper level framing has Cor-Ten steel set in a zigzag pattern inspired by Native American artworks. The building's eastern end is devoted to visitor facilities, including a lobby, amphitheater, and shop, with an inside observation area and outside balcony providing views of the Rocky Mountains. The western end houses park offices in a modular design with movable partitions.[4]\n\n\nRocky Mountain National Park was founded in 1915. As part of the Park Service's Mission 66 program to revitalize the nation's park system, the Park Service hired the firm of Taliesin Associated Architects in 1964 to design a new visitors center for the park. Construction began in 1965 and was completed in 1967. The building has been relatively little altered since then: the shop occupies a former lobby area that included benches and a fireplace, and changes in equipment for the theater necessitated the closure of a balcony entrance.[4]\n\n\n\n## Map[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beaver Meadows map. *Courtesy of Rocky Mountain National Park*.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Rocky Mountain National Park Utility Area Historic District\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Larimer County, Colorado\n* List of National Historic Landmarks in Colorado\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"National Register Information System\". *National Register of Historic Places*.
