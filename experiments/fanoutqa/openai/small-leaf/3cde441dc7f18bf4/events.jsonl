According to the most recent data, Germany's population is 84,432,670 (31 March 2023)[1] making it the most populous country in the European Union and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. The total fertility rate was rated at 1.58 in 2021,[6] significantly below the replacement rate of 2.1. For a long time Germany had one of the world's lowest fertility rates of around 1.3 to 1.4, however there has been a small increase in recent years.[7] Due to the low birth rate Germany has recorded more deaths than births every year since 1972,[8] which means 2021 was the 50th consecutive year the German population would have decreased without immigration. However, due to immigration the population has actually increased during the last half-century. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*0–14 years:* 12.83% (male 5,299,798 /female 5,024,184)\n*15–24 years:* 9.98% (male 4,092,901 /female 3,933,997)\n*25–54 years:* 39.87% (male 16,181,931 /female 15,896,528)\n*55–64 years:* 14.96% (male 5,989,111 /female 6,047,449)\n*65 years and over:* 22.36% (male 7,930,590 /female 10,061,248) (2018 est.)\n**Median age**:\ntotal: 47.4 years.

Today, less than 0.1% of the total population of Germany is Jewish.\n\n\n  \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Schleswig-Holstein | Kiel | 15,804 | 2,953,270 ![Increase](image) | 299,787 ![Increase](image) | 187\n |\n| Brandenburg | Potsdam | 29,654 | 2,573,135 ![Increase](image) | 179,872 ![Increase](image) | 87\n |\n| Saxony-Anhalt | Magdeburg | 20,454 | 2,186,643 ![Increase](image) | 160,990 ![Increase](image) | 107\n |\n| Thuringia | Erfurt | 16,202 | 2,126,846 ![Increase](image) | 161,291 ![Increase](image) | 131\n |\n| Hamburg | Hamburg | 755 | 1,892,122 ![Increase](image) | 363,283 ![Increase](image) | 2,506\n |\n| Mecklenburg-Vorpommern | Schwerin | 23,295 | 1,628,378 ![Increase](image) | 105,437 ![Increase](image) | 70\n |\n| Saarland | Saarbrücken | 2,571 | 992,666 ![Increase](image) | 139,189 ![Increase](image) | 386\n |\n| Bremen | Bremen | 419 | 684,864 ![Increase](image) | 144,148 ![Increase](image) | 1,634\n |\n| Germany | Berlin | 357,582 | 84,358,845 ![Increase](image) | 12,324,195 ![Increase](image) | 236\n |\n\n |\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| State | Capital | Area(km2) | Population[85](31 December 2022)\n | Foreigners\n | Population density(per km2)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Rhine-Westphalia | Düsseldorf | 34,112 | 18,139,116 ![Increase](image) | 2,828,367 ![Increase](image) | 532\n |\n| Bavaria | Munich | 70,541 | 13,369,116 ![Increase](image) | 2,073,494 ![Increase](image) | 190\n |\n| Baden-Württemberg | Stuttgart | 35,748 | 11,280,257 ![Increase](image) | 2,012,237 ![Increase](image) | 316\n |\n| Lower Saxony | Hanover | 47,709 | 8,140,242 ![Increase](image) | 959,786 ![Increase](image) | 171\n |\n| Hesse | Wiesbaden | 21,116 | 6,391,360 ![Increase](image) | 1,199,775 ![Increase](image) | 303\n |\n| Rhineland-Palatinate | Mainz | 19,858 | 4,159,150 ![Increase](image) | 566,026 ![Increase](image) | 209\n |\n| Saxony | Dresden | 18,450 | 4,086,152 ![Increase](image) | 300,164 ![Increase](image) | 221\n |\n| Berlin | Berlin | 891 | 3,755,251 ![Increase](image) | 834,349 ![Increase](image) | 4,215\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Proportion of Germans without a migrant background (2016)\n![](image)Germany is home to the second-largest number of international migrants worldwide.[79][80] In 2016, around 23% of Germany's population do not hold a German passport or are descendants of immigrants.[81]\n## Foreign nationals in Germany[edit]\n\n\n![](image)German and foreign national population pyramid of Germany in 2021\nAs the end of 2022, the most common groups of resident foreign nationals in Germany were as follows:[82]\n\n\nThis list does not include non-ethnic Germans with German nationality and foreign nationals without resident status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Religion in Germany (2020)[104][105] |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| No Religion |  | 40.7% |\n| Roman Catholicism |  | 26.7% |\n| Protestant Church |  | 24.3% |\n| Islam |  | 3.5% |\n| Orthodox Church |  | 1.9% |\n| Other Christians |  | 1.1% |\n| Other Religions |  | 0.9% |\n\nProtestantism is concentrated in the north and east and Roman Catholicism is concentrated in the south and west.

Argentina's fertility decline began earlier than in the rest of Latin America, occurring most rapidly between the early 20th century and the 1930s and then becoming more gradual.[7]\n\n\nLife expectancy has been improving, most notably among the young and the poor.[7]\n\n\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review.[28]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 1 minute\n* One death every 1.4 minutes\n* One net migrant every 111 minutes\n* Net gain of one person every 3 minutes\n\n\nDemographic statistics according to the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[7]\n\n\n\nPopulation\n\n46,245,668 (2022 est.)\nEthnic groups\n\nEuropean (mostly Spanish and Italian descent) and Mestizo (mixed European and Amerindian ancestry), 97.2%  \n\nAmerindian, 2.4%  \n\nAfrican, 0.4%\n(2010 est.)\n\n\n\nAge structure\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe table below gives an overview of the number of birth and deaths in Argentina during the past century. Several sources were combined to compile the table.[19][20][21]\n\n\nThe number of births in 2021 (529,794) was 32% below the record set in 2014, while the number of deaths (436,799) was the highest ever recorded[2] - though as the population of Argentina showed a five-fold increase during the past century, the birth rate in 2021 (11.6) was a record low while the death rate (9.5) rose to its highest since 1947 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[2]\n\n\nBirth rates were relatively stable from 1934 through 1980,[19] and after declining stabilized from 1995 to 2015 - before again declining sharply since then.[21]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Foreign born residents in Argentina by country of birth[50]\nAccording to the INDEC 1,531,940 of the Argentine resident population in 2001 were born outside Argentina, representing 4.22% of the total Argentine resident population.[51][52] In 2010, 1,805,957 of the Argentine resident population were born outside Argentina, representing 4.50% of the total Argentine resident population.[51][52][53][54]\n\n\nIllegal immigration has been a recent factor in Argentine demographics. Most illegal immigrants come from Bolivia and Paraguay, countries which border Argentina to the north. Smaller numbers arrive from Peru and Ecuador.\nThe Argentine government estimates that 750,000 inhabitants lack official documents and has launched a program called *Patria Grande* (\"Greater Homeland\")[55] to encourage illegal immigrants to regularize their status; so far over 670,000 applications have been processed under the program.[56]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n64. **^** Marita Carballo. *Valores good food here al cambio del milenio* ISBN 950-794-064-2.

Before the middle 19th century, the ethnic make up of Argentina was very similar to that of other countries of Latin America.[30][31][32][33] Between 1857 and 1950 Argentina was the country with the second biggest immigration wave in the world, at 6.6 million, second only to the United States in the numbers of immigrants received (27 million) and ahead of other areas of new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia.[34][35] However, mass European immigration did not have the same impact in the whole country. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Distribution of the Indigenous Peoples in Argentina and The Falkland Islands (British Overseas Territory)\nAccording to the data of INDEC's Complementary Survey of Indigenous Peoples (ECPI) 2004–2005, 600,000 officially recognized indigenous persons (about 1.4% of the total population) reside in Argentina. The most numerous of these communities are the Mapuches, who live mostly in the south, the Kollas and Wichís, from the northwest, and the Guaranis and Qom, who live mostly in the northeast.[38]\nIn the census of 2010, 955,032 people self recognized as indigenous or descendants of indigenous peoples, thus representing 2.4% of the national population.

About 3 million people live in Buenos Aires proper, and including suburban Greater Buenos Aires the metropolitan area totals around 14 million - making it one of the 15 largest urban areas in the world.[10] The metropolitan areas of Córdoba and Rosario have around 1.3 million inhabitants each,[10] and six other cities (Mendoza, Tucumán, La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe)[10][11] have at least half a million people each.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEstimates for the number of Roman Catholics vary from 70% of the population,[64] to as much as 90%.[65] The CIA Factbook lists 92% of the country is Catholic, but only 20% are practicing regularly or weekly at a church service.[7] The Jewish population is about 300,000 (around 0.75% of the population), the community numbered about 400,000 after World War II, but the appeal of Israel and economic and cultural pressures at home led many to leave; recent instability in Israel has resulted in a modest reversal of the trend since 2003.[65][66] Muslim Argentines number about 500,000–600,000, or approximately 1.5% of the population; 93% of them are Sunni.[65] Buenos Aires is home to one of the largest mosques in Latin America. A study from 2010 found that approximately 11% of Argentines are non-religious, including those who believe in God, though not religion, agnostics (4%) and atheists (5%). Overall, 24% attended religious services regularly. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to the 1914 national census, 30% of Argentina's population was foreign-born, including 50% of the people in the city of Buenos Aires, but foreigners were only 2% in the provinces of Catamarca and La Rioja (North West region).[31] Strikingly, at those times, the national population doubled every two decades. This belief is endured in the popular saying *\"los argentinos descienden de los barcos\"* (Argentines descend from the ships). Therefore, most Argentines are descended from the 19th- and 20th-century immigrants of the great European immigration wave to Argentina (1850–1955),[36] with a great majority of these immigrants coming from diverse European countries, particularly Italy and Spain.[13]\n\n\n\nCultural ethnic groups in the late 20th century in Argentina according to the UAEM[5]\n\n\n\nEuropean (85.0%)\nMestizo (11.4%)\nAsian and Arab (2.2%)\nAmerindian (1.0%)\nAfrican and Mulatto (0.4%)\n\nGenetic ancestry of the Argentine gene pool according to a study, using X-DIPs (matrilineal).[37]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe population is unequally distributed amongst the provinces, with 61% living in the Pampa region (21% of the total area), including 17.5 million people in Buenos Aires Province, 4 million in Córdoba Province, and over 3 million each in Santa Fe Province and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Eight other provinces each have over one million people: Mendoza, Tucumán, Salta, Entre Ríos, Misiones, Corrientes, Chaco, and Santiago del Estero.

In addition, after centuries of net emigration, from the 1980s Italy has experienced large-scale immigration for the first time in modern history. Italian government data, in its annual report for 2019, estimated the amount of foreign nationals residing within Italy, including immigrants, to be at approximately 5.234 million people.[3] Due to such large-scale immigration to the country, particularly from the early 2000s to 2014, the population peaked at 60.79 million. Since then, decreasing migration, a continuously falling birth rate, and continuous aging have led to a sharp decrease in the Italian population.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Animated population pyramid 1982–2021.

Its population density, at 197 inhabitants per square kilometre (510/sq mi), is higher than that of most Western European countries. However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven; the most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (which contains about a third of the country's population) in northern Italy and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples in central and southern Italy, while other vast areas are very sparsely populated, like the plateaus of Basilicata, the Alps and Apennines highlands, and the island of Sardinia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Demographics of Italy |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Population pyramid of Italy as of 2022\n |\n| Population | ![Decrease](image) 58,784,069 (30 June 2023)[1] |\n| Growth rate | ![Decrease](image) -0.54% (2022) |\n| Birth rate | 6.7 births/1,000 population (2022) |\n| Death rate | 12.1 deaths/1,000 population (2022) |\n| Life expectancy | 82 years (2020) |\n|  • male | 79.7 years |\n|  • female | 84.4 years |\n| Fertility rate | 1.24 children born/parent (2022) |\n| Infant mortality rate | 3.6 deaths/1,000 live births (2015)[2] |\n| Net migration rate | 1.3 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2020) |\n| Age structure |\n| 0–14 years | 12.89% |\n| 15–64 years | 63.57% |\n| 65 and over | 23.54% |\n| Nationality |\n| Nationality | *noun*: Italian(s) *adjective*: Italian |\n| Major ethnic | Italians |\n| Language |\n| Spoken | Italian, others |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*0-14 years:* 0–14 years: 13.45% (male 4,292,431/female 4,097,732)\n*15-24 years:* 9.61% (male 3,005,402/female 2,989,764)\n*25-54 years:* 40.86% (male 12,577,764/female 12,921,614)\n*55-64 years:* 14% (male 4,243,735/female 4,493,581)\n*65 years and over:* 22.08% (male 5,949,560/female 7,831,076) (2020 est.\n**Median age**\n\n\n\n\ntotal: 46.5 years.

At the end of the late 2000s, one in five Italians were over 65 years old.[4] Italy has experienced a short growth in birth rates.[5] The total fertility rate temporarily rose from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.46 in 2010.[6] Since then, fertility rates continued to drop, to reach a low of 1.24 in 2020.\n\n\nSince the revision of the Lateran Treaty in 1984, Italy has no official religion, although it continues to recognize the role the Catholic Church plays in Italian society. In 2017, 78% of the population identified as Catholic, 15% as non-believers or atheists, 2% as other Christians and 6% adhered to other religions.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Historical overview[edit]\n\n\n### 1861 to early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Italian diaspora\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a result of the profound economic and social changes brought by rapid postwar economic growth, including low birth rates, an aging population and thus a shrinking workforce, by the 1970s emigration had all but stopped and Italy started to have a positive net migration rate.[29] The nation's immigrant population reached 5 million by 2015, making up some 8% of the total population.[30] However, the long-lasting effects of the Eurozone crisis double-dip recession strongly slowed down immigration rates in Italy in the 2010s.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** Roberto, Vincenzo Patruno, Marina Venturi, Silvestro. \"Demo-Geodemo. – Mappe, Popolazione, Statistiche Demografiche dell'ISTAT\". *demo.istat.it*.`{{cite web}}`: CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list (link)\n54. **^** Arachi, Alessandra (15 December 2022). \"Siamo sempre meno e sempre più anziani, calano gli stranieri\". *Corriere della Sera*.
