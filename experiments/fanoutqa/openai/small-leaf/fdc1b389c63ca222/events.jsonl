These engines are mounted under the stern of the ship and they each drive 20 foot wide rotatable propellers. In addition to the three main engines, there are four bow thrusters used for docking, each with 5,500 kilowatts of power or 7,380 horsepower.[20]\n\n\nAmong the *Oasis*-class ships, *Symphony of the Seas* uses 25% less fuel due to design changes. One of these is the implementation of a new system that releases tiny air bubbles under the hull to enable the vessel to glide more smoothly through the water.[23] The air layer also reduces excitation from the propellers, which cuts noise and vibration levels in the aft part of the ship.[24]\n\n\n\n## Construction and career[edit]\n\n\nOn 29 October 2015, the vessel's keel was laid by the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France.[5] *Symphony of the Seas* floated out on 9 June 2017.[25] Actors Alexa Vega and Carlos Pena Jr., and their 23-month-old son Ocean were chosen as the \"Godfamily\" of the ship, marking the first time in the industry that a family was a ship sponsor.[26] The christening ceremony took place in Miami in November 2018.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Symphony of the Seas* at Saint-Nazaire after her completion.\nFrom 15 to 18 February 2018, the cruise ship underwent sea trials[28] and was formally turned over to Royal Caribbean International on 23 March.[7] On 24 March, the ship left Saint-Nazaire for Málaga under the command of Rob Hempstead, arriving on 27 March,[29][30] and arrived at the vessel's first homeport of Barcelona, Spain on 29 March.[30]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Symphony of the Seas* in Naples, Italy\nOn 31 March 2018, *Symphony of the Seas* offered her first passenger cruise[3] and began her maiden voyage on 7 April for a week-long trip through the Mediterranean.[31][32]\n\n\nDuring her first season, *Symphony of the Seas* continued to sail on seven-night Western Mediterranean cruises from Barcelona. She repositioned on 28 October and arrived on 9 November at her new home port at the Royal Caribbean terminal at PortMiami in Florida, United States to provide cruises of the Caribbean.[33][34]\n\n\nIn January 2019, while the ship was docked in Nassau, Bahamas, a guest jumped overboard as part of a stunt and survived.[35][36] He and his friends were turned over to law enforcement but were not charged, and they were required to return home at their own expense.[37] Subsequently, Royal Caribbean announced that it would permanently ban the guests from sailing on any of its ships.\n\n\nIn August 2019, an Australian passenger died after going overboard during a seven-day cruise of the Caribbean. His body was recovered shortly afterwards by the ship's officials.[38][39]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic on cruise ships, Royal Caribbean suspended all services across most of its fleet, including *Symphony of the Seas*.[40][41] A 27-year old crew member from the housekeeping department was medically evacuated in March 2020 and subsequently died from COVID-19 in April 2020.[42][43] The family later sued Royal Caribbean for wrongful death.[42]\n\n\nIn 2020, Channel 4 in the United Kingdom aired a behind-the-scenes show featuring *Symphony of the Seas* called *Billion Pound Cruise*.[44] The three-part series was filmed at the end of 2019 and covers the on-board experiences*.*[45][46]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** \"*Symphony of the Seas* (34719)\". *Vessel Register for DNV*.

RCI has three *Icon*-class cruise ships on order, with expected delivery between 2023 and 2026, the first, the *Icon of the Seas* will come in at 250,800 GT, which would make it the largest cruise ship in the world.[160] It is announced it will set sail on January 27, 2024. RCI also has a sixth *Oasis*-class ship, *Utopia of the Seas*, on order for 2024, and while its exact size is not published, RCI has previously stated that each new *Oasis*-class ship will be a little larger than the last.[161] Celebrity Cruises, which is owned by RCI's parent company Royal Caribbean Group, will introduce two 140,600 GT *Edge*-class ships in 2023 and 2025,[162] and TUI Cruises, a joint venture between Royal Caribbean Group and TUI Group, are introducing a new class of 161,000 GT cruise ships in 2024 and 2026.[163]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCruise ships are large passenger ships used mainly for vacationing. Unlike ocean liners, they typically embark on round-trip voyages to various ports of call, where passengers may go on tours known as \"shore excursions\".[1] They may carry thousands of passengers in a single trip, and are some of the largest ships in the world by gross tonnage (GT), bigger than many cargo ships. Cruise ships started to exceed ocean liners in size and capacity in the mid-1990s;[2] before then, few were more than 50,000 GT.[3] In the decades since the size of the largest vessels has more than doubled.[4] There have been nine or more new cruise ships added every year since 2001, most of which are 100,000 GT or greater.[5] In the two decades between 1988 and 2009, the largest cruise ships grew a third longer (268 m to 360 m), almost doubled their widths (32.2 m to 60.5 m), doubled the total passengers (2,744 to 5,400), and tripled in volume (73,000 GT to 225,000 GT). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Saunders, Aaron (2013). *Giants of the seas : the ships that transformed modern cruising*.

Unlike ocean liners, they typically embark on round-trip voyages to various ports of call, where passengers may go on tours known as \"shore excursions\".[1] They may carry thousands of passengers in a single trip, and are some of the largest ships in the world by gross tonnage (GT), bigger than many cargo ships. Cruise ships started to exceed ocean liners in size and capacity in the mid-1990s;[2] before then, few were more than 50,000 GT.[3] In the decades since the size of the largest vessels has more than doubled.[4] There have been nine or more new cruise ships added every year since 2001, most of which are 100,000 GT or greater.[5] In the two decades between 1988 and 2009, the largest cruise ships grew a third longer (268 m to 360 m), almost doubled their widths (32.2 m to 60.5 m), doubled the total passengers (2,744 to 5,400), and tripled in volume (73,000 GT to 225,000 GT). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of November 2022[update], 25 passenger ships were on order or under construction with a publicly announced size of over 135,000 GT. RCI has three *Icon*-class cruise ships on order, with expected delivery between 2023 and 2026, the first, the *Icon of the Seas* will come in at 250,800 GT, which would make it the largest cruise ship in the world.[160] It is announced it will set sail on January 27, 2024. RCI also has a sixth *Oasis*-class ship, *Utopia of the Seas*, on order for 2024, and while its exact size is not published, RCI has previously stated that each new *Oasis*-class ship will be a little larger than the last.[161] Celebrity Cruises, which is owned by RCI's parent company Royal Caribbean Group, will introduce two 140,600 GT *Edge*-class ships in 2023 and 2025,[162] and TUI Cruises, a joint venture between Royal Caribbean Group and TUI Group, are introducing a new class of 161,000 GT cruise ships in 2024 and 2026.[163]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of November 2022[update], there are 64 passenger ships with over 135,000 GT in service. The first ships over that size were the *Voyager*-class ships from Royal Caribbean Group's Royal Caribbean International (RCI). These ships, which debuted in 1998 at over 137,000 GT, were almost 30,000 GT larger than the next-largest cruise ships, and were some of the first ships designed to appeal to \"non-cruisers\", with features like a four-deck-high, 400-foot-long (120 m) atrium down the center of the ship, an ice rink, and a climbing wall.[1] In 2005, the five *Voyager*-class ships were overtaken by the 149,215 GT *Queen Mary 2* (*QM2*), the first non-RCI passenger ship over 135,000 GT and the only passenger ship currently in service that classifies itself as an ocean liner. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of January 2022[update], the largest cruise ship, *Wonder of the Seas*, has a gross tonnage of 236,857, is 362 metres (1,188 ft) long, 64 metres (210 ft) wide, and holds up to 6,988 passengers.[6][7]\n\n\nCruise ships are organized much like floating hotels, with a complete hospitality staff in addition to the usual ship's crew.[8] They cater to nautical tourists, with recent vessels being described as \"balcony-laden floating condominiums\".[9] The \"megaships\" went from a single deck with verandas to all decks with verandas,[10] and feature ameneties such as theaters, fine-dining and chain restaurants, spas, fitness centers, casinos, sports facilities, and even amusement park attractions.[1][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Saunders, Aaron (2013). *Giants of the seas : the ships that transformed modern cruising*.

RCI has three *Icon*-class cruise ships on order, with expected delivery between 2023 and 2026, the first, the *Icon of the Seas* will come in at 250,800 GT, which would make it the largest cruise ship in the world.[160] It is announced it will set sail on January 27, 2024. RCI also has a sixth *Oasis*-class ship, *Utopia of the Seas*, on order for 2024, and while its exact size is not published, RCI has previously stated that each new *Oasis*-class ship will be a little larger than the last.[161] Celebrity Cruises, which is owned by RCI's parent company Royal Caribbean Group, will introduce two 140,600 GT *Edge*-class ships in 2023 and 2025,[162] and TUI Cruises, a joint venture between Royal Caribbean Group and TUI Group, are introducing a new class of 161,000 GT cruise ships in 2024 and 2026.[163]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCruise ships are large passenger ships used mainly for vacationing. Unlike ocean liners, they typically embark on round-trip voyages to various ports of call, where passengers may go on tours known as \"shore excursions\".[1] They may carry thousands of passengers in a single trip, and are some of the largest ships in the world by gross tonnage (GT), bigger than many cargo ships. Cruise ships started to exceed ocean liners in size and capacity in the mid-1990s;[2] before then, few were more than 50,000 GT.[3] In the decades since the size of the largest vessels has more than doubled.[4] There have been nine or more new cruise ships added every year since 2001, most of which are 100,000 GT or greater.[5] In the two decades between 1988 and 2009, the largest cruise ships grew a third longer (268 m to 360 m), almost doubled their widths (32.2 m to 60.5 m), doubled the total passengers (2,744 to 5,400), and tripled in volume (73,000 GT to 225,000 GT). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of January 2022[update], the largest cruise ship, *Wonder of the Seas*, has a gross tonnage of 236,857, is 362 metres (1,188 ft) long, 64 metres (210 ft) wide, and holds up to 6,988 passengers.[6][7]\n\n\nCruise ships are organized much like floating hotels, with a complete hospitality staff in addition to the usual ship's crew.[8] They cater to nautical tourists, with recent vessels being described as \"balcony-laden floating condominiums\".[9] The \"megaships\" went from a single deck with verandas to all decks with verandas,[10] and feature ameneties such as theaters, fine-dining and chain restaurants, spas, fitness centers, casinos, sports facilities, and even amusement park attractions.[1][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of November 2022[update], there are 64 passenger ships with over 135,000 GT in service. The first ships over that size were the *Voyager*-class ships from Royal Caribbean Group's Royal Caribbean International (RCI). These ships, which debuted in 1998 at over 137,000 GT, were almost 30,000 GT larger than the next-largest cruise ships, and were some of the first ships designed to appeal to \"non-cruisers\", with features like a four-deck-high, 400-foot-long (120 m) atrium down the center of the ship, an ice rink, and a climbing wall.[1] In 2005, the five *Voyager*-class ships were overtaken by the 149,215 GT *Queen Mary 2* (*QM2*), the first non-RCI passenger ship over 135,000 GT and the only passenger ship currently in service that classifies itself as an ocean liner. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMSC Cruises introduced the first of four 137,936–139,072 GT *Fantasia*-class cruise ships in 2008,[21] followed in 2017 by both the 153,516 GT *Seaside*-class and the 171,598–181,541 GT *Meraviglia* class.[22] Norwegian Cruise Line debuted the 155,873 GT *Norwegian Epic* in 2010, the first ship outside of the *Oasis* class with a double-occupancy capacity of over 4,000,[23] and introduced the 145,655 GT *Breakaway* class in 2013 and the 165,157–169,116-GT *Breakaway*-plus class in 2015.[24] Cruise lines belonging to Carnival Corporation & plc, Princess Cruises and P&O Cruises, debuted the first of seven 142,714 GT+ *Royal*-class ships in 2013,[25] and the corporation's Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, and AIDA Cruises debuted the first of seven planned 133,596–135,225 GT *Vista*-class ships in 2016.[26] *AIDAnova*, the first of Carnival Corporation's nine planned Excellence-class ships, debuted in 2018 at 183,858 GT, with future ships in the class planned for Costa, P&O, Carnival, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n163. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"A New Class of Ultra-Eco-Friendly Ships for TUI Cruises\". *Fincantieri* (Press release). 13 July 2018.

ships in 2021 and 2022, which would have been the first ships over 200,000 GT not built for RCI, with the largest maximum passenger capacity, 9,500, of any ship.[164][50] One unfinished ship, formerly the *Global Dream*, was sold to Disney Cruise Line and is expected to debut in 2025,[101] while the other was sent for scrapping.[51]\n\n\nMSC Cruises has three additional World-class ships planned for 2024, 2025, and 2027, and at 215,800 GT and a capacity of 6,762 passengers; they will have the highest passengers capacities and will be the largest ships operated by a cruise line other than

Unlike ocean liners, they typically embark on round-trip voyages to various ports of call, where passengers may go on tours known as \"shore excursions\".[1] They may carry thousands of passengers in a single trip, and are some of the largest ships in the world by gross tonnage (GT), bigger than many cargo ships. Cruise ships started to exceed ocean liners in size and capacity in the mid-1990s;[2] before then, few were more than 50,000 GT.[3] In the decades since the size of the largest vessels has more than doubled.[4] There have been nine or more new cruise ships added every year since 2001, most of which are 100,000 GT or greater.[5] In the two decades between 1988 and 2009, the largest cruise ships grew a third longer (268 m to 360 m), almost doubled their widths (32.2 m to 60.5 m), doubled the total passengers (2,744 to 5,400), and tripled in volume (73,000 GT to 225,000 GT). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of November 2022[update], 25 passenger ships were on order or under construction with a publicly announced size of over 135,000 GT. RCI has three *Icon*-class cruise ships on order, with expected delivery between 2023 and 2026, the first, the *Icon of the Seas* will come in at 250,800 GT, which would make it the largest cruise ship in the world.[160] It is announced it will set sail on January 27, 2024. RCI also has a sixth *Oasis*-class ship, *Utopia of the Seas*, on order for 2024, and while its exact size is not published, RCI has previously stated that each new *Oasis*-class ship will be a little larger than the last.[161] Celebrity Cruises, which is owned by RCI's parent company Royal Caribbean Group, will introduce two 140,600 GT *Edge*-class ships in 2023 and 2025,[162] and TUI Cruises, a joint venture between Royal Caribbean Group and TUI Group, are introducing a new class of 161,000 GT cruise ships in 2024 and 2026.[163]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Saunders, Aaron (2013). *Giants of the seas : the ships that transformed modern cruising*.

The first ships over that size were the *Voyager*-class ships from Royal Caribbean Group's Royal Caribbean International (RCI). These ships, which debuted in 1998 at over 137,000 GT, were almost 30,000 GT larger than the next-largest cruise ships, and were some of the first ships designed to appeal to \"non-cruisers\", with features like a four-deck-high, 400-foot-long (120 m) atrium down the center of the ship, an ice rink, and a climbing wall.[1] In 2005, the five *Voyager*-class ships were overtaken by the 149,215 GT *Queen Mary 2* (*QM2*), the first non-RCI passenger ship over 135,000 GT and the only passenger ship currently in service that classifies itself as an ocean liner. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** \"Ship sales and transfers\". *Cruise Industry News*. 22 November 2014.

These engines are mounted under the stern of the ship and they each drive 20 foot wide rotatable propellers. In addition to the three main engines, there are four bow thrusters used for docking, each with 5,500 kilowatts of power or 7,380 horsepower.[20]\n\n\nAmong the *Oasis*-class ships, *Symphony of the Seas* uses 25% less fuel due to design changes. One of these is the implementation of a new system that releases tiny air bubbles under the hull to enable the vessel to glide more smoothly through the water.[23] The air layer also reduces excitation from the propellers, which cuts noise and vibration levels in the aft part of the ship.[24]\n\n\n\n## Construction and career[edit]\n\n\nOn 29 October 2015, the vessel's keel was laid by the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France.[5] *Symphony of the Seas* floated out on 9 June 2017.[25] Actors Alexa Vega and Carlos Pena Jr., and their 23-month-old son Ocean were chosen as the \"Godfamily\" of the ship, marking the first time in the industry that a family was a ship sponsor.[26] The christening ceremony took place in Miami in November 2018.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Symphony of the Seas* at Saint-Nazaire after her completion.\nFrom 15 to 18 February 2018, the cruise ship underwent sea trials[28] and was formally turned over to Royal Caribbean International on 23 March.[7] On 24 March, the ship left Saint-Nazaire for Málaga under the command of Rob Hempstead, arriving on 27 March,[29][30] and arrived at the vessel's first homeport of Barcelona, Spain on 29 March.[30]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Symphony of the Seas* in Naples, Italy\nOn 31 March 2018, *Symphony of the Seas* offered her first passenger cruise[3] and began her maiden voyage on 7 April for a week-long trip through the Mediterranean.[31][32]\n\n\nDuring her first season, *Symphony of the Seas* continued to sail on seven-night Western Mediterranean cruises from Barcelona. She repositioned on 28 October and arrived on 9 November at her new home port at the Royal Caribbean terminal at PortMiami in Florida, United States to provide cruises of the Caribbean.[33][34]\n\n\nIn January 2019, while the ship was docked in Nassau, Bahamas, a guest jumped overboard as part of a stunt and survived.[35][36] He and his friends were turned over to law enforcement but were not charged, and they were required to return home at their own expense.[37] Subsequently, Royal Caribbean announced that it would permanently ban the guests from sailing on any of its ships.\n\n\nIn August 2019, an Australian passenger died after going overboard during a seven-day cruise of the Caribbean. His body was recovered shortly afterwards by the ship's officials.[38][39]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic on cruise ships, Royal Caribbean suspended all services across most of its fleet, including *Symphony of the Seas*.[40][41] A 27-year old crew member from the housekeeping department was medically evacuated in March 2020 and subsequently died from COVID-19 in April 2020.[42][43] The family later sued Royal Caribbean for wrongful death.[42]\n\n\nIn 2020, Channel 4 in the United Kingdom aired a behind-the-scenes show featuring *Symphony of the Seas* called *Billion Pound Cruise*.[44] The three-part series was filmed at the end of 2019 and covers the on-board experiences*.*[45][46]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** \"*Symphony of the Seas* (34719)\". *Vessel Register for DNV*.
