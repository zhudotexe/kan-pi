As part of the Red Bull Junior Team, Vettel appeared for Toro Rosso later that year and was kept as a full-time driver for 2008, where he scored a victory in the Italian Grand Prix to become the then-youngest race winner. Vettel was promoted to Red Bull in 2009. With Red Bull, Vettel won four consecutive titles from 2010 to 2013, the first of which made him the sport's youngest World Champion. In 2013, he set the then-record for the most consecutive race wins with nine.[7] Vettel signed for Ferrari for 2015 replacing Fernando Alonso and became Mercedes' and Lewis Hamilton's closest challenger in two title fights in 2017 and 2018, although he finished both years as runner-up. He parted ways with Ferrari at the end of the 2020 season to race with Aston Martin for the 2021 and 2022 seasons, before retiring from Formula One at the end of the 2022 season.[8]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** Collantine, Keith (21 November 2007). \"F1 07 review: Driver rankings (1/3)\". *F1 Fanatic*.

In Formula One, Hamilton has won a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with Michael Schumacher), and holds the records for the most wins (103), pole positions (104), and podium finishes (197), among others.\n\n\nBorn and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton joined the McLaren Young Driver Programme in 1998. This led to a Formula One drive with McLaren from 2007 to 2012, making him the first black driver to race in the series. In his inaugural season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi Räikkönen by one point. The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion—making a crucial overtake on the last lap of the last race of the season—to become the then-youngest ever Formula One World Champion. After six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 20062004–052002–03200320022001 | GP2 SeriesFormula 3 Euro SeriesFormula Renault UKBritish Formula 3Formula Renault EurocupBritish Formula Renault Championship |\n| Championship titles |\n| 200620052003 | GP2 SeriesFormula 3 Euro SeriesFormula Renault UK |\n| Awards |\n| 202220202014, 2018, 2020–2120082007–08, 2014–15, 2017–202006–072003 | FIA Action of the YearSportsman of the YearFIA Personality of the YearBreakthrough of the YearInternational Racing Driver AwardAS Rookie of the YearAutosport British Club Driver of the Year |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![A man in a white t-shirt and glasses looks into the distance above and to the right of the photographer.](image) | This article is part of a series aboutLewis Hamilton |\n\n |\n| **British racing driver**\n* Grand Prix wins\n* Career achievements\n* Racist treatment\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Rivalries**\n* Fernando Alonso\n* Nico Rosberg\n* Sebastian Vettel\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** \"GP2 Series – History\".

In Formula One, Hamilton has won a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with Michael Schumacher), and holds the records for the most wins (103), pole positions (104), and podium finishes (197), among others.\n\n\nBorn and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton joined the McLaren Young Driver Programme in 1998. This led to a Formula One drive with McLaren from 2007 to 2012, making him the first black driver to race in the series. In his inaugural season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi Räikkönen by one point. The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion—making a crucial overtake on the last lap of the last race of the season—to become the then-youngest ever Formula One World Champion. After six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Matt Dickinson (3 November 2008). \"Lewis Hamilton admits: 'I just don't know how I kept my cool'\". *The Times*.

A four-time Formula One World Drivers' Champion, from 1987 until 2001 he held the record for most Grand Prix victories until Michael Schumacher surpassed Prost's total of 51 victories at the 2001 Belgian Grand Prix. \n\n\nProst discovered karting at the age of 14 during a family holiday. He progressed through motor sport's junior ranks, winning the French and European Formula Three championships, before joining the McLaren Formula One team in 1980 at the age of 24. He finished in the points on his Formula One debut – at the San Martín Autodrome in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he took his first podium a year later – and took his first race victory a year later at his home Grand Prix in France, driving for the factory Renault team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlain Prost was born in the commune of Lorette near the town of Saint-Chamond, in the département of Loire close to Saint-Étienne, France to André Prost and Marie-Rose Karatchian, born in France of Armenian descent.[3][4] Prost had one younger brother called Daniel, who died of cancer in September 1986.[5][4] Prost was an active and athletic child, who enthusiastically took part in diverse sports, including wrestling, roller skating and football. In doing so he broke his nose several times.[3][4] He considered careers as a gym instructor or a professional footballer before he discovered kart racing at the age of 14 while on a family holiday. This new sport quickly became his career of choice.[3][4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Prost, 38, Announces Retirement\" Archived 8 December 2015 at the Wayback Machine, *Los Angeles Times*, 25 September 1993\n2. **^** Roebuck, Nigel (1986) *Grand Prix Greats* p. 131 Book Club Associates ISBN 0-85059-792-7\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** Donaldson, Gerald (30 January 2015). \"Alain Prost | Formula 1®\". *Formula 1® – The Official F1® Website*.

From 2003 to 2012 he competed in the Andros Trophy, an ice racing championship, taking 38 race victories and winning the championship three times. Prost employed a smooth, relaxed style behind the wheel, deliberately modelling himself on personal heroes like Jackie Stewart and Jim Clark.[2] He was nicknamed \"The Professor\" for his intellectual approach to competition. Though it was not a name he particularly cared for, he would admit later that it was an appropriate summation of his approach to his racing. Skilled at setting up his car for race conditions, Prost would often conserve his brakes and tyres early in a race, leaving them fresher for a challenge at the end.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n134. **^** \"LÉGION D'HONNEUR Les promotions et les nominations du Nouvel An\". *Le Monde.fr* (in French). 4 January 1994.

Prost stated that when Senna died \"a part of himself had died also\", because their careers had been so bound together.[40] Senna had also felt the same when Prost had retired at the end of 1993, when he admitted to a close friend that he had realised how much of his motivation had come from fighting with Prost. Only a couple of days before his death, when filming an in-car lap of Imola for French television channel TF1, he greeted Prost, by then a pundit on the channel: \"A special hello to my...to our dear friend, Alain.

After Michael crashed it into a lamp post in Kerpen, his parents took him to the karting track at Kerpen-Horrem, where he became the youngest member of the karting club. His father built him a kart from discarded parts and, at the age of six, Schumacher won his first club championship. To support his son's racing, Rolf took on a second job renting and repairing karts, while his wife worked at the track's canteen. Nevertheless, when Michael needed a new engine costing 800 DM, his parents were unable to afford it; he was able to continue racing with support from local businessmen.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n251. **^** \"Magazine editor sacked over AI-generated Michael Schumacher interview\". *The Guardian*. 22 April 2023.

Schumacher has always been very protective of his private life and is known to dislike the celebrity spotlight.[205] From late 1991 until May 1996, Schumacher resided in Monaco. The family moved to a newly built mansion near Gland, Switzerland in 2007, covering an area of 650-square-metre (7,000 sq ft) with a private beach on Lake Geneva and featuring an underground garage and petrol station, with a vintage Shell fuel pump.[206] Schumacher and his wife own horse ranches in Texas and Switzerland.[207] Schumacher's younger brother Ralf, his son Mick, his nephew David and step-brother Sebastian Stahl have also been racing drivers.[208] Ralf Schumacher competed in Formula One for ten years, starting from 1997 until the end of 2007.[1] Mick became the third Schumacher to race in Formula One, having made his debut with Haas F1 Team in the 2021 season.[209]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n186. **^** Venkatesh, Tejas (30 December 2022). \"When Footballing legend Pele awarded 7-time F1 Champion Michael Schumacher ahead of his final race with Ferrari\". *The Sports Rush*.
