Economic growth was not stimulated to a net benefit and in the years after 2000, foreign tourism to NSW grew by less than tourism to Australia as a whole. A \"multiplier\" effect on broader economic development was not realized, as a simple \"multiplier\" analysis fails to capture that resources have to be redirected from elsewhere: the building of a stadium is at the expense of other public works such as extensions to hospitals. Building sporting venues does not add to the aggregate stock of productive capital in the years following the Games: \"Equestrian centers, softball compounds, and man-made rapids are not particularly useful beyond their immediate function.\"[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Dunc Gray Velodrome\n* Sydney Convention & Exhibition Centre: Boxing, Fencing, Judo, Weightlifting, Wrestling\n* Sydney Entertainment Centre: Volleyball (indoor final)\n* Dunc Gray Velodrome: Cycling (track)\n* Sydney International Shooting Centre: Shooting\n* Sydney International Equestrian Centre: Equestrian\n* Sydney International Regatta Centre: Rowing, Canoeing (sprint)\n* Blacktown Olympic Centre: Baseball, Softball\n* Western Sydney Parklands: Cycling (mountain biking)\n* Ryde Aquatic Leisure Centre: Water Polo\n* Penrith Whitewater Stadium: Canoeing (slalom)\n* Bondi Beach: Volleyball (beach)\n* Sydney Football Stadium: Football\n* Olympic Sailing Shore Base: Sailing\n* Centennial Parklands: Cycling (road)\n* Marathon course: Athletics (marathon)\n* North Sydney: Athletics (marathon start)\n* Sydney Opera House: Triathlon.\n\n\n#### Outside Sydney[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The 2000 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony at Stadium Australia, on 15 September 2000.\nThe opening ceremony began with a tribute to the Australian pastoral heritage of the Australian stockmen and the importance of the stock horse in Australia's heritage. It was produced and filmed by the Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation and the home nation broadcaster Channel 7.[20] This was introduced by lone rider Steve Jefferys and his rearing Australian Stock Horse *Ammo*. At the cracking of Jefferys' stockwhip, a further 120 riders entered the stadium, their stock horses performing intricate steps, including forming the five Olympic Rings, to a Special Olympics version of the theme, which Bruce Rowland had previously composed for the 1982 film *The Man from Snowy River*.\n\n\nThe Australian National Anthem was sung in the first verse by Human Nature and the second by Julie Anthony.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe final medal tally at the 2000 Summer Olympics was led by the United States, followed by Russia and China with host Australia in fourth place overall. Cameroon, Colombia, Latvia, Mozambique, and Slovenia won a gold medal for the first time in their Olympic histories, while Barbados, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, North Macedonia, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam won their first-ever Olympic medals. Australia will host the Summer Olympics again in 2032 at Brisbane, Queensland making it the first Oceanic country to host the Olympics three times.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe cost for Sydney 2000 compares with a cost of US$4.6 billion for Rio 2016, US$40\u201344 billion for Beijing 2008, and US$51 billion for Sochi 2014, the most expensive Olympics in history. The average cost for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2 billion, average cost overrun is 176%.\n\n\nIn 2000, the Auditor-General of New South Wales reported that the Sydney Games cost A$6.6\u00a0billion, with a net cost to the public between A$1.7 and A$2.4\u00a0billion.[11][12] In the years leading up to the games, funds were shifted from education and health programs to cover Olympic expenses.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Daily medal events |  |  |  | 13 | 14 | 15 | 15 | 18 | 18 | 18 | 26 | 25 | 18 | 11 | 17 | 17 | 11 | 40 | 24 | 300\n |\n| Cumulative total |  |  |  | 13 | 27 | 42 | 57 | 75 | 93 | 111 | 137 | 162 | 180 | 191 | 208 | 225 | 236 | 276 | 300\n |\n| September/October 2000\n | 13thWed\n | 14thThu\n | 15thFri\n | 16thSat\n | 17thSun\n | 18thMon\n | 19thTue\n | 20thWed\n | 21stThu\n | 22ndFri\n | 23rdSat\n | 24thSun\n | 25thMon\n | 26thTue\n | 27thWed\n | 28thThu\n | 29thFri\n | 30thSat\n | 1stSun\n | Total events\n |\n| September\n | Oct\n |\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Participating countries\n![](image)Number of athletes\n199 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in the Sydney Games, two more than in the 1996 Summer Olympics; in addition, there were four Timorese Individual Olympic Athletes at the 2000 Summer Olympics.

The Games saw 10,625 athletes compete,[2][3] some 600 more than expected, accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries,[2] with 301 medal events in 28 different sports.[2] The 2004 Games marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance, and also marked the first time Athens hosted the Games since their first modern incarnation in 1896 as well as the return of the Olympic games to its birthplace. Athens became one of only four cities at the time to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two occasions (together with Paris, London and Los Angeles). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA new medal obverse was introduced at these Games, replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since 1928. The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens[4] rectifying the long-running mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue.[5] The 2004 Games was the first of two consecutive Olympic games to be held in Southern Europe since the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, and was followed by the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\none month before the Olympic host city election was crucial in allaying lingering fears and concerns among the sporting community and some IOC members about the Greek ability to host international sporting events.[10] Another factor that contributed to the Greek capital's selection was a growing sentiment among some IOC members to restore some original values of the Olympics to the Modern Games, a component which they felt was lost during the 1996 Summer Olympics.[11]\n\n\nAfter leading all voting rounds, Athens easily defeated Rome in the fifth and final vote. Cape Town, Stockholm, and Buenos Aires, the three other cities that made the IOC shortlist, were eliminated in prior rounds of voting. Six other cities submitted applications, but their bids were dropped by the IOC in 1996. These cities were Istanbul, Lille, Rio de Janeiro (the latter won the rights to host the 2016 Summer Olympics in 2009), San Juan, Seville, and Saint Petersburg.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* ![](image) Media related to 2004 Summer Olympics at Wikimedia Commons\n* \"Athens 2004\". *Olympics.com*.

The 2004 Games were generally deemed to be a success, with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world. The final medal tally was led by the United States, followed by China and Russia with host nation Greece at 15th place. Several world and Olympic records were also broken during these Games. \n\n\nChile, Chinese Taipei, Dominican Republic, Georgia and Israel won their first Olympic gold medals. Eritrea and Paraguay won their first ever Olympic medals. \nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) won both their first Olympic medal and gold medal in this event.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAthens was chosen as the host city during the 106th IOC Session held in Lausanne, Switzerland on 5\u00a0September 1997. The Greek capital had lost its bid to organize the 1996 Summer Olympics to the American city of Atlanta nearly seven years before, during the 96th IOC Session in Tokyo, Japan on 18\u00a0September 1990. Under the direction of Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, Athens pursued another bid, this time for the right to host the Summer Olympics in 2004. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Olympic Games\n |\n| --- |\n| Summer | * 1896 Athens\n* 1900 Paris\n* 1904 St. Louis\n* 1908 London\n* 1912 Stockholm\n* 1916[a]\n* 1920 Antwerp\n* 1924 Paris\n* 1928 Amsterdam\n* 1932 Los Angeles\n* 1936 Berlin\n* 1940[b]\n* 1944[b]\n* 1948 London\n* 1952 Helsinki\n* 1956 Melbourne\n* 1960 Rome\n* 1964 Tokyo\n* 1968 Mexico City\n* 1972 Munich\n* 1976 Montreal\n* 1980 Moscow\n* 1984 Los Angeles\n* 1988 Seoul\n* 1992 Barcelona\n* 1996 Atlanta\n* 2000 Sydney\n* 2004 Athens\n* 2008 Beijing\n* 2012 London\n* 2016 Rio de Janeiro\n* 2020 Tokyo[c]\n* *2024 Paris*\n* *2028 Los Angeles*\n* *2032 Brisbane*\n* *2036*\n | ![Olympic rings](image)\n |\n| Winter | * 1924 Chamonix\n* 1928 St. Moritz\n* 1932 Lake Placid\n* 1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen\n* 1940[b]\n* 1944[b]\n* 1948 St. Moritz\n* 1952 Oslo\n* 1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo\n* 1960 Squaw Valley\n* 1964 Innsbruck\n* 1968 Grenoble\n* 1972 Sapporo\n* 1976 Innsbruck\n* 1980 Lake Placid\n* 1984 Sarajevo\n* 1988 Calgary\n* 1992 Albertville\n* 1994 Lillehammer\n* 1998 Nagano\n* 2002 Salt Lake City\n* 2006 Turin\n* 2010 Vancouver\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe sports featured at the 2004 Summer Olympics are listed below. Officially there were 301 events in 28 sports as swimming, diving, synchronised swimming and water polo are classified by the IOC as disciplines within the sport of aquatics, and wheelchair racing was a demonstration sport. For the first time, the wrestling category featured women's wrestling and in the fencing competition women competed in the sabre. American Kristin Heaston, who led off the qualifying round of women's shot put became the first woman to compete at the ancient site of Olympia.\n\n\nThe demonstration sport of wheelchair racing was a joint Olympic/Paralympic event, allowing a Paralympic event to occur within the Olympics, and for the future, opening up the wheelchair race to the able-bodied. The 2004 Summer Paralympics were also held in Athens, from 17 to 28 September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Weisman, Steven R.

This compares with US$14.9 million for Rio 2016, US$49.5 million for London 2012, and US$22.5 million for Beijing 2008. Average cost per event for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$19.9 million.\n\n\nCost per athlete for Athens 2004 was US$0.3 million. This compares with US$0.4 million for Rio 2016, US$1.4 million for London 2012, and US$0.6 million for Beijing 2008. Average cost per athlete for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$0.6 million.\n\n\nCost overrun for Athens 2004 was 49%, measured in real terms from the bid to host the Games. This compares with 51% for Rio 2016 and 76% for London 2012. Average cost overrun for the Summer Games since 1960 is 176%.\n\n\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy late March 2004, some Olympic projects were still behind schedule, and Greek authorities announced that a roof it had initially proposed as an optional, non-vital addition to the Aquatics Center would no longer be built. The main Olympic Stadium, the designated facility for the opening and closing ceremonies, was completed only two months before the Games opened. This stadium was completed with a retractable glass roof designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.

By July/August 2004, all venues were delivered: in August, the Olympic Stadium was officially completed and opened, joined or preceded by the official completion and openings of other venues within the Athens Olympic Sports Complex (OAKA), and the sports complexes in Faliro and Helliniko.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Olympic Flame at the opening ceremony\nMain article: 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Great Britain\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland\n* Ireland\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Latvia\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Monaco\n* Netherlands\n* Norway\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* San Marino\n* Serbia and Montenegro\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n |\n| Oceania | * American Samoa\n* Australia\n* Cook Islands\n* Fiji\n* Guam\n* Kiribati\n* Federated States of Micronesia\n* Nauru\n* New Zealand\n* Palau\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Samoa\n* Solomon Islands\n* Tonga\n* Vanuatu\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Events at the 2004 Summer Olympics (Athens)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Archery\n* Athletics\n* Badminton\n* Baseball\n* Basketball\n* Boxing\n* Canoeing\n* Cycling\n* Diving\n* Equestrian\n* Fencing\n* Field hockey\n* Football\n* Gymnastics\n* Handball\n* Judo\n* Modern pentathlon\n* Rowing\n* Sailing\n* Shooting\n* Softball\n* Swimming\n* Synchronized swimming\n* Table tennis\n* Taekwondo\n* Tennis\n* Triathlon\n* Volleyball\n* Water polo\n* Weightlifting\n* Wrestling\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### MOC[edit]\n\n\n* Markopoulo Olympic Equestrian Centre \u2013 equestrian\n* Markopoulo Olympic Shooting Centre \u2013 shooting\n\n\n### Football venues[edit]\n\n\n* Kaftanzoglio Stadium (Thessaloniki)\n* Karaiskakis Stadium (Piraeus)\n* Pampeloponnisiako Stadium (Patras)\n* Pankritio Stadium (Heraklion)\n* Panthessaliko Stadium (Volos)\n\n\n### Other venues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Galatsi Olympic Hall hosted gymnastics (rhythmic) and table tennis\n* Agios Kosmas Olympic Sailing Centre \u2013 sailing\n* Ano Liosia Olympic Hall \u2013 judo, wrestling\n* Galatsi Olympic Hall \u2013 gymnastics (rhythmic), table tennis\n* Kotzia Square \u2013 cycling (individual road race)\n* Marathon (city) \u2013 athletics (marathon start)\n* Nikaia Olympic Weightlifting Hall \u2013 weightlifting\n* Panathenaic Stadium \u2013 archery, athletics (marathons finish)\n* Peristeri Olympic Boxing Hall \u2013 boxing\n* Schinias Olympic Rowing and Canoeing Centre \u2013 canoeing (sprint), rowing\n* Stadium at Olympia \u2013 athletics (shot put)\n* Vouliagmeni Olympic Centre \u2013 cycling (individual time trial), triathlon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Nikaia Olympic Weightlifting Hall\n* Panathenaic Stadium\n* Parnitha Olympic Mountain Bike Venue\n* Peristeri Olympic Boxing Hall\n* Schinias Olympic Rowing and Canoeing Centre\n* Stadium at Olympia\n* Vouliagmeni Olympic Centre\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * Germany\n* United States\n* Czech Republic\n |\n\nPortals:* ![](image) 2000s\n* ![](image) Olympics\n* ![flag](image) Greece\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDr. Rogge had previously declared he would be breaking with tradition in his closing speech as President of the IOC and that he would never use the words of his predecessor Juan Antonio Samaranch, who used to always say 'these were the best ever games'.[6] Dr. Rogge had described Salt Lake City 2002 as \"superb games\" and in turn would continue after Athens 2004 and describe Turin 2006 as \"truly magnificent games.\"\n\n\nThe national anthems of Greece and China were played in a handover ceremony as both nations' flags were raised. The Mayor of Athens, Dora Bakoyianni, passed the Olympic Flag to the Mayor of Beijing, Wang Qishan. After a short cultural performance by Chinese actors, dancers, and musicians directed by eminent Chinese director Zhang Yimou, Rogge declared the 2004 Olympic Games closed.

The emblem is a reference to the ancient Olympic Games, where the kotinos was the official award of Olympic champions. In addition, the olive was the sacred tree of Athens.

The same report further explains that \u20ac2 billion of this amount was covered by the revenue of the ATHOC (from tickets, sponsors, broadcasting rights, merchandise sales etc.) and that another \u20ac2 billion was directly invested in upgrading hospitals and preserving archaeological sites.\nTherefore, the net infrastructure costs related to the preparation of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games was \u20ac4.5 billion, substantially lower than the reported estimates,[15] and mainly included long-standing fixed asset investments in numerous municipal and transport infrastructures.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis infrastructure was created and maintained to serve directly more than 150,000 ATHOC Staff, Volunteers, Olympic family members (IOC, NOCs, Federations), Partners & Sponsors and Media. It also kept the information flowing for all spectators, TV viewers, Website visitors and news readers around the world, prior and during the Games. The Media Center was located inside the Zappeion which is a Greek national exhibition center.\n\n\nBetween June and August 2004, the technology staff worked in the Technology Operations Center (TOC) from where it could centrally monitor and manage all the devices and flow of information, as well as handle any problems that occurred during the Games. The TOC was organized in teams (e.g. Systems, Telecommunications, Information Security, Data Network, Staffing, etc.) under a TOC Director and corresponding team leaders (Shift Managers). The TOC operated on a 24x7 basis with personnel organized into 12-hour shifts.\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Greek Government has created a corporation, Olympic Properties SA, which is overseeing the post-Olympics management, development and conversion of these facilities, some of which will be sold off (or have already been sold off) to the private sector,[34][35] while some other facilities are still in use, or have been converted for commercial use or modified for other sports.[36]\n\n\nAs of 2012 many conversion schemes have stalled owing to the Greek government-debt crisis, though many of these facilities are now under the control of domestic sporting clubs and organizations or the private sector.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe table below delineates the current status of the Athens Olympic facilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The transport infrastructure has been marginally improved by facilitating access for people with mobility constraints and improving signage in other languages. Haneda Airport has been expanded, and a hydrogen-powered bus rapid transit system has been introduced. Several sports and event facilities were built, including the new Olympic Stadium.

Two of the events were held in late 2018, but the main test event schedule commenced in June 2019 and was originally due to be completed in May 2020 prior to the start of the Olympics. Several of the events were incorporated into pre-existing championships, but some have been newly created specifically to serve as Olympic test events for the 2020 Summer Games.[196][197]\n\n\nIn February 2019, it was announced that the test events would be branded under the banner \"Ready, Steady, Tokyo\". The Tokyo Organizing Committee is responsible for 22 of the test events, with the remaining events being arranged by national and international sports federations. The first test event was World Sailing's World Cup Series, held at Enoshima in September 2018. The last scheduled event is the Tokyo Challenge Track Meet, which was originally due to take place at the Olympic Stadium on 6 May 2020.[198]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn February 2012, it was announced that Tokyo's former National Stadium, the central venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics, would undergo a \u00a5100\u00a0billion renovation for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics.[98] In November 2012, the Japan Sport Council announced that it was taking bids for proposed stadium designs. Of the 46\u00a0finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium. There was criticism of the Zaha Hadid design\u2014which was compared to a bicycle helmet and regarded as clashing with the surrounding Meiji Shrine\u2014and widespread disapproval of the costs, even with attempts to revise and \"optimize\" the design.[99]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n212. **^** \"IOC Refugee Olympic Team Tokyo2020\". *International Olympic Committee*. 7 August 2021.

While *ashita* literally means \"tomorrow\", it is intentionally spelled as *mirai*, \"future\".[229] The official slogan *United by Emotion* was unveiled on 17 February 2020. The slogan was used solely in English.[230]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMass logging for construction of the Olympic venues received international criticism. Petitions, containing more than 140,000 signatures in total, were delivered to the Japanese embassies in Switzerland and Germany, expressing concerns over claims of using tropical wood sourced from Shin Yang, a Malaysian company with a record of human rights abuses, illegal logging, and rainforest destruction.[245][246] In February 2018, the Olympics Organizing Committee admitted that 87% of plywood panels used to build the new national stadium was sourced from endangered rainforests.[247]\n\n\nPortions of the Games were scheduled for locations impacted by the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The hosting of events in these locations was promoted as a means of furthering recovery in the regions, with the Games sometimes being promoted as the \"Recovery Olympics\".[248][249]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano). Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice.[d] The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the first and only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year[12] and the first Summer Olympics since 1900 to be held in a non-leap year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n177. **^** Spungin, Tal (23 July 2021). \"Olympics: Moment of silence for Munich massacre victims for first time\". *The Jerusalem Post*.
