As of 2006, it was widely considered the most popular breed in the world.[36] And it is the most popular dog by ownership in Canada, New Zealand[37] and the United Kingdom.[38] In 2006 both the United Kingdom and the United States, there are well over twice as many registered Labradors as the next most popular breed.[39][40] If the comparison is limited to dog breeds of a similar size, then there are around 3\u20135\u00a0times as many Labradors registered in both countries as the next most popular breeds, the German shepherd dog and Golden retriever.[39][40]\n\n\nThey are the most popular breed of assistance dog in the United States, Australia, and many other countries,[41] as well as being widely used by police and other official bodies for their detection and working abilities. Approximately 60\u201370% of all guide dogs in the United States are Labradors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \nDennis-Bryan, Kim (2020) [2012]. *The Complete Dog Breed Book* (2nd\u00a0ed.).

It appeared in Paris in the mid-nineteenth century, apparently the result of cross-breeding of Toy Bulldogs imported from England and local Parisian ratters.[4]\n\n\nIt is commonly kept as a pet, and is among the most frequently registered dogs in a number of countries including Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the nineteenth century bulldogs were bred in the United Kingdom for purposes other than traditional blood sports such as bull-baiting, which were banned in 1835.[5]:\u200a5 By the middle of the century there were miniature bulldogs, often weighing some 7\u201311\u00a0kg (15\u201324\u00a0lb), though some weighed considerably less.[5]:\u200a6\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCousens, a meeting was held to set up a breed club in order to seek individual recognition for the French breed.[5]:\u200a7 The adopted breed standard was the same one which was already in use in America, France, Germany and Austria.[6]:\u200a58 Despite opposition from Miniature Bulldog (the new breed name for the Toy Bulldog) and Bulldog breeders,[6]:\u200a59 in 1905, the Kennel Club changed its policy on the breed and recognized them separate from the English variety, initially as the Bouledogue Francais, then later in 1912 with the name changed to the French Bulldog.[5]:\u200a7\n\n\nIt is commonly kept as a pet: in 2020 it was the second-most registered dog in the United Kingdom,[13] and the fourth-most in the United States.[12] They were rated the third-most popular dog in Australia in 2017.[14] In 2019, in the United Kingdom, the French Bulldog had 375 export pedigrees[15] and a total of 33,661 registered dogs.[16] By comparison, the Labrador Retriever had over 36,700 dogs and the Cocker Spaniel fewer than 22,000.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** FCI breeds nomenclature: Bouledogue Fran\u00e7ais (101).

Americans had been importing French Bulldogs for a while, but it was not until 1885 when they were brought over in order to set up an American-based breeding program. They were mostly owned by society ladies, who first displayed them at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1896.[9] They arrived again in the following year with even more entries, where the judging of the breed would go on to have future ramifications. The judge in question at the dog show, George Raper, only chose winners with \"rose ears\"\u2014ears that folded at the tip, as with the standard for Bulldogs.[10] The ladies formed the French Bull Dog Club of America and created the breed standard which stated for the first time that the \"erect bat ear\" was the correct type.[5]:\u200a7\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** [staff] (4 February 2022).

It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog.\n\n\nThe breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Herding dogs | * Bearded Collie\n* Border Collie\n* Cardigan Welsh Corgi\n* Lancashire Heeler\n* Old English Sheepdog\n* Pembroke Welsh Corgi\n* Rough Collie\n* Shetland Sheepdog\n* Smithfield\n* Smooth Collie\n* Welsh Sheepdog\n |\n| Other | * Bulldog\n* Bullmastiff\n* Cavalier King Charles Spaniel\n* English Mastiff\n* King Charles Spaniel\n* Northern Inuit Dog\n |\n| Extinct | * Black and Tan Terrier\n* Blue Paul Terrier\n* Buckhound\n* Cumberland Sheepdog\n* Cur\n* Dumfriesshire Black and Tan Foxhound\n* English Water Spaniel\n* English White Terrier\n* Norfolk Spaniel\n* North Country Beagle\n* Old English Bulldog\n* Old Welsh Grey Sheepdog\n* Paisley Terrier\n* Southern Hound\n* Sleuth hound\n* Staghound\n* Talbot Hound\n* Toy Bulldog\n* Toy Trawler Spaniel\n* Turnspit dog\n* Tweed Water Spaniel\n* Welsh Hillman\n |\n| **Types:** Collies, Fell Terriers, Fox Terriers, Longdogs & Lurchers\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nScottish breed of dog\n\nFor other uses, see Golden Retriever (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\nDog breed\n\n\n| Golden Retriever |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Other names | * Flat-coated Retriever, Golden\n* Yellow or Golden Retriever\n |\n| Origin | Scotland |\n| Foundation stock | * Flat-coated Retriever\n* Tweed Water Spaniel\n* Red Setter\n* Bloodhound\n* Labrador Retriever\n |\n| \n\n| Traits |\n| --- |\n| Height | \nMales | \n56\u201361\u00a0cm (22\u201324\u00a0in) |\n|  | \nFemales | \n51\u201356\u00a0cm (20\u201322\u00a0in) |\n| Weight | \n25\u201334\u00a0kg (55\u201375\u00a0lb) |\n| Coat | \nFlat or wavy double coat with good feathering, dense water-resistant undercoat |\n| Colour | \nAny shade of gold or cream |\n| Litter\u00a0size | 7.2\u00b12.7[1]:\u200a4 |\n| Life\u00a0span | \n12\u201313 years |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Kennel club standards |\n| --- |\n| The Kennel Club | standard |\n| F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale | standard |\n\n |\n| Dog (domestic dog) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGundogs\n |\n| --- |\n| Pointersand setters | * Ari\u00e8ge Pointer\n* Blue Picardy Spaniel\n* Bracco Italiano\n* Braque d'Auvergne\n* Braque du Bourbonnais\n* Braque Fran\u00e7ais\n* Braque Saint-Germain\n* Brittany\n* Burgos Pointer\n* Ca M\u00e8 Mallorqu\u00ed\n* Cesky Fousek\n* Drentse Patrijshond\n* English Setter\n* French Spaniel\n* German Longhaired Pointer\n* German Roughhaired Pointer\n* German Shorthaired Pointer\n* German Wirehaired Pointer\n* Gordon Setter\n* Irish Red and White Setter\n* Irish Setter\n* Large M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder\n* Old Danish Pointer\n* Pach\u00f3n Navarro\n* Picardy Spaniel\n* Perdigueiro Galego\n* Pointer\n* Portuguese Pointer\n* Pudelpointer\n* Saint-Usuge Spaniel\n* Slovakian Roughhaired Pointer\n* Small M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder\n* Spinone Italiano\n* Stabyhoun\n* Vizsla\n* Weimaraner\n* Wirehaired Pointing Griffon\n* Wirehaired Vizsla\n |\n| Retrievers | * Chesapeake Bay Retriever\n* Curly-coated Retriever\n* Flat-coated Retriever\n* Golden Retriever\n* Labrador Retriever\n* Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Berkowitz, Bonnie (30 January 2021). \"'Who pours the kibble?'

It has been suggested that these variations in aggression are partially caused by genetic factors.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** MacSmith, James (17 August 2021). \"Australia's most popular dog breeds\". *The Daily Telegraph*.
