His extensive, rich authorship consists mostly of novels, but also of plays, essays, literary criticisms, and journalism. His major breakthroughs include *La ciudad y los perros* (lit. \"The City and the Dogs\"/trans. \"The Time of the Hero\", 1963), *La casa verde* (\"The Green House\", 1965), *La guerra del fin del mundo* (\"The War of the End of the World\", 1984), and the monumental *Conversaci\u00f3n en la catedral* (\"Conversation in the Cathedral\", 1969). His works reflect his ardent love of storytelling. They are characterized by rich language and cover a range of genres\u2014from autobiographical books and historical novels to erotic fiction and thrillers such as *La t\u00eda Julia y el escribidor* (\"Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter\", 1982) and *Travesuras de la ni\u00f1a mala* (\"The Bad Girl\", 2007). He has also won literary prizes such as the 1967 R\u00f3mulo Gallegos Prize, 1986 Prince of Asturias Award, 1994 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, and the 1995 Jerusalem Prize.[3][4]\n\n\n\n## Reactions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Peter Englund, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, surrounded by the international media when announcing the Nobel Prize in literature 2010.\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to Mario Vargas Llosa was well received around the world. \"The world recognizes the intelligence and the will of freedom and democracy by Vargas Llosa and it is an act of enormous justice\" said Alan Garc\u00eda, president of Peru. Spanish writer Javier Mar\u00edas said \"it is one of those prizes that never or almost never needs to be discussed.\"[5] Novelist William Boyd paid tribute to \"a great chroncicler of the highs and lows of our carnal and passionate adventures as human beings\".[6] \nThe prize was also celebrated by Bernard Kouchner, foreign minister of France, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, president of Mexico, and the King of Spain Juan Carlos, among others.[5]\n\n\nVargas Llosa himself said he was delighted but surprised: \"For years I haven't thought about the Nobel prize at all. They didn't mention me in recent years so I didn't expect it. It's been a surprise, very nice, but a surprise. At first I thought it was a joke,\" he told RPP Noticias.[7]\n\n\n\n## Nobel lecture[edit]\n\n\nIn his Nobel lecture *Elogio de la lectura y la ficci\u00f3n*, delivered at the Swedish Academy on 7 December 2010,[8] Vargas Llosa paid tribute to the power of fiction and said he believed it was essential to a healthy society. \"We would be worse than we are without the good books we have read, more conformist, not as restless, more submissive, and the critical spirit, the engine of progress, would not even exist,\" he argued. \"Like writing, reading is a protest against the insufficiencies of life. When we look in fiction for what is missing in life, we are saying, with no need to say it or even to know it, that life as it is does not satisfy our thirst for the absolute \u2013 the foundation of the human condition \u2013 and should be better.\"[9]\n\n\n\n## Award ceremony presentation speech[edit]\n\n\nIn his award ceremony speech on 10 December 2010 Per W\u00e4stberg, member of the Swedish Academy and chairman of the Nobel committee for literature, said of Vargas Llosa: \n\n\n\n\n> \"Mario Vargas Llosa's writing has shaped our image of South America and has its own chapter in the history of contemporary literature. In his early years, he was a renewer of the novel; today, an epic poet of not only Latin American stature. His wide embrace enfolds all literary genres.\", \"Vargas Llosa has led us through unfamiliar milieux with an authority that lends the authenticity of a 19th-century explorer. He links the narrative tradition of Balzac and Tolstoy to the modernistic experiments of William Faulkner.\" \n> \n> \n> \"Vargas Llosa's novels never bow to diktat; they are polyphonic and open to interpretation, emphasising the diversity of Latin America's social and ethnic patterns. He lends voice to the silenced and oppressed \u2013 an aesthetic feat and an ethical act. He has an unreserved interest in people \u2013 from presidents to prostitutes \u2013 and nothing is alien to him, from the arrogance of statesmen to love's subtlest plots.\"\n> \n> \n> \"Vargas Llosa believes in the force of literature. Without literature there would be no rendition of mankind's possibilities and hidden places.

There have been seven years in which the Nobel Prize in Literature was not awarded (1914, 1918, 1935, 1940\u20131943). There have been three years for which the Nobel Prize in Literature was delayed one year: the prizes for 1915,[13] 1949[14] and 2018[15][16][6] were each awarded together with that of the following year in October of the following year. As of 2022, there have been 29 English-speaking laureates of the Nobel Prize in Literature, followed by French with 16 laureates and German with 14 laureates. France has the highest number of Nobel laureates.\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n* 1980\n* 1990\n* 2000\n* 2010\n* 2020\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2022, the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to 119 individuals.[6] The youngest laureate was Rudyard Kipling, who was 41 years old when he was awarded in 1907. The oldest laureate to receive the prize was Doris Lessing, who was 88 when she was awarded in 2007. It has been awarded posthumously once, to Erik Axel Karlfeldt in 1931.[7] When he received the award in 1958, Russian-born Boris Pasternak was forced to publicly reject the award under pressure from the government of the Soviet Union. In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre made known that he did not wish to accept the Nobel Prize in Literature,[8] as he had consistently refused all official honors in the past.[9] However the Nobel committee does not acknowledge refusals, and includes Pasternak and Sartre in its list of Nobel laureates.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Alfred Nobel \u2013 The Man Behind the Nobel Prize\".

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Swedish Academy.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded in 1901 to Sully Prudhomme of France.[3] Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[4] In 1901, Prudhomme received 150,782 SEK, which is equivalent to 8,823,637.78 SEK in January 2018. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1Rabindranath Tagore (Nobel Prize in Literature 1913) wrote in Bengali and English, Samuel Beckett (Nobel Prize in Literature 1969) wrote in French and English and Joseph Brodsky (Nobel Prize in Literature 1987) wrote poetry in Russian and prose in English. These three Nobel laureates have been sorted under Bengali, French and Russian, respectively.[132]\n\n\n2Karl Adolph Gjellerup (Nobel Prize in Literature 1917) wrote in Danish and German.\n\n\n\n## Nobel laureates by sex[edit]\n\n\nThe 120 Nobel laureates in literature from 1901 to 2023 were from the following sexes:\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Decade** | **Male** | **Female** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900\u20131909\n | 9\n | 1\n |\n| 1910\u20131919\n | 9\n | 0\n |\n| 1920\u20131929\n | 8\n | 2\n |\n| 1930\u20131939\n | 8\n | 1\n |\n| 1940\u20131949\n | 5\n | 1\n |\n| 1950\u20131959\n | 10\n | 0\n |\n| 1960\u20131969\n | 10\n | 1\n |\n| 1970\u20131979\n | 11\n | 0\n |\n| 1980\u20131989\n | 10\n | 0\n |\n| 1990\u20131999\n | 7\n | 3\n |\n| 2000\u20132009\n | 7\n | 3\n |\n| 2010\u20132019\n | 7\n | 3\n |\n| 2020\u20132029\n | 2\n | 2\n |\n| **Total** | 103\n | 17\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Nobel Prize in Literature 1949\".

His earlier works such as *B\u00e1i g\u01d2u qi\u016bqi\u0101n ji\u00e0* (\"White Dog and the Swing\", 1981\u20131989) \u2013 were written according to the prevailing literary dictates of the ruling regime. Over time, however, his storytelling began to seek out its own, more independent paths. His works include *H\u00f3ng g\u0101oliang ji\u0101z\u00fa* (\"Red Sorghum\", 1986), *Tiant\u00e0ng su\u00e0nt\u00e1i zh\u012b g\u0113* (\"The Garlic Ballads\", 1988) and *Sh\u00e9ngsi p\u00edl\u00e1o* (\"Life and Death are Wearing Me Out\", 2006). His narrative style bears the hallmarks of magical realism and often use older Chinese literature and popular oral traditions as a starting point, combining these with contemporary social issues. Among his other famous literary works include *Sh\u00ed c\u01ceo ji\u0101z\u00fa* (\"The Herbivorous Family\", 1993) and *F\u0113ng r\u01d4 f\u00e9i t\u00fan* (\"Big Breasts & Wide Hips\", 1995).[3][2]\n\n\n\n## Reactions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mo Yan in Stockholm to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature 2012\nAged 57 at the time of the announcement, he was the 109th recipient of the award and the first ever resident of mainland China to receive it. In his Award Ceremony Speech, Per W\u00e4stberg explained: \"Mo Yan is a poet who tears down stereotypical propaganda posters, elevating the individual from an anonymous human mass. Using ridicule and sarcasm Mo Yan attacks history and its falsifications as well as deprivation and political hypocrisy.\"[4]\n\n\nSwedish Academy's permanent secretary Peter Englund said less formally, \"He has such a damn unique way of writing. If you read half a page of Mo Yan you immediately recognize it as him\".[5] During a seminar on Mo Yan at Beijing Normal University in April 2011, executive director of CLT and WLT, revealed that he had proposed Mo Yan for the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature. Davis address that, given Mo Yan's fame and production, his work should serve as the best ground in quality and depth of modern Chinese literature for Westerners.[6]\n\n\nFollowing the awarding of the prize to Mo Yan in 2012, G\u00f6ran Malmqvist, a member of the Swedish Academy, was criticized for a possible conflict of interest, as he had close personal and economic relations to Mo Yan.[7] He had translated several of Mo Yan's works into Swedish and published some through his own publishing house. Mo Yan had also written a laudatory preface to one of Malmqvist's own books, and been a close friend of Malmqvist's wife for 15 years. The Nobel committee denied that this constituted a conflict of interest, and said that it would have been absurd for Malmqvist to recuse.[8][7][9]\n\n\n\n## Controversies and criticism[edit]\n\n\nWinning the Nobel Prize occasioned both support and criticism. Firstly, it won warm welcome from the Chinese government immediately after the announcement of the Nobel Prize. The *People's Daily Online*, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, published on 11 October 2012: \"Congratulations to Mo Yan for winning the Nobel Prize in Literature! It is the first time for a writer of Chinese nationality to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Today is the day that Chinese writers have awaited for too long and that Chinese people have awaited for too long.\"[10]\n\n\nThe Chinese writer Ma Jian deplored Mo Yan's lack of solidarity and commitment to other Chinese writers and intellectuals who were punished or detained in violation of their constitutionally protected freedom of expression.[11] Several other Chinese dissidents such as Ye Du and Ai Weiwei also criticized him,[12] as did 2009 Nobel Laureate Herta M\u00fcller who called the decision a \"catastrophe\".[13] A specific criticism was that Mo hand-copied Mao Zedong's influential *Yan'an Talks on Literature and Art* in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the speech, which described the writer's responsibility to place politics before art.[14] These \"Talks\"\u2014which were the intellectual handcuffs of Chinese writers throughout the Mao era and were almost universally reviled by writers during the years between Mao's death in 1976 and the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre\u2014were now again being held up for adulation. Mo Yan not only agreed but has gone further than others to explain that the \"Talks,\" in their time, had \"historical necessity\" and \"played a positive role.\"[15] He has also attracted criticism for his supposed good relationship with the Chinese Communist Party in general.[16]\n\n\nMo Yan released a publication by the name of *Big Breasts and Wide Hips* that caught criticism and came under fire for its sexual content and how it portrayed the Communist Party in early 20th century China.[17] Due to the abundance of negative feedback from the community, Mo Yan was forced to withdraw this short story from publication.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAnna Sun, an assistant professor of Sociology and Asian studies at Kenyon College, criticized Mo's writing as coarse, predictable, and lacking in aesthetic conviction. \"Mo Yan's language is striking indeed,\" she writes, but it is striking because \"it is diseased. The disease is caused by the conscious renunciation of China's cultural past at the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.\"[18] Charles Laughlin of the University of Virginia, however, accuses Sun of \"piling up aesthetic objections to conceal ideological conflict,\" comparing her characterization of Mo to the official China Writers Association's characterization of Gao Xingjian as a mediocre writer when Gao won the Nobel Prize in 2000.[19]\n\n\nPerry Link, describing Mo Yan's fiction and politics in the *New York Review of Books*, asked, \"Does this writer deserve the prize?\" Link commented that Chinese writers, whether \"inside the system\" or not, \"all must choose how they will relate to their country's authoritarian government.\" This \"inevitably involves calculations, trade-offs, and the playing of cards in various ways.\" Link's main criticism was that Mo Yan \"invoke(d) a kind of daft hilarity when treating 'sensitive' events\" such as the Great Chinese Famine and the Cultural Revolution. Link believed that the regime approved it because \"this mode of writing is useful not just because it diverts a square look at history but because of its function as a safety valve.\" As Link pointed out, to treat sensitive topics as jokes might be better than banning them outright. Link compared Mo to Liu Xiaobo, winner of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, who was jailed for dissidence, whose moral choices were \"highly unusual.\" It would be wrong, Link concludes, \"for spectators like you and me, who enjoy the comfort of distance, to demand that Mo Yan risk all and be another Liu Xiaobo. But it would be even more wrong to mistake the clear difference between the two.\"[20]\n\n\nCharles Laughlin, however, published an article called *What Mo Yan's Detractors Get Wrong*[21] on ChinaFile against Link's argument. As a response to Link's criticism that Mo Yan trivialized serious historical tragedies by using black humor and what he called \"daft hilarity\", Laughlin emphasized the distinction between documentary and art and literature: \"art and literature, particularly since the traumas of the twentieth century, never simply document experience.\" Laughlin argued that Mo Yan's intended readers already know that \"the Great Leap Forward led to a catastrophic famine, and any artistic approach to historical trauma is inflected or refracted.\" According to him, \"Mo Yan writes about the period he writes about because they were traumatic, not because they were hilarious.\"[21]\n\n\nSalman Rushdie called Mo Yan a \"patsy\" for refusing to sign a petition asking for Liu Xiaobo's freedom.[22] Pankaj Mishra saw an \"unexamined assumption\" lurking in the \"western scorn\" for these choices, namely that \"Anglo-American writers\" were not criticized for similarly apolitical attitudes.[23]\n\n\nIn a rare interview with German newspaper Der Spiegel, Mo Yan, using a translator said \"I know he envies me for this award and I understand this. But his criticism is unjustified,\" about fellow Chinese writer and musician Liao Yiwu.[24] He also stated that his major critics, \"use magnifying glasses to look for my flaws and they even distort the meaning of my poems\".[24]\n\n\nIn his Nobel Lecture, Mo Yan himself commented, \"At first I thought I was the target of the disputes, but over time I've come to realize that the real target was a person who had nothing to do with me. Like someone watching a play in a theater, I observed the performances around me. I saw the winner of the prize both garlanded with flowers and besieged by stone-throwers and mudslingers.\" He concluded that \"for a writer, the best way to speak is by writing. You will find everything I need to say in my works. Speech is carried off by the wind; the written word can never be obliterated.\"[25]\n\n\nFollowing the awarding of the prize to Mo Yan in 2012, G\u00f6ran Malmqvist, a member of the Swedish Academy, was criticized for a possible conflict of interest, as he had close personal and economic relations to Mo Yan.[7] He had translated several of Mo Yan's works into Swedish and published some through his own publishing house. Mo Yan had also written a laudatory preface to one of Malmqvist's own books, and been a close friend of Malmqvist's wife for 15 years. The Nobel committee denied that this constituted a conflict of interest, and said that it would have been absurd for Malmqvist to recuse.[26][7][27]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* **11 October 2012**: Permanent secretary Peter Englund's announcement of the 2012 Nobel Prize laureate in Literature\n\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n\n\n* **6 December 2012**: Nobel laureate Mo Yan during the Academy's press conference.\n\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The Nobel Prize in Literature 2012 nobelprize.org\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Mo Yan britannica.com\n3. **^** Mo Yan \u2013 Facts nobelprize.org\n4. **^** Per W\u00e4stberg (10 December 2012). \"The Nobel Prize in Literature 2012 \u2013 Award Ceremony Speech\".

She grew up in a small Canadian town \u2013 Huron County, Ontario \u2013 the kind of environment that often provides the backdrops for her stories. These often accommodate the entire epic complexity of the novel in just a few short pages and the underlying themes of her work are often relationship problems and moral conflicts. The relationship between memory and reality is another recurring theme she uses to create tension. With subtle means, she is able to demonstrate the impact that seemingly trivial events can have on a person's life. Her famous short story collections include *Dance of the Happy Shades* (1969), *Who Do You Think You Are?* (1978), *The Progress of Love* (1986), *The Love of a Good Woman* (1998), and *Runaway* (2004).[6][3]\n\n\n\n## Award ceremony[edit]\n\n\nDue to her health condition and old age, Alice Munro was not able to personally participate in the award ceremony in Stockholm. Mrs. Jenny Munro, her daughter, received the diploma, medal and monetary prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf on her behalf on December 10, 2013.[7]\n\n\n\nPeter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, expressed the rightfulness of bestowing Munro the Nobel prize, by saying: \n\n\n> \"The seemingly prosaic surface level in Alice Munro\u2019s short stories is interwoven in an interesting way with her writing style and distinctive storytelling technique. The minimalist style we encounter is clean, transparent, subtle and stunningly precise. It is a challenge to find an unessential word or a superfluous phrase. Reading one of her texts is like watching a cat walk across a laid dinner table. A brief short story can often cover decades, summarising a life, as she moves deftly between different periods. No wonder Alice Munro is often able to say more in 30 pages than an ordinary novelist is capable of in 300. She is a virtuoso of the elliptical and \u2013 as the Academy said in its brief prize citation \u2013 the master of the contemporary short story.\"[7]\n> \n> \n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The Nobel Prize in Literature 2013 nobelprize.org\n2. **^** Saul Bellow, the 1976 laureate, was born in Canada, but he moved to the United States at age nine and became a US citizen at twenty-six.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Alice Munro britannica.com\n4. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Literature 2013 \u2013 Press Release\" (PDF). 10 October 2013.

M. G. Le Cl\u00e9zio in 2008.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Patrick Modiano\n\nPatrick Modiano's stories are often characterized by their exploration of universal but difficult questions, at the same time as they are grounded in everyday settings and historical events like in *La Place de l'\u00c9toile* (\"The Place of the Star\", 1968). His works center around subjects like memory, oblivion, identity, and guilt as in *Rue des Boutiques Obscures* (\"Missing Person\", 1978) and *Dora Bruder* (1997). The city of Paris plays a central role in his writing \u2013 *Accident nocturne* (\"Paris Nocturne\", 2003), and his stories are often based on events that occurred during the German occupation of France during World War II. At times, Modiano's stories are based on his own experience or on interviews, newspaper articles, or his own notes. Among his other famous literary works include *Un cirque passe* (\"After the Circus\", 1992), *Quartier Perdu* (\"A Trace of Malice\", 1984), and *L'Herbe des nuits* (\"The Black Notebook\", 2012).[3][2]\n\n\n\n## Reactions[edit]\n\n\nCalled \"a Marcel Proust of our time\",[4] Modiano heard the news via a mobile phone call from his daughter while walking through Paris, \"just next to the Jardin du Luxembourg\" where he lives.[5] The win was unexpected, even to those in the Anglo-American world most familiar with his work.[6][7] The puzzlement was likely related to limited knowledge of Modiano in the English-speaking world; despite his prolific output, fewer than a dozen of his works had been translated into English, and several of those were out of print before the academy's announcement. The award-winning *Missing Person* had sold just 2,425 copies in the US prior to the Nobel.[4] Even Peter Englund, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, noted that many people outside France would likely be unfamiliar with Modiano and his work. \"He is well-known in France, but not anywhere else,\" he said in a post-announcement interview.[8] Yale University Press quickly published three of his novels in English.\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* **6 December 2014**: Patrick Modiano during the Swedish Academy's press conference with Peter Englund.\n\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The Nobel Prize in Literature 2014 nobelprize.org\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Patrick Modiano\". *Encyclopedia Britannica*.
