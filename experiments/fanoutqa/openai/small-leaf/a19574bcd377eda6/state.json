The surname of the male-line descendants of Queen Elizabeth II, except for women who marry, is Mountbatten-Windsor, reflecting the name taken by her Greek-born husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, upon his naturalisation. A surname is generally not needed by members of the royal family who are entitled to the titles of prince or princess and the style His or Her Royal Highness. Such individuals use surnames on official documents such as marriage registers.[16]\n\n\n\n## Public role[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n68. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"UK Royal Family: Who is in it and how does it work?\".
