However, if a deceased billionaire's fortune has been dispersed, it will not appear as a single listing, and each recipient will only appear if his or her own total net worth is over a $Billion (his or her net worth will not be combined with family members')[7] Royal families and dictators that have their wealth contingent on a position are always excluded from these lists.[9]\n\n\n\n## Annual rankings[edit]\n\n\n\nThe rankings are published annually in March, so the net worths listed are snapshots taken at that time. These lists only show the top 10 wealthiest billionaires for each year.\n\n\n\n### Legend[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 8 ![Increase](image) | Jim Walton | $54.6 billion ![Increase](image) | 71\n | ![](image) United States | Walmart |\n| 9 ![Increase](image) | Alice Walton | $54.4 billion ![Increase](image) | 70\n | ![](image) United States | Walmart |\n| 10 ![Increase](image) | S.

The United States accounted for 403 billionaires, followed by China with 89 and Russia with 62.[40] It was the first time China, while including Hong Kong, placed second.[39] A total of 55 countries were represented on the 2010 list, including Finland and Pakistan which claimed their first billionaires.[40] Eighty-nine women made the list, but only 14 of them were self-made.[40] The combined net worth of the list was $3.6 trillion, up 50 percent from 2009's $2.4 trillion, while the average net worth was $3.5 billion.[8]\n\n\nThe 2010 list featured 164 re-entries and 97 true newcomers.[8] Asia accounted for more than 100 of the new entrants. Overall, just 12 percent of the list lost wealth since 2009, and 30 people fell off the list. 13 others died.[39] Of the 89 women, 12 were newcomers in 2010. Steve Forbes said the growing number of billionaires was a clear sign that the world's economy was recovering from 2009's global financial crisis.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** Dolan, Kerry A.; Kroll, Luisa (3 March 2014). \"Inside The 2014 Forbes Billionaires List: Facts And Figures\". *Forbes*.
