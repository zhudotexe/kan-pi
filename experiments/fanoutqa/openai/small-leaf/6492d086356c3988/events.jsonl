K. Rowling. He first appears in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Lupin remains in the story following his resignation from this post, serving as a friend and ally of the central character, Harry Potter. In the films, he is portrayed by David Thewlis as an adult, and James Utechin as a teenager.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Fictional character biography[edit]\n\n\nLupin is a half-blood, born, according to the series, to wizard Lyall Lupin and his Muggle wife Hope Howell[2] on March 10, 1960. He was bitten by the vicious werewolf Fenrir Greyback when he was a small child, and became infected with lycanthropy; the condition being incurable, he was doomed to live his life as a werewolf. Lupin and his parents feared he would be unable to attend Hogwarts, but headmaster Albus Dumbledore allowed him to enrol—provided certain protective measures were taken. A house was built in Hogsmeade with a secret passage leading to it from under the Whomping Willow. Lupin was smuggled into and confined in this house for his monthly transformations. The transformation from human to werewolf is difficult and painful, and if the creature is isolated, it will become frustrated and harm itself if unable to attack. The villagers mistook Lupin's howling as extremely violent ghosts. The house was dubbed \"the Shrieking Shack\" and became known as the most haunted building in Britain. Although it was never actually haunted, Dumbledore promoted this rumour to discourage curious villagers from exploring. It eventually became the Marauders' secret hangout when they achieved complete Animagi transformations.\n\n\nWhen Lupin started Hogwarts, his condition was kept secret, but James Potter, Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew deduced the truth in their second year. By their fifth year, they secretly (and illegally) learned how to become Animagi to keep Lupin company during his transformations. His lycanthropy was not transmittable to them in their Animagus forms, nor was he a threat to them while they were animals. Additionally, James and Sirius' Animagi (a stag and a large dog) were large enough to control a werewolf. His friends nicknamed him \"Moony\" for his condition. When Severus Snape became curious about where Lupin disappeared to each month, Black played a prank on him in their sixth year (although Sirius, James and Peter hated Snape, Lupin claimed he had no reason to hate him until their sixth year). Sirius told Snape where Lupin went every month, although he neglected to mention he was a werewolf and knew Snape could be killed if he approached Lupin in his transformed state. Snape, determined to get them in trouble, followed Sirius' directions. When James learned what Sirius did, he stopped Snape before he reached the Shrieking Shack, saving his life. Snape, however, had seen Lupin in werewolf form and was sworn to secrecy by Dumbledore. Snape never forgave Sirius and believed James' only motive in foiling the plan was to avoid expulsion from Hogwarts.\n\n\nIn his fifth year, Lupin was made a prefect, although he had trouble disciplining James and Sirius. He did not become Head Boy, however. In an interview, J. K. Rowling linked this to Lupin's desire to be liked, \"because he's been disliked so often.\" Lupin's main failing is, \"he's always so pleased to have friends, so he cuts them an awful lot of slack.\"[3] In *Order of the Phoenix*, Sirius said Lupin was the \"good boy,\" and Rowling says he was the \"mature\" one. According to Sirius, Lupin did not participate in his and James' bullying (of Snape, in particular), but Lupin regrets never having told them to stop. He is also one of the co-creators of the Marauder's Map, which later falls into Harry Potter's ownership.\n\n\nLupin loathes and fears his monthly transformations: when he faces boggarts, they take the form of a globular full moon. These transformations became less severe in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, when the Wolfsbane Potion provided by Snape allowed him to have some control over them, and to retain his mind. It is shown that Lupin wears brown colored New & Lingwood brand shoes in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* when packing.\n\n\nLupin was a member of the original Order of the Phoenix.\n\n\n\n## Appearances[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*[edit]\n\n\nProfessor Lupin first appeared in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, in which he taught Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is first seen on the Hogwarts Express, asleep, and \"looked as if one good curse would be able to finish him off\". However, when Dementors appeared in the train, Lupin finally wakes up \"holding what seemed to be a handful of flames\". There is evidence to suggest that Lupin is a more powerful wizard than he lets on. While on the train during Prisoner of Azkaban, he summons fire without a wand (wandless magic being difficult to perform) and holds it in the palm of his bare hand. Later, in Order of the Phoenix, he is the only fighter besides Dumbledore who was not wounded, killed or knocked unconscious in the battle at the Department of Mysteries. This could be an indication of controlled wandless magic, something very few characters have been seen to do in the Harry Potter universe. At the end of the year, Severus Snape, furious over Sirius Black's escape and his resultant loss of the Order of Merlin promised to him by Cornelius Fudge, made public that Lupin was a werewolf, whereupon Lupin resigned in anticipation of the public outcry against a werewolf teaching at Hogwarts. During his tenure, he gave Harry private lessons in casting the Patronus Charm, the only known means of defence against Dementors. His students, excepting a few from Slytherin, held him in extremely high regard and loved his hands-on teaching style. Harry and his friends considered him to have been their best Defence teacher.\n\n\nUntil the climax of Prisoner of Azkaban, Lupin believed Sirius Black was guilty of murdering 12 Muggles, betraying Lily and James Potter, and killing Peter Pettigrew. He eventually discovered the truth — that Sirius was innocent, and the very much alive Peter was the traitor. He helped Sirius to explain the truth to Harry, Ron and Hermione in the Shrieking Shack, and they all confronted Peter, who had been disguised for the previous twelve years as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. However, Remus had forgotten to take the Wolfsbane potion, which prevented him from becoming violent while a werewolf. While Harry, Ron, and Hermione were distracted by Lupin, Peter assumed his Animagus form and escaped.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*[edit]\n\n\nLupin reappears as an Order of the Phoenix member in *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, but his role in the book is smaller than in *Prisoner of Azkaban*.\n\n\nIn *Prisoner of Azkaban*, Lupin is described as having \"light brown hair\" that is greying, and he wears shabby, patched clothing. In *Order of the Phoenix*, he has a pale face with premature lines. Because there are few employment opportunities for werewolves, as most in the wizarding world are prejudiced against them out of fear of the violent transformations, Lupin depends primarily on the kindness of others for support. When additional anti-werewolf laws are passed by the Ministry of Magic under Dolores Umbridge's direction in *Order of the Phoenix*, Lupin becomes nearly unemployable.\nLupin joins the newly reformed Order of the Phoenix in the fifth book and is part of the advance guard who escorts Harry from the Dursley family home in the book's opening chapters. Lupin lives in Grimmauld Place, the Order of the Phoenix headquarters with Sirius Black, but does not stay there often as he is usually sent on secret tasks for the Order. Later, he participates in the battle at the Department of Mysteries where he duels Lucius Malfoy. He came out unscathed while Lucius was bound by invisible ropes by Dumbledore.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*[edit]\n\n\nAs in *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, Lupin's role is small when compared to that in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*. In *Half-Blood Prince*, he is working undercover as a spy amongst his fellow werewolves, who are under the leadership of the werewolf Fenrir Greyback, who bit Lupin as a child, and joined forces with Voldemort. Remus admits to Harry that due to prejudice in the wizarding world, he has found the werewolves' siding with Voldemort hard to counter, as the Dark Lord offers them more freedom than they are currently allowed.\n\n\nAt the end of the book, it is revealed that Nymphadora Tonks has fallen in love with Remus (Remus is 13 years older than Tonks). He resisted becoming involved with her because of the risks from his being a werewolf, and he said he is, \"too old, too poor, and too dangerous,\" for her. However, the two are seen holding hands in one of the book's last scenes.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*[edit]\n\n\nLupin appears in *Deathly Hallows* as even more tired-looking and anxious than before. He takes part in the Order's retrieval of Harry from Privet Drive and just prior to their departure, Tonks reveals that she and Remus were married recently. However, on various occasions he does not appear to be happy but rather tense.\n\n\nFurther into the book, Remus stumbles upon the trio hiding at Grimmauld Place and offers his assistance to help complete whatever task Dumbledore assigned them. A heated argument between Harry and Lupin over his motives for wanting to join them results in the revelation that Tonks is now pregnant; he believes his marriage to Tonks has made her an outcast, believing even her own family is disgusted by their alliance, and the unborn child, to whom he feels guilty for potentially passing on his lycanthropy, would be better off without him. Hermione tries to assure him that a child could never think that of his father; but Harry, who lost his own father (and godfather) at such a young age, and also does not want to put Remus in danger, criticises him for abandoning his family, going so far as to call him a coward. Lupin attacks Harry with his wand, smashing him into a wall, and leaves in a rage. Inevitably, he recognizes the truth in Harry's words and returns to Tonks' side.\n\n\nLupin remains active in the Order of the Phoenix throughout the year, while their increasingly desperate situation drives members such as Aberforth Dumbledore to quit. Loyalists with the wizarding wireless hear him run the casualty reports section on the pirate radio station *Potterwatch* under the pseudonym of Romulus (a tribute to the twins Romulus and Remus who were raised by wolves). Late in the year, Tonks gives birth to a healthy baby boy named Teddy Remus Lupin, who demonstrates Metamorphmagus tendencies instead of lycanthropy. Harry was named his godfather.\n\n\nLupin commands a group of defenders on the school grounds during the Battle of Hogwarts and is last mentioned to be duelling Antonin Dolohov. Both Lupin and Tonks die in combat, killed by Dolohov and Bellatrix Lestrange, respectively,[4] leaving Teddy an orphan with Harry Potter as his godfather and Andromeda Tonks as his guardian. JK Rowling has since stated that she originally intended for both Lupin and Tonks to survive.[5]\n\n\nWhen Harry uses the Resurrection Stone, a younger-looking Lupin, along with Sirius, James, and Lily accompany Harry through the Forbidden Forest as he approaches Voldemort and an apparently imminent death. Harry apologizes to them all for their deaths, most especially to Lupin, for he would no longer have a chance to raise his son. Lupin tells Harry that he is sorry too, but also that his son will know what his father died for - a world in which his son would lead a happier life - and hopes that he will understand. The four spectres ward off Dementors as they travel through the forest, much like Patronuses, and are invisible to all but Harry. They disappear when Harry drops the Resurrection Stone as he goes to face the Dark Lord.\n\n\nRowling stated in an interview that Lupin and Tonks died to compensate for the last-minute reprieve she gave to Arthur Weasley when he survived a would-have-been fatal attack in *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*.[6]\nRowling also stated that it was Antonin Dolohov who killed him.[7]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nActor David Thewlis was *Prisoner of Azkaban* director Alfonso Cuaron's first choice to play the role of Lupin. Thewlis had earlier auditioned for the role of Professor Quirrell in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* but lost out to Ian Hart, who in turn encouraged Thewlis to take the role of Lupin.[8] Thewlis appears as Lupin in *Prisoner of Azkaban*, *Order of the Phoenix*, *The Half-Blood Prince*, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1*, and finally in *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2*. A teenaged version of Lupin briefly appears in *Order of the Phoenix* played by James Utechin during Snape's memories.\n\n\n\n### Name etymology[edit]\n\n\nThis character's name is a clear example of Rowling's use of descriptive names for her characters, settings and other story elements. His first name, \"Remus,\" is an allusion to Romulus and Remus,[9] the legendary twin founders of Rome, who as infants were cared for by a she-wolf. Lupin borrows the name of the other twin, \"Romulus,\" as a nom de guerre in Book 7.\n\n\nHis last name, \"Lupin,\" recalls the English word \"lupine\" (meaning \"characteristic of or relating to wolves\"), which in turn is derived from Latin *lupus* (\"wolf\"). In the folklore of northern France, *lupin* is also the term used to refer to a type of werewolf, noted for its shyness (in contrast to the more aggressive and violent *loup-garou*). \"Lupin\" is also the name of a genus of flowering plant.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nThe fact that he's a werewolf and needs to take a potion to avoid hurting people for the rest of his life makes him a symbol of the consequences of prejudice and segregation, as well as society's often negative reaction to the ill and the disabled.[10] Lupin is often listed as one of the best characters in the *Harry Potter* lore. IGN ranked Lupin as the 14th best character in the franchise stating, \"An old friend of Harry's parents, he was able to give Harry personal, intimate insight into who they were that no one else had been able to provide.\"[11] The character's death during the Battle of Hogwarts during *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* is often regarded as one of the most emotional deaths of the series. Author J.K. Rowling has apologised for killing the character in the years following.[12][13][14]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Interview: David Thewlis\". *Moviehole*. 2004-06-09.

K. Rowling. She evolved from an unnamed periphery character in *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* into a major antagonist in subsequent novels. In the final installment of the story, Rowling established her as Lord Voldemort's \"last, best lieutenant\". Bellatrix was the first female Death Eater introduced in the books. Bellatrix had a fanatic obsession with the Dark Lord although she was clearly fearful of his magical abilities and absolute power over his forces. She is almost as sadistic and homicidal as Lord Voldemort, with a psychotic personality.\n\n\nShe is portrayed by Helena Bonham Carter in the last four *Harry Potter* films, from *Order of the Phoenix* (2007) to *Deathly Hallows – Part 2* (2011).[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nHer given name derives from Latin as the feminine form of the noun \"warrior\". Like many members of the Black family, Bellatrix is named after a celestial body or astronomic structure, in this case one of the brightest stars in the constellation Orion.\n\n\nBellatrix's name has been translated into other languages in a variety of ways. Many of the changes accentuate the evil nature of her character, such as the Dutch \"Bellatrix van Detta\".\n\n\n\n## Character background[edit]\n\n\nBellatrix Black was born to Cygnus and Druella (Rosier) Black in 1951.\n\n\nBellatrix is related by blood and marriage to many characters in the novels (although in the fifth book it is specified that all pure-blood families are related to each other): she has two younger sisters, Narcissa and Andromeda, and is first cousin to Sirius. She married Rodolphus Lestrange after leaving Hogwarts \"because it was expected of her\" to marry a pure-blood. However, Rowling stated in an interview that Bellatrix truly loved Voldemort.[2] Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, and was subsequently disowned by the Blacks, whereas Narcissa, conversely, married Lucius Malfoy, heir of a wealthy pure-blood family; thus, Bellatrix is the aunt of both Nymphadora Tonks and Draco Malfoy.\n\n\nAt Hogwarts, she, along with her sisters, was sorted into Slytherin. It is suggested in the novels that, as a student, Bellatrix associated with a group of students – including Rodolphus Lestrange, Severus Snape, Avery, Evan Rosier and Wilkes – who nearly all became Death Eaters. It is assumed Bellatrix was at least initially drawn to Lord Voldemort because they both believe in an ideology that favors pure-blood wizards and witches over other members of the community. This elitism, shared by the Malfoy and Lestrange clans, was instilled in Bellatrix since childhood. The Black family motto, *toujours pur* (French for \"always pure\"), reflects this steadfast belief in blood purity. Bellatrix, her husband, and her brother-in-law, were active Death Eaters during Voldemort's rise to power, and evaded capture and suspicion until after the Dark Lord's downfall.\n\n\n\n## Appearances[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*[edit]\n\n\nIn this book, Rowling used Albus Dumbledore's Pensieve as a plot device to reveal that Bellatrix, rather than deserting her leader like many other Death Eaters, was part of the group of dark wizards – along with Rodolphus, Rabastan, and Barty Crouch Jr – that tortured well-known aurors Frank and Alice Longbottom in an attempt to gain information about Voldemort's location.[3] For using the Unforgivable Cruciatus Curse to torture the Longbottoms until they went insane, Bellatrix and her three associates were sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban. At her trial, Bellatrix proudly and defiantly proclaimed that Voldemort would rise again.[4] Later in that book, during his rebirthing ritual, Voldemort stated that the Lestranges were amongst the most faithful members of his inner circle.[5]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*[edit]\n\n\nThirteen years after Voldemort's fall, Bellatrix was one of the many Death Eaters who escaped Azkaban and rejoined him. After escaping from prison, she was present at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in the climax of the book, in which a group of Death Eaters attempted to steal Sybill Trelawney's prophecy pertaining to Voldemort's downfall. Rowling let Bellatrix prove her magical prowess during the mission when she overpowered her niece Tonks and Kingsley Shacklebolt in one-on-one duels, killed her cousin Sirius by blasting him through the veil in the Death Chamber, and deflected one of Dumbledore's spells as she made her escape. Harry attempted to use the Cruciatus Curse on her in revenge for killing Sirius, but the curse was ineffective due to the lack of real cruelty behind it.[6] Before she could do any more, Bellatrix was joined by her master, who ignored her warning that Dumbledore was in the building. Bellatrix was subdued by Dumbledore in the Ministry of Magic's Atrium while he duelled Voldemort. Voldemort interceded on Bellatrix's behalf, grabbing her and taking her with him as he Disapparated, though not before being glimpsed by Ministry officials.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*[edit]\n\n\nAt the beginning of *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, Bellatrix attempts to keep Narcissa from confiding Draco's secret mission to Snape at Spinner's End. Rowling used the conversation between Snape and Bellatrix to imply that Voldemort is still furious at Bellatrix's failure in the previous book.[7] That conversation also suggests that Bellatrix mistrusts Snape not only because of his low birth, but also for many valid questions about his loyalty to the Dark Lord. Snape surprises Bellatrix by replying to each of her arguments and by agreeing to create an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa to assist Draco in his mission to kill Dumbledore. Later in the book, it is mentioned by Snape that Bellatrix had been teaching Occlumency to Draco, in an effort to aid him with his mission. In the film, she and Fenrir Greyback arrive at the Burrow, the Weasleys' home, and burn it down. Ginny Weasley and Harry chase after them, with Bellatrix taunting them over her murder of Sirius.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*[edit]\n\n\nThe first chapter of *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* implies that Voldemort is still angry with Bellatrix, as evidenced when he makes fun of the fact that her niece Tonks married werewolf Remus Lupin.[8] However, Voldemort gives Bellatrix a chance to \"prune\" her family tree during the Death Eaters' attempt to capture Harry as the boy departs from the Dursleys' home, during which Bellatrix unsuccessfully tries to kill Tonks.[9] In this book, Rowling reveals that Bellatrix is the guardian of Helga Hufflepuff's cup (though she is unaware that it is a Horcrux), which Voldemort has entrusted the Lestranges to keep in their Gringotts vault. Bellatrix and the Malfoys detain Harry, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger at Malfoy Manor, and Hermione is tortured by Bellatrix when she suspects the trio has broken into her vault, but Dobby appears and saves the prisoners, though not before being hit by a knife thrown by Bellatrix as they disapparate to safety. Later in the book, Harry, Ron, and Hermione use a stray hair of Bellatrix's to disguise Hermione as Bellatrix using Polyjuice Potion, in order to gain access to the Lestrange's Gringotts vault. Though Voldemort apparently punishes Bellatrix and the Malfoys severely for interrupting his Elder Wand side quest only to have Potter escape and steal the cup, she nevertheless fights for her master in the Battle of Hogwarts towards the end of the novel. When the battle resumes inside the Great Hall after Harry's supposed death, Bellatrix simultaneously duels with Hermione, Ginny, and Luna Lovegood, none of whom is a match for Bellatrix, who nearly hits Ginny with a Killing Curse. An enraged Molly Weasley engages Bellatrix in a duel and fires a curse that hits Bellatrix right over the heart, killing her.[10] Rowling revealed that, though there was speculation that Neville would kill Bellatrix, she had always intended Molly to do so because the author wanted to match Bellatrix's obsessive love with Molly's maternal love.[11]\n\n\n\n## Appearances in other media[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*[edit]\n\n\nIn this play, which takes place over 19 years after *The Deathly Hallows*, it is revealed that Bellatrix is the mother of the story's antagonist Delphini, whom she had with Lord Voldemort during their stay at Malfoy Manor prior to the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nActress Helen McCrory was originally cast as Bellatrix in *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* but dropped out due to pregnancy and was replaced with Helena Bonham Carter.[12][13][14] Coincidentally, McCrory was later cast as Bellatrix's sister Narcissa in *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, during the filming of which Bonham Carter learned that she was pregnant. McCrory was also cast as Narcissa after Naomi Watts was unavailable for the role.[15][16][17][18][19][20] Elizabeth Hurley was also reportedly linked to the role of Bellatrix at one point.[21][22][23] While filming the scene in the Department of Mysteries in *Order of the Phoenix*, Bonham Carter accidentally perforated the eardrum of Matthew Lewis, the actor who portrayed Neville Longbottom, with her wand during one of the outtakes, when she became a bit too enthusiastic in her portrayal.[24]\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Harry Potter* family tree\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |

K. Rowling's *Harry Potter* series. Professor McGonagall is a professor at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, the head of Gryffindor House, the professor of Transfiguration, the Deputy Headmistress under Albus Dumbledore and a member of the Order of the Phoenix. Following Lord Voldemort's defeat at the hands of her student Harry Potter and the deaths of Headmasters Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape, McGonagall takes the position of Headmistress. McGonagall was originally portrayed in the film adaptations by actress Maggie Smith, and later by Fiona Glascott in the *Fantastic Beasts* prequel films *The Crimes of Grindelwald* and *The Secrets of Dumbledore*.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Fictional character biography[edit]\n\n\n### Education and employment at Hogwarts[edit]\n\n\nMinerva McGonagall was born on 4 October in Scotland to Robert McGonagall and Isobel Ross. McGonagall was born a half-blood witch as her father was a Muggle and her mother a witch. McGonagall began her Hogwarts education at the age of eleven and was sorted into Gryffindor after being the longest ever Hatstall between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. McGonagall became friends with Hufflepuff student and future colleague Pomona Sprout and gained a particular talent in the art of Transfiguration under the tutelage of then Transfiguration professor Albus Dumbledore. During this time, McGonagall managed to become an Animagus, taking the form of a tabby cat and filed her paperwork to be officially registered. McGonagall was also a skilled member of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. After graduation, McGonagall became an employee for the Ministry of Magic in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement where she met her husband, Elphinstone Urquart. McGonagall was offered a promotion but turned it down and applied to teach Transfiguration at Hogwarts under Dumbledore. During her employment at Hogwarts, McGonagall grew particularly close to Dumbledore and the two were near inseparable friends and colleagues, and he began to recognise her as one of his most trusted friends. Eventually, McGonagall became the Head of the Transfiguration Department as well as the Head of Gryffindor House. After Headmaster Armando Dippet's retirement and Dumbledore's appointment as Headmaster, McGonagall became his Deputy Headmistress. Despite being a crucial force during the First Wizarding War against Lord Voldemort, McGonagall was not a member of the initial forming of the Order of the Phoenix. During the war, McGonagall lost her brother, Robert Jr, and two of her favourite students, James and Lily Potter. Following the death of the Potters and the first downfall of Voldemort, McGonagall accompanied Dumbledore and Rubeus Hagrid in delivering the sole survivor of the encounter, Harry Potter, to his aunt and uncle Petunia and Vernon Dursley in Surrey. Despite McGonagall's reservations that the Dursleys were the \"worst kind of Muggles\", she understood that due to the framing and imprisonment of Harry's godfather Sirius Black, the Dursleys were the only family the infant had left. After the war, McGonagall and Elphinstone married, but three years later he died from a Venomous Tentacula bite, making Minerva a widow.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n###  *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*[edit]\n\n\nIn 1991, Dumbledore revealed to his closest colleagues and allies that he would be keeping the philosopher's stone that was keeping Nicholas Flamel alive at Hogwarts, and tasked each of his colleagues to devise protection for the stone. McGonagall's protection was a life-sized enchanted game of Wizard's Chess. That year, Harry Potter began his first year of education at Hogwarts and was sorted into Gryffindor, placing him in the care of McGonagall. After noticing Potter's flying skills whilst retrieving Neville Longbottom's Remembrall from Draco Malfoy, McGonagall quickly introduced Potter to Quidditch captain Oliver Wood, claiming to have found the new Seeker for the team. Harry made the Quidditch team, becoming the youngest Seeker in history. To ensure Potter had his broom, McGonagall bought Harry a Nimbus 2000 broomstick, which was the fastest broom at the time. During the Halloween feast, Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Quirinus Quirrell interrupted warning everyone of a mountain troll in the dungeon. Dumbledore ordered the students to return to their dormitories whilst he and the teachers headed toward the dungeons. The troll was not in the dungeon, but the teachers noticed a racket from the upper floor. They arrived upon the scene where the girls' lavatories had been wrecked and the troll defeated by Harry and Ron Weasley while saving their friend Hermione Granger. Hermione took the blame for her friends claiming that she had gone looking for the troll but would have been killed if it weren't for Harry and Ron. McGonagall took five points away from Hermione but gave five points each to Harry and Ron for \"sheer dumb luck\". Later on in the year, McGonagall caught Draco Malfoy roaming the castle after hours. Malfoy claimed to have seen Harry at Hagrid's with an illegal baby dragon. Meanwhile, Hermione and Neville were caught by the groundskeeper Argus Filch and all of them were sentenced to detention. Towards the end of the year, it was revealed that Professor Quirrell was attached to Lord Voldemort and was the one attempting to steal the philosopher's stone, but was stopped by Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Due to the trio's bravery as well as Neville Longbottom's courage in attempting to stand up to them for breaking the rules, Gryffindor eventually won the House Cup that year.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*[edit]\n\n\nThe following school year began with McGonagall having to deal with Harry and Ron crashing Arthur Weasley's flying Ford Anglia into the Whomping Willow after they were unable to access Platform 9 3/4 and missed the Hogwarts Express, and nearly exposing the wizarding world to the Muggle populace. McGonagall was fairer than Slytherin Head and Potions master Severus Snape in punishing Harry and Ron, and instead assigned them to a detention rather than expelling them. Later that year, it was revealed that the Chamber of Secrets had been opened, which led to the petrifications of two of her students in her house, Hermione Granger and Colin Creevey, as both were Muggle-born. Towards the end of the year McGonagall was forced to act as temporary Headmistress after the Ministry of Magic suspended Dumbledore. Finally, she discovered another note from the Heir of Slytherin which stated that he had taken Ginny Weasley into the Chamber. McGonagall believed that this would be the end of Hogwarts, and forced the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Gilderoy Lockhart to find the Chamber of Secrets and rescue Ginny, pointing out all of Lockhart's supposed heroic acts. Ginny was saved by Harry and Ron after they descended into the Chamber of Secrets (which was located in a cavern under one of the girls' lavatories). Harry defeated the Basilisk with help from Dumbledore's pet phoenix, Fawkes, who delivered Harry the Sword of Godric Gryffindor. During this encounter, Harry unknowingly destroyed the first of Voldemort's Horcruxes by destroying Tom Riddle's diary with a Basilisk's fang. With the monster defeated and the Chamber of Secrets closed, Dumbledore was reinstated and assigned McGonagall to prepare a celebratory feast.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*[edit]\n\n\nAt the beginning of this school year, McGonagall assigned Hermione a Time-Turner to allow her to take multiple classes at the same time. After Azkaban escapee Sirius Black infiltrated the Castle, he was able to enter the Gryffindor common room. Black was apparently able to get in due to a list of passwords written down by Neville due to his constant forgetfulness. After a Dementor attack that caused Harry's Nimbus 2000 to be destroyed, Harry was sent a Firebolt. However, McGonagall confiscated it assuming it was sent by Sirius and cursed. However, the broomstick was returned to Harry after being declared safe. That year McGonagall watched as her house won their first Quidditch Cup in years, which resulted in McGonagall openly crying tears of joy.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*[edit]\n\n\nDuring this school year, it was announced that Hogwarts would be hosting the Triwizard Tournament as well as providing accommodation for the wizarding schools Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Harry was chosen as a Triwizard Champion despite being underage and underequipped. McGonagall worried for the safety of her student and pleaded with Dumbledore and Ministry representative Barty Crouch Sr to remove Harry from the tournament to no avail. McGonagall would lend her classroom to Harry, Ron and Hermione to practice for the third and final task of the championship. After the end of the championship and the death of Cedric Diggory, McGonagall accompanied Dumbledore and Snape rescuing Harry from Death Eater Barty Crouch Jr, who had been masquerading as new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody as a part of the plan to resurrect Lord Voldemort. It was revealed that Crouch had placed Harry's name into the Goblet of Fire and bewitched it to force Harry into participation in the tournament. Due to this, Crouch was able to transform the Triwizard Cup into a Portkey to transport Harry to the graveyard in Little Hangleton where his blood could be used to resurrect Voldemort. McGonagall was instructed to guard Crouch, but was unable to prevent the Dementor sent by Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge to kill Crouch in an attempt to stop mass hysteria over the return of Lord Voldemort. The Ministry began a smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore and silenced any rumours that the Dark Lord had returned and downplayed the death of Cedric Diggory as a result.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*[edit]\n\n\nDue to Voldemort's return, McGonagall finally joined the re-formed Order of the Phoenix alongside colleagues Dumbledore, Snape and Hagrid, as well as former colleagues Remus Lupin and Alastor Moody. Upon returning to Hogwarts, McGonagall was faced with the challenges of Ministry-appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge. McGonagall was unafraid to show her disgust and hatred of Umbridge and her methods. Umbridge began to take control over the school, and appointed herself as \"High Inquisitor\". McGonagall was supportive of Harry, Ron and Hermione's formation of Dumbledore's Army in an attempt to teach the students how to defend themselves, considering Umbridge's refusal to do so. Due to Dumbledore's absence, Umbridge appointed herself as Headmistress rather than McGonagall. While Umbridge invaded the career advising sessions, McGonagall finally lost her temper at Umbridge after she kept interrupting Harry stating that he will never be an Auror for the Ministry of Magic. McGonagall pulled Harry aside and told him that she will assist Harry in achieving his goal of becoming an Auror even if it was the last thing she ever did.[2] Whilst attempting to protect Hagrid from being sacked by Umbridge, McGonagall was attacked by Umbridge's Aurors and was sent to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. McGonagall was unable to return to Hogwarts until after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, where Voldemort's return was revealed to the world. McGonagall awarded fifty points each to all six students present at the battle, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny and Ravenclaw student Luna Lovegood for alerting the world of Voldemort's return. McGonagall was present when Umbridge was forcibly removed from Hogwarts grounds, stating that she would have joined Peeves the poltergeist in chasing Umbridge off if her injuries had not prevented her from doing so.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*[edit]\n\n\nMcGonagall was one of the first people Harry, Ron and Hermione turned to after Katie Bell was cursed. McGonagall called upon Snape and Filch to investigate the necklace she touched that caused her to be cursed. Snape stopped the curse from spreading and Harry professed his theory that Draco Malfoy was responsible. However, his theory was dismissed. Later in the year, McGonagall duelled with Death Eater Alecto Carrow during the Battle in the Astronomy Tower and later learned of Snape's murder of Dumbledore. McGonagall was initially appointed as Headmistress, but was demoted after Voldemort took control of the school and placed Snape as Headmaster.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*[edit]\n\n\nDespite the school being overrun by Death Eaters, McGonagall remained at Hogwarts to ensure little harm came to the students. Later during the year, McGonagall was present when Harry, Ron and Hermione returned to Hogwarts searching for Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem. She found Amycus Carrow attempting to break into Ravenclaw Tower, claiming his sister Alecto was inside. McGonagall opened the common room and found Alecto unconscious. Amycus revealed that he had been warned Harry would try to break into Ravenclaw Tower and admitted he would project the blame onto the students in the dormitories. When McGonagall refused and Amycus spat in her face, Harry angrily revealed himself and incapacitated the siblings with help from Luna. McGonagall then defeated Severus Snape and banished him from Hogwarts and began to defend the school. She tasked Neville and Seamus to destroy the wooden bridge to prevent Snatchers from sneaking into the school. McGonagall helped evacuate the younger students to Hogsmeade and ordered Pansy Parkinson and all those in favour of giving Harry over to Voldemort in exchange for their lives to leave. She was present to watch Harry defeat Voldemort once and for all and was one of the first people, aside from Ron, Hermione and Ginny, to congratulate him.\n\n\n\n#### Epilogue[edit]\n\n\nAfter the war ended, McGonagall was fully instated as the Headmistress of Hogwarts and was awarded the Order of Merlin, First Class by new Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt. McGonagall eventually hired Neville as the new Herbology professor due to his gifts in the subject, and elected him as the new Head of Gryffindor House. McGonagall later learned that Snape was secretly Harry's protector and had killed Dumbledore at Dumbledore’s request. McGonagall then made a controversial decision to add Snape's portrait in the Headmaster's Office as a testament to his bravery.[3]\n\n\n\n## Characterisation and abilities[edit]\n\n\nMcGonagall is considered to be a formidable witch who is skilled in many forms of magic, notably transfiguration and spell-casting. She is able to perform certain magic without casting spells or sometimes without the use of a wand. McGonagall is a registered Animagus and can transform herself into a tabby cat at will. McGonagall was always held in high respect by her peers and students at Hogwarts and commanded a position second only to Dumbledore. She was notable for her sternness and dry sense of humour. Furthermore, Minerva McGonagall was inspired by the Roman goddess Minerva, or Athena in Greek mythology. Minerva was the goddess of wisdom and war (particularly in defensive war). During the series, Professor McGonagall displays many traits similar to the Roman goddess. For example, in *The Deathly Hallows – Part II*, McGonagall directs and orders vital defensive tactics before the penultimate battle against Voldemort.[4]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nIGN ranked McGonagall as the 18th-best character in the franchise stating, \"As the head of Gryffindor house and Deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts, Professor McGonagall can be a strict disciplinarian. She is quick to kick misbehaving students out of her class, and deduct house points when the situation warrants. But she can also be kind of like that cool aunt of yours – the one who sometimes lets you get away with a bit of mischief. And that's what's so endearing about McGonagall.\"[5]\n\n\nWatchMojo ranked McGonagall as their ninth-best character, stating, \"Professor of Transfiguration at Hogwarts, Gryffindor head of house and member of the Order of the Phoenix, Professor McGonagall is an austere, imposing woman with a strict sense of responsibility. She keeps her students in line with the threat of detention, but also has a softer side on rare occasions – and not just when she transforms herself into a cat. When push comes to shove, Minerva McGonagall is a formidable witch with powerful magical abilities, even facing Voldemort himself at the Battle of Hogwarts.\"[6] Maggie Smith also received much praise for her interpretation of the character, with author J.K. Rowling stating that she had always pictured the actress in the role of McGonagall.[7] Despite this, Smith stated that she didn't feel wholly comfortable while making the films and that \"it didn't really feel like acting\", but has said that she enjoyed being a part of the franchise as it gives her something to bond with her grandchildren over.[8][9] In 2007, Smith was diagnosed with breast cancer and struggled during the filming of *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, but made a full recovery in 2009.[10] McGonagall's inclusion in *Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald* was controversial for some fans of the series, as the character had been believed not to be born yet and was shown in the film teaching at Hogwarts.[11][12][13][14]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"10 Facts About Minerva McGonagall Left Out Of The Movies\". *ScreenRant*. 2019-08-19.

Rowling. Umbridge is the secondary antagonist of the fifth novel, *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,* where she has been stationed at Hogwarts by the Ministry of Magic to take power away from Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore, who have both been informing the Wizarding World of Lord Voldemort's return.\n\n\nDuring her time at Hogwarts, Umbridge grows in power and is appointed High Inquisitor by the Minister for Magic in an attempt to control the school. Despite being assigned as the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Umbridge refuses to teach anything practical in the subject, which leads to the formation of Dumbledore's Army as a way for the students to learn how to defend themselves. Umbridge is physically described in the narrative as a fat, toad-like woman with a wide slack mouth and a large bow that is often in her hair.\n\n\nCritics have recognised Umbridge as one of the most hated, as well as the most compelling, villains in the series. Umbridge was portrayed by Imelda Staunton in *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* and *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1*.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Fictional character biography[edit]\n\n\nDolores Jane Umbridge was born to a Wizard father and a Muggle mother, and eventually had a younger brother who was a Squib. Under the influence of her father, Dolores grew up despising her mother and brother for their lack of magical abilities. She was sorted into Slytherin House [*citation needed*] at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and hated her time at the school due to never being given any positions of power.\n\n\nAfter her time at Hogwarts, Umbridge rose to prominent and influential positions in the Ministry of Magic in the Improper Use of Magic Office. After a while, Umbridge became the Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge. Umbridge used this position of power to satisfy her hatred of part-humans, for example through new Anti-Werewolf Legislation which made it nearly impossible for Remus Lupin to find a new job after resigning his post as Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts in 1994.\n\n\nAfter rumours of Lord Voldemort's return and the increased paranoia of Cornelius Fudge, Umbridge set two dementors on Harry Potter and his cousin Dudley Dursley in Little Whinging in an attempt to get him expelled from Hogwarts for use of magic outside of school. During Harry's trial, Umbridge tried to intimidate him to undermine his defence: that he had used the Patronus Charm only because the dementors were about to permanently incapacitate him and Dudley. In the end, Umbridge, Fudge and a few other members of the court voted for conviction, but Harry was cleared of the charges.\n\n\n\n### Reign over Hogwarts[edit]\n\n\nAfter the trial, the Ministry of Magic appointed Umbridge as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts to allow the Ministry to monitor the activities within Hogwarts, and particularly the Headmaster Albus Dumbledore. Fudge had an irrational belief that Dumbledore was attempting to overthrow his position as Minister and was using the students to do so. As a result, Umbridge refused to teach any sort of martial magic and saw her return to the school as an opportunity to gain power over the people who had refused to give her any positions of responsibility during her schooling.[4]\n\n\nUmbridge made a negative impression on the students of Hogwarts at the Start-of-Term Feast, where she rudely interrupted Dumbledore and talked to the students in a condescending manner. She began interfering with the students learning at Hogwarts by refusing to teach any practical applications despite her post as Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Due to the apparent return of Voldemort that was being silenced by the Ministry, students such as Harry, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger and Dean Thomas began openly opposing to Umbridge's insistence on theoretical applications. Harry's constant objections in Umbridge's class due to his being present at Voldemort's return and witnessing the murder of Cedric Diggory led him to a detention with Umbridge. She forced him to write \"I must not tell lies\" with a cursed quill that scarred the phrase into his hand permanently.\n\n\nUmbridge was appointed as Hogwarts \"High Inquisitor\" by the Ministry[5](p 306) to evaluate, harass or fire any teacher deemed unsatisfactory by her. This found her often at odds with Transfiguration professor and Head of Gryffindor House Minerva McGonagall. Umbridge abolished all student groups, which included the House Quidditch teams. Eventually Harry, Ron and Hermione formed Dumbledore's Army as a way to teach students how to use defensive spells in a practical format. The group was a secret organisation that would meet in the Room of Requirement, a hidden room in Hogwarts.\n\n\nAfter Harry gave an interview with *The Quibbler* where he discussed Voldemort's return, Umbridge banned the magazine from Hogwarts. She also restricted Harry's privileges.\n\n\nUmbridge sacked Divination Professor Sybill Trelawney, but was unsuccessful in evicting her from the castle due to Dumbledore's intervention. Dumbledore then purposely appointed centaur Firenze as the new Divination Professor, being aware of Umbridge's contempt for non-human magical beings.\n\n\nDumbledore's Army was eventually betrayed by Ravenclaw student Marietta Edgecombe. She was threatened by Umbridge that if she didn't turn them over, her mother would lose her job at the Ministry. Umbridge attempted to have Harry expelled from Hogwarts, but Dumbledore took the blame for the group's formation and disappeared from Hogwarts to avoid arrest.\n\n\nUmbridge was appointed as the new Headmistress of Hogwarts by Fudge.[4][5](p 624) She formed the Inquisitorial Squad, composed entirely of Slytherin students such as Draco Malfoy. Despite Dumbledore's Army being banned, the rebellion against Umbridge continued, mainly expressed by the ongoing pranks of Fred and George Weasley. Before Umbridge could catch the twins, they fled Hogwarts on their broomsticks after encouraging the castle's poltergeist Peeves to continue tormenting Umbridge in their absence. The castle itself seemed to recognise that Umbridge was not the true Headmistress, as it denied her access to the Headmaster's Office.\n\n\nAfter Umbridge sacked Care of Magical Creatures professor Rubeus Hagrid due to his half-breed status, Professor McGonagall attempted to intervene, which resulted in Umbridge and a squad of aurors attacking her so severely she was hospitalised at St. Mungo's. She also intercepted all manner of communications to prevent Harry from contacting his godfather Sirius Black and the Order of the Phoenix, even going so far as to injure Harry's pet owl Hedwig.\n\n\nShe eventually caught Harry attempting to use the Floo Network in her office to contact Sirius. This resulted in Dumbledore's Army members Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood being rounded up by the Inquisitorial Squad and held in her office. When Harry refused to give Umbridge any information, she called Potions Master Severus Snape to provide her with the truth-telling potion Veritaserum, but Snape informed her that she had squandered his entire stock interrogating students. Umbridge then believed that the illegal Cruciatus Curse would cause Harry to loosen his tongue. Hermione attempted to protest, but Umbridge brushed her off and revealed that she had ordered the dementor attack on Harry and Dudley during the summer.\n\n\nHermione tricked Umbridge into following Harry and herself into the Forbidden Forest to search for Dumbledore's alleged \"secret weapon\". Umbridge was confronted by a herd of centaurs, whom she insulted with racial slurs. She then attacked a centaur. As a result, Umbridge was carried off and nearly killed by the herd.[5](pp 755–756) She was saved by Dumbledore, who managed to calm the herd due to their respect for him and brought her out without a scratch but in a severe state of shock.[5](p 848)\n\n\nAfter Voldemort was sighted in the Ministry of Magic by numerous people including Fudge, Dumbledore was reinstated as Headmaster at Hogwarts, and Umbridge was sacked. She attempted to sneak out of the school but encountered Peeves, who chased her out of the school with McGonagall's cane to the delight of students and teachers alike.\n\n\n\n### Return to the Ministry of Magic[edit]\n\n\nAfter her dismissal from Hogwarts, Umbridge returned to the Ministry as the Senior Undersecretary to the new Minister, Rufus Scrimgeour. She purposely chose to continue to torment Harry by informing the Minister of Harry's wish to become an auror. Harry refused to trust Scrimgeour or the Ministry of Magic due to the fact that Umbridge was never sacked or arrested for her actions.[4]\n\n\nUmbridge was later seen at Dumbledore's funeral, attempting to look appropriately somber. She was startled by the appearance of Firenze, clearly having been traumatised by her encounter with the centaurs.\n\n\nAfter Voldemort's takeover of the Ministry of Magic, Umbridge oversaw the registration and persecution of Muggle-born witches and wizards, sometimes referred to as mudbloods, under the Muggle-Born Registration Commission. In her position, Umbridge conducted biased trials that subjected Muggle-born witches and wizards to dementors and have them sent to Azkaban prison for \"stealing magic from real witches and wizards\". Following Alastor Moody's murder, Umbridge somehow obtained possession of his magical prosthetic eye and had it affixed into the door to her office as a way of terrorising Ministry employees and reminding them she was observing them at all times.\n\n\nAt some point, Umbridge received a locket as a bribe from thief Mundungus Fletcher. The pendant was actually Salazar Slytherin's locket and was, unbeknownst to her, one of Voldemort's Horcruxes. Due to Umbridge's twisted nature, the Horcrux actually amplified her magical abilities.\n\n\nDuring one of her kangaroo court trials, she accused Mary Cattermole of having stolen her wand and alleged she wasn't a true witch. Full of rage, Harry appeared from under his Cloak of Invisibility and attacked Umbridge, allowing Harry and Hermione to take Slytherin's locket from her in order to destroy the Horcrux. Hermione left the fake locket behind with Umbridge to allay suspicion.\n\n\nAfter Voldemort's defeat by Harry at the Battle of Hogwarts and the restoration of the Ministry of Magic by the new Minister, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Umbridge was sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban for her crimes against Muggle-borns.[4]\n\n\n\n## Characterisation[edit]\n\n\nUmbridge is depicted in the novels as being an evil, cruel, authoritarian, bigoted and despicable woman who represented the worst of political power, under a saccharine image filled with kittens, fluff, and girlishness. She is implied to be sadistic and overwhelmingly corrupt, to the point of finding joy in torturing students. Harry describes Umbridge to Sirius Black, saying that she's vile enough to be a Death Eater, despite not being one.\n\n\nUmbridge is also depicted to be a prejudiced person, despising half-breeds and Muggle-born witches and wizards to the point of firing Hagrid due to his half-giant birth status. She displayed her intolerance to the centaur Firenze, shouting racial insults towards the herd of centaurs that confronted her in the Forbidden Forest. Umbridge was a \"pure-blood supremacist\" and attempted to mask her half-blood status, often lambasting her Muggle mother and Squib younger brother.\n\n\nDolores Umbridge was eventually imprisoned in Azkaban due to her crimes against Muggle-borns during her interrogations, as not everyone she interrogated and tortured survived.[6]\n\n\n\n## Reception and impact[edit]\n\n\nDolores Umbridge has been called one of the most despised fictional characters of all time due to her authoritarian stance and dictatorial presence, as well as her racist attitudes and torturing of children.[7] Charlotte Ahlin from *Bustle* stated while listing some of the most despised characters in literature:\n\n\n\n\n> Voldemort may have been the most evil character in the Harry Potter universe, but Dolores Umbridge was almost certainly the most hated. Unlike *Voldy*, she didn't represent an abstract form of authoritarian evil. She was that mean teacher you had in high school, that one mom on the PTA who thinks that rap music is destroying America ... Her brand of bigotry was just so relatable, and her nastiness got under every reader's skin.[7][8][9][10]\n> \n> \n\n\n*IGN* ranked Umbridge as the 17th best character in the franchise:\n\n\n> This is a woman who thinks the appropriate way to punish a student involves making him perform a ritual which, thanks to magic, causes him to bleed over and over again – one of many despicable acts. The fact that she spoke in a blatantly forced sing-song voice and wore gaudy pink clothing only added to her hideousness. ... as nasty as Umbridge is in the film, in the book, she's even worse.[11]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn a review of the *Order of the Phoenix* novel, author Stephen King hailed Umbridge as one of the best antagonists he has ever read:\n\n\n> The gently smiling Dolores Umbridge, with her girlish voice, toadlike face, and clutching, stubby fingers, is the greatest make-believe villain to come along since Hannibal Lecter. One needn’t be a child to remember The Really Scary Teacher, the one who terrified us so badly that we dreaded the walk to school in the morning, and we turn the pages partly in fervent hopes that she will get her comeuppance ... but also in growing fear of what she will get up to next. For surely a teacher capable of banning Harry Potter from playing Quidditch is capable of anything.[12][13]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Real-life comparisons and inspiration[edit]\n\n\nOccasionally, real-life public figures have been compared to Umbridge in a negative light due to their actions. Rival US Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were both compared to Umbridge during the 2016 United States presidential election.[14][15] Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher was an influence on the way the character was portrayed in the film adaptations, according to director David Yates and actress Imelda Staunton.[16] Rowling has stated that Umbridge is in fact based on a teacher of hers and was not directly inspired by Thatcher.[17][18][19]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Dolores Umbridge fact file\"\n2. **^** \"Imelda Staunton still scares people after Harry Potter role\". *list.co.uk*. 24 July 2020.

K. Rowling's *Harry Potter* series. He is one of the main characters in the fourth book, *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*, as he represents Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the Triwizard Tournament, alongside Harry Potter. Cedric is murdered by Peter Pettigrew on Lord Voldemort's orders during Voldemort's resurrection in Little Hangleton.[1]\n\n\nCedric's death becomes a point of trauma and guilt for Harry and continues to haunt him, which leads him to form Dumbledore's Army as a way to help teach his fellow students to protect themselves in battle. His death is also a focal point of the stage play *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*.\n\n\nCedric was portrayed by Robert Pattinson in the film adaptation of *Goblet of Fire* and was briefly portrayed by Joe Livermore in *Prisoner of Azkaban*.[2] His voice is acted by Blake Ritson in the *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* video game.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Fictional character biography[edit]\n\n\nCedric Diggory first begins attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1989 and is sorted into Hufflepuff. It is presumed that Cedric was familiar with Fred and George Weasley as they were in the same year level. Cedric is also close with Cho Chang and the two are romantically involved. Eventually Cedric becomes a popular student and is elected as Seeker for the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, with him then becoming the team captain and a prefect in the same year.\n\n\n\n### *Prisoner of Azkaban*[edit]\n\n\nCedric first faces Harry Potter during the Quidditch tournament in *Prisoner of Azkaban*, and ends up catching the Golden Snitch after Harry faints in the presence of Dementors. Cedric offers to replay the match but the offer is declined by Gryffindor captain Oliver Wood, who feels that Diggory had won the game.\n\n\n\n### *Goblet of Fire*[edit]\n\n\nThe next year, Cedric and his father, Amos, attend the Quidditch World Cup alongside Harry, Hermione Granger and the Weasley family. Upon arriving at Hogwarts for his sixth year, Cedric puts his name forth in the Goblet of Fire and is selected as the Hogwarts champion alongside Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons and Victor Krum from Durmstrang. Despite all three champions being chosen, the Goblet of Fire nominates Harry to become the fourth Triwizard Champion. Cedric remains kind to Harry whilst everyone else assumes Harry is lying when he asserts that he did not put his name in the Goblet of Fire.\n\n\nDespite having two champions from the school, the majority of Hogwarts students support Cedric, with students even creating enchanted badges that say \"Support Cedric Diggory, the Real Hogwarts Champion\". Cedric is opposed to the badges and tries to get his classmates not to wear them. In the first task, Harry gives Cedric a hand by informing him in advance that the task involves dragons. Cedric's dragon is a Swedish Short-Snout, from which he has to retrieve the Golden Egg it is guarding. Cedric achieves this by transfiguring a rock into a Labrador to distract the dragon whilst he retrieves the egg. The dragon is distracted by Cedric, but burns half of his face. After completing the task, Cedric is informed by Barty Crouch, Jr. (disguised as Alastor Moody via Polyjuice Potion) to place the egg underwater and listen to it.[*citation needed*] Cedric takes the egg to the Prefect's bathroom and figures out that the second task will involve the merpeople.\n\n\nAt the Yule Ball, Cedric attends with Ravenclaw's Seeker, Cho Chang, as his date. Towards the end of the night, Cedric informs Harry about placing the egg underwater as repayment for Harry warning him about the First Task. Knowing he will have to breathe underwater for one hour during the Second Task, Cedric applies the Bubble-Head Charm and retrieves Cho, his hostage, from the Black Lake. He quickly warns Harry about the time limit before finishing, as Harry is worried about Fleur's hostage as she has been eliminated. After both tasks are completed, Cedric and Harry are tied for first place in the Tournament standings.\n\n\nCedric's father travels to Hogwarts to be with his son for the third and final task in the tournament. Amos is displeased with Harry due to the media storm that has been covering him during the tournament, for which Cedric apologises for and defends Harry. Due to being tied at first place, Cedric and Harry enter the maze together, but eventually split up. After escaping a Blast-Ended Skrewt, Cedric is attacked by a bewitched Viktor Krum, who tries to use the Cruciatus Curse on Cedric per the direction of Crouch Jr., before being rescued by Harry before splitting up again. Cedric spots the Triwizard Cup and races towards it before being attacked by an acromantula. Harry and Cedric reunite again and defeat the Acromantula together, finding themselves at the Triwizard Cup. Cedric urges Harry to take the Cup as a favour for saving his life twice that evening; after realising that they've both helped each other, they agree to both take the Cup. The Cup turns out to have been enchanted by Crouch Jr. to act as a Portkey, which takes them to a graveyard in Little Hangleton.\n\n\nUpon their arrival in the graveyard, Cedric draws his wand, suspicious about their surroundings. Moments later, Peter Pettigrew emerges carrying a small being, which turns out to be Lord Voldemort. While Harry is suffering through searing pain through his scar due to the Horcrux in his body responding to Voldemort's presence, Voldemort orders Pettigrew to \"kill the spare\", prompting Pettigrew to use the Killing Curse on Cedric. During Harry's subsequent duel with Voldemort, their wands connect, and Cedric's ghost emerges from the wand along with the ghosts of Harry's parents. Before distracting Voldemort, Cedric asks Harry to take his body back to his parents. Harry breaks the connection and sprints over to Cedric's body, summoning the Cup to transport him and the body back to Hogwarts.\n\n\nDue to Cedric's death, the Leaving Feast on the last day of the school year is instead turned into a memorial service for him. Albus Dumbledore informs the students, against the wishes of the Ministry of Magic, that Cedric was murdered by Voldemort. In the following months, the Ministry of Magic, under the direction of Cornelius Fudge, orchestrate a smear campaign on Harry and Dumbledore in an attempt to silence panic at Voldemort's return and hush up Cedric's death. Cedric's death proves to be an inspiration for the students of Hogwarts, and eventually rebellion against the iron fist Dolores Umbridge imposes onto the school. This leads Harry, Ron and Hermione to form Dumbledore's Army for the students of Hogwarts, considering Umbridge is refusing to allow students to learn Defence Against the Dark Arts. Harry believes that students need to know how to defend themselves, due in large part to the return of Voldemort and the re-forming of the Death Eaters, so that no other student meets the same fate as Cedric. Harry continues to honour Cedric's memory through Dumbledore's Army and by keeping one of the \"Support Cedric Diggory\" badges.\n\n\n\n## Appearances in other material[edit]\n\n\nCedric's death is a major plot point in the stage play *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, in which Harry and Ginny Weasley's son Albus uses a Time-Turner and prevents Cedric's death. Due to his humiliation in the Triwizard Tournament, Cedric eventually becomes a Death Eater and kills Neville Longbottom. Due to Neville's death, the final Horcrux Nagini was never destroyed, and as a result Voldemort is never defeated, kills Harry and takes over the Wizarding World.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nHenry Cavill auditioned for the part of Cedric Diggory but lost out to Pattinson. Ironically, Cavill was also Stephenie Meyer's first choice for the role of Edward Cullen in *Twilight*, a role which also went to Pattinson.[9][10] Pattinson has stated that he would prefer to reprise his role as Cedric Diggory over portraying Edward Cullen in the *Twilight* films again. Pattinson credits his experience during the production of *Goblet of Fire* for keeping him in acting.[11][12]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nCedric's death was listed by Insider.com as the most devastating death in the Harry Potter films, particularly noting the mourning of Cedric's father and Harry's refusal to leave Cedric's body.[13][14][15]\n\n\nThe character's fate in the alternate reality of *The Cursed Child* was controversial for fans of the series, especially considering that Cedric was an embodiment of good-natured and kind-heartedness. While the play and novelisation were controversial enough with fans of the series, the idea that Cedric's \"heart of gold\" would turn evil was a difficult idea to stomach for some readers, especially with the idea of him murdering another beloved character such as Neville Longbottom.[4][6][7][8]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Leishmann, Rachel (26 January 2020). \"Cedric Diggory and his part in the Potter series as a whole\". *Wizards And What Not*.

Rowling's *Harry Potter* series. She first appears in the novel *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (1997), on the Hogwarts express as a first year student on her way to Hogwarts. After Harry and Ron save her from a mountain troll in the girls' restroom, she becomes best friends with them and often uses her quick wit, deft recall, and encyclopaedic knowledge to lend aid in dire situations. Rowling has stated that Hermione resembles herself as a young girl, with her insecurity and fear of failure.[2]\n\n\nThe character has had immense popularity. The version of Hermione portrayed by Emma Watson in all eight *Harry Potter* films from *Philosopher's Stone* in 2001 to *Deathly Hallows – Part 2* in 2011 was voted the best female character of all time in a poll conducted amongst Hollywood professionals by *The Hollywood Reporter* in 2016.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Character development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHermione first appears in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* when she meets Harry and Ron on the Hogwarts Express, where she mocks Ron for his inability to perform a spell to turn his rat yellow. She proves just how much she knows by declaring that she memorized all the textbooks by heart. She constantly annoys her peers with her knowledge, so Harry and Ron initially consider her arrogant, especially after she criticises Ron's incantation of the *Levitation* Charm.[13] They heartily dislike her until they rescue her from a troll, for which she is so thankful that she lies to protect them from punishment, thus winning their friendship.[14] Hermione's knack for logic later enables the trio to solve a puzzle that is essential to retrieving the Philosopher's Stone, and she defeats the constrictive Devil's Snare plant by summoning a jet of \"bluebell flame\".[15][a]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHermione's first name is taken from a character in William Shakespeare's *The Winter's Tale*, though Rowling has said that the two characters have little to nothing in common.[12] Rowling said that she wanted her name to be unusual since if fewer girls had the name, fewer girls would get teased for it and it seemed the sort of name that \"a pair of professional dentists, who liked to prove how clever they were\" would give their daughter.[12] Her original surname was \"Puckle\", but Rowling felt the name \"did not suit her at all\", and so the less frivolous Granger was used.[2]\n\n\n\n## *Harry Potter* books[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHermione later uses Polyjuice Potion to impersonate Bellatrix when the trio steal Hufflepuff's cup (a Horcrux) from Gringotts. She, Harry, and Ron join Dumbledore's Army in the Battle of Hogwarts, during which Hermione destroys Hufflepuff's cup in the Chamber of Secrets with a basilisk fang. Hermione and Ron also share their first kiss during the battle.[29] In the final battle in the Great Hall, Hermione fights Bellatrix with the help of Ginny Weasley and Luna. However, the three of them are unable to defeat Bellatrix and stop fighting her once Molly Weasley orders them to disengage.[30]\n\n\n\n#### Epilogue[edit]\n\n\nIn the epilogue of *Deathly Hallows*, which is set nineteen years after Voldemort's death, Hermione and Ron have two children: Rose Granger-Weasley, whom they are sending off to her first year at Hogwarts, and a younger son named Hugo.[DH Ch.37] Though the epilogue does not explicitly say Hermione and Ron are married,[31] news articles and other sources treat it as fact.[32][33][34]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Carey, Brycchan (2003). \"Hermione and the house-elves: the literary and historical contexts of J.

Before leaving on the quest, she helps ensure the safety of her parents by placing a false memory charm on them, making them think they are Wendell and Monica Wilkins, whose lifetime ambition is to move to Australia. She inherits Dumbledore's copy of *The Tales of Beedle the Bard*, which allows her to decipher some secrets of the Deathly Hallows. She prepared for their departure and journey by placing an Undetectable Extension Charm on a small beaded purse so she can fill the infinite depths of the bag with things they will need. Hermione's spell saves her and Harry from Lord Voldemort and his snake Nagini in Godric's Hollow, though the ricochet snaps Harry's wand. When she, Ron, and Harry are caught by Snatchers, who are hunting for Muggle-borns under the Ministry's orders, Hermione disguises Harry by temporarily disfiguring his face with a Stinging Jinx. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHermione is portrayed during the whole series as an exceptionally talented young witch. J.K. Rowling has said that Hermione is a \"borderline genius.\"[54] She got ten O.W.L.s, which were nine Outstanding and one Exceeds Expectations. She is the best student in Harry's year and is repeatedly the first student to master any spell or charm introduced in her classes and even from more advanced years, as evidenced when she can conjure a Protean Charm on the D.A.'s fake Galleon coins, which is a N.E.W.T. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHermione's most prominent features include her prodigious intellect and cleverness. She is levelheaded, book-smart, and always very logical. Throughout the series, Hermione uses the skills of a librarian and teacher to gather the information needed to defeat Voldemort, the \"Dark Lord\". When in doubt, she always turns to the school library.[47] She is often bossy yet unfailingly dutiful and loyal to her friends—a person who can always be counted on. J.K. Rowling said that Hermione \"never strays off the path; she always keeps her attention focused on the job that must be done.\"[48] Despite Hermione's intelligence and bossy attitude, Rowling says Hermione has \"quite a lot of vulnerability in her personality,\"[49] as well as a \"sense of insecurity underneath,\" feels, \"utterly inadequate... \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHermione is horrified by the cruelty that house-elves suffer, and establishes S.P.E.W., the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, as an effort to gain basic rights for them. She is Bulgarian Quidditch prodigy Viktor Krum's date at the Yule Ball of the Triwizard Tournament.[21] The proper pronunciation of her name (*Her-my-oh-nee*) is interjected into the plot when she teaches it to Krum; the best he can do is \"Herm-own-ninny,\" but she has no problem with it.[2] She later gets into a heated argument with Ron after he accuses her of \"fraternising with the enemy\" about her friendship with Krum. In the book, Hermione's feelings toward Ron are hinted at when she says that Ron can't see her \"like a girl,\" but Krum could. She supports Harry through the Triwizard Tournament, helping him prepare for each task. At the end of the second task, Krum asks her to come to see him over the summer in Bulgaria, but she politely declines. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHermione (along with Ron's mother Molly Weasley and a few female students of Hogwarts) develops a liking for Defence Against the Dark Arts (DADA) teacher Gilderoy Lockhart as he had written all the books required for the DADA in *Chamber of Secrets*.[16] During a morning confrontation between the Gryffindor and Slytherin Quidditch teams, a brawl nearly ensues after Draco Malfoy calls her a \"Mudblood\", an insulting epithet for Muggle-born wizards when she defends the Gryffindor Quidditch team. She concocts the Polyjuice Potion needed for the trio to disguise themselves as Draco's housemates to collect information about the Heir of Slytherin who has reopened the Chamber of Secrets. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHermione is viewed by many as a feminist icon.[63] In *The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter,* the first book-length analysis of the *Harry Potter* series (edited and compiled by Lana A. Whited), a chapter titled \"Hermione Granger and the Heritage of Gender\" by Eliza T. Dresang, discusses Hermione's role in the series and its relation to feminist debates.[64] The chapter begins with an analysis of Hermione's name and the role of previous characters with the same name in mythology and fiction, and the heritage Hermione has inherited from these characters due to her name. Dresang also emphasises Hermione's parallelism with Rowling herself and how, as Hermione has some attributes from Rowling herself, she must be a strong character.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHermione is extremely compassionate; and very quick to help others, especially the defenceless, such as Neville Longbottom, first-years, House-Elves, fellow Muggle-borns, half-giants like Hagrid, and werewolves like Lupin. After publication of the last book, J.K. Rowling revealed that Hermione's career in the Ministry was to fight for the rights of the oppressed and disenfranchised (such as House-elves or Muggle-borns). Hermione is also very protective of her friends and values them so much that Rowling has suggested that, if Hermione looked in the Mirror of Erised, she would see Harry, Ron, and herself alive and Voldemort defeated.[52] Hermione also learns to ignore what bullies such as Draco Malfoy say to her, often preventing Harry and Ron from retaliating and thinking of some way to outsmart him. She accepts her status as a Muggle-born, and says in *Deathly Hallows* that she is \"a Mudblood and proud of it\".[53]\n\n\n\n### Magical abilities and skills[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHermione has been parodied in many sketches and animated series. On *Saturday Night Live*, Lindsay Lohan played Hermione.[85] On his show *Big Impression*, Alistair McGowan did a sketch, \"Louis Potter and the Philosopher's Scone\". It featured impressions of Nigella Lawson as Hermione.[86] In 2003, Comic Relief performed a spoof story called *Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan*, in which Miranda Richardson, who plays Rita Skeeter in the Harry Potter films, featured as Hermione.[87][88] Hermione also features in the *Harry Bladder* sketches in *All That*, where she appears as Herheiny and is played by Lisa Foiles. *The Wedge*, an Australian sketch comedy, parodies Hermione and Harry in love on a *\"Cooking With...\"* show before being caught by Snape.[89] Hermione also appears as Hermione Ranger in *Harry Podder: Dude Where's My Wand?*, a play by Desert Star Theater in Utah, written by sisters Laura J., Amy K. and Anna M. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHermione becomes a Gryffindor prefect along with Ron and befriends Luna Lovegood, but their friendship has a rocky start after Hermione chastises the publication of Luna's father: \"*The Quibbler*'s rubbish, everyone knows that.\" She also lambasts housemate Lavender Brown for believing the *Daily Prophet's* allegations of Harry fabricating stories of Voldemort's return. Ron and Hermione spend much of their time bickering, likely due to their growing romantic feelings toward one another, but they show continued loyalty to Harry. One turning point in the series is when Hermione conceives the idea of Harry secretly teaching defensive magic to a small band of students in defiance of the Ministry of Magic's dictum to teach only the subject's basic principles from a textbook, with no hands-on practice. Hermione gets an unexpectedly huge response, and the group becomes the nascent Dumbledore's Army. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHermione is the brains behind the plan to enter the place where the Stone is hidden. She responds to Harry's wariness of Professor Severus Snape and is also suspicious of him. She reveals to Harry and Ron that she does a lot of research in the library, which helped her defeat the Devil's Snare and work out the logic of the potions.\n\n\nRowling said on her website that she resisted her editor's requests to remove the troll scene, stating \"Hermione is so very arrogant and annoying in the early part of *Philosopher's Stone* that I really felt it needed something (literally) huge to bring her together with Harry and Ron.\"[2]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nlevel charm.[55] She is also the first one of her age to be able to cast non-verbal spells.[56] Hermione is a competent duellist – Rowling has stated that during the first three books Hermione could have beaten Harry in any magical duel, but by the fourth book Harry had become so good at DADA that he would have defeated Hermione.[57] Hermione did not tend to do as well in subjects that were not learned through books or formal training, as broom flying did not come as naturally to her in her first year as it did to Harry,[58] and she showed no affinity for Divination, which she dropped from her third-year studies.[59][60] She was also not good at Wizard's Chess, as it was the only thing at which she ever lost to Ron.[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile filling in for Remus Lupin in one DADA class, Snape labels Hermione \"an insufferable know-it-all\" and penalises Gryffindor after she speaks out of turn in her attempt to describe a werewolf when no one else does. She correctly deduces Lupin's secret after completing Snape's homework assignment from the class. Crookshanks proves vital in exposing Scabbers as Peter Pettigrew, an erstwhile friend of James and Lily Potter, who revealed their whereabouts to Voldemort the night of their murders, and was able to wrongly implicate Sirius Black (revealed to be Harry's godfather) in the Potters' deaths.[19][20] The Time-Turner enables Hermione and Harry to rescue Sirius and the hippogriff Buckbeak.[19][20]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Listfield, Emily (8 July 2007). \"We're all so grown up!\". *Parade*.

Bellatrix Lestrange tortures her with a Cruciatus Curse in an attempt to extract information on how Hermione, Harry, and Ron came to possess Godric Gryffindor's sword (which was supposed to be safe in the Lestrange vault at Gringotts). Bellatrix orders for Griphook the goblin to inspect the sword and tell whether it is fake or real. To save Hermione, Harry convinces him to lie to Bellatrix that the sword is a fake. When the others escape their cell, Bellatrix threatens to slit Hermione's throat. Hermione, Harry, Ron and the other prisoners being held in Malfoy Manor are eventually rescued by Dobby.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRowling said the character of Hermione has several autobiographic influences: \"I did not set out to make Hermione like me but she is a bit like me. She is an exaggeration of how I was when I was younger.\"[6] She recalled being called a \"little know-it-all\" in her youth.[2] And she says that not unlike herself, \"there is a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure\" beneath Hermione's swottiness. Finally, according to Rowling, next to Albus Dumbledore, Hermione is the perfect expository character; because of her encyclopedic knowledge, she can always be used as a plot dump to explain the *Harry Potter* universe.[10] Rowling also states that her feminist conscience is rescued by Hermione, \"who's the brightest witch of her age\" and a \"very strong female character.\"[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, she is unable to join Harry and Ron in the investigation after the hair plucked from the robes of Slytherin student Millicent Bulstrode (with whom Hermione was previously matched up during Lockhart's ill-fated Duelling Club) was that of her cat, whose appearance she takes on in her human form; it takes several weeks for the effects to completely wear off. Hermione is Petrified by the basilisk after successfully identifying the creature through library research. Though she lies incapacitated in the hospital wing, the information she has found and left behind is crucial to Harry and Ron in their successful mission to solve the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets. Hermione is revived after Harry kills the basilisk, but she is distraught to learn that all end-of-year exams have been cancelled as a school treat.[17]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** Brown, Jen (26 July 2007). \"Finished 'Potter'?

Hermione's feelings for Ron continue to grow and she decides to make a move by inviting him to Slughorn's Christmas Party, but he romances Lavender instead in retaliation for his belief that Hermione had kissed Krum years earlier. She attempts to get even by dating Cormac at the Christmas party, but her plan goes awry and she abandons him midway through the party.[26][27] Ron and Hermione continually feud with each other (Ron is upset with her because she set birds to attack him after seeing him and Lavender kissing; Hermione is mostly mad because of her growing jealousy) until he suffers a near-fatal poisoning from tainted mead, which frightens her enough to reconcile with him. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Hermione Jean Granger's name is more a reflection of her parents than her own personality\". *Insider*. 15 November 2018.

Rowling herself says Hermione \"turned white\" in that she \"lost colour from her face after a shock.\"[43]\n\n\nAnother description from early in *Prisoner of Azkaban* is: \"They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice-Cream Parlour, Ron looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving frantically at him.\"[45] Some claim this is a direct description of her skin colour, while others claim it's a relative description of the results of a tan acquired over the summer break.[46]\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPhilip Nel of Kansas State University notes that \"Rowling, who worked for Amnesty International, evokes her social activism through Hermione's passion for oppressed elves and the formation of her 'Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare'\".[67] Scholars such as Brycchan Carey have praised the books' abolitionist sentiments, viewing Hermione's Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare as a model for younger readers' political engagement.[68][69]\n\n\nHowever, in an analysis for *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, Rowland Manthrope states that \"seven books on, we still only know her as swottish, sensible Hermione—a caricature, not a character.\"[70]\n\n\n\n## Portrayals[edit]\n\n\n### Film series[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## In other material[edit]\n\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, it is shown that Hermione has become Minister for Magic, succeeding Kingsley Shacklebolt.\n\n\n\n## Characterisation[edit]\n\n\n### Appearance[edit]\n\n\nThe books describe Hermione as having \"bushy brown hair\"[35][36][37] and brown eyes.[38] Her front buck teeth, already very large,[35][37] grow uncontrollably in *Goblet of Fire* after she is affected by a spell cast by Draco Malfoy.[39] Madam Pomfrey attends to her in the hospital wing and, at her request, shrinks the teeth down to a normal size that matches her mouth.[40] In the films, her hair is less bushy[41] and she always has regular teeth except for a scene at the end of *Philosopher's Stone* where Emma Watson wore fake teeth. She stopped wearing them for the rest of the films because they caused difficulties in speech.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHermione buys a cat named Crookshanks, who takes to chasing Ron's pet rat, Scabbers.[18] Before the start of term, Professor Minerva McGonagall secretly gives Hermione a Time-Turner, a device which lets her go back in time and handle her heavy class schedule, though this is not revealed until the penultimate chapter. Much tension comes into play between Hermione and her two best friends; Harry is furious with her because she told McGonagall that he got a Firebolt, which was confiscated to be inspected for traces of dark magic. Ron is angry because he feels Crookshanks caused Scabbers' disappearance, while Hermione fiercely maintains that Crookshanks is innocent.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWatson has said that Hermione is a character who makes \"brain not beauty cool,\" and that though Hermione is \"slightly socially inept,\" she is \"not ashamed of herself.\"[78] When filming *Chamber of Secrets*, Watson was \"adamant\" that she wasn't like Hermione, but she reflects that \"as I got older, I realised she was the greatest role model a girl could have.\"[79] In 2007, before the release of *Order of the Phoenix,* Watson said, \"There are too many stupid girls in the media. Hermione's not scared to be clever. I think sometimes really smart girls dumb themselves down a bit, and that's bad. When I was nine or ten, I would get really upset when they tried to make me look geeky, but now I absolutely love it. I find it's so much pressure to be beautiful. Hermione doesn't care what she looks like. She's a complete tomboy.\"[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n82. **^** \"Black actress Noma Dumezweni reacts to Hermione Granger casting\". *BBC Newsbeat*. 12 January 2016.

She becomes Harry's main love interest and eventually marries him at the end of the series. She is portrayed by Bonnie Wright in all eight Harry Potter films.\n\n\n\n\n## Character development[edit]\n\n\nGinny is a pureblood witch born 11 August 1981, the seventh child and only daughter of Arthur and Molly Weasley.[2] She attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and is sorted into Gryffindor house, along with the rest of her family.

After realizing Harry's identity, Ginny asks her mother if she can board the Hogwarts Express to see him.[5]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*[edit]\n\n\nGinny is a first-year student in *Chamber of Secrets*, where she develops a crush on Harry and is sorted into Gryffindor. During the climax of the story, it is revealed that she opened the Chamber of Secrets, and is attacking Muggle-born students while under the influence of Tom Riddle's old school diary. Lucius Malfoy had slipped the diary into Ginny's cauldron in Flourish and Blotts prior to the term.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*[edit]\n\n\nGinny has little involvement in *Prisoner of Azkaban*, though she is studying at Hogwarts throughout the book and grows closer to Hermione.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGinny is a talented witch. By age 14 she could conjure a corporeal Patronus Charm, in the form of a horse.[1] She is also a gifted flier and Quidditch player;[23] she scored \"seventeen goals\" in a Quidditch practice.[24] Ginny was adept at the Bat-Bogey Hex, which drew her to the attention of Horace Slughorn, and her subsequent invitation to the Slug Club.[25]\n\n\n\n## Portrayals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGinny was voiced by Victoire Robinson for the *Chamber of Secrets* game, and by Annabel Scholey in *Deathly Hallows: Part 2*. Bonnie Wright lent her voice to her character in *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, and acted as a playable character in certain missions.[29][30] Poppy Miller played the adult Ginny in the original West End production of *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*.[31]\n\n\n\n## Family tree[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Harry Potter* family tree\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the epilogue, set nineteen years after the events of *Deathly Hallows*, Harry and Ginny are together and have three children: James, Albus and Lily. Though the epilogue does not explicitly say Ginny and Harry are married, news articles and other sources treat it as fact.[12][13][14] Rowling elaborated on Ginny's future after the release of the book, saying that after leaving Hogwarts, she joined the Holyhead Harpies and, after spending a few years as a celebrated player, retired to become the senior Quidditch correspondent at the *Daily Prophet*, and to start a family with Harry.[15][16]\n\n\n\n## In other material[edit]\n\n\nIn the play *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, Ginny must help Harry reconcile with their wayward son Albus Severus Potter, and there are references to events in previous books. Her job at *The Daily Prophet* is briefly mentioned when Draco accuses her of promoting suspicion against former Death Eaters, but she says her articles are purely sport-related.[17]\n\n\n\n## Characterization[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn *Goblet of Fire*, her role was larger as she attends the Quidditch World Cup with her father, brothers, Harry and Hermione. She attends the *Yule Ball* with Neville Longbottom and can be seen in background appearances.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*[edit]\n\n\nIn *Order of the Phoenix*, Ginny has \"given up on Harry months ago\",[6] and has a boyfriend, Michael Corner, whom she met at the Yule Ball. When Umbridge punishes Harry with a \"lifetime\" Quidditch ban, Ginny replaces him as Gryffindor Seeker. In the last part of the book, Ginny breaks up with Michael due to his sulking over Ravenclaw's defeat in the Quidditch Cup final, later replacing him with Dean Thomas. She joins Dumbledore's Army and is one of five members who accompany Harry in his attempt to rescue Sirius Black from the Department of Mysteries. Near the end of this book Ginny participates in the battle inside the Ministry of Magic, but is forced to withdraw from the action due to a broken left ankle.[7]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> The backstory with Ginny was, she was the first girl to arrive in the Weasley family in generations, but there's that old tradition of the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter and a seventh son of a seventh son, so that's why she's the seventh, because she is a gifted witch. I think you get hints of that, because she does some pretty impressive stuff here and there.\n> \n> \n\n\nOver the course of the series, Ginny becomes a strong witch who shows herself to be independent and capable, fighting alongside Harry on more than one occasion as he battles against the Dark Arts.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPropelled by the revelation that Harry, Ron, and Hermione are leaving to seek the remaining Horcruxes in *Deathly Hallows*, Ginny kisses Harry in her bedroom, and they realize they both still have intense feelings for each other. She returns to Hogwarts for her sixth year, where she works with Neville and Luna on reuniting Dumbledore's Army. As Ron is on the run with Harry and Hermione, Ginny is forced to go into hiding with her family. Though underage, she takes part in the Battle of Hogwarts despite her mother's and Harry's disapproval.[10] After Harry's supposed death, she, Hermione, and Luna take on Bellatrix Lestrange, who nearly strikes Ginny with a Killing Curse, infuriating Molly Weasley to the point of intervening and successfully duelling Bellatrix herself.[11]\n\n\n\n#### Epilogue[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGinny is forceful, independent and often speaks her mind. She has an energetic, lively personality; having feelings for Harry, she became shy and withdrawn in his presence, during the first few years of their friendship. According to Harry, growing up with six older brothers toughened her.[19] Ginny is not afraid to stand up to anyone, friend or enemy alike. She stands up to Draco Malfoy on their first meeting in Flourish and Blotts when he insults Harry in *Chamber of Secrets*. She even stands up to Hermione, her close friend, in defence of Harry's use of the *Sectumsempra* curse. When describing Ginny, J.K. Rowling notes she is \"tough, not in an unpleasant way, but gutsy\", also describing her as \"warm and compassionate\".[20] Ginny was very popular during her time at Hogwarts, and drew attraction by numerous boys. Harry and Ron felt that Ginny was \"too popular for her own good\".[21][22]\n\n\n\n### Magical abilities and skills[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"Harry Potter Q&A\". *The Daily Telegraph*.

Ginny becomes a permanent member of the Gryffindor Quidditch team as Chaser, and substitutes for Harry as Seeker when Severus Snape puts him in detention during the Quidditch Cup final. After witnessing Ginny kissing Dean in an empty corridor, Harry has an angry internal reaction. This reaction surprises him and upon reflection, he realizes his attraction to Ginny.[8] Since Ginny's older brother Ron vocally objects to Dean going out with his sister, Harry fears his reaction would be the same, if not worse, with him. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBonnie Wright played Ginny Weasley in all eight Harry Potter films. Wright voiced the character in the *Order of Phoenix*, *Half-Blood Prince* and *Deathly Hallows: Part 1* video games. Wright also played Ginny in the Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park attraction.\nWright has described Ginny's character as \"outgoing, friendly and confident.\"[26] In an interview with *The Telegraph* before the release of *Order of the Phoenix*, Wright revealed that she got the role because her brother had read the books and told her she reminded him of Ginny, and recommended that she audition for the part.[27][28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn a joint interview with *The Leaky Cauldron* and *Mugglenet*, Rowling revealed that she \"always knew\" that Ginny and Harry \"were going to come together and then part.\"[4] Rowling explained that, as the series progresses, Harry, and by extension the reader, discovers that Ginny is in fact the ideal girl for Harry. Rowling said Harry \"needs to be with someone who can stand the demands of being with Harry Potter, because he's a scary boyfriend in a lot of ways.\"[4] By the later part of the series, Ginny and Harry \"are total equals\" and \"worthy of each other.\" The author also commented that she enjoyed writing the \"big emotional journey\" both characters go through, and that she really liked Ginny as a character.[4]\n\n\n\n## Appearances[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** Bell, Christopher E.

He describes the final scene, where Harry descends to the Chamber of Secrets to rescue Ginny: \"In the climax of *Chamber of Secrets*, Harry descends to a deep underworld, is confronted by two satanic minions (Voldemort and a giant serpent), is saved from certain death by his faith in Dumbledore (the bearded God the Father/Ancient of Days), rescues the virgin (Virginia [*sic*] Weasley), and ascends in triumph. It's *Pilgrim's Progress* for a new audience.\"[32] This quote predates Rowling's revelation that Ginny's full name is Ginevra, not Virginia.[2]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  | Gabrielle Delacour |  |  | Charlie Weasley |  |  | Fred Weasley |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Fleur Delacour |  | William \"Bill\" Weasley |  | Percy Weasley |  | Audrey Weasley |  | George Weasley |  | Angelina Johnson |  | Hermione Jean Granger |  | Ronald Bilius \"Ron\" Weasley |  | Ginevra Molly \"Ginny\" Weasley |  | Harry James Potter |  | Dudley Dursley |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGinny's relationship with Dean ends altogether in April after an accidental nudge from Harry under the effects of Felix Felicis, which Ginny interprets as Dean unnecessarily trying to help her through the portrait hole.[9] Ginny and Harry share their first kiss after Gryffindor again won the Quidditch Cup defeating Ravenclaw, thus starting their relationship. This does not alter Harry's relationship with Ron as he had feared, and they get to enjoy their relationship for a peaceful few months. After Dumbledore's death, Harry ends their relationship as he fears his love for Ginny would place her in danger.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Septimus Weasley |  | Cedrella Black |  | *Mrs Prewett* |  | *Mr Prewett* |  | Ignatius Prewett |  | Lucretia Black |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Apolline Delacour |  | Monsieur Delacour |  | Bilius Weasley |  | Arthur Weasley |  | Molly Prewett |  | Gideon Prewett |  | Fabian Prewett |  | James Potter |  | Lily Evans |  | Petunia Dursley |  | Vernon Dursley |  | Marge Dursley |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. **^** \"The Big Bang Theory the Spoiler Alert Segmentation Review: How to Live with Sheldon Cooper (For the Rest of Your Life)\".

K. Rowling's *Harry Potter* series. Sirius was first mentioned briefly in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* as a wizard who lent Rubeus Hagrid a flying motorbike shortly after Lord Voldemort killed James and Lily Potter. His character becomes prominent in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, in which he is the titular prisoner, and is also revealed to be the godfather of the central character Harry Potter. He is portrayed in the film adaptations by Gary Oldman.\n\n\n\n\n## Character background[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSirius Black is the last heir of the House of Black, a once notable Pure-blood Wizarding family. His parents, Orion and Walburga Black, were both Blacks by birth and second cousins. Sirius had a younger brother, Regulus Arcturus Black, and three older cousins: Bellatrix Lestrange, Andromeda Tonks (his favourite cousin and mother of Nymphadora Tonks), and Narcissa Malfoy (mother of Draco Malfoy). In line with the Black family tradition of naming children after stars and constellations, Sirius was named after the Dog Star. Sirius's early life proved unhappy; he had come to hate most of his relatives, in particular his mother. He rejected his family's pure-blood elitism and reverence for the Dark Arts. At Hogwarts, rather than be sorted into Slytherin like the rest of his family, Sirius was placed in Gryffindor.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Things you may not have noticed about Sirius Black\". *Wizarding World*. 2017-11-06.

IGN ranked Sirius as the 8th best character in the Harry Potter universe stating, \"it's the father/son relationship that begins to develop between Sirius and Harry that endears the character to us.\"[24] Separately, WatchMojo.com placed Sirius as the 4th best character in the franchise, again citing his fatherly relationship with Harry as a highpoint of praise.[25] The character's untimely death in *Order of the Phoenix* is often regarded as one of the most emotional and heartbreaking moments of the series.[26]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSirius left home at the age of sixteen and took refuge with James and his parents. His outraged mother burned his name off the family tree. Sirius' Uncle Alphard left him a large inheritance, causing Sirius' mother to also remove Alphard's name. He was left financially independent by his uncle's generous bequest. After leaving school, Sirius fought against Voldemort, eventually joining the Order of the Phoenix. He remained close friends with James and eventually attended James and Lily Evans' (now Lily Potter) wedding as their best man. When their son, Harry, was born, Lily and James named Sirius as Harry's godfather.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThough Sirius appears several times during *Goblet of Fire*, the character appears very briefly in the film adaptation, in an expository scene in the Gryffindor common room's fireplace, with Oldman providing the voice. The actor appears again in *Order of the Phoenix*. It has been stated that Oldman and Daniel Radcliffe became very close during the filming of the series. Sirius as a teenager also made a brief appearance in *Order of the Phoenix*, played by James Walters.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nJust as in the book, Sirius returns via the Resurrection Stone in *The Deathly Hallows – Part 2* alongside James, Lily and Remus right before Harry enters the Forbidden Forest to face Voldemort. The character is referenced for the final time in the last scene, where it is revealed that Harry and Ginny's first born son was named after both James and Sirius.[10]\n\n\n\n## Attributes[edit]\n\n\n### Outward appearance[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite all of this, Rowling states that Sirius's \"redeeming quality is the affection that he is capable of feeling. He loved James like a brother and went on to transfer this attachment to Harry.\"[20][22]\n\n\n\n### Magical ability[edit]\n\n\nSirius was described as a powerful wizard by Minerva McGonagall, his former teacher.\n\n\nSirius became an Animagus at only age fifteen, and was able to turn himself into a large black dog. As he is unregistered, he is able to take advantage of his ability to continually elude the Ministry of Magic. In his Fifth year, Sirius held his own against Severus Snape, who \"knew more jinxes in his first year than most seventh years\". During the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, he survived a duel against Antonin Dolohov. However in the following fight against his cousin Bellatrix, he underestimated his opponent and even openly mocked her, before being hit by an unknown spell that blew Sirius backwards and he disappeared through the veil in the Death Chamber.\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs stated by J. K. Rowling during the BBC Paxman interview, 2003, Sirius is \"definitely dead.\"[2] She has created further intrigue, however, by making a cryptic reference to the communication mirror Sirius gave to Harry before he died: \"The mirror might not have helped as much as you think, but on the other hand, will help more than you think. You'll have to read the final book to understand that!\"[3] In the final book, Aberforth Dumbledore uses the two-way mirror – which he bought from Mundungus Fletcher a year prior – to see Harry in the Malfoy Manor cellars, which enables Aberforth to send Dobby to rescue Harry.\n\n\nSirius makes his final appearance in *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* when Harry discovers the Resurrection Stone within the golden snitch. Appearing as a ghostly figure alongside Lily, James and Lupin, Sirius supports Harry's walk into death and assures him that dying is, \"Quicker and easier than falling asleep.\" He also promises Harry that the four will always remain a part of him.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSirius takes refuge in his ancient family home at 12, Grimmauld Place. As the last Black, Sirius inherits the property and allows it to be used as the Order headquarters, although it had fallen into disrepair. Due to the ongoing manhunt, Sirius is confined there. His confinement causes depression, and he is frequently withdrawn and antagonistic – especially so by Snape's increasingly important role within the Order. Harry detects a whiff of alcohol on his breath. The hostility between himself and Kreacher, his demented house-elf, also affects him, and he is consistently hateful towards Kreacher. When he briefly leaves the house to see Harry off to Hogwarts, his Animagus form is recognised by Draco and Lucius Malfoy, resulting in more threats and warnings. Harry and Sirius stay in touch through owls and the Floo Network, a system to communicate through fireplaces. Sirius is nearly captured by Dolores Umbridge, a Ministry official who is monitoring the Network and the owl mail in and out of Hogwarts. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKnowing that the dementors have been stationed around Hogsmeade and at Hogwarts, Sirius remains in his Animagus form during this time, and is able to enter the Hogwarts grounds without being recognised by the dementors. Harry catches several glimpses of Sirius in his dog form and mistakenly believes him to be the Grim. He befriends Hermione Granger's cat Crookshanks, who is aware that Sirius is not actually a dog and who recognises Pettigrew for what he really is. Sirius breaks into Gryffindor tower at one point with a knife looking for Pettigrew, having had Crookshanks obtain Neville Longbottom's list of the dorm passwords, and shreds Ron's curtains after finding Pettigrew gone, due to Pettigrew having faked his death and framed Crookshanks. After Harry's broom is destroyed by the Whomping Willow during a Quidditch match invaded by Dementors, Sirius anonymously sends Harry a Firebolt as a Christmas gift, although it is confiscated by Professor McGonagall on suspicion that the broom is jinxed.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a student at Hogwarts, Sirius was well-known for being a troublemaker, and once mentioned to Harry that he, James, Lupin, and Pettigrew \"were all idiots.\"[16] He once stated that he had never been appointed a prefect as he always spent too much time in detention with James.[17] Sirius is protective of Harry, but also encourages him to take unwise risks and sometimes - inappropriately - acts with him as he used to with James.[18] On this, the author commented that \"what Harry craves is a father.\"[19] Rowling has stated that though she likes Sirius, \"I do not think he is wholly wonderful.\"[20] According to her, despite being brave and loyal, Sirius is also reckless, embittered, and \"slightly unbalanced by his long stay in Azkaban.\"[20] When asked if Harry has a godmother, Rowling replied that \"Sirius was always too busy being a big rebel to get married.\"[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNear the middle of the novel, a large number of Death Eaters, including Sirius's hated cousin Bellatrix, escape Azkaban. The Ministry, which refuses to accept that Voldemort has returned and that the dementors have joined him, tries to blame on Sirius, stating that Sirius helped the prisoners escape and is leading them.\n\n\nSirius acts as a father figure to Harry throughout the book. Fun-loving, bold, and reckless, he encourages Harry to oppose Umbridge and her reforms and strongly approves of Harry starting the secret defensive tutorial group for students, Dumbledore's Army. He also demonstrates a high-level of trust in and respect for Harry, willingly answering the latter's questions about the Order and Voldemort. Sirius' long incarceration at a young age affected his emotional development. Lupin and Molly Weasley express disapproval for Sirius's behaviour around Harry, stating that Sirius treats his godson as if he is James, Harry's father, and that this is inappropriate.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnlike his parents and brother, Sirius detested the Dark Arts and did not believe in the so-called purity of blood. Rowling has said that Sirius has also proven to \"be very good at spouting bits of excellent personal philosophy, but he does not always live up to them.\" This primarily has to do with his treatment of Kreacher the house-elf; because Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of the home he had always hated (and also due to Kreacher's parading of the attitudes and views of Sirius's parents), Sirius is hateful to Kreacher and consistently mistreats him. This in turn comes back to haunt him, as Kreacher eventually betrays Sirius to Voldemort, leading to Sirius's death. Rowling has also stated that unlike Lupin, who is the same age as Sirius and appears more mature in nature, Sirius never really grew up, as he was placed in Azkaban during his early twenties and therefore had not had a very normal adult life. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn contrast to his home life, Sirius greatly enjoyed life at Hogwarts, where he was inseparable from his best friend, James Potter. Sirius and James were immensely popular and known for their exceptionally good looks. Students liked his biting humour, and teachers respected his intelligence, though not his behaviour. His popularity was not universal, as a mutual hatred sprang up between James and Severus Snape. Sirius actively supported James, leading to Snape developing an equal and lifelong loathing of Sirius. Sirius and James often went out of their way to bully Snape, whom they despised for his great interest in the Dark Arts. They also became best friends with Peter Pettigrew and Remus Lupin, whom they later discovered was a werewolf. To support Lupin, Sirius, James, and Peter secretly became Animagi, which allowed them to safely accompany Lupin during his transformations and keep him under control. Sirius's form is that of a huge black dog, from which his nickname *Padfoot* was derived.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGary Oldman first portrayed Sirius in the film adaptation of *Prisoner of Azkaban*. Oldman revealed that he accepted the part because he needed the money, as he had not taken on any major work in several years in order to spend more time with his family.[6] The actor compared Sirius to John Lennon,[6] and also said he was \"surprised by how difficult it was to pull off\", comparing the role to Shakespearean dialogue. Oldman suggested Sirius' hairstyle, while Alfonso Cuarón, the director of the third film, designed his tattoos.[7] He had read the first book, and his children were fans of the series. The part made Oldman a hero with his children and their schoolmates.[8] Oldman said about his work in the *Harry Potter* films that he has \"...done so much R-rated work, it's nice to have a job you can show your kids\".[9] Oldman was said to bring energy to the character of Sirius, and the actor stated that this energy came from Cuarón and described him as having \"such enthusiasm and a joy for life\".[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSirius flees Europe – to somewhere tropical, Harry believes – beyond the Ministry of Magic's jurisdiction. There, he slowly recovers from his years in Azkaban and regains his health. Although he can only communicate sparingly with Harry by owl post, he gives Harry reasoned and sensible advice. Harry grows closer to Sirius and relies on his help. Sirius, worried, returns to Britain when Harry tells him that his scar has begun hurting him again (a signal of Voldemort's presence), and when there are reports of Death Eater activities at the Quidditch World Cup. He sacrifices some of his regained health to help Harry; by the time he reaches Hogsmeade, he is once again gaunt and dishevelled, hiding in a cave with Buckbeak and surviving mainly on rats (with occasional gifts of food from Harry, Ron, and Hermione). He has little influence on Harry in this book; his presence cannot prevent the disaster at the Triwizard Tournament, and he mostly gives Harry advice on how to complete the Triwizard Tasks. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRowling revealed a family tree in the J. K. Rowling Documentary on ITV concerning all of the grandchildren of the Weasley family. In this family tree, it is known that Harry named his first son James Sirius, after his father and godfather.[4]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter* prequel[edit]\n\n\nSirius and James are the protagonists of an 800-word story set three years before Harry's birth.[5] The two friends are riding Sirius's motorbike and are chased by two Muggle policemen for breaking the speed limit. The policemen attempt to arrest them when three Death Eaters on broomsticks fly down towards them. Sirius and James use the police car as a barrier and the Death Eaters crash into it. In the end, they escape from the policemen flying on the motorbike.\n\n\n\n## Portrayals within films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** [HP7], chapter 10\n15. **^** [HP3], chapter 17\n16. **^** [HP5], chapter 29\n17. **^** [HP6], chapter 24\n18. **^** [HP5], chapter 17\n19. **^** \"The Leaky Cauldron and MN Interview Joanne Kathleen Rowling – Part 2\".

He notices the pet rat Scabbers perched on Ron Weasley's shoulder. This serves as a turning point in the series and sets the events of the third novel, as Sirius immediately recognises Scabbers as Pettigrew's Animagus form. He realises that stationed at Hogwarts, Pettigrew will easily be able to deliver Harry to Voldemort should Voldemort ever regain power. This knowledge clears his mind and gives him the mental strength to escape Azkaban. He is the first person known to have escaped the wizard prison by his own means, accomplishing this feat by transforming into his Animagus dog form. The dementors' inability to detect Animagi, along with his severe weight loss from malnutrition, allow him to slip through his cell bars. After his escape, Sirius takes refuge in and around Hogsmeade, intent on exacting revenge upon Pettigrew and remaining near Harry. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter giving his motorbike to Hagrid so that Hagrid could deliver Harry to the Dursleys, Sirius then tracked down Pettigrew, determined to kill him in revenge. However, Pettigrew outwitted him: confronted by Sirius on a city street, he created an explosion, faking his own death (leaving a severed finger behind as evidence) and killing twelve Muggles in the process. Sirius was arrested, accused of murdering Pettigrew and the muggles and of serving Voldemort, and was promptly thrown in prison by Barty Crouch, Sr. without receiving a trial. He spent the next twelve years in Azkaban, brooding over his friends' deaths and obsessing over Pettigrew's betrayal. Sirius states that unlike most other Azkaban prisoners (who often became insane during their terms of imprisonment), he was able to keep his sanity because he knew he was innocent, and also used his Animagus form to ward off the Dementors, who are unable to perceive unsophisticated canine minds.\n\n\n\n## Appearances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSirius is described as a tall man with long, black hair and grey eyes.[11] Several times during the series, Sirius is stated to be very good-looking[12][13] and \"carelessly handsome\"[14] prior to his imprisonment; Harry also noted that as a teenager, Sirius always had a slightly spoiled, haughty look on his face. His long years in Azkaban made his face gaunt, and lack of grooming resulted in long, dirty hair and yellow teeth. Harry's first impression of Sirius is of a corpse.[15]\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlthough there are several living Black family members throughout the series, all are either female, female-line distaff Black descendants, or descendants of disowned family members, and none of them has the name of Black. The last known surviving bearer of the family name, Sirius, is murdered by his cousin Bellatrix Lestrange in *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen the Potters became aware that Harry was Voldemort's specific target, Albus Dumbledore advised them to go into hiding using the Fidelius Charm, a highly complex spell allowing a secret to be concealed within another person. Trusting Sirius above all of their other friends, Lily and James wanted him to be their Secret Keeper. Sirius, however, worried that Voldemort would immediately suspect him of being the Potters' Secret Keeper and would target him; so he convinced the Potters to reassign Pettigrew as their Secret Keeper because he did not believe Voldemort would ever suspect a \"weak, talentless thing\" like Pettigrew. As it turned out, Pettigrew was Voldemort's spy within the Order. He betrayed the Potters to Voldemort, who subsequently tracked them down and murdered them.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Thomas Riddle Jr. |  | Merope Gaunt |  | Morfin Gaunt |  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Black family |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Sirius Black |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Bellatrix Lestrange[n 2] |  | Tom Marvolo RiddleLord Voldemort |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Blacks intermarried with several other pure-blood families, including the families of known Dark (or at least, malicious) wizards such as Bulstrode, Crabbe, Flint, Lestrange, Malfoy, Rosier, and Yaxley, but also non-Dark families such as Crouch, Longbottom, Macmillan, Potter, Prewett, and Weasley. This was done to ensure that pure-bloods would last in the years to come. That is why most of the pure-blood families are interrelated; because their ancestors married other pure-bloods. The last several generations of Blacks all trace their ancestry back to Phineas Nigellus Black and Ursula Flint. The Blacks believed in Voldemort's idea of \"purifying the Wizarding race\", but many, such as Sirius's parents, refrained from outwardly supporting him once they saw what he was willing to do for power. Sirius's brother, Regulus Black, was a Death Eater, but later reconsidered after Voldemort tried to kill the house elf Kreacher. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith his growing power, Voldemort implants a false vision into Harry's mind that Sirius is captive and under torture at the Department of Mysteries. Harry tries to contact Sirius at Grimmauld Place through the Floo Network, in order to determine whether he is at the Ministry or not; however, he discovers that the house is seemingly deserted apart from Kreacher, who tells Harry that Sirius will not return from the Ministry. Convinced that Voldemort is torturing Sirius, Harry and his friends enter the deserted Ministry and gain access to the Department of Mysteries. When they are ambushed by Death Eaters, Harry realises Voldemort lured him into a trap. It is Snape, however, who saves them; after confirming that Sirius is safe at Grimmauld Place (it is later revealed that Sirius had been upstairs tending to Buckbeak the Hippogriff and therefore had not been in sight when Harry tried to contact him), Snape alerts the Order that the students are missing and have gone to the Ministry. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTowards the end of the novel, Harry, Ron, and Hermione confront Sirius and Harry nearly kills him; however, Lupin's timely intervention stops Harry. Lupin, who has learned that Sirius is innocent, is reunited in friendship with him. Pettigrew is unmasked, and, most importantly, Harry stops Sirius and Lupin from murdering Pettigrew, arguing that his father would not want his friends to commit murder. Harry begins to view Sirius as a surrogate father, although events swiftly turn against him again – Pettigrew escapes, and Sirius is captured by the dementors at Hogwarts and sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss, a fate worse than death. Harry and Hermione help him escape with Buckbeak, a hippogriff who had also been unjustly condemned. Sirius is once again a wanted man.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Victoire Weasley |  | Dominique Weasley |  | Louis Weasley |  |  |  |  |  |  | Fred Weasley, Jr. |  | Roxanne Weasley |  | Rose Granger-Weasley |  | Hugo Granger-Weasley |  | James Sirius Potter |  | Albus Severus Potter |  | Lily Luna Potter |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Molly Weasley |  | Lucy Weasley |\n|\n\n |\n| **Notes:**\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The names \"Thomas\" and \"Mary\" Riddle are taken from the *Harry Potter* film series.\n2. **^** In *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, Bellatrix is depicted as having had a secret daughter — Delphini (Delphi) \"The Augurey\" — who claims to also be the daughter of Lord Voldemort.\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe is later summoned to Hogwarts by Dumbledore and listens to Harry's re-telling of Voldemort's rebirth. Dumbledore tasks him with alerting Lupin, Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcher, and other members of the Order of the Phoenix, and is instructed by Dumbledore to lay low at Lupin's for a while. Sirius reassures Harry, who does not want him to leave, that they will see each other again soon and then departs.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Isla Black of the first generation shown was disowned for marrying Bob Hitchens, a Muggle.\n* Phineas Black of the second generation shown was disowned for supporting Muggle rights.\n* Marius Black, third generation son of Cygnus and Violetta Black (née Violetta Bulstrode), was disowned as he was a Squib.\n* Cedrella Black, also third generation and cousin of Marius, was disowned for marrying a blood traitor, Septimus Weasley.\n* Alphard Black of the fourth generation shown was posthumously disowned for leaving gold in his will to his \"runaway nephew\", Sirius Black.\n* Sirius Black of the fifth generation shown, ran away from home and was subsequently removed.\n* Andromeda Black, cousin of Sirius, was disowned for marrying Muggle-Born Ted Tonks.\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDumbledore refers to this as \"a brutal ending to what was going to be a long and happy relationship.\"[1] Harry is left to mourn Sirius, reflecting that, despite his flaws, he was a loving and protective godfather, and the closest thing Harry had ever had to a real parent.

During a frenzied duel with Bellatrix, Sirius taunts her for failing to harm him. Bellatrix strikes Sirius with a curse, sending him backwards into the veil and to his death. Overcome with grief and rage, Harry tries – and fails – to get revenge on Bellatrix, only to be interrupted by Voldemort's arrival. After a short duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore, Voldemort flees, but not before being seen by the Minister for Magic and other Ministry officials. As a result, the Ministry abandons its stance that Voldemort has not returned, and Dumbledore is trusted once more. He, in turn, persuades the Minister that Sirius is innocent.

Ron has six siblings: his five older brothers, Bill, Charlie, Percy, twins Fred and George, and a younger sister, Ginny, each with their own distinct personality trait. Ron is often overshadowed by his siblings' accomplishments, but this is shown to be borne out of a lack of belief in himself, rather than a lack of actual talent or skill. Like his brothers, Percy and Bill he is made a Prefect.

K. Rowling\n |\n| --- |\n| * Wizarding World\n |\n| Books | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Ronald Bilius Weasley** is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's *Harry Potter* fantasy novel series. His first appearance was in the first book of the series, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, as the best friend of Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. He is a member of the Weasley family, a pure blood family that resides in \"The Burrow\" outside Ottery St. Catchpole. Being the only member of the three main characters raised in magical society, he also provides insight into the Wizarding World's magical customs and traditions. Along with Harry and Hermione, he is a member of Gryffindor house and is present for most of the action throughout the series.\n\n\n\n\n## Character development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn *Harry Podder: Dude Where's My Wand?*, a play by Desert Star Theater in Utah, written by sisters Laura J., Amy K. and Anna M. Lewis, Ron appears as \"Ron Sneasley\".[25]\n\n\nIn the *Harry Bladder* sketches in *All That*, Ron appears as ReRon and is played by Bryan Hearne.\n\n\nRon also is a regular character in *Potter Puppet Pals* sketches by Neil Cicierega. In one of the episodes, \"The Mysterious Ticking Noise\", Ron, along with Snape, Harry, Hermione and Dumbledore, is killed by a bomb placed by Voldemort; the episode being the seventeenth most viewed video of all time as of 2008 and the winner for \"Best Comedy\" of the year 2007 at YouTube.[26]\n\n\nIn the 2008 American comedy film *Yes Man*, Carl (portrayed by Jim Carrey) attends a Harry Potter-themed party hosted by Norman (Rhys Darby), in which Norman disguises as Ron.\n\n\nIn *A Very Potter Musical* (2009), *A Very Potter Sequel* (2010) and *A Very Potter Senior Year*, parody musicals by StarKid Productions, Ron was portrayed by Joey Richter.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Rowling, Ron was among the characters she created on the first day.[1] Ron is inspired by Rowling's best friend Sean Harris (to whom *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* is dedicated), but she has clearly stated that she \"never set out to describe Sean in Ron, but Ron has a Sean-ish turn of phrase.\"[2] Like Harris is to Rowling, Ron is \"always there\" when Harry needs him. Ron fits many of the stereotypes expected of the sidekick; he is often used as comic relief, is loyal to the hero, and lacks much of the talent Harry possesses, at least, early on, in terms of magical power. However, he proves his bravery and magical ability several times, such as by playing 'real wizard's chess' in the first book, entering into the Forbidden Forest with Harry during the second book despite his arachnophobia, producing a full-corporeal Patronus Charm in the fifth book and even, in the seventh book, getting basilisk fangs from the Chamber of Secrets by mimicking Parseltongue without understanding it.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLater in the novel, Ron and Harry transform themselves using Polyjuice Potion to resemble Draco Malfoy's close associates Crabbe and Goyle, so that they can spy on him, and find out what he knows about the Chamber of Secrets. During the hunt to find the Heir of Slytherin, Ron is responsible for providing the first clue to the identity of Tom Marvolo Riddle, recalling that he saw the name \"T. M. Riddle\" on a trophy inscribed \"For Special Services to the School\". Later Ron is forced to come face-to-face with his worst nightmare, spiders, in the Forbidden Forest, where the two have ventured at Hagrid's suggestion. Giant spiders nearly devour the two of them, but the Weasley Ford Anglia returns from the Forbidden Forest and rescues the pair. Ron and Harry then discover the entrance into the Chamber, and enter it in the hopes of saving Ginny, Ron's sister, who had been kidnapped and kept in the Chamber. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRon is known for his humour, loyalty, readiness to defend his friends and his love of food. Rowling in an interview described Ron as very funny but insensitive and immature, saying \"There's a lot of immaturity about Ron, and that's where a lot of the humor comes from.\"[9] As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Alfonso Cuarón, who directed the third film in the series, *Prisoner of Azkaban*, assigned them to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the character's emotional experience. Of Rupert Grint's essay, Cuarón recalls, \"Rupert didn't deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didn't do it, he said, 'I'm Ron; Ron wouldn't do it.' So I said, 'Okay, you do understand your character.'\"[10] Commenting on Ron's character development in the final book, Rowling explained that \"Ron is the most immature of the three main characters, but in part seven he grows up. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn his birthday in March, Ron accidentally eats Amortentia-infused Chocolate Cauldrons (actually meant for Harry). After being cured by Slughorn, he then consumes poisoned mead (which Draco Malfoy actually intended for Dumbledore). Harry saves his life by forcing a bezoar, a poison antidote, into his mouth, and Ron is transferred to the hospital wing. A panic-stricken Hermione arrives, forgetting her past anger. While sitting by his bed, Hermione, Harry, Ginny and the twins hear Ron mutter Hermione's name in his delirium, although they do not hear what he is saying and ignore it. Conversely, Ron feigns sleep when Lavender visits him. Upon recovering, Ron and Hermione reconcile,[HBP Ch.18][HBP Ch.19][HBP Ch.20] and a little while later, Ron and Lavender break up. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the epilogue of *Deathly Hallows*, which is set nineteen years after Voldemort's death, Ron and Hermione have two children: Rose Granger-Weasley, whom they are sending off to her first year at Hogwarts, and a younger son named Hugo.[DH Ch.37] Though the epilogue does not explicitly say Ron and Hermione are married,[DH Ch.37] news articles and other sources treat it as a fact.[4][5][6] Ron has also passed his Muggle driving test, despite Hermione's apparent belief that he could not do so without Confunding the examiner. (Ron secretly reveals to Harry he actually did Confund the examiner.) He and Harry work for the Ministry of Magic as Aurors, and along with Hermione they have helped to revamp the Ministry; it is far different from the one that existed previously.[7] Before becoming an Auror, Ron joins George at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, which becomes a very lucrative business.[8]\n\n\n\n## Characterisation[edit]\n\n\n### Outward appearance[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRowling first introduces Ron with his family in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. Harry is lost at King's Cross railway station, and the Weasleys guide him through the barrier at Platform 9¾ into the wizarding world. Ron and Harry share a compartment on the Hogwarts Express, and they begin their friendship. Ron is fascinated with the famous Harry, and Harry is fascinated with the ordinary Ron. On the train, they both meet Hermione Granger as well, whom they initially dislike but who later becomes their close friend after they save each other during a dangerous encounter with a mountain troll.[PS Ch.6] Ron and Harry share the same classes throughout the series and generally have similar academic successes and disappointments. Ron plays a vital part in the quest to save the Philosopher's Stone. His strategy at Wizard's Chess allows Hermione and Harry to proceed safely through a dangerous, life-sized animated chess game. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRowling introduces Ron as \"tall, thin and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\"[PS Ch.6] Ron has the trademark red hair of the Weasleys and is indeed one of Harry's tallest schoolmates, even outgrowing some of his older brothers. Rowling states in the novels that Ron has freckles, though Rupert Grint, the actor who plays Ron, has none. Rowling has also stated that Ron has blue eyes.\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2016, British actor Paul Thornley played Ron Weasley in the original London cast of *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child* at the Palace Theatre, London in the West End. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in a Play at the 2017 Whatsonstage.com Awards. Thornley reprised his role as Ron Weasley on Broadway at the Lyric Theater in 2018.\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nRon Weasley has made several appearances in parodies of *Harry Potter* and pop culture:\n\n\nSeth Meyers appeared as Ron in *Saturday Night Live* in the sketch in which Lindsay Lohan portrays Hermione.[21]\n\n\nOn his *The Big Impression* show, Alistair McGowan did a sketch called \"Louis Potter and the Philosopher's Scone\".

K. Rowling.[23][24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*, the Weasleys invite Harry and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup. Ron is in awe of his favourite Quidditch champion, Viktor Krum.[GoF Ch.7][GoF Ch.8] Ron is even more excited when Krum, still a student at the Durmstrang wizarding school, comes to Hogwarts to take part in the Triwizard Tournament, a magical wizarding tournament opposing the top three magic schools in Europe.[GoF Ch.12] However, when Harry, underage, mysteriously becomes the fourth Tournament champion, Ron joins the dissenters who think Harry somehow cheated his way into the tournament and feels let down; according to Hermione, this stems from Ron's latent envy caused by being left out of the spotlight shared by Harry or his brothers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Victoire Weasley |  | Dominique Weasley |  | Louis Weasley |  |  |  |  |  |  | Fred Weasley, Jr. |  | Roxanne Weasley |  | Rose Granger-Weasley |  | Hugo Granger-Weasley |  | James Sirius Potter |  | Albus Severus Potter |  | Lily Luna Potter |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Molly Weasley |  | Lucy Weasley |\n|\n\n |\n| **Notes:**\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The names \"Thomas\" and \"Mary\" Riddle are taken from the *Harry Potter* film series.\n2. **^** In *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, Bellatrix is depicted as having had a secret daughter — Delphini (Delphi) \"The Augurey\" — who claims to also be the daughter of Lord Voldemort.\n |\n\n\n![](image)The Weasley family as shown in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, from left to right: Fred or George, Ron, Charlie, Molly, Arthur, Ginny, Bill, Percy, and George or Fred.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing this, Ron begins to demonstrate more aptitude and general knowledge, along with a sudden spurt in maturity after a terrible row with Harry. For a while, he effectively leads the trio in the hunt for the Horcruxes while Harry suffers a major depression.\n\n\nRowling has stated that Ron's Patronus Charm takes the form of a Jack Russell Terrier, \"a really sentimental choice\" as Rowling herself owns a Jack Russell.[12]\n\n\n\n### Family tree[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Harry Potter* family tree\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the summer, Ron attempts to write to Harry several times. He receives no reply because Dobby the house elf is stopping Harry's wizard mail. Ron becomes so concerned that he and his brothers Fred and George fly their father's enchanted Ford Anglia car to Harry's home at his aunt and uncle's house. Harry spends the next month at the Weasleys' home, The Burrow. While attempting to depart from King's Cross station, Harry and Ron find themselves unable to enter the barrier to access Platform 9¾. With Harry, Ron conceives the idea of taking the flying Ford Anglia to Hogwarts. The plan is successful, but the Anglia loses power at the end of the journey and crashes into the Whomping Willow. Ron and Harry survive the impact, but Ron's wand is broken in the process, and the car drives itself off into the Forbidden Forest, a forest at the edge of the Hogwarts grounds in which student access is prohibited. Ron receives a Howler from his mother, berating him for taking the car.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRupert Grint portrays Ron Weasley in all eight Harry Potter films. He auditioned after seeing a segment on the BBC children's news programme, Newsround, inviting children to send in information about themselves. Grint sent in a photo, a self-written script and a rap, documenting his desire to portray the character.[17]\n\n\nRowling was supportive of the casting, calling Grint \"perfect\" for the role of Ron.[18] Grint's portrayal of the character was critically acclaimed with him receiving a Satellite Award in the category of \"Outstanding New Talent\",[19] and a Young Artist Award for \"Most Promising Young Newcomer\" for his performance in the first film. His performance has often been cited as the best of three main characters.[20]\n\n\n\n### Theatre[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* Ron, who has grown taller over the summer, attracts the attention of Lavender Brown. Harry, the new Quidditch Captain, picks Ron to continue as Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, over competing candidate Cormac McLaggen who is equally-skilled but has difficulty with teamwork and following orders.[HBP Ch.11] Upon learning Hermione most likely had kissed Krum, Ron performs increasingly badly at Quidditch, and thrown off by jealousy of his former idol, becomes unkind to Hermione. His low self-esteem is not helped much by his younger sister Ginny who after Ron reacts badly to finding her kissing her boyfriend, throws in the fact that of those in the group, Ron is the only one who has never had his first kiss. To bolster Ron's confidence, Harry pretends to give him Felix Felicis, a potion which makes the drinker lucky; believing he has actually taken it, Ron performs admirably and Gryffindor wins the match. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRon supports Hermione's suggestion of Harry teaching students practical Defence Against the Dark Arts, which Umbridge, using the Ministry of Magic to slowly take over the Dumbledore-run school, has all but banned. He co-founds the secret students' group called Dumbledore's Army.[OotP Ch.15] He also joins the Gryffindor Quidditch team as Keeper, but his nerves and confidence issues often get the better of him during practices and matches, causing the Slytherins to make up a song about how Ron will make sure Slytherin win the interhouse Quidditch Cup. However, during the last match, Ron plays better and wins the game and the Quidditch Cup for Gryffindor. At the climax of the novel, Ron battles the Death Eaters alongside Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood at the Department of Mysteries. He is injured in the fight, but makes a full recovery by the end of the novel.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAttention is drawn several times to Ron's deepening relationships to Harry and Hermione, with unresolved romantic tension with Hermione being one of the main subplots of the novel (and indeed, the entire series). Furthermore, Harry and Ron's friendship has strengthened to the point where Harry can tell Ron that his Quidditch performance is endangering his membership on the team without either character taking it personally.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*[edit]\n\n\nRon agrees to go with Harry and Hermione on the quest to destroy all of Voldemort's Horcruxes. Worried that the Ministry, now taken over by Voldemort, will learn he is with Harry on a quest, Ron dresses the family ghoul up in pyjamas and spreads the story he is ill with \"spattergroit\", a type of highly contagious magical illness. Ron disguises himself as Reginald Cattermole as the trio attempts to find the locket Horcrux in the possession of Dolores Umbridge.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome of Ron's qualities serve as foils to Harry's. Whereas Harry is an orphan with more gold than he needs, Ron comes from a loving but poor family. Many of his possessions are hand-me-downs. Harry is famous but would prefer to avoid the spotlight; Ron, in comparison, is often perceived as a mere lackey and sometimes becomes jealous of the recognition Harry receives. Overshadowed by his many siblings and the fame and achievements of his friends, Ron's inferiority complex and need to prove himself are the main thrusts of his character arc. As the books progress, he matures from an insecure boy to a competent young man capable of strategy and leadership.\n\n\n\n## Appearances[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  | Gabrielle Delacour |  |  | Charlie Weasley |  |  | Fred Weasley |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Fleur Delacour |  | William \"Bill\" Weasley |  | Percy Weasley |  | Audrey Weasley |  | George Weasley |  | Angelina Johnson |  | Hermione Jean Granger |  | Ronald Bilius \"Ron\" Weasley |  | Ginevra Molly \"Ginny\" Weasley |  | Harry James Potter |  | Dudley Dursley |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Weasley family is one of the few remaining pure blood wizarding families, though they were considered \"blood traitors\" for associating with non-pure-bloods. Moreover, they are far from rich, and are looked down upon by snobbish \"old families\" such as the Malfoys. All of the Weasleys have been sorted into Gryffindor House at Hogwarts. All of the Weasley children, except Bill and Percy who both were Head Boy, are known to have played on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, with Charlie being the captain of the team for at least one of his school years. Bill, Charlie, and Ron were also chosen as the prefect of their House. The Weasleys also all work for the Order of the Phoenix, and all are members except for Ron, Percy, and Ginny, who (as of the end of *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*) are not known to have officially been inducted into the Order. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt the evening's end, the two have a heated row, in which Hermione tells Ron he should have asked her before Krum, rather than simply hoping to secure her by default.[GoF Ch.23] Ron completely fails to get the hint and remains either in denial or oblivious to the pair's increasingly obvious feelings for each other. Ron's jealousy over Krum is mirrored by Hermione's dislike of Fleur Delacour (of the Beauxbatons Academy and a Triwizard competitor), on whom Ron has an obvious crush.[GoF Ch.22]\n\n\nIn the Second Task of the Tournament, Ron is the person selected for Harry to rescue from the depths of the Hogwarts Lake, as he is the one whom Harry would most miss. Harry successfully saves him and Ron mocks him gently for thinking that the hostages for the task were in actual danger.[GoF Ch.26]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt Christmas time, as per Triwizard Tournament tradition, Hogwarts hosts a Yule Ball. Ron and Harry panic at the prospect of having to secure dates for the event, and Ron appalls Hermione with his immature approach, particularly for failing to extend her an invitation, apparently failing until the last minute to even realise she is a girl. At the last minute, Harry saves the day by getting Parvati Patil and her sister Padma to agree to come with the duo, although Padma seems less than pleased at Ron's surly attitude and shabby dress. Ron becomes overcome with jealousy when he sees Hermione with her date: his former idol Krum. When Hermione comes over to Ron and Harry for a friendly chat, Ron loses control and accuses her of \"fraternising with the enemy\" and giving away Harry's Triwizard secrets. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInitially, Ron does not support Harry's belief that Draco Malfoy is a Death Eater, a follower of Voldemort, but is later convinced. Before leaving Hogwarts with Dumbledore to recover a Horcrux Harry arranges for Ron, Hermione, and Ginny—together with any of Dumbledore's Army they can summon—to keep a close watch on Malfoy and Snape. Harry also provides them with the remains of his vial of Felix Felicis, to aid them in the effort.[HBP Ch.25] Despite the D.A.'s watch, Malfoy provides the Death Eaters entrance into Hogwarts, and a battle ensues. Thanks to Felix Felicis, Ron, Hermione and Ginny are unharmed by the Death Eater's hexes during the battle.[HBP Ch.29] Snape kills Dumbledore during the battle when Malfoy proves that he is unable to.[HBP Ch.27] During his funeral, Ron comforts a weeping Hermione. Ron and Hermione vow to help Harry find and destroy the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort, even if it means leaving Hogwarts.[HBP Ch.30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRon is given his brother Charlie's old, chipped wand, which is made out of ash and has a unicorn hair sticking out of the end. He holds the wand together with Spellotape after nearly breaking it in half at the start of *Chamber of Secrets*, but it malfunctions dreadfully after this, backfiring spells, making strange noises, and emitting objects from the wrong end. Ron's new wand is fourteen inches, willow and unicorn hair, which he procures before the start of his third year at Hogwarts. Ron's talents are rarely shown, but he, like the other DA members, survives a violent encounter with adult Death Eaters in *Order of the Phoenix*, and it is implied that during the Death Eater assault in *Half-Blood Prince* he held his own quite well because he was being helped by Felix Felicis, the good luck potion. In *Deathly Hallows*, Ron loses his original wand, and takes Peter Pettigrew's wand for his own. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"Online Chat Transcript\". Bloomsbury Publishing. 31 July 2007.

This has a much more profound effect on Ron than it seems to have on Hermione or Harry. Ron ends up lashing out in frustration at the lack of comforts and a concrete plan, eventually leaving his friends behind. Distressed over his absence, Harry and Hermione do not even mention his name during the time that he is gone. However, when they finally mention his name, Ron, who had immediately regretted his decision to leave but was captured by Snatchers and then could not return due to Hermione's anti-Death Eater enchantments, was led to Harry's location by unknown magic within the Deluminator he inherited from Dumbledore. Ron dramatically returns by saving Harry from drowning when Harry is attempting to recover Godric Gryffindor's sword from an icy pool. Harry, a sudden believer in the fate created by his return, immediately forgives Ron and insists it must be Ron who uses the sword to destroy Slytherin's locket. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, this leads to a major row between Ron and Hermione: Hermione accuses Harry of helping Ron cheat, while Ron berates Hermione for having no faith in his abilities.[HBP Ch.14] At a post-game celebration, Ron kisses Lavender (though Ginny describes it as \"eating her face\"). Hermione, jealous and seeking retaliation, takes McLaggen as her date to new Potions professor Horace Slughorn's Christmas party, but he proves to be an egomaniac.[HBP Ch.15] After Christmas, Hermione continues to ignore Ron, stopping only to give him disdainful looks and occasional snide remarks. By now, Ron is visibly discontent with his relationship with Lavender.[HBP Ch.17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Fraser, Lindsay (2001). *Conversations with J. K. Rowling*.

The trio and some other prisoners are rescued by Dobby, but the house-elf is killed by Bellatrix during the escape. Eventually, the trio returns to Hogwarts, hoping to find the last unknown Horcrux shown in Harry's vision. Having lost the Sword of Gryffindor to Griphook the goblin, Ron gets an idea to procure more Basilisk fangs and manages to speak enough Parseltongue to open the Chamber of Secrets, where Hermione destroys the Horcrux in Helga Hufflepuff's cup. He begins to worry about the fate of Hogwarts' elves. Upon hearing this, Hermione drops the basilisk fangs she was carrying and kisses him for the first time. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_gPMeEXvRLR1rJqHrFHeOzZqr","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Philip Nel believes that *Malfoy* is derived from the French phrase *mal foi*, meaning \"bad faith\".[4]\nIn an article published in 2002, Nilsen and Nilsen argue that \"Draco\" has connotations with *draconian*, and that his name starts with \"mal\", a French prefix for \"bad\" or \"evil\".[5]\n\n\nMany of Draco's relatives on his mother's side of the family (the Blacks) are named for stars or constellations (e.g., Sirius Black, Regulus Black, Andromeda Black Tonks, Bellatrix Black Lestrange, Cygnus Black, Orion Black). Another constellation is Draco (the Dragon). Draco Malfoy eventually named his son for yet another constellation, Scorpius.[6]\n\n\n\n## Appearances[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Draco Lucius Malfoy** is a fictional character and a major antagonist in J. K. Rowling's *Harry Potter* series. He is a student in Harry Potter's year belonging in the Slytherin house. He is frequently accompanied by his two cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, who act as henchmen. Draco is characterised as a cowardly bully who tricks and hurts people to get what he wants; he is also a cunning user of magic. He was played by Tom Felton in the *Harry Potter* film series.\n\n\n\n\n## Character development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Draco Malfoy on Harry Potter Wiki, an external wiki\n* Draco Malfoy at the Harry Potter Lexicon\n* Mugglenet: Role in the Books\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Harry Potter* by J.

Draco's hairline has receded, making his face look even more pointed. Though they are not friends, Malfoy has somewhat decreased his animosity toward Harry, and, upon seeing them at King's Cross station, gives a brief and curt nod to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny.[8]\n\n\n\n## Appearance in other material[edit]\n\n\nIn the play *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, Draco appears with his son Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy, who became best friends with Harry's second son Albus Severus Potter. It was revealed that during the fourth year of Scorpius's time in Hogwarts that Draco became widowed, as his wife Astoria Malfoy (nee Greengrass) died due to an inherited blood curse, which could shorten her lifespan and disallow her from growing into old age.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **Malfoy family** is one of the few remaining pure-blood wizarding clans in the *Harry Potter* series, and among the wealthiest. The anti-Muggle editor Brutus Malfoy is their ancestor. Lucius Malfoy was a Death Eater during both wizard wars. He marries Narcissa Black and together they have one son, Draco, who is the first Malfoy family member introduced in the series. The Malfoys are related to the Black family through Narcissa (a first cousin of Sirius Black, Harry's godfather), which makes Draco a nephew of both Bellatrix Lestrange and Andromeda Tonks. Draco is also Nymphadora Tonks' first cousin through their mothers. Three of Draco's grandparents are identified: Abraxas Malfoy, Cygnus Black, and Druella Rosier. Abraxas died before the series begins and was a friend of Professor Slughorn. Draco is, therefore, the scion of two old magical families. The Malfoy home, Malfoy Manor, is an elegant mansion located in the western English county of Wiltshire. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Draco and the Malfoys during a performance at Los Angeles Public Library in July, 2006.\nWizard-rock band Draco and the Malfoys' lyrics are inspired by the *Harry Potter* books but from Draco Malfoy's point of view.[22] As well as Harry and the Potters, the members of Draco and the Malfoys dress themselves as Hogwarts students, in this case in Slytherin-themed costumes. The band is one of about 750 bands of young musicians playing music inspired by the *Harry Potter* series.[22][23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDraco Malfoy makes his first appearance in the series when he and Harry meet while being fitted for school robes at Madam Malkin's, a clothing shop in Diagon Alley. Not realising that the boy in the store is Harry Potter—a child whose parents were murdered when he was one year old by the powerful dark wizard Lord Voldemort—Draco engages him in (for him) polite conversation. Harry, however, is alienated by the arrogance of Draco, who asks whether the orphan's parents are \"our kind\" (pure-blood wizards). Draco then proclaims that \"the other sort\" (Muggle-borns) should not be allowed at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, because \"they've never been brought up to know our ways\". The two boys part without introductions, but meet again on the Hogwarts Express. After Draco ridicules Ron Weasley's family, Harry rejects his offer of friendship, demonstrated by a handshake, and their mutual antagonism is born. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the series, Draco is portrayed as a cunning, competent young wizard. In his second year, he successfully performed the *Tarantallegra* curse against Harry,[15] a curse used by Death Eater Antonin Dolohov in book 5,[16] and also successfully cast the Serpensortia spell in the same scene, conjuring a serpent from his wand just as Voldemort would later do against Dumbledore in book 5,[16] and Snape against McGonagall in the final book.[17] His character further develops in the sixth book, in which he is among very few students able to reach the required level to take Advanced Potions.[18] Draco also proved capable at Occlumency, which he learned from his Aunt Bellatrix.[18] Rowling recalled a discussion with her editor about Draco having mastered Occlumency while Harry could not. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnder the Invisibility Cloak, Harry, Ron, and Hermione follow Draco to Borgin and Burkes, a dark magic shop in Knockturn Alley. Draco threatens Mr. Borgin about repairing one item and keeping another safe for him. Draco shows Mr. Borgin something on his arm that Harry believes to be the Dark Mark, Voldemort's sign, though whether or not Harry is correct is never confirmed. (In the film version Draco Malfoy shows Dumbledore the Dark Mark on his arm.) On the Hogwarts Express, Harry invisibly spies on Draco and overhears him discussing Voldemort's task with several other Slytherins. Draco knows Harry is present and, once alone in the compartment, immobilises him and breaks his nose causing Harry to hate Draco even more. Harry is left stranded on the train until Nymphadora Tonks (Luna Lovegood in the film adaptation) rescues him. Harry spends much of the year trailing Draco's whereabouts on his Marauder's Map, but loses track of him once Draco enters the Room of Requirement. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn this book, Draco is, for the first time since being introduced in the series, portrayed as having considerable initiative, ingenuity, and perseverance. However, unlike Harry, who always relies on his friends' support and help, Draco mostly works alone in the Room of Requirement, refusing to confide in or involve his own circle of friends, whom he treats more as underlings. This, and the realisation of what he is ultimately expected to do, nearly drives him to a nervous breakdown. When Harry walks in on Malfoy crying in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, Draco attempts to cast the Cruciatus Curse. Harry is faster to the draw with an obscure *Sectumsempra* spell that he learned from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince's book. The spell cuts deep gashes into Malfoy's face and chest, resulting in severe blood loss. Snape, alerted by Myrtle's screams, swiftly arrives and heals Draco's cuts, then takes him to the hospital wing.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring an interview in 2005, Rowling revealed that she enjoyed writing Draco in this book, and that the character \"did a lot of growing up\" as well.[7]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*[edit]\n\n\nThe Malfoys remain reluctant followers of Voldemort, who now uses their home as his headquarters; Draco passes out after witnessing Voldemort murder Muggle Studies professor Charity Burbage. Harry experiences occasional and disturbing visions of Draco being forced into performing Voldemort's bidding and feels \"sickened... by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort.\" When Harry, Ron, and Hermione are captured and taken to Malfoy Manor, Draco is asked to identify them, and though they are clearly recognisable, he only ambiguously replies \"It might be.\" During the successful escape from Malfoy Manor headed by Dobby, Harry overpowers Draco and captures his wand.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDraco is parodied as Jerko Phoenix in the series *Wizards of Waverly Place*, during the episodes \"Wizard School Part 1\" and \"Wizard School Part 2\", in which Alex and Justin Russo go to a wizarding school named Wiz-tech, where everyone wears yellow and black robes, and glasses reminiscent of Harry Potter.[24] Draco also appears as Sacco (played by Shane Lyons) in the *Harry Bladder* sketches in *All That*, in which Harry Bladder and other students often encounter Sacco's mischief-making. In the stage production *Harry Potter and the Obnoxious Voice*, Malfoy is seen interacting with Hagrid and a dementor.[25] Draco was also parodied in a Big Bite sketch, where he was known as Mailboy (with his father Lucius being parodied as Mailman). In Neil Cicierega's *Potter Puppet Pals*, Draco stars in the episode \"Draco Puppet\". He is different from all the other characters, simplistically made out of paper and is a smaller puppet, held and voiced by the Harry puppet. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDraco serves as a foil to the hero, Harry Potter and is loosely based on bullies Rowling encountered during her school days.[1] Harry first encounters Draco's snobbish bigotry after their initial encounter at Madam Malkin's.[2] Rowling uses the Malfoys to introduce themes of intolerance and bigotry into a setting where people are often judged solely by their blood lineage rather than their good character or accomplishments. Draco, adhering to his family's beliefs, thinks that Muggle-born witches and wizards, which he and other characters derogatorily describe by the epithet *Mudbloods*, should be denied a magical education. Harry's first impression that the Wizarding community is a \"magical wonderland\" is instantly shattered. Says Rowling, \"[Harry] found out that many people in power in the wizarding world are just as corrupt and nasty as they are in our world.\"[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Rowling, J. K.

Fry also noted that while \"Malfoy, Goyle and Crabbe are almost irredeemably bad\", Malfoy, unlike his companions, \"is reasonably stylish\".[2] IGN listed Malfoy as their ninth top *Harry Potter* character.[21]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n Rowling has also noted that Malfoy \"is certainly stylish in the film.\"[2]\n\n\n### Theatre portrayal[edit]\n\n\nIn the theatre play *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child* Draco was portrayed by Alex Price[12] and later by James Howard.[13] In the theatre play Draco has a style like his father's, such as his long hair. Draco was married to Astoria Greengrass, who had died, and has a son named Scorpius.[12]\n\n\n\n## Characterisation[edit]\n\n\n### Outward appearance[edit]\n\n\nDraco is described as a tall, slender boy with a pale, pointed face, sleek blond hair, and ice grey eyes.\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDraco is drawn into Death-Eaters' activities more directly in *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*. Because of Lucius' arrest and fall from Voldemort's favour, Narcissa Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange visit Snape at his home to discuss a dangerous task that Voldemort has assigned Draco. Narcissa, deeply worried that her son will be killed in his attempt to complete it, begs Snape to make an Unbreakable Vow to aid Draco with this task and protect him at all costs, and if Draco fails to complete the mission, he will complete it himself; he agrees.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Bradley, Laura (2 June 2016). \"Here's What Draco Malfoy and His Son Will Look Like in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\". *Vanity Fair*.

He also insults Hermione Granger's Muggle-born status by referring to her as a \"Mudblood\", a term that, as stated by Hagrid, is one not used in civilised conversations. As Rowling explained in 1999, \"He's a bigot and he's a bully, and as I say, in the most refined sense, he knows exactly what will hurt people\".[1]\n\n\nIn a July 2005 interview, Rowling added that Draco, unlike Harry, never feels remorse for his actions: \"I thought of Draco as someone who is very capable of compartmentalising his life and his emotions, and always has done. So he's shut down his pity, enabling him to bully effectively. He's shut down compassion— how else would you become a Death Eater?\"[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHarry created him in order to torture him, and after the puppet \"annoys\" Harry, he does a series of strange things to the paper Draco and eventually burns it on a stove. In *A Very Potter Musical* Draco is played by actress Lauren Lopez. He has a very obvious crush on Hermione and spends a great deal of time posing and rolling around on the floor.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, Draco is named a Slytherin prefect along with Pansy Parkinson. He gets Harry and the Weasley twins banned from the Gryffindor Quidditch team when they attack him during a postmatch brawl after Draco insults their families following Gryffindor's win over Slytherin. He later joins Dolores Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad, with whom he plays an important part in the exposure of Dumbledore's Army. As the D.A. flees the Room of Requirement, Draco earns Slytherin fifty points after catching Harry, and helps hold several members captive in Umbridge's office, letting them free only after Ginny Weasley performs her famous Bat Bogey Hex. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite having lost the favour of his parents, he still inherits the massive fortune of the Malfoy family, which made him independently wealthy and having no need to work. The inheritance also included his father's collection of Dark Arts artefacts.\n\n\nAfter he was married, Draco initially contemplated letting the Malfoy bloodline end with him to allow Astoria to live longer (much to Lucius's disappointment), as he was aware of Astoria's family blood curse and that childbirth would weaken her further. Astoria, however, persuaded him from doing so as she wanted a child not for the pure-blood beliefs, but for him so that he will not be alone should she died some day, which culminated in the birth of Draco's first and only child Scorpius. Draco had once considered the birth of his son as the greatest day of his life, even though Scorpius's birth had led to Astoria's health to be further weakened and eventually caused her to die fourteen years later.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to Rowling, Malfoy originally makes an effort to be Harry's friend because \"it will be cool to turn up at the school being Harry Potter's friend, because Harry is so famous.\"[1] However, Harry did not want Malfoy as a friend because he \"has been so rude about Rubeus Hagrid and about Ron, who Harry likes so much\". At the first years' Sorting Ceremony, the Sorting Hat places him into Slytherin (barely touching Draco's head), the house that has developed all of the bad wizards, where he becomes an instant favourite of Potions teacher and Slytherin Head of House, Severus Snape, so-called follower of Lord Voldemort. Draco attempts to get Harry expelled by tricking him into participating in a midnight wizard's duel after secretly informing Argus Filch in advance, but the plan fails when Harry evades Filch and safely makes it back to his dormitory.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFelton contributed to premieres, articles and interviews, and received the Disney Channel's Kids Awards for Best DVD *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* on 22 September 2003 with Hermione Granger actress, Emma Watson.[11] He also won the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain for his portrayal as Malfoy in the 2010 MTV Movie Awards and the 2011 MTV Movie Awards.\n\n\n\nMalfoy grew into one of the series' most popular characters due to Felton's performances and Felton quickly became synonymous with the character to many female fans, much to Rowling's dismay. \n\n\n> \"I'm trying to clearly distinguish between Tom Felton, who is a good looking young boy, and Draco, who, whatever he looks like, is not a nice man. It’s a romantic, but unhealthy, and unfortunately all too common delusion of girls ... it actually worried me a little bit, to see young girls swearing undying devotion to this really imperfect character ... I mean, I understand the psychology of it, but it is pretty unhealthy.\"[7]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThese feelings only began to dissipate gradually as they became united by their common interest to save their sons. He was also revealed to be constantly envious of how Harry had true friends like Ron and Hermione (the latter whom became Minister of Magic) during his schooling years while he had only Crabbe and Goyle, who did not amount to being true friends for Draco.\n\n\nDuring the events of the play, Draco slowly made amends with Harry and his friends as they all embarked on a journey to save their sons from Voldemort's daughter Delphini, demonstrating his slow, but gradual acknowledgement of Harry as a friend and his outright denouncement of his Death Eater past.[9]\n\n\n\n## Portrayal[edit]\n\n\n### Film portrayal[edit]\n\n\nTom Felton played Draco Malfoy in all of the *Harry Potter* films. Prior to landing the part of Malfoy, Felton auditioned to play Harry and Ron.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Harry is unexpectedly chosen as a Triwizard Tournament champion in *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*, Draco shows off a \"Support Cedric Diggory\" badge to Harry, then presses it to replace that phrase with \"Potter Stinks.\" Draco also gives malicious and often false information about Harry and Hagrid to muckraking *Daily Prophet* journalist Rita Skeeter. When Draco attempts to curse Harry behind his back, the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Alastor Moody (actually Barty Crouch, Jr in disguise via Polyjuice Potion) humiliates Draco by transforming him into a ferret and repeatedly slamming him against the ground as well as dropping him down Goyle's pants.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Harry Potter Character Names Derived From Astronomy\".

After Draco disarms him, Dumbledore calmly reasons with the frightened teenager and persuades him to reveal how he was, according to Voldemort's orders, to kill the headmaster through the cursed necklace and the poisoned mead. Malfoy reveals that he mended the broken Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement to act as a portal enabling Death Eaters to enter Hogwarts. Draco is hesitant to kill Dumbledore and he eventually lowers his wand. Snape arrives, dispatches Dumbledore himself and then flees Hogwarts with Draco in tow. As revealed during his confrontation with Dumbledore, Draco was an insecure boy incapable of committing cold-blooded murder and was forced to do Voldemort's bidding under the threat of his and his parents' deaths. Harry, who was horrified by the result of his duel with Draco in the bathroom incident, feels \"the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike\" for his old rival.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen Harry, Ron, and Hermione seek Ravenclaw's diadem in the Room of Requirement, Draco, along with Crabbe and Goyle (Blaise Zabini in film version rather than Crabbe), attempts to capture Harry alive. However, Crabbe (Goyle in film version) defies Draco's orders and attempts to kill the trio by casting the deadly Fiendfyre; unable to control the spell, he dies in the blaze while the trio rescue Draco and Goyle (Zabini in film version). Draco, despite his often condescending and belittling attitude toward Crabbe and Goyle (as well as his other underlings), grieves for his lost friend. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Draco is seen pleading with a Death Eater who seems intent on killing him. He is once again saved by Harry and Ron, the latter of whom punches Draco in the face under the invisibility cloak for attempting to appease the Death Eater.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, Draco becomes the new Seeker for the Slytherin Quidditch team after his father, Lucius Malfoy, donates new, high-quality Nimbus 2001 broomsticks. When Hermione Granger comments that the Gryffindor players made the team through talent and not bribery, Draco responds by calling her a Mudblood. This provokes an immediate, violent response from Ron Weasley. Because of Draco's contempt for Muggle-borns, Harry, Ron, and Hermione suspect that Draco is the Heir of Slytherin, who has recently reopened the Chamber of Secrets. Harry and Ron disguise themselves as Crabbe and Goyle with Polyjuice Potion and infiltrate the Slytherin common room in an attempt to collect additional information, whereupon they realise that their initial suspicion about Draco is incorrect.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe play also explores some of Draco's later life after the second wizarding war and prior to the events of the play. Due to the harrowing experiences he had during his time with the Death Eaters and his remorse over his criminal acts as a Death Eater, Draco had realised the error in his ways and thus abandoned the old pure-blood beliefs he was raised to adopt and believe in. This notably caused friction between him and his parents (who maintained these beliefs despite having defected from Voldemort). As he slowly grew into adulthood, Draco fell in love with a fellow Slytherin Astoria Greengrass, who also witnessed the carnage and horrors which the war and the old beliefs brought about (though lesser than Draco). This romance and eventual marriage would disappoint Draco's parents further given that they expected a more suitable candidate from one of the wizarding world's oldest pure-blood families and also an individual who had the embodiment of the old pure-blood beliefs. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Harry is struck by the *Avada Kedavra* curse, Voldemort orders Narcissa to verify that Harry is actually dead. She detects his heartbeat, but she lies to Voldemort, knowing that she will be allowed to search for her son if the Death Eaters return to Hogwarts *\"as part of the conquering army.\"* Although Draco does not directly take part in Harry's final confrontation with Voldemort, as he and his parents flee the battle for their personal safety, he influences its outcome; a plot twist reveals that Draco had unwittingly become the Elder Wand's master when he disarmed Dumbledore, even though Draco never actually possessed the wand. The wand's allegiance passes to whoever defeats its owner, so Harry, having taken Draco's wand at Malfoy Manor, became its new master; this prevents Voldemort from using its full power. In the end, it is Narcissa's lie to Voldemort concerning Harry's death that enables the Malfoys to narrowly avoid imprisonment in Azkaban.[8]\n\n\n\n#### Epilogue[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThey were served by Dobby the house elf until the end of *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*.\n\n\nThe Malfoys are a wealthy landed gentry family respected in the Wizarding world mainly from Lucius' influence with Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic, gained mostly from his monetary donations to the Ministry and St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, as well as from his post on the Hogwarts board of governors as chairman. However, he was removed from his position at the conclusion of the second book and imprisoned in Azkaban following the battle at the Department of Mysteries in *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*. Despite maintaining a respectable, but false, image before these events, some in the Wizarding world were previously aware that the Malfoys were devoted to Voldemort and the Dark Arts. Draco constantly uses his elite status and his father's name and influence to gain advantages and to threaten others. Lucius is also known to have used bribery and threats.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDraco, as well as Dudley Dursley, was indoctrinated with his parents' beliefs. Rowling commented that \"The moment Draco got what he thought he wanted, to become a Death Eater, and given a mission by Lord Voldemort, as he did in *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, reality finally hit him\" because his dream was \"so very different\". Rowling also stated that there was a real moral cowardice in Draco, but that he was not wholly bad.[14]\n\n\nHaving gone through the horrors of the second wizarding war as a Death Eater, Draco abandoned the pure-blood beliefs he was originally devoted to, and grew to become a better person than he was in his youth, growing more tolerant and accepting of the non-pure-bloods of the wizarding world. He also made sure to discipline his son Scorpius to be a better child than he himself was in his youth, which made Scorpius to show kindness and become friends with Harry's son Albus Severus, as evidence of his reformation.[9]\n\n\n\n### Magical abilities and skills[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs a father, Draco was strict in Scorpius's upbringing and taught him to not believe in the old pure-blood beliefs and instead raised him to become a better child than Draco was in his own childhood, and was willing to allow his son to be punished for breaking the school rules. He was also supportive of Scorpius's decision to befriend Harry's son Albus Severus, even though he and Harry had a history of animosity during their schooling years. Draco even trusted Albus to help Scorpius to heal him of his pain over losing his mother, and he valued his son's friendship to the point that he personally went to the Potter house to confront Harry, who tried to separate the two best friends apart. Despite having become more civil with his old enemies from the past, Draco remained apathetic and full of mockery towards them, including how he continued to mock Harry and his friends and sending a cold reply letter to Ginny's request to invite Scorpius to stay in the Potter house. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt about this time, it is revealed through the Pensieve that Dumbledore had known he was dying after being cursed by Voldemort's ring. However, to spare Draco's soul from being forever tainted by committing murder, Dumbledore pre-arranged his own death with Snape. Voldemort intended Draco to die in the attempt to kill Dumbledore so that Lucius would be punished for his failure to retrieve the prophecy from the Ministry of Magic.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter his father and other Death Eaters are captured and sentenced to Azkaban following the events at the Department of Mysteries, Draco twice attempts to get revenge on Harry, but Snape and Minerva McGonagall thwart his first effort, and while returning home on the Hogwarts Express, Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle are transformed into giant slugs by a barrage of hexes cast by several D.A. members coming to Harry's defence.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring Hagrid's debut as Care of Magical Creatures instructor in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, the hippogriff, Buckbeak, attacks Draco after he fails to observe proper protocol while approaching it and insults it. He exaggerates the extent of his injury, giving Slytherin a chance to postpone their Quidditch match against Gryffindor until later in the year and as an attempt to have Hagrid fired. Hermione punches Draco when he mocks Hagrid for crying over Buckbeak's death sentence. Draco, who implies that he is aware of how Sirius Black was supposedly involved in the deaths of Harry's parents, also taunts Harry about the impending threat of Black: *\"If it was me, I'd want revenge. I'd hunt him down myself.\"*\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Harry Potter*(cast · music) | * *The Philosopher's Stone*\n\t+ soundtrack, \"Hedwig's Theme\"\n* *The Chamber of Secrets*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Prisoner of Azkaban*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Goblet of Fire*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Order of the Phoenix*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Half-Blood Prince*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Deathly Hallows – Part 1*\n\t+ production\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Deathly Hallows – Part 2*\n\t+ production\n\t+ soundtrack\n\t+ accolades\n |\n| *Fantastic Beasts*(cast · characters) | * *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Crimes of Grindelwald*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Secrets of Dumbledore*\n |\n\n |\n| Characters | * Harry Potter\n* Ron Weasley\n* Hermione Granger\n* Lord Voldemort\n* Albus Dumbledore\n* Severus Snape\n* Rubeus Hagrid\n* Minerva McGonagall\n* Draco Malfoy\n* Neville Longbottom\n* Ginny Weasley\n* Fred and George Weasley\n* Sirius Black\n* Remus Lupin\n* Cedric Diggory\n* Bellatrix Lestrange\n* Dolores Umbridge\n* Luna Lovegood\n* Supporting characters\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_nbxoXtkx8p1b19L8Hv4ZKxRX","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

K. Rowling. He is introduced in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* as a half-giant and half-human who is the gamekeeper and Keeper of Keys and Grounds of Hogwarts, the primary setting for the first six novels. In the third novel *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, Hagrid is promoted to Care of Magical Creatures professor, and is later revealed to be a member of the Order of the Phoenix. A loyal, friendly, softhearted personality who is easily brought to tears, he is also known for his thick West Country accent.\n\n\nHagrid was portrayed by Robbie Coltrane in all eight *Harry Potter* films, from *Philosopher's Stone* in 2001 to *Deathly Hallows – Part 2* in 2011.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Character development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHagrid was among the characters that Rowling says she created on \"the very first day\".[2] She has explained the source of his name as \"another old English word, meaning – if you were hagrid – it’s a dialect word – you’d had a bad night. Hagrid is a big drinker – he has a lot of bad nights.\"[3] His first name, Rubeus, was named after red in Latin to reflect alchemy and his paternal contrast to Albus Dumbledore: his \"passion\" to Dumbledore's \"asceticism\".[4] In her article \"Harry’s Fame\", Rosemary Goring notes the Forest of Dean is an influence on Rowling’s work, and Hagrid is the only character that is \"directly drawn from the Forest of Dean\".

Following the death of James and Lily Potter, Dumbledore entrusts Hagrid with rescuing the infant Harry from his parents' house after they have been murdered by Lord Voldemort. When Minerva McGonagall expresses her concern about the fact that it was Hagrid who would carry Harry to the Dursleys', Dumbledore says that he would trust Hagrid with his life, a fact that is demonstrated several times during the series, as Dumbledore frequently asks him to carry out secret tasks. Ten years later, he is tasked to bring the Philosopher’s Stone from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and provides the three-headed dog Fluffy to guard it. Dumbledore also gives him the task of locating Harry, helping him to find his bearings in the wizarding world and to buy his school things. Hagrid is the first member of the Hogwarts staff to be introduced to Harry before he began attending the school. Hagrid later becomes friends with Ron and Hermione as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** Jaquish, Jeannette. \"Harry Potter and the Obnoxious Voice\". *Angelfire*.\n\n## Further reading[edit]\n\n\n* Hugosson, Annika (2021). \"The \"Care\" of Magical Creatures?

He takes him into the wizarding world ... He was sort of his guardian and his guide ... And now I wanted Hagrid to be the one to lead Harry out of the forest.\"[9] Rowling also commented that Hagrid was never in danger of dying, as she \"always had that picture in my head of the huge gigantic Hagrid walking through the forest crying with Harry in his arms\".[10]\n\n\n\n#### Epilogue[edit]\n\n\nNineteen years after Voldemort’s defeat, Hagrid is still at Hogwarts and invites Harry and Ginny Weasley's second son Albus Severus Potter to his hut for tea, just as he had once done for Harry himself, implying that he and Harry are still close. During an interview in 2007, when asked if Hagrid did marry, Rowling answered that Hagrid developed a relationship with a giantess but it did not work out.[11]\n\n\n\n## Film portrayal[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the fourth novel it is revealed that Hagrid is of mixed wizard and giant parentage, his mother having been the giantess Fridwulfa, who left his wizard father when Hagrid was a baby. Since giants have a reputation for being brutal, and were once allies of Voldemort, Hagrid keeps his parentage a secret and allows people to imagine other reasons for his great size (such as drinking a bottle of Skele-Gro when he did not need it). Hagrid’s parentage is exposed in the *Daily Prophet* by Rita Skeeter, who portrays him as dangerous (because of his fascination for aggressive creatures) and incompetent. Hagrid is gravely affected by this and attempts to resign from his post as teacher, though Dumbledore does not accept his resignation. During the novel, Hagrid develops a romantic interest with Olympe Maxime – another half-giant witch and Headmistress of the French magic school Beauxbatons. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Actors and actresses in the Harry Potter movies\". *IMDb*.

Later in the book, Barty Crouch Jr (disguised as Alastor Moody) suggests Hagrid should show Harry that the first task of the Tournament would involve dragons. Hagrid also provides Blast-Ended Skrewts for the third task.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the seventh novel, Hagrid is part of the Order of the Phoenix delegation assigned to remove Harry from the Dursleys' home to the magic-protected Burrow. Hagrid takes Harry on the flying motorcycle he inherited from Sirius but the plan goes awry when the Order delegation is ambushed by Death Eaters. The pair narrowly make it to the Burrow after being attacked by Voldemort himself. After attending Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding reception, Hagrid does not appear again until near the end of the book when it is revealed he has been driven into hiding in the mountains by the new Death Eater regime at Hogwarts.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** Linder, Brian; Pirrello, Phil; Goldman, Eric; Fowler, Matt (14 July 2009). \"Top 25 Harry Potter Characters\". *IGN*.

For example, in *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, many of the stunning spells thrown at him by Ministry officials simply bounce off him. Also, being half-giant gives Hagrid some level of superhuman strength, which allowed him to bend the barrel of a shotgun with one hand.\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\n### Grawp[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHagrid has appeared in various animated and non-animated parodies of Harry Potter. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn *the Goblet of Fire*, the truth about Hagrid’s parents is revealed: his father, who is never named in the stories, married a giantess, Fridwulfa. Fridwulfa left Rubeus to his father’s care after his birth; according to Hagrid, she was not very maternal. Later she gave birth to Grawp. She died long before Hagrid returned to the giants in *the Order of the Phoenix*. Hagrid describes his father as \"a tiny little man\" whom he could pick up with one hand and place on the dresser at the age of six. Hagrid clearly felt great affection for him; in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, he says that his father’s death when Hagrid was in third year at Hogwarts was one of his saddest memories.\n\n\n\n## Hagrid's pets[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nRobbie Coltrane portrayed Hagrid in all eight films. Right: Hagrid costume at the Warner Bros. Studio Tour London\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe has a friendly, softhearted personality and is easily driven to tears, as seen in his very first scene, when he drops Harry off at the Dursleys' in *Philosopher’s Stone*. He is very loyal to his peers, especially Dumbledore, to whom he refers as the greatest wizard in the world multiple times. As first seen in *Philosopher’s Stone*, he becomes extremely angry whenever anyone insults Dumbledore around him (a mistake made by Vernon Dursley, who called Dumbledore a \"crackpot old fool\"). He is also very loyal to Harry, suffered several times during the series because of this loyalty, and had to go into hiding twice to avoid prison. Rowling says of Hagrid, \"Hagrid was always supposed to be this almost elemental force. He’s like the king of the forest, or the Green Man. He’s this semi-wild person who lives on the edge of the forest\".[23]\n\n\n\n### Magical abilities and skills[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nReaders first discover why Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts in the second novel. It is revealed that Hagrid was a student at Hogwarts at the same time as Tom Marvolo Riddle, the wizard who later became Lord Voldemort. Hagrid was expelled during his third year, after being caught in the company of Aragog, a dangerous acromantula: this already serious crime seemed worse than it was, due to the belief that the acromantula was “The Monster of Slytherin”, and that Hagrid had released it from the Chamber of Secrets and allowed it to attack students. Aragog escapes into the dark forest and starts a colony of spiders. The belief of Hagrid's guilt was encouraged by Tom Riddle, the actual criminal, who had been using the true monster (a basilisk) to attack students, and who had framed Hagrid to prevent the school from being closed, because he didn't want to return to the orphanage whence he had come. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nScottish actor Robbie Coltrane has portrayed Hagrid in all of the film adaptations of the *Harry Potter* novels.[12] Robin Williams was interested for the role and approached Chris Columbus, the director of the first two films, about participating in the project but Columbus rejected him due to the \"all-British and Irish cast\" policy.[13][14] Rowling had wanted Coltrane for the role from the start,[13] responding \"RobbieColtraneforHagrid\" all in one quick breath when asked who was the top of her list of casting choices.[15][16] Coltrane was already a fan of the books[17] and has commented that being part of the *Harry Potter* franchise was \"a fantastic thing\".[18] Rowling discussed Hagrid's past and future with Coltrane, assisting him in preparing for the role.[17][19] She also stated that \"Robbie is just perfect for Hagrid because Hagrid is a very loveable character, quite likeable, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRowling has stated in an interview that Hagrid was in Gryffindor house during his time as a student.[6] When he comes into possession of an acromantula, he is expelled from Hogwarts as his pet is believed to be the \"monster of Slytherin\". However, persuaded by Dumbledore (who at the time was Transfiguration teacher), Headmaster Armando Dippet agrees to train Hagrid as gamekeeper, allowing the boy to remain at Hogwarts. By the time Harry attends Hogwarts, Hagrid is also the Keeper of Keys and Grounds: the former, according to Rowling, means \"that he will let you in and out of Hogwarts.\"[7] Part of his job includes leading the first years across the lake in boats, upon their initial arrival at Hogwarts.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIGN listed Hagrid as their thirteenth top *Harry Potter* character, saying that Hagrid had become a surrogate for the audience and that the short scene in the *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* film where he recollects memorable moments with Harry, Hermione and Ron gave them a \"cherished memory\".[33] IGN’s Joe Utichi also listed Hagrid as his 7th favourite *Harry Potter* character.[34]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Brown, Jen (30 July 2007). \"Rowling: 'I wanted to kill parents'\". *Today.com*.

He is also allowed to perform magic again since his name has been cleared after the events of the previous book.[*citation needed*] During his first class, in which he introduces the hippogriffs to third-years, one of the beasts, Buckbeak, attacks Draco Malfoy after the boy insults it. Although Dumbledore manages to prove that Hagrid is innocent, the Ministry of Magic sentences Buckbeak to death. Thus, Hagrid's classes become extremely boring, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione spend some time looking for information that would help Hagrid in Buckbeak’s defence. Near the end of the book Hermione and Harry use a time-turner to save Buckbeak from death and Sirius Black from the Dementor's Kiss.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn *Philosopher’s Stone*, Hagrid is mentioned as being twice as tall as the average man and nearly five times as wide but in the film, he is portrayed as being 8 ft 6 in (2.59 m) and in later books he is said to be three times as wide.[*citation needed*] Hagrid is known for his thick West Country accent. Being a half-giant, he is less vulnerable to jinxes and spells than full-humans. In *Order of the Phoenix*, when Umbridge and some other wizards come to remove him from Hogwarts he fights back. They try to jinx and stun him, but the spells just bounce off him because of giant-inherited resistance to magic. Hagrid also shows this resilience at the end of *Half-Blood Prince*, during the chapter *Flight of the Prince*, withstanding a Death Eater’s powerful curses. Some potions are also ineffective with him, such as Polyjuice Potion, which is designed for human-only use.[22]\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** Dickerson, Darby (28 February 2008). \"Professor Dumbledore's Advice for Law Deans\". *University of Toledo Law Review*. **39** (1): 269–296.

The three also assist Hagrid after the dragon egg hatches, by helping to remove the baby dragon Norbert, who is taken to live in a dragon sanctuary in Romania where Ron’s older brother, Charlie Weasley, works.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the sixth novel, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are no longer students of Care of Magical Creatures, and Hagrid is both angry and disappointed with them during the first part of the book, but he soon realises that it is not because they do not like him. Later in the novel, Aragog dies, and Hagrid risks his life to recover the Acromantula's body to give it a proper funeral. After the funeral, he and Horace Slughorn drink excessive amounts of Firewhisky, and Harry takes advantage of this situation (under the influence of Felix Felicis potion, otherwise known as \"liquid luck\") to retrieve a certain memory from Slughorn. Towards the end of the book, Death Eaters attack Hogwarts and Hagrid's hut is set on fire as he tries to fight them.

Hagrid raised Aragog from an egg as a Hogwarts student, keeping him inside a cupboard. In his third year at Hogwarts, Hagrid was caught talking to Aragog in the dungeons by Tom Riddle, who alleged that Aragog was the \"Monster of Slytherin\", and that Hagrid had opened the Chamber of Secrets. In fact, it was Riddle who had opened the Chamber, and the monster was actually a basilisk.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHigh Inquisitor of Hogwarts Dolores Umbridge supervises the classes of all the members of the Hogwarts staff, including Hagrid's, and she looks for an excuse to fire him, as Hagrid is close to Dumbledore and part giant, Umbridge being highly prejudiced against non-humans.

Finally, with Dumbledore’s post as Headmaster restored, Hagrid returns to Hogwarts.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe character of Hagrid and conversations between him, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger in his hut are expository through the series, due to the fact that the trio frequently discover things about Albus Dumbledore and Hogwarts by talking with Hagrid, as he has a habit of letting slip bits of information that were specifically confided to him. He was also one of the first characters to imply that the idea of thinking of wizards as \"pure-bloods\" and \"half-bloods\" is a dated concept.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Egg containing Norbert in Hagrid's hut at the Harry Potter Exhibition in Paris\n**Norbert** is a Norwegian Ridgeback dragon that Hagrid had acquired as an egg from a mysterious, hooded stranger in the Hog's Head, who turned out to be Professor Quirrell. Hagrid helps the dragon hatch from the egg. Norbert becomes very dangerous and much bigger in the weeks following. Norbert bit Ron’s hand, causing him to require medical treatment due to the venom in her fangs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione finally persuade Hagrid to send the dragon to Ron’s older brother Charlie, who is studying dragons in Romania. In *the Deathly Hallows*, Charlie reveals to Hagrid that \"Norbert\" is actually female and had been renamed *Norberta*. Charlie adds that female Norwegian Ridgeback dragons \"are more vicious...\" which explained Norbert's biting and dangerous behaviour as a baby.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn *Philosopher's Stone*, Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville accidentally run into Fluffy whilst hiding from Peeves, who was attempting to give them away to caretaker Argus Filch, who was searching for them. On Halloween, Harry and Ron witness Snape entering the door to Fluffy's chamber, and for the next few days having a pronounced limp. Harry also overhears him saying \"How are you meant to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?\" to Filch. However, it is later revealed that he followed then Hogwarts Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Quirinus Quirrell into the chamber. While Fluffy is guarding the Philosopher's Stone, Professor Quirrell penetrates Fluffy's defences by playing a harp, in order to access the trapdoor, while Harry uses a flute that Hagrid had given to him.\n\n\nJ. K.

However, before being arrested, Hagrid tells Harry and Ron to \"follow the spiders\", so that they can meet Aragog and discover the identity of the true monster. After Harry defeats the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets and uncovers the truth, Hagrid is freed from prison.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the climactic battle, Hagrid attempts to come to the defence of Aragog's carnivorous children, who have been driven out of the Forbidden Forest by the Death Eaters and are now attacking both Hogwarts defenders and Death Eaters indiscriminately, but he is carried off by a swarm of them. He later turns up, captive in the Death Eaters' camp, when Harry sacrifices himself to Voldemort. Hagrid is forced to carry Harry back to the school, not realising that Harry has survived again, and en route accuses the watching Centaurs of not doing enough to help. The Centaurs soon afterward join the fray and Hagrid takes part in the second half of the battle, felling his main nemesis among the Death Eaters, the magical-creature executioner Walden Macnair.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAragog’s children returned in *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* during the Battle at Hogwarts; having been driven from the forest, they began attacking Death Eaters and Hogwarts' inhabitants indiscriminately. Hagrid’s love of the spiders endangered him and others because he tried to protect them; the spiders thanked Hagrid by capturing him and taking him to Voldemort. It is unknown what happens to them afterwards.\n\n\nAragog was voiced by Julian Glover in the film adaptation of *the Chamber of Secrets*. In 2017, in celebration of the 20th anniversary of \"Harry Potter\" franchise, arachnologists Anton A. Nadolny and Alireza Zamani named a new species of Iranian wolf spiders (Lycosidae) after Aragog, as *Lycosa aragogi*.

The character later reveals to Harry, Ron and Hermione that he and Madame Maxime travelled across Europe together on a mission from the Order, planning to find giants and convince them to ally themselves with the good side and with Dumbledore; however, Death Eaters also found the giants and managed to get them to Voldemort’s side. Hagrid is attacked by giants during the mission, and saved by Maxime. Hagrid and Maxime eventually part on the journey home because of Maxime’s exasperation with Grawp, Hagrid’s half-brother whom he had found and was attempting to bring home with them. Grawp, who wanted to stay with the giants, seriously injured Hagrid. Hagrid introduces his half-brother to Harry and Hermione, and asks them to take care of him after he leaves Hogwarts. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring most of Harry’s fourth year, Sirius and Buckbeak hide in a cave in the mountains above Hogsmeade. After this, they move to Number 12 Grimmauld Place, whereupon Buckbeak stays in Sirius' mother’s former room. When Kreacher wants to lure Sirius away briefly, he wounds Buckbeak.\n\n\nIn *Half-Blood Prince*, Harry inherits Buckbeak, and allows Hagrid to look after him again. To avoid suspicion from the Ministry of Magic, he is given the alias \"**Witherwings**\". A fiercely loyal creature, Buckbeak chases Severus Snape away from Harry by slashing his claws at the end of the book. Buckbeak also features in the Battle of Hogwarts at the end of *the Deathly Hallows* leading the Hogwarts Thestrals against Voldemort’s giants.\n\n\n\n### Fang[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_TF8QXr7mfEvTO8tbgZjPzyb8","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

In 2016, a fan film prequel, *Severus Snape and the Marauders*, was released online and Snape was played by Mick Ignis.[56]\n\n\nBefore Alan Rickman was offered the role of Severus Snape, the role was originally offered to Tim Roth,[57] who turned the role down in favour of portraying General Thade in *Planet of the Apes*.[58]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Teenage Severus Snape (Alec Hopkins) in *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*\nIn the fifth novel, *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, Snape returns to a more prominent role.

The two trade frequent snide remarks and at one point almost begin a duel. Snape taunts Sirius about the latter's not being able to take an active role in the Order's missions because of his fugitive status. Harry feels later that this taunting contributed to Sirius' willingness to take unsafe risks.[32] Back at school, Snape's allegiance to the Order has no effect on his dislike for Harry.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** Serjeant, Jill (14 July 2011). \"Snape voted greatest \"Potter\" character in MTV poll\". *Reuters*.

Snape dies at the hands of Lord Voldemort in the seventh book, at which time his back story is revealed. Despite his attraction to the Dark Arts and Voldemort's ideology of wizard supremacy, Snape's love for Muggle-born Lily Evans, Harry's mother, eventually compelled him to defect from the Death Eaters. He then became a double agent for Albus Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix. The fact that Lily chose James Potter, Harry's father, only fuels Snape's hostility towards Harry.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAll seven novels show Snape to be a very powerful wizard and to have been outstanding while a student. He specialises in potion making and has talent and passion for the Dark Arts. Sirius claimed that Snape knew more hexes and curses as a first-year student at Hogwarts than most seventh-years knew.[61] Particularly gifted in potion making, Snape added major improvements to his Potions textbook while still a student. Also as a student, Snape shows a rare gift for discovering new spells. Lupin describes Sectumsempra as Snape's \"speciality\" in *Deathly Hallows.*[62] Snape is shown using this spell as a teenager against Harry's father James[26] and in the aerial battle in the last novel when he accidentally hits George Weasley (acting as a Potter decoy) with it while actually aiming for a Death Eater who was trying to attack Lupin, permanently severing George's right ear. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn talking with Scorpius, Snape had learned that Harry would name his son \"Albus Severus\" and would regard Snape as \"probably the bravest man I ever knew\" – and is deeply moved. Though having guessed that in the other timeline he would die, Snape nevertheless willingly helps Scorpius recreate this timeline – and being discovered by Dementors, Snape sacrifices himself in order to cover Scorpius' escape.\n\n\n\n## Characterisation[edit]\n\n\n### Outward appearance[edit]\n\n\nSnape is described as a thin man with sallow skin, a large, hooked nose, and yellow, uneven teeth. He has shoulder-length, greasy black hair which frames his face, and cold, black eyes. He wears black, flowing robes which give him the appearance of \"an overgrown bat\".[59] The youthful Snape had a \"stringy, pallid look\", being \"round-shouldered yet angular\", having a \"twitchy\" walk \"that recalled a spider\" and \"long oily hair that jumped about his face\".[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSnape first appears in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, shortly after Harry arrives at Hogwarts. He is the school's Potions Master, though he is widely rumoured to covet the Defence Against the Dark Arts post.[21] Snape himself confirms the rumour in *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*.[22] Snape is a sinister and malicious teacher who makes frequent snide and disparaging remarks at Harry's expense. He quickly becomes the primary antagonist of the book, as Harry suspects him of plotting to steal the Philosopher's Stone, and of attempting to kill him. Only the climax of the book reveals that Professor Quirrell, in league with Lord Voldemort, is the real enemy; Snape, suspicious of Quirrell, had been looking out for Harry throughout the book. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSkilful in the arts of Legilimency and especially Occlumency, Snape is able to both access the minds of others and protect his own thoughts—indeed, though Snape does not care for the term himself, Harry forms the uncomfortable impression early in the series that the Potions Master is able to \"read minds.\" Being an Occlumens, Snape is able to keep his betrayal from Voldemort, who is himself described as being \"the greatest Legilimens\" in history.[34] According to Rowling, Snape is the only Death Eater capable of producing a full Patronus, which, like Lily's, is a doe.[3] Snape is a talented duellist, able to hold off by himself (if only briefly) a group of three Hogwarts professors that included former duelling champion Filius Flitwick. Professor McGonagall later implies that Snape learned to fly without the use of a broom, a rare skill previously displayed only by Voldemort.[42]\n\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, Snape demonstrates his expertise with potions by brewing the complex Wolfsbane potion for the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Remus Lupin.[25] Throughout the third book, Snape suspects that Lupin may be helping Harry's godfather Sirius Black enter Hogwarts castle; Sirius had been convicted (wrongly, as it is later revealed) of murdering Peter Pettigrew and innocent bystanders, and betraying the Potter family's hiding place to Voldemort. This suspicion stems from Lupin's friendship with Sirius and Harry's father, James, while they were all at Hogwarts as students.[26] Near the climax of the book, Snape attempts to apprehend Sirius, but Sirius escapes with Harry's aid. Snape informs Dumbledore of this circumstance, and when Harry and Lupin are not punished, Snape retaliates by revealing to the entire school that Lupin is a werewolf, forcing the latter to resign his post.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSnape is generally depicted as being cold, calculating, precise, sarcastic, and bitter. He strongly dislikes Harry and often insults him by insulting his father James. As the series progresses, it is revealed that his treatment of Harry stems from Snape's bitter rivalry with James when they were in school together. In particular, James and Sirius bullied Snape, which according to Alan Rickman caused the already lonely boy to further \"shut himself in\".[52] Rowling further described the young Snape as insecure and vulnerable: \"Given his time over again [Snape] would not have become a Death Eater, but like many insecure, vulnerable people he craved membership of something big and powerful, something impressive.[...] [He] was so blinded by his attraction to the dark side he thought [Lily] would find him impressive if he became a real Death Eater.\"[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe character of Severus Snape has appeared in various animated parodies of Harry Potter. He is a starring character in Neil Cicierega's online *Potter Puppet Pals* parodies, and has a centric episode titled *Bothering Snape*. Also, the video *The Mysterious Ticking Noise* with the chorus \"Snape, Snape, Severus Snape\" was the winner for \"Best Comedy\" of the year 2007 at YouTube; it currently has over 170 million views.[77] Snape is also parodied as Professor Santory Snapekin in Sluggy Freelance's recurring series *Torg Potter*. In the first parody, Torg mistakenly thinks Professor Snapekin is plotting to achieve ultimate power.[78]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the epilogue to *Deathly Hallows*, set nineteen years after Harry defeats Voldemort, Harry has named his second-born son Albus Severus, after Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape. As Albus is about to enter his first year at Hogwarts, he expresses concern that he will be sorted into Slytherin. Harry tells his son, \"you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them [Snape] was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.\"[45]\n\n\n\n## Appearances in other material[edit]\n\n\n### Portrayal in films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSnape's family background is mostly shown in flashbacks during the course of the last three novels. Snape was born to Eileen Prince, a witch, and Tobias Snape, a Muggle, making him a half-blood (hence the name, \"Half-Blood Prince\"). This is rare for a Death Eater, as remarked in the last book, though Voldemort himself also had a Muggle father. Snape spent his early childhood living with his parents in a small house in Spinner's End. Snape's family was a poor one and he is described as wearing ill-fitting clothes \"that were so mis-matched that it looked deliberate\". As a child, Snape was apparently neglected and his parents often fought with one another. Snape was very eager to leave his home to go to Hogwarts.[41] Towards the end of the last novel, Harry draws parallels between his childhood, Snape's, and Voldemort's.[64]\n\n\n\n### Loyalties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRowling was less forthcoming about Snape than she was for other characters, because his true loyalties and motivations were not revealed until the final book.[15] However, she hinted numerous times at Snape's important role, suggesting that people should \"keep their eye on Snape\".[4][16] In 1999, answering a question regarding Snape's love life and the redemptive pattern to his character, Rowling expressed her surprise at the foresight.[17] Rowling also disclosed that after the publication of *Prisoner of Azkaban*, there was one female fan who guessed Snape loved Lily Potter, making Rowling wonder how she had given herself away.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEnraged, he pursues Snape, Draco, and the Death Eaters as they flee the castle. Snape easily blocks Harry's spells and jeeringly points out Harry's mistakes, but never strikes back. During the confrontation, Snape reveals himself as the eponymous \"Half-Blood Prince\" (being the half-blood son of Muggle Tobias Snape and pure-blood Eileen *Prince*). Snape passes through the school gates and Disapparates with Draco in tow at the book's end.[38] The full relationship between Dumbledore and Snape and the reason for Snape's actions remain unknown until the final book. In an interview, Rowling mentioned that at this point in the series, the Harry–Snape relationship has become \"as personal, if not more so, than Harry–Voldemort.\"[39]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Abel, Katy (1999). \"Harry Potter Author Works Her Magic\". *Family Education*.

She has said that she drew inspiration for Snape's character from a disliked teacher from her own childhood,[4] and described Snape as a horrible teacher,[5] saying the \"worst, shabbiest thing you can do\" as a teacher is to bully students.[6] However, she does suggest in the books that he is generally an effective teacher.[7] Although Rowling has said that Gilderoy Lockhart is her only character that she \"deliberately based on a real person\",[8] Snape was reportedly based, at least in part, on John Nettleship, who taught Rowling chemistry and employed her mother as an assistant at Wyedean School near Chepstow.[9][10][11] Rowling based Snape's given name on \"Severus Road\" in Clapham,[12] and his surname is borrowed from the name of a village in England.[13] In a 1999 interview[14] and again in 2004,[8] Rowling singled out Snape as one of her favourite characters to write.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhen Draco and Astoria Greengrass' son Scorpius Malfoy finds himself in an alternate timeline in which Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts, killed Harry and his allies and instituted a terrible reign of terror, he desperately searches for help in restoring history to its original course. He finds that in this reality Snape is still alive and still teaches at Hogwarts, and asks for his help. At first Snape is suspicious of him, since this timeline's version of Scorpius is a bully and a Voldemort stalwart. But when Scorpius shows that he knows of Snape having been in love with Lily, Harry's mother – Snape's most closely guarded secret – Snape becomes convinced that he does indeed come from a different timeline where Harry and his friends won. Snape then reveals that he, together with the fugitive Ron and Hermione Granger, maintain the last remnants of Dumbledore's Army – still waging hopeless resistance against the all-powerful Voldemort. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"J.K.

Snape, who had not realised until too late that Voldemort had interpreted the prophecy to be referring to Lily and her family (as it could've also referred to Frank and Alice Longbottom and their son Neville Longbottom), asked Voldemort to spare Lily. Still in terror for her life, he also approached Dumbledore, admitted his actions, and begged him to protect the Potters. Dumbledore chided him for thinking only of himself and not of Lily's husband and child, but agreed and ensured that they were placed under the Fidelius Charm. In return, Snape secretly allied himself with Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix as a double agent against Voldemort, using his powers of Occlumency to hide his betrayal from Voldemort. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBefore leaving Hogwarts to accompany Dumbledore in locating another horcrux – part of Voldemort's soul – Harry discovers from Professor Trelawney that it was Snape who overheard the prophecy and told it to Voldemort, resulting in Voldemort hunting down Harry and his parents. Despite this and Harry's angry questions, Dumbledore avers his trust in Snape. Returning to Hogwarts after retrieving Voldemort's Horcrux, Harry and Dumbledore alight atop the school's astronomy tower. Gravely weakened by the horcrux's protective potion, Dumbledore tells Harry he must fetch Snape, but before Harry can leave, Draco suddenly arrives, intending to carry out Voldemort's order to assassinate Dumbledore, closely followed by other Death Eaters (followers of Voldemort), and Snape. Snape interrupts the planned murder, killing the headmaster himself.[37] Harry, who is paralysed under his invisibility cloak by Dumbledore for his own protection, witnesses the kill, and is released upon Dumbledore's death. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the start-of-term feast at Hogwarts, Dumbledore announces Snape as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Horace Slughorn, a former teacher who himself had taught Snape during his Hogwarts years, comes out of retirement and replaces him as Potions Master. With Snape no longer teaching Potions, Harry enrols in Slughorn's class and is lent an old textbook until his new one arrives. Harry finds marginalia, including a variety of hexes and jinxes seemingly invented by an unknown student, and substantial improvements to the book's standard potion-making instructions. The text is inscribed as being \"the Property of the Half-Blood Prince\". The notes greatly bolster Harry's performance in Potions, so much so that he impresses Slughorn. Snape, who maintains that he \"never had the impression that [he] had been able to teach Potter anything at all\", is suspicious of Harry's newfound Potions success.[35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, Voldemort and his Death Eaters have tightened their grip on the wizarding world. Snape is named Headmaster of Hogwarts, while Death Eaters Alecto and Amycus Carrow are appointed as Hogwarts staff. The novel focuses largely on Harry and his friends and events outside the school; therefore Snape plays a limited role at the start. In the course of the book, Harry and his friends find out that a few students attempted to steal the Sword of Godric Gryffindor, and that Snape subsequently sent it to be stored at Gringotts Wizarding Bank; however, that sword was only a copy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTowards the end of the school year, Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout force Snape to flee the school.[42] Voldemort summons Snape to the Shrieking Shack. Erroneously believing Snape is the master of the Elder Wand and that Snape's death will make him the master of the Wand, Voldemort kills Snape by having his pet snake Nagini bite him through the neck.[43] The dying Snape releases a cloud of memories and tells Harry, who has watched the entire scene from a hidden spot, to take and view them. The dying Snape asks Harry to look at him, since Harry has the eyes of his mother Lily which Snape loved, and Snape wants to have these eyes as the last thing he would see. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSnape's role in the fourth novel, *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*, is not substantially different from that of the previous three books. He is apoplectic when Harry is unexpectedly entered into the Triwizard Tournament. Later Harry accidentally falls into Dumbledore's Pensieve and views memories of several Death Eater trials from years before. At one point, Snape is named as a Death Eater by Igor Karkaroff, but Dumbledore comes to Snape's defence, claiming that although Snape had indeed been a Death Eater, he changed sides before Voldemort's downfall and turned spy against him. Later, Dumbledore assures Harry that Snape's reformation is genuine, though he refuses to tell Harry how he knows this, saying the information \"is a matter between Professor Snape and myself\".[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeverus Snape appears in all eight *Harry Potter* films,[46] portrayed by British actor Alan Rickman. Rickman was Rowling's personal choice to portray the character.[47] He had conversations with Rowling about his character and is one of the few *Harry Potter* actors that she spoke to prior to the completion of the book series about the future direction of the character.[48] \"He knew very early on that he'd been in love with Lily,\" said Rowling. \"He needed to understand […] where this bitterness towards this boy who's the living example of her preference for another man came from.\"[49]\n\n\nRickman used this knowledge of Snape's ultimate loyalties throughout the films to decide how to play certain scenes, deliver specific lines, or use body language to convey specific emotions.[50] When the directors of the films would ask him why he was doing a scene a certain way or delivering a line in a specific manner, Rickman would simply reply that he knew something they didn't.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom these memories, Harry sees Snape's childhood and learns his true loyalties. In this vision, Harry learns that Snape befriended Lily as a child when they lived near each other. Upon their arrival at Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat placed Snape and Lily into Slytherin and Gryffindor Houses, respectively. They remained friends for the next few years until they were driven apart by Snape's interest in the Dark Arts; the friendship finally ended following the bullying episode that Harry had briefly seen in the fifth book, in which Snape calls Lily \"Mudblood\". Despite this separation and Snape's enduring animosity toward Lily's eventual husband James Potter, Snape continued to love Lily for the rest of his life.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n71. **^** Steve Daly. \"Daniel Radcliffe Talks 'Deathly Hallows'\". *EW.com*.

She adds, however, that she would like to think Harry made Snape's true loyalty and heroism known in the Wizarding world, and that he lobbied to ensure that a portrait be installed in the office.[44] In a separate interview, Rowling discussed Snape's back story, saying she had planned it ever since she wrote the first book because the whole series is built around it and she considers him one of the most important characters of the seventh book.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Epilogue[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTowards the end of the novel, Dolores Umbridge – the school's politically appointed headmistress – captures Harry and interrogates him about Dumbledore's whereabouts. She sends for Snape, demanding that he provide the magical truth serum Veritaserum in order to force Harry to reveal any information he may be hiding. Snape claims that his supplies of the serum have been exhausted after Umbridge tries to use the drug previously on Harry. It is later revealed that Snape had in fact supplied Umbridge with fake Veritaserum on the prior attempt. Snape then carries Harry's cryptic warning about Sirius' capture to the other Order members, allowing them to come to the rescue in the Department of Mysteries.[33] Harry still holds Snape partly responsible for Sirius' death, believing Snape's goading spurred Sirius into joining the battle.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the second chapter of *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy visit Snape at his home in Spinner's End. Narcissa's son Draco has been given a difficult task by Voldemort, and Narcissa swears Snape to an Unbreakable Vow that he will protect Draco, help him complete Voldemort's task, and finish the task himself if Draco fails. When questioned by Bellatrix about his loyalties, Snape says he has been working for Voldemort ever since Voldemort's return, and explains his actions in the previous books in that light. He points out that gaining Dumbledore's trust and protection has kept him out of Azkaban and free to operate on Voldemort's behalf.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLater in the book, Dumbledore has Snape teach Harry Occlumency, the protection of the mind from outside intrusion or influence.[32] The sessions are made difficult by their mutual hostility and end prematurely when Harry uses Dumbledore's Pensieve to view one of Snape's worst childhood memories without the latter's permission. He sees the memory of Snape being bullied by James and Sirius, and of calling Harry's mother Lily a Mudblood (a highly offensive term).[26] Only in the final book is it revealed that, prior to this confrontation, Snape and Lily had been close friends.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLike some other prominent members of Slytherin house, Snape is shown to be a clever and cunning wizard.[43][61] He is intelligent and has a keen, analytical mind. In an interview, Rowling adds that Snape is immensely brave,[20] and when asked if she considers Snape a hero, replied: \"Yes, I do; though a very flawed hero. An anti-hero, perhaps. He is not a particularly likeable man in many ways. He remains rather cruel, a bully, riddled with bitterness and insecurity—and yet he loved, and showed loyalty to that love and, ultimately, laid down his life because of it. That's pretty heroic!\"[3]\n\n\n\n### Magical abilities and skills[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, Snape's loyalty was a matter of intense debate among the fans. The issue was given special attention in the marketing campaigns on behalf of the last book, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*. \"Is Snape Good or Evil?\" was one of the questions in Scholastic Inc.'s seven-question series, part of its marketing campaign for the book.[65] As part of the Waldenbooks marketing campaign, two free stickers, one that said \"Trust Snape\" and another that stated \"Snape Is A Very Bad Man\" were available with the book. Borders Group published a separate book on the topic, *The Great Snape Debate,* containing essays and arguments from both sides of the debate.[66][67]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe adult Snape, on the other hand, is portrayed as very self-assured and confident of his abilities, to a degree that Rickman described as \"full of himself.\"[51] Director David Yates said Snape is a character with gravitas, authority and power.[60] Snape typically displays a very calm and collected demeanour, rarely at a loss for words or taken off guard. His temper, however, is sometimes short where Harry is concerned and positively flares when dealing with his erstwhile tormentor Sirius, or when accused of cowardice. His otherwise impassive and aloof attitude seems to stem from his belief that people who cannot control their emotions are weak.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe final revelation of Snape's loyalty in *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* was viewed positively by fans and critics alike. Daniel Radcliffe, who portrays Harry Potter in the movie series, expressed his delight, saying he was pleased to see that his theory that Snape would end up being a sort of tragic hero came through.[71] Elizabeth Hand from *The Washington Post* wrote, \"The much-maligned loner Snape does not come onstage until the latter part of \"Deathly Hallows,\" but when he does the book becomes his: Snape's fate, more than Voldemort's, perhaps more even than Harry's, is the most heartbreaking, surprising and satisfying of all of Rowling's achievements.\"[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLater, during a fight with Draco, Harry casts one of the Prince's spells marked \"For Enemies,\" and is horrified by the devastating wounds it inflicts to Draco's face and chest. Snape rushes to the scene and heals Draco, then interrogates Harry regarding the spell, using Legilimency to extract the source of Harry's knowledge (the Potions textbook) from Harry's mind. When Snape insists that Harry show him his Potions textbook, Harry hides the Prince's book and gives him Ron Weasley's book instead. As punishment for the attack and knowing Harry is lying about the textbook, Snape assigns Harry detention during the final Quidditch match of the year.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn a 2004 sketch on *Saturday Night Live* in which Lindsay Lohan appears as Hermione Granger, Snape is portrayed by Will Forte.[79] Snape has also been parodied in UK television. Comic Relief released a story called *Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan*, in which Snape is played by Jeremy Irons.[80][81] Snape appeared in a *Harry Potter* parody named \"Louis Potter and the Philosopher's Scone\" in Alistair McGowan's *Big Impression* show, played by Alistair McGowan himself.[82][83] In the *Harry Bladder* sketches in *All That*, Snape appears as Professor Chafe (portrayed by Jeremy Rowley), whose legs were badly chafed, causing him to be unnecessarily mean. Many sketches feature students brewing potions that did silly things, like enlarge students' behinds, give males large breasts, or change people into bras. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_5o7YapKhKLha8ysHDIRoY1Zw","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The same book introduced their sister Ariana who, at six years old, suffers a vicious attack by three male Muggle youths who had witnessed her doing magic. Frightened, they first try to get her to repeat what they had seen, and upon her failure to recreate it due to her young age, they try to stop her from being \"different\". The severe trauma of the attack leaves Ariana unable to function socially or to properly perform magic again. It is not explicitly stated in the novel what form this attack took, but Percival is given a life sentence in Azkaban for tracking down and hexing the boys who traumatised his daughter. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Ariana Dumbledore (sister)\n* Aurelius Dumbledore (nephew)\n |\n| Significant other | Gellert Grindelwald |\n| Nationality | British |\n| Born | 1881 |\n| Died | 30 June 1997 |\n\n\n**Prof. Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore**[1] is a fictional character in J.

His Patronus takes the form of a phoenix,[37] a recurring symbol in the books.\n\n\nHis knowledge of the most powerful kind of magic, love, is extensive. He taught Harry about its very essence, and the innate power of his ability to love his parents, which eventually helped Harry realise his destiny to kill Lord Voldemort.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRowling used several chapters in *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* to reveal two major details concerning Dumbledore: his early life and his death. The book introduces his parents, Percival and Kendra Dumbledore, as well as his little sister, Ariana; his brother, Aberforth Dumbledore, was mentioned in previous books. At six years old, Ariana was attacked by three Muggle boys who had witnessed her performing magic. Because of this attack, Ariana was seriously traumatised and never able to control her magic again. Enraged, Percival attacked the Muggle boys (killing them in the film version), and was given a life sentence in Azkaban. After this, Kendra moved her family to the village of Godric's Hollow. In one of her outbursts, Ariana accidentally killed Kendra at around the time that Albus completed his education. Albus became the head of the family and was forced to remain in his house with his sister while Aberforth completed his education.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

He has a very long and crooked nose that looks as if it has been broken at least twice. (It is speculated that his brother's punch during their sister's funeral may have played a role in shaping his nose.) He is also said to have long and skillful fingers. His eyes are described as being a brilliant, soul-piercing shade of blue, and usually twinkled with kindness and mischief.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a main character of the series, major facts relating to Dumbledore have generated a vast number of essays and discussions. The death of Dumbledore at the end of *Half-Blood Prince* was discussed by fans and critics alike. A website named DumbledoreIsNotDead.com sought to understand the events of the sixth book in a different way and provided arguments to claim that the character did not really die.[50] However, Rowling confirmed on 2 August 2006 that Dumbledore was, in fact, dead, humorously apologising to the website as she did so.[51] Along with DumbledoreIsNotDead.com, a collection of essays, *Who Killed Albus Dumbledore?: What Really Happened in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince? Six Expert Harry Potter Detectives Examine the Evidence*, was published by Zossima Press in November 2006.[52] In NextMovie.com's *Harry Potter* Mega Poll, Dumbledore's death was voted as the most unforgettable moment in the whole series.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** Smith, David (21 October 2007). \"Dumbledore was gay, JK tells amazed fans\". *The Observer*.

When the evil wizard Lord Voldemort kills Harry's parents before being reduced to a lesser form, Dumbledore decides to place the now-orphaned Harry in the home of Vernon and Petunia Dursley. He knows that Harry will be protected by the special magic caused by his mother's sacrifice. He reasons that they are the only family he has left with Petunia Evans Dursley being Harry's aunt, who accepts her nephew into their home. This old magic of binding love renders Voldemort incapable of touching Harry. Dumbledore leaves Harry upon the doorstep of the Dursley home with a letter explaining the situation. He departs with the final phrase, \"Good luck, Harry.\"[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince a young age, Dumbledore has always shown great magical abilities. During his education at Hogwarts, Dumbledore was known as the most brilliant student to have ever stepped into the school, winning \"every prize of note that the school offered\", and in his N.E.W.T.s, \"... did things with a wand [the examiner had] never seen before\". Rowling has said that Dumbledore is primarily self-taught, although he \"had access to superb teachers at Hogwarts,\" and, as far as his education is concerned, \"Dumbledore's family would be a profitable line of inquiry.\"[36] While he is not vain, Dumbledore also exhibits no false modesty, readily acknowledging that he is unusually intelligent and an exceptionally powerful wizard. He admits a number of\ntimes to Harry in their occasional meetings in *Half-Blood Prince* that he makes mistakes, and since he is smarter than most men, his mistakes \"tend to be correspondingly huger.\"\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConsidered the most powerful wizard in the world, Dumbledore is benevolent and wise, a good wizard in the style of Merlin.[*citation needed*] He exudes an aura of serenity and composure, rarely displaying intense emotions of anger or fear. Yet despite his benign nature, it is said that Dumbledore is the only wizard Lord Voldemort ever truly feared. Dumbledore is very eccentric and even slightly effeminate; he is very fond of knitting patterns and frequently wears flamboyant clothing (at one point, he is seen wearing a flowered bonnet). He is also known for his odd displays of whimsicality; he often uses humour to make people feel comfortable in his presence. As a supremely talented wizard, Dumbledore displays numerous examples of extraordinary powers. His abilities as a wizard are combined with a kind of cunning and subtlety of mind that allowed him to comprehend human nature and turn the better aspects of humanity (trust, love, and friendship) to Voldemort's disadvantage in particular.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Albus Dumbledore appears in some episodes of *Robot Chicken*, voiced by Seth Green. In \"Password: Swordfish\", when the threat of the puberty creature Pubertis is known, Dumbledore gives Harry a stone that might help him fight Pubertis. During this appearance, Dumbledore is an African-American who states that he is played by a different actor in each of the movies. Upon confrontation with Pubertis, Harry rubs the stone two times, which summons ghosts to punch it. When it comes to the third time, Dumbledore appears and tells Harry that the stone can only be warmed up three times a day (four if he takes a week off) and that Pubertis cannot be destroyed since it lives in everyone just like his own demon Wandus Limpus prevents him from having meaningful relationships. In \"I Love Her\", Dumbledore tells the students that Professor Snape suffered a \"minor potion accident\" and has enlisted Criss Angel as their substitute teacher.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDumbledore wears half-moon spectacles and a colourful array of robes, ranging from purple to bright orange. He once claimed to have a scar above his left knee in the precise shape of a map of the London Underground, but whether or not he actually does is unknown. His demeanour is often – if not always – serene and ethereal, and he usually speaks in a calm, pleasant voice even when Harry thought that he is actually furious.\n\n\nDuring the last year of his life, Dumbledore's right hand is scarred when he dons Marvolo Gaunt's Ring, which was cursed. Had Snape not intervened with a counter-curse, Dumbledore would have died much more quickly. Regardless, the curse left his hand blackened and dead-looking, and no amount of healing could repair the appearance. According to Snape, the curse would eventually spread itself from the contained hand, and Dumbledore was doomed to die in no more than one year's time. Whether this means the blackening dead-look appearance would spread throughout the entire body is unknown.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* In *The Simpsons* 2006 episode \"The Haw-Hawed Couple\", Lisa asks Homer to read her Angelica Button book to her for bedtime. Homer, learning that the character Headmaster Greystash will die (as Dumbledore did in *Half-Blood Prince*), hides the fact from Lisa by inventing a happier ending, though Lisa does read the real ending and decides that Homer's was better.[77]\n* Dumbledore also stars in Neil Cicierega's *Potter Puppet Pals*, in which he frequently strips completely naked, except for his hat, randomly in the story. Dumbledore also tends to use the exclamation \"Alas!\" in an apparently incorrect place, parodying Rowling's love for unusual words. In the episode \"Ron's Disease\", Dumbledore reveals himself to be \"a gay android\".[78]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe truth about Dumbledore's death is revealed through Snape's last memories in the Pensieve. Harry learns that Dumbledore made a terrible error by placing a cursed ring on his right hand, sometime between the fifth and sixth book, forgetting the curses that must be on the ring. The ring held the Resurrection Stone, which Dumbledore hoped to use to allow him to apologise to his sister and parents. Dumbledore called Snape to help him; however, when Snape arrived and assessed the curse, all he could do was contain it. Snape told Dumbledore that he had little more than a year to live. After hearing this news, Dumbledore revealed to Snape that he knew about Voldemort's plan to have Draco kill him. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** Perry, Evelyn M. \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Novel\".

He has claimed to be able to become invisible without using an invisibility cloak, which is a powerful Disillusionment Charm. Dumbledore is also skilled in Occlumency and Legilimency. Dumbledore is an expert at Transfiguration too, having taught the subject before becoming headmaster. He frequently creates complex objects like sofa chairs out of thin air (or from less comfortable chairs). Dumbledore is also proficient at Charms and Potions; according to the obituary written by Elphias Doge, his papers were published in journals such as *Achievements in Charming* and *The Practical Potioneer*. Dumbledore is famous for defeating Grindelwald, who is second on a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time only to Voldemort himself, in a \"spectacular duel of legend\", succeeding in doing so despite the fact that Grindelwald possessed the Elder Wand, which supposedly guarantees invincibility in duels due to its power. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe character of Albus Dumbledore has been compared to other archetypal \"wise old man\" characters. Dumbledore acts much like Merlin from *The Sword in the Stone*, in the manner of an \"absent-minded professor\";[43] both Merlin and Dumbledore educate a story's main character in a castle. As writer Evelyn Perry notes, \"Dumbledore resembles Merlin both personally and physically; he is an avid lover of books and wisdom who wears flowing robes and a long, white beard.\"[44] Dumbledore has also been compared with Gandalf from J. R. R. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the fourth novel, Dumbledore introduces the Triwizard Tournament. He also serves as a judge during the entire event. When Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire, Dumbledore is not enraged, but remains calm; simply asking Harry whether he had himself, or had asked an older student to submit his name (although in the film version he does get angry to the point of manhandling Harry). When Harry answers no, he believes him. By the end of the book, Dumbledore's fears are realized when Harry returns from his encounter with Voldemort clutching the dead body of Cedric Diggory and when Mad-Eye Moody (being impersonated by Barty Crouch Jr, through Polyjuice Potion) takes Harry away from Dumbledore and to his office inside the castle. Dumbledore immediately becomes suspicious and heads straight towards Moody's office with Minerva McGonagall and Severus Snape to save Harry and to interrogate Crouch. Afterwards, Dumbledore listens to Harry's eyewitness account about Voldemort's return. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMichael Gambon was cast as Harris' replacement four months after Harris' death.[27] Gambon was not concerned about bettering Harris, and he portrayed the character in his own way, putting on a slight Irish accent for the role,[28] as well as completing his scenes in three weeks.[29] Gambon reprised his role in all the remaining films.\n\n\nToby Regbo was chosen to portray Dumbledore in his youth in *Deathly Hallows – Part 1* and *Part 2*, for flashbacks scenes which provide essential information on the character's backstory.[30]\n\n\nJude Law played the role of a younger Dumbledore in the prequel films, *Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald* (2018) and *Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore* (2022).[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Characterisation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"J.K.

On the eve of their trip, however, Ariana accidentally kills Kendra during one of her uncontrolled outbursts of magic. Because Dumbledore's parents are absent (his father in Azkaban and his mother dead), he becomes the head of the family and it becomes his duty to put food on the table, as the family's misfortunes have left them poor. He is forced to remain in his house with Ariana while Aberforth completes his education. Aberforth knows of his brother's resentment and offers to care for Ariana himself, claiming that she prefers him to Albus, but Albus refuses, stating that it is his duty as the eldest child to care for the family.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMore than anything else, Dumbledore has a deep capacity for love, frequently reminding Harry that love was the greatest magic of all. Dumbledore believes in the good in everyone and insists on giving second chances. The greatest example of this is Dumbledore's relationship with Snape, in whom Dumbledore is willing to place a considerable amount of faith because he showed remorse. Dumbledore is highly perceptive and emotionally intelligent; his knowledge of a person's true personality goes beyond simply being a good judge of character. This is never more apparent than in his complex insights into Voldemort's psyche, which he pieces together with Harry to deduce where Voldemort's horcruxes are hidden.\n\n\nDumbledore's appearance hides a more steely aspect, as seen when apprehending Barty Crouch Jr who was masquerading as Mad-Eye Moody:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShortly after his death, Dumbledore's portrait magically appears in the Headmaster's office. His funeral is attended by students, Hogwarts staff, members of the Ministry of Magic, ghosts, centaurs, merpeople and others who wish to pay their respects. Shrouded in purple velvet, he is entombed in a white marble sarcophagus beside the lake at Hogwarts, and it is said that he is the only headmaster to be buried on the school grounds.\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** Wamsley, Laurel (22 October 2007). \"Bloggerson Stephen Colbert's presidential run\". *Slate*.

Rowling\n*Harry Potter*'s overarching theme is death.[34][35] In the first book, when Harry looks into the Mirror of Erised, he feels both joy and \"a terrible sadness\" at seeing his desire: his parents, alive and with him.[36] Confronting their loss is central to Harry's character arc and manifests in different ways through the series, such as in his struggles with Dementors.[36][37] Other characters in Harry's life die; he even faces his own death in *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*.[38] The series has an existential perspective – Harry must grow mature enough to accept death.[39] In Harry's world, death is not binary but mutable, a state that exists in degrees.[40] Unlike Voldemort, who evades death by separating and hiding his soul in seven parts, Harry's soul is whole, nourished by friendship and love.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Grossman, Lev (28 June 2007). \"Harry Potter's Last Adventure\". *Time*.

In 2016, the total value of the *Harry Potter* franchise was estimated at $25 billion,[7] making *Harry Potter* one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child* is a play based on a story co-written by Rowling.\n\n\nThe success of the books and films has allowed the *Harry Potter* franchise to expand with numerous derivative works, a travelling exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J. K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, and a trilogy of spin-off films premiering in November 2016 with *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them*, among many other developments. Themed attractions, collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been built at several Universal Destinations & Experiences amusement parks around the world.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHarry becomes a student at Hogwarts and is sorted into Gryffindor House. He gains the friendship of Ron Weasley, a member of a large but poor wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a witch of non-magical, or Muggle, parentage. The trio develop an enmity with the rich pure-blood student Draco Malfoy. Harry encounters the school's headmaster, Albus Dumbledore; the potions professor, Severus Snape, who displays a dislike for him; and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell. Quirrell turns out to be allied with Voldemort, who is still alive as a weak spirit. The first book concludes with Harry's confrontation with Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body, yearns to possess the Philosopher's Stone, a substance that bestows everlasting life.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the release of the first novel, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers, and are widely considered cornerstones of modern literature.[4][5] As of February 2023[update], the books have sold more than 600 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been available in 85 languages.[6] The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly 2.7 million copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_1CV31RcGEK4JSldmKVSBNGNn","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
