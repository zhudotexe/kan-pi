Precipitous declines in fertility in Asia and Latin America, from five children per woman in the 1970s to around 2.5 today, led many to believe Africa would follow a similar course. [...] Unfortunately, since the early 1990s, family planning programmes in Africa have not had the same attention [as in other parts of the world], resulting in slow, sometimes negligible, fertility declines. In a handful of countries, previous declines have stalled altogether and are reversing. [...] A few heroic efforts, such as Family Planning 2020, are attempting to stimulate family planning programmes across the continent, and there are some signs of success.

It is the largest Spanish-speaking country in the world and the third-most populous country in the Americas after the United States and Brazil.[5] Throughout most of the 20th century Mexico's population was characterized by rapid growth. Although this tendency has been reversed and average annual population growth over the last five years was less than 1%, the demographic transition is still in progress; Mexico still has a large youth cohort. The most populous city in the country is the capital, Mexico City, with a population of 8.9 million (2016), and its metropolitan area is also the most populated with 20.1 million (2010). Approximately 50% of the population lives in one of the 55 large metropolitan areas in the country. In total, about 78.84% of the population of the country lives in urban areas, and only about 21.16% in rural ones.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Mexico's population pyramid (2017)\nAccording to the 2012 revision of the World Population Prospects, the total population was 117,886,000 in 2010, compared to only 28,296,000 in 1950.

These measures jointly led to an intense demographic increase between 1930 and 1980. The population's annual growth rate has been reduced from a 3.5% peak in 1965 to 0.99% in 2005. While Mexico is now transitioning to the third phase of demographic transition, close to 50% of the population in 2009 was 25 years old or younger.[8] Fertility rates have also decreased from 5.7 children per woman in 1976 to 2.2 in 2006.[9] After decades of the gap narrowing, in 2020 the fertility rate in Mexico fell below the United States for the first time falling 22% in 2020 and a further 10.5% in the first half of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n202. **^** \"Tasa de crecimiento media anual de la población, 1950 a 2005\". *Inegi.org.mx*.

The most populous metropolitan area in Mexico is the *Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico*, or Greater Mexico City, which in 2005 had a population of 19.23 million, or 19% of the nation's population. The next four largest metropolitan areas in Mexico are Greater Guadalajara (4.1 million), Greater Monterrey (3.7 million), Greater Puebla (2.1 million) and Greater Toluca (1.6 million),[81] whose added population, along with Greater Mexico City, is equivalent to 30% of the nation's population. Greater Mexico City was the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country since the 1930s until the late 1980s. Since then, the country has slowly become economically and demographically less centralized. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to these criteria, the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas, or CDI in Spanish) and the INEGI (Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography), state that there are 15.7 million indigenous people in Mexico of many different ethnic groups,[128] which constitute 14.9% of the population in the country.[129]  \n Finally, according to the latest intercensal survey carried out by the Mexican government in 2015, Indigenous people make up 21.5% of Mexico's population. In this occasion, people who self-identified as \"Indigenous\" and people who self-identified as \"partially Indigenous\" were classified in the \"Indigenous\" category altogether.[130]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2005 Mexico had 187,938 *localidades* (lit. \"localities\" or \"settlements\"), which are census-designated places, which could be defined as a small town, a large city, or simply as a single unit housing in a rural area whether situated remotely or close to an urban area. A city is defined to be a settlement with more than 2,500 inhabitants. In 2005 there were 2,640 cities with a population between 2,500 and 15,000 inhabitants, 427 with a population between 15,000 and 100,000 inhabitants, 112 with a population between 100,000 and one million, and 11 with a population of more than one million.[79] All cities are considered \"urban areas\" and represent 76.5% of total population. Settlements with less than 2,500 inhabitants are considered \"rural communities\" (in fact, more than 80,000 of those settlements have only one or two housing units). Rural population in Mexico is 22.2% of total population.[79]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Years\n | 1920\n | 1922\n | 1923\n | 1924\n | 1925\n | 1926\n | 1927\n | 1928\n | 1929\n | 1930[28] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Life expectancy in Mexico\n | 34.0\n | 32.6\n | 33.5\n | 32.8\n | 32.1\n | 34.2\n | 40.3\n | 34.5\n | 35.4\n | 34.0\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Years\n | 1931\n | 1932\n | 1933\n | 1934\n | 1935\n | 1936\n | 1937\n | 1938\n | 1939\n | 1940[28] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Life expectancy in Mexico\n | 37.7\n | 38.4\n | 37.3\n | 38.2\n | 40.4\n | 38.3\n | 36.8\n | 39.4\n | 45.5\n | 39.0\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Years\n | 1941\n | 1942\n | 1943\n | 1944\n | 1945\n | 1946\n | 1947\n | 1948\n | 1949\n | 1950[28] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Life expectancy in Mexico\n | 42.6\n | 39.8\n | 42.8\n | 43.2\n | 44.2\n | 44.8\n | 46.3\n | 48.3\n | 45.8\n | 50.7\n |\n\n\n### UN estimates[edit]\n\n\nThe Population Department of the United Nations prepared the following estimates.[17]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. **^** \"As Spain's Economy Worsens, Young Adults Flock to Mexico for Jobs – New America Media\". *newamericamedia.org*.

Given that, for the most part, each ethnic group was estimated by different surveys with different methodologies and years apart rather than on a single comprehensive racial census, some groups could overlap with others and be overestimated or underestimated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"World Population Prospects – Population Division – United Nations\". *population.un.org*.
