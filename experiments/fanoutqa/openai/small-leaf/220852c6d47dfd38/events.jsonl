It is located in the Mahalangur Himalayas 19 km (12 mi) southeast of Mount Everest, on the China–Nepal border. One of the eight-thousanders, Makalu is an isolated peak in the shape of a four-sided pyramid.\n\n\nMakalu has two notable subsidiary peaks. Kangchungtse, or Makalu II (7,678 m) lies about three kilometres (two miles) north-northwest of the main summit. Rising about 5 km (3 mi) north-northeast of the main summit across a broad plateau, and connected to Kangchungtse by a narrow, 7,200 m saddle, is Chomo Lonzo (7,804 m).\n\n\n\n\n## Climbing history[edit]\n\n\nThe first climb on Makalu was made by an American team led by Riley Keegan in the spring of 1954. The expedition was composed of Sierra Club members including Bill Long and Allen Steck, and was called the California Himalayan Expedition to Makalu.[3]\nThey attempted the southeast ridge but were turned back at 7,100 metres (23,300 ft) by a constant barrage of storms. A New Zealand team including Sir Edmund Hillary was also active in the spring, but did not get very high due to injury and illness. In the fall of 1954, a French reconnaissance expedition made the first ascents of the subsidiary summits Kangchungtse (October 22: Jean Franco, Lionel Terray, sirdar Gyalzen Norbu Sherpa and Pa Norbu) and Chomo Lonzo (October 30?: Jean Couzy and Terray).[4]\n\n\n\n### First ascent[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1955 French Makalu expedition\n\nMakalu was first summited on May 15, 1955, by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy of a French expedition led by Jean Franco. Franco, Guido Magnone and Gyalzen Norbu Sherpa summitted the next day, followed by Jean Bouvier, Serge Coupé, Pierre Leroux and André Vialatte on the 17th. This was an amazing achievement at the time, to have the vast majority of expedition members summit, especially on such a difficult peak. Prior to this time, summits were reached by one to two expedition members at most, with the rest of teams providing logistical support before turning around and heading home. The French team climbed Makalu by the north face and northeast ridge, via the saddle between Makalu and Kangchungtse (the Makalu-La), establishing the standard route.[4]\n\n\nAn ascent without oxygen was attempted by the 1960-61 Silver Hut expedition but two attempts did not succeed.\n\n\n\n### Notable ascents[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Glacier on Makalu\n![](image)Makalu\n![](image)Makalu 3D\n* 1955 *North Face to Northeast Ridge* FA by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy of France.[4]\n* 1970: *Southeast Ridge* FA of ridge attempted by the Americans in 1954,[5] was made by Y. Ozaki and A. Tanaka from Japan on May 23.[6]\n* 1971: The very technical *West Pillar* route was climbed in May by Frenchmen B. Mellet and Y. Seigneur.[4]\n* 1975: *South Face* – an expedition led by Aleš Kunaver reached the top of Makalu up its steep southern side, becoming the first Slovenes to summit an eight-thousander. The first amongst them was Stane Belak. This was the third ascent of an eight-thousand meter peak by a great mountain face and the highest peak successfully summitted without supplementary oxygen (Marjan Manfreda).[7]\n* 1976 – South pillar route completed by Czechoslovak expedition (first attempt in 1973 ended shortly before Makalu South at 8010m due to the fatal fall of Jan Kounický). Route goes via south buttress to Makalu South and then via southeast ridge. Makalu South was climbed by 11 expedition members. Two of them – Karel Schubert and Milan Kriššák summited main summit together with Jorge Camprubi from Spanish expedition which climbed southeast ridge. Karel Schubert died after bivouac near the summit.[*citation needed*]\n* 1980: The second ascent of the *West Pillar* was completed in May by John Roskelley (summit), Chris Kopczynski, James States and Kim Momb, without Sherpa support and without bottled oxygen.[8]\n* 1981: On 15 October renowned Polish climber Jerzy Kukuczka ascended Makalu via a new route up the north-western side and north crest. Kukuczka climbed solo, in Alpine style, without supplemental oxygen.[9]\n* 1982 : On 10 October Polish climber Andrzej Czok ascended Makalu via West face till 8000m and north-western ridge. Camp IV was reached by two more climbers, Janusz Skorek and Andrzej Machnik, but when their first summit attempt failed, Czok decided to try one more time solo.[10]\n* 1988: Frenchman Marc Batard climbed in one day (after camps were set up) to the summit via the *West Buttress* on April 27.[11]\n* 1989: *Direct South Face*, solo new start by Frenchman Pierre Beghin to 1975 Yugoslav route.[12]\n* 1990: First female ascent, Kitty Calhoun via the West Pillar route.[13]\n* 1994: On May 15, the anniversary of the first summit, Anatoli Boukreev made a speed ascent in 46 hours.[*citation needed*]\n* 1997: After seven failed attempts between 1977 and 1996, the West face was finally ascended. A Russian expedition led by Sergey Efimov brought Alexei Bolotov, Yuri Ermachek, Dmitri Pavlenko, Igor Bugachevski and Nikolai Jiline to the summit.[14] This ascent won the 1998 Piolet d'Or.\n* 2006: On or about January 27 the French mountaineer Jean-Christophe Lafaille disappeared on Makalu while trying to make the first winter ascent.[15]\n* 2009: Makalu was first climbed in winter on February 9, 2009, by Italian Simone Moro and Kazakh Denis Urubko.[16][17] It was the final Nepali eight-thousander to be climbed in winter conditions. Moro had previously made the first winter ascent of Shishapangma in winter 2005 with Pole Piotr Morawski.\n* 2022: Ecuadorian Karl Egloff set a new speed record by ascending in 17 hours 18 minutes on May 8, 2022. He climbed without sherpa support and without bottled oxygen. [18]\n* 2022: Adrian Ballinger made the first ski descent, skiing from 15m below the summit to the foot of the glacier.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n![](image)\n2004 photo mosaic: the Himalayas with Makalu and Mount Everest from the International Space Station, Expedition 8.\n\n## Makalu-Barun Valley[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Makalu-Barun Valley – A glacier valley starting from the foot of the Makalu.\nMain article: Barun Valley\n\nMakalu-Barun Valley is a Himalayan glacier valley situated at the base of Makalu in the Sankhuwasabha district of Nepal.

The main summit is on the border between Tibet Autonomous Region of China and the Khumbu region of Nepal.\n\n\nWith Everest to the north and Nuptse to the west, Lhotse forms the apex of the massive horseshoe-shaped arc of the Everest massif. Despite the tremendous vertical relief of its South and Northeast Faces, it is the least prominent of the eight-thousanders due to the great height of the South Col between it and Everest. Lhotse's Western Face, recessed behind the head of the Khumbu Glacier in the Western Cwm, plays an integral part in the standard routes of ascent for both peaks; the name Lhotse, which means \"South Peak\" in Tibetan, further emphasizes the close relationship between the two.\n\n\nThe main ridge of the mountain features four distinct summits: Lhotse Main at 8,516 metres (27,940 ft) above sea level, Lhotse Middle (also known as Lhotse Central I or Lhotse East) at 8,414 m (27,605 ft), Lhotse Central II at 8,372 m (27,467 ft) and Lhotse Shar at 8,383 m (27,503 ft). Though Lhotse Main is considered to be an intermediately difficult eight-thousander when ascended from the standard Reiss Couloir route, its secondary summits and extremely steep South Face are regarded as some of the most difficult and dangerous climbs in the world.[2][3]Its icy North East Face remains unclimbed.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Climbing[edit]\n\n\nAn early attempt on Lhotse was made by the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, headed by Norman Dyhrenfurth. It also included two Austrians (cartographers Erwin Schneider and Ernst Senn) and two Swiss (Bruno Spirig and Arthur Spöhel), and was the first expedition in the Everest area to include Americans (Fred Beckey, George Bell, and Richard McGowan). The Nepalese liaison officer was Gaya Nanda Vaidya. They were accompanied by 200 local porters and several climbing Sherpas. After a brief look at the dangerous southern approaches of Lhotse Shar, they turned their attention, during September and October, to the Western Cwm and the northwest face of Lhotse, on which they achieved an altitude of about 8,100 metres (26,600 ft). They were beaten back by unexpectedly strong wind and low temperatures. Under Schneider's direction, they completed the first map of the Everest area (1:50,000 photogrammetric). The expedition also made several short films covering local cultural topics and made a number of first ascents of smaller peaks in the Khumbu region.[5]\n\n\nThe main summit of Lhotse was first climbed on 18 May 1956, by the Swiss team of Ernst Reiss and Fritz Luchsinger, members of the Swiss Mount Everest/Lhotse Expedition.[6][7]\n\n\nOn 12 May 1970, Sepp Mayerl and Rolf Walter of Austria made the first ascent of Lhotse Shar.[8]\n\n\nOn 12 May 1999, Czech climber Soňa Vomáčková reached the main summit and thus became the first woman to reach it without supplemental oxygen.\n[9]\n\n\nLhotse Middle remained, for a long time, the highest unclimbed named point on Earth; its first ascent was made on 23 May 2001 by Eugeny Vinogradsky, Sergei Timofeev, Alexei Bolotov and Petr Kuznetsov of a Russian expedition.[10]\n\n\nThe Lhotse standard climbing route follows the same path as Everest's South Col route up to the Yellow Band beyond Camp 3. After the Yellow Band, the routes diverge with climbers bound for Everest taking a left over the Geneva Spur up to the South Col, while Lhotse climbers take a right further up the Lhotse face. The last part to the summit leads through the narrow \"Reiss couloir\" until the Lhotse main peak is reached.\n\n\nBy December 2008, 371 climbers had summited Lhotse while 20 had died during their attempt.[11] Lhotse was not summited in 2014, 2015, or 2016 due to a series of incidents. It was next summited in May 2017.[12]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nuptse Ridge, Everest, Lhotse, and Lhotse Shar peaks\n### Timeline[edit]\n\n\n* 1955 Attempt by the International Himalayan Expedition.[5]\n* 1956 May 18 First ascent of the main summit: Fritz Luchsinger and Ernst Reiss.[6]\n* 1965 First attempt on Lhotse Shar by a Japanese expedition – reached 8,100 m (26,570 ft).[13]\n* 1970 May 12 First ascent of Lhotse Shar by an Austrian expedition, Sepp Mayerl, Rolf Walter.\n* 1973 First attempt on the South Face by a Japanese expedition led by Ryohei Uchida.\n* 1974 December 25 First attempt of an 8,000-meter peak in winter. Polish climbers Andrzej Zawada and Andrzej Heinrich reached a height of 8,250 meters (27,070 feet).\n* 1975 Attempt on the South Face by Reinhold Messner.[14]\n* 1977 Second ascent of the main summit by a German expedition led by Dr. G. Schmatz.\n* 1979 Ascent of the main summit by Andrzej Czok and Jerzy Kukuczka without the use of supplemental oxygen[15] (Kukuczka's first conquered eight-thousander, and eventually the last one to climb 10 years later). Ascent was in company of Zygmunt Andrzej Heinrich and Janusz Skorek. Four days later second group climbed to the peak - Janusz Baranek, Adam Bilczewski, Stanisław Cholewa, Robert Niklas. Leszek Czarnecki, climbed with the group without the use of supplemental oxygen, but carrying the oxygen to elevation of 8350 m, where he was forced to turn back due to inclement weather.\n* 1980 April 27 Attempt on Lhotse Shar by the French climber Nicolas Jaeger, last seen at 8,200 metres (26,900 ft).\n* 1981 Attempt on the South Face by a Yugoslavian expedition led by Aleš Kunaver. Vanja Matijevec and Franček Knez reach the top of the Face but not the summit.[16]\n* 1981 April 30 First solo ascent without the use of supplement oxygen of the main summit by Hristo Prodanov,[17][18] as part of the first Bulgarian Himalayan expedition.\n* 1981 October 16 Second ascent of Lhotse Shar, Colin Molines[19]\n* 1984 May 20/21 Members of the Czechoslovak expedition led by Ivan Galfy climb the South Face of Lhotse Shar for the first time (third overall ascent of Lhotse Shar).[16][18]\n* 1986 October 16 Ascent by Reinhold Messner, thus becoming the first person to climb all of the fourteen eight-thousanders.\n* 1987 May 21 the Brazilian Otto William Gerstenberger Junior and the Swiss Haans Singera reach the summit.\n* 1988 December 31 Krzysztof Wielicki, a Polish climber, completed the first winter ascent of Lhotse.[20]\n* 1989 October 24 Jerzy Kukuczka perishes while climbing the South Face when his secondhand rope breaks.[15] An international expedition led by Reinhold Messner to climb the South Face was unsuccessful.[14]\n* 1990 April 24 Tomo Česen from Slovenia, makes a first solo ascent of the South Face of Lhotse.[21][22] Controversy of his climb is later raised by the Soviet Himalayan expedition, claiming that his ascent would be impossible.[23] Reinhold Messner would also raise his doubts.\n* 1990 October 16 in severe weather conditions, **the** **First ascent of South Face** by the Soviet Himalayan expedition members climbing pair Sergey Bershov and Gennadiy Karataev reached the summit, while Igor Svergun reached 8,200m.\n* 1994 May 13 Carlos Carsolio got mountaintop solo, introducing a world speed record at 23 h 50 min rise from Base Camp to the summit.\n* 1996 May 10 Chantal Mauduit becomes the first woman to reach the summit of Lhotse.[23]\n* 1996 May 17 Anatoli Boukreev solo ascent, world speed record at 21 hours 16 min from Base Camp to summit without supplemental oxygen; he had summited Everest the week before.[24]\n* 1997 Attempt to climb Lhotse Middle via the ridge between the main summit and Lhotse Shar by a Russian expedition, led by Vladimir Bashkirov, who died in the attempt, just below the main summit.[25]\n* 1999 Attempt to climb Lhotse Middle and traverse the three summits by a Russian team, failed due to bad weather.[18]\n* 2001 May 23 First ascent of Lhotse Middle by a Russian expedition.[10][18][26]\n* 2007 Pemba Doma Sherpa, Nepali mountaineer and two-time summiter of Mount Everest, falls to her death from Lhotse at 8,000 m. The fall was witnessed by Australian mountaineer Philip Ling who was also climbing the mountain. Two other Sherpas also perished while trailing a group of clients during a snowstorm.[27]\n* 2011 May 14–15, Michael Horst, American guide, summits Mount Everest and Lhotse without descending below Camp IV (South Col) with less than 21 hours elapsing between the two summits.[28]\n* 2011 on 20 May, Indian mountaineer Arjun Vajpai became the youngest climber ever to summit Lhotse, aged 17 years, 11 months and 16 days.[29]\n* 2017 on 19 May, Belgian Stef 'Wolf' Wolfsput became the first person with a disability to climb to the summit of Lhotse and only the second Belgian. He suffers a paralysed leg.[*citation needed*]\n* 2018 on 22 May, Mexican climber José Luis Sánchez Fernández became the first Latin American to summit both Mount Everest and Lhotse in less than 24 hours.[30]\n* 2018 on 30 September, Hilaree Nelson and Jim Morrison complete the first ski descent from the summit of Lhotse.[31]\n\n\n![](image)The Western Cwm. The Lhotse Face (centre right) is connected to Mount Everest (centre left) by the South Col (centre, lowest point on horizon).\n### Lhotse Face[edit]\n\n\nThe western flank of Lhotse is known as the *Lhotse Face*. Any climber bound for the South Col on Everest must climb this 1,125 m (3,690 ft) wall of glacial blue ice. This face rises at 40 and 50-degree pitches with the occasional 80-degree bulges. High-altitude climbing Sherpas and the lead climbers will set fixed ropes up this wall of ice. Climbers and porters need to establish a good rhythm of foot placement and pull themselves up the ropes using their jumars. Two rocky sections called the Yellow Band and the Geneva Spur interrupt the icy ascent on the upper part of the face.\n\n\nOn 19 May 2016, a high-altitude mountain worker, Ang Furba Sherpa, died when he slipped and fell down the Lhotse face.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSouthern and northern climbing routes as seen from the International Space Station.

In the summer of 2014, a Pakistani-Italian expedition to K2, named \"K2 60 Years Later\", was organized to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the first ascent of K2. One of the goals of the expedition was to accurately measure the height of the mountain using satellite navigation. The height of K2 measured during this expedition was 8,609.02 metres (28,244.8 ft).[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nK2 is notable for its local relief as well as its total height. It stands over 3,000 metres (9,840 ft) above much of the glacial valley bottoms at its base. It is a consistently steep pyramid, dropping quickly in almost all directions. The north side is the steepest: there it rises over 3,200 metres (10,500 ft) above the K2 (Qogir) Glacier in only 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) of horizontal distance. In most directions, it achieves over 2,800 metres (9,200 ft) of vertical relief in less than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft).[28]\n\n\nA 1986 expedition led by George Wallerstein made an inaccurate measurement showing that K2 was taller than Mount Everest, and therefore the tallest mountain in the world.[29] A corrected measurement was made in 1987, but by then the claim that K2 was the tallest mountain in the world had already made it into many news reports and reference works.[30]\n\n\n\n## Height[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Montgomerie's original sketch from 1856 in which he applied the notation *K2*\nThe name *K2* is derived from the notation used by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of British India.

It is now also used in the Balti language, rendered as *Kechu* or *Ketu*[22][25] (Balti: کے چو Urdu: کے ٹو). The Italian climber Fosco Maraini argued in his account of the ascent of Gasherbrum IV that while the name of K2 owes its origin to chance, its clipped, impersonal nature is highly appropriate for so remote and challenging a mountain. He concluded that it was:\n\n\n\n\n> ... just the bare bones of a name, all rock and ice and storm and abyss. It makes no attempt to sound human. It is atoms and stars.

They concluded that the Abruzzi Spur was the most practical route and reached a height of around 8,000 meters (26,000 ft) before turning back due to diminishing supplies and the threat of bad weather.[43][44]\n\n\nThe following year, the 1939 American expedition led by Fritz Wiessner came within 200 metres (660 ft) of the summit but ended in disaster when Dudley Wolfe, Pasang Kikuli, Pasang Kitar, and Pintso disappeared high on the mountain.[45][46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe next expedition to K2, in 1909, led by Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, reached an elevation of around 6,250 metres (20,510 ft) on the South East Spur, now known as the *Abruzzi Spur* (or Abruzzi Ridge). This would eventually become part of the standard route, but was abandoned at the time due to its steepness and difficulty. After trying and failing to find a feasible alternative route on the West Ridge or the North East Ridge, the Duke declared that K2 would never be climbed, and the team switched its attention to Chogolisa, where the Duke came within 150 metres (490 ft) of the summit before being driven back by a storm.[42]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2nd-highest mountain on Earth\n\nFor other uses, see K2 (disambiguation).\n\n\"Chogori\" redirects here.

The K2 Gneiss is separated from the surrounding sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks of the surrounding Karakoram Metamorphic Complex by normal faults. For example, a fault separates the K2 gneiss of the east face of K2 from limestones and slates comprising nearby Skyang Kangri.[33][35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe policy of the Great Trigonometrical Survey was to use local names for mountains wherever possible[b] and K1 was found to be known locally as Masherbrum. K2, however, appeared not to have acquired a local name, possibly due to its remoteness. The mountain is not visible from Askole, one of the highest settlements on the way to the mountain, nor from the nearest habitation to the north. K2 is only fleetingly glimpsed from the end of the Baltoro Glacier, beyond which few local people would have ventured.[19] The name *Chogori*, derived from two Balti words, *chhogo* ཆོ་གྷའོ་ (\"big\") and *ri* རི (\"mountain\") (چھوغوری)[20] has been suggested as a local name,[21] but evidence for its widespread use is scant. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough the summit of Everest is at a higher altitude, K2 is a more difficult and dangerous climb, due in part to its more northern location, where inclement weather is more common.[12] The summit was reached for the first time by the Italian climbers Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni, on the 1954 Italian expedition led by Ardito Desio. As of February 2021[update], only 377 people have summited K2.[13] There have been 91 deaths during attempted climbs.\n\n\nMost ascents are made during July and August, typically the warmest times of the year.[14] But in January 2021, K2 became the final eight-thousander to be summited in the winter; the mountaineering feat was accomplished by a team of Nepalese climbers, led by Nirmal Purja and Mingma Gyalje Sherpa.[15][16]\n\n\nK2 has now been climbed by almost all of its ridges, but unlike other eight-thousanders, never from its eastern face.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are a number of routes on K2, of somewhat different character, but they all share some key difficulties, the first being the extremely high altitude and resulting lack of oxygen: there is only one-third as much oxygen available to a climber on the summit of K2 as there is at sea level.[100] The second is the propensity of the mountain to experience extreme storms of several days duration, which have resulted in many of the deaths on the peak. The third is the steep, exposed, and committing nature of all routes on the mountain, which makes retreat more difficult, especially during a storm. Despite many attempts the first successful winter ascents occurred only in 2021. All major climbing routes lie on the Pakistani side.[*citation needed*] The base camp is also located on the Pakistani side.[101]\n\n\n\n### Abruzzi Spur[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \nSwenson, Steven J.

The failures were also attributed to sickness (Crowley was suffering the residual effects of malaria), a combination of questionable physical training, personality conflicts, and poor weather conditions—of 68 days spent on K2 (at the time, the record for the longest time spent at such an altitude) only eight provided clear weather.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The south side of K2 with the Abruzzi Spur route\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 22 July 2018, Garrett Madison became the first American climber to reach the summit of K2 more than once when he led an international team of eight climbers, nine Nepali Sherpas, four Pakistani high-altitude porters, and two other Madison Mountaineering guides to the summit.[76][77]\nOn 22 July 2018, Polish mountaineer and mountain runner Andrzej Bargiel became the first person to ski down from summit to base camp.[78]\n2019\nOn 25 July 2019, Anja Blacha became the first German woman to summit K2.

After allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga was the third-highest mountain.[6]\n\n\nThe Kangchenjunga is a sacred mountain in Nepal and Sikkim and was first climbed on 25 May 1955 by Joe Brown and George Band, who were part of the 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition. They stopped just short of the true summit, keeping a promise given to Tashi Namgyal, the Chogyal of Sikkim, that the top of the mountain would remain inviolate.[7] The Indian side of the mountain is off-limits to climbers. In 2016, the adjoining Khangchendzonga National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe *Kangchenjunga Himal* section of the Himalayas lies both in Nepal and India and encompasses 16 peaks over 7,000 m (23,000 ft). In the north, it is limited by the Lhonak Chu, Goma Chu and Jongsang La, and in the east by the Teesta River. The western limit runs from the Jongsang La down the Gingsang and Kangchenjunga glaciers and the rivers of Ghunsa and Tamur.[1] Kanchenjunga rises about 20 km (12 mi) south of the general alignment of the Great Himalayan range about 125 km (78 mi) east-southeast of Mount Everest as the crow flies. South of the southern face of Kanchenjunga runs the 3,000–3,500-metre-high (9,800–11,500 ft) Singalila Ridge that separates Sikkim from Nepal and northern West Bengal.[15]\n\n\nKangchenjunga and its satellite peaks form a huge mountain massif.[16] The massif's five highest peaks are listed in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor other uses, see Kangchenjunga (disambiguation).\n\nThird highest mountain in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKangchenjunga Main is the highest elevation of the Brahmaputra River basin, which forms part of the southeast Asian monsoon regime and is among the globally largest river basins.[25]\nKangchenjunga is one of six peaks above 8,000 m (26,000 ft) located in the basin of the Kosi River, which is among the largest tributaries of the Ganges.[26]\nThe Kangchenjunga massif forms also part of the Ganges Basin.[27]\n\n\nAlthough it is the third highest peak in the world, Kangchenjunga is only ranked 29th by topographic prominence, a measure of a mountain's independent stature. The key col for Kangchenjunga lies at a height of 4,664 metres (15,302 ft), along the watershed boundary between Arun and Brahmaputra rivers in Tibet.[28] It is, however, the fourth-most-prominent peak in the Himalayas, after Everest, and the western and eastern anchors of the Himalaya, Nanga Parbat and Namcha Barwa, respectively.[29]\n\n\n\n## Climbing routes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Kangchenjunga |\n| --- |\n| Nepali: कञ्चनजङ्घा, romanized: *Kanchanjanghā* |\n| ![](image)Kangchenjunga from Pelling, Sikkim, India\n |\n| Highest point |\n| Elevation | 8,586 m (28,169 ft)[1]Ranked 3rd |\n| Prominence | 3,922 m (12,867 ft)[2]Ranked 29th |\n| Listing | * Eight-thousander\n* Seven Third Summits\n* List of mountains in India\n* List of mountains in Nepal\n* Country high point (India)\n* Ultra-prominent peak\n |\n| Coordinates | 27°42′09″N 88°08′48″E﻿ / ﻿27.70250°N 88.14667°E﻿ / 27.70250; 88.14667[2] |\n| Geography |\n| ![Kangchenjunga is located in Sikkim](image)![Kangchenjunga](image)\nKangchenjunga\nLocation of Kangchenjunga\nShow map of Sikkim\n![Kangchenjunga is located in Koshi Province](image)![Kangchenjunga](image)\nKangchenjunga\nKangchenjunga (Koshi Province)\nShow map of Koshi Province\n![Kangchenjunga is located in India](image)![Kangchenjunga](image)\nKangchenjunga\nKangchenjunga (India)\nShow map of India\n![Kangchenjunga is located in Nepal](image)![Kangchenjunga](image)\nKangchenjunga\nKangchenjunga (Nepal)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Bajracharya, S.

The Goecha La trek is gaining popularity amongst tourists. It goes to the Goecha La Pass, located right in front of the huge southeast face of Kangchenjunga. Another trek to Green Lake Basin has recently[*when?*] been opened for trekking. This trek goes to the Northeast side of Kangchenjunga along the famous Zemu Glacier.

Progress was very slow, partly because of problems with supplies and porters, and presumably also lack of fitness and acclimatisation. However, from a high camp at about 22,600 ft (6,900 m) they were eventually able to reach a point 50 or 60 ft (15 or 18 m) below the summit before they were turned back by strong winds.[35]\n* In 1929, the German Paul Bauer led an expedition team that reached 7,400 m (24,300 ft) on the northeast spur before being turned back by a five-day storm.[38]\n* In May 1929, the American E.

A British geological expedition in 1925 spotted a bipedal creature which they asked the locals about, who referred to it as the \"Kangchenjunga Demon\".[61]\n\n\nFor generations, there have been legends recounted by the inhabitants of the areas surrounding Kanchenjunga, both in Sikkim and in Nepal, that there is a valley of immortality hidden on its slopes. These stories are well known to both the original inhabitants of the area, the Lepcha people and Limbu people, and those of the Tibetan Buddhist cultural tradition. In Tibetan, this valley is known as Beyul Demoshong. In 1962, a Tibetan Lama by the name of Tulshuk Lingpa led over 300 followers into the high snow slopes of Kanchenjunga, to ‘open the way’ to Beyul Demoshong.

The Chinese team measured a snow-ice depth of 3.5 m (11 ft),[33] which is in agreement with a net elevation of 8,848 m (29,029 ft). An argument arose between China and Nepal as to whether the official height should be the rock height (8,844 m, China) or the snow height (8,848 m, Nepal). In 2010, both sides agreed that the height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognises China's claim that the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m.[41] On 8 December 2020, it was jointly announced by the two countries that the new official height is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 ft).[42][43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 8,848 m (29,029 ft) height given was officially recognised by Nepal and China.[34] Nepal planned a new survey in 2019 to determine if the April 2015 Nepal earthquake affected the height of the mountain.[35]\n\n\nIn May 1999, an American Everest expedition directed by Bradford Washburn anchored a GPS unit into the highest bedrock. A rock head elevation of 8,850 m (29,035 ft), and a snow/ice elevation 1 m (3 ft) higher, were obtained via this device.[36] Although as of 2001, it has not been officially recognised by Nepal,[37] this figure is widely quoted. Geoid uncertainty casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 (see § 21st-century surveys) surveys.[38]\n\n\nIn 1955, a detailed photogrammetric map (at a scale of 1:50,000) of the Khumbu region, including the south side of Mount Everest, was made by Erwin Schneider as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, which also attempted Lhotse.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** *Geography of Nepal: Physical, Economic, Cultural and Regional* by Netra Bahadur Thapa, D.P.

Two accounts suggest the rates of change are 4 mm (0.16 in) per year vertically and 3 to 6 mm (0.12 to 0.24 in) per year horizontally,[36][44] but another account mentions more lateral movement (27 mm or 1.1 in),[45] and even shrinkage has been suggested.[46]\n\n\n\n### Comparisons[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of highest mountains on Earth.\n\nThe summit of Everest is the point at which Earth's surface reaches the greatest distance above sea level. Several other mountains are sometimes claimed to be the \"tallest mountains on Earth\". Mauna Kea in Hawaii is tallest when measured from its base;[note 5] it rises over 10,200 m (33,464.6 ft) when measured from its base on the mid-ocean floor, but only attains 4,205 m (13,796 ft) above sea level.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy March 2012, Everest had been climbed 5,656 times with 223 deaths.[91] Although lower mountains have longer or steeper climbs, Everest is so high the jet stream can hit it. Climbers can be faced with winds beyond 320 km/h (200 mph) when the weather shifts.[92] At certain times of the year the jet stream shifts north, providing periods of relative calm at the mountain.[93] Other dangers include blizzards and avalanches.[93]\n\n\nBy 2013, The Himalayan Database recorded 6,871 summits by 4,042 different people.[94]\n\n\n\n### Early attempts[edit]\n\n\nIn 1885, Clinton Thomas Dent, president of the Alpine Club, suggested that climbing Mount Everest was possible in his book *Above the Snow Line*.[95]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Based on the 2020 surveys of elevation of snow cap, not rock head.

Waugh began work on Nicolson's data in 1854, and along with his staff spent almost two years working on the numbers, having to deal with the problems of light refraction, barometric pressure, and temperature over the vast distances of the observations. Finally, in March 1856 he announced his findings in a letter to his deputy in Calcutta. Kangchenjunga was declared to be 8,582 m (28,156 ft), while Peak XV was given the height of 8,840 m (29,002 ft). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWaugh concluded that Peak XV was \"most probably the highest in the world\".[16] Peak XV (measured in feet) was calculated to be exactly 29,000 ft (8,839.2 m) high, but was publicly declared to be 29,002 ft (8,839.8 m) in order to avoid the impression that an exact height of 29,000 feet (8,839.2 m) was nothing more than a rounded estimate.[29] Waugh is sometimes playfully credited with being \"the first person to put two feet on top of Mount Everest\".[30]\n\n\n\n### 20th-century surveys[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe ascent via the southeast ridge begins with a trek to Base Camp at 5,380 m (17,700 ft) on the south side of Everest, in Nepal. Expeditions usually fly into Lukla (2,860 m) from Kathmandu and pass through Namche Bazaar. Climbers then hike to Base Camp, which usually takes six to eight days, allowing for proper altitude acclimatisation in order to prevent altitude sickness.[245] Climbing equipment and supplies are carried by yaks, dzopkyos (yak-cow hybrids), and human porters to Base Camp on the Khumbu Glacier. When Hillary and Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953, the British expedition they were part of (comprising over 400 climbers, porters, and Sherpas at that point) started from the Kathmandu Valley, as there were no roads further east at that time.\n\n\nClimbers spend a couple of weeks in Base Camp, acclimatising to the altitude. During that time, Sherpas and some expedition climbers set up ropes and ladders in the treacherous Khumbu Icefall.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n89. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Mt.

The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 8+1⁄2 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A view from the summit of Mount Everest in May 2013\nThe summit of Everest has been described as \"the size of a dining room table\".[250] The summit is capped with snow over ice over rock, and the layer of snow varies from year to year.[251] The rock summit is made of Ordovician limestone and is a low-grade metamorphic rock.[252] (see the Surveys section for more on its height and about the Everest rock summit)\n\n\nBelow the summit, there is an area known as \"rainbow valley\", filled with dead bodies still wearing brightly coloured winter gear. Down to about 8,000 m (26,000 ft) is an area commonly called the \"death zone\", due to the high danger and low oxygen because of the low pressure.[83]\n\n\nBelow the summit the mountain slopes downward to the three main sides, or faces, of Mount Everest: the North Face, the South-West Face, and the East/Kangshung Face.[253][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Death zone[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Effects of high altitude on humans\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTypical Nepal Camp Altitudes[228]\n| Location\n | Altitude (km)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Base camp 5400 m / 17700 ft.\n | 5.4\n | 5.4 |\n| Camp 1 6100 m / 20000 ft.\n | 6.1\n | 6.1 |\n| Camp 2 6400 m / 21000 ft.\n | 6.4\n | 6.4 |\n| Camp 3 6800m / 22300 ft.\n | 6.8\n | 6.8 |\n| Camp 4 8000 m / 26000 ft.\n | 8.0\n | 8 | 8 |\n| Summit 8848 m / 29035 ft.\n | 8.8\n | 8.8 |\n\n\n### Permits[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Nepal issued 334 climbing permits, which were extended until 2019 due to the closure.[229] In 2015, Nepal issued 357 permits, but the mountain was closed again because of the avalanche and earthquake, and these permits were given a two-year extension to 2017.[230][229][*clarification needed*]\n\n\nIn 2017, a person who tried to climb Everest without the $11,000 permit was caught after he made it past the Khumbu icefall. He faced, among other penalties, a $22,000 fine and a possible four years in jail. In the end, he was allowed to return home but banned from mountaineering in Nepal for 10 years.[231]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Mount Everest on Himalaya-Info.org (German)\n* 360 panorama view from top of Mount Everest – large dimension drawing\n* *National Geographic* site on Mount Everest\n* NOVA site on Mount Everest\n* Imaging Everest, a collection of photographs Archived 14 November 2016 at the Wayback Machine\n* Panoramas:\n\t+ North\n\t+ South\n* Interactive climb of Everest from Discovery Channel\n* Mount Everest on Summitpost\n* Full list of all ascents of Everest up to and including 2008 (in pdf format)\n* Summits and deaths per year\n* Mount Everest panorama, Mount Everest interactive panorama (QuickTime format), Virtual panoramas\n* National Geographic, 2015 article with info-graphic on climbing routes\n* Himalayan Database: Data Visualization of Mount Everest Summit, Attempt, and Death\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n288. **^** John B West (2013). *High Life: A History of High-Altitude Physiology and Medicine*.
