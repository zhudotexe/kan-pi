Microsoft initially moved onto the grounds of the campus on February 26, 1986, weeks before the company went public on March 13. The headquarters has since experienced multiple expansions since its establishment.

In November 2010 the *San Jose Mercury News* revealed[19] that Apple had bought an additional 98 acres (40 ha) no longer used by HP Inc., just north across Pruneridge Ave. This space had been the HP campus in Cupertino before it was relocated to Palo Alto.\n\n\nOn June 7, 2011, Jobs presented to the Cupertino City Council details of the architectural design of the new buildings and their surroundings.[20] He did not live to see construction begin, dying a few months later on October 5.[21]\n\n\nOn October 15, 2013, Cupertino City Council unanimously approved Apple's plans for the new campus after a six-hour debate.[22] Shortly thereafter, demolition work began to prepare the site for construction.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe headquarters also gained unfavorable attention when it emerged in 2018 that two workers had been injured and required hospital treatment after walking into the building's clear glass walls and doors.[80]\n\n\nApple received some criticism for the perceived extravagance of its new headquarters, as well as its perfectionist approach to its design and construction. The use of special wood as a construction material was reported to be the subject of a 30-page guideline.[38] The design of door handles was reported to be the subject of a one-and-a-half-year debate, involving several revisions before the Apple management gave its approval.[81] Apple's desire for custom signage put the company at odds with the Santa Clara County Fire Department, requiring several rounds of negotiations due to fears it could compromise safety in case of emergencies.[82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** \"Apple's spaceship campus, Apple Park, opens in April\". *The Verge*.

Construction began in May 2021. Apple Park Developer Center was inaugurated on June 6, 2022, during WWDC.[71]\n\n\n\n## Grounds[edit]\n\n\n### Landscaping[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Park under construction, January 2016\n80% of the campus consists of green space.[72] The spacious courtyard in the middle of the primary building was planted with apricot, olive, and apple orchards, as well as a herb garden near the cafe. Other plants selected for the campus landscape are drought tolerant. Recycled water is used to water the campus.\n\n\nIn 2011, Apple hired an arborist, Dave Muffly, to cultivate California's natural environment around Apple Park.[73] Apple's headhunters tracked down Muffly in 2010 after Jobs recognized the quality of the oak trees near the Stanford Dish and asked staff to find the arborist who was caring for them.[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe design hides the roads and parking spaces underground. The campus uses only glass for its walls and views of the inner courtyard as well as of the landscape facing the exterior of the building.[36][37] Around 83,000 square feet (7,700 m2) of space is for meetings and breakout spaces in the building. The inner part of the circular building contains a 30-acre (12 ha) park featuring a pond, with fruit trees and winding pathways inspired by California fruit orchards.\n\n\nApple brought to the construction project the same \"fanatical attention to detail\" which the company is famous for lavishing upon its products.[38] Apple insisted on extraordinarily tight tolerances, even for parts of the structure normally hidden from view.[38] Construction workers were often required to wear gloves to minimize accidental damage to surfaces.[38] All interior wood used for furniture was harvested from a certain species of maple, with Apple working with construction companies from 19 countries for designs and materials.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Apple Park Visitor Center\nApple Park Visitor Center is a two-story 20,135 sq ft (1,870.6 m2) structure with four main areas: an Apple Store[65] featuring Apple-branded merchandise (T-shirts, hats, tote bags, postcards) not sold at regular Apple stores,[66] a 2,386 sq ft (221.7 m2) café, an exhibition space which currently showcases a 3D model of Apple Park with augmented reality, and a roof terrace overlooking the campus. It opened to the public on November 17, 2017.[67][68] The estimated cost of the center is $80 million.[69] The property at 10600 North Tantau Avenue (northeast corner of Tantau and Pruneridge avenues) is across the road from the campus proper and abuts a Santa Clara residential neighborhood.[70] The underground parking garage, with close to 700 spaces, has an estimated cost of $26 million. The Visitor Center is the only part of Apple Park which tourists are permitted to visit.\n\n\n\n### Apple Park Developer Center[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)External view of the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park\nOfficially known as the Steve Jobs Theater,[2] after the co-founder and former CEO of Apple, the facility is located atop a hill on the campus. It is an underground, 1,000-seat auditorium intended for Apple product launches and press meets. It has a large above-ground cylinder-shaped lobby with stairs down to the auditorium. The theater has 350 parking spaces on North Tantau Avenue and a pedestrian path leading to the main campus located northwest of the theater.\n\n\nThe theater plays host to many types of events, from Apple Events such as product announcements, WWDC (Apple's Developers Conference), and shareholder's meetings, to special Apple Music events, such as performances by Billie Eilish and Ludovico Einaudi.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe campus is one of the most energy-efficient buildings in the world,[2] and the main building,[48] Steve Jobs Theater,[49] and fitness center[50] are all LEED Platinum certified. In an April 2018 press release, Apple announced that it had switched to being powered entirely by renewable energy.[51] The solar panels installed on the roof of the campus can generate 17 megawatts of power, sufficient to power 75% during peak daytime,[52] and making it one of the largest solar roofs of the world. The other 4 megawatts are generated onsite using Bloom Energy Server fuel cells, which are powered by biofuel or natural gas.[53] The air flows freely between the inside and outside of the building, providing natural ventilation and obviating the need for HVAC systems during nine months of the year.[2]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n### Cafés[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe facade panes are produced by Bavarian companies Josef Gartner and Sedak. The latter company is a subsidiary of Seele GmbH; Apple had previously worked with Seele, an expert on glass facades, for some of its more prominent Apple Stores such as the one on 5th Avenue in New York City.

It is located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California.\n\n\nThe original complex, with 2 million square feet (190,000 square meters) of office space, is the company's second largest square footage assemblage of Google buildings, after Google's 111 Eighth Avenue building in New York City, which the company bought in 2010.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)This restaurant is at Googleplex.\n![](image)Bicycles are used by employees at Googleplex.[21]\nThe Googleplex is located between Charleston Road, Amphitheatre Parkway, and Shoreline Boulevard in north Mountain View, California, close to the Shoreline Park wetlands. Employees living in San Francisco, the East Bay, or South Bay may take a free Wi-Fi-enabled Google shuttle to and from work. The shuttles are powered by a fuel blend of 95% petroleum diesel and 5% biodiesel and have the latest emissions reduction technology.[22][23]\n\n\nTo the north lies the Shoreline Amphitheatre and Intuit, and to the south lies Microsoft's Silicon Valley research complex, the Computer History Museum, and Century Theatres. Moffett Field is nearby to the east.\n\n\n\n## Other Google Mountain View locations[edit]\n\n\nGoogle in its 2012-year-end annual report said it had 3.5 million square feet of office space in Mountain View.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)This Google campus area is down Charleston Road from the Googleplex.\nThe former SGI facilities were leased by Google beginning in 2003.[4] A redesign of the interiors was completed by Clive Wilkinson Architects in 2005.\nIn June 2006, Google purchased some of Silicon Graphics's properties, including the Googleplex, for $319 million.[5][6]\n\n\nBecause the buildings are of relatively low height, the complex sprawls out over a large area of land. The interior of the headquarters is furnished with items like shade lamps and giant rubber balls and the lobby contains a piano and a projection of current live Google search queries. Facilities include free laundry rooms (Buildings 40, 42 & CL3), two small swimming pools, multiple sand volleyball courts, a bowing alley, massage rooms, organic gardens, and eighteen cafeterias with diverse menus. Google installed replicas of SpaceShipOne and a dinosaur skeleton.[7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGoogle planned in 2015 a 60-acre (24-hectare) addition designed by Heatherwick Studio and Bjarke Ingels in North Bayshore.[18] The site, however, was granted to LinkedIn by the city councilors and the Google project was revised in 2016, with 3 buildings to be built on 2 different sites east of Googleplex in Mountain View: one immediately next to Googleplex, and the two smaller ones a few blocks away.[19]\n\n\n\n### Google Visitor Experience[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2023, Google announced the Google Visitor Experience, a visitor center next to the Googleplex which occupies the building formerly known as Charleston East, and now known as Gradient Canopy. The visitor's center includes a brick-and-mortar Google Store, a public plaza, a café, and public art, and opened on October 12, 2023.[20]\n\n\n\n## Location[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGoogle has another large campus in Mountain View dubbed \"The Quad\" at 399 N Whisman Road about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the Googleplex.[24]\n\n\nIn 2013, Google leased the entire Mayfield Mall, an enclosed shopping mall that last operated in 1984 and was leased by Hewlett-Packard from 1986 to 2002.[25]\n\n\nThe semi-secret Google X Lab, which is the development lab for items such as Google Glass, is located in \"ordinary two-story red-brick buildings\" about 1⁄2 mile (800 meters) from the Googleplex. It has a \"burbling fountain out front and rows of company-issued bikes, which employees use to shuttle to the main campus.\"[26]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nThe Googleplex is featured in the 2013 film *The Internship*, with the Georgia Tech campus standing in as a double, because Google disallows filming on the campus grounds for privacy reasons.[27] It was the inspiration for the fictional Hooli headquarters in the HBO TV series *Silicon Valley*.[28]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Spivack, Cari (September 13, 2004). \"Worth the drive\". *Official Google Blog*.
