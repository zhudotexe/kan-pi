The war would be determined on the continent, and the major land operations that sealed the swift French victory involved the Ulm Campaign, a large wheeling manoeuvre by the *Grande Armée* lasting from late August to mid-October 1805 that captured an entire Austrian army, and the decisive French victory over a combined Austro-Russian force under Alexander I of Russia at the Battle of Austerlitz in early December. Austerlitz effectively brought the Third Coalition to an end, although later there was a small side campaign against Naples, which also resulted in a decisive French victory at the Battle of Campo Tenese.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAusterlitz had driven neither Russia nor Britain, whose fleet protected Sicily from a French invasion, to cease fighting. Meanwhile, Prussian worries about the growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806.\n\n\n\n\n## Periodisation[edit]\n\n\nHistorians differ on when the War of the Third Coalition began and when it ended. From the British perspective, the war started when Britain declared war on France on 18 May 1803, but it was still on its own. It was not until December 1804 when Sweden entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom, not until 11 April 1805 when Russia joined the alliance, not until 16 July when Britain and Russia ratified their treaty of alliance, and only thereafter Austria (9 August) and Naples–Sicily (11 September) completed the fully-fledged coalition.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Austrian Empire:**20,000 killed or wounded70,000 captured**Russia:**25,000 killed or wounded25,000 captured**Naples:**20,000 killed, wounded or captured**Total casualties:**160,000 killed, wounded or captured | **France:**13,500 killed37,000 wounded5,000 captured**Italy:**350 killed1,900 wounded**Spain:**1,200 killed1,600 wounded**Bavaria:**300 killed1,200 wounded\n\n---\n\n**Total casualties:**62,050 killed, wounded or captured |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWar of the Third Coalition\n |\n| --- |\n| German campaign\n* Bavaria\n* **Ulm campaign**\n\t+ Donauwörth\n\t+ Wertingen\n\t+ Günzburg\n\t+ Haslach-Jungingen\n\t+ Memmingen\n\t+ Elchingen\n\t+ Ulm\n* Mehrnbach\n* Lambach\n* Steyr\n* Amstetten\n* Mariazell\n* Dürenstein\n* Dornbirn\n* Schöngrabern\n* Hanover\n* Wischau\n* **Austerlitz**\n\n\nItalian campaign\n* Verona\n* Caldiero\n* Forano\n* Caldiero pursuit\n* Castelfranco Veneto\n\n\nInvasion of Naples\n* Gaeta\n* Campo Tenese\n* Maida\n* Calabria\n* Mileto\n\n\nTrafalgar campaign\n* Diamond Rock\n* Cape Finisterre\n* **Trafalgar**\n* Cape Ortegal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMeanwhile, Bavaria sided with France on 25 August, and Württemberg joined Napoleon on 5 September. No major hostilities between France and any member of the coalition other than Britain (Trafalgar campaign March–November 1805) occurred until the Ulm Campaign (25 September – 20 October 1805). This was in part because Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom was not called off until 27 August 1805, when he decided to use his invasion force camped at Boulogne against Austria instead.[1]\n\n\nLikewise, no major battles occurred after the Battle of Austerlitz and the signing of the Peace of Pressburg on 26 December 1805, which forced Austria to leave the Third Coalition and cease hostilities against France. Some historians conclude that Austria's departure \"shattered the fragile Third Coalition\"[1] and \"ended the War of the Third Coalition\".[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis narrative leaves out the subsequent French invasion of Naples (February–July 1806), which the occupying Anglo-Russian troops hastily evacuated and the remaining Neapolitan forces relatively quickly surrendered. Other scholars argue the southern Italian campaign should be included into the War of the Second Coalition, and criticise ignoring the Mediterranean front by only focusing on land battles in Central Europe and the Trafalgar campaign.[3]\n\n\n\n## Prelude[edit]\n\n\nEurope had been embroiled in the French Revolutionary Wars since 1792. After five years of war, the French Republic subdued the armies of the First Coalition in 1797. A Second Coalition was formed in 1798, but this too was defeated by 1801, leaving Britain the only opponent of the new French Consulate.[4]\n\n\n\n### From Amiens to the Third Coalition[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| France,client statesand allies | * France\n* Polish Legions\n* Italy\n* Holland\n* Etruria\n* Swiss Confederation\n* Naples\n* Confederation of the Rhine\n\t+ Bavaria\n\t+ Saxony\n\t+ Westphalia\n\t+ Württemberg\n* Denmark–Norway\n* Ottoman Empire\n* Persia\n* Spain\n |\n| Coalitionforces | * United Kingdom\n* Austria\n* Russia\n* Prussia\n* Spain\n* Portugal\n* Sicily\n* Papal States\n* Ottoman Empire\n* Persia\n* Sardinia\n* Sweden\n* Netherlands\n* Brunswick\n* Hanover\n* Nassau\n* French Royalists\n |\n\n |\n| Majorbattles | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the surrender, Masséna was ordered south by Joseph to support Reynier's II Corps against the British and the Calabrian insurrection. Now severely outnumbered in mainland Italy, the British retreated back to Sicily. However, the revolt was not suppressed until 1807, by which time Masséna had already requested permission to relinquish command. For the first time in the Napoleonic Wars, the French experienced a brutal guerrilla war carried on by a rebellious population. The French gleaned that the only effective way to deal with such an uprising was to implement terror tactics employed by Reynier. This foreshadowed the same problems the French, and in particular Joseph Bonaparte, would face in Spain during the Peninsular War.\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\n![](image)All the participants of the War of the Third Coalition.

The Russians were still using the old style Julian calendar, while the Austrians had adopted the new style Gregorian calendar, and by 1805 a difference of 12 days existed between the two systems. Confusion is purported to have ensued from the differing timetables regarding when the Allied forces should combine, leading to an inevitable breakdown in mutual coordination.[18] However, this tale is not supported in a contemporary account from a major-general of the Austrian army, who tells of a joint advance of the Russian and Austrian forces (in which he himself took part) five days before the Battle of Austerlitz,[19]\nand it is explicitly rejected in Goetz's recent book-length study of the battle.[20]\n\n\n\n## Ulm campaign[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Ulm Campaign\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| French and allymilitary andpolitical leaders | * Napoleon\n* Louis-Alexandre Berthier\n* Joachim Murat\n* Louis-Nicolas Davout\n* Jean Lannes\n* Auguste de Marmont\n* André Masséna\n* Michel Ney\n* Jean-de-Dieu Soult\n* Marshal Victor\n* Jean-Baptiste Bessières\n* Pierre-Charles Villeneuve\n* Joseph I\n* Louis Bonaparte\n* Jérôme Bonaparte\n* Prince Poniatowski\n* Prince Eugène\n* Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria\n* Frederick Augustus I of Saxony\n* Frederick I of Württemberg\n* Frederick VI of Denmark\n |\n| Coalitionmilitary andpolitical leaders | * Duke of Wellington\n* Rowland Hill\n* John Moore\n* Horatio Nelson\n* Thomas Cochrane\n* Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor\n* Manuel Lapeña\n* Archduke Charles\n* Prince von Schwarzenberg\n* Archduke John of Austria\n* Alexander I of Russia\n* Mikhail Kutuzov\n* Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly\n* Count Bennigsen\n* Pyotr Bagration\n* Peter Wittgenstein\n* Frederick William III of Prussia\n* Gebhard von Blücher\n* Duke of Brunswick\n* Prince of Hohenlohe\n* Ferdinand VII of Spain\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Miguel de Álava\n* Maria I of Portugal\n* Prince Regent John of Portugal\n* Count of Feira\n* William, Prince of Orange\n* Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies\n* Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden\n* Prince Charles John of Sweden\n* Louis XVIII\n |\n| Relatedconflicts | * Anglo-Russian War\n* Anglo-Spanish War\n* Anglo-Swedish War\n* Anglo-Turkish War\n* Anglo-Danish War\n\t+ Gunboat War\n* Dano-Swedish War\n* Russo-Swedish War (Finnish War)\n* Franco-Swedish War (Pomeranian War)\n* Russo-Persian War\n* Russo-Turkish War\n* Spanish American wars of independence\n* Swedish–Norwegian War\n* War of 1812\n |\n| Treaties | * Campo Formio\n* Lunéville\n* Amiens\n* Artlenburg\n* Pressburg\n* Finckenstein\n* Tilsit\n* Cintra\n* Schönbrunn\n* Paris (1810)\n* Paris (February 1812)\n* Paris (March 1812)\n* Paris (1814)\n* Tauroggen\n* Ried\n* Chaumont\n* Kiel\n* Mantua\n* Casalanza\n* Fontainebleau (1814)\n* Paris (1815)\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Bibliography\n* Bourbon Restoration\n* Casualties\n* Congress of Erfurt\n* Continental System\n* Conference of Dresden\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n58. **^** Chandler p. 425.\n59. **^** Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 49–50.\n60. **^** Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 51.\n61. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 52.\n62. **^** Chandler p. 432.\n63. **^** Spring, Laurence, *Russian Grenadiers and Infantry, 1799–1815*, Osprey Publishing 2002[*ISBN missing*][*page needed*]\n64. **^** Schneid, Frederick (2002). *NAPOLEON'S ITALIAN CAMPAIGNS 1805-1815*.

He was also the last Swedish monarch to be the ruler of Finland.\n\n\nThe occupation of Finland in 1808–09 by Russian forces was the immediate cause of Gustav's violent overthrow by officers of his own army. Following his abdication on 29 March 1809, an Instrument of Government was hastily written, which severely circumscribed the powers of the monarchy. The \"Instrument\" was adopted in 1809 on 6 June, the National Day of Sweden now as well as in his time. It remained in force until replaced in 1974. The crown, now with strictly limited powers, passed to Gustav's uncle Charles XIII, who had no legitimate children; this want of heirs set into motion the quest for a successor, who was found the following year in the person of Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, the first monarch of the present royal family.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gustav Adolf at the age of seven\nGustav Adolf was born in Stockholm. He was the son of Gustav III of Sweden by his wife queen Sophia Magdalena. His mother, Sophia Magdalena, was eldest daughter of Frederick V of Denmark and his first wife Louise of Great Britain.\n\n\nGustav Adolf was under the tutelage of Hedvig Sofia von Rosen and her deputies Brita Ebba Celestina von Stauden and Maria Aurora Uggla until the age of four. He was then raised under the tutelage of his father and the liberal-minded Nils von Rosenstein. Upon Gustav III's assassination in March 1792, Gustav Adolf succeeded to the throne at the age of 13, under the regency of his uncle, Prince Charles, Duke of Södermanland, who was later to become King Charles XIII of Sweden when his nephew was forced to abdicate and was banished from the country in 1809.\n\n\nIn August 1796, his uncle the regent arranged for the young king to visit Saint Petersburg. The intention was to arrange a marriage between the young king and Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna, a granddaughter of Catherine the Great. However, the whole arrangement foundered on Gustav's unwavering refusal to allow his intended bride liberty of worship according to the rites of the Russian Orthodox Church. Nobody seems to have suspected the possibility at the time that emotional problems might lie at the root of Gustav's abnormal piety. On the contrary, when he came of age that year, thereby ending the regency, there were many who prematurely congratulated themselves on the fact that Sweden had now no disturbing genius, but an economical, God-fearing, commonplace monarch.[3]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nGustav Adolf's prompt dismissal of the generally detested Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm, the duke-regent's leading advisor, added still further to his popularity. On 31 October 1797 Gustav married Friederike Dorothea, granddaughter of Karl Friedrich, Margrave of Baden, a marriage which seemed to threaten war with Russia but for the fanatical hatred of the French republic shared by the Emperor Paul of Russia and Gustav IV Adolf, which served as a bond between them. Indeed, the king's horror of Jacobinism was intense, and drove him to become increasingly committed to the survival of Europe, to the point where he postponed his coronation for some years, so as to avoid calling together a diet. Nonetheless, the disorder of the state finances, largely inherited from Gustav III's war against Russia, as well as widespread crop failures in 1798 and 1799, compelled him to summon the estates to Norrköping in March 1800 and on 3 April the same year.[3] When the king encountered serious opposition at the Riksdag, he resolved never to call another.\n\n\n\n## Loss of Finland[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Finnish War\n\nHis reign was ill-fated and was to end abruptly. In 1805, he joined the Third Coalition \nagainst Napoleon. His campaign went poorly and the French occupied Swedish Pomerania. When his ally, Russia, made peace and concluded an alliance with France at Tilsit in 1807, Sweden and Portugal were left as Great Britain's only allies on the European continent. On 21 February 1808, Russia invaded Finland, which was ruled by Sweden, on the pretext of compelling Sweden to join Napoleon's Continental System. Denmark likewise declared war on Sweden.[*citation needed*] In just a few months, almost all of Finland was lost to Russia. As a result of the war, on 17 September 1809, in the Treaty of Fredrikshamn, Sweden surrendered the eastern third of Sweden to Russia. Following which the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was established within Imperial Russia.\n\n\n\n## Coup d'état and abdication[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gustav IV Adolf's arrest\nGustav Adolf's inept and erratic leadership[*citation needed*] in diplomacy and war precipitated his deposition through a conspiracy of army officers.\n\n\nOn 7 March 1809, lieutenant-colonel Georg Adlersparre, commander of a part of the so-called western army stationed in Värmland, triggered the Coup of 1809 by raising the flag of rebellion in Karlstad and starting to march upon Stockholm. To prevent the king from joining loyal troops in Scania, on 13 March 1809 seven of the conspirators led by Carl Johan Adlercreutz broke into the royal apartments in the palace, seized the king, and imprisoned him and his family in Gripsholm castle; the king's uncle, Duke Charles (Karl), was thereupon persuaded to accept the leadership of a provisional government, which was proclaimed the same day; and a diet, hastily summoned, solemnly approved of the revolution.[3]\n\n\nOn 29 March Gustav IV Adolf, to save the crown for his son, voluntarily abdicated; but on 10 May the Riksdag of the Estates, dominated by the army, declared that not merely Gustav but his whole family had forfeited the throne,[3] perhaps an excuse to exclude his family from succession based on the rumours of his illegitimacy. A more likely cause, however, is that the revolutionaries feared that Gustav's son, if he inherited the throne, would avenge his father's deposition when he came of age. On 5 June, Gustav's uncle was proclaimed King Charles XIII, after accepting a new liberal constitution, which was ratified by the diet the next day. In December, Gustav and his family were transported to Germany. In 1812, he divorced his wife.\n\n\nIn exile Gustav used several titles, including Count Gottorp and Duke of Holstein-Eutin, and finally settled at St. Gallen in Switzerland where he lived in a small hotel in great loneliness and indigence,[3] under the name of Colonel Gustafsson. It was there that he suffered a stroke and died. He was buried in Moravia. At the suggestion of King Oscar II of Sweden his body was finally brought to Sweden and interred in Riddarholm Church.\n\n\n\n\n## Arms[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Coat of Arms of King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden\n |\n\n\n## Ancestry[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Crown Prince Gustav, after 1809 known as *Gustaf Gustafsson, Prince of Vasa* (9 November 1799 – 1877). He served as an officer in the service of the Habsburgs of Austria, and with his wife Princess Louise Amelie of Baden, fathered a son who died in infancy, and a daughter, Carola, the wife of Albert, King of Saxony. She died childless.\n2. Princess Sofia Wilhelmina (21 May 1801 – 1865). She married Grand Duke Leopold of Baden, and their granddaughter Victoria of Baden married the Bernadotte king Gustaf V of Sweden. (The present King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden is thus Gustav IV's heir.)\n3. Prince Carl Gustaf, Grand Duke of Finland, Duke of Småland (2 December 1802 – 10 September 1805)\n4. Princess Amalia (22 February 1805 – 31 August 1853); unmarried and without issue\n5. Princess Cecilia (22 June 1807 – 1844); married Augustus, Grand Duke of Oldenburg, and had issue.\n\n\nBy 1812, Gustav Adolf divorced his consort, and following this he had several mistresses, among them Maria Schlegel, who gave him a son, Adolf Gustafsson.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Gustavian era\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** David Williamson in *Debrett's Kings and Queens of Europe* ISBN 0-86350-194-X pp. 125, 134, 194, 207\n2. **^** Cronholm, Neander N.

He was the eldest son of Emperor Paul I and Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlexander became Emperor of Russia when his father was assassinated 23 March 1801. Alexander, then 23 years old, was in the Saint Michael's Castle at the moment of the assassination and his accession to the throne was announced by General Nicholas Zubov, one of the assassins. Historians still debate Alexander's role in his father's murder. The most common theory is that he was let into the conspirators' secret and was willing to take the throne but insisted that his father should not be killed. Becoming emperor through a crime that cost his father's life would give Alexander a strong sense of remorse and shame.[20]\n\n\nAlexander I succeeded to the throne on 23 March 1801[21] and was crowned in the Kremlin on 15 September of that year.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Domestic policy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Equestrian portrait of Alexander I by Franz Krüger\nSee also: Abolition of serfdom in Livonia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany believe that Tsar Alexander I faked his death and lived as a hermit by name of Feodor Kuzmich. Although this fact is debated by historians and some historians just reject the legend, However popular writers resurrect them often.[61] The main claim for the belief that Alexander I faked his death are curious similarities between Alexander and Kuzmich. Svetlana Semyonova, president of Russian Graphological Society, analyzed both Alexander's and Kuzmich's handwriting and concluded that they are the same. Furthermore, there are rumors that Alexander's wife also faked her death a year after Alexander's death and became a nun in Saint Petersburg. On the death bead of Feodor Kuzmich the priest reportedly asked him if he was in fact the Alexander the Blessed. In response, Kuzmich said, \"Your works are wonderful, Lord ... There is no secret, which is not opened.\"[62]\n\n\n\n## Children[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith his mental health deteriorating, Alexander grew increasingly suspicious of those around him, more withdrawn, more religious, and more passive. Some historians conclude his profile \"coincides precisely with the schizophrenic prototype: a withdrawn, seclusive, rather shy, introvertive, unaggressive, and somewhat apathetic individual\".[56][57][58] In the autumn of 1825 the Emperor undertook a voyage to the south of Russia due to the increasing illness of his wife. During his trip he himself caught typhus, from which he died in the southern city of Taganrog on 19 November 1825(Old Style). However, his death wouldn't fully be known until December, due to Taganrog being far from the capital or any other large city. [59] His two brothers disputed who would become tsar—each wanted the other to do so. His wife died a few months later as the emperor's body was transported to Saint Petersburg for the funeral. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEmperor of Russia from 1801 to 1825\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Alexander I |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Portrait by George Dawe, c. 1825-29\n |\n| Emperor of Russia |\n| Reign | 23 March 1801 – 1 December 1825 |\n| Coronation | 15 (27) September 1801 |\n| Predecessor | Paul I |\n| Successor | Nicholas IKonstantin (disputed) |\n|  |\n| Born | (1777-12-23)23 December 1777Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire |\n| Died | 1 December 1825(1825-12-01) (aged 47)[1]Taganrog, Russian Empire |\n| Burial | 13 March 1826Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, Saint Petersburg\n |\n| Spouse | \nLouise of Baden\n ​\n(m. 1793)​\n |\n| Issue*more...* | Nikolai Lukash (illegitimate) |\n| \n\n| Names |\n| --- |\n| Alexander Pavlovich Romanov |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe son of Grand Duke Paul Petrovich, later Paul I, Alexander succeeded to the throne after his father was murdered. He ruled Russia during the chaotic period of the Napoleonic Wars. As prince and during the early years of his reign, Alexander often used liberal rhetoric, but continued Russia's absolutist policies in practice. In the first years of his reign, he initiated some minor social reforms and (in 1803–04) major liberal educational reforms, such as building more universities. Alexander appointed Mikhail Speransky, the son of a village priest, as one of his closest advisors. The Collegia were abolished and replaced by the State Council, which was created to improve legislation. Plans were also made to set up a parliament and sign a constitution. Alexander also was hostile towards European powers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 9 October 1793, Alexander married Louise of Baden, known as Elizabeth Alexeievna after her conversion to the Orthodox Church. He later told his friend Frederick William III that the marriage, a political match devised by his grandmother, Catherine the Great, regrettably proved to be a misfortune for him and his spouse.[15] Their two children died young,[54] though their common sorrow drew the spouses closer together. Towards the end of Alexander's life their reconciliation was completed by the wise charity of the Empress in sympathising deeply with him over the death of his beloved daughter Sophia Naryshkina, the daughter of his mistress Maria Naryshkina,[15] with whom he had a relationship from 1799 until 1818. In 1809, Alexander I was widely and famously rumoured to have had an affair with the Finnish noblewoman Ulla Möllersvärd and to have had a child by her, but this is not confirmed.[55]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the second half of his reign, Alexander became increasingly arbitrary, reactionary, and fearful of plots against him; as a result he ended many of the reforms he made earlier. He purged schools of foreign teachers, as education became more religiously driven as well as politically conservative.[3] Speransky was replaced as advisor with the strict artillery inspector Aleksey Arakcheyev, who oversaw the creation of military settlements. Alexander died of typhus in December 1825 while on a trip to southern Russia. He left no legitimate children, as his two daughters died in childhood. Neither of his brothers wanted to become emperor. After a period of great confusion (that presaged the failed Decembrist revolt of liberal army officers in the weeks after his death), he was succeeded by his younger brother, Nicholas I.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Nikolai Yevgenyevich Lukash | 11 December 1796 | 20 January 1868 | Married Princess Alexandra and had issue.

Alexander disliked him as emperor even more than he did his grandmother. He wrote that Russia had become a \"plaything for the insane\" and that \"absolute power disrupts everything\". It is likely that seeing two previous rulers abuse their autocratic powers in such a way pushed him to be one of the more progressive Romanov tsars of the 19th and 20th centuries. Among the rest of the country, Paul was widely unpopular. He accused his wife of conspiring to become another Catherine and seize power from him as his mother did from his father. He also suspected Alexander of conspiring against him, despite his son's earlier refusal to seize power from Paul.[19]\n\n\n\n## Emperor[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Russia (violet) and other European empires in 1800\n### Ascension[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlexander was born at 10:45, on 23 December 1777 in Saint Petersburg,[4] and he and his younger brother Constantine were raised by their grandmother, Catherine.[5] He was baptized on 31 December[6] in Grand Church of the Winter Palace[7] by mitred archpriest[8] Ioann Ioannovich Panfilov[9] (confessor of Empress Catherine II),[10] his godmother was Catherine the Great and his godfathers were Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, and Frederick the Great.[11] He was named after Saint Petersburg patron saint - Alexander Nevsky.[12] Some sources[13] allege that she planned to remove her son (Alexander's father) Paul I from the succession altogether. From the free-thinking atmosphere of the court of Catherine and his Swiss tutor, Frédéric-César de La Harpe, he imbibed the principles of Rousseau's gospel of humanity. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe made some effort to reconcile the principles at conflict in his mind. The Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II had been excluded from the Holy Alliance under the principle that the affairs of the East were the \"domestic concerns of Russia\" rather than of the concert of Europe; but Alexander now offered to surrender this claim and act \"as the mandatory of Europe,\" as Austria had acted in Naples, but still to march as a Christian liberator into the Ottoman Empire.[27]\n\n\nMetternich's opposition to this assertion of Russian power, putting the Austrian-led balance of power above the interests of Christendom, first opened Alexander's eyes to the true character of Austria's attitude towards his ideals. Once more in Russia, far from the fascination of Metternich's personality, he was once again moved by the aspirations of his people.[27]\n\n\nIn 1823 the 1817–1824 cholera pandemic reached Astrakhan and the Tsar ordered an anti-cholera campaign that was imitated in other countries.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n|  | 14.

In 1805 he joined Britain in the War of the Third Coalition against Napoleon, but after suffering massive defeats at the battles of Austerlitz and Friedland, he switched sides and formed an alliance with Napoleon by the Treaty of Tilsit (1807) and joined Napoleon's Continental System. He fought a small-scale naval war against Britain between 1807 and 1812 as well as a short war against Sweden (1808–09) after Sweden's refusal to join the Continental System. Alexander and Napoleon hardly agreed, especially regarding Poland, and the alliance collapsed by 1810. Alexander's greatest triumph came in 1812 when Napoleon's invasion of Russia proved to be a catastrophic disaster for the French. As part of the winning coalition against Napoleon, he gained territory in Finland and Poland. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Meeting of Napoleon and Alexander I in Tilsit, a 19th-century painting by Adolphe Roehn\nEvents were rapidly heading towards the rupture of the Franco-Russian alliance. While Alexander assisted Napoleon in the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809, he declared plainly that he would not allow the Austrian Empire to be crushed out of existence. Napoleon subsequently complained bitterly of the inactivity of the Russian troops during the campaign. The tsar in turn protested against Napoleon's encouragement of the Poles. In the matter of the French alliance he knew himself to be practically isolated in Russia, and he declared that he could not sacrifice the interest of his people and empire to his affection for Napoleon. \"I don't want anything for myself\", he said to the French ambassador, \"therefore the world is not large enough to come to an understanding on the affairs of Poland, if it is a question of its restoration\".[31][32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlexander wanted to resolve another crucial issue in Russia, the status of the serfs, although this was not achieved until 1861 (during the reign of his nephew Alexander II). His advisors quietly discussed the options at length. Cautiously, he extended the right to own land to most classes of subjects, including state-owned peasants, in 1801 and created a new social category of \"free agriculturalist,\" for peasants voluntarily emancipated by their masters, in 1803. The great majority of serfs were not affected.[24]\n\n\nWhen Alexander's reign began, there were three universities in Russia, at Moscow, Vilna (Vilnius), and Dorpat (Tartu). These were strengthened, and three others were founded at St. Petersburg, Kharkiv, and Kazan. Literary and scientific bodies were established or encouraged, and his reign became noted for the aid lent to the sciences and arts by the Emperor and the wealthy nobility. Alexander later expelled foreign scholars.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA party too in Russia itself, headed by the Tsar's brother Constantine Pavlovich, was clamorous for peace; but Alexander, after a vain attempt to form a new coalition, summoned the Russian nation to a holy war against Napoleon as the enemy of the Orthodox faith. The outcome was the rout of Friedland (13/14 June 1807). Napoleon saw his chance and seized it. Instead of demanding harsh peace terms, he offered to the chastened autocrat his alliance, and a partnership in his glory.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) Austrian Empire: Knight of the Military Order of Maria Theresa, *1815*[81]\n* ![](image) Netherlands: Grand Cross of the Military William Order, *19 November 1818*[82]\n* ![](image) Kingdom of Sardinia: Knight of the Annunciation, *5 November 1822*[83]\n* ![](image) Kingdom of Portugal: Grand Cross of the Sash of the Three Orders, *10 February 1824*[84]\n* ![](image) Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach: Grand Cross of the White Falcon[85]\n\n## Ancestry[edit]\n\n\n| Ancestors of Alexander I of Russia |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Alexander I by Lawrence (1814-18, Royal collection)Once a supporter of limited liberalism, as seen in his approval of the representative institutions in the Ionian Islands, Grand Duchy of Finland and the Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland in 1815,[49][50] from the end of the year 1818 Alexander's views began to change. A revolutionary conspiracy among the officers of the Russian Imperial Guard, and a plot to kidnap him on his way to the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle, are said to have shaken his liberal beliefs. At Aix he came for the first time into intimate contact with Metternich. From this time dates the ascendancy of Metternich over the mind of the Russian Emperor and in the councils of Europe. It was, however, no case of sudden conversion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Confirmation of Alexander's wife Elizabeth Alexeievna\n![](image)Portrait of Grand Duke Alexander Pavlovich, 1800, by Vladimir Borovikovsky\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother personal grievance for Alexander towards Napoleon was the annexation of Oldenburg by France in December 1810, as Wilhelm, Duke of Oldenburg (3 January 1754 – 2 July 1823) was the uncle of the tsar. Furthermore, the disastrous impact of the Continental System on Russian trade made it impossible for the emperor to maintain a policy that was Napoleon's chief motive for the alliance.[33]\n\n\nAlexander kept Russia as neutral as possible in the ongoing French war with Britain, Russia's own war with Britain barely any more than nominal. He allowed trade to continue secretly with Britain and did not enforce the blockade required by the Continental System.[34] In 1810, he withdrew Russia from the Continental System and trade between Britain and Russia grew.[35]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHeirs to the Russian throne\n |\n| --- |\n| Tsardom of Russia (1547–1721) / ![](image) Russian Empire (1721–1917)\n |\n| Tsareviches1 | * Dmitry (1552–53)\n* Ivan (1554–81)\n* **Feodor** (1581–84)\n* *Dmitry*2\n* **Feodor** (1598–1605)\n* *Ivan*3\n* **Alexis** (1629–45)\n* Dmitry (1648–49)\n* Alexis (1654–70)\n* **Feodor** (1670–76)\n* **Ivan** (1676–81)\n* Ilya (1681)\n* Alexei (1690–1718)\n |\n| Without special title | * **Ivan** (1740)\n* **Peter** (1742–62)\n |\n| Tsesareviches | * **Paul** (1762–96)\n* **Alexander** (1796–1801)\n* Konstantin (1801–23)\n* **Nicholas** (1823–25)\n* **Alexander** (1825–55)\n* Nicholas (1855–65)\n* **Alexander** (1865–81)\n* **Nicholas** (1881–94)\n* George (1894–99)\n* Michael (1899–1904)\n* Alexei (1904–17)\n |\n| * 1Title of *Tsarevich* was used for all Tsar's sons from the times of Ivan IV to Peter I.

The Russian court went into mourning for the last member of the House of Condé, and diplomatic relations with France were broken off.

He offered generous terms to the French and although having intended to avenge Moscow,[46] he declared himself to be bringing peace to France rather than its destruction. On 31 March[47] Talleyrand gave the key of the city to the tsar. Later that day the Coalition armies triumphantly entered the city with Alexander at the head of the army followed by the King of Prussia and Prince Schwarzenberg. Until this battle it had been nearly 400 years since a foreign army had entered Paris, during the Hundred Years' War.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile the Russian army retreated deep into Russia for almost three months, the nobility pressured Alexander to relieve the commander of the Russian army, Field Marshal Barclay de Tolly. Alexander complied and appointed Prince Mikhail Kutuzov to take over command of the army. On 7 September, the Grande Armée faced the Russian army at a small village called Borodino, 110 kilometres (70 mi) west of Moscow. The battle that followed was the largest and bloodiest single-day action of the Napoleonic Wars, involving more than 250,000 soldiers and resulting in 70,000 casualties. The outcome of the battle was inconclusive. The Russian army, undefeated in spite of heavy losses, was able to withdraw the following day, leaving the French without the decisive victory Napoleon sought.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Imperial monogram of Alexander I\nCalled an autocrat and \"Jacobin\",[14] a man of the world and a mystic, Alexander appeared to his contemporaries as a riddle which each read according to his own temperament. Napoleon Bonaparte thought him a \"shifty Byzantine\",[14] and called him the Talma of the North, as ready to play any conspicuous part. To Metternich he was a madman to be humoured. Castlereagh, writing of him to Lord Liverpool, gave him credit for \"grand qualities\", but added that he is \"suspicious and undecided\";[14] and to Jefferson he was a man of estimable character, disposed to do good, and expected to diffuse through the mass of the Russian people \"a sense of their natural rights\".[26] In 1803, Beethoven dedicated his Opus 30 Violin Sonatas to Alexander who in response gave the famous composer a diamond at the Congress of Vienna where they met in 1814.\n\n\n\n### Napoleonic Wars[edit]\n\n\n#### Alliances with other powers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA few years into his reign the liberal Mikhail Speransky became one of the emperor's closest advisors, and he drew up many plans for elaborate reforms. In the Government reform of Alexander I the old Collegia were abolished and new Ministries were created in their place, led by ministers responsible to the Crown. A Council of Ministers under the chairmanship of the Sovereign dealt with all interdepartmental matters. The State Council was created to improve the technique of legislation. It was intended to become the Second Chamber of a representative legislature. The Governing Senate was reorganized as the Supreme Court of the Empire. The codification of the laws initiated in 1801 was never carried out during his reign.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n- Peter III\n\n- Catherine II\n\n- Paul I\n\n- Alexander I\n\n- Nicholas I\n\n- Alexander II\n\n- Alexander III\n\n- Nicholas II\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Alexander, Francis I of Austria and Frederick William III of Prussia meeting after the Battle of Leipzig, 1813\nWith the Russian army following up victory over Napoleon in 1812, the Sixth Coalition was formed with Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sweden, Spain, and other nations. Although the French were victorious in the initial battles during the campaign in Germany, the entry of Austria into the war led to France's decisive defeat at the Battle of Leipzig in the autumn of 1813, which proved to be a massive victory for the Coalition. Following the battle, the Pro-French Confederation of the Rhine collapsed, thereby ending Napoleon's hold on territory east of the Rhine forever. Alexander, being the supreme commander of the Coalition forces in the theatre and the paramount monarch among the three main Coalition monarchs, ordered all Coalition forces in Germany to cross the Rhine and invade France.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe very proclamations which denounced Napoleon as \"the genius of evil\", denounced him in the name of \"liberty,\" and of \"enlightenment\".[33] Conservatives suspected Alexander of a monstrous intrigue by which the eastern autocrat would ally with the Jacobinism of all Europe, aiming at an all-powerful Russia in place of an all-powerful France. At the Congress of Vienna Alexander's attitude accentuated this distrust. Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, whose single-minded aim was the restoration of \"a just equilibrium\" in Europe, reproached the Tsar to his face for a \"conscience\" which led him to imperil the concert of the powers by keeping his hold on Poland in violation of his treaty obligation.[48]\n\n\n\n### Liberal political views[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Orthodox Church initially exercised little influence on Alexander's life. The young emperor was determined to reform the inefficient, highly centralised systems of government that Russia relied upon. While retaining for a time the old ministers, one of the first acts of his reign was to appoint the Private Committee, comprising young and enthusiastic friends of his own—Viktor Kochubey, Nikolay Novosiltsev, Pavel Stroganov and Adam Jerzy Czartoryski—to draw up a plan of domestic reform, which was supposed to result in the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in accordance with the teachings of the Age of Enlightenment.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMeanwhile, Napoleon, a little deterred by the Russian autocrat's youthful ideology, never gave up hope of detaching him from the coalition. He had no sooner entered Vienna in triumph than he opened negotiations with Alexander; he resumed them after the Battle of Austerlitz (2 December). Russia and France, he urged, were \"geographical allies\";[27] there was, and could be, between them no true conflict of interests; together they might rule the world. But Alexander was still determined \"to persist in the system of disinterestedness in respect of all the states of Europe which he had thus far followed\",[27] and he again allied himself with the Kingdom of Prussia. The campaign of Jena and the Battle of Eylau followed; and Napoleon, though still intent on the Russian alliance, stirred up Poles, Turks and Persians to break the obstinacy of the Tsar. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_mDh0Ax1IpJFquWYo3ZLLrBFx","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He was also King of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia, and served as the first president of the German Confederation following its establishment in 1815.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe eldest son of future Emperor Leopold II and Maria Luisa of Spain, Francis was born in Florence, where his father ruled as Grand Duke of Tuscany. Leopold became Holy Roman Emperor in 1790 but died two years later, and Francis succeeded him. His empire immediately became embroiled in the French Revolutionary Wars, the first of which ended in Austrian defeat and the loss of the left bank of Rhine to France. After another French victory in the War of the Second Coalition, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French. In response, Francis assumed the title of Emperor of Austria. He continued his leading role as Napoleon's adversary in the Napoleonic Wars, and suffered successive defeats that greatly weakened Austria as a European power. In 1806, after Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, Francis abdicated as Holy Roman Emperor, which in effect marked the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe added that \"we hereby decree that we regard the bond which until now tied us to the states of the Empire as dissolved\"[11] in effect dissolving the empire. At the same time he declared the complete and formal withdrawal of his hereditary lands from imperial jurisdiction.[12] After that date, he reigned as Francis I, Emperor of Austria.\n\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of Francis I, by Thomas Lawrence, c. 1818–19\nIn 1809, Francis attacked France again, hoping to take advantage of the Peninsular War embroiling Napoleon in Spain. He was again defeated, and this time forced to ally himself with Napoleon, ceding territory to the Empire, joining the Continental System, and wedding his daughter Marie-Louise to the Emperor. The Napoleonic wars drastically weakened Austria, making it entirely landlocked and threatened its preeminence among the states of Germany, a position that it would eventually cede to the Kingdom of Prussia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the death of Joseph II in 1790, Francis' father became Emperor. He had an early taste of power while acting as Leopold's deputy in Vienna while the incoming Emperor traversed the Empire attempting to win back those alienated by his brother's policies.[6] The strain took a toll on Leopold and by the winter of 1791, he became ill. He gradually worsened throughout early 1792; on the afternoon of 1 March Leopold died, at the relatively young age of 44. Francis, just past his 24th birthday, was now Emperor, much sooner than he had expected.\n\n\n\n## Emperor[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo increase patriotic sentiment during the war with France, the anthem \"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser\" was composed in 1797 to be sung as the Kaiserhymne to music by Joseph Haydn.[25] The lyrics were adapted for later Emperors and the music lives on as the German national anthem \"Deutschlandlied\".\n\n\n\n## Later years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of an aging Francis II, by Friedrich von Amerling, c. 1832\nOn 2 March 1835, 43 years and a day after his father's death, Francis died in Vienna of a sudden fever aged 67, in the presence of many of his family and with all the religious comforts.[26] His funeral was magnificent, with his Viennese subjects respectfully filing past his coffin in the court chapel of the Hofburg palace[27] for three days.[28] Francis was interred in the traditional resting place of Habsburg monarchs, the Imperial Crypt in Vienna's Neue Markt Square. He is buried in tomb number 57, surrounded by his four wives.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Emperor Francis I. of Austria (1768-1835) wearing the Austrian imperial robes, by Friedrich von Amerling, c. 1832\nFrancis presented himself as an open and approachable monarch (he regularly set aside two mornings each week to meet with his imperial subjects, regardless of status, by appointment in his office, even speaking to them in their own language),[23] but his will was sovereign. In 1804, he had no compunction about announcing that through his authority as Holy Roman Emperor, he declared he was now Emperor of Austria (at the time a geographical term that had little resonance). Two years later, Francis personally wound up the moribund Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. Both actions were of dubious constitutional legality.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Francis I as Austrian Emperor wearing the Order of the Golden Fleece, undatedLater, he led the Holy Roman Empire into the French Revolutionary Wars. He briefly commanded the Allied forces during the Flanders Campaign of 1794 before handing over command to his brother Archduke Charles. He was later defeated by Napoleon. By the Treaty of Campo Formio, he ceded the left bank of the Rhine to France in exchange for Venice and Dalmatia. He again fought against France during the War of the Second Coalition.\n\n\nOn 11 August 1804, in response to Napoleon crowning himself as emperor of the French earlier that year, he announced that he would henceforth assume the title of hereditary emperor of Austria as Francis I, a move that technically was illegal in terms of imperial law. Yet Napoleon had agreed beforehand and therefore it happened.[8][nb 1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the War of the Third Coalition, the Austrian forces met a crushing defeat at Austerlitz, and Francis had to agree to the Treaty of Pressburg, which greatly weakened Austria and brought about the final collapse of the Holy Roman Empire. In July 1806, under massive pressure from France, Bavaria and fifteen other German states ratified the statutes founding the Confederation of the Rhine, with Napoleon designated Protector, and they announced to the Imperial Diet their intention to leave the Empire with immediate effect. Then, on 22 July, Napoleon issued an ultimatum to Francis demanding that he abdicate as Holy Roman Emperor by 10 August.[9][10] Five days later, Francis bowed to the inevitable and, without mentioning the ultimatum, affirmed that since the Peace of Pressburg he had tried his best to fulfil his duties as emperor but that circumstances had convinced him that he could no longer rule according to his oath of office, the formation of the Confederation of the Rhine making that impossible. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the defeat of the Fifth Coalition, Francis ceded more territory to France and was forced to wed his daughter Marie Louise to Napoleon.\n\n\nIn 1813, Francis turned against Napoleon and finally defeated him in the War of the Sixth Coalition, forcing the French emperor to abdicate. Austria took part as a leading member of the Holy Alliance at the Congress of Vienna, which was largely dominated by Francis' chancellor Klemens von Metternich, culminating in a new European order and the restoration of most of Francis' ancient dominions. Due to the establishment of the Concert of Europe, which resisted popular nationalist and liberal tendencies, Francis was viewed as a reactionary later in his reign. Francis died in 1835 at the age of 67 and was succeeded by his son, Ferdinand I.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\n* Spencer Napoleonica Collection Archived 5 December 2012 at archive.today at Newberry Library\n\n\n### Regnal titles[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor\n**House of Habsburg-Lorraine**\nCadet branch of the **House of Lorraine**\n**Born:** 12 February 1768 **Died:** 2 March 1835 |\n| Regnal titles\n |\n| Preceded byLeopold II\n |  **Holy Roman EmperorKing in Germany** 1792–1806\n | **Dissolution**  |\n|  **Duke of Brabant, Limburg and Luxembourg;Count of Flanders, Hainaut and Namur** 1792–1793\n | **French Revolutionary Wars**  |\n|  **Duke of Milan** 1792–1796\n |\n|  **King of Hungary, Bohemia, Galicia and Lodomeria, and Croatia,Archduke of Austria** 1792–1835\n | Succeeded byFerdinand I & V\n |\n| **New title** |  **Emperor of Austria** 1804–1835\n |\n|  **King of Lombardy-Venetia** 1815–1835\n |\n| Political offices\n |\n| **New title** |  **Head of the *Präsidialmacht* Austria** 1815–1835\n | Succeeded byFerdinand I of Austria\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)1 Thaler silver coin with portrait of Emperor Franz I, 1820\nThe violent events of the French Revolution impressed themselves deeply into the mind of Francis (as well as all other European monarchs), and he came to distrust radicalism in any form. In 1794, a \"Jacobin\" conspiracy was discovered in the Austrian and Hungarian armies.[15] The leaders were put on trial, but the verdicts only skirted the perimeter of the conspiracy. Francis' brother Alexander Leopold (at that time Palatine of Hungary) wrote to the Emperor admitting \"Although we have caught a lot of the culprits, we have not really got to the bottom of this business yet.\" Nonetheless, two officers heavily implicated in the conspiracy were hanged and gibbeted, while numerous others were sentenced to imprisonment (many of whom died from the conditions).[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Painting of Francis II at the age of 25, wearing the Order of the Golden Fleece, with the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire and Hungary's Crown of Saint Stephen in the background (1792)\nAs the head of the Holy Roman Empire and the ruler of the vast multi-ethnic Habsburg hereditary lands, Francis felt threatened by the French revolutionaries and later Napoleon's expansionism as well as their social and political reforms which were being exported throughout Europe in the wake of the conquering French armies. Francis had a fraught relationship with France. His aunt Marie Antoinette, the wife of Louis XVI and Queen consort of France, was guillotined by the revolutionaries in 1793, at the beginning of his reign, although, on the whole, he was indifferent to her fate.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChildren of Francis II\n| Name | Picture | Birth | Death | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| By Elisabeth of Württemberg\n |\n| **Archduchess Ludovika Elisabeth** |  | 18 February 1790 | 24 June 1791 (aged 1) | Died in infancy and buried in the Imperial Crypt, Vienna, Austria.\n |\n| By Maria Teresa of the Two Sicilies\n |\n| **Archduchess Maria Ludovika** | ![](image) | 12 December 1791 | 17 December 1847 (aged 56) | Married first Napoleon Bonaparte, had issue, married second Adam, count of Neipperg, had issue, married third to Charles, Count of Bombelles, no issue.\n |\n| **Emperor Ferdinand I** | ![](image) | 19 April 1793 | 29 June 1875 (aged 82) | Married Maria Anna of Savoy, Princess of Sardinia, no issue.\n |\n| **Archduchess Marie Caroline** |  | 8 June 1794 | 16 March 1795 (aged 9 months) | Died in childhood, no issue.\n |\n| **Archduchess Caroline Ludovika** |  | 22 December 1795 | 30 June 1797 (aged 1) | Died in childhood, no issue.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Maria Christina of Austria & Albert Casimir, Duke of Teschen (1792-1793)\nCharles, Duke of Teschen (1793-1794)\n |\n| Archduke/Emperor of Austria |\n| Reign | 1 March 1792/11 August 1804 – 2 March 1835 |\n| Predecessor | Leopold VII |\n| Successor | Ferdinand I |\n| Chancellor | Klemens von Metternich |\n| King of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia |\n| Reign | 1 March 1792 – 2 March 1835 |\n| Coronations | * 6 June 1792, Buda\n* 9 August 1792, Prague\n |\n| Predecessor | Leopold II |\n| Successor | Ferdinand V |\n| King of Lombardy–Venetia |\n| Reign | 9 June 1815 – 2 March 1835 |\n| Successor | Ferdinand I |\n| Head of the *Präsidialmacht* Austria |\n| In office | 20 June 1815 – 2 March 1835 |\n| Successor | Ferdinand I |\n|  |\n| Born | (1768-02-12)12 February 1768Florence, Grand Duchy of Tuscany |\n| Died | 2 March 1835(1835-03-02) (aged 67)Vienna, Austrian Empire |\n| Burial | Imperial Crypt\n |\n| Spouses | * \n\n\nElisabeth of Württemberg\n\n​\n ​\n(m. 1788; died 1790)​\n\n* \n\n\nMaria Teresa of Naples and Sicily\n\n​\n ​\n(m. 1790; died 1807)​\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)1770 painting by Anton Raphael Mengs depicting Archduke Francis at the age of 2\nFrancis was a son of Emperor Leopold II (1747–1792) and his wife Maria Luisa of Spain (1745–1792), daughter of Charles III of Spain. Francis was born in Florence, the capital of Tuscany, where his father reigned as Grand Duke from 1765 to 1790. Though he had a happy childhood surrounded by his many siblings,[1] his family knew Francis was likely to be a future Emperor (his uncle Joseph had no surviving issue from either of his two marriages), and so in 1784 the young Archduke was sent to the Imperial Court in Vienna to educate and prepare him for his future role.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1813, for the fifth and final time, Austria turned against France and joined Great Britain, Russia, Prussia and Sweden in their war against Napoleon. Austria played a major role in the final defeat of France—in recognition of this, Francis, represented by Clemens von Metternich, presided over the Congress of Vienna, helping to form the Concert of Europe and the Holy Alliance, ushering in an era of conservatism in Europe. The German Confederation, a loose association of Central European states was created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to organize the surviving states of the Holy Roman Empire. The Congress was a personal triumph for Francis, who hosted the assorted dignitaries in comfort,[13] though Francis undermined his allies Tsar Alexander and Frederick William III of Prussia by negotiating a secret treaty with the restored French king Louis XVIII.[14]\n\n\n\n## Domestic policy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Leopold II (1339–1344)\n* Rudolf IV the Founder (1358–1365)\n* Leopold III the Just (1365-1379)\n* Albert III the Pigtail (1365-1395)\n* Albert IV the Patient (1395-1404)\n* Albert V (1404–1439)\n* Ladislaus I the Posthumous (1440–1457)\n* Frederick V the Peaceful (1457–1493)\n* Maximilian I the Last Knight (1493–1519)\n* Charles I (1519–1521)\n* Ferdinand I (1521–1564)\n* Maximilian II (1564–1576)\n* Rudolf V (1576–1608)\n* Matthias (1608–1619)\n* Albert VII (1619)\n* Ferdinand III (1590, 1619–1637)\n* Ferdinand IV (1637–1657)\n* Leopold V (1623–1632)\n* Ferdinand Charles (1632–1662)\n* Sigismund Francis (1662–1665)\n* Leopold VI (1657, 1665–1705)\n* Joseph I (1705–1711)\n* Charles III (1711–1740)\n* Maria Theresa (1740–1780)\n* Francis I Stephen (1740–1765)\n* Joseph II (1765–1790)\n* Leopold VII (1790–1792)\n* Francis II (1792–1835)\n* Ferdinand I (1835–1848)\n* Francis Joseph I (1848–1916)\n* Charles I (1916–1918)\n |\n| House of HabsburgStyria, Carinthia, Carniola | * Leopold III the Just (1365–1386)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Sarcophagus of Francis II in the Imperial CryptFrancis passed on a main point in the political testament he left for his son and heir Ferdinand: to \"preserve unity in the family and regard it as one of the highest goods.\" In many portraits (particularly those painted by Peter Fendi) he was portrayed as the patriarch of a loving family, surrounded by his children and grandchildren.[26]\n\n\n## Marriages[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

His brothers, the Archdukes Charles and Johann had their meetings and activities spied upon.[19] Censorship was also prevalent. The author Franz Grillparzer, a Habsburg patriot, had one play suppressed solely as a \"precautionary\" measure. When Grillparzer met the censor responsible, he asked him what was objectionable about the work. The censor replied, \"Oh, nothing at all.

Yet, distrustful of allowing any individual too much power, he otherwise maintained the separation of command functions between the Hofkriegsrat and his field commanders.[21] In the later years of his reign he limited military spending, requiring it not exceed forty million florins per year; because of inflation this resulted in inadequate funding, with the army's share of the budget shrinking from half in 1817 to only twenty-three percent in 1830.[22]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  | 11.

He was the leader of the French Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, then of the French Empire as Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and briefly again in 1815. His political and cultural legacy endures as a celebrated and controversial leader. He initiated many enduring reforms, but has been criticized for his authoritarian rule. He is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history and his wars and campaigns are still studied at military schools worldwide. However, historians still debate whether he was responsible for the Napoleonic Wars in which between three and six million people died.[2][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBonaparte began with an army of 13,000 men. 1,500 were reported missing, 1,200 died in combat, and thousands perished from disease—mostly bubonic plague. He failed to reduce the fortress of Acre, so he marched his army back to Egypt in May. To speed the retreat, Bonaparte ordered plague-stricken men to be poisoned with opium. The number who died remains disputed, ranging from 30 to 580. He also brought out 1,000 wounded men.[92] Back in Egypt on 25 July, Bonaparte defeated an Ottoman amphibious invasion at Abukir.[93]\n\n\n\n## Ruler of France[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 18 Brumaire and Napoleonic era\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Napoleon's remains passing through Jamestown, Saint Helena, on 13 October 1840\nIn 1840, Louis Philippe I obtained permission from the British government to return Napoleon's remains to France. His casket was opened to confirm that it still contained the former emperor. Despite being dead for nearly two decades, Napoleon had been very well preserved and not decomposed at all. On 15 December 1840, a state funeral was held. The horse-drawn hearse proceeded from the Arc de Triomphe down the Champs-Élysées, across the Place de la Concorde to the Esplanade des Invalides and then to the cupola in St Jérôme's Chapel, where it remained until the tomb designed by Louis Visconti was completed.\n\n\nIn 1861, Napoleon's remains were entombed in a sarcophagus of red quartzite from Russia (often mistaken for porphyry) in the crypt under the dome at Les Invalides.[253]\n\n\n\n#### Cause of death[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Frederick Marryat's sketch of Napoleon's body on his deathbed\nIn February 1821, Napoleon's health began to deteriorate rapidly, and he reconciled with the Catholic Church. By March, he had become confined to bed. Napoleon died on 5 May 1821 at Longwood House at age 51, after making his last confession, Extreme Unction and Viaticum in the presence of Father Ange Vignali from his deathbed. His last words were, *France, l'armée, tête d'armée, Joséphine* (\"France, the army, head of the army, Joséphine\").[248][249][241]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nthe event commemorated in the officially sanctioned painting by Jacques-Louis David.[136] Joséphine became only the second queen to be crowned and anointed in French history, other than Marie de' Medici.[138]\n\n\nNapoleon was then crowned King of Italy, with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, at the Cathedral of Milan on 26 May 1805. He created eighteen Marshals of the Empire from among his top generals to secure the allegiance of the army on 18 May 1804, the official start of the Empire.[139]\n\n\n\n#### War of the Third Coalition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: War of the Third Coalition\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNapoleon escaped in February 1815 and took control of France.[6] The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. The British exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic, where he died in 1821 at the age of 51.\n\n\nNapoleon had a lasting impact on the world, bringing modernizing reforms to France and Western Europe[c] and stimulating the development of nation states. He also sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in 1803, doubling the size of the United States.[2][13] However, his exploitation of conquered territories, mixed record on civil rights, reintroduction of slavery in France's colonies, and repression of the Haitian Revolution are controversial and adversely affect his reputation.[14]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Offices and distinctions\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |\n| --- |\n| Napoleon I of France\n**House of Bonaparte**\n**Born:** 15 August 1769 **Died:** 5 May 1821 |\n| Political offices\n |\n| **New title**Directory dissolved\n |  **Provisional Consul of the French Republic** 11 November – 12 December 1799 Served alongside: **Roger Ducos and Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès** | **Became First Consul**  |\n| **New title**Consulate established\n |  **First Consul of the French Republic** 12 December 1799 – 18 May 1804 Served alongside: **Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès (Second Consul)Charles-François Lebrun (Third Consul)** | **Became Emperor**  |\n| **New title**Italian Republic established\n |  **President of the Italian Republic** 26 January 1802 – 17 March 1805\n | **Vacant****(Became King)**\nTitle next held by\n**Enrico De Nicola**  |\n| **New title**Helvetic Republic dissolved\n |  **Mediator of the Swiss Confederation** 19 February 1803 – 19 October 1813\n | **New Confederation established**  |\n| Regnal titles\n |\n| **Vacant**French Revolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** As King of France\n2. **^** English: /nəˈpoʊliən ˈboʊnəpɑːrt/, French: *Napoléon Bonaparte* [napɔleɔ̃ bɔnapaʁt]; Corsican: *Napulione Buonaparte*.\n3. **^** He established a system of public education,[7] abolished the vestiges of feudalism,[8] emancipated Jews and other religious minorities,[9] abolished the Spanish Inquisition,[10] enacted legal protections for an emerging middle class,[11] and centralized state power at the expense of religious authorities.[12]\n4. **^** His brother, also called Napoleon, died at birth and his sister, Maria Anna, died shortly before her first birthday.

A day later, they advanced onto the demoralized soldiers protecting the city. Joseph Bonaparte led a final battle at the gates of Paris. They were greatly outnumbered, as 30,000 French soldiers were pitted against a combined coalition force that was five times greater. They were defeated, and Joseph retreated out of the city. The leaders of Paris surrendered to the Coalition on the last day of March 1814.[212] On 1 April, Alexander addressed the Sénat conservateur. Long docile to Napoleon, under Talleyrand's prodding it had turned against him. Alexander told the Sénat that the Allies were fighting against Napoleon, not France, and they were prepared to offer honourable peace terms if Napoleon were removed from power. The next day, the Sénat passed the Acte de déchéance de l'Empereur (\"Emperor's Demise Act\"), which declared Napoleon deposed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)*Situation of Napoleon's body when his coffin was reopened on St Helena*, by Jules Rigo, 1840\nThe cause of Napoleon's death has been debated. His physician, François Carlo Antommarchi, led the autopsy, which found the cause of death to be stomach cancer. Antommarchi did not sign the official report.[254] Napoleon's father had died of stomach cancer, although this was apparently unknown at the time of the autopsy.[255] Antommarchi found evidence of a stomach ulcer; this was the most convenient explanation for the British, who wanted to avoid criticism over their care of Napoleon.[248]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 3 October, royalists in Paris declared a rebellion against the National Convention.[62] Paul Barras, a leader of the Thermidorian Reaction, knew of Bonaparte's military exploits at Toulon and gave him command of the improvised forces in defence of the convention in the Tuileries Palace. Bonaparte had seen the massacre of the King's Swiss Guard there three years earlier and realized that artillery would be the key to its defence.[28]\n\n\nHe ordered a young cavalry officer, Joachim Murat, to seize large cannons and used them to repel the attackers on 5 October 1795—*13 Vendémiaire An IV* in the French Republican Calendar. 1,400 royalists died and the rest fled.[62] He cleared the streets with \"a whiff of grapeshot\", according to 19th-century historian Thomas Carlyle in *The French Revolution: A History*.[63][64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNapoleon\n |\n| --- |\n| * Napoleonic era\n\t+ timeline\n* First French Empire\n |\n| Family | * **Wives:** Joséphine de Beauharnais\n* Marie Louise\n* **Children:** Charles Léon\n* Alexandre Walewski\n* Napoleon II\n* **Father:** Carlo Maria Buonaparte\n* **Mother:** Letizia Ramolino\n* **Brothers:** Joseph Bonaparte\n* Lucien Bonaparte\n* Louis Bonaparte\n* Jérôme Bonaparte\n* **Sisters:** Caroline Bonaparte\n* Pauline Bonaparte\n* Elisa Bonaparte\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Life and career | * Stay in Auxonne [fr]\n* Coup of 18 Brumaire\n* Consulate\n* Assassination attempts\n* Constitutions\n\t+ 1799\n\t+ 1802\n\t+ 1804\n\t+ 1815\n* **Napoleonic Wars**\n* Coronation\n* Sale of Louisiana\n* Planned invasion of the UK\n* Holland\n* *Mesures usuelles*\n* Looting of art\n* Tactics\n* Weaponry and warfare\n* 1st abdication\n\t+ 1st exile\n* Route Napoléon\n* 2nd abdication\n\t+ 2nd exile [fr]\n* Death [fr]\n\t+ mask\n |\n| Battles and wars | * **French Revolutionary Wars**\n* Siege of Toulon\n* **French Revolution**\n* *13 Vendémiaire*\n* Battle of Lodi\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDifferences with the United Kingdom meant France faced the War of the Third Coalition by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with victories in the Ulm campaign and at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him. Napoleon defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, marched the *Grande Armée* into Eastern Europe, and defeated the Russians in June 1807 at Friedland, forcing the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to accept the Treaties of Tilsit. Two years later, the Austrians challenged the French again during the War of the Fifth Coalition, but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShortly after his death, an autopsy was conducted and François Carlo Antommarchi, the doctor conducting the autopsy, cut off Napoleon's penis.[30][*page needed*][250] Napoleon's original death mask was created around 6 May, although it is not clear which doctor created it.[i][252] Napoleon's heart and intestines were removed and contained separately in two sealed vessels, which were placed inside his coffin at his feet. In his will, he had asked to be buried on the banks of the Seine, but the British governor said he should be buried on Saint Helena, in the Valley of the Willows.[248]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Napoleon |\n| --- |\n| ![Portrait of Napoleon in his late thirties, in high-ranking white and dark blue military dress uniform.

His family did not drop the name Buonaparte until 1796. The first known record of him signing his name as Bonaparte was at the age of 27 (in 1796).[47][16][48]\n\n\n\n### Siege of Toulon[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Siege of Toulon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Succeeded byLouis XVIII\n***as King of France and Navarre(Napoleon II** according to his will only**)*** |\n| Titles in pretence |\n| **New title** | **— TITULAR —** ***Emperor of the French*** 11 April 1814 – 20 March 1815\n | **Vacant**Title next held by\n**Napoleon II**  |\n |\n\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nNapoleonic Wars\n |\n| --- |\n| * **Third Coalition**\n* **Fourth Coalition**\n* **Peninsular War**\n* **Fifth Coalition**\n* **French Invasion of Russia**\n* **Sixth Coalition**\n* **Seventh Coalition**\n |\n| Belli-gerents | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe adopted a plan to capture a hill where republican guns could dominate the city's harbour and force the British to evacuate. The assault on the position led to the capture of the city, and during it Bonaparte was wounded in the thigh on 16 December. Catching the attention of the Committee of Public Safety, he was put in charge of the artillery of France's Army of Italy.[51] On 22 December he was on his way to a new post in Nice, promoted from colonel to brigadier general at the age of 24. He devised plans to attack the Kingdom of Sardinia as part of France's campaign against the First Coalition.\n\n\nThe French army carried out Bonaparte's plan in the Battle of Saorgio in April 1794, and then advanced to seize Ormea in the mountains. From Ormea, it headed west to outflank the Austro-Sardinian positions around Saorge. After this campaign, Augustin Robespierre sent Bonaparte on a mission to the Republic of Genoa to determine that country's intentions towards France.[52]\n\n\n\n### 13 Vendémiaire[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter a decade of constant warfare, France and Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, bringing the Revolutionary Wars to an end. Amiens called for the withdrawal of British troops from recently conquered colonial territories as well as for assurances to curtail the expansionary goals of the French Republic.[105] With Europe at peace and the economy recovering, Bonaparte's popularity soared to its highest levels under the consulate, both domestically and abroad.[112] In a new plebiscite during the spring of 1802, the French public came out in huge numbers to approve a constitution that made the Consulate permanent, essentially elevating Bonaparte to dictator for life.[112]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Bonaparte, aged 23, as lieutenant-colonel of a battalion of Corsican Republican volunteers. Portrait by Henri Félix Emmanuel Philippoteaux\nUpon graduating in September 1785, Bonaparte was commissioned a second lieutenant in *La Fère* artillery regiment.[g][28] He served in Valence and Auxonne until after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789. Bonaparte was a fervent Corsican nationalist during this period.[41] He asked for leave to join his mentor Pasquale Paoli, when Paoli was allowed to return to Corsica by the National Assembly. But Paoli had no sympathy for Napoleon, as he deemed his father a traitor for having deserted the cause of Corsican independence.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite the failures in Egypt, Bonaparte returned to a hero's welcome. He drew together an alliance with director Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès, his brother Lucien, speaker of the Council of Five Hundred Roger Ducos, director Joseph Fouché, and Talleyrand, and they overthrew the Directory by a coup d'état on 9 November 1799 (\"the 18th Brumaire\" according to the revolutionary calendar), closing down the Council of Five Hundred. Napoleon became \"first consul\" for ten years, with two consuls appointed by him who had consultative voices only. His power was confirmed by the new \"Constitution of the Year VIII\", originally devised by Sieyès to give Napoleon a minor role, but rewritten by Napoleon, and accepted by direct popular vote (3,000,000 in favour, 1,567 opposed). The constitution preserved the appearance of a republic but, in reality, established a dictatorship.[98][99]\n\n\n\n### French Consulate[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: French Consulate and War of the Second Coalition\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNapoleon turned his focus to domestic affairs after the war. Empress Joséphine had still not given birth to a child from Napoleon, who became worried about the future of his empire following his death. Desperate for a legitimate heir, Napoleon divorced Joséphine on 10 January 1810 and started looking for a new wife. Hoping to cement the recent alliance with Austria through a family connection, Napoleon married the 18-year-old Archduchess Marie Louise, daughter of Emperor Francis II. On 20 March 1811, Marie Louise gave birth to a baby boy, whom Napoleon made heir apparent and bestowed the title of *King of Rome*. His son never actually ruled the empire but given his brief titular rule and cousin Louis-Napoléon's subsequent naming himself Napoléon III, historians often refer to him as *Napoleon II*.[194]\n\n\n\n#### Invasion of Russia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French invasion of Russia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNapoleon was born on the island of Corsica into a family descending from Italian nobility.[4][5] He was resentful of the French monarchy, and supported the French Revolution in 1789 while serving in the French army, trying to spread its ideals to his native Corsica. He rose rapidly in the ranks after saving the governing French Directory by firing on royalist insurgents. In 1796, he began a military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring decisive victories, and became a national hero. Two years later he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power. He engineered a coup in November 1799 and became *First Consul of the Republic*. In 1804, to consolidate and expand his power, he crowned himself *Emperor of the French*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Bonaparte in a simple general uniform in the middle of a scrum of red-robbed members of the Council of Five Hundred](image)*General Bonaparte surrounded by members of the Council of Five Hundred during the Coup of 18 Brumaire*, by François Bouchot\nWhile in Egypt, Bonaparte stayed informed of European affairs. He learned that France had suffered a series of defeats in the War of the Second Coalition.[94] On 24 August 1799, fearing that the Republic's future was in doubt, he took advantage of the temporary departure of British ships from French coastal ports and set sail for France, despite the fact that he had received no explicit orders from Paris.[95] The army was left in the charge of Jean-Baptiste Kléber.[96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNapoleon withdrew into France, his army reduced to 70,000 soldiers and little cavalry; he faced more than three times as many Allied troops.[211] Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon's older brother, abdicated as king of Spain on 13 December 1813 and assumed the title of lieutenant general to save the collapsing empire. The French were surrounded: British armies pressed from the south, and other Coalition forces positioned to attack from the German states. By the middle of January 1814, the Coalition had already entered France's borders and launched a two-pronged attack on Paris, with Prussia entering from the north, and Austria from the east, marching out of the capitulated Swiss confederation. The French Empire, however, would not go down so easily. Napoleon launched a series of victories in the Six Days' Campaign. While they repulsed the coalition forces and delayed the capture of Paris by at least a full month, these were not significant enough to turn the tide. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)*The Third of May 1808* by Francisco Goya, showing Spanish resisters being executed by French troops\n![](image)A mass grave of soldiers killed at the Battle of WaterlooThere is debate over whether Napoleon was \"an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe\" or \"a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler\".[370] He was compared to Adolf Hitler by Pieter Geyl in 1947,[371] and Claude Ribbe in 2005.[372] Most modern critics of Napoleon, however, reject the Hitler comparison, arguing that Napoleon did not commit genocide and did not engage in the mass murder and imprisonment of his political opponents.[373][374] Nevertheless, Bell and McLynn condemn his killing of 3,000-5,000 Turkish prisoners of war in Syria.[89][375]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Napoleon's tomb at Les Invalides in Paris\nNapoleon's personal physician, Barry O'Meara, warned the English government that his declining state of health was mainly caused by the harsh treatment. During the last few years of his life, Napoleon confined himself for months on end in his damp, mould-infested and wretched habitation of Longwood. Years of isolation and loneliness took its toll on Napoleon's mental health, having his court continually reduced, including the arrest of Count Emmanuel de Las Cases, conditions which Lord Holland used to bring about a debate regarding the treatment of Napoleon in captivity.[247]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNapoleon returned to Paris and found that both the legislature and the people had turned against him. Realizing that his position was untenable, he abdicated on 22 June in favour of his son. He left Paris three days later and settled at Joséphine's former palace in Malmaison (on the western bank of the Seine about 17 kilometres (11 mi) west of Paris). Even as Napoleon travelled to Paris, the Coalition forces swept through France (arriving in the vicinity of Paris on 29 June), with the stated intent of restoring Louis XVIII to the French throne.\n\n\nWhen Napoleon heard that Prussian troops had orders to capture him dead or alive, he fled to Rochefort, considering an escape to the United States. British ships were blocking every port. Napoleon surrendered to Captain Frederick Maitland on HMS *Bellerophon* on 15 July 1815.[229][230]\n\n\n\n## Exile on Saint Helena[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 5th Regiment was sent to intercept him and made contact just south of Grenoble on 7 March 1815. Napoleon approached the regiment alone, dismounted his horse and, when he was within gunshot range, shouted to the soldiers, \"Here I am. Kill your Emperor, if you wish.\"[223] The soldiers quickly responded with, \"Vive L'Empereur!\" Ney, who had boasted to the restored Bourbon king, Louis XVIII, that he would bring Napoleon to Paris in an iron cage, affectionately kissed his former emperor and forgot his oath of allegiance to the Bourbon monarch. The two then marched together toward Paris with a growing army. The unpopular Louis XVIII fled to Belgium after realizing that he had little political support.[224] On 13 March, the powers at the Congress of Vienna declared Napoleon an outlaw.[225] Four days later, Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia each pledged to put 150,000 men into the field to end his rule.[226]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy 1795, Bonaparte had become engaged to Désirée Clary, daughter of François Clary. Désirée's sister Julie Clary had married Bonaparte's brother Joseph.[57] In April 1795, he was assigned to the Army of the West, which was engaged in the War in the Vendée—a civil war and royalist counter-revolution in Vendée, a region in west-central France on the Atlantic Ocean. As an infantry command, it was a demotion from artillery general—for which the army already had a full quota—and he pleaded poor health to avoid the posting.[58]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Aside from his name, there does not appear to be a connection between him and Napoleon's theorem.[35]\n7. **^** He was mainly referred to as Bonaparte until he became First Consul for life.[40]\n8. **^** This is depicted in *Bonaparte Crossing the Alps* by Hippolyte Delaroche and in Jacques-Louis David's imperial *Napoleon Crossing the Alps*. He is less realistically portrayed on a charger in the latter work.[103]\n9. **^** It was customary to cast a death mask of a leader. At least four genuine death masks of Napoleon are known to exist: one in The Cabildo in New Orleans, one in a Liverpool museum, another in Havana and one in the library of the University of North Carolina.[251]\n10. **^** The body can tolerate large doses of arsenic if ingested regularly, and arsenic was a fashionable cure-all.[258]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnknown to Bonaparte, the Directory had sent him orders to return to ward off possible invasions of French soil, but poor lines of communication prevented the delivery of these messages.[94] By the time that he reached Paris in October, France's situation had been improved by a series of victories. The Republic, however, was bankrupt and the ineffective Directory was unpopular with the French population.[97] The Directory discussed Bonaparte's \"desertion\" but was too weak to punish him.[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNapoleon arrived in Paris on 20 March and governed for a period now called the Hundred Days. By the start of June, the armed forces available to him had reached 200,000, and he decided to go on the offensive to attempt to drive a wedge between the oncoming British and Prussian armies. The French Army of the North crossed the frontier into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, in modern-day Belgium.[227]\n\n\nNapoleon's forces fought two Coalition armies, commanded by the British Duke of Wellington and the Prussian Prince Blücher, at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815. Wellington's army withstood repeated attacks by the French and survived through the day while the Prussians arrived in force and broke through Napoleon's right flank.[228]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNapoleon had advanced as far as Fontainebleau when he learned that Paris had fallen. When Napoleon proposed the army march on the capital, his senior officers and marshals mutinied.[213] On 4 April, led by Ney, the senior officers confronted Napoleon. When Napoleon asserted the army would follow him, Ney replied that the army would follow its generals. While the ordinary soldiers and regimental officers wanted to fight on, the senior commanders were unwilling to continue. Without any senior officers or marshals, any prospective invasion of Paris would have been impossible. Bowing to the inevitable, on 4 April Napoleon abdicated in favour of his son, with Marie Louise as regent. However, the Allies refused to accept this under prodding from Alexander, who feared that Napoleon might find an excuse to retake the throne.[214][215] Napoleon was then forced to announce his unconditional abdication only two days later.[215]\n\n\n\nIn his farewell address to the soldiers of Old Guard in 20 April, Napoleon said:\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo expand his power, Napoleon used these assassination plots to justify the creation of an imperial system based on the Roman model. He believed that a Bourbon restoration would be more difficult if his family's succession was entrenched in the constitution.[133] Launching yet another referendum, Napoleon was elected as *Emperor of the French* by a tally exceeding 99%.[113] As with the Life Consulate two years earlier, this referendum produced heavy participation, bringing out almost 3.6 million voters to the polls.[113]\n\n\nA keen observer of Bonaparte's rise to absolute power, Madame de Rémusat, explains that \"men worn out by the turmoil of the Revolution […] looked for the domination of an able ruler\" and that \"people believed quite sincerely that Bonaparte, whether as consul or emperor, would exert his authority and save [them] from the perils of anarchy.\"[134][*page needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Coronation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Battle of Bassano\n* Battle of Rivoli\n* **French campaign in Egypt and Syria**\n* Battle of the Pyramids\n* Siege of Jaffa\n* Battle of Marengo\n* **War of the Third Coalition**\n* Battle of Austerlitz\n* **War of the Fourth Coalition**\n* Battle of Eylau\n* **War of the Fifth Coalition**\n* Battle of Eckmühl\n* **French invasion of Russia**\n* Battle of Borodino\n* **War of the Sixth Coalition**\n* Battle of Leipzig\n* Battle of Vauchamps\n* Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube\n* **Hundred Days**\n* Battle of Ligny\n* Battle of Waterloo\n |\n| Views | * Catholic Church\n\t+ Concordat of 1801\n\t+ Tiara\n* Jewish people\n\t+ Grand Sanhedrin\n\t+ Infamous Decree\n* Protestants\n\t+ Organic Articles\n* Slavery\n\t+ Law of 20 May 1802\n\t+ Saint-Domingue expedition\n* Women [fr]\n |\n| Homes and honours | * Arc de Triomphe\n* Column of the Grande Armée\n* Equestrian statue\n* Palace of Fontainebleau\n* Les Invalides\n* Longwood House\n* *Maison Bonaparte*\n* *Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker*\n\t+ Milan\n* Rue de la Victoire\n* Warsaw monument\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile Napoleon's mistresses had children by him, his marriage to Joséphine did not produce an heir, possibly because of either the stresses of her imprisonment during the Reign of Terror or an abortion she may have had in her twenties.[420] Napoleon chose divorce so he could remarry in search of an heir. Despite his divorce from Joséphine, Napoleon showed his dedication to her for the rest of his life. When he heard the news of her death while in exile in Elba, he locked himself in his room and would not come out for two full days.[221] Her name would also be his final word on his deathbed in 1821.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)*Napoleon in his coronation robes* by François Gérard, c. 1805\nGreat Britain had broken the Peace of Amiens by declaring war on France in May 1803.[140] In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish agreement became the first step towards the creation of the Third Coalition. By April 1805, Britain had also signed an alliance with Russia.[141] Austria had been defeated by France twice in recent memory and wanted revenge, so it joined the coalition a few months later.[142]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: 13 Vendémiaire\n\nSome contemporaries alleged that Bonaparte was put under house arrest at Nice for his association with the Robespierres following their fall in the Thermidorian Reaction in July 1794.[53] Bonaparte's secretary Bourrienne disputed the allegation in his memoirs. According to Bourrienne, jealousy was responsible, between the Army of the Alps and the Army of Italy, with whom Bonaparte was seconded at the time.[54] Bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defence in a letter to the commissar Saliceti, and was acquitted of any wrongdoing.[55] He was released within two weeks (on 20 August), and due to his technical skills, was asked to draw up plans to attack Italian positions in the context of France's war with Austria. He also took part in an expedition to take back Corsica from the British, but the French were repulsed by the British Royal Navy.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Colored painting depicting Napoleon crowning his wife inside of a cathedral](image)*The Coronation of Napoleon* by Jacques-Louis David (1804)\nDuring the consulate, Napoleon faced several royalist and Jacobin assassination plots, including the *Conspiration des poignards* (Dagger plot) in October 1800 and the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise (also known as the *Infernal Machine*) two months later.[130] In January 1804, his police uncovered an assassination plot against him that involved Moreau and which was ostensibly sponsored by the Bourbon family, the former rulers of France. On the advice of Talleyrand, Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the Duke of Enghien,[131] violating the sovereignty of Baden. The Duke was quickly executed after a secret military trial, even though he had not been involved in the plot.[132] Enghien's execution infuriated royal courts throughout Europe, becoming one of the contributing political factors for the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_QFD3IXYUvbh5PnrBKsumdMWH","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
