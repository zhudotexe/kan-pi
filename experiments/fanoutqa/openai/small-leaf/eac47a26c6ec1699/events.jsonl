They set their own academic standards and manage their own budgets. The president, however, plays an important part in university-wide planning and strategy. Each names a faculty's dean (and, since the foundation of the office in 1994, the university's provost), and grants tenure to recommended professors; however, the president is expected to make such decisions after extensive consultation with faculty members.\n\n\nHarvard presidents have traditionally influenced educational practices nationwide. Charles W. Eliot, for example, originated America's familiar system of a smorgasbord of elective courses available to each student;[2] James B. Conant worked to introduce standardized testing; Derek Bok and Neil L. Rudenstine argued for the continued importance of diversity in higher education.\n\n\nRecently, however, the job has become increasingly administrative, especially as fund-raising campaigns have taken on central importance in large institutions such as Harvard. Some have criticized this trend to the extent it has prevented the president from focusing on substantive issues in higher education.[3]\n\n\nEach president is professor in some department of the university and teaches from time to time.\n\n\nHarvard's current president is Claudine Gay, having become Harvard's 30th president on July 1, 2023.[4]\n\n\nShe succeeded Lawrence Bacow who retired on June 30, 2023.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nAt Harvard's founding it was headed by a \"schoolmaster,\" Nathaniel Eaton. In 1640, when Henry Dunster was brought in, he adopted the title president. The origins of this title have been grounds for a certain amount of speculation.\n\n\nHarvard was founded for the training of Puritan clergy, and even though its mission was soon broadened, nearly all presidents through the end of the 18th century were in holy orders.\n\n\nAll presidents from Leonard Hoar through Nathan Pusey were graduates of Harvard College. Of the presidents since Pusey, Bok earned his undergraduate degree at Stanford, Rudenstine at Princeton, and Summers and Bacow at MIT, but each earned a graduate degree at Harvard. Drew Gilpin Faust was the first president since the seventeenth century with no earned Harvard degree.\n\n\nJohn Winthrop served as acting president in 1769 and again in 1773; but both times he declined an offer of the full presidency on grounds of old age.\n\n\nOther minor acting presidents have included William Brattle, Edward Wigglesworth (1780–1781), Henry Ware (1810, 1828–1829), Andrew Preston Peabody (1862, 1868–1869), and Henry Pickering Walcott. Henry Rosovsky, former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, served as acting president for three months in 1987 when Bok traveled abroad. Provost Albert Carnesale served as acting president for three months, from November 1994 to February 1995, during Rudenstine's leave of absence. After Faust's retirement in 2018, Bok served as interim president for a year, from July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007, prior to Faust's appointment.\n\n\n\n## Presidents of Harvard[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Image\n | Presidents\n | Term of office\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| –\n | ![](image) | Nathaniel Eaton | 1637–1639\n | Referred to as \"schoolmaster\" of Harvard College\n |\n| 1\n |  | Henry Dunster | 1640–1654\n |  |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Charles Chauncy | 1654–1672\n |  |\n| 3\n |  | Leonard Hoar | 1672–1675\n |  |\n| 4\n |  | Urian Oakes | 1675–1680 (acting); 1680–1681\n |  |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | John Rogers | 1682–1684\n |  |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | Increase Mather | 1685–1686 (acting); 1686–1692 (rector); 1692–1701\n |  |\n| –\n | ![](image) | Samuel Willard | 1701–1707 (acting)\n |  |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | John Leverett | 1708–1724\n |  |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Benjamin Wadsworth | 1725–1737\n |  |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | Edward Holyoke | 1737–1769\n |  |\n| 10\n |  | Samuel Locke | 1770–1773\n |  |\n| 11\n |  | Samuel Langdon | 1774–1780\n |  |\n| 12\n |  | Joseph Willard | 1781–1804\n |  |\n| –\n | ![](image) | Eliphalet Pearson | 1804–1806 (acting)\n |  |\n| 13\n |  | Samuel Webber | 1806–1810\n |  |\n| 14\n | ![](image) | John Thornton Kirkland | 1810–1828\n |  |\n| 15\n | ![](image) | Josiah Quincy | 1829–1845\n |  |\n| 16\n | ![](image) | Edward Everett | 1846–1848\n |  |\n| 17\n | ![](image) | Jared Sparks | 1849–1853\n |  |\n| 18\n | ![](image) | James Walker | 1853–1860\n |  |\n| 19\n | ![](image) | Cornelius Conway Felton | 1860–1862\n |  |\n| 20\n | ![](image) | Thomas Hill | 1862–1868\n |  |\n| 21\n | ![](image) | Charles William Eliot | 1869–1909\n | Longest term of office (40 years)\n |\n| 22\n | ![](image) | A.

The position was first created in 1754 by the original royal charter for the university, issued by George II, and the power to appoint the president was given to an autonomous board of trustees. The university suspended operations upon the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, during which no individual served as president. When it was resuscitated by the New York State Legislature, the university was placed directly under the control of the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York; its chancellor, George Clinton, served as the *de facto* president of Columbia University.[1] Through the efforts of Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, control of the university was returned to a private board of trustees in 1787, which has to this day maintained the right to appoint or remove the president, who also serves on the board *ex officio*.[1] The university's first president was Samuel Johnson, who held the office from 1754 to 1763, and its 20th and current president is Minouche Shafik, whose tenure began on July 1, 2023.\n\n\nUpon the founding of the university, it was stipulated by the vestrymen of Trinity Church, on whose land King's College sat, that every president must be a member of the Church of England; otherwise, the land would revert back to the church.[2] As such, every single president of the university until the appointment of Dwight D. Eisenhower was Anglican, while the first six presidents, with the exception of William Samuel Johnson, were all either Anglican priests or bishops.[3] Michael I. Sovern, appointed in 1980, was the university's first Jewish president.[4] In 2023, Minouche Shafik became the woman to serve as president of the university.[5]\n\n\nFrom 1902 to 1970, every president was involved in foreign relations in some capacity: Nicholas Murray Butler was the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace from 1925 to 1945, and was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his promotion of the Kellogg–Briand Pact; Dwight D. Eisenhower served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force during World War II, and after his tenure would serve as President of the United States; and Grayson L. Kirk and Andrew W. Cordier were both instrumental to the formation of the United Nations.\n\n\nAs established by Columbia University's governing statutes, it is the duty of the president to exercise jurisdiction over all affairs of the university; to call special meetings of the University Senate, faculties, and administration; to report to the Trustees of Columbia on the state and needs of the university annually; and to administer discipline. The consent of the president is necessary for any act made by a faculty or administrative board, unless their veto is overridden by two-thirds vote. Additionally, the president is able to grant leaves of absences, give faculty permission to use university laboratories for experiments, and confer academic and honorary degrees on behalf of the board of trustees.[1]\n\n\nThe president is *ex officio* a permanent member of the Pulitzer Prize Board, and has annually presented the awards to its recipients since 1984.[6] In addition, the president is an *ex officio* member of the board of trustees of Barnard College.[7]\n\n\n\n## List of presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| # | Image | President | Birth year–Death year | Years as president | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) | Samuel Johnson[8] | 1696–1772 | 1754–1763 |  |\n| 2 | ![](image) | Myles Cooper[8] | 1735–1785 | 1763–1775 |  |\n| – | ![](image) | Benjamin Moore, B.A. 1768[8] | 1748–1816 | 1775–1776 | acting\n |\n| – | ![](image) | George Clinton[9] | 1739–1812 | 1784–1787 | as chancellor of the University of the State of New York; 1st governor of New York and later 4th vice president of the United States |\n| 3 | ![](image) | William Samuel Johnson[8] | 1727–1819 | 1787–1800 | signed the Constitution of the United States; served as United States Senator from Connecticut |\n| 4 | ![](image) | Charles Henry Wharton[8] | 1748–1833 | 1801–1801 |  |\n| 5 | ![](image) | Benjamin Moore, B.A. 1768[8] | 1748–1816 | 1801–1810 |  |\n| 6 | ![](image) | William Harris[8] | 1765–1829 | 1811–1829 | shared authority with Provost John Mitchell Mason until 1816\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) | William Alexander Duer[8] | 1780–1858 | 1829–1842 |  |\n| 8 | ![](image) | Nathaniel Fish Moore, B.A. 1802[8] | 1782–1872 | 1842–1849 |  |\n| 9 | ![](image) | Charles King[8] | 1789–1867 | 1849–1863 | presided over move to Madison Avenue campus\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) | Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard[8] | 1809–1889 | 1864–1888 |  |\n| –\n | ![](image) | Henry Drisler, B.A. 1839[10] | 1818–1897\n | 1867, 1888–1889\n | acting\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) | Seth Low, B.A. 1870[8] | 1850–1916 | 1890–1901 | presided over move to Morningside Heights campus; 23rd mayor of Brooklyn and 92nd mayor of New York City |\n| –\n | ![](image) | John Howard Van Amringe, B.A. 1860, M.A. 1863[11] | 1836–1915\n | 1899\n | acting\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) | Nicholas Murray Butler, B.A. 1882, M.A. 1883, Ph.D. 1884[8] | 1862–1947 | 1902–1945 | Nobel Peace Prize laureate\n |\n| – | ![](image) | Frank D.
