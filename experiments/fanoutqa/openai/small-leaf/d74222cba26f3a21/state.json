Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up, including the Partnership for Peace, the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative, and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.\n\n\nAll members have militaries, except for Iceland, which does not have a typical army (but it does have a coast guard and a small unit of civilian specialists for NATO operations). Three of NATO's members are nuclear weapons states: France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. NATO has 12\u00a0original founding member states. Three more members joined between 1952 and 1955, and a fourth joined in 1982. After the end of the Cold War, NATO added 15\u00a0more members from 1999 to 2023.[2]\n\n\n\nNATO currently recognizes Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Sweden, and Ukraine as aspiring members as part of their Open Doors enlargement policy.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of April\u00a02023[update], four additional states have formally informed NATO of their membership aspirations: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Sweden and Ukraine.[3]\n\n\n\n* NATO members agreed at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Georgia and Ukraine \"will become members of NATO in the future\".[7]\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina was invited by NATO to join the Membership Action Plan (MAP) in April 2010.[7]\n* In May 2022, Finland and Sweden simultaneously submitted official application letters to become NATO members.[8][9]\n\t+ Finland became a member on April 4, 2023.\n\t+ As of July 10, 2023, all members except Hungary and Turkey had ratified Sweden's accession protocol, with both committing to complete their approval by October.[10]\n\n\n## List of member states[edit]\n\n\nThe current members and their dates of admission are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCurrent membership consists of 31\u00a0countries. In addition to the 12\u00a0founding countries, four new members joined during the Cold War: Greece and Turkey (1952), West Germany (1955) and Spain (1982). In 1990, the territory of the former East Germany was added with the reunification of Germany. NATO further expanded after the Cold War, adding the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland (1999), Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia (2004), Albania and Croatia (2009), Montenegro (2017), North Macedonia (2020), and Finland (2023).[4] Of the territories and members added between 1990 and 2023, all were either formerly part of the Warsaw Pact (including the formerly Soviet Baltic states) or territories of the former Yugoslavia except for Finland. No countries have left NATO since its founding.\n\n\nCurrently, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization now covers a total area of 27,131,087\u00a0km2 (10,475,371\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), since the accession of Finland on 4 April 2023.\n\n\n\n### Membership aspirations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)NATO member states as of 2023.\nNATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is an international military alliance consisting of 31 member states from Europe and North America. It was established at the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty on 4 April 1949. Article\u00a05 of the treaty states that if an armed attack occurs against one of the member states, it shall be considered an attack against all members, and other members shall assist the attacked member, with armed forces if necessary.[1] Article\u00a06 of the treaty limits the scope of Article\u00a05 to the islands north of the Tropic of Cancer, the North American and European mainlands, the entirety of Turkey, and French Algeria, the last of which is moot. Thus, an attack on Hawaii, Puerto Rico, French Guiana, the Falkland Islands, Ceuta or Melilla, among other places, would not trigger an Article\u00a05 response.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCitations\n1. **^** \"The North Atlantic Treaty\".

However, Denmark allowed the U.S. to maintain an existing base, Thule Air Base (now Pituffik Space Base), in Greenland.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPew Research Center's 2016 survey among its member states showed that while most countries viewed NATO positively, most NATO members preferred keeping their military spending the same. The response to whether their country should militarily aid another NATO country if it were to get into a serious military conflict with Russia was also mixed. Roughly half or fewer in six of the eight countries surveyed say their country should use military force if Russia attacks a neighboring country that is a NATO ally. And at least half in three of the eight NATO countries say that their government should not use military force in such circumstances. The strongest opposition to responding with armed force is in Germany (58%), followed by France (53%) and Italy (51%). More than half of Americans (56%) and Canadians (53%) are willing to respond to Russian military aggression against a fellow NATO country. A plurality of the British (49%) and Poles (48%) would also live up to their Article\u00a05 commitment. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe defence spending of the United States is more than double the defence spending of all other NATO members combined.[22] Criticism of the fact that many member states were not contributing their fair share in accordance with the international agreement by then US\u00a0president Donald Trump caused various reactions from American and European political figures, ranging from ridicule to panic.[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nTotal Military budget of European NATO countries (excluding Turkey) as a percentage of US military budget.

A country scores a higher level of HDI when the lifespan is higher, the education level is higher, and the gross national income GNI (PPP) per capita is higher. It was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq and was further used to measure a country's development by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)'s Human Development Report Office.[1][2][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Human Development Report 2022 by the United Nations Development Programme was released on 8 September 2022 and calculates HDI values based on data collected in 2021.\n\n\nThe following countries ranked from 1 to 66 in the year 2021 are considered to be of \"very high human development\":[13]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe index does not take into account several factors, such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country. This situation tends to lower the ranking of some of the most developed countries, such as the G7 members and others.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Origins[edit]\n\n\nThe origins of the HDI are found in the annual Human Development Reports produced by the Human Development Report Office of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). These were devised and launched by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq in 1990, and had the explicit purpose \"to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people-centered policies\". Haq believed that a simple composite measure of human development was needed to convince the public, academics, and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being.\n\n\n\n![](image)The underlying principles behind the Human Development Index.[5]\n  \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nComposite statistic of life expectancy, education, and income indices\n\n\"HDI\" redirects here.

While the simple HDI remains useful, it stated that \"the IHDI is the actual level of human development (accounting for inequality), while the HDI can be viewed as an index of 'potential' human development (or the maximum level of HDI) that could be achieved if there were no inequality.\"[4]\n\n\nThe index is based on the human development approach, developed by Mahbub ul-Haq, anchored in Amartya Sen's work on human capabilities, and often framed in terms of whether people are able to \"be\" and \"do\" desirable things in life. Examples include \u2013 being: well fed, sheltered, and healthy; doing: work, education, voting, participating in community life. The freedom of choice is central \u2013 someone choosing to be hungry (e.g. when fasting for religious reasons) is quite different from someone who is hungry because they cannot afford to buy food, or because the country is in a famine.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** A.

The larger question is whether it is possible to shift the focus of policy from a battle between competing paradigms to a mechanism for eliciting information on well-being directly from the population.[20]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n### Indices[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Modern history portal\n* ![](image)World portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Nations, United (4 November 2010). \"Human Development Report 2010\".

They identified three sources of data error which are due to (i) data updating, (ii) formula revisions and (iii) thresholds to classify a country's development status and conclude that 11%, 21% and 34% of all countries can be interpreted as currently misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error, respectively. The authors suggest that the United Nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into development bins because: the cut-off values seem arbitrary, can provide incentives for strategic behavior in reporting official statistics, and have the potential to misguide politicians, investors, charity donors and the public who use the HDI at large.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n{\\displaystyle ={\\frac {\\ln({\\textrm {GNIpc}})-\\ln(100)}{\\ln(75,000)-\\ln(100)}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle ={\\frac {\\ln({\\textrm

The index incorporates three dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and decent living standards. Various indicators are used to quantify how countries perform on each dimension. The indicators used in the 2022 report were life expectancy at birth; expected years of schooling for children; mean years of schooling for adults; and gross national income per capita. The indicators are used to create a health index, an education index and an income index, each with a value between 0 and 1. The geometric mean of the three indices\u2014that is, the cube root of the product of the indices\u2014is the human development index. A value above 0.800 is classified as very high, between 0.700 and 0.799 as high, 0.550 to 0.699 as medium, and below 0.550 as low.[1][12][13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Developing countries | 0.513 | 0.569 | 0.638 | 0.673 | 0.687 | 0.691 | 0.687 | 0.685\n |\n| *Medium human development* | 0.453 | 0.506 | 0.582 | 0.627 | 0.643 | 0.645 | 0.642 | 0.636\n |\n| South Asia | 0.442 | 0.500 | 0.576 | 0.623 | 0.640 | 0.641 | 0.638 | 0.632\n |\n| Sub-Saharan Africa | 0.407 | 0.430 | 0.503 | 0.534 | 0.547 | 0.552 | 0.549 | 0.547\n |\n| Least developed countries | 0.357 | 0.408 | 0.487 | 0.520 | 0.537 | 0.542 | 0.542 | 0.540\n |\n| *Low human development* | 0.356 | 0.399 | 0.477 | 0.506 | 0.518 | 0.522 | 0.519 | 0.518\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of countries by Human Development Index by region\n\t+ Africa\n\t+ Asia and Oceania\n\t+ Europe\n\t+ Latin America\n* List of countries by inequality-adjusted Human Development Index\n* List of countries by planetary pressures\u2013adjusted Human Development Index\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** HDI not available before 2018 in latest report\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n![World map](image)Average annual HDI growth from 2010 to 2021 published in 2022* \u2265 1.4%\n* 1.2%\u20261.4%\n* 1%\u20261.2%\n* 0.8%\u20261%\n* 0.6%\u20260.8%\n* 0.4%\u20260.6%\n* 0.2%\u20260.4%\n* 0%\u20260.2%\n* \u22120.5%\u20260%\n* \u22121%\u2026\u22120.5%\n* < \u22121%\n* No data\n\nThe Human Development Report includes all 193[16] United Nations member states, as well as Palestine and Hong Kong SAR.

Some scholars have criticized how the factors are weighed, in particular how an additional year of life expectancy is valued differently between countries;[4][5] and the limited factors it considers, noting the omission of factors such as the levels of distributional and gender inequality.[6] In response to the former, the UNDP introduced the inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) in its 2010 report, and in response to the latter the Gender Development Index (GDI) was introduced in the 1995 report.[7][8] Others have criticized the perceived oversimplification of using a single number per country.[9][10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCountries ranked from 1 to 66 in 2021 are designated \"very high\" HDI; those ranked from 67 to 115 are designated \"high\" HDI; those ranked from 116 to 159 are denoted \"medium\" HDI; and those ranked from 160 to 191 are designated \"low\" HDI.[19][13]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe data used to calculate HDI comes mostly from United Nations agencies and international institutions, such as United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Rarely, when one of the indicators is missing, cross-country regression models are used. Due to improved data and methodology updates, HDI values are not comparable across human development reports; instead, each report recalculates the HDI for some previous years.[13][14]\n\n\n\n\n\nHDI dimensions and indicators[15]\n| Dimensions | Indicators | Dimension index | HDI\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Long and healthy life | Life expectancy at birth | Life expectancy index | Human Development Index\n |\n| Knowledge | Expected years of schoolingMean years of schooling | Education index\n |\n| A decent standard of living | GNI per capita (PPP $) | GNI index\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo reflect developmental differences within countries, a subnational HDI (SHDI) featuring data for more than 1,600 regions was introduced in 2018 by the Global Data Lab at Radboud University in the Netherlands.[10] In 2020, the UNDP introduced another index, the planetary pressures\u2013adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI), which decreases the scores of countries with a higher ecological footprint.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Dimensions and indicators[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 189 | ![Increase](image) (2) | ![](image)\u00a0Niger | 0.400 | ![Increase](image) 1.54% |\n| 190 | ![Decrease](image) (1) | ![](image)\u00a0Chad | 0.394 | ![Increase](image) 0.77% |\n| 191 | ![Decrease](image) (3) | ![](image)\u00a0South Sudan | 0.385 | ![Decrease](image) 1.00% |\n\n\n## Regions and groups[edit]\n\n\nThe Human Development Report also reports the HDI for various groups of countries.

It was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq and was further used to measure a country's development by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)'s Human Development Report Office.[1][2][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** A.

Commission of the European Communities. 1994.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2010 Human Development Report introduced an Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI). While the simple HDI remains useful, it stated that \"the IHDI is the actual level of human development (accounting for inequality), while the HDI can be viewed as an index of 'potential' human development (or the maximum level of HDI) that could be achieved if there were no inequality.\"[4]\n\n\nThe index is based on the human development approach, developed by Mahbub ul-Haq, anchored in Amartya Sen's work on human capabilities, and often framed in terms of whether people are able to \"be\" and \"do\" desirable things in life. Examples include \u2013 being: well fed, sheltered, and healthy; doing: work, education, voting, participating in community life. The freedom of choice is central \u2013 someone choosing to be hungry (e.g. when fasting for religious reasons) is quite different from someone who is hungry because they cannot afford to buy food, or because the country is in a famine.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe index does not take into account several factors, such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country. This situation tends to lower the ranking of some of the most developed countries, such as the G7 members and others.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Origins[edit]\n\n\nThe origins of the HDI are found in the annual Human Development Reports produced by the Human Development Report Office of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). These were devised and launched by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq in 1990, and had the explicit purpose \"to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people-centered policies\". Haq believed that a simple composite measure of human development was needed to convince the public, academics, and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being.\n\n\n\n![](image)The underlying principles behind the Human Development Index.[5]\n  \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2010, the UNDP reacted to the criticism and updated the thresholds to classify nations as low, medium, and high human development countries. In a comment to *The Economist* in early January 2011, the Human Development Report Office responded[18] to a 6 January 2011 article in the magazine[19] which discusses the Wolff *et al.* paper. The Human Development Report Office states that they undertook a systematic revision of the methods used for the calculation of the HDI, and that the new methodology directly addresses the critique by Wolff *et al.* in that it generates a system for continuously updating the human-development categories whenever formula or data revisions take place.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe HDI has extended its geographical coverage: David Hastings, of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, published a report geographically extending the HDI to 230+ economies, whereas the UNDP HDI for 2009 enumerates 182 economies and coverage for the 2010 HDI dropped to 169 countries.[15][16]\n\n\n\n## Country/region specific HDI lists[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Dimensions and calculation[edit]\n\n\n### New method (2010 HDI onwards)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)HDI trends between 1990 and 2021 \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| World\n OECD countries\n |  Developing countries: Arab States\n East Asia and the Pacific\n Europe and Central Asia\n Latin America and the Caribbean\n South Asia\n Sub-Saharan Africa\n |\n\n\nPublished on 4 November 2010 (and updated on 10 June 2011), the 2010 Human Development Report calculated the HDI combining three dimensions:[7][8]\n\n\n\n* A long and healthy life: Life expectancy at birth\n* Education: Mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling\n* A decent standard of living: GNI per capita (PPP international dollars)\n\n\nIn its 2010 Human Development Report, the UNDP began using a new method of calculating the HDI.

The larger question is whether it is possible to shift the focus of policy from a battle between competing paradigms to a mechanism for eliciting information on well-being directly from the population.[20]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n### Indices[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Modern history portal\n* ![](image)World portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEconomists Hendrik Wolff, Howard Chong and Maximilian Auffhammer discuss the HDI from the perspective of data error in the underlying health, education and income statistics used to construct the HDI. They identified three sources of data error which are due to (i) data updating, (ii) formula revisions and (iii) thresholds to classify a country's development status and conclude that 11%, 21% and 34% of all countries can be interpreted as currently misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error, respectively. The authors suggest that the United Nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into development bins because: the cut-off values seem arbitrary, can provide incentives for strategic behavior in reporting official statistics, and have the potential to misguide politicians, investors, charity donors and the public who use the HDI at large.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Gross National Happiness\n* Broad measures of economic progress\n* Corruption Perceptions Index\n* Democracy indices\n* Fragile States Index\n* Gender

It is the sum of the age-specific enrollment ratios for primary, secondary, post-secondary non-tertiary and tertiary education and is calculated assuming the prevailing patterns of age-specific enrollment rates were to stay the same throughout the child's life. Expected years of schooling is capped at 18 years. (Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics (2010). Correspondence on education indicators. March.

The index considers the health, education, income and living conditions in a given country to provide a measure of human development which is comparable between countries and over time.[1][2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe HDI was first published in 1990 with the goal of being a more comprehensive measure of human development than purely economic measures such as gross domestic product. The index incorporates three dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and decent living standards. Various indicators are used to quantify how countries perform on each dimension. The indicators used in the 2022 report were life expectancy at birth; expected years of schooling for children; mean years of schooling for adults; and gross national income per capita. The indicators are used to create a health index, an education index and an income index, each with a value between 0 and 1. The geometric mean of the three indices\u2014that is, the cube root of the product of the indices\u2014is the human development index. A value above 0.800 is classified as very high, between 0.700 and 0.799 as high, 0.550 to 0.699 as medium, and below 0.550 as low.[1][12][13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe HDI is the most widely used indicator of human development and has changed how people view the concept.[3][4] However, several aspects of the index have received criticism. Some scholars have criticized how the factors are weighed, in particular how an additional year of life expectancy is valued differently between countries;[4][5] and the limited factors it considers, noting the omission of factors such as the levels of distributional and gender inequality.[6] In response to the former, the UNDP introduced the inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) in its 2010 report, and in response to the latter the Gender Development Index (GDI) was introduced in the 1995 report.[7][8] Others have criticized the perceived oversimplification of using a single number per country.[9][10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe data used to calculate HDI comes mostly from United Nations agencies and international institutions, such as United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Rarely, when one of the indicators is missing, cross-country regression models are used. Due to improved data and methodology updates, HDI values are not comparable across human development reports; instead, each report recalculates the HDI for some previous years.[13][14]\n\n\n\n\n\nHDI dimensions and indicators[15]\n| Dimensions | Indicators | Dimension index | HDI\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Long and healthy life | Life expectancy at birth | Life expectancy index | Human Development Index\n |\n| Knowledge | Expected years of schoolingMean years of schooling | Education index\n |\n| A decent standard of living | GNI per capita (PPP $) | GNI index\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n![World map](image)Average annual HDI growth from 2010 to 2021 published in 2022* \u2265 1.4%\n* 1.2%\u20261.4%\n* 1%\u20261.2%\n* 0.8%\u20261%\n* 0.6%\u20260.8%\n* 0.4%\u20260.6%\n* 0.2%\u20260.4%\n* 0%\u20260.2%\n* \u22120.5%\u20260%\n* \u22121%\u2026\u22120.5%\n* < \u22121%\n* No data\n\nThe Human Development Report includes all 193[16] United Nations member states, as well as Palestine and Hong Kong SAR. However, the Human Development Index is not calculated for four of the UN member states: DPR Korea (North Korea), Monaco, Nauru, and Somalia. Some components of the index may be calculated for these countries. The Holy See (Vatican City), the Cook Islands, and Niue are the only state parties within the United Nations System that are not included in the report.[17] In total, the HDI is available for 191 nations.[2]\n\n\nGlobal Data Lab also provides data on the HDI of Somalia, putting it at 0.361 (2019), the lowest in the world.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Human Development Index (HDI) | Human Development Reports\". *hdr.undp.org*.
