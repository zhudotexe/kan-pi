A CDP is a concentration of population identified by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes. CDPs are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places such as cities, towns and villages. CDPs are populated areas that lack separate municipal government, but which otherwise physically resemble incorporated places. Unlike the incorporated cities in the main list, the US Census Bureau does not release annual population estimates for CDPs.\n\n\nThe table below contains the following information:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Albuquerque](image)\nAlbuquerque\n![Tucson](image)\nTucson\n![Fresno](image)\nFresno\n![Sacramento](image)\nSacramento\n![Kansas City](image)\nKansas City\n![Long Beach](image)\nLong Beach\n![Mesa](image)\nMesa\n![Atlanta](image)\nAtlanta\n![Colorado Springs](image)\nColorado Springs\n![Virginia Beach](image)\nVirginia Beach\n![Raleigh](image)\nRaleigh\n![Omaha](image)\nOmaha\n![Miami](image)\nMiami\n![Oakland](image)\nOakland\n![Minneapolis](image)\nMinneapolis\n![Tulsa](image)\nTulsa\n![Bakersfield](image)\nBakersfield\n![Arlington](image)\nArlington\n![Wichita](image)\nWichita\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of 50 largest cities by population in the United States\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n* ![map](image)North America portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** \"QuickFacts\".

As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an incorporated place includes cities, towns, villages, boroughs, and municipalities.[a] A few exceptional census-designated places (CDPs) are also included in the Census Bureau's listing of incorporated places.[b] Consolidated city-counties represent a distinct type of government that includes the entire population of a county, or county equivalent. Some consolidated city-counties, however, include multiple incorporated places. This list presents only the portion of such consolidated city-counties that are not a part of another incorporated place.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| City\n | State\n | 2022 estimate\n | 2020 census\n | Peak population\n | Percent decline from peak population\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Allegheny | Pennsylvania | NA\n | NA\n | 129,896\n | NA\n | Peak as an independent city, annexed by Pittsburgh in 1907.
