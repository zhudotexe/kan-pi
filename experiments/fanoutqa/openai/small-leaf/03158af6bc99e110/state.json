He is arguably the tallest player to have ever played in the NBA, at 7\u00a0feet 7\u00a0inches (2.31\u00a0m).[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an was born in Tritenii de Jos,[4][5] Cluj County, Romania. Although his parents' heights were relatively typical, he grew to his remarkable height due to a pituitary gland disorder called acromegaly.[6]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### CS Universitatea Cluj-Napoca (1991\u20131992)[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an played competitive basketball at Universitatea Cluj, becoming national champion in 1992.[7][8]\n\n\n\n### \u00c9lan B\u00e9arnais Pau-Orthez (1992\u20131993)[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an played professionally in the French league with Pau-Orthez during the 1992\u201393 season and was an instant hit with fans, also managing to win the French League Cup.[7]\n\n\n\n### Washington Bullets / Wizards (1993\u20131998)[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an was selected by the NBA's Washington Bullets in the 1993 NBA draft.[9] He played in the NBA from 1993 to 2000 showing signs of a promising career that was derailed by injuries. His best season came in the 1995\u20131996 campaign, when he averaged 14.5 points per game.\n\n\nMure\u0219an was named the NBA's Most Improved Player for the 1995\u201396 season after averaging 14.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, 2.26 blocks per game while making a league-leading 58.4 percent of his field goals. He led in field goal percentage again the following season, with a 60.4% average. Overall, he holds career averages of 9.8 points, 6.4 rebounds, 0.5 assists, 1.48 blocks per game and a .573 field goal percentage.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### New Jersey Nets (1999\u20132000)[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an joined the New Jersey Nets for the final 31 games of his NBA career.\n\n\n\n### Return to Pau-Orthez (2000\u20132001)[edit]\n\n\nAfter ending his NBA career, Mure\u0219an had another stint at Pau-Orthez where he won the French league before returning to the United States with his family.[7] He normally wore number 77, in reference to his height.\n\n\nOn 11 March 2007, Mure\u0219an played a game for the Maryland Nighthawks as part of the tallest lineup in the history of basketball.[10] This was the only basketball game Mure\u0219an played where he was not the tallest person on the court, as Sun Mingming is 7\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in (2.36\u00a0m).\n\n\n\n## Other work[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mure\u0219an meeting with Nicholas F. Taubman, the U.S. Ambassador to Romania\nIn 2004, Mure\u0219an founded the Giant Basketball Academy (GBA), a program dedicated to teaching the proper fundamentals of basketball to boys and girls of all ages.[11][6] The Academy is located in Ashburn, Virginia.[12]\n\n\nMure\u0219an is also part of the Washington Wizards marketing and public relations team,[6] serving as an \"ambassador\" for the team.[13]\n\n\nOutside basketball, Mure\u0219an has dabbled in acting, playing the title character in 1998 feature film *My Giant* starring comedian Billy Crystal.[14] He appeared as a ventriloquist in the music video for Eminem's breakthrough single \"My Name Is.\" He has appeared in commercials for Snickers candy bars, and sports television network ESPN. Most recently, Mure\u0219an co-authored two young adult fitness and health books: *The Boy's Fitness Guide* and *The Girl's Fitness Guide*.[15]\n\n\nIn 2013, Mure\u0219an participated in the first annual 3v3 UMTTR (You Matter) Basketball Tournament to increase awareness, prevention and research of teen suicide, the leading cause of death among adults and children between the ages of 15 and 24.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an and his wife Liliana and sons George and Victor have resided in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey,[16] but they relocated to the suburbs of Washington, D.C.[17] Since the 2016\u20132017 season, his oldest son, George, has played for the Georgetown University Hoyas as a walk-on forward. His younger son Victor joined the Hoyas as a walk-on in the 2020\u20132021 season. Victor is 6'10\" and 190 pounds.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n | \u00a0\u00a0GS\u00a0\n | Games started\n | \u00a0MPG\u00a0\n | Minutes per game\n |\n| \u00a0FG%\u00a0\n | Field goal percentage\n | \u00a03P%\u00a0\n | 3-point field goal percentage\n | \u00a0FT%\u00a0\n | Free throw percentage\n |\n| \u00a0RPG\u00a0\n | Rebounds per game\n | \u00a0APG\u00a0\n | Assists per game\n | \u00a0SPG\u00a0\n | Steals per game\n |\n| \u00a0BPG\u00a0\n | Blocks per game\n | \u00a0PPG\u00a0\n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n| \u00a0\\*\u00a0\n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### NBA[edit]\n\n\n#### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1993\u201394 | Washington | 54 | 2 | 12.0 | .545 | .000 | .676 | 3.6 | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.9 | 5.6\n |\n| 1994\u201395 | Washington | 73 | 58 | 23.6 | .560 | .000 | **.709** | 6.7 | 0.5 | 0.7 | 1.7 | 10.0\n |\n| 1995\u201396 | Washington | **76** | **76** | **29.5** | .584\\* | .000 | .619 | **9.6** | **0.7** | **0.7** | **2.3** | **14.5** |\n| 1996\u201397 | Washington | 73 | 69 | 25.3 | **.604\\*** | .000 | .618 | 6.6 | 0.4 | 0.6 | 1.3 | 10.6\n |\n| 1998\u201399 | New Jersey | 1 | 0 | 1.0 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\n |\n| 1999\u201300 | New Jersey | 30 | 2 | 8.9 | .456 | .000 | .605 | 2.3 | 0.3 | 0.0 | 0.4 | 3.5\n |\n| **Career** | 307 | 207 | 21.9 | .573 | .000 | .644 | 6.4 | 0.5 | 0.6 | 1.5 | 9.8\n |\n\n\n#### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1997 | Washington | 3 | 3 | 23.3 | .444 | \u2013 | .875 | 6.0 | .0 | .0 | 1.3 | 5.0\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n\n\n* List of tallest players in National Basketball Association history\n* List of tallest people\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Gheorghe Mure\u0219an\".

Bol played for the Bullets and three other teams over the course of his NBA career, which lasted from 1985 to 1995. A center, Bol is considered among the best shot-blockers in the history of the sport and is the only NBA player to retire with more career blocked shots than points scored. As of December 2022[update], he ranked second in NBA history in blocked shots per game and 16th in total blocked shots.\n\n\nBol was notable for his efforts to promote human rights in his native Sudan and aid for Sudanese refugees.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nManute Bol was born to Madute and Okwok Bol in Turalei, Sudan (now South Sudan), and raised near Gogrial.

Listed at 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m)[1] or 7\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in (2.31\u00a0m)[2] tall, Bol was one of the tallest players in the history of the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBol was also given tributes by former National Security Advisor Robert McFarlane, Sudan's Ambassador to the United States Akec Khoc Acieu, and vice president of the National Basketball Players Association Rory Sparrow.[70] Sparrow called Bol \"a giant off the court\" who should be remembered for humanitarian work and his basketball career.[70] Brownback recalled, \"He literally gave his life for his people. He went over [to Sudan], he was sick. He stayed longer than he should have. He probably contracted this ailment that took his life while in Sudan, and he didn't have to do that. He was an NBA basketball player. He could have stayed here and had an easy life. I've never seen anybody use his celebrity status more nor give his life more completely to a group of people than Manute Bol did. It makes me look at efforts that I do as not enough.\"\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the peak of his career, Bol was so widely recognizable in pop culture as to become the object of teasing in a 1993 episode of MTV's *Beavis and Butthead* entitled \"True Crime'\". While watching a music video of the song \"Demolition Man\" by Grace Jones, Butthead mistakes the tall, androgynous Jones for Bol and asks, \"Is this Manute Bol?\" Beavis responds, \"Yeah. That dude can slam dunk without even jumping\", to which Butthead deadpans, \"Yeah. It's too bad he can't sing,\" as the pair chuckle together. Later, Beavis says, \"Maybe this *isn't* Manute Bol\", and Butthead opines, \"Yeah. Manute Bol can sing better than this. That man has lipstick on.\"[88]\n\n\nBol was also referenced in numerous hip hop songs, including Big L's 1995 single \"M.V.P.\",[89] E-40's 1995 song \"Spittin'\",[90] and JAY-Z's 1997 song \"Where I'm From\".[91]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBol came from a family of extraordinarily tall men and women. He said: \"My mother was 6\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (2.08\u00a0m), my father 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m), and my sister is 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m). And my great-grandfather was even taller\u20147\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (2.39\u00a0m).\" His ethnic group, the Dinka, and the Nilotic people[8] of which they are a part, are among the tallest populations in the world. Bol's hometown, Turalei, is the origin of other exceptionally tall people, including 7 foot 3\u00bd inches tall (2.22 meters) basketball player Ring Ayuel.[9] \"I was born in a village where you cannot measure yourself,\" Bol reflected. \"I learned I was 7 foot 7 in 1979, when I was grown. I was about 18 or 19.\"[10]\n\n\nBol started playing soccer in 1972 but abandoned the game because he was too tall.[11] During his later teens, Bol started playing basketball in Sudan, for several years with teams in Wau and Khartoum, where he experienced prejudice from the northern Sudanese majority.[12]\n\n\n\n## Early basketball career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring his time in Egypt, Bol ran a basketball school in Cairo. One of his pupils was a fellow Sudanese refugee, former NBA player Luol Deng, the son of a former Sudanese cabinet minister. Deng later moved to the United States to further his basketball career, maintaining a close relationship with Bol.[65]\n\n\nIn July 2004, Bol was seriously injured in a car accident in Colchester, Connecticut; he was ejected from a taxi that hit a guardrail and overturned, resulting in a broken neck.[66] The driver was under the influence, with a suspended license.[67] Because his fortunes were mostly donated to Sudan, he was financially ruined because he had no health insurance.[45] When he recovered from his injuries, he moved to Olathe, Kansas.[42]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\nOn June 19, 2010, Bol died from acute kidney failure and complications from Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome at the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville, Virginia. He was 47.[42][68] He is buried in South Sudan.[69]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOff the court, Bol established a reputation as a practical joker; Charles Barkley, a frequent victim of his pranks, has attested to Bol's sense of humor.[47] Bol's one-time assistant coach Garry St. Jean recounted that Bol was fond of branding his teammates with humorous nicknames, such as \"Chalk\" for his Warriors teammate Chris Mullin (as a nod to Mullin's pale complexion). Bol developed a close friendship with Mullin and named one of his sons after him.\n\n\nNevertheless, Bol was reportedly short-tempered and sensitive to the frequent remarks or questions about his extreme height; on one occasion, when an elderly woman in an airport approached the towering Bol and asked \"how tall are you?\", Bol angrily retorted \"I didn't ask *you* how fat you are!\"[48]\n\n\nAs of 2023[update], Bol remains:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmbassador Khoc said, \"Manute had a very great heart for his country and people. He did everything to support anybody in need of shoes, blankets, health service, food, and people who were struggling. He went to see them and to encourage them to continue their struggle for their rights, for their freedoms. Manute embodied everything we can think of in Sudan. Reconciling warring groups between the north and south, in Darfur he was working for reconciliation between Darfur and the south and between Darfur and the rest of Sudan. So Manute was a voice for hope.\"\n\n\nSudan Sunrise founder Tom Prichard said that Bol's work to reconcile former enemies lives on. \"Manute's legacy and vision of education and reconciliation, his determination to grow grassroots reconciliation\u2014whether that reconciliation is expressed in a country that divides or holds together, wherever the boundary lines are drawn. Manute stood for grassroots reconciliation.\"[78] He added, \"There's no question Manute gave his life for his country.\"[79]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCoach Don Feeley, formerly the basketball coach at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, traveled to Sudan to coach and held clinics for the Sudanese national team in 1982. Feeley convinced Bol to go to the United States and play basketball.[13][14]\n\n\nWith Feeley's input, Bol first landed in Cleveland. According to Cleveland State University basketball coach Kevin Mackey, Bol could not provide a record of his birth date. Mackey listed it as October 16, 1962, on Cleveland State documents, but believed Bol was actually much older.[5][6][7] Bol did not speak or write English at the time of his arrival in Cleveland. He improved his English skills after months of classes at ESL Language Centers at Case Western Reserve University, but not enough to qualify for enrollment at Cleveland State. Bol never played a game for Cleveland State. Five years later, Cleveland State was placed on two years' probation for providing improper financial assistance to Bol and two other African players.[15][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen he arrived in the United States, Bol weighed 180 pounds (82\u00a0kg)[26] and had gained just under 20 pounds (9.1\u00a0kg) by the time he entered the NBA. The Bullets sent Bol to strength training with University of Maryland coach Frank Costello, where he could initially lift only 44 pounds (20\u00a0kg) on 10-repetition bench press and 55 pounds (25\u00a0kg) on 10-repetition squat[27] (his body mass index was 15.3 and he initially had a 31\" (80\u00a0cm) waist).[28] In 1987, the Bullets drafted the 5\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in (1.60\u00a0m) point guard Muggsy Bogues, pairing the tallest and shortest players in the league on the court for one season.[29][22][30]\n\n\n\n### Golden State Warriors (1988\u20131990)[edit]\n\n\nOn June 8, 1988, Bol was traded by the Bullets to the Golden State Warriors for Dave Feitl and a 1989 second round draft pick (Doug Roth was later selected).[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1994\u201395 NBA season Bol returned to the Warriors. He made the season-opening roster and played his last five NBA games. On a memorable mid-November night Bol finally made his home debut, coming off of the bench to play 29 minutes against the Minnesota Timberwolves. He attempted three three-pointers in the fourth quarter and made them all.[36] Seven nights later in Charlotte, in a game nationally televised by TNT, he was in the starting lineup again. By this time, two weeks into the season, his career seemed rejuvenated under Warrior head coach Don Nelson; he was again a defensive force, making threes and contributing as a starter to create matchup problems. After playing only ten minutes against the Hornets on November 22, 1994, he suffered a season-ending knee injury. Before he left the game, he recorded one block and two points and attempted a three-pointer in ten minutes of play.[36]\n\n\nBol was waived by Golden State on February 15, 1995.[35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the June 1983 draft, Lynam traveled to Cleveland and watched Bol play pickup games. In speaking with Bol, through a fellow Sudanese player, Lynam learned that he had become hesitant about playing professionally because he did not know the language well enough to understand coaches.[17] Lynam said, \"One of the things everyone was looking at was his passport. His passport said he was 19 years old. His passport also said he was five feet two.\" When Lynam asked Bol about the discrepancy between his real height and his passport height, Bol said he had been sitting down when measured by Sudan officials.[17]\n\n\nLanguage and passport concerns were set aside when the NBA ruled that Bol had not been eligible for the draft as he had not declared 45 days before the draft as required and declared the pick invalid.[18][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBol turned professional in May 1985, signing with the Rhode Island Gulls of the spring United States Basketball League.[19][20][21] Going into the 1985 NBA draft, scouts believed that Bol needed another year or two of college, but Bol opted for the draft because he felt it was the only way to earn enough money to get his sister out of Sudan, which was in a state of political unrest at the time.[18]\n\n\n\n### Washington Bullets (1985\u20131988)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* First in career blocks per 48 minutes (8.6), almost 50% beyond second-place Mark Eaton (5.8).[49]\n* Second in career blocks-per-game average (3.34).[50]\n* Eighteenth in total blocked shots (2,086).[51]\n* The only player in NBA history to have more blocked shots than points scored.[52][53]\n\n\n## Humanitarian efforts and activism[edit]\n\n\nBol was active in charitable causes during and after his basketball career. He said he spent much of the money he made during his NBA career supporting various causes related to the war-ravaged nation of his birth, Sudan.[54]\n\n\nBol frequently visited Sudanese refugee camps, where he was treated like royalty. In 2001 the Sudanese government offered him the post of minister of sport. Bol, a Christian,[55] refused because one of the conditions was converting to Islam.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nReleased by Miami, Bol's second stint with the Bullets lasted only two games in 1993\u201394. After that, he helped develop 7\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in (2.31\u00a0m) teammate Gheorghe Mure\u0219an.[35]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia 76ers (1994)[edit]\n\n\nAfter his release by Miami, Bol's second stint with the 76ers lasted four games, near the end of the 1993\u201394 season, helping to mentor 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m) teammate Shawn Bradley. In only 49 minutes, he played more aggressively than he did earlier in the season with Miami and Washington. He scored six points, grabbed six rebounds and blocked nine shots.[35]\n\n\n\n### Return to Golden State Warriors (1994)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Funeral service and tributes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bol's memorial service at the Washington National Cathedral\nBol's memorial service was held on June 29, 2010, at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, DC. His body lay in an eight-foot-long, specially-built casket.[70]\n\n\nAfter his death, tributes to Bol's career and charitable works came from around the United States and the world.[71][72][73] His former teams, and the NBA, issued statements in recognition of his impact on the sport of basketball and on Sudan.[74][75][76] U.S. Senator Sam Brownback paid tribute to Bol on the floor of the United States Senate.[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBol's first tenure with the Philadelphia 76ers lasted three seasons, from 1990 to 1993. He played a career-high 82 games in his first season as a 76er, but his production began to decline afterward (in both games played and per-game statistics). After playing in all 82 games in 1990\u201391, he played in 71 games the next season, and in 58 (a career low at the time) games the following season. During his last season in Philadelphia, he had a memorable night playing against former teammate Charles Barkley and the Phoenix Suns, hitting 6 of 12 three-pointers, all in the second half in a losing effort.[33] Fans were known to yell \"shoot\" as soon as Bol received the ball far from the basket.[34]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (1993)[edit]\n\n\nReleased by Philadelphia, Bol played in eight games in the 1993\u201394 season with the Miami Heat, the only team that did not use him as a starter. He scored only one two-point field goal with the team and blocked six shots in 61 total minutes.[35]\n\n\n\n### Washington Bullets (1993)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

He moved to the United States at age 16 and later played college basketball for the University of Central Florida (UCF). Fall went undrafted in the 2019 NBA draft, but later signed with the Boston Celtics. During his two seasons in Boston, he became a fan favorite.[1] He signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers as a free agent in 2021.[2]\n\n\nAt 7\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (2.29 metres), Fall was one of the tallest NBA players and is one of the tallest living humans.[3][4] At the 2019 NBA Draft Combine, his measurements set all-time NBA records for tallest height in shoes (7\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in; 2.31\u00a0m), longest wingspan (8\u00a0ft 2.25\u00a0in; 250\u00a0cm), and highest standing reach (10\u00a0ft 2.5\u00a0in; 3.11\u00a0m).[5] The NBA now lists players' heights without shoes, so Fall is listed at 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m).[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nFall was born and raised in Dakar, Senegal. In 2011, Senegalese basketball coach Ibrahima N'Diaye, the brother of former NBA player Mamadou N'Diaye, heard from a friend about an exceptionally tall teenager he had seen playing with friends in a local street.[8] After identifying him, they visited the 15-year-old Fall\u2014who already stood 7\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in (2.21\u00a0m) tall\u2014at his home and persuaded Fall's mother, Marianne Diop Sene, to allow Fall to start attending N'Diaye's basketball academy.[8] Fall moved to the United States at age 16. He first played organized basketball in Houston, Texas, and trained with NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon.[9]\n\n\nHe was listed as 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m) and was purportedly still growing around his senior year, making him the tallest high school basketball player in the country while he played for Jamie's House Charter and Liberty Christian Prep.[10]\n\n\nDue to his height and reach, Fall was one of the most highly scouted high school basketball centers in the nation.[*citation needed*] Fall first played for Jamie's House Charter School in Houston, where his team won the state championship. Fall played with ISTI all-stars summer travel team & for Each 1 Teach 1 on the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League (EYBL) circuit where he played alongside fellow class of 2015 recruits Antonio Blakeney and Ben Simmons.[11] He also played in several NCAA certified events, including the NBPA Top 100 Camp in Virginia.[12] Fall then attended Liberty Christian Preparatory School in Tavares, Florida. As a senior in 2015, Fall averaged 20 points, 15 rebounds, and 5.1 blocks per game. Rated as a four-star and three-star recruit in the 2015 high school class[13][14][15] and nearly forty different schools expressing interest in him,[10] Fall committed to the University of Central Florida in Orlando, who officially signed him on October 28, 2014. He played with the UCF Knights under head coach Donnie Jones.[16]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fall at UCF in 2017\nFall played college basketball at University of Central Florida for Knights as a center. He faced fellow giant Senegalese center Mamadou N'Diaye (unrelated to the former NBA player of the same name), who stands at 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m), in the tallest tip-off and match-up in US college basketball history in a game against University of California Irvine. Both men come from the same city, Dakar. By his sophomore year, after N'Diaye declared for the 2016 NBA draft, Fall became the tallest player in college basketball. During his sophomore season, Fall would make considerable improvements in his playing style.[*citation needed*] In 2017, Fall was named American Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year.[17]\n\n\nFall grew to be an efficient player, ranking second nationally in field goal percentage as of January 2017.[18] On April 5, 2017, Fall declared for the 2017 NBA draft, with the possibility of returning to Central Florida still available to him before the end of the draft lottery that year.[19][20] On May 24, 2017, Fall withdrew his name from consideration for the NBA draft, to return to UCF for his junior year.[21] During his junior year, Fall injured his shoulder,[22] causing him to only play in 16 games, totaling 351 minutes.[23] Coming into his senior season, Fall was named to the Preseason Second Team All-AAC. During his senior season, Fall helped lead the Knights to the 2019 NCAA tournament and secured their first victory in program history with a win over Virginia Commonwealth University.[24] In his final game, Fall recorded 15 points and six rebounds in a losing effort against Duke University 77\u201376.[25]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\nAfter the conclusion of his senior year, Fall was named one of 80 participants (40 representing the NBA draft hopefuls) for the NBA G League Elite Camp on May 12\u201314.[26] By the end of the event, Fall later got transferred into the NBA Draft Combine as one of an additional 11 participants there.[27] During the combine, he put up new records at the event, including height (which received comparisons to former NBA player Manute Bol),[28] wingspan, and standing reach.[29]\n\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (2019\u20132021)[edit]\n\n\nDespite going undrafted in the 2019 NBA draft, Fall was signed to an Exhibit 10 Contract on June 21, 2019, by the Boston Celtics.[30][31] Fall played for the Celtics during the 2019 NBA Summer League season,[32] scoring six points in his first game alongside four rebounds; in his second game he tallied twelve points for his first double-digit scoring game, alongside another rebound. He had one blocked shot in each of his first two games.[33] Fall concluded his 2019 Summer League run participating in all five games with the Celtics and averaging 7.2 points, 4.0 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, and shooting a team-high 77 percent from the field.[34]\n\n\nOn July 25, 2019, the Celtics officially announced that they had signed Fall.[35] On October 13, 2019, the Celtics officially announced that they had signed Fall to a two-way contract, splitting time between the Celtics and Maine Red Claws.[36] Fall made his debut for the Celtics on October 26 during a game against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. He played for four minutes, scoring four points and grabbing three rebounds, with his first points coming from a standing dunk.[37] On December 20, Fall recorded a season-high five points, along with two rebounds and one block, in a 114\u201393 win over the Detroit Pistons.[38] On August 13, 2020, he logged season-highs of four rebounds and two blocks in a 90\u201396 loss to the Washington Wizards.[39] Fall led the Celtics in field goal percentage during the 2019\u201320 season.\n\n\nIn the G League for the Red Claws, Fall averaged a double-double of 12.9 points and 11.1 rebounds per game. He earned All-Defensive Team honors, with averages of nearly three blocks per game.[40][41]\n\n\nOn November 23, 2020, Fall re-signed with the Boston Celtics on a two-way contract, allowing him to play for the Celtics and Maine Red Claws in the 2020\u201321 season.[42][43] On December 30, he made his season debut for the Celtics, recording two points, one rebound and two blocks in a 126\u2013107 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.[44] On January 15, 2021, Fall logged a season-high six points, along with five rebounds and one block, in a 124\u201397 blowout win over the Orlando Magic.[45] On May 5, he recorded a season-high four blocks in a 132\u201396 blowout win over the Orlando Magic.[46] On May 16, he grabbed a season-high eight rebounds in a 92\u201396 loss to the New York Knicks.[47] Despite being under a two-way contract, Fall never played in the G League during the 2020\u201321 season due to the Red Claws not playing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[48] He also led the Celtics in field goal percentage for the second season in a row.\n\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers (2021\u20132022)[edit]\n\n\nOn September 27, 2021, Fall signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers.[2] On October 16, his deal was converted to a two-way contract with the Cleveland Charge.[49] On November 11, Fall made his debut for the Charge, logging a G League career-high 23 points along with 12 rebounds and three blocks in 29 minutes of play.[50] On December 22, Fall made his first career NBA start in a 111\u2013101 loss to the Boston Celtics, where he grabbed a career-high 10 rebounds and a season-high 4 points.

He became fluent in English within eight months and scored in the 95th percentile on the SAT. He was a computer science major at UCF[18] and originally had aspirations of becoming an engineer for electronic companies such as Siemens or Microsoft.[3]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Tacko Fall earns two-way contract with Cavs after solid preseason\". *NBC Sports*.

He also represented the Montenegrin national basketball team in the international competitions. Standing at 2.29\u00a0m (7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in),[1][2][3] he was one of the tallest players in the world.\n\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\nVrane\u0161 started playing basketball in the Serbian club FMP \u017deleznik. Still a junior, he was snapped up by the Turkish club Efes Pilsen for the 2000\u201301 season. Then he returned to his native country in January 2001,[4] where he played for Budu\u0107nost Podgorica until the summer of 2003.\n\n\nVrane\u0161 was selected by the National Basketball Association's New York Knicks in the second round of the 2003 NBA draft.[5][6][7] He was waived by the Knicks in December 2003 before ever playing a game for them.[8] In early January 2004, he signed a ten-day contract with Portland Trail Blazers. Before his contract expired, he played one game in the 2003\u201304 NBA season.\n\n\nThat one game for Portland ended up being Vrane\u0161 first and only game in the NBA.

Bradley came from a tall family: his father Reiner Bradley (1949\u20132010) was 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m) tall, and his mother Teresa was 6\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in (1.83\u00a0m).[6] Bradley was already 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m) by the end of junior high school (age 13\u201314), and by the end of his junior year of high school (age 16\u201317) he had grown to 7\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in (2.26\u00a0m), one inch shy of his adult height of 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m).[7] In 2018, genetic analysis of Bradley's DNA showed that his great height is not the result of any physical or genetic disorders, but because he happened to inherit a natural but extremely rare combination of the thousands of genetic variants that determine human height.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNot to be confused with Shaun Bradley or Sean Bradley.\n\nAmerican former basketball player\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter his retirement as a player, Bradley became involved with West Ridge Academy, a coeducational private school for at-risk youths in West Jordan, Utah. Bradley's role with the school involves some of the functions of a vice principal, counselor, and coach. Describing Bradley, school executive director Ken Allen said, \"Shawn has a great presence\u2014due to his size\u2014and has immediate credibility with the kids. His instant credibility when he's talking to kids makes him an incredible mentor. He is a great example of someone who has worked hard and been very successful. Being so tall wasn't always easy for him. He knows about being the 'odd kid' and dealing with that.\"[30]\n\n\nOn March 19, 2010, Bradley filed papers to run as a Republican against incumbent Democratic Representative Tim Cosgrove for the 44th District seat in the Utah House of Representatives.[31][32] On November 2, 2010, Bradley lost the election to Cosgrove, earning 46.49% of the vote against Cosgrove's 51.13%.[33]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30. **^** Luhm, Steve (February 7, 2007). \"Shawn Bradley: A big man on campus\". *Salt Lake Tribune*.

Nicknamed \"**the Stormin' Mormon**\",[1] Bradley is one of the tallest players in NBA history at 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m). Bradley was born in Landstuhl, West Germany, as his family was stationed at the U.S. military base medical facility, and grew up in Castle Dale, Utah.[2][3] He holds citizenship in both the United States and Germany.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBradley was raised on a farm outside the small town of Castle Dale, Utah.[7] He and his siblings were raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Bradley was a standout basketball, football, and baseball player at Emery High School from 1987 to 1990. He was one of the most successful basketball players in Utah high school history, finishing with career averages of 20.3 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 5.4 blocked shots per game.[9] During his time at the school, Emery compiled a 68\u20134 record and won two state championships. Bradley was named All-State three times and twice earned the season MVP award. In his senior year, he averaged 25 points, 17 rebounds, and 9 blocks per contest. He was named All-American by several national publications, including *Parade Magazine*, *Street and Smith*, *USA Today*, and others. He turned in a strong performance at the McDonald's All-American Game (12 points, 10 rebounds, and 6 blocks), earning the Most Valuable Player award for the West team. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBradley has participated in many charitable endeavors. In the 2000\u201301 season he donated $25 for each blocked shot to Bryan's House, a managed facility for children affected by HIV and AIDS. He is a national spokesman for the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.[25][34] Bradley has also participated in the \"Basketball Without Borders\" program with other NBA players like Dikembe Mutombo, DeSagana Diop and Malik Rose and found his experiences with children in Africa uplifting.[35] He has also participated in treating leprosy colonies in India through the Rising Star Outreach.[36]\n\n\nWhile in the NBA, Bradley was fined for refusing to attend a mandatory meeting at a strip club, due to his religious beliefs.[37]\n\n\nBradley and his first wife, Annette Evertson, had six children together. They later divorced, and in 2017, Bradley married Carrie Cannon, adopting her three children in 2019.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBradley has competed internationally for Germany; he and Dallas teammate Dirk Nowitzki were members of the German national basketball team that finished in fourth place at the EuroBasket 2001 in Turkey. In order to participate in this tournament, Bradley made use of his birth by a German mother to obtain German citizenship.[29]\n\n\n\n## Post-basketball career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBradley had a role in the film *Space Jam* in 1996,[40] depicted as one of the NBA stars who lose their talent alongside Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, and Patrick Ewing. He also appeared as himself in an episode of *Walker, Texas Ranger*,[40] and had a cameo appearance as an auto mechanic in *The Singles Ward* movie.[40] In 2011, he appeared in a music video tribute to Jimmer Fredette, along with former BYU football star Chad Lewis and legendary coach LaVell Edwards.[41] He has also appeared in an episode of *Studio C*.[42]\n\n\nBradley was featured in the ESPN 30 for 30 short documentary \"Posterized\" given his propensity \"for being on the wrong end of a lot of great dunks.\"[43]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Bradley (left) with the Mavericks in 2005\nBradley embraced yet another \"fresh start\" with a new franchise. With increased playing time in Dallas, Bradley posted some of the best numbers of his career. In a game against the Clippers, he tied his career high by scoring 32 points\u2014the most ever by a center in the history of the Mavericks franchise. He also added a season-high 16 rebounds in that same contest. He finished the year with averages of 13.2 points and 8.4 rebounds per game\u2014breaking career highs set during the previous season. But most importantly, Bradley provided strong defense in the paint that Dallas had been lacking before his arrival. In fact, Bradley finished the year as the top shot-blocker in the entire league, averaging 3.4 swats per contest. It was the first time any Mavericks player had ever led the NBA in any statistical category.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"NBA.com/Stats\".

June 4, 1994.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn January 20, 2021, Bradley was struck from behind by a motorist while riding his bicycle near his home in St. George, Utah, which resulted in a traumatic spinal cord injury in his neck that left him paralyzed.[39] A driver attempted to pass Bradley on the left in the same travel lane while Bradley himself was in the process of passing another car parked on the shoulder of the road.\n\n\nIn a 2022 interview with *Sports Illustrated*, Bradley stated that he and his family intend to move into a more wheelchair-friendly home in Dallas, Texas, while he continues his rehabilitation. Bradley described his height as a \"hindrance\" to his recovery, as quadriplegia at his height has no medical precedent.[38]\n\n\n\n## TV and movie appearances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite these highlights, Bradley continued to baffle and frustrate Philadelphia with his inconsistent play. Just 12 games into his third season (1995\u201396), the 76ers traded Bradley to the New Jersey Nets for Derrick Coleman. He played the final 67 games of the year with the Nets, and tantalized Nets fans with some strong play in the second half of the season. In February, he dominated a match-up against fellow giant Gheorghe Mure\u0219an, leading the Nets to a 99\u201381 victory against the Washington Bullets. Bradley scored a season-high 27 points over the 7-foot-7 Mure\u015fan, and also added 9 rebounds and 4 blocked shots.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBYU received a bid to the NCAA tournament that season, and Bradley continued his dominant defense. In the first-round game against Virginia, he set a tournament single-game record with 10 blocked shots, leading the Cougars to a 61\u201348 victory.[13] However, he struggled with foul trouble in the second round (he received 5 personal fouls in the game), and BYU lost to Arizona, 76\u201361.[14] Bradley collected several awards and honors for his outstanding freshman season. He was named the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Freshman of the Year, in addition to All-WAC defensive team and newcomer team honors. He was also named Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press (AP)[15]\n\n\nBradley took a two-year leave of absence from BYU from 1991 to 1993 to serve as a full-time missionary for the LDS Church. He was assigned to serve in Sydney, Australia. After his mission, Bradley decided to forgo his final three years of NCAA eligibility and declared for the NBA draft.\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of 2015, Bradley still holds Utah state records for blocked shots in a single game (18), season (209), and career (605).[10]\n\n\n\n## College career and LDS mission[edit]\n\n\nBradley was heavily recruited by many colleges from across the United States, but ultimately decided to play at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. During his freshman season (1990\u201391), he started all 34 games for BYU, averaging 14.8 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. But his main contribution to the team was shot-blocking: he led the entire nation in total blocks (177) and average (5.2 per game)\u2014setting an NCAA freshman record in both categories.[11] In one game against Eastern Kentucky (EKU), Bradley blocked 14 shots, tying the NCAA single-game record set by Navy's David Robinson in 1986. In that same game, Bradley also established a new career high by scoring 29 points.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBradley returned to full strength in his second season, playing in all 82 games for the 76ers. His scoring actually declined slightly (9.5 points per game), but his rebounding and shot-blocking increased. He racked up 274 rejections, setting a franchise record for most blocks in a single season. Bradley gave Philly fans a glimpse of his potential in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers in November, posting career highs of 28 points and 22 rebounds in a 97\u201383 victory. He also tied a career high with 9 blocked shots, and was credited with 9 additional \"intimidations\" as the Clippers were held to their lowest-ever point total against the 76ers.[22] He finished the season in strong fashion, posting 13 double-doubles in his last 17 games.\n\n\n\n### New Jersey Nets (1995\u20131997)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBradley played 7 more seasons in the league, remaining with the Mavericks until his retirement in 2005. Over that span, his playing time slowly declined, mainly due to some injuries and constant juggling of the team's lineups and rotations by coach Don Nelson. In particular, Bradley's offensive role became very limited, but he remained an imposing defensive presence. In fact, in the 2000\u201301 season, he broke his own team record by blocking 228 shots for Dallas\u2014the highest total in the NBA that year. The Mavericks emerged as a perennial playoff contender, mostly due to the rise of star players such as Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash, but Bradley's defense made a significant contribution. He finished his career with averages of 8.1 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in 23.5 minutes of action per game. [28]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor much of his career, Bradley was inconsistent in scoring and rebounding, but he always excelled at blocking shots. He averaged 10.3 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks per game in his first season \u2013 good enough to earn NBA All-Rookie Second Team honors. He shot 40.9 percent from the floor and constantly struggled with turnovers and foul trouble. He suffered a season-ending injury in February of that year, dislocating his kneecap in a collision with Portland's Harvey Grant.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnd yet, Bradley continued to be plagued by the maddening inconsistency that defined his entire professional career. During the 1997\u201398 season, Dallas coach Jim Cleamons experimented by bringing Bradley off the bench in several games (instead of his usual role as starter). In one particular game, it paid off in a major way: Bradley totaled 22 points, 22 rebounds, and a career-high 13 blocked shots in an April contest against the Trail Blazers. Bradley became the fifth NBA player to record at least 20 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 blocks in a single game, and the first to do so off the bench.[11] The previous players to record a 20\u201320\u201310 game with points, rebounds, and blocks were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Elvin Hayes, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Shaquille O'Neal. Bradley finished the year with a team-record 214 blocked shots; his average of 3.3 per game ranked third in the NBA.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBradley lifted his game to new levels in March 1996. He posted a career-high 32 points and added 15 rebounds against Dallas early in the month,[24] and set another career high a week later with 10 blocked shots against the Phoenix Suns. He recorded his first career triple-double in the very next game, tallying 19 points, 17 rebounds, and a career-best 11 blocked shots in another match-up against Mure\u015fan and the Bullets. In April, Bradley posted back-to-back triple-doubles (against Boston and Toronto); in the process, he became the first player in NBA history to record consecutive games of double-figure blocked shots twice in a single season.[25] His season averages for 1995\u201396 were 11.9 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.7 blocks per game[26]\u2014all career highs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Philadelphia 76ers (1993\u20131995)[edit]\n\n\nBradley entered the 1993 NBA draft as one of the most intriguing and highly debated prospects in the history of the NBA draft. Supporters claimed his tremendous size and surprising athleticism would allow him to dominate the league. Critics argued that he would struggle in the NBA due to his thin build \u2013 listed at just 230 pounds (100\u00a0kg), he was described by Ric Bucher of The Miami Herald as \"rail-thin,\" and Lee Rose, player personnel director for the Milwaukee Bucks at the time, said, \"Size-wise, he'll get pushed around a little bit,\"[16] \u2013 and lack of experience (just one season of college basketball, followed by a two-year hiatus from the sport due to his church mission).[17] Ultimately, he was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with the second overall pick, behind Chris Webber and ahead of Penny Hardaway. Given the novelty of a 7-foot-6 center playing for the 76ers, Bradley was issued jersey number 76.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPhiladelphia's management saw Bradley as a major project with huge long-term potential. The team acquired legendary big man Moses Malone to serve as a mentor for Bradley, hoping to develop his skills in the low post.[18] Also, the franchise hired strength and conditioning consultant Pat Croce and registered dietitian Jeanie Subach, as well as assistant coach Jeff Ruland, to add bulk to Bradley's skinny frame.[19] His rookie season (1993\u201394) produced mixed results. In his first game, Bradley totaled just 6 points and 5 rebounds, but he did manage to block 8 shots in 25 minutes.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\n1993 NBA draft\n |\n| --- |\n| First round | * Chris Webber\n* Shawn Bradley\n* Anfernee Hardaway\n* Jamal Mashburn\n* Isaiah Rider\n* Calbert Cheaney\n* Bobby Hurley\n* Vin Baker\n* Rodney Rogers\n* Lindsey Hunter\n* Allan Houston\n* George Lynch\n* Terry Dehere\n* Scott Haskin\n* Doug Edwards\n* Rex Walters\n* Greg Graham\n* Luther Wright\n* Acie Earl\n* Scott Burrell\n* James Robinson\n* Chris Mills\n* Ervin Johnson\n* Sam Cassell\n* Corie Blount\n* Geert Hammink\n* Malcolm Mackey\n |\n| Second round | * Lucious Harris\n* Sherron Mills\n* Gheorghe Mure\u0219an\n* Evers Burns\n* Alphonso Ford\n* Eric Riley\n* Darnell Mee\n* Ed Stokes\n* John Best\n* Nick Van Exel\n* Conrad McRae\n* Thomas Hill\n* Rich Manning\n* Anthony Reed\n* Adonis Jordan\n* Josh Grant\n* Alex Holcombe\n* Bryon Russell\n* Richard Petru\u0161ka\n* Chris Whitney\n* Kevin Thompson\n* Mark Buford\n* Marcelo Nicola\n* Spencer Dunkley\n* Mike Peplowski\n* Leonard White\n* Byron Wilson\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMcDonald's All-American Game \u2013 Boys' MVPs\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1978: Woods\n* 1979: Daye\n* 1980: Cross\n* 1981: Branch & Sherrod\n* 1982: Winters\n* 1983: Bennett\n* 1984: Williams\n* 1985: Lambiotte\n* 1986: Reid\n* 1987: Macon\n* 1988: Mourning & Owens\n* 1989: Hurley & O'Neal\n* 1990: Bradley\n* 1991: Webber & Brunson\n* 1992: Harrington\n* 1993: Vaughn & Stackhouse\n* 1994: L\u00f3pez\n* 1995: Garnett\n* 1996: Holloway\n* 1997: Gregory\n* 1998: R.

Reed had been a big believer in Bradley, but Calipari and Nash weren't nearly as excited about the 7-foot-6 enigma. In an effort to save some cash against the salary cap, the Nets traded their big center (and his big contract) to the Dallas Mavericks in a blockbuster mid-season deal that involved nine players.[27]\n\n\n\n### Dallas Mavericks (1997\u20132005)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2000\u201301 | Dallas | 10 | **10** | **25.6** | **.529** | .000 | **.769** | **7.1** | **0.5** | **0.4** | **3.9** | **6.4** |\n| 2001\u201302 | Dallas | 7 | 0 | 3.6 | .500 | .000 | .000 | 0.7 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.1 | 0.9\n |\n| 2002\u201303 | Dallas | **17** | 7 | 14.5 | .400 | .000 | .750 | 3.8 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.8 | 2.9\n |\n| 2003\u201304 | Dallas | 2 | 0 | 1.5 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\n |\n| 2004\u201305 | Dallas | 7 | 0 | 3.9 | .667 | .000 | .500 | 0.9 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.3 | 1.3\n |\n| Career\n | 43 | 17 | 13.0 | .478 | .000 | .741 | 3.4 | 0.2 | 0.2 | 1.1 | 3.0\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNCAA Division I men's basketball season blocks leaders\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1986: Robinson\n* 1987: Robinson\n* 1988: Blake\n* 1989: Mourning\n* 1990: Green\n* 1991: Bradley\n* 1992: O'Neal\n* 1993: Ratliff\n* 1994: Livingston\n* 1995: Closs\n* 1996: Closs\n* 1997: Foyle\n* 1998: J.

After negotiating with the CBA and the Sharks to secure his release, Yao was selected by the Rockets as the first overall pick in the 2002 NBA draft. He reached the NBA playoffs four times, and the Rockets won the first-round series in the 2009 postseason, their first playoff series victory since 1997. In July 2011, Yao announced his retirement from professional basketball because of a series of foot and ankle injuries which forced him to miss 250 games in his last six seasons.[2] In eight seasons with the Rockets, Yao ranks sixth among franchise leaders in total points and total rebounds, and second in total blocks.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2004, Yao co-wrote an autobiography with ESPN sportswriter Ric Bucher, entitled *Yao: A Life in Two Worlds*.[146] In the same year, he was also the subject of a documentary film, *The Year of the Yao*, which focuses on his NBA rookie year.[147] The film is narrated by his friend and interpreter, Colin Pine.[148] In 2005, former *Newsweek* writer Brook Larmer published a book entitled *Operation Yao Ming*, in which he said that Yao's parents were convinced to marry each other so that they would produce a dominant athlete, and that during Yao's childhood, he was given special treatment to help him become a great basketball player.[9] In a 2015 AMA post on Reddit, Yao stated that this was not true and that he started playing basketball for fun at age 9.[149] In 2009, Yao provided the voice for a character of a Chinese animated film, *The Magic Aster*, released on June 19.[150]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n120. **^** \"Yao Ming realizes his Olympic dream\". *China Daily*.

The agreement entitled Evergreen to 33% of Yao's earnings,[9] but the contract was later determined to be invalid.[16]\n\n\nAs American attention on Yao grew, Chinese authorities also took interest. In 2002, the Chinese government released new regulations that would require him and other Chinese players to turn over half of any NBA earnings to the government and China's national basketball association, including endorsements as well as salaries.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** Beech, Hannah (April 28, 2003). \"China's Incredible Hulk of the hard court becomes an NBA sensation\". *Time Magazine*.
