Abdul-Jabbar had previously set the record on April 5, 1984,[328] 8 months before James was born. After James broke the record, the NBA stopped the game for an on-court ceremony, where he gave a speech and then embraced Abdul-Jabbar, as well as his family.[329][330] James missed the following three games due to left ankle soreness.[331][332] On February 19, Team LeBron lost the 2023 NBA All-Star Game 184–175 to Team Giannis, marking the first time that James lost an All-Star game as a captain. Prior to the game, he had been undefeated (5–0) as a captain, and since the format was changed in 2018.[333] During the game, he suffered a right hand contusion and was ruled out for the entire 2nd half.[334]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n166. **^** \"LeBron James leads all scorers with 35 points as Heat take Game 2\".

He played one season of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns and was selected as the second overall pick by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 2007 NBA draft. He played nine seasons with the franchise, which became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008, before signing with the Golden State Warriors in 2016, winning consecutive NBA championships and NBA Finals MVP Awards in 2017 and 2018. After sustaining an Achilles injury in the 2019 finals, he joined the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent that summer. Following disagreements with the Nets' front office, he requested a trade during the 2022 offseason and was traded to the Suns in 2023.

In recent years, he has contributed to *The Players' Tribune* as both a photographer and writer. In 2012, he ventured into acting, appearing in the film *Thunderstruck*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDurant was born on September 29, 1988, in Washington, D.C.,[5] to Wanda (*née* Durant) and Wayne Pratt.

The academy conducted private training, camps, and clinics at the 24 Hour facility in Pearl City, Hawaii. In late 2010, Wilkins starred with Verne Troyer in the TitleMax \"short on cash?\" television commercial campaign.\n\n\nAccording to ESPN, Wilkins was attacked by former NBA referee Rashan Michel after a 2011 Hawks–Magic game at Philips Arena in Atlanta. Michel claimed that Wilkins owed him money for a suit provided to Wilkins. Afterward, according to the police, Michel attacked Wilkins by punching him in the chest.[28]\n\n\nRecently Wilkins released the first of his private label wines under the Wilkins Private Reserve label. He took an interest in fine wines while playing professionally in Italy at the end of his career and owning a private label was one of his long-term goals.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 2014 Wilkins, whose father and grandfather both died of diabetic complications, filmed a commercial for Novo Nordisk's Victoza citing their commitment to raising awareness of diabetes in the urban community, with an emphasis on children's nutrition.[30]\n\n\nOn March 6, 2015, the Atlanta Hawks organization unveiled a statue of Wilkins that sits in front of then-titled Philips Arena, and now State Farm Arena.[31]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nWilkins's stepson, Isaiah Wilkins, played for the University of Virginia and was the 2018 ACC Defensive Player of the Year.[32]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWilkins returned to dunking prominence in 1989–90 by edging out the Sacramento Kings' Kenny Smith for his second NBA Slam-Dunk championship. He averaged 26.7 points to finish fifth in the NBA scoring race. He led the Hawks in steals for the first time since 1985–86, finishing with 126. His .484 field-goal percentage was the best since his rookie season, and for the sixth straight year he did not foul out of a game. Nonetheless, Atlanta struggled to a 41–41 record in Mike Fratello's last season as head coach, failing to make the playoffs for only the second time in Wilkins's career.\n\n\n\n#### Final years in Atlanta (1990–1994)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn August 1995, Pavlos and Thanassis Giannakopoulos, presidents of Panathinaikos, asked \"who is the best player worldwide right now\", Dominique Wilkins was the answer and after that the well known phrase of Pavlos Giannakopoulos stayed in European Basketball history \"Bring him yesterday, not now, yesterday\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWilkins was instrumental in the Hawks' prominence in the 1980s, when the club recorded four consecutive 50-win seasons during the decade. As Wilkins entered his thirties and the Hawks needed more of an all-around contribution from their star, Wilkins averaged 9.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists during the 1990–91 season.\n\n\nA nine-time NBA All-Star and the winner of two NBA slam dunk contests, Wilkins registered 26,668 points and 7,169 rebounds in his NBA career. As of 2021, he ranks 14th on the NBA scoring list.[9]\n\n\nWilkins's nickname was \"The Human Highlight Film\" for his athletic ability and highlight reel dunks. His trademark dunk was a powerful one- or two-handed windmill dunks he used to capture the slam dunk contest titles in 1985 and 1990. As a basketball player, he was known as an acrobatic scorer, somewhat of a gunner, though an outstanding finisher and one of the greatest dunkers in NBA history.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWilkins was born in Paris while his father was stationed in France as an officer in the U.S. Army. He has a younger brother, Gerald Wilkins, who also played in the NBA, mainly for the New York Knicks. His family moved to Dallas and Baltimore before settling in Washington, North Carolina, where he attended Washington High School. He was the back-to-back MVP for the team's consecutive Class 3-A State Championships (1978–1979). Wilkins was in the \"Faces in the Crowd\" section of *Sports Illustrated* while in high school for a performance in a game vs. a higher classification school in which he scored 48 points, had 27 rebounds, 9 dunks, and 8 blocks. Wilkins then starred in the McDonald's All-American Game, the Capital Classic, the Kentucky Derby Festival Classic, and the Dapper Dan Classic all-star games. He had 16 points and 12 rebounds in the McDonald's game, 26 points in the Capital Classic, and 22 points in the Derby Classic.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWilkins exploded into the NBA's elite circle in 1985–86, winning the league scoring title with an average of 30.3 points per game. He was an NBA All-Star for the first time and was voted to the All-NBA First Team at the end of the season. He failed in his bid to repeat as NBA Slam-Dunk champion, his competition coming from an unlikely source. The Hawks had signed 5-foot-7 Anthony \"Spud\" Webb as a free agent prior to the season, and Webb dazzled the All-Star Saturday crowd in Dallas by soaring more than 4 feet (1.2 m) to the basket on each of his dunk attempts. Atlanta turned its fortunes around in dramatic fashion, winning 16 more games in the 1985–86 season to finish 50–32 for the year. Wilkins scored 57 points in one game and ranked among the Hawks' leaders in rebounding (7.9 rpg), steals (138), and free-throw percentage (.818). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\nIn the 1991–92 season, Wilkins's ruptured his Achilles tendon against the Philadelphia 76ers on January 28, 1992. He underwent surgery on January 30. He also scored the 20,000th point of his career, becoming only the 16th player at the time to reach that plateau. On the day of the injury, Wilkins was named a reserve on the Eastern Conference All-Star Team. His 28.1 scoring average was his highest in five years, and the 52 points he scored in a double-overtime game on December 7 against the New York Knicks were the most by an NBA player that season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe following season, Wilkins recovered from his injury.[10] He scored an average of 27.7 points per game in the first month of the season. On December 8, he set an NBA record of free throws made in a game without a miss, hitting 23 free throws against the Chicago Bulls. He then suffered a setback when he fractured the ring finger on his right hand on December 15, sitting out the next 11 games. He returned to rack up 29.4 points per game on .487 shooting in January, then added 31.5 points per game on .519 shooting in February. By the end of the season, his scoring average was up to 29.9, second in the league behind Michael Jordan's 32.6. When Wilkins scored his 31st point in a February 2 game against the Seattle SuperSonics, he broke Bob Pettit's franchise scoring record of 20,880 points. He had developed into a full-fledged three-point threat, hitting 120 of 316 attempts from long range to shatter his previous career bests. He was later selected to the All-NBA Second Team. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWilkins was selected third overall (behind James Worthy and Terry Cummings) by the Utah Jazz in the 1982 NBA draft. However, Wilkins was not willing to play in Utah; the team wanted him to play power forward, while he wanted to play small forward.[6] At the same time, the Jazz were reeling from cash flow problems. As a result, the Jazz traded Wilkins to the Atlanta Hawks several months after the draft for John Drew, Freeman Williams and $1 million in cash.[7] The trade is now considered among the most lopsided deals in NBA history,[8] as Drew and Williams would play a combined four seasons for the Jazz.\n\n\nWilkins averaged more than 25 points per game for ten consecutive seasons, and captured a scoring title in 1985–86 with an average of 30.3 points per game.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWilkins averaged a career-high 9.0 rebounds in 1990–91, leading the Hawks in that category for the first time in his nine NBA seasons. He also led the team in scoring for the eighth straight year, finishing at 25.9 points per game—seventh best in the NBA. He registered a career-high 265 assists while developing a three-point shot he would use more and more in the later stages of his career. He hit 85-of-249 from long range for a .341 percentage, by far his most prolific three-point numbers to date. Wilkins made his sixth All-Star Game appearance, scoring 12 points in the East's 116–114 victory over the West. He was selected to the All-NBA Second Team for the third time in his career. Atlanta returned to the playoffs after a year's absence, drawing the defending NBA champion Detroit Pistons in the first round. The Hawks pushed the Pistons to a fifth game, but Detroit routed Atlanta, 113–81, in Game 5. Wilkins averaged 20.8 points in the five games, but shot .372 from the field and .133 from three-point range.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWilkins returned to play his last season in the NBA, during the 1998–99 campaign, alongside his brother Gerald Wilkins, with the Orlando Magic. In 27 games, he averaged 5.0 points per game and 2.6 rebounds per game.\n\n\n\n### Slam dunk contests[edit]\n\n\nWilkins participated in five slam dunk contests, winning two. His first was in 1984, in Denver. Wilkins finished third, behind Larry Nance and Julius Erving. In 1985, in Indianapolis, he beat Michael Jordan in the finals. In Dallas in 1986, a Jordan-Wilkins rematch was put on hold, since Jordan was injured. Wilkins reached the finals where he was defeated by his 5'6\" teammate, Spud Webb.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter playing as a reserve the previous year, Wilkins became the first Atlanta Hawks player to start in an NBA All-Star Game since Eddie Johnson in 1981. Wilkins finished the year second in the league in scoring (29.0 ppg) to Michael Jordan's 37.1 points per game. He scored the 10,000th point of his career against the Chicago Bulls on April 16 and was named to the All-NBA Second Team at the season's end. Atlanta went into the season with high expectations after a 50–32 mark the previous year, and the Hawks totaled a franchise-record 57 victories. Doc Rivers, Kevin Willis, Tree Rollins, and Mike McGee contributed as the club made it through the first round of the NBA playoffs before losing in the Eastern Conference semifinals to the Detroit Pistons. Wilkins averaged 26.8 points during the postseason, the second of six straight playoffs in which he would average at least 20 points.\n\n\n\n#### Late 80s (1987–1990)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 1989 season with the Hawks, Wilkins's scoring average dropped slightly to 26.2, good for seventh in the league, but he was an All-Star for the fourth straight year. He shot a career-best .844 from the free-throw line and ranked second on the Hawks with 117 steals. Basketball writers selected him to the All-NBA Third Team at season's end. The Hawks added Reggie Theus and Moses Malone to the team in 1988–89. Malone averaged 20.2 points and finished fourth in the league with his 11.8 rebounding average. Theus averaged 15.8 points. Without 7-foot (2.1 m) Kevin Willis, however, who missed the entire season with a fractured left foot, Atlanta lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round. Wilkins averaged 27.2 points in the playoffs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHis #21 jersey was retired by the Hawks on January 13, 2001. He is one of five players whose jerseys have been retired by the Hawks.\n\n\n\n#### Early years (1982–1987)[edit]\n\n\nWilkins notched his first Slam-Dunk Championship at the NBA All-Star Weekend in Indianapolis during the 1984–85 season. He went on to finish the season with a 27.4 scoring average, good for sixth in the NBA. He ranked second on the Hawks in rebounding (6.9 rpg) and steals (135). For the first of two straight seasons, he led the NBA in field-goal attempts, with 1,891. After going 0-for-11 from the three-point line the previous season, Wilkins made 25 of 81 three-point shots in 1984–85. He also shot better than 80 percent from the free throw line for the first of 10 consecutive seasons. Despite Wilkins's efforts, Atlanta finished 34–48 and failed to reach the playoffs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWilkins showed no signs of fading in his 12th NBA season, even after a tumultuous midseason trade. After 11½ years with the Atlanta Hawks, Wilkins was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers on February 24 in exchange for Danny Manning. This is still the only time in NBA history a team in first place in their conference traded its leading scorer after the All-Star break. Prior to the trade Wilkins averaged 24.4 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 2.3 assists for Atlanta, leading the club to a 36–16 record. At midseason he appeared in his eighth NBA All-Star Game. Hawks management and new coach Lenny Wilkens claimed Manning and his skills would help the team more during the stretch run. However, many[*who?*] believed that money was the primary reason the Hawks made the trade. Wilkins's contract expired at the end of the season, and the Hawks may not have been willing to commit a new long-term contract to a player who was almost 35 years old.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1987–88 season, Wilkins posted the highest scoring average of his career and finished second to Jordan in the NBA scoring race. He averaged 30.7 points for the Hawks, but Jordan bested him at 35.0. Jordan also defeated Wilkins for the Slam Dunk Championship at the NBA All-Star Weekend in Chicago. Wilkins earned a berth on the All-NBA Second Team and became the first Hawks player to be named NBA Player of the Week three times in a season. In his third straight All-Star Game appearance, Wilkins scored 29 points on 12-of-22 shooting, leading the East squad to a 138–133 victory.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWilkins returned to the NBA before the 1996–97 season, signing a contract as a free agent with the San Antonio Spurs, to solidify their bench scoring. Wilkins led the team with an average of 18.2 points per game in 1996–97. He would be the last Spur to wear #21 before Tim Duncan.\n\n\n\n### Fortitudo Bologna (1997–1998)[edit]\n\n\nHowever, after one season, Wilkins once again went overseas, this time signing a contract with Teamsystem Bologna of the Italian League, for the 1997–98 season. With Bologna, he averaged 17.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 1.7 assists, in 33.5 minutes per game, in 34 games played in the Italian League.[22] With Bologna, he also averaged 17.9 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 1.7 assists, in 33.8 minutes per game, in 20 games played in the FIBA EuroLeague 1997–98 season.[23]\n\n\n\n### Orlando Magic (1999)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWilkins entered the University of Georgia in 1979 with a reputation as an exciting player and left as the “Human Highlight Film”. He averaged 21.6 points a game over his Bulldogs career and was named SEC Men's Basketball Player of the Year in 1981.[4][5] Likely to go as one of the very top picks of the 1982 NBA draft, he left college after his junior year.\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Atlanta Hawks (1982–1994)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Wilkins, who has a family history of diabetes, met with New York congressman Vito Fossella in 2008 to discuss the escalating crisis of the disease in the United States\nSince 2004, Wilkins has served as the Hawks' Vice President of Basketball. He works in a variety of management functions within the franchise's basketball and business areas. Wilkins is responsible for advising the Hawks's senior management team on basketball-related issues and is a goodwill ambassador for the community.[24] Wilkins also serves as a color analyst for Hawks games on Bally Sports, pairing with long-time play-by-play announcer Bob Rathbun.\n\n\nWilkins was a judge in the 2008 NHL All-Star Game Breakaway Challenge, which was held in Atlanta.[25]\n\n\nIn 2009 Wilkins participated in the McDonald's All-Star Celebrity Game during NBA All-Star Weekend[26] and in the 2009 NBA Asia Challenge against a team of Philippine Basketball Association All-Stars. He led all scorers with 28 points in 20 minutes of play.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn addition to his 11 seasons with the Hawks, Wilkins had short stints with the Los Angeles Clippers, the Boston Celtics, Panathinaikos Athens (a professional team in Greece's top-tier level Greek Basket League, with whom he won his first titles, the FIBA European League and the Greek Cup), Fortitudo Bologna (a professional team in Italy's top-tier level LBA), the San Antonio Spurs, and the Orlando Magic before he retired in 1999. As a member of the U.S. men's national team, Wilkins won gold at the 1994 FIBA World Championship.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and high school career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWilkins became a free agent after the 1993–94 season and signed with the Boston Celtics. Shortly after the signing, he helped Dream Team II to a gold medal at the 1994 World Championship of Basketball. In his lone season with the Celtics, the team reached the playoffs but was eliminated in the first round by the Orlando Magic. Wilkins averaged 19.0 points for the series. He also holds the honor of scoring the Celtics final point at the old Boston Garden, before it closed in 1995, in their game four loss to the Magic.\n\n\n\n### Panathinaikos (1995–1996)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe top-seeded Hawks lost in the conference semifinals to the Indiana Pacers. Wilkins left Atlanta as the team's all-time leading scorer with 23,292 points. In his final 25 games of the season Wilkins averaged 29.1 points and 7.0 rebounds. On March 25 he returned to Atlanta in a Clippers uniform and tallied 36 points and 10 rebounds against his former team. Overall, Wilkins's 26.0 scoring average ranked fourth in the NBA. He concluded the season with 24,019 career points, placing ninth on the NBA's all-time list.\n\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (1994–1995)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 1988 Slam Dunk Contest featured a rematch between Wilkins and Jordan. Jordan won in the final, beating Wilkins by two points. Wilkins's first two dunks of the finals earned scores of 50 from judges. On his third and final attempt, Wilkins's completed a thunderous windmill dunk from the left side. Soaring high above the floor, Wilkins's head nearly hit the rim. Wilkins received a standing ovation from players and fans in attendance, but was awarded a low score of 45. The judges opened the door for Jordan to win the Chicago-based event with a score of only 48. Jordan closed out the event with 50-point dunk, taking perhaps the contest's most controversial crown.\n\n\nIn 1990 Wilkins made his final appearance in the Slam Dunk Contest, going up against new promising stars such as Kenny Smith, Scottie Pippen and Kenny Walker (the 1989 champion). He defeated Kenny Smith of the Sacramento Kings in the final round.\n\n\n\n## Post-playing career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAtlanta (50–32) won at least 50 games for the third straight season and advanced to the 1988 Eastern Conference Semifinals before losing to the Boston Celtics in seven games. In Game 7 on May 22, Wilkins and Larry Bird carried their respective teams to a thrilling finish, trading bucket for bucket in the fourth quarter until Boston won with a 118–116 victory. Wilkins finished with 47 points and Bird had 34-with 20 of his points tallied in the fourth quarter. \"The basket was like a well,\" remembered Wilkins. \"I couldn't miss. He couldn't miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I've ever played in or seen played.

After being chosen by the Boston Celtics with the 10th overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft, Pierce spent the first 15 years of his career with Boston. Pierce's nickname, \"**the Truth**\", was given to him by Shaquille O'Neal on March 13, 2001. He starred as captain of the Celtics, earning 10 All-Star selections and becoming a four-time All-NBA team member. Pierce combined with Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in 2007 to form a \"Big Three\" that led Boston to two NBA Finals and an NBA championship in 2008. Pierce was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player in 2008. In October 2021, Pierce was honored by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. Along with Larry Bird and John Havlicek, Pierce is one of only three players to have scored more than 20,000 career points with the Celtics.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPierce was selected with the 10th overall pick in 1998 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics, a team he \"despised\" growing up.[6] He scored 19 or more points in 10 of his first 11 contests. For that year, he averaged 16.5 points and finished third in the voting for Rookie of the Year honors. In his second season, he raised his scoring average to 19.5 points per game.[7] In the 2000–01 season, Pierce appeared in 82 games (all starts), averaging 25.3 points, 6.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.68 steals in 38.0 minutes. He led the Celtics and finished eighth in the league in points per game and fourth in total points (2,071). He was named NBA Player of the Month for March 2001 after averaging 30.3 points, 7.2 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 1.60 steals for the month.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** \"After Game 3 drama, Celtics 1 win from a sweep\". sports.yahoo.com-TIM REYNOLDS.

In the second round, the Celtics took on the Miami Heat and their big three of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh. The Celtics lost to Miami, who eventually moved on to the NBA Finals, in five games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Most free throws made without a miss, playoffs: **21** (Game 1, 2003 Eastern Conference First Round).\n* Most points scored in one half, playoffs: **32** (Game 4, 2003 Eastern Conference First Round vs. Indiana Pacers).\n* Highest scoring average through one month: **33.5 PPG** (February 2006).\n* Only Celtics player in franchise history to lead the NBA in total points scored in a season, scoring **2,144** points in 2001–02.\n* Oldest Celtics player to score 40 points in a game: **35 years, 2 months, and 6 days old** (December 19, 2012 vs Cleveland Cavaliers)[84]\n* Pierce is the Celtics' second all-time leading scorer behind John Havlicek.

In Game 3 of the conference finals, the Celtics pulled off the greatest fourth-quarter comeback in NBA playoff history, with Pierce scoring 19 of his 28 points in the final 12 minutes as Boston overcame a 21-point deficit to beat the New Jersey Nets 94–90.[8] The win gave the Celtics a 2–1 advantage in the series; however, the Nets went on to win the series in six games.\n\n\nFrom 2002 to 2006, Pierce made the All-Star team every season.[5] He led the league in total points (2,144) in 2002[9] and was an All-NBA Third Team selection in 2002 and 2003.[10]\n\n\n\n#### NBA champion and Finals MVP (2007–2008)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn September 26, 2016, Pierce announced that the 2016–17 season would be his last in the NBA.[45] In what would be his last game in Boston, on February 5, 2017, Pierce started and played the first five minutes before heading to the bench—it was his first appearance for the Clippers since New Year's Eve. Although the crowd chanted his name in the final minutes, Pierce did not re-enter the game until there was 19 seconds left; he hit a three-pointer to finish the game for his only points of the contest.[46] On April 10, 2017, he scored all of his 10 points in the final five minutes of the Clippers' 125–96 win over the Houston Rockets.[47] He subsequently moved into 15th on the NBA career scoring list with 26,397 points.[48] The Clippers finished the regular season with a 51–31 record and entered the playoffs as the No. 4 seed. They went on to lose their first-round playoff series to the Utah Jazz in seven games, as Pierce's 19-year NBA career came to an end at the final buzzer of Game 7 on April 30, 2017. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Pierce in his lone season with the Brooklyn Nets\nOn June 28, 2013, the day of the NBA draft, the Boston Celtics and Brooklyn Nets reached a deal to trade Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Jason Terry for future first-round picks in the 2014, 2016, and 2018 drafts and Kris Humphries, Gerald Wallace, Kris Joseph, MarShon Brooks, and Keith Bogans.[21] The deal was completed on July 12, 2013. Brooklyn also received D. J. White and the Celtics also received the right to swap first-round picks in the 2017 draft.[22] Pierce convinced Garnett to waive his no-trade clause so that the deal could come to fruition.[23] At an introductory press conference with Garnett and Terry following the trade, Pierce stated, \"We are championship driven... We made a lot of money in our careers. We have won a number of awards. At this point right now, we are about winning a championship. Brooklyn gives us the best opportunity.\"[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Pierce with the Wizards in 2014\nOn July 17, 2014, Pierce signed a two-year, $11 million contract with the Washington Wizards.[29][30] With 14 points against the Atlanta Hawks on November 25, 2014, Pierce passed Jerry West for 17th place on the NBA's career scoring list.[31] Two weeks later, Pierce passed Reggie Miller for 16th place on the NBA's career scoring list with a season-high 28 points against the Boston Celtics.[32] On January 14, 2015, Pierce passed Jason Kidd for fourth all-time in three-pointers made in a 105–99 win over the Chicago Bulls.[33] Eleven days later, he recorded his 2,000th career three-pointer in a 117–115 overtime win over the Denver Nuggets.[34][35] On February 2, 2015, he passed Alex English for 15th place on the NBA's career scoring list with 11 points against the Charlotte Hornets.[36] Pierce finished the regular season averaging 11.9 points per game, a career low.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a junior in 1997–98, Pierce won Most Valuable Player honors in both the Preseason NIT and the Big 12 Conference tournament. He was selected First Team All-Big 12 Conference by both the AP and Coaches, and was named Associated Press First Team All-American and a finalist for the 1998 John Wooden and Naismith awards. He scored 777 points as a junior—the fifth-most single-season point total in Jayhawks history. He ranks as the fifth-leading scorer in Kansas history (1,786 points) and 11th on the all-time rebounds list (676).[5]\n\n\nPierce left the University of Kansas following his junior season and entered the 1998 NBA draft.\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (1998–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pierce attempting a dunk in January 2000.\n#### Early years and breakthrough (1998–2007)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPierce was born in Oakland, California.

He was cut from Inglewood High's varsity basketball team during his freshman and sophomore years and seriously thought about transferring before spending extra time in the gym and becoming the \"best player on the team\" by the end of his junior year.[1] In his senior year, he averaged 27 points, 11 rebounds, and 4 assists per game.[2] Pierce went on to participate in the 1995 McDonald's All-American Game alongside future NBA stars Kevin Garnett, Vince Carter, Stephon Marbury, and Antawn Jamison, and was a contestant in the game's Slam Dunk Contest, which was won by Carter. He grew up a Los Angeles Lakers fan and dreamed of playing for the team.[3]\n\n\nIn 2012, Pierce was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans.[4]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn August 2018, Pierce discussed battling depression for a year after his stabbing, revealing that he dealt with paranoia over crowds and post-traumatic stress stemming from the incident. He divulged this information as part of the NBA's initiative to focus on the mental health of its players.[71]\n\n\n\n### Nickname[edit]\n\n\nPierce's nickname, \"the Truth\", was bestowed on him by Shaquille O'Neal after a 112–107 Los Angeles Lakers victory over the Celtics on March 13, 2001, in which Pierce scored 42 points on 13-of-19 shooting.[72] O'Neal pulled *Boston Herald* reporter Steve Bulpett over and gestured toward his notepad. \"Take this down,\" said O'Neal. \"My name is Shaquille O'Neal and Paul Pierce is the motherfucking truth. Quote me on that and don't take nothing out. I knew he could play, but I didn't know he could play like this. Paul Pierce is The Truth.\"[73][74]\n\n\n\n### 2022 EthereumMax lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cryptocurrency bubble and Cryptocurrency and crime\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nPierce and his ex-wife[65] Julie (née Landrum) have three children; two daughters, Prianna and Adrian, and a son, Prince.[66]\n\n\n\n### Stabbing incident[edit]\n\n\nOn September 25, 2000, Pierce was stabbed 11 times in the face, neck, and back and had a bottle smashed over his head while at the Buzz Club, a late-night dance club in the Boston Theater District. He had to undergo lung surgery to repair the damage.[67][68] Nevertheless, Pierce was the only Celtics player to start all 82 games in the 2000–01 season.[69] Tony Battie, Pierce's teammate at the time, along with Battie's brother, saved him by rushing him to a nearby hospital. In 2003, two and a half years after the attack, Pierce pledged $2.5 million to help expand the high-tech surgical center at Tufts-New England Medical Center that helped make his recovery possible. Pierce stated, \"This is an opportunity for me to give back to the hospital that was there for me when I needed it.\"[70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn July 10, 2015, Pierce signed a three-year, $10 million contract with the Los Angeles Clippers.[40][41] He made his debut for the Clippers in the team's season opener against the Sacramento Kings on October 28, recording 12 points and 7 rebounds off the bench in a 111–104 win.[42] With Lance Stephenson starting at small forward, Pierce began the season as a role player off the bench for the first time in his career.[43] On December 16, Pierce scored six points against the Milwaukee Bucks. In the game, he hit a buzzer-beater to end the first quarter and became the fifth active player and 16th in NBA history to reach 26,000 points.[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"Colossal collapse: Nets allow Celtics to pull off biggest comeback ever\". *SportsIllustrated.cnn.com*.

He scored 1,000 points for the 15th straight season, becoming the only active NBA player and the sixth player in NBA history (along with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, John Havlicek, Elvin Hayes, Robert Parish) to score 1,000 points in 15 straight seasons.[25] He passed Allen Iverson and Patrick Ewing on the NBA's all-time scoring list (moving up to 18th in NBA history), moved into fifth place in all-time NBA history with 1,935 career three-pointers made, and had his most steals (86) in a season since 2007–08.[26] On April 11, 2014, against Atlanta, Pierce became the fourth active player (along with Kobe Bryant, Dirk Nowitzki and Garnett) and the 18th player in NBA history to score 25,000 career points.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn February 7, 2012, during a game against the Charlotte Bobcats, Pierce scored 15 points to pass Larry Bird for second place on the Boston Celtics' all-time scoring list. He was named to his tenth NBA All-Star appearance on February 9, 2012. He then played his 1,000th career game with the Celtics on March 9, 2012, against the Portland Trail Blazers; only Pierce, John Havlicek, and Robert Parish have played in over 1,000 career games for the Celtics.

Pierce missed only one game the entire season and led the team in scoring. He was named to the 2009 NBA All-Star Game and for the first time to the All-NBA Second Team. Despite Pierce's success, with Kevin Garnett injured, the Celtics lost in the second round of the 2009 NBA Playoffs.\n\n\nAt the 2010 NBA All-Star Game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, Pierce became the first Celtic since Larry Bird to win the Three-Point Contest.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn May 9, 2015, Pierce made a two-point shot with three defenders on him at the buzzer to defeat the Atlanta Hawks 103–101 and take a 2–1 series lead in the Eastern Conference semi-finals. He finished the game with 13 points and 7 rebounds.[37] In Game 6 of the series on May 15, the Wizards were down 94–91 with seconds remaining when Pierce launched a three-pointer, hoping to extend the Wizards' season by forcing overtime. The shot swished, apparently tying the score at the buzzer, but the play was reviewed, showing the clock expired before Pierce released the basketball.[38]\n\n\nOn June 27, 2015, Pierce opted out of the second year of his contract with the Wizards to become a free agent.[39]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Clippers (2015–2017)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n57. **^** Balluck, Kyle (April 6, 2021). \"ESPN fires Paul Pierce over racy Instagram Live video\". *The Hill*.

On February 10, 2013, against the Denver Nuggets, Pierce recorded his second triple-double of the season with 27 points, 14 rebounds, and 14 assists becoming the oldest player, in a game of any length, to record at least 20 points, 12 rebounds, and 12 assists (previously held by Larry Bird).
