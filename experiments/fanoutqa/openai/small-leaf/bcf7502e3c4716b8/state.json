In the case of some rivers such as the Columbia, the length listed in the table below is solely that of the main stem. In the case of others such as the Mackenzie, it is the combined lengths of the main stem and one or more upstream tributaries, as noted. Excluded from the list are rivers such as the Dauphin, a short connecting link between lakes Manitoba and Winnipeg, with main stems of 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) or less. Also excluded are rivers such as the Mississippi, the main stems of which do not enter Canada even though some of their tributaries do.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLongest rivers of Canada\n| **#** | **Name** | **Mouth** | **Length**[3] | **Source**[n 1] | **Watershedarea**[3] | **Discharge**[3][5] | **Provinces, states** | **Image** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Mackenzie River | Beaufort Sea69\u00b021\u203259\u2033N 133\u00b054\u203210\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff69.36639\u00b0N 133.90278\u00b0W\ufeff / 69.36639; -133.90278\ufeff (Mackenzie River (mouth))[6] | 4,241\u00a0km2,635\u00a0mi[n 2] | Thutade Lake56\u00b044\u203200\u2033N 127\u00b031\u203200\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff56.73333\u00b0N 127.51667\u00b0W\ufeff / 56.73333; -127.51667\ufeff (Finlay River (source)) | 1,805,200\u00a0km2697,000\u00a0mi2 | 9,700\u00a0m3/s340,000\u00a0ft3/s | Northwest Territories | ![A frozen river passes through flat country.

The Yenisey divides the Western Siberian Plain in the west from the Central Siberian Plateau to the east; it drains a large part of central Siberia.\n\n\nIt is the central one of three large Siberian rivers that flow into the Arctic Ocean (the other two being the Ob and the Lena). The maximum depth of the Yenisey is 61 metres (200\u00a0ft) and the average depth is 14 metres (45\u00a0ft).\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map including the Yenisey River\nThe Yenisey proper, from the confluence of its source rivers Great Yenisey and Little Yenisey at Kyzyl to its mouth in the Kara Sea, is 3,487\u00a0km (2,167\u00a0mi) long. From the source of its tributary Selenga, it is 5,075\u00a0km (3,153\u00a0mi) long.[10] It has a drainage basin of 2,580,000\u00a0km2 (1,000,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[11] The Yenisey flows through the Russian federal subjects Tuva, Khakassia[*citation needed*] and Krasnoyarsk Krai. The city of Krasnoyarsk is situated on the Yenisey.[12]\n\n\n\n### Tributaries[edit]\n\n\nThe largest tributaries of the Yenisey are, from source to mouth:[11][13]\n\n\n\n* Little Yenisey (left)\n* Great Yenisey (right)\n* Khemchik (left)\n* Kantegir (left)\n* Abakan (left)\n* Tuba (right)\n* Mana (right)\n* Bazaikha (right)\n* Kacha (left)\n* Kan (right)\n* Angara (right)\n* Kem (left)\n* Bolshoy Pit (right)\n* Sym (left)\n* Dubches (left)\n* Podkamennaya Tunguska (right)\n* Bakhta (right)\n* Yeloguy (left)\n* Nizhnyaya Tunguska (right)\n* Turukhan (left)\n* Kureyka (right)\n* Khantayka (right)\n* Bolshaya Kheta (left)\n* Tanama (left)\n\n## Lake Baikal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lake Baikal\n\nA significant feature of the Upper Yenisei is Lake Baikal, the deepest and oldest lake in the world.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)The river flowing through the Shushensky Forest\n## Brekhovskie Islands[edit]\n\n\nThe Brekhovskie Islands (Russian-language article: *\u0411\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430*) lie in the Yenisey estuary and have an area of some 1,400,000 hectares. They provide a wetland habitat for rare and endangered birds and are an internationally important nesting and breeding area for several types of waterfowl.[15] The most north-easterly of the islands, Nosonovskij Ostrov (\"Nose Island\") was visited by Fridtjof Nansen in 1913.[16]\n\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nThe Yenisey basin (excluding Lake Baikal and lakes of the Khantayka headwaters) is home to 55 native fish species, including two endemics: *Gobio sibiricus* (a gobionine cyprinid) and *Thymallus nigrescens* (a grayling).[17] The grayling is restricted to Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l Nuur and its tributaries.[17] Most fish found in the Yenisey basin are relatively widespread Euro-Siberian or Siberian species, such as northern pike (*Esox lucius*), common roach (*Rutilus rutilus*), common dace (*Leuciscus leuciscus*), Siberian sculpin (*Cottus poecilopus*), European perch (*Perca fluviatilis*) and Prussian carp (*Carassius gibelio*). The basin is also home to many salmonids (trout, whitefish, charr, graylings, taimen and relatives) and the Siberian sturgeon (*Acipenser baerii*).[17]\n\n\nThe Yenisey valley is habitat for numerous flora and fauna, with Siberian pine and Siberian larch being notable tree species. In prehistoric times Scots pine, *Pinus sylvestris*, was abundant in the Yenisey valley c.\u20096000 BC.[18] There are also numerous bird species present in the watershed, including, for example, the hooded crow, *Corvus cornix*.[19]\n\n\n\n### Taimyr reindeer herd[edit]\n\n\nThe Taimyr herd of tundra reindeer (*Rangifer tarandus* *sibiricus*), the largest reindeer herd in the world,[20][21] migrates to winter grazing ranges along the Yenisey.[22]:\u200a336 It had an estimated 800,000-850,000 individuals as of 2010, but has peaked at over one million.[23]\n\n\n\n## Navigation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Inclined plane at Krasnoyarsk Dam\nRiver steamers first came to the Yenisey River in 1864 and were brought in from Holland and England across the icy Kara Sea. One was the SS Nikolai. The SS Thames attempted to explore the river, overwintered in 1876, but was damaged in the ice and eventually wrecked in the river. Success came with the steamers Frazer, Express in 1878, and the next year, Moscow hauling supplies in and wheat out. The Dalman reached Yeniseisk in 1881.\n\n\nImperial Russia placed river steamers on the massive river in an attempt to free up communication with land-locked Siberia. One boat was the SS St. Nicholas which took the future Tsar Nicholas II on his voyage to Siberia, and later conveyed Vladimir Lenin to prison.\n\n\nEngineers attempted to place river steamers in regular service on the river during the building of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The boats were needed to bring in the rails, engines and supplies. Captain Joseph Wiggins sailed the Orestes with rail in 1893. However, the sea and river route proved very difficult with several ships lost at sea and on the river. Both the Ob and Yenisey mouths feed into very long inlets, several hundred kilometres in length, which are shallow, ice bound and prone to high winds and thus treacherous for navigation. After the completion of the railway, river traffic reduced only to local service as the Arctic route and long river proved much too indirect a route.\n\n\nThe first recreation team to navigate the Yenisey's entire length, including its violent upper tributary in Mongolia, was an Australian-Canadian effort completed in September 2001. Ben Kozel, Tim Cope, Colin Angus and Remy Quinter were on this team. Both Kozel and Angus wrote books detailing this expedition,[24] and a documentary was produced for National Geographic Television.\n\n\nA canal inclined plane was built on the river in 1985 at the Krasnoyarsk Dam.[25]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nNomadic tribes such as the Ket people and the Yugh people have lived along the banks of the Yenisey since ancient times, and this region is the location of the Yeniseian language family. The Ket, numbering about 1000, are the only survivors today of those who originally lived throughout central southern Siberia near the river banks. Their extinct relatives included the Kotts, Assans, Arins, Baikots and Pumpokols who lived further upriver to the south. The modern Ket lived in the eastern middle areas of the river before being assimilated politically into Russia during the 17th through 19th centuries.[26]\n\n\nSome of the earliest known evidence of Turkic origins was found in the Yenisey Valley in the form of stelae, stone monoliths and memorial tablets dating from between the seventh and ninth centuries AD, along with some documents that were found in China's Xinjiang region. The written evidence gathered from these sources tells of battles fought between the Turks and the Chinese and other legends. There are also examples of Uyghur poetry, though most have survived only in Chinese translation.[27]\n\n\nWheat from the Yenisey was sold by Muslims and Uighurs during inadequate harvests to Bukhara and Soghd during the Tahirid era.[28]\n\n\nRussians first reached the upper Yenisey in 1605, travelling from the Ob, up the Ket, portaging and then down the Yenisey as far as the Sym.[29]\n\n\nDuring World War II, Nazi Germany and the Japanese Empire agreed to divide Asia along a line that followed the Yenisey to the border of China and then along the border of China and the Soviet Union.[30]\n\n\n\n## Pollution[edit]\n\n\nStudies have shown that the Yenisey suffers from contamination caused by radioactive discharges from a factory that produced bomb-grade plutonium in the secret city of Krasnoyarsk-26, now known as Zheleznogorsk.[31]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![The bridge over the Yenisey in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, viewed from the left bank.](image)\n\nThe bridge over the Yenisey in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, viewed from the left bank.\n* ![Vinogradovsky Most, the bridge in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, viewed from the left bank.](image)\n\nVinogradovsky Most, the bridge in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, viewed from the left bank.\n* ![The Yenisey (left) and the Ob flow into Kara Sea (south at top in this view).](image)\n\nThe Yenisey (left) and the Ob flow into Kara Sea (south at top in this view).\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Siberia portal\n\n\n* List of rivers of Russia\n* Sayano-Shushenskaya Dam\n* Yenisey Range\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Mongolian: \u0413\u043e\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0433 \u043c\u04e9\u0440\u04e9\u043d, *Gorlog m\u00f6r\u00f6n*, pronounced [\u02c8\u0262\u0254r\u026e\u025c\u0306q \u02c8m\u0275r\u0289\u0306\u014b]; Buryat: \u0413\u043e\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0433 \u043c\u04af\u0440\u044d\u043d, *Gorlog m\u00fcren*; Tuvan: \u0423\u043b\u0443\u0433-\u0425\u0435\u043c, *Ulug-Hem*; Khakas: *\u041a\u0438\u043c \u0441\u0443\u0493*, *Kim su\u011f*\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \u041f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0444\u044c\u0435\u0432, \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 (30 August 1990). *\u0418\u0437\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435\u00a0: \u0441\u0442\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043f\u043e\u044d\u043c\u044b*. \"\u0425\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436. \u043b\u0438\u0442-\u0440\u0430\", \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u0434-\u043d\u0438\u0435.

For thousands of years, the river has been used for water, irrigation, sanitation, transportation, industry, boundary-marking, and war. The prosperous Yangtze Delta generates as much as 20% of China's GDP. The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze is the largest hydro-electric power station in the world that is in use.[10][11] In mid-2014, the Chinese government announced it was building a multi-tier transport network, comprising railways, roads and airports, to create a new economic belt alongside the river.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Yangtze has long been the backbone of China's inland water transportation system, which remained particularly important for almost two thousand years, until the construction of the national railway network during the 20th century. The Grand Canal connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the Jiangnan region south of the river (Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou) and with northern China (all the way from Yangzhou to Beijing). The less well known ancient Lingqu Canal, connecting the upper Xiang River with the headwaters of the Guijiang, allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the Pearl River Delta.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe origin of the Yangtze River has been dated by some geologists to about 45\u00a0million years ago in the Eocene,[47] but this dating has been disputed.

The epithet \u9577 (simplified version \u957f), means \"long\", was first formally applied to the river during the Six Dynasties period.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nVarious sections of the Yangtze have local names. From Yibin to Yichang, the river through Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality is also known as the *Chu\u0101n Ji\u0101ng* (\u5ddd\u6c5f) or \"Sichuan River.\" In Hubei, the river is also called the *J\u012bng Ji\u0101ng* (\u8346\u6c5f; \u834a\u6c5f) or the \"Jing River\" after Jingzhou, one of the Nine Provinces of ancient China. In Anhui, the river takes on the local name *W\u01cen Ji\u0101ng* after the shorthand name for Anhui, *w\u01cen* (\u7696). And *Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0 Ji\u0101ng* (\u63da\u5b50\u6c5f; \u626c\u5b50\u6c5f) or the \"Yangzi River\", from which the English name Yangtze is derived, is the local name for the Lower Yangtze in the region of Yangzhou. The name likely comes from an ancient ferry crossing called *Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0* or *Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0j\u012bn* (\u63da\u5b50 / \u63da\u5b50\u6d25).[19] Europeans who arrived in the Yangtze River Delta region applied this local name to the whole river.[14] The dividing site between upstream and midstream is considered to be at Yichang and that between midstream and downstream at Hukou (Jiujiang).[20]\n\n\n\n### English[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter entering Hubei province, the Yangtze receives water from a number of lakes. The largest of these lakes is Dongting Lake, which is located on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At Wuhan, it receives its biggest tributary, the Han River, bringing water from its northern basin as far as Shaanxi.\n\n\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi province, Lake Poyang, the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through Anhui and Jiangsu, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the East China Sea at Shanghai.\n\n\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to Hukou County, where Lake Poyang meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese tributaries join and the river then runs eastward through Qinghai (Tsinghai), turning southward down a deep valley at the border of Sichuan (Szechwan) and Tibet to reach Yunnan. In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above 5,000\u00a0m (16,000\u00a0ft) to less than 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). Thus, over the first 2,600\u00a0km (1,600\u00a0mi) of its length, the river has fallen more than 5,200\u00a0m (17,000\u00a0ft).[46]\n\n\nIt enters the basin of Sichuan at Yibin. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several mighty tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through Mount Wushan bordering Chongqing and Hubei to create the famous Three Gorges. Eastward of the Three Gorges, Yichang is the first city on the Yangtze Plain.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong took staged swims in the river in 1956 and 1966 at Wuhan in publicity stunts to demonstrate his health, also starting a swimming craze through party propaganda.[74][75]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Welsh adventurer Ash Dykes became the first person to complete the 4,000-mile (6,437\u00a0km) trek along the course of the river, walking for 352 days from its source to its mouth.[76]\n\n\n\n## Hydrology[edit]\n\n\n### Periodic floods[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of deadliest floods\n\nTens of millions of people live in the floodplain of the Yangtze valley, an area that naturally floods every summer and is habitable only because it is protected by river dikes.

In recent years, the river has suffered from industrial pollution, plastic pollution,[13] agricultural runoff, siltation, and loss of wetland and lakes, which exacerbates seasonal flooding. Some sections of the river are now protected as nature reserves.

The Amazon's length was calculated as 6,992\u00a0km (4,345\u00a0mi), taking the Apacheta Creek as its source. Using the same techniques, the length of the Nile was calculated as 6,853\u00a0km (4,258\u00a0mi), which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. The results were reached by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of *Canal do Sul* and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Maraj\u00f3 and finally including the marine waters of the *R\u00edo Par\u00e1* bay in its entire length.[58][20] According to an earlier article on the webpage of the National Geographic, the Amazon's length was calculated as 6,800\u00a0km (4,200\u00a0mi) by a Brazilian scientist. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn June 2007, Guido Gelli, director of science at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), told London's Telegraph Newspaper that it could be considered that the Amazon was the longest river in the world.[64] However, according to the above sources, none of the two results was published, and questions were raised about the researchers' methodology. In 2009, a peer-reviewed article, was published, concluding that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of 7,088\u00a0km (4,404\u00a0mi) for the Nile and 6,575\u00a0km (4,086\u00a0mi) for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, the final length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n\n\n## Watershed[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon basin\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The length of the Amazon River is usually said to be \"at least\" 6,400\u00a0km (4,000\u00a0mi),[2] but reported values lie anywhere between 6,275 and 7,025\u00a0km (3,899 and 4,365\u00a0mi).[3]\nThe length measurements of many rivers are only approximations and differ from each other because there are many factors that determine the calculated river length, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).[3][4]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Amazon River*Rio Amazonas*\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Amazon River\n |\n| ![](image)Amazon River and its drainage basin\n |\n| Native name | *Amazonas*\u00a0(Portuguese) |\n| Location |\n| Country | Peru, Colombia, Brazil |\n| Cities | Iquitos (Peru); Leticia (Colombia); Tabatinga (Brazil); Tef\u00e9 (Brazil); Itacoatiara (Brazil) Parintins (Brazil); \u00d3bidos (Brazil); Santar\u00e9m (Brazil); Almeirim (Brazil); Macap\u00e1 (Brazil);Manaus (Brazil) |\n| Physical\u00a0characteristics |\n|  |\n| Source | Apur\u00edmac River, Mismi Peak |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0location | Arequipa Region, Peru |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0coordinates | 15\u00b031\u203204\u2033S 71\u00b041\u203237\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff15.51778\u00b0S 71.69361\u00b0W\ufeff / -15.51778; -71.69361 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0elevation | 5,220\u00a0m (17,130\u00a0ft) |\n|  |\n| Mouth | Atlantic Ocean |\n| \u2022\u00a0location\n | Brazil |\n| \u2022\u00a0coordinates\n | 0\u00b042\u203228\u2033N 50\u00b05\u203222\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff0.70778\u00b0N 50.08944\u00b0W\ufeff / 0.70778; -50.08944[1] |\n| Length | 6,400\u00a0km (4,000\u00a0mi)[n 1] |\n| Basin size | 7,000,000\u00a0km2 (2,700,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[2]\n6,743,000\u00a0km2 (2,603,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[5] |\n| Width |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. 6,400\u00a0km (4,000\u00a0mi)[2] (6,275 to 7,025\u00a0km (3,899 to 4,365\u00a0mi))[3] \u2013 Amazon, South America\n2. 3,250\u00a0km (2,019\u00a0mi) \u2013 Madeira, Bolivia/Brazil[108]\n3. 3,211\u00a0km (1,995\u00a0mi) \u2013 Pur\u00fas, Peru/Brazil[109]\n4. 2,820\u00a0km (1,752\u00a0mi) \u2013 Japur\u00e1 or Caquet\u00e1, Colombia/Brazil[110]\n5. 2,639\u00a0km (1,640\u00a0mi) \u2013 Tocantins, Brazil[111]\n6. 2,627\u00a0km (1,632\u00a0mi) \u2013 Araguaia, Brazil (tributary of Tocantins)[112]\n7. 2,400\u00a0km (1,500\u00a0mi) \u2013 Juru\u00e1, Peru/Brazil[113]\n8. 2,250\u00a0km (1,400\u00a0mi) \u2013 Rio Negro, Brazil/Venezuela/Colombia[114]\n9. 1,992\u00a0km (1,238\u00a0mi) \u2013 Tapaj\u00f3s, Brazil[115]\n10. 1,979\u00a0km (1,230\u00a0mi) \u2013 Xingu, Brazil[116]\n11. 1,900\u00a0km (1,181\u00a0mi) \u2013 Ucayali River, Peru[117]\n12. 1,749\u00a0km (1,087\u00a0mi) \u2013 Guapor\u00e9, Brazil/Bolivia (tributary of Madeira)[118]\n13. 1,575\u00a0km (979\u00a0mi) \u2013 I\u00e7\u00e1 (Putumayo), Ecuador/Colombia/Peru\n14. 1,415\u00a0km (879\u00a0mi) \u2013 Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, Peru\n15. 1,370\u00a0km (851\u00a0mi) \u2013 Teles Pires, Brazil (tributary of Tapaj\u00f3s)\n16. 1,300\u00a0km (808\u00a0mi) \u2013 Iriri, Brazil (tributary of Xingu)\n17. 1,240\u00a0km (771\u00a0mi) \u2013 Juruena, Brazil (tributary of Tapaj\u00f3s)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2. **^** The Nile is usually said to be the longest river in the world, with a length of about 6,650 km,[17] and the Amazon the second longest river in the world, with a length of at least 6,400 km.[2] In 2007 and 2008, some scientists claimed that the Amazon has a length of 6,992\u00a0km and was longer than the Nile, whose length was calculated as 6,853\u00a0km.[18][19] They achieved this result by adding the waterway from the Amazon's southern outlet through tidal canals and the Par\u00e1 estuary of the Tocantins.[*citation needed*]\nA peer-reviewed article, published in 2009, states a length of 7,088 km for the Nile and 6,575 km for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, as of 2020, the length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are no bridges across the entire width of the river.[63] This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge; for most of its length, engineers could build a bridge across the river easily. For most of its course, the river flows through the Amazon Rainforest, where there are very few roads and cities. Most of the time, the crossing can be done by a ferry. The Manaus Iranduba Bridge linking the cities of Manaus and Iranduba spans the Rio Negro, the second-largest tributary of the Amazon, just before their confluence.\n\n\n\n### Dispute regarding length[edit]\n\n\n![](image)River taxi in Peru\nSee also: Coastline paradox\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile debate as to whether the Amazon or the Nile is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest. However, the Amazon has been reported as being anywhere between 6,275\u00a0km (3,899\u00a0mi) and 6,992\u00a0km (4,345\u00a0mi) long.[3] It is often said to be \"at least\" 6,575\u00a0km (4,086\u00a0mi) long.[2] The Nile is reported to be anywhere from 5,499 to 7,088\u00a0km (3,417 to 4,404\u00a0mi).[3] Often it is said to be \"about\" 6,650\u00a0km (4,130\u00a0mi) long.[17] There are several factors that can affect these measurements, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).[3][4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe main river is navigable for large ocean steamers to Manaus, 1,500\u00a0km (930\u00a0mi) upriver from the mouth. Smaller ocean vessels below 9000 tons and with less than 5.5\u00a0m (18\u00a0ft) draft can reach as far as Iquitos, Peru, 3,600\u00a0km (2,200\u00a0mi) from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach 780\u00a0km (480\u00a0mi) higher, as far as Achual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently ascend to the Pongo de Manseriche, just above Achual Point in Peru.[60]\n\n\nAnnual flooding occurs in late northern latitude winter at high tide when the incoming waters of the Atlantic are funnelled into the Amazon delta. The resulting undular tidal bore is called the *pororoca*, with a leading wave that can be up to 7.6\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft) high and travel up to 800\u00a0km (500\u00a0mi) inland.[76][77]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon River originated as a transcontinental river in the Miocene epoch between 11.8 million and 11.3 million years ago and took its present shape approximately 2.4 million years ago in the Early Pleistocene.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Amazon River has an average discharge of about 215,000\u2013230,000\u00a0m3/s (7,600,000\u20138,100,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s)\u2014approximately 6,591\u20137,570\u00a0km3 (1,581\u20131,816\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) per year, greater than the next seven largest independent rivers combined. Two of the top ten rivers by discharge are tributaries of the Amazon river. The Amazon represents 20% of the global riverine discharge into oceans.[23] The Amazon basin is the largest drainage basin in the world, with an area of approximately 7,000,000\u00a0km2 (2,700,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[2] The portion of the river's drainage basin in Brazil alone is larger than any other river's basin. The Amazon enters Brazil with only one-fifth of the flow it finally discharges into the Atlantic Ocean, yet already has a greater flow at this point than the discharge of any other river.[24][25]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon was initially known by Europeans as the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, and the Peruvian part of the river is still known by that name today. It later became known as Rio Amazonas in Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"How Long Is the Amazon River?\". *Encyclopedia Britannica*.

During glacial periods, sea levels dropped and the great Amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river, which would eventually become the disputed world's longest, draining the most extensive area of rainforest on the planet.[79]\n\n\nParalleling the Amazon River is a large aquifer, dubbed the Hamza River, the discovery of which was made public in August 2011.[80]\n\n\n\n## Protected areas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nObtaining these measurements was difficult given the class IV\u2013V nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower \"Abyss\" sections. Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80\u00a0km farther upstream compared to Mt. Mismi in the Apur\u00edmac drainage, and thus the maximal length of the Amazon river is about 80\u00a0km longer than previously thought. Contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the Amazon river from its newly identified source (finishing November 2012), a journey repeated by two groups after the news spread.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Amazon basin, the largest in the world, covers about 40% of South America, an area of approximately 7,050,000\u00a0km2 (2,720,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It drains from west to east, from Iquitos in Peru, across Brazil to the Atlantic. It gathers its waters from 5 degrees north latitude to 20 degrees south latitude. Its most remote sources are found on the inter-Andean plateau, just a short distance from the Pacific Ocean.[65]\n\n\nThe Amazon River and its tributaries are characterised by extensive forested areas that become flooded every rainy season. Every year, the river rises more than 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft), flooding the surrounding forests, known as *v\u00e1rzea* (\"flooded forests\"). The Amazon's flooded forests are the most extensive example of this habitat type in the world.[66] In an average dry season, 110,000\u00a0km2 (42,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of land are water-covered, while in the wet season, the flooded area of the Amazon basin rises to 350,000\u00a0km2 (140,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0minimum | 700\u00a0m (2,300\u00a0ft) (Upper Amazon); 1.5\u00a0km (0.93\u00a0mi) (Itacoatiara, Lower Amazon)[6] |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0average | 3\u00a0km (1.9\u00a0mi) (Middle Amazon); 5\u00a0km (3.1\u00a0mi) (Lower Amazon)[6][7] |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0maximum | 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi) to 14\u00a0km (8.7\u00a0mi) (Lower Amazon);[6][8] 340\u00a0km (210\u00a0mi) (estuary)[9] |\n| Depth |  |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0average | 15\u00a0m (49\u00a0ft) to 45\u00a0m (148\u00a0ft) (Middle Amazon); 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft) to 50\u00a0m (160\u00a0ft) (Lower Amazon)[6] |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0maximum | 150\u00a0m (490\u00a0ft) (Itacoatiara); 130\u00a0m (430\u00a0ft) (\u00d3bidos)[6][7] |\n|  |\n| Discharge |  |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0location | Atlantic Ocean (near mouth) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0average | 215,000\u00a0m3/s (7,600,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s)\u2013230,000\u00a0m3/s (8,100,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s)[10][11]\n(Basin size: 5,956,000\u00a0km2 (2,300,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[12]\n205,603.262\u00a0m3/s (7,260,810.7\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s)[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Satellite image of the mouth of the Amazon River, from the north looking south\nBel\u00e9m is the major city and port at the mouth of the river at the Atlantic Ocean.

Then distances from Lago Jun\u00edn to several potential source points in the uppermost Mantaro river were measured, which enabled them to determine that the Cordillera Rumi Cruz was the most distant source of water in the Mantaro basin (and therefore in the entire Amazon basin).
