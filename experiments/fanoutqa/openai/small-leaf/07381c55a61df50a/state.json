This has given rise to a superstition known as the \"*Saturday Night Live* Curse\".[24][25]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe list below includes both repertory and featured players past and present, but omits *SNL* writers and others who were not listed as cast members during the show's credits. The dates given are those of the years they were part of the cast. The chart also shows whether the cast member has served as a guest host, appeared as the anchorperson of the \"Weekend Update\" segment (by any of its titles), or has been the subject of their own \"Best of\" home video collection. Many of the cast members were writers as well. \"Middle group\" performers are introduced after the main cast by the announcer saying \"...with\" and reading off these performers before ending with featured players.\n\n\nSid Caesar has the distinction of being the only person who has been named an honorary cast member. Caesar was presented with a plaque during the goodnights of his hosting stint in 1983. \n\n\n\n### Table[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeveral former *SNL* cast members have returned to host the show. The first former cast member to come back and host the show was Chevy Chase in February 1978. While the majority of cast members who also hosted the show were first cast members and then hosted after leaving the show, there have been two cast members who have hosted the show prior to joining the cast: Billy Crystal (he hosted the show twice during the ninth season prior to joining the cast in the tenth season) and Michael McKean (he hosted the show in the tenth season and joined the cast in the nineteenth season). McKean is also the only eventual cast member who first appeared as a musical guest (with Spinal Tap, May 1984).\n\n\nEddie Murphy is the only cast member to have hosted the show while still a cast member. He also holds the distinction of having the longest gap between successive hosting of the show. There was a 35 year and 6 day gap between his second and third hosting of the show.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Chris Elliott | 1994\u20131995 | 1\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Jimmy Fallon | 1998\u20132004 | 6\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |\n| Siobhan Fallon | 1991\u20131992 | 1\n |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |\n| Chris Farley | 1990\u20131995 | 5\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |\n| Will Ferrell | 1995\u20132002 | 7\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |\n| Tina Fey | 2000\u20132006 | 6\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n| Chloe Fineman | 2019\u2013present\n | 5\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Will Forte | 2002\u20132010 | 8\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |\n| Al Franken | 1977\u20131980,1986,1988\u20131995 | 11\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Michael O'Donoghue | 12 | One of the original \"Not Ready for Primetime Players\" and the show's first head writer, he was dropped as a cast member after a few episodes.

The dates given are those of the years they were part of the cast. The chart also shows whether the cast member has served as a guest host, appeared as the anchorperson of the \"Weekend Update\" segment (by any of its titles), or has been the subject of their own \"Best of\" home video collection. Many of the cast members were writers as well. \"Middle group\" performers are introduced after the main cast by the announcer saying \"...with\" and reading off these performers before ending with featured players.\n\n\nSid Caesar has the distinction of being the only person who has been named an honorary cast member. Caesar was presented with a plaque during the goodnights of his hosting stint in 1983. \n\n\n\n### Table[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAdam Sandler and Dan Aykroyd tie the record of the longest gap between leaving the show as a cast member and returning as a host. Both hosted the show for the first time nine days shy of 24 years from last appearance as cast. However, both made appearances on the show during the gap. On the flip side, Bill Murray holds the record for having the shortest gap between leaving the show and returning to host at 287 days after leaving the cast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** For cast members who are still active on the show, the number of seasons assumes that the cast members will continue to serve in that role through the end of the current season\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \u00bd season is used to indicate a portion of a season, not necessarily 50% of the episodes of the partial season\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Strong is listed ahead of McKinnon because Strong appeared in 9 episodes in her partial season, whereas McKinnon appeared in 5 episodes in her partial season\n4. **^** Franken was a cast member in 11 seasons.

The first former cast member to come back and host the show was Chevy Chase in February 1978. While the majority of cast members who also hosted the show were first cast members and then hosted after leaving the show, there have been two cast members who have hosted the show prior to joining the cast: Billy Crystal (he hosted the show twice during the ninth season prior to joining the cast in the tenth season) and Michael McKean (he hosted the show in the tenth season and joined the cast in the nineteenth season). McKean is also the only eventual cast member who first appeared as a musical guest (with Spinal Tap, May 1984).\n\n\nEddie Murphy is the only cast member to have hosted the show while still a cast member. He also holds the distinction of having the longest gap between successive hosting of the show. There was a 35 year and 6 day gap between his second and third hosting of the show.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |\n| Tony Rosato | 1981\u20131982 | 2\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n| Jon Rudnitsky | 2015\u20132016 | 1\n |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Maya Rudolph | 2000\u20132007 | 9\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |\n| Andy Samberg | 2005\u20132012 | 7\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n| Adam Sandler | 1991\u20131995 | 5\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n| Horatio Sanz | 1998\u20132006 | 8\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |\n| Tom Schiller | 1980 | 1\n |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n| Rob Schneider | 1990\u20131994 | 4\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Julia Louis-Dreyfus | 1982\u20131985 | 3\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |\n| Michael Longfellow | 2022\u2013present\n | 2\n |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Jon Lovitz | 1985\u20131990 | 5\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |\n| Norm Macdonald | 1993\u20131998 | 5\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n| Gail Matthius | 1980\u20131981 | 1\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |\n| Michael McKean | 1994\u20131995 | 2\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |\n| Mark McKinney | 1995\u20131997 | 3\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n| Kate McKinnon | 2012\u20132022 | 11\n | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Tim Meadows | 1991\u20132000 | 10\n | ![Green tick](image)Y |  | ![Green tick](image)Y |  |  | ![Green tick](image)Y | ![Green tick](image)Y |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAllegedly \"cursed\" *Saturday Night Live* cast members\n| Cast member\n | Age\n | Date of death\n | Cause of death\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| John Belushi | 33 | March 5, 1982 | Belushi died of a drug overdose from a speedball injection (cocaine and heroin).

He has made more *SNL* appearances than any other cast member besides Kenan Thompson, and impersonated more than 107 celebrities, with Bill Clinton as his most frequent impression.[2] On September 19, 2014, Hammond was announced as the new announcer of *SNL,* replacing Don Pardo, who had died the month before.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHammond was born in Melbourne, Florida, the son of Margaret and Max Hammond.[1] He was severely abused by his mother, contributing to his lifelong struggles with depression and substance abuse.[4] Hammond's father, dealing with his own psychological issues resulting from his military service during World War II, often drank heavily and acted out violently. Hammond found as a child that doing impressions was the only thing he did his mother liked.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe is best known on the show for not only his impersonations of Bill Clinton, but also Al Gore, Donald Trump, John McCain, Regis Philbin, Dick Cheney, Chris Matthews, Phil Donahue, Phil McGraw, Ted Koppel, John Travolta, Jesse Jackson, Geraldo Rivera, Dan Rather, and Sean Connery, in the recurring \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" skits. His impression of Clinton is currently the most frequent *SNL* impression of all time, appearing in 87 sketches over 14 years in the cast and numerous cameos. Hammond also impersonated *SNL* announcer Don Pardo, filling in for Pardo on occasions when the announcer was unavailable.[10]\n\n\nAfter the end of the 34th season, Hammond retired from the show after a record-breaking 14 years as a repertory player. Hammond was the last *SNL* cast member from the 1990s to leave the show. After leaving the show, he has made multiple cameo appearances.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014 Hammond took over the announcer role on *SNL* starting with the 40th-season premiere, replacing Pardo, who had died that August.[3] Since he began as announcer, he has also appeared in skits numerous times reprising his Clinton and Trump impersonations.[11]\n\n\nThe following season Hammond reappeared on the show, doing his impression of Trump just as the real Trump began performing well in the Republican primaries. Hammond moved back to New York in 2016 after Trump won the nomination, expecting to be appearing on a weekly basis during the election. However, *SNL* producer Lorne Michaels decided instead to go with Alec Baldwin's impression, believing that it more effectively captured the contemporary Trump.[5]\n\n\n\n### Other work[edit]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, Hammond gained fame for his impersonations of Elmer Fudd and other Looney Tunes characters in the comedy single \"Wappin'.\" The song was popular enough with *Dr. Demento* listeners to be included on the show's 20th-anniversary compilation.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. ^ ***a*** ***b*** llarchive.com page for *Loveline* episode: \"2000-05-31, Guest - Darrell Hammond.\"[*dead link*]\n23. ^ ***a*** ***b*** mediafire.com page for *Loveline* episode: \"2004-06-07, Guest - Darrell Hammond.\"\n24. **^** llarchive.com page for *Loveline* episode: \"2004-04-18, Guest: Tim Meadows and Tina Fey.\"[*dead link*]\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikiquote has quotations related to ***Darrell Hammond***.\n\n* Darrell Hammond at IMDb\n* Darrell Hammond: 12 years on SNL\n\n\n\n\n| Media offices\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded\u00a0byDon Pardo\n |  ***Saturday Night Live* announcer** 2014\u2013present\n | **Incumbent** |\n\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * FAST\n* ISNI\n* VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * France\n* BnF data\n* Germany\n* United States\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Ex-SNL Star Darrell Hammond on His Shocking Drug Past: 'I Had the Brilliant Idea I Should Try Crack'\". *eonline.com*. 24 October 2011.

When interviewed, he said, \"We all know how lucky we are to have the jobs we have. We're not asking for much. You have to change the rules because people are watching TV in a different way.\"[28] Even so, he mentioned in interviews that he regretted missing much of the presidential election primary season.[29][30]\n\n\nMeyers performed in his final episode of *SNL* February 1, 2014.[22] Strong, Poehler, Bill Hader (in character as Stefon), Andy Samberg, and Fred Armisen (as former New York state governor David Paterson) joined him at the Weekend Update desk. Meyers returned to host the show in 2018, with Paul Simon as the musical guest.[31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMeyers joined the *Saturday Night Live* cast in 2001.[14] In 2005, he was promoted to writing supervisor, and in January 2006, he became co-head writer, sharing the role with Tina Fey and Andrew Steele.[15] In 2004, he auditioned to co-anchor *Weekend Update* with Fey, but lost to Amy Poehler.[16] With Fey's departure, Meyers became head writer for the 2006\u20132007 season and also assumed the role of *Weekend Update* co-anchor with Amy Poehler, though around this time, his cast contract was up. The show wanted him to sign a contract in which he would solely be the head writer, if he didn't get Weekend Update. Meyers refused to sign the contract, and waited to see what the plans for Update were. He considered leaving SNL altogether if he wasn't added to Update.[17][18][19] In fall 2009, Meyers co-anchored two episodes of *Saturday Night Live Weekend Update Thursday* with Poehler.[20] After Poehler's departure, Meyers anchored solo between 2008 and 2013. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Nominated work\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007\n | Writers Guild of America Award for Comedy/Variety (including talk) series | *Saturday Night Live* | Won\n |\n| 2008\n | Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music, or Comedy Series | Nominated\n |\n| 2009\n | Writers Guild of America Award for Comedy/Variety (including talk) series | Won\n |\n| Peabody Award[77] | Won\n |\n| Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music, or Comedy Series | Nominated\n |\n| 2010\n | Writers Guild of America Award for Comedy/Variety (including talk) series | Won\n |\n| Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series | Nominated\n |\n| 2011\n | Writers Guild of America Award for Comedy/Variety (including talk) series | Nominated\n |\n| Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music, or Comedy Series | Nominated\n |\n| Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special | *The Women of SNL* | Nominated\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year | Title | Role | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001 | *Spin City* | Doug | Episode \"Rain on My Charades\"\n |\n| 2001\u201314 | *Saturday Night Live* | Himself / Various | 253 episodes; also head writer\n |\n| 2008\u201312 | *Saturday Night Live Weekend Update Thursday* | Himself | 8 episodes; also head writer\n |\n| 2010 | *2010 ESPY Awards* | Himself (host) | TV special\n |\n| 2011 | *White House Correspondents' Dinner* | Himself (host) | TV special\n |\n| *2011 ESPY Awards* | Himself (host) | TV special\n |\n| 2012\u201316 | *The Mindy Project* | Matt / Himself | 2 episodes\n |\n| 2013 | *70th Golden Globe Awards* | none | TV specialWriter\n |\n| *The Office* | Himself | Episode: \"Finale\"\n |\n| 2013\u201315 | *The Awesomes* | Prock (voice) | Also creator, writer, executive producer\n |\n| 2014 | *71st Golden Globe Awards* | none | TV specialWriter\n |\n| 2014\u2013present | *Late Night with Seth Meyers* | Himself (host) | Also writer\n |\n| 2014 | *66th Primetime Emmy Awards* | Himself (host) | TV special\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** Littleton, Cynthia (April 24, 2014). \"Seth Meyers to Host 2014 Emmy Awards\". *Variety*.
