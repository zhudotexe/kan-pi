You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nThis page provides **lists of best-selling books and book series** to date and in any language. *\"Best-selling\"* refers to the estimated number of copies sold of each book, rather than the number of books printed or currently owned. Comics and textbooks are not included in this list. The books are listed according to the highest sales estimate as reported in reliable, independent sources.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMany books lack comprehensive sales figures as book selling and reselling figures prior to the introduction of point of sale equipment was based on the estimates of book sellers, publishers or the authors themselves. For example, *The Lord of the Rings* as one text was recorded to have sold only 967,466 copies in the UK by 2009, but at the same time the author's estate claimed global sales figures of in excess of 150 million.[8] As such accurate figures are only available from the 1990s and in western nations such as US, UK and Australia. Further, e-books have not been included as out of copyright texts are often available freely in this format. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** Woudhuysen, H. R.; Suarez, Michael F., eds.
