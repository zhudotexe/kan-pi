his first win at the 2022 S√£o Paulo Grand Prix.[15] Three Grands Prix, the 1951 French, the 1956 Argentine and the 1957 British Grand Prix, were won by two drivers sharing a car.[16]\n\n\nThis list includes the winners of the Indianapolis 500 race between 1950 and 1960, as they formed part of the World Championships, even though they were not run by Formula One regulations, nor are they referred to as Grands Prix.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## By driver[edit]\n\n\nAll figures correct as of the *2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix*\n\n\n\nKey\n| \\*\n | Driver has competed in the 2023 season\n |\n| ‚Ä°\n | Formula
