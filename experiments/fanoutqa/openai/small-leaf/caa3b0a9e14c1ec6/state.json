At that time, the survey only counted islands with coastlines of 100 meters or more that were shown on paper maps.\nOn February 28, 2023, the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan announced that the number of islands had been updated to 14,125 through a recount using digital maps. Since there is no international standard for counting islands, only islands with a coastline of 100 meters or more were counted, as in the past. According to the GSI, advances in surveying technology and the detailed representation of topographic features through digital mapping contributed to this announcement.[4][1]\n\n\n\n\n## Japanese archipelago[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japanese archipelago\n\n### Main islands[edit]\n\n\n![The four main islands of Japan run from Hokkaido in the northeast, along the largest island, Honshu, to Kyushu, in the southwest.

It is the tallest mountain in Japan, the second-highest volcano located on an island in Asia (after Mount Kerinci on the island of Sumatra), and seventh-highest peak of an island on Earth.[1] Mount Fuji last erupted from 1707 to 1708.[4][5] The mountain is located about 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) southwest of Tokyo and is visible from the Japanese capital on clear days. Mount Fuji's exceptionally symmetrical cone, which is covered in snow for about five months of the year, is commonly used as a cultural icon of Japan and is frequently depicted in art and photography, as well as visited by sightseers, hikers and mountain climbers.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\n*100 Famous Japanese Mountains*\n |\n| --- |\n| Hokkaid\u014d | * Mt.

They are (clockwise, starting north): Kawaguchiko, Subashiri, Gotemba, and Fujinomiya routes.[74] Climbers usually start at the fifth stations, as these are reachable by car or by bus. The summit is the tenth station on each trail. The stations on different routes are at different elevations; the highest fifth station is located at Fujinomiya, followed by Yoshida, Subashiri, and Gotemba. There are four additional routes from the foot of the mountain: Shojiko, Yoshida, Suyama, and Murayama routes.[75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nThree-thousanders (in Japan)\n |\n| --- |\n| Independent peak | * Mount Fuji\n* Mount Ontake\n |\n| Hida Mountains (Northern Alps) | * Mount Okuhotaka\n* Mount Yari\n* Mount Karasawa\n* Mount Kitahotaka\n* Mount \u014cbami\n* Mount Maehotaka\n* Mount Naka\n* Mount Minami\n* Mount Norikura\n* Mount Tate\n |\n| Akaishi Mountains (Southern Alps) | * Mount Kita\n* Mount Aino\n* Mount Warusawa\n* Mount Akaishi\n* Mount Arakawa\n* Mount N\u014dtori\n* Mount Shiomi\n* Mount Senj\u014d\n* Mount Hijiri\n |\n| * 100 Famous Japanese Mountains\n* List of mountains in Japan\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are eight peaks around the crater at the summit.

Several paragliding schools use the wide sandy/grassy slope between Gotemba and Subashiri parking lots as a training hill.\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Outer shrine of Fujisan Hong\u016b Sengen Taisha\n### Shinto mythology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a national symbol of the country, the mountain has been depicted in various art media such as paintings, woodblock prints (such as Hokusai's *Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji* and *100 Views of Mount Fuji* from the 1830s), poetry, music, theater, film, manga, anime, pottery[78] and even Kawaii subculture.\n\n\nBefore its explosive eruption in 1980, Mount St. Helens was once known as \"The Fuji of America\", for its striking resemblance to Mount Fuji. Mount Taranaki / Mount Egmont in New Zealand is also said to bear a resemblance to Mount Fuji, and for this reason has been used as a stand-in for the mountain in films and television.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mountains and hills of Japan by height\n* *100 Famous Japanese Mountains*\n* List of three-thousanders in Japan\n* List of World Heritage sites in Japan\n* List of elevation extremes by country\n* Mount Araido (\u963f\u983c\u5ea6\u5c71, *Araidosan*), Araido Island (\u963f\u983c\u5ea6\u5cf6), Kuril Islands\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nToday, Mount Fuji is an international destination for tourism and mountain climbing.[27][28] In the early 20th century, populist educator Frederick Starr's Chautauqua lectures about his several ascents of Mount Fuji\u20141913, 1919, and 1923\u2014were widely known in America.[29] A well-known Japanese saying suggests that a wise person will climb Mt. Fuji once in their lifetime, but only a fool would climb it twice.[30][31] It remains a popular symbol in Japanese culture, including making numerous movie appearances,[32] inspiring the Infiniti logo,[33] and even appearing in medicine with the Mount Fuji sign.[34][35]\n\n\nIn September 2004, the staffed weather station at the summit was closed after 72 years in operation. Observers monitored radar sweeps that detected typhoons and heavy rains. The station, which was the highest in Japan at 3,780\u00a0m (12,402\u00a0ft), was replaced by a fully automated meteorological system.[36]\n\n\nMount Fuji was added to the World Heritage List as a Cultural Site on June 22, 2013.[7]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** DeWitt, Lindsey E.

It was not until 1872 that the Japanese government issued an edict (May 4, 1872, Grand Council of State Edict 98) stating, \"Any remaining practices of female exclusion on shrine and temple lands shall be immediately abolished, and mountain climbing for the purpose of worship, etc., shall be permitted.\"[19] However, Tatsu Takayama (also known as Takayama Tatsu), a Japanese woman, became the first woman on record to summit Mount Fuji in the fall of 1832.[20][21][22]\n\n\nAncient samurai used the base of the mountain as a remote training area, near the present-day town of Gotemba. The *sh\u014dgun* Minamoto no Yoritomo held *yabusame* archery contests in the area in the early Kamakura period.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMount Fuji as seen from the air and from the window of a bullet train, 2014\n![](image)Fuji in early summer seen from the International Space Station (May 2001)\nMount Fuji is a very distinctive feature of the geography of Japan. It stands 3,776.24\u00a0m (12,389\u00a0ft) tall and is located near the Pacific coast of central Honshu, just southwest of Tokyo. It straddles the boundary of Shizuoka and Yamanashi prefectures. Four small cities surround it: Gotemba to the east, Fujiyoshida to the north, Fujinomiya to the southwest, and Fuji to the south. It is surrounded by five lakes: Lake Kawaguchi, Lake Yamanaka, Lake Sai, Lake Motosu and Lake Sh\u014dji.[37] They, and nearby Lake Ashi, provide views of the mountain. The mountain is part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. It can be seen more distantly from Yokohama, Tokyo, and sometimes as far as Chiba, Saitama, Tochigi, Ibaraki and Lake Hamana when the sky is clear. It has been photographed from space during a space shuttle mission.[38]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Historical illustration of the routes to Mount Fuji\n![](image)*Torii* near the summit\n![](image)Hikers climbing Mount Fuji\nApproximately 300,000 people climbed Mount Fuji in 2009.[70] The most popular period for people to hike up Mount Fuji is from July to August, while huts and other facilities are operating and the weather is warmest.[70] Buses to the trail heads typically used by climbers start running on July 1.[71] Climbing from October to May is very strongly discouraged, after a number of high-profile deaths and severe cold weather.[72] Most Japanese climb the mountain at night in order to be in a position at or near the summit when the sun rises. The morning light is called \u5fa1\u6765\u5149 *goraik\u014d*, \"arrival of light\".[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Geology |\n| Age of rock | 100,000 years |\n| Mountain type | Stratovolcano |\n| Last eruption | 1707\u201308 |\n| Climbing |\n| First ascent | 663 by En no Odzunu (\u5f79\u884c\u8005, En no gyoja, En no Odzuno) |\n| Easiest route | Hiking |\n| \n |\n| UNESCO World Heritage Site\n |\n| Official\u00a0name | Fujisan, sacred place and source of artistic inspiration |\n| Criteria | Cultural: iii, vi |\n| Reference | 1418 |\n| Inscription | 2013 (37th Session) |\n| Area | 20,702.1 ha |\n| Buffer\u00a0zone | 49,627.7 ha |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n| Mount Fuji |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| ![](image)\"Mt.

During the summer season, most Mount Fuji climbing tour buses arrive there. The next-popular is the Fujinomiya route, which has the highest fifth station, followed by Subashiri and Gotemba. The ascent from the new fifth station can take anywhere between five and seven hours while the descent can take from three to four hours.[74] Even though most climbers do not climb the Subashiri and Gotemba routes, many descend these because of their ash-covered paths. From the seventh station to near the fifth station, one could run down these ash-covered paths in approximately 30\u00a0minutes. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe four routes from the foot of the mountain offer historical sites. The Murayama is the oldest route, and the Yoshida route still has many old shrines, teahouses, and huts along its path. These routes are gaining popularity recently and are being restored, but climbing from the foot of the mountain is still relatively uncommon. Also, bears have been sighted along the Yoshida route.\n\n\nHuts at and above the fifth stations are usually staffed during the climbing season, but huts below fifth stations are not usually staffed for climbers. The number of open huts on routes are proportional to the number of climbers\u2014Yoshida has the most while Gotemba has the fewest. The huts along the Gotemba route also tend to start later and close earlier than those along the Yoshida route. Also, because Mount Fuji is designated as a national park, it is illegal to camp above the fifth station.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. **^** Heckmann, Josef G.; Ganslandt, Oliver (April 2004). \"Images in clinical medicine.

In doing so they would be reborn, \"purified and... able to find happiness.\" The cult waned in the Meiji period and although it persists to this day it has been subsumed into Shint\u014d sects.[77]\n\n\n\n### Buddhism[edit]\n\n\nThe Buddhist Hokkeko believers of Nichiren Shoshu sect piously claim that the Dai Gohonzon mandala grants supernatural protection from the Buddhist deities against possible volcanic eruption of Mount Fuji through the daylight morning ritual of Ushitora Gongyo.\n\n\n\n### Popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther Japanese names which have become obsolete or poetic include *Fuji-no-Yama* (\u3075\u3058\u306e\u5c71, \"the Mountain of Fuji\"), *Fuji-no-Takane* (\u3075\u3058\u306e\u9ad8\u5dba, \"the High Peak of Fuji\"), *Fuy\u014d-h\u014d* (\u8299\u84c9\u5cf0, \"the Lotus Peak\"), and *Fugaku* (\u5bcc\u5cb3\uff0f\u5bcc\u5dbd), created by combining the first character of \u5bcc\u58eb, *Fuji*, and \u5cb3, *mountain*.[16]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Fine Wind, Clear Morning* woodblock print by Hokusai, 19th century\n![](image)Mount Fuji from Omiya, c.\u20091890\nMount Fuji is an attractive volcanic cone and a frequent subject of Japanese art especially after 1600, when Edo (now Tokyo) became the capital and people saw the mountain while traveling on the T\u014dkaid\u014d road. According to the historian H. Byron Earhart, \"in medieval times it eventually came to be seen by Japanese as the \"number one\" mountain of the known world of the three countries of India, China, and Japan\".[17] The mountain is mentioned in Japanese literature throughout the ages and is the subject of many poems.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Geological cross-section of Fuji volcano. Key: N2 = Tertiary sedimentary rocks; \u03b1N2 = Tertiary volcanic rocks; \u03b1Q1 = Komitake volcano; \u03b1-\u03b4Q1 = Ashitaka volcano; \u03b2Q2 = Older Fuji volcano; \u03b1\u03b2Q2 = Younger Fuji volcano.[40]\nMount Fuji is located at a triple junction trench where the Amurian Plate, Okhotsk Plate, and Philippine Sea Plate meet.[41][42] These three plates form the western part of Japan, the eastern part of Japan, and the Izu Peninsula respectively.[43] The Pacific Plate is being subducted beneath these plates, resulting in volcanic activity. Mount Fuji is also located near three island arcs: the Southwestern Japan Arc, the Northeastern Japan Arc, and the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc.[43] The Fuji triple junction is only ~400 kilometers from the Boso Triple Junction.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Aerial panorama of Mount Fuji from Lake Saiko, June 2023\n![](image)Aerial panorama of Mount Fuji with Saiko Iyashi-no-Sato Nenba in the foreground, June 2023\nModern linguist Alexander Vovin proposes an alternative hypothesis based on Old Japanese reading \\*/pu\u207fzi/: the word may have been borrowed from Eastern Old Japanese \\*/pu nusi/ \u706b\u4e3b, meaning \"fire master\".[15]\n\n\n\n### Variations[edit]\n\n\nIn English, the mountain is known as Mount Fuji. Some sources refer to it as \"Fuji-san\", \"Fujiyama\" or, redundantly, \"Mt. Fujiyama\". Japanese speakers refer to the mountain as \"Fuji-san\". This \"san\" is not the honorific suffix used with people's names, such as Watanabe-san, but the Sino-Japanese reading of the character *yama* (\u5c71, \"mountain\") used in Sino-Japanese compounds. In Nihon-shiki and Kunrei-shiki romanization, the name is transliterated as *Huzi*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Heritage Sites in Japan\n |\n| --- |\n| Hokkaido | * Shiretoko\n* J\u014dmon Prehistoric Sites\n | ![Flag of Japan](image)Flag of Japan\n |\n| T\u014dhoku | * Hiraizumi \u2013 Temples, Gardens and Archaeological Sites Representing the Buddhist Pure Land\n* Shirakami-Sanchi\n* Sites of Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution: Iron and Steel, Shipbuilding and Coal Mining\n* J\u014dmon Prehistoric Sites\n |\n| Kant\u014d | * The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier\n* Shrines and Temples of Nikk\u014d\n* Ogasawara Islands\n* Tomioka Silk Mill\n |\n| Ch\u016bbu | * Historic Villages of Shirakawa-g\u014d and Gokayama\n* Fujisan, sacred place and source of artistic inspiration\n* Sites of Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution: Iron and Steel, Shipbuilding and Coal Mining\n |\n| Kansai | * Buddhist Monuments in the H\u014dry\u016b-ji Area\n* Himeji Castle\n* Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto\n* Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara\n* Mozu-Furuichi Kofun Group\n* Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range\n |\n| Ch\u016bgoku | * Hiroshima Peace Memorial (Genbaku Dome)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Shinto mythology, Kuninotokotachi (\u56fd\u4e4b\u5e38\u7acb\u795e?, *Kuninotokotachi-no-Kami*, in *Kojiki*)(\u56fd\u5e38\u7acb\u5c0a?, *Kuninotokotachi-no-Mikoto*, in *Nihon Shoki*) is one of the two gods born from \"something like a reed that arose from the soil\" when the earth was chaotic. According to the *Nihon Shoki*, Konohanasakuya-hime, wife of Ninigi, is the goddess of Mount Fuji, where Fujisan Hong\u016b Sengen Taisha is dedicated for her.\n\n\nIn ancient times the mountain was worshipped from afar. The Asama shrine was set up at the foothills to ward off eruptions. In the Heian period (794\u20131185) volcanic activity subsided and Fuji was used as a base for Shugend\u014d, a syncretic religion combining mountain worship and Buddhism. Worshippers began to climb the slopes and by the early 12th century, Matsudai Shonin had founded a temple on the summit.[76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVolcano in Yamanashi and Shizuoka Prefectures, Japan\n\n\"Fujiyama\" redirects here.

This mountain is one of the 100 famous mountains in Japan. It is the highest mountain in Western Japan and the island of Shikoku.\n\n\n\n\n## Outline[edit]\n\n\nMount Ishizuchi is the highest mountain on the island of Shikoku and also the highest mountain west of Mount Haku. It is known as 'the roof of Shikoku' and the sharp, rocky summit resembles a huge stone hammer (\u77f3\u939a, *ishizuchi*).\n\n\nMount Ishizuchi is an important object of worship in this region and one of the major centers of Shugend\u014d, a sect of mixture of Shinto and Buddhism. At the top of the mountain there is a small shrine called the Ishizuchi Shrine. This mountain is also known as one of Seven Holy Mountains (\u4e03\u970a\u5c71, *nana reizan*). There are several sets of heavy iron chains (\u9396, *kusari*) leading up to the summit and this is the route many pilgrims opt to take, the longest set being 68m. However, it is possible to hike all the way to the peak along a trail which includes stairs and ramps with handrails.\n\n\nThe climbing season opens every year on July 1, and women are forbidden from climbing the mountain on this day.[2] Between mid-October and mid-November, people come from far and wide to view the autumn colours.\n\n\nThe area around Mount Ishizuchi is a major part of Ishizuchi Quasi-National Park.\n\n\n\n## Access[edit]\n\n\n* Sanch\u014dj\u014dju Station of Ishizuchi Ropeway\n* Ishizuchi Tsuchigoya Bus Stop of Iyotetsu Bus\n\n\n* ![Mount Ishizuchi from South](image)\n\nMount Ishizuchi from South\n* ![Top of Mount Ishizuchi](image)\n\nTop of Mount Ishizuchi\n* ![A view of the middle of the mountain](image)\n\nA view of the middle of the mountain\n* ![A stone wall of the mountain](image)\n\nA stone wall of the mountain\n* ![Mt.

It has an elevation of 503\u00a0m (1,650\u00a0ft), but Yonaha-dake triangulation station is located at the next peak of elevation of 498\u00a0m (1,634\u00a0ft).\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\"Mount Yonaha\" in the Japanese language is formed from three kanji, \u4e0e, \u90a3 and \u8987. The kanji are ateji, or kanji used phonetically to represent native or borrowed words.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMount Yonaha is approximately 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) north of the capital of Okinawa Prefecture, Naha,[2] and approximately 4.5\u00a0km (3\u00a0mi) east of the Okuma district (\u5965\u9593\u96c6\u843d, *Okuma sh\u016braku*) of Kunigami. It is formed from schist, phyllite, and sandstone, and dates from the Tertiary period to the mid-Mesozoic era.[3] It appears as a gentle slope, but its summit is surrounded by a series of complex valleys.[1] It is the highest mountain on the island and the second highest in the prefecture after Mount Omoto 525.5\u00a0m (1,724\u00a0ft) in Ishigaki, Okinawa.[3] It is part of the Okinawa Kaigan Quasi-National Park, and the highest mountain in the park. A paved road extends from the village of Kunigami at the mountain's base to its summit.[3]\n\n\nMount Yonaha is home to the largest waterfall on Okinawa Island, the Hiji Waterfall (26\u00a0m (85\u00a0ft)).[2] Due to the effect of the Kuroshio Current, the mountain is almost always covered in fog.[2]\n\n\n\n## Rivers[edit]\n\n\n* Okuma River (\u5965\u9593\u5ddd, *Okuma-gawa*)\n* Hiji River (\u6bd4\u5730\u5ddd, *Hiji-gawa*)\n* Toko River (\u5e8a\u5ddd, *Toko-gawa*)\n\n\n## Yanbaru forest[edit]\n\n\nMount Yonaha is at the center of the Yanbaru forest that spans the villages of Higashi, Kunigami, and \u014cgimi. Yanbaru contains some of the last large surviving tracts of subtropical rainforest in Asia, and the mountain is lush with evergreens forests. While Mount Yonaha is an important natural habitat to numerous species of plants, birds, and animals, its ecology has been negatively affected by agricultural development at its base, and lumbering and the subsequent establishment of second-growth forest.[3]\n\n\n\n## Military installation[edit]\n\n\nMount Yonaha's summit is approximately 2\u00a0km (1\u00a0mi) west of the border of Camp Gonsalves, a jungle warfare training center of the United States Marine Corps.\n\n\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* \u4e0e\u90a3\u8987\u5cb3\u5929\u7136\u4fdd\u8b77\u533a (in Japanese)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Yonaha-dake\". *Nihon Rekishi Chimei Taikei (\u65e5\u672c\u6b74\u53f2\u5730\u540d\u5927\u7cfb \u201cCompendium of Japanese Historical Place Names\u201d)* (in Japanese).
