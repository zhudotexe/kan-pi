To date, it has never rejected a personnel nomination.[18] Since the premier, the head of government in China, is the most important political appointment in the Chinese government, the nomination power, under some circumstances, may give the president real political influence.[19]\n\n\nThe director of the Office of the President of the PRC (Chinese: 中华人民共和国主席办公室; pinyin: *Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó Zhǔxí Bàngōngshì*) is Cai Qi, who is also the director of the CCP General Office and the director of the CCP General Secretary Office.[20]\n\n\n\n## Political ranking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orders of precedence in China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Yew, Chiew Ping; Gang Chen (2010). *China's National People's Congress 2010: Addressing Challenges With No Breakthrough in Legislative Assertiveness* (PDF).

In 1993, Jiang Zemin, who had been general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the Central Military Commission since 1989, assumed the presidency as well, becoming the undisputed top leader of the party and the state.[6][7] Jiang stepped down as president in 2003, handing the post to then–Vice President Hu Jintao, the first vice president to assume the office. Hu had already become general secretary in 2002.

For example, during a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a State Arrival Ceremony held on the South Lawn, a custom begun by John F. Kennedy in 1961.[111] This is followed by a state dinner given by the president which is held in the State Dining Room later in the evening.[112]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **president of the United States** (**POTUS**)[A] is the head of state/head of government of the United States of America. The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.\n\n\nThe power of the presidency has grown substantially[11] since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789.[6] While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly significant role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with notable expansions during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush.[12][13] In modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining superpower.[14][15][16][17] As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30.

Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party inevitably have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The coattail effect, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.\n\n\n\n### Global leader[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUnited States presidential elections\n |\n| --- |\n| Elections by year | * 1788\n* 1792\n* 1796\n* 1800\n* 1804\n* 1808\n* 1812\n* 1816\n* 1820\n* 1824\n* 1828\n* 1832\n* 1836\n* 1840\n* 1844\n* 1848\n* 1852\n* 1856\n* 1860\n* 1864\n* 1868\n* 1872\n* 1876\n* 1880\n* 1884\n* 1888\n* 1892\n* 1896\n* 1900\n* 1904\n* 1908\n* 1912\n* 1916\n* 1920\n* 1924\n* 1928\n* 1932\n* 1936\n* 1940\n* 1944\n* 1948\n* 1952\n* 1956\n* 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* *2024*\n |\n| Elections by state | * Alabama\n* Alaska\n* Arizona\n* Arkansas\n* California\n* Colorado\n* Connecticut\n* Delaware\n* District of Columbia\n* Florida\n* Georgia\n* Hawaii\n* Idaho\n* Illinois\n* Indiana\n* Iowa\n* Kansas\n* Kentucky\n* Louisiana\n* Maine\n* Maryland\n* Massachusetts\n* Michigan\n* Minnesota\n* Mississippi\n* Missouri\n* Montana\n* Nebraska\n* Nevada\n* New Hampshire\n* New Jersey\n* New Mexico\n* New York\n* North Carolina\n* North Dakota\n* Ohio\n* Oklahoma\n* Oregon\n* Pennsylvania\n* Rhode Island\n* South Carolina\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The informal term POTUS originated in the Phillips Code, a shorthand method created in 1879 by Walter P.
