See media help.*\n\nAs head of state, the president represents the United States government to its own people and represents the nation to the rest of the world. For example, during a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a State Arrival Ceremony held on the South Lawn, a custom begun by John F. Kennedy in 1961.[111] This is followed by a state dinner given by the president which is held in the State Dining Room later in the evening.[112]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **president of the United States** (**POTUS**)[A] is the head of state/head of government of the United States of America. The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.\n\n\nThe power of the presidency has grown substantially[11] since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789.[6] While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly significant role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with notable expansions during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush.[12][13] In modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining superpower.[14][15][16][17] As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30.

The position of the United States as the leading member of NATO, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the European Union, have led to the moniker that the president is the \"leader of the free world.\"\n\n\n\n## Selection process[edit]\n\n\n### Eligibility[edit]\n\n\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency.

In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a president's intra-term death or resignation.[B] In all, 45 individuals have served 46 presidencies spanning 58 four-year terms.[C] Joe Biden is the 46th and current president of the United States, having assumed office at noon EST on January 20, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n## History and development[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"How to Address the President; He Is Not Your Excellency or Your Honor, But Mr. President\". *The New York Times*.

Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party inevitably have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The coattail effect, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.\n\n\n\n### Global leader[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUnited States presidential elections\n |\n| --- |\n| Elections by year | * 1788\n* 1792\n* 1796\n* 1800\n* 1804\n* 1808\n* 1812\n* 1816\n* 1820\n* 1824\n* 1828\n* 1832\n* 1836\n* 1840\n* 1844\n* 1848\n* 1852\n* 1856\n* 1860\n* 1864\n* 1868\n* 1872\n* 1876\n* 1880\n* 1884\n* 1888\n* 1892\n* 1896\n* 1900\n* 1904\n* 1908\n* 1912\n* 1916\n* 1920\n* 1924\n* 1928\n* 1932\n* 1936\n* 1940\n* 1944\n* 1948\n* 1952\n* 1956\n* 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* *2024*\n |\n| Elections by state | * Alabama\n* Alaska\n* Arizona\n* Arkansas\n* California\n* Colorado\n* Connecticut\n* Delaware\n* District of Columbia\n* Florida\n* Georgia\n* Hawaii\n* Idaho\n* Illinois\n* Indiana\n* Iowa\n* Kansas\n* Kentucky\n* Louisiana\n* Maine\n* Maryland\n* Massachusetts\n* Michigan\n* Minnesota\n* Mississippi\n* Missouri\n* Montana\n* Nebraska\n* Nevada\n* New Hampshire\n* New Jersey\n* New Mexico\n* New York\n* North Carolina\n* North Dakota\n* Ohio\n* Oklahoma\n* Oregon\n* Pennsylvania\n* Rhode Island\n* South Carolina\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The informal term POTUS originated in the Phillips Code, a shorthand method created in 1879 by Walter P.

An incoming president may make up to 4,000 upon taking office, 1200 of which must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Ambassadors, members of the Cabinet, and various officers, are among the positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation.[79][80]\n\n\nThe power of a president to fire executive officials has long been a contentious political issue. Generally, a president may remove executive officials at will.[81] However, Congress can curtail and constrain a president's authority to fire commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by statute.[82]\n\n\nTo manage the growing federal bureaucracy, presidents have gradually surrounded themselves with many layers of staff, who were eventually organized into the Executive Office of the President of the United States. Within the Executive Office, the president's innermost layer of aides, and their assistants, are located in the White House Office.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n154. **^** \"Succession: Presidential and Vice Presidential Fast Facts\". *CNN*.

The site was selected by George Washington, and the cornerstone was laid in 1792. Every president since John Adams (in 1800) has lived there. At various times in U.S. history, it has been known as the \"President's Palace\", the \"President's House\", and the \"Executive Mansion\". Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901.[164] The federal government pays for state dinners and other official functions, but the president pays for personal, family, and guest dry cleaning and food.[165]\n\n\nCamp David, officially titled Naval Support Facility Thurmont, a mountain-based military camp in Frederick County, Maryland, is the president's country residence. A place of solitude and tranquility, the site has been used extensively to host foreign dignitaries since the 1940s.[166]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Professionalcareer | * Approval rating\n* Assassination attempts and plots\n* Control of Congress\n* Desks\n* Doctrines\n* Executive orders\n* Historical rankings\n* Impeachment efforts\n* International trips\n* Judicial appointments\n* Military service\n\t+ rank\n* Official vehicles\n* Other offices held\n* Pardons\n* Post-presidency campaigns\n* Previous experience\n* Time in office\n* Vetoes\n |\n| Personal life | * Age\n* Ancestry\n* Bibliographies\n\t+ autobiographies\n* Burial places\n* Coats of arms\n* Death\n\t+ in office\n* Education\n* Facial hair\n* Families\n\t+ first ladies\n\t+ children\n* Firsts\n* Freemasons\n* Home state\n* Left-handed\n* Multilingualism\n* Net worth\n* Nicknames\n* Pets\n* Religious affiliation\n* Residences\n* Scouts\n* Slave owners\n* Vacations\n |\n| Depictionsand honors | * Actor portrayals\n\t+ fictional\n* Currency\n* Educational institutions\n* Libraries\n* Memorials\n\t+ in other countries\n* Military vessels\n* Portraits\n* Sculptures\n* U.S. counties\n* U.S. postage stamps\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n76. **^** Steinmetz, Katy (August 10, 2010). \"Congressional Special Sessions\". *Time*.

Upon the nomination of the premier, the NPC convenes to confirm the nomination, but since only one name is on the ballot, it can only approve or reject. To date, it has never rejected a personnel nomination.[18] Since the premier, the head of government in China, is the most important political appointment in the Chinese government, the nomination power, under some circumstances, may give the president real political influence.[19]\n\n\nThe director of the Office of the President of the PRC (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u4e3b\u5e2d\u529e\u516c\u5ba4; pinyin: *Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3 Zh\u01d4x\u00ed B\u00e0ng\u014dngsh\u00ec*) is Cai Qi, who is also the director of the CCP General Office and the director of the CCP General Secretary Office.[20]\n\n\n\n## Political ranking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orders of precedence in China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Yew, Chiew Ping; Gang Chen (2010). *China's National People's Congress 2010: Addressing Challenges With No Breakthrough in Legislative Assertiveness* (PDF).

Liu fell into political disgrace during the Cultural Revolution, after which the presidency became vacant.

The presidency is a part of the system of people's congress based on the principle of unified power in which the National People's Congress (NPC) functions as the only branch of government and as the highest state organ of power. The presidency is a state organ of the NPC and equivalent to, for instance, the State Council and the National Supervisory Commission, rather than a political office, unlike the premier of the State Council. Together with the NPC Standing Committee, the presidency performs certain heads of state functions. The president can engage in state affairs with the consent of the NPC Standing Committee. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn March 11, 2018, the first session of the 13th National People's Congress, by a vote of 2,958 in favor, two opposed and three abstaining, passed a constitutional amendment that removed the previous term limits for the president and the vice president.[9] Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align the presidency with his more powerful posts of general secretary of the party and CMC chairman, which do not have term limits.[10]\n\n\n\n## Selection[edit]\n\n\n### Eligibility[edit]\n\n\nArticle 79 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for being elected for the presidency.

That said, in reality political power was concentrated on Deng Xiaoping, effectively the paramount leader, who controlled the Party, government and the military from \"behind the scenes\" without holding any of the three posts. However, presidents Li Xiannian (1983\u20131988) and Yang Shangkun (1988\u20131993) were not simple figureheads, but actually significant players in the highest leadership. They derived most of their power from being amongst the Eight Elders, rather than the office of president.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![National Emblem of the People's Republic of China](image) Central state organs of the People's Republic of China\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  | National People's Congress |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  | NPC Standing Committee |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | President |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  | State Council |  | Central Military Commission |  | National Supervisory Commission |  | Supreme People's Court |  | Supreme People's Procuratorate |  |  |  |  |\n|\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCCP Chairman Mao Zedong was the first to hold the office of state chairman. He was elected at the founding session of the National People's Congress in 1954. At the 2nd NPC in 1959, Mao was succeeded by Liu Shaoqi, first-ranked Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. Liu was reelected as state chairman at the 3rd NPC in Jan 1965. However, in 1966, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution and by August 1966 Mao and his supporters succeeding in removing Liu from his position as party vice chairman. A few months later Liu was apparently placed under house arrest, and after a prolonged power struggle the 12th Plenum of the 8th Communist Party Congress stripped Liu Shaoqi of all his party and non-party positions on 31 October 1968, including the post of state chairman. This was in violation of the Constitution, which required a vote by the NPC to remove the state chairman.[*citation needed*] After Liu's removal in 1968, the office of state chairman was vacant. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Liu Shaoqi**  \n(27 April 1959 \u2013  \n31 October 1968)\n* ![Dong Biwu (Vice-Chairman acted as the Chairman 31 October 1968 \u2013 24 February 1972; Acted Chairman 24 February 1972 \u2013 17 January 1975)](image)\n\n**Dong Biwu**  \n(*Vice-Chairman acted as the Chairman*  \n31 October 1968 \u2013  \n24 February 1972;  \n*Acted Chairman*  \n24 February 1972 \u2013  \n17 January 1975)\n* ![Song Qingling (Vice-Chairwoman acted as the Chairman 31 October 1968 \u2013 24 February 1972; Honorary Chairwoman 16 May 1981 \u2013 present, died 29 May 1981)](image)\n\n**Song Qingling**  \n(*Vice-Chairwoman acted as the Chairman*  \n31 October 1968 \u2013  \n24 February 1972;  \n*Honorary Chairwoman*  \n16 May 1981 \u2013 present,  \ndied 29 May 1981)\n\n\n### Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress[edit]\n\n\n* ![Zhu De (17 January 1975 \u2013 6 July 1976)](image)\n\n**Zhu De**  \n(17 January 1975 \u2013  \n6 July 1976)\n* ![Song Qingling (Acting Chairman 6 July 1976 \u2013 5 March 1978)](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder the current constitution, instated in 1982 with minor revisions in later years, the president has the power to promulgate laws, select and dismiss the premier (head of government), vice premiers, state councilors as well as ministers of the State Council, grant presidential pardons, declare states of emergency, issue mass mobilization orders, and issue state honors. In addition, the president names and dismisses ambassadors to foreign countries, and signs and annuls treaties with foreign entities. According to the Constitution, all of these powers require the approval or confirmation of the National People's Congress (NPC),[11][*non-primary source needed*] which the office is subject to.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Powers and duties[edit]\n\n\nThe president functions as the state representative of the PRC as well as the supreme representative of China both internally and externally.[14] According to the constitution, the presidency is not a position but a state institution that represents the PRC in state activities, but the presidency is served by one person.[4][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe office of state chairman (the original English translation) was first established under the 1954 Constitution.[2] Though the ceremonial powers of the office were largely identical to those in the current Constitution, the powers of the 1954 office differed from those of the current office in two areas: military and governmental.[2] The state chairman's military powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: \"The Chairman of the People's Republic of China commands the armed forces of the state, and is chairman of the National Defence Council (Chinese: \u56fd\u9632\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a).\"[2] The National Defence Council was unique to the 1954 Constitution, and was mandated as the civil command for the People's Liberation Army. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
