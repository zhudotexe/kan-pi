After studying English literature at University College London, he made several short films before his feature film debut with *Following* (1998). Nolan gained international recognition with his second film, *Memento* (2000), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He transitioned from independent to studio filmmaking with *Insomnia* (2002), and found further critical and commercial success with *The Dark Knight* trilogy (2005–2012), *The Prestige* (2006) and *Inception* (2010); the last of these earned Nolan two Oscar nominations—Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. This was followed by *Interstellar* (2014), *Dunkirk* (2017), *Tenet* (2020) and *Oppenheimer* (2023).
