The manga won the 1975 Shogakukan Manga Award for general manga and the Grand Prize at the 2002 Japan Cartoonists Association Awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Story[edit]\n\n\nGolgo 13 is a professional assassin. His real name, age and birthplace are unknown and there is no consensus in the worldwide intelligence community as to his true identity.[2] Most of his jobs are completed through the use of a customized, scoped M16 rifle. His most frequently used alias is Duke Togo (デューク・東郷, *Dyūku Tōgō*), but he also goes by Tadashi Togo (東郷 隆, *Tōgō Tadashi*) and Togo Rodriguez (トーゴ・ロドリゲス, *Tōgo Rodorigesu*).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** \"大西祥平による映画秘宝連載の評伝「小池一夫伝説」発売\" (in Japanese).

However, Golgo 13's age has not increased significantly to account for these events. He has also suffered multiple injuries throughout the series, leaving many different scars on his body.[6]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nEarly on, Takao Saito developed a system where he created the page layout based on a script written by the editorial department. He also inked the main characters' faces, while assistants provided the backgrounds and other elements. He did extensive research to provide accuracy, especially when the plot dealt with technology.[7] Kazuo Koike was one of the writers on the series in the beginning.[8][9] Author Yoichi Funado wrote approximately 30 stories for *Golgo 13*, three of which he later novelized.[10] Takashi Nagasaki was Saito's editor on the series in the mid-1980s, and later wrote two stories for the manga under the pen name \"Keishi Edogawa\".[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Golgo 13* by Takao Saito\n |\n| --- |\n| Manga | * List of *Golgo 13* chapters\n |\n| Live-action films | * *Golgo 13* (1973)\n* *Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon* (1977)\n |\n| Anime | * *Golgo 13: The Professional* (1983)\n* *Golgo 13: Queen Bee* (1998)\n* List of *Golgo 13* episodes\n |\n| Video games | * *Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode* (1988)\n* *The Mafat Conspiracy* (1990)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Golgo 13* won the 21st Shogakukan Manga Award in the General category in 1975, the Grand Prize at the 2002 Japan Cartoonists Association Awards, and the Special Judges Award at the 50th Shogakukan Manga Awards in 2005.[48][49] With the publication of volume 201 in July 2021, *Golgo 13* was certified as holding the *Guinness World Record* for \"Most volumes published for a single manga series.\"[50] On TV Asahi's Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, *Golgo 13* ranked 36th.[51] *Golgo 13* is one of the works credited with popularizing the *gekiga* movement in Japanese comics, which strives for more realistic and dramatic works. Saito himself is surprised by his series' popularity overseas, because it is firmly rooted in Japanese culture and samurai. He cited the timing of when Golgo actually takes his shot as an example; \"It evokes *iaidō* [the martial art of drawing one's sword and mimicking a deadly blow]. It is the same movement and the same shape. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Other media[edit]\n\n\nIn addition, the title character has appeared in a number of TV commercials in Japan, including NEC[41] and Lotte Black Black.[42] There was also a radio drama featuring Masane Tsukayama as Golgo 13.\n\n\nAn Airsoft gun has been made by Tokyo Marui based on the rifle Golgo 13 uses.[43] A figure based on Golgo 13 was released on August 25, 2009.[44][45]\n\n\nIn November 2023, it was reported that the 1971 anime adaptation of *Golgo 13*, allegedly lost for many years, was found and will be broadcast on TV for the first time in over 50 years. It is set to broadcast on BS-TBS, under the title *Golgo 13 Selection*, on December 10–17, 2023; only a few episodes have been recovered.[46][47]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** Mateo, Alex (June 24, 2020). \"Golgo 13 Manga Resumes on July 10\". *Anime News Network*.

He CAN make those shots—and he can do it with one shot.\"[55]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Loo, Egan (September 10, 2011). \"Davis Film Gets Golgo 13 Assassin Manga's Film Rights\". *Anime News Network*.

It has been serialized in Shogakukan's *shōnen* manga magazine *Weekly Shōnen Sunday* since January 1994, with its chapters collected in 104 *tankōbon* volumes as of October 2023.

Chavez and IGN's A. E. Sparrow for its stories—telling the mysteries and how they were unfolded by the investigations of Conan and gang. Sparrow called the style of the series a mix of Scooby-Doo and Sherlock Holmes, while Chavez believed the manga had appeal to readers of all ages.[219][220] Melissa Sternenberg from *THEM Anime Reviews* gave the series 5 out of 5 stars, she praised its animation and plot, and described it as \"what puts *Detective Conan* as my all-time favorite anime is the superb writing. I soak up *Detective Conan* like a good book, I get so drawn into every episode that everything around me just sinks away and it is just me and the episode. It is engrossing. I can not think of another word for it. Like I said, every episode is fresh, and every mystery that is solved is profound.

Teach is based on and named after the historical pirate Edward \"Blackbeard\" Teach.[3] Apart from the history of piracy, Oda's biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series *Dragon Ball*, which is one of his favorite manga.[4] He was also inspired by *The Wizard of Oz*, claiming not to endure stories where the reward of adventure is the adventure itself, opting for a story where travel is important, but even more important is the goal.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** \"Viz Media Delights Fans with Announcement of Accelerated Publishing Schedule for Hit Pirate Manga Series One Piece\".

For instance, \"*saaa*\" (the sound of light rain, close to a mist) and \"*zaaa*\" (the sound of pouring rain) are both translated as \"fshhhhhhh\".[12] Unlike other manga artists, Oda draws everything that moves himself to create a consistent look while leaving his staff to draw the backgrounds based on sketches he has drawn.[13] This workload forces him to keep tight production rates, starting from five in the morning until two in the morning the next day, with short breaks only for meals. Oda's work program includes the first three days of the week dedicated to the writing of the storyboard and the remaining time for the definitive inking of the boards and for the possible coloring.[14] When a reader asked who Nami was in love with, Oda replied that there would hardly be any love affairs within Luffy's crew. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn June 15, 2015, it was announced that Eiichiro Oda and *One Piece* had set the Guinness World Record for \"The most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\" with 320,866,000 copies printed worldwide by December 2014;[215] it updated the record on August 4, 2022, when it reached over 500 million copies in circulation worldwide in both print and digital copies (416,566,000 in Japan and 100 million copies in 60 countries and territories outside of Japan).[129] The series ranked fourth on the first annual Tsutaya Comic Awards' All-Time Best Section in 2017.[216] In 2021, TV Asahi announced the results of its \"Manga General Election\" poll in which 150,000 people voted for their \"Most Favorite Manga\", *One Piece* ranked first on the list.[217][218]\n\n\nIn 2014, the \"*One Piece* Premiere Summer\" event received the \"Best Overall Production\" award from the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions.[219]\n\n\n\n### Cultural impact[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** One Piece/ねじまき島の冒険 (in Japanese).

Nakano said that *Weekly Shonen Jump* is \"a game of weekly popularity\", and before *One Piece*, he aimed for something \"interesting this week without thinking about the next\"; however, the series reached overwhelming popularity due to its style that involves a story concept and detailed hints, adding that the series had a huge impact on other series. Nakano lauded Oda for his \"overwhelming passion, talent and power\" and his \"unwavering will\" to deliver a story to boys and girls, adding that he goes far beyond the reader's expectations, with the belief in \"don't fool the reader\" and \"there is something interesting ahead of it\".[179]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nThe brand made more than $1 billion in retail sales in Japan by 2004.[180][181]\n\n\n\n### Awards and accolades[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe also notes that the influence of Akira Toriyama (*Dragon Ball*) shines through in Oda's style of writing with its \"huge epic battles punctuated by a lot of humor\" and that, in *One Piece*, he \"manages to share a rich tale without getting bogged down by overly complicated plots\".[169] Rebecca Silverman of the same site stated that one of the series' strengths is to \"blend action, humor, and heavy fare together\" and praised the art, but stated that the panels could get too crowded for easy reading.[170] The website *activeAnime* describes the artwork in *One Piece* as \"wonderfully quirky and full of expression\".[171] Mario Vuk from *Splash Comics* commented that Oda's \"pleasantly bright and dynamic\" art style suits the story's \"funny and exciting\" atmosphere.[172] Isaiah Colbert of *Kotaku* called *One Piece* a \"masterpiece\", highlighting Oda's character writing, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs part of an effort to help Kumamoto Prefecture recover from the 2016 earthquakes, Oda helped set up 10 statues of the Straw Hat Pirates around the prefecture.

The initial manga, written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in *Weekly Shōnen Jump* from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters collected into 42 *tankōbon* volumes by its publisher Shueisha. *Dragon Ball* was originally inspired by the classical 16th-century Chinese novel *Journey to the West*, combined with elements of Hong Kong martial arts films. *Dragon Ball* characters also use a variety of East Asian martial arts styles, including karate[1][2][3] and Wing Chun (kung fu).[2][3][4] The series follows the adventures of protagonist Son Goku from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts. He spends his childhood far from civilization until he meets a teen girl named Bulma, who encourages him to join her quest in exploring the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe narrative of *Dragon Ball* predominantly follows the adventures of the Saiyan Son Goku; upon meeting Bulma at the beginning of the series, the two embark on an adventure to gather the seven Dragon Balls, a set of orbs that summon the wish-granting dragon Shenlong.[ch. 1] Goku later receives martial arts training from Kame-Sen'nin, meets his lifelong friend Kuririn, and enters the *Tenkaichi Budōkai* (天下一武道会, lit. \"Strongest Under the Heavens Martial Arts Tournament\") to fight the world's strongest warriors. When Piccolo Daimao, and later his offspring Piccolo, tries to conquer the planet, Goku receives training from Earth's deities to defeat them. Goku later sacrifices his life to save the planet from his estranged brother Raditz,[ch. 205] but is revived after training in the afterlife under the tutelage of the North Kaio to combat the other incoming Saiyans, Nappa and Vegeta. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAkira Toriyama was a fan of Hong Kong martial arts films, particularly Bruce Lee films such as *Enter the Dragon* (1973) and Jackie Chan films such as *Drunken Master* (1978), and wanted to create a manga inspired by martial arts films.[12][13][14] This led to Toriyama creating the 1983 one-shot manga *Dragon Boy*, which he later redeveloped into *Dragon Ball*.[15] Toriyama loosely modeled the plot and characters of *Dragon Ball* on the classic Chinese novel *Journey to the West*,[16][15] with Goku being Sun Wukong (\"Son Goku\" in Japanese), Bulma as Tang Sanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie, and Yamcha being Sha Wujing.[17] Toriyama wanted to create a story with the basic theme of *Journey to the West*, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n200. **^** Ocasio, Joseph (February 7, 2020). \"Dragon Ball: 5 Reasons We Love Great Saiyaman (& 5 Why We Hate Him)\". *Comic Book Resources*.

Akira Toriyama is credited as the original creator, as well for \"original story & character design concepts.\"[98] It is also being adapted into a parallel manga.[99]\n\n\n\n### *Super Dragon Ball Heroes*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Super Dragon Ball Heroes (anime)\n\nFurther information: List of Super Dragon Ball Heroes episodes and Dragon Ball Heroes\n\nIn 2018, an anime to promote the *Super Dragon Ball Heroes* card and video game series was announced with a July 1 premiere.[100] The series' announcement included a brief synopsis:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the early chapters of the manga, Toriyama's editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, commented that Goku looked rather plain. To combat this, he added several characters like Kame-Sen'nin and Kuririn, and created the *Tenkaichi Budōkai* martial arts tournament to focus the storyline on fighting. It was when the first *Tenkaichi Budōkai* began that *Dragon Ball* truly became popular, having recalled the races and tournaments in *Dr. Slump*.[17] Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory. This allowed for more character growth as the manga progressed. He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline was inspired by the video game *Spartan X* (called *Kung-Fu Master* in the West), in which enemies appear very fast as the player ascends a tower (the game was in turn inspired by Jackie Chan's *Wheels on Meals* and Bruce Lee's *Game of Death*). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGoing against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of *Dragon Ball*'s most powerful characters with small statures, including the protagonist, Goku.[32] Toriyama later explained that he had Goku grow up as a means to make drawing fight scenes easier, even though his first editor Kazuhiko Torishima was initially against it because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically.[33] When including fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid difficulties in drawing residents and destroyed buildings.[25] Toriyama said that he did not plan the details of the story, resulting in strange occurrences and discrepancies later in the series, including changing the colors of the characters mid-story and few characters having screentone because he found it difficult to use.[20][18][23][34] Since the completion of *Dragon Ball*, Toriyama has continued to add to its story, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n205. **^** Peters, Megan (May 23, 2019). \"Dragon Ball Z Makes Clever Appearance in the Marvel Universe\". *ComicBook.com*.

While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy.\", \"The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through.

Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humor of the story. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential manga series ever made, with many manga artists citing *Dragon Ball* as a source of inspiration for their own now-popular works. The anime, particularly *Dragon Ball Z*, is also highly popular around the world and is considered one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe originally thought it would last about a year or end once the Dragon Balls were collected.[23] Toriyama stated that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand, he specifically aimed *Dragon Ball* at readers older than those of his previous serial *Dr. Slump*.[24] He also wanted to break from the Western influences common in *Dr. Slump*, deliberately going for Chinese scenery, referencing Chinese buildings and photographs of China his wife had bought.[25] Toriyama wanted to set *Dragon Ball* in a fictional world largely based on Asia, taking inspiration from several Asian cultures including Japanese, Chinese, South Asian, Central Asian, Arabic and Indonesian cultures.[26] The island where the *Tenkaichi Budōkai* is held is modeled after Bali (in Indonesia), which he, his wife and assistant visited in mid-1985, and for the area around Bobbidi's spaceship he consulted photos of Africa.[25] Toriyama was also inspired by the jinn (genies) from *The Arabian Nights*.[27]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Dragon Ball* is also immensely popular in other regions of the world, such as Latin America, where public screenings of the *Dragon Ball Super* finale in 2018 filled public spaces and stadiums in cities across the region, including stadiums holding tens of thousands of spectators.[119] *Dragon Ball* creator Akira Toriyama was decorated a *Chevalier* or \"Knight\" of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government in May 2019 for his contributions to the arts, particularly for *Dragon Ball* which has been credited with popularizing manga in France.[195][196]\n\n\nVegeta's quote \"It's Over 9000!\" from the Saiyan Saga in the English dub of *Dragon Ball Z* is a popular Internet meme.[197] Goku has been identified as a superhero,[198][199] as well as Gohan with his Great Saiyaman persona.[200] Motorola's Freescale DragonBall and DragonBall EZ/VZ microcontroller processors, released in 1995, are named after *Dragon Ball* and *Dragon Ball Z*, respectively.[201]\n\n\n\n### Comics and animation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt has had a considerable impact on global popular culture, referenced by and inspiring numerous artists, athletes, celebrities, filmmakers, musicians, and writers around the world.\n\n\n\n\n## Setting[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Dragon Ball characters\n\nEarth, known as the Dragon World (ドラゴンワールド) and designated as \"Planet 4032-877\" by the celestial hierarchy, is the main setting for the entire Dragon Ball series, as well as related media such as *Dr. Slump*, *Neko Majin*, and *Jaco the Galactic Patrolman*.
