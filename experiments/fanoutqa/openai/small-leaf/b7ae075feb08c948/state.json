The Pirate Ganzack!* was produced by Production I.G for the 1998 Jump Super Anime Tour and was directed by Gor\u014d Taniguchi.[54] Luffy, Nami, and Zoro are attacked by a sea monster that destroys their boat and separates them. Luffy is found on an island beach, where he saves a little girl, Medaka, from two pirates. All the villagers, including Medaka's father have been abducted by Ganzack and his crew and forced into labor. After hearing that Ganzack also stole all the food, Luffy and Zoro rush out to retrieve it. As they fight the pirates, one of them kidnaps Medaka. A fight starts between Luffy and Ganzack, ending with Luffy's capture. Meanwhile, Zoro is forced to give up after a threat is made to kill all the villagers. They rise up against Ganzack, and while the islanders and pirates fight, Nami unlocks the three captives. Ganzack defeats the rebellion and reveals his armored battleship. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Romito, Joseph (2013). \"One Piece\".

Teach is based on and named after the historical pirate Edward \"Blackbeard\" Teach.[3] Apart from the history of piracy, Oda's biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series *Dragon Ball*, which is one of his favorite manga.[4] He was also inspired by *The Wizard of Oz*, claiming not to endure stories where the reward of adventure is the adventure itself, opting for a story where travel is important, but even more important is the goal.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** \"Viz Media Delights Fans with Announcement of Accelerated Publishing Schedule for Hit Pirate Manga Series One Piece\".

For instance, \"*saaa*\" (the sound of light rain, close to a mist) and \"*zaaa*\" (the sound of pouring rain) are both translated as \"fshhhhhhh\".[12] Unlike other manga artists, Oda draws everything that moves himself to create a consistent look while leaving his staff to draw the backgrounds based on sketches he has drawn.[13] This workload forces him to keep tight production rates, starting from five in the morning until two in the morning the next day, with short breaks only for meals. Oda's work program includes the first three days of the week dedicated to the writing of the storyboard and the remaining time for the definitive inking of the boards and for the possible coloring.[14] When a reader asked who Nami was in love with, Oda replied that there would hardly be any love affairs within Luffy's crew. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn June 15, 2015, it was announced that Eiichiro Oda and *One Piece* had set the Guinness World Record for \"The most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\" with 320,866,000 copies printed worldwide by December 2014;[215] it updated the record on August 4, 2022, when it reached over 500 million copies in circulation worldwide in both print and digital copies (416,566,000 in Japan and 100 million copies in 60 countries and territories outside of Japan).[129] The series ranked fourth on the first annual Tsutaya Comic Awards' All-Time Best Section in 2017.[216] In 2021, TV Asahi announced the results of its \"Manga General Election\" poll in which 150,000 people voted for their \"Most Favorite Manga\", *One Piece* ranked first on the list.[217][218]\n\n\nIn 2014, the \"*One Piece* Premiere Summer\" event received the \"Best Overall Production\" award from the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions.[219]\n\n\n\n### Cultural impact[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** One Piece/\u306d\u3058\u307e\u304d\u5cf6\u306e\u5192\u967a (in Japanese).

The series received the award for the forty-fourth volume in 2008[207] and the forty-eighth volume in 2009.[208] *One Piece* won the *AnimeLand*'s Anime & Manga 19th Grand Prix for the \"Best Classic Sh\u014dnen\" category in 2012.[209][210]\n\n\nIn a poll conducted by Oricon in 2008 about \"the most moving (touching) manga ever\", *One Piece* ranked first in both male and female categories.[211] In another 2008 poll by Oricon, Japanese teenagers voted it the most interesting manga.[212] On Tencent's anime and manga web portal, *One Piece* ranked first in a poll of \"must-read manga for the younger generation in China\".[213] In a poll conducted by eBookJapan in 2014 about \"manga that children want to read\" for \"Children's Reading Day\" by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the series also ranked first.[214]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, he found it would take longer than he had expected as Oda realized that he liked the story too much to end it in that period of time.[16] In 2016, nineteen years after the start of serialization, the author said that the manga has reached 65% of the story he intends to tell.[17] In July 2018, on the occasion of the twenty-first anniversary of *One Piece*, Oda said that the manga has reached 80% of the plot,[18] while in January 2019, he said that *One Piece* is on its way to the conclusion, but that it could exceed the 100th volume.[19] In August 2019, Oda said that, according to his predictions, the manga will end between 2024 and 2025.[20] However, Oda stated that the ending would be what he had decided in the beginning; he is committed to seeing it through.[21] In a television special aired in Japan, Oda said he would be willing to change the ending if the fans were to be able to predict it.[5] In August 2020, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the release of the hundredth volume, *Weekly Shonen Jump*'s editor-in-chief, Hiroyuki Nakano, explained how *One Piece* changed the history of manga and the way of making it. Nakano said that *Weekly Shonen Jump* is \"a game of weekly popularity\", and before *One Piece*, he aimed for something \"interesting this week without thinking about the next\"; however, the series reached overwhelming popularity due to its style that involves a story concept and detailed hints, adding that the series had a huge impact on other series. Nakano lauded Oda for his \"overwhelming passion, talent and power\" and his \"unwavering will\" to deliver a story to boys and girls, adding that he goes far beyond the reader's expectations, with the belief in \"don't fool the reader\" and \"there is something interesting ahead of it\".[179]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nThe brand made more than $1 billion in retail sales in Japan by 2004.[180][181]\n\n\n\n### Awards and accolades[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe also notes that the influence of Akira Toriyama (*Dragon Ball*) shines through in Oda's style of writing with its \"huge epic battles punctuated by a lot of humor\" and that, in *One Piece*, he \"manages to share a rich tale without getting bogged down by overly complicated plots\".[169] Rebecca Silverman of the same site stated that one of the series' strengths is to \"blend action, humor, and heavy fare together\" and praised the art, but stated that the panels could get too crowded for easy reading.[170] The website *activeAnime* describes the artwork in *One Piece* as \"wonderfully quirky and full of expression\".[171] Mario Vuk from *Splash Comics* commented that Oda's \"pleasantly bright and dynamic\" art style suits the story's \"funny and exciting\" atmosphere.[172] Isaiah Colbert of *Kotaku* called *One Piece* a \"masterpiece\", highlighting Oda's character writing, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs part of an effort to help Kumamoto Prefecture recover from the 2016 earthquakes, Oda helped set up 10 statues of the Straw Hat Pirates around the prefecture.

Although his Asian appearance suggests that he may be of Japanese origin, many of Golgo 13's stories have presented different speculations about his true identity while presenting contradictory information, leaving the audience uncertain which information is true. It is known that he may be the biological father of many different children all over the world from the many sexual encounters he has had with women throughout the series, such as a four-year-old son named Joey from ex-Provisional Irish Republican Army fighter Catherine McCall.[4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Golgo 13 |\n| ![](image)Cover of the first *tank\u014dbon* volume, featuring Duke Togo\n |\n| \u30b4\u30eb\u30b413(*Gorugo S\u0101t\u012bn*) |\n| Genre | Thriller[1] |\n| Manga |\n| Written\u00a0by | * Takao Saito (1968\u20132021)\n* Saito Production (2021\u2013present)\n |\n| Published\u00a0by | * Shogakukan\n* Leed Publishing\n |\n| English publisher | * NA: Viz Media\n |\n| Magazine | *Big Comic* |\n| Demographic | *Seinen* |\n| Original run | October 1968 \u2013 present |\n| Volumes | 209 (List of volumes) |\n| Anime television series |\n| Produced\u00a0by | * Yutaka Saito\n* Haruyuki Kawajima\n |\n| Written\u00a0by | Wada Yoshinori |\n| Music\u00a0by | Takeo Yamashita |\n| Studio | Saito Production |\n| Original network | TBS |\n| Original run |  April 1971  \u2013  July 1971 |\n| Anime television series |\n| Directed\u00a0by | Shunji \u014cga |\n| Produced\u00a0by | * Susumu Matsuyama\n* Shunji Aoki\n |\n| Written\u00a0by | Junichi Iioka |\n| Music\u00a0by | Daisuke Ikeda |\n| Studio | The Answer Studio |\n| Licensed\u00a0by | * AUS: Siren Visual\n* NA: Sentai Filmworks\n |\n| Original network | TV Tokyo |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"The Official Website for Golgo 13\".

He has also suffered multiple injuries throughout the series, leaving many different scars on his body.[6]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nEarly on, Takao Saito developed a system where he created the page layout based on a script written by the editorial department. He also inked the main characters' faces, while assistants provided the backgrounds and other elements. He did extensive research to provide accuracy, especially when the plot dealt with technology.[7] Kazuo Koike was one of the writers on the series in the beginning.[8][9] Author Yoichi Funado wrote approximately 30 stories for *Golgo 13*, three of which he later novelized.[10] Takashi Nagasaki was Saito's editor on the series in the mid-1980s, and later wrote two stories for the manga under the pen name \"Keishi Edogawa\".[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Golgo 13* by Takao Saito\n |\n| --- |\n| Manga | * List of *Golgo 13* chapters\n |\n| Live-action films | * *Golgo 13* (1973)\n* *Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon* (1977)\n |\n| Anime | * *Golgo 13: The Professional* (1983)\n* *Golgo 13: Queen Bee* (1998)\n* List of *Golgo 13* episodes\n |\n| Video games | * *Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode* (1988)\n* *The Mafat Conspiracy* (1990)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Golgo 13* won the 21st Shogakukan Manga Award in the General category in 1975, the Grand Prize at the 2002 Japan Cartoonists Association Awards, and the Special Judges Award at the 50th Shogakukan Manga Awards in 2005.[48][49] With the publication of volume 201 in July 2021, *Golgo 13* was certified as holding the *Guinness World Record* for \"Most volumes published for a single manga series.\"[50] On TV Asahi's Manga S\u014dsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, *Golgo 13* ranked 36th.[51] *Golgo 13* is one of the works credited with popularizing the *gekiga* movement in Japanese comics, which strives for more realistic and dramatic works. Saito himself is surprised by his series' popularity overseas, because it is firmly rooted in Japanese culture and samurai. He cited the timing of when Golgo actually takes his shot as an example; \"It evokes *iaid\u014d* [the martial art of drawing one's sword and mimicking a deadly blow]. It is the same movement and the same shape. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Other media[edit]\n\n\nIn addition, the title character has appeared in a number of TV commercials in Japan, including NEC[41] and Lotte Black Black.[42] There was also a radio drama featuring Masane Tsukayama as Golgo 13.\n\n\nAn Airsoft gun has been made by Tokyo Marui based on the rifle Golgo 13 uses.[43] A figure based on Golgo 13 was released on August 25, 2009.[44][45]\n\n\nIn November 2023, it was reported that the 1971 anime adaptation of *Golgo 13*, allegedly lost for many years, was found and will be broadcast on TV for the first time in over 50 years.

Thompson lists one from 1986 because of complaints from the Iranian embassy in Japan, another from 1988 about money laundering in the Vatican, and one from 1989 about a Hollywood actor blackmailed when someone discovers he has AIDS.[12]\n\n\nIn 2013, Saito stated that because he often worried about his manga being cancelled, he had an ending planned out that even included the panel layout. He said he had no idea when *Golgo 13* would end, claiming \"The manga has continued so long that it is no longer the property of the author; it belongs to the readers.\"[13] Two years later, *Big Comic*'s fourth issue of 2015 announced that the series was \"heading towards its conclusion.\"[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1989 and 1990, Leed and Vic Tokai published two further *Golgo 13* comic books, \"The Impossible Hit\" and \"The Border Hopper\", as part of the promotion for two *Golgo 13* video games.[12] The comics were released to the US public via a mail-in offer with the purchase of the games and were later even found packaged with the video games. Each issue contained one complete story and had nothing to do with the storylines of the video games themselves.\n\n\nIn 1991, Leed Publishing and Viz Media published *The Professional: Golgo 13*, a three-part mini-series.[12] *The Professional* was a re-printing of \"The Argentine Tiger\", a story where Golgo is hired by the British Government to assassinate the reportedly dead ex-president of Argentina Juan Per\u00f3n.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA *Golgo 13* anime television series was produced by The Answer Studio and aired on TV Tokyo and other stations from April 11, 2008, to March 27, 2009, for 50 episodes.[32] Hiroshi Tachi provides the voice of Golgo 13. The series was licensed by Sentai Filmworks, with the first DVD released on July 13, 2010.[33] In English, Golgo is voiced by David Wald.\n\n\nThe anime aired in North America on the Anime Network on Demand channel.[34] It is also aired on television in the Philippines by TV5 and in South Korea by Animax Korea.[35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. **^** \u30b4\u30eb\u30b413 \u82f1\u8a9e\u7248 (in Japanese).

In an attempt to murder the young detective, they force-fed him a dangerous experimental drug. However, instead of killing him, it shrinks his body into the size of an elementary school child.[3] Adopting the pseudonym Conan Edogawa and keeping his true identity a secret, Kudo lives with his childhood friend Rachel Moore (Ran Mori) and her father Richard (Kogoro Mori), who is a private detective.

The initial manga, written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters collected into 42 *tank\u014dbon* volumes by its publisher Shueisha. *Dragon Ball* was originally inspired by the classical 16th-century Chinese novel *Journey to the West*, combined with elements of Hong Kong martial arts films. *Dragon Ball* characters also use a variety of East Asian martial arts styles, including karate[1][2][3] and Wing Chun (kung fu).[2][3][4] The series follows the adventures of protagonist Son Goku from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts. He spends his childhood far from civilization until he meets a teen girl named Bulma, who encourages him to join her quest in exploring the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe narrative of *Dragon Ball* predominantly follows the adventures of the Saiyan Son Goku; upon meeting Bulma at the beginning of the series, the two embark on an adventure to gather the seven Dragon Balls, a set of orbs that summon the wish-granting dragon Shenlong.[ch.\u00a01] Goku later receives martial arts training from Kame-Sen'nin, meets his lifelong friend Kuririn, and enters the *Tenkaichi Bud\u014dkai* (\u5929\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b66\u9053\u4f1a, lit. \"Strongest Under the Heavens Martial Arts Tournament\") to fight the world's strongest warriors. When Piccolo Daimao, and later his offspring Piccolo, tries to conquer the planet, Goku receives training from Earth's deities to defeat them. Goku later sacrifices his life to save the planet from his estranged brother Raditz,[ch.\u00a0205] but is revived after training in the afterlife under the tutelage of the North Kaio to combat the other incoming Saiyans, Nappa and Vegeta. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAkira Toriyama was a fan of Hong Kong martial arts films, particularly Bruce Lee films such as *Enter the Dragon* (1973) and Jackie Chan films such as *Drunken Master* (1978), and wanted to create a manga inspired by martial arts films.[12][13][14] This led to Toriyama creating the 1983 one-shot manga *Dragon Boy*, which he later redeveloped into *Dragon Ball*.[15] Toriyama loosely modeled the plot and characters of *Dragon Ball* on the classic Chinese novel *Journey to the West*,[16][15] with Goku being Sun Wukong (\"Son Goku\" in Japanese), Bulma as Tang Sanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie, and Yamcha being Sha Wujing.[17] Toriyama wanted to create a story with the basic theme of *Journey to the West*, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n200. **^** Ocasio, Joseph (February 7, 2020). \"Dragon Ball: 5 Reasons We Love Great Saiyaman (& 5 Why We Hate Him)\". *Comic Book Resources*.

To combat this, he added several characters like Kame-Sen'nin and Kuririn, and created the *Tenkaichi Bud\u014dkai* martial arts tournament to focus the storyline on fighting. It was when the first *Tenkaichi Bud\u014dkai* began that *Dragon Ball* truly became popular, having recalled the races and tournaments in *Dr. Slump*.[17] Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory. This allowed for more character growth as the manga progressed. He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline was inspired by the video game *Spartan X* (called *Kung-Fu Master* in the West), in which enemies appear very fast as the player ascends a tower (the game was in turn inspired by Jackie Chan's *Wheels on Meals* and Bruce Lee's *Game of Death*). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGoing against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of *Dragon Ball*'s most powerful characters with small statures, including the protagonist, Goku.[32] Toriyama later explained that he had Goku grow up as a means to make drawing fight scenes easier, even though his first editor Kazuhiko Torishima was initially against it because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically.[33] When including fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid difficulties in drawing residents and destroyed buildings.[25] Toriyama said that he did not plan the details of the story, resulting in strange occurrences and discrepancies later in the series, including changing the colors of the characters mid-story and few characters having screentone because he found it difficult to use.[20][18][23][34] Since the completion of *Dragon Ball*, Toriyama has continued to add to its story, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n205. **^** Peters, Megan (May 23, 2019). \"Dragon Ball Z Makes Clever Appearance in the Marvel Universe\". *ComicBook.com*.
