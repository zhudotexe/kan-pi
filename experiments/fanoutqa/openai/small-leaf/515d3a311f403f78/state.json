Elections and removals are decided by majority vote.[11][*non-primary source needed*] The length of the president's term of office is the same as the NPC, which is 5 years.[11] Since 2018, the president is required to recite the constitutional oath of office before assuming office.[13]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArticle 84 of the Constitution of China. If the office of president falls vacant, then the vice president succeeds to the office. If both offices fall vacant, then the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee temporarily acts as president until the NPC can elect a new president and vice president.[25]\n\n\n\n## List of state representatives[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of state representatives of the People's Republic of China.\n\n### Timeline[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n### Chairmen[edit]\n\n\n* ![Mao Zedong (27 September 1954 \u2013 27 April 1959; Chairman of the Central People's Government 1 October 1949 \u2013 27 September 1954)](image)\n\n**Mao Zedong**  \n(27 September 1954 \u2013  \n27 April 1959;  \n*Chairman of the Central People's Government*  \n1 October 1949 \u2013  \n27 September 1954)\n* ![Liu Shaoqi (27 April 1959 \u2013 31 October 1968)](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on**Orders of succession** |\n| Presidencies |\n| * Argentina\n* Austria\n* Brazil\n* Colombia\n* China\n* DR Congo\n* Finland\n* France\n* Germany\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Ireland\n* Republic of Korea\n* Mexico\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Poland\n* Romania\n* Sri Lanka\n* Taiwan\n* United States\n* Uruguay\n* Vietnam\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n## Post title[edit]\n\n\nThe title of the office (Chinese: \u56fd\u5bb6\u4e3b\u5e2d; pinyin: *Gu\u00f3ji\u0101 Zh\u01d4x\u00ed*), which literally translates to \"state chairman\", was unchanged in the Chinese text, but a new English translation of \"President of the People's Republic of China\" has been adopted since 1982, instead of \"Chairman of the People's Republic of China\".[16]\n\n\n\n## Order of succession[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of Chinese leaders\n* List of leaders of the People's Republic of China\n* Orders of precedence in China\n* Air transports of heads of state and government\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In Chinese, the president of the PRC is termed *zh\u01d4x\u00ed*, while the presidents of other countries are termed *z\u01d2ngt\u01d2ng*.

To serve as president, one must:\n\n\n\n* be a Chinese citizen;\n* have the right to vote and stand for election;\n* be at least 45 years old.[11][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n### Election[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1990s, the experiment of separating party and state posts, which led to conflict between Deng Xiaoping and Zhao Ziyang during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, was terminated. In 1993, Jiang Zemin, who had been general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the Central Military Commission since 1989, assumed the presidency as well, becoming the undisputed top leader of the party and the state.[6][7] Jiang stepped down as president in 2003, handing the post to then\u2013Vice President Hu Jintao, the first vice president to assume the office. Hu had already become general secretary in 2002. In turn, Hu vacated both offices for Xi Jinping in 2012 and 2013, who had also previously served as vice president under Hu.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **president of the People's Republic of China**, commonly called the **president of China**, is the state representative of the People's Republic of China. The presidency is a part of the system of people's congress based on the principle of unified power in which the National People's Congress (NPC) functions as the only branch of government and as the highest state organ of power. The presidency is a state organ of the NPC and equivalent to, for instance, the State Council and the National Supervisory Commission, rather than a political office, unlike the premier of the State Council. Together with the NPC Standing Committee, the presidency performs certain heads of state functions. The president can engage in state affairs with the consent of the NPC Standing Committee. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 1981052929 May 1981\n | 32,26388 years, 122 days\n |\n| Presidency abolished\n |\n| 3\n | Xiannian, LiLi Xiannian | 1909062323 June 1909(23 June 1909) | 73 36073 years, 360 days\n | 04 2954 years, 295 days\n | 78 29078 years, 290 days\n | 1992062121 June 1992\n | 30,31482 years, 364 days\n |\n| 4\n | Shangkun, YangYang Shangkun | 190708033 August 1907(3 August 1907) | 80 25080 years, 250 days\n | 04 3524 years, 352 days\n | 85 23685 years, 236 days\n | 1998091414 September 1998\n | 33,28091 years, 42 days\n |\n| 5\n | Zemin, JiangJiang Zemin | 1926081717 August 1926(17 August 1926) | 66 22266 years, 222 days\n | 09 3539 years, 353 days\n | 76 21076 years, 210 days\n | 2022113030 November 2022\n | 35,16996 years, 105 days\n |\n| 6\n | Jintao, HuHu Jintao | 1942122121 December 1942(21 December 1942) | 60 08460 years, 84 days\n | 09 3649 years, 365 days\n | 70 08470 years, 84 days\n | Living\n | 29,76081\u00a0years, 175\u00a0days (Living)\n |\n| 7\n | Jinping, XiXi Jinping | 1953061515 June 1953(15 June 1953) | 59 years, 272 days\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn theory, the president has discretion over the selection of the premier, though in practice the premier has historically been selected through the top-level discussions of the Chinese Communist Party. Upon the nomination of the premier, the NPC convenes to confirm the nomination, but since only one name is on the ballot, it can only approve or reject. To date, it has never rejected a personnel nomination.[18] Since the premier, the head of government in China, is the most important political appointment in the Chinese government, the nomination power, under some circumstances, may give the president real political influence.[19]\n\n\nThe director of the Office of the President of the PRC (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u4e3b\u5e2d\u529e\u516c\u5ba4; pinyin: *Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3 Zh\u01d4x\u00ed B\u00e0ng\u014dngsh\u00ec*) is Cai Qi, who is also the director of the CCP General Office and the director of the CCP General Secretary Office.[20]\n\n\n\n## Political ranking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orders of precedence in China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** Buckley, Chris; Wu, Adam (10 March 2018). \"Ending Term Limits for China's Xi Is a Big Deal.

Liu fell into political disgrace during the Cultural Revolution, after which the presidency became vacant. The post of chairman was abolished under the Constitution of 1975, and the function of state representative was bestowed on the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee.

That said, in reality political power was concentrated on Deng Xiaoping, effectively the paramount leader, who controlled the Party, government and the military from \"behind the scenes\" without holding any of the three posts. However, presidents Li Xiannian (1983\u20131988) and Yang Shangkun (1988\u20131993) were not simple figureheads, but actually significant players in the highest leadership. They derived most of their power from being amongst the Eight Elders, rather than the office of president.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen it was agreed to amend the constitution again in 1980, questions to whether to restore the presidency arose.

Jiang has been criticized for being too concerned about his personal image at home, and too conciliatory towards Russia and the United States abroad.[2] Served as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (1989\u20132002), Chairman of the Central Military Commission (1989\u20132004), Communist Party secretary of Shanghai (1987\u20131989). |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | **Hu Jintao**\u80e1\u9526\u6d9b(1942\u2013 )Tibet At-large (until 2008)Zhejiang At-large (from 2008) | 15 March 2003\n | 15 March 2008\n | X | Zeng Qinghong | Himself\n |\n| 15 March 2008\n | 14 March 2013\n | XI | Xi Jinping |\n| During his term in office, Hu reintroduced state control in some sectors of the economy that were relaxed by the previous administration, and has been conservative with political reforms.[3] Along with his colleague, Premier Wen Jiabao, Hu presided over nearly a decade of consistent economic growth and development that cemented China as a major world power. He sought to improve socio-economic equality domestically through the Scientific Development Concept, which aimed to build a \"Socialist Harmonious Society\" that was prosperous and free of social conflict.[4] In foreign policy, Hu advocated for \"China's peaceful development\", pursuing soft power in international relations and a business-oriented approach to diplomacy. Through Hu's tenure, China's influence in Africa, Latin America, and other developing countries has increased.[5] Served as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (2002\u20132012), Chairman of the Central Military Commission (2004\u20132012), Vice President (1998\u20132003) and Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission (1999\u20132004). |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | **Xi Jinping**\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73(1953\u2013 )Shanghai At-large (until 2018)Inner Mongolia At-large (2018\u20132023)Jiangsu At-large (from 2023) | 14 March 2013\n | 17 March 2018\n | XII | Li Yuanchao | Himself\n |\n| 17 March 2018\n | 10 March 2023\n | XIII | Wang Qishan |\n| 10 March 2023\n | *Incumbent* | XIV | Han Zheng |\n| The fifth President under the 4th Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

In these positions, Yang oversaw much of the day-to-day running of government and Party affairs, both political and military, amassing a great deal of bureaucratic power by controlling things like the flow of documents, the keeping of records, and the approval and allocation of funds.[2] Purged, arrested and imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, he spent 12 years in prison but staged a comeback in 1978, becoming a key ally of Deng, serving as Mayor of Guangzhou (1979\u201381), and returning to the CMC as Secretary\u2013General and also Vice Chairman (1981\u201389), before assuming the presidency.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Yang in 1940\n![](image)Yang (right) with Nikolai Bulganin\n**Yang Shangkun** (3 August 1907[1] \u2013 14 September 1998) was a Chinese Communist military and political leader, president of the People's Republic of China from 1988 to 1993, and one of the Eight Elders that dominated the party after the death of Mao Zedong.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **In office**21 December 1964\u00a0\u2013 13 January 1975 |\n| Constituency | PLA At-large |\n| **In office**25 March 1988\u00a0\u2013 15 March 1993 |\n| Constituency | Sichuan At-large |\n| 7th Mayor of Guangzhou |\n| **In office**March 1979\u00a0\u2013 September 1981 |\n| Preceded by | Jiao Linyi |\n| Succeeded by | Liang Lingguang |\n|  |\n| Personal details |\n| Born | (1907-08-03)3 August 1907Tongnan, Chongqing, Sichuan, Qing Empire |\n| Died | 14 September 1998(1998-09-14) (aged\u00a091)Beijing, People's Republic of China |\n| Nationality | Chinese |\n| Political party | Chinese Communist Party (joined in 1926) |\n| Spouse | \nLi Bozhao\n\n\u200b\n \u200b\n(m.\u00a01929; died\u00a01985)\u200b\n |\n| Relations | Yang Baibing |\n| Children | 3 |\n| Alma mater | Shanghai University, Moscow Sun Yat-sen University |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n| Yang Shangkun |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Simplified Chinese | \u6768\u5c1a\u6606 |\n| Traditional\u00a0Chinese | \u694a\u5c1a\u6606 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Y\u00e1ng Sh\u00e0ngk\u016bn |\n| Yue: Cantonese |\n| Jyutping | Joeng4 Soeng6-kwan1 |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Yang (first row, fifth from right) at Kim Il Sung's 80th birthday celebrations in 1992\nThroughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Yang Shangkun was hugely influential within the People's Liberation Army. Yang and his younger half-brother, Yang Baibing, purged China's military of any officers who had not sufficiently supported the government's violent crackdown on students. Yang then began an organized attempt to fill as many senior military positions as possible with his supporters, generating an attitude of resentment among other military elders, who accused Yang of attempting to dominate the army and possibly challenge Deng's authority by developing a \"Yang family clique\". When Yang resisted the rise of Jiang Zemin (who had been the Party secretary of Shanghai), whom Deng began to groom to succeed him as paramount leader, party elders, including Deng himself forced Yang to retire in 1993, along with some of his family.[7]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Buhe\n* T\u00f6m\u00fcr Dawamat\n* Gan Ku\n* Li Peiyao (murdered 1996)\n* Wu Jieping\n |\n| 9th(1998\u20132003)  | * Tian Jiyun\n* Xie Fei\n* Jiang Chunyun\n* Zou Jiahua\n* Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai\n* Wang Guangying\n* Cheng Siyuan\n* Buhe\n* T\u00f6m\u00fcr Dawamat\n* Wu Jieping\n* Peng Peiyun\n* He Luli\n* Zhou Guangzhao\n* ~~Cheng Kejie~~ (dismissed & executed 2000)\n* Cao Zhi\n* Ding Shisun\n* Cheng Siwei\n* Xu Jialu\n* Jiang Zhenghua\n |\n| 10th(2003\u20132008)  | * Wang Zhaoguo\n* Li Tieying\n* Ismail Amat\n* He Luli\n* Ding Shisun\n* Cheng Siwei\n* Xu Jialu\n* Jiang Zhenghua\n* Gu Xiulian\n* Raidi\n* Sheng Huaren\n* Lu Yongxiang\n* Uyunqimg\n* Han Qide\n* Fu Tieshan\n |\n| 11th(2008\u20132013)  | * Wang Zhaoguo\n* Lu Yongxiang\n* Uyunqimg\n* Han Qide\n* Hua Jianmin\n* Chen Zhili\n* Zhou Tienong\n* Li Jianguo (secretary-general)\n* Ismail Tiliwaldi\n* Jiang Shusheng\n* Chen Changzhi\n* Yan Junqi\n* Sang Guowei\n |\n| 12th(2013\u20132018)  | * Li Jianguo\n* Wang Shengjun\n* Chen Changzhi\n* Yan Junqi\n* Wang Chen (secretary-general)\n* Shen Yueyue\n* Ji Bingxuan\n* Zhang Ping\n* Qiangba Puncog\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Yang Shangkun (added 1980; secretary-general)\n* Choekyi Gyaltsen, Panchen Erdeni (added 1980)\n* Zhu Xuefan (added 1981)\n |\n| 6th(1983\u20131988)  | * Chen Pixian\n* Wei Guoqing\n* Geng Biao\n* Hu Juewen\n* Xu Deheng\n* Peng Chong\n* Wang Renzhong\n* Shi Liang\n* Zhu Xuefan\n* Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme\n* Choekyi Gyaltsen, Panchen Erdeni\n* Saifuddin Azizi\n* Zhou Gucheng\n* Yan Jici\n* Hu Yuzhi\n* Rong Yiren\n* Ye Fei\n* Liao Hansheng\n* Han Xianchu\n* Huang Hua\n* Chu Tu'nan (added 1986)\n |\n| 7th(1988\u20131993)  | * Xi Zhongxun\n* Ulanhu\n* Peng Chong (secretary-general)\n* Wei Guoqing\n* Zhu Xuefan\n* Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme\n* Choekyi Gyaltsen, Panchen Erdeni\n* Saifuddin Azizi\n* Zhou Gucheng\n* Yan Jici\n* Rong Yiren\n* Ye Fei\n* Liao Hansheng\n* Ni Zhifu\n* Chen Muhua\n* Fei Xiaotong\n* Sun Qimeng\n* Lei Jieqiong\n* Wang Hanbin\n |\n| 8th(1993\u20131998)  | * Tian Jiyun\n* Wang Hanbin\n* Ni Zhifu\n* Chen Muhua\n* Fei Xiaotong\n* Sun Qimeng\n* Lei Jieqiong\n* Qin Jiwei\n* Li Ximing\n* Wang Bingqian\n* Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai\n* Wang Guangying\n* Cheng Siyuan\n* Lu Jiaxi\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the founding of the PRC in October 1949 and until the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Yang Shangkun was one of very few CCP leaders who worked closely with Mao Zedong at Zhongnanhai on a daily basis. As the Director of the General Office and Secretary\u2013General of the CMC, he oversaw much of the actual day-to-day work of most party activities and military affairs.[3] On the eve of the Cultural Revolution Yang was identified as a supporter of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, and was purged as a counter-revolutionary.[7] After being ejected from the Communist Party and removed from all positions, Yang was persecuted by Red Guards, who accused Yang of planting a covert listening device to spy on Mao, the same accusation shared by Deng Xiaoping.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"\u65cf\u8c31\u5e2e\u5927\u5fd9\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6768\u5c1a\u6606\u8bde\u8fb0\u65e5\u4e3a8\u67083\u65e5--\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u65b0\u95fb--\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u65b0\u95fb-\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51\".

The resulting book, *Long March: The Untold Story*, has been praised by China scholars as an excellent synthesis of first-hand oral sources. Within China, many Chinese veterans asked why it took a foreigner to produce such a book.[9]\n\n\n\n## Presidency[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne of the earliest supporters of Chinese economic reform, Yang justified it with references to Vladimir Lenin and the New Economic Policy. However, he strongly opposed any form of political reform, and, despite his own suffering during the Cultural Revolution, actively defended the image and record of Mao. Together with his half-brother, General Yang Baibing, Yang Shangkun effectively controlled the PLA for the entire 1980s and into the early 1990s. Despite his initial hesitation, he went on to play a leading role in crushing the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and was actually the one who planned and supervised the operations to clear the square and surrounding streets. Yang's downfall came in 1993, when he failed in his attempts to undermine the new leadership of Jiang Zemin and to retain control of the PLA, and was forced to retire by a coalition of Party elders, including Deng himself.\n\n\n\n\n## Early political and military activities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYang remained in prison until Mao died and Deng Xiaoping rose to power, in 1978. After Deng gained control of the military he recalled Yang, raised him to the position of general, and gave Yang the responsibility of reforming China's army, which Deng considered as larger than necessary and engaged in too many non-military activities. Deng raised Yang to the position of Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission in order to give Yang the authority to complete these reforms (Deng was chairman). In 1982 Yang was also appointed as a full member of the Politburo.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Voice of America, before Yang Shangkun died in 1998, he allegedly told army doctor Jiang Yanyong that the crackdown on 4 June had been the most serious mistake committed by Li Peng and the Communist Party in its history, a mistake that Yang believed he could not correct, but which he believed would eventually be corrected.[10]\n\n\nYang died on 14 September 1998, aged 91. His official obituary described him as \"a great proletarian revolutionary, a statesman, a military strategist, a staunch Marxist, an outstanding leader of the party, the state, and the people's army.\"[7]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1929, he married Li Bozhao, a woman who participated in the Long March alongside Yang. They had three sons.[11]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Politics of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Before 5th Plenum(Sep 1985) | * Wan Li\n* Xi Zhongxun\n* Wang Zhen\n* Wei Guoqing\n* Ulanhu\n* Fang Yi\n* Deng Yingchao\n* Li Desheng\n* Yang Shangkun\n* Yang Dezhi\n* Yu Qiuli\n* Song Renqiong\n* Zhang Tingfa\n* Hu Qiaomu\n* Nie Rongzhen\n* Ni Zhifu\n* Xu Xiangqian\n* Peng Zhen\n* Liao Chengzhi (died June 1983)\n |\n| After 5th Plenum | * Wan Li\n* Xi Zhongxun\n* Fang Yi\n* Tian Jiyun\n* Qiao Shi\n* Li Peng\n* Yang Shangkun\n* Yang Dezhi\n* Wu Xueqian\n* Yu Qiuli\n* Hu Qiaomu\n* Hu Qili\n* Yao Yilin\n* Ni Zhifu\n* Peng Zhen\n |\n\n |\n| Alternate members | 1.

Although according to the 1982 Constitution the role of President was \"largely ceremonial\", it recognized Li's status as a respected Party elder and a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, and Li himself went on to forcefully use his still very substantial influence to support leftist policies. In 1984, Li met with U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the latter's visit to China, notably discussing the status of Taiwan with the President.[10] Li visited the United States in July 1985, the first time the head of state of the People's Republic of China made such a visit.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrandt, Loren; Rawski, Thomas G.

Li stepped down as president in 1988 and was succeeded by Yang Shangkun. Li was then named Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC. He was a strong supporter of Jiang Zemin's rise to power,[*citation needed*] and during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Li was one of the hardline Party elders who pushed for a strong response to the demonstrations and supported Premier Li Peng's desire to use military force to suppress the protests.[5][11][12] Li continued to serve in government until his death in 1992.\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nLi had four children.
