Established in 1861, MIT has played a significant role in the development of many areas of modern technology and science.\n\n\nFounded in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. MIT is one of three private land grant universities in the United States, the others being Cornell University and Tuskegee University. The institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the Charles River, and encompasses a number of major off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates Center, and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMIT has been nominally co-educational since admitting Ellen Swallow Richards in 1870. Richards also became the first female member of MIT's faculty, specializing in sanitary chemistry.[389][390] Female students remained a small minority prior to the completion of the first wing of a women's dormitory, McCormick Hall, in 1963.[391][392][393] Between 1993 and 2009 the proportion of women rose from 34 percent to 45 percent of undergraduates and from 20 percent to 31 percent of graduate students.[184][394] As of 2009[update], women outnumbered men in Biology, Brain & Cognitive Sciences, Architecture, Urban Planning, and Biological Engineering.[184][395]\n\n\n\n### Faculty and staff[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"Statistics\". *www.marshallscholarship.org*.

IBM will spend $240 million over the next decade, and the lab will be staffed by MIT and IBM scientists.[103] In October 2018 MIT announced that it would open a new Schwarzman College of Computing dedicated to the study of artificial intelligence, named after lead donor and The Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman. The focus of the new college is to study not just AI, but interdisciplinary AI education, and how AI can be used in fields as diverse as history and biology. The cost of buildings and new faculty for the new college is expected to be $1 billion upon completion.[104]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n |\n| --- |\n| Academics | * School of\n\t+ Architecture and Planning\n\t+ Engineering\n\t+ Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences\n\t+ Science\n* Sloan School of Management\n* Schwarzman College of Computing\n* Department of\n\t+ Biology\n\t+ Brain and Cognitive Sciences\n\t+ Economics\n\t+ Mathematics\n\t+ Physics\n* Health Sciences and Technology\n |\n| Research | * Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab\n* Broad Institute\n* Center for\n\t+ Bits and Atoms\n\t+ Information Systems Research\n\t+ International Studies\n\t+ Theoretical Physics\n* Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory\n* Institute for Medical Engineering and Science\n* Koch Institute\n* Laboratory for\n\t+ Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems\n\t+ Information and Decision Systems\n* Lincoln Laboratory\n* Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center\n* McGovern Institute\n* Media Lab\n* MIT Libraries\n* Nuclear Research Reactor\n* Picower Institute\n* Plasma Science and Fusion Center\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMIT enrolled 4,602 undergraduates and 6,972 graduate students in 2018–2019.[383] Undergraduate and graduate students came from all 50 US states as well as from 115 foreign countries.[384]\n\n\nMIT received 33,240 applications for admission to the undergraduate Class of 2025: it admitted 1,365 (4.1 percent).[385] In 2019, 29,114 applications were received for graduate and advanced degree programs across all departments; 3,670 were admitted (12.6 percent) and 2,312 enrolled (63 percent).[386]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMIT is a large, highly residential, research university with a majority of enrollments in graduate and professional programs.[178] The university has been accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges since 1929.[179] MIT operates on a 4–1–4 academic calendar with the fall semester beginning after Labor Day and ending in mid-December, a 4-week \"Independent Activities Period\" in the month of January, and the spring semester commencing in early February and ceasing in late May.[180]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n238. **^** Center on Education and the Workforce. \"Ranking 4,500 Colleges by ROI (2022)\".

In 2005, Caltech students pranked MIT's Campus Preview Weekend by distributing t-shirts that read \"MIT\" on the front, and \"...because not everyone can go to Caltech\" on the back.[355][356][357] Additionally, the word Massachusetts in the \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" engraving on the exterior of the Lobby 7 dome was covered with a banner so that it read \"That Other Institute of Technology.\" In 2006, MIT retaliated by posing as contractors and stealing the 1.7-ton, 130-year-old Fleming cannon, a Caltech landmark. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUndergraduate tuition and fees for 2019–2020 was $53,790 for nine months. 59% of students were awarded a need-based MIT scholarship. Graduate tuition and fees for 2019–2020 was also $53,790 for nine months, and summer tuition was $17,800. Financial support for graduate students are provided in large part by individual departments. They include fellowships, traineeships, teaching and research assistantships, and loans.[387] The annual increase in expenses had led to a student tradition (dating back to the 1960s) of tongue-in-cheek \"tuition riots\".[388]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMIT was named a sea-grant college in 1976 to support its programs in oceanography and marine sciences and was named a space-grant college in 1989 to support its aeronautics and astronautics programs.[83][84] Despite diminishing government financial support over the past quarter century, MIT launched several successful development campaigns to significantly expand the campus: new dormitories and athletics buildings on west campus; the Tang Center for Management Education; several buildings in the northeast corner of campus supporting research into biology, brain and cognitive sciences, genomics, biotechnology, and cancer research; and a number of new \"backlot\" buildings on Vassar Street including the Stata Center.[85] Construction on campus in the 2000s included expansions of the Media Lab, the Sloan School's eastern campus, and graduate residences in the northwest.[86][87] In 2006, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMIT's on-campus nuclear reactor[116] is one of the most powerful university-based nuclear reactors in the United States. The prominence of the reactor's containment building in a densely populated area has been controversial,[117] but MIT maintains that it is well-secured.[118] In 1999 Bill Gates donated US$20 million to MIT for the construction of a computer laboratory named the \"William H.

During these \"Boston Tech\" years, MIT faculty and alumni rebuffed Harvard University president (and former MIT faculty) Charles W. Eliot's repeated attempts to merge MIT with Harvard College's Lawrence Scientific School.[37] There would be at least six attempts to absorb MIT into Harvard.[38] In its cramped Back Bay location, MIT could not afford to expand its overcrowded facilities, driving a desperate search for a new campus and funding. Eventually, the MIT Corporation approved a formal agreement to merge with Harvard, over the vehement objections of MIT faculty, students, and alumni.[38] However, a 1917 decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court effectively put an end to the merger scheme.[38]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of October 2023[update], 101 Nobel laureates,[10] 26 Turing Award winners, and 8 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with MIT as alumni, faculty members, or researchers.[11] In addition, 58 National Medal of Science recipients, 29 National Medals of Technology and Innovation recipients, 50 MacArthur Fellows,[12] 83 Marshall Scholars,[13] 41 astronauts,[14] 16 Chief Scientists of the US Air Force, and various heads of states have been affiliated with MIT.

MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing public transportation passes, and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.[127]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMIT alumni founded or co-founded many notable companies, such as Intel, McDonnell Douglas, Texas Instruments, 3Com, Qualcomm, Bose, Raytheon, Apotex, Koch Industries, Rockwell International, Genentech, Dropbox, and Campbell Soup. According to the British newspaper *The Guardian*, \"a survey of living MIT alumni found that they have formed 25,800 companies, employing more than three million people including about a quarter of the workforce of Silicon Valley. Those firms collectively generate global revenues of about $1.9 trillion (£1.2 trillion) a year\".

Please help improve it by revising it to be neutral and encyclopedic. *(February 2021)*\n |\n\n\nHMC employs financial professionals to manage the approximately 12,000 funds that constitute the endowment. The company directly manages about one third of the total endowment portfolio while working closely with the external companies that manage the rest.[*citation needed*] HMC is headed by a professional, who holds the titles of president and chief executive officer of the company.\n\n\nHMC is a 501(c)(3) non-profit entity[5] and so is exempt from federal income taxation.[6]\n\n\n\n### Past management[edit]\n\n\nJack Meyer managed HMC from 1990 to September 30, 2005, beginning with an endowment worth $4.8 billion and ending with a value of $25.9 billion (including new contributions). During the last decade of his tenure, the endowment earned an annualized return of 15.9%.[7] In part after compensation disagreements, a number of HMC managers including Meyer himself left to form their own investment management firms. Bloomberg in 2011 reviewed a group of the resultant firms—Adage Capital Management LP, Charlesbank Capital Partners LLC, Convexity Capital Management LP (Meyer's), Highfields Capital Management LP and Regiment Capital Advisors LLC—which at that time between them managed $43 billion in assets.[8]\n\n\nThe university hired Mohamed El-Erian to succeed Meyer as HMC's next president and CEO. He came from the bond trading company PIMCO and pledged to \"rebuild and reinvent\" the company. He announced his leaving September 12, 2007, to return to PIMCO after guiding the endowment to a one-year return of 23%.[9]\n\n\nJane Mendillo was named the new head of HMC, effective July 1, 2008. She had been Wellesley College’s chief investment officer since 2002. Prior to that, she served as vice president for external management at HMC. A 1984 graduate of Yale University followed by an MBA from Yale School of Management, Mendillo first joined HMC as an equities analyst in 1987. Her tenure was largely shaped by the financial crisis of 2007–2010, with a cash squeeze in University operation and endowment performance, a shrinkage of endowment asset value, and errant interest rate, financial derivatives and leveraged positions, according to a Feb. 2009 news report. Staff of HMC was trimmed 25%, or by about 50 people, in line with shrinkage of about $8 billion (about 22%). A source for the report said that some of the positions in the endowment which had to be liquidated were in hedge funds run by Meyer's Convexity Capital and Seth Klarman's Baupost Group.[10]\n\n\nStephen Blyth became the CEO of HMC on January 1, 2015. Blyth joined the firm in 2006, and previously held roles as Head of Internal Management and Head of Public Markets, responsible for investments in public equity, credit and fixed income markets. An alumnus of Cambridge University and Harvard University, Blyth has also served as a Professor of the Practice of Statistics at Harvard University.[11]\n\n\nMarc Seidner joined HMC as vice president for domestic fixed income in an effort to revamp the company's bond division in 2006. Mr. Seidner was previously the director of active core strategies at Standish Mellon Asset Management.[12] *The Wall Street Journal* reported on June 23, 2009, that Seidner was departing from the organization. On August 14, 2009 PIMCO announced that it had hired Seidner as an executive vice president and portfolio manager to manage a range of fixed-income portfolios.\n\n\n\n### Current management[edit]\n\n\nOn September 30, 2016, N.P. Narvekar was appointed as CEO.[13] In January 2017, Narvekar announced the company would be laying off about half of the 230-employee staff by outsourcing some positions and closing all its internally managed hedge funds by the end of the 2017 fiscal year.[14] In 2019, Narvekar was paid $9.3 million compensation.[15][16]\n\n\n\n### Harken Energy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, Harvard Management Company was linked to George W. Bush's Harken Energy scandal.[17][18] Specifically, Michael R. Eisenson, who would later found private equity firm Charlesbank Capital Partners was the Harvard representative on the Harken Energy board when Harvard made a $30 million investment into the ill-fated oil company venture.[19] At the time, employees were accused of improperly investing their own money into Harken but Harvard deemed those investments appropriate.[20]\n\n\n\n### Investments in Romania[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2015 Harvard University acquired 33,600 hectares (83,000 acres) of Romanian forest land. In 2015 they abruptly sold their entire holding to a subsidiary of Ikea. These holdings have since faced significant legal challenge as many were acquired corruptly during Romania's post-Communist restitution process.[21]\n\n\n\n### Ending investments in fossil fuels[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2021, after years of pressure from student and outside groups, Harvard announced that it will stop investments in fossil fuels.[22] The university's public announcement cited \"the need to decarbonize the economy and our responsibility as fiduciaries\" in explaining its decision.[23] Climate activists on campus had waged a multi-year campaign for full divestment, including bringing lawsuits, storming the field of the 2019 Harvard-Yale football game, organizing on-campus protests, and other strategies.[24]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment\n* List of wealthiest charitable foundations\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Virginia L.
