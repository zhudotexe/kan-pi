And then, then sometimes at the end of the day when I've finished the day what I wrote comes back to me like a strange kind of sea. This is a very good feeling. Sometimes writing comes back like, like a *vague* [French: wave] of... *vague* of happiness. Sometimes, not always![4]\n> \n> \n\n\n### International reactions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Hemon, Aleksandar (15 October 2019). \"Opinion \u2013 'The Bob Dylan of Genocide Apologists'\". *The New York Times*. Retrieved 17 May 2020. Perhaps the esteemed Nobel Committee is so invested in the preservation of Western civilization that to it a page of Mr. Handke is worth a thousand Muslim lives. Or it could be that in the rarefied chambers in Stockholm, Mr. Handke's anxious goalie is far more real than a woman from Srebrenica whose family was eradicated in the massacre. The choice of Mr. Handke implies a concept of literature safe from the infelicities of history and actualities of human life and death. War and genocide, Milosevic and Srebrenica, the value of the writer's words and actions at this moment in history, might be of interest to the unsophisticated plebs once subjected to murder and displacement, but not to those who can appreciate \"linguistic ingenuity\" that \"has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience.\" For them, genocide comes and goes, but literature is forever.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCriticism focuses on the writer's view on the breakup of Yugoslavia and Yugoslav Wars, which has been described as pro-Serbian, his support of the late Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, and Bosnian genocide denial.[5][6][7] The high-profile figures who decried the decision of the Swedish Academy include individuals such as Deborah Lipstadt, Holocaust historian, who in her letter published in *The New York Times* wrote that the Nobel committee has awarded Handke a platform which \"he does not deserve and the public does not need him to have\", adding that such platform could convince some that his \"false claims must have some legitimacy\";[8] Jonathan Littell, who said \"he might be a fantastic artist, but as a human being he is my enemy \u2013 he\u2019s an asshole\";[6][5] Miha Mazzini, who said that \"some artists sold their human souls for ideologies (Hamsun and Nazism), some for hate (C\u00e9line and his rabid antisemitism), \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Committee Members** |\n| Seat No.\n | Picture\n | Name\n | Elected\n | Position\n | Profession\n |\n| 12\n | ![](image) | Per W\u00e4stberg (b. 1933)\n | 1997\n | committee chair\n | novelist, journalist, poet, essayist\n |\n| 11\n | ![](image) | Mats Malm (b. 1964)\n | 2018\n | associate memberpermanent secretary\n | translator, literary historian, editor\n |\n| 14\n | ![](image) | Kristina Lugn (1948\u20132020)\n | 2006\n | member\n | poet, dramatist, writer\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Jesper Svenbro (b. 1944)\n | 2006\n | member\n | poet, classical philologist |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | Anders Olsson (b. 1949)\n | 2008\n | member\n | literary critic, literary historian\n |\n| **External Members** |\n|  | ![](image) | Kristoffer Leandoer[48] (b. 1962)\n | 2019\n | member\n | author, literary critic, translator\n |\n| ![](image) | Gun-Britt Sundstr\u00f6m[48] (b. 1945)\n | member\n | author, literary critic, translator\n |\n| ![](image) | Rebecka K\u00e4rde (b. 1991)\n | member\n | literary critic, translator\n |\n| ![](image) | Mikaela Blomqvist (b. 1987)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMaass also claims that two Nobel prize jurors, Henrik Petersen and Eric Runesson, were adhering to conspiracy theories with regard to American involvement in the Balkan conflict and that they were \"misinformed\" about Handke's literary achievements.[35] Germany's Eugen Ruge also protested against the scale of the criticism. In November 2019, around 120 authors, literary scholars, translators, and artists expressed their unease in an open letter. They felt that the criticism against Handke was no longer rational. The letter stated that the criticism of Handke \"consists almost entirely of hatred, resentment, insinuations, distortions and the like. It has degenerated into anti-Handke propaganda.\"[36][37][38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nand t\u043e the fact that both awards go to Central Europe.[25][26] Award-winning filmmakers Wim Wenders and Emir Kusturica publicly congratulated Handke and traveled to Stockholm for the award ceremony to support him.[27][28] Austrian president Alexander Van der Bellen called Handke's voice \"unfussy and unique \u2026 We have a lot to thank Peter Handke for. I hope he knows that.\"[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n \n> \"Handke's groundbreaking artistry with language emerges when his hyperactive sense for the particular compels investigation of his own medium. In his books we are often on foot, and his 'epic steps' appear with full effect in his story Slow Homecoming 1979. The story being told has almost dissolved in description, but the telling still lives on, guided by the narrators grounded feet and a gaze gifted with linguistic eyes. He has written: *To be receptive is everything*... [He] has said that the classics not only saved him but also preserved him. But he is also a deeply contemporary writer who must confront a paternal heritage perverted by the Nazis' occupation of Austria in the war. He represents a Slovenian maternal lineage, which motivates his anti-nationalistic myth of his origin.\n> \n> \n\n\n### Banquet speech[edit]\n\n\nAt the Nobel Banquet held at the Blue Hall, Stockholm City Hall's main hall, Handke delivered the following short speech:[42] \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Handke's denial of the Bosnian genocide is one of the many grounds for the heavy criticism he receives after receiving the prize.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nsome for money and power (Kusturica) but the one that offended me the most was Handke with his naivety for the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 regime. ... I found him cruel and totally self-absorbed in his naivety\";[6] Hari Kunzru, who said that Handke is \"a troubling choice for a Nobel committee\" and that he is \"a fine writer, who combines great insight with shocking ethical blindness\";[9][6] Salman Rushdie, who also criticized Handke's support for wartime Serbia in 1999;[9][10] and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek,[10][7] Aleksandar Hemon,[11] Bora \u0106osi\u0107,[7] and others.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> \"Peter Handke's work is suffused with a strong spirit of discovery, a desire to write the world fresh. In his debut year, 1966, he attacked the literary world for its short- comings in describing reality, but over fifty years later, with about 80 works behind him \u2013 including films and about a score of plays \u2013 it is evident not only that he has realised his dream of a new prose, but also how his writing has become influential for several generations of writers in post-war Europe... [His] writing is often about returning to origins to remember the dead, but no strict iteration is possible.\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Full professors in relevant academic fields and national-level politicians in any country may propose candidates, and it does not require an invitation to submit a nomination; sometimes nominators make their proposals public, but the committee does not verify nominations.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n\nNominations confirmed by the various News Agencies\n| Nominee | Country | Motivations | Nominator(s) | Source\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Individuals** |\n| Loujain al-Hathloul (b. 1989)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia | \"for her peaceful struggle for the equal rights of women in Saudi Arabia\"\n | 8 members of U.S. House of Representatives | [5][6] |\n| Jacinda Ardern (b. 1980)\n | ![](image)\u00a0New Zealand | \"for her quick response to tackle the situation after the Christchurch terror attack\"\n |  | [7][8] |\n| Julian Assange (b. 1971)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Australia | \"for having exposed the architecture of abuse and war and fortified the architecture of peace despite the risks and sacrifices\"\n | 17 members of the German Parliament | [9][10] |\n| Chelsea Manning (b. 1987)\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States |\n| Edward Snowden (b. 1983)\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States |\n| Leila de Lima (b. 1959)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Philippines | \"for her campaign against extrajudicial killings and stand against dictatorial regimes\"\n | Hakima El Haite (b. 1963)\n | [11] |\n| Maggie Gobran (b. 1949)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Egypt | \"in recognition of her constant commitment and dedication to serving illiterate and poor women throughout Egypt\"\n | Garnett Genuis (b. 1987)\n | [12][13] |\n| Nicol\u00f2 Govoni (b. 1993)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Italy | \"for dedicating his life to the support and protection of children's rights\"\n | Sara Conti (b. 1979)\n | [14][15] |\n| Greta Thunberg (b. 2003)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Sweden | \"[with FFM] for their tireless work to make politicians open their eyes to global climate crisis\"\n | * H\u00e5kan Svenneling (b. 1985)\n* Jens Holm (b. 1971)\n | [16] |\n| **Organizations** |\n| Arctic Council (founded in 1996)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Norway | \"for leading intergovernmental forums for cooperation, coordination and interaction among the countries on common Arctic issues\"\n |  | [17] |\n| Fridays for Future Movement (founded in 2018)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Sweden | \"[with Thunberg] for their tireless work to make politicians open their eyes to global climate crisis\"\n | * H\u00e5kan Svenneling (b. 1985)\n* Jens Holm (b. 1971)\n | [16] |\n| People of Hong Kong | ![](image)\u00a0Hong Kong | \"for the community's fight for freedom of speech and basic democracy\"\n | Guri Melby (b. 1981)\n | [18] |\n| International Space Station (ISS)\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States![](image)\u00a0Russia![](image)\u00a0Japan![](image)\u00a0Europe![](image)\u00a0Canada | \"for space-faring nations' multinational effort to work together in a focused peaceful enterprise to design, launch, assemble, and operate an outpost for humans at the edge of space\"\n | K\u00e5rstein Eidem L\u00f8vaas (b. 1967)\n | [19] |\n| World Health Organization (WHO) (founded in 1948)\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States | \"for its efforts to address the global COVID-19 pandemic\"\n |  | [20] |\n\n\n## Nobel Committee[edit]\n\n\nTasked with reviewing nominations from September of the previous year through 1 February and ultimately selecting the Prize winners,[21] the Norwegian Parliament-appointed members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee at the time of the 2020 prize were listed as:[22]\n\n\n\n* Berit Reiss-Andersen (chair, born 1954), advocate (barrister) and president of the Norwegian Bar Association, former state secretary for the Minister of Justice and the Police (representing the Labour Party).

Among the recurring themes in her collections are about childhood, family life, relationships and death. In addition to classical mythology, the rich English-language poetry tradition is her primary literary source of inspiration. Her language is characterized by clarity and precision and is free of poetic formalities. A United States Poet Laureate, she has garnered numerous literary prizes such as the Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award, and the Bollingen Prize. Among her celebrated poem collections are *The Triumph of Achilles* (1985), *The Wild Iris* (1992), *Averno* (2006), and *Faithful and Virtuous Night* (2014).[3]\n\n\n\n## Reactions[edit]\n\n\nThe Red Poppy\n\n\n> \n> The great thing  \n> \n> is not having  \n> \n> a mind.

She responded saying: \n\n\n\n\n> \"I have no idea. My first thought was 'I won\u2019t have any friends' because most of my friends are writers. But then I thought 'no, that won't happen'. It's too new, you know \u2026 I don't know really what it means. And I don't know whether... I mean it's a great honour, and then of course there are recipients I don't admire, but then I think of the ones that I do, and some very recent. I think, practically, I wanted to buy another house, a house in Vermont \u2013 I have a condo in Cambridge \u2013 and I thought 'well, I can buy a house now'. But mostly I am concerned for the preservation of daily life with people I love.\"[3]\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nFollowing the announcement, Gl\u00fcck found herself in an uncomfortable, \"nightmarish\" situation due to the endless phone calls that \"hadn't stopped ringing since 7:00 am\" and where journalists lining up outside her residence in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[4] Asked by *New York Times* as to how did she feel once she absorbed that her win was real, she said: \n\n\n> \"Completely flabbergasted that they would choose a white American lyric poet. It doesn't make sense. Now my street is covered with journalists. People keep telling me how humble I am. I'm not humble. But I thought, I come from a country that is not thought fondly of now, and I'm white, and we\u2019ve had all the prizes. So it seemed to be extremely unlikely that I would ever have this particular event to deal with in my life.[4]\n> \n> \n\n\n### International reactions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Poster promoting a poetry reading on January 21, 1977, by Louise Gl\u00fcck at the Poetry Center at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.\nThe chair of the Nobel prize committee, Anders Olsson hailed Gl\u00fcck's \"candid and uncompromising\" voice, which is full of humour and biting wit. Her 12 collections of poetry, including her most recent *Faithful and Virtuous Night*, the Pulitzer-winning *The Wild Iris*, and the *Averno*, are characterised by a striving for clarity\", he added, comparing her to Emily Dickinson with \"her severity and unwillingness to accept simple tenets of faith\".[3][5]\n\n\nFellow poet Claudia Rankine told *The Guardian* that she was so pleased that it was conferred to her. \"Something good had to happen!\" Rankine said. \"She is a tremendous poet, a great mentor, and a wonderful friend. I couldn't be happier. We are in a bleak moment in this country, and as we poets continue to imagine our way forward, Louise has spent a lifetime showing us how to make language both mean something and hold everything.\"[3][5] *Deccan Herald* described her \"an underwhelming choice for the Nobel Prize\" because of the confronting reality that there were other writers who deserved it more. Furthermore, they expressed: \"Though Gl\u00fcck is a much-admired poet, she is not very well-known.\"[6]\n\n\nJonathan Galassi, president of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, told *Reuters* he was certain the Nobel prize would bring Gluck \"to many, many new reader.\" He described her as \"one of the rare contemporary poets whose work has the gift of speaking directly to readers through her great and subtle art.\"[7] Yale president Peter Salovey congratulated, saying: \"Yale celebrates a poet of the interior life, whose unsparing explorations of the self and its place in the world in volume after volume have created poems of beauty and revelation. We also honor a galvanizing teacher who has given herself unstintingly to students, who revere her.\"[8]\n\n\n\n## Award ceremony[edit]\n\n\n### Nobel lecture[edit]\n\n\nIn her Nobel lecture, which was delivered in writing, she highlighted her early engagement with poetry by William Blake, Stephen Foster and Emily Dickinson in discussing the relationship between poets, readers, and the wider public, also minimally citing T. S. Eliot and William Shakespeare.[9] She concluded her lecture, saying: \n\n\n> \"I believe that in awarding me this prize, the Swedish Academy is choosing to honor the intimate, private voice, which public utterance can sometimes augment or extend, but never replace.\"[9]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### 'Minstrel Show' controversy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)William Blake's first plate of *The Little Black Boy*\nImmediately after her lecture was made available, numerous literary critics and fellow poets described it as \"disastrously bad\" and \"refines racism.\"[10][11][12] Her invocation of Blake's \"The Little Black Boy\" (written by a white abolitionist in the voice of a Black boy who was enslaved) and Stephen Foster's \"Swanee River\" (a song by a writer whose work was a staple of minstrel shows) was questioned by many on Twitter.[12] Many noted that Gl\u00fcck, even if she meant to make a timely point about racism, might have used the words of an actual person of color, and not the caricature of a Black person as imagined by a white man.[11][12]\n\n\n\nMatt Sandler, author of *The Black Romantic Revolution: Abolitionist Poets at the End of Slavery*, commented on the Nobel lecture, saying: \n\n\n> \"Gl\u00fcck's undelivered Nobel Prize lecture stirred up a controversy so familiar as to seem rote, almost generic. An accomplished white artist proffers the refinement of their racism as craft, then awaits their due in attention, attack, defense, and more laurels... However carefully constructed her interior castle may be, Gl\u00fcck could hardly have failed to notice the resurgence of abolitionism over the past decade, especially in this past summer\u2019s massive protests of police violence... Gl\u00fcck\u2019s anecdote rang way off key, even for white readers who might in other moments have welcomed her indulgence. To mix her terms with those of the radical present, the racially maldistributed character of contemporary privacy is simply too obvious.\"[11]\n> \n> \n\n\nAmerican poet Mary Karr for whom Gl\u00fcck served as a thesis adviser expressed disappointment, saying: \"At this point in history, Louise Gl\u00fcck \u2013 my grad thesis advisor [and] a poet I deeply admire \u2013 wrote a minstrel show Nobel speech. In 1789, Blake's 'Black Boy' might have passed as 'abolitionist', but it came out of a shoe-polished white face. Wake TF up.\"[12] Poet Li Yin Alvarado reacted in Twitter, saying: \"elevating a poem \u2014 however abolitionist in intent \u2014 that is rooted in upholding white supremacy, understandably, I think, turns off readers for whom fighting against said supremacy is a not some literary or intellectual exercise, but an actual matter of survival.\"[12]\n\n\nActivist and author Faylita Hicks expressed: \"There was no reason to speak about the \"little Black boy\" conjured up by the mind of Blake. Any other poem could have stood in. It is violence when one chooses, still, to recommend and elevate a white man's caricature over any other Black man or women's genius.\"[12] American writer Alissa Quart compared Gl\u00fcck with the controversial 2019 Nobel laureate Peter Handke through a Twitter post: \"Louise Gluck follows Peter Handke as really wrong Nobel prize winners in literature. Why not Susan Howe, Anne Carson, Erica Hunt, Nathaniel Mackey, [or] Jorie Graham? Gluck and the vacuity of apolitical poetry of status quo leads directly to minstrelsy. No coincidence.\"[12]\n\n\n\n### Prize presentation[edit]\n\n\nDuring the award ceremony held on December 10, 2020, Prof. Anders Olsson delivered the following statement about Gl\u00fcck:[13] \n\n\n> \"Louise Gl\u00fcck's poems are written in retrospect. Childhood and taut relationships with parents and siblings are motifs that have never loosened their grip. Gl\u00fcck has produced twelve collections of poetry and a couple of volumes of essays on poetry, all marked by a drive for clarity. Nobody is more adamant than she against self-illusions. The autobiographical material is crucial, but Gl\u00fcck is scarcely a confessional poet. The \"truth\" to be revealed detours through imagination and vicarious voices, like the painter's. In several of her books, Gl\u00fcck speaks through mythical figures such as Dido, Persephone or Eurydice.\"\n> \n> \n\n \n> \"[She] is a writer not only of contradictions and austere reflection. She is also a poet of renewal, with few coequals. Even if her poetry is written in retrospect, and seems bound to the apple tree as it was seen once in childhood, one of her keywords is change. She teaches us that the moment of renewal is also the arrival of words. Her inner driving force is a spiritual hunger and an exceptional reverence for the possibilities of poetry. The leap of renewal can employ the seemingly plain diction of thoughtful parables, but also comedy and biting wit. And when Louise Gl\u00fcck in her later work confronts the inevitable end, there is a remarkable grace and lightness in her touch. It is a note that lingers and can carry us readers forward as well.\"\n> \n> \n\n\nDue to the restrictions by the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual Nobel banquet was postponed, however, Gl\u00fcck still received her medal, diploma and monetary prize from the Swedish Academy at her residence in New York City.[14]\n\n\n\n## Nobel Committee[edit]\n\n\nThe Swedish Academy's Nobel Committee for the 2020 Nobel Prize in Literature were the following members:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Committee Members** |\n| Seat No.\n | Picture\n | Name\n | Elected\n | Position\n | Profession\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | Anders Olsson (b. 1949)\n | 2008\n | committee chair\n | literary critic, literary historian\n |\n| 11\n | ![](image) | Mats Malm (b. 1964)\n | 2018\n | associate memberpermanent secretary\n | translator, literary historian, editor\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Jesper Svenbro (b. 1944)\n | 2006\n | member\n | poet, classical philologist |\n| 12\n | ![](image) | Per W\u00e4stberg (b. 1933)\n | 1997\n | member\n | novelist, journalist, poet, essayist\n |\n| **External Members** |\n|  | ![](image) | Mikaela Blomqvist (b. 1987)\n | 2018\n | member\n | literary critic, theatre critic\n |\n| ![](image) | Rebecka K\u00e4rde (b. 1991)\n | member\n | literary critic, translator\n |\n| ![](image) | Henrik Peterson (b. 1973)\n | member\n | translator, literary critic, publisher\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Price announcement nobelprize.org\n2. **^** The Nobel Prize in literature 2020 nobelprize.org\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Alison Flood (8 October 2020). \"Louise Gl\u00fcck wins the 2020 Nobel prize in literature\". *The Guardian*.

Wilson (b. 1937) \"for improvements to auction theory and inventions of new auction formats.\"[2][3][4] According to the Nobel Committee, the recognition was given because \"their theoretical discoveries have improved auctions in practice.\"[5][6] Furthermore, Secretary Hansson said: \n\n\n> \"This year's Laureates, Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson, have studied how auctions work. They have also used their insights to design new auction formats for goods and services that are difficult to sell in a traditional way, such as radio frequencies. Their discoveries have benefitted sellers, buyers and taxpayers around the world.\"[5]\n> \n> \n\n\nTheir joint key contributions to economics were the development of the simultaneous multiple round auctions (SMRA) and the reputation effects (game theory). Milgrom's personal contributions were on the no-trade theorem, market design, supermodular games, monotone comparative statics, Linkage principle, and deferred-acceptance auction, whereas Wilson's contributions were on the common value auction and the Wilson doctrine.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n### Paul Milgrom[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Paul Milgrom\n\nPaul Milgrom was born in Detroit, Michigan, April 20, 1948,[7] the second of four sons to Jewish parents.[8] Milgrom graduated from the University of Michigan in 1970 with an AB in mathematics.[9] He worked as an actuary for several years in San Francisco at the Metropolitan Insurance Company and then at the Nelson and Warren consultancy in Columbus, Ohio. Milgrom became a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries in 1974. In 1975, Milgrom enrolled for graduate studies at Stanford University and earned an MS in statistics in 1978 and a PhD in business in 1979.[9][10] He was the recipient of the 2008 Erwin Plein Nemmers Prize in Economics \"for contributions dramatically expanding the understanding of the role of information and incentives in a variety of settings, including auctions, the theory of the firm, and oligopolistic markets\"; the 2012 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award \"for his seminal contributions to an unusually wide range of fields of economics including auctions, market design, contracts and incentives, industrial economics, economics of organizations, finance, and game theory\"; the 2014 Golden Goose Award; and the 2018 John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of Science with Robert B Wilson and David M. Kreps.\n\n\n\n### Robert B. Wilson[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Robert B. Wilson\n\nWilson was born on May 16, 1937, in Geneva, Nebraska. He graduated from Lincoln High School in Lincoln, Nebraska and earned a full scholarship to Harvard University. He received his A.B. from Harvard College in 1959. He then completed his M.B.A. in 1961 and his D.B.A.[11] in 1963 from the Harvard Business School.[12] He worked at the University of California, Los Angeles for a very brief time and then joined the faculty at Stanford University. He has been on the faculty of the Stanford Business School since 1964. He was also an affiliated faculty member of Harvard Law School from 1993 to 2001.[13] He was the recipient of the 2014 Golden Goose Award for his work involving auction design; the 2015 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award \"for his \"pioneering contributions to the analysis of strategic interactions when economic agents have limited and different information about their environment\"; and the 2018 John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of Science with David M. Kreps and Paul Milgrom.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Nobel Prize amounts\". Nobelprize.org.
