He was educated at Bromsgrove School, where he was head boy. He served as a teacher in Senegal with the charity Voluntary Service Overseas for a year, after which he earned a first in law at St. Edmund Hall, Oxford.[1][2][3] Following graduation he worked as a reporter for the Newcastle-upon-Tyne *Evening Chronicle* before moving to London Weekend Television where he worked on *Weekend World* and *The London Programme* and was executive producer of *The South Bank Show* from 1982 to 1984.[3] During this time he also wrote and adapted screenplays for television broadcast.[3]\n\n\nHe tried to enter into film producing in the early 1990s, but his efforts did not come to fruition, and *The New York Times* described him as \"broke and adrift\" at that stage in his life; he had also been diagnosed with melanoma, though he would recover.[4] But during this time, he heard from a friend a \"story that made me shiver\": a \"horse whisperer\" in southwest England who could heal and soothe horses. £60,000 in debt, he decided to write the story as a novel as opposed to a screenplay, having felt burned by his previous attempts to mount his own film. In the course of research, he travelled to the U.S. states of Montana, New Mexico, and California. The rights for his novel were sold by his agent and friend Caradoc King for US$3 million at the 1994 Frankfurt Book Fair.[1]\n\n\nHis debut novel *The Horse Whisperer* was No. 10 on the list of bestselling novels in the United States for 1995 as determined by *The New York Times*. With 15 million copies sold, it is on the list of the best-selling books of all time.[5] In the UK, *The Horse Whisperer* was listed at 195 on the BBC's Big Read, a 2003 survey with the goal of finding the \"nation's best-loved book\".[6] It was made into a film in 1998; Robert Redford directed, and he starred opposite Kristin Scott Thomas, along with Scarlett Johansson and Sam Neill.[4]\n\n\nEvans revealed on his personal website that he agreed to an option to make a film of his third novel, *The Smoke Jumper*.[7]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and death[edit]\n\n\nEvans married Oxford classmate Jenny Lyon in 1973; they had two children and divorced in the 1990s.[1] He then married singer-songwriter Charlotte Gordon Cumming. They had one child, and he also had a child from a relationship with television producer Jane Hewland.[1][4]\n\n\nEvans, Cumming and several of their relatives were poisoned in September 2008 after mistakenly consuming deadly webcap mushrooms that they gathered on holiday in Morayshire. They all had to undergo kidney dialysis,[8] and Evans underwent a transplant in 2011 using a kidney donated by his daughter.[9]\n\n\nEvans died from a heart attack at his home on 9 August 2022, aged 72.[10] Media sources differed on whether he died in London[4] or in Totnes, Devon.[1]\n\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* *The Horse Whisperer* (1995)[11]\n* *The Loop* (1998)[12]\n* *The Smoke Jumper* (2001)[13]\n* *The Divide* (2005)[14]\n* *The Brave* (2010)[15]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Smith, Harrison (15 August 2022). \"Nicholas Evans, whose 'Horse Whisperer' became a phenomenon, dies at 72\". *The Washington Post*.

She is best known for her 2018 novel *Where the Crawdads Sing*.\n\n\nOwens was born and raised in Southern Georgia, where she spent most of her life in or near true wilderness. She received a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology from the University of Georgia, and a PhD in animal behavior from the University of California, Davis.[3]\n\n\nOwens met Mark Owens in a protozoology class at the University of Georgia when they were both graduate students studying biology.[4] They married in 1973, and in 1974 moved to southern Africa to study animals in the Kalahari Desert and Zambia. She wrote about Africa in her memoirs *Cry of the Kalahari*, *The Eye of the Elephant*, and *Secrets of the Savanna*.[5] The couple were expelled from Botswana and are wanted for questioning in Zambia in relation to a murder investigation. They are no longer married. Since returning to the United States, Delia Owens has been involved in bear conservation.\n\n\nHer debut novel, *Where the Crawdads Sing*, was released in 2018. It became one of the best-selling books of all time. It was adapted into a 2022 film of the same name.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nOwens grew up in Thomasville which is in southern Georgia; she has mostly lived in or near true wilderness.[6][7] She and her then husband, Mark, were biology students at the University of Georgia; she received a Bachelor of Science in zoology there and a PhD in animal behavior from the University of California, Davis. She knew she wanted to be a writer, but she decided on a career in science.[8]\n\n\nThe couple moved to Africa in 1974, travelling for some time before making camp in the Kalahari Desert, Botswana. *Cry of the Kalahari* was written about the couple's experience there. After they campaigned against the local cattle industry, Botswanan government officials expelled them from the country.[1] The Owenses then settled in North Luangwa National Park, Zambia, and later in Mpika, Zambia in the early 1990s.[1] *Cry of the Kalahari* and her two other non-fictional bestselling books, *The Eye of the Elephant* and *Secrets of the Savanna*, all concern the couple's research and conservation work. In Zambia they contributed to reducing the poaching of elephants, by helping poachers earn a living with skills such as beekeeping, carpentry, midwifery, and weaving.[9]\n\n\nSince completing her PhD in biology, Owens has published her studies of African wildlife behavioral ecology in journals including *Nature*,[10] the *Journal of Mammalogy*,[11] *Animal Behaviour*,[12] and the *African Journal of Ecology*.[13] She has contributed articles to *Natural History*[14] and *International Wildlife*, where she was a \"roving editor\" for more than 20 years.[15]\n\n\nDelia and Mark Owens are divorced. For many years, Delia lived in Boundary County, Idaho which is twenty miles from Canada. However in 2019–2020, she moved to a former horse farm near Asheville, North Carolina.[16][17]\n\n\nOwens is the co-founder of the Owens Foundation for Wildlife Conservation in Stone Mountain, Georgia. She has also worked as a roving editor for *International Wildlife*, lectured throughout North America and participated in conservation efforts for the grizzly bear throughout the United States.[18]\n\n\nShe released her debut novel, *Where the Crawdads Sing*, in 2018, which topped *The New York Times* Fiction Best Sellers of 2019 and *The New York Times* Fiction Best Sellers of 2020 for 32 non-consecutive weeks and was on the list for 135 weeks in total. It also gave rise to a successful feature film.[19][20][21] In 2022, Reese Witherspoon acquired movie rights for her production company to bring the novel to the screen.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Supposed Zambian murder case[edit]\n\n\nOwens' former husband, Mark, has been accused of operating a \"shoot to kill\" policy against poachers while the couple were living in Zambia. ABC News aired a report in 1996, titled \"Deadly Game: The Mark and Delia Owens Story\". The report featured the killing of a poacher in Zambia, allegedly committed by Delia's stepson, Christopher. To this day, Delia Owens denies the incident, explaining she was not involved, and there was never a case. However, her 2018 best selling novel, *Where the Crawdads Sing*, has aroused suspicion from those on her book tour about the parallels between the main character Kya and her case, and Delia's own alleged accusation. The Owenses have denied the accusations.[22][23][1] No charges were brought against Owens or her ex-husband Mark, or stepson Christopher. Zambian officials told Jeffery Goldberg, a journalist and editor-in-chief of *The Atlantic Magazine*, that they do not believe Owens is a suspect. However, they do believe that she is the most important witness.[24] Owens has never been sought for questioning by the Zambian authorities.[9]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n* 1981 – Rolex Award for Enterprise for Kalahari Research Project (with former husband, Mark Owens)[18]\n* 1985 – John Burroughs Award (with Mark Owens)[25]\n* 1993 – University of California Outstanding Alumnus Award[18]\n* 1994 – Order of the Golden Ark (Netherlands)[18]\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n### Novels[edit]\n\n\n* *Where the Crawdads Sing* (2018)\n\n\n### Memoirs[edit]\n\n\n* *Cry of the Kalahari* (1984)\n* *The Eye of the Elephant* (1992)[26][27]\n* *Secrets of the Savanna* (2006)[28]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Ethology in fiction – animal behavior in fiction, as exemplified by the account in *Where the Crawdads Sing*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Goldberg, Jeffrey (March 29, 2010). \"The Hunted\". *The New Yorker*.\n2. **^** \"Delia Owens - Google Search\". *www.google.com*.

He is best known for *The Book Thief* and *The Messenger*, two novels which became international bestsellers. He won the Margaret A. Edwards Award in 2014.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nZusak was born in Sydney, Australia. His mother Lisa is originally from Germany and his father Helmut is Austrian. They immigrated to Australia in the late 1950s.[2][3] Zusak is the youngest of four children and has two sisters and one brother. He attended Engadine High School and briefly returned there to teach English while writing. He studied English and history at the University of New South Wales, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma of Education.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nZusak is the author of six books. His first three books, *The Underdog*, *Fighting Ruben Wolfe*, and *When Dogs Cry*, released between 1999 and 2001, were all published internationally. *The Messenger*, published in 2002, won the 2003 CBC Book of the Year Award (Older Readers) and the 2003 NSW Premier's Literary Award (Ethel Turner Prize) in Australia and was a runner-up for the Printz Award in America.\n\n\n*The Book Thief* was published in 2005 and has since been translated into more than 40 languages. *The Book Thief* was adapted as a film of the same name in 2013. In 2014, Zusak delivered a talk called 'The Failurist' at TEDxSydney at the Sydney Opera House. It focused on his drafting process and journey to success through writing *The Book Thief*.[4]\n\n\n*The Messenger* (*I Am the Messenger* in the United States) was published in 2002 and was one of Zusak's first novels. This novel has won awards such as the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards: Ethel Turner Prize for Young People's Literature.[5]\n\n\nIn March 2016 Zusak talked about his then unfinished novel *Bridge of Clay.* He stated that the book was 90% finished but that, \"I'm a completely different person than the person who wrote *The Book Thief*. And this is also the scary thing—I'm a different person to the one who started *Bridge of Clay* eight, nine years ago ... I've got to get it done this year, or else I'll probably finally have to set it aside.\"[6]\n\n\nA TV series based on *The Messenger* premiered on ABC in 2023.[7] Zusak said his next book would be a \"memoir type thing\" and not fiction.[7]\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* *The Underdog* (1999)\n* *Fighting Ruben Wolfe* (2000), sequel to *The Underdog*\n* *When Dogs Cry* (2001), a.k.a. *Getting the Girl*; sequel to *Fighting Ruben Wolfe*\n* *The Messenger* (2002), US title: *I Am the Messenger*\n* *The Book Thief* (2005)\n* *Bridge of Clay* (2018), Pan Macmillan Australia\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Zusak won the Margaret A. Edwards Award from the American Library Association (ALA), which annually recognises an author and \"a specific body of his or her work, for significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature\".[1]\n\n\nIn 2006, Zusak was also the recipient of The Sydney Morning Herald's Young Australian Novelist of the Year Award.\n\n\n\n* *The Book Thief*\n\t+ 2006: Kathleen Mitchell Award 2006 (literature)[8]\n\t+ 2006: National Jewish Book Award (Children's and Young Adult Literature)[9]\n\t+ 2007: Michael L.

She has been called \"the laureate of the nursery\" for her achievements.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Life and career[edit]\n\n\nBrown was born in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, the middle child of three of Maude Margaret (Johnson) and Robert Bruce Brown.[1][3] She was the granddaughter of politician Benjamin Gratz Brown. Her parents had an unhappy marriage. She was initially raised in Brooklyn's Greenpoint neighborhood, and attended Chateau Brilliantmont boarding school in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1923,[4][5] while her parents were living in India and Canterbury, Connecticut. In 1925, she attended The Kew-Forest School.[6] She began attending Dana Hall School in Wellesley, Massachusetts, in 1926, where she did well in athletics. After graduation in 1928, Brown went on to Hollins College in Roanoke, Virginia.\n\n\nBrown was an avid, lifelong beagler and was noted for her ability to keep pace, on foot, with the hounds.[7]\n\n\nFollowing her graduation with a B.A. in English[1] from Hollins in 1932, Brown worked as a teacher and also studied art. While working at the Bank Street Experimental School in New York City she started writing books for children. Bank Street promoted a new approach to children's education and literature, emphasizing the real world and the \"here and now\".[8] This philosophy influenced Brown's work; she was also inspired by the poet Gertrude Stein, whose literary style influenced Brown's own writing.[8]\n\n\nBrown's first published children's book was *When the Wind Blew*, published in 1937 by Harper & Brothers. Impressed by Brown's \"here and now\" style, W. R. Scott hired her as his first editor in 1938.[9] Through Scott, she published the *Noisy Book* series among others. As editor at Scott, one of Brown's first projects was to recruit contemporary authors to write children's books for the company. Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck neglected to respond, but Brown's hero Gertrude Stein accepted the offer.[8] Stein's book *The World is Round* was illustrated by Clement Hurd,[10] who had previously teamed with Brown on W. R. Scott's *Bumble Bugs and Elephants*, considered \"perhaps the first modern board book for babies\".[11] Brown and Hurd later teamed on the children's book classics *The Runaway Bunny* and *Goodnight Moon*, published by Harper. In addition to publishing a number of Brown's books, under her editorship W. R. Scott published Edith Thacher Hurd's first book, *Hurry Hurry*, and Esphyr Slobodkina's classic *Caps for Sale*.\n\n\nThe New York Public Library initially banned *Good Night Moon* due to the influence of retired librarian Anne Carrol Moore, who reportedly \"hated\" the book. It wasn't until 1972 that the book was finally made available to patrons.[12]\n\n\nFrom 1944 to 1946, Doubleday published three picture books written by Brown under the pseudonym \"Golden MacDonald\" (coopted from her friend's handyman)[7] and illustrated by Leonard Weisgard. Weisgard was a runner-up for the Caldecott Medal in 1946, and he won the 1947 Medal for *Little Lost Lamb* and *The Little Island*. Two more of their collaborations appeared in 1953 and 1956, after Brown's death. *The Little Fisherman*, illustrated by Dahlov Ipcar, was published in 1945. *The Little Fur Family*, illustrated by Garth Williams, was published in 1946. Early in the 1950s she wrote several books for the Little Golden Books series, including *The Color Kittens*, *Mister Dog*, and *Scuppers The Sailor Dog.*\n\n\n\n## Personal life and death[edit]\n\n\nWhile at Hollins she was briefly engaged.[13] She dated, for some time, an unknown \"good, quiet man from Virginia,\"[14] had a long-running affair with William Gaston,[15][16] and had a summer romance with Preston Schoyer.[17] In the summer of 1940, Brown began a long-term relationship with Blanche Oelrichs (pen name Michael Strange), poet/playwright, actress, and the former wife of John Barrymore. The relationship, which began as a mentoring one, eventually became romantic and included co-habiting at 10 Gracie Square in New York beginning in 1943.[18] As a studio, they used Cobble Court, a wooden house later moved to Charles Street. Oelrichs, who was almost 20 years Brown's senior, died in 1950.\n\n\nBrown went by various nicknames in different circles of friends. To her Dana Hall and Hollins friends she was \"Tim,\" as her hair was the color of timothy hay.[19] To Bank Street friends she was \"Brownie.\"[20] To William Gaston she was \"Goldie,\" in keeping with the use of Golden MacDonald as the author of *The Little Island.*[16]\n\n\nIn 1952, Brown met James Stillman 'Pebble' Rockefeller Jr. at a party, and they became engaged. Later that year, while on a book tour in Nice, France, she died at 42 of an embolism, shortly after surgery for a ruptured appendix. Kicking up her leg to show her nurses how well she was feeling caused a blood clot that had formed in her leg to dislodge and travel to her heart.[21]\n\n\nA 1992 profile in the New Yorker \"The Radical Woman Behind 'Goodnight Moon,'\" featured a trip through Brown's \"Only House\" island cottage in Vinalhaven, Maine, which still retains elements of her picture books. The profile includes an interview with Rockefeller, noting that he was one of the few living people who'd known Brown well. They had planned to marry in Panama and honeymoon aboard his boat, the Mandalay, but she did not recover.[22]\n\n\n\"She was so full in her own life,\" Rockefeller told the interviewer. \"And yet there must have been a lack, somewhere along the line. But whether she would like an ordinary marriage, with children—I just couldn't really see her in that.\"[22]\n\n\nIn 2018, Rockefeller released a memoir called *Wayfarer,* about his own long life of adventure, including his memories of Brown.[23]\n\n\n\nBy the time of Brown's death, she had authored well over one hundred books. Her ashes were scattered at her island home, \"The Only House,\" in Vinalhaven, Maine.[21]\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nBrown bequeathed the royalties to many of her books including *Goodnight Moon* and *The Runaway Bunny* to Albert Clarke, the son of a neighbor who was nine years old when she died. In 2000, reporter Joshua Prager detailed in *The Wall Street Journal* the troubled life of Clarke, who has squandered the millions of dollars the books have earned him and who believes that Brown was his mother, a claim others dismiss.[24]\n\n\nBrown left behind over 70 unpublished manuscripts. After unsuccessfully trying to sell them, her sister Roberta Brown Rauch kept them in a cedar trunk for decades. In 1991, a future biographer, Amy Gary of WaterMark Inc., rediscovered the paper-clipped bundles, more than 500 typewritten pages in all, and set about getting the stories published.[25]\n\n\nMany of Brown's books have been re-issued with new illustrations decades after their original publication. Many more of her books are still in print with the original illustrations. Her books have been translated into several languages. Full-length biographies on Brown have been written by Leonard S. Marcus (Harper Paperbacks, 1999), and by Amy Gary (Flatiron Books, 2017).[26] There are also several biographies for children, including by Carol Greene (Rookie Biographies, 1994), Jill C. Wheeler (Checkerboard Books, 2006), Mac Barnett (HarperCollins, 2019), and Candice Ransom (William B Eerdmans, 2021). Claudia H. Pearson published a Freudian analysis of Brown's \"classic series\" of bunny books, entitled *Have a Carrot* (Look Again Press, 2010).[27]\n\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Big Red Barn* (reissue), illustrated by Felicia Bond\nDuring her lifetime, Brown essentially had four publishers: Harper & Brothers, W. R. Scott, Doubleday, and Little Golden Books. The books written for Doubleday were published under the pseudonym \"Golden MacDonald\". All were unpaged picture books illustrated by Leonard Weisgard.

He rose to prominence as a writer in the 1940s with works for children and for adults, and he became one of the world's best-selling authors.[6][7] His awards for contribution to literature include the 1983 World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement and the British Book Awards' Children's Author of the Year in 1990.

They had two children together (Ellen Marguerite and Louis) before her death in 1907.[16] Roald Dahl's mother belonged to a well-established Norwegian family of lawyers, priests in the state church and wealthy merchants and estate owners, and emigrated to the UK when she married his father in 1911. Dahl was named after Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen.[17] His first language was Norwegian, which he spoke at home with his parents and his sisters Astri, Alfhild, and Else. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** Liukkonen, Petri. \"Roald Dahl\". *Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi)*.

A panel of seven academics, journalists and historians named Dahl among the group of people in the UK \"whose actions during the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on lives in these islands and given the age its character\".[101] In September 2016, Dahl's daughter Lucy received the BBC's *Blue Peter* Gold badge in his honour, the first time it had ever been awarded posthumously.[102]\n\n\n\n## Writing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Roald Dahl's story \"The Devious Bachelor\" was illustrated by Frederick Siebel when it was published in *Collier's* (September 1953).\nDahl's first published work, inspired by a meeting with C. S. Forester, was \"A Piece of Cake\", on 1 August 1942. The story, about his wartime adventures, was bought by *The Saturday Evening Post* for US$1,000 (equivalent to $19,000 in 2023) and published under the title \"Shot Down Over Libya\".[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRowling named *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory* one of her top ten books every child should read.[178] Critics have commented on the similarities between the Dursley family from *Harry Potter* and the nightmarish guardians seen in many of Dahl's books, such as Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker from *James and the Giant Peach*, Grandma from *George's Marvellous Medicine*, and the Wormwoods from *Matilda*.[179] In 2012, *Matilda* was ranked number 30 among all-time best children's novels in a survey published by *School Library Journal*, a monthly with primarily US audience. The Top 100 included four books by Dahl, more than any other writer.[180] The American magazine *Time* named three Dahl books in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time, more than any other author.[181] Dahl is one of the most borrowed authors in UK libraries.[182][183]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". *The Times*. 5 January 2008.
