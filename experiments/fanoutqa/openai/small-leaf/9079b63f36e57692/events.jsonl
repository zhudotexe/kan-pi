Lamb became a partner in 1920; the firm would be known as Shreve & Lamb from 1924 to 1929 and thereafter as Shreve, Lamb and Harmon. Lamb's notable projects include the Empire State Building, the Standard Oil Building, 521 Fifth Avenue, the Forbes Magazine Building, and the General Motors Building in New York City; the Acacia Mutual Life Insurance Building in Washington, D.C.; and academic buildings for the Connecticut College for Women, Williams College, Cornell University, and Wesleyan University. In addition to his studies at the École des Beaux Arts, Lamb received a bachelor's degree from Williams College in 1904 and did graduate work at the School of Architecture, Columbia University, from 1904 to 1906. Lamb received an honorary doctorate from Williams College in 1932; other honors include two gold medals from the Fifth Avenue Association (1930, 1931), a medal from the Architectural League of New York (1931), and a medal of honor from the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (1932). He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Art Commission of the City of New York, the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, and the Architectural League of New York. In the period preceding the 1939 New York World's fair, Lamb served as \"Coordinator of Design\" for the fair's board of planners.[1] Lamb served on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1937 to 1945, including as vice chairman from 1941 to 1945.[2] In 1942 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1950.\n\n\nThe firm also designed 521 Fifth Avenue, the Forbes Magazine Building, the Standard Oil Building, and the Bankers Trust Building and worked with H. Craig Severance on 40 Wall Street in New York. He also designed the Reynolds Building in Winston-Salem, North Carolina\n\n\nHe died in New York on September 8, 1952.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Ferriss, Hugh. \"Power in Buildings: an Artist's View of Contemporary Architecture\" Hennessey & Ingalls, 1998.\n2. **^** Thomas E.

In 1999, he was appointed by the trust as a design consultant for future work.[64]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The building illuminated at night\nBefore the Sydney Opera House competition, Jørn Utzon had won seven of the 18 competitions he had entered but had never seen any of his designs built.[54] Utzon's submitted concept for the Sydney Opera House was almost universally admired and considered groundbreaking. The Assessors Report of January 1957 stated:\n\n\n\n\n> The drawings submitted for this scheme are simple to the point of being diagrammatic. Nevertheless, as we have returned again and again to the study of these drawings, we are convinced that they present a concept of an Opera House which is capable of becoming one of the great buildings of the world.\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Inflation Calculator\".

The design was one of the first examples of the use of computer-aided design to design complex shapes. The design techniques developed by Utzon and Arup for the Sydney Opera House have been further developed and are now used for architecture, such as works of Gehry and blobitecture, as well as most reinforced concrete structures. The design is also one of the first in the world to use araldite to glue the precast structural elements together and proved the concept for future use.\n\n\nIt was also a first in mechanical engineering. Another Danish firm, Steensen Varming, was responsible for designing the new air-conditioning plant, the largest in Australia at the time, supplying over 600,000 cubic feet (17,000 m3) of air per minute,[61] using the innovative idea of harnessing the harbour water to create a water-cooled heat pump system that is still in operation today.[62]\n\n\n\n### Opening[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** \"Sydney Architecture Images- Sydney Opera House\".

The architectural work was divided between three appointees who became the Hall, Todd, Littlemore partnership. David Littlemore would manage construction supervision, Lionel Todd contract documentation, while the crucial role of design became the responsibility of Peter Hall.[71]: 45\n\n\nHall completed a combined arts and architecture degree at Sydney University. Upon graduation a travel scholarship enabled him to spend twelve months in Europe during which time he visited Utzon in Hellebæk.[72] Returning to Sydney, Hall worked for the Government Architect, a branch of the NSW Public Works Department. While there he established himself as a talented design architect with a number of court and university buildings, including the Goldstein Hall at the University of New South Wales, which won the Sir John Sulman Medal in 1964.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Construction started | 1 March 1959; 65 years ago (1959-03-01) |\n| Completed | 1973; 51 years ago (1973) |\n| Opened | 20 October 1973; 50 years ago (1973-10-20) |\n| Inaugurated | 20 October 1973; 50 years ago (1973-10-20) |\n| Cost | A$102 million, equivalent to A$1082 million in 2022[1] |\n| Client | NSW government |\n| Owner | NSW Government |\n| Height | 65 m (213 ft) |\n| Dimensions |\n| Other dimensions | * length 183 m (600 ft)\n* width 120 m (394 ft)\n* area 1.8 ha (4.4 acres)\n |\n| Technical details |\n| Structural system | Concrete frame & precast concrete ribbed roof |\n| Design and construction |\n| Architect(s) | Jørn Utzon |\n| Structural engineer | Ove Arup & Partners |\n| Main contractor | Civil & Civic (level 1), M.R.

One of the first was that Utzon believed the clients should receive information on all aspects of the design and construction through his practice, while the clients wanted a system (notably drawn in sketch form by Davis Hughes) where architect, contractors, and engineers each reported to the client directly and separately. This had great implications for procurement methods and cost control, with Utzon wishing to negotiate contracts with chosen suppliers (such as Ralph Symonds for the plywood interiors) and the New South Wales government insisting contracts be put out to tender.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** \"The 1972 Sydney Opera House Work-In\". *The Commons*. 23 March 2022.

The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.[6]\n\n\nThe building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour, between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove, adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens, and near to the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. **^** \"Sydney Opera House – the Architect – Sydney Opera House\". *www.sydneyoperahouse.com*.

It was originally credited to Utzon. Ove Arup's letter to Ashworth, a member of the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee, states: \"Utzon came up with an idea of making all the shells of uniform curvature throughout in both directions.\"[37] Peter Jones, the author of Ove Arup's biography, states that \"the architect and his supporters alike claimed to recall the precise *eureka* moment ...; the engineers and some of their associates, with equal conviction, recall discussion in both central London and at Ove's house.\"\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe goes on to claim that \"the existing evidence shows that Arup's canvassed several possibilities for the geometry of the shells, from parabolas to ellipsoids and spheres.\"[35] Yuzo Mikami, a member of the design team, presents an opposite view in his book on the project, *Utzon's Sphere*.[38][39] It is unlikely that the truth will ever be categorically known, but there is a clear consensus that the design team worked very well indeed for the first part of the project and that Utzon, Arup, and Ronald Jenkins (partner of Ove Arup and Partners responsible for the Opera House project) all played a very significant part in the design development.[40]\n\n\nAs Peter Murray states in *The Saga of the Sydney Opera House*:[33]\n\n\n\n\n> ... the two men—and their teams—enjoyed a collaboration that was remarkable in its fruitfulness and, despite many traumas, was seen by most of those involved in the project as a high point of architect/engineer collaboration.\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Littlemore, D.S. *Sydney Opera House, Anatomy of Stage Three construction and completion: a general index*.

Few clients have been more patient or more generous than the people and the Government of NSW. One would not like history to record that this partnership was brought to an end by a fit of temper on the one side or by a fit of meanness on the other.\" On 17 March 1966, the *Herald* offered the view that:[60] \"It was not his [Utzon's] fault that a succession of Governments and the Opera House Trust should so signally have failed to impose any control or order on the project ... his concept was so daring that he himself could solve its problems only step by step ... his insistence on perfection led him to alter his design as he went along.\"\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Concert Hall prior to renovations in 2020\nThe second stage of construction was progressing toward completion when Utzon resigned. His position was principally taken over by Peter Hall, who became largely responsible for the interior design. Other persons appointed that same year to replace Utzon were E. H. Farmer as government architect, D. S. Littlemore and Lionel Todd.\n\n\nFollowing Utzon's resignation, the acoustic advisor, Lothar Cremer, confirmed to the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC) that Utzon's original acoustic design allowed for only 2,000 seats in the main hall and further stated that increasing the number of seats to 3,000 as specified in the brief would be disastrous for the acoustics. According to Peter Jones, the stage designer, Martin Carr, criticised the \"shape, height and width of the stage, the physical facilities for artists, the location of the dressing rooms, the widths of doors and lifts, and the location of lighting switchboards.\"[48]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 29 March 2016, an original 1959 tapestry by Le Corbusier (2.18 x 3.55 metres), commissioned by Utzon to be hung in the Sydney Opera House and called *Les Dés Sont Jetés* (The Dice Are Cast), was finally unveiled *in situ* after being owned by the Utzon family and held at their home in Denmark for over 50 years. The tapestry was bought at auction by the Sydney Opera House in June 2015. It now hangs in the building's Western Foyer and is accessible to the public.[70]\n\n\nIn the second half of 2017, the Joan Sutherland Theatre was closed to replace the stage machinery and for other works.\n\n\n\n## Architectural design role of Peter Hall[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUtzon was highly reluctant to respond to questions or criticism from the client's Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC).[56] However, he was greatly supported throughout by a member of the committee and one of the original competition judges, Harry Ingham Ashworth. Utzon was unwilling to compromise on some aspects of his designs that the clients wanted to change.\n\n\nUtzon's ability was never in doubt, despite questions raised by Davis Hughes, who attempted to portray Utzon as an impractical dreamer. Ove Arup actually stated that Utzon was \"probably the best of any I have come across in my long experience of working with architects\"[57] and: \"The Opera House could become the world's foremost contemporary masterpiece if Utzon is given his head.\"\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Utzon's initial sketches in 1957\nThe winner, announced in 1957, was Danish architect Jørn Utzon. Utzon's design was selected by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen from a final cut of 30 rejects.[27] The runner-up was a Philadelphia-based team assembled by Robert Geddes and George Qualls, both teaching at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design. They brought together a band of Penn faculty and friends from Philadelphia architectural offices, including Melvin Brecher, Warren Cunningham, Joseph Marzella, Walter Wiseman, and Leon Loschetter. Geddes, Brecher, Qualls, and Cunningham went on to found the firm GBQC Architects. The grand prize was 5,000 Australian pounds.[28] Utzon visited Sydney in 1957 to help supervise the project.[29] His office moved to Palm Beach, Sydney in February 1963.[30]\n\n\nUtzon received the Pritzker Architecture Prize, architecture's highest honour, in 2003.[31] The Pritzker Prize citation read:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe layout of the interiors was changed, and the stage machinery, already designed and fitted inside the major hall, was pulled out and largely thrown away, as detailed in the 1968 BBC TV documentary *Autopsy on a Dream*, which \"chronicles the full spectrum of controversy surrounding the construction of the Sydney Opera House\".[49]\n* Externally, the cladding to the podium and the paving (the podium was originally not to be clad down to the water, but to be left open).\n* The construction of the glass walls (Utzon was planning to use a system of prefabricated plywood mullions, but a different system was designed to deal with the glass).\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Sydney Opera House sails formed a graphic projection-screen in a lightshow mounted in connection with the International Fleet Review in Sydney Harbour on 5 October 2013.[83]\n\n\nOn 31 December 2013, the venue's 40th anniversary year, a New Year fireworks display was mounted for the first time in a decade.[84] The Sydney Opera House hosted an event, 'the biggest blind date' on Friday 21 February 2014 that won an historic Guinness World Record.[85] The longest continuous serving employee was commemorated on 27 June 2018, for 50 years of service.[86]\n\n\nOn 14 June 2019, a state memorial service for former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke was held at the Sydney Opera House.\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_AiCJlBZjzj7ycsu1m9qIftR0","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
