In an effort to reduce travel, each team played only nine opponents during the regular season instead of the usual 19 or 20. Teams were scheduled to play 10 games against each of their four division opponents. The remaining 20 games of the 60-game schedule were interleague contests. To reduce travel, the interleague division match-ups were AL East vs NL East, AL Central vs NL Central, and AL West vs NL West.[9] At 60 games, this was the shortest regular season since 1878.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about the 2020 Major League Baseball season only.

All first and second place teams in the six divisions would qualify for the playoffs. The final two spots in each league would go to the remaining teams with the best win–loss records. The teams in each league would be seeded by division winners (1–3), division runners-up (4–6), and best teams remaining (7–8). Seeding ties would be resolved by head-to-head record, intra-league record, and record in final 20 intra-league games, to remove the necessity for additional games. The first round of the playoffs would be a best-of-three series called the Wild Card Series, with all games to be played at the home of the higher seeded team. After that, the postseason would follow the usual pattern of five-game Division series, seven-game League Championship Series, and a seven-game World Series.[38][39]\n\n\n\n### Postponed games[edit]\n\n\n#### COVID-19[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **2020 Major League Baseball season** began on July 23 and ended on September 27 with only 60 games amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The full 162-game regular season was planned to begin on March 26, but the pandemic caused Major League Baseball (MLB) to announce on March 12 that the remainder of spring training was canceled and that the start of the regular season would be delayed by at least two weeks.[1] On March 16, MLB announced that the season would be postponed indefinitely, following recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to restrict events of more than 50 people.[2] This was the first time that MLB games had been put on hold since the 2001 season, when the season was paused for over a week after the September 11 attacks.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Wild Card Series was a best-of-three series at the home field of the higher-seeded team, while the Division Series, League Championship Series, and World Series were their normal lengths, played at neutral sites, similar to those used for both the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League playoffs, to limit the possibility of another COVID-19 outbreak that could both disrupt the schedule and affect competitive integrity.[55] Specifically, the American League played at the San Diego Padres' Petco Park and the Los Angeles Dodgers' Dodger Stadium, while the National League played at the Texas Rangers' Globe Life Field and the Houston Astros' Minute Maid Park so that no teams will play at their home ballparks in the weightiest rounds to avoid unfair advantage.[56] The World Series then took place at Globe Life Field.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_49mKCpxE0fbJC836mrwhXsoE","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

They played six to seven games against each of the other ten same-league opponents for a total of 66 games, and 20 interleague games. For the second season in a row, interleague play will be between corresponding regions (AL East vs. NL East, AL Central vs. NL Central, and AL West vs. NL West) rather than continue the annual rotation. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n281. **^** \"Phillies retiring Roy Halladay's No. 34 during Wall of Fame Weekend\". *6abc.com*.

The 2021–22 lockout caused the season to be delayed by one week, starting on April 7. The regular season ended on October 5. The start of the season was delayed by a lockout of players, which commenced on December 2, 2021, following the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the league and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA).[2] On March 10, 2022, MLB and the MLBPA reached a deal on a five-year CBA, with Opening Day being held on April 7 (delayed from its originally planned March 31), and a full 162-game schedule played. Under the new CBA, universal designated hitter was adopted, and the postseason was expanded to 12 teams. In November 2021, the Cleveland Indians announced their new team name, the Cleveland Guardians.[3] The 2022 MLB All-Star Game was held on July 19 and hosted by the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.[4]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMajor League Baseball released its 2022 regular season schedule on August 4, 2021. As has been the case since 2013, all teams play their four division opponents 19 times each for a total of 76 games, play six or seven games against each of the other ten same-league opponents for a total of 66 games, and 20 interleague games. Interleague play will feature AL East vs. NL Central, AL Central vs. NL West, and AL West vs. NL East.[9][10]\n\n\nThe MLB at Field of Dreams game returned for a second year, featuring the Chicago Cubs and the Cincinnati Reds at the purpose-built ballpark in Dyersville, Iowa, on August 11.[11] The Cubs won the game 4–2.\n\n\nThe annual MLB Little League Classic featured the Boston Red Sox and the Baltimore Orioles at Bowman Field in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, on August 21.[12] The Orioles won the game 5–3.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNL West | W | L | Pct. | GB | Home | Road |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| (1) Los Angeles Dodgers | 111 | 51\n | 0.685\n | —\n | 57–24\n | 54–27\n |\n| (5) San Diego Padres | 89 | 73\n | 0.549\n | 22\n | 44–37\n | 45–36\n |\n| San Francisco Giants | 81 | 81\n | 0.500\n | 30\n | 44–37\n | 37–44\n |\n| Arizona Diamondbacks | 74 | 88\n | 0.457\n | 37\n | 40–41\n | 34–47\n |\n| Colorado Rockies | 68 | 94\n | 0.420\n | 43\n | 41–40\n | 27–54\n |\n\n\n |\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\n* The Atlanta Braves clinched the NL East over the New York Mets by winning the head-to-head regular season series 10–9.[21]\n\n\n## Postseason[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Major League Baseball postseason\n\nThe postseason began on October 7, and ended on November 5.[22]\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** R.J.
