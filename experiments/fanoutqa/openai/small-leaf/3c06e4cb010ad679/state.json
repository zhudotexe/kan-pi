He was promoted in 1983 to secretary, becoming the top official of the county.[23] Xi subsequently served in four provinces during his regional political career: Hebei (1982\u20131985), Fujian (1985\u20132002), Zhejiang (2002\u20132007), and Shanghai (2007).[24] Xi held posts in the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and became the president of the Party School in Fuzhou in 1990. In 1997, he was named an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the CCP. However, of the 151 alternate members of the Central Committee elected at the 15th Party Congress, Xi received the lowest number of votes in favour, placing him last in the rankings of members, ostensibly due to his status as a princeling.[b][25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Xu, Xinyi (27 May 2013). \u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73\"\u5bb6\u98a8\"\u63ed\u79d8 \u9f4a\u5fc3\u81ea\u8ff0\u8207\u7fd2\u4ef2\u52db\u5a5a\u59fb\u5f80\u4e8b [Xi Jinping's \"family traditions\" are unmasked: Qi Xin's autobiographical account of her marriage to Xi Zhongxun]. *People's Daily* (in Traditional Chinese).

He has also enacted or promoted a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly with regard to China's relations with the U.S., the nine-dash line in the South China Sea, the Sino-Indian border dispute, and the political status of Taiwan.

He was ranked above Li Keqiang, an indication that he was going to succeed Hu Jintao as China's next leader. In addition, Xi also held the first secretary of the CCP's Central Secretariat. This assessment was further supported at the 11th National People's Congress in March 2008, when Xi was elected as vice president of the PRC.[38] Following his elevation, Xi held a broad range of portfolios. He was put in charge of the comprehensive preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as being the central government's leading figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs. In addition, he also became the new president of the Central Party School of the CCP, its cadre-training and ideological education wing. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Xi visited disaster areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA few months before his ascendancy to the party leadership, Xi disappeared from official media coverage and cancelled meeting with foreign officials for several weeks beginning on 1 September 2012, causing rumors.[8] He then reappeared on 15 September.[59] On 15 November 2012, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee of the CCP. This made him, informally, the paramount leader and the first to be born after the founding of the PRC. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Li, Cheng. \"Xi Jinping's Inner Circle (Part 2: Friends from Xi's Formative Years)\" (PDF). *Hoover Institution*. pp.\u00a06\u201322.

He eventually took over as provincial Party Committee secretary after several months as acting governor, occupying a top provincial office for the first time in his career. In 2002, he was elected a full member of the 16th Central Committee, marking his ascension to the national stage. While in Zhejiang, Xi presided over reported growth rates averaging 14% per year.[30] His career in Zhejiang was marked by a tough and straightforward stance against corrupt officials. This earned him a name in the national media and drew the attention of China's top leaders.[31] Between 2004 and 2007, Li Qiang acted as Xi's chief of staff through his position as secretary-general of the Zhejiang Party Committee, where they both developed close ties.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 2012, *Bloomberg News* reported that members of Xi's extended family have substantial business interests, although there was no evidence he had intervened to assist them.[474] The *Bloomberg* website was blocked in mainland China in response to the article.[475] Since Xi embarked on an anti-corruption campaign, *The New York Times* reported members of his family were selling their corporate and real estate investments beginning in 2012.[476] Relatives of highly placed Chinese officials, including seven current and former senior leaders of the Politburo of the CCP, have been named in the Panama Papers, including Deng Jiagui,[477] Xi's brother-in-law. Deng had two shell companies in the British Virgin Islands while Xi was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, but they were dormant by the time Xi became general secretary of the CCP in November 2012.[478]\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLater, his mother was forced to publicly denounce his father, as he was paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution. His father was later imprisoned in 1968 when Xi was aged 15. Without the protection of his father, Xi was sent to work in Liangjiahe Village, Wen'anyi, Yanchuan County, Yan'an, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong's Down to the Countryside Movement.[14] He worked as the party secretary of Liangjiahe, where he lived in a cave house.[15] According to people who knew him, this experience led him to feel affinity with the rural poor.[16] After a few months, unable to stand rural life, he ran away to Beijing. He was arrested during a crackdown on deserters from the countryside and sent to a work camp to dig ditches, but he later returned to the village. He then spent a total of seven years there.[17][18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Muscatine, Iowa house where Xi stayed with an American family during a 1985 agricultural visit to the United States.

This visit included meeting with then U.S. president Barack Obama at the White House[57] and then vice president Joe Biden; and stops in California and Iowa, where he met with the family that previously hosted him during his 1985 tour as a Hebei provincial official.[58]\n\n\n\n### Accession to top posts[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Generations of Chinese leadership and Succession of power in China\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

He is a direct descendant of the Ming dynasty general Hu Zongxian, known for fighting Japanese pirates.[5] His branch of the family migrated from Jixi County, Anhui to Taizhou during his grandfather's generation. Though his father owned a small tea trading business in Taizhou, the family was relatively poor. His mother was a teacher and died when he was 7, and he was raised by an aunt. Hu's father was denounced during the Cultural Revolution, an event that (together with his relatively humble origins) apparently had a deep effect upon Hu, who diligently tried to clear his father's name.[6]\n\n\nHe joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in April 1964. That year he graduated from Tsinghua University after studying hub hydropower stations at the Water Conservancy Engineering Department. He worked as a political counselor at Tsinghua.[7]:\u200a107 In July 1965, Hu began work as an engineer.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Hu Jintao**[a] (born 21 December 1942) is a Chinese retired politician who served as the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from 2002 to 2012, the president of China from 2003 to 2013, and chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) from 2004 to 2012. He was a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, China's *de facto* top decision-making body, from 1992 to 2012.

Deng also proposed considering another candidate for a further future transition, preferably someone under fifty to represent the next generation of leaders.[29] Song Ping, as the organization chief, recommended Hu as an ideal candidate for the prospect of a future leader. As a result, shortly before his 50th birthday, Hu Jintao became the youngest (aged 49 in October 1992) member of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, and one of the youngest PSC members since the Communist Party assumed power in 1949.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Ewing, Richard Daniel. \"Hu Jintao: The Making of a Chinese General Secretary.\" *China Quarterly* 173 (2003): 17\u201334. online\n* Lam, Willy. *Chinese politics in the Hu Jintao era: New leaders, new challenges* (Routledge, 2016).\n* Miller, Alice. \"Hu Jintao and the Sixth Plenum\". *China Leadership Monitor* 20 (2007): 1\u201312. online\n* Nathan, Andrew J.; Gilley, Bruce (March 2003). *China's new rulers: the secret files*.

His tenure was characterized by collective leadership and consensus-based rule.[2] These traits made Hu a rather enigmatic figure in the public eye. His administration was known for its focus more on technocratic competence than persona.[3] At the end of his tenure after ten years in office, Hu won praise for retiring voluntarily from all positions. He was succeeded by Xi Jinping.

This made Hu effectively the number-one figure in the vast, restive region. A number of Tibetans have long been opposed to government policy in the region. Unrest and ethnic conflict were brewing, particularly anti-Han sentiments among segments of ethnic Tibetan society. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bo, Zhiyue. \"Hu Jintao and the CCP's ideology: A historical perspective\". *Journal of Chinese Political Science* 9.2 (2004): 27\u201345. online\n* Cabestan, Jean-Pierre. \"China's foreign-and security-policy decision-making processes under Hu Jintao.\" *Journal of Current Chinese Affairs* 38.3 (2009): 63\u201397. online\n* Chai, Winberg. \"The ideological paradigm shifts of China's world views: From Marxism-Leninism-Maoism to the pragmatism-multilateralism of the Deng-Jiang-Hu era\". *Asian Affairs* 30.3 (2003): 163\u2013175.\n* Cheng, Tun-Jen, et al. eds. *China Under Hu Jintao: Opportunities, Dangers, and Dilemmas* (2005)\n* David, Daniel K. *Modern World Leaders: Hu Jintao* (Chelsea, 2008)\n* Ding, Yijiang. \"Consolidation of the PRC's leadership succession system from Hu Jintao to Xi Jinping\". *China Report* 51.1 (2015): 49\u201365.\n* Fewsmith, Joseph. \"China under Hu Jintao\". *China Leadership Monitor* 14 (Spring 2005) online.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Liu, Melinda.

On 12 April 2008, Hu Jintao met with Taiwan's vice president-elect Vincent Siew in the latter's role as chairman of the Cross-strait Common Market Foundation during the Boao Forum for Asia. On 28 May 2008, Hu met with KMT chairman Wu Po-hsiung, the first meeting between the heads of the CCP and the KMT as ruling parties. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** Lewis, Joanna I.

Additionally, Wen Jiabao became the premier. However, Jiang was re-elected to the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission, the top military body, despite Hu taking over as the general secretary.[32] Jiang resigned as CMC chairman in September 2004, his last official post.

Hu was also put in charge of the ideological work of the CCP. Although Hu was considered heir apparent to Jiang, he always took great care to ensure that Jiang be at the center of the spotlight. In late 1998, Hu promoted Jiang's unpopular movement of the \"Three Stresses\"\u00a0\u2013 \"stress study, stress politics, and stress healthy trends\"\u00a0\u2013 giving speeches to promote it. In 2001, he publicized Jiang's Three Represents theory, which Jiang hoped to place himself on the same level as other Marxist theoreticians.[30] In 1998, Hu became vice president, and Jiang wanted Hu to play a more active role in foreign affairs.

Jiang appeared casual in front of Western media, and gave an unprecedented interview with Mike Wallace of CBS in 2000 at Beidaihe. He would often use foreign languages in front of the camera; once, he gave a 40-minute speech entirely in Russian.[66] In an encounter with Hong Kong reporter Sharon Cheung in 2000 regarding the central government's apparent \"imperial order\" of supporting Tung Chee-hwa to seek a second term as Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Jiang scolded the Hong Kong journalists as \"too simple, sometimes naive\" in English.[67]\n\n\n\n### \"Three Represents\"[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Three Represents\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Family | * Wang Yeping (wife)\n* Jiang Mianheng (son)\n |\n| Related | * Shanghai clique\n* *The Man Who Changed China*\n* Toad worship\n* *World Economic Herald*\n* Death and state funeral\n |\n| * **![](image) Category:Jiang Zemin**\n |\n| Offices and distinctions\n |\n| --- |\n| | Party political offices\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded\u00a0byRui Xingwen\n |  **Secretary of the CCP Shanghai Committee** 1987\u20131989\n | Succeeded\u00a0byZhu Rongji\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byZhao Ziyang\n |  **General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party** 1989\u20132002\n | Succeeded\u00a0byHu Jintao\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byDeng Xiaoping\n |  **Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Chinese Communist Party** 1989\u20132004\n |\n| Political offices\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byZhang Ting\n |  **Minister of the Electronics Industry** 1983\u20131985\n | Succeeded\u00a0byLi Tieying\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byWang Daohan\n |  **Mayor of Shanghai** 1985\u20131988\n | Succeeded\u00a0byZhu Rongji\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byYang Shangkun\n |  **President of the People's Republic of China** 1993\u20132003\n | Succeeded\u00a0byHu Jintao\n |\n| Diplomatic posts\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the first meeting of the new CCP Politburo Standing Committee, after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, Jiang criticized the previous period as \"hard on the economy, soft on politics\" and advocated increasing political thought work.[40] Anne-Marie Brady wrote that \"Jiang Zemin was a long time political cadre with a nose for ideological work and its importance. This meeting marked the beginning of a new era in propaganda and political thought work in China.\" Soon after, the Central Propaganda Department was given more resources and power, \"including the power to go in to the propaganda-related work units and cleanse the ranks of those who had been supportive of the democracy movement.\"[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeginning in July 2011, false reports of Jiang's death began circulating on the news media outside of mainland China and on the internet.[94][95] While Jiang may indeed have been ill and receiving treatment, the rumors were denied by official sources.[96] On 9 October 2011, Jiang made his first public appearance since his premature obituary in Beijing at a celebration to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution.[97] Jiang reappeared at the 18th Party Congress in October 2012, and took part in the 65th Anniversary banquet of the founding of the People's Republic of China in October 2014. At the banquet he sat next to Xi Jinping, who had then succeeded Hu Jintao as CCP general secretary. In September 2015, Jiang attended the parade celebrating 70 years since end of World War II; there, Jiang again sat next to Xi Jinping and Hu Jintao.[98] He appeared on 29 May 2017 at Shanghai Technology University.[99]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder Jiang's leadership, China experienced substantial economic growth with the continuation of market reforms. The returning of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997 and of Macau from Portugal in 1999, and entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, were landmark moments of his era.[3] China also witnessed improved relations with the outside world, while the Communist Party maintained its tight control over the state. Jiang faced criticism over human rights abuses, including the crackdown on the Falun Gong movement. His contributions to party doctrine, known as the \"Three Represents\", were written into the CCP constitution in 2002. Jiang gradually vacated his official leadership titles from 2002 to 2005, being succeeded in these roles by Hu Jintao, although he and his political faction continued to influence affairs until much later. In 2022, Jiang died in Shanghai.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Deba R.

But it is not that of Vice President Hu Jintao [...] Rather, it is a new era of President Jiang Zemin, who has just stepped down as the Party's general secretary.\"[80] Early in the 2003 SARS crisis, Jiang remained conspicuously silent, and observers were divided over whether it signified his waning influence, or respect for Hu.[85] It has been argued that the institutional arrangements created by the 16th Congress left Jiang in a position where he could not exercise much influence.[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBorn in Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Jiang joined the CCP while he was in college. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he received training at the Stalin Automobile Works in Moscow in the 1950s, later returning to Shanghai in 1962 to serve in various institutes, later being sent between 1970 and 1972 to Romania as part of an expert team to establish machinery manufacturing plants in the country. After 1979, he was appointed as the vice chair of two commissions by vice premier Gu Mu to oversee the newly established special economic zones (SEZs). He became the vice minister of the newly established Ministry of Electronics Industry and a member of the CCP Central Committee in 1982.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Ji\u0101ng Z\u00e9m\u00edn |\n| Wade\u2013Giles | Chiang1 Tz\u00ea2-min2 |\n| IPA | [t\u0255ja\u0301\u014b\u00a0ts\u0264\u030c.mi\u030cn] |\n| Yue: Cantonese |\n| Yale Romanization | G\u014dng Jaahk-m\u00e0ahn |\n| Jyutping | Gong1 Zaak6-maan4 |\n| IPA | [k\u0254\u02d0\u014b\u02e5\u00a0tsa\u02d0k\u031a\u02e8.ma\u02d0n\u02e9] |\n| Southern Min |\n| Hokkien POJ | Kang Tik-b\u00een |\n\n |\n|  |\n|  |\n| Central institution membership\n\n* 1989\u20132002: 13th, 14th, 15th Politburo Standing Committee\n* 1989\u20132005: 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th Central Military Commission\n* 1987\u20132002: 13th, 14th, 15th Politburo\n* 1983\u20132002: 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th Central Committee\n* 1988\u20132008: 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th National People's Congress\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nOther political offices held\n\n* 1987\u201389: Communist Party Committee Secretary, Shanghai\n* 1984\u201387: Mayor, Shanghai\n* 1983\u201385: Minister, Ministry of Electronic Industries\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Paramount Leader of  the People's Republic of China**\n* **\u2190** Deng Xiaoping\n* Hu Jintao **\u2192**\n |\n|  |\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Jiang in 1962\nIn 1962, he returned to Shanghai and became the deputy director of the Shanghai Electric Research Institute.

Foreigners were not invited to attend official mourning activities.[123]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jiang's inscription engraved on a stone in his hometown, Yangzhou\nThe policies of his successors, Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, have widely been seen as efforts to address perceived imbalances and move away from a sole focus on economic growth toward a broader view of development which incorporates non-economic factors such as health and the environment.[124]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012, Jiang's position in the protocol sequence of leaders retreated; while he was often seated next to Xi Jinping at official events, his name was often reported after all standing members of the Communist Party's Politburo.[100] Jiang reappeared at the 19th Party Congress on 18 October 2017.[101] He appeared on 29 July 2019 at the funeral of former premier Li Peng.[102][103][104] He also attended the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China mass parade in October 2019, marking his last public appearance prior to his death.[105] He did not attend the 20th Party Congress in October 2022.[106]\n\n\n\n## Family and personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n15th Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (1997\u20132002)\n |\n| --- |\n| Standing Committee | 1.

Cook and Lemish state this was because Jiang was worried that the popular new religious movement was \"quietly infiltrating the CCP and state apparatus.\"[72] On 20 July, security forces arrested thousands of Falun Gong organizers they identified as leaders.[73] The persecution that followed was characterized a nationwide campaign of propaganda, as well as the large-scale arbitrary imprisonment and coercive reeducation of Falun Gong organizers, sometimes resulting in death due to mistreatment in detention.[74][75][76]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Shanghai clique\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1985, Jiang became mayor of Shanghai. Jiang received mixed reviews as mayor. Many of his critics dismissed him as a \"flower pot\", a Chinese term for someone who only seems useful, but actually gets nothing done.[20] Many credited Shanghai's growth during the period to Zhu Rongji.[21] Jiang was an ardent believer, during this period, in Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms. In an attempt to curb student discontent in 1986, Jiang recited the Gettysburg Address in English in front of a group of student protesters.[22][23][24]\n\n\nAt the 13th National Congress of the CCP held in October 1987, Jiang was promoted from mayor to Shanghai party secretary, the most powerful position in the city, reporting directly to the central government.[25] He also joined the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, in accordance with customs for party secretaries of major cities.[25]\n\n\n\n### Tiananmen Square protests[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJiang was appointed as the mayor of Shanghai in 1985, later being promoted to its Communist Party secretary, as well as a member of the CCP Politburo, in 1987. Jiang came to power unexpectedly as a compromise candidate following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, when he replaced Zhao Ziyang as CCP general secretary after Zhao was ousted for his support for the student movement. As the involvement of the \"Eight Elders\" in Chinese politics steadily declined,[1] Jiang consolidated his hold on power to become the \"paramount leader\" in the country during the 1990s.[b] Urged by Deng Xiaoping's southern tour in 1992, Jiang officially introduced the term \"socialist market economy\" in his speech during the 14th CCP National Congress held later that year, which accelerated \"opening up and reform\".[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

He went on to hold high office under both Mao Zedong and later Deng Xiaoping; from 1945 to 1965 he was Director of the General Office and from 1945 to 1956 Secretary\u2013General of the Central Military Commission (CMC). In these positions, Yang oversaw much of the day-to-day running of government and Party affairs, both political and military, amassing a great deal of bureaucratic power by controlling things like the flow of documents, the keeping of records, and the approval and allocation of funds.[2] Purged, arrested and imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, he spent 12 years in prison but staged a comeback in 1978, becoming a key ally of Deng, serving as Mayor of Guangzhou (1979\u201381), and returning to the CMC as Secretary\u2013General and also Vice Chairman (1981\u201389), before assuming the presidency.[2]\n\n\nOne of the earliest supporters of Chinese economic reform, Yang justified it with references to Vladimir Lenin and the New Economic Policy. However, he strongly opposed any form of political reform, and, despite his own suffering during the Cultural Revolution, actively defended the image and record of Mao. Together with his half-brother, General Yang Baibing, Yang Shangkun effectively controlled the PLA for the entire 1980s and into the early 1990s. Despite his initial hesitation, he went on to play a leading role in crushing the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and was actually the one who planned and supervised the operations to clear the square and surrounding streets. Yang's downfall came in 1993, when he failed in his attempts to undermine the new leadership of Jiang Zemin and to retain control of the PLA, and was forced to retire by a coalition of Party elders, including Deng himself.\n\n\n\n\n## Early political and military activities[edit]\n\n\nYang was born to a land-owning family[3] in Shuangjiang, Tongnan County, near the city of Chongqing in Sichuan, and studied at Chengdu Higher Normal School and its affiliated secondary school in 1920\u201325, and then returned to Chongqing. His older brother, Yang Yingong[4] was one of the founding Executive Committee members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Sichuan, and influenced Yang Shangkun's ideological orientation. After joining the Communist Youth League in 1925, and the CCP in 1926, he enrolled in Shanghai University, where he studied politics.[5] Later in 1927 Yang traveled to the Soviet Union and enrolled at the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University, where he studied Marxist theory and techniques of political organization and mobilization.[2][3]\n\n\nYang was a member of a group of Chinese students who studied in Moscow and returned to China to take a leading role in the CCP, later known as the 28 Bolsheviks.[5] The Comintern sent Yang back to China to assist and support other pro-Comintern CCP leaders, including Bo Gu, Wang Ming, and Zhang Guotao, but Yang and some of the other 28 Bolsheviks, including Ye Jianying, Wang Jiaxiang and Zhang Wentian supported Mao Zedong instead. On his return from Moscow in 1931, Yang Shangkun started his military career in the Chinese Red Army, serving as Director of the Political Department in the 1st Red Army and moving around different battle areas under the command of Zhu De and Zhou Enlai. In January 1934, he was appointed Political Commissar of the 3rd Red Army, commanded by Peng Dehuai.[6]\n\n\n\n## Second Sino\u2013Japanese War and Chinese Civil War[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Second Sino\u2013Japanese War Yang Shangkun was Deputy Secretary of the CCP North China Bureau and worked with Liu Shaoqi behind the Japanese lines. In January 1939, Yang became Secretary of the North China Bureau and worked with Zhu De and Peng Dehuai to cooperate with the military operations of the Eighth Route Army, including the Hundred Regiments Campaign. In 1941, Yang returned to Yan'an and worked as personal aide to Mao. In 1945, he became the Director of the General Office of the Party, as well as Secretary\u2013General of the Central Military Commission, that was chaired by Mao himself. In these capacities, he was responsible for much of the day-to-day administration of the Party's military and political work, and carried out this duty with much success.[2]\n\n\nIn the subsequent Chinese Civil War 1949, Yang was Commander of the \"*Central Security Force*\" protecting the Party Center, and, in his roles as Director of the General Office and Secretary\u2013General of the CMC, played a significant role in the ultimate Communist victory and the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.[3]\n\n\n\n## People's Republic[edit]\n\n\nAfter the founding of the PRC in October 1949 and until the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Yang Shangkun was one of very few CCP leaders who worked closely with Mao Zedong at Zhongnanhai on a daily basis. As the Director of the General Office and Secretary\u2013General of the CMC, he oversaw much of the actual day-to-day work of most party activities and military affairs.[3] On the eve of the Cultural Revolution Yang was identified as a supporter of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, and was purged as a counter-revolutionary.[7] After being ejected from the Communist Party and removed from all positions, Yang was persecuted by Red Guards, who accused Yang of planting a covert listening device to spy on Mao, the same accusation shared by Deng Xiaoping.\n\n\nYang remained in prison until Mao died and Deng Xiaoping rose to power, in 1978. After Deng gained control of the military he recalled Yang, raised him to the position of general, and gave Yang the responsibility of reforming China's army, which Deng considered as larger than necessary and engaged in too many non-military activities. Deng raised Yang to the position of Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission in order to give Yang the authority to complete these reforms (Deng was chairman). In 1982 Yang was also appointed as a full member of the Politburo.[8]\n\n\nYang had a close friendship with Deng and shared many of Deng's long-term economic goals, but was far less enthusiastic about the agenda of political liberalization promoted by other senior leaders favored by Deng, including Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang, Wan Li, and Hu Qili. Yang justified his support of economic reforms by referencing Vladimir Lenin and the New Economic Policy, and he emphasized that the Communist Party should still enjoy overall control of the economy, even in private businesses, through the system of Party committees in all enterprises. He also always defended Mao Zedong as a great and historic leader, despite his own suffering at the hands of radical Maoists.\n\n\nIn the early 1980s, Yang explicitly backed the efforts of a foreign China historian, Harrison Salisbury, to compile an account of the Long March by conducting extensive interviews with surviving Long March participants. The resulting book, *Long March: The Untold Story*, has been praised by China scholars as an excellent synthesis of first-hand oral sources. Within China, many Chinese veterans asked why it took a foreigner to produce such a book.[9]\n\n\n\n## Presidency[edit]\n\n\nFile:Bush and Yang 5-1987.jpgYang with Vice President George H. W. Bush aboard the USS *Sequoia* during his visit to the United States in 1987\nIn 1988, Yang was appointed President of the People's Republic of China replacing Li Xiannian. Under the conventions of the 1982 Constitution, the president's role was largely symbolic,[8] with formal executive power wielded by the General Secretary of the Communist Party and the Premier of the State Council. In practice, party and state leaders still deferred to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who, however, was not all-powerful, as he still had to compromise on some policies with other party elders such as Chen Yun and Li Xiannian.\n\n\nYang's role during the Tiananmen protests of 1989 caused a fundamental shift in China's political structure. Yang was at first sympathetic to the students and sided with General Secretary Zhao Ziyang in supporting them. As the Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Central Military Commission, he even praised Zhao's position by claiming that Zhao \"Ziyang\u2019s notion of pacifying the student movement through democracy and law is good and seems quite workable right now.\" Zhao's position was contested by Premier Li Peng and Party elder Li Xiannian, who wanted to use force to suppress the student demonstrations and engaged in an internal power struggle with Zhao to convince other senior leaders of their position.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter the hardliners gained the upper hand, Yang changed his position and supported the use of force to suppress student protestors. In May 1989 Yang appeared on Chinese television, where he denounced the student demonstrations as \"anarchy\" and defended the imposition of martial law on several areas of Beijing affected by the protests. Yang then mobilized and planned the suppression of the demonstrators, an operation in which several hundred protesters were killed on 4 June and subsequent days.[8] Yang's nephew, Yang Jianhua, commanded the highly disciplined 27th Group Army, which was brought into Beijing from Hebei to suppress the demonstrators.\n\n\n\n![](image)Yang (first row, fifth from right) at Kim Il Sung's 80th birthday celebrations in 1992\nThroughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Yang Shangkun was hugely influential within the People's Liberation Army. Yang and his younger half-brother, Yang Baibing, purged China's military of any officers who had not sufficiently supported the government's violent crackdown on students. Yang then began an organized attempt to fill as many senior military positions as possible with his supporters, generating an attitude of resentment among other military elders, who accused Yang of attempting to dominate the army and possibly challenge Deng's authority by developing a \"Yang family clique\". When Yang resisted the rise of Jiang Zemin (who had been the Party secretary of Shanghai), whom Deng began to groom to succeed him as paramount leader, party elders, including Deng himself forced Yang to retire in 1993, along with some of his family.[7]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Voice of America, before Yang Shangkun died in 1998, he allegedly told army doctor Jiang Yanyong that the crackdown on 4 June had been the most serious mistake committed by Li Peng and the Communist Party in its history, a mistake that Yang believed he could not correct, but which he believed would eventually be corrected.[10]\n\n\nYang died on 14 September 1998, aged 91. His official obituary described him as \"a great proletarian revolutionary, a statesman, a military strategist, a staunch Marxist, an outstanding leader of the party, the state, and the people's army.\"[7]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1929, he married Li Bozhao, a woman who participated in the Long March alongside Yang. They had three sons.[11]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Politics of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"\u65cf\u8c31\u5e2e\u5927\u5fd9\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6768\u5c1a\u6606\u8bde\u8fb0\u65e5\u4e3a8\u67083\u65e5--\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u65b0\u95fb--\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u65b0\u95fb-\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51\".
