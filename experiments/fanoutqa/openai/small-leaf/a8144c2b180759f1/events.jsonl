He served as a legislator in the Legislative Yuan from 1999 to 2010, and as Mayor of Tainan from 2010 to 2017, prior to taking office as premier of Taiwan.[5]\n\n\nOn 24 November 2018, he announced his intention to resign from the premiership after the Democratic Progressive Party suffered a major defeat in local elections, and left office on 14 January 2019 after the swearing-in of his successor Su Tseng-chang.[6][7] Lai mounted a challenge against Tsai in the 2019 Democratic Progressive Party presidential primary and after defeat, served as the running mate of President Tsai Ing-wen in the 2020 Taiwan presidential election in which the tandem was victorious.[8][9] In April 2023, Lai was nominated by the DPP as their presidential candidate for the 2024 Taiwan presidential election.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Wanli, a rural coastal town in northern Taipei County (now New Taipei City) on 6 October 1959, Lai underwent schooling in Taipei City and studied at both National Cheng Kung University in Tainan and National Taiwan University in Taipei, where he specialized in rehabilitation.[10] Lai then studied at the Harvard School of Public Health for a Master's degree in Public Health,[10] followed by an internship at National Cheng Kung University Hospital. He became an expert on spinal cord damage and served as a national consultant for such injuries.[10]\n\n\n\n## Legislative career[edit]\n\n\nAfter serving as part of the support team for Chen Ding-nan's unsuccessful electoral bid for Governor of Taiwan Province in 1994,[11] Lai decided to enter politics himself. The next opportunity for election to a national body was the 1996 National Assembly, with Lai winning a seat representing Tainan City. Lai then joined the New Tide faction and stood as a candidate in the 1998 Legislative Yuan election, representing the Democratic Progressive Party in the second ward of Tainan City.[12][10] He was successful in this election, and subsequently was reelected three times in 2001, 2004, and 2008. In total he served 11 years as a legislator, and was selected as Taiwan's \"Best Legislator\" four times in a row by Taipei-based NGO Citizen Congress Watch.[13]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Tainan (2010–2017)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2010 Taiwanese local elections and 2014 Taiwanese local elections\n\n![](image)Lai as Mayor of Tainan, 2017.\nWith the 2010 reorganization of the municipalities in Taiwan, Tainan City and Tainan County were amalgamated into a single municipality, called Tainan. After successfully being selected in the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) primaries in January 2010,[14] Lai stood as the DPP candidate for the mayoral election on 27 November 2010, gaining 60.41% to defeat Kuomintang candidate Kuo Tien-tsai.[15][16] He took office on 25 December 2010.\n\n\nAs a result of his strong showing in the mayoral election coupled with his relative youth and his control of the DPP heartland city of Tainan, Lai was considered to be a potential candidate for a presidential run in 2016.[17] In 2013 an opinion poll ranked Lai as the most popular of the 22 city and county heads in Taiwan, with an approval rating of 87%.[18]\n\n\nLai made on 5 June 2014 a visit to the city of Shanghai to assist an exhibition of art by the late Taiwanese painter Tan Ting-pho and met politicians of the Chinese Communist Party.[19][20]\n\n\nLai stood for reelection on 29 November 2014 against Huang Hsiu-shuang of the Kuomintang. His opponent was considered to have such an uphill task in the DPP stronghold that she rode a black horse through the streets of Tainan as an election stunt; a hopeful allusion to her status as a \"dark horse\".[21] Lai, on the other hand, did not plan many campaign activities, choosing to focus on mayoral duties.[22] He eventually won the election by 45 percentage points,[23][24] the largest margin of victory in any of the municipal races in the election.[25]\n\n\nLai stepped down as Mayor in September 2017, after being appointed to the Premiership.[26] He was succeeded in acting capacity by Lee Meng-yen.[27]\n\n\n\n## Premier (2017–2019)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lai cabinet\n\n![](image)Premier Lai Ching-te led the cabinet during the swearing-in ceremony\n![](image)William Lai (center) with Ethan Tu (left) and Huang Wei-cher (right), in January 2019.\nIn September 2017, Premier Lin Chuan tendered his resignation to President Tsai Ing-wen, which was reluctantly accepted. A recent poll showed Lin's approve rating to be a mere 28.7%, with 6 in 10 respondents dissatisfied with the performance of his cabinet.[28] On 5 September, President Tsai announced at a press conference that Lai would become the country's next head of the Executive Yuan.[29]\n\n\nLai took office on 8 September as the 49th Premier of the Republic of China.[30] Following Lai's appointment as premier, Tsai's approval ratings reached 46%, rebounding by more than 16 points since August.[31] Lai made his first appearance as premier at the Legislative Yuan on 26 September, where he stated \"I am a political worker who advocates Taiwan independence\" but that \"We are already an independent sovereign nation called the Republic of China. We don't need a separate declaration of independence\".[32][33] Lai has appeared to have moderated his position on Taiwanese independence particularly when he proposed the idea of \"being close to China while loving Taiwan\" in June 2017.[34] He also expressed no desire to run against Tsai Ing-wen in the 2020 presidential election.[35] On 28 September, the New Party called on the KMT to join it in filing a formal complaint against the Premier for sedition.[36]\n\n\nIn October 2017, it was reported that Lai had garnered the approval of 68.8 percent of respondents in a survey, while 23 percent expressed dissatisfaction.[37] However, critics say that his popularity may not last, due to his rapid reversal of his position on the issue of Taiwanese independence.[38] However, on 20 October, Lai in response to General Secretary Xi Jinping's comments on the one China policy and the 1992 consensus at the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Lai said that the Taiwanese government, following the directives of Tsai Ing-wen, would fulfill its promise of not changing the status quo between the two neighbors and not ceding before pressure from Beijing, which comes in the form of military intimidation and an international blockade.[39]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Lai tendered his resignation to the president, after the ruling DPP was trounced in local elections.[40] Lai agreed to remain in office to help stabilize the government until the general budget was cleared by the Legislative Yuan in January 2019.[41][42] Lai's cabinet resigned on 11 January 2019 and Su Tseng-chang was appointed as new premier.[43][44]\n\n\n\n## First presidential campaign (2019)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2019 Democratic Progressive Party presidential primary and 2020 Taiwanese presidential election\n\nOn 18 March 2019, Lai Ching-te registered to run in the Democratic Progressive Party presidential primary, saying that he could shoulder the responsibility of leading Taiwan in defending itself from being annexed by China.[45] This is the first time in Taiwanese history where a serious primary challenge has been mounted against a sitting president.[46] The results of the DPP's primary poll released on 13 June shown that Tsai defeated Lai by winning 35.67 percent of the vote over Lai's 27.48 percent, officially becoming the DPP's presidential candidate for the 2020 election.[47]\n\n\nIn November 2019, Lai accepted president Tsai Ing-wen's offer to become her running mate for the 2020 presidential election.[48] Tsai secured over 57% of the ballot, winning a record 8.17 million votes in the election and began her second term in 2020.[49][50]\n\n\n\n## Vice presidency and second presidential campaign (2020–2024)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lai exchanging gifts with Palaun President Surangel Whipps Jr. (left) on an official visit to Palau in November 2022\nDuring his vice presidency, Lai served as president Tsai Ing-wen's special envoy to Honduras for president Xiomara Castro's inauguration in January 2022.[51] After the assassination of former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, he made a private trip to Tokyo to pay his respects and became Taiwan's most senior official to visit Japan in five decades.[52] In November 2022, Lai led representatives of Taiwan's travel agencies and industry associations to Palau to foster collaborations between the two countries.[53]\n\n\nIn November 2022, president Tsai Ing-wen resigned as leader of DPP after the party's heavy losses in local elections.[54] Lai officially registered as a candidate for the DPP chair election in December.[55] Since Lai was the only candidate running, he became the new chairman of the DPP in 2023.[56][57] In March 2023, Lai registered as the only person to run in the DPP's 2024 presidential primary and was officially nominated by the ruling party in April.[58][59]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** Taiwan\n2. **^** \"Lai bids farewell to Tainan, names Lee Meng-yen as acting mayor\". *Focus Taiwan*. 6 September 2017.

He has been the incumbent mayor of New Taipei since 25 December 2018.[2] Previously, he served as Director-General of the National Police Agency from 2006 to 2008 and as acting mayor of New Taipei City from October 2015 to January 2016. He is Kuomintang's official candidate for the 2024 Taiwanese presidential elections. He firstly joined the party during the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek.\n\n\n\n\n## Law enforcement career[edit]\n\n\nUpon his graduation from the Central Police University, Hou was sent to the Taipei City Police Department. Hou obtained his first leadership role, as captain of the Taipei criminal police, in 1980.[3] In 1992, he became an inspector at the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB), a division of the National Police Agency (NPA). Five years later, he led the rescue of the Alexander family.[4] In 1998 Hou was named second in command of the CIB. He was given the concurrent post of Taoyuan County police chief in 2001 and promoted within the NPA in 2003, becoming the leader of the CIB.[5] The next year, Hou was tasked with investigating the 3-19 shooting incident,[6] an assassination attempt on President Chen Shui-bian, a longtime friend.[7] He was named the director-general of the NPA in 2006, becoming the youngest leader of the police force at the time of his appointment.[8] During his tenure, the NPA was criticized for its inadequate response to the 2006 protests led by Shih Ming-teh.[9][10] Multiple Kuomintang politicians also wanted Hou to reopen the investigation on the 3-19 shooting incident. Arms dealer Tang Shou-yi, who had fled to Mainland China by August 2006, had recanted his confession, stating that it was coerced and therefore untrue.[11] Hou was named the president of Central Police University in 2008[12] and was replaced at the NPA by Wang Cho-chiun [zh].[13]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nHou originally joined the Kuomintang in 1975, but allowed his membership to lapse during his law enforcement career.[14][15] Hou was recruited to join the Democratic Progressive Party in 2002.[16] Eric Chu asked Hou to serve as deputy mayor of New Taipei in 2010,[17] and Hou rejoined the Kuomintang in 2013.[15] Hou served as deputy mayor alongside Lee Shu-chuan and Hsu Chih-chien who left office on 25 February 2014 and 30 June 2014, respectively.[18][19][20] Later, Chen Shen-hsien was appointed to the deputy mayorship.[21] Hou was promoted from his previous position as deputy mayor on 20 October 2015, as Chu prepared for the 2016 presidential election.[22] Chu lost the election to Tsai Ing-wen, and resumed mayoral duties on 18 January 2016.[23]\n\n\nHou resigned from the deputy mayorship on 28 February 2018, stating that he would contest the Kuomintang mayoral primary.[24][25] On 6 April 2018, the KMT announced that Hou had won the primary.[26][27]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2018 Kuomintang New Taipei City mayoral primary results[28] |\n| --- |\n| Candidates\n | Place\n | Results\n |\n| **Hou Yu-ih** | **Nominated** | **55.596%** |\n| Chou Hsi-wei | 2nd\n | 34.210%\n |\n| Ching Chieh-shou\n | 3rd\n | 10.194%\n |\n\n\n### 2018 New Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2018 New Taipei mayoralty election result\n\n\n| 2018 New Taipei City mayoral results[29][30] |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Su Tseng-chang | Template:DPP | 873,692\n | 42.85%\n |  |\n| 2 | **Hou Yu-ih** | ![](image) Kuomintang | 1,165,130\n | 57.15%\n | ![](image) |\n| **Total voters** | 　3,264,128\n |\n| **Valid votes** | 　2,038,822\n |\n| **Invalid votes** | 　50,305\n |\n| **Voter turnout** | 　62.46%\n |\n\n\n### 2022 New Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\nOn August 17, 2022, Hou confirmed that he would run for a second term as mayor of New Taipei.[31]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2022 New Taipei City mayoral results\n |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Lin Chia-lung | Template:DPP | 693,976\n | 37.58%\n |  |\n| 2 | **Hou Yu-ih** | ![](image) Kuomintang | 1,152,555\n | 62.42%\n | ![](image) |\n| **Total voters** | 　3,316,517\n |\n| **Valid votes** | 　1,877,186\n |\n| **Invalid votes** | 　30,655\n |\n| **Voter turnout** | 　56.60%\n |\n\n\n### 2024 presidential elections[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the 2024 presidential election, Hou was considered the favorite for the Kuomintang presidential primary.[32] He was drafted by the Kuomintang on 17 May 2023 to be its nominee for the presidency.[33][34]\n\n\nOn 15 November 2023, KMT and Taiwan People's Party leadership announced that they would field a single joint presidential ticket made up of Hou and TPP chairman Ko Wen-je. The order was to be determined by opinion polls and publicly announced on 18 November,[35] but the parties were unable to reach an agreement on that date, leaving the possibility of a joint ticket in doubt.[36]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHou was born on 7 June 1957, in Puzi, Chiayi County, where his family owned a pork stall. As a child Hou aided the family business by catching and butchering wild pigs.[3]\n\n\nHou's firstborn son Hou Ni-wei died on 15 May 1992, in a tour bus fire,[37][38][39] which killed 23 people.[40] He and his wife Jen Mei-ling raised three daughters, Hou Yu-fan, Hou Ni-chia, and Hou Yu-chia.[41][42]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Out of office as Mayor of New Taipei since 24 September 2023 for being the Kuomintang candidate in the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election\n2. **^** \"市長 侯友宜\". *New Taipei City Government* (in Chinese).
