Dunham asked Kirke to take on a supporting role in her debut film *Tiny Furniture*. Kirke and a number of other friends were called upon as a favour to Dunham since there was not enough money to pay professional actors.[*citation needed*] Although the film turned out to be profitable, Kirke received no payment.[24] Kirke reunited with Dunham in the HBO series *Girls*, appearing in all six seasons from 2011 to 2017 as the character Jessa Johansson. Kirke next had supporting roles in the dark comedy films *Ava's Possessions* and *The Little Hours*. In 2018, Kirke starred alongside her real-life sister Lola Kirke in Emma Forrest's film *Untogether*.
