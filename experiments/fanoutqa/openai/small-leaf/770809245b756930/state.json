The most recent to join the list were Leicester City (2015\u201316 champions) and before that, Nottingham Forest (1977\u201378) and Derby County (1971\u201372).\n\n\nFive teams have won the league title three seasons in a row: Huddersfield Town (1924\u20131926), Arsenal (1933\u20131935), Liverpool (1982\u20131984), Manchester United twice (1999\u20132001 & 2007\u20132009) and Manchester City (2021\u20132023).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeven teams have at some point held first or joint first place in the number of titles won: Preston North End (1889\u20131895), Sunderland (1893\u20131899 and 1936\u20131953), Aston Villa (1897\u20131953), Arsenal (1948\u20131976), Liverpool (1966\u20131971 and 1973\u20132011), Manchester United (1967\u20131971 and 2009\u2013) and Everton (1970\u20131971).\n\n\nEight teams have finished as runners up without ever finishing top: Bristol City (1906\u201307), Oldham Athletic (1914\u201315), Cardiff City (1923\u201324), Charlton Athletic (1936\u201337), Blackpool (1955\u201356), Queens Park Rangers (1975\u201376), Watford (1982\u201383) and Southampton (1983\u201384). Of these, Cardiff City came closest to winning the league, matching champions Huddersfield Town in points but losing out on goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded), the precursor to goal difference.\n\n\nTeams in **bold** compete in the Premier League as of the 2023\u201324 season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nManchester United have won twenty titles,[11] the most of any club.[12] United's rivals Liverpool are second with nineteen. Liverpool dominated during the 1970s and 1980s (winning eleven league titles between 1973 and 1990), while Manchester United dominated in the 1990s and 2000s under manager Sir Alex Ferguson (eleven league titles between 1993\nand 2009). Arsenal are third with thirteen titles, having dominated during the 1930s (five league titles between 1931 and 1938). Everton and Manchester City are joint-fourth with nine titles, of which seven of City's have been won in the 2010s and 2020s. Aston Villa (seven) and Sunderland (six) secured the majority of their titles before the 1920s. Chelsea (six) won the majority of their titles in the 21st century (between 2005 and 2017).\n\n\nHuddersfield Town, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City are the only sides to have won the league title in three consecutive seasons; no team has been crowned champion four seasons in a row.[13]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about men's English football league champions.

This resulted in a shift of power towards bigger clubs.[7] Financial considerations became an even bigger influence from 1992, when the teams then in the First Division defected to form the FA Premier League. This supplanted the Football League First Division as the highest level of football in England,[8] and due to a series of progressively larger television contracts, put unprecedented wealth into the hands of top flight clubs.[9] The first five champions in the Premier League era \u2013 Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United \u2013 had all won the title at least once prior to 1992. Leicester City were champions for the first time in 2016, becoming the first team to win the Premier League without having previously won the First Division. Other than inaugural league champions Preston North End, Ipswich Town remain the only club to win the top flight division at their first ever attempt.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| City /

It was not until 1931 that a Southern club were crowned champions, when Herbert Chapman's Arsenal secured the title.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![Scotland](image) Alex Ferguson |\n|

The player records section includes details of the club's leading goalscorers and those who have made most appearances in first-team competitions. It also records notable achievements by Manchester United players on the international stage, and the highest transfer fees paid and received by the club. The club's attendance records, both at Old Trafford, their home since 1910, and Maine Road, their temporary home from 1946 to 1949, are also included in the list.\n\n\nThe club currently holds the record for the most Premier League titles with 13, and the highest number of English top-flight titles with 20. The club's record appearance maker is Ryan Giggs, who made 963 appearances between 1991 and 2014, and the club's record goalscorer is Wayne Rooney, who scored 253 goals in 559 appearances between 2004 and 2017.\n\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** White, John D.

In 1925 the club signed Dixie Dean from Tranmere Rovers. In 1927\u201328, Dean set the record for top-flight league goals in a single season with 60 goals in 39 league games, which is a record that still stands. He helped Everton win their third League Championship that season.[10] However, Everton were relegated to the Second Division two years later during internal turmoil at the club. The club quickly rebounded and were promoted at the first attempt, while scoring a record number of goals in the Second Division. On return to the top flight in 1931\u201332, Everton wasted no time in reaffirming their status and won a fourth League Championship at the first opportunity.[11][12] Everton also won their second FA Cup in 1933 with a 3\u20130 win against Manchester City in the final. The era ended in 1938\u201339 with a fifth League Championship.[13][14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n157. **^** \"Everton Football Team 1986\u00a0\u2013 Everybody's Cheering The Blues\".

Goodison Park, like all major English football grounds since the recommendations of the Taylor Report were implemented, is now an all-seater and only holds just under 40,000, meaning it is unlikely that this attendance record will ever be broken at Goodison.[128] Everton's record transfer paid was to Swansea City for the Icelandic midfielder Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson for a sum of \u00a345m in 2017.[129] The sale of Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United the same year was for an initial sum of \u00a375m, the largest sum Everton has received for a player and then the largest transfer between two English clubs.[130]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Finishing positions in the top flight between 1955 and 2011\nEverton's second successful era started when Harry Catterick was made manager in 1961.
