Founded by Al Neuharth on September 15, 1982, the newspaper operates from Gannett's corporate headquarters in Tysons, Virginia.[6] Its newspaper is printed at 37 sites across the United States and at five additional sites internationally. The paper's dynamic design influenced the style of local, regional, and national newspapers worldwide through its use of concise reports, colorized images, informational graphics, and inclusion of popular culture stories, among other distinct features.[7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*USA Today* was first conceived on February 29, 1980, when a company task force known as \"Project NN\" met with then-chairman of Gannett, Al Neuharth, in Cocoa Beach, Florida. Early regional prototypes of *USA Today* included *East Bay Today*, an Oakland, California-based publication published in the late 1970s to serve as the morning edition of the *Oakland Tribune*, an afternoon newspaper which Gannett owned at the time.[13] On June 11, 1981, Gannett printed the first prototypes of the proposed publication. The two proposed design layouts were mailed to newsmakers and prominent leaders in journalism for review and feedback.[8][14] Gannett's board of directors approved the launch of the national newspaper, titled *USA Today*, on December 5, 1981. At launch, Neuharth was appointed president and publisher of the newspaper, adding those responsibilities to his existing position as Gannett's chief executive officer.[14][15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the fourth quarter of 1985, *USA Today* had become the second-largest newspaper in the United States, reaching a daily circulation of 1.4\u00a0million copies. Total daily readership of the paper by 1987 (according to Simmons Market Research Bureau statistics) had reached 5.5\u00a0million, the largest of any daily newspaper in the U.S. On May 6, 1986, *USA Today* began production of its international edition in Switzerland. *USA Today* operated at a loss for most of its first four years of operation, accumulating a total deficit of $233\u00a0million after taxes, according to figures released by Gannett in July 1987; the newspaper began turning its first profit in May 1987, six months ahead of Gannett corporate revenue projections.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n40. **^** \"OpenWager Partners with USA Today to Unveil USA Today Bingo Cruise\" (Press release).

Based in the Greater Los Angeles area city of El Segundo since 2018,[3] it is the sixth-largest newspaper by circulation in the United States, as well as the largest newspaper in the western United States.[4] Owned by Patrick Soon-Shiong and published by California Times, the paper has won more than 40 Pulitzer Prizes.[5][6][7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 1960s, the paper won four Pulitzer Prizes, more than its previous nine decades combined.\n\n\nWriting in 2013 about the pattern of newspaper ownership by founding families, *Times* reporter Michael Hiltzik said that:\n\n\n\n\n> The first generations bought or founded their local paper for profits and also social and political influence (which often brought more profits). Their children enjoyed both profits and influence, but as the families grew larger, the later generations found that only one or two branches got the power, and everyone else got a share of the money. Eventually the coupon-clipping branches realized that they could make more money investing in something other than newspapers. Under their pressure the companies went public, or split apart, or disappeared. That's the pattern followed over more than a century by the *Los Angeles Times* under the Chandler family.[17]\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting (2001\u20132025)\n |\n| --- |\n| * *Miami Herald* (2001)\n* *Wall Street Journal* (2002)\n* *Eagle-Tribune* (2003)\n* *Los Angeles Times* (2004)\n* *Star-Ledger* (2005)\n* *Times-Picayune* (2006)\n* *Oregonian* (2007)\n* *Washington Post* (2008)\n* *The New York Times* (2009)\n* *Seattle Times* (2010)\n* *The Tuscaloosa News* (2012)\n* *The Denver Post* (2013)\n* *The Boston Globe* (2014)\n* *The Seattle Times* (2015)\n* *Los Angeles Times* (2016)\n* *East Bay Times* (2017)\n* *The Press Democrat* (2018)\n* *Pittsburgh Post-Gazette* (2019)\n* *The Courier-Journal* (2020)\n* *The Star Tribune* (2021)\n* *Miami Herald* (2022)\n* *Los Angeles Times* (2023)\n* *Lookout Santa Cruz* (2024)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| * Complete list\n* (1985\u20132000)\n* (2001\u20132025)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe paper's early history and subsequent transformation was chronicled in an unauthorized history, *Thinking Big* (1977, ISBN\u00a00-399-11766-0), and was one of four organizations profiled by David Halberstam in *The Powers That Be* (1979, ISBN\u00a00-394-50381-3; 2000 reprint ISBN\u00a00-252-06941-2).
