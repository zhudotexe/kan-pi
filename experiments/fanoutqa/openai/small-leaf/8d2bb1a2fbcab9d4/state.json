For the first time, Jeff Bezos was listed as the top billionaire due to Amazon's rising stock price that resulted in one person's biggest one-year gain in wealth ($35 billion) since *Forbes* started tracking in 1987.[15] The U.S. had the most billionaires in the world, with 585, while China was catching up with 476 when including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan; it had 372 when excluding those three places.[15] Forbes excluded Al-Walid bin Talal and all other Saudi billionaires due to the absence of accurate wealth estimations as a result of the 2017\u201319 Saudi Arabian purge.[16]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn the 30th anniversary of the *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, for the fourth year in a row, Bill Gates was named the richest man in the world.[5] In 2017, there was a record of 2,043 people on the list, which is the first time over 2,000 people were listed. This included 195 newcomers of whom 76 were from China and 25 from the U.S.; there were 56 people under 40 and it had a record of 227 women.[17] The number of billionaires increased 13% to 2,043 from 1,810 in 2016; this was the biggest change in over 30 years of tracking billionaires globally.[5] Added together, the total net worth for 2017's billionaires was US$7.67\u00a0trillion, up from US$7.1\u00a0trillion in 2015.[5][18] This was the first time after 12 years that Carlos Slim was not within the top five. The U.S. had the most billionaires in the world, with a record of 565. China had 319 (not including Hong Kong, Taiwan or Macau), Germany had 114, and India had the fourth most with 101; India reached over 100 billionaires for its first time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| People | * *Forbes* list of billionaires\n* List of centibillionaires\n* Female billionaires\n* Richest royals\n* Wealthiest Americans\n* Wealthiest families\n |\n| Organizations | * Largest companies by revenue\n* Largest corporate profits and losses\n* Largest corporations by market capitalization\n* Largest financial services companies by revenue\n* Largest manufacturing companies by revenue\n* Largest software companies by revenue\n* Largest technology companies by revenue\n* Charities\n\t+ Philanthropists\n* Universities\n\t+ Endowment size\n\t+ Number of billionaire alumni\n |\n| Other | * Cities by number of billionaires\n* Countries by number of billionaires\n* Countries by total wealth\n* Countries by wealth inequality\n* Wealth inequality in the United States\n* Income inequality in the United States\n* Most expensive items\n\t+ by category\n* Wealthiest animals\n |\n\n |\n| Related | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSince stock prices fluctuate rapidly, an individual's true wealth and ranking at the time of publication may vary from their situation when the list was compiled.[7]\n\n\nWhen a living individual has dispersed his or her wealth to immediate family members it is included under a single listing (as a single \"family fortune\") provided that individual (the grantor) is still living. However, if a deceased billionaire's fortune has been dispersed, it will not appear as a single listing, and each recipient will only appear if his or her own total net worth is over a $Billion (his or her net worth will not be combined with family members')[7] Royal families and dictators that have their wealth contingent on a position are always excluded from these lists.[9]\n\n\n\n## Annual rankings[edit]\n\n\n\nThe rankings are published annually in March, so the net worths listed are snapshots taken at that time.

Preliminary surveys are sent to those who may qualify for the list. According to *Forbes*, they received three types of responses\u00a0\u2013 some people try to inflate their wealth, others cooperate but leave out details, and some refuse to answer any questions.[8] Business deals are then scrutinized and estimates of valuable assets\u00a0\u2013 land, homes, vehicles, artwork, etc.\u00a0\u2013 are made. Interviews are conducted to vet the figures and improve the estimate of an individual's holdings. Finally, positions in a publicly traded stock are priced to market on a date roughly a month before publication. Privately held companies are priced by the prevailing price-to-sales or price-to-earnings ratios. Known debt is subtracted from assets to get a final estimate of an individual's estimated worth in United States dollars. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** Herbert, Geoff (10 March 2011). \"Forbes' 2011 list of 'World's Billionaires' is biggest ever\". *Syracuse Post-Standard*.

Amancio Ortega rose from last year's position of number four to second.[20] Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway came in third for the second consecutive time,[21] while Mexican telecommunication mogul Carlos Slim slipped from last year's second position to fourth. Jeff Bezos of Amazon,[22] Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook[23] and Michael Bloomberg of Bloomberg L.P.,[24] appeared for the first time on the *Forbes* top 10 billionaires list, coming at fifth, sixth and eighth positions, respectively. Zuckerberg became the youngest top 10 billionaire this year at the age of 31. Larry Ellison, Charles Koch and David Koch also slipped from their previous year's positions, with Ellison dropping to seventh from fifth, and the Kochs falling to ninth position from sixth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
