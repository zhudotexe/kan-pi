Also noteworthy is that Sikh and Hindu communities have very poor sex-ratios.\n\n\n\n## Caste[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe population of Uttar Pradesh is divided into numerous castes and sub-castes. Historically, Hindu society is divided into four sub-divisions or varnas, the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras. Muslims are also divided as the Shias and Sunnis. In actual practice, Hindu society in generally used to be divided into numerous lineage groups called jatis. Each jati is then sub-divided into clans, called gotras.\n\n\nThe peripheral regions of Uttar Pradesh, are home to a number of tribal communities such as Agaria, Baiga, Bhar, Bhoksa, Chero, Gond, Kol and Korwa. Five of these tribal communities have been recognised by the Government of India as disadvantaged scheduled tribes, viz. Tharus, Boksas, Bhotias, Jaunswaris and Rajis.[3]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMost people in Uttar Pradesh speak Hindi (including Urdu, which is often considered the same language), followed by Awadhi and Bhojpuri.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** \"Half of India's dalit population lives in 4 states\". *The Times of India*. 2 May 2013.\n17. **^** \"UP has the highest OBC population in all Indian states\". *The Times of India*. 7 May 2007.\n18. **^** \"Why smaller castes could hold the key to power in 2017 UP Assembly polls\". 29 December 2016.\n19. **^** \"Survey puts OBC population at 40 pc\". 3 September 2007.\n20. **^** \"OBC population in UP stands at 7 crore\".\n21. **^** \"Kurmis rally against Yadav domination in Uttar Pradesh\". *India Today*.\n22. **^** \"Why the most backward castes are crucial for BJP's sandwich alliance to succeed in Uttar Pradesh\". 7 April 2019.\n23. **^** Katiyar, Prerna (19 June 2016). \"Uttar Pradesh polls: BSP, SP and BJP leaving no stone to come up trumps\". *The Economic Times*.\n24. **^** \"BJP joins race for Brahmin votes with 'prabuddha varg sammelans' in UP\".

Brahmins constitute 13 per cent of the population and are considered as major opinion makers in Uttar Pradesh.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe peripheral regions of Uttar Pradesh, are home to a number of tribal communities such as Agaria, Baiga, Bhar, Bhoksa, Bind, Chero, Gond, Kol and Korwa. Five of these tribal communities have been recognised by the Government of India as disadvantaged scheduled tribes, viz. Tharus, Boksas, Bhotias, Jaunswaris and Rajis.[3] The Literacy rate of the state according to the 2011 Census is 70.69%. With the literacy rate for Males at 79.20%, while it is 59.30% for the Females. While this is still below the national average of 74.04% (82.14% for men, 65.16% for women) the rate of growth has been much higher in Uttar Pradesh as compared to the rest of India.\n\n\n\n\n## District[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of the 2011 census, Prayagraj is the most populous district of Uttar Pradesh while Mahoba being the least populated. Only 3 districts of Jaunpur, Azamgarh and Deoria have a sex ratio greater than 1000 while Gautam Buddha Nagar stands lowest in the tally with a very low ratio of 851. On the contrary, Gautam Buddha Nagar scores highest in literacy rate at 80.12% and Kanpur Nagar 2nd at 79.54%, while both being the poorest districts in terms of sex-ratio, depicting a negative-correlation among literacy and sex-ratio in this case. Districts of Srawasti, Bahraich and Balrampur haven't even crossed the 50% literacy mark yet.\n\n\nThe following table enumerates population, sex-ratio and literacy rates for each district of Uttar Pradesh:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hebbar, Nistula (3 May 2019). \"BJP striving to please Rajputs and Brahmins\". *The Hindu*.
