In this best-of-seven playoff series, the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat, 4–2, winning their first NBA championship in ten years. It was the franchise's 17th title overall, tying the Boston Celtics for the most in league history.[1] The Lakers' LeBron James was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the fourth time in his career. He became the first player in league history to be named Finals MVP with three different franchises (two with the Heat, one with the Cleveland Cavaliers and one with the Lakers) and along with teammate Danny Green, jointly the third players to win the NBA Finals with three different teams.[2] Lakers president Jeanie Buss became the first female controlling owner to guide her team to an NBA title.[3][4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2020 edition of the NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020 NBA Finals| ![](image) |\n| \n\n| Team | Coach | Wins |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Los Angeles Lakers | Frank Vogel | 4 |\n| Miami Heat | Erik Spoelstra | 2 |\n\n |\n| Dates | September 30 – October 11 |\n| MVP | LeBron James(Los Angeles Lakers) |\n| Eastern finals | Heat defeated Celtics, 4–2 |\n| Western finals | Lakers defeated Nuggets, 4–1 |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ← 2019 | **NBA Finals** | 2021 → |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980 | 1981 | 1982 | 1983 | 1984 | 1985 | 1986 | 1987 | 1988 | 1989 |\n |\n| 1990s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1990 | 1991 | 1992 | 1993 | 1994 | 1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 |\n |\n| 2000s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 |\n |\n| 2010s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 |\n |\n| 2020s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |  |  |  |  |  |\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2019–20 NBA season by team\n |\n| --- |\n| * Draft\n* Summer League\n* All-Star Game\n* Playoffs\n* Finals\n* Transactions\n* G League\n* Season suspension\n* NBA Bubble\n |\n| Eastern | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Finals were originally scheduled for June,[8] but the season was suspended in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[9] The NBA and its players later approved a plan to restart the season in late July, setting up the NBA Bubble at Walt Disney World to protect teams from the virus.[10][11] The games were played in the Bubble behind closed doors at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Bay Lake, Florida, with the Finals being played from September 30 through October 11. The Finals marked the conclusion of the NBA Bubble, which recorded no COVID-19 cases for the participating teams.[12] The 2020 Finals was the latest to begin (beating the 1999 edition which began on June 16) and the first one played in September and October, and as well held in the fall.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Season suspension and restart[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season and 2020 NBA Bubble\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn March 11, 2020, the NBA announced the suspension of the 2019–20 season following a report that Utah Jazz All-Star center Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19 just hours before the Jazz road game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.[13] On June 4, the NBA Board of Governors approved 29–1 (the Portland Trail Blazers were the lone dissenter) resuming the 2019–20 season at Walt Disney World. The National Basketball Players Association approved the plan a day later.[11] Under the plan, thirteen Western Conference teams and nine Eastern Conference teams, which include all clubs within six games of a playoff spot, played eight regular-season \"seeding\" games. A possible play-in tournament for the eighth seed in each conference would then be held if the ninth seed finished the regular season within four games of the eighth seed (this play-in tournament was used in the Western conference only). The 2020 NBA playoffs were then played as a conventional post-season tournament.[10]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Atlantic | * Boston\n* Brooklyn\n* New York\n* Philadelphia\n* Toronto\n |\n| Central | * Chicago\n* Cleveland\n* Detroit\n* Indiana\n* Milwaukee\n |\n| Southeast | * Atlanta\n* Charlotte\n* *Miami*\n* Orlando\n* Washington\n |\n\n |\n| Western | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Northwest | * Denver\n* Minnesota\n* Oklahoma City\n* Portland\n* Utah\n |\n| Pacific | * Golden State\n* L.A.

Despite trailing 2–0, the Raptors won the next four games to advance to the Finals in six games,[21] as Leonard outplayed the Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo, who won league MVP that season.[22] This was their first trip to the NBA Finals in franchise history,[24] breaking a 25-year drought for teams from Toronto appearing in the championship round of any of the four major North American professional sports leagues since Major League Baseball's Toronto Blue Jays won the 1993 World Series.[25]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n39. **^** Letourneau, Connor (June 12, 2019). \"Warriors list Kevon Looney as questionable for Game 6 of NBA Finals\". *San Francisco Chronicle*.

Thompson scored a game-high 30 points for the Warriors, but was lost for the game with 2:22 remaining in the third quarter after landing awkwardly and suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee on a drive to the basket contested by Danny Green. With the Raptors leading 111–110, the Warriors managed to force a turnover with 9.6 seconds left in the game, but Curry missed a three-pointer that would have forced a Game 7. Trying to secure the ball after the miss, Iguodala called a timeout, but the Warriors did not have any left, and were assessed a technical foul. It was academic, as time would have otherwise expired had they not attempted to stop the clock. Leonard was awarded three free throws to seal the Raptors' first-ever NBA championship title.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*NBA on ABC*\n |\n| --- |\n| Relatedprograms | * *NBA Countdown*\n* *NBA Access with Ahmad Rashad*\n* *NBA Inside Stuff*\n* *NBA Saturday Primetime*\n* *NBA Sunday Showcase*\n* *WNBA on ABC*\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *NBA on ESPN* | * Radio\n* *NBA Wednesday*\n* *NBA Friday*\n* *WNBA on ESPN*\n* *NBA Today*\n |\n| NBA drafts | * 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n |\n| Non-NBAprograms | * *College Basketball on ABC*\n* *Olympics on ABC*\n |\n\n |\n| Relatedarticles | * NBA on TV (NBA Finals TV ratings)\n* 1960s\n* 1970s\n* 2000s\n* 2010s\n* 2020s\n |\n| Key figures | * All-Star Game\n* ESPN\n* NBA Finals\n* WNBA All-Star Game\n* WNBA Finals\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Western Conference |\n| --- |\n| # | Team | W | L | PCT | GB | GP |\n| 1 | **c** – Golden State Warriors \\* | 57 | 25 | .695 | – | 82 |\n| 2 | **y** – Denver Nuggets \\* | 54 | 28 | .659 | 3.0 | 82 |\n| 3 | **x** – Portland Trail Blazers | 53 | 29 | .646 | 4.0 | 82 |\n| 4 | **y** – Houston Rockets \\* | 53 | 29 | .646 | 4.0 | 82 |\n| 5 | **x** – Utah Jazz | 50 | 32 | .610 | 7.0 | 82 |\n| 6 | **x** – Oklahoma City Thunder | 49 | 33 | .598 | 8.0 | 82 |\n| 7 | **x** – San Antonio Spurs | 48 | 34 | .585 | 9.0 | 82 |\n| 8 | **x** – Los Angeles Clippers | 48 | 34 | .585 | 9.0 | 82 |\n|  |\n| 9 | Sacramento Kings | 39 | 43 | .476 | 18.0 | 82 |\n| 10 | Los Angeles Lakers | 37 | 45 | .451 | 20.0 | 82 |\n| 11 | Minnesota Timberwolves | 36 | 46 | .439 | 21.0 | 82 |\n| 12 | Memphis Grizzlies | 33 | 49 | .402 | 24.0 | 82 |\n| 13 | New Orleans Pelicans | 33 | 49 | .402 | 24.0 | 82 |\n| 14 | Dallas Mavericks | 33 | 49 | .402 | 24.0 | 82 |\n| 15 | Phoenix Suns | 19 | 63 | .232 | 38.0 | 82 |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_egPpCEq5eabTT6IfbCNmcGR2","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

In this best-of-seven playoff, the defending NBA champion and Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors swept the defending Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers four games to zero. The Warriors became the 7th NBA franchise to win back-to-back championships, joining the Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics, Detroit Pistons, Chicago Bulls, Houston Rockets, and Miami Heat. This year's Finals was the first time in any of North America's four major professional sports leagues that the same two teams met for the championship four years in a row.[1] This was also the first time that a team was swept in the NBA Finals since 2007, in which the Cavaliers were also the losing team. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2018 edition of the NBA Finals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 NBA Finals| ![](image) |\n| \n\n| Team | Coach | Wins |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Golden State Warriors | Steve Kerr | 4 |\n| Cleveland Cavaliers | Tyronn Lue | 0 |\n\n |\n| Dates | May 31 – June 8 |\n| MVP | Kevin Durant(Golden State Warriors) |\n| Eastern finals | Cavaliers defeated Celtics, 4–3 |\n| Western finals | Warriors defeated Rockets, 4–3 |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ← 2017 | **NBA Finals** | 2019 → |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn February 8, 2018 – just before the NBA trade deadline – the Cavaliers radically changed their roster in a little more than an hour,[10][11] acquiring George Hill, Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson, and Larry Nance Jr. in exchange for Thomas, Rose, Crowder, Wade, Channing Frye, Iman Shumpert, and their own 2018 first-round pick. Multiple writers argued at the time that the trades made the Cavaliers significantly better.[12][13][14]\n\n\nThe Cavaliers finished the regular season with a 50–32 record, securing the 4th seed in the Eastern Conference.

In this best-of-seven playoff series, the Eastern Conference champion Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Western Conference champion Phoenix Suns, 4–2, winning their first NBA championship in 50 years and second overall. Holding home-court advantage, the Suns led the series 2–0 before the Bucks won the next four games, becoming the fifth team in NBA history to win the championship after losing the first two games.

They were both making their third Finals appearance. Phoenix and Milwaukee each began play as expansion teams in 1968. Both teams were involved in a coin toss for the rights to the first overall pick in the 1969 NBA draft, which the Bucks won and used to select Lew Alcindor, later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, from UCLA. He led the Bucks to their first championship in 1971.[6] The 2021 Finals was the first since 1971 to not include any players who had previously won an NBA championship, and the first since 2015 that no players on the winning team had prior NBA Finals experience. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNBA Finals\n |\n| --- |\n| * Champions\n\t+ Teams\n\t+ Players\n\t+ Coaches\n* Most Valuable Player Award\n* Brown Trophy\n* O'Brien Trophy\n* Championship ring\n* Broadcasters\n* Game sevens\n* Droughts\n* Streaks\n* TV ratings\n |\n| 1940s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 1947 | 1948 | 1949 |\n | ![](image)\n |\n| 1950s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950 | 1951 | 1952 | 1953 | 1954 | 1955 | 1956 | 1957 | 1958 | 1959 |\n |\n| 1960s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1960 | 1961 | 1962 | 1963 | 1964 | 1965 | 1966 | 1967 | 1968 | 1969 |\n |\n| 1970s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1970 | 1971 | 1972 | 1973 | 1974 | 1975 | 1976 | 1977 | 1978 | 1979 |\n |\n| 1980s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n52. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** \"Bucks edge Suns 123-119 to take 3-2 lead in NBA Finals\". *ESPN.com*.

His defense helped limit Booker to 19 points on just 8-for-22 shooting, missing all seven of his 3-point attempts. Milwaukee became the fifth team (after the 1969 Boston Celtics, 1977 Portland Trail Blazers, 2006 Miami Heat, and 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers)[*citation needed*] to come back from a 2–0 deficit in the Finals, and the first to do so by winning the next four games since Miami defeated Dallas in 2006.[59] They also became the second team in NBA history to come back from down 2–0 twice in the same playoffs after the 2020–21 Los Angeles Clippers also did so in consecutive rounds.[61][62] The Suns have won two games in each of their three Finals appearances.[59] Paul became the first player in NBA playoff history to lose four series in which his team led 2–0.[63]\n\n\n\n\n## Rosters[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2020–21 Milwaukee Bucks roster\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Giannis Antetokounmpo was named the Finals MVP, scoring 50 points in Game 6.\nGiannis Antetokounmpo scored a playoff career-high 50 points and added 14 rebounds and five blocks to lead the Bucks to a 105–98 victory to win the series in six games.[10] The 50 points tied a Finals record for the most scored by a player in a series-clinching game, set by Bob Pettit of the St. Louis Hawks in 1958.[57][58] After his dominant performance in the series, including his third game with at least 40 points and 10 rebounds, Antetokounmpo was named the Finals MVP,[59] the youngest winner at age 26 since Kawhi Leonard (22) in 2014.[60] Antetokounmpo made 16 of his 25 shots, and was a surprising 17 for 19 on his free throws after hitting just 55.6% in the playoffs. The game was tied at 77 after three quarters before he scored 13 in the final period to lead Milwaukee to its first championship since 1971, when they were led by Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson. Paul led the Suns with 26 points.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_uwNtMXWXpaMz1ToiIi2Kw1A3","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
