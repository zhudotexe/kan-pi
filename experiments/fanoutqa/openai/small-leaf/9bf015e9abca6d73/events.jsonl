OECD, 2012.\nThe **economy of Luxembourg** is largely dependent on the banking, steel, and industrial sectors. Citizens of Luxembourg enjoy the second highest per capita gross domestic product in the world, according to an IMF estimate in 2022.[19]\n\n\nAlthough Luxembourg in tourist literature is aptly called the \"Green Heart of Europe\", its pastoral land coexists with a highly industrialized and export-intensive area. Luxembourg's economy is quite similar to Germany's.[*clarification needed*] Luxembourg enjoys a degree of economic prosperity very rare among industrialized democracies.\n\n\n\n\n## Sectors[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013 the GDP was $60.54 billion of which services, including the financial sector, produced 86%. The financial sector comprised 36% of GDP, industry comprised 13.3% and agriculture only 0.3%.[20]\n\n\n\n### Banking[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Trausch, G.; de Vreese, M.

It employs about 1–3% of the workforce. Most farmers are engaged in dairy and meat production. Vineyards in the Moselle Valley annually produce about 15 million litres of dry white wine, most of which is consumed within Luxembourg and also in Germany, France, and Belgium on a lesser scale.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Data[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBanking is the largest sector in the Luxembourg economy. In the 2019 Global Financial Centres Index, Luxembourg was ranked as having the 25th most competitive financial center in the world, and third most competitive in Europe after London and Zürich.[21] The country has specialised in the cross-border fund administration business. As Luxembourg's domestic market is relatively small, the country's financial centre is predominantly international. At the end of March 2009, there were 152 banks in Luxembourg, with over 27,000 employees. Political stability, good communications, easy access to other European centres, skilled multilingual staff, a tradition of banking secrecy and cross-border financial expertise have all contributed to the growth of the financial sector. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThese factors have contributed to a Corruption Perceptions Index of 8.3 and a DAW Index ranking of 10 in 2012; the latter the highest in Europe.[22] Germany accounts for the largest-single grouping of banks, with Scandinavian, Japanese, and major US banks also heavily represented. Total assets exceeded €929 billion at the end of 2008. More than 9,000 holding companies are established in Luxembourg. The European Investment Bank—the financial institution of the European Union—is also located there.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Kirsch, R. (1971). *La croissance de l'économie luxembourgeoise*.

The road network has been significantly modernised in recent years with 147 km of motorways connecting the capital to adjacent countries. The advent of the high-speed TGV link to Paris has led to renovation of the city's railway station while a new passenger terminal at Luxembourg Airport has recently been opened. The airport has known a sustained growth in passenger numbers during the last years (2015: 2.7 mio, 2020 : 4 mio expected), and the second stage of expansion is on its way.\n\n\nTrams have been reintroduced to the capital (first core line operative in end 2017) and further lines are planned, including a tram/light-rail to Esch-sur-Alzette. In 2019, almost all public transport was made free to use for both residents and visitors.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the Holding Act of 1929, Luxembourg has been an attractive location for tax avoidance.[23] A network of lawyers, bankers and political elites have since then maintained an infrastructure of regulatory codes, legal expertise and shell companies that enable tax avoidance.[24] Concern about Luxembourg's banking secrecy laws, and its reputation as a tax haven, led in April 2009 to it being added to a \"grey list\" of nations with questionable banking arrangements by the G20,[25] a list from which it was removed in 2009.[26] This concern has led Luxembourg to modify its tax legislation to avoid conflict with the tax authorities of European Union Members. For example, the classic tax exempt 1929 Holding Company was outlawed 31 December 2010, as it was deemed an illegal state aid by the European Commission.[27]\n\n\n\n### Steel[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"World Economic Outlook Database, April 2019\". *IMF.org*.

The refining process led to the development of the steel industry in Luxembourg and founding of the Arbed company in 1911.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe restructuring of the industry and increasing government ownership in Arbed (31%) began as early as 1974. As a result of timely modernization of facilities, cutbacks in production and employment, government assumption of portions of Arbed's debt, and recent cyclical recovery of the international demand for steel, the company is again profitable. Its productivity is among the highest in the world. US markets account for about 6% of Arbed's output. The company specializes in production of large architectural steel beams and specialized value-added products. There has been, however, a relative decline in the steel sector, offset by Luxembourg's emergence as a financial center. In 2001, through the merger with Aceralia and Usinor, Arbed became Arcelor. Arcelor was taken over in 2006 by Mittal Steel to form Arcelor-Mittal, helmed by Lakshmi Mittal, the largest steel producer in the world.\n\n\n\n### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Telecommunications in Luxembourg\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** \nde Selding, Peter B.

But rising global oil demand helped current GDP per capita to expand 94% in the 90s. Despite efforts to promote the non-hydrocarbon sectors and diversify the economy from hydrocarbons to knowledge-based sectors, the oil and gas sector has consistently contributed to at least 80 percent of the government of Qatar’s total revenues since 2014, as well as 90 percent of Qatar’s total exports.[37]\n\n\nIn 2020 GDP PPP ~260 billion dollars.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, Qatar's economic performance improved in 2018 despite the economic embargo.

The exploration of oil and gas fields began in 1939.[16][17] In 1973, oil production and revenues increased dramatically, moving Qatar out of the ranks of the world's poorest countries and providing it with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world.\n\n\nQatar's economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989. OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) quotas on crude oil production, the lower price for oil, and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to be cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from Egypt and South Asia, have grown again.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe International Monetary Fund in its spring assessment 2019 said that Qatar has \"successfully absorbed the shocks\" of the blockade imposed in 2017 and the dropped oil prices from 2014 to 2016. S&P Global had marked Qatar's outlook to negative in 2017, but changed it to stable in 2019.[27]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Qatar Central Bank stated that the country's economic growth will see a boost over the next two years amid expectations of stable oil prices and continued strong exports. The GDP is expected to grow at an average rate of 2.8% between 2018 and 2020, with the budget surplus falling to 4.35 billion riyals in 2019, from a surplus of 15.1 billion riyals in 2018.[28]\n\n\n\n### Islamic finance[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

That said, there is considerable optimism that Qatar's bourse, the Doha Securities Market (DSM), will remain relatively resilient to the ongoing international turbulence. It has followed the same peak-trough trajectory as many others around the globe, hitting record highs in mid-2008, before diving in late 2008 and early 2009. Between December 2006 and July 2008 the DSM Index rose about 117% before the global financial crisis wiped out most of these gains. In the first few months of 2009, the DSM lost about 40% of its value. In an effort to stave off further losses, the government announced in February 2009 that it would step in to buy up shares of troubled banks amounting to about 10% of the market's capitalisation. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nQatar's proved reserves of gas are the third-largest in the world, exceeding 7000 km³ (250 trillion cubic feet). The economy was boosted in 1991 by completion of the $1.5-billion Phase I of North Field gas development. In 1996, the Qatargas project began exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Japan. Further phases of North Field gas development costing billions of dollars are in various stages of planning and development.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPetroleum and natural gas are the cornerstones of Qatar's economy and account for more than 70% of total government revenue, more than 60% of gross domestic product, and roughly 85% of export earnings. Qatar has the world's third largest proven natural gas reserve and is the second-largest exporter of natural gas.\n\n\n\n\n## Energy sector[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Qatar\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

However, large natural gas reserves have been located off Qatar's northeast coast. These offshore gas fields also may contain significant oil and condensate reserves. For example, the state owned QatarEnergy corporation found two offshore oil fields in the 1960s. At the time production was too expensive. However, technological development led to production over 30 years later.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nQatar's heavy industrial projects, all based in Umm Said, include a refinery with a 50,000 barrels (8,000 m³) per day capacity, a fertilizer plant for urea and ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these industries use gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between European and Japanese firms and the state-owned QatarEnergy corporation (formerly QGPC). The U.S. is the major equipment supplier for Qatar's oil and gas industry, and U.S. companies are playing a major role in North Field gas development.\n890-\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe government considers industry to be an integral part of its plan to diversify the economy and maximize its huge natural gas reserves, which serve as the primary feed stock for the sector. Accordingly, careful planning has gone into industrial development. With an eye towards exports, development has been clustered around the ports of Ras Laffan Industrial City and Mesaieed Industrial Area, which are key centers of energy. The result has seen considerable growth over the years. Industries Qatar (IQ), a producer of petrochemicals, fertilizers and steel, is a regional powerhouse, surpassed only in size by Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), the Middle East's largest chemical producer. In 2007 the manufacturing sector made the third-largest contribution to GDP among non-oil and gas sectors, equivalent to about 7.5% of GDP. Industry in Qatar is regulated by the Ministry of Business and Trade.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Qatari government also announced in March 2009 that it was planning to buy the investment portfolio of the banks in the hope this would encourage them to continue lending. Cautious sector sentiment has also been compounded by the Qatar Central Bank's (QCB's) lending restrictions, which demand a loan-to-deposit ratio of 90%. Given the high level of integration between Qatar's economy and the Persian Gulf region, as well as the wider world, a slowdown in business and banking activity seemed inevitable. Nevertheless, Qatar's banking sector has been faring relatively well, considering the strife experienced in other countries, and insiders are confident that activity will return to its previous brisk pace in the second half of 2009 as confidence slowly rebuilds around the globe.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs driving is the primary mode of transport in Qatar, the road network is a major focus of the plan. Project highlights in this segment include the multibillion-dollar Doha Expressway and the Qatar Bahrain Causeway, which will connect Qatar to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and is considered a milestone in regional interconnectivity. Mass-transit options, such as a Doha metro, light-rail system and more extensive bus networks, are also under development to ease road congestion. In addition, the railway system is being significantly expanded and could eventually form an integral part of a GCC-wide network linking all of the six member states. The airport, too, is expanding capacity to keep up with rising visitor numbers. The New Doha International Airport is one of the largest projects in Qatar today and will boast a capacity of 50m passengers upon completion in 2015. Finally, port infrastructure is seen as an integral part of Qatar's economic development as it focuses on LNG and industrial exports. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nQatar pursues a vigorous program of \"Qatarization\", under which all joint venture industries and government departments strive to move Qatari nationals into positions of greater authority. Growing numbers of foreign-educated Qataris, including many educated in the U.S., are returning home to assume key positions formerly occupied by expatriates. In order to control the influx of expatriate workers, Qatar has tightened the administration of its foreign manpower programs over the past several years. Security is the principal basis for Qatar's strict entry and immigration rules and regulations.\n\n\n\n## Industry[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### North Field LNG project[edit]\n\n\nQatar is expected to be one of the fastest growing economies in 2009 – the hope is it will be enough to keep the industrial sector on an upward trajectory.\n\n\nOn 8 February 2021, the world's largest LNG supplier, Qatar Petroleum (now QatarEnergy), signed an EPC-contract with Chiyoda and Technip for the North Field East (NFE) expansion project to increase QE's annually LNG output by 40% until 2026.[20] For the $28.7 billion NFE expansion project, QatarEnergy has partnered with five global energy companies that have acquired 25% stake in the project. These include Shell, TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil, each with 6.25%, and Eni and ConocoPhillips, each with 3.125% stakes. In a first phase, LNG export capacity is expected to increase from 77 million tons per year to 110 million tons per year by 2026.[21][22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Pearl Qatar\nUnder the ambitious five-year development plan of the Qatar Tourism and Exhibitions Authority (QTEA), the government aimed to boost the number of visitors from 964,000 as of 2007 to 1.5m by 2010.[30] The funding required to meet this goal was present in sufficient amounts; in 2008 the state allocated some $17bn for tourism development through 2014, most of which was allocated towards hotels, exhibition space and infrastructure. In order to keep up with a rising number of visitors, the government set a goal of increasing hotel capacity 400% by 2012.[31] In addition to financial support, the government has also worked to ease business regulations in a bid to increase private sector activity. A major aspect of expansion plans is the Hamad International Airport, which has the capacity to handle up to 24m passengers.[32]\n\n\nQatar Airways is an airline owned by the Qatar government and was founded in 1993. It travels to over a hundred destinations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 20 June 2022, Minister of State for Energy Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi said at a press conference at the QatarEnergy that the expected production increase from this project will be 32.6 million tonnes annually. Ethane produced from the project would be 1.5 million tonnes per year, LPG 4 million tonnes per year, 250.000 barrels of condensate and 5.000 tonnes of helium per day.[23][24]\n\n\nIn a second phase, the North Field South (NFS) project, Shell and TotalEnergies have each acquired 9.375% and ConocoPhillips 6.25% stakes. QatarEnergy plans to increase LNG production with the NFS project to 126 million tons per year beginning in 2028.[25]\n\n\nIn April 2023, Sinopec acquired a 5% stake in an 8 million tonnes per year LNG train.[26]\n\n\n\n## Financial sector[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPetrochemicals and fertilizers supply make up a large portion of the industrial base, along with steel and other construction materials, through Qatar Steel and Qatar Primary Material Company (QPMC). Indeed, over the past few years, demand for construction materials experienced a major surge as the development boom swept the Persian Gulf region. But the global financial crisis has put a significant dent in demand in the region, as project credit lines dry up and investor sentiment remains cautious. The crisis has in fact impacted the whole of the industrial sector – IQ saw its net profit drop in the fourth quarter of 2008 more than 90% over the same period the previous year. But in relative terms, the sector has fared better than most and IQ still managed to post an annual profit of $2bn. Large profit chunks from years past have been channeled into capital investments, which should help the sector ride out the storm. IQ, for example, is pushing several major expansion projects, worth almost $6bn, ahead. \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther niche tourism segments receiving special focus include cultural tourism on the back of the high publicity opening of Doha's Museum of Islamic Art, and sports tourism, initially spurred by the Asian Games, to which Qatar played host in 2006. Qatar hosted the 2022 FIFA World cup, [33] [34]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Highway Q3 (from Doha to Dukhan)\nMain article: Transport in Qatar\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Qatari banking sector managed to escape the direct impact of the global subprime fallout, but was not altogether unscathed by its aftershocks. Overall, it was the best performing of the Gulf Cooperation Council markets in the last quarter of 2008 and most banks posted substantial profits for 2008. But the sector is also facing issues of liquidity, declining customer confidence and a forced reluctance to lend. In a bid to strengthen the banks’ positions, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) announced in early 2009 that it was willing to take a 10-20% stake in any interested local listed banks by way of a capital injection, although this was later reduced to 5% stakes and an additional 5% at the end of 2009.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** \"Oil and Gas Details\". *www.qp.com.qa*.\n19. **^** \"وزير التجارة و الصناعة\". *مكتب الاتصال الحكومي* (in Arabic).

So far the government, the primary transport developer, has done well in terms of keeping up with demand for new transportation options. In 2008 the Public Works Authority (Ashghal), one of the bodies that oversees infrastructure development, underwent a major reorganisation in order to streamline and modernise the authority in preparation for major project expansions across all segments in the near future. Ashghal works in tandem with the Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA), the body that designed the transportation master plan, instituted in March 2006 and running to 2025.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Scene in the harbour of Al Khor. Fisheries is a minor sector in Qatar, and production is almost exclusively for domestic consumption.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe gas condensate can be refined to usual oil products in specialised refineries. The costs are a bit higher but it is normal today for companies to use the gas condensate too. Oil offshore production in 2008 for PS-2 and PS-3 blocks was about 31.1 million barrels (84,995 b/d). Joint Ventures facilities (PS-1, ALK, K & A): Combined oil production from these three joint venture production facilities in 2008 was 57.4 million barrels (156,873 b/d).[18] Like with gas fields there are more offshore blocks which need to be explored and could increase the oil output. So the 500,000 bpd peak and a depletion in 2023 is delayed. With higher oil prices it is expected that the offshore exploration of oil and/or natural gas fields will go on. Oil production in June 2016 seemed to be around 670,000 barrels per day, a bit down from February 2016 production of 692,000 barrels per day. Taking all liquids together Qatar is already far beyond a million barrels per day.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | * ![](image) European Union 29.13%\n* ![](image) United States 14.6%\n* ![](image) United Kingdom 9.35%\n* ![](image) China 8.56%\n* ![](image) India 4.17%\n* ![](image) Turkey 3.65%\n* ![](image) Japan 3.6%\n* ![](image) Oman 2.67% (2019)[10]\n |\n| Gross external debt\n | $168 billion (31 December 2017 est.)[11] |\n| Public finances |\n| Government debt\n | ![Positive decrease](image) 44.5% of GDP (2022) |\n| Revenues | $297.70 billion (2022) |\n| Expenses | $208.70 billion (2022) |\n| Credit rating\n | * Standard & Poor's:[12]\n* AA (Domestic)\n* AA (Foreign)\n* AA+ (T&C Assessment)\n* Outlook: Stable[13]\n* Moody's:[13]\n* Aa3\n* Outlook: Positive\n |\n| Main data source: ***CIA World Fact Book*** *All values, unless otherwise stated, are in US dollars.*\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | * ![Increase](image) 0.855 very high (2021)[6] (42nd)\n* N/A IHDI (2021)[7]\n |\n| Labour force\n | ![Increase](image) 2,129,330 (2019)[8] |\n| Unemployment | ![Steady](image) 0.6% (2017 est.) |\n| Main industries\n | * Liquefied natural gas\n* crude oil\n* ammonia\n* fertilizer\n* petrochemicals\n* reinforcing steel\n* cement\n* ship repair\n |\n| External |\n| Exports | ![Decrease](image) $86.51 billion (2018 est.) |\n| Export goods\n | Liquefied natural gas, Petroleum Products, Fertilizers, Steel |\n| Main export partners\n | * ![](image) Japan 17.1%\n* ![](image) South Korea 15.6%\n* ![](image) India 13.6%\n* ![](image) China 13.4%\n* ![](image) European Union 7.64%\n* ![](image) Singapore 7.05%\n* ![](image) Thailand 3.77%\n* ![](image) Taiwan 3.28%\n* ![](image) Pakistan 2.6%\n* ![](image) United Kingdom 2.5%\n* ![](image) United States 1.64% (2019)[9]\n |\n| Imports | ![Decrease](image) $26.69 billion (2017 est.) |\n| Import goods\n | Machinery and Transport Equipment, Food, Chemicals |\n| Main import partners\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Islamic finance sector enjoyed increased activity in 2008 and is expected to continue to grow into 2009 as more sophisticated financial instruments spark the interest of investors. In addition to Islamic banks, such as Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB), Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIB) and newcomer Masraf Al Rayyan, conventional banks have also been entering the sharia-compliant sector and are coming to view an Islamic subsidiary as a virtual necessity in order to maintain market standing. Islamic banks currently take the lion's share of sharia-compliant business, though the conventional banks are working hard to take a greater share of market activity. Both Islamic banks and Islamic subsidiaries did remarkably well in the first three quarters of 2008, during which overall financing activity increased by 70.6% compared to the same period in the previous year.

USD 134,000 nominal, US$101,000 PPP), the mean household income after social security, taxes and mandatory health insurance was CHF 85,560 (c. USD 95,000 nominal, US$72,000 PPP).[89]\nThe OECD lists Swiss household gross adjusted disposable income per capita US$32,594 PPP for 2011.[90]\n\n\nAs of 2016, Switzerland had the highest average wealth per adult, at $561,900.[91] The top 1% richest persons own 35% of all the wealth (2015).[92]\n\n\nThe \"net wealth\" of Switzerland was $5.4 trillion as measured by the net worth of its richest citizens. Among this group are 740 super-rich people with assets of at least $100 million. Switzerland has 580,000 millionaires in total which is 60,000 more than Germany with a population which is approximately 10 times larger.[93]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEconomy of Switzerland| ![](image)The city of Zurich, the most important economic center of the country\n |\n| Currency | Swiss franc (CHF) |\n| Fiscal year\n | Calendar year |\n| Trade organisations\n | EFTA, WTO and OECD |\n| Country group\n | * Developed/Advanced[1]\n* High-income economy[2]\n* European (non-EU) economy; renowned banking and financial hub[3]\n |\n| Statistics |\n| Population | 8,636,986 (2020)[4] |\n| GDP | * $870 billion (nominal, 2023)[5]\n* $774 billion (PPP, 2023)[5]\n |\n| GDP rank | * 20th (nominal, 2023)\n* 36th (PPP, 2023)\n |\n| GDP growth\n | * 2.1% (2022)\n* 0.8% (2023)\n* 1.8% (2024)[5]\n |\n| GDP per capita\n | * $98,800 (nominal, 2023)[5]\n* $88,000 (PPP, 2023)[5]\n |\n| GDP per capita rank\n | * 6th (nominal, 2023)\n* 6th (PPP, 2023)\n |\n| GDP by sector\n | * agriculture: 0.7%\n* industry: 25.6%\n* services: 73.7%\n* (2017)[3]\n |\n| Inflation (CPI)\n | 2.4% (2023)[5] |\n| Population below poverty line\n | * 6.6% in poverty (2014)[3]\n* 17.4% at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE, 2018)[6]\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe stock market collapse of 2007-2009 deeply affected investment income earned abroad. This translated to a substantial fall in the surplus of the current account balance. In 2006, Switzerland recorded a 15.1% per GDP surplus. It went down to 9.1% in 2007 and further dropped to 1.8% in 2008. It recovered in 2009 and 2010 with a surplus of 11.9% and 14.6% respectively.[37] Unemployment peaked in December 2009 at 4.4%.

Massive layoffs and dismissals by enterprises resulting from the global economic slowdown, major management scandals and different foreign investment attitudes have strained the traditional Swiss labour peace. Swiss trade unions have encouraged strikes against several companies, including Swiss International Air Lines, Coca-Cola, and Orange. Total days lost to strikes, however, remain among the lowest in the OECD.\n\n\nA study estimated that Switzerland will have a short fall of hundreds of thousands of workers by 2030.[87] According to statistics, one in four Swiss has a second job.[88]\n\n\n\n## Income and wealth distribution[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Demographics of Switzerland and Poverty in Switzerland\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1970s the GDP growth rate gradually declined from a peak of 6.5% in 1970; GDP then contracted by 7.5% in 1975 and 1976. Switzerland became increasingly dependent on oil imported from its main suppliers, the OPEC cartel. The 1973 international oil crisis caused Switzerland's energy consumption to decrease in the years from 1973 to 1978.[29] In 1974 there were three nationwide car-free Sundays when private transport was prohibited as a result of the oil supply shock. From 1977 onwards GDP grew again, although Switzerland was also affected by the 1979 energy crisis which resulted in a short-term decrease in Switzerland's energy consumption. In 1970 industry still employed about 46% of the labor force, but during the economic recession of the 1970s the services sector grew to dominate the national economy. By 1970 17.2% of the population and about one quarter of the work force were foreign nationals, though job losses during the economic recession decreased this number.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1980s, Switzerland's economy contracted by 1.3% in 1982 but grew substantially for the rest of the decade, with annual GDP growth between about 3% and 4%, apart from 1986 and 1987 when growth decreased to 1.9% and 1.6% respectively.[30]\n\n\nSwitzerland's economy was marred by slow growth in the 1990s, having the weakest economic growth in Western Europe. The economy was affected by a three-year recession from 1991 to 1993, when the economy contracted by 2%. The contraction also became apparent in Switzerland's energy consumption and export growth rates. Switzerland's economy averaged no appreciable increase (only 0.6% annually) in GDP.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![Increase](image)4.2%\n | ![Increase](image)0.6%\n | ![Positive decrease](image)3.0%\n | ![Positive decrease](image)42.1%\n |\n\n\n## Economic sectors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The city of Zurich, the most important economic center of the country and one of the world's major financial centers, hosts the SIX Swiss Exchange.\nOrigin of the capital at the 30 biggest Swiss corporations, 2018.[40] The majority of large Swiss companies have foreign CEOs.[41]\n\n\n\nSwitzerland (39%)\nNorth America (33%)\nEurope (24%)\nRest of the world (4%)\n\nThe Swiss economy follows the typical developed country model with respect to the economic sectors.

After the worldwide stock market crashes in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, there were more announcements of false enterprise statistics[*clarification needed*] and exaggerated managers' wages. The rate of GDP growth dropped to 1.2% in 2001; 0.4% in 2002; and minus 0.2% in 2003. This economic slowdown had a noticeable impact on the labour market.\n\n\nMany companies announced mass dismissals and thus the unemployment rate rose from its low of 1.6% in September 2000 to a peak of 4.3% in January 2004,[32] although well below the European Union (EU) rate of 9.2% at the end of 2004.[33]\n\n\nOn 10 November 2002 the economics magazine *Cash* suggested five measures for political and economic institutions to implement to revive the Swiss economy:\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"Human Development Index (HDI)\". *hdr.undp.org*.

The official poverty line is drawn at CHF2,279 ($2,300) per month to pay for rent, health insurance, clothes and food.[98]\n\n\nAbout 8.2% of the population live below the national poverty line, defined in Switzerland as earning less than CHF3,990 per month for a household of two adults and two children, and a further 15% are at risk of poverty.[99]\n\n\n\n## Economic policy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Trade policy of Switzerland\n\n### Terrorism[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Terrorism in Switzerland\n\nThrough the United States-Swiss Joint Economic Commission (JEC), Switzerland has passed strict legislation covering anti-terrorism financing and the prevention of terrorist acts, marked by the implementation of several anti-money laundering procedures and the seizure of al-Qaeda accounts.\n\n\n\n### European Union[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2003, the financial sector[58] comprised an estimated 11.6% of Switzerland's GDP and employed approximately 196,000 people (136,000 of whom work in the banking sector); this represents about 5.6% of the total Swiss workforce.[59]\n\n\nSwiss neutrality and national sovereignty, long recognized by foreign nations, have fostered a stable environment in which the banking sector was able to develop and thrive. Switzerland has maintained neutrality through both World Wars, is not a member of the European Union, and was not even a member of the United Nations until 2002.[60][61] Currently an estimated 28 percent of all funds held outside the country of origin (sometimes called \"offshore\" funds) are kept in Switzerland.[62] In 2009 Swiss banks managed 5.4 trillion Swiss Francs.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile most of the Swiss economic practices have been brought largely into conformity with the European Union's policies, some trade protectionism remains, particularly for the small agricultural sector.[43]\n\n\nIn 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in Switzerland is Services with 230,494 companies followed by Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate and Retail Trade with 107,547 and 45,935 companies respectively.[44]\n\n\n\n### Watches[edit]\n\n\nSwitzerland is a leading exporter of high-end watches and clocks. Swiss companies produce most of the world's high-end watches: in 2011 exports reached nearly 19.3 billion CHF, up 19.2% over the previous year. Watch manufacturing is mostly located around the Jura mountains, in the cantons of Geneva, Vaud, Neuchâtel, Bern, and Jura. Notable watchmaking firms include Rolex, Patek Philippe, Swatch, and Richemont.\n\n\nThe watches go to Asia (55%), Europe (29%), Americas (14%), Africa and Oceania (both 1%).[45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1940s, particularly during World War II, the economy profited from the increased export and delivery of weapons to Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and other European countries. However, Switzerland's energy consumption decreased rapidly. The co-operation of the banks with the Nazis (although they also co-operated extensively with the British and French) and their commercial relations with the Axis powers during the war were later sharply criticised, resulting in a short period of international isolation of Switzerland. Switzerland's production facilities were largely undamaged by the war, and afterwards both imports and exports grew rapidly.[28]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, annual GDP growth averaged 5% and Switzerland's energy consumption nearly doubled. Coal lost its rank as Switzerland's primary energy source, as other imported fossil fuels, such as crude and refined oil and natural and refined gas, increased.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n110. **^** Regionale Disparitäten in der Schweiz - Schlüsselindikatoren Archived June 14, 2013, at the Wayback Machine (in German and French) accessed 20 December 2011\n\n## Further reading[edit]\n\n\n* Katzenstein, Peter J. \"Capitalism in one country?

The Irish economy began to recover in 2014, growing by 4.8%, making Ireland the fastest growing economy in the European Union.[124] Contributing factors to growth included a recovering construction sector, quantitative easing, a weak euro, and low oil prices.[125][126] This growth helped to reduce national debt to 109% of GDP, and the budget deficit fell to 3.1% in the fourth quarter.[127]\n\n\nThe headline unemployment rate remained steady at 10%, though the youth unemployment rate remained higher than the EU average, at over 20%.[128][129] Emigration had continued to play a significant factor in unemployment statistics, though the emigration rate also began to fall in 2014.[130][131]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Inflation rates in Ireland\". *worlddata.info*.

Ireland's agri-food exports include several high-value dairy brands,[208] and are led by a number of Irish companies including Kerry Group, Glanbia, Greencore and Ornua.[209]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome other commentators have suggested that, depending on the Eurozone, world economic outlook as well as other internal and external factors, the growth seen in Ireland in 2014 and early 2015 may not indicate a longer-term pattern for sustainable economic improvement.[150][151][152] Other commentators have noted that recovery figures do not account for emigration, youth unemployment, child poverty, homelessness and other factors.[153]\n\n\nOn 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, which was widely reported as likely having a negative impact on trade between the UK and Ireland, and the Irish economy in general.[154][155] Other commentators, for example the Financial Times, suggested that some London-based financial institutions might move operations to Dublin after Brexit.[156]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSimilarly, the insurance industry in Ireland is a leader in both retail markets and corporate customers in the EU, in large part due to the International Financial Services Centre.[222]\n\n\n\n## Taxation and welfare[edit]\n\n\n### Welfare benefits[edit]\n\n\nAs of December 2007, Ireland's net unemployment benefits for long-term unemployed people across four family types (single people, lone parents, single-income couples with and without children) was the third highest of the OECD countries (jointly with Iceland) after Denmark and Switzerland.[223] Jobseeker's Allowance or Jobseeker's Benefit for a single person in Ireland is €208 per week, as of January 2022.\n\n\nAs of 2018, state provided (contributory) old age pensions had a maximum weekly rate of €248.30 for a single pensioner aged between 66 and 80. The maximum weekly rate for the state pension (non-contributory) was €237 for a single pensioner aged between 66 and 80.[224]\n\n\n\n### Wealth distribution and taxation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n162. **^** \"Irish GDP growth at staggering 26.3pc last year, economist says figures are 'meaningless'\". *Irish Independent*. 12 July 2016.

Ireland first experienced a short technical recession from Q2-Q3 2007, followed by a recession from Q1 2008 – Q4 2009.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1987, Fianna Fáil reduced public spending, cut taxes, and promoted competition. Ryanair used Ireland's deregulated aviation market and helped European regulators to see benefits of competition in transport markets. Intel invested in 1989 and was followed by a number of technology companies such as Microsoft and Google. A consensus exists among all government parties about the sustained economic growth.[75]\n\n\nBetween 1985 and 2002, private sector jobs increased 59%. The economy shifted from an agriculture to a knowledge economy, focusing on services and high-tech industries. Economic growth averaged 10% from 1995 to 2000, and 7% from 2001 to 2004. Industry, which accounts for 46% of GDP and about 80% of exports, has replaced agriculture as the country's leading sector.\n\n\n\n### Celtic Tiger (1995–2007)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Celtic Tiger\n\n![](image)Ireland GDP Real GDP (chained 2010 Euros)\n Nominal GDP\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis made Ireland the most popular destination for US corporate tax inversions.[177] When Pfizer and Irish-based Allergan announced the largest corporate tax inversion in history at $160bn (84% of Ireland's 2016 GNI\\* of €190bn),[178] it forced the Obama administration to block US tax inversions. None have occurred since.[179]\n\n\nIreland had also become a base for US technology multinationals. By 2014 (see table), Apple's Irish ASI subsidiary was handling €34bn annually of untaxed profits (20% of Ireland's 2014 GNI\\*). The EU forced Ireland to close the \"double Irish\",[180] but it was replaced (Apple's \"capital allowances\" and Microsoft's \"single malt\").[181][182]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n122. **^** \"Rise of the Celtic Phoenix?\".
