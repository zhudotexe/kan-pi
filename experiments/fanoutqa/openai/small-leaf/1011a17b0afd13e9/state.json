The average gravitational acceleration on Mars is approximately 3.72076 m/s\u00b2, which is about 38% of Earth's gravity. The gravity of Mars is influenced by various factors such as topography, isostasy, convective flow, and the strength of the mantle. The gravity field of Mars is described using spherical harmonic functions, and the latest gravity model for Mars is the Goddard Mars Model 3 (GMM-3), developed in 2016.\n\nTo calculate the surface gravity of Mars, the formula is:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{GM}{R_{M}^{2}} = \\frac{4r^{3}\\pi^{2}}{T^{2}R_{M}^{2}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( g \\) is the surface gravity of Mars\n- \\( G \\) is the universal constant of gravitation\n- \\( M \\) is the mass of Mars\n- \\( R_{M} \\) is the radius of Mars\n- \\( r \\) is the distance between Mars and the satellite\n- \\( T \\) is the orbiting period of the satellite\n\nThe surface gravity of Mars can be calculated using the parameters mentioned above.",

          "content": "<document>\n<title>Gravity of Mars</title>\n<fragment>\nThe **gravity of Mars** is a natural phenomenon, due to the law of gravity, or gravitation, by which all things with mass around the planet Mars are brought towards it. It is weaker than Earth's gravity due to the planet's smaller mass. The average gravitational acceleration on Mars is 3.72076 ms\u22122 (about 38% of that of Earth) and it varies.[1] In general, topography-controlled isostasy drives the short wavelength free-air gravity anomalies.[2] At the same time, convective flow and finite strength of the mantle lead to long-wavelength planetary-scale free-air gravity anomalies over the entire planet.[3][4] Variation in crustal thickness, magmatic and volcanic activities, impact-induced Moho-uplift, seasonal variation of polar ice caps, atmospheric mass variation and variation of porosity of the crust could also correlate to the lateral variations.[5][6][7][8][9] Over the years models consisting of an increasing but limited number of spherical harmonics have been produced. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMaps produced have included free-air gravity anomaly, Bouguer gravity anomaly, and crustal thickness. In some areas of Mars there is a correlation between gravity anomalies and topography. Given the known topography, higher resolution gravity field can be inferred. Tidal deformation of Mars by the Sun or Phobos can be measured by its gravity. This reveals how stiff the interior is, and shows that the core is partially liquid.\nThe study of surface gravity of Mars can therefore yield information about different features and provide beneficial information for future landings.\n\n\n\n\n## Measurement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rotating spherical harmonic, with \n\n\n\n\u2113\n=\n0\n\n\u00a0to\u00a0\n\n4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ell =0{\\text{ to }}4}\n\n![{\\displaystyle \\ell =0{\\text{ to }}4}](image) for the vertical, and \n\n\n\nm\n=\n0\n\n\u00a0to\u00a0\n\n4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m=0{\\text{ to }}4}\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBefore the arrival of the Mariner 9 and Viking orbiter spacecraft at Mars, only an estimate of the Mars gravitational constant GM, i.e. the universal constant of gravitation times the mass of Mars, was available for deducing the properties of the Martian gravity field.[14] GM could be obtained through observations of the motions of the natural satellites of Mars (Phobos and Deimos) and spacecraft flybys of Mars (Mariner 4 and Mariner 6).[14]\n\n\nLong term Earth-based observations of the motions of Phobos and Deimos provide physical parameters including semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination angle to the Laplacian plane etc.,[15] which allow calculation of the ratio of solar mass to the mass of Mars, moment of inertia and coefficient of the gravitational potential of Mars, and give initial estimates of the gravity field of Mars.[15]\n\n\n\n### Inferred from radio tracking data[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![{\\displaystyle m=0{\\text{ to }}4}](image) for the horizontal. For the Martian C20 and C30, they vary with time because of the seasonal variation of mass of the polar ice caps through the annual sublimation-condensation cycle of carbon dioxide.\nTo understand the gravity of Mars, its gravitational field strength *g* and gravitational potential *U* are often measured. Simply, if Mars is assumed to be a static perfectly spherical body of radius *RM*, provided that there is only one satellite revolving around Mars in a circular orbit and such gravitation interaction is the only force acting in the system, the equation would be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\nM\nm\n\n\nr\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n=\nm\nr\n\n\u03c9\n\n2\n\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {GMm}{r^{2}}}=mr\\omega ^{2},}\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Smith, D.

For degree over 50, it has been shown that those variations have high correlation with the topography.[13] Geophysical interpretation of surface features could further help deriving a more complete picture of the Martian gravity field, though misleading results could be produced.[13]\n\n\nThe oldest technique in determining the gravity of Mars is through Earth-based observation. Later with the arrival of uncrewed spacecraft, subsequent gravity models were developed from radio tracking data.\n\nScientists measured the perturbation of different spacecraft through Doppler and range tracking methods to develop different gravity models ever since the first arrival of the uncrewed space probe Mariner 9 in 1971.

Topography data obtained from the MOLA instrument aboard the Mars Global Surveyor thus becomes a useful tool in producing a more detailed short-scale gravity model, utilizing the gravity-topography correlation in short-wavelength.[13] However, not all regions on Mars show such correlation, notably the northern lowland and the poles.[13] Misleading results could be easily produced, which could lead to wrong geophysics interpretation.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** Goossens, Sander; Sabaka, Terence J.; Genova, Antonio; Mazarico, Erwan; Nicholas, Joseph B.; Neumann, Gregory A.

It has been recognized that to avoid failure, precise understanding of the gravity field of Mars is essential for the landing projects, so that offsetting factors and uncertainties of gravitational effects could be minimized, allowing for a smooth landing progress.[38][39] The first ever man-made object landing on Mars, the Mars 2 lander, crashed for an unknown reason. Since the surface environment of Mars is complex, composed of laterally varying morphological patterns, in order to avoid rock hazard the landing progress should be further assisted by employment of LIDAR on site in determining the exact landing position and other protective measures.[38][39]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![{\\displaystyle g={\\frac {GM}{R_{M}^{2}}}={\\frac {r^{3}\\omega ^{2}}{R_{M}^{2}}}={\\frac {4r^{3}\\pi ^{2}}{T^{2}R_{M}^{2}}}}](image), where *RM* is the radius of Mars.

However, to interpret the crustal structure, further elimination of such gravitational effect is necessary so that the reduced gravity would only be the result of the core, mantle and crust below datum.[5] The product after elimination is the Bouguer anomalies. However, density of the material in building up the terrain would be the most important constraint in the calculation, which may vary laterally on the planet and is affected by porosity and geochemistry of the rock.[5][9] Relevant information could be obtained from Martian meteorites and in-situ analysis.\n\n\n\n### Local gravity anomalies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGlobal gravity anomalies, also termed as long-wavelength gravity anomalies, are the low-degree harmonics of the gravity field,[4] which cannot be attributed to local isostasy, but rather finite strength of the mantle and density differences in the convection current.[13][3][4] For Mars, the largest component of Bouguer anomaly is the degree one harmonic, which represents the mass deficit in the southern hemisphere and excess in the northern hemisphere.[5] The second largest component corresponds to the planet flattening and Tharsis bulge.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe giant impact basins are the exceptions that have not experienced viscous relaxation, as crustal thinning has made the crust too thin to sustain sub-solidus crustal flow.[5][25]\n\n\n\n### Low bulk crustal density[edit]\n\n\nThe most recent crustal density model RM1 developed in 2017 gives the bulk crustal density to be 2582 \u00b1 209\u00a0kg m\u22123 for Mars,[9] which represents a global average value.[9] Lateral variation of the crustal density should exist.[9] For example, over the volcanic complexes, local density is expected to be as high as 3231 \u00b1 95\u00a0kg m\u22123,[9] which matched the meteorite data and previous estimations. In addition, the density of the northern hemisphere is in general higher than that of the southern hemisphere,[9] which may imply that the latter is more porous than the former.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe two major tidal forces acting on Mars are the solar tide and Phobos tide.[13] Love number k2 is an important proportional dimensionless constant relating the tidal field acting to the body with the multipolar moment resulting from the mass distribution of the body. Usually k2 can tell quadrupolar deformation.[13] Finding k2 is helpful in understanding the interior structure on Mars.[13] The most updated k2 obtained by Genova's team is 0.1697 \u00b1 0.0009.[13] As if k2 is smaller than 0.10 a solid core would be indicated, this tells that at least the outer core is liquid on Mars,[31] and the predicted core radius is 1520\u20131840\u00a0km.[31]\n\n\nHowever, current radio tracking data from MGS, ODY and MRO does not allow the effect of phase lag on the tides to be detected because it is too weak and needs more precise measurement on the perturbation of spacecraft in the future.[13]\n\n\n\n## Geophysical implications[edit]\n\n\n### Crustal thickness[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo achieve the bulk value, porosity could play an important role. If the mineral grain density is chosen to be 3100\u00a0kg m\u22123,[9] 10% to 23% porosity could give a 200\u00a0kg m\u22123 drop in the bulk density.[9] If the pore spaces are filled with water or ice, bulk density decrease is also expected.[9] A further drop in bulk density could be explained by increasing density with depth,[9] with the surface layer more porous than the deeper Mars, and the increase of density with depth also has geographical variation.[9]\n\n\n\n## Engineering and scientific applications[edit]\n\n\n### Areoid[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Geography of Mars \u00a7\u00a0Zero elevation, and Mars \u00a7\u00a0Geography\n\nFurther information: Vertical datum\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **areoid** is a planetary geoid that represents the gravitational and rotational equipotential figure of Mars, analogous to the concept of geoid (\"sea level\") on Earth.[5][36][37] This has been set as the reference frame for developing the MOLA Mission Experiment Gridded Data Records (MEGDRs),[5][36] which is a global topography model. The topography model is important in mapping the geomorphological features and understanding different kinds of processes on Mars.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![{\\displaystyle V({\\text{Mars}})=V({\\text{solid planet}})+V({\\text{seasonal caps}}+{\\text{atmosphere}})}](image)[8]\nIn turn, when there is more mass in the seasonal caps due to the more condensation of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the mass of the atmosphere would drop. They have inverse relationship with each other. And the change in mass has direct effect towards the measured gravitational potential.\n\n\nThe seasonal mass exchange between the northern polar cap and southern polar cap exhibits long-wavelength gravity variation with time.[8][13] Long years of continuous observation has found that the determination of even zonal, normalized gravity coefficient Cl=2, m=0, and odd zonal, normalized gravity coefficient Cl=3, m=0 are crucial for outlining the time-variable gravity due to such mass exchange,[24][8][31][32] where \n\n\n\nl\n\n\n{\\displaystyle l}\n\n![{\\displaystyle l}](image) is the degree while \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** ***x*** ***y*** ***z*** ***aa*** ***ab*** ***ac*** ***ad*** ***ae*** ***af*** ***ag*** ***ah*** ***ai*** ***aj*** ***ak*** ***al*** ***am*** ***an*** ***ao*** ***ap*** ***aq*** ***ar*** ***as*** Neumann, G.

The gravity field of Mars is described using spherical harmonic functions, and the latest gravity model for Mars is the Goddard Mars Model 3 (GMM-3), developed in 2016.\n\nTo calculate the surface gravity of Mars, the formula is:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{GM}{R_{M}^{2}} = \\frac{4r^{3}\\pi^{2}}{T^{2}R_{M}^{2}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( g \\) is the surface gravity of Mars\n- \\( G \\) is the universal constant of gravitation\n- \\( M \\) is the mass of Mars\n- \\( R_{M} \\) is the radius of Mars\n- \\( r \\) is the distance between Mars and the satellite\n- \\( T \\) is the orbiting period of the satellite\n\nThe surface gravity of Mars can be calculated using the parameters mentioned above.",

In 1845, Urbain Le Verrier began his own independent research into Uranus's orbit. On 23 September 1846, Johann Gottfried Galle located a new planet, later named Neptune, at nearly the position predicted by Le Verrier.[69]\n\n\nThe rotational period of the interior of Uranus is 17\u00a0hours, 14\u00a0minutes. As on all giant planets, its upper atmosphere experiences strong winds in the direction of rotation. At some latitudes, such as about 60 degrees south, visible features of the atmosphere move much faster, making a full rotation in as little as 14 hours.[70]\n\n\n\n### Axial tilt[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Size comparison of Earth and UranusUranus's mass is roughly 14.5 times that of Earth, making it the least massive of the giant planets. Its diameter is slightly larger than Neptune's at roughly four times that of Earth. A resulting density of 1.27\u00a0g/cm3 makes Uranus the second least dense planet, after Saturn.[11][12] This value indicates that it is made primarily of various ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane.[16] The total mass of ice in Uranus's interior is not precisely known, because different figures emerge depending on the model chosen; it must be between 9.3\u00a0and 13.5\u00a0Earth masses.[16][81] Hydrogen and helium constitute only a small part of the total, with between 0.5 and 1.5\u00a0Earth masses.[16] The remainder of the non-ice mass (0.5 to 3.7\u00a0Earth masses) is accounted for by rocky material.[16]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Uranus at European Space Agency\n* Uranus at NASA's Solar System Exploration site\n* Uranus at Jet Propulsion Laboratory's planetary photojournal (photos)\n* Voyager at Uranus Archived 4 January 2015 at the Wayback Machine (photos)\n* Uranian system montage (photo)\n* Gray, Meghan; Merrifield, Michael (2010). \"Uranus\". *Sixty Symbols*.

For instance, if substantial amounts of hydrogen and rocky material are mixed in the ice mantle, the total mass of ices in the interior will be lower, and, correspondingly, the total mass of rocks and hydrogen will be higher. Presently available data does not allow a scientific determination of which model is correct.[81] The fluid interior structure of Uranus means that it has no solid surface. The gaseous atmosphere gradually transitions into the internal liquid layers.[16] For the sake of convenience, a revolving oblate spheroid set at the point at which atmospheric pressure equals 1\u00a0bar (100 kPa) is conditionally designated as a \"surface\". It has equatorial and polar radii of 25,559\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0km (15,881.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0mi) and 24,973\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0km (15,518\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012\u00a0mi), respectively.[11] This surface is used throughout this article as a zero point for altitudes.\n\n\n\n### Internal heat[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlthough there is no well-defined solid surface within Uranus's interior, the outermost part of Uranus's gaseous envelope that is accessible to remote sensing is called its atmosphere.[17] Remote-sensing capability extends down to roughly 300\u00a0km below the 1\u00a0bar (100\u00a0kPa) level, with a corresponding pressure around 100\u00a0bar (10\u00a0MPa) and temperature of 320\u00a0K (47\u00a0\u00b0C; 116\u00a0\u00b0F).[96] The tenuous thermosphere extends over two planetary radii from the nominal surface, which is defined to lie at a pressure of 1 bar.[97] The Uranian atmosphere can be divided into three layers: the troposphere, between altitudes of \u2212300 and 50\u00a0km (\u2212186 and 31\u00a0mi) and pressures from 100 to 0.1\u00a0bar (10\u00a0MPa to 10\u00a0kPa); the stratosphere, spanning altitudes between 50 and 4,000\u00a0km (31 and 2,485\u00a0mi) and pressures of between 0.1 and 10\u221210\u00a0bar (10\u00a0kPa to 10\u00a0\u00b5Pa); and the thermosphere extending from 4,000\u00a0km to as high as 50,000\u00a0km from the surface.[17] There is no mesosphere.\n\n\n\n### Composition[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSeidelmann, P.

In 2033, the planet will have made its third complete orbit around the Sun since being discovered in 1781. The planet has returned to the point of its discovery northeast of Zeta Tauri twice since then, on 25\u00a0March\u00a01865 and 29\u00a0March\u00a01949. Uranus will return to this location again on 3\u00a0April\u00a02033. Its average distance from the Sun is roughly 20\u00a0AU (3\u00a0billion\u00a0km; 2\u00a0billion\u00a0mi). The difference between its minimum and maximum distance from the Sun is 1.8 AU, larger than that of any other planet, though not as large as that of dwarf planet Pluto.[66] The intensity of sunlight varies inversely with the square of distance, and so on Uranus (at about 20 times the distance from the Sun compared to Earth) it is about 1/400 the intensity of light on Earth.[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Pearl, J.C.; et\u00a0al.

Much of the variability is dependent upon the planetary latitudes being illuminated from the Sun and viewed from the Earth.[78] Its angular diameter is between 3.4 and 3.7\u00a0arcseconds, compared with 16 to 20\u00a0arcseconds for Saturn and 32 to 45\u00a0arcseconds for Jupiter.[79] At opposition, Uranus is visible to the naked eye in dark skies, and becomes an easy target even in urban conditions with binoculars.[7] On larger amateur telescopes with an objective diameter of between 15 and 23\u00a0cm, Uranus appears as a pale cyan disk with distinct limb darkening. With a large telescope of 25\u00a0cm or wider, cloud patterns, as well as some of the larger satellites, such as Titania and Oberon, may be visible.[80]\n\n\n\n## Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n91. **^** Shiga, David (1 September 2010). \"Weird water lurking inside giant planets\". *New Scientist*.

Based on current models, inside its volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and surrounding it is a thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Trace amounts of hydrocarbons (thought to be produced via hydrolysis) and carbon monoxide along with carbon dioxide (thought to have been originated from comets) have been detected in the upper atmosphere. There are many unexplained climate phenomena in Uranus's atmosphere, such as its peak wind speed of 900\u00a0km/h (560\u00a0mph),[22] variations in its polar cap and its erratic cloud formation. The planet also has very low internal heat compared to other giant planets, which is still unexplained. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTyler, J.L.; Sweetnam, D.N.; Anderson, J.D.; Campbell, J.

Neptune, like Uranus, is an ice giant, a subclass of giant planet, because they are smaller and have higher concentrations of volatiles than Jupiter and Saturn.[70] In the search for exoplanets, Neptune has been used as a metonym: discovered bodies of similar mass are often referred to as \"Neptunes\",[71] just as scientists refer to various extrasolar bodies as \"Jupiters\".\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Extraterrestrial diamonds\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Miner, Ellis D.; Wessen, Randii R.

Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23\u00a0September 1846[1] by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 14 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th\u00a0century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Yeomans, Donald K. \"HORIZONS Web-Interface for Neptune Barycenter (Major Body=8)\".

It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17\u00a0times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8\u00a0years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5\u00a0billion kilometres; 2.8\u00a0billion miles).

Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO).[162][163][164] The first scientifically useful observation of Neptune from ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics was commenced in 1997 from Hawaii.[165] Neptune is currently approaching perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) and has been shown to be heating up, with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence. Combined with technological advancements, ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of it. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n117. **^** Pearl, J.C.; Conrath, B.J.

Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600\u00a0nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus, this absorption of red light by atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue,[82] although Neptune's blue differs from Uranus's milder light blue due to concentrated haze in the latter atmosphere.[83]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of the *Voyager\u00a02* flyby in 1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. In 2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied.[26] These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100\u00a0km/h (580\u00a0m/s; 1,300\u00a0mph).[27] Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55\u00a0K (\u2212218\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212361\u00a0\u00b0F). Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately 5,400\u00a0K (5,100\u00a0\u00b0C; 9,300\u00a0\u00b0F).[28][29] Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled \"arcs\"), which was discovered in 1984, then later confirmed by *Voyager 2*.[30]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Discovery[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBoth *Hubble* and the adaptive-optics telescopes on Earth have made many new discoveries within the Solar System since the mid-1990s, with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the outer planet, among others. In 2004 and 2005, five new small satellites of Neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered.[166]\n\n\nFrom Earth, Neptune goes through apparent retrograde motion every 367\u00a0days, resulting in a looping motion against the background stars during each opposition. These loops carried it close to the 1846 discovery coordinates in April and July 2010 and again in October and November 2011.[122]\n\n\nNeptune's 164-year orbital period means that the planet takes an average of 13 years to move through each constellation of the zodiac. In 2011, it completed its first full orbit of the Sun since being discovered and returned to where it was first spotted northeast of Iota Aquarii.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n92. **^** Stanley, Sabine; Bloxham, Jeremy (11 March 2004). \"Convective-region geometry as the cause of Uranus' and Neptune's unusual magnetic fields\". *Nature*. **428** (6979): 151\u201353.

Before *Voyager 2*'s arrival at Neptune, it was hypothesised that Uranus's tilted magnetosphere was the result of its sideways rotation. In comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets, scientists now think the extreme orientation may be characteristic of flows in the planets' interiors. This field may be generated by convective fluid motions in a thin spherical shell of electrically conducting liquids (probably a combination of ammonia, methane and water)[85] resulting in a dynamo action.[92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Villard, Ray; Devitt, Terry (15 May 2003). \"Brighter Neptune Suggests A Planetary Change of Seasons\".

Bibcode:2000DPS....32.0903S.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe dipole component of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14\u00a0microteslas (0.14\u00a0G).[93] The dipole magnetic moment of Neptune is about 2.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01017\u00a0T\u00b7m3 (14\u00a0\u03bcT\u00b7*R**N*3, where *R**N* is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of Neptune may be the result of an offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.[94][95]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
