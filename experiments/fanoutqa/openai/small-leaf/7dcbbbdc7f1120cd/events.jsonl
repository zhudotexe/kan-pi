Unlike most professional sports, MLB does not permit the trading of draft picks,[1] so the draft order is solely determined by the previous season's standings; the team that possesses the worst record receives the first pick.[2] If two teams have identical records, the team with the worse record in the previous season will receive the higher pick.[2] In addition, teams that lost free agents in the previous off-season may be awarded \"compensatory\" picks.[2] The first draft took place in 1965; it was introduced to prevent richer teams from negotiating wealthier contracts with top-level prospects and therefore, monopolizing the player market.[3] Originally, three drafts were held each year. The first draft took place in June and involved high-school graduates and college seniors who had just finished their seasons. The second draft took place in January for high school and college players who had graduated in December. The third draft took place in August and was for players who participated in American amateur summer leagues.[4] The August draft was eliminated after two years, and the January draft lasted until 1986.[5]\n\n\nIn 1965, Rick Monday became MLB's first draft pick after being selected by the Kansas City Athletics. Paul Skenes is the most recent first overall pick; he was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2023. Overall, 23 of the 50 picks before 2015 have participated in the All-Star Game, and four (Bob Horner, Darryl Strawberry, Bryce Harper, and Carlos Correa) have won the Rookie of the Year Award. Twenty-five of the fifty picks before 2015 have been drafted from high schools, one has been drafted out of the Independent American Association, and the others were drafted from universities. To date, Arizona State University , Vanderbilt University , and Louisiana State University are the only schools from which multiple number-one overall draft picks have been chosen. No first overall pick was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame until 2016, when Ken Griffey Jr. was inducted with a record 99.3 percent of votes cast.[6] Griffey has since been joined by two other top picks: Chipper Jones, inducted in 2018;[7] and Harold Baines, elected in December 2018 and inducted in July 2019.[8]\n\n\nIn the 58 drafts that have taken place through 2022, 22 of the 30 MLB franchises have had the first pick at least once. The Toronto Blue Jays, St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Francisco Giants, Cleveland Guardians, Cincinnati Reds, Boston Red Sox, and Colorado Rockies have never had the first pick. The Montreal Expos never had the first pick, but the Nationals, their successor, have had it twice. The Oakland Athletics have never had the first pick, but the Kansas City Athletics, their predecessor, had the first pick in MLB draft history. The Pittsburgh Pirates have had the first overall pick a record six times, while the New York Mets, San Diego Padres, and Houston Astros have each had the first overall pick five times.\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ‡\n | Member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame |\n| \\*\n | All-Star |\n| ៛ | Rookie of the Year and All-Star |\n| # | Retired without playing a game in MLB\n |\n| ° | Player did not sign\n |\n| *Italics* | Active player\n |\n\n\n## First overall picks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rick Monday, the 1965 first overall pick\n![](image)Harold Baines, the 1977 first overall pick\n![](image)Chipper Jones, the 1990 first overall pick\n![](image)Alex Rodriguez, the 1993 first overall pick\n![](image)Pat Burrell, the 1998 first overall pick\n![](image)Joe Mauer, the 2001 first overall pick\n\n\n| Year\n | Player\n | Team\n | Position\n | Club/School\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1965 | Rick Monday\\*\n | Kansas City Athletics | Outfielder | Arizona State University |\n| 1966 | Steve Chilcott# | New York Mets | Catcher | Antelope Valley High School(Lancaster, California) |\n| 1967 | Ron Blomberg | New York Yankees | First baseman | Druid Hills High School(Druid Hills, Georgia) |\n| 1968 | Tim Foli | New York Mets | Shortstop | Notre Dame High School(Sherman Oaks, California) |\n| 1969 | Jeff Burroughs\\*\n | Washington Senators | Outfielder | Woodrow Wilson Classical High School(Long Beach, California) |\n| 1970 | Mike Ivie | San Diego Padres | Catcher | Walker High School(Atlanta, Georgia) |\n| 1971 | Danny Goodwin°\n | Chicago White Sox | Catcher | Peoria High School(Peoria, Illinois) |\n| 1972 | Dave Roberts | San Diego Padres | Third baseman | University of Oregon |\n| 1973 | David Clyde | Texas Rangers | Left-handed pitcher | Westchester High School(Houston, Texas) |\n| 1974 | Bill Almon | San Diego Padres | Shortstop | Brown University |\n| 1975 | Danny Goodwin [a] | California Angels | Catcher | Southern University |\n| 1976 | Floyd Bannister\\*\n | Houston Astros | Left-handed pitcher | Arizona State University |\n| 1977 | Harold Baines‡\\*\n | Chicago White Sox | Outfielder | St. Michaels Middle/High School(St. Michaels, Maryland) |\n| 1978 | Bob Horner៛ | Atlanta Braves | Third baseman | Arizona State University |\n| 1979 | Al Chambers | Seattle Mariners | Outfielder | John Harris High School(Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) |\n| 1980 | Darryl Strawberry៛ | New York Mets | Outfielder | Crenshaw High School(Los Angeles, California) |\n| 1981 | Mike Moore\\*\n | Seattle Mariners | Right-handed pitcher | Oral Roberts University |\n| 1982 | Shawon Dunston\\*\n | Chicago Cubs | Shortstop | Thomas Jefferson High School(Brooklyn, New York) |\n| 1983 | Tim Belcher°\n | Minnesota Twins | Right-handed pitcher | Mount Vernon Nazarene University |\n| 1984 | Shawn Abner | New York Mets | Outfielder | Mechanicsburg Area Senior High School(Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania) |\n| 1985 | B.J.

On April 12, 2012, it was announced that Philadelphia would sign him to a one-day contract, in order that he could finish his career as a Phillie. On May 19, 2012, at Citizens Bank Park, prior to the Phillies-Boston Red Sox game, Burrell threw out the ceremonial first pitch and subsequently retired.[2]\n\n\nIn March 2012, Burrell was named as a special assignment scout for the Giants and an assistant to General Manager (GM) Brian Sabean.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter graduating from high school in 1995, Burrell was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 43rd round of the 1995 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft.[1] Instead of signing, he chose to attend the University of Miami, where he played third base and was a teammate of Aubrey Huff.[7] As a freshman, he was selected as a First-Team All-American by *Baseball America* and the *Collegiate Baseball Newspaper*. He was also named the Most Outstanding Player of the 1996 College World Series, joining Dave Winfield and Phil Nevin as the only players to win the award without winning the series. In the summer of 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Hyannis Mets and was named a league all-star.[8][9] In his sophomore year, he was again named a First-Team All-American by *Baseball America* and the *Collegiate Baseball Newspaper* but also by the *Sporting News* this year. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBurrell hit his third career grand slam.[37] He had a home run and three RBI in the final game of the season in a 4–1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.[38] Burrell finished the season with 27 home runs, 70 RBI, and a .258 batting average in 155 games. His 18 assists led NL outfielders and tied with Raúl Mondesí for most in the major leagues.[6] However, his 162 strikeouts were the third-highest total in Phillies' history at the time, and they currently are the ninth-highest total.[39]\n\n\n\n#### 2002[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBurrell batted .256 with 30 home runs in 2007 as the Phillies reached the playoffs for the first time in his career.

Currently, he is the manager of the Brookhaven Bucks[2] in the Sunbelt Baseball League. He is the older brother of infielder Eric Patterson, and the son of former NFL defensive back Don Patterson.\n\n\n\n\n## Amateur career[edit]\n\n\nPatterson attended Harrison High School in Kennesaw, Georgia,[1] and helped Harrison win the Georgia state championship as a senior in 1998.[*citation needed*] That year, he had a batting average of .528 with 81 runs scored, 22 home runs, 61 RBI and 38 stolen bases in 38 games.[*citation needed*] Patterson was named to the *Baseball America* and *USA Today* first-team All-America teams, and was selected by USA Baseball as its Amateur Player of the Year and as the Baseball Coaches Association's co-national high school Player of the Year.[*citation needed*] Patterson was also named a *Baseball America* second-team selection after his junior season.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Chicago Cubs[edit]\n\n\nPatterson was selected by the Chicago Cubs as the third overall pick in the 1998 Major League Baseball draft.[1] He made his professional debut in 1999 with the Lansing Lugnuts of the Class-A Midwest League, and won the league's Prospect of the Year Award after leading the circuit in slugging percentage (.592), extra base hits (72) and triples (17). He also batted .320 with 20 homers and 79 RBI, and was named to the league's all-star team both at mid-season and postseason. *Baseball America* named Patterson the league's top prospect.[3] After the 1999 season, he played in the Arizona Fall League and was that league's youngest player. He batted .368 with 4 home runs, 24 RBI, and 8 stolen bases in 35 games, and was named to the league's all-star team.\n\n\nIn 2000, Patterson was promoted to the Double-A West Tenn Diamond Jaxx of the Southern League. He was named to the league's mid-season and postseason all-star team, and was named the league's top prospect by *Baseball America*.[*citation needed*] Patterson batted .268 with 22 home runs and 82 RBI, finishing second in the league in home runs.\n\n\nAfter playing in the 2000 Southern League playoffs, Patterson was called up from the minors to play for the Cubs. He made his Major League debut on September 18, 2000, against the Milwaukee Brewers. The next day Patterson recorded his first Major League hit, a home run off Juan Acevedo. He finished the 2000 season with seven hits in 42 at bats, and two home runs.\n\n\nPatterson did not start playing a full season until 2002, when he finished with a .253 batting average. In 2003, he batted .298 with 55 RBI in only 83 games before suffering a torn ACL while running to first on a base hit against the St. Louis Cardinals on July 6. The injury ended Patterson's 2003 campaign.[4]\n\n\nPatterson played 157 games in 2004, with a .266 batting average, 24 home runs, and 72 RBI in 631 at-bats. His on-base plus slugging of .771, while only average, is his best of the six seasons in which he played more than 83 games.[*citation needed*] He had the lowest range factor (2.18) among all starting Major League center fielders in 2004.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn the 2005 season Patterson did not do well. On July 7, he was sent down to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. The demotion came after the Cubs had lost a season-high eight games in a row. Published reports indicated that center fielder Félix Pie, the Cubs' top prospect, was slated to be called up from Double-A West Tenn in July when Patterson was sent down.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPatterson was back up with the Major League team on August 9, after his one-month stint in Triple-A Iowa.\n\n\n\n![](image)Patterson batting for the Baltimore Orioles in 2007.\n### Baltimore Orioles[edit]\n\n\nPatterson was traded by the Cubs to the Orioles on January 9, 2006, for Class-A Minor league players Nate Spears and Carlos Perez.[1] On February 10, 2007, Patterson signed a 1-year deal worth $4.3 million to avoid arbitration.[5] In his first of two years with the Orioles, he batted .276 with 16 home runs and 53 RBI. He also stole 45 bases, which ranked third in the American League. Patterson's contract was not renewed after the 2007 season.\n\n\n\n### Cincinnati Reds[edit]\n\n\nOn March 3, 2008, the Cincinnati Reds signed Patterson to a minor league contract. At the end of Spring training, he was added to the 40-man roster.[6] Dusty Baker, manager of the Reds and Patterson's manager in Chicago, was instrumental in signing Patterson.[6] Baker often voiced his opinion on Patterson saying he thought Patterson is still a developing player.[7]\n\n\nPatterson was invited to the Reds' spring training camp, and he started the 2008 season in center field for Cincinnati. Platooning with utility man Ryan Freel, Patterson began the season well. Gradually his average deteriorated, culminating in an 0–8 performance during Cincinnati's 18-inning loss to San Diego on May 25.[*citation needed*] The following day top outfield prospect Jay Bruce was called up from the Triple-A Louisville Bats to start in center field, demoting Patterson to the Reds' bench. On May 28, Patterson accepted a reassignment to Triple-A Louisville.[8] The demotion lasted only one week, however, when Patterson was recalled to replace Ryan Freel, who went to the disabled list with a strained right hamstring on June 4.[9][10] Patterson ended the season with a .205 batting average and .238 OBP.\n\n\n\n### Washington Nationals[edit]\n\n\nOn December 18, 2008, Patterson signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Washington Nationals.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDue to Josh Willingham being placed on the bereavement list, Patterson had his contract purchased from the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs on June 13, 2009.[11] He hit .302, with six home runs and 23 RBIs in a 39 games with the Chiefs, but hit only .133 with 2 stolen bases in 5 games for the Nationals. He was reassigned to Triple-A on June 20, 2009.[11] He was released by the Nationals on July 29, 2009.[12]\n\n\n\n### Milwaukee Brewers[edit]\n\n\nPatterson signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers on August 1, 2009.[13] Patterson hit well with the AAA affiliate Nashville Sound, batting .331 with a .963 OPS over 29 games and 124 at-bats. However, he struggled with the parent club, where his BA, OBP, and SLG were all .071 over 11 games and 14 at-bats.[14]\n\n\n\n### Seattle Mariners[edit]\n\n\nPatterson signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners on December 9, 2009.[15] However, he opted out of his contract on March 31, 2010, after being informed he had not made the Major League team.[16]\n\n\n\n### Return to Baltimore[edit]\n\n\nOn April 21, 2010, Corey agreed to re-join the Orioles on a 1-year minor league deal. He was promoted to the Orioles on May 12, 2010.\n\n\nOn July 9, 2010, Patterson hit his first career grand slam against the Texas Rangers. It was a remarkable feat as Patterson faced the season's eventual saves leader and rookie of the year in the hard throwing Neftalí Feliz, with a 2–2 count and two outs in the top of the 9th inning representing the tying run. Patterson drilled his pitch over the right field fence to tie the game at 6. Jake Fox hit a solo homer in the top of the 10th for the game winner.\n\n\n\n### Toronto Blue Jays[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Patterson with the Toronto Blue Jays\nOn December 21, 2010, Patterson signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Toronto Blue Jays.[17] He began the season on the Major League roster, but on the disabled list because of a head injury.[18]\nPatterson made his regular season debut as a Blue Jay on April 11, 2011, against the Seattle Mariners, hitting a home run and finishing the night 2–4 with 2 RBI\n\n\n\n### St. Louis Cardinals[edit]\n\n\nOn July 27, 2011, Patterson was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals with Octavio Dotel, Marc Rzepczynski and Edwin Jackson for Colby Rasmus, P. J. Walters, Trever Miller and Brian Tallet.[19][20]\n\n\n\n### Return to Milwaukee[edit]\n\n\nOn January 30, 2012, Patterson signed a minor league contract to return to the Brewers organization. He played 117 games for Nashville Sounds, the AAA team of the Brewers, batting .251 with 39 RBI in 390 plate appearances. For the first season since his Major League debut, he did not play in the Major Leagues.\n\n\n\n### New York Mets[edit]\n\n\nHe signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets in February 2013. The Mets released Patterson in March 2013.[21]\n\n\n\n### Seattle Mariners[edit]\n\n\nHe signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners on April 30, 2013, but was released on June 6, after hitting only .175 in 19 games for the AAA Tacoma Rainiers.\n\n\n\n### New York Yankees[edit]\n\n\nPatterson signed a minor league deal with the New York Yankees on June 21, 2013. He elected free agency on November 4, 2013.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![icon](image)Baseball portal\n\n\n* List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Corey Patterson Stats & Scouting Report - Baseball America\". *www.baseballamerica.com*.

He is a two-time All-Star.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMark Alan Mulder was born on August 5, 1977, in South Holland, Illinois.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nMulder attended Michigan State University, where he played college baseball for the Michigan State Spartans.[1] In 1997, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Bourne Braves, and was named a league all-star.[2]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Draft and minor leagues[edit]\n\n\nMulder was selected by the Oakland Athletics with the second overall pick in the 1998 MLB draft.[3]\n\n\n\n### Oakland Athletics (2000–2004)[edit]\n\n\nHe was placed on the fast track[*clarification needed*] to MLB and made his MLB debut on April 18, 2000; he was still only 22 years old and had less than two seasons of minor-league experience. He had a rocky start to his MLB career, going 9–10 with a 5.44 ERA.\n\n\nIn 2001, Mulder played his first full major-league season and quickly became a dominant pitcher. Leading the American League with 21 wins, he anchored a powerful Oakland rotation along with Barry Zito and Tim Hudson, called \"The Big Three\".[*citation needed*] Mulder finished second in AL Cy Young Award voting behind Roger Clemens. He continued to do well in 2002, winning 19 games and striking out a career-high 159 batters in 207.1 innings. Limited by injuries in 2003, he would only log 26 starts, he still won 15 games and had a career-best 3.13 ERA. 2004 was an inconsistent year for Mulder. He started the season strong, and was chosen to start that season's All-Star Game. However, he had a higher ERA and walked more batters in the second half of the season.\n\n\nMulder, Hudson, and Zito were able to carry their team to the postseason four seasons in a row (2000–2003). Mulder competed in the playoffs in 2001 and 2002, logging two starts each against the New York Yankees (2001) and the Minnesota Twins (2002). He carried over his strong regular-season performance by pitching 24 innings in the four playoff starts, with an ERA of 2.25 and 19 strikeouts.\n\n\n\n### St. Louis Cardinals (2005–2008)[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 2004 season, the Athletics traded Mulder to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for Dan Haren, Kiko Calero, and Daric Barton.[4] In the 2005 season, Mulder's first with the Cardinals, he pitched well, 16–8 with a 3.64 ERA. His efforts helped the Cardinals reach the NLCS, where they lost to the Houston Astros.[5]\n\n\nMulder began the 2006 season strong, with a 5–1 record and 3.69 ERA through May 17. However, his next six starts were mediocre to awful, and his ERA ballooned to 6.09. He turned out to be suffering from rotator cuff and shoulder problems, and the Cardinals placed him on the disabled list on June 23. In August, he was taken off the disabled list and made several starts in the minors. On August 23, he made his first major-league start in two months and gave up nine runs, all of which were earned, in three innings.\n\n\nAfter undergoing rotator cuff surgery, and with a return for the opening of the 2007 season unlikely, Mulder's future with the Cardinals looked somewhat uncertain in the 2007 offseason. However, despite being offered comparable deals with the Cleveland Indians and the Texas Rangers, Mulder re-signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on January 10, to a two-year $13 million contract, with performance-based incentives and a club option that could take the deal to three years at a possible $45 million.\n\n\nAfter being re-activated on September 5, 2007, he continued to struggle with his command, losing all three of his starts with an ERA of 12.27. In that time, he pitched only 11 innings, and gave up 22 hits and seven walks. This prompted an MRI scan, which led the team to the conclusion that Mulder needed additional clean-up rotator cuff surgery. Although he was expected to recover from surgery in time for Spring training, Mark started the 2008 season on the disabled list. On June 30, 2008, Mulder made his return. He came in from the bullpen with a 7–1 lead over the New York Mets in the top of the ninth. Mulder finished the ballgame with no runs. On July 9, 2008, Mulder started his first game of the season against the Philadelphia Phillies. After striking out Jimmy Rollins to begin the game, Mulder threw eight consecutive pitches out of the strike zone, and left the game with a shoulder injury while attempting a pickoff throw.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter the 2008 season, the Cardinals chose not to exercise Mulder's $11 million option for the 2009 season, instead buying out his contract for $1.5 million.[6] After remaining unsigned, Mulder announced his retirement on June 15, 2010, saying \"I guess I have retired.\"[7]\n\n\n\n### 2014 comeback attempt[edit]\n\n\nWhile watching the 2013 MLB postseason, Mulder began to mimic the throwing motion of Paco Rodriguez, and felt the hand separation at the top of the delivery felt natural.[8] Mulder began auditioning for teams in November 2013.[9] On January 1, 2014, Mulder came to terms with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training.[9]\n\n\nMulder expressed going into spring training that his shoulder felt strong, but wondered about the susceptibility of his lower back and legs to injury. On February 15, Mulder tore his achilles tendon. He suffered the injury in agility drills on the second day of spring training, before he was scheduled to throw his first bullpen session.[8] The Angels released Mulder on March 11.\n\n\n\n### Accomplishments[edit]\n\n\n* Led American League in wins in 2001 (21)\n* Led American League pitchers in complete games in 2003 (9) and 2004 (5)\n* Led American League in shutouts in 2001 (4) and 2003 (2)\n* American League All-Star, 2003 and 2004\n\n\n## Post-playing career[edit]\n\n\nAfter first retiring from baseball, Mulder pursued golf.[10] He won the 2015 American Century Championship, considered to be the ‘premier’ celebrity golf tournament. He won it again in 2016, successfully defending his title. On July 16, 2017, he won his third straight American Century Championship. In October 2018, he played in a PGA Tour event, the Safeway Open, via a sponsor's invitation.[11]\n\n\nMulder is annually one of the contenders at what is now the Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions. He won the celebrity division in 2017.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHe also served as an analyst on ESPN's *Baseball Tonight*,[12] and as part-time analyst for Athletics telecasts on NBC Sports California in 2016 and 2017.[13]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![icon](image)Baseball portal\n\n\n* List of Major League Baseball annual wins leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Michigan State's Mark Mulder Named to Baseball All-America Squad – Michigan State Official Athletic Site\".

In June he signed a $7 million contract,[5] then hit .316 through 26 games with the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds. He was recalled by the Cardinals and made his debut on September 8, 1998—the game in which teammate Mark McGwire broke the single-season home run record previously held by Roger Maris. Drew's first at bat, in the sixth inning, resulted in a strikeout, and he finished the night 0-for-2. He ended up going 15-for-36 (.417) during 1998, with five home runs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the 2009 season, Drew's statistics began to decline. That year, he hit .279 with an .392 OBP while hitting 24 home runs and 68 RBI. The following year, he hit .255 with 22 home runs with 68 RBI. However, he played in 139 games, his highest total since 2007 when he joined Boston. In 2011, Drew hit .222 with four home runs and 22 RBI. He played in 81 games and had a .315 OBP. Drew retired from professional baseball at the end of the 2011 season.[25]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDrew's younger brother Tim was also drafted in the first round in 1997, making them the first brothers drafted in the first round of the MLB draft in the same year.[26] They were teammates while on the Atlanta Braves in 2004. J. D., Tim, and their brother Stephen all played in Major League Baseball. J. D. and Stephen each won a World Series with the Boston Red Sox; J. D. in 2007 and Stephen in 2013.\n\n\nDrew married his girlfriend Sheigh, on November 10, 2001, in Hahira, Georgia. Drew is a Christian.[27]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"J. D. Drew Stats, News, Photos – Boston Red Sox\". *ESPN*.

Roughly halfway through the 2005 season, Drew's season was again cut short after being hit on the wrist by a pitch from Arizona Diamondbacks' pitcher Brad Halsey.\n\n\nOn September 18, 2006, Drew was part of only the (then) fourth-ever set of back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs with fellow Dodgers Jeff Kent, Russell Martin, and Marlon Anderson.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring his college career, Drew broke 17 school and conference records.[3][4]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 1997: Drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies[edit]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies made Drew the second overall pick, after pitcher Matt Anderson, in the 1997 MLB draft. Drew and his agent Scott Boras chose not to sign with the Phillies, insisting Drew would not sign for less than $10 million. The Phillies had no plan to pay an unproven player this amount of money, and despite Boras' warnings, drafted Drew nonetheless. They offered him $2.6 million.[5] Consequently, Drew ended up playing for the St. Paul Saints of the independent Northern League. Boras had Drew sign with an independent baseball league because of a loophole in the rules of the MLB draft.[6]\n\n\n\n### 1998–2003: St. Louis Cardinals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** Waggoner, Jim (January 29, 2009). \"Marquis looking ahead to baseball season with Colorado Rockies\". *Staten Island Advance*.

In an attempt to confuse the Philadelphia fans, he did not wear his own jersey that night, which instead was worn by bullpen catcher, Jeff Murphy. The attempt failed, however, and he was booed and heckled throughout batting practice. The only time he received cheers was when he booted three consecutive grounders in the outfield while his teammates were taking batting practice.[7] On August 10, 1999, in Drew's first game at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, he was booed loudly, and even had batteries thrown at him by two fans. The Phillie Phanatic got into the act, dropping two large trash bags marked with dollar signs in the outfield between innings.[8] Drew struggled to stay healthy, landing on the disabled list every season he played in St. Louis.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2006, Drew exercised his contract opt-out clause, forgoing $33 million over the next three years to become a free agent. Dodgers general manager Ned Colletti said in a teleconference that he was \"surprised how it came down. Everything we had heard, everything that had been written led us to believe the player loved being here.\"[14][15] This was especially a surprise because a few days before, Drew had told an *LA Times* columnist on how happy he was in LA and that he was looking forward to the upcoming 2007 season. Drew had a very good season, batting .284 with 20 home runs and 100 RBI.\n\n\n\n### 2007–2011: Boston Red Sox[edit]\n\n\nOn January 26, 2007, Drew officially signed a five-year contract with the Red Sox worth $70 million. Drew's revised contract had a clause that allowed the Red Sox to opt out of Drew's five-year contract after three or four years if Drew has extensive injuries due to a previously existing problem in his right shoulder.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1998 Major League Baseball draft first round selections\n |\n| --- |\n| * Pat Burrell\n* Mark Mulder\n* Corey Patterson\n* Jeff Austin\n* J.

La Russa tells Bissinger that it seems Drew had decided to \"settle for 75%\" of his talent, in large part because of his enormous contract.[9]\n\n\n\n### 2004: Atlanta Braves[edit]\n\n\nOn December 13, 2003, Drew was traded to the Atlanta Braves along with catcher Eli Marrero for starting pitcher Jason Marquis, relief pitcher Ray King, and rookie prospect Adam Wainwright.[10][11] There, he had the best season of his career while finally managing to stay healthy. In 2004, he displayed excellent power, patience, and defense, hitting .305 with 31 home runs, 118 walks, and 93 RBI, finishing sixth in the MVP voting.\n\n\n\n![](image)Drew in 2002\n### 2005–2006: Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1997 Major League Baseball draft first round selections\n |\n| --- |\n| * Matt Anderson\n* J.

According to the ESPN Home Run Tracker, it was measured at 460 feet. He finished with a .280 average, with an OBP of .408 and a slugging percentage of .519.[18] At the end of June, Drew was named the AL Player of the Month after hitting .337 and hitting 12 home runs while taking over for David Ortiz's three-spot in the lineup while he was on the disabled list.[20] Drew was officially announced as an AL All-Star reserve on July 6. This was Drew's first All-Star game appearance. He hit a two-run homer in his first at-bat as an All-Star en route to winning the game's MVP award. In what was to become the longest All-Star Game time-wise in MLB history, the American League (and Drew's Red Sox) manager Terry Francona, having almost run out of pitchers, contemplated putting Drew, a former high school hurler, on the mound to close the game. \"I'd have been ready,\" Drew said. \"I've had an opportunity to throw a lot in the outfield. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| J.

At Florida State, he was the winner of the 1997 Dick Howser Trophy and the 1997 Golden Spikes Award, was named the 1997 Collegiate Baseball Player of the Year, the 1997 Sporting News Player of the Year, and was a consensus All-American (1997). He also was named the 1997 ACC Player of the Year. He was a 1996 member of Team USA. Drew was First Team in 1996, Freshman All-American in 1995 and was named to the College World Series All Tournament Team in 1995. He was the first player in college baseball history to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in the same season. He set a Florida State record by batting .455 in 1997 while becoming one of only three players in college baseball history to have 100 hits, 100 runs and 100 RBIs. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDrew was again part of a set of four consecutive home runs on April 22, 2007, in a game against the New York Yankees, this time joining with Manny Ramírez, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek.[17] He is the only player to participate twice in a string of four straight home runs, and he was the second player to go deep in each instance. Drew finished the 2007 season with a .270 batting average, 11 home runs, and 64 RBI.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Drew celebrating a Red Sox 2008 playoff victory\nOn October 20, 2007, Drew hit a grand slam in Game 6 of the 2007 ALCS with the Red Sox facing elimination.[19] The home run, along with brother Stephen Drew's for the Arizona Diamondbacks, marks the third time that two brothers have both hit home runs in the same postseason.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nI don't know if I would have gotten anyone out, but I'd have thrown something up there.\"[21] Drew later visited the 15-day disabled list, spending from August 27 to September 8 on the DL with a strained lower back.[22][19]\n\n\nOn October 3, in Game 2 of the 2008 American League Division Series against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Drew hit a go-ahead two-run home run.[23] On October 16, in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series against the Tampa Bay Rays, Drew helped to bring the Red Sox back from a late-inning seven-run deficit with a two-run home run in the eighth inning and then delivered the walk-off hit in the ninth. The Game 5 comeback, sparked by Drew, is the second-biggest in postseason history and is the largest for a team on the brink of elimination.[24] However, the Red Sox lost to the Rays in the seventh game.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSt. Louis Cardinals first-round draft picks\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1965: DiFabio\n* 1966: Lee\n* 1967: Simmons\n* 1968: Hairston\n* 1969: Minott\n* 1970: Browning\n* 1971: Kurpiel\n* 1972: Larson\n* 1973: Edelen\n* 1974: Templeton\n* 1975: Johnson\n* 1976: Durham\n* 1977: T.
