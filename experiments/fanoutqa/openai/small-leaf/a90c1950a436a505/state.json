While serving as \"bed towns\" for those working in central Tokyo, some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base, such as Tachikawa. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama area or Western Tokyo. The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district (*gun*) of Nishi-Tama. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, Mount Kumotori, is 2,017\u00a0m (6,617\u00a0ft) high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takanosu (1,737\u00a0m (5,699\u00a0ft)), Odake (1,266\u00a0m (4,154\u00a0ft)), and Mitake (929\u00a0m (3,048\u00a0ft)). Lake Okutama, on the Tama River near Yamanashi Prefecture, is Tokyo's largest lake. The district is composed of three towns (Hinode, Mizuho and Okutama) and one village (Hinohara). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A satellite photo of Tokyo in 2018 taken by ESA Sentinel-2\n![](image)The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90\u00a0km (56\u00a0mi) east to west and 25\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40\u00a0m (131\u00a0ft).[49] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (\u591a\u6469\u5730\u57df) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnnual rainfall averages nearly 1,600 millimeters (63.0\u00a0in), with a wetter summer and a drier winter. The growing season in Tokyo lasts for about 322 days from around mid-February to early January.[71] Snowfall is sporadic, and occurs almost annually.[72] Tokyo often sees typhoons every year, though few are strong. The wettest month since records began in 1876 was October 2004, with 780 millimeters (30\u00a0in) of rain,[73] including 270.5\u00a0mm (10.65\u00a0in) on the ninth of that month.[74] The most recent of four months on record to observe no precipitation is December 1995.[70] Annual precipitation has ranged from 879.5\u00a0mm (34.63\u00a0in) in 1984 to 2,229.6\u00a0mm (87.78\u00a0in) in 1938.[70]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n76. **^** \"47662: Tokyo (Japan)\". *ogimet.com*.

Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.[87] Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[87] Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[13] Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023. The project will cost 580\u00a0billion yen ($5.5\u00a0billion).[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe former city of Tokyo and the majority of Tokyo prefecture lie in the humid subtropical climate zone (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: *Cfa*),[69] with hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters with occasional cold spells. The region, like much of Japan, experiences a one-month seasonal lag. The warmest month is August, which averages 26.9\u00a0\u00b0C (80.4\u00a0\u00b0F). The coolest month is January, averaging 5.4\u00a0\u00b0C (41.7\u00a0\u00b0F). The record low temperature was \u22129.2\u00a0\u00b0C (15.4\u00a0\u00b0F) on January 13, 1876. The record high was 39.5\u00a0\u00b0C (103.1\u00a0\u00b0F) on July 20, 2004. \nThe record highest low temperature is 30.3\u00a0\u00b0C (86.5\u00a0\u00b0F), on August 12, 2013, making Tokyo one of only seven observation sites in Japan that have recorded a low temperature over 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86.0\u00a0\u00b0F).[70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** \"Population of Tokyo, Japan\". *Mongabay*.

There is a low risk of eruption. The last recorded was the H\u014dei eruption which started on December 16, 1707, and ended about January 1, 1708 (16 days).[64] During the H\u014dei eruption, the ash amount was 4\u00a0cm in southern Tokyo (bay area) and 2\u00a0cm to 0.5\u00a0cm in central Tokyo.[65] Kanagawa had 16\u00a0cm to 8\u00a0cm ash and Saitama 0.5 to 0\u00a0cm.[65] If the wind blows north-east it could send volcanic ash to Tokyo metropolis.[66] According to the government, less than a millimeter of the volcanic ash from a Mount Fuji eruption could cause power grid problems such as blackouts and stop trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area.[66] A mixture of ash with rain could stick to cellphone antennas, power lines and cause temporary power outages.[66] The affected areas would need to be evacuated.[66]\n\n\n\n### Water management[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTokyo is a major international finance center;[100] it houses the headquarters of several of the world's largest investment banks and insurance companies, and serves as a hub for Japan's transportation, publishing, electronics and broadcasting industries. During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n91. **^** Toshiaki Ichinose, Kazuhiro Shimodozono, and Keisuke Hanaki.

The city is bordered on its northern, western, and southern sides by the state of Haryana and to the east by that of Uttar Pradesh (UP). Two prominent features of the geography of Delhi are the Yamuna flood plains and the Delhi ridge. The Yamuna River was the historical boundary between Punjab and UP, and its flood plains provide fertile alluvial soil suitable for agriculture but are prone to recurrent floods. The Yamuna, a sacred river in Hinduism, is the only major river flowing through Delhi. The Hindon River separates Ghaziabad from the eastern part of Delhi. The Delhi ridge originates from the Aravalli Range in the south and encircles the west, northeast, and northwest parts of the city. It reaches a height of 318\u00a0m (1,043\u00a0ft) and is a dominant feature of the region.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"new delhi (safdarjung) extreme weather events in the month of april\" (PDF).

The network consists of 10 colour-coded lines[193] serving 255 stations[c] with a total length of 348.12 kilometres (216.31\u00a0mi).[d] The system has a mix of underground, at-grade, and elevated stations using both broad-gauge and standard-gauge. All stations have escalators, lifts, and tactile tiles to guide the visually impaired from station entrances to trains. There are 18 designated parking sites at the Metro stations. In March 2010, DMRC partnered with Google India (through Google Transit) to provide train schedule and route information to mobile devices with Google Maps.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDelhi features a dry winter humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen *Cwa*) bordering a hot semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen *BSh*).

It borders the provinces of Zhejiang to the south and Jiangsu to the west and north.[74] The municipality's northernmost point is on Chongming Island, which is the second-largest island in mainland China after its expansion during the 20th century.[75] It does not administratively include an exclave of Jiangsu on northern Chongming or the two islands forming Shanghai's Yangshan Port, which are parts of Zhejiang's Shengsi County.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\u4e0a\u6d77\n |\n| --- |\n| Municipality\n |\n| Municipality of Shanghai |\n| ![](image)\nSkyline of the Lujiazui and the Huangpu River\n![](image)\nYu Garden\n![](image)\nOld City of Shanghai\n![](image)\nShanghai Exhibition Centre\n![](image)\nNanjing Road\n![](image)\nHSBC Building at The Bund\n![](image)\nJing'an Temple\n |\n| Etymology: \u4e0a\u6d77\u6d66 (*Sh\u00e0ngh\u0103i P\u01d4*)\"The original name of the Huangpu River.\" |\n| ![Map](image) |\n| ![Location of Shanghai Municipality in China](image)Location of Shanghai Municipality in China\n |\n| Coordinates (People's Square): 31\u00b013\u203243\u2033N 121\u00b028\u203229\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff31.22861\u00b0N 121.47472\u00b0E\ufeff / 31.22861; 121.47472 |\n| Country | China |\n| Region | East China |\n| Settled | c.\u20094000 BCE[1] |\n| Establishment of\u00a0- Qinglong Town | 746[2] |\n| \u00a0- Huating County\u00a0[zh] | 751[3] |\n| \u00a0- Shanghai County | 1292[4] |\n| \u00a0- Municipality | 7 July 1927 |\n| Municipal seat | Huangpu District |\n| Divisions\u00a0- County-level\u00a0- Township-level | 16 districts210 towns and subdistricts |\n| Government |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Type | Municipality |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShanghai has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), with an average annual temperature of 15.8\u00a0\u00b0C (60.4\u00a0\u00b0F) for urban districts and 15.2\u201315.7\u00a0\u00b0C (59.4\u201360.3\u00a0\u00b0F) for suburbs.[73] The city experiences four distinct seasons.

Many areas in the former foreign concessions are also well-preserved, the most notable being the French Concession.[81] Shanghai is also home to many architecturally distinctive and even eccentric buildings, including the Shanghai Museum, the Shanghai Grand Theatre, the Shanghai Oriental Art Center, and the Oriental Pearl Tower. Despite rampant redevelopment, the Old City still retains some traditional architecture and designs, such as the Yu Garden, an elaborate Jiangnan style garden.[82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Huangpu District during the 2013 Eastern China smog\nAir pollution in Shanghai is not as severe as in many other Chinese cities, but is still considered substantial by world standards.[341] During the December 2013 Eastern China smog, air pollution rates reached between 23 and 31 times the international standard.[342][343] On 6 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter in Shanghai rose above 600 micrograms per cubic meter and in the surrounding area, above 700 micrograms per cubic meter.[343] Levels of PM2.5 in Putuo District reached 726 micrograms per cubic meter.[344][345] As a result, the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission received orders to suspend students' outdoor activities. Authorities pulled nearly one-third of government vehicles from the roads, while much construction work was halted. Most inbound flights were canceled, and more than 50 flights at Pudong International Airport were diverted.[346]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n171. **^** Chan, Kam Wing (2007). \"Misconceptions and Complexities in the Study of China's Cities: Definitions, Statistics, and Implications\" (PDF). *Eurasian Geography and Economics*. **48** (4): 383\u2013412. doi:10.2747/1538-7216.48.4.383.

A city wall was built for the first time in 1554 to protect the town from raids by Japanese pirates. It measured 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) high and 5\u00a0km (3\u00a0mi) in circumference.[37] A City God Temple was built in 1602 during the Wanli reign. This honor was usually reserved for prefectural capitals and not normally given to a mere county seat such as Shanghai. Scholars have theorized that this likely reflected the town's economic importance, as opposed to its low political status.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1990, Deng Xiaoping permitted Shanghai to initiate economic reforms, which reintroduced foreign capital to the city and developed the Pudong district, resulting in the birth of Lujiazui.[69] That year, the China's central government designated Shanghai as the \"Dragon Head\" of economic reform.[70] As of 2020, Shanghai is classified as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, making it one of the world's Top 10 major cities.[71]\n\n\nIn early 2022, Shanghai experienced a large outbreak of COVID-19 cases. After localized lockdowns failed to stem the rise in cases, the Chinese government locked down the entire city on 5 April. This resulted in widespread food shortages across the city emerged as food-supply chains were severely disrupted by the government's lockdown measures, which was not lifted until 1 June.[72]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Shanghai\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. **^**  CMA\u53f0\u7ad9\u6c14\u5019\u6807\u51c6\u503c(1991-2020) (in Chinese).

There was a significant lull in construction projects since the mid-1990s after which construction projects began taking the skyline upwards, with a major acceleration in the pace of development since 2000, when the Lower Parel area began developing.[406] \nMumbai with a commanding 77% share of tall buildings in India, is poised to maintain its position as the frontrunner in tall building construction due to its ability to command premium prices compared to other cities, thereby ensuring the economic viability of such developments within the city.[407]\nMumbai has more residential tall buildings rather than commercial, unlike the trend globally. Limited land resources and an exponential increase in urban population were the primary reasons for Mumbai's vertical growth compared to other Tier 1 Indian cities.[408]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n165. **^** Kanth, S.
