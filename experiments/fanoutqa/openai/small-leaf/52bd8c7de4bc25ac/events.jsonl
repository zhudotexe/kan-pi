It is the successor to macOS Mojave and was announced at WWDC 2019 on June 3, 2019 and released to the public on October 7, 2019. Catalina is the first version of macOS to support only 64-bit applications and the first to include Activation Lock.[3][1] It is also the last version of macOS to have the major version number of 10; its successor, Big Sur, released on November 12, 2020, is version 11.[4][5] In order to increase web compatibility, Safari, Chromium and Firefox have frozen the OS in the user agent running in subsequent releases of macOS at 10.15.7 Catalina.[6][7][8]\n\n\nThe operating system is named after Santa Catalina Island, which is located off the coast of southern California. \n\n\nmacOS Catalina is the final version of macOS that supports the Unibody MacBook Pro, as its successor, macOS Big Sur, drops support for its mid 2012 and final model.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. **^** \"Analyzing a watering hole campaign using macOS exploits\". *Google*.

San Francisco itself is further north along the coast, by about 75 miles (120 km), accessible via Highway 1 and Highway 280.\n\n\nSanta Cruz is located at the north end of the bay, and Monterey is on the Monterey Peninsula at the south end. The \"**Monterey Bay Area**\" is a local colloquialism sometimes used to describe the whole of the Central Coast communities of Santa Cruz and Monterey counties.\n\n\n\n\n## Toponymy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gaspar de Zúñiga, 5th Count of Monterrey, namesake of Monterey Bay.\nThe first European to discover Monterey Bay was Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo on November 16, 1542, while sailing northward along the coast on a Spanish naval expedition. He named the bay *Bahía de los Pinos*,[1] probably because of the forest of pine trees first encountered while rounding the peninsula at the southern end of the bay.[2] Cabrillo's name for the bay was lost, but the westernmost point of the peninsula is still known as Point Pinos.\n\n\nOn December 10, 1595, Sebastián Rodríguez Cermeño crossed the bay and bestowed the name *Bahía de San Pedro* in honor of Saint Peter Martyr.[2][3]\n\n\nThe present name for the bay was given in 1602 by Sebastián Vizcaíno, who had been tasked by the Spanish government to complete a detailed chart of the coast. On December 16, 1602 he rounded a large peninsula and entered a bay that he named *Puerto de Monterrey* in honor of Don Gaspár de Zúñiga y Acevedo, 5th Count of Monterrey, who was governor of New Spain and had dispatched the expedition.[1][4] Monterrey is an alternate spelling of Monterrei, a municipality in the Galicia region of Spain from which the viceroy and his father (the Fourth Count of Monterrei) originated.\n\n\n\n![](image)Monterey Bay, California\n![](image)Cormorant \"condo\" in Monterey Bay\nAll other place names in the vicinity containing *Monterey* were so named because of their proximity to the bay. This includes the Presidio of Monterey, City of Monterey, County of Monterey and Monterey Canyon.\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Monterey Canyon\n\nThe Monterey Canyon, one of the largest underwater canyons in the world, begins off the coast of Moss Landing, in the center of Monterey Bay. It is 249 miles (401 km) long, although its shape changes regularly because of currents and sediment being left in the area. The canyon is much like that of a continental slope; the biology of the canyon changes significantly in different parts of the canyon.[5]\n\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nMonterey Bay is home to many species of marine mammals, including sea otters, harbor seals, and bottlenose dolphins; as well as being on the migratory path of gray and humpback whales and a breeding site for elephant seals. Killer whales are also found along the coast, especially when gray whales migrate, as they hunt the whales during their migration north. Many species of fish, sharks, mollusks such as abalone and squid, birds, and sea turtles also live in the bay. Several varieties of kelp grow in the bay, some becoming as tall as trees, forming what is known as a kelp forest.\n\n\n\n## Marine protected areas[edit]\n\n\nSoquel Canyon State Marine Conservation Area, Portuguese Ledge State Marine Conservation Area, Pacific Grove Marine Gardens State Marine Conservation Area, Lovers Point State Marine Reserve, Edward F. Ricketts State Marine Conservation Area and Asilomar State Marine Reserve are marine protected areas in Monterey Bay. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.\n\n\n\n## Communities around Monterey Bay[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Panorama of Monterey Bay from Jacks Peak Park\n![](image)Sea otter coming ashore, Moss Landing\n![](image)The Monterey Bay, as seen from space, stretches from Santa Cruz in the north to the Monterey Peninsula in the south\nClockwise around the bay, generally from north to south.

The mountains elevated along the length of the San Andreas fault provide a clear border between the Mojave desert and the coastal regions to the west.[10] The Garlock fault separates the Mojave Desert from the Sierra Nevada and Tehachapi mountains, which provide a natural border to the Mojave Desert. There are also abundant alluvial fans, which are called bajadas, that form around the mountains within the Mojave desert and extend down toward the low altitude basins,[13] which contain dried lake beds called playas, where water generally collects and evaporates, leaving large volumes of salt. These playas include Rogers Dry Lake, and China Lake. Dry lakes are a noted feature of the Mojave landscape.[2] The Mojave Desert is also home to the Devils Playground, about 40 miles (64 km) of dunes and salt flats going in a northwest-southeasterly direction. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Hereford, Richard; Webb, Robert H; Longpre, Claire I (2004). \"Precipitation History of the Mojave Desert Region, 1893–2001\".

The boundaries to the east of the Mojave Desert are less distinctive than the other boundaries because there is no presence of an indicator species, such as the Joshua tree (*Yucca brevifolia*),[13] which is endemic to the Mojave Desert. The Mojave Desert is distinguished from the Sonoran Desert and other deserts adjacent to it by its warm temperate climate, as well as flora and fauna such as ironwood (*Olneya* *tesota*), blue Palo Verde (*Parkinsonia florida*), chuparosa (*Justicia californica*), spiny menodora (*Menodora spinescens*), desert senna (*Cassia armata*), California dalea (*Psorothamnus arborescens*), and goldenhead (*Acamptopappus shockleyi*). Along with these other factors, these plants differentiate the Mojave from the nearby Sonoran desert.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Mojave Desert, together with the Sonoran, Chihuahuan, and Great Basin deserts, forms a larger North American Desert. Of these, the Mojave is the smallest and driest. The Mojave Desert displays typical basin and range topography, generally having a pattern of a series of parallel mountain ranges and valleys. It is also the site of Death Valley, which is the lowest elevation in North America. The Mojave Desert is often colloquially called the \"high desert\", as most of it lies between 2,000 and 4,000 feet (610 and 1,220 m). It supports a diversity of flora and fauna.\n\n\nThe 54,000 Sq. Mile desert supports a number of human activities, including recreation, ranching, and military training.[9] The Mojave Desert also contains various silver, tungsten, iron and gold deposits.[10]: 124\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nExtremes in temperatures throughout the seasons characterize the climate of the Mojave Desert. Freezing temperatures as well as strong winds are not uncommon in the winter, as well as precipitation such as rain and snow in the mountains. In contrast, temperatures above 100 °F (38 °C) are not uncommon during the summer months.[16] There is an annual average precipitation of 2 to 6 inches (51 to 152 mm), although regions at high altitudes such as the portion of the Mojave desert in the San Gabriel mountains may receive more rain.[10][8] Most of the precipitation in the Mojave comes from the Pacific Cyclonic storms that are generally present passing eastward in November to April.[10] Such storms generally bring rain and snow only in the mountainous regions, as a result of the effect of the mountains, which creates a drying effect on its leeward slopes.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile the Mojave Desert is generally sparsely populated, it has increasingly become urbanized in recent years.[8][2] The metropolitan areas include Las Vegas, the largest urban area in the Mojave and the largest urban area in Nevada with a population of about 2.3 million.[26] St. George, Utah, is the northeasternmost metropolitan area in the Mojave, with a population of around 180,000 in 2020, and is located at the convergence of the Mojave, Great Basin, and Colorado Plateau. The Los Angeles exurban area of Lancaster-Palmdale has more than 400,000 residents, and the Victorville area to its east has more than 300,000 residents.[8] Smaller cities or micropolitan areas in the Mojave Desert include Helendale, Lake Havasu City, Kingman, Laughlin, Bullhead City and Pahrump. All have experienced rapid population growth since 1990. The California portion of the desert also contains Edwards Air Force Base and Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, noted for experimental aviation and weapons projects.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Las Vegas is in the Mojave Desert.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Mojave Desert has several ghost towns. The most significant are the silver and copper-mining town of Calico, California, and the old railroad depot of Kelso, California. Some of the other ghost towns are more modern, created when U.S. Route 66 (and the lesser-known U.S. Route 91) were abandoned in favor of the construction of Interstates. CA SR 14, Interstate 15, Interstate 40, CA SR 58, CA SR 138, US Route 95, and US Route 395 are the main highways that traverse the Mojave Desert.\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Mojave Desert is one of the most popular spots for tourism in North America, primarily because of the international destination of Las Vegas. The Mojave is also known for its scenery, playing host to Death Valley National Park, Joshua Tree National Park, and the Mojave National Preserve. Lakes Mead, Mohave, and Havasu provide water sports recreation, and vast off-road areas entice off-road enthusiasts. The Mojave Desert also includes three California State Parks, the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve, in Lancaster, Saddleback Butte State Park, in Hi Vista and Red Rock Canyon State Park. Mojave Narrows Park, operated by San Bernardino County, is a former ranch along the Mojave River. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Atlas of Global Conservation\". maps.tnc.org.

Large tracts of the desert are owned by federal agencies and are leased at low cost by wind and solar energy companies, although these renewable developments can cause their own environmental impact and disturb cultural landscapes and visual resources.[35] Desert Sunlight Solar Farm, one of the largest solar farms in the world, was built approximately five miles from Joshua Tree National Park. An endangered Yuma clapper rail was found dead at the site in 2014, spurring efforts from conservation groups to protect birds from the so-called lake effect, a phenomenon in which birds can mistake the reflective glare of solar panels for a body of water.[36]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Zabriskie point\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** Neuwald, JL (2010). \"Population isolation exacerbates conservation genetic concerns in the endangered Amargosa vole, *Microtus californicus scirpensis*\". *Biological Conservation*. **143** (9): 2028–2038. doi:10.1016/j.biocon.2010.05.007.\n29. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Mojave Desert\". *The Nature Conservancy*.

[38]\n\n\n\n### Cultural significance[edit]\n\n\nThe Mojave desert has served as a backdrop for a number of films. The 2010 video game *Fallout: New Vegas* takes place in the Mojave Desert, or \"Mojave Wasteland\" as it is known in its post-apocalyptic future. At least four music videos were recorded in the Mojave Desert:\n\n\n\n* \"Say You'll Be There\" by the Spice Girls[39]\n* \"Goodbye\" by Mimi Webb[40][41]\n* \"Bodies\" by Robbie Williams\n* \"Burden in My Hand\" by Soundgarden\n\n\nPhotographs related to U2's 1987 album *The Joshua Tree* were taken in the Mojave Desert.[42]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Mojave Desert is a source of various minerals and metallic materials. Due to the climate, there is an accumulation of weathered bedrock, fine sand and silt, both sand and silt sediments becoming converted into colluvium.[27] The deposits of gold, tungsten, and silver have been mined frequently prior to the Second World War.[10]: 124 Additionally, there have been deposits of copper, tin, lead-zinc, manganese, iron, and various radioactive substances but they have not been mined for commercial use.[10]: 124\n\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\n### Flora[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEuropean explorers started exploring the deserts beginning in the 18th century. Francisco Garcés, a Franciscan friar, was the first explorer of the Mojave desert in 1776.[32] Garcés recorded information about the original inhabitants of the deserts.\n\n\nLater, as American interests expanded into California, American explorers started probing the California deserts. Jedediah Smith travelled through the Mojave deserts in 1826, finally reaching the San Gabriel Mission.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Human development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Devil's Playground is a part of the Mojave National Preserve and is between the town of Baker, California and Providence Mountains. The Cronese Mountains are within the Devil's Playground.\n\n\nThere are very few surface rivers in the Mojave Desert, even given the low precipitation level: two major rivers generally flow underground. The intermittent Mojave River, which begins in the San Bernardino mountains and disappears underground in the Mojave Desert.[14] The Amargosa River also flows partly underground through the Mojave Desert along a southward path.[15] The Manix, Mojave, and the Little Mojave lakes are all large but shallow.[13]: 7 Soda Lake is the principal saline basin of the Mojave desert. Natural springs are typically rare throughout the Mojave desert,[13]: 19 however, there are two notable springs, Ash Meadows, and Oasis Valley. Ash Meadows is formed from several other springs, which all draw from deep underground. Oasis Valley draws from the nearby Amargosa River.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn recent years, human development in the Mojave desert has become increasingly present. Human development at the major urban and suburban centers of Las Vegas and Los Angeles has had an increasingly damaging effect on the wildlife of the Mojave Desert.[2] An added demand for landfill space as a result of the large metropolitan centers of Las Vegas and Los Angeles also has the real potential to drastically affect flora and fauna of the Mojave Desert. Agricultural development along the Colorado river, close to the Eastern boundary of the Mojave Desert, also causes habitat loss and degradation.[8][2] Areas that are particularly affected by human development include Ward Valley and Riverside county. The United States military also maintains installations in the Mojave Desert, making the Mojave a critical training location for the United States Department of Defense.[9] The Mojave Desert has long been a valuable resource for people, and as its human population grows, its importance will only grow. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Rock formations in Joshua Tree National Park\nThe rock that forms the Mojave Desert was likely created under shallow water in the Precambrian.[13]: 21[10]: 115 Sedimentary processes left large deposits of limestones, silicates, and dolomites. During the Paleozoic era, the area that is now the Mojave was again likely submerged under a greater sea.[10]: 116 During the Mesozoic era, major tectonic activities such as thrust faulting and folding resulted in distinctive shaping as well as intrusion.[13][10]: 116 During the Cenozoic, more tectonic deformation occurred whilst the Mojave was partly submerged. Major volcanic activity is thought to have occurred during the Oligocene. Large downpours during the Miocene likely significantly eroded the rock in the Mojave and accelerated deposition.[10]: 116\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVarious habitats and regions of the Mojave Desert have been protected by statute. Notably, Joshua Tree National Park, Death Valley National Park, and the Mojave National Preserve by the California Desert Protection Act of 1994. (Pub.L. 103–433). Various other federal and state land agencies have protected regions within the Mojave Desert. These include Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve, which protects the fields of California poppies, Mojave Trails National Monument, Desert Tortoise Natural Area, Arthur B. Ripley Desert Woodland State Park, Desert National Wildlife Refuge, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Providence Mountains State Recreation Area, Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, Red Rock Canyon State Park, Saddleback Butte State Park, Snow Canyon State Park and Valley of Fire State Park. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A field of California poppies in the California Poppy Reserve in Antelope Valley\nThe Mojave Desert has a relatively stable and intact conservation status. The Mojave Desert is one of the best protected distinct ecoregions in the United States,[2] as a result of the California Desert Protection Act, which designated 69 wilderness areas and established Death Valley National Park, Joshua Tree National Park, and the Mojave National Preserve.[37] However, the southwest and central east portions of the Mojave Desert are particularly threatened as a result of off-road vehicles, increasing recreational use, human development, and agricultural grazing.[2] The World Wildlife Fund lists the Mojave Desert as relatively \"stable/intact\".[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A desert tortoise, which can be found in the Mojave Desert\nNotable species of the Mojave desert include bighorn sheep (*Ovis canadensis*), mountain lions (*Puma concolor*), black-tailed jackrabbits (*Lepus californicus*), and desert tortoises (*Gopherus agassizii*).[2] Various other species are particularly common in the Mojave Desert, such as the LeConte's thrasher (*Toxostoma lecontei*), banded gecko (*Coleonyx variegatus*), desert iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis), chuckwalla (*Sauromalus obesus*), and regal horned lizard (*Phrynosoma solare*). Species of snake include the rosy boa (*Lichanura trivirgata*), Western patch-nosed snake (*Salvadora hexalepis*), and Mojave rattlesnake (*Crotalus scutulatus*). These species can also occur in the neighboring Sonoran and Great Basin deserts.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** \"WMO Climate Normals for LAS VEGAS/MCCARRAN, NV 1961–1990\".

Both are used today, although the Mojave Tribal Nation officially uses the spelling *Mojave*. *Mojave* is a shortened form of *Hamakhaave*, an endonym in their native language, which means \"beside the water\".[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe animal species of the Mojave Desert have generally fewer endemics than its flora. However, endemic fauna of the Mojave Desert include Kelso Dunes jerusalem cricket (*Ammopelmatus kelsoensis),* the Kelso Dunes shieldback katydid (*Eremopedes kelsoensis*), the Mohave ground squirrel (*Spermophilus Mohavensis*) and Amargosa vole (*Microtus californicus scirpensis*).[28] The Mojave fringe-toed lizard (*Uma Scopari*a) is not endemic, but almost completely limited to the Mojave desert. There are also aquatic species that are found nowhere else,[29] such as the Devils Hole pupfish, limited to one hot spring near Death Valley.[30]\n\n\n\n## In society[edit]\n\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\nBefore the European colonization of North America, tribes of Native Americans, such as the Mohave, were hunter-gatherers living in the Mojave Desert.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe flora of the Mojave desert consists of various endemic plant species, notably the Joshua Tree, which is a notable endemic and indicator species of the desert. There is more endemic flora in the Mojave desert than almost anywhere in the world.[2] Mojave Desert flora is not a vegetation type, although the plants in the area have evolved in isolation because of the physical barriers of the Sierra Nevadas and the Colorado Plateau. Predominant plants of the Mojave desert include all-scale (*Atriplex polycarpa*), creosote bush (*Larrea tridentata*), brittlebush (*Encelia farinosa*), desert holly (*Atriplex hymenelytra*), white burrobush (Hymenoclea salsola), and most notably, the Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia). Additionally, the Mojave desert is also home to various species of cacti, such as silver cholla (*Cylindropuntia echinocarpa*), Mojave prickly pear (*O. erinacea*), beavertail cactus (*O. basilaris*), and many-headed barrel cactus (*Echinocactus polycephalus*). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Joshua tree (*Yucca brevifolia*) is endemic and exclusive to the Mojave Desert.[12]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLess common but distinctive plants of the Mojave desert include ironwood (*Olneya* *tesota*), blue Palo Verde (*Parkinsonia Florida*), chuparosa (*Justicia californica*), spiny menodora (*Menodora spinescens*), desert senna (*Cassia armata*), California dalea (*Psorothamnus arborescens*), and goldenhead (*Acamptopappus shockleyi*). The Mojave desert is generally abundant in winter annuals.[13]: 11 The plants of the Mojave desert each generally correspond to an individual geographic feature.

The island covers an area of about 75 square miles (194 square kilometers). It features a diverse and rugged landscape, including rolling hills, canyons, coastal cliffs, and sandy beaches. The island's highest peak is Mount Orizaba, rising to an elevation of 2,097 feet (639 meters). The island is 22 mi (35 km) long and 8 mi (13 km) across at its largest width. The island is situated in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 29 mi (47 km) south-southwest of Long Beach, California. Geologically, Santa Catalina is part of the is the southernmost island of the Channel Islands of California. Politically, Catalina Island is part of Los Angeles County in District 4.

The National Weather Service maintains cooperative weather records at the Santa Catalina airport. The average January temperatures are a maximum of 58.4 °F (14.7 °C) and a minimum of 47.6 °F (8.7 °C). Average July temperatures are a maximum of 78.1 °F (25.6 °C) and a minimum of 60.0 °F (15.6 °C). There are an average of 12.5 days with highs of 90 °F (32 °C) or higher and an average of 0.3 days with lows of 32 °F (0 °C) or lower. The record high temperature was 105 °F (41 °C) on July 6, 2018, and the record low temperature was 29 °F (−2 °C) on January 11, 1949. Coastal high fog is common during summer, but usually burns off by the afternoon.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2022 Santa Catalina Island's population was 4,201 people, with a 51.44 percent to 48.56 percent ratio of male to female residents. 90 percent of whom live in the island's only incorporated city, Avalon. The second center of population is the unincorporated village of Two Harbors at the island's isthmus. Development also occurs at the smaller settlements of Rancho Escondido and Middle Ranch. The remaining population is scattered over the island between the two population centers.\n\n\nToday, the popular tourist destination can be reached via ferry services from mainland California, with the most common departure point being the city of Long Beach.[1] The island also has an airport named, the Catalina Airport in the Sky, which is located on a hilltop and offers spectacular views of the island.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe island is rich in quartz, to the extent that some beaches on the seaward side have silvery-grey sand.[26] These deposits provide insights into the island's history, as they contain fossils of ancient marine life. The island is situated along the boundary of two tectonic plates: the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. This boundary is marked by the San Andreas Fault and the East Pacific Rise. The islands in this region have been shaped by tectonic uplift and volcanic activity. This means that the Santa Catalina Island land-mass was never directly connected to mainland California. Other geologic factors that contributed to the island topography include further geologic uplift and subsidence, tectonic plate movement, sedimentation, metamorphic activity, weathering, and erosion. The island's landscape is characterized by rugged terrain, including steep cliffs, canyons, and rolling hills. There are also geologic features such as sea caves and marine terraces along the coastline.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** \"Natalie Wood's death certificate changed to reflect new uncertainty\". *The Guardian*.

The island's geology has also contributed to the understanding of tectonic plate interactions in the region. One of the most notable geological features on Catalina Island is the \"*Catalina Schist.*\" This metamorphic rock is unique to the island and has been studied for its geologic significance. It is believed to be one of the oldest rocks on the island. The geology of Catalina Island is also important for conservation efforts. The Catalina Island Conservancy plays a role in protecting and managing the island's natural resources, including its geological formations.[27]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Silhouette of Catalina Island at sunset, as seen from the mainland\nCatalina Island is a part of the Channel Islands of California, which are a chain of eight islands located in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California. These islands are often referred to as the Channel Islands archipelago. They are not part of the mainland but are remnants of an ancient mountain range. Catalina is primarily composed of two distinct rock units: Catalina Schist from the Early Cretaceous (95 to 109 million years ago), and Miocene volcanic and intrusive igneous rocks. The geological makeup of Catalina Island is primarily igneous and metamorphic rock. The island is composed of a variety of rock types, including basalt, schist, granite, and limestone. These rocks originated from volcanic eruptions, magma intrusions, and sedimentary deposits over millions of years.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost of the island is managed by the Catalina Island Conservancy, a private nonprofit organization. The mission of the Catalina Island Conservancy is to be a steward of its lands through a balance of conservation, education and recreation. The Conservancy protects the natural and cultural heritage of Santa Catalina Island, stewarding approximately 42,000 acres (170 km2) of land (88 percent of the island), 50 mi (80 km) of shoreline, an airport, and more than 200 mi (320 km) of roads.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1846, Governor Pío Pico made a Mexican land grant of the Island of Santa Catalina to Thomas M. Robbins, as Rancho Santa Catalina. Robbins established a small ranch on the island, but sold it in 1850 to José María Covarrubias. A claim was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1853,[9] and in 1867, the grant was officially patented to José María Covarrubias.[10] Covarrubias, in turn, sold the island to Albert Packard of Santa Barbara in 1853. By 1864, the entirety of Catalina Island was under the ownership of James Lick, whose estate maintained control over the island for the following approximately 25 years.[11]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Catalina Island interior is owned and maintained by the Catalina Island Conservancy\nIn 1972, the Brown Berets, a group of Latino activists, Chicanos and Mexican residents occupied Santa Catalina Island, invoking the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which has no mention of the islands. On February 15, 1975, Philip Wrigley deeded 42,135 acres (17,051 hectares) of the island from the Santa Catalina Island Company to the Catalina Island Conservancy that he had helped to establish in 1972. This gave the Conservancy control of nearly 90 percent of the island.[20] The balance of the Santa Catalina Island Company that was not deeded to the Conservancy maintains control of much of its resort properties and operations on the island.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThroughout the year, Catalina Island hosts a variety of events and activities, including the Catalina Wine Mixer, the Catalina Island JazzTrax Festival, and many more cultural and outdoor events. A tourist-drawing area, Catalina is heavily reliant economically on revenue from its annual visitors.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Santa Catalina Island (California)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCatalina Island is known for its diverse ecosystems, which include coastal scrub, chaparral, oak woodlands, grasslands, and coastal marine environments. It is also home to various native and introduced species, both on land and in the surrounding waters. Unique species include the island fox and the Catalina Island rattlesnake.[3] The city of Avalon, located on the island's eastern side, is the primary population center and serves as the hub for tourism. Visitors can explore Avalon's streets, visit museums, dine in restaurants, and enjoy various water-based activities such as snorkeling, scuba diving, and boat tours. The island offers opportunities for hiking, biking, camping, and wildlife watching. Catalina Island enjoys a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The climate makes it an attractive destination year-round, although the summer months tend to be the busiest. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n58. **^** \"Catalina Island Conservancy\".\n59. **^** \"Annual Passenger Counts\" (PDF).

On October 7, 1542, he claimed the island for Spain and named it *San Salvador* after his ship. Although his interactions with Catalina Island are not well-documented, his main achievement was in mapping and exploring the coastline, which helped lay the foundation for future European expeditions and settlements in California.[7] Over half a century later, another Spanish explorer, Sebastián Vizcaíno, arrived at the island on the eve of Saint Catherine's day (November 24) of 1602. Vizcaino renamed the island in the saint's honor. [1] The colonization of California by the Spanish greatly contributed to the decline of the Pimugnans because of diseases brought by the Spanish from Europe. By the 1830s, the island's entire native population had been forced to the mainland on the Spanish missions or to work as ranch hands for the many private land owners.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe island is also home to the Catalina Airport (FAA Identifier: AVX), also known as Airport-in-the-Sky. The airport terminal was built in 1946 through the efforts of Dick Probert. The runway was built by Philip Wrigley in 1941, who leveled two adjacent hilltops and filled the canyon between them. It was called Buffalo Springs Airport, and was not opened for public use until 1946. By the 2000s the 3,000' (900m) runway was in serious disrepair, and arrangements were made in 2018 to have the Marines replace it with a concrete runway.[75] The work was performed in January 2019, and the airport was returned to service on 3 May.[76] The airport is located 7 miles (11 km) northwest of Avalon. The runway is 1,602 feet (488 m) above sea level.[77] Until the time of the airport's construction, the only scheduled passenger air service to the island was provided by seaplanes and helicopters at the Pebbly Beach Seaplane Base (FAA Identifier: L11).[78][79]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** Otte, Stacey; Pedersen, Jeannine (2004). \"Catalina Island History\". *A Catalina Island History in Brief*.

The first Europeans to arrive on Catalina claimed it for the Spanish Empire. Over the years, territorial claims to the island transferred ownership to Mexico and then the United States of America. During this time, (1920-1922) it was the Prohibition era in the United States. The island was sporadically used for smuggling operations involving the illicit transportation of alcohol. The island was also used for otter hunting, and gold-digging, before successfully being developed into a tourist destination in the 1920s. Since the 1970s, most of the island has been administered by the Catalina Island Conservancy.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n107. **^** \"Exhibit shows little-known life of Marilyn Monroe on Catalina Island\". *Los Angeles Times*.

Among these species, six are considered endemic, meaning they are found only on Catalina Island and nowhere else in the world.[35] These endemics include the Catalina manzanita (*Arctostaphylos catalinae*); Catalina mahogany (*Cercocarpus traskiae*); Catalina dudleya (*Dudleya hassei*); St. Catherine's lace (*Eriogonum giganteum* var. *giganteum*); Santa Catalina bedstraw (*Galium catalinense* ssp. *catalinense*); and Santa Catalina Island ironwood (*Lyonothamnus floribundus* ssp. *floribundus*). Additionally, there's a disjunctive population of toyon var. macrocarpa that is unique to Santa Catalina Island.[36] The Wrigley Memorial & Botanical Gardens on the island provide an opportunity for visitors to appreciate and learn about these endemic and native plant species. The gardens emphasize the importance of preserving and showcasing the island's exceptional flora.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)\nCatalina panorama, taken from a sail boat; Avalon is to the far left, Two Harbors to the mid-right.\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sunrise view of the Wrigley Institute lab and Big Fisherman's CoveChildren in Avalon attend schools in the Long Beach Unified School District. There were two schools on Catalina Island. Two Harbors was served by a one-room school house, but it closed down in 2014; students must now travel to Avalon for all grades K–12.[66] Avalon schools are housed on one main campus that includes Avalon Elementary School, Avalon Middle School and Avalon High School.[67] Thousands of school-age youths travel from the mainland to study at the Catalina Island Marine Institute every year.[68]\n\n\nThere is also a branch of the County of Los Angeles Public Library system in downtown Avalon, adjacent to the Sheriff's office.[69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the late 18th century, the Franciscan friars considered building a mission on Catalina, but abandoned the idea due to the island's rugged terrain, small population size, and lack of fresh water. While Spain maintained its claim on Catalina Island, the Europeans were forbidden to trade with colonies. However, this policy was short lasted as the island lacked the ships to enforce this prohibition; also, much of the colonies wanted to trade with other European powers. During the period stretching from the late 18th to early 19th centuries, Russian hunters from the Aleutian Islands, particularly the Russian-American Company, visited Catalina Island as part of their fur trading expeditions. They were primarily interested in harvesting sea otters for their valuable fur, which led to the decimation of the local sea otter population. The hunting done by the Russian-American's caused a profound ecological impact on the marine life around Catalina Island by depleting a keystone species.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Bison on Catalina Island\nThe island is home to five native land mammals: the island fox, the *Spermophilus beecheyi nesioticus* subspecies of California ground squirrel, the Santa Catalina Island harvest mouse (*Reithrodontomys megalotis catalinae*), the Santa Catalina Island deer mouse (*Peromyscus maniculatus catalinae*), and the ornate shrew (*Sorex ornatus*). Only one ornate shrew was ever found, from a now-developed spring area above Avalon. Shrews are difficult to capture and may survive in wetter areas of the island.[39]\n\n\nThe Catalina orangetip butterfly is a notable insect on the island. The Southern Pacific rattlesnake (*Crotalus oreganus helleri*) is also present on the island.

It is frequently praised for its dramatic scenery. Big Sur has been called the \"longest and most scenic stretch of undeveloped coastline in the contiguous United States\",[1] a sublime \"national treasure that demands extraordinary procedures to protect it from development\",[2] and \"one of the most beautiful coastlines anywhere in the world, an isolated stretch of road, mythic in reputation\".[3] The views, redwood forests, hiking, beaches, and other recreational opportunities have made Big Sur a popular destination for visitors from across the world. With 4.5 to 7 million visitors annually,[4] it is among the top tourist destinations in the United States, comparable to Yosemite National Park, but with considerably fewer services, and less parking, roads, and related infrastructure.[5][6][7][8][9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Big Sur: rocky coast, fog and giant kelp\nThe name \"Big Sur\" has its origins in the area's early Spanish history. While the Portolá expedition was exploring Alta California, they arrived at San Carpóforo Canyon near present-day San Simeon on September 13, 1769. Unable to penetrate the difficult terrain along the coast, they detoured inland through the San Antonio and Salinas Valleys before arriving at Monterey Bay, where they founded Monterey and named it the provincial capital.[28]\n\n\nThe Spanish referred to the vast and relatively unexplored coastal region to the south of Monterey as *el país grande del sur*, meaning 'the big country of the south'. This was often shortened to *el sur grande* 'the big south'.[29][30] The two major rivers draining this portion of the coast were named El Rio Grande del Sur and El Rio Chiquito del Sur.[20]: 7\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)View of Gorda, one of the small clusters of services in Big Sur\nThe Big Sur region is largely rural and the 1,800 to 2,000 residents are widely distributed. There are a concentration of homes in the north at Palo Colorado Canyon, Big Sur Village, and Posts. Other residential areas include Otter Cove, Garrapata Ridge, Garrapata Canyon, Bixby Canyon, Pfeiffer Ridge, Sycamore Canyon, Coastlands, and Partington Ridge.\n\n\nIn the south, residents are in the vicinity of Slates Hot Springs, Plaskett, Lucia, and Gorda. Homes are also located near Burns Creek, Buck Creek to Lime Creek, Plaskett Ridge, and Redwood Gulch.[23]\n\n\n\n### Inland extent[edit]\n\n\nThe vast majority of visitors only see Big Sur's dramatic coastline and consider the Big Sur region to include only the coastal flanks of the Santa Lucia Mountains, which at various points extend from 3 to 12 miles (5 to 19 km) inland.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe United States does not define a census-designated place called Big Sur, but it does define a census tract (115) that includes almost all of the Big Sur coast, beginning in the north at Malpaso Creek and ending south of Lucia. It doesn't include New Camoldi Hermitage, Gorda, and Ragged Point where a few dozen people live, and it doesn't include the isolated private inholdings within the Los Padres National Forest. It includes much of the interior coast as far west as the Tassajara Zen Center.\n\n\nIn 1977, there were 1,813 residents and 846 dwelling units.[244] In 2018, the Census Bureau estimated there were 1,728 residents, (1,125 white, 525 Latino or Hispanic), 892 housing units, 639 households, 253 vacant or rental housing units; the median value of owner-occupied housing units was $877,100. Per capita income was $34,845; median income $63,843; mean income $81,766.[245]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Big Sur: The Making of a Prized California landscape*, Shelley Alden Brooks, University of California Press (1979), 280 pages, ISBN 978-0520294417\n* Big Sur River Watershed Management Plan (2014) Resource Conservation District of Monterey County\n* \"Historical Overview of the Carmel to San Simeon Highway\" Caltrans (November 1996) Excerpted from *Historic Resource Evaluation Report on the Rock Retaining Walls, Parapets, Culvert Headwalls and Drinking Fountains along with the Carmel to San Simeon Highway.* Robert C.

She and her husband Harry Dick Ross lived in southern Big Sur near Lime Creek beginning in 1939. Harry, a wood sculptor, worked at Hearst's estate in San Simeon as a tile-setter. She famously described Big Sur as \"not a place at all but a state of mind.\"[25][26][27]\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** \"Station and Equipment\".

The Big Sur portion of Highway 1 is generally considered to include the 71-mile (114 km) segment adjoining the unincorporated region of Big Sur between Malpaso Creek near Carmel Highlands[11] in the north and San Carpóforo Creek near San Simeon in the south.[12]\n\n\nAlong with the ocean views, this winding, narrow road, often cut into the face of seaside cliffs, dominates the visitor's experience of Big Sur.[135] The views, redwood forests, hiking, beaches, and other recreational opportunities have made Big Sur a destination for about 4.5 to 7 million people who live within a day's drive and for visitors from elsewhere in the world. [136]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe various informal boundaries applied to the region have gradually expanded north and south over time. Esther Pfeiffer Ewoldson, who was born in 1904 and was a granddaughter of Big Sur pioneers Michael and Barbara Pfeiffer, wrote that the region extended from the Little Sur River 23 miles (37 km) south to Slates Hot Springs. Members of the Harlan Family, who homesteaded the Lucia region 9 miles (14 km) south of Slates Hot Springs, said that Big Sur was \"miles and miles to the north of us.\"[19]: 6 Prior to the construction of Highway 1, residents on the south coast had little contact with residents to the north of them.[19]\n\n\n\n### Northern and southern boundaries[edit]\n\n\nMost current descriptions of the area refer to Malpaso Creek 4.5 miles (7.2 km) south of the Carmel River as the northern border.[11][*failed verification*] The southern border is generally accepted to be San Carpóforo Creek in San Luis Obispo County.[12]\n\n\n\n### Settlements[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n208. **^** \"Big Sur Coast Land Use Plan\". *Big Sur LCP*.

The residents changed the name of the post office to Arbolado ('woodland'), but that was confused by the post office for Alvarado, a street in Monterey. The post office operated at Posts from 1889 to 1910; it was moved in 1905 several miles northwest to Big Sur Village.[33] The English-speaking homesteaders petitioned the United States Post Office in Washington D.C. to change the name of their post office from Arbolado to Big Sur, and the rubber stamp using that name was returned on March 6, 1915, cementing the use of Big Sur as the place name.[19]: 8[20]: 7[34][21]\n\n\n\n## Popularity[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBig Sur is renowned worldwide for its natural features and relatively pristine scenery. It is rated among the top 35 tourist destinations in the world.[5] The Big Sur coast has been called the \"longest and most scenic stretch of undeveloped coastline in the [contiguous] United States.\"[1] The region has been described as a \"national treasure that demands extraordinary procedures to protect it from development.\"[2] Robert Lindsey wrote in The *New York Times* that it is \"one of the most stunning meetings of land and sea in the world.\"[35] The *Washington Times* stated that it is \"one of the most beautiful coastlines anywhere in the world, an isolated stretch of road, mythic in reputation.\"[3] *Condé Nast Traveler* named State Route 1 through Big Sur one of the top 10 world-famous streets, comparable to Broadway in New York City and the Champs-Élysées in Paris.[36] Realtor Mark Peterson commented, \"Big Sur's popularity has erupted with the growth of social media. It has become a year-round destination.\"[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n85. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Russell, Stan. \"Big Sur Camping Guide, Big Sur California\". *Bigsurcalifornia.org*.

Also illustrating the difference in vegetation between the winter rainy season and dry early fall.\nBig Sur typically enjoys a mild Mediterranean climate, with a sunny, dry summer and fall, and cool, wet winter. Coastal temperatures range from the 50s at night to the 70s by day (Fahrenheit) from June through October, and in the 40s to 60s from November through May. Further inland, away from the ocean's moderating influence, temperatures are much more variable. The weather varies widely due to the influence of the jagged topography, creating many microclimates.\n\n\n\n![](image)Big Sur Coast in April 1969 after a wet winter\nThe record maximum temperature was 111 °F (43.9 °C) on September 7, 2020, and the record low was 26 °F (−3.3 °C), recorded on February 9, 2009.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Bixby Creek Bridge, shown here looking southwest, is a popular attraction in Big Sur.\n![](image)Bixby Creek Bridge at night\nBesides sightseeing from the highway, Big Sur offers hiking and outdoor activities. There are a large number of state and federal lands and parks, including McWay Falls at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park, one of only two waterfalls in California that plunge directly into the ocean. The waterfall is located near the foundation of a grand stone cliffside house built in 1940 by Lathrop and Hélène Hooper Brown which was the region's first electrified home. However, parking is very limited and usually unavailable on summer weekends and holidays.[55]\n\n\nAnother notable landmark is Point Sur Lightstation, the only complete nineteenth century lighthouse complex open to the public in California.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n137. **^** \"Important sections of the Big Sur Land Use Plan\". *Big Sur LCP Defense Committee*.
