Originally a straight knockout competition open only to champion clubs, the tournament was expanded during the 1990s to incorporate a round-robin group phase and more teams. The expansion resulted in more games being played, increasing players' goalscoring chances; thus the rankings are weighted in favour of modern players: only seven out of the 52 players on the list never competed in the reformed Champions League.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith 140 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo is currently the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, while his career rival Lionel Messi is the only other player to have reached triple figures. Ronaldo has also finished as the top scorer for the most individual seasons in the competition's history, doing so seven times.\n\n\nThe title of highest goalscorer had previously been held by Ra\u00fal, who scored his 50th goal in 2005 while at Real Madrid to overtake Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano.[1] He held the record until November 2014,[2][3] when his eventual tally of 71 was first equalled and then surpassed by Messi.[4][5] Ronaldo has remained the competition's outright top scorer since September 2015; after a back-and-forth exchange of the record between him and Messi, a hat-trick by the former against Shakhtar Donetsk put Ronaldo ahead with 80 goals, and he would not relinquish the top spot again after this.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## All-time top scorers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEuropean Cup and UEFA Champions League top scorers\n |\n| --- |\n| European Cup era | * 1956: Milutinovi\u0107\n* 1957: Viollet\n* 1958: Di St\u00e9fano\n* 1959: Fontaine\n* 1960: Pusk\u00e1s\n* 1961: J. \u00c1guas\n* 1962: Di St\u00e9fano, L\u00f8fqvist, Pusk\u00e1s, Strehl & Tejada\n* 1963: Altafini\n* 1964: Kova\u010devi\u0107, Mazzola & Pusk\u00e1s\n* 1965: Eus\u00e9bio & Torres\n* 1966: Albert & Eus\u00e9bio\n* 1967: Piepenburg & Van Himst\n* 1968: Eus\u00e9bio\n* 1969: Law\n* 1970: Jones\n* 1971: Antoniadis\n* 1972: Dunai, Macari & Taka\u010d\n* 1973: M\u00fcller\n* 1974: M\u00fcller\n* 1975: Markarov & M\u00fcller\n* 1976: Heynckes\n* 1977: Cucinotta & M\u00fcller\n* 1978: Simonsen\n* 1979: Sulser\n* 1980: Lerby\n* 1981: McDermott, Rummenigge & Souness\n* 1982: Hoene\u00df\n* 1983: Rossi\n* 1984: Sokol\n* 1985: Nilsson & Platini\n* 1986: Nilsson\n* 1987: Cvetkovi\u0107\n* 1988: R. \u00c1guas, Ferreri, Hagi, Madjer, McCoist, M\u00edchel & Nov\u00e1k\n* 1989: Van Basten\n* 1990: Papin & Rom\u00e1rio\n* 1991: Pacult & Papin\n* 1992: Papin & Yuran\n |\n| UEFA Champions League era | * 1993: Rom\u00e1rio\n* 1994: Koeman & Rufer\n* 1995: Weah\n* 1996: Litmanen\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Ra\u00fal ya es el m\u00e1ximo goleador de la Copa de Europa\" [Ra\u00fal is now the top scorer of the European Cup]. *Diario AS* (in Spanish).

He earned 97 caps, including scoring in three and appearing in four major tournaments, and ranks as France's sixth-highest all-time top goalscorer. Benzema was controversially left out of the squad for the 2010 World Cup and did not play for France for over five years after being implicated in a blackmailing scandal in 2015; he later returned to the squad before announcing his international retirement in December 2022. He has been named French Player of the Year by France Football four times. For his performances in 2021 and 2022, Benzema was awarded the UEFA Player of the Year and the Ballon d'Or, becoming the fifth French player to have won the Ballon d'Or.[8] At 34 years and 302 days old, he is the third-oldest winner of the award.\n\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n215. **^** \"Benzema adds to his legend: 300 goals for Real Madrid\". *Marca*. 8 January 2022.

It was scored in the 50th minute after Ra\u00fal (himself only on the pitch as a substitute for Rafael van der Vaart after 15 minutes) had signalled he could not physically continue and was prepared to be substituted off for Karim Benzema one minute after the goal.[29] Before the substitution could be made, Real Madrid launched a counter-attack to create a goal. Though Ra\u00fal ran to a slow hobble, he shuffled into the box and was able to poke the ball from Cristiano Ronaldo's pass.\n\n\nHaving spent the rest of the season recovering from that injury, the club confirmed on 25 July 2010 that Ra\u00fal would be leaving the club, a day after his teammate Guti confirmed he was also leaving after a 15-year spell.[30]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** Arnhold, Matthias (5 July 2017). \"Ra\u00fal Gonz\u00e1lez Blanco - Matches and Goals in Bundesliga\". *RSSSF*.

With the senior team, Ra\u00fal went on for many years to score a national record 44 goals in 102 caps for Spain. However, David Villa later equaled Ra\u00fal's record in 2010 and surpassed it on 25 March 2011 in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier. Of his 44 international goals, Ra\u00fal scored 32 goals in competitive matches, six of which were in the finals of major tournaments and 12 from friendly matches.\n\n\n\n### 1998 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith Real Madrid, he won several honours at the club, including further La Liga titles in 1996\u201397 (scoring 21 La Liga goals), 2000\u201301 (scoring 24 La Liga goals), and 2002\u201303 (scoring 16 La Liga goals in a campaign truncated by a bout of appendicitis for which Ra\u00fal was hospitalised). During the period from 1998 to 2002, Ra\u00fal and Real Madrid also won three UEFA Champions League trophies in 1998, 2000, and 2002. For most of this time, Ra\u00fal struck up a prolific scoring partnership with Fernando Morientes and later Ronaldo. During a La Liga game against fierce rivals Barcelona at the Nou Camp in October 1999, Ra\u00fal silenced the hostile home crowd of almost 100,000 fans when he scored and then memorably celebrated his goal by putting a finger to his lips as though to tell them to be quiet.[18][19] Ra\u00fal took over the captaincy of Real Madrid when Fernando Hierro was transferred in 2003, a responsibility he held until leaving the club in 2010. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2018\u20132019 | Real Madrid (youth) |\n| 2019\u2013 | Real Madrid B |\n| 2020 | Real Madrid U19 (caretaker) |\n| Medal record\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Men's football |\n| Representing ![](image)\u00a0Spain |\n| UEFA European Under-21 Championship |\n| **Runner-up** | 1996 |  |\n |\n| \n\\*Club domestic league appearances and goals |\n\n\n**Ra\u00fal Gonz\u00e1lez Blanco** (Spanish pronunciation: [ra\u02c8ul \u0263on\u02c8\u03b8ale\u03b8 \u02c8\u03b2la\u014bko]; born 27 June 1977), known as **Ra\u00fal**, is a Spanish football manager and former player who played as a forward.

After being absent for six years, Schalke ultimately reached the finals since 2005. In the final match, they played against MSV Duisburg, the first 2. Bundesliga team which reached the final since 2004. Ra\u00fal never won a domestic cup with Real Madrid (the Copa del Rey), but on 21 May 2011, in his first season, he finally won a domestic cup and got his maiden trophy with his new club. They won the tournament with a 5\u20130 win at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. This success was followed with victory two months later on 23 July 2011 in the 2011 DFL-Supercup against the league champions and rivals Borussia Dortmund.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRa\u00fal earned his 89th cap on 8 October 2005 in a 2\u20130 away win over Belgium in 2006 World Cup qualifying, levelling with Hierro as Spain's most-capped outfield player.[68] However, he played less frequently across the campaign as new manager Luis Aragon\u00e9s preferred to partner David Villa and Fernando Torres.\n\n\nAt the final tournament in Germany, he came on at half-time for Luis Garc\u00eda in the second group match in Stuttgart, with Spain trailing Tunisia 0\u20131. When goalkeeper Ali Boumnijel could not retain Cesc F\u00e0bregas' shot in the 72nd minute, Ra\u00fal equalised from close range as Spain eventually won 3\u20131.[69]\n\n\nOn 15 August 2006, Ra\u00fal won his 100th cap for Spain, in a goalless friendly draw with Iceland in Reykjav\u00edk.[70] He was last chosen for the national team on 6 September, in a 3\u20132 defeat against Northern Ireland in Belfast, a match in which he hit the post late on.[71]\n\n\n\n## Managerial career[edit]\n\n\n### Real Madrid U15s[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** \"Raul signs for Schalke\". *FIFA.com*.

In his third match, on 14 December against Yugoslavia at the Mestalla Stadium, he recorded his first international goal in a 2\u20130 qualifying win.
