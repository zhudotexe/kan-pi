Originally a straight knockout competition open only to champion clubs, the tournament was expanded during the 1990s to incorporate a round-robin group phase and more teams. The expansion resulted in more games being played, increasing players' goalscoring chances; thus the rankings are weighted in favour of modern players: only seven out of the 52 players on the list never competed in the reformed Champions League.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith 140 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo is currently the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, while his career rival Lionel Messi is the only other player to have reached triple figures. Ronaldo has also finished as the top scorer for the most individual seasons in the competition's history, doing so seven times.\n\n\nThe title of highest goalscorer had previously been held by Raúl, who scored his 50th goal in 2005 while at Real Madrid to overtake Alfredo Di Stéfano.[1] He held the record until November 2014,[2][3] when his eventual tally of 71 was first equalled and then surpassed by Messi.[4][5] Ronaldo has remained the competition's outright top scorer since September 2015; after a back-and-forth exchange of the record between him and Messi, a hat-trick by the former against Shakhtar Donetsk put Ronaldo ahead with 80 goals, and he would not relinquish the top spot again after this.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## All-time top scorers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEuropean Cup and UEFA Champions League top scorers\n |\n| --- |\n| European Cup era | * 1956: Milutinović\n* 1957: Viollet\n* 1958: Di Stéfano\n* 1959: Fontaine\n* 1960: Puskás\n* 1961: J.

He earned 97 caps, including scoring in three and appearing in four major tournaments, and ranks as France's sixth-highest all-time top goalscorer. Benzema was controversially left out of the squad for the 2010 World Cup and did not play for France for over five years after being implicated in a blackmailing scandal in 2015; he later returned to the squad before announcing his international retirement in December 2022.

His great performances in the European Cup this season earned him to be included in the best eleven of the competition awarded by UEFA.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRaúl holds the distinction of having never been sent off in his 17 years at the professional level.[23] On 11 November 2008, Raúl scored his 300th goal for Real Madrid with a hat-trick against Real Unión, with Real winning the match 4–3 but being eliminated on away goals after drawing 6–6 on aggregate.[24] In total, Raúl scored 323 goals for Real Madrid, breaking the long-standing club record of Alfredo Di Stéfano (307) with a volleyed goal against Sporting de Gijón on 15 February 2009. He is presently fifth on the all-time list of La Liga goalscorers, behind Argentine Lionel Messi, Portuguese Cristiano Ronaldo, Spaniard Telmo Zarra and Mexican Hugo Sánchez.[25]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: List of international goals scored by Raúl\n\n\n\nAppearances and goals by national team and year[98]\n| National team\n | Year\n | Apps\n | Goals\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spain | 1996 | 4 | 1\n |\n| 1997 | 6 | 0\n |\n| 1998 | 10 | 4\n |\n| 1999 | 9 | 10\n |\n| 2000 | 11 | 3\n |\n| 2001 | 9 | 5\n |\n| 2002 | 9 | 6\n |\n| 2003 | 10 | 8\n |\n| 2004 | 13 | 3\n |\n| 2005 | 12 | 2\n |\n| 2006 | 9 | 2\n |\n| Total | 102 | 44\n |\n\n\n## Managerial statistics[edit]\n\n\n*As of 3 September 2023*\n\n\nManagerial record by team and tenure\n| Team\n | From\n | To\n | Record\n | Ref |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| G | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Win % |\n| Real Madrid Castilla | 20 June 2019\n | *Present* | 135 | 58 | 41 | 36 | 219 | 162 | +57\n | 042.96 | [99] |\n| Real Madrid U19 (caretaker)\n | 1 July 2020\n | 31 August 2020\n | 4 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 11 | 4 | +7\n | 100.00 |  |\n| Total\n | 139 | 62 | 41 | 36 | 230 | 166 | +64\n | 044.60 | —\n |\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Raúl in his last season with Real Madrid\n### Player[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRaúl's last touch with the ball as a Real Madrid player before an injury ruled him out of action for the rest of that season was to score his last goal, the opening goal scored on 24 April 2010 in a 2–1 away victory against Real Zaragoza in La Romareda, coincidentally the stadium where he made his debut in 1994. It was scored in the 50th minute after Raúl (himself only on the pitch as a substitute for Rafael van der Vaart after 15 minutes) had signalled he could not physically continue and was prepared to be substituted off for Karim Benzema one minute after the goal.[29] Before the substitution could be made, Real Madrid launched a counter-attack to create a goal. Though Raúl ran to a slow hobble, he shuffled into the box and was able to poke the ball from Cristiano Ronaldo's pass.\n\n\nHaving spent the rest of the season recovering from that injury, the club confirmed on 25 July 2010 that Raúl would be leaving the club, a day after his teammate Guti confirmed he was also leaving after a 15-year spell.[30]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** Arnhold, Matthias (5 July 2017). \"Raúl González Blanco - Matches and Goals in Bundesliga\". *RSSSF*.

Cup 2010. One week later, he made his competitive debut in the 2010 DFL-Supercup on 7 August 2010 again against Bayern, but this time he failed to score in the 2–0 defeat. Raúl made his Bundesliga debut on 21 August 2010 in a 2–1 defeat against Hamburger SV.[33] and scored his first goal for Schalke in the Bundesliga against Borussia Mönchengladbach on 25 September 2010 in a 2–2 draw.[34] After a quiet start, he rediscovered his goalscoring form in the Bundesliga with a brace against FC St. Pauli on 5 November in a 3–0 win, and on 20 November, he scored his first hat-trick for the club in a 4–0 win over Werder Bremen. On 18 December, he scored his second hat-trick for Schalke in a 3–0 win against 1. FC Köln.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 22 August 2013, Raúl played for Real Madrid in the first half of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu and scored the first goal. He then played the second half for Al Sadd as Real Madrid won 5–0.[48] On 5 March 2014, Raúl announced he would retire from professional football at the end of the Qatari football season.[49]\n\n\n\n### New York Cosmos[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Raúl walks onto the pitch as a member of the New York Cosmos for a home game in 2015\nOn 30 October 2014, Raúl returned to professional football and signed with the New York Cosmos in the United States.[50] He made his North American Soccer League (NASL) debut on 4 April 2015 in a 1–0 win against the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, partially owned by his former Real Madrid strike partner Ronaldo, leaving with a hamstring injury in the second half.[51] The following week, at the Indy Eleven, he scored his first goal to equalise in a 1–1 draw.[52] Raúl scored four times as the undefeated Cosmos won the spring season with five wins and five draws.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe spent 16 years of his career playing for Real Madrid and is the club's third all-time top goalscorer with 323 goals[6] and has the most appearances in the history of the club, with 741. With *Los Blancos*, Raúl won six La Liga titles, three UEFA Champions League titles, scoring in two finals, four Supercopa de España titles, one UEFA Super Cup and two Intercontinental Cups. In 2003, he was appointed captain of the team, after Fernando Hierro's departure from the club and retained the position until he left the club in 2010. He then signed for Schalke 04, where he won a DFB-Pokal and DFL-Supercup,[7] before signing for Qatari club Al Sadd in 2012, where he won the league and the Emir of Qatar Cup. He ended his career with New York Cosmos in 2015, after winning a domestic treble.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Raúl in 2019\nRaul married Mamen Sanz in 1999 and the couple have four sons and a daughter: Jorge, Hugo, twins Héctor and Mateo, and María.[94] Jorge and Hugo are both footballers; Jorge at Fordham Preparatory School in New York City,[95] and Hugo in New York City FC's academy.[96] In 2022 his daughter Maria has been signed by Real Madrid's U15 football team.[97]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Club[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough primarily renowned for prolific goalscoring, Raúl was also a highly creative and hardworking player, capable of playing off of his teammates, creating chances and assisting goals,[75][82] and was occasionally deployed as an attacking midfielder in his later career.[83] In addition to these characteristics, Raúl is remembered for his leadership and discipline – throughout his extensive career, he never received a red card, and he was rarely booked.[84][85][86] For his technical skills, elegance, goalscoring and performances, he was nicknamed \"*El Ferrari*\", or \"The Ferrari,\" by compatriot Fernando Hierro, another emblematic Real Madrid player.[87] He was also an accurate penalty taker.[88] In 2013, former England centre-back Rio Ferdinand praised Raúl for his clever movement off the ball, and his ability to exploit gaps or draw out defenders in order to create space for his teammates' runs, describing him as: \"the most intelligent player [he'd] played against.\"[89]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, Raúl opened a 3–1 win over the Slovenes in Spain's first Group B match,[63] and added two more in a 3–2 win over South Africa in Daejeon to advance as group winners.[64] He suffered a groin injury in the round of 16 win over the Republic of Ireland,[65] and missed the remainder of the tournament, in which Spain went out to South Korea in the quarter-finals.\n\n\n\n### UEFA Euro 2004[edit]\n\n\nOn 7 September 2002, Raúl scored in a 2–0 away win over Greece in Euro 2004 qualifying, putting him on 29 goals in 56 international games, equalling the national goalscoring record set by the recently retired Fernando Hierro.[66] He broke the record on 12 February 2003 when he scored twice in a 3–1 friendly win over Germany at Son Moix in Palma, Mallorca.[67] He started every match at the Euro 2004 finals in Portugal, in which Spain crashed out at the group stage.\n\n\n\n### 2006 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRaúl began his Spain career at the youth level and represented the nation at the 1995 FIFA U-20 World Cup, scoring three goals from five matches. He was also part of the under-21 side that reached the final of the 1996 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, and even scored his side's temporary equaliser in the final, although he later missed his penalty in the resulting shoot-out, which was won by Italy.[56] In total, he scored 17 goals at the various youth levels for Spain. With the senior team, Raúl went on for many years to score a national record 44 goals in 102 caps for Spain. However, David Villa later equaled Raúl's record in 2010 and surpassed it on 25 March 2011 in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier. Of his 44 international goals, Raúl scored 32 goals in competitive matches, six of which were in the finals of major tournaments and 12 from friendly matches.\n\n\n\n### 1998 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith Real Madrid, he won several honours at the club, including further La Liga titles in 1996–97 (scoring 21 La Liga goals), 2000–01 (scoring 24 La Liga goals), and 2002–03 (scoring 16 La Liga goals in a campaign truncated by a bout of appendicitis for which Raúl was hospitalised). During the period from 1998 to 2002, Raúl and Real Madrid also won three UEFA Champions League trophies in 1998, 2000, and 2002. For most of this time, Raúl struck up a prolific scoring partnership with Fernando Morientes and later Ronaldo. During a La Liga game against fierce rivals Barcelona at the Nou Camp in October 1999, Raúl silenced the hostile home crowd of almost 100,000 fans when he scored and then memorably celebrated his goal by putting a finger to his lips as though to tell them to be quiet.[18][19] Raúl took over the captaincy of Real Madrid when Fernando Hierro was transferred in 2003, a responsibility he held until leaving the club in 2010. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2018–2019 | Real Madrid (youth) |\n| 2019– | Real Madrid B |\n| 2020 | Real Madrid U19 (caretaker) |\n| Medal record\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Men's football |\n| Representing ![](image) Spain |\n| UEFA European Under-21 Championship |\n| **Runner-up** | 1996 |  |\n |\n| \n\\*Club domestic league appearances and goals |\n\n\n**Raúl González Blanco** (Spanish pronunciation: [raˈul ɣonˈθaleθ ˈβlaŋko]; born 27 June 1977), known as **Raúl**, is a Spanish football manager and former player who played as a forward.

After being absent for six years, Schalke ultimately reached the finals since 2005. In the final match, they played against MSV Duisburg, the first 2. Bundesliga team which reached the final since 2004. Raúl never won a domestic cup with Real Madrid (the Copa del Rey), but on 21 May 2011, in his first season, he finally won a domestic cup and got his maiden trophy with his new club. They won the tournament with a 5–0 win at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. This success was followed with victory two months later on 23 July 2011 in the 2011 DFL-Supercup against the league champions and rivals Borussia Dortmund.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRaúl earned his 89th cap on 8 October 2005 in a 2–0 away win over Belgium in 2006 World Cup qualifying, levelling with Hierro as Spain's most-capped outfield player.[68] However, he played less frequently across the campaign as new manager Luis Aragonés preferred to partner David Villa and Fernando Torres.\n\n\nAt the final tournament in Germany, he came on at half-time for Luis García in the second group match in Stuttgart, with Spain trailing Tunisia 0–1. When goalkeeper Ali Boumnijel could not retain Cesc Fàbregas' shot in the 72nd minute, Raúl equalised from close range as Spain eventually won 3–1.[69]\n\n\nOn 15 August 2006, Raúl won his 100th cap for Spain, in a goalless friendly draw with Iceland in Reykjavík.[70] He was last chosen for the national team on 6 September, in a 3–2 defeat against Northern Ireland in Belfast, a match in which he hit the post late on.[71]\n\n\n\n## Managerial career[edit]\n\n\n### Real Madrid U15s[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** \"Raul signs for Schalke\". *FIFA.com*.
