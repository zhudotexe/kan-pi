Three of Cameron's films are amongst the top four highest-grossing films of all time; *Avatar* (2009), *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022) and *Titanic* (1997) are the highest, third-highest and fourth-highest-grossing films of all time, respectively.[1] Cameron directed the first film to gross over $1\u00a0billion, the first two films to gross over $2\u00a0billion, and is the only director to have had three films gross over $2 billion.[2][3] In 2010, *Time* named Cameron one of the 100 most influential people in the world.

Cameron's debut was the 1978 science fiction short *Xenogenesis*, which he directed, wrote and produced.[1][2] In his early career, he did various technical jobs such as special visual effects producer, set dresser assistant, matte artist, and photographer. His feature directorial debut was the 1982 release *Piranha II: The Spawning*.[2][3] The next film he directed was the science fiction action thriller *The Terminator* (1984) which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as the titular cyborg assassin, and was Cameron's breakthrough feature.[4][5][6] In 1986, he directed and wrote the science fiction action sequel *Aliens* starring Sigourney Weaver.[7] He followed this by directing another science fiction film *The Abyss* (1989). In 1991, Cameron directed the sequel to *The Terminator*, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (with Schwarzenegger reprising his role),[8] and also executive produced the action crime film *Point Break*. Three years later he directed a third Schwarzenegger-starring action film *True Lies* (1994).[9]\n\n\nIn 1997, Cameron directed, wrote, and produced the epic romantic disaster film *Titanic* which grossed over $1.8 billion[10][a] at the worldwide box-office and became the highest grossing of all time.[b] He received the Academy Award for Best Director, the Academy Award for Best Film Editing, and shared the Academy Award for Best Picture with the other producers. It had a total of 14 Oscar nominations (tying the record set by the 1950 drama *All About Eve*) and won 11 (tying the record set by the 1959 epic historical drama *Ben-Hur*).[15] Cameron also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director and shared the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture\u00a0\u2013 Drama with the other producers.[16] He followed this by directing, and producing two underwater documentaries: *Ghosts of the Abyss* (2003), and *Aliens of the Deep* (2005). He returned to directing features in 2009 with the 3D science fiction film *Avatar*. It grossed over $2.9 billion at the worldwide box-office and became the highest grossing of all time surpassing *Titanic*.[c][14][19] *Avatar* was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won three in technical categories.[20] Cameron also earned a second Golden Globe Award for Best Director, and Best Motion Picture\u00a0\u2013 Drama.[21] He followed this by executive producing two 3D films, *Sanctum* (2011) and *Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away* (2012), as well as the documentary *Deepsea Challenge 3D* (2014).\n\n\nCameron made his television debut in 1998 playing himself in the sitcom *Mad About You*. Two years later he executive produced the science fiction television series *Dark Angel* (2000) starring Jessica Alba. In 2005, he appeared in two documentaries about the sinking of the RMS Titanic: *Last Mysteries of the Titanic*, and *Tony Robinson's Titanic Adventure*. He also made appearances as himself on the comedy-drama television series *Entourage* that same year. Cameron followed this by executive producing two biblical documentaries, *The Exodus Decoded* (2006) and *Lost Tomb of Jesus* (2007). He executive produced and appeared in a third Titanic related documentary, *Titanic: Final Word with James Cameron*, in 2012. Two years later, Cameron executive produced the climate change documentary television series *Years of Living Dangerously* (2014) which received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.[22]\n\n\n\n\n## Film[edit]\n\n\n### Feature films[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of Cameron (right) with Aliens producer Gale Anne Hurd (left) in 1986](image)Cameron (right) with his then wife and *Aliens* producer Gale Anne Hurd (left) in 1986[23]\n![A photograph of Cameron receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2009](image)Cameron receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2009\n\n\nKey\n| \u2020\n | Denotes films that have not yet been released\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Credited as\n | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Director\n | Writer\n | Producer\n | Editor\n |\n| 1978\n | *Xenogenesis* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n | Short filmCo-directed and co-written with Randall FrakesAlso Visual effects producer\n | [1] |\n| 1982\n | *Piranha II: The Spawning* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n | No\n | Co-written with Ovidio G.

Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Cameron's sketches and passion for the film.[19] In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion.[19][21] *The Terminator* was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million.[22] Aside from Hemdale, Pacific Western Productions, Euro Film Funding and Cinema '84 have been credited as production companies after the film's release.[4][3][23]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe film's special effects, which included miniatures and stop-motion animation, were created by a team of artists led by Stan Winston and Gene Warren Jr.\n\n\nDefying low pre-release expectations, *The Terminator* topped the United States box office for two weeks, eventually grossing $78.3 million against a modest $6.4 million budget. It is credited with launching Cameron's film career and solidifying Schwarzenegger's status as a leading man. The film's success led to a franchise consisting of several sequels, a television series, comic books, novels and video games. In 2008, *The Terminator* was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1984, two men arrive separately in Los Angeles, having time traveled from 2029. One is a cybernetic assassin known as a Terminator, programmed to hunt and kill a woman named Sarah Connor. The other is a human soldier named Kyle Reese, intent on stopping it. They both steal guns and clothing. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Gale Anne Hurd bought the rights to *The Terminator* from James Cameron for one dollar.[15]\nGale Anne Hurd, who had worked at New World Pictures as Roger Corman's assistant, showed interest in the project.[16] Cameron sold the rights for *The Terminator* to Hurd for one dollar with the promise that she would produce it only if Cameron was to direct it. Hurd suggested edits to the script and took a screenwriting credit in the film, though Cameron stated that she \"did no actual writing at all\".[15][17] Cameron would later regret the decision to sell the rights for one dollar.[18] Cameron and Hurd had friends who worked with Corman previously and who were working at Orion Pictures (now part of MGM). Orion agreed to distribute the film if Cameron could get financial backing elsewhere. The script was picked up by John Daly, chairman and president of Hemdale Film Corporation.[19] Daly and his executive vice president and head of production Derek Gibson became executive producers of the project.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***The Terminator*** is a 1984 American science fiction action film directed by James Cameron. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, a cybernetic assassin sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose unborn son will one day save mankind from extinction by Skynet, a hostile artificial intelligence in a post-apocalyptic future. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah. The screenplay is credited to Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd, while co-writer William Wisher Jr. received an \"additional dialogue\" credit.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOrion Pictures did not have faith in *The Terminator* performing well at the box office and feared a negative critical reception.[65] At an early screening of the film, the actors' agents insisted to the producers that the film should be screened for critics.[25] Orion only held one press screening for the film.[65] The film premiered on October 26, 1984. On its opening week, *The Terminator* played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4.0 million making it number one in the box office. The film remained at number one in its second week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to *Oh, God! You Devil*.[66][67] Cameron noted that *The Terminator* was a hit \"relative to its market, which is between the summer and the Christmas blockbusters. But it's better to be a big fish in a small pond than the other way around.\"[68] *The Terminator* grossed $38.3 million in the United States and Canada and $40 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $78.3 million.[5]\n\n\n\n## Critical response[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 1984, the film began production in Los Angeles.[49][53] Cameron felt that with Schwarzenegger on the set, the style of the film changed, explaining that \"the movie took on a larger-than-life sheen. I just found myself on the set doing things I didn't think I would do\u00a0\u2013 scenes that were just purely horrific that just couldn't be, because now they were too flamboyant.\"[54] Most of *The Terminator*'s action scenes were filmed at night, which led to tight filming schedules before sunrise. A week before filming started, Linda Hamilton sprained her ankle, leading to a production change whereby the scenes in which Hamilton needed to run occurred as late as the filming schedule allowed.

He sold the rights to the project to fellow New World Pictures alumna Hurd on the condition that she would produce the film only if he were to direct it; Hurd eventually secured a distribution deal with Orion Pictures, while executive producers John Daly and Derek Gibson of Hemdale Film Corporation were instrumental in setting up the film's financing and production. Originally approached by Orion for the role of Reese, Schwarzenegger agreed to play the title character after befriending Cameron. Filming, which took place mostly at night on location in Los Angeles, was delayed because of Schwarzenegger's commitments to *Conan the Destroyer* (1984), during which Cameron found time to work on the scripts for *Rambo: First Blood Part II* (1985) and *Aliens* (1986). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe *Terminator* soundtrack was composed and performed on synthesizer by Brad Fiedel.[59] Fiedel was with the Gorfaine/Schwartz Agency, where a new agent, Beth Donahue, found that Cameron was working on *The Terminator* and sent him a cassette of Fiedel's music.[60] Fiedel was invited to a screening of the film with Cameron and Hurd.[60] Hurd was not certain about having Fiedel compose the score, as he had only worked in television, not theatrical films.[60] Fiedel convinced the two by showing them an experimental piece he had worked on, thinking that \"You know, I'm going to play this for him because it's really dark and I think it's interesting for him.\" The song convinced Hurd and Cameron to hire him.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Roffman, Michael (April 5, 2016). \"Stream + Interview: Brad Fiedel's The Terminator Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\". *Consequence of Sound*.

Wittily written with a nice eye for sharp detail, it's hard sci-fi action all the way.\"[87] Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* awarded it five stars out of five, stating that \"on the strength of this picture [...] Cameron could stand toe to toe with Carpenter and Spielberg. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere was limited interference from Orion Pictures. Two suggestions Orion put forward included the addition of a canine android for Reese, which Cameron refused, and to strengthen the love interest between Sarah and Reese, which Cameron accepted.[48] To create the Terminator's look, Winston and Cameron passed sketches back and forth, eventually deciding on a design nearly identical to Cameron's original drawing in Rome.[46][49] Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a Terminator puppet; it was first molded in clay, then plaster reinforced with steel ribbing. These pieces were then sanded, painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted reproduction of Schwarzenegger's face in several poses out of silicone, clay and plaster.[49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe *Los Angeles Times* called the film \"a crackling thriller full of all sorts of gory treats\u00a0... loaded with fuel-injected chase scenes, clever special effects and a sly humor.\"[65] The *Milwaukee Journal* gave the film three stars, calling it \"the most chilling science fiction thriller since *Alien*\".[71] A review in *Orange Coast* magazine stated that \"the distinguishing virtue of *The Terminator* is its relentless tension.

It's like a streamlined *Dirty Harry* movie\u00a0\u2013 no exposition at all; just guns, guns and more guns.\"[72] In the May 1985 issue of *Cinefantastique* it was referred to as a film that \"manages to be both derivative and original at the same time\u00a0... not since *The Road Warrior* has the genre exhibited so much exuberant carnage\" and \"an example of science fiction/horror at its best\u00a0... \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Overstreet, Robert M.

In 1990, Schwarzenegger and Cameron persuaded Carolco Pictures to purchase the rights from *The Terminator* producer Gale Anne Hurd and Hemdale, which was financially struggling. A release date was set for the following year, leaving Cameron and Wisher seven weeks to write the script. Principal photography began from October 1990 to March 1991, taking place in and around Los Angeles on an estimated $94\u2013102\u00a0million budget, making it the most expensive film made at the time. The advanced visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), which include the first use of a computer-generated main character in a blockbuster film, resulted in a schedule overrun.

TriStar contributed about $20\u00a0million for marketing, which included a $150,000 teaser trailer that was directed by Winston and depicts the construction of a T-800. Trailers ran for six months before the film's release. Tristar incentivized cinema staff to play it frequently by offering chances to win *Terminator 2*-branded goods and tickets to the premiere. Fast-food restaurants and soft-drink manufacturers, such as Subway and Pepsi, also offered *Terminator 2*-themed foodstuffs and drinks, alongside promotional posters.[o]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Print | * Comics\n\t+ *Aliens versus Predator versus The Terminator*\n\t+ *RoboCop Versus The Terminator*\n\t+ *Superman vs. The Terminator: Death to the Future*\n\t+ *The Burning Earth*\n\t+ *Infinity*\n\t+ *Transformers vs. The Terminator*\n* *T2* novels\n |\n| Attractions | * *T2-3D: Battle Across Time*\n* *X: A Laser Battle for Salvation*\n* *Terminator Salvation*: The Ride\n |\n| Quotes | * \"I'll be back\"\n* \"Hasta la vista, baby\"\n |\n| Related | * \"Soldier\" (*The Outer Limits*)\n* *Lady Terminator*\n* *Shocking Dark*\n* *Rottweiler*\n* *The Terminators*\n* *Light & Magic*\n* Special effects of Terminator 2: Judgment Day\n |\n| ![](image) Category\n |\n\n| *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nJames Cameron\n |\n| --- |\n| * Filmography\n* Unrealized projects\n* Awards and nominations\n* Bibliography\n |\n| Films directed | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Kozak, Oktay Ege (April 11, 2018). \"Battle Of The Cuts: *Terminator 2*\u2014Theatrical Vs.

Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, Bill Paxton, Art Malik, and Tia Carrere star in supporting roles. *True Lies* was the first Lightstorm Entertainment project to be distributed under Cameron's multimillion-dollar production deal with 20th Century Fox, as well as the first major production for the visual effects company Digital Domain, which was co-founded by Cameron.

Schwarzenegger quickly slid off the horse and a stuntman caught him; he concluded, \"[this is] why I will always love stunt people\".[7] Art Malik said he was drawn to the script's \"pantomime quality\u201d and the chance to work with director James Cameron.[8] Costing $100[2][3]\u2013120[4][9] million to produce, *True Lies* was the first film with a production budget of over $100 million.[10] It was filmed over a seven-month schedule.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*True Lies* received mostly positive reviews from critics, and ultimately grossed $378 million worldwide at the box office, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 1994.[6] For her performance, Curtis won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the Saturn Award for Best Actress, while Cameron won the Saturn Award for Best Director. It was also nominated at the Academy Awards and BAFTAs in the Best Visual Effects category, and also for seven Saturn Awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*True Lies* was a box-office success.

We have a good script. There does need to be some changes because it deals with some terrorist act of some sort. But it's pretty much done.\"[72] Later in 2002, Cameron said the film would not be made following the September 11 attacks: \"Terrorism is no longer something to take as lightly as we did in the first one. I just can't see it happening given the current world climate.\"[73][74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn February 10, 2021, CBS announced a pilot order for the *True Lies* series adaptation. Matt Nix wrote the pilot and produce with Josh Levy via Flying Glass of Milk Productions. James Cameron, director of the film, executive produced with Rae Sanchini through Lightstorm Entertainment. Mary Viola of Wonderland Sound and Vision also executive produced, with Corey Marsh of Wonderland co-executive producing. McG was set to direct the pilot and executive produce via Wonderland.[83] In March 2021, CBS moved the pilot \"off cycle\" to give the series producers more time to film the pilot later in the year.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*True Lies* was released on VHS on January 10, 1995 and on LaserDisc a month later on February 8.

A high definition version was released on D-Theater in 2003. The film is currently unavailable for digital purchase.

It was a very important moment in the movie, and he felt like he can't do that and therefore has to rewrite it ... These things take a long time.\"[75] The following month, Curtis said the film would never be made due to the September 11 attacks: \"Terrorists aren't funny anymore. They never were, but, it was distant enough from our psyche that we could make it funny. It'll never be funny again. I just think that that is over, that kind of humor is over.\"[76] Eastin cited Schwarzenegger's 2003 election as California governor as another reason that *True Lies 2* did not get made.[68] However, Arnold remained optimistic that the film would be made.[b]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRoger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film three stars out of four, writing, \"It's stuff like that we go to Arnold Schwarzenegger movies for, and *True Lies* has a lot of it: laugh-out-loud moments when the violence is so cartoonish we don't take it seriously, and yet are amazed at its inventiveness and audacity.\" He wrote that he found the plot \"perfunctory\", but praised the film's stunts and special effects.[29]\n\n\nThe film received criticism for its portrayal of Middle Easterners and its treatment of female characters.[30] John Simon of the *National Review* criticized the plot line of the hero character (Schwarzenegger) using his agency's resources to stalk and frighten his wife as cruel and misogynistic.[31] In a negative review, Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* wrote:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nJames Cameron\n |\n| --- |\n| * Filmography\n* Unrealized projects\n* Awards and nominations\n* Bibliography\n |\n| Films directed | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Feature | * *Piranha II: The Spawning* (1982)\n* *The Terminator* (1984)\n* *Aliens* (1986)\n* *The Abyss* (1989)\n* *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991)\n* *True Lies* (1994)\n* *Titanic* (1997)\n* *Avatar* (2009)\n* *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022)\n* *Avatar 3* (2025)\n* *Avatar 4* (2029)\n |\n| Short | * *Xenogenesis* (1978)\n* *T2-3D: Battle Across Time* (1996)\n |\n| Documentaries | * *Expedition: Bismarck* (2002)\n* *Ghosts of the Abyss* (2003)\n* *Aliens of the Deep* (2005)\n |\n\n |\n| Films written | * *Rambo: First Blood Part II* (1985)\n* *Strange Days* (1995)\n* *Alita: Battle Angel* (2019, also produced)\n* *Terminator: Dark Fate* (2019, also produced)\n |\n| Produced only | * *Solaris* (2002)\n |\n| TV series produced | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30. **^** Treadwell, Carol (August 29, 1994). \"It's Not True That 'Lies' Helps Women\". *Los Angeles Times*.
