According to Tuvalu's constitution, the prime minister must always be a member of the parliament, and is elected by parliament in a secret ballot. Because there are no political parties in Tuvalu, any member of parliament can be nominated for the role. Following the parliamentary vote the governor-general of Tuvalu (as head of state) is responsible for swearing in as the prime minister the person who commands the confidence of a majority of members of parliament.\n\n\nThe office of prime minister was established when Tuvalu gained independence in 1978, although the post is sometimes considered to be a continuation of the earlier office of chief minister, which was created in 1975. If the prime minister dies, as has happened on one occasion, the deputy prime minister becomes acting prime minister until a new one is elected by parliament. The prime minister can lose his office by resigning, being defeated in a motion of no confidence by parliament, or losing his seat in a parliamentary election. \n\n\nSeveral former prime ministers have been appointed the governor-general of Tuvalu.\n\n\nKausea Natano is the incumbent prime minister, since 19 September 2019.\n\n\n\n## List of prime ministers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Portrait\n | Name(Birth\u2013Death) | Election\n | Term of office\n | Ministry\n | Governor-General\n | Monarch\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Took office\n | Left office\n | Time in office\n |\n| Chief Minister of the Ellice Islands\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | Sir Toaripi Lauti(1928\u20132014) | \u2014\n | 2 October 1975\n | 1 October 1978\n | 2\u00a0years, 364\u00a0days\n | Lauti Ministry1st Ministry | John Hillary Smith | **Queen Elizabeth II** |\n| Prime Minister of Tuvalu\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | Sir Toaripi Lauti(1928\u20132014) | 1977 | 1 October 1978\n | 8 September 1981\n | 2\u00a0years, 342\u00a0days\n | Lauti Ministry1st Ministry | Sir Fiatau Penitala Teo |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Tomasi Puapua(born 1938) | 19811985 | 8 September 1981\n | 16 October 1989\n | 8\u00a0years, 38\u00a0days\n | First Puapua MinistrySecond Puapua Ministry2nd Ministry |\n| Sir Tupua Leupena |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | Bikenibeu Paeniu(born 1956) | 19891993 (Sep) | 16 October 1989\n | 10 December 1993\n | 4\u00a0years, 55\u00a0days\n | First Paeniu Ministry3rd Ministry |\n| Sir Toaripi Lauti |\n| Sir Tomu Sione |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | Sir Kamuta Latasi(born 1936) | 1993 (Nov) | 10 December 1993\n | 24 December 1996\n | 3\u00a0years, 14\u00a0days\n | Latasi Ministry4th Ministry |\n| Sir Tulaga Manuella |\n| (3) | ![](image) | Bikenibeu Paeniu(born 1956) | 1993 (Nov)1998 | 24 December 1996\n | 27 April 1999\n | 2\u00a0years, 124\u00a0days\n | Second Paeniu MinistryThird Paeniu Ministry5th Ministry |\n| Sir Tomasi Puapua |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | Ionatana Ionatana(1938\u20132000) | 1998 | 27 April 1999\n | 8 December 2000\n | 1\u00a0year, 225\u00a0days\n | Ionatana Ministry6th Ministry |\n| Acting1 | ![](image) | Lagitupu Tuilimu | \u2014\n | 8 December 2000\n | 24 February 2001\n | 78\u00a0days\n | Tuilimu Ministry6th Ministry (Cont.) |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | Faimalaga Luka(1940\u20132005) | 1998 | 24 February 2001\n | 14 December 2001\n | 293\u00a0days\n | Luka Ministry7th Ministry |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | Koloa Talake(1934\u20132008) | 1998 | 14 December 2001\n | 2 August 2002\n | 231\u00a0days\n | Talake Ministry8th Ministry |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Saufatu Sopoanga(1952\u20132020) | 2002 | 2 August 2002\n | 27 August 2004\n | 2\u00a0years, 25\u00a0days\n | Sopoanga Ministry9th Ministry |\n| Faimalaga Luka |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | Maatia Toafa(born 1954) | 2002 | 27 August 2004\n | 14 August 2006\n | 1\u00a0year, 352\u00a0days\n | First Toafa Ministry10th Ministry |\n| Sir Filoimea Telito |\n| 10\n | ![](image) | Apisai Ielemia(1955\u20132018) | 2006 | 14 August 2006\n | 29 September 2010\n | 4\u00a0years, 46\u00a0days\n | Ielemia Ministry11th Ministry |\n| *Sir Kamuta Latasi* |\n| Sir Iakoba Italeli |\n| (9) | ![](image) | Maatia Toafa(born 1954) | 2010 | 29 September 2010\n | 24 December 2010\n | 86\u00a0days\n | Second Toafa Ministry12th Ministry |\n| 11\n | ![](image) | Willy Telavi(born 1954) | 2010 | 24 December 2010\n | 1 August 2013\n | 2\u00a0years, 220\u00a0days\n | Telavi Ministry13th Ministry |\n| 12\n | ![](image) | Enele Sopoaga(born 1956) | 20102015 | 1 August 2013\n | 19 September 2019\n | 6\u00a0years, 49\u00a0days\n | Sopoaga Ministry14th Ministry |\n| *Mrs. Teniku Talesi Honolulu*,*Samuelu Teo*,Sir Tofiga Vaevalu Falani |\n| 13\n | ![](image) | Kausea Natano(born 1957) | 2019 | 19 September 2019\n | Incumbent\n | 4\u00a0years, 268\u00a0days\n | Natano Ministry15th Ministry | **King Charles III** |\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\n\n1. **^** Tuilimu served as acting prime minister following the death of Ionatana.[2][3]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Governor-General of Tuvalu\n* Politics of Tuvalu\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Tuvalu. \"PRESCRIPTION OF SALARIES ACT, 2008 Revised Edition\" (PDF). *tuvalu-legislation.tv*.\n2. **^** \"Tuvalu: Year In Review 2001\". *Britannica*. 2001.

During their term of office, the officeholder is responsible for directing the work of the government and in charge of foreign relations. As the monarch's representative, the prime minister also presides (with voting powers) over the Council of Government, directs the executive services and commands the police and military.\n\n\nSince 1 September 2020, Pierre Dartout has been the prime minister.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## History of the office[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official residence of the prime minister\nThe office was created in 1911 with the adoption of Monaco's constitution. Until the revision of the constitution of 2002, the prime minister had to be a French citizen,[*citation needed*] selected from several senior civil servants proposed by the French government. Since 2002, the prime minister can be either French or Monegasque and is chosen and appointed by the monarch, after consultation with the French government.\n\n\n\n## List of officeholders[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Portrait\n | Name(born\u2013died) | Term of office\n | Party\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Took office\n | Left office\n | Time in office\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | \u00c9mile Flach(1853\u20131926) | February 1911\n | December 1917\n | 6\u00a0years, 10\u00a0months\n |  | Independent |\n| \u2014\n |  | Georges Jaloustre(1875\u20131951)*acting* | January 1918\n | February 1919\n | 1\u00a0year, 1\u00a0month\n |\n| 2\n |  | Raymond Le Bourdon(1861\u20131937) | 19 February 1919\n | 11 August 1923\n | 4\u00a0years, 173\u00a0days\n |\n| 3\n |  | Maurice Piette(1871\u20131953) | 11 August 1923\n | February 1932\n | 8\u00a0years, 5\u00a0months\n |\n| \u2014\n |  | Henry Mauran(1899\u20131983)*acting* | January 1932\n | June 1932\n | 4\u00a0months\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | Maurice Bouilloux-Lafont(1875\u20131937) | June 1932\n | June 1937\n | 5\u00a0years\n |\n| \u2014\n |  | Henry Mauran(1899\u20131983)*acting* | June 1937\n | August 1937\n | 2\u00a0months\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | \u00c9mile Roblot(1886\u20131963) | 15 September 1937\n | 29 September 1944\n | 7\u00a0years, 14\u00a0days\n |\n| \u2014\n |  | Pierre Blanchy(1897\u20131981)*acting* | 29 September 1944\n | 13 October 1944\n | 14\u00a0days\n |\n| 6\n |  | Pierre de Witasse(1878\u20131956) | 13 October 1944\n | December 1948\n | 4\u00a0years, 1\u00a0month\n |\n| \u2014\n |  | Pierre Blanchy*acting* | 4 January 1949\n | 12 July 1949\n | 189\u00a0days\n |\n| 7\n |  | Jacques Rueff(1896\u20131978) | 12 July 1949\n | 1 August 1950\n | 1\u00a0year, 20\u00a0days\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Pierre Voizard(1896\u20131982) | 1 August 1950\n | 2 September 1953\n | 3\u00a0years, 32\u00a0days\n |\n| 9\n |  | Henry Soum(1899\u20131983) | 15 November 1953\n | 12 February 1959\n | 5\u00a0years, 89\u00a0days\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image) | \u00c9mile Pelletier(1898\u20131975) | 12 February 1959\n | 23 January 1962\n | 2\u00a0years, 345\u00a0days\n |\n| \u2014\n |  | Pierre Blanchy*acting* | 23 January 1962\n | 16 August 1963\n | 1\u00a0year, 205\u00a0days\n |\n| 11\n |  | Jean Reymond(1912\u20131986) | 16 August 1963\n | 28 December 1966\n | 3\u00a0years, 134\u00a0days\n |\n| 12\n |  | Paul Demange(1906\u20131970) | 28 December 1966\n | 1 April 1969\n | 2\u00a0years, 94\u00a0days\n |\n| 13\n | ![](image) | Fran\u00e7ois-Didier Gregh(1906\u20131992) | 1 April 1969\n | 24 May 1972\n | 3\u00a0years, 53\u00a0days\n |\n| 14\n |  | Andr\u00e9 Saint-Mleux(1920\u20132012) | 24 May 1972\n | July 1981\n | 9\u00a0years, 1\u00a0month\n |\n| 15\n |  | Jean Herly(1920\u20131998) | July 1981\n | 16 September 1985\n | 4\u00a0years, 2\u00a0months\n |\n| 16\n |  | Jean Ausseil(1925\u20132001) | 16 September 1985\n | 16 February 1991\n | 6\u00a0years, 0\u00a0days\n |\n| 17\n | ![](image) | Jacques Dupont(1929\u20132002) | 16 February 1991\n | 2 December 1994\n | 3\u00a0years, 77\u00a0days\n |\n| 18\n |  | Paul Dijoud(born 1938) | 2 December 1994\n | 3 February 1997\n | 2\u00a0years, 63\u00a0days\n |\n| 19\n |  | Michel L\u00e9v\u00eaque(born 1933) | 3 February 1997\n | 5 January 2000\n | 2\u00a0years, 336\u00a0days\n |\n| 20\n |  | Patrick Leclercq(born 1938) | 5 January 2000\n | 1 May 2005\n | 5\u00a0years, 116\u00a0days\n |\n| 21\n |  | Jean-Paul Proust(1940\u20132010) | 1 May 2005\n | 29 March 2010\n | 4\u00a0years, 332\u00a0days\n |\n| 22\n | ![](image) | Michel Roger(born 1949) | 29 March 2010\n | 16 December 2015\n | 5\u00a0years, 262\u00a0days\n |\n| \u2014\n |  | Gilles Tonelli(born 1957)*acting* | 16 December 2015\n | 1 February 2016\n | 47\u00a0days\n |\n| 23\n | ![](image) | Serge Telle(born 1955) | 1 February 2016\n | 31 August 2020\n | 4\u00a0years, 212\u00a0days\n |\n| 24\n | ![](image) | Pierre Dartout(born 1954) | 1 September 2020\n | *Incumbent* | 3\u00a0years, 287\u00a0days\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Politics of Monaco\n* Monarchy of Monaco\n\t+ List of rulers of Monaco\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Laurens, Didier (2 May 2007). *Monaco, un pays ensoleill\u00e9 dirig\u00e9 par un prince magnifique*.

The secretary of state is sometimes described as the prime minister of the Holy See,[2] even though the nominal head of government of Vatican City is the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State.\n\n\nCardinal Pietro Parolin has been secretary of state since 2013.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Duties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe secretary of state is appointed by the Pope, and serves as one of his principal advisors. As one of the senior offices in the Roman Catholic Church, the secretary is required to be a cardinal. If the office is vacant, a non-cardinal may serve as provisional secretary of state, exercising the powers of the Secretary of State until a suitable replacement is found or the Pro-Secretary is made a cardinal in a subsequent consistory.[4]\n\n\nThe secretary's term ends when the Pope who appointed him dies or leaves office. During the *sede vacante* period, the former secretary acts as a member of a commission with the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church and the former President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, which exercises some of the functions of the head of state of the Vatican City State until a new Pope is elected. Once the new Pope is chosen, the former secretary's role in the commission likewise expires, though he can be re-appointed as Secretary of State.[4]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe imprudence of Pope Julius III in entrusting the office of Cardinal Nephew to his alleged lover Innocenzo Ciocchi Del Monte, a teenaged, virtually illiterate street urchin whom his brother had adopted a few years earlier, led to an upgrading of the Secretary's job, as the incumbent had to take over the duties the Cardinal Nephew was unfit for. By the time of Pope Innocent X the Secretary of State was always himself a Cardinal, and Pope Innocent XII abolished the office of Cardinal Nephew in 1692. From then onwards the Secretary of State has been the most important of the officials of the Holy See.\n\n\nIn 1968, Pope Paul VI's apostolic constitution *Regimini Ecclesiae Universae* further enhanced the powers of the Secretary of State, placing him over all the other departments of the Roman Curia. In 1973 Pope Paul further broadened the Secretaryship by abolishing the ancient office of Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church and merging its functions into those of the Secretary of State.\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Pope Pius XII, having been the Secretary of State under Pope Pius XI, did not name a Secretary after the death of Cardinal Maglione in 1944. Beneath his direct supervision, the duties were divided between two  protonotaries apostolic, Domenico Tardini and Giovanni Battista Montini, who in 1952 were both named Pro-Secretary of State, for Extraordinary and Ordinary affairs respectively. In 1954 Montini (the future Pope Paul VI) was appointed Archbishop of Milan, thus leaving the Roman Curia.\n6. **^** Vivarelli, Nick (4 August 2015). \"Paolo Sorrentino's 'Young Pope' Rounds Out Cast With James Cromwell And Slew Of Top International Talent\".

Shifting allegiances among a small number of individuals can lead to frequent changes in the makeup of the government of the day, including the presidential position itself.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## List of

They are elected every six months by the Grand and General Council, the country's legislative body. Normally the Regents are chosen from opposing parties and they serve a six-month term. The investiture of the captains regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October every year. This tradition dates back at least to 1243.[1]\n\n\nThe practice of dual heads of government (diarchy) is derived directly from the customs of the Roman Republic, equivalent to the consuls of ancient Rome.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## 1243\u20131500[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of captains regent of San Marino, 1243\u20131500\n\n## 1500\u20131700[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of captains regent of San Marino,
