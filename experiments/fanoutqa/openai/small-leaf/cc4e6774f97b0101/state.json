According to Article 91 of the Belgian constitution, the heir accedes to the throne only upon taking a constitutional oath before a joint session of the two Houses of Parliament.[38] The joint session has to be held within ten days of the death or abdication of the previous monarch. The new Belgian monarch is required to take the Belgian constitutional oath, \"I swear to observe the Constitution and the laws of the Belgian people, to maintain the national independence and the integrity of the territory,\" which is uttered in the three official languages: French, Dutch, and German.\n\n\nMembers of the Belgian royal family are often known by two names: a Dutch and a French one. For example, the current monarch is called 'Philippe' in French and 'Filip' in Dutch; the fifth King of the Belgians was 'Baudouin' in French and 'Boudewijn' in Dutch.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** Newmedia, R.

He informs the King about all matters of security, defence policy, the views of Belgium's main partner countries and all aspects of the Belgian Armed Forces. He organises the King's contacts with the Armed Forces, advises in the fields of scientific research and police and coordinates matters with patriotic associations and former service personnel. The Military Household is also responsible for managing the Palace's computer system. The Head of the Military Household is a General Officer, currently General Jef Van den put and assisted by an adviser, currently Lieutenant-Colonel Aviator Serge Vassart. The King's Aides-de-Camp and the King's Equerries are also attached to the Military Household.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe monarch is the Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian Armed Forces and makes appointments to the higher positions. The names of the nominees are sent to the monarch by the Ministry of Defence. The monarch's military duties are carried out with the help of the Military Household which is headed by a General office. Belgians may write to the monarch when they meet difficulties with administrative powers.\n\n\nThe monarch is also one of the three components of the federal legislative power, in accordance with the Belgian Constitution, together with the two chambers of the Federal Parliament: the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. All laws passed by the Federal Parliament must be signed and promulgated by the monarch.\n\n\nPreviously, children of the King were entitled to a seat in the senate (Senator by right) when they were 18. This right was abolished in 2014 as part of the Sixth Belgian state reform.\n\n\n\n### Inviolability[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **Leopold II[33]**King of the Belgians1835\u20131909r.1865-1909![](image)![](image) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Philippe Count of Flanders![](image) ![](image)1837\u20131905  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **Albert I[34]**King of the Belgians 1875\u20131934r.1909-1934 ![](image) ![](image) ![](image) ![](image)![](image)![](image) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **Leopold III**King of the Belgians1901\u20131983r.1934-1951![](image)![](image) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** \"Zevende zoon zorgt voor zevende viergeslacht en peterschap van koning Filip: \"Ze noemen ons Sneeuwwitje en de zeven dwergen\"\".\n45. **^** \"Voici la nouvelle filleule de la reine Mathilde (Photos)\". 14 April 2017.\n46. **^** \"No, Argentina's president did not adopt a Jewish child to stop him turning into a werewolf\". *TheGuardian.com*. 29 December 2014.

The Belgian monarchy is closer to the principle \"the King does not rule\",[17] but the Belgian kings were not only \"at the head of the dignified part of the Constitution\".[18] The Belgian monarchy is not merely symbolic, because it participates in directing affairs of state insofar as the King's will coincides with that of the ministers, who alone bear responsibility for the policy of government.[19] For Francis Delp\u00e9r\u00e9e, to reign does not only mean to preside over ceremonies but also to take a part in the running of the State.[20] The Belgian historian Jean Stengers wrote that \"some foreigners believe the monarchy is indispensable to national unity. That is very naive. He is only a piece on the chessboard, but a piece which matters\".[21]\n\n\n\n## List of kings of the Belgians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Belgian monarchs\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe incumbent, Philippe, ascended the throne on 21 July 2013, following the abdication of his father Albert II.\n\n\n\n\n## Origins[edit]\n\n\nWhen the Belgians became independent in 1830, the National Congress chose a constitutional monarchy as the form of government. The Congress voted on the question on 22 November 1830, supporting monarchy by 174 votes to 13. In February 1831, the Congress nominated Louis, Duke of Nemours, the son of the French king Louis-Philippe, but international considerations deterred Louis-Philippe from accepting the honour for his son.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of Belgian monarchs\n* List of heirs to the Belgian throne\n* Line of succession to the Belgian throne\n* Crown Council of Belgium\n* Princess Delphine of Belgium and Royal bastard\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing this refusal, the National Congress appointed Erasme-Louis, Baron Surlet de Chokier to be the Regent of Belgium on 25 February 1831. Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was designated as King of the Belgians by the National Congress and swore allegiance to the Belgian constitution in front of Saint James's Church at Coudenberg Palace in Brussels on 21 July.[1] This day has since become a national holiday for Belgium and its citizens.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Hereditary and constitutional[edit]\n\n\nAs a hereditary constitutional monarchy system, the role and operation of Belgium's monarchy are governed by the Constitution. The royal office of King is designated solely for a descendant of the first King of the Belgians, Leopold I.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince he is bound by the Constitution (above all other ideological and religious considerations, political opinions and debates and economic interests) the King is intended to act as an arbiter and guardian of Belgian national unity and independence.[2] Belgium's monarchs are inaugurated in a purely civil swearing-in ceremony.\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Belgium was never an absolute monarchy. Nevertheless, in 1961, the historian Ramon Arango, wrote that the Belgian monarchy is not \"truly constitutional\".[3][*clarification needed*]\n\n\n\n### Leopold I, Leopold II and Albert I[edit]\n\n\nKing Leopold I was head of Foreign Affairs \"as an *ancien r\u00e9gime* monarch\", the foreign ministers having the authority to act only as ministers of the king.[4] Leopold I quickly became one of the most important shareholders of the *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique*.[5]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Philippof Saxe-Coburgand Gotha1844\u20131921 |  | Louiseof Belgium1858\u20131924 |  | LeopoldDuke of Brabant![](image)1859\u20131869 |  | RudolfCr.

It is this family name which is used on the identity cards and in all official documents by Belgium's royalty (e.g. marriage licenses). In addition to this change of name, the armorial bearings of Saxony were removed from the Belgian royal coat of arms (see above). Other Coburgers from the multi-branched Saxe-Coburg family have also changed their name, such as George V, who adopted the family name of Windsor after the British royal family\u2019s place of residence.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Princess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant, who will inherit the throne after her father due to a 1991 act of succession which established absolute (gender-neutral) primogeniture, altering the order of succession from \"eldest son\" to \"eldest child\".\n* Prince Gabriel of Belgium\n* Prince Emmanuel of Belgium\n* Princess El\u00e9onore of Belgium\n\n\n### Other members of the royal family[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnlike the British constitutional system, in Belgium \"the monarchy underwent a belated evolution\" which came \"after the establishment of the constitutional monarchical system\"[15] because, in 1830\u20131831, an independent state, parliamentary system and monarchy were established simultaneously. Hans Daalder, professor of political science at the Rijksuniversiteit Leiden wrote: \"Did such simultaneous developments not result in a possible failure to lay down the limits of the royal prerogatives with some precision\u2014which implied that the view of the King as the Keeper of the Nation, with rights and duties of its own, retained legitimacy?\"[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArticle 37 of the Constitution of Belgium vests the \"federal executive power\" in the monarch. Under Section III, this power includes the appointment and dismissal of ministers, the implementation of the laws passed by the Federal Parliament, the submission of bills to the Federal Parliament and the management of international relations. The monarch sanctions and promulgates all laws passed by Parliament. In accordance with Article 106 of the Belgian Constitution, the monarch is required to exercise his powers through the ministers. His acts are not valid without the countersignature of the responsible minister, who in doing so assumes political responsibility for the act in question. This means that federal executive power is exercised in practice by the Federal Government, which is accountable to the Chamber of Representatives in accordance with Article 101 of the Constitution.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **Leopold I[32]**![](image)![](image) King of the Belgians1790\u20131865r.1831-1865![](image) ![](image) ![](image) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe proper title of the Belgian monarch is \"King of the *Belgians*\" rather than \"King of *Belgium*\" as is common for other monarchies throughout Europe. The title is linked to a concept of *popular monarchy* as defined by Kingsley Martin in his work *The Evolution of Popular Monarchy*, published in 1936. According to Martin, the term is meant to emphasize the bond and connection to the people of the land over the territory the state controls.[37] His work further implies that such a monarch is *de facto* appointed by the people as a nominal figurehead rather than being an authoritarian ruler.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| JeanGrand Duke of Luxembourg1921\u20132019r.1964\u20132000 |  | Jos\u00e9phineCharlotteof Belgium1927\u20132005 |  | Fabiolade Mora y Arag\u00f3n1928\u20132014 |  | **Baudouin**King of the Belgians 1930\u20131993r.1951\u20131993![](image)![](image) |  | **Albert II**![](image)King of the Belgiansb. 1934r.1993\u20132013 ![](image)![](image) |  | PaolaRuffo di Calabriab. 1937 |  | Alexanderof Belgium1942\u20132009 |  | L\u00e9aWolmanb. 1951 |  | MarieChristineof Belgiumb. 1951 |  | MarieEsm\u00e9raldaof Belgiumb. 1956 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** French *Certains \u00e9trangers croient - ils le disent souvent - que le maintien de l'unit\u00e9 belge tient \u00e0 la personne du Roi.

They also get personnel, an apartment and/or office, and other amenities, though the legal basis for these is disputed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe current system for providing personnel and other amenities to the former French presidents was devised in 1981 by Michel Charasse, then advisor to President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, in order to care for former president Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing and the widow of former President Georges Pompidou.[21] In 2008, according to an answer by the services of the prime minister to a question from Ren\u00e9 Dosi\u00e8re, a member of the National Assembly,[22] the facilities comprised: a security detail, a car with a chauffeur, first class train tickets and an office or housing space, as well as a two people who service the space. In addition, funds are available for seven permanent assistants. President Hollande announced a reform of the system in 2016. Former presidents of France will no longer receive a car with chauffeur and the personnel in their living space was cut as well. Additionally, the number of assistants available for their use has been reduced, but a state flat or house remains available for former officeholders. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* French Polynesia\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* **Departments**\n |\n| Elections\n* Referendums\n* Presidential\n* Legislative\n* Senate\n* Municipal\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Political parties\n |\n| Foreign relations\n* Africa\n* Americas\n* Asia\n\n\n* France and the United Nations\n\n\n* Foreign alliances\n\n\n* Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Politics of the European Union\n |\n| Related topics\n* Centirism\n* Human rights\n* Political scandals\n |\n| * ![flag](image) France portal\n\n* Other countries\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe president of the Republic is paid a salary according to a pay grade defined in comparison to the pay grades of the most senior members of the French Civil Service (\"out of scale\", *hors \u00e9chelle*, those whose pay grades are known as letters and not as numeric indices). In addition they are paid a residence stipend of 3%, and a function stipend of 25% on top of the salary and residence indemnity. This gross salary and these indemnities are the same as those of the prime minister, and are 50% higher than the highest paid to other members of the government,[13] which is itself defined as twice the average of the highest (pay grade G) and the lowest (pay grade A1) salaries in the \"out of scale\" pay grades.[14] Using the 2008 \"out of scale\" pay grades,[15] it amounts to a monthly pay of 20,963 euros, which fits the 19,000 euros quoted to the press in early 2008.[16] Using the pay grades starting from 1 July 2009,[17] this amounts to a gross monthly pay of \u20ac21,131. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing a further change, the constitutional law of 2008 on the modernization of the institutions of the Fifth Republic, a president cannot serve more than two consecutive terms. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac were previously the only presidents to date who have served a full two terms (14 years for the former, 12 years for the latter). Incumbent Emmanuel Macron is the fourth president (after de Gaulle, Mitterrand, and Chirac) to win re-election, having done so in 2022.\n\n\n\n### Electoral process[edit]\n\n\nFrench presidential elections are conducted using run-off voting, which ensures that the elected president always obtains a majority: if no candidate receives a majority of votes in the first round of voting, the two highest-scoring candidates arrive at a run-off. After a new president is elected, they go through a solemn investiture ceremony called a *passation des pouvoirs* (\"handing over of powers\").[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThey have also the duty of arbitrating the functioning of governmental authorities for efficient service, as the head of state of France.\n\n\n\n* When a majority of the Assembly has opposite political views to that of the president, this leads to political *cohabitation*. In that case, the President's power is diminished, since much of the *de facto* power relies on a supportive prime minister and National Assembly, and is not directly attributed to the post of president.\n* When the majority of the Assembly sides with them, the president can take a more active role and may further influence government policy. The prime minister is then a more personal choice of the president, and can be easily replaced if the administration becomes unpopular. This device has been used in recent years by Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Jacques Chirac, and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Third French Republic the president of the Council of Ministers acted as president whenever the office was vacant.[11] According to article 7 of the Constitution, if the presidency becomes vacant for any reason, or if the president becomes incapacitated, upon the request of the *Gouvernement*, the Constitutional Council may rule, by a majority vote,[12] that the presidency is to be temporarily assumed by the president of the Senate. If the Council rules that the incapacity is permanent, the same procedure as for the resignation is applied, as described above. If the president cannot attend meetings, including meetings of the Council of Ministers, they can ask the prime minister to attend in their stead (Constitution, article 21). This clause has been applied by presidents travelling abroad, ill, or undergoing surgery. During the Second French Republic, there was a vice president. The only person to ever hold the position was Henri Georges Boulay de la Meurthe.\n\n\n\n## Death in office[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2000, a referendum shortened the presidential term from seven years to five years. A maximum of two consecutive terms was imposed after a 2008 constitutional reform.\n\n\n\n## Election[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Presidential elections in France\n\n### Term limits[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1962 presidential referendum, the president has been directly elected by universal suffrage; previously, an electoral college decided the head of state. The length of the presidential term was reduced from seven years to five years following a 2000 referendum; the first election for a shorter term was held in 2002. Then-president Jacques Chirac was first elected in 1995 and again in 2002, and would have been able to run in 2007 had he chosen to, given the lack of term limits.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The president names most officials (with the assent of the cabinet).\n* The president names certain members of the Constitutional Council. (Former presidents are also members of this council)\n* The president receives foreign ambassadors.\n* The president may grant a pardon (but not an amnesty) to convicted criminals; the president can also lessen or suppress criminal sentences. This was of crucial importance when France still operated the death penalty: criminals sentenced to death would generally request that the president commute their sentence to life imprisonment.\n\n\nAll decisions of the president must be countersigned by the prime minister, except dissolving the National Assembly, choice of prime minister, and other dispositions referred to in Article 19.\n\n\n\n### Detailed constitutional powers[edit]\n\n\nThe constitutional attributions of the president are defined in Title II of the Constitution of France.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe presidency of France was first publicly proposed during the July Revolution of 1830, when it was offered to the Marquis de Lafayette. He demurred in favour of Prince Louis Phillipe, who became King of the French. Eighteen years later, during the opening phases of the Second Republic, the title was created for a popularly elected head of state, the first of whom was Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, nephew of Emperor Napoleon. Bonaparte served in that role until he staged an auto coup against the republic, proclaiming himself Napoleon III, Emperor of the French. Under the Third Republic the president was at first quite powerful, mainly because the royalist party was strong when the constitutional laws of 1875 were established, and it was hoped that a member of one of the two branches of the royal family would be able to serve as president and turn France into a constitutional monarchy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Nicolas Sarkozy (2007\u20132012)\n* Fran\u00e7ois Hollande (2012\u20132017)\n* Emmanuel Macron (2017\u2013present)\n |\n| Acting presidents are denoted by italics.\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUpon the death in office, removal, or resignation of the president, the Senate's president takes over as acting president.[10] Alain Poher is the only person to have served in this temporary position, and has done so twice: the first time in 1969 after Charles de Gaulle's resignation and a second time in 1974 after Georges Pompidou's death while in office. In this situation, the president of the Senate becomes Acting President of the Republic; they do not become the new president of the Republic as elected and therefore do not have to resign from their position as President of the Senate. \n\n\nThe first round of a new presidential election must be organized no sooner than twenty days and no later than thirty-five days following the vacancy of the presidency. Fifteen days can separate the first and second rounds of a presidential election; this means that the president of the Senate can only act as President of the Republic for a maximum period of fifty days. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe French Fifth Republic is a semi-presidential system. Unlike other European presidents, the French president is quite powerful. Although the Prime Minister of France, through their government as well as Parliament, oversee much of the nation's actual day-to-day domestic affairs, the French president wields significant influence and authority, especially in the fields of national security and foreign policy. The president's greatest power is the ability to choose the prime minister. However, since it is the French National Assembly that has the sole power to dismiss the prime minister's government, the president is forced to name a prime minister who can command the support of a majority in the assembly. Since 2002, the legislative elections are held a few weeks after the presidential; a majority supporting the president's party or at the very least not opposing the president's choice is therefore very likely to be obtained. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** *D\u00e9cret no 2002-1058 du 6 ao\u00fbt 2002 relatif au traitement des membres du Gouvernement*, article 1 (in French).\n15. **^** Grille de salaires de la fonction publique.\n16. **^** Le salaire du Premier ministre a doubl\u00e9 depuis 2002, citing an interview given by Nicolas Sarkozy to *Le Parisien*.\n17. **^** *D\u00e9cret no 2009-824 du 3 juillet 2009 portant majoration \u00e0 compter du 1er juillet 2009 de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des personnels civils et militaires de l'\u00c9tat, des personnels des collectivit\u00e9s territoriales et des \u00e9tablissements publics d'hospitalisation et portant attribution de points d'indice major\u00e9* (in French).\n18. **^** \"General tax code, art. 80 undecies A\" (in French).

The Constitution of the Fifth Republic, adopted in 1958, greatly increased the president's powers. A 1962 referendum changed the constitution, so that the president would be directly elected by universal suffrage and not by the electoral college established in 1958. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nArticles 67 and 68 organize the regime of criminal responsibility of the president. They were reformed by a 2007 constitutional act[8] in order to clarify a situation that previously resulted in legal controversies.[9] The president of the Republic enjoys immunity during their term: they cannot be requested to testify before any jurisdiction, they cannot be prosecuted, etc. However, the statute of limitation is suspended during their term, and enquiries and prosecutions can be restarted, at the latest one month after they leave office. The president is not deemed personally responsible for their actions in their official capacity, except where their actions are indicted before the International Criminal Court (France is a member of the ICC and the president is a French citizen as another following the Court's rules) or where impeachment is moved against them. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Article 12**: The president of the republic may, after consulting the prime minister and the presidents of the assemblies, declare the National Assembly dissolved.

If there is no president of the Senate, the powers of the president of the republic are exercised by the *Gouvernement*, meaning the Cabinet. This has been interpreted by some constitutional academics as meaning first the prime minister and, if they are themselves not able to act, the members of the cabinet in the order of the list of the decree that nominated them. This is in fact unlikely to happen, because if the president of the Senate is not able to act, the Senate will normally name a new president of the Senate, who will act as President of the Republic. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nHeads of state of the European Union member states\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![Austria](image) Van der Bellen\n* ![Belgium](image) Philippe\n* ![Bulgaria](image) Radev\n* ![Croatia](image) Milanovi\u0107\n* ![Cyprus](image) Christodoulides\n* ![Czech Republic](image) Pavel\n* ![Denmark](image) Frederik X\n* ![Estonia](image) Karis\n* ![Finland](image) Stubb\n* ![France](image) Macron\n* ![Germany](image) Steinmeier\n* ![Greece](image) Sakellaropoulou\n* ![Hungary](image) Sulyok\n* ![Republic of Ireland](image) Higgins\n* ![Italy](image) Mattarella\n* ![Latvia](image) Rink\u0113vi\u010ds\n* ![Lithuania](image) Naus\u0117da\n* ![Luxembourg](image) Henri\n* ![Malta](image) Spiteri Debono\n* ![Netherlands](image) Willem-Alexander\n* ![Poland](image) Duda\n* ![Portugal](image) Rebelo de Sousa\n* ![Romania](image) Iohannis\n* ![Slovakia](image) \u010caputov\u00e1\n* ![Slovenia](image) Pirc Musar\n* ![Spain](image) Felipe VI\n* ![Sweden](image) Carl XVI Gustaf\n |\n| ![flag](image) EU portal\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* ![European Union](image) Borrell (High Representative) (present non-member, non-voting)\n* ![European Union](image) Metsola (President of the Parliament) (partially attending, non-member, non-voting)\n |\n| European Union Portal\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHeads of state of the G20\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![African Union](image)\u00a0 Ghazouani\n* ![Argentina](image)\u00a0Milei\n* ![Australia](image)\u00a0Charles III\n* ![Brazil](image)\u00a0Lula\n* ![Canada](image)\u00a0Charles III\n* ![China](image)\u00a0Xi\n* ![European Union](image)\u00a0Michel\n* ![France](image)\u00a0Macron\n* ![Germany](image)\u00a0Steinmeier\n* ![India](image)\u00a0Murmu\n* ![Indonesia](image)\u00a0Jokowi\n* ![Italy](image)\u00a0Mattarella\n* ![Japan](image)\u00a0Naruhito\n* ![Mexico](image)\u00a0L\u00f3pez Obrador\n* ![Russia](image)\u00a0Putin\n* ![Saudi Arabia](image)\u00a0Salman\n* ![South Africa](image)\u00a0Ramaphosa\n* ![South Korea](image)\u00a0Yoon\n* ![Turkey](image)\u00a0Erdo\u011fan\n* ![United Kingdom](image)\u00a0Charles III\n* ![United States](image)\u00a0Biden\n |\n\nPortals:* ![flag](image) France\n* ![icon](image) Politics\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn order to be admitted as an official candidate, potential candidates must receive signed nominations (known as *parrainages*, for \"sponsors\") from more than 500 elected local officials, mostly mayors.

The president has a ceremonial role (figurehead), but also has the right and duty to act politically.[3] He can give direction to general political and societal debates and have some important \"reserve powers\" in case of political instability (such as those provided for by Article 81 of the Basic Law).[4] The president also holds the prerogative to grant pardons on behalf of the federation. The German presidents, who can be elected to two consecutive five-year terms, have wide discretion about how they exercise their official duties.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nList of presidents of Germany from 1949 \u2013 till date.\n| No. | Portrait\n | Name(Birth\u2013Death) | Term\n | Party\n | Election\n | Deputies(Presidents of the Bundesrat) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *President of the Bundesrat Karl Arnold acted as President from 7 to 12 September 1949.* |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | **Theodor Heuss**(1884\u20131963) | 12 September 1949\u201312 September 1959 |  | FDP | 1949 | Karl Arnold (1949\u20131950)Hans Ehard (1950\u20131951)Hinrich Wilhelm Kopf (1951\u20131952)Reinhold Maier (1952\u20131953)Georg August Zinn (1953\u20131954)Peter Altmeier (1954\u20131955)Kai-Uwe von Hassel (1955\u20131956)Kurt Sieveking (1956\u20131957)Willy Brandt (1957\u20131958)Wilhelm Kaisen (1958\u20131959) |\n| 1954 |\n| 2\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 2012 | Horst Seehofer (2012)Winfried Kretschmann (2012\u20132013)Stephan Weil (2013\u20132014)Volker Bouffier (2014\u20132015)Stanislaw Tillich (2015\u20132016)Malu Dreyer (2016\u20132017) |\n| 12\n | ![](image) | **Frank-Walter Steinmeier**(b. 1956) | 19 March 2017\u2013*Incumbent* |  | SPD\n | 2017 | Malu Dreyer (2017)Michael M\u00fcller (2017\u20132018)Daniel G\u00fcnther (2018\u20132019)Dietmar Woidke (2019\u20132020)Reiner Haseloff (2020\u20132021)Bodo Ramelow (2021\u20132022)Peter Tschentscher (*Incumbent*) |\n| 2022 |\n| **Sources:** |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **This article is part of a series on the** |\n| Politics of Germany |\n| ![](image) |\n| Constitution (Basic Law)\n* Federal Constitutional Court\n* Human rights\n |\n| Head of State\n* **President of Germany**\n\n\n* Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD)\n |\n| Executive\n* **Chancellor of Germany** (list)\n\n\n* Olaf Scholz (SPD)\n\n\n* **Vice Chancellor of Germany**\n\n\n* Robert Habeck (Gr\u00fcne)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Cabinet\nScholz\n* Federal agencies\n |\n| Legislature\n* **Bundestag**\nconstituencies\nmembers\n* **Bundesrat**\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* *Vermittlungsausschuss*\n* *Gemeinsamer Ausschuss*\n |\n| Judiciary\n* Federal Constitutional Court\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Federal courts\n\n\n* Ordinary\n* Administrative\n* Fiscal\n* Labour\n* Social\n\n\n* Joint Senate\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Other courts\n |\n| Subdivisions\n* **State (*Land*)**\n\n\n* Minister president\n* State Parliament (*Landtag*)\ncomposition\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 1999 | Roland Koch (1999)Kurt Biedenkopf (1999\u20132000)Kurt Beck (2000\u20132001)Klaus Wowereit (2001\u20132002)Wolfgang B\u00f6hmer (2002\u20132003)Dieter Althaus (2003\u20132004) |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | **Horst K\u00f6hler**(b. 1943) | 1 July 2004\u201331 May 2010[c] |  | CDU\n | 2004 | Dieter Althaus (2004)Matthias Platzeck (2004\u20132005)Peter Harry Carstensen (2005\u20132006)Harald Ringstorff (2006\u20132007)Ole von Beust (2007\u20132008)Peter M\u00fcller (2008\u20132009)Jens B\u00f6hrnsen (2009\u20132010) |\n| 2009 |\n| *President of the Bundesrat Jens B\u00f6hrnsen acted as President from 31 May to 30 June 2010.* |\n| 10\n | ![](image) | **Christian Wulff**(b. 1959) | 30 June 2010\u201317 February 2012[d] |  | CDU\n | 2010 | Jens B\u00f6hrnsen (2010)Hannelore Kraft (2010\u20132011)Horst Seehofer (2011\u20132012) |\n| *President of the Bundesrat Horst Seehofer acted as President from 17 February to 18 March 2012.* |\n| 11\n | ![](image) | **Joachim Gauck**(b. 1940) | 18 March 2012\u201318 March 2017 |  | Independent\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 17th Federal Convention | 13 February 2022 | Berlin | 1 | Frank-Walter Steinmeier  (**SPD**, **Greens**,  **FDP**, CDU, CSU, SSW) | 1045 (72.7%) | Max Otte (AfD) | 140 (9.74%)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** governing parties in bold\n2. **^** governing parties in bold\n\n### Qualifications[edit]\n\n\nThe office of president is open to all Germans who are entitled to vote in Bundestag elections and have reached the age of 40, but no one may serve more than two consecutive five-year terms.

All government positions of the country, including the presidency, were appointed by the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany on the approval of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\nFollowing the end of communist rule due to the Peaceful Revolution, the head of state became the parliamentary speaker with new, fair elections. Later that year, a draft constitution was written that would have restored the presidency, but ultimately this never materialized.\n\n\n\n### Federal Republic of Germany (\"West Germany\", 1949\u20131990)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Wie wird der Bundespr\u00e4sident bezahlt?\". *www.bundespraesident.de*.\n2. **^** The official title within Germany is **Bundespr\u00e4sident**, with **der Bundesrepublik Deutschland** being added in international correspondence; the official English title is President of the Federal Republic of Germany  \nForeign Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (1990). *German Institutions*.

This means the president \"has the authority to revoke or commute penal or disciplinary sentences in individual cases. The federal president cannot, however, issue an amnesty waiving or commuting sentences for a whole category of offenses. That requires a law enacted by the Bundestag in conjunction with the Bundesrat. Due to the federal structure of Germany the federal president is only responsible for dealing with certain criminal matters (e.g. espionage and terrorism) and disciplinary proceedings against federal civil servants, federal judges, and soldiers\".[18]\n\n\nIt is customary that the federal president becomes the honorary godfather of the seventh child in a family if the parents wish it. He also sends letters of congratulations to centenarians and long-time married couples.[19]\n\n\n\n### Legislative state of emergency[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith the promulgation of the *Grundgesetz* in 1949, the office of President of the Federal Republic (in German: *Bundespr\u00e4sident*) was created in West Germany. Partly due to the misuse of presidential powers in the Weimar Republic, the office's powers were significantly reduced. Not only is he indirectly elected, but most of the real power was transferred to the chancellor.\n\n\nBecause the reunification of Germany in 1990 was accomplished by the five East German states joining the Federal Republic, the president became the president of all German states without the establishment of a new presidential office.\n\n\n\n## List of presidents[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of presidents of Germany\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe president's actions and public appearances represent the state itself, its existence, legitimacy, and unity. The president enjoys a higher ranking at official functions than the chancellor. The president's role is integrative and includes the control function of upholding the law and the constitution. It is a matter of political tradition \u2013 not legal restrictions \u2013 that the president generally does not comment routinely on issues in the news, particularly when there is some controversy among the political parties.[7] This distance from day-to-day politics and daily governmental issues allows the president to be a source of clarification, to influence public debate, voice criticism, offer suggestions and make proposals. In order to exercise this power, he traditionally acts above party politics.[7]\n\n\nThe current officeholder is Frank-Walter Steinmeier who was elected on 12 February 2017 and re-elected on 13 February 2022. He is currently serving his second five-year-term, which began on 19 March 2022.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 12th Federal Convention | 23 May 2004 | Berlin | 1 | Horst K\u00f6hler  (CDU, CSU, FDP) | 604 (50.1%) | Gesine Schwan  (**SPD**, **Greens**) | 589 (48.9%)\n |\n| 13th Federal Convention | 23 May 2009 | Berlin | 1 | Horst K\u00f6hler  (**CDU**, **CSU**, FDP, FW) | 613 (50.1%) | Gesine Schwan  (**SPD**, Greens) | 503 (41.1%)\n |\n| 14th Federal Convention | 30 June 2010 | Berlin | 3 | Christian Wulff  (**CDU**, **CSU**, **FDP**) | 625 (50.2%) | Joachim Gauck  (SPD, Greens) | 494 (39.7%)\n |\n| 15th Federal Convention | 18 March 2012 | Berlin | 1 | Joachim Gauck  (**CDU**, **CSU**, **FDP**, SPD, Greens, Free Voters, SSW) | 991 (79.9%) | Beate Klarsfeld  (The Left) | 126 (10.2%)\n |\n| 16th Federal Convention | 12 February 2017 | Berlin | 1 | Frank-Walter Steinmeier  (**SPD**, **CDU**, **CSU**, Greens, FDP, SSW) | 931 (74.3%) | Christoph Butterwegge  (The Left) | 128 (10.2%)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** \"Das k\u00f6nnt ihr besser\".\n16. **^** \"Hasskriminalit\u00e4t: Gesetz gegen Onlinehetze tritt Ostern in Kraft\". *Der Spiegel*.

In Germany the new head of state was called the *Reichspr\u00e4sident*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe president represents Germany in the world (Art. 59 Basic Law), undertakes foreign visits and receives foreign dignitaries. He also concludes treaties with foreign nations (which do not come into effect until affirmed by the Bundestag), accredits German diplomats and receives the letters of accreditation of foreign diplomats.\n\n\n\n### Pardons and honours[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIf the president dies in office, resigns or is otherwise removed from office, a successor is to be elected within thirty days. Horst K\u00f6hler, upon his resignation on 31 May 2010, became the first president to trigger this re-election process. Jens B\u00f6hrnsen, President of the Senate and Mayor of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen and at the time President of the Bundesrat, became Acting President.[26] Similarly, when Christian Wulff resigned in 2012, it was Horst Seehofer, Minister-President of Bavaria, as President of the Bundesrat, who became Acting President. When Heinrich L\u00fcbke, on the other hand, announced his resignation in 1968, it only came into effect the following year, a mere three months before the scheduled end of his term and after the expedited election of his successor. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile in office, the president enjoys immunity from prosecution and cannot be voted out of office or recalled. The only mechanism for removing the president is impeachment by the Bundestag *or* Bundesrat for willfully violating German law. In either of the two bodies a two-thirds majority is required. Once the Bundestag or the Bundesrat impeaches the president, the Federal Constitutional Court is charged with determining if he is guilty of the offence. If the charge is sustained, the court has the authority to remove the president from office.\n\n\n\n## Presidential office and symbols[edit]\n\n\n### Residences and office[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ceremonial office in Bellevue Palace\nThe official residence of the president is Bellevue Palace in Berlin.

The convention consists of all Bundestag members, as well as an equal number of electors elected by the state legislatures in proportion to their respective populations. Since reunification, all Federal Conventions have had more than 1200 members, as the Bundestag has always had more than 600 parliamentarians since then. It is not required that state electors are chosen from the members of the state legislature; often some prominent citizens are chosen.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe German constitution, the Basic Law, requires that the convention be convened no later than 30 days before the scheduled expiry of the sitting president's term or 30 days after a premature expiry of a president's term. The body is convened and chaired by the President of the Bundestag. From 1979 to 2009, all these conventions were held on 23 May, the anniversary of the foundation of the Federal Republic in 1949. The resignation of Horst K\u00f6hler in 2010, which necessitated an early meeting of the Federal Convention, brought this tradition to an end.\n\n\nIn the first two rounds of the election, the candidate who achieves an absolute majority is elected. If, after two votes, no single candidate has received this level of support, in the third and final vote the candidate who wins a plurality of votes cast is elected.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFriedrich Ebert (SPD) served as Germany's first president, followed by Paul von Hindenburg. The office effectively came to an end upon Hindenburg's death in 1934 and its powers merged with those of the chancellor. Adolf Hitler now ruled Germany as \"F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler\", combining his previous positions in party and government. However, he did officially become president;[29] the office was not abolished (though the constitutionally mandated presidential elections every seven years did not take place in the Nazi era) and briefly revived at the end of the Second World War when Hitler appointed Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz as his successor as \"President of Germany\". D\u00f6nitz agreed to the surrender to the Allies and was arrested a few days later.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter the constitution of every new elected Bundestag, which automatically ends the term of the chancellor, and in every other case in which the office of chancellor has fallen vacant (death or resignation), the president will propose an individual as chancellor and must then, provided the individual is subsequently elected by a majority of the members of the current Bundestag (the so-called *Chancellor-majority)* on the first ballot, appoint the elected candidate to office. However, the Bundestag is also free to disregard the president's proposal (which has, as of 2022, never happened), in which case the parliament must within 14 days elect another individual, whom the parties in the Bundestag now choose themselves, to the post with the same so-called *Chancellor-majority*, whom the president is then obliged to appoint. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Airbus A340 aircraft used by the president\nThe president's car is usually black, made in Germany and has the numberplate \"0 \u2013 1\" with the presidential standard on the right wing of the car. The president also uses a VIP helicopter operated by the Federal Police and VIP aircraft (Bombardier Global 5000, Airbus A319CJ, Airbus A310 or A340) operated by the Executive Transport Wing of the German Air Force. When the president is on board, the flight's callsign is \"German Airforce 001\".\n\n\n\n### Presidential standard[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The standard of the president of Germany as used from 1921 to 1933 and since 1950\nThe standard of the president of Germany was adopted on 11 April 1921, and used in this design until 1933. A slightly modified version also existed from 1926, that was used in addition to the 1921 version. In 1933, these versions were both replaced by another modified version, that was used until 1935.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Since 1948, there have been 12 presidents of Italy. \n\n\nThe official residence of the president is the Quirinal Palace in Rome. Among the Italian presidents, three came from Campania (all from Naples), three from Piedmont, two each from Sardinia (both from Sassari) and from Tuscany, one from Liguria, and one from Sicily. No woman has ever held the office.\n\n\n\n\n## Election[edit]\n\n\nThe president of the Republic is elected by Parliament in a joint session of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. In addition, the 20 regions of Italy appoint 58 representatives as special electors. Three representatives come from each region, save for the small Aosta Valley which appoints one, so as to guarantee representation for all localities and minorities.\n\n\nAccording to the Constitution, the election must be held in the form of secret ballot, with the 315 senators, the 630 deputies and the 58 regional representatives all voting. A two-thirds vote is required to elect on any of the first three rounds of balloting and after that a majority suffices. The election is presided over by the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, who calls for the public counting of the votes. The vote is held in the *Palazzo Montecitorio*, home of the Chamber of Deputies, which is expanded and re-configured for the event.\n\n\nThe president assumes office after having taken an oath before Parliament and delivering a presidential address. Presidents are elected to serve a seven-year term.

Only Enrico De Nicola, who was elected to be provisional head of state by the Constitutional Assembly on 28 June 1946, had an official title and took residence in the Quirinal Palace.[14] The others took the powers, but not the title of Head of State. After the adoption of the Italian Constitution in 1948, the president of the Senate is eligible to take the powers of head of state in case of absence of the President of the Republic.\n\n\n\n\n\n| \u00a0\u00a0DC\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PLI\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PRI\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PPI\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PD\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Independent |\n| --- |\n| Portrait\n | Name(Born\u2013Died) | Term of office\n | Party\n | Election\n | Ref. |\n| Took office\n | Left office\n |\n| ![](image) | **Alcide De Gasperi**(1881\u20131954) | 13 June 1946\n | 1 July 1946\n |  | Christian Democracy | \u2014\n | [k] |\n| 18\u00a0days\n |\n| ![](image) | **Enrico De Nicola**(1877\u20131959) | 1 July 1946\n | 31 December 1947\n |  | Italian Liberal Party | 19461947 | [l] |\n| 1\u00a0year, 183\u00a0days\n |\n| ![](image) | **Cesare Merzagora**(1898\u20131991) | 6 December 1964\n | 29 December 1964\n |  | Independent | \u2014\n | [m] |\n| 23\u00a0days\n |\n| ![](image) | **Amintore Fanfani**(1908\u20131999) | 15 June 1978\n | 9 July 1978\n |  | Christian Democracy | \u2014\n | [n] |\n| 24\u00a0days\n |\n| ![](image) | **Francesco Cossiga**(1928\u20132010) | 29 June 1985\n | 3 July 1985\n |  | Christian Democracy | \u2014\n | [o] |\n| 4\u00a0days\n |\n| ![](image) | **Giovanni Spadolini**(1925\u20131994) | 28 April 1992\n | 28 May 1992\n |  | Italian Republican Party | \u2014\n | [p] |\n| 30\u00a0days\n |\n| ![](image) | **Nicola Mancino**(born 1931) | 15 May 1999\n | 18 May 1999\n |  | Italian People's Party | \u2014\n | [q] |\n| 3\u00a0days\n |\n| ![](image) | **Pietro Grasso**(born 1944) | 14 January 2015\n | 3 February 2015\n |  | Democratic Party | \u2014\n | [r] |\n| 20\u00a0days\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lists of office-holders\n* King of Italy, for previous Italian heads of state between 1861 and 1946\n* List of presidents of Italy by time in office\n* List of prime ministers of Italy\n* Politics of Italy\n* Prime Minister of Italy\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** De Nicola was already provisional head of state since 1 July 1946.\n2. **^** After suffering a serious cerebral hemorrhage, Segni resigned due to health reasons, becoming the first president to do so.\n3. **^** After being involved in a bribery scandal, Leone resigned.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Resigned in order to bring forward the inauguration ceremony of the President-elect.\n5. **^** Cossiga resigned in order to favor the resolution of the political crisis after the 1992 general election.\n6. **^** Scalfaro left the Christian Democracy in 1992, when he was elected president.

For the CIA-published public domain directory, see World Leaders.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a **list of current heads of state and heads of government**. In some cases, mainly in presidential systems, there is only one leader being both head of state and head of government. In other cases, mainly in semi-presidential and parliamentary systems, the head of state and the head of government are different people. In semi-presidential and parliamentary systems, the head of government role (i.e. executive branch) is fulfilled by both the listed head of government and the head of state. In single-party systems, ruling party's leader (i.e. General Secretary) is usually the *de facto* top leader of the state, though sometimes this leader also holds the presidency or premiership.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image)\u00a0France | President\u00a0\u2013 Emmanuel Macron[\u03b1] | Prime Minister\u00a0\u2013 \u00c9lisabeth Borne |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Gabon |

In some cases, mainly in presidential systems, there is only one leader being both head of state and head of government. In other cases, mainly in semi-presidential and parliamentary systems, the head of state and the head of government are different people. In semi-presidential and parliamentary systems, the head of government role (i.e. executive branch) is fulfilled by both the listed head of government and the head of state. In single-party systems, ruling party's leader (i.e. General Secretary) is usually the *de facto* top leader of the state, though sometimes this leader also holds the presidency or premiership.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCurrent heads of government\n |\n| --- |\n| Africa | * ![Algeria](image) Larbaoui\n* ![Burkina Faso](image) Tamb\u00e8la\n* ![Burundi](image) Ndirakobuca\n* ![Cameroon](image) Ngute\n* ![Cape Verde](image) Correia e Silva\n* ![Central African Republic](image) Moloua\n* ![Chad](image) Masra\n* ![Democratic Republic of the Congo](image) Tuluka\n* ![Republic of the Congo](image) Makosso\n* ![Djibouti](image) Mohamed\n* ![Egypt](image) Madbouly\n* ![Equatorial Guinea](image) Botey\n* ![Eswatini](image) Dlamini\n* ![Ethiopia](image) Ahmed\n* ![Gabon](image) Sima\n* ![Guinea](image) Goumou\\*\n* ![Guinea-Bissau](image) Duarte de Barros\n* ![Ivory Coast](image) Beugre Mambe\n* ![Libya](image) Dbeibeh\n* ![Lesotho](image) Matekane\n* ![Madagascar](image) Ntsay\n* ![Mali](image) Ma\u00efga\n* ![Mauritania](image) Ould Bilal\n* ![Mauritius](image) Jugnauth\n* ![Morocco](image) Akhannouch\n* ![Mozambique](image) Maleiane\n* ![Namibia](image) Kuugongelwa\n* ![Niger](image) Zeine\n* ![Rwanda](image) Ngirente\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image)\u00a0Australia | King\u00a0\u2013 Charles III[\u03b2]Governor-General\u00a0\u2013 David Hurley | Prime Minister\u00a0\u2013 Anthony Albanese |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Austria | President\u00a0\u2013 Alexander Van der Bellen | Chancellor\u00a0\u2013 Karl Nehammer |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Azerbaijan | President\u00a0\u2013 Ilham Aliyev | Prime Minister\u00a0\u2013 Ali Asadov |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Bahamas, The | King\u00a0\u2013 Charles III[\u03b2]Governor-General\u00a0\u2013 Cynthia A.

He then received the title of Prince of Orange as heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of the Netherlands at the age of 13.[5]\n\n\nWillem-Alexander attended local state primary school Nieuwe Baarnse Elementary School in Baarn from 1973 to 1979. He went to two different state secondary schools: the Baarns Lyceum in Baarn from 1979 to 1981 and the Eerste Vrijzinnig Christelijk Lyceum in The Hague from 1981 to 1983, and the private sixth-form college United World College of the Atlantic in Wales, the UK (1983 to 1985), from which he received his International Baccalaureate.[5][9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![Liechtenstein](image) Hans-Adam II\n* ![Luxembourg](image) Henri\n* ![Monaco](image) Albert II\n* ![Kingdom of the Netherlands](image) Willem-Alexander\n* ![Norway](image) Harald V\n* ![Spain](image) Felipe VI\n* ![Sweden](image) Carl XVI Gustaf\n* ![United Kingdom](image) Charles III\n* ![Vatican City](image) Francis\n |\n| Oceania | * ![Australia](image) ![New Zealand](image) ![Papua New Guinea](image) ![Solomon Islands](image) ![Tuvalu](image) Charles III\n* ![Tonga](image) Tupou VI\n |\n| * See also: Current heirs of sovereign monarchies\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs king, Willem-Alexander has weekly meetings with the prime minister and speaks regularly with ministers and state secretaries. He also signs all new Acts of Parliament and royal decrees. He represents the kingdom at home and abroad. At the State Opening of Parliament, he delivers the Speech from the Throne, which announces the plans of the government for the parliamentary year. The Constitution requires that the king appoint, dismiss and swear in all government ministers and state secretaries. As king, he is also the President of the Council of State, an advisory body that reviews proposed legislation. In modern practice, the monarch seldom chairs council meetings.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWillem-Alexander is interested in sports and international water management issues. Until his accession to the throne, he was a member of the International Olympic Committee (1998\u20132013),[1] chairman of the Advisory Committee on Water to the Dutch Minister of Infrastructure and the Environment (2004\u20132013),[2] and chairman of the Secretary-General of the United Nations' Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation (2006\u20132013).[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prince Willem-Alexander (left) at age 14 and his brother Friso in 1982\nWillem-Alexander Claus George Ferdinand was born on 27 April 1967 at the Utrecht University Hospital (now known as the University Medical Center Utrecht) in Utrecht, Netherlands.
