Whether a system of individual campuses is counted as one or multiple institutions depends on how that institution is accredited and chartered.

When Hitt took office, UCF's enrollment was 20,302. As of 2014, 60,821 students attend classes on 12 campuses spread across Central Florida. The university consists of 13 colleges and employs more than 10,150 faculty and staff.[7] Under Hitt's direction, UCF raised admissions standards, increased research funding, built new facilities, and established notable partnerships with major research institutions.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** \"University of Central Florida Board of Trustees Term History\" (PDF).

Criteria for admission varies but is generally very selective and includes factors such as indicators of ability, performance, creativity, and talent. Arts programs require competitive auditions and have some of the smallest numbers of undergraduate majors in the university.[129]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John C.
