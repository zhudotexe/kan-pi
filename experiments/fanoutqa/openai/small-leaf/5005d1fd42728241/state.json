His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip hop, country, and rock.[16] When Malone was nine years old,[17] he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the football team Dallas Cowboys.[18][19] Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game *Guitar Hero*.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Malone performing in 2015\nAccording to Malone, he chose \"Post Malone\" as his stage name when he was \"14 or 15\".[24] The name was rumored to be a reference to the professional basketball player Karl Malone,[25] but Malone later explained that \"Post\" is his last name, and he used a \"rap name generator\" to get \"Malone\".[4] At the age of 16, using audio editor Audacity, Malone created his first mixtape, *Young and After Them Riches*.[26] He showed it to some of his classmates at Grapevine High School.[20][27] He was voted \"Most Likely to Become Famous\" by his classmates as a senior in high school. He worked at a Chicken Express as a teenager.[20]\n\n\nAt age 17, Malone released a parody synth-pop ballad song called \"Why Don't You Love Me\" under the alias Leon DeChino, intended for a school project. The song reappeared online in 2016. Malone later referenced the DeChino alias on his song \"Psycho\".[28][29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Schwartz, Danny (August 14, 2015). \"Post Malone Signs With Republic Records\". *HotNewHipHop*.
