Once it starts going, it sometimes cannot remember why it started. It appears as a rhinoceros-like creature made of diamond-hard rock.\n |\n| Rhydon\n | *Saidon* (\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9\u30f3) | 0112 | Ground\n | Rock\n | Rhyhorn (#111) | Rhyperior (#464) | Rhydon was the first Pok\u00e9mon created by Game Freak.[41] Its hide is very tough. Unlike Rhyhorn, it is bipedal. It eventually gained an evolution, Rhyperior, after being traded with a Protector.\n |\n| Chansey\n | *Rakk\u012b* (\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc) | 0113 | Normal\n | Happiny (#440) | Blissey (#242) | In generation II, Blissey was added as an evolution, and in generation IV, Happiny was added as a pre-evolution. In generation I, Chansey was a stand-alone Pok\u00e9mon. It appears as a pink oblong shaped creature with stubby arms and feet. It carries eggs in its pouch and is typically used by Pok\u00e9mon Centres for the egg's healing properties.\n |\n| Tangela\n | *Monjara* (\u30e2\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30e9) | 0114 | Grass\n | Beginning of evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Magby (#240) | Magmortar (#467) | While Magmar was voted the eighth best fire-type Pok\u00e9mon by the *Official Nintendo Magazine* readers,[53] GamesRadar had criticised its design multiple times, noting that its forehead resembles a butt.[54][55] Magmar evolves from Magby and into Magmortar. It is famed for being the first Pok\u00e9mon to learn Fire Punch, and signature Pok\u00e9mon of Gym leader Blaine.\n |\n| Pinsir\n | *Kairosu* (\u30ab\u30a4\u30ed\u30b9) | 0127 | Bug\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Mega Evolution | It likes to throw things with its massive horns. It can throw things two times from its weight. It was originally supposed to have an evolution called \"Plux\" in Generation II. Some speculated this unused design was reworked into Heracross.[*citation needed*] Pinsir appears as a tan-brown bug, similar in appearance to an earwig with its pinchers on its head, and a vertical slit like mouth.

Its design is inspired by the Indigenous North American myth of the thunderbird.[18] This Legendary Pok\u00e9mon is said to cause and appear from dark and gray clouds in the sky while dropping huge thunderbolts. It flies with the crackle and buzz of electricity. It has the power to control electricity and anyone that gets struck by its lightning can gain power from it. It's said that when it rubs its feathers together, lightning will fall immediately after. There are tales of Zapdos resting in pitch black thunderclouds.

Its vicious and raging attitude can decimate cities. It originally had a completely different, more lamprey-esque design in *Red* and *Green*'s early development. It is known to be a hard Pok\u00e9mon to raise by inexperienced trainers. The shiny version is red, and plays a role in the series. It appears normally as a long blue sea dragon, despite not being Dragon-type. It is also the only Flying-type that doesn't fly; instead of this, it can hover.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** \"Rare 'Pok\u00e9mon' Blastoise card sells for $360,000\". *NME*.

It apparently originates in South America. It's said that it appears only to those who have a true heart and a strong passion to see it. Its DNA is said to contain the genetic code of every Pok\u00e9mon and every move. Because of this, many scientists believe that it is the ancestor of all Pok\u00e9mon. If you view its body under a microscope, you can see its fine, small and delicate hairs. It is capable of turning invisible at will so that people are unaware of its presence. It is considered one of the original pregenetor Pok\u00e9mon, as all Pok\u00e9mon descend from Mew.

Dark and Steel types fare well against \"Psychic\" attacks, which was a dominant type in *Red* and *Blue*. The concept of breeding was introduced in the second generation of *Pok\u00e9mon* games as well, which allows players to manipulate the skills of their Pok\u00e9mon to a greater degree.[1] Some of the new Pok\u00e9mon introduced in *Gold* and *Silver* are pre-evolutions of other Pok\u00e9mon, such as Pichu and Igglybuff. These baby Pok\u00e9mon are only available by breeding their evolved forms.\n\n\n*Pok\u00e9mon Gold* and *Silver* were first revealed at Nintendo Space World in 1997. At this point, the game had a massively larger world map than the final game and this prototype featured around 40 Pok\u00e9mon designs that were removed and replaced when the games were released in 1999.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## List of Pok\u00e9mon[edit]\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nList of Pok\u00e9mon species introduced in its second generation\n\n![](image)The international logo for the *Pok\u00e9mon* franchise\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| \nList of Pok\u00e9mon by generation |\n| * Generation I\n* Generation II\n* Generation III\n* Generation IV\n* Generation V\n* Generation VI\n* Generation VII\n* Generation VIII\n* Generation IX\n |\n| \nRelated:\u00a0List of Pok\u00e9mon |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe second generation (Generation\u00a0II) of the *Pok\u00e9mon* franchise features 100\u00a0fictional species of creatures introduced to the core video game series in the 1999 Game Boy Color games *Pok\u00e9mon Gold* and *Silver*, set in the Johto region.

It tends to run across the land, and it is said that somehow the northern winds will blow as it appears. It is always in search of a pure reservoir. Ho-Oh resurrected it after it perished as a helpless unknown animal in a burning tower. Some say that it is a Water type because it symbolizes the rain that put out the fire in the building.

It was one of the first Johto Pok\u00e9mon to appear, as an egg found by Ash and his friends. When it hatched, it bonded to Misty. Throughout the series, it has helped the group in sticky situations using Metronome.\n |\n| Togetic\n | *Togechikku* (\u30c8\u30b2\u30c1\u30c3\u30af)[22] | 0176 | Fairy[nb 2] | Flying\n | Togepi (#175) | Togekiss (#468) | Even though it has wings, it does not need to use them as it is able to hover and glide.

It evolves into Togekiss using a Shiny Stone. In Hoenn, Misty's Togepi ended up evolving into a Togetic and got released.\n |\n| Natu\n | *Neiti* (\u30cd\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3)[13] | 0177 | Psychic\n | Flying\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | It is based on the *Sauropod*. Meganium has the power to revive dead plants with its breath. It has a wafting aroma that soothes anyone around it, and this is because its petals contain a substance that calms aggressive feelings. In battle, it gives off more of its becalming scent to blunt the foe's fighting spirit. Anyone who stands beside it becomes refreshed, just as if they were relaxing in a sunny forest.\n |\n| Cyndaquil\n | *Hinoarashi* (\u30d2\u30ce\u30a2\u30e9\u30b7)[8] | 0155 | Fire\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Quilava (#156) | Cyndaquil is timid and shy. When startled or scared, flames start bursting from the back of it in defense. Its original design had spikes on the back and it was not a Fire type, but an ice type.

It evolved due to a bizarre item. It was updated with the new ability to freely explore space, and even though it does not die in the vacuum of space, it cannot really move around well. Though it now exhibits new expressions and actions, it cannot only learn new things on its own, even things it should not learn, it also developed a language only understood by other Porygon2. It evolves by holding an Up-grade. It never made any appearances in the anime after the events of \"Denno Senshi Porygon\", with the exception of a very brief cameo in the intro scene of the fifteenth movie, *Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice*. It is the only Pok\u00e9mon with a number in its name and one of only two Pok\u00e9mon (outside of Generation VIII) that never appeared in the anime, the other being its evolution, Porygon-Z. In its earliest design, Porygon2 resembled a rounded lion.\n |\n| Stantler\n | *Odoshishi* (\u30aa\u30c9\u30b7\u30b7)[31] | 0234 | Normal\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | *Bur\u016b* (\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc)[13] | 0209 | Fairy[nb 2] | Beginning of evolution\n | Granbull (#210) | When it bares its small fangs at smaller Pok\u00e9mon, they tend to be frightened and run away from Snubbull.

Because its jaws are really heavy, it has to tilt its head back a little to balance itself. It will try not to bite you unless it is startled. It is based on pitbull dogs. It's shiny variant is clearly not beige and therefore must br yellow pink.\n |\n| Qwilfish\n | *Har\u012bsen* (\u30cf\u30ea\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3)[13] | 0211 | Water\n | Poison | No evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | It is the only Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Sketch. Due to this quality Smeargle can learn any move available in the games except Struggle and Chatter. It loves to paint with its tail and the ink it uses to paint with is its own juice it creates.\n |\n| Tyrogue\n | *Baruk\u012b* (\u30d0\u30eb\u30ad\u30fc)[13] | 0236 | Fighting | Beginning of evolution\n | Hitmonchan (#106)Hitmonlee (#107)Hitmontop (#237) | It is always bursting with energy. To make itself stronger, it will keep fighting foes, even if it loses. Even though it is tiny, it should not be ignored because it can slug any unwary target with no hesitation. It has a really strong and combative spirit. Tyrogue will get stressed if it does not train every day, so its trainer must set up various training methods on a schedule to train it. It is famous for fighting bigger foes and tending to its injuries. It evolves into Hitmonlee at high attack stats, Hitmonchan with high defence stats, and Hitmontop with equal attack and defence stats.\n |\n| Hitmontop\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Fairy[nb 3] | Marill (#183) | End of evolution\n | Its ears are wonderful sensors. Even in roaring waters, it can focus its hearing to know what prey is around. When Azurill play in the water, Azumarill will cover them with the air filled bubbles that it creates. Its signature ability is \"Huge Power\" which is exclusive to rabbit and rabbit like Pok\u00e9mon.\n |\n| Sudowoodo\n | *Usokk\u012b* (\u30a6\u30bd\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc)[22] | 0185 | Rock\n | Bonsly (#438) | End of evolution\n | When attacked, Sudowoodo will go into the forest and stand still as if it resemble a tree, though in winter, it is easily seen due to the green parts on its body. Despite resembling a tree, it is actually a Rock-type, In Gold and Silver, it blocks a path north. To get past it, the player needs the water pale. In the anime, Brock had a Bonsly that evolved into Sudowoodo.\n |\n| Politoed\n | *Nyorotono* (\u30cb\u30e7\u30ed\u30c8\u30ce)[13] | 0186 | Water\n | Poliwhirl (#061) | End of evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | *Kapoer\u0101* (\u30ab\u30dd\u30a8\u30e9\u30fc)[22] | 0237 | Fighting | Tyrogue (#236) | End of evolution\n | Its elegant dance-like fighting style could get you drilled hard if you are not careful. If it launches kicks while spinning, it can essentially drill its way into the ground. It gets around faster while spinning rather than walking, which can be used both for offense and defense. After it does a handstand, it will show off its fancy display of kicks. When it fights while spinning, its centrifugal force gets 10x stronger. Like its counterparts, Hitmontop is based on a unique fighting style, capoeira.\n |\n| Smoochum\n | *Much\u016bru* (\u30e0\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb) | 0238 | Ice\n | Psychic\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Jynx (#124) | It likes to run, yet despite this, it often trips over itself.
