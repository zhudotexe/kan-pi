Dark and Steel types fare well against \"Psychic\" attacks, which was a dominant type in *Red* and *Blue*. The concept of breeding was introduced in the second generation of *Pokémon* games as well, which allows players to manipulate the skills of their Pokémon to a greater degree.[1] Some of the new Pokémon introduced in *Gold* and *Silver* are pre-evolutions of other Pokémon, such as Pichu and Igglybuff. These baby Pokémon are only available by breeding their evolved forms.\n\n\n*Pokémon Gold* and *Silver* were first revealed at Nintendo Space World in 1997.

It tends to run across the land, and it is said that somehow the northern winds will blow as it appears. It is always in search of a pure reservoir. Ho-Oh resurrected it after it perished as a helpless unknown animal in a burning tower. Some say that it is a Water type because it symbolizes the rain that put out the fire in the building. It is the main legendary of Pokémon Crystal. It had a major role in *Pokémon 4Ever*.\n |\n| Larvitar\n | *Yōgirasu* (ヨーギラス)[13] | 0246 | Rock\n | Ground\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Pupitar (#247) | Born deep underground, it cannot emerge until it has eaten a mountain's worth of soil to get to its parents.

MissingNo., a glitch, is also on this list.\n\n\n\n\n## Design and development[edit]\n\n\nThe majority of Pokémon in generation I had relatively simple designs and were similar to real-life creatures including Pidgey (a pigeon), Krabby (a crab), Rattata (a rat), and Ekans (a snake). Many Pokémon in the original games served as the base for repeating concepts later in the series.[1]\n\n\n\n## Table of Dexes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Dex name | No. of Pokémon in Dex | No. in National Dex | percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kanto Dex [Red, Green, Blue and Yellow]\n | 151\n | 151\n | 100%  100%\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n |\n\n\n## List of Pokémon[edit]\n\n\nPokémon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Details on Pokémon names, National Pokédex numbers, types and evolutions are obtained from The Pokémon Company International's online Pokédex.[2]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Prior to *X* and *Y*, Clefairy, Clefable, Jigglypuff, and Wigglytuff were pure Normal types while Mr. Mime was pure Psychic.\n3. **^** Galarian Meowth (introduced in *Pokémon Sword* and *Shield*) are capable of evolving into Perrserker.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Prior to *Gold* and *Silver*, Magnemite and Magneton were pure Electric types.\n5. **^** Only Galarian Farfetch'd (introduced in *Pokémon Sword* and *Shield*) are capable of evolving into Sirfetch'd.\n6. **^** Only Galarian Mr. Mime (introduced in *Pokémon Sword* and *Shield*) are capable of evolving into Mr. Rime.\n7. **^** Eevee is capable of evolving into Vaporeon (#134), Jolteon (#135), Flareon (#136), Espeon (#196), Umbreon (#197), Leafeon (#470), Glaceon (#471) or Sylveon (#700).\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Generation V | Generation VI | Generation VII | Generation VIII | Generation IX |\n| * *Black* / *White*\n\t+ *Black 2* / *White 2*\n\n\n* Pokémon\n\t+ Chandelure\n | * *X* / *Y*\n* *Omega Ruby* / *Alpha Sapphire*\n\n\n* Pokémon\n\t+ Klefki\n | * *Sun* / *Moon*\n\t+ *Ultra Sun* / *Ultra Moon*\n* *Let's Go, Pikachu!* / *Let's Go, Eevee!*\n\n\n* Pokémon\n\t+ Popplio, Brionne, and Primarina\n\t+ Mimikyu\n | * *Sword* / *Shield*\n\t+ *Isle of Armor*\n\t+ *Crown Tundra*\n* *Brilliant Diamond* / *Shining Pearl*\n* *Legends: Arceus*\n\n\n* Pokémon\n\t+ Sobble\n\t+ Wooloo\n\t+ Galarian Corsola\n\t+ Fossil Pokémon\n | * *Scarlet* / *Violet*\n\t+ *Hidden Treasure of Area Zero*\n\t+ \"Celestial\"\n\t+ \"Biri-Biri\"\n* *Legends: Z-A*\n\n\n* Pokémon\n\t+ Sprigatito, Floragato, and Meowscarada\n\t+ Fuecoco\n\t+ Tinkaton\n |\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Generation I | Generation II | Generation III | Generation IV |\n| * *Red* / *Blue* / *Yellow*\n\n\n* Lavender Town\n\n\n* Team Rocket\n\n\n* Pokémon + Bulbasaur\n\t+ Charizard\n\t+ Squirtle\n\t+ Pikachu\n\t+ Raichu\n\t+ Jigglypuff\n\t+ Psyduck\n\t+ Slowpoke\n\t+ Gengar\n\t+ Voltorb\n\t+ Mr. Mime\n\t+ Jynx\n\t+ Magikarp and Gyarados\n\t+ Ditto\n\t+ Eevee\n\t+ Snorlax\n\t+ Mewtwo\n\t+ Mew\n\t+ MissingNo.\n | * *Gold* / *Silver*\n\t+ *Crystal*\n\n\n* Pokémon\n\t+ Wooper\n\t+ Unown\n | * *Ruby* / *Sapphire*\n\t+ *Emerald*\n* *FireRed* / *LeafGreen*\n\n\n* Pokémon\n\t+ Gardevoir\n | * *Diamond* / *Pearl*\n\t+ *Platinum*\n* *HeartGold* / *SoulSilver*\n\n\n* Pokémon\n\t+ Pachirisu\n\t+ Garchomp\n\t+ Lucario\n |\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Rhydon (#112) | Its tackles can demolish skyscrapers, but its memory isn't the best. Once it starts going, it sometimes cannot remember why it started. It appears as a rhinoceros-like creature made of diamond-hard rock.\n |\n| Rhydon\n | *Saidon* (サイドン) | 0112 | Ground\n | Rock\n | Rhyhorn (#111) | Rhyperior (#464) | Rhydon was the first Pokémon created by Game Freak.[41] Its hide is very tough. Unlike Rhyhorn, it is bipedal. It eventually gained an evolution, Rhyperior, after being traded with a Protector.\n |\n| Chansey\n | *Rakkī* (ラッキー) | 0113 | Normal\n | Happiny (#440) | Blissey (#242) | In generation II, Blissey was added as an evolution, and in generation IV, Happiny was added as a pre-evolution. In generation I, Chansey was a stand-alone Pokémon. It appears as a pink oblong shaped creature with stubby arms and feet. It carries eggs in its pouch and is typically used by Pokémon Centres for the egg's healing properties.\n |\n| Tangela\n | *Monjara* (モンジャラ) | 0114 | Grass\n | Beginning of evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Magby (#240) | Magmortar (#467) | While Magmar was voted the eighth best fire-type Pokémon by the *Official Nintendo Magazine* readers,[53] GamesRadar had criticised its design multiple times, noting that its forehead resembles a butt.[54][55] Magmar evolves from Magby and into Magmortar. It is famed for being the first Pokémon to learn Fire Punch, and signature Pokémon of Gym leader Blaine.\n |\n| Pinsir\n | *Kairosu* (カイロス) | 0127 | Bug\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Mega Evolution | It likes to throw things with its massive horns. It can throw things two times from its weight. It was originally supposed to have an evolution called \"Plux\" in Generation II. Some speculated this unused design was reworked into Heracross.[*citation needed*] Pinsir appears as a tan-brown bug, similar in appearance to an earwig with its pinchers on its head, and a vertical slit like mouth. It gains the Flying type upon Mega Evolution.\n |\n| Tauros\n | *Kentarosu* (ケンタロス) | 0128 | Normal\n | No evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bulbasaur\n* Ivysaur\n* Venusaur\n* Charmander\n* Charmeleon\n* Charizard\n* Squirtle\n* Wartortle\n* Blastoise\n* Caterpie\n* Metapod\n* Butterfree\n* Weedle\n* Kakuna\n* Beedrill\n* Pidgey\n* Pidgeotto\n* Pidgeot\n* Rattata\n* Raticate\n* Spearow\n* Fearow\n* Ekans\n* Arbok\n* Pikachu\n* Raichu\n* Sandshrew\n* Sandslash\n* Nidoran♀\n* Nidorina\n* Nidoqueen\n* Nidoran♂\n* Nidorino\n* Nidoking\n* Clefairy\n* Clefable\n* Vulpix\n* Ninetales\n* Jigglypuff\n* Wigglytuff\n* Zubat\n* Golbat\n* Oddish\n* Gloom\n* Vileplume\n* Paras\n* Parasect\n* Venonat\n* Venomoth\n* Diglett\n* Dugtrio\n* Meowth\n* Persian\n* Psyduck\n* Golduck\n* Mankey\n* Primeape\n* Growlithe\n* Arcanine\n* Poliwag\n* Poliwhirl\n* Poliwrath\n* Abra\n* Kadabra\n* Alakazam\n* Machop\n* Machoke\n* Machamp\n* Bellsprout\n* Weepinbell\n* Victreebel\n* Tentacool\n* Tentacruel\n* Geodude\n* Graveler\n* Golem\n* Ponyta\n* Rapidash\n* Slowpoke\n* Slowbro\n* Magnemite\n* Magneton\n* Farfetch'd\n* Doduo\n* Dodrio\n* Seel\n* Dewgong\n* Grimer\n* Muk\n* Shellder\n* Cloyster\n* Gastly\n* Haunter\n* Gengar\n* Onix\n* Drowzee\n* Hypno\n* Krabby\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Lapras | *Rapurasu* (ラプラス) | 0131 | Water\n | Ice\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Gigantamax | It has a very gentle nature and was hunted before it became illegal. Gigantamax Lapras is exclusive to *Shield*. Lapras is based on the Loch Ness Monster and the plesiosaur. In the games, any Pokémon that uses Surf appears in the overworld as a Lapras or a Mantine. Its Gigantamax form has \"water magic\" around it.\n |\n| Ditto\n | *Metamon* (メタモン) | 0132 | Normal\n | No evolution\n | Ditto is capable of transforming into any Pokémon that it comes across. It was originally intended to have an evolution in Generation II called \"Animon\" which would have evolved from a Metal Coat. Fan speculation is that Ditto and Mew are related as Mew can also use Transform, a move exclusive to Ditto.[*citation needed*] In the anime, Ditto belonging to Duplica had an issue with accurately mimicking appearances where its face always looked like Ditto's own. It appears as a pink blob or amoeba.\n |\n| Eevee | *Ībui* (イーブイ) | 0133 | Normal\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | *Hakuryū* (ハクリュー) | 0148 | Dragon | Dratini (#147) | Dragonite (#149) | Dragonair are longer in length (and bigger in size) than Dratini, have wings for ears, and can fly using an unknown power.\n |\n| Dragonite\n | *Kairyū* (カイリュー) | 0149 | Dragon | Flying\n | Dragonair (#148) | End of evolution\n | It is a large orange dragon Pokémon that flies at high-speed. It zooms off over seas to challenge other Pokémon. It has been reputed to guide sailors in storms to the nearest land. Unlike Charizard, it actually is a dragon in both appearance and type.

Its design is inspired by the Indigenous North American myth of the thunderbird.[18] This Legendary Pokémon is said to cause and appear from dark and gray clouds in the sky while dropping huge thunderbolts. It flies with the crackle and buzz of electricity. It has the power to control electricity and anyone that gets struck by its lightning can gain power from it. It's said that when it rubs its feathers together, lightning will fall immediately after. There are tales of Zapdos resting in pitch black thunderclouds.

Magikarp is based on the common carp.[42] At level 15, Magikarp learns Tackle. Until then, it only knows Splash and cannot be taught any TMs or HMs.\n |\n| Gyarados | *Gyaradosu* (ギャラドス) | 0130 | Water\n | Flying\n | Magikarp (#129) | Mega Evolution | In the beta versions for *Pokémon Red* and *Blue*, Gyarados was originally named \"Skullkraken\".[*citation needed*] Gyarados is inspired by the myth of a carp jumping over the Dragon Gate. Its vicious and raging attitude can decimate cities. It originally had a completely different, more lamprey-esque design in *Red* and *Green*'s early development. It is known to be a hard Pokémon to raise by inexperienced trainers. The shiny version is red, and plays a role in the series. It appears normally as a long blue sea dragon, despite not being Dragon-type. It is also the only Flying-type that doesn't fly; instead of this, it can hover.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** \"Rare 'Pokémon' Blastoise card sells for $360,000\". *NME*.

It apparently originates in South America. It's said that it appears only to those who have a true heart and a strong passion to see it. Its DNA is said to contain the genetic code of every Pokémon and every move. Because of this, many scientists believe that it is the ancestor of all Pokémon. If you view its body under a microscope, you can see its fine, small and delicate hairs. It is capable of turning invisible at will so that people are unaware of its presence. It is considered one of the original pregenetor Pokémon, as all Pokémon descend from Mew. It fought Mewtwo during the Pokémon movies.\n |\n| MissingNo. | *Ketsuban* (けつばん) | None[nb 8] | Bird[nb 9] | Normal\n | No evolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | It is part of the Legendary Bird Trio. Its design is inspired by the firebird of Slavic folklore.[18] This Legendary Pokémon can make the sky turn red as it flaps its fiery wings, creating a dazzling flash of fire. It's truly a sight to see. It's said to bring spring early when it arrives to lands. If Moltres is injured, it is said to dip itself in magma to burn and heal itself. Those who see it are overwhelmed by its orange fiery wings. There are stories that tell of its fire cloaked wings lighting up paths for those lost traveling in the mountains. Its Galarian form is a Dark/Flying-type.\n |\n| Dratini\n | *Miniryū* (ミニリュウ) | 0147 | Dragon | Beginning of evolution\n | Dragonair (#148) | Its existence was unknown until a fisherman pulled it up after fishing for about ten hours.

To prevent them from rolling into the homes of people downhill, grooves have been dug into the sides of mountains to serve as guideways for diverting this Pokémon's course. Golem has an Alolan form that is Rock/Electric-type. It appears as a large boulder that has a head, arms, and legs. It can roll up into a perfectly round rock. Its Alolan form is magnetic and has a rock cannon on its shoulders.\n |\n| Ponyta\n | *Ponīta* (ポニータ) | 0077 | Fire\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Rapidash (#078) | Its Galarian form is Psychic-type.

It accumulates negative ions in the air to dish out 10,000 volt discharges. It is a moody Pokémon, easily becoming sad or angry. Its spiky fur can be launched to pierce enemies when it bristles. Jolteon's cells emit a low amount of electricity, which is amplified by its fur. If its hair stands on end, it is about to discharge. The crackling sound of electricity can be heard when it exhales. It evolves from Eevee using a Thunder Stone.\n |\n| Flareon\n | *Būsutā* (ブースター) | 0136 | Fire\n | Eevee (#133) | End of evolution\n | Flareon shares its category name with Charmeleon, Charizard, Moltres, and Infernape, who are all known as the Flame Pokémon.
