More than 200 skyscrapers and 4,000[1] high-rise buildings have already been constructed in the city of Mumbai. (A skyscraper is defined as a continuously habitable high-rise building that has over 40 floors and is taller than approximately 150 metres (492\u00a0ft) according to international standards.)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first skyscrapers in Mumbai were constructed during the 1970s, when Usha Kiran and Matru Mandir were developed and stood at about 76 metres (250 feet), or 25 floors, each. After a significant lull, construction projects since the mid-1990s began taking the skyline upwards, with a major acceleration in the pace of development since 2000, when the Lower Parel area began developing. Palais Royale structurally topped out in 2018 and is the tallest building in the country with a height of 320 meters.\n\n\n\n\n## List of tallest buildings in Mumbai[edit]\n\n\nThis list ranks the tallest completed and topped out buildings in Mumbai that stand at least 150\u00a0m (492\u00a0ft) as of October 2023.
