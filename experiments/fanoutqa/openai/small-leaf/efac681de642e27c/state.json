Cutler \u2013 a scholar of political science at Carleton University,[63] the terms South Asia, Southwest Asia, and Central Asia are distinct, but the confusion and disagreements have arisen due to the geopolitical movement to enlarge these regions into Greater South Asia, Greater Southwest Asia, and Greater Central Asia. The frontier of Greater South Asia, states Cutler, between 2001 and 2006 has been geopolitically extended to eastern Iran and western Afghanistan in the west, and in the north to northeastern Iran, northern Afghanistan, and southern Uzbekistan.[63]\n\n\nIdentification with a South Asian identity was found to be significantly low among respondents in an older two-year survey across Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[64]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor a topical guide, see Outline of South Asian history. For a chronological guide, see Timeline of South Asian history.\n\n### Pre-history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe common definition of South Asia is largely inherited from the administrative boundaries of the Indian Empire,[24] with several exceptions. The current territories of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan which were the core territories of the British Empire from 1857 to 1947 also form the core territories of South Asia.[25][26] The mountain countries of Nepal and Bhutan, two independent countries that were not under the British Raj but were protectorates of the Empire,[27] and the island countries of Sri Lanka and Maldives are generally included. By various definitions based on substantially different reasons, the British Indian Ocean Territory and the Tibet Autonomous Region may be included as well.[28][29][30][31][32][33][34] Myanmar (Burma), a former British colony and now largely considered a part of Southeast Asia, is also sometimes included.[18][20][35] Afghanistan is also included by some sources.[18][20][36][37]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Places adjacent to South Asia\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Central AsiaWest Asia | Central Asia, East Asia | East

Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), a contiguous block of countries, started in 1985 with seven countries\u00a0\u2013 Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka\u00a0\u2013 and admitted Afghanistan as an eighth member in 2007.[39][40] China and Myanmar have also applied for the status of full members of SAARC.[41][42] The South Asia Free Trade Agreement admitted Afghanistan in 2011.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Various definitions of South Asia, including the definition by the United Nations geoscheme which was created for \"statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories.\"[17]\nThe geographical extent is not clear cut as systemic and foreign policy orientations of its constituents are quite asymmetrical.[18] Beyond the core territories of the Indian Empire (territories of the British Empire which were under the system of British Raj), there is a high degree of variation as to which other countries are included in South Asia.[19][20][21][22] There is no clear boundary \u2013 geographical, geopolitical, socio-cultural, economical, or historical \u2013 between South Asia and other parts of Asia, especially Southeast Asia and West Asia.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is an economic cooperation organization in the region which was established in 1985 and includes all eight nations comprising South Asia.[10] The core countries of South Asia have a total area of 4.4\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (1.7\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), which is 10% of the Asian continent.[8] The population of the region, under the broader definition, is about 1.9\u00a0billion[1] or about one-fourth of the world's population, making it both the most populous and the most densely populated geographical region in the world.[11]\n\n\nIn 2022, South Asia had the world's largest populations of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, and Zoroastrians.[12] South Asia alone accounts for 90.47% of Hindus, 95.5% of Sikhs, and 31% of Muslims worldwide, as well as 35 million Christians and 25\u00a0million Buddhists.[13][14][15][16]\n\n\n\n\n## Definition[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Country | Area in km2 | EEZ | Shelf | EEZ+TIA\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |

Indo-Aryan languages are in green, Iranic languages in dark green, Dravidian languages in purple, and Tibeto-Burman languages in red.There are numerous languages in South Asia. The spoken languages of the region are largely based on geography and shared across religious boundaries, but the written script is sharply divided by religious boundaries. In particular, Muslims of South Asia such as in Afghanistan and Pakistan use the Arabic alphabet and Persian Nastaliq. Till 1952, Muslim-majority Bangladesh (then known as East Pakistan) also mandated only the Nastaliq script, but after that adopted regional scripts and particularly Bengali, after the Language Movement for the adoption of Bengali as the official language of the then East Pakistan. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe boundaries of South Asia vary based on how the region is defined. South Asia's northern, eastern, and western boundaries vary based on definitions used, while the Indian Ocean is the southern periphery. Most of this region rests on the Indian Plate and is isolated from the rest of Asia by mountain barriers.[52][53] Much of the region consists of a peninsula in south-central Asia, rather resembling a diamond which is delineated by the Himalayas on the north, the Hindu Kush in the west, and the Arakanese in the east,[54] and which extends southward into the Indian Ocean with the Arabian Sea to the southwest and the Bay of Bengal to the southeast.[28][55]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 accelerated efforts to form a union to restrengthen deteriorating regional security.[311] After agreements, the union, known as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), was finally established in Dhaka in December 1985.[312] However, deterioration of India-Pakistan ties have led India to emphasize more on sub-regional groups SASEC, BIMSTEC and BBIN.\n\n\nSouth Asia continues to remain the least integrated region in the world. While in East Asia, regional trade accounts for 50% of total trade, it accounts for only a little more than 5% in South Asia.[313]\n\n\nPopulism is a general characteristic of internal politics of India.[314]\n\n\n\n#### Regional groups of countries[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)While South Asia had never been a coherent geopolitical region, it has a distinct geographical identity[35][54]\nThe terms \"Indian subcontinent\" and \"South Asia\" are sometimes used interchangeably.[28][55][56][57][58] The Indian subcontinent is largely a geological term referring to the land mass that drifted northeastwards from ancient Gondwana, colliding with the Eurasian plate nearly 55 million years ago, towards the end of Palaeocene. This geological region largely includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.[59] Historians Catherine Asher and Cynthia Talbot state that the term \"Indian subcontinent\" describes a natural physical landmass in South Asia that has been relatively isolated from the rest of Eurasia.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** Mann, Michael (2014). *South Asia's Modern History: Thematic Perspectives*.
