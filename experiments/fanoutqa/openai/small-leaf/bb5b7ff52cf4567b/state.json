The conference headquarters are in Princeton, New Jersey. The term *Ivy League* is typically used outside sports to refer to the eight schools as a group of elite colleges with connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism.[2][3][4][5][6] Its members are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, Princeton University, University of Pennsylvania, and Yale University.\n\n\nThe term was used as early as 1933; it became official only after the formation of the athletic conference in 1954.[7] All of the \"Ivies\" except Cornell were founded during the colonial period; they are seven of the nine colonial colleges, those chartered before the American Revolution. The other two colonial colleges, Rutgers University and the College of William & Mary, became public institutions.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** Gwertzman, Bernard M.

These schools were known for their long-standing traditions in intercollegiate athletics, often being the first schools to participate in such activities.

In 1893, an alumnus told *The Harvard Crimson*, \"In 1850, class day was placed upon the University Calendar. ... the custom of planting the ivy, while the ivy oration was delivered, arose about this time.\"[46] At Penn, graduating seniors started the custom of planting ivy at a university building each spring in 1873 and that practice was formally designated as \"Ivy Day\" in 1874.[47] Ivy planting ceremonies are recorded at Yale, Simmons College, and Bryn Mawr College among other schools.[48][49][50] Princeton's \"Ivy Club\" was founded in 1879.[51]\n\n\nThe first usage of *Ivy* in reference to a group of colleges is from sportswriter Stanley Woodward (1895\u20131965).\n\n\n\n\n> A proportion of our eastern ivy colleges are meeting little fellows another Saturday before plunging into the strife and the turmoil.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aStanley Woodward, *New-York Tribune*, October 14, 1933, describing the football season[52]\n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the time before recruiting for college sports became dominated by those offering athletic scholarships and lowered academic standards for athletes, the Ivy League was successful in many sports relative to other universities in the country. In particular, Princeton won 26 recognized national championships in college football (last in 1935), and Yale won 18 (last in 1927).[223] Both of these totals are considerably higher than those of other historically strong programs such as Alabama, which has won 15, Notre Dame, which claims 11 but is credited by many sources with 13, and USC, which has won 11. Yale, whose coach Walter Camp was the \"Father of American Football,\" held on to its place as the all-time wins leader in college football throughout the entire 20th century, but was finally passed by Michigan on November 10, 2001. Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Penn each have over a dozen former scholar-athletes enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe term *Ivy Plus* is sometimes used to refer to the original eight institutions (in this context **the Ancient Eight**)[252][253][254] plus several other schools for purposes of alumni associations,[255][256] university consortia,[256][257][258][259] or endowment comparisons.[260][261][262][263] In his book *Untangling the Ivy League*, Zawel writes, \"The inclusion of non\u2013Ivy League schools under this term is commonplace for some schools and extremely rare for others. Among these other schools, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University are almost always included. The University of Chicago and Duke University are often included as well.\"[256] The term *IvyPlus* also refers to a formal exchange scholar program that includes all the Ivy League schools as well as Berkeley, Chicago, MIT, and Stanford.[264][110][111]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Ivies have been competing in sports as long as intercollegiate sports have existed in the United States. Rowing teams from Harvard and Yale met in the first sporting event held between students of two U.S. colleges on Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire, on August 3, 1852. Harvard's team, \"The Oneida\", won the race and was presented with trophy black walnut oars from then-presidential nominee General Franklin Pierce. The proposal did not succeed\u2014on January 11, 1937, the athletic authorities at the schools rejected the \"possibility of a heptagonal league in football such as these institutions maintain in basketball, baseball and track.\" However, they noted that the league \"has such promising possibilities that it may not be dismissed and must be the subject of further consideration.\"[72]\n\n\n\n#### Integration of athletic competition in the *Ivy League*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn average, each Ivy school has more than 35 varsity teams. All eight are in the top 20 for number of sports offered for both men and women among Division I schools. Unlike most Division I athletic conferences, the Ivy League prohibits the granting of athletic scholarships; all scholarships awarded are need-based (financial aid).[219] In addition, the Ivies have a rigid policy against redshirting, even for medical reasons; an athlete loses a year of eligibility for every year enrolled at an Ivy institution.[220] Additionally, the Ivies prohibit graduate students from participating in intercollegiate athletics, even if they have remaining athletic eligibility.[221] The only exception to the ban on graduate students was that seniors graduating in 2021 were allowed to play at their current institutions as graduate students in 2021\u201322. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe phrase *Ivy League* historically has been perceived as connected not only with academic excellence but also with social elitism. In 1936, sportswriter John Kieran noted that student editors at Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Princeton, Cornell, Dartmouth, and Penn were advocating the formation of an athletic association. In urging them to consider \"Army and Navy and Georgetown and Fordham and Syracuse and Brown and Pitt\" as candidates for membership, he exhorted:\n\n\n\n\n> It would be well for the proponents of the Ivy League to make it clear (to themselves especially) that the proposed group would be inclusive but not \"exclusive\" as this term is used with a slight up-tilting of the tip of the nose.[190]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWithin a year of this statement and having held month-long discussions about the proposal, on December 3, 1936, the idea of \"the formation of an Ivy League\" gained enough traction among the undergraduate bodies of the universities that the *Columbia Daily Spectator*, *The Cornell Daily Sun*, *The Dartmouth*, *The Harvard Crimson*, *The Daily Pennsylvanian*, *The Daily Princetonian* and the *Yale Daily News* would simultaneously run an editorial entitled \"Now Is the Time\", encouraging the seven universities to form the league in an effort to preserve the ideals of athletics.[70] Part of the editorial read as follows:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n229. **^** \"Ivy League\".

Harvard University uses the date that the legislature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony formally allocated funds for the creation of a college. Harvard was chartered in 1650, although classes had been conducted for approximately a decade by then. The University of Pennsylvania initially considered its founding date to be 1750; this is the year which appears on the first iteration of the university seal.[45] Later in Penn's early history, the university changed its officially recognized founding date to 1749, which was used for all of the nineteenth century, including a centennial celebration in 1849. In 1899, Penn's board of trustees formally adopted a third founding date of 1740, in response to a petition from Penn's General Alumni Society. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1954, the presidents extended the Ivy Group Agreement to all intercollegiate sports, effective with the 1955\u201356 basketball season. This is generally reckoned as the formal formation of the Ivy League. As part of the transition, Brown, the only Ivy that had not joined the EIBL, did so for the 1954\u201355 season. A year later, the Ivy League absorbed the EIBL. The Ivy League claims the EIBL's history as its own. Through the EIBL, it is the oldest basketball conference in Division I.[84][85]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Princeton | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | 14\n |\n| Yale | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | 13\n |\n| Totals | 8 | 8 | 8 | 5 | 8 | 7 | 7 | 6 | 8 | 7 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 104\n |\n\n\n#### Men's varsity sports not sponsored by the Ivy League[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe table above includes the number of team championships won from the beginning of official Ivy League competition (1956\u201357 academic year) through 2016\u201317. Princeton and Harvard have on occasion won ten or more Ivy League titles in a year, an achievement accomplished 10 times by Harvard and 24 times by Princeton, including a conference-record 15 championships in 2010\u201311. Only once has one of the other six schools earned more than eight titles in a single academic year (Cornell with nine in 2005\u201306). In the 38 academic years beginning 1979\u201380, Princeton has averaged 10 championships per year, one-third of the conference total of 33 sponsored sports.[233]\n\n\nIn the 12 academic years beginning 2005\u201306 Princeton has won championships in 31 different sports, all except wrestling and men's tennis.[234]\n\n\n\n### Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n257. **^** \"Ivy Plus Sustainability Working Group\".

During that time Penn has had 8 undefeated Ivy League Football Championships and Harvard has had 6 undefeated Ivy League Football Championships.[238] In men's lacrosse, Cornell and Princeton are perennial rivals, and they are two of three Ivy League teams to have won the NCAA tournament.[239] In 2009, the Big Red and Tigers met for their 70th game in the NCAA tournament.[240] No team other than Harvard or Princeton has won the men's swimming conference title outright since 1972, although Yale, Columbia, and Cornell have shared the title with Harvard and Princeton during this time. Similarly, no program other than Princeton and Harvard has won the women's swimming championship since Brown's 1999 title. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTotal championships won (1956\u20132017)\n| Institution\n | Ivy League  championships\n | NCAA team  championships\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Princeton University Tigers\n | 476\n | 12\n |\n| Harvard University Crimson\n | 415\n | 4\n |\n| Cornell University Big Red\n | 231\n | 5\n |\n| University of Pennsylvania Quakers\n | 210\n | 3\n |\n| Yale University Bulldogs\n | 202\n | 3\n |\n| Dartmouth College Big Green\n | 140\n | 3\n |\n| Brown University Bears\n | 123\n | 7\n |\n| Columbia University Lions\n | 105\n | 11\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1881, Penn, Harvard College, Haverford College, Princeton College (then known as College of New Jersey), and Columbia College formed The Intercollegiate Cricket Association,[64] which Cornell University later joined.[65] Penn won The Intercollegiate Cricket Association championship (the *de facto* national championship) 23 times (18 solo, 3 shared with Haverford and Harvard, 1 shared with Haverford and Cornell, and 1 shared with just Haverford) during the 44 years that The Intercollegiate Cricket Association existed (1881 through 1924).[66]\n\n\nIn 1895, Cornell, Columbia, and Penn founded the Intercollegiate Rowing Association, which remains the oldest collegiate athletic organizing body in the US.

Manning** (born April 11, 1961) is an American educator and lawyer. Manning is currently the Morgan and Helen Chu dean and professor of Harvard Law School.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nManning graduated from Harvard College in 1982 and lived in Thayer Hall during his freshman year. He then graduated from Harvard Law School in 1985.[2] Following law school, he served as a law clerk to Judge Robert Bork at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He then served as a law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia for the Supreme Court's 1988 term.[3] Manning also worked two stints at the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) and in the Solicitor General's office.[4]\n\n\nHe began teaching at Columbia Law School in 1994 and was the Michael I. Sovern Professor of Law.[5] Manning was brought to Harvard Law School by Dean Elena Kagan to help shore up Harvard Law School's expertise in public law; he is an expert in administrative law and a constitutional scholar of textualism.[6] Manning's hiring, along with that of Jack Goldsmith, and Adrian Vermeule, has \"helped assuage complaints that Harvard marginalized conservative views.\"[6] Manning is also an expert on separation of powers issues.[7][8]\nOn July 23, 2012, the Supreme Court appointed Manning *amicus curiae*, in *Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center*. He argued the case on December 4, 2012.[9]\n\n\nOn April 30, 2013, Manning was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[10]\n\n\nOn January 5, 2017, Martha Minow, then-dean at Harvard Law School, announced that she would be stepping down as dean at the end of the academic year.[11] On June 1, 2017, Manning was formally announced as the law school's next Dean, beginning on July 1, 2017.[12] Manning, a textualist legal scholar, whose selection drew criticism from some progressive and liberal groups,[13] has stated that his academic background \"will not affect how he leads the Law School.\"[14]\n\n\n\n## Published works[edit]\n\n\nManning is the coauthor of two leading textbooks:\n\n\n\n* *Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System* (6th ed. 2009) (with Richard H. Fallon, Jr., Daniel J. Meltzer, and David L. Shapiro).\n* *Legislation and Regulation* (2010) (with Matthew C. Stephenson).\n\n\nHe has also written more than thirty law review articles. Some of his most-cited pieces are:\n\n\n\n* *Constitutional Structure and Judicial Deference to Agency Interpretations of Agency Rules*, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 612 (1996)\n* *Textualism as a Nondelegation Doctrine*, 97 Colum. L. Rev. 673 (1997)\n* *The Nondelegation Doctrine as a Canon of Avoidance*, 2000 Sup. Ct.

Rev. 2009 (2006)*\n* Continuity and the Legislative Design, *79 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1863 (2004)*\n\n\nCases argued in front of the Supreme Court:[15]\n\n\n\n* Sebelius v.

He previously served as Yale's provost, dean of Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and dean of Yale College. Salovey is one of the early pioneers in emotional intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nSalovey was born in 1958 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[1] He is the oldest child of Elaine Salovey, who was a registered nurse, and Ronald Salovey, who was a physical chemist and Professor of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at the University of Southern California.[2][3]\n\n\nSalovey spent his early years in New Providence, New Jersey and attended high school at Williamsville North High School in a suburb of Buffalo, New York, before moving to suburban Los Angeles in 1975, when his father was appointed a professor at the University of Southern California.[4] In 1976, he graduated co-valedictorian from Rolling Hills High School in Rolling Hills Estates, California. He attended Stanford University, where he received a B.A. in psychology and an M.A. in sociology with departmental honors and university distinction.[5] While at Stanford, he served as a peer counselor with The Bridge Peer Counseling Center, a field about which he later co-authored a textbook.[6]\n\n\n\n## Academic biography[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Stanford, Salovey moved to New Haven, Connecticut, to pursue a Ph.D. in psychology at Yale under the guidance of Judith Rodin. After completing a dissertation entitled \"The Effects of Mood and Focus of Attention on Self-Relevant Thoughts and Helping Intention,\" and an internship at the West Haven Veterans Administration Medical Center, he graduated from Yale in 1986[7] and joined the Yale Department of Psychology as an assistant professor.[8] He was appointed full professor in 1995 and now has secondary faculty appointments in Yale's School of Management, School of Public Health, the Department of Sociology, and the Institution for Social and Policy Studies. He is currently the Chris Argyris Professor of Psychology.\n\n\nSalovey's most significant research contributions are in the field of emotional intelligence. With John D. Mayer he significantly expanded the scope of the concept and authored several of the field's seminal papers, arguing that people have wide ranging abilities pertaining to emotional control, reasoning, and perceptivity.[9] Against earlier theories of intelligence that conceived of emotion as rival to reasoning, Salovey and Mayer contended that emotion could motivate productive outcomes when properly directed.[10][11] Subsequently, he has worked to develop models and tests of emotional intelligence, such as the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. Salovey's second vein of research is in health psychology, where he has applied social psychology principles to investigate the efficacy of health messaging in promoting HIV risk reduction, early cancer detection, and smoking cessation. In all, Salovey has authored or edited thirteen books translated into eleven languages and published more than 350 journal articles and essays.\n\n\nOutside Yale, Salovey has served on the National Science Foundation's Social Psychology Advisory Panel, the National Institute of Mental Health Behavioral Science Working Group, and the NIMH National Advisory Mental Health Council. Salovey served as President of the Society for General Psychology and Treasurer of the International Society for Research on Emotion. He was the founding editor of the *Review of General Psychology* and an associate editor of *Emotion* and *Psychological Bulletin*.[1][5]\n\n\n\n## Administrative career[edit]\n\n\nHaving served in various administrative roles within the Department of Psychology for a decade, Salovey was appointed Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in January 2003. The following year he replaced Richard Brodhead as Dean of Yale College. In October 2008, he succeeded Andrew Hamilton as Provost of Yale University.[12] As Provost, Salovey oversaw major budget reductions caused by the 2008 recession, expansion of Yale's West Campus, the formation of Yale\u2013NUS College, reform of tenure policies for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and an overhaul of sexual misconduct grievance procedures.[13][14][15][16][17]\n\n\nSpeculation that Salovey was being considered for the Yale presidency began nearly four years before President Rick Levin's August 2012 retirement announcement.[18] After a nationwide search in which Salovey was widely considered to be the frontrunner, the Yale Corporation announced his selection as Yale's 23rd president in November 2012.[19][20][21] Salovey took office on July 1, 2013.[22]\n\n\nSalovey is the first Yale president since 1986 to live in the President's House, the formal residence of the university president.[23] After a renovation, Salovey moved into the residence in the fall of 2014.[24]\n\n\nOn August 31, 2023, in the 11th year of his tenure, Salovey announced that he plans to step down as President of Yale University and return to the Yale faculty on June 30, 2024.[25]\n\n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\nIn recognition of his research contributions, Salovey has received the National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award, the National Cancer Institute CIS Partner in Research Award, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Excellence Award. The Division of Health Psychology (Division 38) of the American Psychological Association recognized him with its Outstanding Contributions to Health Psychology by a Senior Professional Award. He has received two awards for excellence in teaching at Yale, the William Clyde DeVane Medal and the Lex Hixon '63 Prize for Teaching Excellence in the Social Sciences. Other honors include honorary degrees from the University of Pretoria, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Harvard University, McGill University, National Tsing Hua University, University of Haifa, and Vytautas Magnus University, as well as membership in the National Academy of Medicine and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[5][8][26]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSalovey's grandparents' families originally came from Poland, Jerusalem, and Austria.[27] The Saloveys are descendants of the Soloveitchik rabbinic family.[28] His paternal grandfather, Yitzchak Leib was born in Jerusalem in 1895 to a community worker and pharmacist named Zalman Yoseph Soloveitchik (b. 1874). Zalman Yoseph was the son of Simchah (c. 1830-1921), a Lithuanian born Jew who emigrated to Jerusalem where he was called \"The Londoner\", due to the time he spent living in London. Simchah was the son of Eliyahu Soloveitchik, an uncle to the famous scholar Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik, known as the Beis Halevi. This part of the family's origins trace to Kaunas (Kovno/Slobodka), Lithuania and then Volozhin, Belarus.\n\n\nAs a freshman at Stanford, Salovey began listening to bluegrass music and learned to play banjo.[4] In 1990, he founded the Professors of Bluegrass with Kelly Brownell, in which he plays bass. The band has a rotating membership of Yale faculty, students, and residents of New Haven and released its first album, \"Pick or Perish\", in June 2013.[29][30] He served as a trustee of the International Bluegrass Music Museum and on the advisory board of the Connecticut Folk Festival.[8] He now is a trustee of the IBMA Foundation for bluegrass music.\n\n\nSalovey is married to Marta Elisa Moret, a 1984 graduate of the Yale School of Public Health, former Deputy Commissioner for the Connecticut Department of Social Services, and the president of Urban Policy Strategies, LLC. She is an adjunct faculty member in the Department of Public Health at Southern Connecticut State University.[31] They met as students at Yale and married in 1986 in Orange, Connecticut.[1][32]\n\n\nSalovey's brother, Todd, is the associate artistic director of the San Diego Repertory Theatre and on the theater and dance faculty at the University of California, San Diego.[2][33] His sister, Devora Farrell, is President of ThisOrganized in Passaic, New Jersey.\n\n\n\n## Selected bibliography[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n* D'Andrea, V.
