Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to fill the seat vacated by Robert Bork.[103][104] Thomas gained the support of other African American officials, including former transportation secretary William Coleman, and said that when meeting white Democratic staffers in the United States Senate, he was \"struck by how easy it had become for sanctimonious whites to accuse a black man of not caring about civil rights\".[65]\n\n\nIn February 1990, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended Thomas by a vote of 12 to 1. On March 6, 1990, the Senate confirmed him to the Court of Appeals by a vote of 98 to 2.[102] He developed cordial relationships during his 19 months on the federal court, including with Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[65] During his judgeship, Thomas authored 19 opinions.[105]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Robin, Corey (2019). *The Enigma of Clarence Thomas*.

Smith have characterized Thomas's philosophy as grounded in a form of black nationalism that sees governmental attempts to address racism as either futile or counterproductive.[287][288][289][290] That view contrasts with the belief that laws should be race-neutral because racial discrimination is no longer a serious problem in the United States.[286]\n\n\nThomas joined the majority in *Students for Fair Admissions v.

They have three adult children: Chloe, an Episcopal priest; Nell; and Michael.[20]\n\n\n\n## Legal career[edit]\n\n\nAfter law school, Breyer served as a law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court justice Arthur Goldberg from 1964 to 1965. He served briefly as a fact-checker for the Warren Commission, then spent two years in the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division as a special assistant to its Assistant Attorney General.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBorn in San Francisco, Breyer attended Stanford University, the University of Oxford as a Marshall Scholar, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1964.[3] After a clerkship with Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg in 1964\u201365, Breyer was a law professor and lecturer at Harvard Law School from 1967 until 1980.[3] He specialized in administrative law, writing textbooks that remain in use today. He held other prominent positions before being nominated to the Supreme Court, including special assistant to the United States Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust and assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force in 1973. Breyer became a federal judge in 1980, when he was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In his 2005 book *Active Liberty*, Breyer made his first attempt to systematically communicate his views on legal theory, arguing that the judiciary should seek to resolve issues in a manner that encourages popular participation in governmental decisions.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn January 26, 2022, news outlets reported Breyer's intention to retire from the court at the end of the 2021\u201322 term.[66] Breyer confirmed his pending retirement in a White House announcement alongside Biden on January 27.[67] On February 25, Biden announced his nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson, a former clerk of Breyer and judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to succeed Breyer on the Supreme Court.[68] The U.S. Senate confirmed Jackson by a vote of 53\u201347 on April 7, 2022.[69] The last opinion Breyer wrote before his retirement was the majority opinion in *Central Virginia Community College v. Katz*.[70] He retired on June 30, 2022, at 12:00 noon EDT, following the court's final opinions and orders for the term.[71][72] Breyer's retirement left only one military veteran, Samuel Alito, on the Supreme Court.[73]\n\n\n\n## Judicial philosophy[edit]\n\n\n### In general[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Purposive approach\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Stephen Breyer in *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica*\n* Stephen Gerald Breyer at the *Biographical Directory of Federal Judges*, a publication of the Federal Judicial Center.\n* Stephen Breyer at Ballotpedia\n* Issue positions and quotes at OnTheIssues\n* Appearances on C-SPAN\n* Review of Stephen Breyer's Active Liberty: Interpreting our Democratic Constitution\n* \"Stephen Breyer, the court's necromancer\" Archived March 12, 2007, at the Wayback Machine, a book review of *Active Liberty: Interpreting Our Democratic Constitution* in the *New English Review*\n* \"'Active Liberty' from Justice Stephen Breyer\", October 20, 2005, NPR's *Fresh Air*\n* \"Supreme Court Justice Breyer on 'Active Liberty'\" Part 1 of Interview, September 29, 2005, NPR's *Morning Edition*\n* \"Justice Breyer: The Case Against 'Originalists'\" Part 2 of Interview, September 30, 2005, NPR's *Morning Edition*\n* Justice Breyer's appearance Archived October 3, 2013, at the Wayback Machine on NPR's quiz show *Wait Wait...

(*n\u00e9e* Roberts) and Irving Gerald Breyer.[10] Breyer's paternal great-grandfather emigrated from Romania to the United States, settling in Cleveland, Ohio, where Breyer's grandfather was born.[11] Breyer was raised in a middle-class Jewish family. His father was a lawyer who served as legal counsel to the San Francisco Board of Education.[12] Breyer and his younger brother Charles R. Breyer, who later became a federal district judge, were active in the Boy Scouts of America and achieved the Eagle Scout rank.[13][14] Breyer attended Lowell High School, where he was a member of the Lowell Forensic Society and debated regularly in high school tournaments, including against future California governor Jerry Brown and future Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2000, Breyer wrote the majority opinion in *Stenberg v. Carhart*, which struck down a Nebraska law banning partial-birth abortion.[35][36] On June 29, 2020, he wrote the plurality opinion in *June Medical Services v. Russo*.[37] The ruling struck down Louisiana's abortion law requiring any doctor who performed abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles. Breyer reaffirmed the \"benefits and burdens\" test he had created in *Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt*, which struck down a nearly identical abortion law in Texas. In 2022, he dissented in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, which overturned *Roe v. Wade*.\n\n\n\n### Census[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** Baker, Sam; Gonzalez, Oriana (April 7, 2022). \"Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmed as first Black female Supreme Court justice\". *Axios*.

He also defended the Court's use of foreign law and international law as persuasive (but not binding) authority in its decisions.[76][77][78] Breyer is also recognized as deferential to the interests of law enforcement and to legislative judgments in the Court's First Amendment rulings. He demonstrated a consistent pattern of deference to Congress, voting to overturn congressional legislation at a lower rate than any other Justice since 1994.[79]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> I think it's very, very, very important\u2014very important\u2014for us to show up at that State of the Union, because people today are more and more visual.

And I would like them to see the judges too, because federal judges are also a part of that government.[96]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Honors[edit]\n\n\nBreyer was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2004.[97] In 2007, Breyer was honored with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award by the Boy Scouts of America.[98] In 2018, he was named to chair of the Pritzker Architecture Prize jury, succeeding previous chair Glenn Murcutt.[99]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nBreyer has appeared as a guest on Stephen Colbert's TV show. On the *Late Show* in September 2021, he discussed the Texas Heartbeat Act and his reluctance to retire.[100][101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Breyer, Stephen G.; Stewart, Richard B.; Sunstein, Cass R.; Vermeule, Adrian (2006). *Administrative Law and Regulatory Policy: Problems, Text, and Cases* (6th\u00a0ed.).

New York* (2019), Breyer was in the 5\u20134 majority that ruled that the Census Bureau had not followed proper procedure in its implementation of a citizenship question. He was also one of four justices who would have held the citizenship question unconstitutional in itself. In a mostly concurring opinion, he wrote: \"Yet the decision was ill considered in a number of critically important respects. The Secretary did not give adequate consideration to issues that should have been central to his judgment, such as the high likelihood of an undercount, the low likelihood that a question would yield more accurate citizenship data, and the apparent lack of any need for more accurate citizenship data to begin with. The Secretary's failures in considering those critical issues make his decision unreasonable\".[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter Democratic victories in the 2020 presidential and Senate elections, progressive activists and Democratic members of Congress called on Breyer to retire so that President Biden could nominate a younger liberal justice.[62][63] In an August 2021 *New York Times* interview, Breyer said he wished to retire before his death, and recounted a conversation he had with Justice Antonin Scalia in which Scalia mentioned that he did not want his successor to \"reverse everything I've done for the last 25 years\". Breyer said that Scalia's point will \"inevitably be in the psychology\" of his decision to retire.[64] In a September 2021 interview with *Fox News'*s Chris Wallace, Breyer said activists calling for his retirement are \"entitled to their opinion\" and \"I didn't retire because I had decided on balance I wouldn't retire\". He said he took several factors into account when deciding his retirement plans, and reiterated that he did not plan to \"die on the court\".[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** \"Stephen G.

Justices Roberts, Scalia and Thomas were in favor of vacating the stay; Missouri had twice asked the justices to lift the stay and permit the execution.[61] Moreover, despite having been at one time nicknamed \"Scalito\", Alito's views have differed from those of Scalia (and Thomas), as in the Michael Taylor case and various other cases of the 2005 term.[*original research?*] A fierce critic of reliance on legislative history in statutory interpretation,[*citation needed*] Scalia was the only member of the Court in *Zedner v. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs an adjunct professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark from 1999 to 2004, Alito taught courses in constitutional law and an original course on terrorism and civil liberties. In 1995, he received the school's Saint Thomas More Medal \"in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of law\".[95] On May 25, 2007, he delivered the commencement address at Seton Hall Law's commencement ceremony and received an honorary law degree from the school.[96]\n\n\nAs a visiting professor at Duke University School of Law, Alito taught Current Issues in Constitutional Interpretation in fall 2011 and a course in the Master of Laws in Judicial Studies program in summer 2012.[97][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Samuel Alito, 2018\nIn 2003, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which led to a lawsuit in the case of *Gonzales v. Carhart*. The Court had previously ruled in *Stenberg v. Carhart* that a state's ban on partial birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case of a threat to the health of the mother. The membership of the Court changed after *Stenberg*, with Roberts and Alito replacing Rehnquist (a dissenter in *Roe*) and O'Connor (a supporter of *Roe*) respectively. Further, the ban at issue in *Gonzales v. Carhart* was a federal statute, rather than a state statute as in the *Stenberg* case.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlito has called himself a \"practical originalist\"[70] and is a member of the Court's conservative bloc.[71] He has been described as one of the Court's \"most conservative justices\".[59][58][72][73]\n\n\nAccording to *The New Yorker*, since the 2020 appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Alito has become \"the embodiment of a conservative majority that is ambitious and extreme\", overruling progressive precedents from the 1960s and '70s that were previously out of conservatives' reach.[63]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlito was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He was the son of Samuel A. Alito Sr., an Italian immigrant from Roccella Ionica, Calabria, and Rose Fradusco, an Italian-American whose parents came from Palazzo San Gervasio in Basilicata.[1][2][3] Alito's father earned a master's degree at Rutgers University and was a high school teacher and later the first director of the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, a state government position he held from 1952 to 1984. Alito's mother was a schoolteacher. Both are deceased.[4]\n\n\nAlito grew up in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, a suburb of Trenton.[5] He attended Steinert High School, where he graduated in 1968 as the class valedictorian,[6] subsequently matriculating at Princeton University. In 1972, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.[7] His senior thesis, supervised by political scientist Walter F. Murphy, was entitled \"An Introduction to the Italian Constitutional Court\".[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 by a vote of 68\u201331. While on the Court, Sotomayor has supported the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her Supreme Court tenure, Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants and criminal justice reform, and is known for her impassioned dissents on issues of race, ethnic, and gender identity, including in *Schuette v. BAMN*, *Utah v. Strieff*, and *Trump v. Hawaii*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor[5] was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx.[6] Her father was Juan Sotomayor (c. 1921\u20131964),[7] from the area of Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico,[8][9][10] and her mother was Celina B\u00e1ez (1927\u20132021),[11] an orphan[12] from Santa Rosa in Lajas, a rural area on Puerto Rico's southwest coast.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Bowers, Andy (May 26, 2009). \"How To Pronounce Sotomayor\". *Slate*.

The ruling further said that even without the lapse, the owner's petition would be denied due to application of the Supreme Court's recent *Kelo v. City of New London* ruling.

However, there is a wide divergence among Catholics in general in their approaches to the law.[3] Due to her upbringing and her past jobs and positions, Sotomayor has brought one of the more diverse sets of life experiences to the Court.[227]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLefcourt said, \"She used her questioning to make a point, as opposed to really looking for an answer to a question she did not understand.\"[133] In contrast, Second Circuit Judge Richard C. Wesley said that his interactions with Sotomayor had been \"totally antithetical to this perception that has gotten some traction that she is somehow confrontational.\"[133] Second Circuit Judge and former teacher Guido Calabresi said his tracking showed that Sotomayor's questioning patterns were no different from those of other members of the court and added, \"Some lawyers just don't like to be questioned by a woman. [The criticism] was sexist, plain and simple.\"[133]\nSotomayor's law clerks regarded her as a valuable and strong mentor, and she said that she viewed them like family.[51]\n\n\nIn 2005, Senate Democrats suggested Sotomayor, among others, to President George W.

During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own.[13] In 2005, Bush nominated Roberts to the Supreme Court, initially to be an associate justice to fill the vacancy left by the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Chief Justice William Rehnquist died shortly afterward, however, before Roberts's Senate confirmation hearings had begun. Bush then withdrew Roberts's nomination and instead nominated him to become Chief Justice, choosing Samuel Alito to replace O'Connor.\n\n\nRoberts has authored the majority opinion in many important cases, including decisions relating to elections, federal agencies, presidential power, the Affordable Care Act, and race-based college admissions.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to a disclosure Roberts submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee prior to his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Roberts's net worth was more than $6\u00a0million, including $1.6\u00a0million in stocks.[*citation needed*] In joining the D.C.

He served as a law clerk for Circuit Judge Henry Friendly and Justice William Rehnquist before taking a position in the attorney general's office during the Reagan Administration. He went on to serve the Reagan Administration and the George H. W. Bush Administration in the Department of Justice and the Office of the White House Counsel, during which he was nominated by George H. W. Bush to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but no vote on his nomination was held.[10] Roberts then spent 14 years in private law practice.

Classmate David B. Wilkins described him as \"more conservative than the typical Harvard Law student in the 1970s\", though he had been well-liked among fellow students.[20] Roberts became managing editor of the *Harvard Law Review* and graduated in 1979 with a J.D., *magna cum laude*.[17][19]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Ronald Reagan greeting Roberts in the Oval Office while Roberts was serving as an associate White House Counsel (1983)\nAfter graduating from law school, Roberts was a law clerk for Judge Henry Friendly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1979 to 1980, then for Justice (later Chief Justice in 1986) William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1980 to 1981.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRoberts wrote a dissent in *Rancho Viejo, LLC v. Norton*,[45] a case involving the protection of a rare California toad under the Endangered Species Act. When the court denied a rehearing en banc,(D.C.

Morrison* in that it incorrectly focused on whether the *regulation* substantially affects interstate commerce rather than on whether the regulated *activity* does. In Roberts's view, the Commerce Clause of the Constitution did not permit the government to regulate activity affecting what he called \"a hapless toad\" that \"for reasons of its own, lives its entire life in California.\" He said that reviewing the panel decision would allow the court \"alternative grounds for sustaining application of the Act that may be more consistent with Supreme Court precedent.\"[46]\n\n\n\n## Appointment to Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: John Roberts Supreme Court nomination\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n148. **^** *Maine Today* staff (July 30, 2007). \"Chief Justice John Roberts hospitalized in Maine\".

Dissenting justices were Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, while Roberts's opinion was joined by David Souter, Stephen Breyer, John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Bush nominated Roberts to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to replace judge James L. Buckley, who had recently retired.[35] However, the Democratic Party had a majority in the Senate at the time and was in conflict with Bush over his judicial nominees. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy refused to give Roberts a hearing in the 107th Congress.[36] The GOP regained control of the Senate on January 7, 2003, and Bush resubmitted Roberts's nomination that day. Roberts was confirmed on May 8, 2003,[37] and received his commission on June 2, 2003.[38] During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own.[13]\n\n\n\n### Fourth and Fifth amendments[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1965, ten-year-old Roberts and his family moved to Long Beach, Indiana, where his father became manager of a new steel plant in nearby Burns Harbor.[17] Roberts attended La Lumiere School, an academically rigorous Catholic boarding school in La Porte, Indiana,[17][18] where he captained the school's football team. Roberts additionally participated in track and field and was a regional champion in wrestling. He also participated in choir and drama, and was a co-editor for the school newspaper The Torch.[17] He graduated as class valedictorian in 1973.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Confirmation[edit]\n\n\nOn September 22, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Roberts's nomination by a vote of 13\u20135, with Senators Ted Kennedy, Richard Durbin, Charles Schumer, Joe Biden and Dianne Feinstein voting against. Roberts was confirmed by the full Senate on September 29 by a margin of 78\u201322.[58] All Republicans and the one Independent voted for Roberts; the Democrats split evenly, 22\u201322. Roberts was confirmed by what was, historically, a narrow margin for a Supreme Court justice.[59] However, all subsequent confirmation votes have been even more narrow.[60][61][62][63]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roberts Court\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1989, Roberts joined the Administration of president George H. W. Bush as Principal Deputy Solicitor General.[24] He served as the acting solicitor general for the case of *Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC* when the solicitor general, Ken Starr, had a conflict of interest. In the case, Roberts argued against policies of the FCC intended to increase minority ownership of broadcast licenses, arguing that the racial preferences were unconstitutional. Roberts's decision to argue that a federal agency's policy was unconstitutional surprised many lawyers within the Solicitor General's office.[25][26][27] In 1992, Bush nominated Roberts to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, but no Senate vote was held, and Roberts's nomination expired at the end of the 102nd Congress.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Roberts is sworn in as Chief Justice by Justice John Paul Stevens in the East Room of the White House as President Bush and Roberts's wife Jane look on, September 29, 2005.\nRoberts took the Constitutional oath of office, administered by Associate Justice John Paul Stevens at the White House, on September 29, 2005. On October 3, he took the judicial oath provided for by the Judiciary Act of 1789 at the United States Supreme Court building.\n\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia said that Roberts \"pretty much run[s] the show the same way\" as Rehnquist, albeit \"let[ting] people go on a little longer at conference ... but [he'll] get over that.\"[64] Roberts has been portrayed as a consistent advocate for conservative principles by analysts such as Jeffrey Toobin.[65] Garrett Epps has described Roberts's prose as \"crystalline, vivid, and often humorous\".[66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring his confirmation hearings, Roberts said that he did not have a comprehensive jurisprudential philosophy, and he did \"not think beginning with an all-encompassing approach to constitutional interpretation is the best way to faithfully construe the document.\"[48][49] Roberts compared judges to baseball umpires: \"[I]t's my job to call balls and strikes, and not to pitch or bat.\"[50] Among the issues he discussed during the hearings were:\n\n\n\n#### Commerce Clause[edit]\n\n\nIn Senate hearings, Roberts has stated:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough Roberts is identified as having a conservative judicial philosophy, Roberts is seen as having a more moderate conservative orientation, particularly when *Bush v. Gore* is compared to Roberts's vote for the ACA: his vote in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* to uphold the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) caused the press to contrast his Court with the Rehnquist Court.[77] Roberts's judicial philosophy is seen as more moderate and conciliatory than Antonin Scalia's and Clarence Thomas's.[78][79][77] He wishes more consensus from the Court.[78] At the beginning of his tenure, Roberts's voting pattern closely aligned with Samuel Alito's.[80] However, in recent years, his voting pattern has closely resembled Brett Kavanaugh's, who is generally seen as far more moderate than Alito.[81]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n129. **^** Chung, Andrew; Hurley, Lawrence (November 2, 2021). \"U.S. Supreme Court spurns Catholic hospital appeal over transgender patient\". *Reuters*.
