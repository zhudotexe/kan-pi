She also reached No. 15 with \"Shake It Off\" and No. 69 with \"It's Like That\" featuring Jermaine Dupri and Fatman Scoop.\nThe *Billboard* Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Its data, published by *Billboard* magazine and compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, is based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as airplay and streaming. At the end of a year, *Billboard* will publish an annual list of the 100 most successful songs throughout that year on the Hot 100 chart based on the information. For 2005, the list was published on December 20, calculated with data from December 4, 2004, to November 26, 2005.[1] The R&B track \"We Belong Together\" by American singer Mariah Carey was named the number 1 song of 2005 and it spent the longest time at number 1 for the year, 14 weeks. This is also the third-longest time at number 1 for a single in the 57-year history of the Hot 100 post-1958 inception, after Mariah Carey's own collaboration with Boyz II Men, \"One Sweet Day\", which spent 16 weeks atop the Hot 100 from 1995 to 1996, and \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, featuring Justin Bieber, which equaled that mark in 2017, both being beaten in 2019 by \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus, which had 19 weeks at No. 1.\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rapper 50 Cent had six songs on the chart, five of them in the top 40, the highest one being \"Candy Shop\" at number eight.\n![](image)Singer Ciara had four songs in the top 40 of the chart, the highest one being \"1, 2 Step\" at number five.\n![](image)The Black Eyed Peas had three

The song was released on March 15, 2005, through Island Records, as the second single from the album. \"We Belong Together\" was written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Manuel Seal, and Johnt\u00e1 Austin and produced by the former three. Since the song interpolates lyrics from Bobby Womack's \"If You Think You're Lonely Now\" (1981) and the Deele's \"Two Occasions\" (1987), the songwriters of those respective songs are credited. \"We Belong Together\" is built on a simple piano arrangement with an understated backbeat. The lyrics chronicle a woman's desperation for her former lover to return.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n124. **^** \"Mariah Carey \u2013 We Belong Together\". ARIA Top 50 Singles.

Carey's vocal range is demonstrated with a greater emphasis in the ending chorus, where the chorus is raised an octave higher, lying from G4 to A5.[11] As such, Carey ends with an anticipated coda, completing both the chorus and the song with a potent, belted note of C5 for approximately four semibreves (around 17 seconds).[11] It follows the common verse-chorus form and is structured into three sections that portray the protagonist in a range of emotions; from doleful and resigned in the first section, to desperate and agitated in the second.[12] In the last section the song climaxes with an octave raise, which not only emphasizes the protagonist's heightened desperation, but her determination to be with her lover.[12] The song is written in the key of C major with a slow tempo of 70 beats per minute. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> It\u2019s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads with her departed lover \u2013 'When you left I lost a part of me / It\u2019s still so hard to believe' \u2013 and the song\u2019s gentle R&B roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would \u2013 you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She\u2019s on a porch with tea; he\u2019s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There\u2019s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there\u2019s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect \u2013 and perfectly universal \u2013 pop/R&B songwriting. In other words, it\u2019s the jam. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"We Belong Together\" became a \"career re-defining\"[16] song for Carey, at a point when many critics had considered her career over.[17] Unlike most of Carey's recent singles at that time, \"We Belong Together\" received generally positive reviews from critics, most of whom hailed the song as her \"return to form\", following reviews for *Charmbracelet* (2002), that suggested Carey had lost her signature vocal range and power.[18] Sal Cinquemani of *Slant Magazine* wrote \"the... diva [keeps] cool with breathy, rapid-fire verses until the final full strong-voiced climax that... proves that 'The Voice' has indeed returned.\"[19] Additionally, he said that \"The song is as 'innovative' as Mariah has been in years.\"[19] Other critics commended Carey on her novel singing style which, according to Kelefa Sanneh of *The New York Times*, gave the song its propulsion, writing \"This style is part of the reason why she has been able to turn a ballad into a summer smash. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"We Belong Together\" is an R&B ballad.[6][7] *Rolling Stone* called it \"soulful.\"[8] The song is propelled by a programmed Roland TR-808-styled kick and hi-hat, which is prominently utilized in hip hop music.[9] Reviewer Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News commented that Carey's spare and understated singing approach gave the song more power, which would not have been achieved if she had belted.[4] The song also incorporates 1980s retro-soul music by \"cleverly\" referencing Bobby Womack's \"If You Think You're Lonely Now\" (1981) and the Deele's \"Two Occasions\" (1987), with Babyface.[7] In the second verse of \"We Belong Together\", Carey sings: \"Bobby Womack's on the radio / Singing to me, 'If you think you're lonely now'.\"[10] She then flips across a radio dial: \"So I turn the dial, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe song's music video premiered worldwide on April 11, 2005, although MSN offered an exclusive look at the music video on April 9. Carey's \"We Belong Together\" is Yahoo! Music's most watched video of 2005 with 7.5 million streamed performances. The video was shot by film director Brett Ratner in Los Angeles alongside the video for Carey's previous single, \"It's Like That\".[4] Carey had collaborated with Ratner several times in the past, having worked on the video for \"Heartbreaker\", which became one of the most expensive of all time, costing an estimated $2.5\u00a0million.[4] The video was filmed through February 9 to 10, 2005, in conjunction with \"It's Like That\" and serves as the second half to the two-part story. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

She also reached No. 15 with \"Shake It Off\" and No. 69 with \"It's Like That\" featuring Jermaine Dupri and Fatman Scoop.\nThe *Billboard* Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Its data, published by *Billboard* magazine and compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, is based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as airplay and streaming. At the end of a year, *Billboard* will publish an annual list of the 100 most successful songs throughout that year on the Hot 100 chart based on the information. For 2005, the list was published on December 20, calculated with data from December 4, 2004, to November 26, 2005.[1] The R&B track \"We Belong Together\" by American singer Mariah Carey was named the number 1 song of 2005 and it spent the longest time at number 1 for the year, 14 weeks. This is also the third-longest time at number 1 for a single in the 57-year history of the Hot 100 post-1958 inception, after Mariah Carey's own collaboration with Boyz II Men, \"One Sweet Day\",

Angel. Music. Baby.* (2004). It is a hip-hop song that draws influence from 1980s hip-hop and dance music. The song was written by Stefani, Pharrell Williams, and Chad Hugo, with the latter two handling production as the Neptunes. The song was released as the album's third single on March 22, 2005, and was one of the year's most popular songs, peaking inside the top 10 of the majority of the charts it entered. It reached number one in Australia and the United States, where it became the first digital download to sell one million copies.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Salmon, Chris (March 2, 2007). \"I just want to make music and babies\". *The Guardian*.

She's going to ruin everything'.\" She revealed that she too did not know why she was recording a solo album.[2] For the remainder of the evening, Stefani and Pharrell incorporated this inspiration into the lyrics that eventually became \"Hollaback Girl\". The two decided that Stefani did not have to have an answer for her intentions and that the choices she made were based on what she felt was wrong or right.[2] On its creation, Stefani said, \"To me, it is the freshest attitude song I've heard in so long.\" Pharrell was pleased with the song, commenting, \"Gwen is like the girl in high school who just had her own style.\"[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** *Hollaback Girl* (Liner notes/ CD booklet).

In a satirical, line-by-line analysis of the song's lyrics, *OC Weekly* critic Greg Stacy humorously speculated that \"Gwen is apparently the captain of the cheerleader squad; she is the girl who 'hollas' the chants, not one of the girls who simply 'hollas' them back\".[8] The most commonly accepted meaning is that a \"hollaback girl\" responds positively to the \"catcalls\" or hollers of men, but it might mean to Stefani that she would rather take the initiative and \"step it up\".[9] In March 2021, it was revealed that a comment made by British supermodel Naomi Campbell served as inspiration for the chorus.[10] In an appearance on Campbell's YouTube talk show *No Filter*, Pharrell stated that she had responded to someone trying to speak, \"I'm sorry, I have a name. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nI ain't no Holla Back girl\", the latter phrase apparently referencing the Fabolous song \"Young'n (Holla Back)\"; Pharrell was inspired by the overheard conversation and incorporated the lyric into the chorus of \"Hollaback Girl\".[11]\n\n\n\n## Composition and musical style[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\"Hollaback Girl\"\n\n\nStefani sings in a chant during the chorus for \"Hollaback Girl\"\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file?

Music's Jennifer Nine described it as a \"stomping, stripped-back\" track,[20] and Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted that it had the \"thumping, minimal beats\" of the Neptunes.[16] Richard Smirke of Playlouder called it \"a trademark Neptunes hip-hop stomp.\"[21] In his review of *Love. Angel. Music. Baby.*, Rob Sheffield of *Rolling Stone* gave the song a positive review, writing that \"Stefani's gum-snapping sass brings out the beast in her beatmasters, especially the Neptunes in 'Hollaback Girl'.\"[22] *Blender* listed it as the 11th best song of 2005,[23] and the song tied with Damian Marley's \"Welcome to Jamrock\" for number five on the 2005 Pazz & Jop, a survey of several hundred music critics conducted by Robert Christgau.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Huff, Quentin B.

Stefani and the Harajuku Girls then drive down Sherman Way past Magnolia Science Academy to Birmingham High School in a 1961 Chevrolet Impala, accompanied by the crowd.[57][58] Stefani and the group cause a commotion when they disrupt a football game by walking onto the field and when they go to a 99 Cents Only Store and throw cereal and other food products down an aisle. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhen Stefani agreed to be a judge on season 7 of the NBC music competition *The Voice*, she sang the track in May 2014 alongside Pharrell, who would also be appearing on the show as a judge.[73] For the rendition, Stefani wore a black jumpsuit in contrast to Pharrell, who wore a Mickey Mouse-sweater and jeans.[74][75] The performance prompted the song to enter the *Billboard* Pop Digital Songs component chart, where it re-entered at number thirty-four.[76] On the May 4, 2016, episode of *The Late Late Show with James Corden*, Stefani sang a snippet of the song alongside James Corden in his show's segment \"Carpool Karaoke\".[77] In addition to Stefani and Corden, actor George Clooney and actress Julia Roberts sang along; when the song concluded, Clooney stated \"this [bleep]'s bananas\".[78] More recently, the single was included on her 2016 concert series This Is What the Truth Feels Like Tour.[79] On November 27, 2019, Stefani performed \"Hollaback Girl\", alongside \"What You Waitin\u2019 For\" and \"Rich Girl\", \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPersonnel are adapted from the liner notes of *Love.

The track features reggae singer Elan Atias, whose debut album Kanal produced.[139] It appears as a single on iTunes, on the CD single for \"Cool\",[140] and on the bonus CD of the deluxe edition of *Love. Angel. Music.

However, a case of writer's block resulted in reportedly uninspired collaborations.[2] As the album neared completion, Stefani regained her confidence and booked another session with the Neptunes. Stefani flew to New York City to meet up with Pharrell, and after finishing two songs within a week, Stefani ended the session early and prepared to return home. A few minutes later, Pharrell called her back into the studio to write another song. Stefani said, \"I was tired. I wanted to go home, but he was like, 'Don't leave yet.'\"[3] When she returned to the studio, Pharrell began to play Stefani his first solo album, and she became envious.[2] Excited by his material, she decided to write another song with Pharrell, despite her opinion that the album already contained far too many tracks.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Stefani performing \"Hollaback Girl\" in 2007 at The Sweet Escape Tour.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\"Hollaback Girl\" entered the *Billboard* Hot 100 at number 82 on the issue dated April 2, 2005,[32] and within six weeks of its release, it had reached the top of the chart,[33] becoming Stefani's first and only US number one.[34] It ended the nine-week run of 50 Cent's \"Candy Shop\" featuring Olivia, and maintained the number-one position for four consecutive weeks.[35] \"Hollaback Girl\" ranked second on the 2005 Hot 100 year-end chart.[36] The song held the record for most US radio airplays in one week, with 9,582 plays, and maintained this record for over a year before Shakira and Wyclef Jean's \"Hips Don't Lie\" overtook the position.[37] \"Hollaback Girl\" peaked at number one on the *Billboard* Pop 100 chart for eight weeks and at number 15 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart.[38][39] The song was a crossover success and reached number four on the Rhythmic Top 40 and number eight on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[40][41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Damas, Jason (November 29, 2004). \"Gwen Stefani: Love.Angel.Music.Baby\". *PopMatters*.

She also reached No. 15 with \"Shake It Off\" and No. 69 with \"It's Like That\" featuring Jermaine Dupri and Fatman Scoop.\nThe *Billboard* Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Its data, published by *Billboard* magazine and compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, is based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as airplay and streaming. At the end of a year, *Billboard* will publish an annual list of the 100 most successful songs throughout that year on the Hot 100 chart based on the information. For 2005, the list was published on December 20, calculated with data from December 4, 2004, to November 26, 2005.[1] The R&B track \"We Belong Together\" by American singer Mariah Carey was named the number 1 song of 2005 and it spent the longest time at number 1 for the year, 14 weeks. This is also the third-longest time at number 1 for a single in the 57-year history of the Hot 100 post-1958 inception, after Mariah Carey's own collaboration with Boyz II Men, \"One Sweet Day\", which spent 16 weeks atop the Hot 100 from 1995 to 1996, and \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, featuring Justin Bieber, which equaled that mark in 2017, both being beaten in 2019 by \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus, which had 19 weeks at No. 1.\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rapper 50 Cent had six songs on the chart, five of them in the top 40, the highest one being \"Candy Shop\" at number eight.\n![](image)Singer Ciara had four songs in the top 40 of the chart, the highest one being \"1, 2 Step\" at number five.\n![](image)The Black Eyed Peas had three songs on the chart, two of which are in the top forty.\n\n\nList of songs on *Billboard*'s 2005 Year-End Hot 100 chart[2]\n| No.\n | Title\n | Artist(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | \"We Belong

She also reached No. 15 with \"Shake It Off\" and No. 69 with \"It's Like That\" featuring Jermaine Dupri and Fatman Scoop.\nThe *Billboard* Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Its data, published by *Billboard* magazine and compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, is based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as airplay and streaming. At the end of a year, *Billboard* will publish an annual list of the 100 most successful songs throughout that year on the Hot 100 chart based on the information. For 2005, the list was published on December 20, calculated with data from December 4, 2004, to November 26, 2005.[1] The R&B track \"We Belong Together\" by American singer Mariah Carey was named the number 1 song of 2005 and it spent the longest time at number 1 for the year, 14 weeks. This is also the third-longest time at number 1 for a single in the 57-year history of the Hot 100 post-1958 inception, after Mariah Carey's own collaboration with Boyz II Men, \"One Sweet Day\", which spent 16 weeks atop the Hot 100 from 1995 to 1996, and \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, featuring Justin Bieber, which equaled that mark in 2017, both being beaten in 2019 by \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus, which had 19 weeks at No. 1.\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rapper 50 Cent had six songs on the chart, five of them in the top 40, the highest one

The song, which was written and produced by Max Martin and Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald, was released as the lead single from *Breakaway* two weeks before the album was released. It is an uptempo pop rock and power pop power ballad that infuses electronic sounds with a mixture of a soft and loud pop rock sound. Martin originally wrote \"Since U Been Gone\" with Pink in mind, but she turned it down. It was then given to Hilary Duff, but she rejected the song because she could not reach its higher notes. The song was finally given to Clarkson after Clive Davis convinced the writers to give it to her. Clarkson decided to add heavier guitars and harder drums to the song after noticing that the demo had an obvious pop sound. Lyrically, the song is written from a woman's point of view where she expresses her sense of relief with the end of her troubled relationship.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \"Since U Been Gone\" |\n| --- |\n| ![A front face image of Kelly Clarkson.

My record label was freaking out about it and I was, like, why?\"[11] Clarkson also explained that when she first heard \"Since U Been Gone\", she felt that it sounded a little bit pop for her direction, and she decided to tweak the song musically by incorporating drums and guitars.[1] Clarkson told MTV that the song is about a relationship turned sour although it was going well at the very beginning.[6] The song was officially released to mainstream radio stations in the United States on November 16, 2004, as the lead single of *Breakaway*.[12]\n\n\n\n## Composition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\"Since U Been Gone\" (2004)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n123. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Bronson, Fred (May 12, 2015). \"Top 100 'American Idol' Hits of All Time\". *Billboard*.

It's written in a way that is so transparent in terms of drawing from a lot of what's vaguely edgy and popular right now, but put together in such a perfect little package. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nClub* staff rated the song as one of their favorite gleeful breakup songs, writing \"The minute that bass and drum machine start, this song is an anthem of the scorned, a call to self-actualization, and an instant hands-in-the-air dance party.\"[118] *Rolling Stone* ranked \"Since U Been Gone\" at number 482 of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2010, and later at 93 in the 2021 revamped ranking, whose readers listed it as the ninth-ranked single of the last decade.[119][120][121] The AOL Radio Staff put the song at number 10 on their list of 10 Best Break Up Songs.[122] \"Since U Been Gone\" has also appeared in several *Billboard* lists; in March 2013, it was ranked at number one on its list of Top 100 American Idol Hits of All Time.[123] In April 2017, it appeared at number two of *Billboard'*s 100 greatest choruses of the 21st century[124] and is also one of Clarkson's biggest *Billboard* Hot 100 hits.[125]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Clarkson performing \"Since U Been Gone\" during her My December Tour\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to MTV, Clarkson had already finished recording her materials for her second album, *Breakaway* in late 2004 when she was advised by her A&R to fly to Sweden to meet with Martin and Dr. Luke.[6] Both Martin and Dr. Luke were associated with pop music, but they wanted to produce rock songs. Realizing that her record had more of a rock influence, Clarkson finally agreed to collaborate with them.\"[6]\n\n\n\"Since U Been Gone\" was inspired by the 2003 song \"Maps\" by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.[7] In an interview with *Billboard*, Dr. Luke said:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"Since U Been Gone\" has also been covered by contestants from reality television singing competitions. The song was performed by Todrick Hall on the eighth season of *American Idol*. Despite fulfilling the judges' desire to hear something original, his rendition of the song drew criticism from the judges, with Simon Cowell commenting that Hall seemed like a dancer trying to sing.[98] On November 26, 2011, Amelia Lily performed the song on the eighth series of *The X Factor UK*. Her rendition was praised by the judges; Louis Walsh felt that her performance was effortless while Kelly Rowland remarked that \"Amelia Lily hits those notes in her sleep!\"[*citation needed*] The song was also covered by Luke O'Dell on the third season of *The X Factor Australia*.[99] On June 13, 2012, John Legend and his duet partner, Meleana Brown, covered \"Since U Been Gone\" in *Duets*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n168. **^** \"2005 \u2013 The Year in Music: Hot 100 Songs\". *Billboard*.

She also reached No. 15 with \"Shake It Off\" and No. 69 with \"It's Like That\" featuring Jermaine Dupri and Fatman Scoop.\nThe *Billboard* Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Its data, published by *Billboard* magazine and compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, is based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as airplay and streaming. At the end of a year, *Billboard* will publish an annual list of the 100 most successful songs throughout that year on the Hot 100 chart based on the information. For 2005, the list was published on December 20, calculated with data from December 4, 2004, to November 26, 2005.[1] The R&B track \"We Belong Together\" by American singer Mariah Carey was named the number 1 song of 2005 and it spent the longest time at number 1 for the year, 14 weeks. This is also the third-longest time at number 1 for a single in the 57-year history of the Hot 100 post-1958 inception, after Mariah Carey's own collaboration with Boyz II Men, \"One Sweet Day\", which spent 16 weeks atop the Hot 100 from 1995 to 1996, and \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, featuring Justin Bieber, which equaled that mark in 2017, both being beaten in 2019 by \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus, which had 19 weeks at No. 1.\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rapper 50 Cent had six songs on the chart, five of them in the top 40, the highest one being \"Candy Shop\" at number eight.\n![](image)Singer Ciara had four songs in the top 40 of the chart, the highest one being \"1, 2 Step\" at number five.\n![](image)The Black Eyed Peas had three

We see Ciara and her dancers, dancing in the Atlanta dance studio, and certain shots of her teaching her female friend the \"1, 2 Step\". We then see a clip of Ciara meeting up with B5 and performing the \"1, 2 Step\". Later, Ciara is seen dancing alone on the streets. While dancing at the studio, she looks behind her, and sees Elliott in the mirror, says she is just looking things. Then Elliott begins to rap her verse and they continue dancing with each other in front of the mirror, until the songs ends. During this time, we also see shots of Ciara teaching a group of young girls the dance and also, she meets a boy who is standing in front of his house and kind of gives him a flirtatious look. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Australian CD single**[30]\n1. \"1, 2 Step\" (album version) \u2013 3:22\n2. \"1, 2 Step\" (Johnny Budz Mixshow edit) \u2013 4:40\n3. \"1, 2 Step\" (Ford's E-Hop club mix) \u2013 5:28\n4. \"Goodies\" (Bimbo Jones full vocal) \u2013 7:18\n\n\n |\n\n## Credits and personnel[edit]\n\n\nCredits are taken from the UK CD1 liner notes.[26]\n\n\n**Studios**\n\n\n\n* Recorded at Doppler Studios (Atlanta, Georgia) and Hit Factory Criteria (Miami)\n* Mixed at Patchwerk Studios (Atlanta, Georgia)\n\n\n**Personnel**\n\n\n\n* Ciara \u2013 writing (as Ciara Harris), vocals\n* Jazze Pha \u2013 writing (as Phalon Alexander), production\n* Missy Elliott \u2013 writing, featured vocals\n* Pierre Medore \u2013 vocal production\n* Sam Thomas \u2013 recording\n* Carlos Bedoya \u2013 recording\n* Leslie Brathwaite \u2013 mixing\n* Kori Anders \u2013 mixing assistant\n\n## Charts[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. ^ ***a*** ***b*** *1, 2 Step* (UK CD1 liner notes).

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, \"1, 2 Step\" entered and peaked at number three on both the UK and Irish Singles Charts.[20][21] In Ireland, the single stayed at three for three weeks. The song reached number two in Australia for one week and in New Zealand for two weeks.[22][23] It was a top-30 hit in Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), France, the Netherlands, and Sweden.[24]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\nThe music video for \"1, 2 Step\" was directed by Benny Boom. It takes place in an Atlanta dance studio and on the streets. R&B boy band, B5, makes a short appearance in the video, along with Lloyd and Lil Scrappy. Ciara can be seen teaching others the song's title \"one, two step\" dance, which is similar to the traditional grapevine.\n\n\n\n### Synopsis[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWe also see four skaters, three male, and one female skater, skating in the streets and a last shot of Ciara and her dancers.\n\n\n\n## Track listings[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **US 12-inch single**[25]\n\nA1. \"1, 2 Step\" (main) \u2013 3:22\nA2. \"1, 2 Step\" (instrumental) \u2013 3:22\nB1. \"1, 2 Step\" (main) \u2013 3:22\nB2. \"1, 2 Step\" (acappella) \u2013 3:14\n**UK CD1**[26]\n1. \"1, 2 Step\" (album version) \u2013 3:22\n2. \"1, 2 Step\" (instrumental) \u2013 3:22\n\n**UK CD2**[27]\n1. \"1, 2 Step\" (album version) \u2013 3:22\n2. \"1, 2 Step\" (Delinquent \"Growing Pains\" remix) \u2013 4:55\n3. \"1, 2 Step\" (Phatbelly club remix) \u2013 3:30\n4. \"1, 2 Step\" (Eazy remix) \u2013 5:16\n5. \"1, 2 Step\" (video)\n | **UK 12-inch single**[28]\n\nA1. \"1, 2 Step\" (album version) \u2013 3:22\nA2. \"1, 2 Step\" (Phatbelly club remix) \u2013 3:30\nB1. \"1, 2 Step\" (Delinquent \"Growing Pains\" remix) \u2013 4:55\nB2. \"1, 2 Step\" (Eazy remix) \u2013 5:16\n**European CD single**[29]\n1. \"1, 2 Step\" (album version) \u2013 3:22\n2. \"1, 2 Step\" (Johnny Budz Mixshow edit) \u2013 4:40\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\"1, 2 Step\" is a Crunk&B track, which is strongly influenced by 1980s electro music. The song was created on one of Jazze Pha's five Akai MPC3000s. Pha used laser pulses from E-mu Proteus in the 2000s that were used for old school hip hop songs and b-boy break dance tracks. \"1, 2 Step\" is inspired by Afrika Bambaataa's \"Planet Rock.\" Jazze Pha thought about how he could create a more melodic version and \"shared some interesting ideas on what kind of music he would like to produce with her. Let's put it this way, it would be epic.\"[3] \"1, 2 Step\" references her past song \"Goodies\" and \"We Will Rock You\" by Queen. Missy Elliott's verse was inspired by Teena Marie's song \"Square Biz\".[4]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\"1, 2 Step\" received favorable reviews from music critics. *Contact Music* gave the song three out of five stars and called it \"arse shaking floor filling R&B\" and a \"wicked melodic souful twist.\"[5] Jason Birchmeier of *Allmusic* was published that the track is \"good, if not great.\"[6] Gerardo E. wrote it is \"a feel good track,\" something that is not overproduced but works its magic.\"[7] Kate Watkins of *The Situation* called it \"a funky song in the style we have come to expect from Missy.\"[8] *Fazed* stated that the song is about \"joys of dancing around with family.\"[9] *Slant* thought that \"1, 2 Step\" was a \"fun dance track.\"[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCiara\n |\n| --- |\n| * Discography\n* Videography\n* Awards and nominations\n |\n| *Goodies* | * \"Goodies\"\n* \"1, 2 Step\"\n* \"Oh\"\n* \"And I\"\n |\n| *Ciara: The Evolution* | * \"That's Right\"\n* \"Like a Boy\"\n* \"Promise\"\n* \"Can't Leave 'em Alone\"\n* \"Get Up\"\n |\n| *Fantasy Ride* | * \"Love Sex Magic\"\n* \"High Price\"\n* \"Like a Surgeon\"\n* \"Never Ever\"\n* \"Work\"\n* \"Go Girl\"\n |\n| *Basic Instinct* | * \"Ride\"\n* \"Gimmie Dat\"\n* \"Speechless\"\n |\n| *Ciara* | * \"I'm Out\"\n* \"Body Party\"\n* \"Read My Lips\"\n* \"Livin' It Up\"\n* \"Overdose\"\n |\n| *Jackie* | * \"Dance like We're Making Love\"\n* \"I Bet\"\n |\n| *Beauty Marks* | * \"Level Up\"\n* \"Thinkin Bout You\"\n* \"Dose\"\n* \"Greatest Love\"\n |\n| *CiCi* | * \"How We Roll\"\n |\n| Other singles | * \"Sorry\"\n* \"Got Me Good\"\n* \"Get Up\"\n* \"Jump\"\n* \"Better Thangs\"\n* \"Da Girls\"\n |\n| Featured singles | * \"Lose Control\"\n* \"Like You\"\n* \"So What\"\n* \"Promise Ring\"\n* \"Stepped on My J'z\"\n* \"Just Stand Up!\"\n* \"Takin' Back My Love\"\n |\n| Other songs | * \"Sweat\"\n* \"Paint It Black\"\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\"1, 2 Step\" was nominated for the 2006 Grammy Award for \"Best Rap/Sung Collaboration,\" but lost to \"Numb/Encore\" by Jay-Z and Linkin Park.
