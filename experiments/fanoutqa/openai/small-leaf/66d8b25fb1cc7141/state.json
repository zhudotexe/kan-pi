During this period, the tournament was divided into the East and West Regions. From 1952 to 1955, the Regional Championships were held at four sites, with two designated for the East and two for the West. In 1956, the four regions were given unique names for the first time. \n\n\nFrom 1946 to 1981, a consolation game was conducted before the Championship for the losing teams of the National Semifinals; the winning team was awarded third place and the losing team was awarded fourth place. In 1982, the NCAA eliminated the game and the two losing teams of the semifinal games are considered tied for third place in the official record book.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **2021** | **Baylor** | **Big 12** | **South** | 1\n | **Scott Drew** | **Champion** | **Jared Butler** |\n| Gonzaga | West Coast\n | West\n | 1\n | Mark Few\n | Runner-up\n |  |\n| Houston | American\n | Midwest\n | 2\n | Kelvin Sampson\n |  |  |\n| UCLA | Pac-12[a] | East\n | 11\n | Mick Cronin\n |  |  |\n| **2022** | **Kansas** | **Big 12** | **Midwest** | 1\n | **Bill Self** | **Champion** | **Ochai Agbaji** |\n| North Carolina | Atlantic Coast\n | East\n | 8\n | Hubert Davis\n | Runner-up\n |  |\n| Duke | Atlantic Coast\n | West\n | 2\n | Mike Krzyzewski\n |  |  |\n| Villanova | Big East\n | South\n | 2\n | Jay Wright\n |  |  |\n| **2023** | **UConn** | **Big East** | **West** | 4\n | **Dan Hurley** | **Champion** | **Adama Sanogo** |\n| San Diego State | Mountain West\n | South\n | 5\n | Brian Dutcher\n | Runner-up\n |  |\n| Miami | Atlantic Coast\n | Midwest\n | 5\n | Jim Larra\u00f1aga\n |  |  |\n| Florida Atlantic | Conference USA\n | East\n | 9\n | Dusty May\n |  |  |\n\n\n## Final Four appearances by school[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Final Four\n | State\n | Teams\n | Game Played\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1954 | Pennsylvania\n | La Salle\u2020 | Penn State\u00a7 | National Semifinal\n |\n| 1960 | Ohio\n | Cincinnati\u00a7 | Ohio State\u2020 |  |\n| 1961 | Ohio\n | Cincinnati\u2020 | Ohio State\u2021 | National Championship\n |\n| 1962 | Ohio\n | Cincinnati\u2020 | Ohio State\u2021 | National Championship\n |\n| 1975 | Kentucky\n | Kentucky\u2020 | Louisville\u00a7 |  |\n| 1977 | North Carolina\n | Charlotte | North Carolina\u2021 |  |\n| 1991 | North Carolina\n | Duke\u2020 | North Carolina |  |\n| 2012 | Kentucky\n | Kentucky\u2020 | Louisville (vac.)\n | National Semifinal\n |\n| 2021 | Texas\n | Baylor\u2020 | Houston | National Semifinal\n |\n| 2022 | North Carolina\n | Duke | North Carolina\u2021 | National Semifinal\n |\n| 2023 | Florida\n | Florida Atlantic | Miami |  |\n\n\n\u2020 National Champion; \u2021 Runner-Up; \u00a7 Third Place\n\n\n\n## Vacated appearances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  | Final Fours\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Atlantic Coast\n | 1981\u2020\u00a7, 1990\u00a7, 1991\u2021, 2001\u2020\u00a7, 2004, 2016\u2021\u00a7, 2022\u00a7 |\n| Big 12\n | 2003\u2021 |\n| Big East\n | 1985\u2020\u2021\u00a7 (3 teams), 1987\u00a7, 2009, 2013\u2020 (vac.)\n |\n| Big Eight\n | 1988\u2020\u2021 |\n| Big Ten\n | 1976\u2020\u2021, 1980, 1989\u00a7, 1992, 1999 (vac.), 2000\u00a7, 2005, 2015\n |\n| Southeastern\n | 1994\u2020, 1996\u2020, 2006\u2020, 2014\n |\n\n\n\u2020National Champion; \u2021Runner Up; \u00a7Teams played in National Semifinals\n\n\n\u2020\u2021Teams played in National Championship game\n\n\n\n## Final Four appearances by state[edit]\n\n\nSchools from 38 states, including the District of Columbia, have appeared in the Final Four.

In two of these Final Fours, one of the conference team's appearance was later vacated later by the NCAA. The Big Ten has achieved this nine times, with one appearance later vacated, tying them with the Atlantic Coast Conference for non-vacated multi-team Final Four appearances. The Big East is the only conference to have three teams in the Final Four, which was in 1985. \n\n\nTeams from the same conference have played against each other in nine National Semifinal games. Only three times have teams from the same conference played each other in the National Championship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Head Coach\n | Schools\n | Final Fours\n | Third Place\n | Runner Up\n | Champion\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Three Schools\n |\n| **Rick Pitino** | Providence\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Kentucky\n | 3\n |  | 1\n | 1\n |\n| Louisville\n | 1 (2 vac.)\n |  | 0\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n |\n| **John Calipari** | UMass\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Memphis\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n |  | 0 (1 vac.)\n | 0\n |\n| Kentucky\n | 4\n |  | 1\n | 1\n |\n| Two Schools\n |\n| Forddy Anderson | Bradley\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| Michigan State\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| Gene Bartow | Memphis*[j]* | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| UCLA\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Larry Brown | UCLA\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n | 0\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n | 0\n |\n| Kansas\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Hugh Durham | Florida State\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| Georgia\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Jack Gardner | Kansas State\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| Utah\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Lou Henson | New Mexico State\n | 1\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Illinois\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| **Bob Huggins** | Cincinnati\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| West Virginia\n | 1\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| School\n | Number\n | Final Fours\n | Coach(es)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| UCLA | 10\n | **1967**, **1968**, **1969**, **1970**, **1971**, **1972**, **1973**, 1974, **1975**, 1976\n | John Wooden (1967\u201375) & Gene Bartow (1976)\n |\n| Cincinnati | 5\n | 1959, 1960, **1961**, **1962**, 1963 | George Smith (1959\u201360) & Ed Jucker (1961\u201363)\n |\n| Duke | 5\n | 1988, 1989, 1990, **1991**, **1992** | Mike Krzyzewski |\n| Houston | 3\n | 1982, 1983, 1984 | Guy Lewis |\n| Kentucky | 3\n | **1996,** 1997, **1998** | Rick Pitino (1996\u201397) & Tubby Smith (1998)\n |\n| Michigan State | 3\n | 1999, **2000**, 2001\n | Tom Izzo |\n| North Carolina | 3\n | 1967, 1968, 1969\n | Dean Smith |\n| Ohio State | 3\n | 1944, 1945, *1946* | Harold Olsen |\n| Ohio State | 3\n | **1960**, 1961, 1962 | Fred Taylor |\n| San Francisco | 3\n | **1955**, **1956**, 1957\n | Phil Woolpert |\n| UCLA | 3\n | 2006, 2007, 2008\n | Ben Howland |\n\n\n## Final Four appearances by coach[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Syracuse qualified for the tournament via the ECAC Upstate tournament.\n12. **^** Rutgers qualified for the tournament via the ECAC Metro tournament.\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Charlotte was branded as UNC Charlotte during its 1977 appearance.\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** In the 1978 tournament teams were seeded in two pools of automatic qualifiers (Q) and at-large teams (L).

During this period, the tournament was divided into the East and West Regions. From 1952 to 1955, the Regional Championships were held at four sites, with two designated for the East and two for the West. In 1956, the four regions were given unique names for the first time. \n\n\nFrom 1946 to 1981, a consolation game was conducted before the Championship for the losing teams of the National Semifinals; the winning team was awarded third place and the losing team was awarded fourth place. In 1982, the NCAA eliminated the game and the two losing teams of the semifinal games are considered tied for third place in the official record book.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **2021** | **Baylor** | **Big 12** | **South** | 1\n | **Scott Drew** | **Champion** | **Jared Butler** |\n| Gonzaga | West Coast\n | West\n | 1\n | Mark Few\n | Runner-up\n |  |\n| Houston | American\n | Midwest\n | 2\n | Kelvin Sampson\n |  |  |\n| UCLA | Pac-12[a] | East\n | 11\n | Mick Cronin\n |  |  |\n| **2022** | **Kansas** | **Big 12** | **Midwest** | 1\n | **Bill Self** | **Champion** | **Ochai Agbaji** |\n| North Carolina | Atlantic Coast\n | East\n | 8\n | Hubert Davis\n | Runner-up\n |  |\n| Duke | Atlantic Coast\n | West\n | 2\n | Mike Krzyzewski\n |  |  |\n| Villanova | Big East\n | South\n | 2\n | Jay Wright\n |  |  |\n| **2023** | **UConn** | **Big East** | **West** | 4\n | **Dan Hurley** | **Champion** | **Adama Sanogo** |\n| San Diego State | Mountain West\n | South\n | 5\n | Brian Dutcher\n | Runner-up\n |  |\n| Miami | Atlantic Coast\n | Midwest\n | 5\n | Jim Larra\u00f1aga\n |  |  |\n| Florida Atlantic | Conference USA\n | East\n | 9\n | Dusty May\n |  |  |\n\n\n## Final Four appearances by school[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Final Four\n | State\n | Teams\n | Game Played\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1954 | Pennsylvania\n | La Salle\u2020 | Penn State\u00a7 | National Semifinal\n |\n| 1960 | Ohio\n | Cincinnati\u00a7 | Ohio State\u2020 |  |\n| 1961 | Ohio\n | Cincinnati\u2020 | Ohio State\u2021 | National Championship\n |\n| 1962 | Ohio\n | Cincinnati\u2020 | Ohio State\u2021 | National Championship\n |\n| 1975 | Kentucky\n | Kentucky\u2020 | Louisville\u00a7 |  |\n| 1977 | North Carolina\n | Charlotte | North Carolina\u2021 |  |\n| 1991 | North Carolina\n | Duke\u2020 | North Carolina |  |\n| 2012 | Kentucky\n | Kentucky\u2020 | Louisville (vac.)\n | National Semifinal\n |\n| 2021 | Texas\n | Baylor\u2020 | Houston | National Semifinal\n |\n| 2022 | North Carolina\n | Duke | North Carolina\u2021 | National Semifinal\n |\n| 2023 | Florida\n | Florida Atlantic | Miami |  |\n\n\n\u2020 National Champion; \u2021 Runner-Up; \u00a7 Third Place\n\n\n\n## Vacated appearances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNCAA Division I men's basketball tournament\n |\n| --- |\n| Tournaments | * 1939\n* 1940\n* 1941\n* 1942\n* 1943\n* 1944\n* 1945\n* 1946\n* 1947\n* 1948\n* 1949\n* 1950\n* 1951\n* 1952\n* 1953\n* 1954\n* 1955\n* 1956\n* 1957\n* 1958\n* 1959\n* 1960\n* 1961\n* 1962\n* 1963\n* 1964\n* 1965\n* 1966\n* 1967\n* 1968\n* 1969\n* 1970\n* 1971\n* 1972\n* 1973\n* 1974\n* 1975\n* 1976\n* 1977\n* 1978\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n* *2025*\n |\n| Structure | * Selection process\n* Venues\n* No. 1 seeds\n* First Four\n* Elite Eight\n* Final four\n |\n| Champions & awards | * List of champions\n* Most Outstanding Player\n |\n| Media & culture | * Blue bloods\n* Bracketology\n* Broadcasting\n\t+ Tournament\n\t+ Final Four\n* Cutting down the nets\n* March Madness pools\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  | Final Fours\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Atlantic Coast\n | 1981\u2020\u00a7, 1990\u00a7, 1991\u2021, 2001\u2020\u00a7, 2004, 2016\u2021\u00a7, 2022\u00a7 |\n| Big 12\n | 2003\u2021 |\n| Big East\n | 1985\u2020\u2021\u00a7 (3 teams), 1987\u00a7, 2009, 2013\u2020 (vac.)\n |\n| Big Eight\n | 1988\u2020\u2021 |\n| Big Ten\n | 1976\u2020\u2021, 1980, 1989\u00a7, 1992, 1999 (vac.), 2000\u00a7, 2005, 2015\n |\n| Southeastern\n | 1994\u2020, 1996\u2020, 2006\u2020, 2014\n |\n\n\n\u2020National Champion; \u2021Runner Up; \u00a7Teams played in National Semifinals\n\n\n\u2020\u2021Teams played in National Championship game\n\n\n\n## Final Four appearances by state[edit]\n\n\nSchools from 38 states, including the District of Columbia, have appeared in the Final Four.

In two of these Final Fours, one of the conference team's appearance was later vacated later by the NCAA. The Big Ten has achieved this nine times, with one appearance later vacated, tying them with the Atlantic Coast Conference for non-vacated multi-team Final Four appearances. The Big East is the only conference to have three teams in the Final Four, which was in 1985. \n\n\nTeams from the same conference have played against each other in nine National Semifinal games.

During this period, the tournament was divided into the East and West Regions. From 1952 to 1955, the Regional Championships were held at four sites, with two designated for the East and two for the West. In 1956, the four regions were given unique names for the first time. \n\n\nFrom 1946 to 1981, a consolation game was conducted before the Championship for the losing teams of the National Semifinals; the winning team was awarded third place and the losing team was awarded fourth place. In 1982, the NCAA eliminated the game and the two losing teams of the semifinal games are considered tied for third place in the official record book.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **2021** | **Baylor** | **Big 12** | **South** | 1\n | **Scott Drew** | **Champion** | **Jared Butler** |\n| Gonzaga | West Coast\n | West\n | 1\n | Mark Few\n | Runner-up\n |  |\n| Houston | American\n | Midwest\n | 2\n | Kelvin Sampson\n |  |  |\n| UCLA | Pac-12[a] | East\n | 11\n | Mick Cronin\n |  |  |\n| **2022** | **Kansas** | **Big 12** | **Midwest** | 1\n | **Bill Self** | **Champion** | **Ochai Agbaji** |\n| North Carolina | Atlantic Coast\n | East\n | 8\n | Hubert Davis\n | Runner-up\n |  |\n| Duke | Atlantic Coast\n | West\n | 2\n | Mike Krzyzewski\n |  |  |\n| Villanova | Big East\n | South\n | 2\n | Jay Wright\n |  |  |\n| **2023** | **UConn** | **Big East** | **West** | 4\n | **Dan Hurley** | **Champion** | **Adama Sanogo** |\n| San Diego State | Mountain West\n | South\n | 5\n | Brian Dutcher\n | Runner-up\n |  |\n| Miami | Atlantic Coast\n | Midwest\n | 5\n | Jim Larra\u00f1aga\n |  |  |\n| Florida Atlantic | Conference USA\n | East\n | 9\n | Dusty May\n |  |  |\n\n\n## Final Four appearances by school[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**General**\n\n\n*Men's Final Four 2023 Records Book*(PDF).

In two of these Final Fours, one of the conference team's appearance was later vacated later by the NCAA. The Big Ten has achieved this nine times, with one appearance later vacated, tying them with the Atlantic Coast Conference for non-vacated multi-team Final Four appearances. The Big East is the only conference to have three teams in the Final Four, which was in 1985. \n\n\nTeams from the same conference have played against each other in nine National Semifinal games. Only three times have teams from the same conference played each other in the National Championship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Head Coach\n | Schools\n | Final Fours\n | Third Place\n | Runner Up\n | Champion\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Three Schools\n |\n| **Rick Pitino** | Providence\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Kentucky\n | 3\n |  | 1\n | 1\n |\n| Louisville\n | 1 (2 vac.)\n |  | 0\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n |\n| **John Calipari** | UMass\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Memphis\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n |  | 0 (1 vac.)\n | 0\n |\n| Kentucky\n | 4\n |  | 1\n | 1\n |\n| Two Schools\n |\n| Forddy Anderson | Bradley\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| Michigan State\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| Gene Bartow | Memphis*[j]* | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| UCLA\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Larry Brown | UCLA\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n | 0\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n | 0\n |\n| Kansas\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Hugh Durham | Florida State\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| Georgia\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Jack Gardner | Kansas State\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| Utah\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Lou Henson | New Mexico State\n | 1\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Illinois\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| **Bob Huggins** | Cincinnati\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| West Virginia\n | 1\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince 1939, 158 head coaches have appeared in the Final Four.
