It has a mass that amounts to 1.2% of Earth's, and a diameter that is roughly one-quarter of Earth's or with 3,474\u00a0km (2,159\u00a0mi) about as wide as Australia.[17] Within the Solar System it is the most massive and largest satellite in relation to its parent planet, the fifth most massive and largest moon overall, and more massive and larger than all known dwarf planets.[18] Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of that of Mars, and after Jupiter's moon Io the second highest among all Solar System moons. The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51\u00a0billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Moon's diameter is about 3,500\u00a0km, more than a quarter of Earth's, with the face of the Moon comparable to the width of either Australia,[17] Europe or the US without Alaska.[69] The whole surface area of the Moon is about 38 million square kilometers, between the size of the Americas (North and South America) and Africa.\n\n\nThe Moon's mass is 1/81 of Earth's,[70] being the second densest among the planetary moons, and having the second highest surface gravity, after Io, at 0.1654\u00a0g and an escape velocity of 2.38\u00a0km/s (8600\u00a0km/h; 5300\u00a0mph).\n\n\n\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Internal structure of the Moon and Geology of the Moon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Size comparison of the main moons of the Solar System with Earth to scale. Nineteen moons are large enough to be round, several having subsurface oceans and one, Titan, having a considerable atmosphere.\nThe Moon is by size and mass the fifth largest natural satellite of the Solar System, categorizeable as one of its planetary-mass moons, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term.[18] It is smaller than Mercury and considerably larger than the largest dwarf planet of the Solar System, Pluto. While the minor-planet moon Charon of the Pluto-Charon system is larger relative to Pluto,[f][68] the Moon is the largest natural satellite of the Solar System relative to their primary planets.[g]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** The *maximum value* is given based on scaling of the brightness from the value of \u221212.74 given for an equator to Moon-centre distance of 378\u00a0000\u00a0km in the NASA factsheet reference to the minimum Earth\u2013Moon distance given there, after the latter is corrected for Earth's equatorial radius of 6\u00a0378\u00a0km, giving 350\u00a0600\u00a0km. The *minimum value* (for a distant new moon) is based on a similar scaling using the maximum Earth\u2013Moon distance of 407\u00a0000\u00a0km (given in the factsheet) and by calculating the brightness of the earthshine onto such a new moon. The brightness of the earthshine is [ Earth albedo \u00d7 (Earth radius / Radius of Moon's orbit)2\u00a0] relative to the direct solar illumination that occurs for a full moon. (Earth albedo = 0.367; Earth radius = (polar radius\u00a0\u00d7 equatorial radius)\u00bd = 6 367 km.)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Moon** is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384400\u00a0km (238900\u00a0mi), about 30 times the planet's diameter. The Moon always presents the same side to Earth, because gravitational pull has locked its rotation to the planet. This results in the lunar day of 29.5 days matching the lunar month. The Moon's gravitational pull\u00a0\u2013 and to a lesser extent the Sun's\u00a0\u2013 are the main drivers of the tides.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Lucey, Paul; Korotev, Randy L.; Gillis, Jeffrey J.; Taylor, Larry A.; Lawrence, David; Campbell, Bruce A.; Elphic, Rick; Feldman, Bill; Hood, Lon L.; Hunten, Donald; Mendillo, Michael; Noble, Sarah; Papike, James J.; Reedy, Robert C.; Lawson, Stefanie; Prettyman, Tom; Gasnault, Olivier; Maurice, Sylvestre (2006). \"Understanding the lunar surface and space-Moon interactions\". *Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry*. **60** (1): 83\u2013219.

This barycenter is 1,700\u00a0km (1,100\u00a0mi) (about a quarter of Earth's radius) beneath the Earth's surface.\n\n\nThe Moon's orbit is slightly elliptical, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.055.[1]\nThe semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit, called the Lunar distance, is approximately 400,000\u00a0km (250,000 miles or 1.28 light-seconds), comparable to going around Earth 9.5 times.[166]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** With 27% the diameter and 60% the density of Earth, the Moon has 1.23% of the mass of Earth. The moon Charon is larger relative to its primary Pluto, but Earth and the Moon are different since Pluto is considered a dwarf planet and not a planet, unlike Earth.\n7. **^** There is no strong correlation between the sizes of planets and the sizes of their satellites. Larger planets tend to have more satellites, both large and small, than smaller planets.\n8. **^** More accurately, the Moon's mean sidereal period (fixed star to fixed star) is 27.321661\u00a0days (27 d 07 h 43 min 11.5 s), and its mean tropical orbital period (from equinox to equinox) is 27.321582\u00a0days (27 d 07 h 43 min 04.7 s) (*Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris*, 1961, at p.107).\n9. **^** More accurately, the Moon's mean synodic period (between mean solar conjunctions) is 29.530589\u00a0days (29 d 12 h 44 min 02.9 s) (*Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris*, 1961, at p.107).\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Moon is a very slightly scalene ellipsoid due to tidal stretching, with its long axis displaced 30\u00b0 from facing the Earth, due to gravitational anomalies from impact basins. Its shape is more elongated than current tidal forces can account for. This 'fossil bulge' indicates that the Moon solidified when it orbited at half its current distance to the Earth, and that it is now too cold for its shape to restore hydrostatic equilibrium at its current orbital distance.[67]\n\n\n\n### Size and mass[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of natural satellites\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNatural satellites of the Solar System\n |\n| --- |\n| Planetarysatellites of | * Earth\n* Mars\n* Jupiter\n* Saturn\n* Uranus\n* Neptune\n | ![](image)![](image)![](image)\n |\n| Dwarf planetsatellites of | * Orcus\n* Pluto\n* Haumea\n* Quaoar\n* Makemake\n* Gonggong\n* Eris\n |\n| Minor-planetmoons | Near-Earth\nFlorence\nDidymos\nDimorphos\nMoshup\nSquannit\n1994 CC\n2001 SN263\nMain belt\nKalliope\nLinus\nEuphrosyne\nDaphne\nPeneius\nEugenia\nPetit-Prince\nSylvia\nRomulus\nRemus\nMinerva\nAegis\nGorgoneion\nCamilla\nElektra\nKleopatra\nAlexhelios\nCleoselene\nIda\nDactyl\nRoxane\nOlympias\nPulcova\nBalam\nDinkinesh (Selam)\nJupiter trojans\nPatroclus\nMenoetius\nHektor\nSkamandrios\nEurybates\nQueta\nTNOs\nLempo\nHiisi\nPaha\n2002 UX25\nSila\u2013Nunam\nSalacia\nActaea\nVarda\nIlmar\u00eb\nG\u01c3k\u00fan\u01c1\u02bch\u00f2md\u00edm\u00e0\nG\u01c3\u00f2\u02bc\u00e9 \u01c3H\u00fa\n2013 FY27\n |\n| Rankedby size | * Ganymede\n\t+ **largest**: 5268 km / 0.413 Earths\n* Titan\n* Callisto\n* Io\n* Moon\n* Europa\n* Triton\n* Titania\n* Rhea\n* Oberon\n* Iapetus\n* Charon\n* Umbriel\n* Ariel\n* Dione\n* Tethys\n* Dysnomia\n* Enceladus\n* Miranda\n* Vanth\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Moon has been also a site of Earth observation, particularly culturally as in the photograph called *Earthrise*.

Even satellites that initially pass within the Roche limit can reliably and predictably survive, by being partially stripped and then torqued onto wider, stable orbits.[58]\n\n\nOn 1 November 2023, scientists reported that, according to computer simulations, remnants of a protoplanet, named Theia, could be inside the Earth, left over from a collision with the Earth in ancient times, and afterwards becoming the Moon.[59][60]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** Morais, M.

Its composition is not well understood, but is probably metallic iron alloyed with a small amount of sulfur and nickel; analyses of the Moon's time-variable rotation suggest that it is at least partly molten.[77] The pressure at the lunar core is estimated to be 5\u00a0GPa (49,000\u00a0atm).[78]\n\n\n\n### Gravitational field[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An astronaut jumping on the Moon, illustrating that the gravitational pull of the Moon is approximately 1/6 of Earth's.\nOn average the Moon's surface gravity is 1.62\u00a0m/s2[4] (0.1654\u00a0g; 5.318\u00a0ft/s2), about half of the surface gravity of Mars and about a sixth of Earth's.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Large image of the Moon's north pole area Archived 23 August 2016 at the Wayback Machine\n\n\n### Observation tools[edit]\n\n\n* \"NASA's SKYCAL \u2013 Sky Events Calendar\".

Each body therefore appeared much larger in the sky of the other, eclipses were more frequent, and tidal effects were stronger.[61]\nDue to tidal acceleration, the Moon's orbit around Earth has become significantly larger, with a longer period.[62]\n\n\nFollowing formation, the Moon has cooled and most of its atmosphere has been stripped.[63] The lunar surface has since been shaped by large impact events and many small ones, forming a landscape featuring craters of all ages.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe prevailing theory is that the Earth\u2013Moon system formed after a giant impact of a Mars-sized body (named *Theia*) with the proto-Earth. The oblique impact blasted material into orbit about the Earth and the material accreted and formed the Moon[44][45] just beyond the Earth's Roche limit of ~2.56\u00a0*R*\ud83d\udf28.[46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n135. **^** Richard Lovett (2011). \"Early Earth may have had two moons\u00a0: Nature News\". *Nature*. doi:10.1038/news.2011.456.

In the northern hemisphere it appears upside down compared to the view from the southern hemisphere.[186] Sometimes the \"horns\" of a crescent moon appear to be pointing more upwards than sideways. This phenomenon is called a wet moon and occurs more frequently in the tropics.[187]\n\n\nThe distance between the Moon and Earth varies from around 356,400\u00a0km (221,500\u00a0mi) (perigee) to 406,700\u00a0km (252,700\u00a0mi) (apogee), making the Moon's apparent size fluctuate. On average the Moon's angular diameter is about 0.52\u00b0, roughly the same apparent size as the Sun (see \u00a7\u00a0Eclipses). In addition, a purely psychological effect, known as the Moon illusion, makes the Moon appear larger when close to the horizon.[188]\n\n\nDespite the Moon's tidal locking, the effect of libration makes about 59% of the Moon's surface visible from Earth over the course of one month.[168][70]\n\n\n\n### Rotation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Unified Geologic Map of the Moon \u2013 United States Geological Survey\n* Moon Trek \u2013 An integrated map browser of datasets and maps for the Moon\n* The Moon on Google Maps, a 3-D rendition of the Moon akin to Google Earth\n* \"Consolidated Lunar Atlas\".

It orbits Mars much faster than Mars rotates and completes an orbit in just 7 hours and 39 minutes.[10] As a result, from the surface of Mars it appears to rise in the west, move across the sky in 4 hours and 15 minutes or less, and set in the east, twice each Martian day.\n\n\nPhobos is one of the least reflective bodies in the Solar System, with an albedo of 0.071. Surface temperatures range from about \u22124\u00a0\u00b0C (25\u00a0\u00b0F) on the sunlit side to \u2212112\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212170\u00a0\u00b0F) on the shadowed side.[11] The notable surface feature is the large impact crater, Stickney, which takes up a substantial proportion of the moon's surface. The surface is also home to many grooves, with there being numerous theories as to how these grooves were formed.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Volume | 5695\u00b132\u00a0km3[6] |\n| Mass | 1.0659\u00d71016\u00a0kg[5] |\n| Mean density\n | 1.861\u00b10.011\u00a0g/cm3[6] |\n| Surface gravity\n | 0.0057\u00a0m/s2[5](581.4 \u00b5 g) |\n| Escape velocity\n | 11.39 m/s(41 km/h)[5] |\n| Synodic rotation period\n | Synchronous |\n| Equatorial rotation\u00a0velocity\n | 11.0\u00a0km/h (6.8\u00a0mph) (at longest axis) |\n| Axial tilt\n | 0\u00b0 |\n| Albedo | 0.071 \u00b1 0.012 at 0.54\u00a0\u03bcm[7] |\n| Temperature | \u2248\u2009233 K |\n| Apparent magnitude\n | 11.8[8] |\n|  |\n\n\n**Phobos** (/\u02c8fo\u028ab\u0252s/; systematic designation: **Mars I**) is the innermost and larger of the two natural satellites of Mars,[9] the other being Deimos.

The current Martian atmosphere is too thin to capture a Phobos-sized object by atmospheric braking.[62] Geoffrey A. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n92. **^** Lee, Pascal; Veverka, Joseph F.; Bellerose, Julie; Boucher, Marc; et al.; 2010; \"Hall: A Phobos and Deimos Sample Return Mission\", *44th Lunar Planetary Science Conference*, The Woodlands, TX. 1\u20135 Mar 2010.

With an altitude of 5,989\u00a0km (3,721\u00a0mi), Phobos orbits Mars below the synchronous orbit radius, meaning that it moves around Mars faster than Mars itself rotates.[35] Therefore, from the point of view of an observer on the surface of Mars, it rises in the west, moves comparatively rapidly across the sky (in 4 h 15 min or less) and sets in the east, approximately twice each Martian day (every 11 h 6 min). Because it is close to the surface and in an equatorial orbit, it cannot be seen above the horizon from latitudes greater than 70.4\u00b0. Its orbit is so low that its angular diameter, as seen by an observer on Mars, varies visibly with its position in the sky. Seen at the horizon, Phobos is about 0.14\u00b0 wide; at zenith it is 0.20\u00b0, one-third as wide as the full Moon as seen from Earth. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe density of Phobos has now been directly measured by spacecraft to be 1.887 g/cm3.[27] Current observations are consistent with Phobos being a rubble pile.[27] In addition, images obtained by the *Viking* probes in the 1970s clearly showed a natural object, not an artificial one. Nevertheless, mapping by the *Mars Express* probe and subsequent volume calculations do suggest the presence of voids and indicate that it is not a solid chunk of rock but a porous body.[28] The porosity of Phobos was calculated to be 30% \u00b1 5%, or a quarter to a third being empty.[29]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n*Top:* The impact crater Stickney imaged by the *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter* in March 2008.

By analyzing the seismic and orbital data from Mars InSight Mission and other missions, they proposed that the moons are born from disruption of a common parent body around 1 to 2.7 billion years ago. The common progenitor of Phobos and Deimos was most probably hit by another object and shattered to form both moons.[73]\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phobos over Mars, photo by ESA *Mars Express*\n### Launched missions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNatural satellites of the Solar System\n |\n| --- |\n| Planetarysatellites of | * Earth\n* Mars\n* Jupiter\n* Saturn\n* Uranus\n* Neptune\n | ![](image)![](image)![](image)\n |\n| Dwarf planetsatellites of | * Orcus\n* Pluto\n* Haumea\n* Quaoar\n* Makemake\n* Gonggong\n* Eris\n |\n| Minor-planetmoons | Near-Earth\nFlorence\nDidymos\nDimorphos\nMoshup\nSquannit\n1994 CC\n2001 SN263\nMain belt\nKalliope\nLinus\nEuphrosyne\nDaphne\nPeneius\nEugenia\nPetit-Prince\nSylvia\nRomulus\nRemus\nMinerva\nAegis\nGorgoneion\nCamilla\nElektra\nKleopatra\nAlexhelios\nCleoselene\nIda\nDactyl\nRoxane\nOlympias\nPulcova\nBalam\nDinkinesh (Selam)\nJupiter trojans\nPatroclus\nMenoetius\nHektor\nSkamandrios\nEurybates\nQueta\nTNOs\nLempo\nHiisi\nPaha\n2002 UX25\nSila\u2013Nunam\nSalacia\nActaea\nVarda\nIlmar\u00eb\nG\u01c3k\u00fan\u01c1\u02bch\u00f2md\u00edm\u00e0\nG\u01c3\u00f2\u02bc\u00e9 \u01c3H\u00fa\n2013 FY27\n |\n| Rankedby size | * Ganymede\n\t+ **largest**: 5268 km / 0.413 Earths\n* Titan\n* Callisto\n* Io\n* Moon\n* Europa\n* Triton\n* Titania\n* Rhea\n* Oberon\n* Iapetus\n* Charon\n* Umbriel\n* Ariel\n* Dione\n* Tethys\n* Dysnomia\n* Enceladus\n* Miranda\n* Vanth\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n115. **^** Arias, Francisco.

Phobos's phases, inasmuch as they can be observed from Mars, take 0.3191 days (Phobos's synodic period) to run their course, a mere 13 seconds longer than Phobos's sidereal period.\n\n\n\n\n### Solar transits[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transit of Phobos from Mars\n\nPhobos transits the Sun, as viewed by the *Perseverance* rover on 2 April 2022\nAn observer situated on the Martian surface, in a position to observe Phobos, would see regular transits of Phobos across the Sun. Several of these transits have been photographed by the Mars Rover *Opportunity*. During the transits, Phobos's shadow is cast on the surface of Mars; an event which has been photographed by several spacecraft. Phobos is not large enough to cover the Sun's disk, and so cannot cause a total eclipse.[56]\n\n\n\n### Predicted destruction[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother hypothesis is that Mars was once surrounded by many Phobos- and Deimos-sized bodies, perhaps ejected into orbit around it by a collision with a large planetesimal.[69] The high porosity of the interior of Phobos (based on the density of 1.88 g/cm3, voids are estimated to comprise 25 to 35 percent of Phobos's volume) is inconsistent with an asteroidal origin.[29] Observations of Phobos in the thermal infrared suggest a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates, which are well known from the surface of Mars. The spectra are distinct from those of all classes of chondrite meteorites, again pointing away from an asteroidal origin.[70] Both sets of findings support an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit,[71] similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's moon.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n87. **^** Amos, Jonathan; *Martian Moon \u2019Could be Key Test\u2019*, BBC News (9 February 2007)\n88. **^** Optech press release, \"Canadian Mission Concept to Mysterious Mars moon Phobos to Feature Unique Rock-Dock Maneuver\", 3 May 2007\n89. **^** PRIME: Phobos Reconnaissance & International Mars Exploration Archived 24 July 2007 at the Wayback Machine, Mars Institute website, accessed 27 July 2009.\n90. **^** Lee, Pascal; Richards, Robert; Hildebrand, Alan; and the PRIME Mission Team 2008, \"The PRIME (Phobos Reconnaissance and International Mars Exploration) Mission and Mars sample Return\", in *39th Lunar Planetary Science Conference*, Houston, TX, March 2008, [#2268]\n91. **^** Mullen, Leslie (30 April 2009). \"New Missions Target Mars Moon Phobos\". *Astrobiology Magazine*.

This flyby provided images of the moon's polar regions.[115][116] In June 2021, *Juno* performed a second flyby, at a closer distance of 1,038 kilometers (645\u00a0mi).[106][117] This encounter was designed to provide a gravity assist to reduce *Juno'*s orbital period from 53 days to 43 days. Additional images of the surface were collected.[106]\n\n\n\n### Future missions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChinese astronomical records report that in 365 BC, Gan De detected what might have been a moon of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, with the naked eye.[29] However, Gan De reported the color of the companion as reddish, which is puzzling since moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with the naked eye.[30] Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.[31][32]\n\n\nOn January 7, 1610, Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe what he thought were three stars near Jupiter, including what turned out to be Ganymede, Callisto, and one body that turned out to be the combined light from Io and Europa; the next night he noticed that they had moved. On January 13, he saw all four at once for the first time, but had seen each of the moons before this date at least once. By January 15, Galileo came to the conclusion that the stars were actually bodies orbiting Jupiter.[1][2][g]\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGanymede| ![Photograph of Ganymede](image)Ganymede photographed by *Juno* in 2021\n |\n| Discovery[1][2] |\n| Discovered\u00a0by | Galileo GalileiSimon Marius |\n| Discovery\u00a0date | January 7, 1610 |\n| Designations |\n| Pronunciation | /\u02c8\u0261\u00e6n\u0259\u02ccmi\u02d0d/[3]*GAN-\u0259-MEED* |\n| Named after\n | \u0393\u03b1\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03ae\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2, *Ganym\u0113d\u0113s* |\n| Alternative names\n | Jupiter III |\n| Adjectives | Ganymedian,[4]Ganymedean[5][6] (/\u02cc\u0261\u00e6n\u0259\u02c8mi\u02d0di.\u0259n/) |\n| Orbital characteristics |\n| Periapsis | 1069200\u00a0km[a] |\n| Apoapsis | 1071600\u00a0km[b] |\n| Semi-major axis\n | 1070400\u00a0km[7] |\n| Eccentricity | 0.0013[7] |\n| Orbital period (sidereal)\n | 7.15455296\u00a0d[7] |\n| Average orbital speed\n | 10.880\u00a0km/s |\n| Inclination | 2.214\u00b0 (to the ecliptic)0.20\u00b0 (to Jupiter's equator)[7] |\n| Satellite\u00a0of | Jupiter |\n| Group | Galilean moon |\n| Physical characteristics |\n| Mean radius\n | 2634.1\u00b10.3\u00a0km (0.413 Earths)[8] |\n| Surface area\n | 8.72\u00d7107\u00a0km2 (0.171 Earths)[c] |\n| Volume | 7.66\u00d71010\u00a0km3 (0.0704 Earths)[d] |\n| Mass | 1.4819\u00d71023\u00a0kg \n(0.025 Earths)[8] |\n| Mean density\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Proteus\n* Mimas\n* Ilmar\u00eb\n* Nereid\n* Hi\u02bbiaka\n* Actaea\n* Hyperion\n* Phoebe\n* ...\n |\n| * Discovery timeline\n* Inner moons\n* Irregular moons\n* List\n* Planetary-mass moons\n* Naming\n* Subsatellite\n* Regular moons\n* Trojan moons\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nJupiter\n |\n| --- |\n| * Outline of Jupiter\n |\n| Geography | * Atmosphere\n\t+ Great Red Spot\n* Magnetosphere\n* Rings\n* Jupiter's North Pole\n* Jupiter's South Pole\n | ![NASA image of Jupiter](image)\n |\n| Moons | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Inner moons | * Metis\n* Adrastea\n* Amalthea\n* Thebe\n |\n| Galilean moons | * Io\n* Europa\n* Ganymede\n* Callisto\n |\n| Irregular moons | * Himalia group\n* Themisto\n* Carpo\n* Valetudo\n* Ananke group\n* Carme group\n* Pasiphae group\n |\n\n |\n| Astronomy | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| General | * Jupiter-crossing minor planets\n* Solar eclipses\n |\n| Trojans | * Greek camp\n* Trojan camp\n |\n| Impact events | * Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9\n* 2009 Jupiter impact event\n* 2010 Jupiter impact event\n* 2016 Jupiter impact event\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Freeman, J.

Better data can be obtained from a spacecraft which is orbiting Jupiter, as it can encounter Ganymede at a lower speed and adjust the orbit for a closer approach. In 1995, the *Galileo* spacecraft entered orbit around Jupiter and between 1996 and 2000 made six close flybys of Ganymede.[37] These flybys were denoted G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29.[21] During the closest flyby (G2), *Galileo* passed just 264\u00a0km from the surface of Ganymede (five percent of the moon's diameter),[21] which remains the closest approach by any spacecraft. During the G1 flyby in 1996, *Galileo* instruments detected Ganymede's magnetic field.[112] Data from the *Galileo* flybys was used to discover the sub-surface ocean, which was announced in 2001.[21][37] High spatial resolution spectra of Ganymede taken by *Galileo* were used to identify several non-ice compounds on the surface.[49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Hall, D.

Like most known moons, Ganymede is tidally locked, with one side always facing toward the planet, hence its day is also seven days and three hours.[37] Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.0009\u20130.0022 and 0.05\u20130.32\u00b0, respectively.[38] These orbital variations cause the axial tilt (the angle between the rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0 and 0.33\u00b0.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNatural satellites of the Solar System\n |\n| --- |\n| Planetarysatellites of | * Earth\n* Mars\n* Jupiter\n* Saturn\n* Uranus\n* Neptune\n | ![](image)![](image)![](image)\n |\n| Dwarf planetsatellites of | * Orcus\n* Pluto\n* Haumea\n* Quaoar\n* Makemake\n* Gonggong\n* Eris\n |\n| Minor-planetmoons | Near-Earth\nFlorence\nDidymos\nDimorphos\nMoshup\nSquannit\n1994 CC\n2001 SN263\nMain belt\nKalliope\nLinus\nEuphrosyne\nDaphne\nPeneius\nEugenia\nPetit-Prince\nSylvia\nRomulus\nRemus\nMinerva\nAegis\nGorgoneion\nCamilla\nElektra\nKleopatra\nAlexhelios\nCleoselene\nIda\nDactyl\nRoxane\nOlympias\nPulcova\nBalam\nDinkinesh (Selam)\nJupiter trojans\nPatroclus\nMenoetius\nHektor\nSkamandrios\nEurybates\nQueta\nTNOs\nLempo\nHiisi\nPaha\n2002 UX25\nSila\u2013Nunam\nSalacia\nActaea\nVarda\nIlmar\u00eb\nG\u01c3k\u00fan\u01c1\u02bch\u00f2md\u00edm\u00e0\nG\u01c3\u00f2\u02bc\u00e9 \u01c3H\u00fa\n2013 FY27\n |\n| Rankedby size | * Ganymede\n\t+ **largest**: 5268 km / 0.413 Earths\n* Titan\n* Callisto\n* Io\n* Moon\n* Europa\n* Triton\n* Titania\n* Rhea\n* Oberon\n* Iapetus\n* Charon\n* Umbriel\n* Ariel\n* Dione\n* Tethys\n* Dysnomia\n* Enceladus\n* Miranda\n* Vanth\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Eviatar, Aharon; Vasyliunas, Vytenis M.; et\u00a0al.

There are 146 moons with confirmed orbits.[1][a] This number does not include the many thousands of moonlets embedded within Saturn's dense rings, nor hundreds of possible kilometer-sized distant moons that were seen through telescopes but not recaptured.[3][4][5] Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to have collapsed into a relaxed, ellipsoidal shape, though only one or two of those, Titan and possibly Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium. Three moons are particularly notable. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Phoebe, at 213\u00b11.4\u00a0km in diameter, is by far the largest of Saturn's irregular satellites.[28] It has a retrograde orbit and rotates on its axis every 9.3 hours.[83] Phoebe was the first moon of Saturn to be studied in detail by *Cassini*, in June 2004; during this encounter *Cassini* was able to map nearly 90% of the moon's surface. Phoebe has a nearly spherical shape and a relatively high density of about 1.6\u00a0g/cm3.[28] *Cassini* images revealed a dark surface scarred by numerous impacts\u2014there are about 130 craters with diameters exceeding 10\u00a0km. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![A large bright circle in the center is surrounded by small circles.](image)Saturn (overexposed) and the moons Iapetus, Titan, Dione, Hyperion, and Rhea viewed through a 12.5-inch telescope\n### Early observations[edit]\n\n\nBefore the advent of telescopic photography, eight moons of Saturn were discovered by direct observation using optical telescopes. Saturn's largest moon, Titan, was discovered in 1655 by Christiaan Huygens using a 57-millimeter (2.2\u00a0in) objective lens[12] on a refracting telescope of his own design.[13] Tethys, Dione, Rhea and Iapetus (the \"Sidera Lodoicea\") were discovered between 1671 and 1684 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini.[14] Mimas and Enceladus were discovered in 1789 by William Herschel.[14] Hyperion was discovered in 1848 by W. C. Bond, G. P. Bond[15] and William Lassell.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe remaining 122, with mean diameters ranging from 2 to 213\u00a0km (1 to 132\u00a0mi), are *irregular satellites*, whose orbits are much farther from Saturn, have high inclinations, and are mixed between prograde and retrograde. These moons are probably captured minor planets, or fragments from the collisional breakup of such bodies after they were captured, creating collisional families. Saturn is expected to have around 150 irregular satellites larger than 2.8\u00a0km (1.7\u00a0mi) in diameter, plus many hundreds more that are even smaller. The irregular satellites are classified by their orbital characteristics into the prograde Inuit and Gallic groups and the large retrograde Norse group, and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies (with the Gallic group corresponding to Celtic mythology). The sole exception is Phoebe, the ninth moon of Saturn and largest irregular one, discovered at the end of the 19th century; it is part of the Norse group but named for a Greek Titaness.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSaturn's major satellites, compared to the Moon\n| Name | Diameter(km)[40] | Mass(kg)[41] | Orbital radius(km)[42] | Orbital period(days)[42] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Mimas** | 396(0.12\u00a0*D*\u263e) | 4\u00d71019(0.0005\u00a0*M*\u263e) | 185,539(0.48\u00a0*a*\u263e) | 0.9(0.03\u00a0*T*\u263e)\n |\n| **Enceladus** | 504(0.14\u00a0*D*\u263e) | 1.1\u00d71020(0.002\u00a0*M*\u263e) | 237,948(0.62\u00a0*a*\u263e) | 1.4(0.05\u00a0*T*\u263e)\n |\n| **Tethys** | 1,062(0.30\u00a0*D*\u263e) | 6.2\u00d71020(0.008\u00a0*M*\u263e) | 294,619(0.77\u00a0*a*\u263e) | 1.9(0.07\u00a0*T*\u263e)\n |\n| **Dione** | 1,123(0.32\u00a0*D*\u263e) | 1.1\u00d71021(0.015\u00a0*M*\u263e) | 377,396(0.98\u00a0*a*\u263e) | 2.7(0.10\u00a0*T*\u263e)\n |\n| **Rhea** | 1,527(0.44\u00a0*D*\u263e) | 2.3\u00d71021(0.03\u00a0*M*\u263e) | 527,108(1.37\u00a0*a*\u263e) | 4.5(0.20\u00a0*T*\u263e)\n |\n| **Titan** | 5,149(1.48\u00a0*D*\u263e)(0.75\u00a0*D*\u2642) | 1.35\u00d71023(1.80\u00a0*M*\u263e)(0.21\u00a0*M*\u2642) | 1,221,870(3.18\u00a0*a*\u263e) | 16(0.60\u00a0*T*\u263e)\n |\n| **Iapetus** | 1,470(0.42\u00a0*D*\u263e) | 1.8\u00d71021(0.025\u00a0*M*\u263e) | 3,560,820(9.26\u00a0*a*\u263e) | 79(2.90\u00a0*T*\u263e)\n |\n\n\n## Orbital groups[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Ashton, Edward; Gladman, Brett; Beaudoin, Matthew (August 2021). \"Evidence for a Recent Collision in Saturn's Irregular Moon Population\". *The Planetary Science Journal*. **2** (4): 12.

Absolute magnitudes of irregular satellites were taken from the Minor Planet Center's Natural Satellites Ephemeris Service.[84] Calculations were made with NASA/JPL's Asteroid Size Estimator.[85]\n7. **^**  The diameters and dimensions of the small inner moons, from Pan to Helene, are taken from Thomas et al., 2020, Table 1.[86] Diameters and dimensions of Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Iapetus, and Phoebe are from Thomas 2010, Table 1.[40] Diameters of Siarnaq and Albiorix are from Grav et al., 2015, Table 3.[81] The approximate sizes of all other irregular satellites are calculated from their absolute magnitudes with an assumed geometric albedo of 0.04,[85] which is the average value for that population.[81]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe rings of Saturn are made up of objects ranging in size from microscopic to moonlets hundreds of meters across, each in its own orbit around Saturn.[9] Thus a precise number of Saturnian moons cannot be given, because there is no objective boundary between the countless small anonymous objects that form Saturn's ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons. Over 150 moonlets embedded in the rings have been detected by the disturbance they create in the surrounding ring material, though this is thought to be only a small sample of the total population of such objects.[4]\n\n\nThere are 83 designated moons that are still unnamed (as of May 2023[update]); all but one (the designated B-ring moonlet S/2009 S 1) are irregular. (There are many other undesignated ring moonlets.) If named, most of the irregulars will receive names from Gallic, Norse and Inuit mythology based on the orbital group of which they are a member.[10][11]\n\n\n\n\n## Discovery[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe researchers extrapolated that the true population of Saturnian irregular moons larger than 2.8\u00a0km (1.7\u00a0mi) in diameter amounts to 150\u00b130, which is approximately three times as many Jovian irregular moons down to the same size. If this size distribution applies to even smaller diameters, Saturn would therefore intrinsically have more irregular moons than Jupiter.[5]\n\n\n**Discovery of outer planet moons**\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

It has a higher density than the geologically dead Rhea, the largest inner moon, but lower than that of active Enceladus.[50] While the majority of Dione's surface is heavily cratered old terrain, this moon is also covered with an extensive network of troughs and lineaments, indicating that in the past it had global tectonic activity.[54] The troughs and lineaments are especially prominent on the trailing hemisphere, where several intersecting sets of fractures form what is called \"wispy terrain\".[54] The cratered plains have a few large impact craters reaching 250\u00a0km in diameter.[51] Smooth plains with low impact-crater counts are also present on a small fraction of its surface.[55] They were probably tectonically resurfaced relatively later in the geological history of Dione. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2007, the discovery of 150 more moonlets revealed that they (with the exception of two that have been seen outside the Encke gap) are confined to three narrow bands in the A Ring between 126,750 and 132,000\u00a0km from Saturn's center. Each band is about a thousand kilometers wide, which is less than 1% the width of Saturn's rings.[4] This region is relatively free from the disturbances caused by resonances with larger satellites,[4] although other areas of the A Ring without disturbances are apparently free of moonlets. The moonlets were probably formed from the breakup of a larger satellite.[46] It is estimated that the A Ring contains 7,000\u20138,000 propellers larger than 0.8\u00a0km in size and millions larger than 0.25\u00a0km.[4] In April 2014, NASA scientists reported the possible consolidation of a new moon within the A Ring, implying that Saturn's present moons may have formed in a similar process in the past when Saturn's ring system was much more massive.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJanus and Epimetheus are called co-orbital moons.[19] They are of roughly equal size, with Janus being slightly larger than Epimetheus.[43] Janus and Epimetheus have orbits with only a few kilometers difference in semi-major axis, close enough that they would collide if they attempted to pass each other. Instead of colliding, their gravitational interaction causes them to swap orbits every four years.[49]\n\n\n\n\n### Inner large[edit]\n\n\n![A circular part of a grayish surface, which is intersected from the top-left to the bottom-right by four wide sinuous groves.

One of the largest F Ring moonlets may be the as-yet unconfirmed object S/2004 S 6. The F Ring also contains transient \"fans\" which are thought to result from even smaller moonlets, about 1\u00a0km in diameter, orbiting near the F Ring core.[47]\n\n\nOne of the recently discovered moons, Aegaeon, resides within the bright arc of G Ring and is trapped in the 7:6 mean-motion resonance with Mimas.[25] This means that it makes exactly seven revolutions around Saturn while Mimas makes exactly six. The moon is the largest among the population of bodies that are sources of dust in this ring.[48]\n\n\n\n### Ring shepherds[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rings of Saturn\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n96. **^** SETI Institute (March 25, 2016). \"Moons of Saturn may be younger than the dinosaurs\". *Astronomy*.\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Moons of Saturn.\n\n* Scott S.

Even excluding Titan (right), Phoebe, Hyperion, the smaller moons and the rings are invisible.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Iapetus is the third-largest of Saturn's moons.[50] Orbiting the planet at 3.5 million km, it is by far the most distant of Saturn's large moons, and also has the largest orbital inclination, at 15.47\u00b0.[42] Iapetus has long been known for its unusual two-toned surface; its leading hemisphere is pitch-black and its trailing hemisphere is almost as bright as fresh snow.[76] *Cassini* images showed that the dark material is confined to a large near-equatorial area on the leading hemisphere called Cassini Regio, which extends approximately from 40\u00b0N to 40\u00b0S.[76] The pole regions of Iapetus are as bright as its trailing hemisphere. *Cassini* also discovered a 20\u00a0km tall equatorial ridge, which spans nearly the moon's entire equator.[76] Otherwise both dark and bright surfaces of Iapetus are old and heavily cratered. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** Sheppard, Scott S.; Gladman, Brett J.; Alexandersen, Mike A.; Trujillo, Chadwick A.

Many small moons have not yet received a permanent designation.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe use of long-exposure photographic plates made possible the discovery of additional moons. The first to be discovered in this manner, Phoebe, was found in 1899 by W. H. Pickering.[17] In 1966 the tenth satellite of Saturn was discovered by Audouin Dollfus, when the rings were observed edge-on near an equinox.[18] It was later named Janus. A few years later it was realized that all observations of 1966 could only be explained if another satellite had been present and that it had an orbit similar to that of Janus.[18] This object is now known as Epimetheus, the eleventh moon of Saturn. It shares the same orbit with Janus\u2014the only known example of co-orbitals in the Solar System.[19] In 1980, three additional Saturnian moons were discovered from the ground and later confirmed by the *Voyager* probes. They are trojan moons of Dione (Helene) and Tethys (Telesto and Calypso).[19]\n\n\n\n### Observations by spacecraft[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNatural satellites of the planet Saturn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n84. **^** \"Natural Satellites Ephemeris Service\".
