Its membership, as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869, consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom constitute a quorum.[1][2] Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants plenary power to the president of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court; justices have life tenure.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 116 people have served on the Court. The length of service on the Court for the 107 non-incumbent justices ranges from William O. Douglas's 36Â years, 209Â days to John Rutledge's 1Â year, 18Â days as associate justice and, separated by a period of years off the Court, his 138Â days as chief justice. As of June 13, 2024, the length of service for the nine incumbent justices ranges from Clarence Thomas's 32Â years, 234Â days to Ketanji Brown Jackson's 1Â year, 349Â days. Five individuals, who were confirmed for associate justice, were later appointed chief justice separately: John Rutledge,[a] Edward Douglass White,[b] Charles Evans Hughes,[a] Harlan F. Stone[b] and William Rehnquist.[b] While listed twice, each of them has been assigned only one index number. The justices of the Supreme Court are:[9][10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Although Lewis Powell and William H. Rehnquist were both sworn into office as associate justice on the same day, Powell by law took precedence as the more senior associate justice, his judicial commission bearing the date Dec.Â 9, 1971; Rehnquist's commission bore the date of Dec.Â 16, 1971.\n15. **^** Acted as chief justice under 62 Stat. 869, September 3â€“29, 2005.\n\n## Timeline of justices[edit]\n\n\nThis graphical timeline depicts the progression of the justices on the U.S. Supreme Court.[9][10] Information regarding each justice's predecessors, successors, and fellow justices, as well as their tenure on the court, can be gleaned (and comparisons between justices drawn) from it. There are no formal names or numbers for the individual seats of the associate justices, which are listed in the table below simply by number. Additionally, the progression of U.S. presidents is shown at the top of the timeline to give a more detailed historical context.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **106** | ![](image) | **Clarence Thomas(born 1948)** | **GA** | **AssociateJustice** | **T.

Beginning in the early 20th century, many justices who left the Court voluntarily did so by retiring from the Court without leaving the federal judiciary altogether. A retired justice, according to the United States Code, is no longer a member of the Supreme Court, but remains eligible to serve by designation as a judge of a U.S. Court of Appeals or District Court, and many retired justices have served in these capacities. Historically, the average length of service on the Court has been less than 15 years. However, since 1970 the average length of service has increased to about 26 years.[8]\n\n\n\n## List of justices[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **Associate justices:** Clarence Thomas\n* Samuel Alito\n* Sonia Sotomayor\n* Elena Kagan\n* Neil Gorsuch\n* Brett Kavanaugh\n* Amy Coney Barrett\n* Ketanji Brown Jackson\n |\n| Retired justices | * Anthony Kennedy\n* David Souter\n* Stephen Breyer\n |\n| History | * Jay Court (1789â€“1795)\n* Rutledge Court (1795)\n* Ellsworth Court (1796â€“1800)\n* Marshall Court (1801â€“1835)\n* Taney Court (1836â€“1864)\n* Chase Court (1864â€“1873)\n* Waite Court (1874â€“1888)\n* Fuller Court (1888â€“1910)\n* White Court (1910â€“1921)\n* Taft Court (1921â€“1930)\n* Hughes Court (1930â€“1941)\n* Stone Court (1941â€“1946)\n* Vinson Court (1946â€“1953)\n* Warren Court (1953â€“1969)\n* Burger Court (1969â€“1986)\n* Rehnquist Court (1986â€“2005)\n* Roberts Court (2005â€“present)\n |\n| Lists of justicesand nominees | * Chief justices\n* Associate justices\n* All justices\n\t+ court\n\t+ education\n\t+ seat\n\t+ time in office\n* All nominations\n\t+ unsuccessful\n* Justices who served in Congress\n* Burial places of justices\n |\n| Statutes affectingcourt size | * Judiciary Act of 1789\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![](image) | Sandra Day O'Connor(born 1930) | AZ | AssociateJustice | Stewart | September 21, 1981(99â€“0)\n | September 25, 1981â€“January 31, 2006(Retired) | 24Â years, 128Â days\n | Ronald Reagan |\n| 100\n | ![](image) | William Rehnquist(1924â€“2005) | VA | ChiefJustice | Burger | September 17, 1986(65â€“33)\n | September 26, 1986â€“September 3, 2005(Died) | 18Â years, 342Â days\n |\n| 103\n | ![](image) | Antonin Scalia(1936â€“2016) | VA | AssociateJustice | Rehnquist | September 17, 1986(98â€“0)\n | September 26, 1986â€“February 13, 2016(Died) | 29Â years, 140Â days\n |\n| 104\n | ![](image) | Anthony Kennedy(born 1936) | CA | AssociateJustice | Powell | February 3, 1988(97â€“0)\n | February 18, 1988â€“July 31, 2018(Retired) | 30Â years, 163Â days\n |\n| 105\n | ![](image) | David Souter(born 1939) | NH | AssociateJustice | Brennan | October 2, 1990(90â€“9)\n | October 9, 1990â€“June 29, 2009(Retired) | 18Â years, 263Â days\n | George H.

An 1801 act would have decreased the Court's size to five members upon its next vacancy. However, an 1802 act negated the effects of the 1801 act upon the Court before any such vacancy occurred, maintaining the Court's size at six members. Later legislation increased its size to seven members in 1807, to nine in 1837, and to ten in 1863. An 1866 act was to have reduced the Court's size from ten members to seven upon its next three vacancies, and two vacancies did occur during this period. However, before a third vacancy occurred, the Judiciary Act of 1869 intervened, restoring the Court's size to nine members, where it has remained ever since.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_OMzHS0bPACzw7Jha76xiIVPU","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
