They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one out of three laureates to be awarded the Nobel Prize twice in the same subject, in 1958 and 1980. John Bardeen, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956 and 1972, and Karl Barry Sharpless, who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2001 and 2022, are the others. Two others have won Nobel Prizes twice, one in chemistry and one in another subject: Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie (physics in 1903, chemistry in 1911) and Linus Pauling (chemistry in 1954, peace in 1962).[6] As of 2022, the prize has been awarded to 189 individuals, including eight women (Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie being the first to be awarded in 1911).[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n55. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1955\".

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896. These prizes are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, of the Netherlands. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[3] In 1901, van 't Hoff received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n90. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1990\".

There were also nine years for which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was delayed for one year. The Prize was not awarded in 1914, as the Nobel Committee for Chemistry decided that none of that year's nominations met the necessary criteria, but was awarded to Theodore William Richards in 1915 and counted as the 1914 prize.[8] This precedent was followed for the 1918 prize awarded to Fritz Haber in 1919,[9] the 1920 prize awarded to Walther Nernst in 1921,[10] the 1921 prize awarded to Frederick Soddy in 1922,[11] the 1925 prize awarded to Richard Zsigmondy in 1926,[12] the 1927 prize awarded to Heinrich Otto Wieland in 1928,[13] the 1938 prize awarded to Richard Kuhn in 1939,[14] the 1943 prize awarded to George de Hevesy in 1944,[15] and the 1944 prize awarded to Otto Hahn in 1945.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1910\".

They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one out of three laureates to be awarded the Nobel Prize twice in the same subject, in 1958 and 1980. John Bardeen, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956 and 1972, and Karl Barry Sharpless, who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2001 and 2022, are the others. Two others have won Nobel Prizes twice, one in chemistry and one in another subject: Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie (physics in 1903, chemistry in 1911) and Linus Pauling (chemistry in 1954, peace in 1962).[6] As of 2022, the prize has been awarded to 189 individuals, including eight women (Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie being the first to be awarded in 1911).[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020, Ioannidis et al. reported that half of the Nobel Prizes for science awarded between 1995 and 2017 were clustered in just a few disciplines within their broader fields. Atomic physics, particle physics, cell biology, and neuroscience dominated the two subjects outside chemistry, while molecular chemistry was the chief prize-winning discipline in its domain. Molecular chemists won 5.3% of all science Nobel Prizes during this period.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n* 1980\n* 1990\n* 2000\n* 2010\n* 2020\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n126. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2022\".

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896. These prizes are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, of the Netherlands. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[3] In 1901, van 't Hoff received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1938\".

There were also nine years for which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was delayed for one year. The Prize was not awarded in 1914, as the Nobel Committee for Chemistry decided that none of that year's nominations met the necessary criteria, but was awarded to Theodore William Richards in 1915 and counted as the 1914 prize.[8] This precedent was followed for the 1918 prize awarded to Fritz Haber in 1919,[9] the 1920 prize awarded to Walther Nernst in 1921,[10] the 1921 prize awarded to Frederick Soddy in 1922,[11] the 1925 prize awarded to Richard Zsigmondy in 1926,[12] the 1927 prize awarded to Heinrich Otto Wieland in 1928,[13] the 1938 prize awarded to Richard Kuhn in 1939,[14] the 1943 prize awarded to George de Hevesy in 1944,[15] and the 1944 prize awarded to Otto Hahn in 1945.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1969\".

Yonath** (Hebrew: \u05e2\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e0\u05ea, pronounced [\u02c8ada jo\u02c8nat]; born 22 June 1939)[1] is an Israeli chemist and Nobel laureate crystallographer best known for her pioneering work on the structure of ribosomes. She is the current director of the Helen and Milton A. Kimmelman Center for Biomolecular Structure and Assembly of the Weizmann Institute of Science.\n\n\nIn 2009, Yonath received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas A. Steitz for her studies on the structure and function of the ribosome, becoming the first Israeli woman to win the Nobel Prize out of ten Israeli Nobel laureates,[2] the first woman from the Middle East to win a Nobel prize in the sciences,[3] and the first woman in 45 years to win the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nAda Lifshitz (later Yonath)[5] was born in the Geula quarter of Jerusalem.[6] Her parents, Hillel and Esther Lifshitz, were Zionist Jews who immigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel) from Zdu\u0144ska Wola, Poland in 1933 before the establishment of Israel.[7] Her father was a rabbi and came from a rabbinical family. They settled in Jerusalem and ran a grocery, but found it difficult to make ends meet. They lived in cramped quarters with several other families, and Yonath remembers \"books\" being the only thing she had to keep her occupied.[8] Despite their poverty, her parents sent her to school in the upscale Beit HaKerem neighborhood to assure her a good education. When her father died at the age of 42, the family moved to Tel Aviv.[9]\n\n\nYonath was accepted to Tichon Hadash high school although her mother could not pay the tuition. She gave math lessons to students in return.[10] As a youngster, she says she was inspired by the Polish and naturalized-French scientist Marie Curie.[11] However, she stresses that Curie, whom she as a child was fascinated by after reading her biography, was not her \"role model\".[12] She returned to Jerusalem for college, graduating from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1962, and a master's degree in biochemistry in 1964. In 1968, she obtained her PhD from the Weizmann Institute of Science for X-ray crystallographic studies on the structure of collagen, with Wolfie Traub as her PhD advisor.[13][14][15]\n\n\nShe has one daughter, Hagit Yonath, a doctor at Sheba Medical Center, and a granddaughter, Noa.[16] She is the cousin of anti-occupation activist Ruchama Marton.[17]\n\n\n\n## Scientific career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ada Yonath at the Weizmann Institute of Science\nYonath accepted postdoctoral positions at Carnegie Mellon University (1969) and MIT (1970). While a postdoc at MIT she spent some time in the lab of subsequent 1976 chemistry Nobel Prize winner William N. Lipscomb, Jr. of Harvard University where she was inspired to pursue very large structures.[18]\n\n\nIn 1970, she established what was for nearly a decade the only protein crystallography laboratory in Israel. Then, from 1979 to 1984 she was a group leader with Heinz-G\u00fcnter Wittmann at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin. She was visiting professor at the University of Chicago in 1977\u201378.[19] She headed a Max-Planck Institute Research Unit at DESY in Hamburg, Germany (1986\u20132004) in parallel to her research activities at the Weizmann Institute.\n\n\nYonath focuses on the mechanisms underlying protein biosynthesis, by ribosomal crystallography, a research line she pioneered over twenty years ago despite considerable skepticism of the international scientific community.[20] Ribosomes translate RNA into protein and because they have slightly different structures in microbes, when compared to eukaryotes, such as human cells, they are often a target for antibiotics. In 2000 and 2001, she determined the complete high-resolution structures of both ribosomal subunits and discovered within the otherwise asymmetric ribosome, the universal symmetrical region that provides the framework and navigates the process of polypeptide polymerization. Consequently, she showed that the ribosome is a ribozyme that places its substrates in stereochemistry suitable for peptide bond formation and for substrate-mediated catalysis. In 1993 she visualized the path taken by the nascent proteins, namely the ribosomal tunnel, and recently revealed the dynamics elements enabling its involvement in elongation arrest, gating, intra-cellular regulation and nascent chain trafficking into their folding space.\n\n\nAdditionally, Yonath elucidated the modes of action of over twenty different antibiotics targeting the ribosome, illuminated mechanisms of drug resistance and synergism, deciphered the structural basis for antibiotic selectivity and showed how it plays a key role in clinical usefulness and therapeutic effectiveness, thus paving the way for structure-based drug design.\n\n\nFor enabling ribosomal crystallography Yonath introduced a novel technique, cryo bio-crystallography, which became routine in structural biology and allowed intricate projects otherwise considered formidable.[21]\n\n\nAt the Weizmann Institute, Yonath is the incumbent of the Martin S. and Helen Kimmel Professorial Chair.\n\n\n\n## Political Views[edit]\n\n\nShe has called for the unconditional release of all Hamas prisoners, saying that \"holding Palestinians captive encourages and perpetuates their motivation to harm Israel and its citizens ... once we don't have any prisoners to release they will have no reason to kidnap soldiers\".[22]\n\n\n\n## Awards and recognition[edit]\n\n\nTelephone interview with Ada Yonath during the announcement of the Nobel Prize\nYonath is a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences; the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities; the European Academy of Sciences and Art and the European Molecular Biology Organization. On Saturday, 18 October 2014, Professor Yonath was named an ordinary member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences by Pope Francis.[23]\n\n\nHer awards and honors include the following:\n\n\n\n* In 2002, Israel Prize\n* In 2002, Harvey Prize\n* In 2004, Massry Prize\n* In 2004, Paul Karrer Gold Medal\n* In 2005, Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize\n* In 2006, Wolf Prize in Chemistry along with George Feher.\n* In 2006, Rothschild Prize in Life Sciences.\n* In 2006, The EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture in Life Sciences, along with Professor Peretz Lavie (Medicine) and Professor Eli Keshet (Biology)\n* In 2007, Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize along with Harry Noller\n* In 2008, the Albert Einstein World Award of Science for her pioneering contributions to protein biosynthesis in the field of ribosomal crystallography and her introduction of innovative techniques in cryo bio-crystallography.[24]\n* In 2009, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (co-recipient with Thomas Steitz and Venkatraman Ramakrishnan).[25] She was the first Israeli woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize.[26]\n* In 2010, Wilhelm Exner Medal[27]\n* In 2011, Marie Curie Medal awarded by the Polish Chemical Society[28]\n* In 2013 she became a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.[29]\n* In 2015, she was awarded Honorary Doctorates from the De La Salle University, Manila/Philippines; the Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble/France; the Medical University of Lodz, Lodz/Poland; and the University of Warwick, UK.[30][31]\n* In 2018, she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University[32]\n* In 2020, she was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society[33]\n* In 2023, she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the Jagiellonian University.[34]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Women of Israel\n* History of RNA biology\n* List of Israel Prize recipients\n* List of female Nobel laureates\n* List of Israeli Nobel laureates\n* List of Jewish Nobel laureates\n* List of peace activists\n* List of RNA biologists\n* Timeline of women in science\n* Women in chemistry\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Israel Prize Official Site (in Hebrew) \u2013 Recipient's C.V.\"\n2. **^** Lappin, Yaakov (7 October 2009). \"Nobel Prize Winner 'Happy, Shocked'\". *Jerusalem Post*.

In spite of this, she made near perfect scores on standardized tests and was determined to attend Princeton University, the alma mater of her father. She applied as a mechanical engineering major and was accepted.[8] Arnold's motivation behind studying engineering, as stated in her Nobel Prize interview, was that \"[mechanical engineering] was the easiest option and the easiest way to get into Princeton University at the time and I never left\".[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArnold graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Princeton University, where she focused on solar energy research.[10] In addition to the courses required for her major, she took classes in economics, Russian, and Italian, and envisioned herself as becoming a diplomat or CEO, even considering getting an advanced degree in international affairs.[11] She took a year off from Princeton after her second year to travel to Italy and work in a factory that made nuclear reactor parts, then returned to complete her studies.[12] Back at Princeton, she began studying at its Center for Energy and Environmental Studies \u2013 a group of scientists and engineers, at the time led by Robert Socolow, working to develop sustainable energy sources, a topic that would become a focus of her later work.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArnold is the daughter of Josephine Inman (n\u00e9e Routheau) and nuclear physicist William Howard Arnold, and the granddaughter of Lieutenant General William Howard Arnold.[5] She has an older brother, Bill and younger brothers, Edward, David and Thomas. She grew up in the Pittsburgh suburb of Edgewood, and the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Shadyside and Squirrel Hill, graduating from the city's Taylor Allderdice High School in 1974.[6] As a high schooler, she hitchhiked to Washington, D.C., to protest the Vietnam War and lived on her own, working as a cocktail waitress at a local jazz club and a cab driver.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Chemical Eng, Caltech Faculty Page\n* Arnold Research Group\n* Video of Arnold talking about her work, from the National Science & Technology Medals Foundation\n* Frances Arnold on Nobelprize.org ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) including the Nobel Lecture December 8, 2018 *Innovation by Evolution: Bringing New Chemistry to Life*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. **^** \"2017 Raymond and Beverly Sackler Prize in Convergence Research\".

She showed that, whereas naturally evolved enzymes tend to function well at a narrow temperature range, enzymes could be produced using directed evolution that could function at both high and low temperatures.[26] In addition to improving the existing functions of natural enzymes, Arnold has designed enzymes that perform functions for which no previous specific enzyme existed, such as when she evolved cytochrome P450 to carry out cyclopropanation[32] and carbene and nitrene transfer reactions.[26][33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLaureates of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n |\n| --- |\n| 1901\u20131925 | * 1901: Jacobus van 't Hoff\n* 1902: Emil Fischer\n* 1903: Svante Arrhenius\n* 1904: William Ramsay\n* 1905: Adolf von Baeyer\n* 1906: Henri Moissan\n* 1907: Eduard Buchner\n* 1908: Ernest Rutherford\n* 1909: Wilhelm Ostwald\n* 1910: Otto Wallach\n* 1911: Marie Curie\n* 1912: Victor Grignard / Paul Sabatier\n* 1913: Alfred Werner\n* 1914: Theodore Richards\n* 1915: Richard Willst\u00e4tter\n* 1916\n* 1917\n* 1918: Fritz Haber\n* 1919\n* 1920: Walther Nernst\n* 1921: Frederick Soddy\n* 1922: Francis Aston\n* 1923: Fritz Pregl\n* 1924\n* 1925: Richard Zsigmondy\n | ![](image)\n |\n| 1926\u20131950 | * 1926: Theodor Svedberg\n* 1927: Heinrich Wieland\n* 1928: Adolf Windaus\n* 1929: Arthur Harden / Hans von Euler-Chelpin\n* 1930: Hans Fischer\n* 1931: Carl Bosch / Friedrich Bergius\n* 1932: Irving Langmuir\n* 1933\n* 1934: Harold Urey\n* 1935: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie / Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie\n* 1936: Peter Debye\n* 1937: Norman Haworth / Paul Karrer\n* 1938: Richard Kuhn\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican chemist, Nobel laureate (born 1956)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArnold has also used directed evolution to design highly specific and efficient enzymes that can be used as environmentally-friendly alternatives to some industrial chemical synthesis procedures.[26] She, and others using her methods, have engineered enzymes that can carry out synthesis reactions more quickly, with fewer by-products, and in some cases eliminating the need for hazardous heavy metals.[31]\n\n\nShe uses structure-guided protein recombination to combine parts of different proteins to form protein chimeras with unique functions. She developed computational methods, such as SCHEMA, to predict how the parts can be combined without disrupting their parental structure, so that the chimeras will fold properly, and then applies directed evolution to further mutate the chimeras to optimize their functions.[37][38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArnold applied directed evolution to the optimization of enzymes (although not the first person to do so, see e.g. Barry Hall[29]). In[26] her seminal work, published in 1993, she used the method to engineer a version of subtilisin E that was active in the organic solvent DMF, a highly unnatural environment.[30] She carried out the work using four sequential rounds of mutagenesis of the enzyme's gene, expressed by bacteria, through error-prone PCR. After each round she screened the enzymes for their ability to hydrolyze the milk protein casein in the presence of DMF by growing the bacteria on agar plates containing casein and DMF. The bacteria secreted the enzyme and, if it were functional, it would hydrolyze the casein and produce a visible halo. She selected the bacteria that had the biggest halos and isolated their DNA for further rounds of mutagenesis.[26] Using this method, she designed an enzyme that had 256 times more activity in DMF than the original.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Kerry Emanuel\n* Ben Feringa\n* Else Marie Friis\n* Regine Kahmann\n* Margaret Kivelson\n* Ramamoorthy Ramesh\n* Wendelin Werner\n* Ada Yonath\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * ISNI\n* VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * Norway\n* Germany\n* Israel\n* Belgium\n* United States\n* Latvia\n* Czech Republic\n* Korea\n* Netherlands\n* Poland\n |\n| Academics | * DBLP\n* Google Scholar\n* Mathematics Genealogy Project\n* ORCID\n* Scopus\n* zbMATH\n |\n| Other | * IdRef\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1939: Adolf Butenandt / Leopold Ru\u017ei\u010dka\n* 1940\n* 1941\n* 1942\n* 1943: George de Hevesy\n* 1944: Otto Hahn\n* 1945: Artturi Virtanen\n* 1946: James B.

Nature built her sense of curiosity and her desire to understand the underlying biological mechanisms of life.[10][11] This was coupled with the atmosphere of intellectual pursuit that her parents encouraged at home. Her father enjoyed reading about science and filled the home with many books on popular science.[10][11] When Doudna was in the sixth grade, he gave her a copy of James Watson's 1968 book on the discovery of the structure of DNA, *The Double Helix,* which was a major inspiration.[21] Doudna also developed her interest in science and mathematics in school.[10][21] Even though Doudna was told that \"Women don't go into science,\" she knew that she wanted to be a scientist no matter what. Nothing said to her made her doubt it, Doudna said, \"When someone tells me I can't do something and I know that I can, it just makes me more resolved to do it.\"[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDoudna's first marriage was in 1988 to a fellow graduate student at Harvard named Tom Griffin, but his interests were more broad and less focused on research than hers and they divorced a few years later. Griffin wanted to move to Boulder, Colorado, where Doudna was also interested in working with Thomas Cech.[60] As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado, Doudna met Jamie Cate, then a graduate student. They worked together on the project to crystallize and determine the structure of the Tetrahymena Group I intron P4-P6 catalytic region. Doudna brought Cate with her to Yale, and they married in Hawaii in 2000. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Awards for Jennifer Doudna\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nLaureates of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n |\n| --- |\n| 1901\u20131925 | * 1901: Jacobus van 't Hoff\n* 1902: Emil Fischer\n* 1903: Svante Arrhenius\n* 1904: William Ramsay\n* 1905: Adolf von Baeyer\n* 1906: Henri Moissan\n* 1907: Eduard Buchner\n* 1908: Ernest Rutherford\n* 1909: Wilhelm Ostwald\n* 1910: Otto Wallach\n* 1911: Marie Curie\n* 1912: Victor Grignard / Paul Sabatier\n* 1913: Alfred Werner\n* 1914: Theodore Richards\n* 1915: Richard Willst\u00e4tter\n* 1916\n* 1917\n* 1918: Fritz Haber\n* 1919\n* 1920: Walther Nernst\n* 1921: Frederick Soddy\n* 1922: Francis Aston\n* 1923: Fritz Pregl\n* 1924\n* 1925: Richard Zsigmondy\n | ![](image)\n |\n| 1926\u20131950 | * 1926: Theodor Svedberg\n* 1927: Heinrich Wieland\n* 1928: Adolf Windaus\n* 1929: Arthur Harden / Hans von Euler-Chelpin\n* 1930: Hans Fischer\n* 1931: Carl Bosch / Friedrich Bergius\n* 1932: Irving Langmuir\n* 1933\n* 1934: Harold Urey\n* 1935: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie / Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie\n* 1936: Peter Debye\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. **^** \"Jennifer Doudna To Receive 2018 Pearl Meister Greengard Prize\". *Rockefeller University*.

Doudna went to the lab of Thomas Cech at the University of Colorado Boulder to crystallize and determine the three-dimensional structure of a ribozyme for the first time, so ribozyme structure could be compared with that of Enzymes, the catalytic Proteins.[7] She started this project at the Cech lab in 1991 and finished it at Yale University in 1996.[14] Doudna joined Yale's Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry as an assistant professor in 1994.[5] \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nin 2011.[47] In September 2013, Doudna cofounded Editas Medicine with Zhang and others despite their legal battles, but she quit in June 2014; Charpentier then invited her to join CRISPR Therapeutics, but she declined following the \"divorce\"-like experience at Editas.[48] Doudna is also a cofounder of Caribou spin-off Intellia Therapeutics[49][50] and Scribe Therapeutics, which pioneered CasX, a more compact, next-generation Cas9 which can efficiently cut DNA.[51]\n\n\nIn 2017, she co-authored *A Crack in Creation: Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution*,[10] a rare case of the first-person account of a major scientific breakthrough, aimed at the general public.[52]\n\n\nIn addition to the CRISPR breakthrough, Doudna has discovered that the hepatitis C virus utilizes an unusual strategy to synthesize viral proteins.[53] This work could lead to new drugs to stop infections without causing harm to the tissues of the body.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeginning in March 2020, Doudna organized an effort to use CRISPR-based technologies to address the COVID-19 pandemic along with Dave Savage, Robert Tjian, and other colleagues at the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI), where they created a testing center.[57] This center processes more than 1,000 patient samples per day.[58] Mammoth Biosciences announced a peer-reviewed validation of a rapid, CRISPR-based point of need COVID-19 diagnostic which is faster and less expensive than qRT-PCR based tests.[59]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\"I have so much optimism about what CRISPR can do to help cure unaddressed genetic diseases and improve sustainable agriculture, but I'm also concerned that the benefits of the technology might not reach those who need it most if we're not thoughtful and deliberate about how we develop the technology,\" Doudna said.[22]\n\n\n\n### Mammoth Biosciences[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Doudna co-founded Mammoth Biosciences,[54] a San Francisco-based bioengineering tech startup. Initial funding raised $23\u00a0million,[55] with a series B round of funding in 2020 raising $45\u00a0million.[56] The business is focused on improving access to bio sensing tests which address \"challenges across healthcare, agriculture, environmental monitoring, biodefense, and more.\"[54]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 response[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2018: Frances Arnold / Gregory Winter / George Smith\n* 2019: John B.
