The franchise has also been based in Philadelphia, Oakland, and San Jose (during a renovation of its home arena). The team is a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Warriors joined the Basketball Association of America (BAA) as the Philadelphia Warriors in 1946 and won the first BAA championship title in the same year, under coach Edward Gottlieb. They joined the NBA following the BAA-NBL merger in 1949. The Warriors' record was 26–42 in their first NBA season, and they lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Syracuse Nationals.[1][2] Franklin Mieuli and the Diners Club put together a group of 40 local investors to move the Warriors to San Francisco before the 1962–63 NBA season, with Mieuli eventually buying all the shares of the franchise to keep the team from collapsing and to keep it in the area. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter playing several home games in Oakland from 1967 onward, the team moved to Oakland full-time for the 1971–72 NBA season and changed its name to the Golden State Warriors.[3][4][5]\n\n\nLed by Rick Barry, the Warriors were a formidable franchise during the middle 1970s, achieving winning records every season from 1971–72 to 1977–78, winning two division titles, and defeating the Washington Bullets in the 1975 NBA championship. However, after Barry departed at the end of the 1977–78 season, the Warriors failed to compete for a title for the next 35 seasons. Between 1978–79 and 2011–12, the Warriors only achieved winning records in eight seasons. The team also suffered the NBA’s fourth-longest postseason appearance drought in history, with no playoff appearances between 1994–95 and 2005–06; this mark trails only the Braves/Clippers between 1976–77 and 1990–91, the Timberwolves between 2004–05 and 2016–17, and the Kings from 2006–07 to 2021-22.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** \"1960–61 Philadelphia Warriors\". *basketball-reference.com*.

In the following season, the Warriors—boosted by over half a decade of skillful drafting—finished with the best record in NBA history; the team ended the 2015–16 season with a mark of 73–9, one win better than Michael Jordan’s 1995–96 Bulls. The Warriors reached the 2016 NBA Finals but were defeated by the Cavaliers in seven games. After adding Kevin Durant in the off-season, they won 67 games during the 2016–17 campaign. The Warriors set another NBA record by winning 207 games during the three-year period ending in 2017. In the 2017 NBA Finals, the Warriors faced the Cavaliers again and won the NBA title in five games. In 2018, meeting the Cavaliers in the finals for the fourth consecutive season, the Warriors swept the series, winning the final game 108–85. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Golden State Warriors** |\n| **1971–72** | 1971–72 | NBA\n | Western\n | 4th\n | Pacific\n | 2nd\n | 51\n | 31\n | .622\n | 18\n | Lost conference semifinals (Bucks) 4–1[23] |  | Al Attles\n |\n| **1972–73** | 1972–73 | NBA\n | Western\n | 4th\n | Pacific\n | 2nd\n | 47\n | 35\n | .573\n | 13\n | **Won** conference semifinals (Bucks) 4–2Lost conference finals (Lakers) 4–1[24] |  |\n| **1973–74** | 1973–74 | NBA\n | Western\n | 5th\n | Pacific\n | 2nd\n | 44\n | 38\n | .537\n | 3\n |  |  |\n| **1974–75** | 1974–75 | **NBA** | **Western** | 1st\n | **Pacific** | **1st** | 48\n | 34\n | .585\n | —\n | **Won** conference semifinals (SuperSonics) 4–2**Won** conference finals (Bulls) 4–3**Won NBA Finals** (Bullets) 4–0[25] | Rick Barry (FMVP)Jamaal Wilkes (ROY)Dick Vertlieb (EOY) |\n| **1975–76** | 1975–76 | NBA\n | Western\n | 1st\n | **Pacific** | **1st** | 59\n | 23\n | .720\n | —\n | **Won** conference semifinals (Pistons) 4–2Lost conference finals (Suns) 4–3[26] |  |\n| **1976–77** | 1976–77 | NBA\n | Western\n | 4th\n | Pacific\n | 3rd\n | 46\n | 36\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2019, the Warriors returned to the NBA Finals for the fifth consecutive time, however, the Cavaliers did not appear in this series. They became the second team in NBA history to reach the NBA Finals in five consecutive seasons. The Warriors faced off against the Toronto Raptors and they lost to them in six games.\n\n\nUpon injuries to backcourt duo Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson as well as Durant's sign-and-trade departure to the Brooklyn Nets, the Warriors struggled for the next two years, failing to qualify for the playoffs in either season. The team would return to familiar success after defeating the Boston Celtics in 6 games in the 2022 NBA Finals. Curry would win NBA Finals MVP, winning his fourth championship and popularly cementing his role as the face of the franchise's dynastic era. The following 2022 season would see difficulties in balancing veteran leadership and youthful development, producing criticisms from analysts and opponents in the Warriors' ability to continue their dominance.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Fell to 9th seed after losing to the Memphis Grizzlies in the NBA play-in tournament.[41]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\nGeneral\n* \"Golden State Warriors\". *basketball-reference.com*.

The win was Toronto's 48th of the season and 22nd on the road, both tying franchise records.[151] Four days later, the Raptors broke their franchise record with their 49th win of the season. After the 2014–15 season, Louis Williams won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award, becoming the first Raptor to do so. The Raptors faced the Washington Wizards in the first round of the 2015 playoffs and lost four straight games as the Wizards swept the Raptors.[152]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n145. **^** \"Raptors Acquire Vasquez, Salmons, Hayes & Patterson From Kings\". *www.nba.com*.

The Raptors entered the All-Star break with a 28–24 record, and DeRozan was also selected to play in the All-Star game, being only the fourth ever Raptor to do so. On March 28, 2014, the Raptors clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 2008 after beating the Boston Celtics, 105–103.[146] On April 11, 2014, the Raptors lost to the New York Knicks, 108–100, but since the division rival Brooklyn Nets lost to the Atlanta Hawks the same night, the Raptors became Atlantic Division champions for the first time since 2007.[147] They finished the regular season with a franchise-high 48 wins (.585), going 42–22 (.656) after the Gay trade, the third-best record in the Eastern Conference. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMiles, and a 2024 second-round draft pick to the Memphis Grizzlies for Marc Gasol—another multiple All-Star and former Defensive Player of the Year—and signed Jeremy Lin shortly thereafter.[169][170][171] The Raptors got off to a 6–0 start, a franchise record.[172] Winning their 16th game on November 23, the Raptors broke their franchise record for the best start through 20 games with a 16–4 record.[173] They reached the 20-win mark quicker than any time in their history when they won the 24th game of their season on December 1 against the Cleveland Cavaliers in Cleveland.[174] On January 13, 2019, the Toronto Raptors broke the record for most points scored in franchise history after beating the Washington Wizards in Washington 140–138 points after double overtime.[175]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n174. **^** Withers, Tom (December 2, 2018). \"Leonard leads Raptors to victory over Cavaliers in eighth straight win\". *Global News*.

However, the Raptors would lose to the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round in six games, after going down 0–3 to start the series.[195] Siakam was named to his second All-NBA Team, tying Vince Carter and Demar DeRozan for the most All-NBA selections in Raptors history. Scottie Barnes, whom the Raptors had selected fourth overall in the 2021 NBA draft, was named the 2022 NBA Rookie of the Year.[196][197]\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMasai was fined $25,000 by the NBA for the quote and later apologized for the excessive language.[253] The hard-fought series lasted seven games, and was decided in the final seconds when Paul Pierce blocked Kyle Lowry's shot giving the Nets the 104–103 victory. The two teams met again in the first round of 2020 NBA Playoffs, this time with the Raptors sweeping the Nets in four games in which was the first playoff series that the Raptors swept.[254][255]\n\n\n\n### New York Knicks[edit]\n\n\nThe New York Knicks and the Raptors are divisional rivals.[254][256] The Raptors made their first-ever playoff appearance during the 1999–2000 season, in which they were swept by the Knicks in the first round, 3–0. The following season, the Raptors redeemed themselves, defeating the Knicks in the first round 3–2; this effectively ended the Knicks' run as perennial NBA championship contenders, which began in the early 1990s.[257]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Basketball in Canada\n* Sports in Toronto\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2020, the Raptors went on a 15-game winning streak and set a new record for the longest winning streak by a Canadian-based professional sports franchise.[217]\n\n\n\n## Broadcasters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Toronto Raptors broadcasters\n\nRaptors games are primarily broadcast on television by Canadian sports channels TSN and Sportsnet, owned by Bell Media and Rogers Communications, respectively. Through MLSE, the Raptors also operate the Canadian version of NBA TV (formerly known as Raptors NBA TV), which airs reruns of Raptors telecasts along with other news and analysis programs focusing on the team and the rest of the NBA.[218] During the 2019 NBA Finals, for simultaneous substitution purposes, Citytv (for games aired by Sportsnet)[219] and CTV 2 (for games aired by TSN) aired the ABC feed.[220]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMasai Ujiri replaced Colangelo in 2013 and helped herald a new era of success, led by a backcourt duo of DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. The Raptors returned to the playoffs the following year and became a consistent playoff team in every year of Ujiri's tenure. Under Ujiri, the team also won five Division titles and registered their most successful regular season in 2018. However, the team's failure to reach the NBA Finals prompted Ujiri to fire head coach Dwane Casey after the 2018 playoffs concluded and to trade DeRozan for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green later that summer, as well as to acquire Marc Gasol before the trade deadline. Toronto also saw the breakout of Pascal Siakam, the 27th overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft, who won the NBA Most Improved Player that year. In the 2019 playoffs, the Raptors won their first Eastern Conference title and advanced to their first NBA Finals, where they won their first NBA championship.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2018, the Raptors, in partnership with Drake, announced the Welcome Toronto program. The program will see the Raptors and OVO contribute $2 million to Canada Basketball over the next four years. In addition, the Raptors and OVO also announced a donation of $1 million over the next three years in order to refurbish four community basketball courts within Toronto city limits. The four courts are located at Flemingdon Community Centre in the North York district in the north end of the city, Malvern Community Recreation Centre in the Scarborough district in the east end of the city, Matty Eckler Community Centre in the Riverdale neighbourhood of the Old Toronto district just to the east of downtown, and Thistletown Community Centre in the Etobicoke district in the west end of the city.[247][248]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nThe Toronto Raptors have a rivalry with both the New York Knicks and the Brooklyn Nets.\n\n\n\n### New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nets–Raptors rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter losing the first two games in Milwaukee, Toronto won the next four, advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history, and their opponents were the two-time defending champions Golden State Warriors.[178] The Warriors, which were making their fifth consecutive finals appearance and featured multiple All-Stars, including Splash Brothers Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, were favourites to win.[179] However, the Raptors earned their first championship by defeating the Warriors 4–2, with Leonard being named Finals MVP.[180] In doing so, the Raptors became the first non-American team to win the NBA title (and the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy) and the first non-American team to win a championship in any of the four major North American sports leagues since the Toronto Blue Jays won the World Series in 1993, ending a 25-year-long drought from Canada-based major professional sports teams.[181]\n\n\n\n#### 2019–2021: Pandemic-shortened seasons[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the Raptors won their first championship, Leonard left in free agency and Siakam became the face of the franchise.\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\nOn November 1, 1946, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, in what was the first game played in NBA history (as the Basketball Association of America). However, the Huskies folded after the initial 1946–47 season.[9] Toronto did not host another NBA game until the 1970s, when the Buffalo Braves (predecessor to the Los Angeles Clippers) played a total of 16 regular season games at Maple Leaf Gardens from 1971 to 1975.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the Toronto Raptors unveiled a new primary logo, which the team described as \"a circular shield with a ball torn by the unmistakable attack of a Raptor\".[198]\n\n\n\n#### Court art[edit]\n\n\nThe Toronto Raptors used various court art over the team's existence. For retro games, the Raptors used the Huskies logo, given that the Raptors are among the newest NBA teams. Beginning in early 2018, in some games, the Raptors use the Welcome Toronto logo, as the Raptors have strong connections with Toronto-based rapper Drake, as well as the 3D Raptors logo. Scotiabank subsidiary Tangerine Bank's name and logo are printed on the court as well (Tangerine Bank was formerly ING Direct Canada, until Scotiabank purchased the company in 2012 and re-branded it in 2013).\n\n\n\n### Uniforms[edit]\n\n\n#### Uniform evolution[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n230. **^** NBA Team Valuations, forbes.com, December 3, 2008, accessed December 6, 2008.\n231. **^** The Business of Basketball: Toronto Raptors, forbes.com, accessed May 4, 2016\n232. **^** NBA Team Valuations, forbes.com, accessed November 15, 2011.\n233. **^** NBA Team Valuations 2018, forbes.com, accessed February 7, 2018.\n234. **^** Dove, Abigail (February 8, 2021). \"Meet the Raptor, Toronto's Fun-Loving Mascot\". *Si Kids: Sports News for Kids, Kids Games and More*.

Founded in 1946 as a charter member of the Basketball Association of America, the Celtics then moved into the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1949, as said league was formed by the merger of the BAA and the National Basketball League. Currently playing in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference, the Celtics are tied with the Lakers with the most NBA titles with 17 championships. Eleven of those occurred between 1957 and 1969, with a dynasty led by center Bill Russell and coach/general manager Red Auerbach. The Celtics won two more titles in the 1970s under coach Tom Heinsohn, and three more in the 1980s under the leadership of forward Larry Bird. After a 22-year drought, the Celtics got their latest title in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n## 1946–1956: Building the dynasty[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBoston Celtics seasons\n |\n| --- |\n| * Franchise\n* History\n* Seasons\n |\n| 1940s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 1946–47 | 1947–48 | 1948–49 |\n |\n| 1950s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1949–50 | 1950–51 | 1951–52 | 1952–53 | 1953–54 | 1954–55 | 1955–56 | **1956–57** | 1957–58 | **1958–59** |\n |\n| 1960s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **1959–60** | **1960–61** | **1961–62** | **1962–63** | **1963–64** | **1964–65** | **1965–66** | 1966–67 | **1967–68** | **1968–69** |\n |\n| 1970s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1969–70 | 1970–71 | 1971–72 | 1972–73 | **1973–74** | 1974–75 | **1975–76** | 1976–77 | 1977–78 | 1978–79 |\n |\n| 1980s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSports team history\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

On February 21, the Celtics traded Leandro Barbosa and center Jason Collins for Washington Wizards guard Jordan Crawford. On February 28 and March 21, respectively, the Celtics signed forwards D. J. White and Shavlik Randolph.[66][67]\n\n\nThe Celtics finished the season with 41 wins, but played only 81 games after a home game against the Indiana Pacers on April 16 was cancelled following the Boston Marathon bombing; the game was not made up with both teams already assured of their playoff positions.[68] The 41 wins were the lowest totals the Celtics achieved as a playoff-bound team since 2004. The Celtics trailed 3–0 to the New York Knicks in the first round of the 2013 NBA Playoffs, before losing the series in six games. In Game 6, the Celtics nearly completed a comeback when they went on a 20–0 run to cut the lead to 4, but that was the closest they got as the New York Knicks would take over to win.[69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Celtics, however, continued to struggle, at one point posting a five-game losing streak that was the longest in the 'Big Three' era. At the All Star break, the Celtics were below .500 with a 15–17 record. However, they were one of the hottest teams after the break, going 24–10 the rest of the year and winning their 5th division title in a row. The Celtics would end up making the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference in the 2012 NBA Playoffs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Celtics Related Books\". *NBA.com*.

But the season ended in disappointment, as they were upset in 7 games by the New York Knicks in the Conference Finals and became the team with the best record ever to have failed to make the Finals.[21] The Celtics returned to the playoffs the next year, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA Finals in 1974 for their 12th NBA Championship.[22] The teams split the first four games, and after the Celtics won Game 5 in Milwaukee they headed back to Boston leading three games to two, with a chance to claim the title on their home court. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** \"NBA.com: All-Time Finals Challenge: 1981 Celtics\". *www.nba.com*.

Their record guaranteed them home court advantage for the entire playoffs. The 2008 NBA Playoffs, however, were bumpier than many believed they should be. Their First round series was against the eighth-seeded Atlanta Hawks. At home, the Celtics were dominant: their lowest home margin of victory against the Hawks in the playoffs was 19, in Game 2. However, the Hawks were able to beat the Celtics in Atlanta. The series went seven games, with the home team winning each game. The second round against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers also went to seven games, with each match won by the home team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Celtics during the tip-off game of the 2008–09 season.

Unfortunately, it was announced just before the playoffs that Garnett would miss the entire post-season. In the first round of the 2009 NBA Playoffs, the team faced the seventh seed Chicago Bulls. Although the Celtics were favored, the Bulls surprised them with overtime wins in games 1 and 4. Thanks to Ray Allen and Paul Pierce, Boston had a 3–2 advantage going back to Chicago. In game six, though Ray Allen scored 51 points, the Bulls would win in a dramatic triple-overtime victory thanks to John Salmons, Ben Gordon and eventual NBA Rookie of the Year Derrick Rose. The Celtics, however would ultimately prevail in game 7.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGreen became the second Celtic, joining Dee Brown, to capture the Slam Dunk Contest during All-Star Weekend.\n\n\nOn February 22, 2007, former Celtic Dennis Johnson died at the age of 52. Johnson had been coaching the franchise's NBDL affiliate in Austin, Texas at the time of his death. Johnson was honored at the very next Celtics game, even though it was against the Lakers in Los Angeles. The Celtics also held a special ceremony for him at the Garden on February 28, 2007, before a game against the New York Knicks.\n\n\nOne bright spot of the season happened on St. Patrick's Day against the eventual champions San Antonio Spurs. The Celtics beat the Spurs 91–85, ending the 17-year away drought at San Antonio, as well as the 10-year drought against the Spurs (Boston's first victory against Tim Duncan).\n\n\nOn April 18, the team promoted COO Rich Gotham to President.\n\n\n\n## 2007–present: Back to relevance[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2007–08 Boston Celtics season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIndicating the bumpy the playoffs were for the Celtics, they had to play 26 playoff games, the most a team had ever endured in a single postseason, surpassing the 1994 New York Knicks, whom Celtics Coach Doc Rivers played for, and the 2005 Detroit Pistons, each of whom played 25, but lost their respective finals in seven games (Knicks in 1994, Pistons in 2005).

Pierce scored 46 points in the series-clinching blowout at the Fleet Center. In the conference semifinals the Celtics defeated the favored Detroit Pistons 4 games to 1 in a series best remembered for the Celtics low-scoring (66–64) game 3 victory. In their first trip to the Eastern Conference Finals since 1988, the Celtics would jump out to a 2–1 series lead over the New Jersey Nets (after rallying from 21 points down in the fourth quarter to win game 3) but would lose the next three games to fall 4 games to 2.\n\n\nFollowing their defeat at the hands of the Nets, the Celtics once again overhauled their roster. Gone were Rodney Rogers, who signed with new rival New Jersey as a free agent, Vitaly Potapenko, Kenny Anderson and Joe Forte, who were sent to Seattle in a five-player trade that brought Vin Baker and Shammond Williams to Boston.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Celtics entered the 2001–02 season with low expectations. The team's success in the latter stages of 2000–01 was largely forgotten, and critics were surprised when the team (along with the New Jersey Nets) surged to the top of the Atlantic Division ahead of teams like the Philadelphia 76ers, who were fresh off a trip to the NBA Finals. A trade at the February trade deadline sent Joe Johnson, who was having an inconsistent rookie season, along with little-used bench players Randy Brown and Milt Palacio to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Tony Delk and Rodney Rogers. The season salvaged by the trade, the Celtics went on to win 49 games. The 49 victories were the franchises most since 1992, when Larry Bird was still playing, and the Celtics made the playoffs for the first time since 1995.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Celtics went 62–20 under coach Bill Fitch in 1980–81, despite losing center Dave Cowens to retirement late in training camp. Once again the Celtics matched up with the 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Celtics fell behind 3 games to 1 before coming back to win a classic 7th game, 91–90. The Celtics went on to capture the 1981 NBA Championship over the Houston Rockets, just two years after Bird had been drafted. Maxwell was named NBA Finals MVP.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1983–84 the Celtics would go 62–20 and finally get back to the NBA Finals after a three-year hiatus. In the final, the Celtics came back from a 2–1 deficit to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers, winning their 15th championship. Bird renewed his college rivalry with Lakers star Magic Johnson during this series. After the series the Celtics traded Henderson, whose dramatic steal in game 2 altered the course of the series and gave the Celtics a chance, to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for their first-round pick in the 1986 NBA draft.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite being the dominant team of the late '50s and most of the 1960s, the Celtics were never a big draw averaging only around 8,500 fans per game. The only times they averaged 10,000 fans per game was in the 1956-57 (Bill Russell's rookie season; 10,517) and the 1966-67 (Russell's first year as player-coach; 10,409) seasons. In contrast, the Celtics fellow tenants of Boston Garden, the Boston Bruins, drew on average around 12,000 fans per game despite being a losing team for the majority of that era.\n\n\n\n## 1970–1978: Rebuilding the dynasty[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the second round, Boston faced the Orlando Magic in a series that would also go to seven games. However, aided by Hedo Türkoğlu's 25 points, the Magic would defeat the Celtics in Boston 101–82, ending their bid for a second straight title.\n\n\nPrior to the 2009–10 NBA Season, Boston signed Rasheed Wallace. Wallace had had a major impact in his 5+1⁄2 seasons with the Detroit Pistons, where he had won the 2004 NBA Championship. They won the Atlantic Division with a record of 50–32, then beat Miami 4–1 in the playoffs, followed by the Cavaliers 4–2. After a 4–2 series over the Magic in the ECF, the Celtics once again contested the Finals with the Lakers, but fell to them 4–3, with games 1, 2, 6, and 7 played in Los Angeles.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRussell joined the Celtics in December 1956[7] and went on to play most every game during which the Celtics advanced to the NBA Finals and defeated the St. Louis Hawks in seven games, giving the Celtics the first of their record 17 NBA Championships.[8] In 1958, the Celtics again advanced to the NBA Finals, this time losing to the Hawks in 6 games.[9] However, with the acquisition of K.C. Jones that year, the Celtics began a dynasty that would last for more than a decade.[10] In 1959, with Cousy at point guard, Russell at center and Heinsohn at forward, the Celtics won the NBA Championship after sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers.[11] Still coached by Auerbach, the Celtics won seven more consecutive championships, extending their streak to eight in a row.[12] During that timespan, the Celtics met the Lakers in the Finals six times, starting an intense and often bitter rivalry. In 1964, Auerbach made the Celtics the first team to have an all African American starting lineup.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe next season, Boston took the league by storm. They had a hot start, led by Isaiah Thomas. He truly emerged as a star, and with the help of Boston's excellent depth, Boston finished as the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference, with a 53–29 record. Just before the Celtics' first round playoff series against the Chicago Bulls, Thomas' sister Chyna died in a car crash. That led to Thomas being even more dominant, and Boston took the series in six after losing the first two games. That series win was the first since 2012. In the second round, Boston faced the Washington Wizards. Thomas dropped 33 and 53 points on them in Games 1 and 2, respectively. Boston took the series in 7. In the Eastern Conference Finals, Boston faced the Cleveland Cavaliers. Thomas got a hip injury and was ruled out for the season, and the Cavs won the series in five.\n\n\n\n### 2021-present: Under Ime Udoka and NBA Finals appearance[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Celtics were a young team under new coach Doc Rivers, yet they seemed to have a core of good young players, led by rookie Al Jefferson, to go along with a selection of able veterans (Paul Pierce, a now-healthy Raef LaFrentz, and Ricky Davis). Before the trading deadline in the winter of 2005 the Celtics re-acquired Antoine Walker when they dealt Gary Payton to the Atlanta Hawks (Payton would re-sign with the team after being released from the Hawks a week later). With Walker back in the fold, the Celtics improved enormously. The Celtics went 45–37 and won their first Atlantic Division title since 1991–92. The Pacers defeated them in the first round yet again, with the series culminating in an embarrassing 27 point 7th game loss at the Fleet Center.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, the Celtics did not give up. Led by a bench that outscored the Lakers bench by 20 points, they fought back. The Celtics locked up their defense and took over Game 4 with a crushing 97–91 victory, the biggest comeback in NBA Finals history. Although the Lakers took Game 5, 103–98, the series went back to Boston for Game 6, and the Celtics finished it off with a dominating 131–92 victory. This game would mark the largest margin of victory for a clinching finals game in NBA history. The \"Boston Three Party\", as Garnett, Allen and NBA Finals MVP Paul Pierce became known, had finally brought a 17th banner to Boston, the first new banner for the new Garden and the first such win in 22 years. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1985, the Lakers and Celtics would meet again, but this time the Lakers would take the championship. During the following offseason the Celtics acquired Bill Walton from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Cedric Maxwell. Walton was a star with the Portland Trail Blazers, but injuries had kept him from living up to expectations. He was also a lifelong Celtics fan and willing to come off the bench, deferring to the three big men already with the team. Walton would be a big part of the Celtics' success in 1986.\n\n\nIn 1985–86 the Celtics fielded one of the best teams in NBA history. The 1986 Celtics won 67 games, going 40–1 at their home, the Boston Garden. Bird won his third consecutive MVP award after having arguably his finest season, and Walton won the Sixth Man of the Year Award. They would win their 16th championship, easily defeating the Houston Rockets in the NBA Finals.\n\n\n\n### Drafting of Len Bias, his death and aftermath[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the playoffs, the Celtics faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round, beating them in six games led by strong play from Pierce and Garnett. In the Conference Semifinals the Celtics faced the Philadelphia 76ers led by Doug Collins and a young group of promising players that would push the Celtics into a full-seven game series. Following a Game 7 85–75 win the Celtics faced the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, who had defeated them in the playoffs the previous year. After losing Game 1 93–79, Boston fought back, pushing Miami into a Game 2 overtime, but ultimately fell short losing 115–111. Facing a 0–2 deficit heading back to Boston, the Celtics would come back with a strong 101–91 Game 3 win and then a hard-fought 93–91 Game 4 overtime win, with Dwyane Wade missing a potential game-winning three-point shot at the buzzer. The C's then won Game 5 in Miami 94–90, giving them a chance to take the series back at the Garden. The Celtics could not close out the series, however. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n39. **^** Celtics, Boston. \"Boston Celtics History - Celtics.com - The official website of the Boston Celtics\". *www.nba.com*.

Before 2007 closed, Brandon Wallace was released in order to have even more roster flexibility, bringing the roster down to the league minimum of 13 players.[58] During the 2008 NBA All-Star Weekend, Allen and Pierce invited resting center P. J. Brown to join the Celtics, and Brown eventually signed with the team on February 28.[59][60][61] The final roster move occurred on March 4, as guard free agent Sam Cassell signed with the Celtics,[62] even if his debut was delayed due to attending a family funeral on his hometown of Baltimore.[63][64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics faced Chauncey Billups, Richard Hamilton and the Detroit Pistons. In Game 2, the Celtics finally lost at home, and rumors began to fly that the Celtics had gotten too tired from consecutive seven-game series to pull off a title, especially with the Pistons having taken their first two series in six and five games, respectively. But the Celtics bounced back to win Game 3 on the road in Detroit. The series continued, and the Celtics took down the Pistons in six games, winning the deciding game on the road.\n\n\nThe 2008 NBA Finals were contested with Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom and a Los Angeles Lakers team in the middle of a dominant playoff run. They swept the Denver Nuggets in the first round, took the Utah Jazz in the second round in six games, and extinguished the repeat hopes of the defending-champion San Antonio Spurs in five games in the Western Conference Finals.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2010 off-season saw the Celtics make the controversial move of signing veteran center Shaquille O'Neal for the veteran minimum salary, as he added still more age to a roster with most of its players over 30. They won the division again with a 56–26 record and acquired the No. 3 playoff seed. After sweeping the Knicks 4–0, they faced the now LeBron James-led Miami Heat, but the age of the Celtics' roster finally caught up with them as Miami won the series 4–1. O'Neal, who had been injured much of the season, retired shortly afterwards.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, the Bucks won Game 6 when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar nestled in a hook shot with three seconds left in the game's second overtime, and the series returned to Milwaukee. But Cowens was the hero in Game 7, scoring 28 points, as the Celtics brought the title back to Boston for the first time in five years. In 1976, the team won yet another championship, defeating the Phoenix Suns in 6 games. The Celtics advanced to the 1976 NBA Finals, which featured one of the greatest games in the history of the NBA. With the series tied at two games apiece, the Suns trailed early in the Boston Garden, but came back to force overtime. In double overtime, a Gar Heard turn-around jumper at the top of the key sent the game to a third overtime, at which point the Celtics prevailed.[23] Tommy Heinsohn coached the team for those two championships. After the 1976 championship and a playoff appearance in 1977, Boston went into another phase of rebuilding.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the 1966 championship, Auerbach retired as coach and Russell took over as player-coach.[14] With his appointment, Russell also became the first African American coach in any sport.[15] Auerbach would remain the general manager, a position he would hold well into the 1980s. However, that year the Celtics' string of NBA titles was broken as they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals. The aging team managed two more championships in 1968 and 1969, defeating the Lakers each time in the NBA Finals.[16] Russell retired after the 1969 season, effectively ending a dominant Celtics dynasty that had garnered 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons.[17] The streak of 8 consecutive NBA championships is the longest streak of consecutive championships in U.S. professional sports history.[18] Other important players during this era included Sam Jones, John Havlicek, Bill Sharman, Frank Ramsey, and Satch Sanders.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 2006–07 season was a gloomy one for the franchise. The season began with the death of Red Auerbach at the age of 89. Auerbach was one of the few remaining people who had been a part of the NBA since its inception in 1946. The Celtics went 2–22 from late December 2006 through early February 2007 after losing Paul Pierce to injury, the result of a stress reaction in his left foot (he would later miss the latter part of March and all of April because of swelling in his left elbow). At first, the Celtics received a much needed boost from guard Tony Allen but he tore his ACL on a dunk attempt in a game vs. the Indiana Pacers on January 10, 2007. The Celtics recorded a record of 24–58, second-worst in the NBA, including a franchise record 18-game losing streak that lasted from January 5 to February 14. As the streak grew, some suggested that Pierce sit out the rest of the season to the let the young players such as Al Jefferson, Gerald Green, Rajon Rondo and Delonte West get more experience. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first few games of the series started with the Celtics once again dominating at the TD Banknorth Garden, the Celtics home turf. Game 1 saw Paul Pierce come back after apparently suffering a knee injury earlier in the game, and taking over the game for a 98–88 Celtics win. But in Game 2, Boston nearly lost a 20-point lead, ultimately winning, 97–91. Squandered leads would later become the story of the series. When the Lakers returned to Staples Center and won Game 3, 87–81, then took a 24-point lead in the second quarter of Game 4, some believed momentum in the series had shifted the Lakers' way.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Larry Bird got the Celtics to five finals and three championships in the 1980s.\nThanks to a trade and their poor record in 1977–78, the Celtics owned two of the top eight picks in the 1978 NBA draft.[26] Since the Celtics had two draft choices, Auerbach took a risk and selected junior Larry Bird of Indiana State with the 6th pick, knowing that Bird would elect to remain in college for his senior year. The Celtics would retain his rights for one year, a rule that was later changed, and Auerbach believed that Bird's potential would make him worth the wait. Auerbach also felt that when the college season ended the Celtics would have a great chance to sign Bird. Auerbach was right and Bird signed soon after leading Indiana State to the NCAA Championship game, where they fell to a Michigan State University team that was led by Magic Johnson.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_lv7RNOanU3AkGTk2FbOArv9v","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
