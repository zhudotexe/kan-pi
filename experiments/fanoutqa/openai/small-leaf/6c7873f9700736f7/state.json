The Treaty of Union between the Kingdom of England (which included Wales) and the Kingdom of Scotland in 1707 resulted in their unification to become the Kingdom of Great Britain. Its union in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Most of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922, leaving the present United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which formally adopted its name in 1927.[m] The nearby Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey are not part of the UK, being Crown Dependencies, but the British government is responsible for their defence and international representation.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe agriculture industry is intensive, highly mechanised and efficient by European standards, producing about 60 per cent of food needs with less than 1.6 per cent of the labour force (535,000 workers).[267] Around two-thirds of production is devoted to livestock, one-third to arable crops. The UK retains a significant, though much reduced fishing industry. It is also rich in a variety of natural resources including coal, petroleum, natural gas, tin, limestone, iron ore, salt, clay, chalk, gypsum, lead, silica and an abundance of arable land.[268]\n\n\nThe United Kingdom has among the highest levels of income inequality in Europe[269] and the OECD,[270] and is one of the most regionally unequal high-income countries in the world.[271][272]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Science and technology in the United Kingdom and Telecommunications in the United Kingdom\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough the United Kingdom is a sovereign country, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also widely referred to as countries.[37] The UK Prime Minister's website has used the phrase \"countries within a country\" to describe the United Kingdom.[16] Some statistical summaries, such as those for the twelve NUTS 1 regions refer to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as \"regions\".[38] Northern Ireland is also referred to as a \"province\".[39] With regard to Northern Ireland, the descriptive name used \"can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences\".[40]\n\n\nThe term \"Great Britain\" conventionally refers to the island of Great Britain, or politically to England, Scotland and Wales in combination.[41] It is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the United Kingdom as a whole.[42] The word *England* is occasionally used incorrectly to refer to the United Kingdom as a whole, a mistake principally made by people from outside the UK.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** \"This category could include Polish responses from the country specific question for Scotland which would have been outputted to 'Other White' and then included under 'White' for UK. 'White Africans' may also have been recorded under 'Other White' and then included under 'White' for UK.\"\n4. **^** 83.6% are White British/Irish.\n5. **^** Although the United Kingdom has traditionally been seen as a unitary state, an alternative description of the UK as a \"union state\", put forward by, among others, Vernon Bogdanor,[4] has become increasingly influential since the adoption of devolution in the 1990s.[5] A union state is considered to differ from a unitary state in that while it maintains a central authority it also recognises the authority of historic rights and infrastructures of its component parts.[6]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccess to improved water supply and sanitation in the UK is universal. It is estimated that 96 per cent of households are connected to the sewer network.[308] According to the Environment Agency, total water abstraction for public water supply in the UK was 16,406 megalitres per day in 2007.[309]\n\n\nIn England and Wales water and sewerage services are provided by 10 private regional water and sewerage companies and 13 mostly smaller private \"water only\" companies. In Scotland, water and sewerage services are provided by a single public company, Scottish Water. In Northern Ireland water and sewerage services are also provided by a single public entity, Northern Ireland Water.[310]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demography of the United Kingdom, British people, and Ceremonial counties of England\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy.[n][25] The capital and largest city of the United Kingdom (as well as the capital of England) is London. The cities of Edinburgh, Cardiff, and Belfast are respectively the national capitals of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Other major cities include Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, and Leeds.[26] The UK consists of three distinct legal jurisdictions: England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. This is due to these areas retaining their existing legal systems even after joining the UK.[27] Since 1998, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland also have their own devolved governments and legislatures, each with varying powers.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe UK was ranked fourth in the Global Innovation Index 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, which is based on around 80 indicators, including measures of the political environment, education, infrastructure and knowledge creation.[280][273] During 2022, the UK produced 6.3 per cent of the world's scientific research papers and had a 10.5 per cent share of scientific citations, the third highest in the world (for both). The UK ranked 1st in the world for Field-Weighted Citation Impact.[281] Scientific journals produced in the UK include publications by the *Royal Society*, *Nature*, the *British Medical Journal* and *The Lancet*.[282]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in the United Kingdom\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Cannabis\n* Crime\n* Demography\n* Drug policy\n* Education\n* Environmental inequality\n* Environmental issues\n* Ethnic groups\n* Health\n* Homelessness\n\t+ England\n\t+ Scotland\n* Housing\n* Hunger\n* Immigration\n* Innovation\n* Languages\n* Life expectancy\n* Mental health\n* Poverty\n* Prostitution\n* Public holidays\n* Racism\n* Social care\n* Social class\n* Suicide\n* Universal basic income (UBI)\n* Water supply and sanitation\n* Waste\n* Welfare state\n |\n| Culture | * Art\n* Anthem\n* Cinema\n* Cuisine\n\t+ Wine\n* Identity\n* Literature\n* Media\n* Music\n* Religion\n* Sport\n* Symbols\n* Theatre\n* Stereotypes of the British\n* World Heritage Sites\n* Anglosphere\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Countries of the United Kingdom\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\nAccording to sources which include the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute and the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the UK has either the fourth- or the fifth-highest military expenditure.

It is bordered by the North Sea in the north, the English Channel in the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean sea in the southeast. Its land borders consist of Belgium and Luxembourg in the northeast, Germany and Switzerland in the east, Italy and Monaco in the southeast, and Andorra and Spain in the south and southwest. Except for the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south and southeast, the Pyrenees and the Alps and the Jura, respectively, and to the east, the Rhine river. Due to its shape, France is often referred to as **l'Hexagone** (\"The Hexagon\"). Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is Corsica. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Population density in France by arrondissement\nWith an estimated January 2023 population of 68,042,591 people,[8] France is the 20th most populous country in the world, the third-most populous in Europe (after Russia and Germany), and the second most populous in the European Union (after Germany).\n\n\nFrance is an outlier among developed countries, particularly in Europe, for its relatively high rate of natural population growth: By birth rates alone, it was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the European Union in 2006.[239] Between 2006 and 2016, France saw the second-highest overall increase in population in the EU and was one of only four EU countries where natural births accounted for the most population growth.[240] This was the highest rate since the end of the baby boom in 1973 and coincides with the rise of the total fertility rate from a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**France** (French: [f\u0281\u0251\u0303s] \u24d8), officially the **French Republic** (French: *R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise* [\u0281epyblik f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b\u02d0z]),[14] is a country located primarily in Western Europe. It also includes overseas regions and territories in the Americas and the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans,[XII] giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zones in the world. Metropolitan France shares borders with Belgium and Luxembourg to the north, Germany to the north east, Switzerland to the east, Italy and Monaco to the south east, Andorra and Spain to the south, and a maritime border with the United Kingdom to the north west. Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea; overseas territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nForests account for 31 per cent of France's land area\u2014the fourth-highest proportion in Europe\u2014representing an increase of 7 per cent since 1990.[104][105][106] French forests are some of the most diverse in Europe, comprising more than 140 species of trees.[107] France had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.52/10, ranking it 123rd globally out of 172 countries.[108] There are nine national parks[109] and 46 natural parks in France,[110] with the government planning to convert 20% of its exclusive economic zone into a Marine protected area by 2020.[111] A regional nature park[112] (French: *parc naturel r\u00e9gional* or PNR) is a public establishment in France between local authorities and the national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty, to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development in the area.[113] A PNR sets goals and guidelines for managed human habitation, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMetropolitan France has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes. Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, during which the Armorican Massif, the Massif Central, the Morvan, the Vosges and Ardennes ranges and the island of Corsica were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north, the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of Beauce and Brie. Various routes of natural passage, such as the Rh\u00f4ne Valley, allow easy communication. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. At 4,810.45 metres (15,782\u00a0ft)[89] above sea level, Mont Blanc, located in the Alps on the French and Italian border, is the highest point in Western Europe. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe coastlines offer contrasting landscapes: mountain ranges along the French Riviera, coastal cliffs such as the C\u00f4te d'Alb\u00e2tre, and wide sandy plains in the Languedoc. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast. France has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, the Rh\u00f4ne and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory. The Rh\u00f4ne divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Camargue. The Garonne meets the Dordogne just after Bordeaux, forming the Gironde estuary, the largest estuary in Western Europe which after approximately 100 kilometres (62\u00a0mi) empties into the Atlantic Ocean.[90] Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the northeastern borders. France has 11\u00a0million square kilometres (4.2\u00d710~~^~~6\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97% are overseas.\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n115. **^** \"D\u00e9couvrir les 54 Parcs\". *F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Parcs naturels r\u00e9gionaux de France*.

However, due to the harshness of its environment, about 13.1% of its land is agricultural,[10] and only 7.4% of its land is arable.[399] The country's agricultural land is considered part of the \"breadbasket\" of Europe.[400] More than one-third of the sown area is devoted to fodder crops, and the remaining farmland is devoted to industrial crops, vegetables, and fruits.[398] The main product of Russian farming has always been grain, which occupies considerably more than half of the cropland.[398] Russia is the world's largest exporter of wheat,[401][402] the largest producer of barley and buckwheat, among the largest exporters of maize and sunflower oil, and the leading producer of fertilizer.[403]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Yugyd Va National Park in the Komi Republic is the largest national park in Europe.[225]\nRussia, owing to its gigantic size, has diverse ecosystems, including polar deserts, tundra, forest tundra, taiga, mixed and broadleaf forest, forest steppe, steppe, semi-desert, and subtropics.[240] About half of Russia's territory is forested,[10] and it has the world's largest area of forest,[241] which sequester some of the world's highest amounts of carbon dioxide.[241][242]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)K\u00f6ppen climate classification of Russia\nThe size of Russia and the remoteness of many of its areas from the sea result in the dominance of the humid continental climate throughout most of the country, except for the tundra and the extreme southwest.

The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, respectively, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500\u00a0km (9,000\u00a0mi) long and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East China and South China seas.

China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast territory. In the east, along the shores of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains, while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad grasslands predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the deltas of China's two major rivers, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Other major rivers include the Xi, Mekong, Brahmaputra and Amur. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas.

This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA *World Factbook* and its previous iterations against the information for United States in *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica*, particularly its footnote section.[13] In sum, according to older versions of the CIA *World Factbook* (from 1982 to 1996), the U.S. was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of 9,372,610\u00a0km2 (3,618,780\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). However, in the 1997 edition, the U.S. added coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to 9,629,091\u00a0km2 (3,717,813\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)). And then again in 2007, U.S. added territorial water to its total area (increasing it to 9,833,517\u00a0km2 (3,796,742\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)). During this time, China's total area remained unchanged. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n481. **^** Lilly, Amanda (7 July 2009). \"A Guide to China's Ethnic Groups\". *The Washington Post*.
