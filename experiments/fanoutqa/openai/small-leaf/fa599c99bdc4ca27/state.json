The incumbent deputy prime ministers are Heng Swee Keat and Lawrence Wong, who took office on 1 May 2019 and 13 June 2022 respectively.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe deputy prime minister is the second highest post, and is a senior Cabinet minister in Singapore. Since the mid-1980s, Singapore has had two deputy prime ministers at a time. The holder will sometimes assume the role of acting prime minister when the prime minister is temporarily absent from Singapore.\n\n\nThe office of Deputy Prime Minister dates back to 1959 and it was first appointed by the *Yang di-Pertuan Negara*, when Singapore attained self-governance from the British Empire. \n\n\nThe title of Deputy Prime Minister remained unchanged after the merger with the Federation of Malaya, Sarawak and North Borneo to form Malaysia, while Singapore was a federated state of Malaysia between 1963 and 1965. Toh Chin Chye was the first deputy prime minister of Singapore between 1959 and 1968.\n\n\nHeng Swee Keat was appointed as Minister of Finance and soon after assumed the office as Deputy Prime Minister on 1 May 2019. Both Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam relinquished their positions. Heng Swee Keat was widely believed to be poised to succeed Lee Hsien Loong as the next prime minister following his appointment as Deputy Prime Minister in May 2019. \n\n\nHeng subsequently withdrew himself from the nomination in April 2021 citing age and health reasons and relinquished his finance portfolio.[1][2]\n\n\nLawrence Wong assumed the office as Deputy Prime Minister on 13 June 2022, serving alongside Heng Swee Keat after being appointed as Minister of Finance.

He continued to hold his Cabinet appointments as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance after the election.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBorn in a Chinese Singaporean family of Teochew descent, Heng was educated at Raffles Institution before graduating from Christ College at the University of Cambridge in 1983 with a Bachelor of Arts with honours (later promoted to Master of Arts by seniority) degree in economics[1] after being conferred an overseas scholarship from the Singapore Police Force (SPF) in 1980.[4]\n\n\nHe returned to the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and served in various roles,[5] including a five-year stint in the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), before leaving in 1997 with the rank of Assistant Commissioner. He also completed a nine-month Command and Staff Course conducted by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).[6]\n\n\nHe subsequently went on to complete a Master of Public Administration degree at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1993.[1]\n\n\n\n## Civil Service career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHeng is married to Chang Hwee Nee, the chief executive officer of the National Heritage Board. They have two children.[35][36][37]\n\n\nOn 12 May 2016, Heng collapsed from a stroke during a Cabinet meeting. He was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where he underwent neurosurgery to relieve pressure in his brain. He was transferred to the intensive care unit after the surgery[38][39] and discharged on 25 June 2016. He resumed his duties as a Member of Parliament and Minister for Finance on 22 August 2016.[40]\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Public Administration Medal (PPA) (2001)\n* ![](image) Meritorious Service Medal (PJG) (2010)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSingaporean politician\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![Singapore](image) Members of the 13th Parliament of Singapore *(2015\u20132020)*\n |\n| --- |\n| Speaker: ~~Halimah Yacob~~\u2192Tan, C J\n |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![Singapore](image) Members of the 12th Parliament of Singapore *(2011\u20132015)*\n |\n| --- |\n| Speaker: Halimah Yacob\n |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring a campaign speech, Heng unveiled the PAP's manifesto for East Coast GRC residents called \"Together We Care @East Coast\". The plan became popularly known as the \"East Coast Plan\" among Singaporeans and on social media.[21] In the campaigning period, a police report was lodged against Heng after comments he had made during a student forum at Nanyang Technological University in 2019 resurfaced.[22] While responding to a question on the possibility of Singapore having an ethnicity from the non-Chinese community as Prime Minister, Heng had said that the older generation was \"not ready for a prime minister from a minority race\" or someone who was non-Chinese.[23] The police released a statement on 7 July 2020, stating that they had consulted the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) and deemed that Heng's remarks had no intent to wound anyone's racial feelings or promote enmity between different races.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Member of multiple Parliaments of Singapore\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\n![Singapore](image) Members of the 14th Parliament of Singapore\n |\n| --- |\n| Speaker: ~~Tan, C J~~\u2192Seah, K P\n |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Mah, B T\n* Masagos\n* Ng, P H\n |\n| Tanjong PagarPAP | * Chan, C S\n* Chia, S L\n* Indranee\n* Neo, Lily\n |\n| West CoastPAP | * Fong, Jen\n* Foo, M H\n* Iswaran\n* Lim, H K\n* Wong, S T\n |\n\n | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * **Single Member Constituencies (SMCs)**\n |\n| Bukit PanjangPAP | * Teo, H P\n |\n| Hong Kah NorthPAP | * Khor, L S\n |\n| HougangWP | * Png, E H\n |\n| Joo ChiatPAP | * Chong, Y F\n |\n| MountbattenPAP | * Lim, B C\n |\n| PioneerPAP | * Foo, C K\n |\n| Potong PasirPAP | * Sitoh, Y P\n |\n| Punggol EastWP | * Lee, L L\n |\n| Radin MasPAP | * Tan, C S\n |\n| Sengkang WestPAP | * Lam, P M\n |\n| WhampoaPAP | * Heng, C H\n |\n| YuhuaPAP | * Fu, H Y\n |\n| * **Non-elected members**\n |\n| NCMP | * Giam, Y S\n* Loh, W L\n* Yee, J J\n |\n| NMPs | * Dhinakaran\n* Faizah\n* Fang, K W\n* Koh, Y M\n* Lien, T C\n* Liew, K E\n* Tan, K B\n* Tan, S S\n* Teo, S S\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Chia, Y Y\n* Chua, K S\n* Karthikeyan\n* Kuik, S Y\n* Ismail\n* Soh, S L\n* Tan, C L\n* Tan, G K\n* Tan, T Y\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * **Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs)**\n |\n| AljuniedWP | * Chen, S M\n* Lim, S L\n* Low, T K\n* Faisal\n* Singh\n |\n| Ang Mo KioPAP | * Ang, H K\n* David\n* Gan, T P\n* Intan\n* Koh, P K\n* Lee, H L\n |\n| Bishan\u2013Toa PayohPAP | * Chee, H T\n* Chong, K H\n* Ng, E H\n* Saktiandi\n* Teo, L M\n |\n| Chua Chu KangPAP | * Gan, K Y\n* Low, Y L\n* Yee, C H\n* Zaqy\n |\n| East CoastPAP | * Lee, Y S\n* Lim, S S\n* Maliki\n* Tan, S N\n |\n| Holland\u2013Bukit TimahPAP | * de Souza\n* Liang, E H\n* Sim, A\n* Vivian\n |\n| Jalan BesarPAP | * Heng, C H\n* Neo, L\n* Phua, L P\n* Yaacob\n |\n| JurongPAP | * Ang, W N\n* Lee, T S\n* Rahayu\n* Tharman\n* Tan, W M\n |\n| Marine ParadePAP | * Fatimah\n* Goh, C T\n* Seah, K P\n* Tan, C J\n* Tong, C F\n |\n| Marsiling\u2013Yew TeePAP | * Ong, T K\n* Wong, S T\n* Yam, Z M\n* ~~Halimah~~\n |\n| Nee SoonPAP | * Faishal\n* Kwek, H C\n* Lee, B W\n* Ng, K K\n* Shanmugam\n |\n| Pasir Ris\u2013PunggolPAP | * Ng, C M\n* Puthucheary\n* Sun, X L\n* Teo, C H\n* Teo, S L\n* Zainal\n |\n| SembawangPAP | * Amrin\n* Khaw, B W\n* Lim, W K\n* Ong, Y K\n* Nair\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| SengkangWP | * Chua, K W\n* He, T R\n* Lim, C W\n* ~~Raeesah~~\n |\n| TampinesPAP | * Baey, Y K\n* ~~Cheng, L H~~\n* Choo, P C\n* Koh, P K\n* Masagos\n |\n| Tanjong PagarPAP | * Chan, C S\n* Chua, S L\n* Indranee\n* Pereira\n* Tan, S H\n |\n| West CoastPAP | * Ang, W N\n* Foo, M H\n* Lee, T S\n* Ong, S Y\n* ~~Iswaran~~\n |\n\n | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Single Member Constituencies (SMCs)\n |\n| Bukit BatokPAP | * Pillai\n |\n| Bukit PanjangPAP | * Liang, E H\n |\n| Hong Kah NorthPAP | * Khor, L S\n |\n| HougangWP | * Tan, L F\n |\n| Kebun BaruPAP | * Kwek, H C\n |\n| MacPhersonPAP | * Tin, P L\n |\n| MarymountPAP | * Gan, S H\n |\n| MountbattenPAP | * Lim, B C\n |\n| PioneerPAP | * Tay, T G\n |\n| Potong PasirPAP | * Sitoh, Y P\n |\n| Punggol WestPAP | * Sun, X L\n |\n| Radin MasPAP | * Yong, Y C\n |\n| Yio Chu KangPAP | * Yip, H W\n |\n| YuhuaPAP | * Fu, H Y\n |\n| * Non-elected members\n |\n| NCMPPSP | * Leong, M W\n* Poa, K K\n |\n| NMPs | * Samad\n* Ang, G H\n* Chay, J J\n* Cheng, H Y\n* Hoon, H T\n* Koh, L P\n* Raj\n* Shahira\n* Tan, Y S\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
