For example, during a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a State Arrival Ceremony held on the South Lawn, a custom begun by John F. Kennedy in 1961.[111] This is followed by a state dinner given by the president which is held in the State Dining Room later in the evening.[112]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHead of state and head of government of the United States of America\n\n\"POTUS\" redirects here.

The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.\n\n\nThe power of the presidency has grown substantially[11] since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789.[6] While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly significant role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with notable expansions during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush.[12][13] In modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining superpower.[14][15][16][17] As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **This article is part of a series on the** |\n| Politics of the United States |\n| ![](image) |\n| Federal government\n* **Constitution of the United States**\n\n\n* Law\n* Taxation\n* Policy\n |\n| Legislature\n* **United States Congress**\n\n\n![](image) ![](image)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* **House of Representatives**\n\n\n* Speaker Mike Johnson (R)\n\n\n* Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R)\n\n\n* Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D)\n\n\n* Congressional districts (list)\n\n\n* Non-voting members\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* **Senate**\n\n\n* President Kamala Harris (D)\n\n\n* President Pro Tempore Patty Murray (D)\n\n\n* Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D)\n\n\n* Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R)\n |\n| Executive\n* **President of the United States**\n\n\n* Joe Biden (D)\n\n\n* **Vice President of the United States**\n\n\n* Kamala Harris (D)\n\n\n* **United States Attorney General**\n\n\n* Merrick Garland\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Cabinet\n* Federal agencies\n* Executive Office\n |\n| Judiciary\n* **Supreme Court of the United States**\n\n\n* Chief Justice John Roberts\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe president is typically considered to be the head of their political party. Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party inevitably have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The coattail effect, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.\n\n\n\n### Global leader[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUnited States presidential elections\n |\n| --- |\n| Elections by year | * 1788\n* 1792\n* 1796\n* 1800\n* 1804\n* 1808\n* 1812\n* 1816\n* 1820\n* 1824\n* 1828\n* 1832\n* 1836\n* 1840\n* 1844\n* 1848\n* 1852\n* 1856\n* 1860\n* 1864\n* 1868\n* 1872\n* 1876\n* 1880\n* 1884\n* 1888\n* 1892\n* 1896\n* 1900\n* 1904\n* 1908\n* 1912\n* 1916\n* 1920\n* 1924\n* 1928\n* 1932\n* 1936\n* 1940\n* 1944\n* 1948\n* 1952\n* 1956\n* 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* *2024*\n |\n| Elections by state | * Alabama\n* Alaska\n* Arizona\n* Arkansas\n* California\n* Colorado\n* Connecticut\n* Delaware\n* District of Columbia\n* Florida\n* Georgia\n* Hawaii\n* Idaho\n* Illinois\n* Indiana\n* Iowa\n* Kansas\n* Kentucky\n* Louisiana\n* Maine\n* Maryland\n* Massachusetts\n* Michigan\n* Minnesota\n* Mississippi\n* Missouri\n* Montana\n* Nebraska\n* Nevada\n* New Hampshire\n* New Jersey\n* New Mexico\n* New York\n* North Carolina\n* North Dakota\n* Ohio\n* Oklahoma\n* Oregon\n* Pennsylvania\n* Rhode Island\n* South Carolina\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMemorials to, and namesakes of, presidents of the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| By president | * 1 Washington\n* 2 J.

Under the Twenty-second Amendment, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a president's intra-term death or resignation.[B] In all, 45 individuals have served 46 presidencies spanning 58 four-year terms.[C] Joe Biden is the 46th and current president of the United States, having assumed office at noon EST on January 20, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n## History and development[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The informal term POTUS originated in the Phillips Code, a shorthand method created in 1879 by Walter P.

They typically vote for the candidates of the party that nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are pledged.[137][138] The constitutionality of these laws was upheld in *Chiafalo v. Washington* (2020).[139] Following the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an absolute majority of electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Map of the United States showing the number of electoral votes allocated to each state and the District of Columbia following the 2010 census for the 2012, 2016, and 2020 presidential elections; Maine and Nebraska distribute electors by way of the congressional district method. Of the 538 electoral votes possible, at least 270 votes are required for a majority.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOtherwise, the House of Representatives must meet to elect a president using a contingent election procedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top *three* electoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a Candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).[133]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n123. **^** Lexington (July 21, 2009). \"The Cult of the Presidency\". *The Economist*.

The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n180. **^** \"Shock and Anger Flash Throughout the United States\".

The presidency is a state organ of the NPC and equivalent to, for instance, the State Council and the National Supervisory Commission, rather than a political office, unlike the premier of the State Council. Together with the NPC Standing Committee, the presidency performs certain heads of state functions. The president can engage in state affairs with the consent of the NPC Standing Committee. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPolitics of the People's Republic of China\n |\n| --- |\n| * Constitution\n* Laws\n* Ideology\n |\n| Communist Party | * Central Committee\n\t+ Politburo\n\t\t- Standing Committee\n\t\t\t* General Secretary\n\t\t- Secretariat\n\t+ Military Commission\n* Central Commission for Discipline Inspection\n\t+ Secretary\n* Provincial standing committees\n* Constitution\n | ![National emblem of the People's Republic of China](image)\n |\n| Centralgovernment | * Paramount leader\n* National People's Congress\n\t+ Standing Committee\n\t\t- Chairman\n* President\n\t+ Vice President\n* State Council\n\t+ Premier\n\t+ Vice-Premiers\n\t+ State Councilors\n\t+ Ministries\n* Central Military Commission\n\t+ Chairman\n\t+ People's Liberation Army\n\t+ People's Armed Police\n\t+ Militia\n* National Supervisory Commission\n* Supreme People's Court\n* Supreme People's Procuratorate\n |\n| United front | * Political Consultative Conference\n\t+ Chairperson\n\t+ Minor parties\n\t+ People's organization\n* United Front Work Department\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCCP Chairman Mao Zedong was the first to hold the office of state chairman. He was elected at the founding session of the National People's Congress in 1954. At the 2nd NPC in 1959, Mao was succeeded by Liu Shaoqi, first-ranked Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. Liu was reelected as state chairman at the 3rd NPC in Jan 1965. However, in 1966, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution and by August 1966 Mao and his supporters succeeding in removing Liu from his position as party vice chairman. A few months later Liu was apparently placed under house arrest, and after a prolonged power struggle the 12th Plenum of the 8th Communist Party Congress stripped Liu Shaoqi of all his party and non-party positions on 31 October 1968, including the post of state chairman. This was in violation of the Constitution, which required a vote by the NPC to remove the state chairman.[*citation needed*] After Liu's removal in 1968, the office of state chairman was vacant. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 1981052929 May 1981\n | 32,26388 years, 122 days\n |\n| Presidency abolished\n |\n| 3\n | Xiannian, LiLi Xiannian | 1909062323 June 1909(23 June 1909) | 73 36073 years, 360 days\n | 04 2954 years, 295 days\n | 78 29078 years, 290 days\n | 1992062121 June 1992\n | 30,31482 years, 364 days\n |\n| 4\n | Shangkun, YangYang Shangkun | 190708033 August 1907(3 August 1907) | 80 25080 years, 250 days\n | 04 3524 years, 352 days\n | 85 23685 years, 236 days\n | 1998091414 September 1998\n | 33,28091 years, 42 days\n |\n| 5\n | Zemin, JiangJiang Zemin | 1926081717 August 1926(17 August 1926) | 66 22266 years, 222 days\n | 09 3539 years, 353 days\n | 76 21076 years, 210 days\n | 2022113030 November 2022\n | 35,16996 years, 105 days\n |\n| 6\n | Jintao, HuHu Jintao | 1942122121 December 1942(21 December 1942) | 60 08460 years, 84 days\n | 09 3649 years, 365 days\n | 70 08470 years, 84 days\n | Living\n | 29,76081\u00a0years, 175\u00a0days (Living)\n |\n| 7\n | Jinping, XiXi Jinping | 1953061515 June 1953(15 June 1953) | 59 years, 272 days\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| #\n | President\n | Date of birth\n | Age at ascension(first term) | Time in office(total) | Age at retirement(last term) | Date of death\n | Longevity\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Zedong, MaoMao Zedong | 1893122626 December 1893(26 December 1893) | 60 27560 years, 275 days\n | 04 2124 years, 212 days\n | 64 12264 years, 122 days\n | 197609099 September 1976\n | 30,20782 years, 258 days\n |\n| 2\n | Shaoqi, LiuLiu Shaoqi | 1898112424 November 1898(24 November 1898) | 60 15460 years, 154 days\n | 09 1879 years, 187 days\n | 69 34269 years, 342 days\n | 1969111212 November 1969\n | 25,92070 years, 353 days\n |\n| Presidency vacant\n |\n| *acting* | Biwu, DongDong Biwu | 188603055 March 1886(5 March 1886) | 85 35685 years, 356 days\n | 02 3272 years, 327 days\n | 88 31888 years, 318 days\n | 197504022 April 1975\n | 32,53489 years, 28 days\n |\n| *Hon.* | Ching-ling, SoongSoong Ching-ling | 1893012727 January 1893(27 January 1893) | 83 16188 years, 109 days\n | 01 242Honorary[26][27] | \u2013\n85 037\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe constitution also mandated term limits for the office, stipulating the president and vice president could not serve more than two consecutive terms.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe posts of the premier, president and CCP general secretary were held by different individuals in the 1980s. That said, in reality political power was concentrated on Deng Xiaoping, effectively the paramount leader, who controlled the Party, government and the military from \"behind the scenes\" without holding any of the three posts. However, presidents Li Xiannian (1983\u20131988) and Yang Shangkun (1988\u20131993) were not simple figureheads, but actually significant players in the highest leadership.

It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe state chairman's governmental powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: \"The Chairman of the People's Republic of China, whenever necessary, convenes a Supreme State Conference (Chinese: \u6700\u9ad8\u56fd\u52a1\u4f1a\u8bae) and acts as its chairman.\"[2] The members of the Supreme State Conference included the main officers of state, and its views were to be presented to the main organs of state and government, including the National People's Congress and the State and National Defense Councils.[2] The Supreme State Conference was also unique to the 1954 Constitution. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution and later Constitutions have not included a similar body.\n\n\n\n### History up to 1974[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The prime minister chairs the Cabinet of Japan and has the ability to select and dismiss its ministers of state. The prime minister also serves as the commander-in-chief of the Japan Self Defence Forces[2] and is a sitting member of either house of the National Diet (typically the House of Representatives). The individual is appointed by the emperor of Japan after being nominated by the National Diet (the parliament). The prime minister must retain the confidence of the House of Representatives to remain in office.\n\n\nThe prime minister lives and works at the Prime Minister's Official Residence in Nagatacho, Chiyoda, Tokyo, close to the National Diet Building. Fumio Kishida is the current prime minister of Japan, replacing Yoshihide Suga on 4 October 2021.[3] As of 14 June 2024, there have been 64 individual prime ministers serving 101 terms of office.\n\n\n\n\n## Designation[edit]\n\n\n### Abbreviations[edit]\n\n\nIn Japanese, due to the special nature of the work of the head of government, the prime minister's titles vary depending on context, sometimes demonstrating his/her role. Since the inception of the cabinet system, the prime minister is known in Japanese as *Naikaku S\u014dri-Daijin* (\u5185\u95a3\u7dcf\u7406\u5927\u81e3) whenever he is referred to as the head of the Cabinet. However, this title is usually abbreviated to *S\u014dri-Daijin* (\u7dcf\u7406\u5927\u81e3). Other abbreviations include *S\u014dri* (\u7dcf\u7406), *Shush\u014d* (\u9996\u76f8) or even *Saish\u014d* (\u5bb0\u76f8).[4]\n\n\n\n### English notation[edit]\n\n\nThe official English rendering is 'Prime Minister'.[5] This English translation was informally used as the English translation of 'Grand Minister' before the introduction of the cabinet system. However, this was not the original English translation of 'Prime Minister', and a German translation, 'Minister President of the State', was also used in the past.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)It\u014d Hirobumi, the first Prime Minister of Japan\nBefore the adoption of the Meiji Constitution, Japan had in practice no written constitution. Originally, a Chinese-inspired legal system known as *ritsury\u014d* was enacted in the late Asuka period and early Nara period. It described a government based on an elaborate and rational meritocratic bureaucracy, serving, in theory, under the ultimate authority of the emperor; although in practice, real power was often held elsewhere, such as in the hands of the Fujiwara clan, who intermarried with the imperial family in the Heian period, or by the ruling *sh\u014dgun*. Theoretically, the last *ritsury\u014d* code, the Y\u014dr\u014d Code enacted in 752, was still in force at the time of the Meiji Restoration.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nUnder this system, the *Daij\u014d-daijin* (\u592a\u653f\u5927\u81e3, Chancellor of the Realm)[6] was the head of the *Daij\u014d-kan* (Department of State), the highest organ of Japan's pre-modern Imperial government during the Heian period and until briefly under the Meiji Constitution with the appointment of Sanj\u014d Sanetomi in 1871. The office was replaced in 1885 with the appointment of It\u014d Hirobumi to the new position of Minister President of State,[7] four years before the enactment of the Meiji Constitution, which mentions neither the Cabinet nor the position of Prime Minister explicitly.[8][9] It took its current form with the adoption of the Constitution of Japan in 1947.\n\n\nTo date, 64 people have served this position. The longest serving prime minister to date is Shinzo Abe, who served as prime minister in two terms: from 26 September 2006 until 26 September 2007, and from 26 December 2012 until 16 September 2020.[10]\n\n\n\n## Appointment[edit]\n\n\nThe prime minister is nominated by both houses of the Diet, before the conduct of any other business. For that purpose, each conducts a ballot under the run-off system. If the two houses choose different individuals, then a joint committee of both houses is appointed to agree on a common nominee. Ultimately, however, if the two houses do not agree within ten days, the decision of the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the Diet. Therefore, the House of Representatives can theoretically ensure the appointment of any prime minister it wants.[11] The nominee is then presented with his or her commission, and formally appointed to office by the emperor.[12]\n\n\nConventionally, the prime minister is almost always the leader of the majority party in the House of Representatives, or the leader of the senior partner in the governing coalition. But there have been three cabinet prime ministers from junior coalition partners (Ashida 1948, Hosokawa 1993, Murayama 1994), a few minority governments (most recently the Hata Cabinet in 1994 and at least numerically the Second Hashimoto Cabinet of 1996 during its first year, but with an extra-cabinet cooperation (\u95a3\u5916\u5354\u529b, *kakugai ky\u014dryoku*) agreement with two parties, sufficient to ensure safe majorities for most government initiatives), and several cabinets with a majority in the House of Representatives, but without legislative majority of their own (most recently the DPJ-led cabinets after the 2010 election; cf. *Nejire Kokkai*/\"twisted Diets\").[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Qualifications[edit]\n\n\n* Must be a member of either house of the Diet. (This implies a minimum age of 25 and a Japanese nationality requirement.)[13]\n* Must be a civilian. This excludes serving members of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. Former military persons may be appointed, with Yasuhiro Nakasone being one prominent example.[13]\n\n\n## Role[edit]\n\n\n### Constitutional roles[edit]\n\n\n* Exercises \"control and supervision\" over the entire executive branch.[14]\n* Presents bills to the Diet on behalf of the Cabinet.[15]\n* Signs laws and Cabinet orders (along with other members of the Cabinet).[16]\n* Appoints all Cabinet ministers, and can dismiss them at any time.[17]\n* May permit legal action to be taken against Cabinet ministers.[18]\n* Must make reports on domestic and foreign relations to the Diet.[15]\n* Must report to the Diet upon demand to provide answers or explanations.[19]\n* May advise the emperor to dissolve the Diet's House of Representatives.[20]\n\n\n### Statutory roles[edit]\n\n\n* Presides over meetings of the Cabinet.[21]\n* Commander-in-chief of the Japan Self-Defense Forces.[22]\n* May override a court injunction against an administrative act upon showing of cause.[23]\n\n\nUnlike most of his counterparts in constitutional monarchies, the prime minister is both *de jure* and *de facto* chief executive. In most other constitutional monarchies, the monarch is nominal chief executive, while being bound by convention to act on the advice of the cabinet. In contrast, the Constitution of Japan explicitly vests executive power in the Cabinet, of which the prime minister is the leader. His countersignature is required for all laws and Cabinet orders. While most ministers in parliamentary democracies have some freedom of action within the bounds of cabinet collective responsibility, the Japanese Cabinet is effectively an extension of the prime minister's authority.\n\n\n\n## Insignia[edit]\n\n\n* ![Standard of the Prime Minister](image)\n\nStandard of the Prime Minister\n* ![Seal of the Prime Minister](image)\n\nSeal of the Prime Minister\n* ![Mon (crest) of the Prime Minister](image)\n\nMon (crest) of the Prime Minister\n\n\n## Official office and residence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kantei, the Prime Minister's Official Residence\nLocated near the Diet building, the Office of the Prime Minister of Japan is called the *Kantei* (\u5b98\u90b8). The original Kantei served from 1929 until 2002, when a new building was inaugurated to serve as the current Kantei.[24] The old Kantei was then converted into the Official Residence, or *K\u014dtei* (\u516c\u90b8).[25] The K\u014dtei lies to the southwest of the Kantei, and is linked by a walkway.[25]\n\n\n\n## Travel[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japanese Air Force One\n\nSee also: Prime Minister's Official Car (Japan)\n\nThe prime minister of Japan travels in a Toyota Century, which replaced the Lexus LS 600h L in 2019.\n\n\nFor overseas air travel, the Japanese government maintains two Boeing 777, which replaced the Boeing 747-400 also in 2019. The aircraft is also used by the emperor, the members of the imperial family, and other high-ranking officials.\n\n\nThey have the radio callsigns Japanese Air Force One and Japanese Air Force Two when operating on official business, and Cygnus One and Cygnus Two when operating outside of official business (e.g., on training flights). The aircraft always fly together on government missions, with one serving as the primary transport and the other serving as a backup with maintenance personnel on board. The aircraft are officially referred to as Japanese government exclusive aircraft (\u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5c02\u7528\u6a5f, *Nippon-koku seifu sen'y\u014dki*).[26]\n\n\n\n* ![Toyota Century](image)\n\nToyota Century\n* ![Japanese Air Force One](image)\n\nJapanese Air Force One\n\n\n## Honours and emoluments[edit]\n\n\nUntil the mid-1930s, the prime minister of Japan was normally granted a hereditary peerage (*kazoku*) prior to leaving office if he had not already been ennobled. Titles were usually bestowed in the ranks of count, viscount or baron, depending on the relative accomplishments and status of the prime minister. The two highest ranks, marquess and prince, were only bestowed upon highly distinguished statesmen, and were not granted to a prime minister after 1928. The last prime minister who was a peer was Baron Kij\u016br\u014d Shidehara, who served as Prime Minister from October 1945 to May 1946. The peerage was abolished when the Constitution of Japan came into effect in May 1947.\n\n\nCertain eminent prime ministers have been awarded the Order of the Chrysanthemum, typically in the degree of Grand Cordon. The highest honour in the Japanese honours system, the Collar of the Order of the Chrysanthemum, has only been conferred upon select prime ministers and eminent statesmen; the last such award to a living prime minister was to Saionji Kinmochi in 1928. More often, the Order of the Chrysanthemum has been a posthumous distinction; both the Collar and Grand Cordon of the order were last awarded posthumously to former prime minister Shinzo Abe in July 2022.[27]\n\n\nAfter relinquishing office, the prime minister is normally accorded the second or senior third rank in the court order of precedence, and is usually raised to the senior second rank posthumously. Certain distinguished prime ministers have been posthumously raised to the first rank; the last such award was to Eisaku Sato in 1975. Since the 1920s, following their tenure in office, Prime ministers have typically been conferred with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Paulownia Flowers (until 2003 a special higher class of the Order of the Rising Sun), depending on tenure and eminence. However, honours may be withheld due to misconduct or refusal on the part of the prime minister (for example, Kiichi Miyazawa).\n\n\nThe Prime Minister also awards individuals in recognition of their accomplishments in sport, entertainment, and other fields. Some of the awards and commendations offered include the Prime Minister's Award, created by Eisaku Sat\u014d in 1966, and the People's Honour Award, created by Takeo Fukuda in 1977. Additionally, the PM also presents the Prime Minister's Trophy on behalf of the Japan Professional Sports Association and the Monodzukuri Nippon award on behalf of the Japanese Manufacturing Association.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of prime ministers of Japan\n* List of spouses of prime ministers of Japan\n* Air transports of heads of state and government\n* Official state car\n* Japanese Air Force One\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The Cabinet shall resign en masse after a general election of members of the House of Representatives. Their term of office is four years which can be terminated earlier. No limits are imposed on the number of terms or tenures the Prime Minister may hold. The Prime Minister is, by convention, the leader of the victorious party, though some prime ministers have been elected from junior coalition partners or minority parties.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** *\u9996\u76f8\u306f4049\u4e07\u5186\u3001\u95a3\u50da\u306e\u7d66\u6599\u306f\u5b89\u3044\uff1f\u9ad8\u3044\uff1f \u83c5\u5185\u95a3\u8a95\u751f\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8* (in Japanese), The Nikkei, 16 September 2020, retrieved 20 May 2022\n2. **^** \"Book review: A nuanced deep dive on Japan's Self-Defense Forces\".\n3. **^** \"Fumio Kishida: Japan's new prime minister takes office\". *BBC News*. 4 October 2021.

For that reason, some observers refer to the German political system as a \"chancellor democracy\". Even though the office of chancellor is often considered the most powerful in the German political system and is seen as such within the German public, it is only the third highest office, following the head of state, the President of Germany, and the President of the Bundestag, a position similar to the speaker of the federal parliament.\n\n\nWhichever major party (CDU/CSU or SPD) does not hold the chancellorship usually calls its leading candidate for the federal election \"chancellor-candidate\" (*Kanzlerkandidat*). The federal government (*Bundesregierung*) consists of the chancellor and cabinet ministers.\n\n\n\n### Role[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFurther information: List of chancellors of Germany \u00a7\u00a0Federal Republic of Germany (1949\u2013present)\n\n**Political party:**\n\u00a0\u00a0CDU\n\u00a0\u00a0SPD\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name(Birth\u2013Death) | Term of office\n | Political party\n | Vice Chancellor\n | Cabinets\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Term\n | Time in office\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | **Konrad Adenauer**(1876\u20131967) | September 15, 1949\u2013October 16, 1963 | 14\u00a0years, 31\u00a0days\n | CDU | Franz Bl\u00fccher (1949\u20131957)Ludwig Erhard (1957\u20131963) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII\n\n---\n\nIV |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | **Ludwig Erhard**(1897\u20131977) | October 16, 1963\u2013December 1, 1966 | 3\u00a0years, 46\u00a0days\n | CDU[c] | Erich Mende (1963\u20131966)Hans-Christoph Seebohm (1966) | I\n\n---\n\nII |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | **Kurt Georg Kiesinger**(1904\u20131988) | December 1, 1966\u2013October 22, 1969 | 2\u00a0years, 325\u00a0days\n | CDU | Willy Brandt (1966\u20131969) | I |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | **Willy Brandt**(1913\u20131992) | October 22, 1969\u2013May 7, 1974 | 4\u00a0years, 197\u00a0days\n | SPD | Walter Scheel (1969\u20131974) | I\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nII |\n| *Vice Chancellor Walter Scheel served as acting Chancellor from 7 May to 16 May 1974.* |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | **Helmut Schmidt**(1918\u20132015) | May 16, 1974\u2013October 1, 1982 | 8\u00a0years, 138\u00a0days\n | SPD | Hans-Dietrich Genscher (1974\u20131982)Egon Franke (1982) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | **Helmut Kohl**(1930\u20132017) | October 1, 1982\u2013October 27, 1998 | 16\u00a0years, 26\u00a0days\n | CDU | Hans-Dietrich Genscher (1982\u20131992)\n\n---\n\nJ\u00fcrgen M\u00f6llemann (1992\u20131993)\n\n---\n\nKlaus Kinkel (1993\u20131998) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII\n\n---\n\nIV\n\n---\n\nV |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | **Gerhard Schr\u00f6der**(b. 1944) | October 27, 1998\u2013November 22, 2005 | 7\u00a0years, 26\u00a0days\n | SPD | Joschka Fischer (1998\u20132005) | I\n\n---\n\nII |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | **Angela Merkel**(b. 1954) | November 22, 2005\u2013December 8, 2021 | 16\u00a0years, 16\u00a0days\n | CDU | Franz M\u00fcntefering (2005\u20132007)Frank-Walter Steinmeier (2007\u20132009)Guido Westerwelle (2009\u20132011)Philipp R\u00f6sler (2011\u20132013)Sigmar Gabriel (2013\u20132018)Olaf Scholz (2018\u20132021) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIf no chancellor has been elected within this period, the Bundestag will hold one last ballot on the 15th day after the first ballot, to which (like in the 2nd voting phase) the parliamentary groups may put forward candidates (\"3rd voting phase\"). A candidate reaching the \"chancellor majority\" in any voting phase, must be appointed by the President of Germany. However, if on the last ballot no candidate reaches this threshold, the president is free to either appoint as chancellor the candidate who received a plurality of votes here (*de facto* allowing formation of a minority government) or call new elections for the *Bundestag* within 60 days.[9]\n\n\nAnother possibility to vote a new chancellor into office is the constructive vote of no confidence, which allows the Bundestag to replace a sitting chancellor, if it elects a new chancellor with the \"chancellor-majority\" (see below).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** German: *Bundeskanzler(in) der Bundesrepublik Deutschland*; often shortened to *Bundeskanzler*/*Bundeskanzlerin*, pronounced [\u02c8b\u028and\u0259s\u02cckant\u0361sl\u0250] \u24d8/[\u02c8b\u028and\u0259s\u02cckant\u0361sl\u0259\u0281\u026an] \u24d8\n2. **^** In peacetime, the commander in chief of the German Armed Forces is the Federal Minister of Defence according to Article 65a of the German Basic Law.\n3. **^** It is unclear whether and from when Erhard was formally a member of the CDU; however, he was a member of the CDU/CSU group in the German Bundestag throughout his chancellorship and was chairman of the CDU from 23 March 1966 \u2013 23 May 1967, which implies membership at least during this period.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn order to garner legislative support in the *Bundestag*, the chancellor can also ask for a motion of confidence (*Vertrauensfrage*, literally \"question of trust\"), either combined with a legislative proposal or as a standalone vote. If such a vote fails, the chancellor may ask the president for the dissolution of the *Bundestag*; he or she is however not bound to do so, and the president in turn is not bound to follow this request.\n\n\n\n### Vice chancellor[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robert Habeck, Vice Chancellor of Germany\nThe chancellor must appoint one of the cabinet ministers as vice chancellor (Article 69.1 Basic Law). The vice chancellor may deputise for the chancellor, if they are absent or unable to perform their duties. Although the chancellor is theoretically free to choose any cabinet minister, in coalition governments the leadership of the second biggest coalition party usually designates one of their ministers for the position, whom the chancellor appoints accordingly.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power on 30 January 1933, the Weimar Constitution was *de facto* set aside. After the death of President Hindenburg in 1934, Adolf Hitler, the dictatorial party leader and chancellor, took over the powers of the president. The new official title became *F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler* (meaning \"Leader and Imperial Chancellor\").\n\n\nThe 1949 constitution gave the chancellor much greater powers than during the Weimar Republic, while strongly diminishing the role of the president. Germany is today often referred to as a \"chancellor democracy\", reflecting the role of the chancellor as the country's chief executive.\n\n\nSince 1867, 33 individuals have served as heads of government of Germany, West Germany, or Northern Germany, nearly all of them with the title of Chancellor.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ East Germany\n\t+ West Germany\n |\n| Contemporary | * Reunification\n* History of Germany since 1990\n |\n| Regions | * History of Prussia\n* History of Brandenburg\n* Cologne War, 1583-1588\n* Baden Revolution, 1848\n |\n\n |\n| Geography | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Administrative divisions\n\t+ States\n\t+ Districts\n* Cities and towns\n* Earthquakes\n* Geology\n* Islands\n* Lakes\n* Mountains\n* Rivers\n |\n\n |\n| Politics | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Bundestag\n* Bundesrat\n* *Bundeswehr* (military)\n* Cabinet\n* Chancellor\n* Constitution\n* Court system\n* Elections\n* Foreign relations\n* Human rights\n\t+ Intersex\n\t+ LGBT\n\t+ Transgender\n* Law\n* Law enforcement\n* Lobbying\n* Conservatism\n* Nationalism\n* Political parties\n* President\n |\n\n |\n| Economy | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The cabinet bench in the Reichstag building (to the left of the flag) with the raised seat of the chancellor in the front row\nThe chancellor's authority emanates from the provisions of the Basic Law and in practice from their status as leader of the party (or coalition of parties) holding a majority of seats in the *Bundestag* (federal parliament).

The chancellor's country retreat is Schloss Meseberg in the state of Brandenburg.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2023, all chancellors of the federal republic have been (re-)elected on proposal of the President and on the first ballot with the sole exception of Helmut Kohl, who was elected to his first term via a constructive vote of no confidence against Helmut Schmidt.\n\n\n\n### Confidence[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Constructive vote of no confidence\n\nUnlike in other parliamentary legislatures, the Bundestag cannot remove the chancellor with a traditional motion of no confidence. Instead, the removal of a chancellor is only possible if a majority of the *Bundestag* members agree on a successor, who is then immediately sworn in as new chancellor. This procedure is called \"constructive motion of no confidence\" (*konstruktives Misstrauensvotum*) and was created to avoid the situation that existed in the Weimar Republic, when it was easier to gather a parliament majority willing to remove a government in office than to find a majority capable of supporting a new stable government.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough the offices were merged, Hitler continued to be addressed as \"F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler\" indicating that the head of state and head of government were still separate positions, albeit held by the same person, although the title of \"Reichskanzler\" was quietly dropped. This separation was made more evident when, in April 1945, Hitler gave instruction that upon his death, the office of the F\u00fchrer would dissolve and be replaced by the previous system of administration: that of the office of the President separate from that of Chancellor. On 30 April 1945, when Hitler committed suicide, he was briefly succeeded as Chancellor by Joseph Goebbels and as President of Germany by Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz. When Goebbels also committed suicide, D\u00f6nitz appointed Count Schwerin von Krosigk as head of government with the title \"Leading Minister\".\n\n\n\n## Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany (1949\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Willy Brandt talking at an SPD meeting in Dortmund, 1983\nThe office of Chancellor has a long history, stemming back to the Holy Roman Empire, when the office of German archchancellor was usually held by archbishops of Mainz. The title was, at times, used in several states of German-speaking Europe. The modern office of chancellor was established with the North German Confederation, of which Otto von Bismarck became *Bundeskanzler* (meaning \"**Federal Chancellor**\") in 1867. With the enlargement of this federal state to the German Empire in 1871, the title was renamed to ***Reichskanzler*** (meaning \"**Imperial Chancellor**\"). With Germany's constitution of 1949, the title of *Bundeskanzler* was revived.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe correct style of address in German is *Herr Bundeskanzler* (male) or *Frau Bundeskanzlerin* (female). In international correspondence, the chancellor is referred to as \"His/Her Excellency the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany\" (\"*Seine/Ihre Exzellenz der Bundeskanzler/die Bundeskanzlerin der Bundesrepublik Deutschland*\").[1]\n\n\n\n### Salary[edit]\n\n\nHolding the third-highest state office available within Germany, the chancellor of Germany receives \u20ac220,000 per annum and a \u20ac22,000 bonus, i.e. one and two thirds of Salary Grade B11 (according to \u00a7 11 (1) a of the Federal Law on Ministers\u00a0\u2013 Bundesministergesetz, BGBl. 1971 I p.\u00a01166 and attachment IV to the Federal Law on Salaries of Officers\u00a0\u2013 Bundesbesoldungsgesetz, BGBl. 2002 I p.\u00a03020)[12]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Germany portal\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n\n\n* List of chancellors of Germany by time in office\n* Religious affiliations of chancellors of Germany\n* Leadership of East Germany\n* Prime minister\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the now-defunct German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany), which existed from 7 October 1949 to 3 October 1990 (when the territory of the former GDR was reunified with the Federal Republic of Germany), the position of chancellor did not exist.

As with other elections performed by the Bundestag, the chancellor is elected via secret ballot. The process begins with the President of Germany proposing a candidate to the Bundestag (A formality, as they are usually a candidate on which majority parties have agreed to beforehand), who is then voted upon without debate (\"1st voting phase\"). If this nominee is not elected, the parliamentary groups in the Bundestag may, during the following 14 days, propose their own nominees, who also have to be elected with the \"chancellor-majority\" (\"2nd voting phase\"). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 9 November 1918, Chancellor Max von Baden handed over his office of chancellor to Friedrich Ebert. Ebert continued to serve as head of government during the three months between the end of the German Empire in November 1918 and the first gathering of the Weimar National Assembly in February 1919, but did not use the title of chancellor.\n\n\nDuring that time, Ebert also served as chairman of the \"Council of the People's Deputies\", until 29 December 1918 together with the Independent Social Democrat Hugo Haase.\n\n\n\n#### Weimar Republic (1919\u20131933)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: List of chancellors of Germany \u00a7\u00a0Weimar Republic (1918\u20131933)\n\nThe office of chancellor (*Reichskanzler*) was continued in the Weimar Republic*.* The Weimar Constitution provided for a two-part executive consisting of a Reich president and a government made up of Reich ministers and a Reich chancellor (Article 52)[4] who determined the guidelines of the government's policy (Article 56).[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIf the chancellor's term in office ends or if they resign, the Bundestag has to elect a new chancellor. The president of Germany may ask the former chancellor to act as chancellor until a new office holder is elected, but if they are unwilling or unable to do so, the president may also appoint the vice chancellor as acting chancellor. This has happened once: On 7 May 1974 Chancellor Willy Brandt resigned as a consequence of the Guillaume affair, an espionage scandal. In his letter of resignation to President Gustav Heinemann he requested, to be not asked to remain in office in an acting capacity and instead to appoint the vice chancellor as acting chancellor.[11] President Heinemann followed the request. Vice Chancellor Walter Scheel was appointed acting chancellor and served for nine days until the election of Helmut Schmidt on 16 May 1974.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

His premiership was followed by Lal Bahadur Shastri's short tenure and Indira Gandhi's 11- and 4-year-long tenures, both politicians belonging to the Indian National Congress. After Indira Gandhi's assassination, her son Rajiv Gandhi took charge until 1989, when a decade with five unstable governments began. This was followed by the full terms of P. V. Narasimha Rao, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh, and Narendra Modi.

His tenure ended in May 1964, on his death.[15][16] After the death of Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri\u2014a former home minister and a leader of the Congress party\u2014ascended to the position of prime minister. Shastri's tenure saw the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Shashtri subsequently died of a reported heart attack in Tashkent, after signing the Tashkent Declaration.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** Majeed, Akhtar (2005), \"Republic of India\", in Kincaid, John; Tarr, G.
