According to the data provided by Japan Meteorological Agency, the maximum recorded temperature in Japan was 41.1\u00a0\u00b0C (106.0\u00a0\u00b0F) in Kumagaya on July 23, 2018 and in Hamamatsu on August 17, 2020, while the minimum recorded temperature was \u221241.0\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221241.8\u00a0\u00b0F) in Asahikawa on January 25, 1902. Below is a list of the most extreme temperatures recorded in Japan.\n\n\n\n![](image)Minami-Tori-shima is the region with the highest annual average temperature in Japan.\nIt is worth noting that in the whole of Japan, the place with the lowest annual average temperature is not Hokkaido, but Mount Fuji at the junction of Shizuoka and Yamanashi prefecture. The annual average temperature is \u22125.9\u00a0\u00b0C (21.4\u00a0\u00b0F), which is the average annual temperature of all weather stations in Japan so far. The only area with a negative value, Mount Fuji's extreme maximum temperature was only 17.8\u00a0\u00b0C (64.0\u00a0\u00b0F), which was measured on August 13, 1942.\n\n\nIn contrast, Minami-Tori-shima has the highest annual average temperature in Japan. This is a small island in the Pacific Ocean, some 1850 km from Honshu. It has an annual average temperature of 25.8\u00a0\u00b0C (78.4\u00a0\u00b0F), exceeding the value recorded by all weather stations including Okinawa Prefecture. And the extreme minimum temperature in the region is 13.8\u00a0\u00b0C (56.8\u00a0\u00b0F), which is unique in the whole of Japan, because even in Okinawa Prefecture, the minimum temperature of the year tends to be lower than 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F).\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Japan, extremes 1872\u2212present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 29.7(85.5)\n | 29.1(84.4)\n | 30.4(86.7)\n | 33.7(92.7)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 39.8(103.6)\n | 41.1(106.0)\n | \u2014\n | 40.4(104.7)\n | 36.0(96.8)\n | 34.2(93.6)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 41.1(106.0)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u221241.0(\u221241.8)\n | \u221238.3(\u221236.9)\n | \u221235.2(\u221231.4)\n | \u221227.8(\u221218.0)\n | \u221218.9(\u22122.0)\n | \u221213.1(8.4)\n | \u22126.9(19.6)\n | \u22124.3(24.3)\n | \u221210.8(12.6)\n | \u221219.5(\u22123.1)\n | \u221228.1(\u221218.6)\n | \u221234.2(\u221229.6)\n | \u221241.0(\u221241.8)\n |\n| Source: Japan Meteorological Agency[1] |\n\n\n## Maximum temperatures[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Japan maximum temperature extremes, by month |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Highest maximum temperatures\n | Lowest maximum temperatures\n |\n| \u00b0C\n | \u00b0F\n | Location and date\n | \u00b0C\n | \u00b0F\n | Location and date\n |\n| January\n | 29.7\n | 85.5 | * Minami-Tori-shima (9 Jan 2021)\n | \u221232.0\n | \u221225.6 | * Mount Fuji (31 Jan 1936)\n |\n| February\n | 29.1\n | 84.4 | * Ishigaki, Okinawa (16 Feb 1898)\n | \u221230.2\n | \u221222.4 | * Mount Fuji (17 Feb 1977)\n |\n| March\n | 30.4\n | 86.7 | * Naze, Amami, Kagoshima (26 Mar 1999)\n | \u221230.1\n | \u221222.2 | * Mount Fuji (5 Mar 1977)\n |\n| April\n | 33.7\n | 92.7 | * Yonago (28 Apr 2005)\n | \u221221.2\n | \u22126.2 | * Mount Fuji (12 Apr 1996)\n |\n| May\n | 39.5\n | 103.1 | * Saroma, Hokkaido (26 May 2019)\n | \u221213.4\n | 7.9 | * Mount Fuji (6 May 1945)\n |\n| June\n | 39.8\n | 103.6 | * Kumagaya (24 Jun 2011)\n | \u22126.6\n | 20.1 | * Mount Fuji (2 Jun 1981)\n |\n| July\n | 41.1\n | 106.0 | * Kumagaya (23 Jul 2018)\n | \u22121.2\n | 29.8 | * Mount Fuji (8 Jul 1945)\n |\n| August\n | 7,000.00\n | 12,632.00 | * Hiroshima (6 Aug1945)\n | 0.6\n | 33.1 | * Mount Fuji (25 Aug 1972)\n |\n| September\n | 40.4\n | 104.7 | * Sanj\u014d, Niigata (3 Sep 2020)\n | \u22126.2\n | 20.8 | * Mount Fuji (24 Sep 1976)\n |\n| October\n | 36.0\n | 96.8 | * Sanj\u014d, Niigata (6 Oct 2018)\n | \u221213.7\n | 7.3 | * Mount Fuji (24 Oct 1947)\n |\n| November\n | 34.2\n | 93.6 | * Minami-Tori-shima (4 Nov 1953)\n | \u221224.8\n | \u221212.6 | * Mount Fuji (30 Nov 1970)\n |\n| December\n | 31.6\n | 88.9 | * Minami-Tori-shima (5 Dec 1952)\n | \u221228.7\n | \u221219.7 | * Mount Fuji (26 Dec 1995)\n |\n\n\n## Minimum temperatures[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Asahikawa is one of the coldest cities in Japan, pictured here is the Asahibashi Bridge in Asahikawa in winter.\n\n\n| Japan minimum temperature extremes, by month |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Highest minimum temperatures\n | Lowest minimum temperatures\n |\n| \u00b0C\n | \u00b0F\n | Location and date\n | \u00b0C\n | \u00b0F\n | Location and date\n |\n| January\n | 26.0\n | 78.8 | * Minami-Tori-shima (9 Jan 2021)\n | \u221241.0\n | \u221241.8 | * Asahikawa (25 Jan 1902)\n |\n| February\n | 24.5\n | 76.1 | * Iriomote Island (11 Feb 2010)\n* Ishigaki, Okinawa (11 Feb 2010)\n | \u221238.3\n | \u221236.9 | * Asahikawa (11 Feb 1902)\n |\n| March\n | 25.2\n | 77.4 | * Minami-Tori-shima (22 Mar 1999)\n | \u221235.2\n | \u221231.4 | * Obihiro (3 Mar 1895)\n |\n| April\n | 26.9\n | 80.4 | * Ishigaki, Okinawa (30 Apr 2019)\n | \u221227.8\n | \u221218.0 | * Mount Fuji (3 Apr 1965)\n |\n| May\n | 28.7\n | 83.7 | * Tarama, Okinawa (29 May 2016)\n | \u221218.9\n | \u22122.0 | * Mount Fuji (3 May 1934)\n |\n| June\n | 29.7\n | 85.5 | * Ishigaki, Okinawa (30 Jun 2015)\n | \u221213.1\n | 8.4 | * Mount Fuji (2 Jun 1981)\n |\n| July\n | 30.3\n | 86.5 | * Komatsu, Ishikawa (31 Jul 2000)\n | \u22126.9\n | 19.6 | * Mount Fuji (4 Jul 1966)\n |\n| August\n | 31.3\n | 88.3 | * Itoigawa (15 Aug 2019)\n | \u22124.3\n | 24.3 | * Mount Fuji (25 Aug 1972)\n |\n| September\n | 29.8\n | 85.6 | * Koshino, Fukui (3 Sep 2020)\n | \u221210.8\n | 12.6 | * Mount Fuji (23 Sep 1976)\n |\n| October\n | 28.6\n | 83.5 | * Minami-Tori-shima (7 Oct 2019)\n | \u221219.5\n | \u22123.1 | * Mount Fuji (30 Oct 1984)\n |\n| November\n | 27.6\n | 81.7 | * Minami-Tori-shima (6 Nov 2020)\n | \u221228.1\n | \u221218.6 | * Mount Fuji (30 Nov 1970)\n |\n| December\n | 26.3\n | 79.3 | * Minami-Tori-shima (4 Dec 1998)\n | \u221234.2\n | \u221229.6 | * Obihiro (30 Dec 1907)\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \u6b74\u4ee3\u5168\u56fd\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 - \u5404\u5730\u70b9\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u89b3\u6e2c\u53f2\u4e0a1\u4f4d\u306e\u5024\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002.

Night temperatures cross the 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) mark towards the latter part of April. May is Delhi's hottest month during which temperatures may reach 45\u00a0\u00b0C (113\u00a0\u00b0F) or higher.[14] This month is characterized by frequent thunderstorms.[15] Dust storms are another feature of Delhi's summer,[16][17] and can be severe and destructive when accompanied by strong winds, particularly under cumulonimbus formation.[18] These are caused due to fine dust brought along by the hot winds arriving from the desert. They make the surroundings appear pale yellow, bring temperatures slightly down and are usually followed by thunderstorms. Post mid-June, temperatures start falling slowly, while humidity shows a gradual rise.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWinter starts in November and peaks in January, with average temperatures around 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57\u00a0\u00b0F). Although daytime temperatures are warm, Delhi's proximity to the Himalayas results in cold waves leading to lower apparent temperature due to wind chill. Delhi is notorious for its heavy fogs and haze during the winter season. In December, reduced visibility leads to disruption of road, air and rail traffic.[3] Winter ends by the first week of March.\n\n\nExtreme temperatures have ranged from \u22122.2 to 48.4\u00a0\u00b0C (28.0 to 119.1\u00a0\u00b0F).[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Classifications[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"Climatological Information - New Delhi (Ridge) (42184)\".

Its climate is greatly influenced by its proximity to the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, causing it to experience both weather extremes. Delhi has 5 distinct seasons, viz. Summer, Rainy, Autumn, Winter and Spring.[11] Broadly speaking, Delhi has long and scorching summers- sub-divided into dry summer and humid monsoon seasons, short and mildly cold winters, and two bouts of pleasant transition seasons. Two most important wind patterns influencing Delhi's climate are the Western Disturbance and the South-West Winds.\n\n\nDelhi experienced its coolest May in 36 years with excess rainfall, bringing the average maximum temperature down to 36.8\u00b0C, the lowest since 1987, according to the India Meteorological Department.

Maximum temperatures again cross 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) and days become pleasant.\nBy mid-February or somewhat beyond, minimum temperatures cross the 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F) mark and days start getting warmer gradually, marking the end of winter.\nDelhi can sometimes have a prolonged season of chill, extending into March.[34][35][36]\n\n\n\n### Spring[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Weather monitoring stations[edit]\n\n\nDelhi has two weather monitoring stations, one at Safdarjung inside the main city and other at Palam on southwest Delhi near the Airport. The readings at Safdarjung station are taken as those for the city, whereas the readings at Palam station are taken as those for the Airport.\n\n\n\n## Day-length variation[edit]\n\n\nLocated at 28\u00b036\u203236\u2033N latitude, Delhi lies in the sub-tropical belt of earth's North Temperate geographical region, a few latitudes north of the Tropic of Cancer. As such the rotation of earth has its effect on the city's day-length, which shortens during winters and lengthens during summers. Between the two solstices, Delhi's day-length changes by about 4 hours, offset by some 2 hours each at sunrise and sunset.[82][83]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
