He received a Ph.D. in 1984 from University of California, Berkeley and was a postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University in New York. In 1989, David Julius was recruited as professor to the University of California, San Francisco.[4][5] He was the recipient of numerous prestigious awards such as the 2010 Shaw Prize in Life Sciences and Medicine, the 2010 Prince of Asturias Prize for Technical and Scientific Research, the 2020 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences,[6] and the 2020 Kavli Prize in Neuroscience (together with Patapoutian)[7] and the 2020 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award.[8]\n\n\n\n### Ardem Patapoutian[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ardem Patapoutian\n\nArdem Patapoutian was born to an Armenian family in 1967 in Beirut, Lebanon. In his youth, he moved from a war-torn Beirut to Los Angeles, United States and received a Ph.D. in biology in 1996 from California Institute of Technology. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San Francisco. Since 2000, he is a scientist at Scripps Research, La Jolla, California where he is now Professor. Since 2014, he is an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.[9][10] He was a recipient of the 2017 W. Alden Spencer Award, the 2019 Rosenstiel Award, 2020 Kavli Prize for Neuroscience,[7] and the 2020 the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Biology / Biomedicine.[8]\n\n\n\n## Reactions[edit]\n\n\nIn announcing the winners, Thomas Perlmann, secretary-general of the Karolinska Institute, said: \"This really unlocks one of the secrets of nature. It’s actually something that is crucial for our survival, so it’s a very important and profound discovery.\"[11][12] The Nobel Committee believed that Julius and Patapoutian's discoveries address \"one of the greatest mysteries facing humanity\" – the sensation of the environment.[11][13] Oscar Marín, director of the MRC Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders at King's College London, expressed that the choice of this year's winners underscored how little scientists knew about that question before the discoveries and how much there still is to learn.[11][14]\n\n\nJan Adams, chief officer at Grünenthal, which markets pain relief skin patches and creams based on the TRPV1 capsaicin receptor discovered by Julius, said their discoveries had \"opened up a whole new field of research for new non-opioid pain therapies\".[12][14] Fiona Boissonade, pain specialist at the University of Sheffield, said the Nobel laureates' work was especially relevant for the one in five people globally that suffer from chronic pain. She said: \"Their research may lead us to identify new compounds that are effective in treating pain that don't come with the devastating impact of opioids.\"[11][12]\n\n\n\n## Key publications[edit]\n\n\nThe following publications were the fundamental researches that motivated the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet to award the 2021 Prize to Julius and Patapoutian:[15]\n\n\n\n### David Julius[edit]\n\n\n* Caterina M.J., Schumacher M.A., Tominaga M., Rosen T.A., Levine J.D., **Julius D**. *The capsaicin receptor: a heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway*.

He completed his doctoral studies at Uppsala University in 1986, served as a postdoctoral associate at the University of Zürich and University of California, Berkeley in the United States, and joined the faculty at the University of Munich in Germany in 1990. He established the Leipzig, Germany-based Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in 1999, where he continues to be involved. He is also an adjunct professor at the Japan's Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology. He was the recipient of numerous prizes including Gruber Prize in Genetics in 2013, Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences in 2016, and the Princess of Asturias Award in 2018. \n\n\n\n## Nobel Committee[edit]\n\n\nThe committee members are elected for a period of three years. In assessing the qualifications of the candidates, the committee is assisted by specially appointed expert advisers.[9] The following medical experts were the members of the 2022 Nobel Committee: \n\n\n\n* Nils-Göran Larsson, professor of mitochondrial genetics; chair\n* Thomas Perlmann, professor of molecular development biology; secretary\n* Olle Kämpe, professor of endocrinology\n* Gunilla Karlsson-Hedestam, professor of immunology\n* Sten Linnarsson, professor of molecular systems biology\n* Per Svenningsson, professor of neurology\n\n\n## Key publications[edit]\n\n\nThe following publications were the fundamental researches that motivated the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet to award the 2022 Prize to Pääbo:[10]\n\n\n\n* Krings M, Stone A, Schmitz RW, Krainitzki H, Stoneking M, **Pääbo S**. *Neandertal DNA sequences and the origin of modern humans*.

There were also five years for which the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was delayed for one year. The Prize was not awarded in 1914, as the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine decided that none of that year's nominations met the necessary criteria, but was awarded to Robert Bárány in 1915 and counted as the 1914 prize.[8] This precedent was followed for the 1922 prize awarded to Archibald Hill and Otto Fritz Meyerhof in 1923,[9] the 1926 prize awarded to Johannes Fibiger in 1927,[10] the 1938 prize awarded to Corneille Heymans in 1939,[11] and the 1943 prize awarded to Henrik Dam and Edward Adelbert Doisy in 1944.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n* 1980\n* 1990\n* 2000\n* 2010\n* 2020\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Swedish: *Nobelpriset i fysiologi eller medicin*) is awarded annually by the Swedish Karolinska Institute to scientists in the various fields of physiology or medicine. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by a committee that consists of five members and an executive secretary elected by the Karolinska Institute.[2][3] While commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Medicine, Nobel specifically stated that the prize be awarded for \"physiology or medicine\" in his will. Because of this, the prize can be awarded in a broader range of fields.[3] The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1901 to Emil Adolf von Behring, of Germany. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n115. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2015\".

The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[5]\n\n\nLaureates have won the Nobel Prize in a wide range of fields that relate to physiology or medicine. As of 2009, 8 Prizes have been awarded for contributions in the field of signal transduction by G proteins and second messengers, 13 have been awarded for contributions in the field of neurobiology and 13 have been awarded for contributions in intermediary metabolism.[3] In 1939 Gerhard Domagk, a German, was not allowed by his government to accept the prize. He later received a medal and diploma, but not the money.[6] As of 2021, the prize has been awarded to 224 individuals, twelve of them were women (Gerty Cori being the first to be awarded in 1947).[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1964\".
