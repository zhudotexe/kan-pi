Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. The book has been widely used as the textbook for algorithms courses at many universities[1] and is commonly cited as a reference for algorithms in published papers, with over 10,000 citations documented on CiteSeerX.[2] The book sold half a million copies during its first 20 years.[3] Its fame has led to the common use of the abbreviation \"**CLRS**\" (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein), or, in the first edition, \"**CLR**\" (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest).[4]\n\n\nIn the preface, the authors write about how the book was written to be comprehensive and useful in both teaching and professional environments. Each chapter focuses on an algorithm, and discusses its design techniques and areas of application. Instead of using a specific programming language, the algorithms are written in pseudocode. The descriptions focus on the aspects of the algorithm itself, its mathematical properties, and emphasize efficiency.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Editions[edit]\n\n\nThe first edition of the textbook did not include Stein as an author, and thus the book became known by the initialism CLR. It included two chapters (\"Arithmetic Circuits\" & \"Algorithms for Parallel Computers\") that were dropped in the second edition. After the addition of the fourth author in the second edition, many began to refer to the book as \"CLRS\". This first edition of the book was also known as \"The Big White Book (of Algorithms).\" With the second edition, the predominant color of the cover changed to green, causing the nickname to be shortened to just \"The Big Book (of Algorithms).\"[6] The third edition was published in August 2009. The fourth edition was published in April 2022, which has colors added to improve visual presentations.[7]\n\n\n\n## Cover design[edit]\n\n\nThe mobile depicted on the cover, *Big Red* (1959) by Alexander Calder, can be found at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.[8] *An Introduction to Language* by Fromkin also uses Calder's mobile on its cover.\n\n\n\n## Table of contents[edit]\n\n\nSource[9]\n\n\n\n* I Foundations\n\t+ 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing\n\t+ 2 Getting Started\n\t+ 3 Characterizing Running Times\n\t+ 4 Divide-and-Conquer\n\t+ 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms\n* II Sorting and Order Statistics\n\t+ 6 Heapsort\n\t+ 7 Quicksort\n\t+ 8 Sorting in Linear Time\n\t+ 9 Medians and Order Statistics\n* III Data Structures\n\t+ 10 Elementary Data Structures\n\t+ 11 Hash Tables\n\t+ 12 Binary Search Trees\n\t+ 13 Red-Black Trees\n* IV Advanced Design and Analysis Techniques\n\t+ 14 Dynamic Programming\n\t+ 15 Greedy Algorithms\n\t+ 16 Amortized Analysis\n* V Advanced Data Structures\n\t+ 17 Augmenting Data Structures\n\t+ 18 B-Trees\n\t+ 19 Data Structures for Disjoint Sets\n* VI Graph Algorithms\n\t+ 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms\n\t+ 21 Minimum Spanning Trees\n\t+ 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths\n\t+ 23 All-Pairs Shortest Paths\n\t+ 24 Maximum Flow\n\t+ 25 Matching in Bipartite Graphs\n* VII Selected Topics\n\t+ 26 Parallel Algorithms\n\t+ 27 Online Algorithms\n\t+ 28 Matrix Operations\n\t+ 29 Linear Programming\n\t+ 30 Polynomials and the FFT\n\t+ 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms\n\t+ 32 String Matching\n\t+ 33 Machine-Learning Algorithms\n\t+ 34 NP-Completeness\n\t+ 35 Approximation Algorithms\n* VIII Appendix: Mathematical Background\n\t+ A Summations\n\t+ B Sets, Etc.\n\t+ C Counting and Probability\n\t+ D Matrices\n\n## Publication history[edit]\n\n\n* Cormen, Thomas H.; Leiserson, Charles E.; Rivest, Ronald L.

T. KungJon Bentley |\n|  |\n\n\n**Charles Eric Leiserson** is a computer scientist, specializing in the theory of parallel computing and distributed computing, and particularly practical applications thereof. As part of this effort, he developed the Cilk multithreaded language. He invented the fat-tree interconnection network, a hardware-universal interconnection network used in many supercomputers, including the Connection Machine CM5, for which he was network architect. He helped pioneer the development of VLSI theory, including the retiming method of digital optimization with James B. Saxe and systolic arrays with H. T. Kung. He conceived of the notion of cache-oblivious algorithms, which are algorithms that have no tuning parameters for cache size or cache-line length, but nevertheless use cache near-optimally. He developed the Cilk language for multithreaded programming, which uses a provably good work-stealing algorithm for scheduling. Leiserson coauthored the standard algorithms textbook *Introduction to Algorithms* together with Thomas H. Cormen, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.\n\n\nLeiserson received a BS degree in computer science and mathematics from Yale University in 1975 and a PhD degree in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1981, where his advisors were Jon Bentley and H. T. Kung.[2]\n\n\nHe then joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is now a professor. In addition, he is a principal in the Theory of Computation research group in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and he was formerly director of research and director of system architecture for Akamai Technologies. He was Founder and chief technology officer of Cilk Arts, Inc., a start-up that developed Cilk technology for multicore computing applications. (Cilk Arts, Inc. was acquired by Intel in 2009.)\n\n\nLeiserson's dissertation, *Area-Efficient VLSI Computation*, won the first ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award. In 1985, the National Science Foundation awarded him a Presidential Young Investigator Award. He is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). He received the 2014 Taylor L. Booth Education Award from the IEEE Computer Society \"for worldwide computer science education impact through writing a best-selling algorithms textbook, and developing courses on algorithms and parallel programming.\" He received the 2014 ACM-IEEE Computer Society Ken Kennedy Award for his \"enduring influence on parallel computing systems and their adoption into mainstream use through scholarly research and development.\" He was also cited for \"distinguished mentoring of computer science leaders and students.\" He received the 2013 ACM Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award for \"contributions to robust parallel and distributed computing.\"\n\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Thinking Machines Corporation\n* Thomas H.

(*RC* stands for \"Rivest Cipher\".) He also devised the MD2, MD4, MD5 and MD6 cryptographic hash functions.\n\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nRivest earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Yale University in 1969, and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Stanford University in 1974 for research supervised by Robert W. Floyd.[1]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nAt MIT, Rivest is a member of the Theory of Computation Group, and founder of MIT CSAIL's Cryptography and Information Security Group.\n\n\nRivest was a founder of RSA Data Security (now merged with Security Dynamics to form RSA Security), Verisign, and of Peppercoin.\n\n\nHis former doctoral students include Avrim Blum, Benny Chor, Sally Goldman, Burt Kaliski, Anna Lysyanskaya, Ron Pinter, Robert Schapire, Alan Sherman,[1]\nand Mona Singh.[2]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nRivest is especially known for his research in cryptography. He has also made significant contributions to algorithm design, to the computational complexity of machine learning, and to election security.\n\n\n\n### Cryptography[edit]\n\n\nThe publication of the RSA cryptosystem by Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in 1978[C1] revolutionized modern cryptography by providing the first usable and publicly described method for public-key cryptography. The three authors won the 2002 Turing Award, the top award in computer science, for this work. The award cited \"their ingenious contribution to making public-key cryptography useful in practice\".[6] The same paper that introduced this cryptosystem also introduced Alice and Bob, the fictional heroes of many subsequent cryptographic protocols.[7] In the same year, Rivest, Adleman, and Michael Dertouzos first formulated homomorphic encryption and its applications in secure cloud computing,[C2] an idea that would not come to fruition until over 40 years later when secure homomorphic encryption algorithms were finally developed.[8]\n\n\nRivest was one of the inventors of the GMR public signature scheme, published with Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali in 1988,[C3][9]\nand of ring signatures, an anonymized form of group signatures invented with Shamir and Yael Tauman Kalai in 2001.[C7] He designed the MD4 and MD5 cryptographic hash functions, published in 1990 and 1992 respectively,[C4][C5] and a sequence of symmetric key block ciphers that include RC2, RC4, RC5, and RC6.[C6][C8]\n\n\nOther contributions of Rivest to cryptography include chaffing and winnowing, the interlock protocol for authenticating anonymous key-exchange, cryptographic time capsules such as LCS35 based on anticipated improvements to computation speed through Moore's law, key whitening and its application through the xor\u2013encrypt\u2013xor key mode in extending the Data Encryption Standard to DES-X, and the Peppercoin system for cryptographic micropayments.\n\n\n\n### Algorithms[edit]\n\n\nIn 1973, Rivest and his coauthors published the first selection algorithm that achieved linear time without using randomization.[A1][10] Their algorithm, the median of medians method, is commonly taught in algorithms courses.[11] Rivest is also one of the two namesakes of the Floyd\u2013Rivest algorithm, a randomized selection algorithm that achieves a near-optimal number of comparisons.[A2][12]\n\n\nRivest's 1974 doctoral dissertation concerned the use of hash tables to quickly match partial words in documents; he later published this work as a journal paper.[A3] His research from this time on self-organizing lists[A4] became one of the important precursors to the development of competitive analysis for online algorithms.[13] In the early 1980s, he also published well-cited research on two-dimensional bin packing problems,[A5] and on channel routing in VLSI design.[A6]\n\n\nHe is a co-author of *Introduction to Algorithms* (also known as *CLRS*), a standard textbook on algorithms, with Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson and Clifford Stein. First published in 1990, it has extended into four editions, the latest in 2022.[A7]\n\n\n\n### Learning[edit]\n\n\nIn the problem of decision tree learning, Rivest and Laurent Hyafil proved that it is NP-complete to find a decision tree that identifies each of a collection of objects through binary-valued questions (as in the parlor game of twenty questions) and that minimizes the expected number of questions that will be asked.[L1] With Avrim Blum, Rivest also showed that even for very simple neural networks it can be NP-complete to train the network by finding weights that allow it to solve a given classification task correctly.[L3] Despite these negative results, he also found methods for efficiently inferring decision lists,[L2] decision trees,[L4] and finite automata.[L5]\n\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nA significant topic in Rivest's more recent research has been election security, based on the principle of software independence: that the security of elections should be founded on physical records, so that hidden changes to software used in voting systems cannot result in undetectable changes to election outcomes. His research in this area includes improving the robustness of mix networks in this application,[V1] the 2006 invention of the ThreeBallot paper ballot based end-to-end auditable voting system (which he released into public domain in the interest of promoting democracy),[V2][6] and the development of the Scantegrity security system for optical scan voting systems.[V3]\n\n\nHe was a member of the Election Assistance Commission's Technical Guidelines Development Committee.[14]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\nRivest is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Sciences, and is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, the International Association for Cryptologic Research, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Together with Adi Shamir and Len Adleman, he has been awarded the 2000 IEEE Koji Kobayashi Computers and Communications Award and the Secure Computing Lifetime Achievement Award. He also shared with them the Turing Award. Rivest has received an honorary degree (the \"laurea honoris causa\") from the Sapienza University of Rome.[15] In 2005, he received the MITX Lifetime Achievement Award. Rivest was named in 2007 the Marconi Fellow, and on May 29, 2008, he also gave the Chesley lecture at Carleton College. He was named an Institute Professor at MIT in June 2015.[16]\n\n\n\n## Selected publications[edit]\n\n\nRivest's publications include:\n\n\n\n### Algorithms[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1. | Blum, Manuel; Floyd, Robert W.; Pratt, Vaughan; Rivest, Ronald L.; Tarjan, Robert E.

Stein is chair of the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department at Columbia University. Prior to joining Columbia, Stein was a professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.\n\n\nStein's research interests include the design and analysis of algorithms, combinatorial optimization, operations research, network algorithms, scheduling, algorithm engineering and computational biology.\n\n\nStein has published many influential papers in the leading conferences and journals in his fields of research, and has occupied a variety of editorial positions including in the journals *ACM Transactions on Algorithms*, *Mathematical Programming*, *Journal of Algorithms*, *SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics* and *Operations Research Letters*. His work has been funded by the National Science Foundation and the Sloan Foundation. As of November 1, 2015, his publications have been cited over 46,000 times, and he has an h-index of 42.[2]\n\n\nStein is the winner of several prestigious awards including an NSF Career Award, an Alfred Sloan Research Fellowship and the Karen Wetterhahn Award for Distinguished Creative or Scholarly Achievement. He is also the co-author of two textbooks: \n\n\n\n* *Introduction to Algorithms*, with T. Cormen, C. Leiserson and R. Rivest, which is currently the best-selling textbook in algorithms and has been translated into 8 languages. About 39,500 of Stein's 46,000 citations are made to this book.\n* *Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science*, with Ken Bogart and Scot Drysdale, which is a new textbook that covers discrete math at an undergraduate level.\n\n\nStein earned his B.S.E. from Princeton University in 1987, a Master of Science from The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1989, and a PhD also from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1992.[3][4]\n\n\nIn recent years, Stein has built up close ties with the Norwegian research community which earned him an honorary doctorate from the University of Oslo (May 2010).\n\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* Cormen, Thomas H.; Leiserson, Charles E.; Rivest, Ronald L.; Stein, Clifford (2001). *Introduction to Algorithms* (second\u00a0ed.).
