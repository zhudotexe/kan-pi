Seven people including only one Republican have served as a U.S. senator from Hawaii. The state's current U.S. senators are Democrats Brian Schatz and Mazie Hirono. Hawaii's class 1 seat is the only one in the United States that has always been held by an ethnic minority.[*citation needed*] Its class 3 seat is the only one in the United States that has always been held by a member of the Democratic Party.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHawaii last elected a Republican in 1970, which has resulted in the longest streak in the nation for a state's having all-Democratic senators. Daniel K. Inouye was Hawaii's longest-serving senator, from 1963 to 2012.\n\n\n\n## List of senators[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  **Class 1**Class 1 U.S. senators belong to the electoral cycle that has recently been contested in 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2018.

Mark Hatfield was the state's longest serving senator (1967\u20131997).\n\n\nPrior to 1906, U.S. senators were elected by the Oregon Legislative Assembly. In 1904, Oregon voters passed a ballot measure that required U.S. senators to be selected by a popular vote and then endorsed by the state legislature. Beginning in 1914, U.S. senators were directly elected by popular vote on the basis of the 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution.[1][2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## List of senators[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Initiative, Referendum and Recall Introduction\". *Oregon Blue Book*.
