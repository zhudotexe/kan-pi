The championship has been awarded every four years since 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, when it was not held because of World War II.\n\n\nThe World Cup final match is the last of the competition, played by the only two teams remaining in contention, and the result determines which country is declared the world champion. It is a one-off match decided in regulation time. In case of a draw, extra time is used. If scores are then still level, a penalty shoot-out determines the winner,[1] under the rules in force since 1986; prior to that, finals still tied after extra time would have been replayed,[n 1] though this never proved necessary. The golden goal rule would have applied during extra time in 1998 and 2002, but was not put in practice either.\n\n\nThe only exception to this type of format was the 1950 World Cup, which featured a final round-robin group of four teams; the decisive match of that group is often regarded as the *de facto* final of that tournament, including by FIFA itself.[3]\n\n\nThe team that wins the final receives the FIFA World Cup Trophy, and its name is engraved on the bottom side of the trophy.[4] Of 80 different nations that have appeared in the tournament, 13 have made it to the final, and 8 have won. Brazil, the only team that has participated in every World Cup, is also the most successful team in the competition, having won five titles and finished second twice.[5] Italy and Germany[n 2] have four titles each, with Germany having reached more finals than any other team, eight. Current champion Argentina has three titles, Uruguay and France have two each, while England and Spain have one each. Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Sweden, the Netherlands and Croatia have played in the final without winning. Only teams from Europe (UEFA) and South America (CONMEBOL) have ever competed in the final.\n\n\nArgentina defeated France on penalties in the latest final, staged at Qatar's Lusail Stadium in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## List of final matches[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![List of FIFA World Cup finals is located in Europe](image)![London (1966)](image)\n**London(1966)**\n![Paris (1938,

Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country by area and the seventh most populous. Its capital is Brasília, and its most populous city is São Paulo. The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states and the Federal District. It is the only country in the Americas to have Portuguese as an official language.[10][11] It is one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world,[12] and the most populous Roman Catholic-majority country.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrazil's current constitution, formulated in 1988, defines it as a democratic federal republic.[15] Due to its rich culture and history, the country ranks thirteenth in the world by number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrazil is a regional and middle power[17][18][19] and is also classified as an emerging power and a major non-NATO ally.[20][21][22][23][24] Categorised as a developing country with a high Human Development Index,[25] Brazil is considered an advanced emerging economy,[26] having the ninth largest GDP in the world by nominal, and eighth by PPP measures, the largest in Latin America.[6][27] As an upper-middle income economy by the World Bank[28] and a newly industrialized country,[29] Brazil has the largest share of global wealth in South America and it is one of the world's major breadbaskets, being the largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years.[30] However, the country retains noticeable corruption, crime and social inequality. Brazil is a founding member of the United Nations, the G20, BRICS, G4, Mercosul, Organization of American States, Organization of Ibero-American States and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries.

They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters. They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice. Despite this, states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in other federal states such as the United States. For example, criminal and civil laws can be voted by only the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBRICS\n |\n| --- |\n| Membership | * ![Brazil](image) Brazil\n* ![Russia](image) Russia\n* ![India](image) India\n* ![China](image) China\n* ![South Africa](image) South Africa\n* ![](image) Egypt Egypt\n* ![](image) Ethiopia\n* ![](image) Iran\n* ![](image) United Arab Emirates\n |\n| Summits | 1.

Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Independence was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system. The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature, now called the National Congress. Slavery was abolished in 1888. The country became a presidential republic in 1889 following a military coup d'état. An authoritarian military dictatorship emerged in 1964 and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe official language of Brazil is Portuguese (Article 13 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Brazil), which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers, radio, television, and for business and administrative purposes. Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity and giving it a national culture distinct from those of its Spanish-speaking neighbors.[396]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrazil's constitution also provides for the creation of federal territories, which are administrative divisions directly controlled by the federal government. However, there are currently no federal territories in the country, as the 1988 Constitution abolished the last three: Amapá and Roraima (which gained statehood status) and Fernando de Noronha, which became a state district of Pernambuco.[245][246]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Brazil\n\nSee also: Brazilian real, Agriculture in Brazil, Mining in Brazil, and Industry in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nSão Paulo, the largest financial centre in Brazil\n![](image)\nB3, the largest stock exchange of Latin America by market capitalization\n![](image)\nSoybean crop in Rondonópolis, Mato Grosso[247]\n![](image)\nThe KC-390, developed by Embraer, the third largest producer of civil aircraft, after Boeing and Airbus[248]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n*AtlanticOcean*\n\n*PacificOcean*\n\nNorth\n\nNortheast\n\nCentral-West\n\nSoutheast\n\nSouth\n\nAcre\n\nAmazonas\n\nPará\n\nRoraima\n\nAmapá\n\nRondônia\n\nTocantins\n\nMaranhão\n\nBahia\n\nPiauí\n\nCeará\n\nRio Grandedo Norte\n\nParaíba\n\nPernambuco\n\nAlagoas\n\nSergipe\n\nMato Grosso\n\nMato Grossodo Sul\n\nFederalDistrict\n\nGoiás\n\nMinas Gerais\n\nSão Paulo\n\nRio de Janeiro\n\nEspírito Santo\n\nParaná\n\nSanta Catarina\n\nRio Grandedo Sul\n\n*Argentina*\n\n*Bolivia*\n\n*Chile*\n\n*Colombia*\n\n*French Guiana*\n\n*Guyana*\n\n*Paraguay*\n\n*Peru*\n\n*Suriname*\n\n*Uruguay*\n\n*Venezuela*\nStates of Brazil and Regions of Brazil |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)National Congress, seat of the legislative branch\n![](image)Palácio do Planalto, the official workplace of the President of Brazil\nThe form of government is a democratic federative republic, with a presidential system.[15] The president is both head of state and head of government of the Union and is elected for a four-year term,[15] with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term.

The National Congress is the Federation's bicameral legislature, consisting of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate. Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively. In 2021, the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index categorized Brazil as a \"flawed democracy\", ranking 46th in the report,[206] and Freedom House classified it as a free country at *Freedom in the World* report.[207]\n\n\nThe political-administrative organization of the Federative Republic of Brazil comprises the Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities.[15] The Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities, are the \"spheres of government\". The federation is set on five fundamental principles: sovereignty, citizenship, dignity of human beings, the social values of labor and freedom of enterprise, and political pluralism.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Geography of Brazil\n\n![](image)\nSerra dos Órgãos National Park, Teresópolis, Rio de Janeiro state\n![](image)\nThe majority of Amazon rainforest is contained within Brazil\n\nBrazil occupies a large area along the eastern coast of South America and includes much of the continent's interior,[175] sharing land borders with Uruguay to the south; Argentina and Paraguay to the southwest; Bolivia and Peru to the west; Colombia to the northwest; and Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and France (French overseas region of French Guiana) to the north. It shares a border with every South American country except Ecuador and Chile.[13]\n\n\nThe brazilian territory also encompasses a number of oceanic archipelagos, such as Fernando de Noronha, Rocas Atoll, Saint Peter and Paul Rocks, and Trindade and Martim Vaz.[13] Its size, relief, climate, and natural resources make Brazil geographically diverse.[175] Including its Atlantic islands, Brazil lies between latitudes 6°N and 34°S, and longitudes 28° and 74°W.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe classic tripartite branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial under a checks and balances system) are formally established by the Constitution.[15] The executive and legislative are organized independently in all three spheres of government, while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state and Federal District spheres. All members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected.[208][209][210]\n\n\nFor most of its democratic history, Brazil has had a multi-party system, with proportional representation. Voting is compulsory for the literate between 18 and 70 years old and optional for illiterates and those between 16 and 18 or beyond 70.[15] The country has more than 40 active political parties. Fifteen political parties are represented in Congress. It is common for politicians to switch parties, and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly.[211]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Ulysses Guimarães holding the Constitution of 1988\nCivilians returned to power in 1985 when José Sarney assumed the presidency. He became unpopular during his tenure through failure to control the economic crisis and hyperinflation he inherited from the military regime.[152] Sarney's unsuccessful government led to the election in 1989 of the almost-unknown Fernando Collor, who was subsequently impeached by the National Congress in 1992.[153] Collor was succeeded by his vice-president, Itamar Franco, who appointed Fernando Henrique Cardoso Minister of Finance. In 1994, Cardoso produced a highly successful Plano Real,[154] that, after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation, finally stabilized the Brazilian economy.[155][156] Cardoso won the 1994 election, and again in 1998.[157]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Declaration of the Brazilian independence by Pedro I on 7 September 1822\nTensions between Portuguese and Brazilians increased and the Portuguese Cortes, guided by the new political regime imposed by the Liberal Revolution, tried to re-establish Brazil as a colony.[83] The Brazilians refused to yield, and Prince Pedro decided to stand with them, declaring the country's independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822.[84] A month later, Prince Pedro was declared the first Emperor of Brazil, with the royal title of Dom Pedro I, resulting in the founding of the Empire of Brazil.[85]\n\n\nThe Brazilian War of Independence, which had already begun along this process, spread through the northern, northeastern regions and in the Cisplatina province.[86] The last Portuguese soldiers surrendered on 8 March 1824;[87] Portugal officially recognized Brazilian independence on 29 August 1825.[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Organization | * Executive Secretariat\n* Flag of the CPLP\n* CPLP Games\n |\n| CPLP Summits | * I – Lisbon\n* II – Praia\n* III – Maputo\n* IV – Brasília\n* V – São Tomé\n* VI – Bissau\n* VII – Lisbon\n* VIII – Luanda\n* IX – Maputo\n* X – Díli\n* XI – Brasília\n* XII – Ilha do Sal\n* XIII – Luanda\n* XIV – São Tomé\n* XIV – Bissau\n |\n| Culture | * Portuguese language\n* Portuguese literature\n* Lusophone\n* Lusophone music\n |\n| * ACOLOP\n\t+ Lusophony Games\n* Countries with Portuguese as an official language\n* International organizations with Portuguese as an official languages\n* ![](image) Category\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUnion of South American Nations\n |\n| --- |\n| Members | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Full Members | * Bolivia\n* Guyana\n* Suriname\n* Venezuela\n |\n| Suspended Members | * Argentina\n* Brazil\n* Chile\n* Colombia\n* Ecuador\n* Paraguay\n* Peru\n* Uruguay\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough there was no desire among the majority of Brazilians to change the country's form of government,[99] on 15 November 1889, in disagreement with the majority of the Imperial Army officers, as well as with rural and financial elites (for different reasons), the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup.[100] A few days later, the national flag was replaced with a new design that included the national motto \"*Ordem e Progresso*\", influenced by positivism. 15 November is now Republic Day, a national holiday.[101]\n\n\n\n### Early republic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: First Brazilian Republic, Vargas Era, and Second Brazilian Republic\n\n![](image)\n*Proclamation of the Republic*, 1893, oil on canvas by Benedito Calixto\n![](image)\nGetúlio Vargas (*center*) during the Revolution of 1930\n![](image)\nBrazilian Expeditionary Force in Massarosa, Italy, during WWII\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** Gratius, Susanne (April 2008). \"The international arena and emerging powers: stabilising or destabilising forces?\" (PDF). *FRIDE*.

Brazil is a founding member of the United Nations, the G20, BRICS, G4, Mercosul, Organization of American States, Organization of Ibero-American States and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries.

Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Independence was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system. The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature, now called the National Congress. Slavery was abolished in 1888. The country became a presidential republic in 1889 following a military coup d'état. An authoritarian military dictatorship emerged in 1964 and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Brazil** at Wikipedia's sister projects\n\n* ![](image)Definitions from Wiktionary\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)News from Wikinews\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Texts from Wikisource\n* ![](image)Textbooks from Wikibooks\n* ![](image)Resources from Wikiversity\n* ![](image)Travel information from Wikivoyage\n* ![](image)Data from Wikidata\n\n**Government**\n\n\n\n* Brazilian Federal Government\n* Official Tourist Guide of Brazil\n* Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics\n* ![](image) Wikimedia Atlas of Brazil\n* ![](image) Geographic data related to Brazil at OpenStreetMap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBrazil articles\n |\n| --- |\n| History | * Timeline\n* Indigenous peoples\n* Colonial Brazil (1500–1815)\n* United Kingdom (1815–1822)\n* Empire (1822–1889)\n* First (Old) Republic (1889–1930)\n* Vargas Era (1930–1946)\n* Fourth Republic (1946–1964)\n* Military dictatorship (1964–1985)\n* Sixth (New) Republic (1985–present)\n |\n| Geography | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Topics related to Brazil\n |\n| --- |\n| | ![](image) Geographic locale\n |\n| --- |\n| **Lat. and Long. 15°45′S 47°57′W﻿ / ﻿15.750°S 47.950°W﻿ / -15.750; -47.950 (Brasilia)**\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCountries and dependencies of South America\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereignstates | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Entire | * Argentina\n* Bolivia\n* Brazil\n* Chile\n* Colombia\n* Ecuador\n* Guyana\n* Paraguay\n* Peru\n* Suriname\n* Uruguay\n* Venezuela\n |\n| In part | * France\n\t+ French Guiana\n |\n\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Dependencies | * Falkland Islands / South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\n\t+ UK\n |\n |\n\n| International membership\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nCommunity of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP)\n |\n| --- |\n| Membership | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring World War II, Brazil remained neutral until August 1942, when the country suffered retaliation by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in a strategic dispute over the South Atlantic, and, therefore, entered the war on the allied side.[129][130][131] In addition to its participation in the battle of the Atlantic, Brazil also sent an expeditionary force to fight in the Italian campaign.[132]\n\n\nWith the Allied victory in 1945 and the end of the fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas's position became unsustainable, and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup, with democracy \"reinstated\" by the same army that had ended it 15 years earlier.[133] Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis, after having returned to power by election in 1950.[134][135]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary era[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Military dictatorship in Brazil and History of Brazil since 1985\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBRICS\n |\n| --- |\n| Membership | * ![Brazil](image) Brazil\n* ![Russia](image) Russia\n* ![India](image) India\n* ![China](image) China\n* ![South Africa](image) South Africa\n* ![](image) Egypt Egypt\n* ![](image) Ethiopia\n* ![](image) Iran\n* ![](image) United Arab Emirates\n |\n| Summits | 1.

They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters. They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice. Despite this, states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in other federal states such as the United States. For example, criminal and civil laws can be voted by only the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)National Congress, seat of the legislative branch\n![](image)Palácio do Planalto, the official workplace of the President of Brazil\nThe form of government is a democratic federative republic, with a presidential system.[15] The president is both head of state and head of government of the Union and is elected for a four-year term,[15] with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term. The current president is Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.[205] The President appoints the Ministers of State, who assist in government.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough there was no desire among the majority of Brazilians to change the country's form of government,[99] on 15 November 1889, in disagreement with the majority of the Imperial Army officers, as well as with rural and financial elites (for different reasons), the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup.[100] A few days later, the national flag was replaced with a new design that included the national motto \"*Ordem e Progresso*\", influenced by positivism. 15 November is now Republic Day, a national holiday.[101]\n\n\n\n### Early republic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: First Brazilian Republic, Vargas Era, and Second Brazilian Republic\n\n![](image)\n*Proclamation of the Republic*, 1893, oil on canvas by Benedito Calixto\n![](image)\nGetúlio Vargas (*center*) during the Revolution of 1930\n![](image)\nBrazilian Expeditionary Force in Massarosa, Italy, during WWII\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrazil's constitution also provides for the creation of federal territories, which are administrative divisions directly controlled by the federal government.

It shares a border with every South American country except Ecuador and Chile.[13]\n\n\nThe brazilian territory also encompasses a number of oceanic archipelagos, such as Fernando de Noronha, Rocas Atoll, Saint Peter and Paul Rocks, and Trindade and Martim Vaz.[13] Its size, relief, climate, and natural resources make Brazil geographically diverse.[175] Including its Atlantic islands, Brazil lies between latitudes 6°N and 34°S, and longitudes 28° and 74°W.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe classic tripartite branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial under a checks and balances system) are formally established by the Constitution.[15] The executive and legislative are organized independently in all three spheres of government, while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state and Federal District spheres. All members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected.[208][209][210]\n\n\nFor most of its democratic history, Brazil has had a multi-party system, with proportional representation. Voting is compulsory for the literate between 18 and 70 years old and optional for illiterates and those between 16 and 18 or beyond 70.[15] The country has more than 40 active political parties. Fifteen political parties are represented in Congress.

In 2021, the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index categorized Brazil as a \"flawed democracy\", ranking 46th in the report,[206] and Freedom House classified it as a free country at *Freedom in the World* report.[207]\n\n\nThe political-administrative organization of the Federative Republic of Brazil comprises the Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities.[15] The Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities, are the \"spheres of government\". The federation is set on five fundamental principles: sovereignty, citizenship, dignity of human beings, the social values of labor and freedom of enterprise, and political pluralism.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nVolleyball, basketball, auto racing, and martial arts also attract large audiences. The Brazil men's national volleyball team, for example, currently holds the titles of the World League, World Grand Champions Cup, World Championship and the World Cup. In auto racing, three Brazilian drivers have won the Formula One world championship eight times.[481][482][483] The country has also produced significant achievements in other sports such as sailing, swimming, tennis, surfing, skateboarding, MMA, gymnastics, boxing, judo, athletics and table tennis.\n\n\nSome sport variations have their origins in Brazil: beach football,[484] futsal (indoor football)[485] and footvolley emerged in Brazil as variations of football. In martial arts, Brazilians developed Capoeira,[486] Vale tudo,[487] and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.[488]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)\nBrazilian Air Force Saab Gripen NG\n![](image)\nBrazilian Navy's flagship PHM *Atlântico* and frigate *Liberal* (F-43) (background)\n\nThe armed forces of Brazil are the largest in Latin America by active personnel and the largest in terms of military equipment.[217] The country was considered the 9th largest military power on the planet in 2021.[218][219] It consists of the Brazilian Army (including the Army Aviation Command), the Brazilian Navy (including the Marine Corps and Naval Aviation), and the Brazilian Air Force. Brazil's conscription policy gives it one of the world's largest military forces, estimated at more than 1.6 million reservists annually.[220]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Lamoureux, Andrew Jackson; and three others (1911). \"Brazil\" . *Encyclopædia Britannica*.

The team's worst results in the competition were first-round eliminations in 2002 and 2010. In 2002, the team suffered an unexpected loss to Senegal and departed the tournament without scoring a goal, while in 2010, a French team torn apart by conflict between the players and staff lost two of three matches and drew the other.[82][83]\n\n\nIn 2014, France advanced to the quarterfinal before losing 1–0 to the eventual champion, Germany. Four years later, France defeated Croatia 4–2 in the final match and won the World Cup for the second time.[84] In 2022, France finished runners-up to Argentina, losing 4–2 on penalties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the 2022 FIFA World Cup, France looked to defend their title in Qatar.[54] After finishing top of their group, France did manage to reach a second successive World Cup final, defeating Poland, England and Morocco in the knockout stages.[55] However, they were defeated on penalties by Argentina after a thrilling 3–3 draw.[56]\n\n\n\n## Home stadium[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Stade de France, Parc des Princes, and INF Clairefontaine\n\nDuring France's early years, the team's national stadium alternated between the Parc des Princes in Paris and the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir in Colombes. France also hosted matches at the Stade Pershing, Stade de Paris, and the Stade Buffalo, but to a minimal degree. As the years moved forward, France began hosting matches outside the city of Paris at such venues as the Stade Marcel Saupin in Nantes, the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, the Stade de Gerland in Lyon, and the Stade de la Meinau in Strasbourg.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFounded in 1904, the team has won two FIFA World Cups, two UEFA European Championships, two FIFA Confederations Cups, one Olympic Games, one CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, and one UEFA Nations League title. France was one of the four European teams that participated in the first World Cup in 1930. Twenty-eight years later, the team led by Raymond Kopa and Just Fontaine, finished in third place at the 1958 World Cup. France experienced much of its success in three different eras: in the 1980s, from the 1990s to early 2000s, and during the late 2010s. In 1984, under the leadership of the three-time Ballon d'Or winner Michel Platini, France won Euro 1984 (its first official title), a CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup (1985), and reached two World Cup semi-finals (1982 and 1986).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA decade later, the team reached the final of Euro 2016, where they lost 1–0 to Portugal in extra time. Two years after that, France won the 2018 World Cup, its second title in that competition. After winning the 2021 Nations League, they became the first, and so far, the only European national team to have won every senior FIFA and UEFA competition.[3][4] France is also one of the only two countries, the other being Brazil, to have won all men's FIFA 11-player competitions at all age levels,[5][6][7][8][9] having claimed both the FIFA World Cup, FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, the now-defunct FIFA Confederations Cup, and Olympics titles, as well as the first to complete the collection, after the U-20 national team captured the first U-20 World Cup title in 2013.[7]\n\n\nFrance has footballing rivalries[10] with Belgium,[11] Brazil,[12] England,[13] Germany,[14] Italy,[15] and Spain.[16]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the France national football team\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"The FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking\". *FIFA*. 4 April 2024.

Dominique Rocheteau and José Touré scored the goals. In a span of a year, France were holders of three of the four major international trophies. At the 1986 World Cup, France were among the favorites to win the competition. For the second consecutive World Cup, they reached the semi-finals and faced West Germany. Again, they were defeated by Germany but achieved third place with a 4–2 victory over Belgium.\n\n\nIn 1988, the FFF opened the Clairefontaine National Football Institute.

Klose scored a goal to level Germany 2–2, his 15th World Cup goal to join former Brazil striker Ronaldo at the pinnacle of World Cup Finals scorers.

Germany won also a Confederations Cup (2017).[11] They have also been runners-up at the European Championship three times, and four times at the World Cup, with a further four third-place finishes at the World Cup.[11] East Germany won Olympic Gold in 1976.[15] Germany is one of only two nations to have won both the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup (the other being Spain).[16][17] By combined World Cups, Germany stands as the most successful football nation in history with six World Cups – four for the men's team and two for the women's. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Germany posing with Champions banner after 2014 FIFA World Cup Final\nThe 7–1 semi-final win against Brazil was one of the most memorable games in World Cup history; Germany scored four goals in just less than seven minutes and were 5–0 up by the 30th minute with goals from Thomas Müller, Miroslav Klose, Sami Khedira and two from Toni Kroos. Germany's 7–0 in the second half was the highest score against Brazil in a single game. Germany conceded a late goal to Brazil's Oscar. It was Brazil's worst ever World Cup defeat,[115] whilst Germany broke multiple World Cup records with the win, including the record broken by Klose, the first team to reach four consecutive World Cup semi-finals, the first team to score seven goals in a World Cup Finals knockout phase game, the fastest five consecutive goals in World Cup history (four of which in just 400 seconds), and the first team to score five goals in the first half in a World Cup semi-final.[116]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGermany squad – 2006 FIFA World Cup third place\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1 Lehmann\n* 2 Jansen\n* 3 Friedrich\n* 4 Huth\n* 5 Kehl\n* 6 Nowotny\n* 7 Schweinsteiger\n* 8 Frings\n* 9 Hanke\n* 10 Neuville\n* 11 Klose\n* 12 Kahn\n* 13 Ballack (c)\n* 14 Asamoah\n* 15 Hitzlsperger\n* 16 Lahm\n* 17 Mertesacker\n* 18 Borowski\n* 19 Schneider\n* 20 Podolski\n* 21 Metzelder\n* 22 Odonkor\n* 23 Hildebrand\n* Coach: Klinsmann\n | ![Germany](image)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGermany squad – 2010 FIFA World Cup third place\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1 Neuer\n* 2 Jansen\n* 3 Friedrich\n* 4 Aogo\n* 5 Tasci\n* 6 Khedira\n* 7 Schweinsteiger\n* 8 Özil\n* 9 Kießling\n* 10 Podolski\n* 11 Klose\n* 12 Wiese\n* 13 Müller\n* 14 Badstuber\n* 15 Trochowski\n* 16 Lahm (c)\n* 17 Mertesacker\n* 18 Kroos\n* 19 Cacau\n* 20 Boateng\n* 21 Marin\n* 22 Butt\n* 23 Gómez\n* Coach: Löw\n | ![Germany](image)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt Euro 2020 (delayed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), Germany were drawn with World Cup champions France (to whom they lost 1–0) and reigning European champions Portugal (whom they defeated 4–2, albeit with the help of two Portuguese own goals), with each group having only two guaranteed qualifiers for the next phase, plus a chance for the third-placed team.

Its natural harbor soon developed into a commercial area competing with Río de la Plata's capital, Buenos Aires.[31] Uruguay's early 19th-century history was shaped by ongoing fights for dominance in the Platine region,[31] between British, Spanish, Portuguese and other colonial forces. In 1806 and 1807, the British army attempted to seize Buenos Aires and Montevideo as part of the Napoleonic Wars.

The Spanish founded Montevideo as a military stronghold in the early 18th century because of the competing claims over the region. Uruguay won its independence between 1811 and 1828, following a four-way struggle between Portugal and Spain, and later Argentina and Brazil.

The formal coalition ended in November 2002, when the Blancos withdrew their ministers from the cabinet,[31] although the Blancos continued to support the Colorados on most issues. Low commodity prices and economic difficulties in Uruguay's main export markets (starting in Brazil with the devaluation of the real, then in Argentina in 2002), caused a severe recession; the economy contracted by 11%, unemployment climbed to 21%, and the percentage of Uruguayans in poverty rose to over 30%.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe highest point in the country is the Cerro Catedral, whose peak reaches 514 metres (1,686 ft) AMSL in the *Sierra Carapé* hill range.

In response to the annexation, the Thirty-Three Orientals, led by Juan Antonio Lavalleja, declared independence on 25 August 1825 supported by the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (present-day Argentina).[31] This led to the 500-day-long Cisplatine War. Neither side gained the upper hand and in 1828 the Treaty of Montevideo, fostered by the United Kingdom through the diplomatic efforts of Viscount John Ponsonby, gave birth to Uruguay as an independent state. 25 August is celebrated as Independence Day, a national holiday.[33] The nation's first constitution was adopted on 18 July 1830.[31]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Uruguayan Civil War and Uruguayan War\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUruguay experienced a major economic and financial crisis between 1999 and 2002, principally a spillover effect from the economic problems of Argentina.[52] The economy contracted by 11%, and unemployment climbed to 21%.[52] Despite the severity of the trade shocks, Uruguay's financial indicators remained more stable than those of its neighbours, a reflection of its solid reputation among investors and its investment-grade sovereign bond rating, one of only two in South America.[97][*needs update*]\n\n\nIn 2004, the Batlle government signed a three-year $1.1 billion stand-by arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), committing the country to a substantial primary fiscal surplus, low inflation, considerable reductions in external debt, and several structural reforms designed to improve competitiveness and attract foreign investment.[52] Uruguay terminated the agreement in 2006 following the early repayment of its debt but maintained a number of the policy commitments.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Independence from Brazil\n |\n|  |\n| • Declared\n | 25 August 1825 |\n| • Recognized\n | 27 August 1828 |\n| • Current constitution\n | 15 February 1967 |\n|  |\n| Area  |\n| • Total\n | 176,215 km2 (68,037 sq mi)[6] (89th) |\n| • Water (%)\n | 1.5 |\n| Population |\n| • 2011 census\n | 3,286,314[6] (131st) |\n| • Density\n | 19.8/km2 (51.3/sq mi) (206th) |\n| GDP (PPP) | 2023 estimate |\n| • Total\n | ![Increase](image) $103.372 billion[7] (98th) |\n| • Per capita\n | ![Increase](image) $28,983[7] (62nd) |\n| GDP (nominal) | 2023 estimate |\n| • Total\n | ![Increase](image) $76.244 billion[7] (80th) |\n| • Per capita\n | ![Increase](image) $21,377[7] (49th) |\n| Gini (2021) | ![Negative increase](image) 40.8[8]medium |\n| HDI (2021) | ![Decrease](image) 0.809[9]very high (58th) |\n| Currency | Uruguayan peso (UYU) |\n| Time zone | UTC−3 (UYT) |\n| Date format | dd/mm/yyyy |\n| Driving side | right |\n| Calling code | +598 |\n| ISO 3166 code | UY |\n| Internet TLD | .uy |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1938, general elections were held and Terra's brother-in-law, General Alfredo Baldomir, was elected president. Under pressure from organized labor and the National Party, Baldomir advocated free elections, freedom of the press, and a new constitution.[44] Although Baldomir declared Uruguay neutral in 1939, British warships and the German ship *Admiral Graf Spee* fought a battle not far off Uruguay's coast.[44] The *Admiral Graf Spee* took refuge in Montevideo, claiming sanctuary in a neutral port, but was later ordered out.[44]\n\n\nIn the late 1950s, partly because of a worldwide decrease in demand for Uruguayan agricultural products, Uruguayans suffered from a steep drop in their standard of living, which led to student militancy and labor unrest. An armed group of Marxist–Leninist urban guerrillas, known as the Tupamaros emerged in the 1960s, engaging in activities such as bank robbery, kidnapping and assassination, in addition to attempting an overthrow of the government.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_8RzPOGd06hTprncMuGNuBmaa","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
