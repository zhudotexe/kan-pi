The team is a member of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL) and is one of the Original Six teams of the NHL. There have been 39 head coaches in their franchise history; one during the era of the Toronto Arenas (1917–1919), seven during the era of the Toronto St. Patricks (1919–1927) and the rest under the Toronto Maple Leafs (1927–present).[1] Five Maple Leafs coaches have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as players: Dick Irvin, Joe Primeau, King Clancy, Red Kelly, and Dick Duff[2] while five others have been inducted as builders: Conn Smythe, Hap Day, Punch Imlach, Roger Neilson, and Pat Quinn.[3]\n\n\nFrank Carroll (brother of the team's first NHL coach, Dick Carroll) has the highest winning percentage of any Maple Leafs coach, with a .625 record from the 24 games he coached in his single 1920–21 season. Neither Mike Rodden nor interim coach Dick Duff, who coached only two games each in 1927 and 1980 respectively, won a game with the team. Dan Maloney has the worst record of any who coached more than a season, with a .328 winning percentage from 160 games. Punch Imlach coached the most games of any Maple Leafs coach with 750 games from 1959 to 1969.[1] Pat Burns is the franchise's only coach to win the Jack Adams Award awarded to the head coach \"adjudged to have contributed the most to his team's success.\" Pat Quinn also won the award, but with two teams prior to coaching the Maple Leafs.[4]\n\n\nThe current head coach is Sheldon Keefe, who became the 40th head coach in franchise history on November 20, 2019.[5]\n\n\nSheldon Keefe is the only living person who has coached the Toronto Maple Leafs to a playoff series win. Red Kelly, who passed in 2019, had been the last surviving among Leafs (head) coaches to win at least one playoff series.\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **#** | Number of coaches–a running total of the number of coaches, any coach who has two or more separate terms is only counted once.\n |\n| **GC** | Games coached\n |\n| **W** | Wins\n |\n| **L** | Losses\n |\n| **T** | Ties\n |\n| **OT** | Overtime/shootout losses\n |\n| **Win%** | Winning percentage |\n| **\\*** | Elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame |\n| **†** | Spent entire NHL head coaching career with the Maple Leafs\n |\n| !\n | Also Played For The Leafs\n |\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\n*Statistics are up to date as of the 2019–20 season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| #\n | Name\n | Term\n | Regular season\n | Playoffs\n | Awards\n | Reference\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GC\n | W\n | L\n | T/OT\n | Win%\n | GC\n | W\n | L\n | T\n |\n| **Toronto Arenas** |\n| 1\n | Dick Carroll† | 1917–1919 | 40\n | 18\n | 22\n | 0\n | .450\n | 2\n | 1\n | 1\n | 0\n | Stanley Cup (1918)\n | [6] |\n| **Toronto St. Patricks** |\n| 2\n | Frank Heffernan† | 1919–1920 | 12\n | 5\n | 7\n | 0\n | .417\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  | [7] |\n| 3\n | Harvey Sproule† | 1920 | 12\n | 7\n | 5\n | 0\n | .583\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  | [8] |\n| 4\n | Frank Carroll† | 1920–1921 | 24\n | 15\n | 9\n | 0\n | .625\n | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n | 0\n |  | [9] |\n| 5\n | George O'Donoghue† | 1921–1923 | 29\n | 15\n | 13\n | 1\n | .534\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | Stanley Cup (1922)\n | [10] |\n| 6\n | Charles Querrie† | 1923–1924 | 43\n | 21\n | 21\n | 1\n | .500\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  | [11] |\n| 7\n | Eddie Powers† | 1924–1926 | 66\n | 31\n | 32\n | 3\n | .492\n | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n | 0\n |  | [12] |\n| —\n | Charles Querrie† | 1926–1927 | 29\n | 8\n | 17\n | 4\n | .345\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  | [11] |\n| 8\n | Mike Rodden† | 1927 | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n | 0\n | .000\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  | [13] |\n| **Toronto Maple Leafs** |\n| 9\n | Alex Romeril† | 1927 | 13\n | 7\n | 5\n | 1\n | .577\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  | [14] |\n| 10\n | Conn Smythe\\*\n | 1927–1930 | 134\n | 57\n | 57\n | 20\n | .500\n | 4\n | 2\n | 2\n | 0\n |  | [15] |\n| 11\n | Art Duncan | 1930–1931 | 47\n | 21\n | 16\n | 10\n | .553\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n |  | [1] |\n| —\n | Conn Smythe\\* (interim)\n | 1931 | 1\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1.000\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  |  |\n| 12\n | Dick Irvin\\*\n | 1931–1940 | 427\n | 216\n | 152\n | 59\n | .576\n | 66\n | 33\n | 32\n | 1\n | Stanley Cup (1932)\n | [16] |\n| 13\n | Hap Day\\*! | 1940–1950 | 546\n | 259\n | 206\n | 81\n | .557\n | 80\n | 49\n | 31\n | 0\n | Stanley Cup (1942, 1945, 1947–49)\n | [17] |\n| 14\n | Joe Primeau\\*! | 1950–1953 | 210\n | 97\n | 71\n | 42\n | .562\n | 15\n | 8\n | 6\n | 1\n | Stanley Cup (1951)\n | [18] |\n| 15\n | King Clancy\\*! | 1953–1956 | 210\n | 80\n | 81\n | 49\n | .498\n | 14\n | 2\n | 12\n | 0\n |  | [19] |\n| 16\n | Howie Meeker†! | 1956–1957 | 70\n | 21\n | 34\n | 15\n | .407\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  | [20] |\n| 17\n | Billy Reay | 1957–1958 | 90\n | 26\n | 50\n | 14\n | .367\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  | [21] |\n| 18\n | Punch Imlach\\*\n | 1958–1969 | 760\n | 365\n | 270\n | 125\n | .569\n | 89\n | 44\n | 45\n | 0\n | Stanley Cup (1962–64, 1967)\n | [22] |\n| —\n | King Clancy\\*!

The Devils had 17 different head coaches since the team moved to New Jersey in the 1982–83, with Jacques Lemaire serving as coach three times and Tom McVie, Larry Robinson, and Lou Lamoriello each serving twice. \n\n\nThree coaches have led the team to a victory in the Stanley Cup Finals: Lemaire in 1995, Robinson in 2000, and Pat Burns in 2003. Lemaire is the all-time leader in games coached and wins, while Burns leads in winning percentage (with at least one full season coached). \n\n\nSeveral former players have worked for the Devils as assistant coaches, including John MacLean and Bobby Carpenter, the only men whose names are inscribed on the Stanley Cup as both a player and a coach with New Jersey. MacLean later served as head coach and is the only former Devils' player to serve in that capacity.\n\n\nOn December 26, 2014, after the firing of DeBoer, head coaching responsibilities were split between Adam Oates and Scott Stevens for the remainder of the 2014–15 season, with Lamoriello supervising the team from the bench.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **#** | Number of coaches\n |\n| **GC** | Games coached\n |\n| **W** | Wins\n |\n| **L** | Losses\n |\n| **T** | Ties (no longer applicable after the 2005–06 season)\n |\n| **OTL** | Overtime losses (includes shootout losses after 2005–06)\n |\n| **Pts** | Points\n |\n| **Win%** | Winning percentage |\n| §\n | Name is engraved on the Stanley Cup |\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\n*Note: This list does not include data from the Kansas City Scouts and the Colorado Rockies.

general manager Lou Lamoriello filled in as coach for the Devils' 7–1 loss to Boston.[23]\n4. **^** Although Ftorek was replaced during the 1999–2000 season, he got his name on the Cup when the Devils won it later that same season.\n5. **^** Robinson was demoted to assistant coach and replaced as head coach in the middle of the 2001–02 season, but the Devils placed his name on the Cup when they won the following season even though he had left before the 2002–03 season even began.\n6. **^** Pat Burns resigned after being diagnosed with cancer.[24]\n7. **^** Larry Robinson resigned due to stress-related health problems.[25]\n8. **^** Claude Julien was fired with just 3 games left in the 2006–07 regular season.[26]\n9. **^** Brent Sutter quit after two years of a three-year contract, citing a desire to be closer to home in Alberta, with his family and minor league hockey team, the Red Deer Rebels.[27] Several weeks later, Sutter was announced as the head coach of the Calgary Flames. Despite the fact that Calgary had to request permission to talk to Sutter, the Devils received no compensation.[28]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Devils name Stevens, Oates to replace DeBoer\". *NHL.com*.
