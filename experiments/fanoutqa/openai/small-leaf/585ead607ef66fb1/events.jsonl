In some cases, commentators in other countries have derived their own acronyms for individuals who have won at all four ceremonies.\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Leah Collins of CBC Arts proposed a Canadian equivalent of the EGOT: the Canadian Screen Awards (and their predecessors, the Gemini and Genie Awards) for film and television, the Juno Awards for music, and the Dora Mavor Moore Awards for theatre.[40] Toronto-based game show Trivia Club referred to this combination as the \"Two-Can-Ju-Do\".[41] No individual has won in all four categories.\n\n\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Brandle, Lars (March 5, 2018). \"Oscars 2018: Robert Lopez Is The First Double EGOT Winner\". *Billboard*.

He drew a distinction between the producers who actually do the work of organizing the production of a show and investing producers who merely help finance it, often late in the award season.[9]\n\n\n\n## EGOT winners[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** \"Trivia Club: What is the Canadian EGOT, and Why is it the Two-Can-Ju-Do?\".

Between 2004 and 2022, Lopez received a total of 12 awards. Lopez is the first Filipino and Asian to achieve this feat. He is also the youngest winner to receive all four awards in competitive categories, as well as the fastest to complete his qualifying run of EGOT award wins (9 years, 8 months). Lopez is the first (and to date only) person to win each EGOT award twice, a \"double EGOT\".[16][17] Since his second series of wins would independently qualify Lopez for EGOT status, he has broken his own 'fastest to complete' record, establishing a new fastest interval at 7 year, 8 months (June 27th, 2010 Emmy through March 4th, 2018 Academy Award). \n\n\nHis initial Emmy prizes were Daytime Emmys, eventually winning a Primetime Emmy in 2021 for *WandaVision*. He is the second EGOT recipient (after John Legend) to follow a Daytime Emmy win with a subsequent Primetime Emmy.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Alan Menken | 2020[n 5][n 2] | 1991[n 1] | 1990[n 1] | 2012\n | 2020\n | 30\n | 70 years, 11 months\n | Composer, producer\n |\n| Jennifer Hudson | 2021[n 5] | 2009\n | 2007\n | 2022\n | 2022\n | 15\n | 40 years, 9 months\n | Singer, actress, producer, talk show host\n |\n| Viola Davis[n 3] | 2015\n | 2023\n | 2017\n | 2001[n 1] | 2023[11] | 22\n | 57 years, 5 months\n | Actress, producer\n |\n\n\n### Non-competitive EGOT[edit]\n\n\nSix additional artists have received all four awards, though one was bestowed for an honorary or similar non-competitive distinction: Barbra Streisand has no competitive Tony, Liza Minnelli has no competitive Grammy, and Harry Belafonte, James Earl Jones, Quincy Jones, and Frank Marshall have no competitive Oscar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Artist\n | 1st Award\n | 2nd Award\n | 3rd Award\n | 4th Award\n | Year span\n | Category(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Barbra Streisand | 1964\n | Grammy\n | 1965\n | Emmy\n | 1969\n | Oscar\n | 1970\n | Special Tony Award | 6\n | Actress and singer\n |\n| Liza Minnelli | 1965\n | Tony\n | 1973\n | Oscar\n | 1973\n | Emmy\n | 1990\n | Grammy Legend Award | 25\n | Actress and singer\n |\n| James Earl Jones | 1969\n | Tony\n | 1977\n | Grammy\n | 1991\n | Emmy\n | 2011\n | Academy Honorary Award (Oscar)\n | 42\n | Actor and voice actor\n |\n| Harry Belafonte | 1954\n | Tony\n | 1960\n | Emmy\n | 1961\n | Grammy\n | 2014\n | Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award (Oscar)\n | 60\n | Activist, actor and singer\n |\n| Quincy Jones | 1964\n | Grammy\n | 1977\n | Emmy\n | 1994\n | Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award (Oscar)\n | 2016\n | Tony\n | 52\n | Activist, arranger, composer, conductor, musician, and record producer\n |\n| Frank Marshall | 2019\n | Irving G.
