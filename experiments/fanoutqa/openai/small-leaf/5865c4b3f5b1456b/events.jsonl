He was a member of the South Korean boy group Astro and its sub-unit Moonbin & Sanha.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMoonbin was born on January 26, 1998, in Cheongju, Chungbuk Province. He attended and graduated from Hanlim Multi Art School, focusing in Practical Music.[2]\n\n\nHe was one of two siblings in his family, with a younger sister named Moon Sua, who is a member of the South Korean girl group Billlie.[3]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2006–2015: Pre-debut[edit]\n\n\nUnder the influence of his mother, Moonbin debuted as a child model and *ulzzang* in 2004. His first known appearance was in 2006, where he appeared in TVXQ's music video for their song \"Balloons\" portraying a mini U-Know Yunho.[4] In 2009, he had his first acting role in the Korean drama *Boys over Flowers* where he played the younger version of Kim Bum's character.[5]\n\n\nMoonbin began his journey with Fantagio as a trainee in fifth grade, eventually transitioning to a full-fledged trainee during his middle school years. He actively took part in the company's boy group project iTeen, and he was introduced through the Fantagio iTeen Photo Test Cut.[6] Before his official debut with Astro, Moonbin and his fellow group members starred in a web-drama titled \"*To Be Continued\"*.[7]\n\n\n\n### 2016–2022: Debut with Astro, solo activities, and unit debut[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Astro (South Korean band)\n\n![](image)Moonbin during the 2019 S/S Hera Seoul Fashion Week on October 19, 2018\nMoonbin debuted as part of the six-member boy group Astro on February 23, 2016. Their debut extended play, *Spring Up*, contained five songs, including the lead single \"Hide & Seek\".[8] In 2018, Moonbin joined the cast of *The Ultimate Watchlist of Latest Trends*, participating in the first two seasons.[9][10] The following year, he was cast in *Moments of Eighteen*, where he played the character of Jung Oh-je.[11]\n\n\nOn November 12, 2019, Fantagio reported that due to health reasons, Moonbin would be absent from Astro's upcoming promotions for their *Blue Flame* EP release.[12] He ended his hiatus in February 2020 after appearing in a V Live broadcast with the other Astro members.[13] He was announced as one of the new hosts of the South Korean music show *Show Champion*, alongside his bandmate Yoon San-ha and Verivery's Kangmin.[14] He was confirmed to play the lead role in the web-drama *The Mermaid Prince*, a role which he reprised for a second season,[15][16] and joined the eco-friendly cooking program *Food Avengers*.[17]\n\n\nIn September 2020, Moonbin was announced as one of the fashion models for the brand Nerdy Cafe.[18] He and band-mate Sanha (Yoon San-ha) debuted as Astro's first sub-unit Moonbin & Sanha with the release of their debut EP, *In-Out*, along with its lead single, \"Bad Idea\", on September 14.[19] The unit received their first music show win from *The Show* eight days later.[20]\n\n\nIn 2021, Neikidnis revealed that it had selected Moonbin as their first muse.[21] Later that year, Moonbin was added as a cast member for the second season of Coupang Play's *Saturday Night Live Korea*.[22] On December 30, 2022, Fantagio released an official statement confirming that Moonbin had decided to renew his contract with the agency.[23]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\nOn the evening of April 19, 2023, Moonbin was found dead at his home in the Gangnam District of Seoul at the age of 25.[1][24] He was found by his manager after he failed to attend rehearsals.[25] Yonhap News shared a statement released by the Seoul Gangnam Police who are investigating the death: \"it appears that he took his own life. We are discussing the possibility of an autopsy to determine the precise cause of death.\"[1][26][27] On April 20, Gangnam Police told CNN that \"no signs of foul play have been found related to this case.\"[28]\n\n\nAccording to an official statement released by Fantagio on April 21, Moonbin was to be buried on April 22, 2023. The funeral procession and the burial site was kept private per the request of his family.[29][30]\n\n\nA day before his death, it had been announced that Moonbin was set to perform at the Dream Concert in Busan with fellow Astro member Sanha as part of their duo, Moonbin & Sanha.[25] The organizers expressed their condolences on their social media accounts.[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Astro (South Korean band) § Discography\n\nSee also: Moonbin & Sanha § Discography\n\n\n\n| Title\n | Year\n | Peak chart positions\n | Album\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| KORDown.[33] |\n| As lead artist\n |\n| \"Let's Go Ride\"\n | 2022\n | 59\n | *Drive to the Starry Road* |\n| \"Desire\" (이끌려)\n | 2023\n | 15\n | *Incense* |\n| Collaborations\n |\n| \"Language Test\"  (with Weki Meki Ji Su-yeon) | 2018\n | —\n | *FM2018\\_12Hz* |\n\n\n### Songwriting credits[edit]\n\n\nAll credits are listed under the Korea Music Copyright Association unless otherwise stated.[34]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Artist\n | Album\n | Lyricist\n | Composer\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017\n | \"You & Me (Thanks Aroha)\"\n | Astro | *Winter Dream* | ![Yes](image) | ![No](image) |\n| 2018\n | \"By Your Side\" (너의 뒤에서)\n | *Rise Up* | ![Yes](image) | ![No](image) |\n| \"Merry-Go-Round (Christmas Edition)\"\n | Non-album single\n | ![Yes](image) | ![No](image) |\n| 2019\n | \"Merry-Go-Round\"\n | *All Light* | ![Yes](image) | ![No](image) |\n| 2021\n | \"Footprint\" (발자국)\n | *Switch On* | ![Yes](image) | ![No](image) |\n| 2022\n | \"Candy Sugar Pop\"\n | *Drive to the Starry Road* | ![Yes](image) | ![No](image) |\n| 2023\n | \"Madness\"\n | Moonbin & Sanha | *Incense* | ![Yes](image) | ![No](image) |\n| \"Desire\" (이끌려)\n | Himself\n | ![Yes](image) | ![Yes](image) |\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Television series[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2009\n | *Boys Over Flowers* | So Yi-jung (young)\n |  | [35] |\n| 2019\n | *Moment of Eighteen* | Jung Oh-je\n |  | [36][37] |\n\n\n### Web series[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2015\n | *To be Continued* | Himself\n |  | [7] |\n| 2016\n | *My Romantic Some Recipe* |  | Cameo appearance; episode 6\n | [38] |\n| 2017\n | *Idol Fever* |  | Cameo appearance\n | [39] |\n| *Sweet Revenge* | Himself\n | Cameo appearance\n | [40] |\n| 2019\n | *Soul Plate* | Angel Muriel\n |  | [41] |\n| 2020\n | *The Mermaid Prince* | Woo Hyuk\n | Lifetime Korea\n | [15] |\n| *The Mermaid Prince: The Beginning* | Choi Woo Hyuk\n | [16] |\n| 2021\n | *No Going Back Romance* |  | Cameo appearance\n | [42] |\n| *Find Me If You Can* |  | Cameo appearance; episode 6\n | [43] |\n\n\n### Television shows[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2018–2019\n | *The Ultimate Watchlist of Latest Trend*  | Cast member\n | Season 1–2\n | [44][45] |\n| 2020\n | *Food Avengers* |  | [46] |\n| 2020–2022\n | *Show Champion* | Host\n | with Yoon San-ha and Kangmin | [47] |\n\n\n### Web shows[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021\n | *Insa Oppa* | Cast\n |  | [48] |\n| 2021–2022\n | *Saturday Night Live Korea* | Cast member\n | Season 2\n | [22] |\n| 2022\n | *Challenge* | Host\n | TikTok Stage on Air; with Yoon San-ha | [49] |\n\n\n### Hosting[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2018\n | Incheon K-Pop Concert\n | with Kim Do-yeon | [50] |\n| 2020\n | Gangnam Festival K-Pop Concert\n | with Tiffany | [51] |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Astro (South Korean band) § Awards and nominations\n\n\n\nName of the award ceremony, year presented, category, nominee of the award, and the result of the nomination\n| Award ceremony\n | Year\n | Category\n | Nominee / Work\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| APAN Music Awards | 2020\n | Entertainer of the Year – Male\n | Moonbin\n | Nominated\n | [52] |\n| Seoul Webfest Film Festival\n | 2022\n | Best Supporting Actor\n | *Find Me If You Can* | Nominated\n | [53][54] |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"[단독] 아이돌 그룹 아스트로 멤버 문빈 자택서 숨진채 발견\" [[Exclusive] Idol group Astro member Moonbin found dead at home]. *Yonhap News* (in Korean).
