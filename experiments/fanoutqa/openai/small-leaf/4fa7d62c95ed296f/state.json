Particularly in winter, the Aleutian Low will draw warm and moist air from the south, bringing ample snow- or rainfall, and even in summer, winds will tend to blow onshore. The strength and frequency of the rainfall will depend from several factors, including the presence of El Ni\u00f1o (more mild and rainy weather) or La Ni\u00f1a (colder and drier periods due to the presence of an anticyclone in the Gulf of Alaska). Conversely, offshore winds from the interior are normally dry but may have extreme variations in temperature.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Map](image)Show Juneau\n![Map](image)Show Alaska\n![Map](image)Show the United States\n |\n| Coordinates: 58\u00b018\u203200\u2033N 134\u00b024\u203258\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff58.30\u00b0N 134.416\u00b0W\ufeff / 58.30; -134.416 |\n| Country | United States |\n| State | Alaska |\n| Named | 1881 (Juneau City)1882 (Juneau) |\n| Incorporated | 1900 |\n| Home-rule city | October 1960 |\n| Borough | September 30, 1963 (Greater Juneau Borough)July 1, 1970 (City and Borough of Juneau) |\n| Founded by | Richard Harris and Joe Juneau |\n| Named for | Joe Juneau |\n| Government |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Mayor | Beth Weldon |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Governing body | Assembly |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0State senator | Jesse Kiehl (D) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0State reps. | Sara Hannan (D)Andi Story (D) |\n| Area[1]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0State capital city | 3,254.70\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (8,429.64\u00a0km2) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Land | 2,704.03\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (7,003.41\u00a0km2) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Water | 550.67\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (1,426.23\u00a0km2) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Urban | 14.0\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (36\u00a0km2) |\n| Elevation[2]\n | 33\u00a0ft (10\u00a0m) |\n| Population(2020)[3]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0State capital city | 32,255 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Estimate\u00a0(2022)[4]\n | 31,685 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Density | 11.93/sq\u00a0mi (4.61/km2) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Urban\u00a0density | 1,749.5/sq\u00a0mi (675.5/km2) |\n| Time zone | UTC\u22129 (AKST) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Summer (DST) | UTC\u22128 (AKDT) |\n| ZIP code | 99801-99803, 99811-99812, 99821, 99824\n |\n| Area code | 907 |\n| FIPS code | 02-36400 |\n| GNIS feature ID | 1404263 |\n| Website | juneau.org |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **City and Borough of Juneau**, more commonly known simply as **Juneau** (/\u02c8d\u0292u\u02d0no\u028a/ *JOO-noh*; Tlingit: *Dz\u00e1nti K'ih\u00e9eni* Athapascan pronunciation: [\u02c8ts\u028c\u0301nt\u02b0\u026a\u0300 k\u02bc\u026a\u0300\u02c8h\u00ed\u02d0n\u026a\u0300]), is the capital city of the U.S. state of Alaska. Located in the Gastineau Channel and the Alaskan panhandle, it is a consolidated city-borough and the second-largest city in the United States by area. Juneau was named the capital of Alaska in 1906, when the government of what was then the District of Alaska was moved from Sitka as dictated by the U.S. Congress in 1900.[5][6] The municipality unified on July 1, 1970, when the city of Juneau merged with the city of Douglas and the surrounding Greater Juneau Borough to form the current municipality,[7] which is larger by area than both Rhode Island and Delaware.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Tongass National Forest (part)\n\t+ Admiralty Island National Monument (part)\n\t\t- Kootznoowoo Wilderness (part)\n\t+ Tracy Arm-Fords Terror Wilderness (part)\n\n\n### State Parks[edit]\n\n\nAlaska State Parks maintains the **Juneau Trail System**, a series of wilderness trails ranging from easy to extremely difficult.[24]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Climate chart for Juneau\nThe Juneau area is in a transition zone between a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen *Dfb*), a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen *Dfc*), and an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen *Cfb/Cfc*), depending on the isotherm used. The city's climate is heavily influenced by the proximity of the Pacific Ocean, specifically the warm Alaska Current, and the Coast Mountains that form a natural orographic barrier for incoming air. The weather is thus mild and moist, which, as in other parts of the Alaska Panhandle, allows the growth of temperate rainforests.[25] Like other settlements in the area, Juneau does not experience permafrost.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** \"Station Name: AK JUNEAU DWTN\".

The coldest temperature ever officially recorded in Juneau was \u221222\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221230.0\u00a0\u00b0C) on February 2, 1968, and January 12, 1972, while the hottest was 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32.2\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 7, 1975.[28] The normals and record temperatures for both downtown and the airport are given below.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDowntown Juneau is nestled at the base of Mount Juneau and across the channel from Douglas Island. As of the 2020 census, the City and Borough had a population of 32,255,[3][8] making it the third-most populous city in Alaska after Anchorage and Fairbanks. Juneau experiences a daily influx of roughly 6,000 people from visiting cruise ships between the months of May and September.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe city is named after a gold prospector from Quebec, Joe Juneau, though the place was once called *Rockwell* and then *Harrisburg* (after Juneau's co-prospector, Richard Harris). The Tlingit name of the town is *Dz\u00e1ntik'i H\u00e9eni* (\"Base of the Flounder's River\", *dz\u00e1nti* 'flounder,' *\u2013k\u02bci* 'base,' *h\u00e9en* 'river'), and Auke Bay just north of Juneau proper is called *\u00c1ak'w* (\"Little lake\", *\u00e1a* 'lake,' *-k\u02bc* 'diminutive') in Tlingit. The Taku River, just south of Juneau, was named after the cold *t'aakh* wind, which occasionally blows down from the mountains.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJuneau remains the capital.[16] Once Alaska was granted statehood in 1959, Juneau's population increased along with the growth of state government. After construction of the Alaska Pipeline in 1977, the state budget was flush with oil revenues, and it expanded programs for the people. That growth slowed considerably in the 1980s.[17]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Downtown Juneau at night\nIn 2005, the state demographer projected slow growth in the borough for the next twenty years.[18] Cruise ship tourism has expanded rapidly, from approximately 230,000 passengers in 1990 to nearly 1,000,000 in 2006, as cruise lines have built more and larger ships. They sail to Juneau seven days a week over a longer season than before, but the cruising tourism is still primarily a summer industry. It provides few year-round jobs but stimulates summer employment in the city.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJuneau first appeared on the 1890 U.S. Census. It was formally incorporated in 1900, and on July 1, 1970, the city of Juneau merged with the city of Douglas and the surrounding Greater Juneau Borough to form the current municipality, which accounts for the population jump between the 1970 and 1980 censuses.\n\n\n\n### 2020 census[edit]\n\n\nAs of the census of 2020, there were 31,275 people, 12,922 households. The population density was 11.9 per square mile (4.6/km2), making it the least densely populated state capital. There were 12,922 housing units at an average density of 4.0 per square mile (1.5/km2). The racial makeup of the city/borough was 64.7% White (62.5% Non-Hispanic White), 1.0% African American, 10.1% Native American or Alaska Native, 6.7% Asian, 1.3% Pacific Islander, and 14.3% from two or more races. 7.0% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.[37] 2.6% reported speaking Tagalog at home, and 2.4% reported speaking Spanish.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJuneau International Airport serves the city and borough of Juneau. Alaska Airlines services the airport year round, operating upwards of 11 daily departures. Alaska Airlines serves Juneau and other Southeast Alaska villages via \"Milk Run\" flights which make multiple stops to and from Seattle or Anchorage. Alaska also connects Juneau to other cities in the country through connections in Seattle or Anchorage.\n\n\nIn the summer, Delta Air Lines serves Juneau from its major West Coast hub in Seattle, providing global service to and from Southeast Alaska without having to switch air carriers.\n\n\nIn the past, MarkAir and Western Airlines serviced Juneau.[65] Alaska Seaplanes and Ward Air offer charter seaplane service from the seaplane floatpond \"runway\" that runs parallel to the traditional tarmac. They offer service to the smaller villages in the surrounding area as well as flightseeing.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJuneau is unique among the 49 U.S. capitals on mainland North America in that there are no roads connecting the city to the rest of the state or North America. Honolulu, Hawaii, is the only other state capital not connected by road to the rest of North America. The absence of a road network is due to the extremely rugged terrain surrounding the city. This in turn makes Juneau a *de facto* island city in terms of transportation, since all goods coming in and out must go by plane or boat, in spite of the city's location on the Alaskan mainland. Downtown Juneau sits at sea level, with tides averaging 16 feet (5\u00a0m), below steep mountains about 3,500 to 4,000 feet (1,100 to 1,200\u00a0m) high. Atop these mountains is the Juneau Icefield, a large ice mass from which about 30 glaciers flow; two of these, the Mendenhall Glacier and the Lemon Creek Glacier, are visible from the local road system. The Mendenhall glacier has been gradually retreating; its front face is declining in width and height.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n74. **^** \"SEIS - Juneau Access Improvements Project | Permitting Dashboard\". *www.permits.performance.gov*.

These associations include the Alaska Trollers Association, United Fishermen of Alaska, United Southeast Alaska Gillnetters Association, and the Southeast Alaska Seiners Association.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nReal estate agencies, federally funded highway construction, and mining are still viable non-government local industries. Alaska Seaplanes, an airline, has its headquarters in Juneau.[44] Highliner Construction, a general contractor is based there as well.[45]\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 1,107 businesses with operations in Juneau borough and thus, with a population of 31,275, a per capita of roughly 28 people per business.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJuneau's only power utility is Alaska Electric Light & Power (AEL&P). Most of the electricity in the borough is generated at the Snettisham Hydroelectric facility in the southern end of the borough, accessible only by boat or plane. In April 2008, an avalanche destroyed three transmission towers, forcing AEL&P to supply almost all of the borough's electricity from diesel-powered generators for one month.[46]\n\n\nAlso headquartered in Juneau is the Marine Exchange of Alaska, a nonprofit organization which operates an extensive vessel tracking network and ensures safe maritime operations for the entire state.[47]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nJuneau hosts the annual Alaska Folk Festival, Juneau Jazz & Classics music festival, and Celebration, a biennial Alaska Native cultural festival.\n\n\nJuneau has a city-owned ski resort, Eaglecrest, located on Douglas Island.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTemperatures vary relatively little over the year. Winters are mild by Alaskan standards, with the average temperature of January slightly below freezing and highs often above 32\u00a0\u00b0F (0.0\u00a0\u00b0C); summers are rather cool but occasionally may get warm. Temperatures above 75\u00a0\u00b0F (23.9\u00a0\u00b0C) or below 10\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221212.2\u00a0\u00b0C) are not unheard of but are rare. Precipitation falls on an average 230 days per year, averaging 62.27 inches (1,580\u00a0mm) at the airport (1981\u20132010 normals), but ranging from 55 to 92 inches (1,400 to 2,340\u00a0mm), depending on location.[27] Most of it will occur in fall and winter, some falling as snow from November to March.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJuneau is not directly accessible by road, although there are road connections within the borough to rural areas. Glacier Highway section of Alaska Route 7 runs within Juneau. Primary access to the city is by air and sea. Cars and trucks are transported to and from Juneau by barge or the Alaska Marine Highway ferry system.\n\n\n\n![](image)An Alaska Marine Highway ferry boat docked in Juneau, Alaska\n![](image)Juneau is a popular cruise ship destination\n![](image)Alaska Airlines flight moments after landing at Juneau International Airport\n![](image)View of downtown Juneau, Alaska from the Juneau-Douglas Bridge.

The city's tallest building, Mendenhall Towers (at least 11 stories tall),[41] is partially visible in the background.\nAnother large contributor to the local economy is the tourism industry, which generates most income in the summer months. In 2005, the cruise ship industry was estimated to bring nearly one million visitors to Juneau for up to 11 hours at a time, between May and September.[42] On the other hand, former politician Bill Ray, who previously lived in Juneau and represented Juneau in the Alaska Legislature, said: \"Juneau doesn't go forward. They've prostituted themselves to tourism. It looks like a poor man's Lahaina\".[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** \"U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Juneau city and borough, Alaska\". *www.census.gov*.

The mayor is the titular head of the city, is the presiding officer (or chair) of the Juneau Assembly (council), and is one of three members of that body elected at-large, or areawide. The remaining six members are elected by single-member districts: two districts have been defined by the Assembly, as of its last redistricting in 2003:[55]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * District 1 precincts\n\t+ Douglas\n\t+ Juneau No. 1\n\t+ Juneau No. 2\n\t+ Juneau No. 3\n\t+ Juneau Airport\n\t+ Lemon Creek\n\t+ North Douglas\n | * District 2 precincts\n\t+ Auke Bay\n\t+ Lynn Canal\n\t+ Mendenhall Valley No. 1\n\t+ Mendenhall Valley No. 2\n\t+ Mendenhall Valley No. 3\n\t+ Mendenhall Valley No. 4\n |\n\n They hire a professional city manager to handle daily affairs and a city attorney for legal matters.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJuneau's roads remain separate from other roads in Alaska and in the Lower 48. There have been plans to connect Juneau to Haines and Skagway by road since before 1972, with funding for the first feasibility study acquired in 1987.[69] The State of Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities announced in 2005 that the connection was to be provided partly by road, and partly by fast ferry. A 51-mile (82\u00a0km) road would be built on the east side of Lynn Canal to a new ferry terminal at the Katzehin River estuary.[70] A ferry would take cars from the terminal to Haines and Skagway, where the cars could then access the rest of North America.[70] In 2006, the project was estimated to cost $258 million, and in 2007, the estimate was increased to $350 million.[70] Annual costs have been estimated from $2.1 million to $12 million, depending on the length of the road.[69] The Western Federal Lands Center estimated the project would cost $491 million.[70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikivoyage has a travel guide for ***Juneau***.\n\n![](image)\n\nWikisource has the text of the 1911 *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica* article \"Juneau\".\n\n* Official website\n* Juneau Convention & Visitors Bureau\n* Juneau, Alaska at Curlie\n\n\n| Places adjacent to Juneau, Alaska\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Haines Borough |  | Stikine Region, British Columbia (Canada) |\n|  | ![](image) |  |\n|  | ![](image)**City and Borough of Juneau**![](image)\n | Regional District of Kitimat\u2013Stikine, British Columbia (Canada) |\n|  | ![](image) |  |\n|  | Hoonah\u2013Angoon Census Area (Unorganized Borough) |  |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The \"Welcome to Juneau\" sign at the cruise port\n![](image)Downtown tourists\n![](image)The welcome sign for Mayor Bill Overstreet Park\nAs the capital of Alaska, the primary employer in Juneau is government. This includes the state government, federal government (which has regional offices here, especially for resource agencies), municipal government (which includes the local airport, hospital, harbors, and school district), and the University of Alaska Southeast.

Juneau was recently the 49th most lucrative U.S. fisheries port by volume and 45th by value. In 2004 it took in 15 million pounds of fish and shellfish, valued at 21.5 million dollars, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. While the port of Juneau does comparatively little seafood processing compared to other towns of this size in Alaska, the hundreds of commercial fishing boats sell their fish to plants in nearby Sitka, Hoonah, Petersburg and Ketchikan. The largest fleets operating from Juneau are the gillnet and troll salmon fleets.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nResidents walk, hike, or ride bicycles for recreational purposes and for transportation. The downtown area of Juneau has sidewalks, and the neighborhoods on the hill above downtown are accessible by foot. Some roads in the city also have bike lanes, and there is a bike path parallel to the main highway.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nThe city and borough is primarily served by Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau's Twin Lakes area. The hospital also serves the nearby remote communities of Hoonah, Haines, and Skagway. Individuals in these communities must be airlifted to the hospital via helicopter or air ambulance (ranging from a 20-minute to a 45-minute flight, depending on location).\n\n\n\n## Utilities[edit]\n\n\nJuneau is served by the following utilities:\n\n\n\n* Electric: Alaska Electric Light and Power Company\n* Water and Sewer: City and Borough of Juneau\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media in Juneau, Alaska\n\n### Print[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs is the case throughout Southeast Alaska, the Juneau area is susceptible to damage caused by natural disasters. The 2014 Palma Bay earthquake caused widespread outages to telecommunications in the area due to damage to a fiber optic cable serving the area. In April 2008, a series of massive avalanches outside Juneau heavily damaged the electrical lines providing Juneau with power, knocking the hydroelectric system offline and forcing the utility to switch to a much more expensive diesel system.\n\n\n\n### Adjacent boroughs and census areas[edit]\n\n\n* Haines Borough, Alaska \u2013 northwest, west\n* Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, Alaska \u2013 south, southwest\n* Petersburg Borough, Alaska \u2013 quadripoint\n\n\n### Border area[edit]\n\n\nJuneau, Alaska, shares its eastern border with the Canadian province of British Columbia.

The Treaty of Medicine Creek was signed in 1854 and followed by the Treaty of Olympia in 1856; these two treaties forced the Squaxin to relocate to an Indian reservation. Olympia was incorporated as a town on January 28, 1859, and as a city in 1882.[7] It had a population of 55,605 at the time of the 2020 census,[3] making it the state's 23rd most populous city.

It opened to traffic on December 12, 1958, and was later expanded in 1991.[9]\n\n\n\n## Geography and climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Astronaut photograph of Olympia, Washington, taken from the International Space Station (ISS)\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 19.68 square miles (50.97\u00a0km2), of which 17.82\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (46.15\u00a0km2) is land and 1.86\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (4.82\u00a0km2) is water.[10] The cities of Lacey and Tumwater border Olympia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Coordinates: 47\u00b02\u203216\u2033N 122\u00b054\u20323\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff47.03778\u00b0N 122.90083\u00b0W\ufeff / 47.03778; -122.90083 |\n| Country | United States |\n| State | Washington |\n| County | Thurston |\n| Incorporated | January 28, 1859 |\n| Named for | Olympic Mountains |\n| Government |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Type | Council/City Manager |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Mayor | Cheryl Selby (D) |\n| Area[1]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0City | 20.09\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (52.02\u00a0km2) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Land | 18.23\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (47.20\u00a0km2) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Water | 1.87\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (4.82\u00a0km2) |\n| Elevation[2]\n | 95\u00a0ft (29\u00a0m) |\n| Population(2020)[3]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0City | 55,605 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Estimate\u00a0(2022)[4]\n | 55,669 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Rank | US: 718thWA: 24th |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Density | 2,902.26/sq\u00a0mi (1,120.58/km2) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Urban | 208,157 (US: 182nd) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Urban\u00a0density | 1,960.0/sq\u00a0mi (756.8/km2) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Metro | 298,758 (US: 172nd) |\n| Demonym | Olympian |\n| Time zone | UTC-8 (Pacific (PST)) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Summer (DST) | UTC-7 (PDT) |\n| ZIP codes | 98501-98599\n |\n| Area code | 360, 564 |\n| FIPS code | 53-51300 |\n| GNIS feature ID | 1533353[2] |\n| Website | olympiawa.gov |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"History of Olympia, Washington\". olympiawa.gov.

The Evergreen State College (TESC) offers bachelor's degrees in liberal arts and science, and master's degrees in environmental studies, public administration, education, and teaching. South Puget Sound Community College (SPSCC) offers associate degrees in arts, science, biology, elementary education, pre-nursing, applied science, general studies, and business.\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nRobust journalism in Olympia dates to before Washington Territory's incorporation in 1853.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOlympia Regional Airport is just south of Olympia in Tumwater. It is operated by the Port of Olympia and serves general aviation as well as corporate aviation. The airport hosts the Olympic AirShow, a medium-sized airshow that occurs on Father's Day weekend each year.[40]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from Olympia, Washington\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOlympia and Thurston County are included in the Seattle-Tacoma designated market area (DMA), and therefore are chiefly served by Seattle's network-affiliated television stations and some radio stations. Since 1983, Olympia has had a public, educational and government access television station, which was rebranded in 2016 as Thurston Community Media.[34] Olympia sits on the southern fringe of the FM signal of National Public Radio member station KUOW. An AM simulcast is transmitted from a tower in nearby Tumwater.[35] Evergreen State College's KAOS broadcasts a mix of educational and political programming, with student-driven music shows.[36]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOlympia is at the southern end of Puget Sound on Budd Inlet, where the Deschutes River estuary enters the Sound. The river was dammed in 1951 to create Capitol Lake; in late 2022 the state government approved the dam's removal to restore the estuary at an unspecified date.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOlympia's main public school district is the Olympia School District. It enrolled 9,782 students in K-12 in the 2021\u201322 school year.[31] The district has a total of 18 schools: 11 elementary schools, four middle schools and three high schools. Its high schools are Olympia High School (formally known as William Winlock Miller High School), Capital High School, and Avanti High School.\n\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 school year, Olympia began the Parent Partnership Program, which provides more opportunities to homeschooling families. Olympia's online high school, Olympia Regional Learning Academy (ORLA), is part of the same program. Private elementary schools include Olympia Waldorf School, Olympia Community School, St. Michael School, Holy Family, and Evergreen Christian. Private middle schools include Olympia Waldorf School and NOVA School. Pope John Paul II High School is a private high school.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Plants for sale at the Olympia Farmers Market\nOlympia has a wide array of public parks and nature conservation areas. Percival Landing Park includes 0.9 miles (1.4\u00a0km) of boardwalk along Budd Inlet, as well as a playground, picnic areas, and a large open space. The boardwalk leads north to an open-air amphitheater, a viewing tower beside the Port of Olympia, as well as the Olympia Farmers' Market. Squaxin Park has an extensive trail system, 150-year-old forest, and undeveloped waterfront on Puget Sound. The city's 39 other developed parks include Watershed Park, Woodruff Park, Sunrise Park, Yauger Park (home to one of Olympia's public skate parks), Friendly Grove (nestled in a small Eastside Community), and Trillium Park, which was created by the efforts of adjoining neighborhood associations with the easement of private property. The Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge is near Olympia, as are the Capitol State Forest, Burfoot Park, and the Woodard Bay Natural Resources Conservation Area.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe area is located near the southern limit of the Fraser Glaciation and the underlying sediments consist largely of Vashon-age till and outwash deposited at that time; the area also includes former lakebeds and alluvial deposits associated with proglacial lakes that existed in the area near the end of Vashon-stage glaciation. Residual glacial topography in the area includes drumlins, subglacial channels, and kettle lakes.[12] Much of downtown Olympia sits on reclaimed land. Tidewater areas were filled as early as the 1870s, but the major change occurred in 1910\u201311 with placement of the Carlyon Fill (named for mayor P.H. Carlyon). Over two million cubic yards of sediment were dredged, thereby creating a deep-water port at Olympia; the dredged material was used to fill tidelands, creating almost 30 blocks of what is now downtown.[13][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA previous sister city agreement with Olympia, Greece is no longer in effect.[52] An attempt to create a sister city partnership with Rafah, Palestine, was rejected by the city council in 2007.[53]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View from Tumwater Hill\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* Bigelow House\n* Capital City Pride \u2013 Community Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Festival\n* Washington State Capitol\n* Freechild Institute for Youth Engagement \u2013 Nonprofit organization in Olympia\n* Capitol Lakefair \u2013 Annual festival in Olympia\n* Music of Olympia, Washington\n* Port Militarization Resistance\n* USS *Olympia*, 2 ships\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*The Olympian* is the local daily newspaper.

Online outlet NorthAmericaTalk, an aggregate for local community news and marketing, was established with headquarters in Olympia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOlympia was historically dependent on artesian waters, including springs that supplied early settlers in Swantown and Tumwater. The artesian spring at Fourth Avenue and Main Street (now called Capitol Way) was the main community well where settlers, as well as the local Steh-Chass and visiting Native Americans, gathered to socialize. Settler accounts recall paying Native Americans to collect water here. The artesian well at Artesian Commons park, a former parking lot, is active.[19] Another still flows at the corner of Olympia Avenue and Washington Street. A small park was constructed around another spring in the Bigelow Neighborhood.[20] The northeast end of Capitol Lake was the location of an artesian well until the construction of a new park that included changes to the shoreline. McAllister Springs, Olympia's main water source, is fed by artesian wells, and the former Olympia Brewery is supplied by 26 artesian wells.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"2020 U.S. Gazetteer Files\".

Other Native Americans regularly visited the head of Budd Inlet and the Steh-Chass, including the other ancestor tribes of the Squaxin, as well as the Nisqually, Puyallup, Chehalis, Suquamish, and Duwamish. The first recorded Europeans came to Olympia in 1792. Peter Puget and a crew from the British Vancouver Expedition are said to have explored the site, but neither recorded any encounters with the resident Indigenous population. In 1846, Edmund Sylvester and Levi Lathrop Smith jointly claimed the land that is now downtown Olympia. In 1851, the U.S. Congress established the Customs District of Puget Sound for Washington Territory and Olympia became the home of the customs house. Its population steadily expanded from Oregon Trail immigrants. In 1850, the town settled on the name Olympia, at local resident Colonel Isaac N. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Capitol Theater, home of the Olympia Film Society\nOlympia is a regional center for fine arts. A number of theatrical experiences are available with companies such as Animal Fire Theater, Olympia Family Theater, Olympia Little Theater, Theater Artists Olympia, Broadway Olympia Productions, and Harlequin Productions at the historic State Theater, as well as Broadway Olympia's Black Box Theater at Capitol Mall. The Olympia Symphony Orchestra performs five regular-season concerts at the Washington Center and two pops concerts. The Masterworks Chorale Ensemble performs four regular-season concerts at the Washington Center for the Performing Arts.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNotable art venues near Olympia include Art in Ecology, housed in Washington Department of Ecology's 322,000-square-foot, three-story building on the campus of Saint Martin's University. Art in Ecology is a long-established art-in-the-workplace venue that has works by numerous northwest artists. Permanent installations by Alfredo Arreguin, commissioned by the Washington State Arts Commission, are accompanied by changing solo and group exhibitions throughout the year. Appointments to view the works are needed; tours take about an hour.\n\n\nSouth Puget Sound Community College has a gallery in its Minnaert Center with rotating exhibitions. Evergreen State College, northwest of Olympia, has a professionally curated gallery with rotating shows in the Dan Evans Library building. South of Olympia, Monarch Contemporary Art Center and Sculpture Park has an 80-acre sculpture garden and art gallery.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nMunicipalities and communities of Thurston County, Washington, United States\n |\n| --- |\n| County seat: **Olympia**\n |\n| Cities | * Lacey\n* Olympia\n* Rainier\n* Tenino\n* Tumwater\n* Yelm\n | ![](image)Map of Washington highlighting Thurston County\n |\n| Town | * Bucoda\n |\n| CDPs | * Grand Mound\n* Nisqually Indian Community\n* North Yelm\n* Rochester\n* Tanglewilde\n |\n| Unincorporatedcommunities | * Belmore\n* Boston Harbor\n* Bush\n* Delphi\n* Driftwood\n* East Olympia\n* Fir Tree\n* Gate\n* Independence\n* Littlerock\n* Maytown\n* McIntosh\n* Mima\n* Mushroom Corner\n* Offutt Lake\n* Puget\n* Rignall\n* Skookumchuck\n* Sunnydale\n* Vail\n |\n| Indian reservation | * Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation\u2021\n* Nisqually Indian Reservation\n |\n| Ghost town | * Bordeaux\n* Tono\n |\n| Footnotes | \u2021This populated place also has portions in an adjacent county or counties\n |\n| * Washington portal\n* United States portal\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEfforts to protect and preserve the free-flowing artesian well on 4th Avenue in downtown Olympia began in 1991 with support from a local coffee roaster. Donations from the public were used to form \"Friends of the Artesians\", a group that researched the wells, maintained them, and tested their quality. They were later replaced by the non-profit organization H2Olympia in 2009.[21] In 2011, the city of Olympia committed $50,000 toward improvements of an artesian well in a parking lot that the city purchased the same year.[22] Renovations at the well were completed in late 2011, including surface improvements, solar lighting, and a raised area to fill bottles. In spring 2012, sea-themed mosaic artwork created by community members was installed at the site of the well.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* US Soccer goalkeeper Kasey Keller was born in Olympia.
