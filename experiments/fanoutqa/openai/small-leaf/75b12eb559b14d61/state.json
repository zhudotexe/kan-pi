The crew consisted of Commander Charles \"Pete\" Conrad, Command Module Pilot Richard F. Gordon Jr., and Lunar Module Pilot Alan L. Bean.\n\nDuring the mission, Conrad and Bean performed just over one day and seven hours of lunar surface activity while Gordon remained in lunar orbit. The crew landed near the Surveyor 3 robotic probe, deployed the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP), and collected samples. The mission ended with a successful splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on November 24, 1969.\n\nThe search results also include information about the crew, key Mission Control personnel, the spacecraft used in the mission, the lunar landing site, and the aftermath of the mission. Additionally, details about the mission insignia, hardware, lunar surface activities, and the landing site selection process are provided in the search results.",

When Armstrong first stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously said: \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[1][2][3][4] It was broadcast live to an estimated 530 million viewers worldwide. Apollo 11 was a major U.S. victory in the Space Race, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy \"of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" before the end of the decade. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon and received the 1969 Collier Trophy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Chris Kraft, a March 1969 meeting among Slayton, George Low, Bob Gilruth, and Kraft determined that Armstrong would be the first person on the Moon, in part because NASA management saw him as a person who did not have a large ego. A press conference on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the LM pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his book.[113][114] Methods of circumventing this difficulty existed, but it is not known if these were considered at the time. Slayton added, \"Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, I figured the commander ought to be the first guy out\u00a0... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision.\"[115]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter being released from an 18-day quarantine to ensure that they had not picked up any infections or diseases from the Moon, the crew was feted across the United States and around the world as part of a 38-day \"Giant Leap\" tour.[162] \n\n![](image)New York City ticker tape parade, August 13, 1969\nThe tour began on August 13, when the three astronauts spoke and rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in New York and Chicago, with an estimated six million attendees.[163][164] On the same evening an official state dinner was held in Los Angeles to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44\u00a0governors, the Chief Justice of the United States, and ambassadors from 83\u00a0nations. President Nixon and Vice President Agnew presented each astronaut with a Presidential Medal of Freedom.[163][165]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 5, 1967, the same day the Apollo\u00a01 investigation released its final report, Armstrong and 17 other astronauts gathered for a meeting with Slayton. The first thing Slayton said was, \"The guys who are going to fly the first lunar missions are the guys in this room.\"[100] According to Cernan, only Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement. To Armstrong it came as no surprise\u2014the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPeople who have traveled to the Moon\n |\n| --- |\n| Walked on the Moon | * Neil Armstrong (Apollo 11)\n* Buzz Aldrin (Apollo 11)\n* Pete Conrad (Apollo 12)\n* Alan Bean (Apollo 12)\n* Alan Shepard (Apollo 14)\n* Edgar Mitchell (Apollo 14)\n* David Scott (Apollo 15)\n* James Irwin (Apollo 15)\n* John Young (Apollo 16)\n* Charles Duke (Apollo 16)\n* Harrison Schmitt (Apollo 17)\n* Gene Cernan (Apollo 17)\n |\n| Flew to the Moonwithout landing | * William Anders (Apollo 8)\n* Frank Borman (Apollo 8)\n* Jim Lovell (Apollo 8, Apollo 13)\n* Thomas Stafford (Apollo 10)\n* Michael Collins (Apollo 11)\n* Dick Gordon (Apollo 12)\n* Fred Haise (Apollo 13)\n* Jack Swigert (Apollo 13)\n* Stuart Roosa (Apollo 14)\n* Al Worden (Apollo 15)\n* Ken Mattingly (Apollo 16)\n* Ronald Evans (Apollo 17)\n |\n| * Apollo program\n* Saturn V\n* Command and Service Module\n* Lunar Module\n* Lunar Roving Vehicle\n* Exploration of the Moon\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n238. **^** Shane, Scott; Kliff, Sarah (August 1, 2019). \"A Scoop About Neil Armstrong Arrived in a Plain Brown Envelope\". *The New York Times*.

The selections were kept secret until three days later, although newspaper reports had circulated since earlier that year that he would be selected as the \"first civilian astronaut\".[68] Armstrong was one of two civilian pilots selected for this group;[69] the other was Elliot See, another former naval aviator.[70] NASA selected the second group that, compared with the Mercury Seven astronauts, were younger,[67] and had more impressive academic credentials.[71] Collins wrote that Armstrong was by far the most experienced test pilot in the Astronaut Corps.[55]\n\n\n\n### Gemini program[edit]\n\n\n#### Gemini 5[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n258. **^** \"Neil A.

They began their tasks of investigating how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Armstrong unveiled a plaque commemorating the flight, and with Aldrin, planted the flag of the United States. Although Armstrong had wanted the flag to be draped on the flagpole,[152] it was decided to use a metal rod to hold it horizontally.[153] However, the rod did not fully extend, leaving the flag with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze.[154] Shortly after the flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by telephone from his office. He spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.[155] In the Apollo 11 photographic record, there are only five images of Armstrong partly shown or reflected. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Three astronauts in white space suits.

This time, selection was open to qualified civilian test pilots.[65] Armstrong visited the Seattle World's Fair in May 1962 and attended a conference there on space exploration that was co-sponsored by NASA. After he returned from Seattle on June 4, he applied to become an astronaut. His application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline, but Dick Day, a flight simulator expert with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed.[66] At Brooks Air Force Base at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArmstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in the second group, which was selected in 1962. He made his first spaceflight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. During this mission with pilot David Scott, he performed the first docking of two spacecraft; the mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his re-entry control fuel to stabilize a dangerous roll caused by a stuck thruster. During training for Armstrong's second and last spaceflight as commander of Apollo 11, he had to eject from the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle moments before a crash.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n#### Voyage to the Moon[edit]\n\n\nA Saturn V rocket launched Apollo 11 from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (09:32:00 EDT local time).[116] Armstrong's wife Janet and two sons watched from a yacht moored on the Banana River.[117] During the launch, Armstrong's heart rate peaked at 110\u00a0beats per minute.[118] He found the first stage the loudest, much noisier than the Gemini\u00a08 Titan II launch. The Apollo command module was relatively roomy compared with the Gemini spacecraft. None of the Apollo 11 crew suffered space sickness, as some members of previous crews had. Armstrong was especially glad about this, as he had been prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after long periods of aerobatics.[119]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n165. **^** Smith, Merriman (August 14, 1969). \"Astronauts Awed by the Acclaim\". *The Honolulu Advertiser*.

His first space flight was in 1966 on Gemini 12, during which he spent over five hours on extravehicular activity. Three years later, Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface, while command module pilot Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit.

After the ceremony, the crew went to the White House and presented President Bill Clinton with an encased Moon rock.[155][156] The Apollo\u00a011 crew was awarded the New Frontier Congressional Gold Medal in the Capitol Rotunda in 2011.

Aldrin's first words after he set foot on the Moon were \"Beautiful view\", to which Armstrong asked \"Isn't that something? Magnificent sight out here.\" Aldrin answered, \"Magnificent desolation.\"[87] Aldrin and Armstrong had trouble erecting the Lunar Flag Assembly, but with some effort secured it into the surface.

Aldrin and Armstrong then set up a seismometer, to detect moonquakes, and a laser beam reflector. While Armstrong inspected a crater, Aldrin began the difficult task of hammering a metal tube into the surface to obtain a core sample.[91] Most of the iconic photographs of an astronaut on the Moon taken by the Apollo\u00a011 astronauts are of Aldrin; Armstrong appears in just two color photographs. \"As the sequence of lunar operations evolved,\" Aldrin explained, \"Neil had the camera most of the time, and the majority of the pictures taken on the Moon that include an astronaut are of me.

My fault perhaps, but we had never simulated this during our training.\"[92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEarly versions of the EVA checklist had the lunar module pilot as the first to step onto the lunar surface. However, when Aldrin learned that this might be amended, he lobbied within NASA for the original procedure to be followed. Multiple factors contributed to the final decision, including the physical positioning of the astronauts within the compact lunar lander, which made it easier for Armstrong to be the first to exit the spacecraft. Furthermore, there was little support for Aldrin's views among senior astronauts who would command later Apollo missions.[63] Collins has commented that he thought Aldrin \"resents not being first on the Moon more than he appreciates being second\".[64]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn a June 2013 opinion piece in *The New York Times*, Aldrin supported a human mission to Mars and which viewed the Moon \"not as a destination but more a point of departure, one that places humankind on a trajectory to homestead Mars and become a two-planet species.\"[142] In August 2015, Aldrin, in association with the Florida Institute of Technology, presented a master plan to NASA for consideration where astronauts, with a tour of duty of ten years, establish a colony on Mars before the year 2040.[143]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican astronaut and lunar explorer (born 1930)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Aldrin, Buzz and Ken Abraham. 2009. *Magnificent Desolation: The Long Journey Home from the Moon*.

Aldrin heard that Armstrong would be the first because Armstrong was a civilian, which made Aldrin livid. Aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should be first, but they responded cynically about what they perceived as a lobbying campaign. Attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict, Slayton told Aldrin that Armstrong would be first since he was the commander. The decision was announced in a press conference on April 14, 1969.[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe initial crew assignment of Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot (CMP) Jim Lovell, and Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) Buzz Aldrin on the backup crew for Apollo\u00a09 was officially announced on November 20, 1967.[50] Lovell and Aldrin had previously flown together as the crew of Gemini 12. Due to design and manufacturing delays in the LM, Apollo\u00a08 and Apollo\u00a09 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo\u00a08. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was then expected to command Apollo 11.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAldrin shoveled 6 kilograms (13\u00a0lb) of soil into the box of rocks in order to pack them in tightly.[158] Two types of rocks were found in the geological samples: basalt and breccia.[159] Three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: armalcolite, tranquillityite, and pyroxferroite. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins. All have subsequently been found on Earth.[160]\n\n\n\n![](image)The plaque left on the ladder of *Eagle*\nWhile on the surface, Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the LM ladder, bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon.

Throughout the descent, Aldrin called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting *Eagle*. Now 107 feet (33\u00a0m) above the surface, Armstrong knew their propellant supply was dwindling and was determined to land at the first possible landing site.[126]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Aldrin, Buzz; Abraham, Ken (2016). *No Dream is Too High: Life Lessons from a Man who Walked on the Moon*.

Burger and his predecessor, Earl Warren, and ambassadors from 83 nations at the Century Plaza Hotel. Nixon and Agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[206][208]\n\n\nThe three astronauts spoke before a joint session of Congress on September 16, 1969. They presented two US flags, one to the House of Representatives and the other to the Senate, that they had carried with them to the surface of the Moon.[209] The flag of American Samoa on Apollo 11 is on display at the Jean P. Haydon Museum in Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa.[210]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into *Eagle* and landed in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20. The astronauts used *Eagle*'s ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned *Eagle* before they performed the maneuvers that propelled *Columbia* out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n276. **^** Dunn, Marcia (July 19, 2019). \"Apollo 11 astronauts reunite on 50th anniversary of moonshot\". *ABC*.

On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, the Soviet Union launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories radio telescope in England recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and these were released in July 2009 for the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.[49]\n\n\n\n## Personnel[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Part of a series on |\n| Apollo 11 |\n| * **Crew**\n\t+ Neil Armstrong \u00b7 Buzz Aldrin \u00b7 Michael Collins\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n160. **^** University of Western Australia (January 17, 2012). \"Moon-walk mineral discovered in Western Australia\". *ScienceDaily*.

With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21.55 kilograms (47.5\u00a0lb) of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor (LEC). This proved to be an inefficient tool, and later missions preferred to carry equipment and samples up to the LM by hand.[137] Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket, and Aldrin tossed the bag down. Armstrong then jumped onto the ladder's third rung, and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, an empty Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. The hatch was closed again at 05:11:13. They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.[163]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn November 1969, Nixon asked NASA to make up about 250 presentation Apollo 11 lunar sample displays for 135 nations, the fifty states of the United States and its possessions, and the United Nations. Each display included Moon dust from Apollo 11 and flags, including the one of the Soviet Union, taken along by Apollo 11. The rice-sized particles were four small pieces of Moon soil weighing about 50\u00a0mg and were enveloped in a clear acrylic button about as big as a United States half dollar coin. This acrylic button magnified the grains of lunar dust. Nixon gave the Apollo 11 lunar sample displays as goodwill gifts in 1970.[250][251]\n\n\n\n### Experiment results[edit]\n\n\nThe Passive Seismic Experiment ran until the command uplink failed on August 25, 1969. The downlink failed on December 14, 1969.[252] As of 2018[update], the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment remains operational.[253]\n\n\n\n### Armstrong's camera[edit]\n\n\nArmstrong's Hasselblad camera was thought to be lost or left on the Moon surface.[254]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere would be one change. Michael Collins, the CMP on the Apollo\u00a08 crew, began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery.[52] Lovell took his place on the Apollo\u00a08 crew, and when Collins recovered he joined Armstrong's crew as CMP. In the meantime, Fred Haise filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8.[53] Apollo 11 was the second American mission where all the crew members had prior spaceflight experience,[54] the first being Apollo 10.[55] The next was STS-26 in 1988.[54]\n\n\nDeke Slayton gave Armstrong the option to replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought Aldrin was difficult to work with. Armstrong had no issues working with Aldrin but thought it over for a day before declining. He thought Lovell deserved to command his own mission (eventually Apollo 13).[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe media accused Armstrong of exercising his commander's prerogative to exit the spacecraft first.[97] Chris Kraft revealed in his 2001 autobiography that a meeting occurred between Gilruth, Slayton, Low, and himself to make sure Aldrin would not be the first to walk on the Moon. They argued that the first person to walk on the Moon should be like Charles Lindbergh, a calm and quiet person. They made the decision to change the flight plan so the commander was the first to egress from the spacecraft.[98]\n\n\n\n### Pre-launch[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe requirement for the Sun angle was particularly restrictive, limiting the launch date to one day per month.[83] A landing just after dawn was chosen to limit the temperature extremes the astronauts would experience.[87] The Apollo Site Selection Board selected Site\u00a02, with Sites 3\u00a0and\u00a05 as backups in the event of the launch being delayed. In May 1969, Apollo 10's lunar module flew to within 15 kilometers (9.3\u00a0mi) of Site\u00a02, and reported it was acceptable.[88][89]\n\n\n\n### First-step decision[edit]\n\n\nDuring the first press conference after the Apollo 11 crew was announced, the first question was, \"Which one of you gentlemen will be the first man to step onto the lunar surface?\"[90][91] Slayton told the reporter it had not been decided, and Armstrong added that it was \"not based on individual desire\".[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Apollo 11 Mission Summary\". *Smithsonian Air and Space Museum*.

They then donned their space suits and began breathing pure oxygen. At 06:30, they headed out to Launch Complex 39.[104] Haise entered *Columbia* about three hours and ten minutes before launch time. Along with a technician, he helped Armstrong into the left-hand couch at 06:54. Five minutes later, Collins joined him, taking up his position on the right-hand couch. Finally, Aldrin entered, taking the center couch.[102] Haise left around two hours and ten minutes before launch.[105] The closeout crew sealed the hatch, and the cabin was purged and pressurized. The closeout crew then left the launch complex about an hour before launch time. The countdown became automated at three minutes and twenty seconds before launch time.[102] Over 450 personnel were at the consoles in the firing room.[101]\n\n\n\n## Mission[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter touchdown on *Hornet* at 17:53 UTC, the helicopter was lowered by the elevator into the hangar bay, where the astronauts walked the 30 feet (9.1\u00a0m) to the Mobile quarantine facility (MQF), where they would begin the Earth-based portion of their 21 days of quarantine.[197] This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions, Apollo 12 and Apollo 14, before the Moon was proven to be barren of life, and the quarantine process dropped.[198][199] Nixon welcomed the astronauts back to Earth. He told them: \"[A]s a result of what you've done, the world has never been closer together before.\"[200]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Aldrin salutes the deployed United States flag on the lunar surface.\nThe astronauts planted the Lunar Flag Assembly containing a flag of the United States on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Aldrin remembered, \"Of all the jobs I had to do on the Moon the one I wanted to go the smoothest was the flag raising.\"[152] But the astronauts struggled with the telescoping rod and could only insert the pole about 2 inches (5\u00a0cm) into the hard lunar surface. Aldrin was afraid it might topple in front of TV viewers, but gave \"a crisp West Point salute\".[152] Before Aldrin could take a photo of Armstrong with the flag, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission, which Nixon called \"the most historic phone call ever made from the White House.\"[153] Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but Frank Borman, who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief.[154]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Apollo in Real Time\u00a0\u2013 Interactive website of Apollo 11, 13, and 17\n* Exploration of the Moon\u00a0\u2013 Missions to the Moon\n* List of missions to the Moon\n* List of species that have landed on the Moon\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Eric Jones of the *Apollo Lunar Surface Journal* explains that the indefinite article \"a\" was intended, whether or not it was said; the intention was to contrast *a man* (an individual's action) and *mankind* (as a species).[14]\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\nIn some of the following sources, times are shown in the format *hours:minutes:seconds* (e.g. 109:24:15), referring to the mission's Ground Elapsed Time (GET),[285] based on the official launch time of July 16, 1969, 13:32:00 UTC (000:00:00 GET).[105][6]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n155. **^** \"Richard Nixon: Telephone Conversation With the Apollo 11 Astronauts on the Moon\". *The American Presidency Project*.

He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. As metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension.[157] In a 2010 interview, Armstrong explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk's time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts' PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon.[162]\n\n\n\n### Lunar ascent[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther key personnel who played important roles in the Apollo 11 mission include the following.[69]\n\n\n\n\n\nOther personnel\n| Name\n | Activities\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Farouk El-Baz | Geologist, studied geology of the Moon, identified landing locations, trained pilots\n |\n| Kurt Debus | Rocket scientist, supervised construction of launch pads and infrastructure\n |\n| Jamye Flowers\n | Secretary for astronauts\n |\n| Eleanor Foraker | Tailor who designed space suits |\n| Jack Garman | Computer engineer and technician\n |\n| Millicent Goldschmidt | Microbiologist who designed aseptic lunar material collection techniques and trained astronauts\n |\n| Eldon C.

These were the result of two years' worth of studies based on high-resolution photography of the lunar surface by the five uncrewed probes of the Lunar Orbiter program and information about surface conditions provided by the Surveyor program.[83] The best Earth-bound telescopes could not resolve features with the resolution Project Apollo required.[84] The landing site had to be close to the lunar equator to minimize the amount of propellant required, clear of obstacles to minimize maneuvering, and flat to simplify the task of the landing radar.

Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me.\"[84] This was not an off-the-cuff remark: Conrad had made a US$500 bet with reporter Oriana Fallaci he would say these words, after she had queried whether NASA had instructed Neil Armstrong what to say as he stepped onto the Moon. Conrad later said he was never able to collect the money.[85]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bean prepares to step onto the lunar surface\nTo improve the quality of television pictures from the Moon, a color camera was carried on Apollo 12 (unlike the monochrome camera on Apollo 11). When Bean carried the camera to the place near the LM where it was to be set up, he inadvertently pointed it directly into the Sun, destroying the Secondary Electron Conduction (SEC) tube. Television coverage of this mission was thus terminated almost immediately.[86][87]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nApollo 12 would have attempted the first lunar landing had Apollo 11 failed, but after the success of Neil Armstrong's mission, Apollo 12 was postponed by two months, and other Apollo missions also put on a more relaxed schedule. More time was allotted for geologic training in preparation for Apollo 12 than for Apollo 11, Conrad and Bean making several geology field trips in preparation for their mission. Apollo 12's spacecraft and launch vehicle were almost identical to Apollo 11's.

On November 19, Conrad and Bean achieved a precise landing at their expected location within walking distance of the Surveyor 3 robotic probe, which had landed on April 20, 1967. In making a pinpoint landing, they showed that NASA could plan future missions in the expectation that astronauts could land close to sites of scientific interest. Conrad and Bean carried the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package, a group of nuclear-powered scientific instruments, as well as the first color television camera taken by an Apollo mission to the lunar surface, but transmission was lost after Bean accidentally pointed the camera at the Sun and its sensor was destroyed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Robotic | * Lunar Polar Exploration Mission\n* ALINA\n* Artemis-7\n* Blue Moon\n* BOLAS\n* Garat\u00e9a-L\n* ISOCHRON\n* LunaNet\n* Lunar Crater Radio Telescope\n* McCandless\n* Moon Diver\n |\n| Crewed | * *DSE-Alpha*\n* *Boeing Lunar Lander*\n* *Lockheed Martin Lunar Lander*\n* *Lunar Orbital Station*\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| EVA duration | * Total: 7\u00a0hours, 45\u00a0minutes, 18\u00a0seconds\n* First: 3\u00a0hours, 56\u00a0minutes, 03\u00a0seconds\n* Second: 3\u00a0hours, 49\u00a0minutes, 15\u00a0seconds\n |\n|  |\n|  |\n| Docking with LM |\n| Docking date | November 14, 1969, 19:48:53\u00a0UTC[3] |\n| Undocking date | November 19, 1969, 04:16:02\u00a0UTC[3] |\n| Docking with LM ascent stage |\n| Docking date | November 20, 1969, 17:58:20\u00a0UTC[3] |\n| Undocking date | November 20, 1969, 20:21:31\u00a0UTC[3] |\n|  |\n| ![](image)\n![Apollo 12 crew](image)Left to right: Conrad, Gordon, BeanApollo program\n\u2190\u00a0Apollo 11\nApollo 13\u00a0\u2192\n |\n\n\n**Apollo 12** (November 14\u201324, 1969) was the sixth crewed flight in the United States Apollo program and the second to land on the Moon. It was launched on November 14, 1969, by NASA from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. Commander Charles \"Pete\" Conrad and Lunar Module Pilot Alan L. Bean performed just over one day and seven hours of lunar surface activity while Command Module Pilot Richard F. Gordon remained in lunar orbit.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfterwards, the astronauts' performance in choosing samples and taking photographs would be critiqued. To the frustration of the astronauts, the scientists kept changing the photo documentation procedures; after the fourth or fifth such change, Conrad required that there be no more.[25] After the return of Apollo 11, the Apollo 12 crew was able to view the lunar samples, and be briefed on them by scientists.[26]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe original Lunar Module pilot assigned to work with Conrad was Clifton C. Williams Jr., who was killed in October 1967 when the T-38 he was flying crashed near Tallahassee. When forming his crew, Conrad had wanted Alan L. Bean, a former student of his at the test pilot school, but had been told by Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton that Bean was unavailable due to an assignment to the Apollo Applications Program. After Williams's death, Conrad asked for Bean again, and this time Slayton yielded.[8] Bean, 37 years old when the mission flew, had graduated from the University of Texas in 1955 with a degree in aeronautical engineering. Also a naval aviator, he was selected alongside Gordon in 1963, and first flew in space on Apollo 12.[6][9] The three Apollo 12 crew members had backed up Apollo 9 earlier in 1969.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Launch site | Kennedy LC-39 A |\n|  |\n|  |\n| End of mission |\n| Recovered by | USS\u00a0*Hornet* |\n| Landing date | November 24, 1969, 20:58:24\u00a0(1969-11-24UTC20:58:25Z)\u00a0UTC |\n| Landing site | South Pacific Ocean 15\u00b047\u2032S 165\u00b09\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff15.783\u00b0S 165.150\u00b0W\ufeff / -15.783; -165.150\ufeff (Apollo 12 splashdown) |\n|  |\n|  |\n| Orbital parameters |\n| Reference\u00a0system | Selenocentric |\n| Periselene altitude | 101.10 kilometers (54.59\u00a0nmi)[3] |\n| Aposelene altitude | 122.42 kilometers (66.10\u00a0nmi)[3] |\n|  |\n|  |\n| Lunar orbiter |\n| Orbital insertion | November 18, 1969, 03:47:23\u00a0UTC |\n| Orbital departure | November 21, 1969, 20:49:16\u00a0UTC |\n| Orbits | 45 |\n| Lunar lander |\n| Spacecraft component | Lunar Module (LM) |\n| Landing date | November 19, 1969, 06:54:35\u00a0UTC |\n| Return launch | November 20, 1969, 14:25:47\u00a0UTC |\n| Landing site | Ocean of Storms 3\u00b000\u203245\u2033S 23\u00b025\u203218\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff3.01239\u00b0S 23.42157\u00b0W\ufeff / -3.01239; -23.42157 |\n| Sample mass | 34.35 kilograms (75.7\u00a0lb) |\n| Surface EVAs | 2 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe lunar coordinates of the landing site were 3.01239\u00b0 S latitude, 23.42157\u00b0 W longitude.[82] The landing caused high velocity sandblasting of the Surveyor probe. It was later determined that the sandblasting removed more dust than it delivered onto the Surveyor, because the probe was covered by a thin layer that gave it a tan hue as observed by the astronauts, and every portion of the surface exposed to the direct sandblasting was lightened back toward the original white color through the removal of lunar dust.[83]\n\n\n\n### Lunar surface activities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Communicationsand navigation | * Near Earth Network\n* Space Network\n* Deep Space Network (Goldstone\n* Madrid\n* Canberra\n* Space Flight Operations Facility)\n* Deep Space Atomic Clock\n |\n| NASA lists | * Astronauts\n\t+ by name\n\t+ by year\n\t+ Gemini astronauts\n\t+ Apollo astronauts\n\t+ Space Shuttle crews\n* NASA aircraft\n* NASA missions\n\t+ uncrewed missions\n\t+ Apollo missions\n\t+ Space Shuttle missions\n* United States rockets\n* NASA cancellations\n* NASA cameras on spacecraft\n |\n| NASA imagesand artwork | * *Earthrise*\n* *The Blue Marble*\n* *Family Portrait*\n\t+ *Pale Blue Dot*\n* *Pillars of Creation*\n* *Mystic Mountain*\n* *Solar System Family Portrait*\n* *The Day the Earth Smiled*\n* *Fallen Astronaut*\n* Deep fields\n* Lunar plaques\n* Pioneer plaques\n* Voyager Golden Record\n* Apollo 11 goodwill messages\n* NASA insignia\n* Gemini and Apollo medallions\n* Mission patches\n* Hubble Space Telescope anniversary images\n |\n| Related | * \"We choose to go to the Moon\"\n* Apollo 8 Genesis reading\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)\nThe Apollo 12 mission patch shows the crew's naval background; all three astronauts at the time of the mission were U.S. Navy commanders.

The mission name APOLLO XII and the crew names are on a wide gold border, with a small blue trim. Blue and gold are traditional U.S. Navy colors. The patch has four stars on it \u2013 one each for the three astronauts who flew the mission and one for Clifton Williams, the original LMP on Conrad's crew who was killed in 1967 and would have flown the mission. The star was placed there at the suggestion of his replacement, Bean.[107]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe stages of the lunar module, LM\u20136, were delivered to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 24, 1969, and were mated to each other on April 28. Command module CM\u2013108 and service module SM\u2013108 were delivered to KSC on March 28, and were mated to each other on April 21. Following installation of gear and testing, the launch vehicle, with the spacecraft atop it, was rolled out to Launch Complex 39A on September 8, 1969.[28] The training schedule was complete, as planned, by November 1, 1969; activities after that date were intended as refreshers. The crew members felt that the training, for the most part, was adequate preparation for the Moon mission.[29]\n\n\n\n## Hardware[edit]\n\n\n### Launch vehicle[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Yankee Clipper* returned to Earth on November 24, 1969, at 20:58 UT (3:58\u00a0pm Eastern Time, 10:58\u00a0am HST), in the Pacific Ocean. The landing was hard, resulting in a camera becoming dislodged and striking Bean in the forehead. After recovery by USS\u00a0*Hornet*, they entered the Mobile Quarantine Facility (MQF), while lunar samples and Surveyor parts were sent ahead by air to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory (LRL) in Houston. Once the *Hornet* docked in Hawaii, the MQF was offloaded and flown to Ellington Air Force Base near Houston on November 29, from where it was taken to the LRL, where the astronauts remained until released from quarantine on December 10.[105][106]\n\n\n\n## Mission insignia[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter raising a U.S. flag on the Moon, Conrad and Bean devoted much of the remainder of the first EVA to deploying the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP).[88] There were minor difficulties with the deployment. Bean had trouble extracting the RTG's plutonium fuel element from its protective cask, and the astronauts had to resort to the use of a hammer to hit the cask and dislodge the fuel element. Some of the ALSEP packages proved hard to deploy, though the astronauts were successful in all cases.[89] With the PSE able to detect their footprints as they headed back to the LM, the astronauts secured a core tube full of lunar material, and collected other samples. The first EVA lasted 3 hours, 56 minutes and 3 seconds.[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe commander of the all-Navy Apollo 12 crew was Charles \"Pete\" Conrad, who was 39 years old at the time of the mission. After receiving a bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering from Princeton University in 1953, he became a naval aviator, and completed United States Naval Test Pilot School at Patuxent River Naval Air Station. He was selected in the second group of astronauts in 1962, and flew on Gemini 5 in 1965, and as command pilot of Gemini 11 in 1966. Command Module Pilot Richard \"Dick\" Gordon, 40 years old at the time of Apollo 12, also became a naval aviator in 1953, following graduation from the University of Washington with a degree in chemistry, and completed test pilot school at Patuxent River. Selected as a Group 3 astronaut in 1963, he flew with Conrad on Gemini 11.[6][7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe ascent stage of LM *Intrepid* impacted the Moon November 20, 1969, at 22:17:17.7 UT (5:17\u00a0pm EST)\u00a03\u00b056\u2032S 21\u00b012\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff3.94\u00b0S 21.20\u00b0W\ufeff / -3.94; -21.20\ufeff (Apollo 12 Intrepid lunar module impact).[115] In 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) photographed the Apollo 12 landing site, where the descent stage, ALSEP, Surveyor\u00a03 spacecraft, and astronaut footpaths remain.[116] In 2011, the LRO returned to the landing site at a lower altitude to take higher resolution photographs.[117]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of artificial objects on the Moon\n* List of spacewalks and moonwalks 1965\u20131999\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe landing site selection process for Apollo 12 was greatly informed by the site selection for Apollo 11. There were rigid standards for the possible Apollo 11 landing sites, in which scientific interest was not a major factor: they had to be close to the lunar equator and not on the periphery of the portion of the lunar surface visible from Earth; they had to be relatively flat and without major obstructions along the path the Lunar Module (LM) would fly to reach them, their suitability confirmed by photographs from Lunar Orbiter probes. Also desirable was the presence of another suitable site further west in case the mission was delayed, and the sun would have risen too high in the sky at the original site for desired lighting conditions. The need for three days to recycle if a launch had to be scrubbed meant that only three of the five suitable sites found were designated as potential landing sites for Apollo 11, of which the Apollo 11 landing site in the Sea of Tranquility was the easternmost. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFour possible geologic traverses had been planned, the variable being where the LM might set down. Conrad had landed it between two of these potential landing points, and during the first EVA and the rest break that followed, scientists in Houston combined two of the traverses into one that Conrad and Bean could follow from their landing point.[90] The resultant traverse resembled a rough circle, and when the astronauts emerged from the LM some 13 hours after ending the first EVA, the first stop was Head crater, some 100 yards (91\u00a0m) from the LM. There, Bean noticed that Conrad's footprints showed lighter material underneath, indicating the presence of ejecta from Copernicus crater, 230 miles (370\u00a0km) to the north, something that scientists examining overhead photographs of the site had hoped to find. After the mission, samples from Head allowed geologists to date the impact that formed Copernicus[91]\u2014according to initial dating, some 810,000,000 years ago.[92]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSince Apollo 12 was to attempt the first lunar landing if Apollo 11 failed, both sets of astronauts trained for the same sites.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Failed landings | * Beresheet\n* Emirates Lunar Mission\n* Hakuto-R M1\n* Luna 5\n* 7\n* 8\n* 15\n* 18\n* 25\n* OMOTENASHI\n* Surveyor 2\n* 4\n* Vikram (Chandrayaan-2)\n* Peregrine Mission One\n |\n| Flybys | * 4M\n* *Apollo 13*\n* Chang'e 5-T1\n* Geotail\n* Galileo\n* ICE\n* Longjiang-1\n* Luna 1\n* 3\n* 4\n* 6\n* LunaH-Map\n* Lunar Flashlight\n* Lunar IceCube\n* LunIR\n* Mariner 10\n* NEA Scout\n* Nozomi\n* Pioneer 4\n* Ranger 5\n* STEREO\n* TESS\n* WMAP\n* Wind\n* Zond 3\n* 5\n* 6\n* 7\n* 8\n* PAS-22\n |\n\n |\n| Plannedmissions | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Orloff & Harland 2006, p.\u00a0577.\n19. **^** Phinney 2015, pp.\u00a083\u201384.\n20. **^** Phinney 2015, p.\u00a084.\n21. **^** Harland 2011, p.\u00a018.\n22. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Press Kit, p.\u00a073.\n23. **^** Harland 2011, p.\u00a077.\n24. **^** Jones, Eric M.

The S-IVB auxiliary propulsion system was fired, with the intent that the Moon's gravity slingshot the stage into solar orbit. Due to an error, the S-IVB flew past the Moon at too high an altitude to achieve Earth escape velocity. It remained in a semi-stable Earth orbit until it finally escaped Earth orbit in 1971, but briefly returned to Earth orbit 31 years later. It was discovered by amateur astronomer Bill Yeung who gave it the temporary designation J002E3 before it was determined to be an artificial object. Again in solar orbit as of 2021, it may again be captured by Earth's gravity, but not at least until the 2040s.[33][34] The S-IVBs used on later lunar missions were deliberately crashed into the Moon to create seismic events that would register on the seismometers left on the Moon and provide data about the Moon's structure.[35]\n\n\n\n### Spacecraft[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Apollo 8 specific | * *Earthrise*\n* Genesis reading\n |\n| Apollo 11 specific | * Command Module *Columbia*\n* Lunar Module *Eagle*\n* Tranquility Base\n* Goodwill messages\n* Lunar sample displays\n* Missing tapes\n* Anniversaries\n\t+ 50th Anniversary commemorative coins\n* In popular culture\n |\n| Apollo 12 specific | * Statio Cognitum\n\t+ Surveyor 3\n\t+ Surveyor crater\n* Bench Crater meteorite\n* J002E3\n* *Moon Museum*\n* Reports of *Streptococcus mitis* on the Moon\n |\n| Apollo 13 specific | * \"Houston, we've had a problem\"\n |\n| Apollo 14 specific | * Modular Equipment Transporter\n* Fra Mauro formation\n* Big Bertha\n* Moon tree\n |\n| Apollo 15 specific | * Journey\n* Lunar operations\n* Solo operations\n* Return to Earth\n* Hadley\u2013Apennine\n* *Fallen Astronaut*\n* Genesis Rock\n* Great Scott\n* Hadley Rille meteorite\n* Seatbelt basalt\n* Postal covers incident\n |\n| Apollo 16 specific | * Big Muley\n |\n| Apollo 17 specific | * *The Blue Marble*\n* Taurus\u2013Littrow\n* Tracy's Rock\n* Nansen-Apollo crater\n* Shorty crater\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Conrad and Bean rehearse their lunar surface activities before the mission\nThe Apollo 12 astronauts spent five hours in mission-specific training for every hour they expected to spend in flight on the mission, a total exceeding 1,000 hours per crew member.[22] Conrad and Bean received more mission-specific training than Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had.[23] This was in addition to the 1,500 hours of training they received as backup crew members for Apollo 9. The Apollo 12 training included over 400 hours per crew member in simulators of the Command Module (CM) and of the LM. Some of the simulations were linked in real time to flight controllers in Mission Control. To practice landing on the Moon, Conrad flew the Lunar Landing Training Vehicle (LLTV),[22] training in which continued to be authorized even though Armstrong had been forced to bail out of a similar vehicle in 1968, just before it crashed.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe LM's Descent Propulsion System began a 29-second burn at 109:23:39.9 to move the craft to the lower orbit, from which the 717-second powered descent to the lunar surface began at 110:20:38.1.[77] Conrad had trained to expect a pattern of craters known as \"the Snowman\" to be visible when the craft underwent \"pitchover\", with the Surveyor crater in its center, but had feared he would see nothing recognizable. He was astonished to see the Snowman right where it should be, meaning they were directly on course. He took over manual control, planning to land the LM, as he had in simulations, in an area near the Surveyor crater that had been dubbed \"Pete's Parking Lot\", but found it rougher than expected. He had to maneuver,[79] and landed the LM\nat 110:32:36.2 (06:54:36 UT on November 19, 1969), just 535 feet (163\u00a0m) from the Surveyor probe.[80] This achieved one objective of the mission, to perform a precision landing near the Surveyor craft.[81]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Delays in the LM's development pushed this mission to December 1968 as Apollo 8. But when one more delay occurred in readying the first LM for crewed flight, NASA approved and scheduled a lunar orbit mission without the LM as Apollo 8, pushing Conrad's backup mission to Apollo 9 in March 1969. Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton's practice was to assign a backup crew as the prime crew on the third following mission. If the swap of 8 and 9 had not occurred, Conrad might have commanded Apollo 11, the first mission to land on the Moon.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConrad was a fellow of the American Astronautical Society; New York Academy of Sciences; American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots.[11]\n\n\n\n## In popular media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Conrad appeared as a spokesman for American Express\nConrad was discussed at length in Tom Wolfe's 1979 book, *The Right Stuff*, about the pilots engaged in U.S. postwar research about rockets, although he was never mentioned in the 1983 film version.

The launch was the most harrowing of the Apollo program, as a series of lightning strikes just after liftoff temporarily knocked out power and guidance in the Command Module. Five days later, after stepping down from the ladder of the Lunar Module onto a landing pad, Conrad joked about his own small stature by remarking:\n\n\n\n\n> Whoopee! Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aPete Conrad[17]\n> \n\n\nHe later revealed that he said this in order to win a bet he had made with the Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci for $500 to prove that NASA did not script astronaut comments. Fallaci was convinced that Armstrong's \"One small step for man\" statement had been written for him and was not his own words.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Conrad preparing for water egress training in the Gemini Static Article 5 spacecraft\nFollowing his commission in 1953, Conrad was sent to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, for flight training. He was also trained at the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas. He was designated a Naval Aviator in September 1954[5] and became a fighter pilot. He excelled in Navy flight school, and he served for several years as an aircraft carrier-based fighter pilot in the Navy. Conrad also served as a flight instructor in Navy flight schools along the Gulf of Mexico.[6]\n\n\nNext, Conrad applied for and was accepted by the United States Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Patuxent, Maryland. His classmates were future fellow astronauts Wally Schirra and Jim Lovell. He graduated in 1958, as part of Class 20, and was assigned as a Project Test Pilot.[2]:\u200a83,\u200a146 Conrad became a captain in the U.S. Navy on December 11, 1969.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPete Conrad was born on June 2, 1930, in Philadelphia,[1] the third child and the first son of Charles Conrad (1892\u20131969) and Frances De Rappelage Conrad (n\u00e9e Vinson; 1899\u20131981), a well-to-do real estate and banking family.[2]:\u200a17,\u200a74\n\n\nThe Great Depression wiped out the Conrad family's fortune, just as it had those of so many others. In 1942, the family lost their manor home in Philadelphia, and then moved into a small carriage house, paid for by Frances's brother, Egerton Vinson. Eventually, Charles Sr., broken down by financial failures, left his family.[2]:\u200a43\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConrad set an eight-day space endurance record in 1965 along with his Command Pilot Gordon Cooper on his first spaceflight, Gemini 5. Later, Conrad commanded Gemini 11 in 1966, and Apollo 12 in 1969. After Apollo, he commanded Skylab 2, the first crewed Skylab mission, in 1973. On the mission, he and his crewmates repaired significant launch damage to the Skylab space station. For this, President Jimmy Carter awarded him the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978.\n\n\nAfter Conrad retired from NASA and the Navy in 1973, he became a vice president of American Television and Communications Company. He went on to work for McDonnell Douglas, as a vice president. During his tenure, he served as vice president of marketing, senior vice president of marketing, staff vice president of international business development, and vice president of project development. He died on July 8, 1999, from internal injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident, aged 69.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** \"Conrad\". *Astronautix*.

Eventually, he decided that he had had enough. After dropping his full enema bag on the desk of the clinic's commanding officer, he walked out.[2]:\u200a113\u2013119 His initial application to NASA was denied with the notation *not suitable for long-duration flight.*[8]\n\n\nAfter his NASA episode, Conrad returned to the Navy as a fighter pilot, serving in the Pacific Fleet's second operational F-4 Phantom II squadron, VF-96, on board USS\u00a0*Ranger*.[9] Thereafter, when NASA announced its search for a second group of astronauts, Mercury veteran Alan Shepard, who knew Conrad from their time as naval aviators and test pilots, approached Conrad and persuaded him to reapply.[10] This time, Conrad found the medical tests less invasive, and in June 1962 he was selected to join NASA.[3]\n\n\nHe logged more than 6,500 hours of flying time, with more than 5,000 hours in jet aircraft.[11]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> \n> **When you can't be good, be colorful.**\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2013Conrad's personal motto.[3]\n\nWhile at Princeton, Conrad met Jane DuBose, a student at Bryn Mawr, whose family owned a 1,600-acre (650\u00a0ha) ranch near Uvalde, Texas. Her father, Winn DuBose, was the first person to call Conrad \"Pete\" rather than \"Peter\", the name he had used since birth. Upon his graduation from Princeton and acceptance of his navy commission, Conrad and Jane were married on June 16, 1953. They had four sons: Peter, born in 1954; Thomas, born in 1957; Andrew, born in 1959; and the youngest, Christopher, born in 1960.[2]\n\n\nGiven the demands of his career in the Navy and NASA, Pete and Jane spent a great deal of time apart, and Pete saw less of his boys growing up than he would have liked. Even after he retired from NASA and the Navy, he kept himself busy. In 1988, Pete and Jane divorced.[9] Both Pete and Jane remarried.[25][26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConrad's \"long one\" referred to the jump from the Lunar Module's ladder to a landing pad, whereas Armstrong's \"small step\" referred to the small step from the landing pad onto the Moon's surface. Conrad's first words on the lunar surface were:\n\n\n\n\n> Oooh, is that soft and queasy.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aPete Conrad[17]\n> \n\n\nOne of the photos that Corad took during the mission with his own image visible on the helmet visor of Alan Bean was later listed on *Popular Science*'s photo gallery of the best astronaut selfies.[19]\n\n\n\n### Skylab[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Skylab 2\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn February 14, 1996, Conrad was part of the crew on a record-breaking around-the-world flight in a Learjet owned by cable TV pioneer, Bill Daniels. The flight lasted 49 hours, 26 minutes and 8 seconds.[22] Today the jet is on permanent static display at Denver International Airport's Terminal C.[2]\n\n\nA month before he died, Conrad appeared on ABC News *Nightline* and said, \"I think the Space Shuttle is worth one billion dollars a launch. I think that it is worth two billion dollars for what it does. I think the Shuttle is worth it for the work it does.\" In the last interview he gave before his death, Conrad sat down for PBS's *Nova* series and discussed where he felt the future direction of space travel should go. He considered returning to the Moon \"a waste of taxpayer money\", but recommended missions to Mars and asteroids.[23]\n\n\nIn 2006, NASA posthumously awarded him the Ambassador of Exploration Award for his work for the agency and science.[24]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1989, Conrad's youngest son, Christopher, was stricken with a malignant lymphoma. He died in April 1990, at the age of 29.[2]:\u200a230\u20131\n\n\nConrad met Nancy Crane, a Denver divorcee, through mutual friends. Conrad and Crane married in 1990.[27]\n\n\nConrad was a Cub Scout.[28] His recreational interests included golf, water skiing and auto racing, such as Formula Vee.[29]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\nConrad died on July 8, 1999, from internal injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident. While traveling with his wife and friends from his Huntington Beach home to Monterey, California, his motorcycle crashed on a turn. Conrad later died in a hospital in Ojai.[30] He was wearing a helmet at the time and was operating within the speed limit.[3] He was buried with full honors at Arlington National Cemetery,[31] with many Apollo-era astronauts in attendance.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Paul J. Weitz, (left) Charles Conrad Jr. (middle); and Joseph P. Kerwin (right); America's first space station crew would spend 28 days in space\nConrad's final mission was as commander of Skylab 2, the first crew to board the Skylab space station. The station had been damaged on its uncrewed launch, when its micrometeoroid shield tore away, taking one of two main solar panels with it and jamming the other one so that it could not deploy. Conrad and his crew repaired the damage on two spacewalks. Conrad managed to pull free the stuck solar panel by sheer brute force, an action of which he was particularly proud. The astronauts also erected a \"parasol\" solar shield to protect the station from intense solar heating, a function which the lost micrometeoroid shield was supposed to perform. Without the shield, Skylab and its contents would have become unusable.[20] President Jimmy Carter honored Conrad for this in 1978 by awarding him the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring this period, Conrad was invited to take part in the selection process for the first group of astronauts for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (the \"Mercury Seven\"). Conrad, like his fellow candidates, underwent several days of what they considered to be invasive, demeaning, and unnecessary medical and psychological testing at the Lovelace Clinic in New Mexico. Unlike his fellow candidates, Conrad rebelled against the regimen. During a Rorschach inkblot test, he told the psychiatrist that one blot card revealed a sexual encounter complete with lurid detail. When shown a blank card, he turned it around, pushed it back and replied, \"It's upside down\".[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPeople who have traveled to the Moon\n |\n| --- |\n| Walked on the Moon | * Neil Armstrong (Apollo 11)\n* Buzz Aldrin (Apollo 11)\n* Pete Conrad (Apollo 12)\n* Alan Bean (Apollo 12)\n* Alan Shepard (Apollo 14)\n* Edgar Mitchell (Apollo 14)\n* David Scott (Apollo 15)\n* James Irwin (Apollo 15)\n* John Young (Apollo 16)\n* Charles Duke (Apollo 16)\n* Harrison Schmitt (Apollo 17)\n* Gene Cernan (Apollo 17)\n |\n| Flew to the Moonwithout landing | * William Anders (Apollo 8)\n* Frank Borman (Apollo 8)\n* Jim Lovell (Apollo 8, Apollo 13)\n* Thomas Stafford (Apollo 10)\n* Michael Collins (Apollo 11)\n* Dick Gordon (Apollo 12)\n* Fred Haise (Apollo 13)\n* Jack Swigert (Apollo 13)\n* Stuart Roosa (Apollo 14)\n* Al Worden (Apollo 15)\n* Ken Mattingly (Apollo 16)\n* Ronald Evans (Apollo 17)\n |\n| * Apollo program\n* Saturn V\n* Command and Service Module\n* Lunar Module\n* Lunar Roving Vehicle\n* Exploration of the Moon\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## NASA career[edit]\n\n\n### Project Gemini[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Gemini 5 and Gemini 11\n\n![](image)Conrad following his Gemini 5 flight\n![](image)Conrad (right) with his Gemini 11 crewmate Dick Gordon, following their flight\nConrad joined NASA as part of the second group of astronauts, known as the New Nine, on September 17, 1962.[12] Regarded as one of the best pilots in the group, he was among the first of his group to be assigned a Gemini mission. As pilot of Gemini 5 he, along with his commander Gordon Cooper, set a new space endurance record of eight days. The duration of the Gemini 5 flight was actually 7 days 22 hours and 55 minutes, surpassing the then-current Russian record of five days. Eight days was the time required for the first crewed lunar landing missions.

Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, has a grove of trees that have been planted to honor the memory of the astronauts who have died. After Conrad's death, NASA planted a tree in his honor. During the dedication ceremony, his Apollo 12 crewmate Alan Bean used his speech to lighten the somber occasion by injecting a little levity, pretending to \"channel\" Conrad's instructions from the hereafter. Bean said Conrad wanted NASA to light his tree every Christmas season with colored lights instead of the white used for everyone else, in keeping with his motto \"when you can't be good, be colorful\". NASA has honored this request, and every Christmas since then, all of the trees in the grove have been lit with white lights\u2014except Conrad's tree, which has been lit with red lights.[2]:\u200axiii[32]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConrad tested many spacecraft systems essential to the Apollo program. He was also one of the smallest of the astronauts, 5\u00a0feet 6+1\u20442\u00a0inches (1.689 meters) tall,[14] so he found the confinement of the Gemini capsule less onerous than his Commander Gordon Cooper did. He was then named commander of the Gemini 8 backup crew, and later commander of Gemini 11 with pilot Richard Gordon. Gemini 11 docked with an Agena target vehicle immediately after achieving orbit. Such a maneuver was an engineering and flight test similar to what the Apollo Command Module (CM) and Lunar Module (LM) would later be required to do.

He was returning to Houston from a visit to ILC Industries in Delaware. On approach to Ellington AFB he was advised that the weather had deteriorated below minimums so he diverted to Hobby. During the night, instrument flight rules (IFR) descent, he suffered a generator failure at 800 feet and broke off the approach. He elected to divert to an airfield with better weather. He ran out of fuel as he reached Bergstrom AFB and was forced to eject at 3,700 feet. He landed about 100 yards from the base operations building and his airplane impacted in an open field about two miles away.\n\n\n\n## Post-NASA career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Jeffrey A.

He was selected to become an astronaut by NASA in 1963 as part of Astronaut Group 3, and was the fourth person to walk on the Moon.\n\n\nBefore becoming an astronaut, Bean graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from University of Texas at Austin in 1955 and re-joined the U.S. Navy\u2014he served as an enlisted member for a year after his high school graduation. He received his naval aviator wings in 1956 and served as a fighter pilot. In 1960, he graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, flew as a test pilot and was The New Nine selection finalist in 1962.\n\n\nHe made his first flight into space aboard Apollo 12, the second crewed mission to land on the Moon, at age 37 in November 1969. He made his second and final flight into space on the Skylab 3 mission in 1973, the second crewed mission to the Skylab space station. After retiring from the United States Navy in 1975 and NASA in 1981, he pursued his interest in painting, depicting various space-related scenes and documenting his own experiences in space as well as those of his fellow Apollo program astronauts. He was the last living crew member of Apollo 12.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\n### Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBean was born March 15, 1932,[3] in Wheeler, the seat of Wheeler County in the northeastern Texas Panhandle, to parents Arnold Horace Bean and Frances Caroline Bean (n\u00e9e Murphy), who lived from 1908 to 1983, and 1906 to 1981, respectively.[4][5][6] He considered Fort Worth his hometown.[7] He was of Scottish descent.[8] As a boy, he lived in Minden, the seat of Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana, where his father worked for the U.S. Soil Conservation Service.[9][10] Bean was a Boy Scout and he earned the rank of First Class.[11] He graduated from R. L. Paschal High School in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1949.[12][13] Following his high school graduation in 1949, Bean enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve.[14]\n\n\nBean received a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 1955, where he attended on a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) scholarship.[14] While at the university, he also joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.[15]\n\n\n\n### Military service[edit]\n\n\nHe was an Electronics Technician Striker at the NAS Dallas, Texas, until September 1950, when he was honorably discharged.[13] In January 1955, Bean was commissioned a U.S. Navy ensign through the NROTC at the University of Texas at Austin, and attended flight training.[12] After completing flight training in June 1956, he was assigned to Attack Squadron 44 (VA-44) at NAS Jacksonville, Florida, from 1956 to 1960, flying the F9F Cougar and A4D Skyhawk. After a four-year tour of duty,[16] he attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School (USNTPS) at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, where his instructor was his future Apollo 12 Commander, Pete Conrad, graduating in November 1960.[7][13] Bean took art classes at St. Mary's College of Maryland during this tour,[17] and flew as a test pilot on several types of naval aircraft. Following his assignment at USNTPS and aviation safety training with the University of Southern California (USC), he went through additional instruction with his old Attack Squadron 44,[13] and was assigned to Navy Attack Squadron VA-172 at NAS Cecil Field, Florida, flying the A-4 Skyhawks, during which time he was selected as a NASA astronaut.[14][18]\n\n\nBean logged more than 7,145 hours of flying time, including 4,890 hours in jet aircraft.[19]\n\n\n\n### NASA career[edit]\n\n\nBean was selected by NASA as part of Astronaut Group 3 in 1963 (after not being selected for Astronaut Group 2 the previous year).[20] He was selected to be the backup command pilot for Gemini 10, but was unsuccessful in securing an early Apollo flight assignment. He was placed in the Apollo Applications Program in the interim. In that capacity, he was the first astronaut to dive in the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator and a champion of the process for astronaut training.[21] When fellow astronaut Clifton Williams was killed in an air crash, a space was opened for Bean on the backup crew for Apollo 9. Apollo 12 Commander Conrad, who had instructed Bean at the Naval Test Pilot School years before, personally requested Bean to replace Williams.[14][18]\n\n\n\n#### Apollo program[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apollo 12\n\n![](image)Bean during suiting-up for Apollo 12 flight\n![](image)Bean on the Moon during Apollo 12\nBean was the Apollo Lunar Module pilot on Apollo 12, the second lunar landing. In November 1969, Bean and Pete Conrad landed on the Moon's Ocean of Storms\u2014after a flight of 250,000 miles and a launch that included a harrowing lightning strike. He was the astronaut who executed John Aaron's \"Flight, try SCE to 'Aux'\" instruction to restore telemetry after the spacecraft was struck by lightning 36 seconds after launch, thus salvaging the mission. They explored the lunar surface, deployed several lunar surface experiments, and installed the first nuclear power generator station on the Moon to provide the power source. Dick Gordon remained in lunar orbit, photographing landing sites for future missions.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pete Conrad, Dick Gordon, and Alan Bean pose with their Apollo 12 Saturn V Moon rocket in the background on the pad at Cape Canaveral on October 29, 1969\nBean had planned on using a self-timer for his Hasselblad camera to take a photograph of both Pete Conrad and himself while on the lunar surface near the Surveyor III spacecraft. He was hoping to record a good photo, and also to confuse the mission scientists as to how the photo could have been taken. However, neither he nor Conrad could locate the timer in the tool carrier tote bag while at the Surveyor III site, thus lost the opportunity. After finding the self-timer unit at the end of the EVA, when it was too late to use, he threw it as far as he could.[22] His paintings of what this photo would have looked like (titled *The Fabulous Photo We Never Took*) and one of his fruitless search for the timer (*Our Little Secret*) are included in his collection of Apollo paintings.[23][24]\n\n\nBean's suit is on display in the National Air and Space Museum.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Skylab[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Skylab 3\n\n![](image)Bean shaving during the Skylab 3 mission\nBean was the spacecraft commander of Skylab 3, the second crewed mission to Skylab, from July 29 to September 25, 1973. With him on the mission were scientist-astronaut Owen Garriott and Marine Corps Colonel Jack R. Lousma. Bean and his crew were on Skylab for 59 days, during which time they covered a world-record-setting 24.4 million miles.[19] During the mission, Bean tested a prototype of the Manned Maneuvering Unit and performed one spacewalk outside the Skylab. The crew of Skylab 3 accomplished 150% of its mission goals.[19]\n\n\n\n### Post-NASA career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bean, February 2009\nOn his next assignment, Bean was the backup spacecraft commander of the United States flight crew for the joint American-Russian Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.[19]\n\n\nBean retired from the Navy in October 1975 as a captain, and continued as head of the Astronaut Candidate Operations and Training Group within the Astronaut Office in a civilian capacity.[19][26]\n\n\nBean logged 1,671 hours and 45 minutes in space while at NASA, of which 10 hours and 26 minutes were spent in EVAs on the Moon and in Earth orbit.[19]\n\n\n\n## Painting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bean in his studio\nBean resigned from NASA in June 1981 to devote his time to painting. He said his decision was based on that, in his 18 years as an astronaut, he was fortunate enough to visit worlds and see sights no artist's eye, past or present, has ever viewed firsthand and he hoped to express these experiences through his art.[12]\n\n\nAs a painter, Bean wanted to add color to the Moon. \"I had to figure out a way to add color to the Moon without ruining it,\" he remarked. In his paintings, the lunar landscape is not a monotonous gray, but shades of various colors. \"If I were a scientist painting the Moon, I would paint it gray. I'm an artist, so I can add colors to the Moon\", said Bean.[27]\n\n\nBean's paintings include *Lunar Grand Prix* and *Rock and Roll on the Ocean of Storms*, and he used real Moon dust in his paintings.[28] When he began painting, he realized that keepsake patches from his space suit were dirty with Moon dust. He added tiny pieces of the patches to his paintings, which made them unique. He also used a hammer, used to pound the flagpole into the lunar surface, and a bronzed Moon boot to texture his paintings.[29]\n\n\nIn July 2009, for the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, Bean exhibited his lunar paintings at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington.[30]\n\n\n\n\n> But I'm the only one who can paint the Moon, because I'm the only one who knows whether that's right or not.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aBean describing his Moon painting capability[12]\n> \n\n\n## Personal life and death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alan Bean museum marker in Wheeler, Texas\n![](image)Bean presents a piece of Moon rock at the Gasometer Oberhausen in March 2010\nBean took a piece of Clan MacBean tartan to the Moon.[31] In recognition of his Scottish ancestry, Bean stated:\n\n\n\n\n> As I remember it, I took Clan McBean tartan to the Moon and returned it to Earth. [\u2026] I did, in fact, give a piece of the tartan to the Clan McBean and also to the St Bean Chapel in Scotland. And I've still got some of it in my possession. I did not, however leave any of it on the Moon.[32]\n> \n> \n\n\nHe married Sue Ragsdale, a fellow graduate of the University of Texas on April 19, 1955, shortly before her graduation.[33] With Ragsdale, Bean had a son, Clay, and a daughter, Amy Sue.[34][35]\n\n\nBean died on May 26, 2018, in Houston, Texas, at the age of 86.[36] His death followed the sudden onset of illness two weeks before while he was in Fort Wayne, Indiana.[35] At the time of his death, Bean was married to his second wife, Leslie, and was also survived by his sister, Paula Scott.[35]\n\n\nBean was interred in Arlington National Cemetery on November 8, 2018.[37]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nHe was awarded with several awards and decorations during his career. He received the Rear Admiral William S. Parsons Award for Scientific and Technical Progress,[19] the Godfrey L. Cabot Award for 1970,[19] the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Trustees Award,[19] the V. M. Komarov Diploma for 1973[19] and the AAS Flight Achievement Award for 1974.[19]\n\n\nBean received the Navy Astronaut Wings, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal (twice), the NASA Distinguished Service Medal (twice), and the National Defense Service Medal with bronze star.[13][19][38]\n\n\nBean was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983,[12][39] the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997,[40][41] the International Air & Space Hall of Fame in 2010,[42] and the National Aviation Hall of Fame for 2010.[43] He was also a fellow of the American Astronautical Society and a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots.[19]\n\n\nBean received the University of Texas Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1970 and the Distinguished Engineering Graduate Award.[44] Bean, the first Texan to walk on the Moon, was awarded the Texas Press Associations Texan of the Year Award for 1969.[45] The 1973 Robert J. Collier Trophy was awarded to NASA and the Skylab crew.[46] Bean was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Texas Wesleyan College in 1972, and was presented an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering Science degree from the University of Akron (Ohio) in 1974.[19] The city of Chicago held a parade and presented gold medals to the Skylab astronauts in 1974.[47] Bean was the recipient of F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale's prestigious Yuri Gagarin Gold Medal for 1973 in Sydney, Australia.[48] In 1975, President Ford presented Skylab commander Gerald Carr with the Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy at a White House ceremony, on behalf of all Skylab astronauts (including Bean).[49] Bean was a co-recipient of AIAA's Octave Chanute Award for 1975, along with fellow Skylab 3 astronauts Jack Lousma and Owen Garriott.[50] In 2019, Northrop Grumman named the spacecraft for the NG-12 mission the *S.S.

This was surgically corrected in 1968, and in 1971, Shepard commanded the Apollo 14 mission, piloting the Apollo Lunar Module *Antares*. He was the only one of the Mercury Seven astronauts to walk on the Moon. During the mission, he hit two golf balls on the lunar surface.\n\n\nShepard was Chief of the Astronaut Office from November 1963 to August 1969 (the approximate period of his grounding), and from June 1971 until April 30, 1974. On August 25, 1971, he was promoted to rear admiral, the first astronaut to reach that rank. He retired from the United States Navy and NASA on July 31, 1974.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Shepard was ranked as the ninth most popular space hero (tied with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Gus Grissom).[151] In 2011, NASA honored Shepard with an Ambassador of Exploration Award, consisting of a Moon rock encased in Lucite, for his contributions to the U.S. space program. His family members accepted the award on his behalf during a ceremony on April 28 at the U.S. Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, Maryland, where it is on permanent display.[152] On May 4, 2011, the U.S. Postal Service issued a first-class stamp in Shepard's honor, the first U.S. stamp to depict a specific astronaut. The first day of issue ceremony was held at NASA's Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.[153]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA graduate of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Shepard saw action with the surface navy during World War II. He became a naval aviator in 1947, and a test pilot in 1950. He was selected as one of the original NASA Mercury Seven astronauts in 1959, and in May 1961 he made the first crewed Project Mercury flight, Mercury-Redstone 3, in a spacecraft he named *Freedom 7*. His craft entered space, but was not capable of achieving orbit. He became the second person, and the first American, to travel into space. In the final stages of Project Mercury, Shepard was scheduled to pilot the Mercury-Atlas 10 (MA-10), which was planned as a three-day mission. He named Mercury Spacecraft 15B *Freedom 7 II* in honor of his first spacecraft, but the mission was canceled.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShepard was informed of his selection on April 1, 1959. Two days later he traveled to Boston with Louise for the wedding of his cousin Anne, and was able to break the news to his parents and sister.[57][58] The identities of the seven were announced at a press conference at Dolley Madison House in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959:[59] Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton.[60] The magnitude of the challenge ahead of them was made clear a few weeks later, on the night of May 18, 1959, when the seven astronauts gathered at Cape Canaveral to watch their first rocket launch, of an SM-65D Atlas, which was similar to the one that was to carry them into orbit. A few minutes after liftoff, it spectacularly exploded, lighting up the night sky. The astronauts were stunned. Shepard turned to Glenn and said: \"Well, I'm glad they got that out of the way.\"[61]\n\n\n\n### *Freedom 7*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mercury-Redstone 3\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe also bought a partnership in a ranch in Weatherford, Texas, that raised horses and cattle.[102] During this period, his secretary Gaye Alford had two \"mood-of-the-day\" photographs taken of Shepard, one of a smiling *Al* Shepard, and the other of a grim-looking *Commander* Shepard. To warn visitors of Shepard's mood, she would hang the appropriate photograph on the door of her boss's private office.[103] Tom Wolfe characterized Shepard's dual personalities as \"Smilin' Al\" and the \"Icy Commander\".[104]\n\n\n\n### Apollo program[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apollo 14\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShepard's high school alma mater in Derry, Pinkerton Academy, has a building named after him, and the school team is called the Astros after his career as an astronaut.[148] Alan B. Shepard High School, in Palos Heights, Illinois, which opened in 1976, was named in his honor. Framed newspapers throughout the school depict various accomplishments and milestones in Shepard's life. Additionally, an autographed plaque commemorates the dedication of the building. The school newspaper is named *Freedom 7* and the yearbook is entitled *Odyssey*.[149] Blue Origin's suborbital space tourism rocket, the New Shepard, is named after Shepard.[150]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** Brauchle, Robert (January 16, 2014). \"Commander Shepard Boulevard opens to motorists\". *Daily Press*.

Douglas. He was helped into his space suit by suit technician Joseph W. Schmitt, and boarded the transfer van at 03:55. He ascended the gantry at 05:15, and entered the spacecraft five minutes later. It was expected that liftoff would occur in another two hours and five minutes,[74] so Shepard's suit did not have any provision for elimination of bodily wastes, but after being strapped into the capsule's seat, launch delays kept him in that suit for over four hours.[75] Shepard's endurance gave out before launch, and he was forced to empty his bladder into the suit. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![An astronaut in an Apollo space suit with red stripes on the arms and legs and down the helmet stands amid gray dust, grasping the pole of an American flag](image)Shepard poses next to the American flag on the Moon during Apollo 14.\nFor this mission Shepard was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal[115] and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. His citation read:\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFaced with intense competition from the other astronauts, particularly John Glenn, Shepard quit smoking and adopted Glenn's habit of taking a morning jog.[62] On January 19, 1961, Gilruth informed the seven astronauts that Shepard had been chosen for the first American crewed mission into space.[63] Shepard later recalled Louise's response when he told her that she had her arms around the man who would be the first man in space: \"Who let a Russian in here?\"[64] During training he flew 120 simulated flights.[65] Although this flight was originally scheduled for April 26, 1960,[66] it was postponed several times by unplanned preparatory work, initially to December 5, 1960, then mid-January 1961,[67] March 6, 1961,[68] April 25, 1961,[69] May 2, 1961, and finally to May 5, 1961.[70] On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPost Office Building.[144] Alan Shepard Park in Cocoa Beach, Florida, a beach-side park south of Cape Canaveral, is named in his honor.[145] The City of Virginia Beach renamed its convention center, with its integral geodesic dome, the *Alan B.

His ashes were scattered at sea.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNeither Shepard nor Lovell expected there would be much difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14,[106] but Apollo 13 went disastrously wrong. An oxygen tank explosion caused the Moon landing to be aborted and nearly resulted in the loss of the crew. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they bumped into each other. The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The target of the Apollo 14 mission was switched to the Fra Mauro formation, the intended destination of Apollo 13.[108]\n\n\nShepard made his second space flight as commander of Apollo 14 from January 31 to February 9, 1971. It was America's third successful lunar landing mission. Shepard piloted the Lunar Module *Antares*.[109] He became the fifth and, at the age of 47, the oldest man to walk on the Moon, and the only one of the Mercury Seven astronauts to do so.[110][111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nShepard was elected its first president and chairman, positions he held until October 1997, when he was succeeded by former astronaut Jim Lovell. As of 2022, daughter Laura Churchley leads the foundation's board of trustees.[92]\n\n\nIn 1994, he published a book with two journalists, Jay Barbree and Howard Benedict, called *Moon Shot: The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon*. Fellow Mercury astronaut Deke Slayton is also named as an author. The book included a composite photograph showing Shepard hitting a golf ball on the Moon. There are no still images of this event, the only record is TV footage.[112] The book was turned into a TV miniseries in 1994.[124]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a key figure in the American space program, Shepard's life has been depicted in many biographical and historical works of fiction. In film, Shepard's selection for the Mercury program was covered in 1983's *The Right Stuff* (where he was played by Scott Glenn),[155] while 2002's *Race to Space* and 2016's *Hidden Figures* feature him in a minor role, played by Mark Moses,[156] and Dane Davenport, respectively.[157] The HBO miniseries *From the Earth to the Moon* starred Ted Levine as Shepard and covered not only his Mercury training but also his involvement in the Apollo missions.[158] Jake McDorman played Shepard in the 2020 TV adaptation of *The Right Stuff*,[159] while Desmond Harrington played him in the 2015 period drama *The Astronaut Wives Club*.[160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n129. **^** Skipper, Joe; Gorman, Steve (December 11, 2021). \"Daughter of pioneering astronaut Alan Shepard soars to space aboard Blue Origin rocket\".

In July 1971 President Richard Nixon appointed him as a delegate to the 26th United Nations General Assembly, a position in which he served from September to December 1971.[92] He was promoted to rear admiral by Nixon on August 26, 1971, the first astronaut to reach this rank.[116][117] He was succeeded as Chief of the Astronaut Office by John Young on April 30, 1974.[118] Shepard retired from both NASA and the Navy on July 31, 1974.[92]\n\n\n\n## Later years[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nShepard was designated Chief of the Astronaut Office in November 1963, receiving the title of Chief Astronaut.[100] He thereby became responsible for NASA astronaut training. This involved the development of appropriate training programs for all astronauts and the scheduling of training of individual astronauts for specific missions and roles. He provided and coordinated astronaut input into mission planning and the design of spacecraft and other equipment to be used by astronauts on space missions.[92] He also was on the selection panel for the NASA Astronaut Group 5 in 1966.[101] He spent much of his time investing in banks, wildcatting, and real estate. He became part owner and vice president of Baytown National Bank and would spend hours on the phone in his NASA office overseeing it. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSlayton put Shepard down to command the next available Moon mission, which was Apollo 13 in 1970. Under normal circumstances, this assignment would have gone to Cooper, as the backup commander of Apollo 10, but Cooper was not given it. A rookie, Stuart Roosa, was designated the Command Module Pilot. Shepard asked for Jim McDivitt as his Lunar Module Pilot, but McDivitt, who had already commanded the Apollo 9 mission, balked at the prospect, arguing that Shepard did not have sufficient Apollo training to command a Moon mission. A rookie, Edgar Mitchell, was designated the Lunar Module Pilot instead.[106][107]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Atkinson, Joseph D.; Shafritz, Jay M.

Webb announced that Mercury had accomplished all its goals and no more missions would be flown.[91] Shepard went as far as making a personal appeal to President Kennedy, but to no avail.[93]\n\n\n\n### Project Gemini; Chief Astronaut[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Shepard, in Navy uniform short and tie, stands before a blackboard on which is stencilled \"Student aviator USN \u2013 8-19-1946 class.

To make up for this, he took private lessons at a local civilian flying school\u2014something the Navy frowned on\u2014earning a civil pilot's license.[32] His flying skills gradually improved, and by early 1947 his instructors rated him above average.

He also served as president of his umbrella company for several business enterprises, Seven Fourteen Enterprises, Inc. (named for his two flights, *Freedom 7* and Apollo 14).[122] He made a fortune in banking and real estate.[123] He was a fellow of the American Astronautical Society and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, a member of Rotary, Kiwanis, the Mayflower Society, the Order of the Cincinnati and the American Fighter Aces, an honorary member of the board of directors for the Houston School for Deaf Children, and a director of the National Space Institute and the Los Angeles Ear Research Institute.[92] In 1984, together with the other surviving Mercury astronauts and Betty Grissom, Gus Grissom's widow, Shepard founded the Mercury Seven Foundation, which raises money to provide college scholarships to science and engineering students. It was renamed the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation in 1995. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nProject Gemini, with a crew of two, followed on from Project Mercury.[94] After the Mercury-Atlas 10 mission was canceled, Shepard was designated as the commander of the first crewed Gemini mission, with Thomas P. Stafford chosen as his pilot.[95] In late 1963, Shepard began to experience episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea, accompanied by a loud, clanging noise in the left ear. He tried to keep it secret, fearing that he would lose his flight status, but was aware that if an episode occurred in the air or in space it could be fatal. Following an episode during a lecture in Houston, where he had recently moved from Virginia Beach, Virginia, Shepard was forced to confess his ailment to Slayton, who was now Director of Flight Operations, and seek help from NASA's doctors.[96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
