It was directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga from a screenplay he co-wrote with Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, based on a story conceived by Purvis, Wade and Fukunaga.

In *No Time to Die*, Bond has left active service with MI6 and is recruited by the CIA to find a kidnapped scientist, which leads to a showdown with a powerful and vengeful adversary armed with a technology capable of killing millions. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt went on to debut to $55.2\u00a0million,[224][225] topping the box office and marking the fourth-best opening weekend of the franchise.[218] *No Time to Die* earned an additional $6.9\u00a0million on Columbus Day, bringing its four-day total in the United States and Canada to $62.2\u00a0million.[226][227] *Deadline Hollywood* attributed the slight underperformance to the film's 163-minute runtime limiting the number of showtimes.[226] *TheWrap* said that the opening was good news for cinemas, even if the studio did not break even during the film's theatrical run, and that it was an encouraging sign for upcoming adult-oriented pictures.[219] The film fell 56% in its second weekend to $24.3\u00a0million, finishing second behind newcomer *Halloween Kills*.[228] *No Time to Die* was re-released in IMAX for the weekend ending on 23 January 2022 as part of the 60th anniversary of the *Bond* film series.[229]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*No Time to Die* had its world premiere at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 28 September 2021, and was released in cinemas on 30 September 2021 in the UK and on 8 October 2021 in the US in 2D, RealD 3D, 4DX, ScreenX, Dolby Cinema and IMAX.[175][176] The film also opened the same week in September in South Korea and the following week in October in Brazil, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Russia. China and Australia would see the release later in October and November 2021. The film had the highest box office opening weekend takings in the UK for any *Bond* feature.[177][178]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrincipal photography wrapped up on 25 October 2019 at Pinewood Studios with the filming of a chase sequence set in Havana, Cuba.[148] Production had intended to shoot the sequence earlier, but was forced to reschedule when Craig injured his ankle in Jamaica.[97] Further pick-up shots at Pinewood were confirmed by Fukunaga on 20 December 2019.[149][150]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nVisual effects for *No Time to Die* were created by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Framestore, DNEG, and Cinesite.[151] Charlie Noble was the visual effects supervisor.[152] Post-production concluded without further changes, as the film's release date was delayed.[153]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: No Time to Die (soundtrack)\n\n![Composer Hans Zimmer](image)\n![Singer Billie Eilish](image)\nHans Zimmer (left) composed the film's score and Billie Eilish (right) performed the theme song.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n251. **^** Smith, Kyle (29 September 2021). \"*No Time to Die*: James Bond vs. the Pandemic\". *National Review*.

The critics consensus states: \"It isn't the sleekest or most daring 007 adventure, but *No Time to Die* concludes Daniel Craig's franchise tenure in satisfying style.\"[237] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 67 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[238] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an 83% positive score, with 63% saying they would definitely recommend it.[226]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUniversal Pictures Home Entertainment released *No Time to Die* on DVD, Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray in the UK on 20 December 2021 and in the US on 21 December 2021.[199][200] It was available from digital download services on 9 November 2021 in the US.[201] The 31-day theatrical release window of the film is considered a relatively quick turnaround for a film of this size. One factor has been that *Bond* films attract an older audience and that demographic has been hesitant to return to cinemas during the pandemic.[202][203]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*No Time to Die*'s opening weekend set a $119.1\u00a0million box office from 54 countries, including the United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico and Spain, besting its $90\u00a0million projections. It was the first film since the COVID-19 pandemic that crossed $100\u00a0million in an overseas debut without the China market.[220][221] *The Hollywood Reporter* stated the premiere was the biggest in the United Kingdom since the pandemic began.[222] In the United States and Canada, *No Time to Die* was projected to gross $65\u201385\u00a0million in its opening weekend.[223] The film made $23.3\u00a0million on its first day, including $6.3\u00a0million from Thursday night previews (which included $1\u00a0million from Wednesday previews), the best total of the franchise. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter being delayed by Boyle's departure and later by the COVID-19 pandemic, *No Time to Die* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 28 September 2021. It was theatrically released on 30 September 2021 in the United Kingdom and on 8 October 2021 in the United States. The film received positive reviews and grossed over $774 million worldwide, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2021 and the third-highest grossing Bond film. In addition to this, it had earned several other box-office record achievements, including becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time in the UK. The film was nominated for three awards at the 94th Academy Awards, winning Best Original Song, and received numerous other accolades.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nA young Madeleine Swann witnesses the murder of her mother by Lyutsifer Safin, whose family was assassinated by Swann's father Mr. White under orders from Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Swann shoots Safin and flees, falling into a frozen lake, but Safin rescues her.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*No Time to Die* grossed $160.9\u00a0million in the United States and Canada and $613.3\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $774.2\u00a0million.[2][3] It was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2021.[217] Because of the combined production and promotional costs of at least $350\u00a0million, it was estimated that the film would have needed to gross at least $800\u00a0million worldwide in order to break even.[218][219]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| No Time to Die |\n| --- |\n| ![The poster shows Daniel Craig as James Bond dressed in a tuxedo while holding a gun.

The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the action sequences, cast performances (particularly Craig's and Bautista's), and the musical score, but criticised the pacing and formulaic narrative decisions. It grossed $880 million worldwide, making it the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2015 and the second-highest grossing *James Bond* film after *Skyfall,* unadjusted for inflation. The film's theme song, \"Writing's on the Wall\", won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Original Song.

The film ended up grossing $70.4 million in its opening weekend (about $20 million less than *Skyfall'*s $90.6 million debut, including IMAX previews), but nevertheless finished first at the box office.[170] IMAX generated $9.1 million for *Spectre* at 374 screens, premium large format made $8 million from 429 cinemas, reaping 11% of the film's opening, which means that *Spectre* earned $17.1 million (23%) of its opening weekend total in large-format venues.

It is the sequel to *Casino Royale* (2006). Directed by Marc Forster and written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis, it stars Daniel Craig as Bond, alongside Olga Kurylenko, Mathieu Amalric, Giancarlo Giannini, Jeffrey Wright, and Judi Dench. In the film, Bond teams with Camille Montes (Kurylenko) to stop Dominic Greene (Amalric) from staging a *coup d'\u00e9tat* in Bolivia to access the country's natural reserves.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Quantum of Solace* premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 29 October 2008, and was theatrically released first in the United Kingdom two days later and in the United States on 14 November. The film received generally mixed reviews, with praise for Craig's performance and the action sequences but was deemed inferior to its predecessor. It grossed $589 million worldwide, becoming the seventh highest-grossing film of 2008 and the fourth-highest-grossing *James Bond* film, unadjusted for inflation. The next film in the series, *Skyfall*, was released in 2012.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n133. **^** \"Bond film smashes weekend records\". *BBC News Online*. 3 November 2008.

Daniel Craig admitted, \"I was unsure at first. Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, he wants his closure. Ian Fleming says that if you don't have a quantum of solace in your relationship then the relationship is over. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 63% based on 301 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Brutal and breathless, *Quantum Of Solace* delivers tender emotions along with frenetic action, but coming on the heels of *Casino Royale*, it's still a bit of a disappointment.\"[139] On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[140] Critics generally preferred *Casino Royale*, but continued to praise Craig's depiction of Bond, and agree that the film is still an enjoyable addition to the series. The action sequences and pacing were praised, but criticism grew over the realism and serious but gritty feeling that the film carried over.[141] The film earned an average grade of \"B\u2212\" from CinemaScore's audience surveys, on an A+ to F scale, the lowest of the Craig's era as Bond.[142]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Moving Picture Company created the climactic hotel sequence. The fire effects were supervised by Chris Corbould, and post-production MPC had to enhance the sequence by making the smoke look closer to the actors, so it would look more dangerous.[97] A full-scale replica of the building's exterior was used for the exploding part Bond and Camille escape from. The boat chase was another scene that required very little CGI. Machine FX worked on replacing a few shots of visible stuntmen with a digital version of Craig's head,[98] and recreated the boats Bond jumps over on his motorcycle to make it look more dangerous.[97] Crowd creation was done for the *Tosca* scene by Machine FX, to make the performance look like it had sold out.[98] Forster edited the opera scene to resemble *The Man Who Knew Too Much*.[66] In total, there are 900+ visual effects shots in *Quantum of Solace*.[97]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Quantum of Solace (soundtrack)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Carty, Ciaran (2 November 2008). \"'I felt there was pain in Bond'\". *Sunday Tribune*.

He praised the film's shorter runtime, claiming that many other *Bond* films run out of steam before the end, and included *Casino Royale* in this category. Describing the film as having a \"rock-solid dramatic idea and the intelligence to run with it\", he gave the film four stars out of five.[151]\n\n\nCraig retrospectively stated that the 2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike negatively impacted on the production and end result of *Quantum of Solace*,[152][153] During a 2021 interview on *The Empire Film Podcast*, Craig described the film as a \"shit-show\" and referred to it as one of his least favourite performances as Bond.[154]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Quantum of Solace* was the last in Ford Motor's three-film deal that began with 2002's *Die Another Day*.

And the ongoing shift of M, as played by Judi Dench, to front and centre: the Bond girls fade into insignificance as she becomes his moral counterpoint and theirs is the only real relationship on screen.\" The review continues, \"Bond is, as has been previously noted, practically the Martin Scorsese of the BAFTAs: 22 films later, with grosses probably close to the GDP of one of the small nations it depicts, it's still waiting for that Alexander Korda award. The best *Casino Royale* could achieve was a gong for sound.

He said that Forster likes to work very closely with his composers and that, in comparison to the accelerated schedule he was tied to on *Casino Royale*, the intention was to spend a long time scoring the film to \"really work it out.\" He also said he would be \"taking a different approach\" with the score.[104] Arnold composed the music based on impressions from reading the script, and Forster edited those into the film.[105] As with *Casino Royale*, Arnold kept use of the \"James Bond Theme\" to a minimum.[49] Arnold collaborated with Kieran Hebden for \"Crawl, End Crawl,\" a remix of the score played during the end credits.[106]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism.\"[145] *The Guardian* gave the film 3 stars, and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he \"made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage\" and calling the film \"a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement\"; it concludes \"*Quantum of Solace* isn't as good as *Casino Royale*: the smart elegance of Daniel Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up.\"[146]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA second Bond film starring Craig was planned before production began on *Casino Royale* in October 2005. In July 2006, Roger Michell was announced to direct with a planned release for May 2008, but he left the project that October after there were delays with the screenplay. Purvis, Wade, and Haggis completed the screenplay by June 2007, after which, Forster was announced as Michell's replacement. Craig and Forster also contributed uncredited rewrites to the film's screenplay. Principal photography began in August 2007 and lasted until May 2008, with filming locations including Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria, and Wales, while interior sets were built and filmed at Pinewood Studios. The film's title is borrowed from a 1959 short story by Ian Fleming. In contrast to its predecessor, *Quantum of Solace* is notable for citing inspiration from early Bond film sets designed by Ken Adam, while it features a departure from tropes associated with Bond villains.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
