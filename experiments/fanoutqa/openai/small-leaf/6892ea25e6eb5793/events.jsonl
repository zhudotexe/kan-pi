It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education, and co-sponsored by the Ministry of Education and the Hubei Provincial People's Government. The university is part of the Double First Class University Plan and Project 211.\n\n\nThe China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) and the China University of Geosciences (Beijing) are considered separate entities, although these two universities shared common history until 2005. CUG Wuhan and CUG Beijing have different constitutions, presidents, and governing boards, as well as separate legal entity registration, admission procedures, financial systems, Internet domains, and logos.\n\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n### Main Campus (Nanwangshan Mountain Campus)[edit]\n\n\nThe Main Campus of CUG is referred to as **Nanwangshan Mountain Campus**, because the campus was located at the foot of Nanwangshan mountain and it also has a tunnel which connect west campus and north campus running through the mountain. It has a large annual enrollment and has a wide range of courses other than geosciences.[1] Its Yifu Museum (donated by Sir Run Run Shaw) is known for housing China's top ranked displays of dinosaur fossils, mineral and rock specimens.[2]\n\n\n\n### New Campus (Future City Campus)[edit]\n\n\nThe New Campus of CUG was built in the Future technology city of Wuhan.[3]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1952–1970: Beijing Institute of Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe history of China University of Geosciences dates back to **Beijing Institute of Geology** (BIG; simplified Chinese: 北京地质学院; traditional Chinese: 北京地質學院; pinyin: *Běijīng Dìzhì Xuéyuàn*) which was a merger of the geology departments of Tsinghua University, Peking University, Tianjin University and Tangshan Railway College in 1952. It was among China's first 16 key universities back in the 1950s. The university suspended operations from 1966 to 1970 due to the Cultural Revolution.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n### 1970–1975: Hubei College of Geology[edit]\n\n\nIn 1970, the school reopened in Jiangling County, Hubei Province as **Hubei College of Geology** (simplified Chinese: 湖北地质学院; traditional Chinese: 湖北地質學院; pinyin: *Húběi Dìzhì Xuéyuàn*).[4]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n### 1975–1987: Wuhan College of Geology[edit]\n\n\nIn 1975 the campus was moved to Wuhan, and the school was renamed **Wuhan College of Geology** (WCG; simplified Chinese: 武汉地质学院; traditional Chinese: 武漢地質學院; pinyin: *Wǔhàn Dìzhì Xuéyuàn*). In 1978 BIG reopened in Beijing with the help of Deng Xiaoping. In 1986 the Chinese Government ratified the foundation of the Beijing Graduate School of WCG.

The two Chinese characters *Fu* (復, means \"again\") and *Dan* (旦, means \"morning\", \"light\" ), meaning both \"(heavenly light shines) day after day\" and \"Aurora Revived\", were chosen by Ma on the recommendation of Yu You-jen, from the Confucian Classic *Shangshu Dazhuan* (Chinese: 尙書大傳): \"Itinerant as the twilight, sun glows and moon luminesces\" (Chinese: 日月光華，旦復旦兮). The university motto \"Scientia et studium, quaestio et cogitatio\" comes from Analects Book 19.6 (Chinese: 博學而篤志，切問而近思), which means \"rich in knowledge and tenacious of purposes, inquiring with earnestness and reflecting with self-practice\".\n\n\nIn 1911, during the Xinhai Revolution, the college was occupied as headquarters of the Guangfu Army and closed down for almost one year.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1917, Fudan Public School became a private university named the Private Fudan University, and also had a middle school and university-preparatory school. In 1929, Fudan reorganized its departments, expanding to include departments of journalism, municipals[*clarification needed*], law, and education.[4]\n\n\nAfter the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, Fudan moved with the Kuomintang government to the inland city of Chongqing, the wartime Chinese capital. On December 25, 1941, the First Meeting of Fifth Conference of the Highest Executive Authority of the National Government of the Republic of China voted to change Fudan University (Chongqing) to a public university with Wu Nanxuan as its president. Fudan University then became National Fudan University. After the end of World War II, it moved back to Shanghai.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 1949 - present[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFudan University| 复旦大学 (Chinese)\n |\n| ![](image) |\n| Former names\n | * Fudan Public School (1905)\n* Fudan College\n* Private Fudan University (1917–1941)\n* National Fudan University (1941–1949)\n |\n| Motto | 博学而笃志，切问而近思[1] |\n| Motto in English\n | Rich in knowledge and tenacious of purposes, inquiring with earnestness and reflecting with self-practice[2] |\n| Type | Public |\n| Established | 1905; 119 years ago (1905) |\n| Founder | Ma Xiangbo |\n| President | Jin Li |\n| Party Secretary | Qiu Xin (裘新) |\n| Academic staff\n | 2,700 |\n| Administrative staff\n | 5,800 |\n| Students | 31,900 |\n| Undergraduates | 14,100 |\n| Postgraduates | 14,800 |\n| Location | 220 Handan Rd., Yangpu District, Shanghai\n, China\n |\n| Campus | 604 acres (244 ha) |\n| Affiliations | C9, Universitas 21, AEARU, APRU, BRICS Universities League, Council on Business & Society, ASRMU, Washington University in St. Louis McDonnell International Scholars Academy[3] |\n| Website | fudan.edu.cn |\n|  |\n|  |\n| Chinese name |\n| Simplified Chinese | 复旦大学 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Fudan lost its \"National\" appellation and became Fudan University to reflect the fact that all universities under the new socialist state would be public.

Fudan Tyndall Centre is funded with a 15-year commitment by the Chinese central government and the Shanghai City government. The UK launch of the Fudan Tyndall Centre alliance took place in Norwich in May 2011 when Professor Academician Yuliang Yang was awarded an honorary degree by the University of East Anglia[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Zibinyuan Building at Handan campus\nFudan has established a campus structure called \"one-body-two-wings\", where the body is Handan (邯鄲) campus and Jiangwan (江灣) campus, which are only 2 miles (3.2 km) apart, and the two wings are Fenglin (楓林) campus and Zhangjiang (张江, 張江) campus. All four campuses are in downtown Shanghai and share the same central administration.\n\n\n\n### Handan campus[edit]\n\n\nHandan campus, the main campus of Fudan, is located in Yangpu District, Shanghai. It contains the majority of the schools and departments. Freshman undergraduates live on this campus. Handan campus consists of four sub-campuses, namely the headquarters campus, the south campus, the north campus, and the east campus.\n\n\n\n### Fenglin campus[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Fudan has been placed consistently among the three most selective universities (with Tsinghua University and Peking University) in China for the last twenty years.[30][31][32][33] Fudan is one of the four universities (together with Tsinghua University, Peking University, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in China whose undergraduate programs are the hardest for students to get in: less than 0.2% of National College Entrance Examination (\"Gaokao\") takers can make it. (As a comparison, the five most selective Ivy League schools in 2012 let in three times the percentage (0.6%) of SAT-takers.)[34]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFudan has reconstructed its course system to suit education goals. A course scheme of general education, specialized education and basic education in arts and sciences has been implemented. Encompassing a complete and comprehensive range of disciplines, the courses of general education enable students to receive education in diverse fields. All of the 70-plus undergraduate majors of Fudan have been put into seven general categories so that students can benefit on a broader scale from the systematic discipline training. According to the Education Scheme for Arts and Sciences, course modules are determined by discipline systems and course suits, and credits by course modules. In this sense, Fudan provides students with more options for their college studies. In contrast with the traditional syllabus, the new module has appropriately decreased the gross credits and class hours. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Fudan University Library is divided into the China Academic Humanities and Social Sciences Library (CAHSL), the National Foreign Textbook Center for East China (sponsored by the Ministry of Education), the Documentation and Information Center for Liberal Arts, and the Central Stacks for Foreign Books of Liberal Arts. Additionally, the library has the Shanghai Electronic Documents Searching Center for Graduates, the CD Searching Center shared by the universities in Northeast Shanghai, and the General Search Station for Updated Science and Technology Information Authorized by the Ministry of Education, the Search Station for Updated Science and Technology Information Authorized by the Shanghai Science and Technology Committee. The library edits and publishes two journals: *China Index* and *Information Services of the Higher Education Institutions in Shanghai*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFudan University has established exchange relationships with more than 200 universities and research institutions in about 30 countries and regions,[47] including all 10 campuses of the University of California, Harvard University, Yale University, University of Chicago, Columbia University, University of Rochester, Georgetown University, Oklahoma State University, Beloit College, Washington University in St. Louis, University of Toronto, Mount Allison University, University of British Columbia, University of Montreal, Queen's University, York University, University of Sydney, LUISS Guido Carli University, University of Adelaide, Rhodes University, K.U. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1996, Fudan School of Management started a joint Master of Management (later MBA) program with BI Norwegian Business School. The program, inaugurated by then Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, is the longest continually operating international business school partnership in China.\n\n\n\nIn 2002, a joint venture was created between the Olin Business School (Washington University in St. Louis) and the School of Management at Fudan University. At the time, it was one of the first U.S.-Sino joint MBA programs in China. Eight years later, according to The Financial Times' 2010 rankings, the Washington University-Fudan University EMBA Program[42] was ranked as one of the top 20 international executive MBA programs worldwide. Also, in 2015, for the fifth consecutive year, it was hailed as the best program in the country.[43]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** \"Students protest at Shanghai's Fudan University\". *Asia Times*. 19 December 2019.
