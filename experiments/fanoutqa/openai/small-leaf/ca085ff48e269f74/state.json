For example, George Washington served two consecutive terms and is counted as the first president (not the first and second). Upon the resignation of 37th president, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford became the 38th president even though he simply served out the remainder of Nixon's second term and was never elected to the presidency in his own right. Grover Cleveland was both the 22nd president and the 24th president because his two terms were not consecutive. A vice president who temporarily becomes acting president under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution is not counted, because the president remains in office during such a period.\n2. **^** Reflects the president's political party at the start of their presidency. Changes during their time in office are noted. Also reflects the vice president's political party unless otherwise noted beside the individual's name.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe presidency of William Henry Harrison, who died 31 days after taking office in 1841, was the shortest in American history.[7] Franklin D. Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms.[8] Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPresidents of the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| Presidents andpresidencies | 1.

The first president, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College.[4] Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is therefore counted as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, giving rise to the discrepancy between the number of presidencies and the number of individuals who have served as president.[5] The incumbent president is Joe Biden.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Nardulli, Peter F., ed.

The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, no organized parties existed. Soon after the 1st Congress convened, political factions began rallying around dominant Washington administration officials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson.[12] Concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never affiliated with a political party.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMartin Van Buren\n |\n| 8 | ![Painting of Martin Van Buren](image) | **Martin Van Buren**(1782\u20131862)[29] | March 4, 1837\u2013March 4, 1841 |  | Democratic | 1836 | Richard Mentor Johnson |\n| 9 | ![Painting of William Henry Harrison](image) | **William Henry Harrison**(1773\u20131841)[30] | March 4, 1841\u2013April 4, 1841[e] |  | Whig | 1840 | John Tyler |\n| 10 | ![Black-and-white photographic portrait of John Tyler](image) | **John Tyler**(1790\u20131862)[31] | April 4, 1841[i]\u2013March 4, 1845 |  | Whig[j]\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Spetter, Allan Burton (2000) [1999]. \"Harrison, Benjamin\". *American National Biography*.

Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton formed the Federalist Party to promote national credit and a financially powerful nation. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson opposed Hamilton's agenda and founded the Jeffersonian Republicans. Washington favored Hamilton's agenda, however, and it ultimately went into effect\u2014resulting in bitter controversy.[247]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWashington frequently suffered from severe tooth decay and ultimately lost all his teeth but one. He had several sets of false teeth during his presidency. Contrary to common lore, these were not made of wood, but of metal, ivory, bone, animal teeth, and human teeth possibly obtained from slaves.[373] These dental problems left him in constant pain, which he treated with laudanum.[374]\n\n\nWashington was a talented equestrian, with Thomas Jefferson describing him as \"the best horseman of his age\".[375] He collected thoroughbreds at Mount Vernon, his two favorite horses being Blueskin and Nelson.[376] He enjoyed hunting foxes, deer, ducks, and other game.[377] He was an excellent dancer and frequently attended the theater. He drank alcohol in moderation but was morally opposed to excessive drinking, smoking tobacco, gambling, and profanity.[378]\n\n\n\n### Religion and Freemasonry[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Religious views of George Washington and American Enlightenment\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a respected military hero and large landowner, Washington held local offices and was elected to the Virginia provincial legislature, representing Frederick County in the House of Burgesses for seven years beginning in 1758.[55] He first ran for the seat in 1755 but was soundly beaten by Hugh West.[56][57] When he ran in 1758, Washington plied voters with beer, brandy, and other beverages. Despite being away serving on the Forbes Expedition, he won the election with roughly 40 percent of the vote, defeating three opponents with the help of local supporters.[58][59]\n\n\nEarly in his legislative career, Washington rarely spoke or even attended legislative sessions. He would later become a prominent critic of Britain's taxation policy and mercantilist policies towards the American colonies and became more politically active starting in the 1760s.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA Masonic lodge was established in Fredericksburg, Virginia in September 1752, and Washington was initiated two months later at the age of 20 as one of its first Entered Apprentices. Within a year, he progressed through its ranks to become a Master Mason.[396] Washington had high regard for the Masonic Order, but his lodge attendance was sporadic. In 1777, a convention of Virginia lodges asked him to be the Grand Master of the newly established Grand Lodge of Virginia, but he declined due to his commitments leading the Continental Army. After 1782, he frequently corresponded with Masonic lodges and members,[397] and he was listed as Master in the Virginia charter of Alexandria Lodge No. 22 in 1788.[398]\n\n\n\n## Slavery[edit]\n\n\nMain article: George Washington and slavery\n\nFurther information: Slavery in the colonial United States and Slavery in the United States\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**George Washington** (February 22, 1732\u00a0\u2013 December 14, 1799) was an American military officer, statesman, and Founding Father who served as the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797. Appointed by the Second Continental Congress as commander of the Continental Army in June 1775, Washington led Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War and then served as president of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which drafted and ratified the Constitution of the United States and established the American federal government. Washington has thus been called the \"Father of his Country\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nand often referred to the Anglican *Book of Common Prayer*.[389]\n\n\nWashington emphasized religious toleration in a nation with numerous denominations and religions. He publicly attended services of different Christian denominations and prohibited anti-Catholic celebrations in the Army.[390] He engaged workers at Mount Vernon without regard for religious belief or affiliation. While president, he acknowledged major religious sects and gave speeches on religious toleration.[391] He was distinctly rooted in the ideas, values, and modes of thinking of the Enlightenment,[392] but he harbored no contempt of organized Christianity and its clergy, \"being no bigot myself to any mode of worship\".[392] In 1793, speaking to members of the New Church in Baltimore, Washington said, \"We have abundant reason to rejoice that in this Land the light of truth and reason has triumphed over the power of bigotry and superstition.\"[393]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder Washington, the Virginia Regiment had defended 300 miles (480\u00a0km) of frontier against twenty Indian attacks in ten months.[43] He increased the professionalism of the regiment as it grew from 300 to 1,000 men, and Virginia's frontier population suffered less than other colonies. Though he failed to realize a royal commission, he gained self-confidence, leadership skills, and knowledge of British military tactics. The destructive competition Washington witnessed among colonial politicians fostered his later support of a strong central government.[44]\n\n\n\n## Marriage, civilian, and political life (1755\u20131775)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: George Washington's political evolution\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1788, Washington declined a suggestion from a leading French abolitionist, Jacques Brissot, to establish an abolitionist society in Virginia, stating that although he supported the idea, the time was not yet right.[436] Historian Philip D. Morgan wrote that Washington was determined not to risk national unity.[437] Washington never responded to any of the antislavery petitions he received, and the subject was not mentioned in either his last address to Congress or his Farewell Address.[438]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| George Washington\n |\n| --- |\n| ![Head and shoulders portrait of George Washington](image)Portrait, 1796\n |\n|  |\n| 1st President of the United States |\n| **In office**April 30, 1789\u00a0\u2013 March 4, 1797 |\n| Vice President | John Adams |\n| Preceded by | *Office established* |\n| Succeeded by | John Adams |\n| 7th Senior Officer of the United States Army |\n| **In office**July 13, 1798\u00a0\u2013 December 14, 1799 |\n| President | John Adams |\n| Preceded by | James Wilkinson |\n| Succeeded by | Alexander Hamilton |\n| Commander in Chief of the Continental Army |\n| **In office**June 19, 1775\u00a0\u2013 December 23, 1783 |\n| Appointed by | Continental Congress |\n| Preceded by | *Office established* |\n| Succeeded by | Henry Knox (as Senior Officer) |\n| 14th Chancellor of the College of William & Mary |\n| **In office**April 30, 1788\u00a0\u2013 December 14, 1799 |\n| President | James Madison |\n| Preceded by | Richard Terrick (1776) |\n| Succeeded by | John Tyler (1859) |\n| Delegate from Virginia to the Continental Congress |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Cheatham, Michael L.

He attempted to sell these but without success.[330] He became an even more committed Federalist. He vocally supported the Alien and Sedition Acts and convinced Federalist John Marshall to run for Congress to weaken the Jeffersonian hold on Virginia.[331]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWashington has been memorialized by monuments, a federal holiday, various media depictions, geographical locations including the national capital, the State of Washington, stamps, and currency. He is ranked among the greatest U.S. presidents. In 1976, Washington was posthumously promoted to the rank of General of the Armies, the highest rank in the U.S. Army. His legacy is marred, however, by his ownership of slaves and his complicated relationship with slavery, as well as his policy to assimilate Native Americans into the Anglo-American culture and waging war against Native American nations during the Revolutionary Wars and the Northwest Indian War.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life (1732\u20131752)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Washington family and British America\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Fishman, Ethan M.; Pederson, William D.; Rozell, Mark J.

His first doubts were prompted by his transition from tobacco to grain crops, which left him with a costly surplus of slaves, causing him to question the system's economic efficiency.[407] His growing disillusionment with the institution was spurred by the principles of the Revolution and revolutionary friends such as Lafayette and Hamilton.[408] Most historians agree the Revolution was central to the evolution of Washington's attitudes on slavery;[409] \"After 1783,\" Kenneth Morgan writes, \"...

He subsequently received military training and was assigned command of the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War. He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was named a delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which appointed him Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. Washington led American forces to a decisive victory over the British in the Revolutionary War, leading the British to sign the Treaty of Paris, which acknowledged the sovereignty and independence of the United States. He resigned his commission in 1783 after the conclusion of the Revolutionary War.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWashington played an indispensable role in adopting and ratifying the Constitution, which replaced the Articles of Confederation in 1789. He was then twice elected president by the Electoral College unanimously. As the first U.S. president, Washington implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry that emerged between cabinet members Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while sanctioning the Jay Treaty. He set enduring precedents for the office of president, including use of the title \"Mr. President\" and the two-term tradition. His 1796 farewell address became a preeminent statement on republicanism in which he wrote about the importance of national unity and the dangers regionalism, partisanship, and foreign influence pose to it.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Following the American Revolutionary War and prior to becoming president in 1801, Jefferson was the first U.S. secretary of state under George Washington and then the nation's second vice president under John Adams.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Thomas Jefferson](image)A 48-year-old Jefferson in 1791, depicted in a portrait by Charles Willson Peale\nSoon after returning from France, Jefferson accepted President Washington's invitation to serve as Secretary of State.[132] Pressing issues at this time were the national debt and the permanent location of the capital. He opposed a national debt, preferring that each state retire its own, in contrast to Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, who desired consolidation of various states' debts by the federal government.[133] Hamilton also had bold plans to establish the national credit and a national bank, but Jefferson strenuously opposed this and attempted to undermine his agenda, which nearly led Washington to dismiss him from his cabinet. He later left the cabinet voluntarily.[134]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe advocated enfranchising a majority of Virginians, seeking to expand suffrage to include \"yeoman farmers\" who owned their own land while excluding tenant farmers, city day laborers, vagrants, most American Indians, and women.[319]\n\n\nHe was convinced that individual liberties were the fruit of political equality, which was threatened by the arbitrary government.[320] Excesses of democracy in his view were caused by institutional corruption rather than human nature. He was less suspicious of a working democracy than many contemporaries.[319] As president, Jefferson feared that the federal system enacted by Washington and Adams had encouraged corrupting patronage and dependence. He tried to restore a balance between the state and federal governments more nearly reflecting the Articles of Confederation, seeking to reinforce state prerogatives where his party was in a majority.[319]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJefferson was a slave owner, but also condemned the slave trade in his draft of the Declaration of Independence and signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves in 1807. Since the 1790s, he was rumored to have had children by his slave Sally Hemings. According to scholarly consensus, Jefferson probably fathered at least six children with Hemings, including four that survived to adulthood.[14][15][16]\n\n\nAfter retiring from public office, Jefferson founded the University of Virginia. Presidential scholars and historians generally praise Jefferson's public achievements, including his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance, his peaceful acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from France, and the successful Lewis and Clark Expedition. Jefferson is consistently ranked among the top ten presidents in American history, though his relationship with slavery continues to be debated.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Early life and career of Thomas Jefferson\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJefferson was a member of the American Philosophical Society for 35 years, beginning in 1780. Through the society he advanced the sciences and Enlightenment ideals, emphasizing that knowledge of science reinforced and extended freedom.[414] His *Notes on the State of Virginia* was written in part as a contribution to the society.[415] He became the society's third president on March 3, 1797, a few months after he was elected Vice President of the United States.[415][416] In accepting, Jefferson stated: \"I feel no qualification for this distinguished post but a sincere zeal for all the objects of our institution and an ardent desire to see knowledge so disseminated through the mass of mankind that it may at length reach even the extremes of society, beggars and kings.\"[414]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJefferson subscribed to the political ideals expounded by John Locke, Francis Bacon, and Isaac Newton, whom he considered the three greatest men who ever lived.[303][304] He was also influenced by the writings of Gibbon, Hume, Robertson, Bolingbroke, Montesquieu, and Voltaire.[305] Jefferson thought that the independent yeoman and agrarian life were ideals of republican virtues. He distrusted cities and financiers, favored decentralized government power, and believed that the tyranny that had plagued the common man in Europe was due to corrupt political establishments and monarchies. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter resigning as secretary of state in 1795, Jefferson focused on the electoral bases of the Republicans and Federalists. The \"Republican\" classification for which he advocated included \"the entire body of landholders\" everywhere and \"the body of laborers\" without land.[327] Republicans united behind Jefferson as vice president, with the election of 1796 expanding democracy nationwide at grassroots levels.[328] Jefferson promoted Republican candidates for local offices.[329]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJefferson was firmly anticlerical, writing in \"every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty\u00a0... they have perverted the purest religion ever preached to man into mystery and jargon.\"[345] The full letter to Horatio Spatford can be read at the National Archives.[346] Jefferson once supported banning clergy from public office but later relented.[347] In 1777, he drafted the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Ratified in 1786, it made compelling attendance or contributions to any state-sanctioned religious establishment illegal and declared that men \"shall be free to profess\u00a0... their opinions in matters of religion\".[348] The Statute is one of only three accomplishments he chose to have inscribed in the epitaph on his gravestone.[349][350] Early in 1802, Jefferson wrote to the Danbury Connecticut Baptist Association that \"religion is a matter which lies solely between Man and his God\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n341. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"People and Ideas: Early America's Formation\". *Public Broadcasting Service*. Retrieved April 30, 2022. Like other Founding Fathers, Jefferson was considered a Deist, subscribing to the liberal religious strand of Deism that values reason over revelation and rejects traditional Christian doctrines, including the Virgin Birth, original sin and the resurrection of Jesus. While he rejected orthodoxy, Jefferson was nevertheless a religious man. [...] Influenced by the British Unitarian Joseph Priestley, Jefferson set his prodigious intellect and energy on the historical figure at the center of the Christian faith: Jesus of Nazareth. Jefferson became convinced that Jesus' message had been obscured and corrupted by the apostle Paul, the Gospel writers and Protestant reformers.\n342. **^** Jefferson Bible, 1820\n343. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Thomas Jefferson's Religion\n344. **^** Peterson, 1970, ch. 2 [e-book].\n345. **^** Wood, 2010, p. 577.\n346. **^** U.S. Gov: National Archives\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJefferson was steeped in the British Whig tradition of the oppressed majority set against a repeatedly unresponsive court party in the Parliament. He justified small outbreaks of rebellion as necessary to get monarchial regimes to amend oppressive measures compromising popular liberties. In a republican regime ruled by the majority, he acknowledged \"it will often be exercised when wrong\".[321] But \"the remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them\".[322] As Jefferson saw his party triumph in two terms of his presidency and launch into a third term under James Madison, his view of the U.S. as a continental republic and an \"empire of liberty\" grew more upbeat. On departing the presidency in 1809, he described America as \"trusted with the destines of this solitary republic of the world, the only monument of human rights, and the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and self-government\".[323]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBut he also controversially rejected fundamental Christian beliefs, denying the conventional Christian Trinity, Jesus's divinity as the Son of God and miracles, the Resurrection of Christ, atonement from sin, and original sin.[354][355][343] Jefferson believed that the original sin was a gross injustice and that God did not condemn all of humanity by the transgression of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.[343]\n\n\nJefferson's unorthodox religious beliefs became an important issue in the 1800 presidential election.[356] Federalists attacked him as an atheist. As president, Jefferson countered the accusations by praising religion in his inaugural address and attending services at the Capitol.[356]\n\n\n\n### Banks[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1. Prior to the passage of the Twelfth Amendment in 1804, each presidential elector would cast two ballots; the highest vote-getter would become president and the runner-up would become vice president. Thus, in 1796, the Democratic-Republican Party fielded Jefferson as a presidential candidate, but he came in second and therefore became vice president. |\n |\n\n| Articles related to Thomas Jefferson\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nUnited States Declaration of Independence\n |\n| --- |\n| * Physical history of the Declaration of Independence\n* Memorial to the 56 Signers\n* Founding Fathers\n* Syng inkstand\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Primary author | * Thomas Jefferson\n |\n| Signatories | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe was in Paris during the storming of the Bastille and consulted with Lafayette while the latter drafted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.[126] Jefferson often found his mail opened by postmasters, so he invented his own enciphering device, the \"Wheel Cipher\"; he wrote important communications in code for the rest of his career.[127][k] Unable to attend the 1787 Constitution Convention, Jefferson supported the Constitution but desired the addition of the promised bill of rights.[128] Jefferson left Paris for America in September 1789, intending to return to his home soon; however, President George Washington appointed him the country's first secretary of state, forcing him to remain in the nation's capital.[129] Jefferson remained a firm supporter of the French Revolution while opposing its more violent elements.[130] John Skey Eustace kept Jefferson informed of the events of the French Revolution.[131]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of State[edit]\n\n\nSee also: First Party System\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn May 1792, Jefferson became alarmed at the political rivalries taking shape; he wrote to Washington, imploring him to run for reelection that year as a unifying influence.[139] He urged the president to rally the citizenry to a party that would defend democracy against the corrupting influence of banks and monied interests, as espoused by the Federalists. Historians recognize this letter as the earliest delineation of Democratic-Republican Party principles.[140] Jefferson, Madison, and other Democratic-Republican organizers favored states' rights and local control and opposed federal concentration of power, whereas Hamilton sought more power for the federal government.[141]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJefferson is an icon of individual liberty, democracy, and republicanism, hailed as the author of the Declaration of Independence, an architect of the American Revolution, and a renaissance man who promoted science and scholarship.[433] The participatory democracy and expanded suffrage he championed defined his era and became a standard for later generations.[434] Meacham opined that Jefferson was the most influential figure of the democratic republic in its first half-century, succeeded by presidential adherents James Madison, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, and Martin Van Buren.[435] The Siena Research Institute poll of presidential scholars, begun in 1982, has consistently ranked Jefferson as one of the five best U.S. presidents,[436] and a 2015 Brookings Institution poll of American Political Science Association members ranked him as the fifth greatest president.[437]\n\n\n\n### Memorials and honors[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of places named for Thomas Jefferson\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Shuffelton, Frank (1974). \"Introduction\".

He used notes, letters, and documents to tell many of the stories within the autobiography. He suggested that this history was so rich that his personal affairs were better overlooked, but he incorporated a self-analysis using the Declaration and other patriotism.[278]\n\n\n\n### Greek War of Independence[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Thomas Jefferson\n |\n| --- |\n| ![Portrait of Jefferson in his late 50s with a full head of hair](image)Portrait by Rembrandt Peale, 1800\n |\n|  |\n| 3rd President of the United States |\n| **In office**March 4, 1801\u00a0\u2013 March 4, 1809 |\n| Vice President | * Aaron Burr (1801\u20131805)\n* George Clinton (1805\u20131809)\n |\n| Preceded by | John Adams |\n| Succeeded by | James Madison |\n| 2nd Vice President of the United States |\n| **In office**March 4, 1797\u00a0\u2013 March 4, 1801 |\n| President | John Adams |\n| Preceded by | John Adams |\n| Succeeded by | Aaron Burr |\n| 1st United States Secretary of State |\n| **In office**March 22, 1790\u00a0\u2013 December 31, 1793 |\n| President | George Washington |\n| Preceded by | John Jay (acting) |\n| Succeeded by | Edmund Randolph |\n| 2nd United States Minister to France |\n| **In office**May 17, 1785\u00a0\u2013 September 26, 1789 |\n| Appointed by | Confederation Congress |\n| Preceded by | Benjamin Franklin |\n| Succeeded by | William Short |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJefferson's writings and advocacy for human rights, including freedom of thought, speech, and religion, helped inspire the American Revolution, which ultimately led the successful American Revolutionary War. This in turn led to American independence, the Constitution of the United States, and the establishment of the United States as a free and sovereign nation.[13] He was a leading proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights, and produced formative documents and decisions at the state, national and international levels. During the American Revolution, Jefferson represented Virginia at the Second Continental Congress, which adopted the Declaration of Independence, and served as the second governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781. In 1785, Congress appointed Jefferson U.S. minister to France, where he served from 1785 to 1789. President Washington then appointed Jefferson the nation's first secretary of state, where he served from 1790 to 1793. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJefferson was a supporter of American expansionism, writing in 1801 that \"it is impossible not to look forward to distant times when our rapid multiplication will expand itself beyond those limits, and cover the whole northern, if not the southern continent.\"[324]\n\n\n\n### Democracy[edit]\n\n\n![Elder Jefferson](image)Jefferson, at age 78, depicted in an 1831 Thomas Sully portrait\nJefferson considered democracy to be the expression of society and promoted national self-determination, cultural uniformity, and education of all males of the commonwealth.[325] He supported public education and a free press as essential components of a democratic nation.[326]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Banner, James M.

He drafted 126 bills in three years, including laws to streamline the judicial system. He proposed statutes that provided for general education, which he considered the basis of \"republican government\".[83] Jefferson also was concerned that Virginia's powerful landed gentry were becoming a hereditary aristocracy and he took the lead in abolishing what he called \"feudal and unnatural distinctions.\"[87] He targeted laws such as entail and primogeniture by which a deceased landowner's oldest son was vested with all land ownership and power.[87] [h]\n\n\nJefferson was elected governor for one-year terms in 1779 and 1780.[89] He transferred the state capital from Williamsburg to Richmond, and introduced additional measures for public education, religious freedom, and inheritance.[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* American Revolution\n\t+ patriots\n* Member, Virginia Committee of Correspondence\n* Committee of the States\n* Founding Fathers of the United States\n* Historical reputation\n* Jefferson and education\n* Religious views\n* Jefferson and slavery\n* Jefferson and the Library of Congress\n* Jefferson Pier\n* Pet mockingbird\n* *National Gazette*\n* Sally Hemings\n\t+ Jefferson\u2013Hemings controversy\n\t+ Betty Hemings\n* Separation of church and state\n* *The American Museum* magazine\n* Tufton Farm\n* Governor's Palace (Williamsburg, Virginia)\n* Virginia dynasty\n* Ward republic\n |\n| Elections | * Presidential elections\n\t+ 1796\n\t+ 1800\n\t+ 1804\n |\n| Legacy andmemorials | * Bibliography\n* Jefferson Memorial\n* Mount Rushmore\n* Birthday\n* Thomas Jefferson Building\n* Jefferson River\n* Jefferson Territory\n* Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression\n* Jefferson Lecture\n* Jefferson National Expansion Memorial\n* Thomas Jefferson Star for Foreign Service\n* Statues\n* Karl Bitter statues\n* Hempstead statue\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Philosophy career** |\n| Notable work | * Declaration of Independence (1776)\n* *Notes on Virginia* (1785)\n* Jefferson's Manual (1801)\n* *Jefferson Bible* (1820)\n |\n|  |\n| Era | Age of Enlightenment |\n| Region | * Western philosophy\n* American philosophy\n |\n| School | * Liberalism\n* Deism\n |\n| Institutions | American Philosophical Society |\n| Main interests\n | * Politics\n* ethics\n* religion\n* philology\n |\n| Notable ideas\n | *See list*\n\n* + All men are created equal\n\t+ Empire of Liberty\n\t+ Entangling alliances\n\t+ Jeffersonian democracy\n\t+ Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\n\t+ Natural aristocracy\n\t+ Separation of church and state\n\t+ Strict constructionism\n\t+ Ward republic\n\t+ Views on education\n\t+ Views on Native Americans\n\t+ Views on slavery\n\t+ Views on religion\n |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThomas Jefferson was a philhellene, lover of Greek culture, who sympathized with the Greek War of Independence.[279][280] He has been described as the most influential of the Founding Fathers who supported the Greek cause,[280][281] viewing it as similar to the American Revolution.[282] By 1823, Jefferson was exchanging ideas with Greek scholar Adamantios Korais.[280] Jefferson advised Korais on building the political system of Greece by using classical liberalism and examples from the American governmental system, ultimately prescribing a government akin to that of a U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Thomas Jefferson and slavery\n\n![Farm Book page](image)Page 30 of Jefferson's 1795 Farm Book lists 163 slaves at Monticello.\nJefferson lived in a planter economy largely dependent upon slavery, and as a wealthy landholder, used slave labor for his household, plantation, and workshops. He first recorded his slaveholding in 1774, when he counted 41 enslaved people.[363] Over his lifetime he owned about 600 slaves; he inherited about 175 people while most of the remainder were people born on his plantations.[364] Jefferson purchased some slaves in order to reunite their families. He sold approximately 110 people for economic reasons, primarily slaves from his outlying farms.[364][365] In 1784, when the number of slaves he owned likely was approximately 200, he began to divest himself of many slaves, and by 1794 he had divested himself of 161 individuals.[366][r]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* \"Spanish Language\".

The Jeffersons returned to Shadwell in 1752. In 1753, Thomas attended the wedding of his uncle Field Jefferson to Mary Allen Hunt, and Field became a close friend and early mentor.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShortly after Jefferson died, attendants found a gold locket on a chain around his neck, where it had rested for more than 40 years, containing a small faded blue ribbon that tied a lock of his wife Martha's brown hair.[295]\n\n\nJefferson was interred at Monticello, under an epitaph that he wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> HERE WAS BURIED THOMAS JEFFERSON, AUTHOR OF THE DECLARATION OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE, OF THE STATUTE OF VIRGINIA FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND FATHER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.[296]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn his advanced years, Jefferson became increasingly concerned that people would understand the principles in the Declaration of Independence, and the people responsible for writing it, and he continually defended himself as its author. He considered the document one of his greatest life achievements, in addition to authoring the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom and his founding of the University of Virginia. Plainly absent from his epitaph were his political roles, including President of the United States.[297]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWe are all Republicans, we are all Federalists.\"[170][171] Ideologically, he stressed \"equal and exact justice to all men\", minority rights, and freedom of speech, religion, and press.[172] He said that a free and democratic government was \"the strongest government on earth.\"[172] He nominated moderate Republicans to his cabinet: James Madison as secretary of state, Henry Dearborn as secretary of war, Levi Lincoln as attorney general, and Robert Smith as secretary of the navy.[171]\n\n\nWidowed since 1782, Jefferson first relied on his two daughters to serve as his official hostesses.[173] In late May 1801, he asked Dolley Madison, wife of his long-time friend James Madison, to be the permanent White House hostess. She accepted, realizing the diplomatic importance of the position. She was also in charge of the completion of the White House mansion. Dolley served as White House hostess for the rest of Jefferson's two terms and then for eight more years as First Lady while her husband served as president.[173]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nThomas Jefferson\n |\n| --- |\n| * 3rd President of the United States (1801\u20131809)\n* 2nd Vice President of the United States (1797\u20131801)\n* 1st United States Secretary of State (1790\u20131793)\n* U.S. Minister to France (1785\u20131789)\n* Delegate to the Congress of the Confederation (1783\u20131784)\n* 2nd Governor of Virginia (1779\u20131781)\n* Delegate to the Second Continental Congress (1775\u20131776)\n* Delegate, Fifth Virginia Convention (1776)\n |\n| Foundingdocuments ofthe United States | * *A Summary View of the Rights of British America* (1774)\n* Olive Branch Petition (initial draft; 1775)\n* Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms (1775)\n* Declaration of Independence (1776)\n\t+ Committee of Five\n\t+ authored\n\t+ physical history\n\t+ \"All men are created equal\"\n\t+ \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\"\n\t+ \"Consent of the governed\"\n* Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, 1777 draft and 1786 passage\n\t+ Freedom of religion\n* Land Ordinance of 1784\n* Land Ordinance of 1785\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\u200b\n \u200b\n(m.\u00a01772; died\u00a01782)\u200b\n |\n| Children | * 6 with Martha Wayles, including: + Martha Jefferson Randolph\n\t+ Mary Jefferson Eppes\n* Up to 6 with Sally Hemings,[a] including: + Madison Hemings\n\t+ Eston Hemings\n |\n| Parents | * Peter Jefferson (father)\n* Jane Randolph (mother)\n |\n| Alma mater | College of William & Mary |\n| Occupation | * Politician\n* lawyer\n |\n| Signature | ![Thomas Jefferson signature](image) |\n| Military service |\n| Allegiance | United States |\n| Branch/service | Virginia militia |\n| Years\u00a0of service | 1775 - 1776 |\n| Rank | Colonel |\n| Unit | Albemarle County Militia |\n| Battles/wars | American Revolutionary War |\n| \n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 1806, a split developed in the Republican party, led by fellow Virginian and former Republican ally John Randolph, who viciously accused President Jefferson on the floor of the House of moving too far in the Federalist direction. In so doing, Randolph permanently set himself apart politically from Jefferson. Jefferson and Madison had backed resolutions to limit or ban British imports in retaliation for British seizures of American shipping. Also, in 1808, Jefferson was the first president to propose a broad Federal plan to build roads and canals across several states, asking for $20\u00a0million, further alarming Randolph and believers of limited government.[219]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the Washington administration negotiated the Jay Treaty with Great Britain in 1794, Jefferson saw a cause around which to rally his party and organized a national opposition from Monticello.[144] The treaty, designed by Hamilton, aimed to reduce tensions and increase trade. Jefferson warned that it would increase British influence and subvert republicanism, calling it \"the boldest act [Hamilton and Jay] ever ventured on to undermine the government\".[145] The Treaty passed, but it expired in 1805 during Jefferson's presidential administration and was not renewed. Jefferson continued his pro-France stance; during the violence of the Reign of Terror, he declined to disavow the revolution: \"To back away from France would be to undermine the cause of republicanism in America.\"[146]\n\n\n\n## Election of 1796 and vice presidency[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1796 United States presidential election and Democratic-Republican Party\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* \"American Philosophical Society\".

Jefferson sought a return to private life, and resigned the cabinet position in December 1793; he may also have wanted to bolster his political influence from outside the administration.[143]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![A leather-bound Bible](image)The *Jefferson Bible* feature only the words of Jesus from his disciples, written in parallel Greek, Latin, French, and English.\nBaptized in his youth, Jefferson became a governing member of his local Episcopal Church in Charlottesville, which he later attended with his daughters.[337] Jefferson, however, spurned Biblical views of Christianity.[338] Influenced by Deist authors during his college years, Jefferson abandoned orthodox Christianity after his review of New Testament teachings.[339][340] Jefferson has sometimes been portrayed as a follower of the liberal religious strand of Deism that values reason over revelation.[341] Nonetheless, in 1803, Jefferson asserted, \"I am Christian, in the only sense in which [Jesus] wished any one to be\".[222]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJefferson wrote letters and speeches prolifically, and these show him to be conversant and well-read in the philosophical literature of his day and of antiquity. Nevertheless, some scholars do not take Jefferson seriously as a philosopher mainly because he did not produce a formal work on philosophy. However, he has been described as one of the most outstanding philosophical figures of his time because his work provided the theoretical background to, and the substance of, the social and political events of the revolutionary years and the period of the development of the American Constitution in the 1770s and 1780s.[311] Jefferson continued to attend to more theoretical questions of natural philosophy and subsequently left behind a rich philosophical legacy in the form of presidential messages, letters to philosophically minded people, and public papers.[312]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the Congress' 1783\u20131784 session, Jefferson acted as chairman of committees to establish a viable system of government for the new Republic and to propose a policy for the settlement of the western territories. He was the principal author of the Land Ordinance of 1784, whereby Virginia ceded to the national government the vast area that it claimed northwest of the Ohio River. He insisted that this territory should not be used as colonial territory by any of the thirteen states, but that it should be divided into sections that could become states. He plotted borders for nine new states in their initial stages and wrote an ordinance banning slavery in all the nation's territories. Congress made extensive revisions, and rejected the ban on slavery.[112][113] The provisions banning slavery, known as the \"Jefferson Proviso\", were modified and implemented three years later in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and became the law for the entire Northwest Territory.[112]\n\n\n\n## Minister to France[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Though most historians have found little indication of his religious leanings after he left college,[272] some scholars indicate he leaned toward deism.[273][274] Others maintain that Madison accepted Christian tenets and formed his outlook on life with a Christian worldview.[275] Regardless of his own religious beliefs, Madison believed in religious liberty, and he advocated for Virginia's disestablishment of religious institutions sponsored by the state.[276] He also opposed the appointments of chaplains for Congress and the armed forces, arguing that the appointments produce religious exclusion as well as political disharmony.[277][278]\n\n\n\n## Slavery[edit]\n\n\nMain article: James Madison and slavery\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| James Madison\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)1816 portrait\n |\n|  |\n| 4th President of the United States |\n| **In office**March 4, 1809\u00a0\u2013 March 4, 1817[1] |\n| Vice President | * George Clinton (1809\u20131812)\n* *None* (1812\u20131813)[a]\n* Elbridge Gerry (1813\u20131814)\n* *None* (1814\u20131817)[a]\n |\n| Preceded by | Thomas Jefferson |\n| Succeeded by | James Monroe |\n| 5th United States Secretary of State |\n| **In office**May 2, 1801\u00a0\u2013 March 3, 1809[3] |\n| President | Thomas Jefferson |\n| Preceded by | John Marshall |\n| Succeeded by | Robert Smith |\n| Member of the U.S. House of Representativesfrom Virginia |\n| **In office**March 4, 1789\u00a0\u2013 March 4, 1797[4] |\n| Preceded by | *Constituency established* |\n| Succeeded by | John Dawson |\n| Constituency | * 5th district (1789\u20131793)\n* 15th district (1793\u20131797)\n |\n| Delegate from Virginia to the Congress of the Confederation |\n| **In office**November 6, 1786\u00a0\u2013 October 30, 1787[5] |\n| **In office**March 1, 1781\u00a0\u2013 November 1, 1783 |\n|  |\n| Personal details |\n| Born | James Madison Jr.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**James Madison** (March 16, 1751[b]\u00a0\u2013 June 28, 1836) was an American statesman, diplomat, and Founding Father who served as the fourth president of the United States from 1809 to 1817. Madison is hailed as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his pivotal role in drafting and promoting the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat amendment, which guaranteed freedom of religion and disestablished the Church of England, was passed in 1786.[53] Madison also became a land speculator, purchasing land along the Mohawk River in partnership with another Jefferson prot\u00e9g\u00e9, James Monroe.[54] Throughout the 1780s, Madison became increasingly worried about the disunity of the states and the weakness of the central government after the end of the Revolutionary War.[55] He believed that direct democracy caused social decay and that a Republican government would be effective against partisanship and factionalism.[56][57][58] He was particularly troubled by laws that legalized paper money and denied diplomatic immunity to ambassadors from other countries.[59] Madison was also concerned about the lack of ability in Congress to capably create foreign policy, protect American trade, and foster the settlement of the lands between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River.[60] As Madison wrote, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMadison was born into a prominent slave-owning planter family in Virginia. He served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and the Continental Congress during and after the American Revolutionary War. Dissatisfied with the weak national government established by the Articles of Confederation, he helped organize the Constitutional Convention, which produced a new constitution designed to strengthen republican government against democratic assembly. Madison's Virginia Plan was the basis for the convention's deliberations, and he was an influential voice at the convention. He became one of the leaders in the movement to ratify the Constitution and joined Alexander Hamilton and John Jay in writing *The Federalist Papers*, a series of pro-ratification essays that remains prominent among works of political science in American history. Madison emerged as an important leader in the House of Representatives and was a close adviser to President George Washington.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* James Madison Sr. (father)\n* Eleanor Madison (mother)\n* William Madison (brother)\n* Ambrose Madison (grandfather)\n |\n| * **\u2190 Thomas Jefferson**\n* **James Monroe \u2192**\n* **![](image) Category:James Madison**\n |\n\n| Offices and distinctions\n |\n| --- |\n| | U.S. House of Representatives |\n| --- |\n| **New constituency** |  **Member of the U.S. House of Representativesfrom Virginia's 5th congressional district** 1789\u20131793\n | Succeeded\u00a0byGeorge Hancock\n |\n|  **Member of the U.S. House of Representativesfrom Virginia's 15th congressional district** 1793\u20131797\n | Succeeded\u00a0byJohn Dawson\n |\n| Political offices\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byJohn Marshall\n |  **United States Secretary of State** 1801\u20131809\n | Succeeded\u00a0byRobert Smith\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byThomas Jefferson\n |  **President of the United States** 1809\u20131817\n | Succeeded\u00a0byJames Monroe\n |\n| Party political offices\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byThomas Jefferson\n |  **Democratic\u2013Republican nominee for President of the United States** 1808, 1812 | Succeeded\u00a0byJames Monroe\n |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter Virginia ratified the constitution, Madison returned to New York and resumed his duties in the Congress of the Confederation. After Madison was defeated in his bid for the Senate, and with concerns for both his political career and the possibility that Patrick Henry and his allies would arrange for a second constitutional convention, Madison ran for the House of Representatives.[91][92][93] Henry and the Anti-Federalists were in firm control of the General Assembly in the autumn of 1788.[93] At Henry's behest, the Virginia legislature designed to deny Madison a seat, and created congressional districts. Henry and his supporters ensured that Orange County was in a district heavily populated with Anti-Federalists, roughly three to one, to oppose Madison.[93][94] This practice is called *gerrymandering*.[93] Henry also recruited James Monroe, a strong challenger to Madison. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n(1751-03-16)March 16, 1751Port Conway, Virginia, British\u00a0America |\n| Died | June 28, 1836(1836-06-28) (aged\u00a085)Montpelier, Virginia, U.S. |\n| Political party | Democratic\u2013Republican |\n| Height | 5\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (163\u00a0cm)[6] |\n| Spouse | \nDolley Payne\n \u200b\n(m.\u00a01794)\u200b\n |\n| Parents | * James Madison Sr. (father)\n* Eleanor Conway Madison (mother)\n |\n| Education | College of New Jersey (BA) |\n| Signature | ![James Madison signature](image) |\n| Military service |\n| Allegiance | United States |\n| Branch/service | Virginia militia |\n| Years\u00a0of service | 1775 - 17761814 |\n| Rank | ColonelCommander in Chief |\n| Unit | Orange County Militia |\n| Battles/wars | American Revolutionary War\nWar of 1812\n* Battle of Bladensburg\n |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring and after the War of 1812, Madison came to support several of the policies that he opposed in the 1790s, including the national bank, a strong navy, and direct taxes.[314] Wood notes that many historians struggle to understand Madison, but Wood looks at him in the terms of Madison's own times\u2014as a nationalist but one with a different conception of nationalism than that of the Federalists.[313] Gary Rosen uses other approaches to suggest Madison's consistency.[315] Historian Garry Wills wrote, \"Madison's claim on our admiration does not rest on a perfect consistency, any more than it rests on his presidency. He has other virtues. \u00a0... As a framer and defender of the Constitution he had no peer. \u00a0... No man could do everything for the country\u2014not even Washington. Madison did more than most, and did some things better than any. That was quite enough.\"[316]\n\n\n\n### Popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRetiring from public office at the end of his presidency in 1817, Madison returned to his plantation, Montpelier, and died there in 1836. During his lifetime, Madison was a slave owner. In 1783, to prevent a slave rebellion at Montpelier, Madison freed one of his slaves. He did not free any slaves in his will. Among historians, Madison is considered one of the most important Founding Fathers of the United States. Leading historians have generally ranked him as an above-average president, although they are critical of his endorsement of slavery and his leadership during the War of 1812. Madison's name is commemorated in many landmarks across the nation, both publicly and privately, with prominent examples including Madison Square Garden, James Madison University, the James Madison Memorial Building, and the USS\u00a0*James Madison*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs an advocate of westward expansion, he insisted that the new nation had to ensure its right to navigation on the Mississippi River and control of all lands east of it in the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War.[51] Following his term in Congress, Madison won election to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1784.[52]\n\n\n\n## Ratification of the Constitution[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: James Madison as Father of the Constitution and Constitutional Convention (United States)\n\nFurther information: Confederation period\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRegarded as one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, Madison had a wide influence on the founding of the nation and upon the early development of American constitutional government and foreign policy.

He retained the position as college chancellor for ten years until his death in 1836.[259]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Madison, James (1908). *The Writings of James Madison: 1808\u20131819; Volume VIII*.

Madison had proposed liberalizing the article on religious freedom, but the larger Virginia Convention stripped the proposed constitution of the more radical language of \"free expression\" of faith to the less controversial mention of highlighting \"tolerance\" within religion. Other amendments by the committee and the entire Convention included the addition of a section on the right to a uniform government.[46] Madison again served on the Council of State, from 1777 to 1779, when he was elected to the Second Continental Congress, the governing body of the United States.[c]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Labunski, Richard (2006). *James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights*.

Madison believed that the Alien and Sedition Acts formed a dangerous precedent, by giving the government the power to look past the natural rights of its people in the name of national security.[146][147] In response to the Alien and Sedition Acts, Jefferson argued that the states had the power to nullify federal law on the basis of the Constitution was a compact among the states. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Image of Jefferson who was a close friend and confidant of Madison.](image)Thomas Jefferson founded the Democratic-Republican Party with Madison and broadly represented Southern interests.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMadison called slavery \"the most oppressive dominion\" that ever existed,[293] and he had a \"lifelong abhorrence\" for it.[294] In 1785 Madison spoke in the Virginia Assembly favoring a bill that Thomas Jefferson had proposed for the gradual abolition of slavery, and he also helped defeat a bill designed to outlaw the manumission of individual slaves.[294] As a slaveholder, Madison was aware that owning slaves was not consistent with revolutionary values,[295] but, as a pragmatist, this sort of self-contradiction was a common feature in his political career.[296] Historian Drew R. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n[94] Locked in a difficult race against Monroe, Madison promised to support a series of constitutional amendments to protect individual liberties.[91] In an open letter, Madison wrote that, while he had opposed requiring alterations to the Constitution before ratification, he now believed that \"amendments, if pursued with a proper moderation and in a proper mode\u00a0... may serve the double purpose of satisfying the minds of well-meaning opponents, and of providing additional guards in favor of liberty.\"[95] Madison's promise paid off, as in Virginia's 5th district election, he gained a seat in Congress with 57 percent of the vote.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1829, at the age of 78, Madison was chosen as a representative to the Virginia Constitutional Convention for revision of the commonwealth's constitution. It was his last appearance as a statesman. Apportionment of adequate representation was the central issue at the convention for the western districts of Virginia. The increased population in the Piedmont and western parts of the state were not proportionately represented in the legislature. Western reformers also wanted to extend suffrage to all white men, in place of the prevailing property ownership requirement. Madison made modest gains but was disappointed at the failure of Virginians to extend suffrage to all white men.[260] In his later years, Madison became highly concerned about his historical legacy. He resorted to modifying letters and other documents in his possession, changing days and dates, and adding and deleting words and sentences. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the early 1790s, Madison opposed the economic program and the accompanying centralization of power favored by Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton. Alongside Thomas Jefferson, he organized the Democratic\u2013Republican Party in opposition to Hamilton's Federalist Party. After Jefferson was elected president in 1800, Madison served as his Secretary of State from 1801 to 1809 and supported Jefferson in the case of *Marbury v. Madison*. While Madison was Secretary of State, Jefferson made the Louisiana Purchase, and later, as President, Madison oversaw related disputes in the Northwest Territories.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStagg writes that \"in some ways\u2014because he was on the winning side of every important issue facing the young nation from 1776 to 1816\u2014Madison was the most successful and possibly the most influential of all the Founding Fathers.\"[48] Though he helped found a major political party and served as the fourth president, his legacy has largely been defined by his contributions to the Constitution; even in his own life he was hailed as the \"Father of the Constitution\".[307] Law professor Noah Feldman writes that Madison \"invented and theorized the modern ideal of an expanded, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nJames Madison\n |\n| --- |\n| * 4th President of the United States (1809\u20131817)\n* 5th U.S. Secretary of State (1801\u20131809)\n* United States House of Representatives (1789\u20131797)\n* Congress of the Confederation (1781\u20131783)\n* Virginia House of Delegates (1776\u20131779, 1784\u20131786)\n* Delegate, Fifth Virginia Convention (1776)\n |\n| \"Father of the Constitution\" | * Co-wrote, 1776 Virginia Constitution\n* 1786 Annapolis Convention\n* 1787 Constitutional Convention\n\t+ Virginia Plan\n\t+ Constitution of the United States\n\t+ *Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787*\n* *The Federalist Papers*\n\t+ written by Madison\n\t+ No. 10\n\t+ No. 51\n* Virginia Ratifying Convention\n* United States Bill of Rights\n\t+ 27th amendment\n* Constitution drafting and ratification timeline\n* Tariff of 1789\n* Founding Fathers\n |\n| Presidency | * First inauguration\n* Second inauguration\n* Tecumseh's War\n\t+ Battle of Tippecanoe\n* War of 1812\n\t+ origins\n\t+ Henry letters\n\t+ Burning of Washington\n\t+ The Octagon House\n\t+ Treaty of Ghent\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFounding Father, 4th president of the United States\n\nFor other uses, see James Madison (disambiguation).\n\n\"President Madison\" redirects here.

He was born into a plantation society that relied on slave labor, and both sides of his family profited from tobacco farming.[279] While he viewed slavery as essential to the Southern economy, he was troubled by the instability of a society that depended on a large slave population.[280] Madison also believed slavery was incompatible with American Revolutionary principles, though he owned over one hundred African American slaves.[279]\n\n\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJames Madison Jr. was born on March 16, 1751 (March 5, 1750, Old Style), at Belle Grove Plantation near Port Conway in the Colony of Virginia, to James Madison Sr. and Eleanor Rose Conway Madison. His family had lived in Virginia since the mid-17th century.[7] Madison's maternal grandfather, Francis Conway, was a prominent planter and tobacco merchant.[8] His father was a tobacco planter who grew up on a plantation, then called Mount Pleasant, which he inherited upon reaching adulthood. With an estimated 100 slaves[7] and a 5,000-acre (2,000\u00a0ha) plantation, Madison's father was among the largest landowners in Virginia's Piedmont.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBut by the early 1800s, when in a position to truly impact policy, he failed to follow through on these views.\" Spies-Gans concluded, \"[u]ltimately, Madison's personal dependence on slavery led him to question his own, once enlightened, definition of liberty itself.\"[279]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Historical reputation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* James Madison Memorial Building\n\t+ statue\n* James Madison University\n* James Madison College\n* Madison, Wisconsin\n\t+ James Madison Park\n\t+ James Madison Memorial High School\n* Madison Square\n\t+ Madison Square Garden\n* Madison River\n* Mount Madison\n* Madison Street\n* U.S. postage stamps\n* James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation\n* James Madison Freedom of Information Award\n* James Madison Award\n* James Madison Institute\n* James Madison Museum\n* USRC *James Madison*\n* USS *Madison*\n* USS *James Madison*\n* *Magnificent Doll* (1946 film)\n* *A More Perfect Union* (1989 film)\n* *Liberty's Kids* (2002 series)\n* *Hamilton* (musical, film)\n* *Washington* (2020 miniseries)\n |\n| Related | * Age of Enlightenment\n* American Enlightenment\n* *Marbury v.

At the same time, Madison planned for Jefferson's campaign in the 1800 presidential election.[149] Madison issued the Report of 1800, which attacked the Alien and Sedition Acts as unconstitutional. That report held that Congress was limited to legislating on its enumerated powers and that punishment for sedition violated freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Jefferson embraced the report, and it became the unofficial Democratic\u2013Republican platform for the 1800 election.[150] With the Federalists divided between supporters of Hamilton and Adams, and with news of the end of the Quasi-War not reaching the United States until after the election, Jefferson and his running mate, Aaron Burr, defeated Adams, allowing Jefferson to prevail as president.[151][152]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of State (1801\u20131809)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Thomas Jefferson\n\nFurther information: Louisiana Purchase and Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bordewich, Fergus M.

Historians have generally ranked him as an above-average president.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJames Monroe was born April 28, 1758, in his parents' house in a wooded area of Westmoreland County, Virginia. The marked site is one mile (1.6\u00a0km) from the unincorporated community known today as Monroe Hall, Virginia. The James Monroe Family Home Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. His father Spence Monroe (1727\u20131774) was a moderately prosperous planter and slave owner who also practiced carpentry. His mother Elizabeth Jones (1730\u20131772) married Spence Monroe in 1752 and they had five children: Elizabeth, James, Spence, Andrew, and Joseph Jones.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMonroe thought that foreign and Federalist elements had created the Quasi War of 1798\u20131800, and he strongly supported Thomas Jefferson's candidacy for president in 1800. Federalists were likewise suspicious of Monroe, some viewing him at best as a French dupe and at worst a traitor.[49] With the power to appoint election officials in Virginia, Monroe exercised his influence to help Jefferson win Virginia's presidential electors.[50] He also considered using the Virginia militia to force the outcome in favor of Jefferson.[51] Jefferson won the 1800 election, and he appointed Madison as his Secretary of State. As a member of Jefferson's party and the leader of the largest state in the country, Monroe emerged as one of Jefferson's two most likely successors, alongside Madison.[52]\n\n\n\n### Louisiana Purchase and Minister to Great Britain[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn his return to Virginia in 1807, Monroe received a warm reception, and many urged him to run in the 1808 presidential election.[58] After Jefferson refused to submit the Monroe-Pinkney Treaty, Monroe had come to believe that Jefferson had snubbed the treaty out of the desire to avoid elevating Monroe above Madison in 1808.[59] Out of deference to Jefferson, Monroe agreed to avoid actively campaigning for the presidency, but he did not rule out accepting a draft effort.[60] The Democratic-Republican Party was increasingly factionalized, with \"Old Republicans\" or \"Quids\" denouncing the Jefferson administration for abandoning what they considered to be true republican principles. The Quids tried to enlist Monroe in their cause. The plan was to run Monroe for president in the 1808 election in cooperation with the Federalist Party, which had a strong base in New England. John Randolph of Roanoke led the Quid effort to stop Jefferson's choice of Madison. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Ammon, Harry (1971). *James Monroe: The Quest for National Identity*. McGraw-Hill.

Monroe stood firmly with Jefferson in opposing Hamilton's strong central government and strong executive. The Democratic-Republican Party coalesced around Jefferson and Madison, and Monroe became one of the fledgling party's leaders in the Senate. He also helped organize opposition to John Adams in the 1792\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\"When it comes to Monroe's thoughts on religion,\" historian Bliss Isely notes, \"less is known than that of any other President.\" No letters survive in which he discussed his religious beliefs. Nor did his friends, family or associates comment on his beliefs. Letters that do survive, such as ones written after the death of his son, contain no discussion of religion.[137]\n\n\nMonroe was raised in a family that belonged to the Church of England when it was the state church in Virginia before the Revolution. As an adult, he attended Episcopal churches. Some historians see \"deistic tendencies\" in his few references to an impersonal God.[138] Unlike Jefferson, Monroe was rarely attacked as an atheist or infidel. In 1832 James Renwick Willson, a Reformed Presbyterian minister in Albany, New York, criticized Monroe for having \"lived and died like a second-rate Athenian philosopher\".[139]\n\n\n\n## Slavery[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWashington decided Monroe was inefficient, disruptive, and failed to safeguard the national interest. He recalled Monroe in November 1796.[36] Returning to his home in Charlottesville, he resumed his dual careers as a farmer and lawyer.[37] Jefferson and Madison urged Monroe to run for Congress, but Monroe chose to focus on state politics instead.[38] John Skey Eustace was the author of several pamphlets,[39] some designed to embarrass James Monroe:[40][41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMonroe served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He studied law under Thomas Jefferson from 1780 to 1783 and served as a delegate in the Continental Congress as well as a delegate to the Virginia Ratifying Convention. He opposed the ratification of the United States Constitution. In 1790, he won election to the Senate where he became a leader of the Democratic-Republican Party. He left the Senate in 1794 to serve as President George Washington's ambassador to France but was recalled by Washington in 1796. Monroe won the election as Governor of Virginia in 1799 and strongly supported Jefferson's candidacy in the 1800 presidential election.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring Monroe's tenure as president, the Federalist Party collapsed as a national political force and Monroe was re-elected, virtually unopposed, in 1820. As president, Monroe signed the Missouri Compromise, which admitted Missouri as a slave state and banned slavery from territories north of the 36\u00b030\u2032 parallel. In foreign affairs, Monroe and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams favored a policy of conciliation with Britain and a policy of expansionism against the Spanish Empire. In the 1819 Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty with Spain, the United States secured Florida and established its western border with New Spain. In 1823, Monroe announced the United States' opposition to any European intervention in the recently independent countries of the Americas with the Monroe Doctrine, which became a landmark in American foreign policy. Monroe was a member of the American Colonization Society which supported the colonization of Africa by freed slaves, and Liberia's capital of Monrovia is named in his honor.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hammond, John Craig (2019). \"President, Planter, Politician: James Monroe, the Missouri Crisis, and the Politics of Slavery\" (PDF). *Journal of American History*. **105** (3): 843\u201367. doi:10.1093/jahist/jaz002.

In 1787, Monroe won election to another term in the Virginia House of Delegates. Though he had become outspoken in his desire to reform the Articles, he was unable to attend the Philadelphia Convention due to his work obligations.[27] In 1788, Monroe became a delegate to the Virginia Ratifying Convention.[28] In Virginia, the struggle over the ratification of the proposed Constitution involved more than a simple clash between federalists and anti-federalists. Virginians held a full spectrum of opinions about the merits of the proposed change in national government. Washington and Madison were leading supporters; Patrick Henry and George Mason were leading opponents. Those who held the middle ground in the ideological struggle became the central figures. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMonroe returned to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was elected to another term as governor in 1811, but served only four months. In April 1811, Madison appointed Monroe to his cabinet as Secretary of State in hopes of shoring up the support of the more radical factions of the Democratic-Republicans.[57] Madison also hoped that Monroe, an experienced diplomat with whom he had once been close friends, would improve upon the performance of the previous Secretary of State, Robert Smith. Madison assured Monroe that their differences regarding the Monroe-Pinkney Treaty had been a misunderstanding, and the two resumed their friendship.[65] The Senate voted unanimously (30\u20130) to confirm him. On taking office, Monroe hoped to negotiate treaties with the British and French to end the attacks on American merchant ships. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Statue of Monroe at Highland, his house near Charlottesville, Virginia\n### Historical reputation[edit]\n\n\nPolls of historians and political scientists tend to rank Monroe as an above average president.[148][149] Monroe presided over a period in which the United States began to turn away from European affairs and towards domestic issues. His presidency saw the United States settle many of its longstanding boundary issues through an accommodation with Britain and the acquisition of Florida. Monroe also helped resolve sectional tensions through his support of the Missouri Compromise and by seeking support from all regions of the country.[150] Political scientist Fred Greenstein argues that Monroe was a more effective executive than some of his better-known predecessors, including Madison and John Adams.[151]\n\n\n\n### Memorials[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of memorials to James Monroe\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs President Jefferson's special envoy, Monroe helped negotiate the Louisiana Purchase, through which the United States nearly doubled in size. Monroe fell out with his longtime friend James Madison after Madison rejected the Monroe\u2013Pinkney Treaty that Monroe negotiated with Britain. He unsuccessfully challenged Madison for the Democratic-Republican nomination in the 1808 presidential election, but he joined Madison's administration as Secretary of State in 1811. During the later stages of the War of 1812, Monroe simultaneously served as Madison's Secretary of State and Secretary of War. Monroe's wartime leadership established him as Madison's heir apparent, and he easily defeated Federalist candidate Rufus King in the 1816 presidential election.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\npresident who was a Revolutionary War veteran, since he served as an officer of the Continental Army and took part in combat.[9] As a result of his service, Monroe became a member of the Society of the Cincinnati.[10][11]\n\n\nMonroe resumed studying law under Jefferson and continued until 1783.[12][13] He was not particularly interested in legal theory or practice, but chose to take it up because he thought it offered \"the most immediate rewards\" and could ease his path to wealth, social standing, and political influence.[13] Monroe was admitted to the Virginia bar and practiced in Fredericksburg, Virginia.\n\n\n\n## Marriage and family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Elizabeth Kortright\nOn February 16, 1786, Monroe married Elizabeth Kortright (1768\u20131830) in New York City.[14] She was the daughter of Hannah Aspinwall Kortright and Laurence Kortright, a wealthy trader and former British officer. Monroe met her while serving in the Continental Congress.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMonroe largely ignored old party lines in making federal appointments, which reduced political tensions and augmented the sense of \"oneness\" that pervaded the United States. He made two long national tours to build national trust. At Boston, a newspaper hailed his 1817 visit as the beginning of an \"Era of Good Feelings\". Frequent stops on his tours included ceremonies of welcome and expressions of good-will. The Federalist Party continued to fade during his administration; it maintained its vitality and organizational integrity in Delaware and a few localities, but lacked influence in national politics. Lacking serious opposition, the Democratic-Republican Party's Congressional caucus stopped meeting, and for practical purposes the party stopped operating.[79]\n\n\n\n#### Administration and cabinet[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nJames Monroe\n |\n| --- |\n| * 5th President of the United States (1817\u20131825)\n* 5th United States Secretary of State (1811\u20131817)\n* United States Secretary of War (1814\u20131815)\n* 12th and 16th Governor of Virginia (1799\u20131802, 1811)\n* U.S. Minister to the United Kingdom (1803\u20131808)\n* U.S. Minister to France (1794\u20131796)\n* U.S. Senator from Virginia (1790\u20131794)\n* Delegate to the Congress of the Confederation (1783\u20131786)\n |\n| Founding events | * Virginia Ratifying Convention\n* Founding Fathers\n | ![](image)![](image)\n |\n| Presidency | * First inauguration\n* Second inauguration\n* Florida Treaty\n* Treaty of 1818\n* Panic of 1819\n* Era of Good Feelings\n* Missouri Compromise\n* Seminole Wars\n* Monroe Doctrine\n* Tariff of 1824\n* State of the Union Address, 1824\n* Cabinet\n* Federal judiciary appointments\n |\n| Other notedaccomplisments | * Negotiated the Louisiana Purchase\n* Monroe\u2013Pinkney Treaty\n* War of 1812\n |\n| Life | * Early life and career\n* Birthplace and boyhood home\n* Revolutionary War service\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** Cunningham 1996, pp.\u00a03\u20135.\n33. **^** Unger 2009, pp.\u00a094\u2013104\n34. **^** Unger 2009, pp.\u00a0111\u2013115\n35. **^** Hart 2005, pp.\u00a029\u201334.\n36. **^** Herbert E.

Monroe won 3,400 votes in Virginia, but received little support elsewhere.[60] After the election Monroe quickly reconciled with Jefferson, but their friendship endured further strains when Jefferson did not promote Monroe's candidacy to Congress in 1809.[63] Monroe did not speak with Madison until 1810.[57] Returning to private life, he devoted his attentions to farming at his Charlottesville estate.[64]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of State and Secretary of War (1811\u20131817)[edit]\n\n\n### Madison administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Presidency of James Madison\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Monroe's grave at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia\nUpon Elizabeth's death in 1830, Monroe moved to 63 Prince Street at Lafayette Place[134] in New York City to live with his daughter Maria Hester Monroe Gouverneur, who had married Samuel L. Gouverneur. Monroe's health began to slowly fail by the end of the 1820s.[135] On July 4, 1831, Monroe died at age 73 from heart failure and tuberculosis, thus becoming the third president to have died on Independence Day. His death came 55 years after the United States Declaration of Independence was proclaimed and five years after the deaths of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. Monroe was originally buried in New York at the Gouverneur family's vault in the New York City Marble Cemetery. 27 years later, in 1858, his body was re-interred at the President's Circle in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia. The James Monroe Tomb is a U.S. National Historic Landmark.[136]\n\n\n\n## Religious beliefs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHenry and other anti-federalists hoped to elect a Congress that would amend the Constitution to take away most of the powers it had been granted (\"commit suicide on [its] own authority\", as Madison put it). Henry recruited Monroe to run against Madison for a House seat in the First Congress, and he had the Virginia legislature draw a congressional district designed to elect Monroe. During the campaign, Madison and Monroe often traveled together, and the election did not destroy their friendship. In the election for Virginia's Fifth District, Madison prevailed over Monroe, taking 1,308 votes compared to Monroe's 972 votes. Following his defeat, Monroe returned to his legal duties and developed his farm in Charlottesville. After the death of Senator William Grayson in 1790, Virginia legislators elected Monroe to serve the remainder of Grayson's term.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nelection, though Adams defeated George Clinton to win re-election as vice president.[32] As the 1790s progressed, the French Revolutionary Wars came to dominate U.S. foreign policy, with British and French raids both threatening U.S. trade with Europe. Like most other Jeffersonians, Monroe supported the French Revolution, but Hamilton's followers tended to sympathize more with Britain. In 1794, hoping to find a way to avoid war with both countries, Washington appointed Monroe as his minister (ambassador) to France. At the same time, he appointed the anglophile Federalist John Jay as his minister to Britain.[33]\n\n\n\n### Minister to France[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Marker designating the site of James Monroe's birthplace in Monroe Hall, Virginia\nHis paternal great-great-grandfather Patrick Andrew Monroe emigrated to America from Scotland in the mid-17th century, and was part of an ancient Scottish clan known as Clan Munro. In 1650 he patented a large tract of land in Washington Parish, Westmoreland County, Virginia. Monroe's mother was the daughter of James Jones, who immigrated from Wales and settled in nearby King George County, Virginia. Jones was a wealthy architect.[1] Also among James Monroe's ancestors were French Huguenot immigrants, who came to Virginia in 1700.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The earliest preserved portrait of James Monroe as Minister Plenipotentiary to France in 1794\nAfter arriving in France, Monroe addressed the National Convention, receiving a standing ovation for his speech celebrating republicanism. He experienced several early diplomatic successes, including the protection of U.S. trade from French attacks. He also used his influence to win the release of Thomas Paine and Adrienne de La Fayette, the wife of the Marquis de Lafayette.[34] Months after Monroe arrived in France, the U.S. and Great Britain concluded the Jay Treaty, outraging both the French and Monroe\u2014not fully informed about the treaty prior to its publication. Despite the undesirable effects of the Jay Treaty on Franco-American relations, Monroe won French support for U.S. navigational rights on the Mississippi River\u2014the mouth of which was controlled by Spain\u2014and in 1795 the U.S. and Spain signed Pinckney's Treaty. The treaty granted the U.S. limited rights to use the port of New Orleans.[35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMonroe was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1782. After serving on Virginia's Executive Council,[23] he was elected to the Congress of the Confederation in November 1783 and served in Annapolis until Congress convened in Trenton, New Jersey in June 1784. He had served a total of three years when he finally retired from that office by the rule of rotation.[24] By that time, the government was meeting in the temporary capital of New York City. In 1784, Monroe undertook an extensive trip through Western New York and Pennsylvania to inspect the conditions in the Northwest. The tour convinced him that the United States had to pressure Britain to abandon its posts in the region and assert control of the Northwest.[25] While serving in Congress, Monroe became an advocate for western expansion, and played a key role in the writing and passage of the Northwest Ordinance. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Election of 1820[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1820 United States presidential election\n\nThe collapse of the Federalists left Monroe with no organized opposition at the end of his first term, and he ran for reelection unopposed,[123] the only president other than Washington to do so. A single elector from New Hampshire, William Plumer, cast a vote for John Quincy Adams, preventing a unanimous vote in the Electoral College.[123] He did so because he thought Monroe was incompetent. Later in the century, the story arose that he had cast his dissenting vote so that only George Washington would have the honor of unanimous election. Plumer never mentioned Washington in his speech explaining his vote to the other New Hampshire electors.[124]\n\n\n\n### States admitted to the Union[edit]\n\n\nFive new states were admitted to the Union while Monroe was in office:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n(\u2190 1816) 1820 United States presidential election (1824 \u2192)\n |\n| --- |\n| **Democratic-Republican Party** | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Nominees | * **President: James Monroe** (incumbent)\n* **Vice President: Daniel D.

They cannot lose sight of the rights of the two parties, & the object of the unsuccessful one.\" Only seven of the executions carried out against the rebels occurred after Monroe received Jefferson's letter.[146]\n\n\nMonroe was active in the American Colonization Society, which supported the establishment of colonies outside of the United States for free African Americans. The society helped send several thousand freed slaves to the new colony of Liberia in Africa from 1820 to 1840. Slave owners like Monroe and Andrew Jackson wanted to prevent free blacks from encouraging slaves in the South to rebel. Liberia's capital, Monrovia, was named after President Monroe.[147]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Before being elected to the presidency, he gained fame as a general in the U.S. Army and served in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Although often praised as an advocate for ordinary Americans and for his work in preserving the union of states, Jackson has also been criticized for his racial policies, particularly his treatment of Native Americans.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn his retirement, Jackson stayed active in politics. He supported the presidencies of Martin Van Buren and James K. Polk, as well as the annexation of Texas, which was accomplished shortly before his death. Jackson's legacy remains controversial, and opinions on him are frequently polarized. Supporters characterize him as a defender of democracy and the Constitution, while critics point to his reputation as a demagogue who ignored the law when it suited him. Scholars and historians have consistently ranked Jackson's presidency as significantly above-average, although his reputation among experts has declined since the late 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJackson was self-confident,[371] without projecting a sense of self-importance.[372] This self-confidence gave him the ability to persevere in the face of adversity.[373] Once he decided on a plan of action, he would adhere to it.[374] His reputation for being both quick-tempered and confident worked to his advantage;[375] it misled opponents to see him as simple and direct, leading them to often understimate his political shrewdness.[376]\n\n\n\n### Religious faith[edit]\n\n\nIn 1838, Jackson became an official member of the First Presbyterian Church in Nashville.[377] Both his mother and his wife had been devout Presbyterians all their lives, but Jackson stated that he had postponed officially entering the church until after his retirement to avoid accusations that he had done so for political reasons.[378]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of memorials to Andrew Jackson\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAndrew Jackson\n |\n| --- |\n| * 7th President of the United States (1829\u20131837)\n* Senator from Tennessee (1797\u20131798, 1823\u20131825)\n* Federal Military Commissioner of Florida (1821)\n* U.S. Representative for Tennessee at-large (1796\u20131797)\n |\n| Life | * Battle of Hanging Rock\n* The Hermitage\n* Creek War\n* Fort Strother\n* Battle of Talladega\n* Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek\n* Battle of Horseshoe Bend\n* Treaty of Fort Jackson\n* Battle of Pensacola (1814)\n* Battle of New Orleans\n* Seminole Wars\n* 1824 United States presidential election\n* United States Senate Committee on Armed Services\n* Corrupt bargain\n* 1828 United States presidential election\n* Andrew Jackson 1828 presidential campaign\n* Coffin Handbills\n* Jacksonian democracy\n | ![](image)![](image)\n |\n| Presidency | * First inauguration of Andrew Jackson\n* Tenure of Office Act (1820)\n* Spoils system\n* Petticoat affair\n* Kitchen Cabinet\n* Indian removal\n* Indian Removal Act\n* Trail of Tears\n* Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek\n* Bank War\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Refer to caption](image)1828 election results\nJackson was nominated for president by the Tennessee legislature in October 1825, more than three years before the 1828 election.[170] He gained powerful supporters in both the South and North, including Calhoun, who became Jackson's vice presidential running mate, and New York Senator Martin Van Buren.[171] Meanwhile, Adams's support from the Southern states was eroded when he signed a tax on European imports, the Tariff of 1828, which was called the \"Tariff of Abominations\" by opponents, into law.[169] Jackson's victory in the presidential race was overwhelming. He won 56 percent of the popular vote and 68 percent of the electoral vote. The election ended the one-party system that had formed during the Era of Good Feelings as Jackson's supporters coalesced into the Democratic Party and the various groups who did not support him eventually formed the Whig Party.[172]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1822, Jackson agreed to run in the 1824 presidential election, and he was nominated by the Tennessee legislature in July.[148] At the time, the Federalist Party had collapsed, and there were four major contenders for the Democratic-Republican Party nomination: William Crawford, John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun. Jackson was intended to be a stalking horse candidate to prevent Tennessee's electoral votes from going to Crawford, who was seen as a Washington insider. Unexpectedly, Jackson garnered popular support outside of Tennessee and became a serious candidate.[143] He benefited from the expansion of suffrage among white males that followed the conclusion of the War of 1812.[149][150] He was a popular war hero whose reputation suggested he had the decisiveness and independence to bring reform to Washington.[151] He also was promoted as an outsider who stood for all the people, blaming banks for the country's depression.[152]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJackson had a reputation for being short-tempered and violent,[364] which terrified his opponents.[365] He was able to use his temper strategically to accomplish what he wanted.[366] He could keep it in check when necessary: his behavior was friendly and urbane when he went to Washington as senator during the campaign leading up to the 1824 election. According to Van Buren, he remained calm in times of difficulty and made his decisions deliberatively.[367]\n\n\nHe had the tendency to take things personally. If someone crossed him, he would often become obsessed with crushing them.[368] For example, on the last day of his presidency, Jackson declared he had only two regrets: that he had not hanged Henry Clay or shot John C. Calhoun.[369] He also had a strong sense of loyalty. He considered threats to his friends as threats to himself, but he demanded unquestioning loyalty in return.[370]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJackson ran again in 1828, defeating Adams in a landslide. In 1830, he signed the Indian Removal Act. This act, which has been described as ethnic cleansing, displaced tens of thousands of Native Americans from their ancestral homelands east of the Mississippi and resulted in thousands of deaths. Under Jackson, the integrity of the federal union was challenged when South Carolina threatened to nullify a high protective tariff set by the federal government. He threatened the use of military force to enforce the tariff, but the crisis was defused when it was amended. In 1832, he vetoed a bill by Congress to reauthorize the Second Bank of the United States, arguing that it was a corrupt institution that benefited the wealthy. After a lengthy struggle, he and his allies dismantled the Bank. In 1835, Jackson became the only president to pay off the national debt. He also survived the first assassination attempt on a sitting president. In one of his final presidential acts, he recognized the Republic of Texas.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJackson became a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, the dominant party in Tennessee.[31] He was elected as a delegate to the Tennessee constitutional convention in 1796.[43] When Tennessee achieved statehood that year, he was elected to be its U.S. representative. In Congress, Jackson argued against the Jay Treaty, criticized George Washington for allegedly removing Democratic-Republicans from public office, and joined several other Democratic-Republican congressmen in voting against a resolution of thanks for Washington.[44] He advocated for the right of Tennesseans to militarily oppose Native American interests.[45] The state legislature elected him to be a U.S. senator in 1797, but he resigned after serving only six months.[46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring his presidential candidacy, Jackson reluctantly ran for one of Tennessee's U.S. Senate seats. Jackson's political managers William Berkeley Lewis and John Eaton convinced him that he needed to defeat incumbent John Williams, who opposed him. The legislature elected Jackson in October 1823.[153][154] He was attentive to his senatorial duties. He was appointed chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs, but avoided debate or initiating legislation.[155] He used his time in the Senate to form alliances and make peace with old adversaries.[156] Eaton continued to campaign for Jackson's presidency, updating his biography and writing a series of widely circulated pseudonymous letters that portrayed Jackson as a champion of republican liberty.[157]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Andrew Jackson\n |\n| --- |\n| ![A portrait of Andrew Jackson, serious in posture and expression, with a grey-and-white haired widow's peak, wearing a red-collared black cape.](image)Portrait, c.\u20091835\n |\n|  |\n| 7th President of the United States |\n| **In office**March 4, 1829\u00a0\u2013 March 4, 1837 |\n| Vice President | * John C.

They claimed to oppose Jackson's expansion of executive power, calling him \"King Andrew the First\", and naming their party after the English Whigs who opposed the British monarchy in the 17th century.[290] In March 1834, the Senate censured Jackson for inappropriately taking authority for the Treasury Department when it was the responsibility of Congress and refused to confirm Taney's appointment as secretary of the treasury.[291] In April, however, the House declared that the bank should not be rechartered. By July 1836, the Bank no longer held any federal deposits.[292]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJackson is usually rated highly as a president, but his reputation is dropping.[*when?*][410] His contradictory legacy is shown in opinion polls. A 2014 survey of political scientists rated Jackson as the ninth-highest rated president but the third-most polarizing. He was also ranked the third-most overrated president.[411] In a C-SPAN poll, Jackson was ranked the 13th in 2009, 18th in 2017, and 22nd in 2021.[412]\n\n\n\n## Writings[edit]\n\n\n* Feller, Daniel; Coens, Thomas; Moss, Laura-Eve; Moser, Harold D.; Alexander, Erik B.; Smith, Sam B.; Owsley, Harriet C.; Hoth, David R; Hoemann, George H.; McPherson, Sharon; Clift, J.

His parents were Scots-Irish colonists Andrew Jackson and Elizabeth Hutchinson, Presbyterians who had emigrated from Ulster, Ireland, in 1765.[1][2] Jackson's father was born in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, around 1738,[3] and his ancestors had crossed into Northern Ireland from Scotland after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.[4] Jackson had two older brothers who came with his parents from Ireland, Hugh (born 1763) and Robert (born 1764).[5][4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nClay's strategy failed. Jackson was able to mobilize the Democratic Party's strong political networks.[280] The Northeast supported Jackson because he was in favor of maintaining a stiff tariff; the West supported him because the Indian Removal Act reduced the number of Native Americans in the region and made available more public land.[281] Except for South Carolina, which passed the Ordinance of Nullification during the election month and refused to support any party by giving its votes to the future Governor of Virginia John B. Floyd,[282] the South supported Jackson for implementing the Indian Removal Act, as well as for his willingness to compromise by signing the Tariff of 1832.[283] Jackson won the election by a landslide, receiving 55 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes.[280]\n\n\n\n#### Removal of deposits and censure[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Censure of Andrew Jackson\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![A map of the 1832 presidential election. Blue states were won by Jackson.](image)1832 election results\nThe 1832 presidential election demonstrated the rapid development of political parties during Jackson's presidency. The Democratic Party's first national convention, held in Baltimore, nominated Jackson's choice for vice president, Martin Van Buren. The National Republican Party, which had held its first convention in Baltimore earlier in December 1831, nominated Clay, now a senator from Kentucky, and John Sergeant of Pennsylvania.[275] An Anti-Masonic Party, with a platform built around opposition to Freemasonry,[276] supported neither Jackson nor Clay, who both were Masons. The party nominated William Wirt of Maryland and Amos Ellmaker of Pennsylvania.[277]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJackson's exact birthplace is unclear. Jackson's father died at the age of 29 in a logging accident while clearing land in February 1767, three weeks before his son Andrew was born.[5] Afterwards, Elizabeth and her three sons moved in with her sister and brother-in-law, Jane and James Crawford.[6] Jackson later stated that he was born on the Crawford plantation,[7] which is in Lancaster County, South Carolina, but second-hand evidence suggests that he might have been born at another uncle's home in North Carolina.[6]\n\n\nWhen Jackson was young, Elizabeth thought he might become a minister and paid to have him schooled by a local clergyman.[8] He learned to read, write, work with numbers, and was exposed to Greek and Latin,[9] but he was too strong-willed and hot-tempered for the ministry.[6]\n\n\n\n## Revolutionary War[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Borneman, Walter R.

He became a frontier lawyer and married Rachel Donelson Robards. He briefly served in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, representing Tennessee. After resigning, he served as a justice on the Tennessee Supreme Court from 1798 until 1804. Jackson purchased a property later known as the Hermitage, becoming a wealthy planter who owned hundreds of African American slaves during his lifetime. In 1801, he was appointed colonel of the Tennessee militia and was elected its commander the following year. He led troops during the Creek War of 1813\u20131814, winning the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. The subsequent Treaty of Fort Jackson required the indigenous Creek population to surrender vast tracts of present-day Alabama and Georgia. In the concurrent war against the British, Jackson's victory at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815 made him a national hero. He later commanded U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Rottinghaus, Brandon; Vaughn, Justin S.

The vote was tied between Jackson and John Sevier, a popular Revolutionary War veteran and former governor, but the governor, Archibald Roane, broke the tie in Jackson's favor. Jackson later accused Sevier of fraud and bribery.[49] Sevier responded by impugning Rachel's honor, resulting in a shootout on a public street.[50] Soon afterwards, they met to duel, but parted without having fired at each other.[51]\n\n\n\n### Planting career and slavery[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Binns, John (1828). \"Some account of some of the bloody deeds of General Jackson\".

Ingham as Secretary of Treasury, John Branch as Secretary of Navy, John M. Berrien as Attorney General, and William T. Barry as Postmaster General.[188] Jackson was inaugurated on March 4, 1829; Adams, who was embittered by his defeat, refused to attend.[189] Jackson become the first president-elect to take the oath of office on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol.[190] In his inaugural address, he promised to protect the sovereignty of the states, respect the limits of the presidency, reform the government by removing disloyal or incompetent appointees, and observe a fair policy toward Native Americans.[191] Jackson invited the public to the White House, which was promptly overrun by well-wishers who caused minor damage to its furnishings. The spectacle earned him the nickname \"King Mob\".[192]\n\n\n\n### Reforms and rotation in office[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1920s, Jackson's rise to power became associated with the idea of the \"common man\".[390] This idea defined the age as a populist rejection of social elites and a vindication of every person's value independent of class and status.[391] Jackson was seen as its personification,[392] an individual free of societal constraints who can achieve great things.[393] In 1945, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.'s influential *Age of Jackson* redefined Jackson's legacy through the lens of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal,[394] describing the common man as a member of the working class struggling against exploitation by business concerns.[395]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe political campaign was dominated by the personal abuse that partisans flung at both candidates.[173] Jackson was accused of being the son of an English prostitute and a mulatto,[174][175] and he was labeled a slave trader who trafficked in human flesh.[176] A series of pamphlets known as the Coffin Handbills[177] accused him of having murdered 18 white men, including the soldiers he had executed for desertion and alleging that he stabbed a man in the back with his cane.[178][179] They stated that he had intentionally massacred Native American women and children at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, ate the bodies of Native Americans he killed in battle,[180][181] and threatened to cut off the ears of congressmen who questioned his behavior during the First Seminole War.[182]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJackson and Rachel were accused of adultery for living together before her divorce was finalized,[183] and Rachel heard about the accusation.[184] She had been under stress throughout the election, and just as Jackson was preparing to head to Washington for his inauguration, she fell ill.[185] She did not live to see her husband become president, dying of a stroke or heart attack a few days later.[184] Jackson believed that the abuse from Adams' supporters had hastened her death, stating at her funeral: \"May God Almighty forgive her murderers, as I know she forgave them. I never can.\"[186]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1829\u20131837)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Andrew Jackson\n\n![Man stands in white shirt and black pants and coat with right hand on desk and left hand at his side.](image)Engraving of President Jackson by A.

While traveling to assume his new position, Jackson stopped in Jonesborough. While there, he bought his first slave, a woman who was around his age.[28] He also fought his first duel, accusing another lawyer, Waightstill Avery, of impugning his character. The duel ended with both men firing in the air.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Jackson, Carlton (1966). \"The internal improvement vetoes of Andrew Jackson\". *Tennessee Historical Quarterly*. **25** (3): 531\u2013550. doi:10.2307/3115344.

Randolph struck Jackson in the face with his hand because Jackson had ordered Randolph's dismissal from the navy for embezzlement. Jackson declined to press charges.[311] While leaving the United States Capitol on January 30, 1835, Richard Lawrence, an unemployed house painter from England, aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired. Lawrence pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired. Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane until others intervened to restrain Lawrence, who was later found not guilty by reason of insanity and institutionalized.[312][313]\n\n\n\n### Slavery[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In a few months, Grant paid off his debts.[100] The family attended the local Methodist church and he soon established himself as a reputable citizen of Galena.[101] For the 1860 election, he could not vote because he was not yet a legal resident of Illinois, but he favored Democrat Stephen A. Douglas over the eventual winner, Abraham Lincoln, and Lincoln over the Southern Democrat, John C. Breckinridge.[102] He was torn between his increasingly anti-slavery views and the fact that his wife remained a staunch Democrat.[103]\n\n\n\n## Civil War[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ulysses S. Grant and the American Civil War\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs president, Grant stabilized the post-war national economy, supported congressional Reconstruction and the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, and prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan. Under Grant, the Union was completely restored. He appointed African Americans and Jewish Americans to prominent federal offices. In 1871, he created the first Civil Service Commission, advancing the civil service more than any prior president. The Liberal Republicans and Democrats united behind Grant's opponent in the 1872 presidential election, but Grant was handily reelected. His response to the Panic of 1873 was ineffective in halting the Long Depression, which contributed to the Democrats winning the House majority in 1874. Grant's Native American policy was to assimilate Indians into Anglo-American culture. His foreign policy was mostly peaceful: the *Alabama* Claims against Great Britain were skillfully resolved without war, but the Senate rejected his attempted annexation of Santo Domingo. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGrant won the popular vote by 300,000 votes out of 5,716,082 votes cast, receiving an Electoral College landslide of 214 votes to Seymour's 80.[286] Seymour received a majority of white voters, but Grant was aided by 500,000 votes cast by black people,[287] winning him 52.7 percent of the popular vote.[288] He lost Louisiana and Georgia, primarily due to Ku Klux Klan violence against African-American voters.[289] At the age of 46, Grant was the youngest president yet elected, and the first president after the nation had outlawed slavery.[290]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1869\u20131877)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Ulysses S.

He had thirty-five notable recommendations, but the position was given on the basis of political affiliation and Grant was passed over by the Free Soil and Republican county commissioners because he was believed to share his father-in-law's Democratic sentiments.[98] In the 1856 presidential election, Grant cast his first presidential vote for Democrat James Buchanan, later saying he was really voting against Republican John C. Fr\u00e9mont over concern that his anti-slavery position would lead to southern secession and war and because he considered Fr\u00e9mont to be a shameless self-promoter.[99]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUlysses S.

Sarna said: \"Gen. Ulysses S. Grant issued the most notorious anti-Jewish official order in American history.\"[173] Grant made amends with the Jewish community during his presidency, appointing them to various federal positions.[174] In 2017, biographer Ron Chernow said of Grant: \"As we shall see, Grant as president atoned for his action in a multitude of meaningful ways. He was never a bigoted, hate-filled man and was haunted by his terrible action for the rest of his days.\"[175]\n10. **^** Southern Reconstructed states were controlled locally by Republican carpetbaggers, scalawags and former slaves. By 1877, the conservative Democrats had full control of the region and Reconstruction was dead.[316]\n11. **^** To placate the South in 1870, Grant signed the Amnesty Act, which restored political rights to former Confederates.[325]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn his youth, Grant developed an unusual ability to ride and manage horses.[15] Grant disliked the tannery, so his father put his ability with horses to use by giving him work driving wagon loads of supplies and transporting people.[16] Unlike his siblings, Grant was not forced to attend church by his Methodist parents.[c][18] For the rest of his life, he prayed privately and never officially joined any denomination.[19] To others, including his own son, Grant appeared to be an agnostic.[20] He inherited some of Hannah's Methodist piety and quiet nature.[21] Grant was largely apolitical before the war but wrote, \"If I had ever had any political sympathies they would have been with the Whigs. I was raised in that school.\"[22]\n\n\n\n## Early military career and personal life[edit]\n\n\n### West Point and first assignment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGrant won reelection easily thanks to federal prosecution of the Klan, a strong economy, debt reduction, lowered tariffs, and tax reductions.[441] He received 56% of the vote to Greeley's 44% and an Electoral College landslide of 286 to 66.[r][443][444] A majority of African Americans in the South voted for Grant, while Democratic opposition remained mostly peaceful.[445] Grant lost in six former slave states that wanted to see an end to Reconstruction.[446] He proclaimed the victory as a personal vindication of his presidency, but inwardly he felt betrayed by the Liberals.[447]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGrant told Congress to settle the matter through legislation and assured both sides that he would not use the army to force a result, except to curb violence. On January 29, 1877, he signed legislation forming an Electoral Commission to decide the matter.[512] Hayes was ruled elected president by the commission; to forestall Democratic protests, Republicans agreed to the Compromise of 1877, in which the last troops were withdrawn from Southern capitals. With Reconstruction dead, an 80-year era of Jim Crow segregation was launched.[513] Grant's \"calm visage\" throughout the election crisis appeased the nation.[514]\n\n\nTo the chagrin of Grant, President Hayes appointed Reconstruction critics, including Liberal Republican icon Carl Schurz to Secretary of Interior.[515]\n\n\n\n## Post-presidency (1877\u20131885)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Post-presidency of Ulysses S.

As commanding general, he led the Union Army to victory in the American Civil War in 1865 and thereafter briefly served as U.S. secretary of war. Later, as president, Grant was an effective civil rights executive who signed the bill that created the Justice Department and worked with Radical Republicans to protect African Americans during Reconstruction.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Additionally, Grant's Postmaster General, John Creswell used his patronage powers to integrate the postal system and appointed a record number of African-American men and women as postal workers across the nation, while also expanding many of the mail routes.[327][328] Grant appointed Republican abolitionist and champion of black education Hugh Lennox Bond as U.S. Circuit Court judge.[329]\n13. **^** An 1870 Congressional investigation chaired by James A. Garfield cleared Grant of profiteering, but excoriated Gould and Fisk for their manipulation of the gold market and Corbin for exploiting his personal connection to Grant.[358]\n14. **^** Urged by his Secretary of War Rawlins, Grant initially supported recognition of Cuban belligerency, but Rawlins's death on September 6, 1869, removed any cabinet support for military intervention.[344]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Post-presidency | * Bid for a third term\n* World tour\n |\n| Books | * *Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.

Grant's Republican successor, President Rutherford B. Hayes, was conciliatory toward the South and favored \"local control\" of civil rights on the condition that Democrats make an honorary pledge to confirm the constitutional amendments that protected black people.[341] During Republican negotiations with Democrats, that Grant took no direct part in, the Republicans received the White House for Hayes in return for ending enforcement of racial equality for black people and removing federal troops from the last three states.[342] As promised, Hayes withdrew federal troops from South Carolina and Louisiana, which marked the end of Reconstruction.[343]\n\n\n\n### Financial affairs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGrant graduated on June 30, 1843, ranked 21st out of 39 in his class and was promoted the next day to the rank brevet second lieutenant.[35] He planned to resign his commission after his four-year term of duty. He would later write that among the happiest days of his life were the day he left the presidency and the day he left the academy.[36] Despite his excellent horsemanship, he was not assigned to the cavalry, but to the 4th Infantry Regiment.[e] Grant's first assignment took him to the Jefferson Barracks near St. Louis, Missouri. Lt. Col. Robert C. Buchanan fined Grant wine bottles for Grant's late returns from White Haven.[38] Commanded by Colonel Stephen W. Kearny, the barracks was the nation's largest military base in the West.[39] Grant was happy with his new commander but looked forward to the end of his military service and a possible teaching career.[40]\n\n\n\n### Marriage and family[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Badeau, Adam (1887). *Grant in Peace: From Appomattox to Mount McGregor*.

Chase. In his inaugural address, Grant urged the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, while large numbers of African Americans attended his inauguration.[291] He also urged that bonds issued during the Civil War should be paid in gold, called for \"proper treatment\" of Native Americans and encouraged their \"civilization and ultimate citizenship\".[292]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Grant\u2013Colfax Republican ticket\nWhen the Republican Party met at the 1868 Republican National Convention in Chicago, the delegates unanimously nominated Grant for president and Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax for vice president.[277] Although Grant had preferred to remain in the army, he accepted the Republican nomination, believing that he was the only one who could unify the nation.[278] The Republicans advocated \"equal civil and political rights to all\" and African American enfranchisement.[279] The Democrats, having abandoned Johnson, nominated former governor Horatio Seymour of New York for president and Francis P. Blair of Missouri for vice president. The Democrats opposed suffrage for African Americans and advocated the immediate restoration of former Confederate states to the Union and amnesty from \"all past political offenses\".[280][281]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1872, the Liberals nominated Horace Greeley, a leading Republican *New York Tribune* editor and a fierce enemy of Grant, for president, and Missouri governor B. Gratz Brown, for vice president.[430] The Liberals denounced Grantism, corruption, nepotism, and inefficiency, demanded the withdrawal of federal troops from the South, literacy tests for black people to vote, and amnesty for Confederates.[431] The Democrats adopted the Greeley-Brown ticket and the Liberals party platform.[432] Greeley, whose Tribune gave him wider name recognition and a louder campaign voice, pushed the themes that the Grant administration was failed and corrupt.[433]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Engraving of a young Grant in uniform](image)Grant as a young officer, c. 1845\u20131847\nGrant's father wrote to Representative Thomas L. Hamer requesting that he nominate Ulysses to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Despite political differences with Jesse Root Grant, Hamer, a Democrat, nominated his 17-year-old son to West Point in spring 1839 and Ulysses was accepted on July 1.[23] Unfamiliar with Grant, however, Hamer submitted an incorrect name to West Point. As a result, Grant was enlisted at West Point under the name \"U. S. Grant\".[d][27] As the initials \"U. S.\" also stood for \"Uncle Sam\", he became known amongst army colleagues as \"Sam\".[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGrant played no overt role during the campaign and instead was joined by Sherman and Sheridan in a tour of the West that summer.[282] However, the Republicans adopted his words \"Let us have peace\" as their campaign slogan.[283] Grant's 1862 General Order No. 11 became an issue during the presidential campaign; he sought to distance himself from the order, saying \"I have no prejudice against sect or race, but want each individual to be judged by his own merit.\"[284] The Democrats and their Klan supporters focused mainly on ending Reconstruction, intimidating black people and Republicans, and returning control of the South to the white Democrats and the planter class, alienating War Democrats in the North.[285] An example was the murder of Republican Congressman James M. Hinds in Arkansas by a Klansman in October 1868, as Hinds campaigned for Grant. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJohnson, who believed the law would be overturned, said he would assume Grant's legal responsibility, and reminded Grant that he had promised him to delay his resignation until a suitable replacement was found.[271] The following Monday, not willing to wait for the law to be overturned, Grant surrendered the office to Stanton, causing confusion with Johnson.[272] With the complete backing of his cabinet, Johnson personally accused Grant of lying and \"duplicity\" at a stormy cabinet meeting, while a shocked and disappointed Grant felt it was Johnson who was lying.[273] The publication of angry messages between Grant and Johnson led to a complete break between them.[274] The controversy led to Johnson's impeachment and trial in the Senate; he was acquitted by one vote.[275] Grant's popularity rose among the Radical Republicans and his nomination for the presidency appeared certain.[276]\n\n\n\n### Election of 1868[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1868 United States presidential election\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA war hero, drawn in by his sense of duty, Grant was unanimously nominated by the Republican Party and then elected president in 1868.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBorn and raised in Ohio, Grant attended West Point and graduated with the class of 1843, going on to serve with distinction in the Mexican\u2013American War. He resigned from the army in 1854, returning to civilian life impoverished. In 1861, shortly after the American Civil War began, Grant joined the Union Army and quickly rose to prominence after winning early Union victories in the western theater. In 1863, he led the Vicksburg campaign, gaining control of the Mississippi River, dealing a serious strategic blow to the Confederacy. President Abraham Lincoln promoted him to lieutenant general after his victory at Chattanooga. For thirteen months, Grant fought Robert E. Lee during the high-casualty Overland Campaign which ended with capture of Lee's army at Appomattox, where he formally surrendered to Grant. In 1866, President Andrew Johnson promoted Grant to General of the Army. Later, Grant openly broke with Johnson over Reconstruction policies. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nH. W. Brands' *The Man Who Saved the Union* (2012), Ronald C. White's *American Ulysses* (2016), and Ron Chernow's *Grant* (2017) continued the elevation of Grant's historical reputation.[580] White said that Grant \"demonstrated a distinctive sense of humility, moral courage, and determination\", and as president he \"stood up for African Americans, especially fighting against voter suppression perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan\".[581] White believed that Grant was \"an exceptional person and leader\".[582] Charles W. Calhoun's *The Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant* (2017) noted Grant's successes in office but asked whether Grant's revived reputation was found in the \"popular consciousness\".[583]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn a 2021 C-SPAN survey ranking presidents from worst to best, Grant was ranked 20 out of 44 presidents. He was given \"more credit for Reconstruction and his diplomacy than condemnation for his alleged corruption\" during his presidency.[588]\n\n\n\n## Memorials and presidential library[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cultural depictions of Ulysses S. Grant\n\n![Neoclassical structure with dome](image)Grant's Tomb at dusk, 2016\nSeveral memorials honor Grant. In addition to Grant's Tomb, there is the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial at the foot of Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.[589] Created by sculptor Henry Merwin Shrady and architect Edward Pearce Casey, and dedicated in 1922, it overlooks the Capitol Reflecting Pool.[590]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFundamentally, Grant had an expansionist impulse to protect American interests abroad and was a strong advocate of the Monroe Doctrine.[361] He also had an idealist side to his foreign policy. For instance, Grant appointed a Jewish lawyer, Benjamin F. Peixotto, U.S. Consul in Bucharest, in response to the Romanian persecution of Jews. Grant said that respect \"for human rights is the first duty for those set as rulers\" over the nations.[362]\n\n\n\n![Formal photographic portrait of bearded man](image)Secretary of State Hamilton Fish and Grant successfully settled the Alabama Claims by treaty and arbitration.\n#### Treaty of Washington (1871)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Treaty of Washington (1871)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Maj. General Grant, c.\u20091863\nGrant was hailed across the North as the winning general in the American Civil War and overall his military reputation has held up quite well. Achieving great national fame for his victories at Vicksburg and the surrender at Appomattox, he was widely credited as the General who \"saved the Union\". Grant was the most successful general, Union or Confederate, to dominate the Civil War.[569] Criticized by the South for using excessive force, his overall military reputation stands intact.[570] Grant's drinking was often exaggerated by the press and falsely stereotyped by many of his rivals and critics.[571] During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Grant's reputation was damaged by the \"Lost Cause\" movement and the Dunning School.[572]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhen the Democrats gained a majority in the House after the 1874 elections, the lame-duck Republican Congress did so before the Democrats took office.[462] On January 14, 1875, Grant signed the Specie Payment Resumption Act, which required gradual reduction of the number of greenbacks allowed to circulate and declared that they would be redeemed for gold beginning on January 1, 1879.[463]\n\n\n\n### Reforms and scandals[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Reforms of the Ulysses S. Grant administration and Scandals of the Ulysses S. Grant administration\n\nThe post-Civil War economy brought on massive industrial wealth and government expansion. Speculation, lifestyle extravagance, and corruption in federal offices were rampant.[464] All of Grant's executive departments were investigated by Congress.[465] Grant by nature was honest, trusting, gullible, and extremely loyal to his chosen friends. His responses to malfeasance were mixed, at times appointing cabinet reformers, but also at times defending culprits.[466]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Grant, shown in a cartoon as an acrobat hanging from rings, holding up multiple politician/acrobats](image)Cartoonist Joseph Keppler lampooned Grant and his associates.  \n *Puck*, 1880\nStalwarts, led by Grant's old political ally, Roscoe Conkling, saw Grant's renewed popularity as an opportunity to regain power, and sought to nominate him for the presidency in 1880. Opponents called it a violation of the unofficial two-term rule in use since George Washington. Grant said nothing publicly but wanted the job and encouraged his men.[526] Washburne urged him to run; Grant demurred, saying he would be happy for the Republicans to win with another candidate, though he preferred James G. Blaine to John Sherman. Even so, Conkling and John A. Logan began to organize delegates in Grant's favor. When the convention convened in Chicago in June, there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any other candidate, but he was still short of a majority vote to get the nomination.[527]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStanton notified Grant of the president's death and summoned him back to Washington. Vice President Andrew Johnson was sworn in as president on April 15. Attending Lincoln's funeral on April 19, Grant stood alone and wept openly; he later said Lincoln was \"the greatest man I have ever known\".[250] Grant was determined to work with Johnson, and he privately expressed \"every reason to hope\" in the new president's ability to run the government \"in its old channel\".[251]\n\n\n\n## Commanding generalship (1865\u20131869)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Commanding generalship of Ulysses S.

Bass, the Republican nominee.[35]\n\n\nIn 1870, with the help of friend Oscar Folsom, Cleveland secured the Democratic nomination for sheriff of Erie County, New York.[43] He won the election by a 303-vote margin and took office on January 1, 1871, at age 33.[44][45] While this new career took him away from the practice of law, it was rewarding in other ways: the fees were said to yield up to $40,000 (equivalent to $1,017,333 in 2023) over the two-year term.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEven so, his reputation for probity and good character survived the troubles of his second term. Biographer Allan Nevins wrote, \"[I]n Grover Cleveland, the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities. He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have. He possessed honesty, courage, firmness, independence, and common sense. But he possessed them to a degree other men do not.\"[11] By the end of his second term, he was severely unpopular, even among Democrats.[12] After leaving the White House, Cleveland lived in retirement at his estate, Westland Mansion, and served as a trustee of Princeton University. He continued to voice his political views, but fell seriously ill during the autumn of 1907. He died in 1908, aged 71. Today, Cleveland is praised for honesty, integrity, adherence to his morals, defying party boundaries, and effective leadership and is typically ranked in the middle tier of U.S. presidents.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n### Childhood and family history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCleveland was elected mayor of Buffalo in 1881 and governor of New York in 1882. While governor, he closely cooperated with state assembly minority leader Theodore Roosevelt to pass reform measures, winning national attention.[1] He led the Bourbon Democrats, a pro-business movement opposed to high tariffs, free silver, inflation, imperialism, and subsidies to business, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the time.[2] Cleveland also won praise for honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism.[3] His fight against political corruption, patronage, and bossism convinced many like-minded Republicans, called \"Mugwumps\", to cross party lines and support him in the 1884 election. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Grover Cleveland\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n|  |\n| 22nd & 24th President of the United States |\n| **In office**March 4, 1893\u00a0\u2013 March 4, 1897 |\n| Vice President | Adlai Stevenson I |\n| Preceded by | Benjamin Harrison |\n| Succeeded by | William McKinley |\n| **In office**March 4, 1885\u00a0\u2013 March 4, 1889 |\n| Vice President | * Thomas A.

In the years before his presidency, he served as a mayor and governor in New York state, winning fame as an anti-corruption crusader. Cleveland is the only president in U.S. history to serve non-consecutive presidential terms.[b] He won the popular vote in three presidential elections\u20141884, 1888, and 1892. Benjamin Harrison won the electoral college vote, and thus the presidency, in 1888. Cleveland was one of two Democrats elected president (followed by Woodrow Wilson in 1912) in an era when Republicans dominated the presidency between 1861 and 1933.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Gubernatorial portrait of Grover Cleveland\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: 1884 United States presidential election and Grover Cleveland 1884 presidential campaign\n\n### Nomination for president[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1884 Democratic National Convention\n\n![](image)An anti-Blaine cartoon presents him as the \"tattooed man\", with many indelible scandals.\n![](image)An anti-Cleveland cartoon highlights the Halpin scandal.\nIn June 1884, the Republican Party convened their nomination convention in Chicago, selecting former U.S. House Speaker James G. Blaine of Maine as their nominee for president. Blaine's nomination alienated many Republicans who viewed Blaine as ambitious and immoral.[85] The Republican standard-bearer was weakened by alienating the Mugwumps, and the Conkling faction, recently disenfranchised by President Chester Arthur.[86] Democratic party leaders believed the Republicans' choice gave them an opportunity to win the White House for the first time since 1856 if the right candidate could be found.[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Cleveland in 1903 at age 66 by Frederick Gutekunst\nCleveland's agrarian and silverite enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in 1896, repudiated his administration and the gold standard, and nominated William Jennings Bryan on a free-silver platform.[269][270] Cleveland silently supported the Gold Democrats' third-party ticket that promised to defend the gold standard, limit government, and oppose high tariffs, but he declined their nomination for a third term.[271] The party won only 100,000 votes in the general election, and William McKinley, the Republican nominee, triumphed easily over Bryan.[272] Agrarians nominated Bryan again in 1900. In 1904, the conservatives, with Cleveland's support, regained control of the Democratic Party and nominated Alton B. Parker.[273]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)An early, undated photograph of Grover Cleveland\nCleveland received his elementary education at the Fayetteville Academy and the Clinton Liberal Academy.[26] After his father died in 1853, he again left school to help support his family. Later that year, Cleveland's brother William was hired as a teacher at the New York Institute for the Blind in New York City, and William obtained a place for Cleveland as an assistant teacher. Cleveland returned home to Holland Patent at the end of 1854, where an elder in his church offered to pay for his college education if he would promise to become a minister. Cleveland declined, and in 1855 he decided to move west.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Jeffers, H.

On his mother's side, Cleveland was descended from Anglo-Irish Protestants and German Quakers from Philadelphia.[17] Cleveland was distantly related to General Moses Cleaveland, after whom the city of Cleveland, Ohio, was named.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThey also blistered Blaine for attending a banquet with some of New York City's wealthiest men.[108]\n\n\nAfter the votes were counted, Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by 1,200 votes.[109] While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219\u2013182.[109] Following the electoral victory, the \"Ma, Ma\u00a0...\" attack phrase gained a classic riposte: \"Gone to the White House.

In a 1905 article in *The Ladies Home Journal*, Cleveland weighed in on the women's suffrage movement, writing that \"sensible and responsible women do not want to vote.

The 1892 election restored him to the White House. As his second administration began, the Panic of 1893 sparked a severe national depression. Many voters blamed the Democrats, opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a political realignment that started the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.[5] An anti-imperialist,[6] Cleveland opposed the push to annex Hawaii, launched an investigation into the 1893 coup against the Hawaiian queen, and called for her to be restored; the House of Representatives adopted a resolution against annexation.[7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Grover Cleveland: A Resource Guide, Library of Congress\n* Grover Cleveland: A bibliography by the Buffalo History Museum\n* Grover Cleveland Sites in Buffalo, NY: A Google Map developed by The Buffalo History Museum\n* Top Five Urban Legends About Grover Cleveland in Buffalo: A slide deck by the Buffalo History Museum.\n* Index to the Grover Cleveland Papers at the Library of Congress\n* Essay on Cleveland and each member of his cabinet and First Lady, Miller Center of Public Affairs\n* \"Life Portrait of Grover Cleveland\", from C-SPAN's *American Presidents: Life Portraits*, August 13, 1999\n* Interview with H.

He intervened in the 1894 Pullman Strike to keep the railroads moving, angering both Illinois Democrats and labor unions nationwide; his support of the gold standard and opposition to free silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party.[9] Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters\u2014depressions and strikes\u2014in his second term.[9] In his memoirs, future president Harry S. Truman expressed criticism of Cleveland's handling of labor strikes in his second term, arguing that \"Cleveland had a lot of trouble with strikes and riots, but the Democratic Party, as usual, was on the liberal side during his second administration. But the President was not. He became an ultra-conservative.\u201d[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNew York Democratic party officials began to consider Cleveland a possible nominee for governor.[70] Daniel Manning, a party insider who admired Cleveland's record, was instrumental in his candidacy.[71] With a split in the state Republican party in 1882, the Democratic party was considered to be at an advantage; several men contended for that party's nomination.[70] The two leading Democratic candidates were Roswell P. Flower and Henry W. Slocum. Their factions deadlocked, and the convention could not agree on a nominee.[72] Cleveland, in third place on the first ballot, picked up support in subsequent votes and emerged as the compromise choice.[73] The Republican party remained divided, and in the general election Cleveland emerged the victor, with 535,318 votes to Republican nominee Charles J. Folger's 342,464.[74] Cleveland's margin of victory was, at the time, the largest in a contested New York election; the Democrats also picked up seats in both houses of the New York State Legislature.[75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWeaver promised free silver, generous veterans' pensions, and an eight-hour day.[198] The Tammany Hall Democrats adhered to the national ticket, allowing a united Democratic party to carry New York.[199] At the campaign's end, many Populists and labor supporters endorsed Cleveland after an attempt by the Carnegie Corporation to break the union during the Homestead strike in Pittsburgh and after a similar conflict between big business and labor at the Tennessee Coal and Iron Co.[200] The final result was a victory for Cleveland by wide margins in both the popular and electoral votes, and it was Cleveland's third consecutive popular vote plurality.[201]\n\n\n\n\n## Second presidency (1893\u20131897)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidencies of Grover Cleveland \u00a7\u00a0Second presidency (1893\u20131897)\n\n### Economic panic and the silver issue[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nand Cleveland's veto was sustained.[80]\n\n\nCleveland's defiance of political corruption won him popular acclaim. Yet it also brought the enmity of New York City's influential Tammany Hall organization and its boss, John Kelly.[81] Tammany Hall and Kelly had disapproved of Cleveland's nomination for governor, and their resistance intensified after Cleveland openly opposed and prevented the re-election of Thomas F. Grady, their point man in the State Senate.[82] Cleveland also steadfastly opposed other Tammany nominees, as well as bills passed as a result of their deal-making.[83] The loss of Tammany's support was offset by the support of Theodore Roosevelt and other reform-minded Republicans, who helped Cleveland pass several laws to reform municipal governments.[84] Cleveland closely worked with Roosevelt, who served as assembly minority leader in 1883; the municipal legislation they cooperated on gained Cleveland national recognition.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Election of 1884[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs in 1884, the election focused on the swing states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana. But unlike that year, when Cleveland had triumphed in all four, in 1888 he won only two, losing his home state of New York by 14,373 votes. Cleveland won a plurality of the popular vote \u2013 48.6 percent vs. 47.8 percent for Harrison \u2013 but Harrison won the Electoral College vote easily, 233\u2013168.[179] The Republicans won Indiana, largely as the result of a fraudulent voting practice known as Blocks of Five.[180] Cleveland continued his duties diligently until the end of the term and began to look forward to returning to private life.[181]\n\n\n\n### Private citizen for four years[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCleveland nominated 41 lower federal court judges in addition to his four Supreme Court justices. These included two judges to the United States circuit courts, nine judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 30 judges to the United States district courts. Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals, he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office at the time that the change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term, and all of his appointments to the Courts of Appeals were made in his second.\n\n\n\n## Election of 1888 and return to private life (1889\u20131893)[edit]\n\n\n### Defeated by Harrison[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 1888 United States presidential election and Grover Cleveland 1888 presidential campaign\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Cleveland portrayed as a tariff reformer\nSoon after taking office, Cleveland was faced with the task of filling all the government jobs for which the president had the power of appointment. These jobs were typically filled under the spoils system, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone solely on the basis of party service.[111] He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers.[112] Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats;[113] this was especially the case with policymaking positions.[114] While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.[115]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Poster President Cleveland and Allen G. Thurman of Ohio (1888).\n![](image)Results of the 1888 Election\nThe Republicans nominated Benjamin Harrison, the former U.S. Senator from Indiana for president and Levi P. Morton of New York for vice president. Cleveland was renominated at the Democratic convention in St. Louis.[175] Following Vice President Thomas A. Hendricks' death in 1885, the Democrats chose Allen G. Thurman of Ohio to be Cleveland's new running mate.[175]\n\n\nThe Republicans gained the upper hand in the campaign, as Cleveland's campaign was poorly managed by Calvin S. Brice and William H. Barnum, whereas Harrison had engaged more aggressive fundraisers and tacticians in Matt Quay and John Wanamaker.[176]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Articles related to Grover Cleveland\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nPresidents of the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| Presidents andpresidencies | 1.

He refused to promote the previous administration's Nicaragua canal treaty, and generally was less of an expansionist in foreign relations.[143] Cleveland's Secretary of State, Thomas F. Bayard, negotiated with Joseph Chamberlain of the United Kingdom over fishing rights in the waters off Canada, and struck a conciliatory note, despite the opposition of New England's Republican Senators.[144] Cleveland also withdrew from Senate consideration of the Berlin Conference treaty which guaranteed an open door for U.S. interests in the Congo.[145]\n\n\n\n### Military policy, 1885\u20131889[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJust before the 1894 election, Cleveland was warned by Francis Lynde Stetson, an advisor: \"We are on the eve of [a] very dark night, unless a return of commercial prosperity relieves popular discontent with what they believe [is] Democratic incompetence to make laws, and consequently [discontent] with Democratic Administrations anywhere and everywhere.\"[227] The warning was appropriate, for in the Congressional elections, Republicans won their biggest landslide in decades, taking full control of the House, while the Populists lost most of their support. Cleveland's factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including full control in Illinois and Michigan, and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts were two of the few states that remained under the control of Cleveland's allies. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

His wife and his doctor controlled Wilson, and no significant decisions were made. Meanwhile, his policies alienated German- and Irish-American Democrats and the Republicans won a landslide in the 1920 presidential election. Scholars have generally ranked Wilson in the upper tier of U.S. presidents, although he has been criticized for supporting racial segregation. His liberalism nevertheless lives on as a major factor in American foreign policy, and his vision of ethnic self-determination resonated globally.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Early life and academic career of Woodrow Wilson\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBorn in Staunton, Virginia, Wilson grew up in the American South, mainly in Augusta, Georgia, during the Civil War and Reconstruction. After earning a Ph.D. in history and political science from Johns Hopkins University, Wilson taught at various colleges before becoming the president of Princeton University and a spokesman for progressivism in higher education. As governor of New Jersey from 1911 to 1913, Wilson broke with party bosses and won the passage of several progressive reforms. To win the presidential nomination he mobilized progressives and Southerners to his cause at the 1912 Democratic National Convention. Wilson defeated incumbent Republican William Howard Taft and third-party nominee Theodore Roosevelt to easily win the 1912 United States presidential election, becoming the first Southerner to do so since 1848. During his first year as president, Wilson authorized the widespread imposition of segregation inside the federal bureaucracy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n330. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Ambar, Saladin (October 4, 2016). \"Woodrow Wilson: Impact and Legacy\". *Miller Center*.

Taft won 23.2 percent of the popular vote but just 8 electoral votes, while Debs won 6 percent of the popular vote. In the concurrent congressional elections, Democrats retained control of the House and won a majority in the Senate.[103] Wilson's victory made him the first Southerner to win a presidential election since the Civil War, the first Democratic president since Grover Cleveland left office in 1897,[104] and the first and only president to hold a Ph.D.[105]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1913\u20131921)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Woodrow Wilson\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Woodrow Wilson presidency.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Judicial appointments\n\t+ Supreme Court\n* Wilson and race relations\n* Wilson House\n* Princeton School of Public and International Affairs\n* Wilson Center\n* Presidential Library\n* Wilsonianism\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n![Seal of the President of the United States](image) |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n**Thomas Woodrow Wilson** (December 28, 1856\u00a0\u2013 February 3, 1924) was an American politician and academic who served as the 28th president of the United States from 1913 to 1921.

On October 20, Wilson submitted his letter of resignation to Princeton University.[70] Wilson's campaign focused on his promise to be independent of party bosses. He quickly shed his professorial style for more emboldened speechmaking and presented himself as a full-fledged progressive.[71] Though Republican William Howard Taft had carried New Jersey in the 1908 presidential election by more than 82,000 votes, Wilson soundly defeated Republican gubernatorial nominee Vivian M. Lewis by a margin of more than 65,000 votes.[72] Democrats also took control of the general assembly in the 1910 elections, though the state senate remained in Republican hands.[73] After winning the election, Wilson appointed Joseph Patrick Tumulty as his private secretary, a position he held throughout Wilson's political career.[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Pestritto, Ronald J.

He also favored a minimum wage for all work performed by and for the federal government.[181] The Democrats also campaigned on the slogan \"He Kept Us Out of War,\" and warned that a Republican victory would mean war with Germany.[182] Hoping to reunify the progressive and conservative wings of the party, the 1916 Republican National Convention nominated Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes for president; as a jurist, he had been completely out of politics by 1912. Though Republicans attacked Wilson's foreign policy on various grounds, domestic affairs generally dominated the campaign. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo shape public opinion, Wilson in 1917 established the first modern propaganda office, the Committee on Public Information (CPI), headed by George Creel.[218]\n\n\nWilson called on voters in the 1918 off-year elections to elect Democrats as an endorsement of his policies. However the Republicans won over alienated German-Americans and took control.[219] Wilson refused to coordinate or compromise with the new leaders of House and Senate\u2014Senator Henry Cabot Lodge became his nemesis.[220]\n\n\nIn November 1919, Wilson's Attorney General, A. Mitchell Palmer, began to target anarchists, Industrial Workers of the World members, and other antiwar groups in what became known as the Palmer Raids. Thousands were arrested for incitement to violence, espionage, or sedition. Wilson by that point was incapacitated and was not told what was happening.[221]\n\n\n\n### Aftermath of World War I[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Foreign policy of the Woodrow Wilson administration\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWilson became disenchanted with his job as Princeton University president due to the resistance to his recommendations, and he began considering a run for political office. Prior to the 1908 Democratic National Convention, Wilson dropped hints to some influential players in the Democratic Party of his interest in the ticket. While he had no real expectations of being placed on it, Wilson left instructions that he should not be offered the vice presidential nomination. Party regulars considered his ideas politically and geographically detached and fanciful, but the seeds of interest had been sown.[65] In 1956, McGeorge Bundy described Wilson's contribution to Princeton: \"Wilson was right in his conviction that Princeton must be more than a wonderfully pleasant and decent home for nice young men; it has been more ever since his time.\"[66]\n\n\n\n## Governor of New Jersey (1911\u20131913)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1910 New Jersey gubernatorial election\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Life | * Birthplace and Presidential Library\n\t+ papers and manuscripts\n* Boyhood home in Georgia\n* Boyhood home in South Carolina\n* Princeton University president\n* Summer White House (Harlakenden\n* Shadow Lawn)\n* Woodrow Wilson House\n* Gravesite\n |\n| Books | * *Congressional Government* (1900)\n* *When a Man Comes to Himself* (1901)\n* *The New Freedom* (1913)\n |\n| Elections | * 1910 New Jersey gubernatorial election\n* 1912 Democratic National Convention\n* 1912 U.S. presidential election\n* 1916 Democratic National Convention\n* 1916 U.S. presidential election\n |\n| Legacy(memorials) | * Bibliography\n* Woodrow Wilson Awards\n* Woodrow Wilson Foundation\n* Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars\n\t+ *The Wilson Quarterly*\n* Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs\n* High schools\n* Woodrow Wilson Junior College\n* *Celestial Sphere Woodrow Wilson Memorial*\n* *Woodrow Wilson* (Austin statue)\n* Wilson Square (Warsaw)\n* Woodrow Wilson Monument (Prague)\n* Woodrow Wilson Bridge\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSaunders, seemed to indicate that Wilson \"was laying the groundwork for the modern welfare state.\"[47] His third book, *Division and Reunion* (1893),[48] became a standard university textbook for teaching mid- and late-19th century U.S. history.[49]\n\n\n\n### President of Princeton University[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Princeton University \u00a7\u00a0Woodrow Wilson\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPresident of the United States from 1913 to 1921\n\nThis article is about the president of the United States.

He was a member of the Democratic Party and is the only U.S. president to have served more than eight years in office. His third and fourth terms were dominated by the ultimately successful prosecution of World War II.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRoosevelt cared little for the practice of law and told friends he planned to enter politics.[46] Despite his admiration for cousin Theodore, Franklin shared his father's bond with the Democratic Party, and in preparation for the 1910 elections, the party recruited Roosevelt to run for a seat in the New York State Assembly.[47] Roosevelt was a compelling recruit for the party. He had the personality and energy for campaigning, and he had the money to pay for his own campaign.[48] But Roosevelt's campaign for the state assembly ended after the Democratic incumbent, Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler, chose to seek re-election. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRoosevelt opposed Tammany Hall by supporting New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson's successful bid for the 1912 Democratic nomination.[57] The election became a three-way contest when Theodore Roosevelt left the Republican Party to launch a third party campaign against Wilson and sitting Republican President William Howard Taft. Franklin's decision to back Wilson over his cousin in the general election alienated some of his family, except Theodore.[58] Roosevelt overcame a bout of typhoid fever, and with help from journalist Louis McHenry Howe, he was re-elected in the 1912 elections. After the election, he served as chairman of the Agriculture Committee, and his success with farm and labor bills was a precursor to his New Deal policies years later.[59] He had then become more consistently progressive, in support of labor and social welfare programs.[60]\n\n\n\n### Assistant Secretary of the Navy (1913\u20131919)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Born | Franklin Delano Roosevelt\n(1882-01-30)January 30, 1882Hyde Park, New York, U.S. |\n| Died | April 12, 1945(1945-04-12) (aged\u00a063)Warm Springs, Georgia, U.S. |\n| Resting place | Springwood Estate |\n| Political party | Democratic |\n| Spouse | \nEleanor Roosevelt\n \u200b\n(m.\u00a01905)\u200b\n |\n| Children | 6, including Franklin\u00a0Jr., Anna, Elliott, James\u00a0II, and John\u00a0II |\n| Parents | * James Roosevelt I\n* Sara Delano\n |\n| Relatives | * Roosevelt family\n* Delano family\n |\n| Alma mater | * Harvard University (AB)\n* Columbia University\n |\n| Profession | * Lawyer\n* politician\n |\n| Signature | ![Cursive signature in ink](image) |\n| Franklin D.

His isolationist critics faded away, and even the Republicans joined in his overall policies.[370] He also created a new understanding of the presidency, permanently increasing the power of the president at the expense of Congress.[371]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPresident of the United States from 1933 to 1945\n\n\"FDR\" redirects here.

Roosevelt failed badly, managing to defeat only one of the ten targeted, a conservative Democrat from New York City.[153] In the November 1938 elections, Democrats lost six Senate seats and 71 House seats, with losses concentrated among pro-New Deal Democrats. When Congress reconvened in 1939, Republicans under Senator Robert Taft formed a Conservative coalition with Southern Democrats, virtually ending Roosevelt's ability to enact his domestic proposals.[199] Despite their opposition to Roosevelt's domestic policies, many of these conservative Congressmen would provide crucial support for Roosevelt's foreign policy before and during World War II.[200]\n\n\n\n#### Conservation and the environment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA late August poll taken by Gallup found the race to be essentially tied, but Roosevelt's popularity surged in September following the announcement of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement.[244] Willkie supported much of the New Deal as well as rearmament and aid to Britain but warned that Roosevelt would drag the country into another European war.[245] Responding to Willkie's attacks, Roosevelt promised to keep the country out of the war.[246] Over its last month, the campaign degenerated into a series of outrageous accusations and mud-slinging, if not by the two candidates themselves then by their respective parties.[133] Roosevelt won the 1940 election with 55% of the popular vote, 38 of the 48 states, and almost 85% of the electoral vote.[247]\n\n\n\n### Third and fourth terms (1941\u20131945)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Franklin D.

Historians and political scientists consider the 1932\u201336 elections to be a political realignment. Roosevelt's victory was enabled by the creation of the New Deal coalition, small farmers, the Southern whites, Catholics, big city political machines, labor unions, northern African Americans (southern ones were still disfranchised), Jews, intellectuals, and political liberals.[141] The creation of the New Deal coalition transformed American politics and started what political scientists call the \"New Deal Party System\" or the Fifth Party System.[142] Between the Civil War and 1929, Democrats had rarely controlled both houses of Congress and had won just four of seventeen presidential elections; from 1932 to 1979, Democrats won eight of twelve presidential elections and generally controlled both houses of Congress.[143]\n\n\n\n### Transition and assassination attempt[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRoosevelt was criticized by conservatives for his economic policies, especially the shift in tone from individualism to collectivism with the expansion of the welfare state and regulation of the economy. Those criticisms continued decades after his death. One factor in the revisiting of these issues in later decades was the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, who opposed the New Deal.[379][380]\n\n\n\n### Memorials[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of memorials to Franklin D.

He also built the New Deal coalition, realigning American politics into the Fifth Party System and defining American liberalism throughout the middle third of the 20th century. He created numerous programs to provide relief to the unemployed and farmers while seeking economic recovery with the National Recovery Administration and other programs. He also instituted major regulatory reforms related to finance, communications, and labor, and presided over the end of Prohibition. In 1936, Roosevelt won a landslide reelection with the economy having improved from 1933, but the economy relapsed into a deep recession in 1937 and 1938. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRather than putting his political hopes on hold, Roosevelt ran for a seat in the state senate.[49] The senate district, located in Dutchess, Columbia, and Putnam, was strongly Republican.[50] Roosevelt feared that opposition from Theodore could end his campaign, but Theodore encouraged his candidacy despite their party differences.[47] Acting as his own campaign manager, Roosevelt traveled throughout the senate district via automobile at a time when few could afford a car.[51] Due to his aggressive campaign,[52] his name recognition in the Hudson Valley, and the Democratic landslide in the 1910 United States elections, Roosevelt won a surprising victory.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the election against Landon and a third-party candidate, Roosevelt won 60.8% of the vote and carried every state except Maine and Vermont.[184] The Democratic ticket won the highest proportion of the popular vote.[f] Democrats also expanded their majorities in Congress, winning control of over three-quarters of the seats in each house. The election also saw the consolidation of the New Deal coalition; while the Democrats lost some of their traditional allies in big business, they were replaced by groups such as organized labor and African Americans, the latter of whom voted Democratic for the first time since the Civil War.[185] Roosevelt lost high-income voters, especially businessmen and professionals, but made major gains among the poor and minorities. He won 86 percent of the Jewish vote, 81 percent of Catholics, 80 percent of union members, 76 percent of Southerners, 76 percent of blacks in northern cities, and 75 percent of people on relief. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Campbell, James E.

His parents, who were sixth cousins,[2] both came from wealthy, established New York families, the Roosevelts, the Aspinwalls and the Delanos, respectively. Roosevelt's paternal ancestor migrated to New Amsterdam in the 17th century, and the Roosevelts succeeded as merchants and landowners.[3] The Delano family patriarch, Philip Delano, traveled to the New World on the *Fortune* in 1621, and the Delanos thrived as merchants and shipbuilders in Massachusetts.[4] Franklin had a half-brother, James Roosevelt \"Rosy\" Roosevelt, from his father's previous marriage.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the campaign, Cox and Roosevelt defended the Wilson administration and the League of Nations, both of which were unpopular in 1920.[87] Roosevelt personally supported U.S. membership in the League of Nations, but, unlike Wilson, he favored compromising with Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and other \"Reservationists\".[88] The Cox\u2013Roosevelt ticket was defeated by Republicans Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge in the presidential election by a wide margin, and the Republican ticket carried every state outside of the South.[89] Roosevelt accepted the loss without issue and later reflected that the relationships and goodwill that he built in the 1920 campaign proved to be a major asset in his 1932 campaign. The 1920 election also saw the first public participation of Eleanor Roosevelt who, with the support of Louis Howe, established herself as a valuable political player.[90]\n\n\n\n## Paralytic illness and political comeback (1921\u20131928)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Paralytic illness of Franklin D.

It is that you may never be President of the United States.\"[6] Franklin's mother, the dominant influence in his early years, once declared, \"My son Franklin is a Delano, not a Roosevelt at all.\"[2][7] James, who was 54 when Franklin was born, was considered by some as a remote father, though biographer James MacGregor Burns indicates James interacted with his son more than was typical at the time.[8]\n\n\n\n### Education and early career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nRoosevelt in 1893, at the age of 11\n![](image)\nRoosevelt in 1900, at the age of 18\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Freidel, Frank (1952\u20131973), *Franklin D.

The chief opposition to Roosevelt's candidacy came from Northeastern conservatives, Speaker of the House John Nance Garner of Texas and Al Smith, the 1928 Democratic presidential nominee.[133]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFranklin D.

He was elected a member of the New York State Senate from 1911 to 1913 and was then the assistant secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Roosevelt was James M. Cox's running mate on the Democratic Party's ticket in the 1920 U.S. presidential election, but Cox lost to Republican nominee Warren G. Harding. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted a paralytic illness that permanently paralyzed his legs. Partly through the encouragement of his wife, Eleanor Roosevelt, he returned to public office as governor of New York from 1929 to 1933, during which he promoted programs to combat the Great Depression besetting the U.S. In the 1932 presidential election, Roosevelt defeated Republican president Herbert Hoover in a landslide.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the transition, Roosevelt chose Howe as his chief of staff, and Farley as Postmaster General. Frances Perkins, as Secretary of Labor, became the first woman appointed to a cabinet position.[133] William H. Woodin, a Republican industrialist close to Roosevelt, was the choice for Secretary of the Treasury, while Roosevelt chose Senator Cordell Hull of Tennessee as Secretary of State. Harold L. Ickes and Henry A. Wallace, two progressive Republicans, were selected for the roles of Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture, respectively.[146]\n\n\nIn February 1933, Roosevelt escaped an assassination attempt by Giuseppe Zangara, who expressed a \"hate for all rulers.\" As he was attempting to shoot Roosevelt, Zangara was struck by a woman with her purse; he instead mortally wounded Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who was sitting alongside Roosevelt.[147][148]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1933\u20131945)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRoosevelt maintained contacts with the Democratic Party during the 1920s, and he remained active in New York politics while also establishing contacts in the South, particularly in Georgia.[104] He issued an open letter endorsing Al Smith's successful campaign in New York's 1922 gubernatorial election, which both aided Smith and showed Roosevelt's continuing relevance as a political figure.[105] Roosevelt and Smith came from different backgrounds and never fully trusted one another, but Roosevelt supported Smith's progressive policies, while Smith was happy to have the backing of the prominent and well-respected Roosevelt.[106]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite short legislative sessions, Roosevelt treated his new position as a full-time career.[54] Taking his seat on January 1, 1911, Roosevelt soon became the leader of a group of \"Insurgents\" in opposition to the Tammany Hall machine that dominated the state Democratic Party. In the 1911 U.S. Senate election, which was determined in a joint session of the New York state legislature,[c] Roosevelt and nineteen other Democrats caused a prolonged deadlock by opposing a series of Tammany-backed candidates. Tammany threw its backing behind James A. O'Gorman, a highly regarded judge whom Roosevelt found acceptable, and O'Gorman won the election in late March.[55] Roosevelt in the process became a popular figure among New York Democrats.[53] News articles and cartoons depicted \"the second coming of a Roosevelt\", sending \"cold shivers down the spine of Tammany\".[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen Roosevelt began his run for a second term in May 1930, he reiterated his doctrine from the campaign two years before: \"that progressive government by its very terms must be a living and growing thing, that the battle for it is never-ending and that if we let up for one single moment or one single year, not merely do we stand still but we fall back in the march of civilization.\"[126] He ran on a platform that called for aid to farmers, full employment, unemployment insurance, and old-age pensions.[127] He was elected to a second term by a 14% margin.[128]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Leuchtenburg, William (2015). *The American President: From Teddy Roosevelt to Bill Clinton*.

Eisenhower</title>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the election approached, other prominent citizens and politicians from both parties urged Eisenhower to run for president. In January 1948, after learning of plans in New Hampshire to elect delegates supporting him for the forthcoming Republican National Convention, Eisenhower stated through the Army that he was \"not available for and could not accept nomination to high political office\"; \"life-long professional soldiers\", he wrote, \"in the absence of some obvious and overriding reason, [should] abstain from seeking high political office\".[113] Eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time. Many believed he was forgoing his only opportunity to be president as Republican Thomas E. Dewey was considered the probable winner and would presumably serve two terms, meaning that Eisenhower, at age 66 in 1956, would be too old to have another chance to run.[115]\n\n\n\n### President at Columbia University and NATO Supreme Commander[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn his farewell address to the nation, he expressed his concerns about the dangers of massive military spending, particularly deficit spending and government contracts to private military manufacturers, which he dubbed \"the military\u2013industrial complex\". Historical evaluations of his presidency place him among the upper tier of American presidents.\n\n\n\n\n## Family background[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Family of Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\nThe Eisenhauer (German for \"iron hewer\" or \"iron miner\") family migrated from the German village of Karlsbrunn to the Province of Pennsylvania in 1741, initially settling in York, Pennsylvania. The family moved to Kansas in the 1880s.[3] Accounts vary as to how and when the German name Eisenhauer was anglicized to Eisenhower.[4] Eisenhower's Pennsylvania Dutch ancestors, who were primarily farmers, included Hans Nikolaus Eisenhauer of Karlsbrunn, who migrated in 1741 to Lancaster, Pennsylvania.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Official White House Portrait of President Eisenhower, c.\u20091960\nEisenhower had a Republican Congress for only his first two years in office; in the Senate, Republicans held the majority by a one-vote margin. Despite being Eisenhower's political opponent for the 1952 Republican presidential nomination, Senator Majority Leader Robert A. Taft assisted Eisenhower a great deal by promoting the President's proposals among the \"Old Guard\" Republican Senators. Taft's death in July 1953 - six months into Eisenhower's presidency - affected Eisenhower both personally and professionally. The President noted he had lost \"a dear friend\" with Taft's passing. Eisenhower disliked Taft's successor as Majority Leader, Senator William Knowland, and the relationship between the two men led to tension between the Senate and the White House.[266]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThroughout his presidency, Eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism.[157] He described himself as a \"progressive conservative\"[158] and used terms such as \"progressive moderate\" and \"dynamic conservatism\" to describe his approach.[159] He continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation, especially Social Security. He expanded its programs and rolled them into the new Cabinet-level agency of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers. He implemented racial integration in the Armed Services in two years, which had not been completed under Truman.[160]\n\n\nIn a private letter, Eisenhower wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Should any party attempt to abolish social security and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group of course, that believes you can do these things [...] Their number is negligible and they are stupid.[161]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEisenhower was born into a large family of mostly Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry in Denison, Texas, and raised in Abilene, Kansas. His family had a strong religious background, and his mother became a Jehovah's Witness. Eisenhower, however, belonged to no organized church until 1952. He graduated from West Point in 1915 and later married Mamie Doud, with whom he had two sons. During World War I, he was denied a request to serve in Europe and instead commanded a unit that trained tank crews. Following the war, he served under various generals and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in 1941. After the United States entered World War II, Eisenhower oversaw the invasions of North Africa and Sicily before supervising the invasions of France and Germany. After the war ended in Europe, he served as military governor of the American-occupied zone of Germany (1945), Army Chief of Staff (1945\u20131948), president of Columbia University (1948\u20131953), and as the first supreme commander of NATO (1951\u20131952). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Dwight David Eisenhower** (/\u02c8a\u026az\u0259nha\u028a.\u0259r/ *EYE-z\u0259n-how-\u0259r*; born **David Dwight Eisenhower**; October 14, 1890 \u2013 March 28, 1969), nicknamed **Ike**, was an American military officer and statesman who served as the 34th president of the United States from 1953 to 1961. During World War II, he served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe and achieved the five-star rank as General of the Army. Eisenhower planned and supervised two of the most consequential military campaigns of World War II: Operation Torch in the North Africa campaign in 1942\u20131943 and the D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Eisenhower button from the 1952 campaign\nPresident Truman sensed a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president, and he again pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat in 1951. But Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democrats and declared himself to be a Republican.[139] A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate and that there was a mandate from the public for him to be their president. Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. and others succeeded in convincing him, and he resigned his command at NATO in June 1952 to campaign full-time.[140]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter leaving office, Eisenhower did not completely retreat from political life. He flew to San Antonio, where he had been stationed years earlier, to support John W. Goode, the unsuccessful Republican candidate against the Democrat Henry B. Gonzalez for Texas's 20th congressional district seat.[308] He addressed the 1964 Republican National Convention, in San Francisco, and appeared with party nominee Barry Goldwater in a campaign commercial from his Gettysburg retreat.[309] That endorsement came somewhat reluctantly, because Goldwater had in the late 1950s criticized Eisenhower's administration as \"a dime-store New Deal\".[310] On January 20, 1969, the day Nixon was inaugurated as President, Eisenhower issued a statement praising his former vice president and calling it a \"day for rejoicing\".[311]\n\n\n\n### Death[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Succeeded by | George S.

Taft, who opposed NATO and wanted no foreign entanglements. Eisenhower won that election and the 1956 election in landslides, both times defeating Adlai Stevenson II. Eisenhower's main goals in office were to contain the spread of communism and reduce federal deficits. In 1953, he considered using nuclear weapons to end the Korean War and may have threatened China with nuclear attack if an armistice was not reached quickly. China did agree and an armistice resulted, which remains in effect. His New Look policy of nuclear deterrence prioritized \"inexpensive\" nuclear weapons while reducing funding for expensive Army divisions. He continued Harry S. Truman's policy of recognizing Taiwan as the legitimate government of China, and he won congressional approval of the Formosa Resolution. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Eisenhower signs the legislation that changes Armistice Day to Veterans Day, June 1, 1954.\n![](image)President John F.

Eisenhower looked to moderation and cooperation as a means of governance, which he dubbed \"The Middle Way\".[327][328]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 1943, a visiting politician had suggested to Eisenhower that he might become President of the United States after the war. Believing that a general should not participate in politics, Merlo J. Pusey wrote that \"figuratively speaking, [Eisenhower] kicked his political-minded visitor out of his office\". As others asked him about his political future, Eisenhower told one that he could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job \"from dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe\", and another that he could not serve as Army Chief of Staff if others believed he had political ambitions. In 1945, Truman told Eisenhower during the Potsdam Conference that if desired, the president would help the general win the 1948 election,[113] and in 1947 he offered to run as Eisenhower's running mate on the Democratic ticket if MacArthur won the Republican nomination.[114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* \"And I don't care what it is\", phrase by Eisenhower, 1952, on religion\n* Atoms for Peace, a speech to the UN General Assembly in December 1953\n* Committee on Scientists and Engineers\n* Eisenhower baseball controversy\n* Eisenhower dollar\n* Eisenhower method for time management\n* Eisenhower National Historic Site\n* Eisenhower on U.S. postage stamps\n* Eisenhower Presidential Center\n* *Ike: Countdown to D-Day*\u00a0\u2013 a 2004 American television film about the decisions Eisenhower made as Supreme Commander that led to the successful D-Day invasion of World War II\n* Pact of Madrid\n* People to People Student Ambassador Program\n* *Pressure*\u00a0\u2013 a 2014 British play on Eisenhower's part in the meteorological decisions leading up to D-Day; he was played in the premiere production by Malcolm Sinclair\n* Kay Summersby\n\n\n**General**:\n\n\n\n* Historical rankings of presidents of the United States\n* History of the United States (1945\u20131964)\n* List of presidents of the United States by previous experience\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPresident of the United States from 1953 to 1961\n\n\"Dwight David Eisenhower\" and \"Eisenhower\" redirect here.

He was assigned to the American Battle Monuments Commission directed by General Pershing, and with the help of his brother Milton Eisenhower, then a journalist at the U.S. Agriculture Department, he produced a guide to American battlefields in Europe.[64] He then was assigned to the Army War College and graduated in 1928. After a one-year assignment in France, Eisenhower served as executive officer to General George V. Moseley, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to February 1933.[65] Major Dwight D.

Indeed, the convoy averaged only 5 miles per hour (8.0\u00a0km/h) from Washington, D.C. to San Francisco; later the improvement of highways became a signature issue for Eisenhower as president.[58]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Books | * *Crusade in Europe* (1948)\n |\n| Elections | * Draft Eisenhower movement\n* Republican Party presidential primaries (1948\n* 1952\n* 1956)\n* Republican National Convention (1952\n* 1956)\n* United States Presidential election (1952\n* 1956)\n |\n| Legacy | * Bibliography\n* Birthplace\n* Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum, gravesite\n\t+ Boyhood home\n* Eisenhower National Historic Site\n* Dwight D.

Meanwhile, Eisenhower had become the Republican Party nominee for president of the United States, a contest that he won on November 4. Eisenhower tendered his resignation as university president on November 15, 1952, effective January 19, 1953, the day before his inauguration.[137]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Eisenhower speaks to the press at the 1964 Republican National Convention\n![](image)President Lyndon Johnson with Eisenhower aboard Air Force One in October 1965\n![](image)Eisenhower with President Richard Nixon in February 1969, less than two months before Eisenhower's death\n![](image)Eisenhower's funeral service\n![](image)Graves of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Doud Dwight \"Icky\" Eisenhower and Mamie Eisenhower in Abilene, Kansas\nFollowing the presidency, Eisenhower moved to the place where he and Mamie had spent much of their post-war time, a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, 70 miles (110\u00a0km) from his ancestral home in Elizabethville, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania.[305][306] They also maintained a retirement home in Palm Desert, California.[307]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEisenhower initially planned on serving only one term, but he remained flexible in case leading Republicans wanted him to run again. He was recovering from a heart attack late in September 1955 when he met with his closest advisors to evaluate the GOP's potential candidates; the group concluded that a second term was well advised, and he announced that he would run again in February 1956.[163][164] Eisenhower was publicly noncommittal about having Nixon as the Vice President on his ticket; the question was an especially important one in light of his heart condition. He personally favored Robert B. Anderson, a Democrat who rejected his offer, so Eisenhower resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the party.[165] In 1956, Eisenhower faced Adlai Stevenson again and won by an even larger landslide, with 457 of 531 electoral votes and 57.6-percent of the popular vote. The level of campaigning was curtailed out of health considerations.[166]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInvited by Boles\u0142aw Bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration, he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city.[111] However, by mid-1947, as east\u2013west tensions over economic recovery in Germany and the Greek Civil War escalated, Eisenhower agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion.[110]\n\n\nAccording to historian Daniel Immerwahr, Eisenhower was the first Army Chief of Staff in the history of the post who did not serve in the Philippine\u2013American War.[112]\n\n\n\n### 1948 presidential election[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhittaker was unsuited for the role and soon retired (in 1962, after Eisenhower's presidency had ended). Stewart and Harlan were conservative Republicans, while Brennan was a Democrat who became a leading voice for liberalism.[282] In selecting a Chief Justice, Eisenhower looked for an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as law-and-order conservatives, noting privately that Warren \"represents the kind of political, economic, and social thinking that I believe we need on the Supreme Court\u00a0... He has a national name for integrity, uprightness, and courage that, again, I believe we need on the Court\".[283]\n\n\n\n### States admitted to the Union[edit]\n\n\nTwo states were admitted to the Union during Eisenhower's presidency.\n\n\n\n* Alaska\u00a0\u2013 January 3, 1959 (49th state)\n* Hawaii\u00a0\u2013 August 21, 1959 (50th state)\n\n\n### Health issues[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)1952 electoral vote results\nEisenhower insisted on campaigning in the South in the general election, against the advice of his campaign team, refusing to surrender the region to the Democratic Party. The campaign strategy was dubbed \"K1C2\" and was intended to focus on attacking the Truman administration on three failures: the Korean War, Communism, and corruption.[144]\n\n\nTwo controversies tested him and his staff during the campaign, but they did not damage the campaign. One involved a report that Nixon had improperly received funds from a secret trust. Nixon spoke out adroitly to avoid potential damage, but the matter permanently alienated the two candidates. The second issue centered on Eisenhower's relented decision to confront the controversial methods of Joseph McCarthy on his home turf in a Wisconsin appearance.[145] Eisenhower condemned \"wickedness in government\", an allusion to gay government employees who were conflated with communism during McCarthyism.[146]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** Ambrose 1983, p.\u00a062\n54. **^** Ambrose 1983, p.\u00a063\n55. **^** Ambrose 1983, p.\u00a065\n56. **^** \"Dwight David Eisenhower\". *MilitaryTimes.com*.

Eisenhower.[8] His mother soon reversed his two forenames after his birth to avoid the confusion of having two Davids in the family.[9] He was named Dwight after the famous evangelist Dwight L. Moody.[10] All of the boys were nicknamed \"Ike\", such as \"Big Ike\" (Edgar) and \"Little Ike\" (Dwight); the nickname was intended as an abbreviation of their last name.[11] By World War II, only Dwight was still called \"Ike\".[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1948, Eisenhower became President of Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa.[116] The choice was subsequently characterized as not having been a good fit for either party.[117] During that year, Eisenhower's memoir, *Crusade in Europe*, was published.[118] It was a major financial success.[119] Eisenhower sought the advice of Augusta National's Roberts about the tax implications of this,[119] and in due course Eisenhower's profit on the book was substantially aided by what author David Pietrusza calls \"a ruling without precedent\" by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. It held that Eisenhower was not a professional writer, but rather, marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences, and thus he had to pay only capital gains tax on his $635,000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate. This ruling saved Eisenhower about $400,000.[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn the domestic front, Eisenhower governed as a moderate conservative who continued New Deal agencies and expanded Social Security. He covertly opposed Joseph McCarthy and contributed to the end of McCarthyism by openly invoking executive privilege. He signed the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and sent Army troops to enforce federal court orders which integrated schools in Little Rock, Arkansas. His administration undertook the development and construction of the Interstate Highway System, which remains the largest construction of roadways in American history. In 1957, following the Soviet launch of Sputnik, Eisenhower led the American response which included the creation of NASA and the establishment of a stronger, science-based education via the National Defense Education Act. Following the establishment of NASA, the Soviet Union began to reinforce their own space program, escalating the Space Race. His two terms saw unprecedented economic prosperity except for a minor recession in 1958. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| General of the Army\nDwight D.

His campaign was noted for the simple slogan \"I Like Ike\". It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt's policy at the Yalta Conference and to Truman's policies in Korea and China\u2014matters in which he had once participated.[141][142] In defeating Taft for the nomination, it became necessary for Eisenhower to appease the right-wing Old Guard of the Republican Party; his selection of Richard Nixon as the vice-president on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose. Nixon also provided a strong anti-communist reputation, as well as youth to counter Eisenhower's more advanced age.[143]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the president of Columbia, Eisenhower gave voice to his opinions about the supremacy and difficulties of American democracy. His tenure marked his transformation from military to civilian leadership. His biographer Travis Beal Jacobs also suggested that the alienation of the Columbia faculty contributed to sharp intellectual criticism of him for many years.[134]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)1956 electoral vote results\nThe United States presidential election of 1956 was held on November 6, 1956. Eisenhower, the popular incumbent, successfully ran for re-election. The election was a re-match of 1952, as his opponent in 1956 was Stevenson, a former Illinois governor, whom Eisenhower had defeated four years earlier. Compared to the 1952 election, Eisenhower gained Kentucky, Louisiana, and West Virginia from Stevenson, while losing Missouri. His voters were less likely to bring up his leadership record. Instead what stood out this time, \"was the response to personal qualities\u2014 to his sincerity, his integrity and sense of duty, his virtue as a family man, his religious devotion, and his sheer likeableness.\"[150]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1953\u20131961)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Dwight D.

Eisenhower in 1952 and Richard Nixon in 1960.[86] When Reagan was contracted by General Electric (GE), he gave speeches to their employees. His speeches had a positive take on free markets.[87] Under GE vice president Lemuel Boulware, a staunch anti-communist,[88] employees were encouraged to vote for business-friendly politicians.[89]\n\n\nIn 1961, Reagan adapted his speeches into another speech to criticize Medicare.[90] In his view, its legislation would have meant \"the end of individual freedom in the United States\".[91] In 1962, Reagan was dropped by GE,[92] and he formally registered as a Republican.[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nReagan led a new conservative movement, altering the political dynamic of the United States.[403] Conservatism became the dominant ideology for Republicans, displacing the party's faction of liberals and moderates.[404] In his time, men began voting more Republican, and women began voting more Democrat \u2013 a gender distinction that has persisted.[403] He was supported by young voters, an allegiance that shifted many of them to the party.[405] He attempted to appeal to black voters in 1980,[406] but would receive the lowest black vote for a Republican presidential candidate at the time.[407] Throughout Reagan's presidency, Republicans were unable to gain complete control of Congress.[408]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nReagan began as a Democrat, viewing Franklin D. Roosevelt as \"a true hero\".[80] He joined the American Veterans Committee and Hollywood Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions (HICCASP), worked with the AFL\u2013CIO to fight right-to-work laws,[81] and continued to speak out against racism when he was in Hollywood.[82] In 1945, Reagan planned to lead an HICCASP anti-nuclear rally, but Warner Bros. prevented him from going.[83] In 1946, he appeared in a radio program called *Operation Terror* to speak out against rising Ku Klux Klan activity in the country, citing the attacks as a \"capably organized systematic campaign of fascist violence and intimidation and horror\".[84] Reagan also supported Harry S. Truman in the 1948 presidential election[85] and Helen Gahagan Douglas for the United States Senate in 1950. It was Reagan's belief that communism was a powerful backstage influence in Hollywood that led him to rally his friends against them.[81]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Ronald Reagan\n |\n| --- |\n| ![Reagan's presidential portrait, 1981](image)Official portrait, 1981\n |\n|  |\n| 40th President of the United States |\n| **In office**January 20, 1981\u00a0\u2013 January 20, 1989 |\n| Vice President | George H.

In 1937, he moved to California, and became a well-known film actor there. From 1947 to 1952, Reagan served as the president of the Screen Actors Guild. During the 1950s, he worked in television and spoke for General Electric. From 1959 to 1960, he again served as the Screen Actors Guild's president. In 1964, \"A Time for Choosing\" gave Reagan attention as a new conservative figure. He was elected governor of California in 1966. During his governorship, he raised taxes, turned the state budget deficit into a surplus, and cracked down harshly on university protests. After challenging and losing to incumbent president Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican presidential primaries, Reagan won the Republican nomination and then a landslide victory over incumbent Democratic president Jimmy Carter in the 1980 United States presidential election.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn January 1966, Reagan announced his candidacy for the California governorship,[97] repeating his stances on individual freedom and big government.[98] When he met with black Republicans in March,[99] he was criticized for opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Certain in his own lack of prejudice, Reagan responded resentfully that bigotry was not in his nature[100] and later argued that certain provisions of the act infringed upon the rights of property owners.[101] After the Supreme Court of California ruled that the initiative that repealed the Rumford Act was unconstitutional in May, he voiced his support for the act's repeal,[102] but later preferred amending it.[103] In the Republican primary, Reagan defeated George Christopher,[104] a moderate[105] who William F. Buckley Jr. thought had painted Reagan as extreme.[98]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThough most conservative leaders espoused cutting taxes and budget deficits, many conservatives focused more closely on social issues like abortion and homosexuality.[178] Evangelical Protestants became an increasingly important voting bloc, and they generally supported Reagan.[179] Reagan also won the backing of Reagan Democrats.[180] Though he advocated socially conservative view points, Reagan focused much of his campaign on attacks against Carter's foreign policy.[181]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nReagan did not run for the governorship in 1974 and it was won by Pat Brown's son, Jerry.[131] Reagan's governorship, as professor Gary K. Clabaugh writes, saw public schools deteriorate due to his opposition to additional basic education funding.[132] As for higher education, journalist William Trombley believed that the budget cuts Reagan enacted damaged Berkeley's student-faculty ratio and research.[133] Additionally, the homicide rate doubled and armed robbery rates rose as well during Reagan's eight years, even with the many laws Reagan signed to try toughening criminal sentencing and reforming the criminal justice system.[134] Reagan strongly supported capital punishment, but his efforts to enforce it were thwarted by *People v. Anderson* in 1972.[135] According to his son, Michael, Reagan said that he regretted signing the Family Law Act that granted no-fault divorces.[136]\n\n\n\n## 1975\u20131981: Seeking the presidency[edit]\n\n\n### 1976 Republican primaries[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n404. **^** Smith, Robert C.

In 1920, they settled in Dixon, Illinois,[17] living in a house near the H. C. Pitney Variety Store Building.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nReagan's general election opponent, incumbent governor Pat Brown, attempted to label Reagan as an extremist and tout his own accomplishments.[106] Reagan portrayed himself as a political outsider,[107] and charged Brown as responsible for the Watts riots and lenient on crime.[106] In numerous speeches, Reagan \"hit the Brown administration about high taxes, uncontrolled spending, the radicals at the University of California, Berkeley, and the need for accountability in government\".[108] Meanwhile, many in the press perceived Reagan as \"monumentally ignorant of state issues\", though Lou Cannon said that Reagan benefited from an appearance he and Brown made on *Meet the Press* in September.[109] Ultimately, Reagan won the governorship with 57 percent of the vote compared to Brown's 42 percent.[110]\n\n\n\n## 1967\u20131975: California governorship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Governorship of Ronald Reagan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPolicies\n* Domestic\n\t+ Reaganomics\n* Foreign\n\t+ Reagan Doctrine\n\t+ international trips\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nJudicial appointments\n* Supreme Court candidates\n\t+ O'Connor\n\t+ Rehnquist\n\t+ Scalia\n\t+ Bork\n\t+ Ginsburg\n\t+ Kennedy\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nPresidential campaigns\n* 1968\n\t+ primaries\n\t+ convention\n* 1976\n\t+ primaries\n\t+ convention\n* 1980\n\t+ election\n\t+ primaries\n\t+ convention\n\t+ debates\n* 1984\n\t+ election\n\t+ primaries\n\t+ convention\n\t+ debates\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nLegacy\n* Library\n* Accolades\n* Eponyms\n* Depictions\n\t+ music\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n![Seal of the President of the United States](image)\n\n![](image) |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n**Ronald Wilson Reagan** (/\u02c8re\u026a\u0261\u0259n/ *RAY-g\u0259n*; February 6, 1911\u00a0\u2013 June 5, 2004) was an American politician and actor who served as the 40th president of the United States from 1981 to 1989. A member of the Republican Party, his presidency constituted the Reagan era, and he is considered one of the most prominent conservative figures in American history.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2008, British historian M. J. Heale summarized that scholars had reached a broad consensus in which \"Reagan rehabilitated conservatism, turned the country to the right, practiced a 'pragmatic conservatism' that balanced ideology with the constraints of government, revived faith in the presidency and American self-respect, and contributed to critically ending the Cold War\",[382] which ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.[383] Many conservative and liberal scholars have agreed that Reagan has been the most influential president since Roosevelt, leaving his imprint on American politics, diplomacy, culture, and economics through his effective communication of his conservative agenda and pragmatic compromising.[384] During the initial years of Reagan's post-presidency, historical rankings placed his presidency in the twenties.[385] Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, his presidency was often placed in the top ten.[386][387]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nReagan replied, \"There you go again\", though the audience laughed and viewers found him more appealing.[187] Reagan later asked the audience if they were better off than they were four years ago, slightly paraphrasing Roosevelt's words in 1934.[188] In 1983, Reagan's campaign managers were revealed to having obtained Carter's debate briefing book before the debates.[189] On November 4, 1980, Reagan won in a decisive victory in the Electoral College over Carter, carrying 44 states and receiving 489 electoral votes to Carter's 49 in six states and the District of Columbia. He won the popular vote by a narrower margin, receiving nearly 51 percent to Carter's 41 percent and Anderson's 7 percent. In the United States Congress, Republicans won a majority of seats in the Senate for the first time since 1952[190] while Democrats retained the House of Representatives.[191]\n\n\n\n## 1981\u20131989: Presidency[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Ronald Reagan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPresident of the United States from 1981 to 1989\n\n\"Reagan\" redirects here.

Joseph Crespino argues that the visit was designed to reach out to Wallace-inclined voters,[182] and some also saw these actions as an extension of the Southern strategy to garner white support for Republican candidates.[183] Reagan's supporters have said that this was his typical anti-big government rhetoric, without racial context or intent.[184][185][186] In the October 28 debate, Carter chided Reagan for being against national health insurance. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInsufficiently conservative to Reagan[137] and many other Republicans,[138] president Gerald Ford suffered from multiple political and economic woes. Ford, running for president, was disappointed to hear him also run.[139] Reagan was strongly critical of d\u00e9tente and Ford's policy of d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union.[140] He repeated \"A Time for Choosing\" around the country[141] before announcing his campaign on November 20, 1975, when he discussed economic and social problems, and to a lesser extent, foreign affairs.[142] Both candidates were determined to knock each other out early in the primaries,[143] but Reagan would devastatingly lose the first five primaries beginning with New Hampshire,[144] where he popularized the welfare queen narrative about Linda Taylor, exaggerating her misuse of welfare benefits and igniting voter resentment for welfare reform,[145] but never overtly mentioning her name or race.[146]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n373. **^** https://qz.com/1217254/video-ronald-reagan-on-the-difference-between-military-rifles-and-self-defense\n374. **^** https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/03/02/before-trump-defied-the-nra-ronald-reagan-took-on-the-gun-lobby/\n375. **^** Davis, Janel (February 5, 2013). \"Did Reagan support an assault-weapons ban?\".

In 1991, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library opened. Reagan also addressed the 1992 Republican National Convention \"to inspire allegiance to the party regulars\";[362] publicly favored the Brady Bill, drawing criticism from gun control opponents;[363] a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget; and the repeal of the 22nd Amendment. His final public speech occurred on February 3, 1994, during a tribute to him in Washington, D.C.; his last major public appearance was at the funeral of Richard Nixon on April 27, 1994.[362]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen Robert Montgomery resigned as president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) on March 10, 1947, Reagan was elected to that position, in a special election.[51] Reagan's first tenure saw various labor-management disputes,[52] the Hollywood blacklist,[53] and the Taft\u2013Hartley Act's implementation.[54] On April 10, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) interviewed Reagan and he provided them with the names of actors whom he believed to be communist sympathizers.[55] During a House Un-American Activities Committee hearing, Reagan testified that some guild members were associated with the Communist Party[56] and that he was well-informed on a \"jurisdictional strike\".[57] When asked if he was aware of communist efforts within the Screen Writers Guild, he called the efforts \"hearsay\".[58] Reagan would remain SAG president until he resigned on November 10, 1952;[59] Walter Pidgeon succeeded him, but Reagan stayed on the board.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nReagan emerged as a vocal critic of President Carter in 1977. The Panama Canal Treaty's signing, the 1979 oil crisis, and rise in the inflation, interest and unemployment rates helped set up his 1980 presidential campaign,[159] which he announced on November 13, 1979[160] with an indictment of the federal government.[161] His announcement stressed his fundamental principles of tax cuts to stimulate the economy and having both a small government and a strong national defense,[162] since he believed the United States was behind the Soviet Union militarily.[163] Heading into 1980, his age became an issue among the press, and the United States was in a severe recession.[164] In the primaries, Reagan unexpectedly lost the Iowa caucus to George H. W. Bush. Three days before the New Hampshire primary, the Reagan and Bush campaigns agreed to a one-on-one debate sponsored by *The Telegraph* at Nashua, New Hampshire, but hours before the debate, the Reagan campaign invited other candidates including Bob Dole, John B. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Reimler, John (1999). \"The Rebirth of Racism in Education: The Real Legacy of the Reagan Revolution\". *Journal of Thought*. **34** (2): 31\u201340.

Reagan won an upset victory, convincing party delegates that Ford's nomination was no longer guaranteed.[150] Reagan won subsequent victories in Texas, Alabama, Georgia, and Indiana with his attacks on social programs, opposition to forced busing, increased support from inclined voters of a declining George Wallace presidential campaign,[151] and repeated criticisms of Ford and Kissinger's policies, including d\u00e9tente.[152]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt the time, his parents' stance on racial questions were unusually progressive in Dixon.[26] Reagan himself had grown up with very few black Americans there and was unaware of a race problem.[27]\n\n\n\n## Entertainment career[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Ronald Reagan filmography\n\n### Radio and film[edit]\n\n\n![A frame of Ronald Reagan in the 1939 film Dark Victory](image)\n*Dark Victory* (1939)\n![A frame of Reagan in the 1941 film The Bad Man](image)\n*The Bad Man* (1941)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring his victorious reelection campaign in 1970, Reagan, remaining critical of government, promised to prioritize welfare reform.[127] He was concerned that the programs were disincentivizing work and that the growing welfare rolls would lead to both an unbalanced budget and another big tax hike in 1972.[128] At the same time, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates to combat inflation, putting the American economy in a mild recession. Reagan worked with Bob Moretti to tighten up the eligibility requirements so that the financially needy could continue receiving payments. This was only accomplished after Reagan softened his criticism of Nixon's Family Assistance Plan. Nixon then lifted regulations to shepherd California's experiment.[129] In 1976, the Employment Development Department published a report suggesting that the experiment that ran from 1971 to 1974 was unsuccessful.[130]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1964, Reagan gave a speech for presidential contender Barry Goldwater[93] that was eventually referred to as \"A Time for Choosing\".[94] Reagan argued that the Founding Fathers \"knew that governments don't control things. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose\"[95] and that \"We've been told increasingly that we must choose between left or right.\"[96] Even though the speech was not enough to turn around the faltering Goldwater campaign, it increased Reagan's profile among conservatives. David S. Broder and Stephen H. Hess called it \"the most successful national political debut since William Jennings Bryan electrified the 1896 Democratic convention with his famous 'Cross of Gold' address\".[93]\n\n\n\n### 1966 California gubernatorial election[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1966 California gubernatorial election\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nReagan advocated a *laissez-faire* philosophy,[195] and promoted a set of neoliberal reforms dubbed \"Reaganomics\", which included monetarism and supply-side economics.[196]\n\n\n\n#### Taxation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **is missing information** about analysis.

Reagan faced minimal opposition in the Republican primaries,[297] and he and Bush accepted the nomination at the Dallas convention in August.[298] In the general election, his campaign ran the commercial, \"Morning in America\".[299] At a time when the American economy was already recovering,[218] former vice president Walter Mondale[300] was attacked by Reagan's campaign as a \"tax-and-spend Democrat\", while Mondale criticized the deficit, the SDI, and Reagan's civil rights policy. However, Reagan's age induced his campaign managers to minimize his public appearances. Mondale's campaign believed that Reagan's age and mental health were issues before the October presidential debates.[301]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![The Reagans at an airport, 1972](image)The Reagans in 1972\nBrown had spent much of California's funds on new programs, prompting them to use accrual accounting to avoid raising taxes. Consequently, it generated a larger deficit,[111] and Reagan would call for reduced government spending and tax hikes to balance the budget.[112] He worked with Jesse M. Unruh on securing tax increases and promising future property tax cuts. This caused some conservatives to accuse Reagan of betraying his principles.[113] As a result, taxes on sales, banks, corporate profits, inheritances, liquor, and cigarettes jumped. Kevin Starr states, Reagan \"gave Californians the biggest tax hike in their history\u2014and got away with it.\"[114] In the 1970 gubernatorial election, Unruh used Reagan's tax policy against him, saying it disproportionally favored the wealthy. Reagan countered that he was still committed to reducing property taxes.[115] By 1973, the budget had a surplus, which Reagan preferred \"to give back to the people\".[116]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nReagan was known for storytelling and humor,[395] which involved puns[396] and self-deprecation.[397] Reagan also often emphasized family values, despite being the first president to have been divorced.[398] He showed the ability to comfort Americans during the aftermath of the Space Shuttle *Challenger* disaster.[399] Reagan's ability to talk about substantive issues with understandable terms and to focus on mainstream American concerns earned him the laudatory moniker the \"Great Communicator\".[400][395] He also earned the nickname \"Teflon President\" in that public perceptions of him were not substantially tarnished by the multitude of controversies that arose during his administration.[401][402]\n\n\n\n### Political influence[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nReagan left the presidency in 1989 with the American economy having seen a significant reduction of inflation, the unemployment rate having fallen, and the United States having entered its then-longest peacetime expansion. At the same time, the national debt had nearly tripled since 1981 as a result of his cuts in taxes and increased military spending, despite cuts to domestic discretionary spending. Reagan's policies also helped contribute to the end of the Cold War and the end of Soviet communism.[7] Alzheimer's disease hindered Reagan post-presidency, and his physical and mental capacities rapidly deteriorated, ultimately leading to his death in 2004. Historians and scholars have typically ranked him among the upper to middle tier of American presidents, and his post-presidential approval ratings by the general public are usually high.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCritics, for example Paul Krugman, note Reagan's tenure as having begun a period of increased income inequality, sometimes called the \"Great Divergence\". Krugman also views Reagan as having initiated the ideology of the current-day Republican Party, which he feels is led by \"radicals\" who seek to \"undo the twentieth century\" gains in income equality and unionization.[393] Others, such as Nixon's Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson, also criticize what they feel was not just Reagan's fiscal irresponsibility, but also ushering in an era where tax cutting \"became the GOP's core platform\". With resulting deficits and GOP leaders (speciously in Peterson's opinion) arguing supply-side gains would enable the country to \"grow\" its way out of deficits.[394]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nReagan addresses the nation on the Space Shuttle *Challenger* disasterRecorded January 28, 1986\n |\n| Other offices\n\n* 1968[5]\u20131969:[6] Chair of the Republican Governors Association\n |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This article is part of a series about\nRonald Reagan |\n\n |\n| \n\n---\n\n\nPersonal life\n* Filmography\n* Bibliography\n* Death\n* Residences\n\t+ Birthplace of Ronald Reagan\n\t+ Ronald Reagan Boyhood Home\n\t+ Rancho del Cielo\n\t+ 668 St. Cloud Road\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nSpeeches\n* A Time for Choosing\n* States' rights\n* Evil Empire\n* Tear down this wall!\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n33rd Governor of California\n* Elections\n\t+ 1966\n\t+ 1970\n* Governorship\n\t+ 1969 People's Park protest\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n40th President of the United States\n* Presidency\n\t+ timeline\n* Transition\n* Inaugurations\n* Polls\n* Scandals\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nTenure\n* Assassination attempt\n* Invasion of Grenada\n* Bombing of Libya\n* Iran\u2013Contra affair\n* AIDS\n* Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Reagan, Ronald (1990) [1989]. *Speaking My Mind: Selected Speeches*.

His first assignment was at Fort Mason as a liaison officer, a role that allowed him to transfer to the United States Army Air Forces (AAF). Reagan became an AAF public relations officer and was subsequently assigned to the 18th AAF Base Unit in Culver City[47] where he felt that it was \"impossible to remove an incompetent or lazy worker\" due to what he felt was \"the incompetence, the delays, and inefficiencies\" of the federal bureaucracy.[48] Despite this, Reagan participated in the Provisional Task Force Show Unit in Burbank[49] and continued to make theatrical films.[50] He was also ordered to temporary duty in New York City to participate in the sixth War Loan Drive before being reassigned to Fort MacArthur until his discharge on December 9, 1945, as a captain. Throughout his military service, Reagan produced over 400 training films.[49]\n\n\n\n### Screen Actors Guild presidency[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe period of American history most dominated by Reagan and his policies (particularly on taxes, welfare, defense, the federal judiciary, and the Cold War) is known as the Reagan era, which suggests that the \"Reagan Revolution\" had a lasting impact on the United States in domestic and foreign policy. The Bill Clinton administration is often treated as an extension of the era, as is the George W. Bush administration.[409] Since 1988, Republican presidential candidates have invoked Reagan's policies and beliefs.[410] Carlos Lozada noted Trump's praising of Reagan in a book he published during his 2016 campaign.[411]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: Ronald Reagan 1976 presidential campaign and 1976 Republican Party presidential primaries\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Since leaving office, Clinton has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention of HIV/AIDS and global warming. In 2009, he was named the United Nations special envoy to Haiti.

Ricks.[5] The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Failed congressional campaign and tenure as Attorney General of Arkansas[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Electoral history of Bill Clinton\n\nAfter graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in the conservative 3rd district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52\u00a0percent to 48\u00a0percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas attorney general. Defeating the secretary of state and the deputy attorney general in the Democratic primary, Clinton was elected with no opposition at all in the general election, as no Republican had run for the office.[45][12]\n\n\n\n## Governor of Arkansas (1979\u20131981, 1983\u20131992)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Governorships of Bill Clinton\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nClinton drew strong support from the African American community and insisted that the improvement of race relations would be a major theme of his presidency.[272] In 1998, Nobel laureate Toni Morrison called Clinton \"the first black president\", saying, \"Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas\".[273] Morrison noted that Clinton's sex life was scrutinized more than his career accomplishments, and she compared this to the stereotyping and double standards that, she said, blacks typically endure.[273] Many viewed this comparison as unfair and disparaging both to Clinton and to the African-American community.[274]\n\n\n\n## Sexual assault and misconduct allegations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bill Clinton sexual assault and misconduct allegations\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Twenty years ago, the Drudge Report broke the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal\". *The Washington Post*.

As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association.

He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and twice the length it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long[65] and poorly delivered.[66] Clinton presented himself both as a moderate and as a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.[52][67]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nClinton admitted to having extramarital affairs with singer Gennifer Flowers and Monica Lewinsky.[294] Actress Elizabeth Gracen,[295] Miss Arkansas winner Sally Perdue,[296] and Dolly Kyle Browning[297] all claimed that they had affairs with Clinton during his time as governor of Arkansas.

In his second term, his rating consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s.[249] After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, Clinton's rating reached its highest point.[250] According to a CBS News/*New York Times* poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68\u00a0percent, which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.[251] Clinton's average Gallup poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61 percent, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years.[252] Forty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.[252]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nClinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. The Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years in the 1994 elections, but Clinton was still comfortably re-elected president in 1996 against both Republican Bob Dole and Perot\u2014now the Reform Party nominee. Starting in the mid-1990s, he began an ideological evolution as he became much more conservative in his domestic policy, advocating for and signing the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, the State Children's Health Insurance Program and financial deregulation measures. He appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus\u2014the first such surplus since 1969. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Seymour Martin Lipset, the 1992 election had several unique characteristics. Voters felt that economic conditions were worse than they actually were, which harmed Bush. A rare event was the presence of a strong third-party candidate. Liberals launched a backlash against 12 years of a conservative White House. The chief factor was Clinton's uniting his party, and winning over a number of heterogeneous groups.[81]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1993\u20132001)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Bill Clinton\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Bill Clinton presidency.\n\nClinton's \"third way\" of moderate liberalism built up the nation's fiscal health and put the nation on a firm footing abroad amid globalization and the development of anti-American terrorist organizations.[82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Campbell, Colin, and Bert A.

A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the 46th governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)approve\ndisapprove\nunsure\nGallup/*USA Today* Bush public opinion polling from February 2001 to January 2009\nBush began his presidency with approval ratings near 60 percent.[342] After the September\u00a011 attacks, Bush gained an approval rating of 90 percent,[343] maintaining 80\u201390 percent approval for four months after the attacks. It remained over 50 percent during most of his first term[344] and then fell to as low as 19 percent in his second term.[345]\n\n\nIn 2000 and again in 2004, *Time* magazine named George W. Bush as its Person of the Year, a title awarded to someone who the editors believe \"has done the most to influence the events of the year\".[346] In May 2004, Gallup reported that 89 percent of the Republican electorate approved of Bush.[347] However, the support waned due mostly to a minority of Republicans' frustration with him on issues of spending, illegal immigration, and Middle Eastern affairs.[348]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)George W. Bush with his parents, Barbara and George H. W. Bush, c. 1947\nGeorge Walker Bush was born on July 6, 1946, at Grace-New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut.[1] He was the first child of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barbara Pierce. He was raised in Midland and Houston, Texas, with four siblings: Jeb, Neil, Marvin and Dorothy. Another younger sister, Robin, died from leukemia at the age of three in 1953.[2] His paternal grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a U.S. senator from Connecticut.[3] His father was Ronald Reagan's vice president from 1981 to 1989 and the 41st U.S. president from 1989 to 1993. Bush has English and German ancestry, along with more distant Dutch, Welsh, Irish, French, and Scottish roots.[4][*improper synthesis?*]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nBush attended public schools in Midland, Texas until the family moved to Houston after he had completed seventh grade. He then spent two years at The Kinkaid School, a college-preparatory school.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter finishing his second term, Bush returned to Texas, where he has maintained a low profile since leaving office. At various points in his presidency, he was among both the most popular and unpopular presidents in U.S. history. He received the highest recorded approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, but also one of the lowest such ratings during the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis. Although public opinion of Bush has improved since he left office, his presidency has generally been rated as below-average by scholars.\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Early life of George W. Bush\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)2004 electoral vote results\n![](image)George W. Bush re-election campaign stop in Grand Rapids, Michigan\nIn his 2004 bid for re-election, Bush commanded broad support in the Republican Party and did not encounter a primary challenge. He appointed Ken Mehlman as campaign manager, and Karl Rove devised a political strategy.[82] Bush and the Republican platform emphasized a strong commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,[83] support for the USA PATRIOT Act,[84] a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and same-sex marriage,[83][85] reforming Social Security to create private investment accounts,[83] creation of an ownership society,[83] and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls.[86] Bush also called for the implementation of a guest worker program for immigrants,[83] which was criticized by conservatives.[87]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1978 elections, Bush ran for the House of Representatives from Texas's 19th congressional district. The retiring member, George H. Mahon, had held the district for the Democratic Party since 1935. Bush's opponent, Kent Hance, portrayed him as out of touch with rural Texans, and Bush lost the election with 46.8 percent of the vote to Hance's 53.2 percent.[51]\n\n\nBush and his family moved to Washington, D.C., in 1988 to work on his father's campaign for the U.S. presidency.[52][53] He was a campaign advisor and liaison to the media, and assisted his father by campaigning across the country.[54] In December 1991, Bush was one of seven people named by his father to run his father's 1992 presidential re-election campaign as a campaign advisor.[55] The previous month, his father had asked him to tell White House chief of staff John H. Sununu to resign.[56]\n\n\n\n## Texas governorship (1995\u20132000)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Governorship of George W. Bush\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Milkis, Sidney M. and Jesse H.

After graduating from Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in the oil industry. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball before being elected governor of Texas in 1994. As governor, Bush successfully sponsored legislation for tort reform, increased education funding, set higher standards for schools, and reformed the criminal justice system. He also helped make Texas the United States' leading producer of wind-powered electricity. In the 2000 United States presidential election, he won over Democratic incumbent Vice President Al Gore, despite losing the popular vote after a narrow and contested Electoral College win that involved a Supreme Court decision to stop a recount in Florida.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** York, Byron (August 26, 2004). \"The Facts about Bush and the National Guard\". *National Review*.

Critics often point to his handling of the Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction after claiming they were in Iraq, as well as Bush's handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis, as proof that he was unfit to be president.[481][482][483] Ben Ferencz, former chief prosecutor for the United States Army at the Nuremberg Trials, has stated that Bush likely committed war crimes in relation to the Iraq War.[484][485][486]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n506. **^** \"George W.

He graduated from Columbia University in 1983 with a B.A. in political science and later worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the *Harvard Law Review*. He became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He also went into elective politics. Obama represented the 13th district in the Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he successfully ran for the U.S. Senate. In 2008, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president and chose Joe Biden as his running mate. Obama was elected president, defeating Republican nominee John McCain in the presidential election and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, a decision that drew a mixture of praise and criticism.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama stated he favored legalizing same-sex marriage.[242] During his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages.[243] In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating \"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.\"[244] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.[245][246] During his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013,[201] Obama became the first U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Slevin, Peter (November 13, 2007). \"For Obama, a handsome payoff in political gambles\". *The Washington Post*. p.\u00a0A3.

Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011.[75] In *Dreams from My Father*, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.
