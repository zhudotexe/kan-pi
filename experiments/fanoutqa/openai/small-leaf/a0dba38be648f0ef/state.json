In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1.

The presidency is a part of the system of people's congress based on the principle of unified power in which the National People's Congress (NPC) functions as the only branch of government and as the highest state organ of power. The presidency is a state organ of the NPC and equivalent to, for instance, the State Council and the National Supervisory Commission, rather than a political office, unlike the premier of the State Council. Together with the NPC Standing Committee, the presidency performs certain heads of state functions. The president can engage in state affairs with the consent of the NPC Standing Committee. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Constitution of the People's Republic of China\". *National People's Congress*.

But it is his position as the party's general secretary that indicates his top status.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn theory, the president has discretion over the selection of the premier, though in practice the premier has historically been selected through the top-level discussions of the Chinese Communist Party. Upon the nomination of the premier, the NPC convenes to confirm the nomination, but since only one name is on the ballot, it can only approve or reject. To date, it has never rejected a personnel nomination.[18] Since the premier, the head of government in China, is the most important political appointment in the Chinese government, the nomination power, under some circumstances, may give the president real political influence.[19]\n\n\nThe director of the Office of the President of the PRC (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u4e3b\u5e2d\u529e\u516c\u5ba4; pinyin: *Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3 Zh\u01d4x\u00ed B\u00e0ng\u014dngsh\u00ec*) is Cai Qi, who is also the director of the CCP General Office and the director of the CCP General Secretary Office.[20]\n\n\n\n## Political ranking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orders of precedence in China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on**Orders of succession** |\n| Presidencies |\n| * Argentina\n* Austria\n* Brazil\n* Colombia\n* China\n* DR Congo\n* Finland\n* France\n* Germany\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Ireland\n* Republic of Korea\n* Mexico\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Poland\n* Romania\n* Sri Lanka\n* Taiwan\n* United States\n* Uruguay\n* Vietnam\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n## Post title[edit]\n\n\nThe title of the office (Chinese: \u56fd\u5bb6\u4e3b\u5e2d; pinyin: *Gu\u00f3ji\u0101 Zh\u01d4x\u00ed*), which literally translates to \"state chairman\", was unchanged in the Chinese text, but a new English translation of \"President of the People's Republic of China\" has been adopted since 1982, instead of \"Chairman of the People's Republic of China\".[16]\n\n\n\n## Order of succession[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1990s, the experiment of separating party and state posts, which led to conflict between Deng Xiaoping and Zhao Ziyang during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, was terminated. In 1993, Jiang Zemin, who had been general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the Central Military Commission since 1989, assumed the presidency as well, becoming the undisputed top leader of the party and the state.[6][7] Jiang stepped down as president in 2003, handing the post to then\u2013Vice President Hu Jintao, the first vice president to assume the office. Hu had already become general secretary in 2002. In turn, Hu vacated both offices for Xi Jinping in 2012 and 2013, who had also previously served as vice president under Hu.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe political ranking of the presidency has changed throughout the decades, influenced by the officeholder of the time. 2nd President Liu Shaoqi was also the first-ranked vice chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, and ranked second in the Chinese Communist Party, behind CCP Chairman Mao Zedong.[21] President Li Xiannian was also the 5th ranked member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, after the CCP general secretary and Chinese premier.[22] President Yang Shangkun was not a member of CCP Politburo Standing Committee, but he ranked third after CCP General Secretary Zhao Ziyang/Jiang Zemin and CMC Chairman Deng Xiaoping.[23] Since Jiang Zemin's accession to the office in 1993, the president has also the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, ranking first in party and state.[24]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile the presidency is not a powerful organ in itself, since 27 March 1993, the president has concurrently served as general secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and chairman of the Central Military Commission, making the incumbent China's paramount leader and commander-in-chief.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nState representative of China\n\nFor the president of the Republic of China, commonly known as Taiwan, see President of the Republic of China.

It was replaced in Constitution in 1954 with the office of state chairman. It was successively held by Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi. Liu fell into political disgrace during the Cultural Revolution, after which the presidency became vacant. The post of chairman was abolished under the Constitution of 1975, and the function of state representative was bestowed on the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee. The office was reinstated in the Constitution of 1982 but with reduced powers. Since 1982, the title's official English-language translation has been \"president\", although the Chinese title remains unchanged.[note 1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 1981052929 May 1981\n | 32,26388 years, 122 days\n |\n| Presidency abolished\n |\n| 3\n | Xiannian, LiLi Xiannian | 1909062323 June 1909(23 June 1909) | 73 36073 years, 360 days\n | 04 2954 years, 295 days\n | 78 29078 years, 290 days\n | 1992062121 June 1992\n | 30,31482 years, 364 days\n |\n| 4\n | Shangkun, YangYang Shangkun | 190708033 August 1907(3 August 1907) | 80 25080 years, 250 days\n | 04 3524 years, 352 days\n | 85 23685 years, 236 days\n | 1998091414 September 1998\n | 33,28091 years, 42 days\n |\n| 5\n | Zemin, JiangJiang Zemin | 1926081717 August 1926(17 August 1926) | 66 22266 years, 222 days\n | 09 3539 years, 353 days\n | 76 21076 years, 210 days\n | 2022113030 November 2022\n | 35,16996 years, 105 days\n |\n| 6\n | Jintao, HuHu Jintao | 1942122121 December 1942(21 December 1942) | 60 08460 years, 84 days\n | 09 3649 years, 365 days\n | 70 08470 years, 84 days\n | Living\n | 29,76081\u00a0years, 175\u00a0days (Living)\n |\n| 7\n | Jinping, XiXi Jinping | 1953061515 June 1953(15 June 1953) | 59 years, 272 days\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Powers and duties[edit]\n\n\nThe president functions as the state representative of the PRC as well as the supreme representative of China both internally and externally.[14] According to the constitution, the presidency is not a position but a state institution that represents the PRC in state activities, but the presidency is served by one person.[4][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| #\n | President\n | Date of birth\n | Age at ascension(first term) | Time in office(total) | Age at retirement(last term) | Date of death\n | Longevity\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Zedong, MaoMao Zedong | 1893122626 December 1893(26 December 1893) | 60 27560 years, 275 days\n | 04 2124 years, 212 days\n | 64 12264 years, 122 days\n | 197609099 September 1976\n | 30,20782 years, 258 days\n |\n| 2\n | Shaoqi, LiuLiu Shaoqi | 1898112424 November 1898(24 November 1898) | 60 15460 years, 154 days\n | 09 1879 years, 187 days\n | 69 34269 years, 342 days\n | 1969111212 November 1969\n | 25,92070 years, 353 days\n |\n| Presidency vacant\n |\n| *acting* | Biwu, DongDong Biwu | 188603055 March 1886(5 March 1886) | 85 35685 years, 356 days\n | 02 3272 years, 327 days\n | 88 31888 years, 318 days\n | 197504022 April 1975\n | 32,53489 years, 28 days\n |\n| *Hon.* | Ching-ling, SoongSoong Ching-ling | 1893012727 January 1893(27 January 1893) | 83 16188 years, 109 days\n | 01 242Honorary[26][27] | \u2013\n85 037\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe constitution also mandated term limits for the office, stipulating the president and vice president could not serve more than two consecutive terms.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe posts of the premier, president and CCP general secretary were held by different individuals in the 1980s. That said, in reality political power was concentrated on Deng Xiaoping, effectively the paramount leader, who controlled the Party, government and the military from \"behind the scenes\" without holding any of the three posts. However, presidents Li Xiannian (1983\u20131988) and Yang Shangkun (1988\u20131993) were not simple figureheads, but actually significant players in the highest leadership. They derived most of their power from being amongst the Eight Elders, rather than the office of president.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Mao era, there were no term limits for the presidency. Between 1982 and 2018, the constitution stipulated that the president could not serve more than two consecutive terms. In 2018, term limits were abolished in order to align the presidency with the position of CCP general secretary, which does not have term limits. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Establishment in 1954[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder the current constitution, instated in 1982 with minor revisions in later years, the president has the power to promulgate laws, select and dismiss the premier (head of government), vice premiers, state councilors as well as ministers of the State Council, grant presidential pardons, declare states of emergency, issue mass mobilization orders, and issue state honors. In addition, the president names and dismisses ambassadors to foreign countries, and signs and annuls treaties with foreign entities. According to the Constitution, all of these powers require the approval or confirmation of the National People's Congress (NPC),[11][*non-primary source needed*] which the office is subject to.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen it was agreed to amend the constitution again in 1980, questions to whether to restore the presidency arose. Research showed that having the NPCSC chairman as the national representative created problems, as the position was equivalent to the speaker of parliament in other countries. Deng Xiaoping agreed to restore the presidency, but without powers in specific government affairs.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![National Emblem of the People's Republic of China](image) Central state organs of the People's Republic of China\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  | National People's Congress |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  | NPC Standing Committee |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | President |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  | State Council |  | Central Military Commission |  | National Supervisory Commission |  | Supreme People's Court |  | Supreme People's Procuratorate |  |  |  |  |\n|\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCCP Chairman Mao Zedong was the first to hold the office of state chairman. He was elected at the founding session of the National People's Congress in 1954. At the 2nd NPC in 1959, Mao was succeeded by Liu Shaoqi, first-ranked Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. Liu was reelected as state chairman at the 3rd NPC in Jan 1965. However, in 1966, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution and by August 1966 Mao and his supporters succeeding in removing Liu from his position as party vice chairman. A few months later Liu was apparently placed under house arrest, and after a prolonged power struggle the 12th Plenum of the 8th Communist Party Congress stripped Liu Shaoqi of all his party and non-party positions on 31 October 1968, including the post of state chairman. This was in violation of the Constitution, which required a vote by the NPC to remove the state chairman.[*citation needed*] After Liu's removal in 1968, the office of state chairman was vacant. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPolitics of the People's Republic of China\n |\n| --- |\n| * Constitution\n* Laws\n* Ideology\n |\n| Communist Party | * Central Committee\n\t+ Politburo\n\t\t- Standing Committee\n\t\t\t* General Secretary\n\t\t- Secretariat\n\t+ Military Commission\n* Central Commission for Discipline Inspection\n\t+ Secretary\n* Provincial standing committees\n* Constitution\n | ![National emblem of the People's Republic of China](image)\n |\n| Centralgovernment | * Paramount leader\n* National People's Congress\n\t+ Standing Committee\n\t\t- Chairman\n* President\n\t+ Vice President\n* State Council\n\t+ Premier\n\t+ Vice-Premiers\n\t+ State Councilors\n\t+ Ministries\n* Central Military Commission\n\t+ Chairman\n\t+ People's Liberation Army\n\t+ People's Armed Police\n\t+ Militia\n* National Supervisory Commission\n* Supreme People's Court\n* Supreme People's Procuratorate\n |\n| United front | * Political Consultative Conference\n\t+ Chairperson\n\t+ Minor parties\n\t+ People's organization\n* United Front Work Department\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Politics ofprovince-leveldivisions(current leaders) | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Municipalities | * Beijing\n* Chongqing\n* Shanghai\n* Tianjin\n |\n| Provinces | * Anhui\n* Fujian\n* Gansu\n* Guangdong\n* Guizhou\n* Hainan\n* Hebei\n* Heilongjiang\n* Henan\n* Hubei\n* Hunan\n* Jiangsu\n* Jiangxi\n* Jilin\n* Liaoning\n* Qinghai\n* Shaanxi\n* Shandong\n* Shanxi\n* Sichuan\n* Yunnan\n* Zhejiang\n |\n| Autonomousregions | * Guangxi\n* Inner Mongolia\n* Ningxia\n* Xinjiang\n* Tibet (leaders)\n |\n| SARs | * Hong Kong\n* Macau\n |\n| Claimed province | * Taiwan\n |\n\n |\n| See also\nElections\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHeads of state and government of Asia\n |\n| --- |\n| Headsof state | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe president also conducts state visits on behalf of the People's Republic.[note 2] Under the constitution, the \"state visit\" clause is the only presidential power that does not stipulate any form of oversight from the NPC. As the vast majority of presidential powers are dependent on the ratification of the NPC, the president is, in essence, a symbolic post without any direct say in the governance of state.

The president summons both the houses (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) of the parliament and prorogues them.

The process may start in either of the two houses of the parliament. The house initiates the process by levelling the charges against the president. The charges are contained in a notice that has to be signed by at least one-quarter of the total members of that house. The notice is sent up to the president and 14 days later, it is taken up for consideration.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe president should take moral responsibility when an ordinance elapses automatically or is not approved by the parliament or violates the constitution.[16] Thus, it is believed that the POI is the de jure head of the state, whereas PM is the de facto head.\n\n\n\n### Executive powers[edit]\n\n\n\n> The President of the Indian Union will be generally bound by the advice of his Ministers. ...

On 11 September 2008, the Government of India increased the salary of the president to \u20b91.5 lakh (equivalent to \u20b94.2 lakh or US$5,000 in 2023). This amount was further increased to \u20b95 lakh (equivalent to \u20b96.7 lakh or US$8,000 in 2023) in the 2018 Union budget of India. However, almost everything that the president does or wants to do is taken care of by an annual \u20b9225 million (equivalent to \u20b9630\u00a0million or US$7.5\u00a0million in 2023) budget that the Government allots for their upkeep.[52] Rashtrapati Bhavan, the president's official residence, is the largest Presidential palace in the world.[53][54] The Rashtrapati Nilayam at Bolarum, Hyderabad and Retreat Building at Chharabra, Shimla are the official Retreat Residences of the president of India. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The current vice-president\n* The governor of any state\n* A Minister of the Union or of any state (including prime minister and chief ministers)[20]:\u200a72\n\n\nIn the event that the vice-president, a state governor or a minister is elected president, they are considered to have vacated their previous office on the date they begin serving as president.\n\n\nA member of parliament or a State Legislature can seek election to the office of the president but if they are elected as president, they shall be deemed to have vacated their seat in parliament or State Legislature on the date on which they enter upon their office as President **[Article 59(1)]**.\n\n\n**Article 57** provides that a person who holds, or who has held, office as president shall, subject to the other provisions of this constitution, be eligible for re-election to that office.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs per Article 142, it is the duty of the president to enforce the decrees of the supreme court.\n\n\n\n### Judicial powers[edit]\n\n\nThe primary duty of the president is to preserve, protect and defend the constitution and the law of India per Article 60. The president appoints the Chief Justice of India and other judges on the advice of the chief justice. The President may dismiss a judge with a two-thirds vote of the two Houses of the parliament.[18]\n\n\nThe Indian government's chief legal adviser, Attorney General of India, is appointed by the president of India under Article 76(1) and holds office during the pleasure of the president. If the president considers a question of law or a matter of public importance has arisen, they can also ask for the advisory opinion of the supreme court per Article 143. Per Article 88, the president can ask the attorney general to attend the parliamentary proceedings and report to him any unlawful functioning if any.[19]\n\n\n\n### Appointment powers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe president can reduce the salaries of all government officials, including judges of the supreme court and high courts, in cases of a financial emergency. All money bills passed by state legislatures are submitted to the president for approval. They can direct the state to observe certain principles (economy measures) relating to financial matters.[43]\n\n\n\n## Selection process[edit]\n\n\n### Eligibility[edit]\n\n\nArticle 58 of the constitution sets the principal qualifications one must meet to be eligible to the office of the president. A president must be:\n\n\n\n* a citizen of India\n* of 35 years of age or above\n* qualified to become a member of the Lok Sabha\n\n\nA person shall not be eligible for election as president if they hold any office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State or any local or other authority subject to the control of any of the said Governments.\n\n\nCertain office-holders, however, are permitted to stand as presidential candidates. These are:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe nomination of a candidate for election to the office of the president must be subscribed by at least 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders. Each candidate has to make a security deposit of \u20b915,000 (US$180) in the Reserve Bank of India.[46] The security deposit is liable to be forfeited in case the candidate fails to secure one-sixth of the votes polled.\n\n\nThe election is held in accordance with the system of proportional representation (PR) by means of the instant-runoff voting (IRV) method.[47] The voting takes place by a secret ballot system. The manner of election of President is provided by Article 55 of the constitution.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe president is responsible for making a wide variety of appointments.

The president then appoints the other members of the Council of Ministers, distributing portfolios to them on the advice of the prime minister.[20]:\u200a72 The Council of Ministers remains in power at the 'pleasure' of the president.\n\n\nThe president appoints 12 members of the Rajya Sabha from amongst persons who have special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as literature, science, art and social service. The president may nominate not more than two members of Anglo Indian community as Lok Sabha members per Article 331, which was removed in 2019.\n\n\nGovernors of states are also appointed by the president who shall work at the pleasure of the president. Per Article 156, the president is empowered to dismiss a governor who has violated the constitution in their acts.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"President Approves New Protocol Practice\". *pib.gov.in*.

The president shall not accept any actions of the executive or legislature which are unconstitutional. The president is the foremost, most empowered and prompt defender of the constitution (Article 60), who has pre-emptive power for ensuring constitutionality in the actions of the executive or legislature. The role of the judiciary in upholding the Constitution of India is the second line of defence in nullifying any unconstitutional actions of the executive and legislative entities of the Indian Union.\n\n\n\n## Powers and duties[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAll international treaties and agreements are negotiated and concluded on behalf of the president.[26]:\u200a18 However, in practice, such negotiations are usually carried out by the prime minister along with their Cabinet (especially the Minister of External Affairs). Also, such treaties are subject to the approval of the parliament. The president represents India in international forums and affairs where such a function is chiefly ceremonial. The president may also send and receive diplomats, i.e. the officers from the Indian Foreign Service.[27]:\u200a143 The president is the first citizen of the country.[21]\n\n\n\n### Military powers[edit]\n\n\nThe president is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Armed Forces.

The veto was used in 1986 by President Zail Singh over the Postal Bill. The president did not give assent to the bill, arguing that its scope was too sweeping and would give the government arbitrary powers to intercept postal communications indiscriminately.[58][64][65]\n\n\n\n### Rashtrapati Bhavan Communiqu\u00e9s[edit]\n\n\nIn the late 1990s, President K.

When the president is unable to act because of absence, illness or any other cause, the vice-president discharges the president's functions until the president resumes the duties.\n\n\nA vice-president who acts as or discharges the functions of the president has all the powers and immunities of the president and is entitled to the same emoluments as the president. When a vice-president discharges the duties of the president, he/she does not function as the Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| President has constitutional immunity for their unconstitutional, *mala fides* activities during their tenure but is liable for judicial action/punishment for their unconstitutional activity after the term of their presidency. However, per Article 361 (1), President is answerable to a court designated by either house of the parliament with a two-thirds majority for the investigation of a charge against him under article 61. | Chief justice/judges of the supreme court are also immune from punishment for not delivering correct judgements or for their incompetence and mala fides. However, Judges' verdict can be repealed by a higher level bench of other judges.\n |\n| President cannot be recalled by the people of India for not fulfilling their constitutional duties in case parliament is not impeaching the president or removed by the supreme court. | Chief justice/judges of the supreme court also cannot be recalled by the people of India in case parliament is not impeaching the judges.\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n57. **^** \"Sections 13 to 20, The Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952\".

The first president, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College.[4] Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is therefore counted as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, giving rise to the discrepancy between the number of presidencies and the number of individuals who have served as president.[5] The incumbent president is Joe Biden.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPresidents of the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| Presidents andpresidencies | 1.

Upon the resignation of 37th president, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford became the 38th president even though he simply served out the remainder of Nixon's second term and was never elected to the presidency in his own right. Grover Cleveland was both the 22nd president and the 24th president because his two terms were not consecutive. A vice president who temporarily becomes acting president under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution is not counted, because the president remains in office during such a period.\n2. **^** Reflects the president's political party at the start of their presidency.

Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms.[8] Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFour presidents died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon, facing impeachment and removal from office).[10] John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, and set the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with his presidency.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Professionalcareer | * Approval rating\n* Assassination attempts and plots\n* Control of Congress\n* Desks\n* Doctrines\n* Executive orders\n* Historical rankings\n* Impeachment efforts\n* International trips\n* Judicial appointments\n* Military service\n\t+ rank\n* Official vehicles\n* Other offices held\n* Pardons\n* Post-presidency campaigns\n* Previous experience\n* Time in office\n* Vetoes\n |\n| Personal life | * Age\n* Ancestry\n* Bibliographies\n\t+ autobiographies\n* Burial places\n* Coats of arms\n* Death\n\t+ in office\n* Education\n* Facial hair\n* Families\n\t+ first ladies\n\t+ children\n* Firsts\n* Freemasons\n* Home state\n* Left-handed\n* Multilingualism\n* Net worth\n* Nicknames\n* Pets\n* Religious affiliation\n* Residences\n* Scouts\n* Slave owners\n* Vacations\n |\n| Depictionsand honors | * Actor portrayals\n\t+ fictional\n* Currency\n* Educational institutions\n* Libraries\n* Memorials\n\t+ in other countries\n* Military vessels\n* Portraits\n* Sculptures\n* U.S. counties\n* U.S. postage stamps\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCharles W.

The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, no organized parties existed. Soon after the 1st Congress convened, political factions began rallying around dominant Washington administration officials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson.[12] Concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never affiliated with a political party.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hoff, Joan (2000) [1999]. \"Nixon, Richard Milhous\". *American National Biography*.

The office was first filled on 18 August 1945 when Sukarno was elected by acclamation by the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) because according to the Transitional Provisions of the, \"the President and the Vice President for the first time shall be elected by the PPKI.\" Also, the body responsible for the presidential elections, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), had not yet been formed.[3]:\u200a138 On 16 October 1945, Vice President Mohammad Hatta announced a vice-presidential decree which gave the Central National Committee of Indonesia (KNIP) legislative powers.[3]:\u200a152 On 11 November 1945, the KNIP made the decision to separate the role of Head of State from that of Head of Government. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Vice President of Indonesia\n* Presidential state car\n* Air Indonesia One\n* Paspampres\n* List of presidents of Indonesia\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Since 2004, previously via the People's Consultative Assembly.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 2001 MPR Annual Session, it was finally decided that from 2004 onwards, the president will directly be elected by the people.[13] In response to Sukarno and Suharto's abuses of power, other amendments passed at that session hedged the presidency about with numerous checks and balances to prevent another president from completely dominating the system. For example, the president was limited to two terms, whether successive or separated. He also lost the right to legislate, but could propose legislation.\n\n\nIn 2004 election, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono became Indonesia's first directly elected president, beating incumbent Megawati Sukarnoputri in the runoff election. He was re-elected in 2009. In 2014, Yudhoyono finished his second presidential term and was barred from seeking re-election.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 3rd Indonesian presidential election was held on 9 July 2014 and matched former general and Suharto's ex-son in law Prabowo Subianto against the governor of Jakarta, Joko Widodo. On 22 July the General Elections Commission announced Joko Widodo's victory. He and his vice president, Jusuf Kalla, were sworn in on 20 October 2014, for a 5-year term.\n\n\n\n## Requirements to run for office[edit]\n\n\n**The Amended 1945 Constitution**: The presidential candidate has to be an Indonesian citizen since their birth, who has not willingly become a citizen in another nation, has not betrayed the nation, and is physically and mentally capable of performing the duties. Amended Constitution also states that further criteria will be determined by laws. The president is also required to be nominated by a Political Party or a coalition of Political Parties.\n\n\n**2017 Law No. 7 Regarding Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections**  \nThe presidential candidate must:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSuharto fell from power in May 1998 and the presidency experienced changes as a result of the reform movement. Compared to Suharto, who had all of his accountability speeches accepted, B. J. Habibie had his only accountability speech rejected.[11] Abdurrahman Wahid then became the first president who had to beat another candidate to be elected, as Sukarno and Suharto had been sole candidates. As a result of this, Wahid was also the first president to be elected through counting votes instead of by acclamation. However, Wahid was impeached and removed from office by the MPR. This was a clear sign that while the presidency is the key institution, the MPR was now truly a check on the president's power. Wahid was replaced by his vice president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of Sukarno and former opposition leader during Suharto's presidency. Megawati is the first and, so far, only female ever to become President of Indonesia.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elected officials | * President of Indonesia\n\t+ *list*\n* Vice President of Indonesia\n\t+ *list*\n |\n| Cabinet (List) and Ministries | * Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs\n* Coordinating Minister for Human Development and Cultural Affairs\n* Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs\n* Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal, and Security Affairs\n* Agriculture\n* State Apparatus Utilization and Bureaucratic Reform\n* Communication and Information Technology\n* Cooperatives and Small & Medium Enterprises\n* Defense\n* Energy and Mineral Resources\n* Environment and Forestry\n* Women Empowerment and Child Protection\n* Finance\n* Foreign Affairs\n* Health\n* Home Affairs\n* Industry\n* Investment\n* Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning\n* Law and Human Rights\n* Manpower\n* Maritime Affairs and Fisheries\n* National Development Planning\n* Public Works and People's Housing\n* Religious Affairs\n* Education, Culture, Research, and Technology\n* Social Affairs\n* State Owned Enterprises\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Latar Belakang Dekrit Presiden 5 Juli 1959\" (in Indonesian).

Sukarno then gave a mandate for Sjafruddin Prawiranegara to form an emergency government.[4] This was done and the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PDRI) was formed in Sumatra with Prawiranegara as its chairman. Prawiranegara handed back his mandate to Sukarno on 13 July 1949.[5] On 17 December 1949, Sukarno was elected president of the Republic of the United States of Indonesia (RIS) and presidential mandate passed to Assaat.[6] When it became clear that RIS was going to be replaced by a unitary state, Asaat stepped down from the presidency and Sukarno once again became president on 15 August 1950.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **This article is part of a series on the** |\n| Politics ofIndonesia |\n| ![](image) |\n| National government\n![](image)\n* **Constitution of Indonesia**\n\n\n* Law\n* Taxation\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n*Pancasila* (national philosophy)\n |\n| Executive\n![](image)\n* **President of Indonesia**\n\n\n* Joko Widodo (PDI-P)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n* **Vice President of Indonesia**\n\n\n* Ma'ruf Amin (Ind.)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Cabinet\n\n\n* Regional government\n* Governors\n |\n| Legislature\n![](image)\n* **People's Consultative Assembly**\n\n\n* Speaker Bambang Soesatyo (Golkar)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n![](image)\n\n* **House of Representatives**\n\n\n* Speaker Puan Maharani (PDI-P)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n![](image)\n\n* **Regional Representative Council**\n\n\n* Speaker La Nyalla Mattalitti (East Java)\n |\n| Judiciary\n![](image)\n* **Supreme Court of Indonesia**\n\n\n* Chief Justice Muhammad Syarifuddin\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n![](image)\n\n* **Constitutional court**\n\n\n* Chief Justice Suhartoyo\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Judicial commission\n |\n| Elections\n![](image)\n* **General Elections Commission**\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Chairman Hasyim Asy'ari\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* **Legislative elections**\n\t+ 1955 (Const.)\n\t+ 1955\n\t+ 1971\n\t+ 1977\n\t+ 1982\n\t+ 1987\n\t+ 1992\n\t+ 1997\n\t+ 1999\n\t+ 2004\n\t+ 2009\n\t+ 2014\n\t+ 2019\n\t+ 2024\n\n\n* **Presidential elections**\n\t+ 1999\n\t+ 2004\n\t+ 2009\n\t+ 2014\n\t+ 2019\n\t+ 2024\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Law\n* Electoral Districts\n |\n| Political parties\n* List of political parties\n |\n| Foreign relations\n* Diplomatic missions of / in Indonesia\n* Diplomatic missions in Jakarta\n |\n| * ![flag](image) Indonesia portal\n* ![icon](image) Politics portal\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Pledge of Office of the President of the Republic of Indonesia**: \"I solemnly pledge to fulfill the duties of President (Vice President) of the Republic of Indonesia to the best of my capabilities and in the fairest way possible, to uphold the Constitution by all means and to execute all laws and regulations as straightforwardly as possible as well as to dedicate myself to the service of the Nation and the People.\"\n\n\n\n## Powers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Abortion\n* Crime\n* Human trafficking\n* Piracy\n* Prostitution\n* Smoking\n |\n| Culture | * Architecture\n\t+ Candi\n\t+ Colonial\n\t+ Mosques\n\t+ *Rumah adat*\n* Art\n* Cinema\n* Costume\n* Cuisine\n* Dance\n* Festivals\n* Legends\n* Literature\n* Martial arts\n* Media\n* Music\n* Mythology\n* National heroes\n* Painting\n* Properties\n* Public holidays\n* Sport\n* Theatre\n* Video games\n |\n| Demographics | * Education\n* Ethnic groups\n* Health\n\t+ Healthcare\n* Homelessness\n* Languages\n* Religion\n* Refugees\n* Women\n* LGBT rights\n |\n| Symbols | * Anthem\n* Costume\n* Emblem\n\t+ Historical\n\t+ Subdivision\n* Faunal emblems\n* Flag\n\t+ Subdivision\n* Floral emblems\n* Motto\n* Nusantara\n* Personification\n* Songs\n |\n\n |\n| * Outline\n* Index\n\n* Category\n* Portal\n* Gallery\n* Atlas\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPresidents of Indonesia\n |\n| --- |\n| * Sukarno\n* Suharto\n* B.

Officially known as the Provisional Constitution, the document confirmed the president's role as the head of state, but limited him to a mostly ceremonial role. He appointed a prime minister on the advice of formateurs.[7]\n\n\nDespite his limited constitutional role, Sukarno commanded great moral authority. Nonetheless, he was never content with the role of ceremonial head of State, and grew increasingly disenchanted with western-style parliamentary democracy. In the early 1950s, he began calling for the implementation of \"Guided Democracy,\" in which decisions would be made after lengthy deliberation with a view toward achieving a consensus under presidential \"guidance.\"\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough Indonesia had re-adopted the 1945 Constitution, it did not mean that it was strictly adhered to. The MPR, which at this stage was still on a provisional basis (MPRS), was subservient to the president despite its status of the Nation's highest Governing Body. It was only in 1966, when the political tide began to turn against Sukarno that the MPRS nominally regained its rightful constitutional status. In 1967, Sukarno was forced to resign as president, and army chief of staff Suharto was appointed as acting president.\n\n\n\n### Suharto era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Megawati Digaji Rp 112 Juta, Lebih Besar dari Gaji Presiden\" (in Indonesian).

Taking advantage of the situation, Sukarno made a speech in April 1959 and suggested that Indonesia return to the 1945 Constitution.[8] The People reacted enthusiastically and there was strong pressure on the Constitutional Assembly, the body responsible for formulating a new constitution, to adopt the 1945 Constitution. When the assembly did not budge, Sukarno issued a presidential decree on 5 July 1959 declaring that Indonesia was returning to the 1945 Constitution.[8] That document made the president head of government as well as head of state.

During his rise to power, Suharto seemed determined to observe at least the forms of the constitution, and this continued when he became president. Under the constitution, the MPR was responsible for formulating the Outlines of State Policy (GBHN); as president, Suharto was responsible for implementing them. Suharto also made it a presidential obligation to deliver accountability speeches near the end of his terms. During the speech, Suharto outlined the achievements that his administration had made and how those achievements had adhered to the GBHN set by the MPR. Despite the constitutional and democratic fa\u00e7ade, Suharto made sure that the MPR was subservient to him. In 1969, a law was passed that required appointments to the MPR to be made official by the president.[10] He also took measures that largely emasculated the opposition parties. For example, he had the power to issue governmental regulations in lieu of law. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**The Amended 1945 Constitution**: Together with the vice president, the president is elected directly by the people on a single ticket. Further election rules are determined by laws passed by the DPR. The president-elect is required to read either an oath or a promise of office before officially becoming president. The term of office is five years and after that the president can be re-elected for only one more term, whether successive or separated. The president and vice president candidate must receive over half the votes total, including at least 20% of the votes in at least half the 38 provinces[15] to win. In the event that no ticket wins an outright victory, a runoff is held between the two tickets with the first and second most votes in the first round, with the ticket that receives the most votes elected as President and Vice President.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNominally, if these regulations were not approved by the House of People's Representatives (DPR, the pre-2004 legislative branch), they were considered revoked. However, given the DPR's infrequent sessions and the near-total dominance of the pro-government political grouping, Golkar, such approval was a mere formality. Thus, for all intents and purposes, Suharto ruled by decree for most of his tenure. For the better part of Suharto's rule, he effectively held all governing power in the nation.\n\n\n\n### Reform era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLeaders of Southeast Asian countries\n |\n| --- |\n| Heads of state | * Brunei (Monarch)\n* Cambodia (Monarch)\n* East Timor (President)\n* Indonesia (President) (list)\n* Laos (President)\n* Malaysia (Monarch)\n* Myanmar (President) (list)\n* Philippines (President) (list)\n* Singapore (President)\n* Thailand (Monarch) (list)\n* Vietnam (President) (list)\n |\n| Heads of government | * Brunei\n* Cambodia (list)\n* East Timor\n* Indonesia (list)\n* Laos\n* Malaysia\n* Myanmar (list)\n* Philippines (list)\n* Singapore\n* Thailand (list)\n* Vietnam (list)\n |\n| Supreme leaders | * Laos\n* Myanmar\n* Vietnam\n |\n| Defunct heads of stateand government | * Burma (Monarch)\n* Dutch East Indies (Governor-General)\n* Indonesia (Prime Minister)\n* Laos (Monarch)\n* Myanmar (State Counsellor)\n* Philippines (Governor-General) (Prime Minister)\n* South Vietnam (leaders)\n |\n| **ASEAN**\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHeads of state and government of Asia\n |\n| --- |\n| Headsof state | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**The Amended 1945 Constitution**: If the president dies, resigns, removed, or is unable to perform their duties for any reason, they are replaced by the vice president. If the vice president becomes vacant, the president nominates two candidates and the MPR has to elect a new vice president out of the candidates within 60 days. If the president and the vice president dies, resigns, or are unable to perform their duties for any reason, the government will be taken over together by the minister of home affairs, minister of foreign affairs, and minister of defense. No later than 30 days after that, MPR must elect a new president and vice president from the two candidates nominated by the political party or coalition of political parties whose candidates were the winner and the runner-up in the previous presidential election.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Borders\n* Cities\n* Climate\n\t+ Climate change\n* Conservation\n\t+ Biosphere reserves\n\t+ National parks\n* Deforestation\n* Earthquakes\n* Environmental issues\n* Geology\n* Islands\n* Lakes\n* Mountains\n* Provincial highest points\n* Natural history\n\t+ Fauna\n\t+ Flora\n* Regions\n* Rivers\n* Volcanoes\n |\n\n |\n| Politics | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Administrative divisions\n\t+ Historical\n\t+ Provinces\n\t+ Regencies & Cities\n\t+ Districts\n* Cabinet\n* Constitution\n* Elections\n* Foreign relations\n* Human rights\n* Refugees\n* Law\n\t+ Censorship\n\t+ Enforcement\n* Military (Babinsa)\n* National capital\n* *Pancasila*\n* People's Consultative Assembly\n* Police\n* Political parties\n* President (List)\n* *Wawasan Nusantara*\n |\n\n |\n| Economy | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Agriculture\n* Automotive\n* Aviation\n* Banks\n* Energy\n* History\n* Science and technology\n* Stock Exchange\n* Telecommunications\n* Tourism\n* Transport\n* Water supply and sanitation\n |\n\n |\n| Society | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* National Library of Indonesia\n* National Research and Innovation Agency\n* National Standardization Agency\n* Nuclear Energy Regulatory Agency\n* Cabinet Secretariat\n* National Administration Institute\n* National Civil Service Agency\n* Radio of the Republic of Indonesia\n* Television of the Republic of Indonesia\n |\n| Non-StructuralAgency | * Acceleration of Housing Enforcement\n* Acceleration of Infrastructure Provision Policy Committee\n* Anti Dumping Committee\n* Attorney Commission\n* Broadcasting Commission\n* Business Competition Supervisory Commission\n* Central Information Commission\n* Child Protection Commission\n* Civil Service Advisory Agency\n* Commission for Assessment of Analysis of Environmental Impacts\n* Commission on Biological Safety of Genetically Engineered Products\n* Company Privatization Committee\n* Cooperative Council\n* Corruption Eradication Commission\n* Council of Engineers\n* Council of Health Workers\n* Counterfeited Rupiah Eradication Coordinating Board\n* Defense Industry Policy Committee\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The then serving governor-general, Major-General Iskander Mirza, assumed office as the first president. Following the 1958 *coup d'etat*, the office of prime minister was abolished, leaving the Presidency as the most powerful office in the country. This position was further strengthened when the 1962 Constitution was adopted. It turned Pakistan into a Presidential Republic, giving all executive powers to the president. In 1973, the new Constitution established Parliamentary democracy and reduced the president's role to a ceremonial one. Nevertheless, the military takeover in 1977 reversed the changes. The 8th Amendment turned Pakistan into a semi-presidential republic and in the period between 1985 and 2010, the executive power was shared by the president and prime minister. The 18th Amendment in 2010 restored Parliamentary Democracy in the country, and reduced the presidency to a ceremonial position.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor a comprehensive list, see List of heads of state of Pakistan.\n\nHead of state of Pakistan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIf the resolution is passed by the two-thirds majority at the joint session declaring that the president is unfit to hold the office due to incapacity or is guilty of violating the Constitution or of gross misconduct, then the president shall cease to hold office immediately on the passing of the resolution.[37]\n\n\nNo president has been impeached.

However, the corruption charges and the controversial death of Murtaza Bhutto in 1996 resulted in President Farooq Leghari dismissing Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. In 1997, President Farooq Leghari could not overcome the heavy mandate bestowed on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif by the public in 1997. President Leghari unsuccessfully supported Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah\u2014 both of them resigned, ending the conflict between the Judiciary, the Executive, and the Parliament. After appointing Rafiq Tarar, the Parliament successfully passed constitutional amendment to decisively limit the presidency. After staging a controversial self coup in 1999, General Pervez Musharraf dismissed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Rafiq Tarar in 2001 while assuming more powers to the presidency. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn January 2004, the Electoral College elected Musharraf, and as a result he was, according to the Constitution, \"deemed to be elected\".[39]\n\n\nPresident Musharraf's repeated unconstitutional intervention resulted in a standoff with the Judiciary, and declared a state of emergency in 2007, after dismissing the senior justices of the Supreme Court. Although Musharraf was elected in 2007, the constitutional legality of Musharraf's rule was found dubious. A populist constitutional movement eventually resulted in Musharraf's departure. On 22 August 2008, the electoral commission called for presidential nominations to be delivered by 26 August 2008 and for elections to be held on 6 September 2008.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### Figurehead overview[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Gupta, K.

President Zia-ul-Haq appointed Mohammad Junejo as prime minister and assumed more powers through the constitutional amendment.
