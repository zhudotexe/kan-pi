He garnered global recognition with his portrayal of Joey Tribbiani in the NBC sitcom *Friends* and in its spin-off series, *Joey*. For his work on *Friends*, LeBlanc received three nominations at the Primetime Emmy Awards. He has also starred as a fictionalized version of himself in *Episodes* (2011–2017), for which he won a Golden Globe Award and received four additional Emmy Award nominations. He co-hosted *Top Gear* from 2016 to 2019. From 2016 to 2020, he played patriarch Adam Burns in the CBS sitcom *Man with a Plan.*\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nLeBlanc was born at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Massachusetts. His mother, Patricia (née Di Cillo), was an office manager; his father, Paul LeBlanc, was a mechanic.[1][2] His father is of French-Canadian descent and his mother is of Italian ancestry, the daughter of immigrants from Arce, Lazio.[3] He attended Newton North High School, where he graduated in the same year as future comedian Louis C.K.[4] After high school he attended college at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston. He dropped out shortly after starting his second semester.[5]\n\n\nLeBlanc moved to New York at the age of 17 to pursue a career in modeling, but he was told he was too short to be in the industry. His acting career began after a woman invited him to accompany her to an audition, where he ended up getting signed by her manager.[6] Although he had booked commercials and television and film roles before *Friends*, he was reportedly down to his last eleven dollars before landing the role of Joey Tribbiani.[7]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1987–1994: Early career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)LeBlanc at the 47th Primetime Emmy Awards, 1995\nLeBlanc first appeared in a 1987 Heinz Tomato Ketchup commercial. In 1988, he starred in the television drama *TV 101* for one season. In 1991, he had a recurring role on the hit Fox sitcom *Married... with Children*. He played Vinnie Verducci, a family friend of protagonist Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill) who briefly dates his daughter, Kelly (Christina Applegate). He also guest-starred in the first season of *Red Shoe Diaries*. LeBlanc starred in two short-lived *Married... with Children* spin-offs: *Top of the Heap* (1991) and *Vinnie & Bobby* (1992).\n\n\nHe appeared in two Bon Jovi music videos: \"Miracle,\" from the *Young Guns II* soundtrack in 1990, and \"Say It Isn't So\" in 2000.[8] He also appeared in videos for Alanis Morissette's single \"Walk Away,\" and Bob Seger's \"Night Moves\".[9]\n\n\n\n### 1994–2006: *Friends*, *Joey* and film roles[edit]\n\n\nLeBlanc found success as the dimwitted but lovable Joey Tribbiani on *Friends*; he played this character for 12 years — 10 seasons of *Friends* and two seasons of *Joey*. *Friends* was wildly successful, and LeBlanc (along with co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer) gained wide recognition among viewers. This ensemble situation comedy became a major hit for NBC, airing on Thursday nights for ten years.[10]\n\n\nFor his performance, LeBlanc received three Primetime Emmy Award nominations, three Golden Globe award nominations, and one Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. During this time he also appeared in the films *Lookin' Italian* (1994), *Ed* (1996), *Lost in Space* (1998), *Charlie's Angels* (2000), and its sequel, *Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle* (2003).\n\n\nFollowing the cancellation of *Joey*, LeBlanc announced that he would be taking a one-year hiatus from acting on television, which eventually turned into five years.[11]\n\n\n\n### 2011–present: Career revival[edit]\n\n\n![](image)LeBlanc at the Golden Globes with Meryl Streep, 2012\nFrom 2011, LeBlanc appeared as a fictionalized version of himself in *Episodes*,[12] a television series about an American remake of a fictional British television series.[13][14] The series is written by *Friends* co-creator David Crane and his partner Jeffrey Klarik.[15] At the 69th Golden Globe Awards in 2012, LeBlanc won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a television series, musical, or comedy, and was nominated for an additional four Primetime Emmy Awards.[16]\n\n\nIn February 2012, LeBlanc appeared in the second episode of the eighteenth series of *Top Gear*, where he set the fastest lap time in the \"Star in a Reasonably Priced Car\" segment in a Kia Cee'd. Lapping at 1:42.1, he beat the show's previous record-holder, Rowan Atkinson, by 0.1 seconds.[9] He also appeared in the fourth episode of the nineteenth season to race the New Kia Cee'd, and beat his previous time.\n\n\nIn February 2016, the BBC announced LeBlanc had signed on to become one of the new *Top Gear* hosts,[17] signing a two-year deal later that year.[18] In May 2018, he announced that he was leaving the series in order to spend more time with his family and friends in the US.[19] He and Rory Reid were replaced by new co-hosts Paddy McGuinness and Andrew Flintoff in the twenty-seventh series in October 2018.\n\n\nLeBlanc played the lead role in the CBS sitcom *Man with a Plan*, which began airing in 2016 until it was cancelled in 2020.[20]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nLeBlanc has an extensive interest in cars, and worked as a carpenter before acting.[21] He married Melissa McKnight, a British-born American model and a divorced single mother of two children, in May 2003.[22] In 1997, they were introduced to each other by McKnight's friend, Kelly Phillips (wife of actor Lou Diamond Phillips). LeBlanc proposed to her a year later.[22] Their daughter, born in 2004, began suffering seizures at eight months old. By the time she was two years old, the condition, thought to be due to cortical dysplasia, had mostly subsided.[22][23] LeBlanc and McKnight divorced in October 2006, citing irreconcilable differences.[24]\n\n\nLeBlanc met actress Andrea Anders in 2004 while she was co-starring as his friend and eventual love interest on *Joey* and the pair eventually embarked on a relationship which was confirmed in 2006 following LeBlanc's split from his wife Melissa McKnight.[25][26] After over eight years as a couple, LeBlanc announced at the start of 2015 that he and Anders had been broken up for several months.[27]\n\n\nLeBlanc primarily resides in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles.[28]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Title | Role | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1987\n | *Doll Day Afternoon* | GI Joe\n | Film debut, short film\n |\n| 1993\n | *Grey Knight* | Terhue\n |  |\n| *Red Shoe Diaries 3: Another Woman's Lipstick* | Kyle\n | Segment: \"Just Like That\"\n |\n| 1994\n | *Lookin' Italian* | Anthony Manetti\n |  |\n| 1996\n | *Ed* | Jack 'Deuce’ Cooper\n |  |\n| 1997\n | *Red Shoe Diaries 7: Burning Up* | Jed\n | Segment: \"Kidnap\"\n |\n| 1998\n | *Lost in Space* | Major Don West\n |  |\n| 2000\n | *Charlie's Angels* | Jason Gibbs\n |  |\n| 2001\n | *All the Queen's Men* | O'Rourke\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle* | Jason Gibbs\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Jonah Hex* | —\n | Executive producer\n |\n| 2014\n | *Lovesick* | Charlie Darby\n |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1988–1989\n | *TV 101* | Chuck Bender\n | Series regular (13 episodes)\n |\n| 1989\n | *Just the Ten of Us* | Todd Murphy\n | 2 episodes\n |\n| 1990\n | *Anything to Survive* | Billy Burton\n | Television movie\n |\n| *Monsters* | Tommy\n | Episode: \"Shave and a Haircut, Two Bites\"\n |\n| 1991\n | *Married... with Children* | Vinnie Verducci\n | 4 episodes\n |\n| *Top of the Heap* | Main cast (7 episodes)\n |\n| 1992\n | *Vinnie & Bobby* | Main cast (7 episodes)\n |\n| 1992–1993\n | *Red Shoe Diaries* | Tom's Brother, Jed Cody/Kyle\n | 2 episodes\n |\n| 1993\n | *Class of '96* | Frank Goodman\n | Episode: \"Bright Smoke, Cold Fire\"\n |\n| 1994\n | *Reform School Girl* | Vince\n | Television movie\n |\n| 1994–2004\n | *Friends* | Joey Tribbiani | Main cast (236 episodes)\n |\n| 2004–2006\n | *Joey* | Main cast (46 episodes)\n |\n| 2011–2017\n | *Episodes* | Fictionalized version of himself[12] | Main cast (41 episodes)\n |\n| 2012\n | *Top Gear* | Himself (guest)\n | 1 episode\n |\n| 2013\n | *Web Therapy* | Nick Jericho\n | Web series; 3 episodes\n |\n| *Web Therapy* | Television series; 2 episodes\n |\n| 2015\n | *The Prince* |  | Television movie; producer\n |\n| 2016–2019\n | *Top Gear* | Himself (presenter)\n | 24 episodes (series 23, 24, 25, 26)\n |\n| 2016–2020\n | *Man with a Plan* | Adam Burns\n | Main cast (69 episodes); also executive producer\n |\n| 2021\n | *Friends: The Reunion* | Himself\n | HBO Max special; also executive producer[29] |\n| *Top Gear: A Tribute to Sabine Schmitz* | Himself\n | 1 episode\n |\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1990\n | \"Miracle\"\n | Friend\n |  |\n| 1991\n | \"Into the Great Wide Open\"\n | Young man\n |  |\n| \"Walk Away\"\n | Boyfriend\n |  |\n| 1994\n | \"Night Moves\"\n | Young man\n |  |\n| 2000\n | \"Say It Isn't So\"\n | Unknown\n |  |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Matt LeBlanc\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Tauber, Michelle (May 19, 2003). \"Way to Go, Joey!\". *People*.

While still acting in *Friends*, his first leading film role was in *The Pallbearer* (1996), followed by roles in *Kissing a Fool*, *Six Days, Seven Nights*, *Apt Pupil* (all 1998), and *Picking Up the Pieces* (2000). He was then cast in the miniseries *Band of Brothers* (2001) as Herbert Sobel.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1994, Schwimmer was cast as Ross Geller in NBC's situation comedy *Friends*, a series that revolved around a group of friends who live near each other in Manhattan. He played a hopeless-romantic paleontologist who works at a museum and later becomes a professor at a university. Schwimmer initially turned down the role as Ross, but accepted later.[13] Executive producer Kevin S. Bright said that he had previously worked with Schwimmer,[14] the character of Ross was written with him in mind, and he was the first actor cast.[13] The show debuted on September 22, 1994, and was watched by almost 22 million American viewers.[15] *Friends* quickly developed a loyal audience, with the show and Schwimmer receiving strong reviews. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine: \"David Schwimmer Had Kylo Ren Hair In College\". *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*.

In *Kissing a Fool*, a romantic comedy, Schwimmer played Max, a dapper, smart-mouthed ladies' man.[25] Mick LaSalle of the *San Francisco Chronicle* wrote, \"Fans of the sitcom *Friends* may be surprised by David Schwimmer in *Kissing a Fool*. [...] Take it from someone who has never seen *Friends* and comes at Schwimmer with no preconceptions: He does just fine. As a TV sports reporter in *Kissing a Fool*, he oozes the command and self-satisfaction of a young, successful man.\"[25] The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.[26] In *Six Days, Seven Nights*, he played the boyfriend of Anne Heche's character. In *Apt Pupil*, adapted from a novella of the same name by Stephen King,[27] he had a supporting role as a school guidance counselor. \"I was scared of the part\", Schwimmer said, \"but I wanted to be part of the movie\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSchwimmer dated singer-songwriter Natalie Imbruglia in the late 1990s. Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston admitted to having crushes on each other early on while filming *Friends* during HBO Max's *Friends: The Reunion*.[85] Schwimmer began a relationship with British artist Zoë Buckman in 2007[86] and they married on 4 June 2010 and their daughter Cleo Buckman Schwimmer was born in 2011.[87][88][89][90][91] The couple announced in April 2017 that they were \"taking some time apart\".[86] They divorced later that year.[92] Schwimmer and his ex-wife are on good terms and continue to co-parent their child amicably. He tends to keep his personal life away from the media to preserve his daughter's childhood.[93]\n\n\nSchwimmer primarily lives in East Village, Manhattan.[94] He previously had a loft in Near West Side, Chicago as well as a house in Hancock Park, Los Angeles.[95][96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n95. **^** \"David Schwimmer sells longtime Near West Side home for $965,000\". *Chicago Tribune*.

Law* in 1992, and the comedy-drama series *The Wonder Years*.[9] He made his feature film debut in *Flight of the Intruder* (1991),[2] had a recurring role as a lawyer-turned-vigilante in *NYPD Blue* before auditioning, unsuccessfully, for a series pilot called *Couples*.[2] He landed his first regular series role as the liberal son of a conservative talk show host (Henry Winkler) in the sitcom *Monty*.[2]\n\n\n\n### 1994–2004: Breakthrough[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2001, Schwimmer played Captain Herbert M. Sobel in Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks' HBO World War II miniseries *Band of Brothers*. The television miniseries is based on the book of the same title written by historian and biographer Stephen Ambrose.[29] Although *Band of Brothers* was met with largely positive reception,[30] Schwimmer's performance was criticized; the BBC News concluded, \"Part of the problem ... may have been the ridiculous fact that *Friends* favourite David Schwimmer plays the hard and cruel Captain Herbert Sobel. The only thing believable about Schwimmer's acting is when he cowers in the face of true battle. His puppy dog eyes make him appear even more pitiful.\"[31] Later that year he portrayed Yitzhak Zuckerman in the war drama *Uprising*, based on the true events of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943.[32][33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2016, Schwimmer starred as lawyer Robert Kardashian in *The People v. O. J. Simpson*, for which he received his second Primetime Emmy Award nomination, this time for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSchwimmer was born in Flushing, Queens,[5] New York City, to attorneys Arthur (born 1941) and Arlene Coleman-Schwimmer (born 1940).[6][7] His family is Jewish.[8] He has an older sister named Ellie (born 1965).[2] His family subsequently moved to Los Angeles, where Schwimmer, at 10, had his first acting experience when he was cast as the fairy godmother in a Jewish version of *Cinderella*.[2] In 1979, Schwimmer went to a Shakespeare workshop given by English actor Sir Ian McKellen in Los Angeles.[9] He recalls being riveted by the experience.[9] Schwimmer then entered a contest in the Southern California Shakespeare Festival three years in a row, winning two first prizes.[9][10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnd then there was some real emotion to it with the relationship between the father and the son and the romance aspect.\"[55] *Run Fatboy Run* garnered mixed reception, with the *New York Daily News* rating it one-and-a-half out of five stars and writing, \"Most disappointing is how Schwimmer—who spent 10 seasons on a sitcom filled with hyperverbal characters—manages to bumble 'Fatboy's' tender moments.\"[56] *USA Today*, however, was favorable towards Schwimmer, reporting he possesses filmmaking finesse \"having wisely chosen strong comic material for his debut behind the camera.\"[57] For his directorial work, he was nominated for a British Independent Film Award in the category of Best Debut Director.[58]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nI've seen a fair bit of Schwimmer's post-*Friends* stage work in London and New York, and I've never seen him better\", commented the *Chicago Tribune*.[67]\n\n\nOn August 2, 2009, Schwimmer played himself in the sixth season of the HBO television series, *Entourage*. In the episode, Ari Gold's (Jeremy Piven) agency tries to steer his career back to television.[69] Schwimmer directed his second feature, *Trust*, starring Clive Owen and Catherine Keener. The film, a drama, is about a family whose teenage daughter becomes victim of an online sexual predator.[70][71] *Trust* premiered at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival.[72]\n\n\n\n### 2010–present: Return to television[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Schwimmer in 2007 at the premiere of his directorial debut, *Run Fatboy Run.*\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_kUqaqURWARaS7EuyRjNAtiZK","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
