They set their own academic standards and manage their own budgets. The president, however, plays an important part in university-wide planning and strategy. Each names a faculty's dean (and, since the foundation of the office in 1994, the university's provost), and grants tenure to recommended professors; however, the president is expected to make such decisions after extensive consultation with faculty members.\n\n\nHarvard presidents have traditionally influenced educational practices nationwide. Charles W. Eliot, for example, originated America's familiar system of a smorgasbord of elective courses available to each student;[2] James B. Conant worked to introduce standardized testing; Derek Bok and Neil L. Rudenstine argued for the continued importance of diversity in higher education.\n\n\nRecently, however, the job has become increasingly administrative, especially as fund-raising campaigns have taken on central importance in large institutions such as Harvard. Some have criticized this trend to the extent it has prevented the president from focusing on substantive issues in higher education.[3]\n\n\nEach president is professor in some department of the university and teaches from time to time.\n\n\nHarvard's current president is Claudine Gay, having become Harvard's 30th president on July 1, 2023.[4]\n\n\nShe succeeded Lawrence Bacow who retired on June 30, 2023.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nAt Harvard's founding it was headed by a \"schoolmaster,\" Nathaniel Eaton. In 1640, when Henry Dunster was brought in, he adopted the title president. The origins of this title have been grounds for a certain amount of speculation.\n\n\nHarvard was founded for the training of Puritan clergy, and even though its mission was soon broadened, nearly all presidents through the end of the 18th century were in holy orders.\n\n\nAll presidents from Leonard Hoar through Nathan Pusey were graduates of Harvard College. Of the presidents since Pusey, Bok earned his undergraduate degree at Stanford, Rudenstine at Princeton, and Summers and Bacow at MIT, but each earned a graduate degree at Harvard. Drew Gilpin Faust was the first president since the seventeenth century with no earned Harvard degree.\n\n\nJohn Winthrop served as acting president in 1769 and again in 1773; but both times he declined an offer of the full presidency on grounds of old age.\n\n\nOther minor acting presidents have included William Brattle, Edward Wigglesworth (1780\u20131781), Henry Ware (1810, 1828\u20131829), Andrew Preston Peabody (1862, 1868\u20131869), and Henry Pickering Walcott. Henry Rosovsky, former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, served as acting president for three months in 1987 when Bok traveled abroad. Provost Albert Carnesale served as acting president for three months, from November 1994 to February 1995, during Rudenstine's leave of absence. After Faust's retirement in 2018, Bok served as interim president for a year, from July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007, prior to Faust's appointment.\n\n\n\n## Presidents of Harvard[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Image\n | Presidents\n | Term of office\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \u2013\n | ![](image) | Nathaniel Eaton | 1637\u20131639\n | Referred to as \"schoolmaster\" of Harvard College\n |\n| 1\n |  | Henry Dunster | 1640\u20131654\n |  |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Charles Chauncy | 1654\u20131672\n |  |\n| 3\n |  | Leonard Hoar | 1672\u20131675\n |  |\n| 4\n |  | Urian Oakes | 1675\u20131680 (acting); 1680\u20131681\n |  |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | John Rogers | 1682\u20131684\n |  |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | Increase Mather | 1685\u20131686 (acting); 1686\u20131692 (rector); 1692\u20131701\n |  |\n| \u2013\n | ![](image) | Samuel Willard | 1701\u20131707 (acting)\n |  |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | John Leverett | 1708\u20131724\n |  |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Benjamin Wadsworth | 1725\u20131737\n |  |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | Edward Holyoke | 1737\u20131769\n |  |\n| 10\n |  | Samuel Locke | 1770\u20131773\n |  |\n| 11\n |  | Samuel Langdon | 1774\u20131780\n |  |\n| 12\n |  | Joseph Willard | 1781\u20131804\n |  |\n| \u2013\n | ![](image) | Eliphalet Pearson | 1804\u20131806 (acting)\n |  |\n| 13\n |  | Samuel Webber | 1806\u20131810\n |  |\n| 14\n | ![](image) | John Thornton Kirkland | 1810\u20131828\n |  |\n| 15\n | ![](image) | Josiah Quincy | 1829\u20131845\n |  |\n| 16\n | ![](image) | Edward Everett | 1846\u20131848\n |  |\n| 17\n | ![](image) | Jared Sparks | 1849\u20131853\n |  |\n| 18\n | ![](image) | James Walker | 1853\u20131860\n |  |\n| 19\n | ![](image) | Cornelius Conway Felton | 1860\u20131862\n |  |\n| 20\n | ![](image) | Thomas Hill | 1862\u20131868\n |  |\n| 21\n | ![](image) | Charles William Eliot | 1869\u20131909\n | Longest term of office (40 years)\n |\n| 22\n | ![](image) | A.

In preparation for this expansion in mission, William Smith was hired in 1754 to become the new provost. Neither George Whitefield nor Benjamin Franklin formally held this title.\n2. **^** Benjamin Franklin is the founder of the institution which grew to become the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin first convened a board of trustees for an organizational meeting on November 13, 1749. They opened a secondary school, the Academy of Philadelphia, in 1751. A collegiate charter was obtained for the College of Philadelphia in 1755 and post-secondary instruction began shortly thereafter. It was the College of Philadelphia which ultimately was renamed the University of Pennsylvania in 1791. Penn considered 1749 to be its founding date until 1899, when the board of trustees voted to retroactively revise its founding date to 1740 in order to make the university older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746. The 1740 date was selected because, in that year, a group of Philadelphians joined together to build a large preaching hall for the use of traveling evangelist George Whitefield who toured the American colonies delivering well attended open air sermons. The grand building was erected but, due to a shortage of funding, the interior was not furnished and the hall sat unused until Franklin's group purchased it in 1750. Thus, Whitefield himself was not involved in the school which eventually became Penn, but is listed here as a placeholder to signify the period that the preaching hall raised by his followers sat dormant between 1740 and 1750.\n3. **^** As described in more detail in the appended notes, a charity school was planned by followers of George Whitefield but it never opened before the building was purchased by Benjamin Franklin's group in 1750. The structure itself was known as the \"New Building\" but the associated educational trust itself was never named.\n4. **^** Franklin's formal title was president of the board of trustees, first of the \"Academy and Charitable School in the Province of Pennsylvania\" until the college was founded, and then of the \"College, Academy and Charity School of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.\"\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Schools | * Arts and Sciences\n\t+ College\n\t+ Graduate Division\n\t+ Liberal and Professional Studies\n* Communication\n* Dental Medicine\n* Design\n* Education\n* Engineering and Applied Science\n* Law\n* Medicine\n* Nursing\n* Social Policy and Practice\n* Veterinary Medicine\n* Wharton\n | ![Benjamin Franklin (University of Pennsylvania)](image)\n |\n| Programs | * Advanced Judaic Studies\n* Government\n* Global Communication Studies\n* Mediterranean Art and Archaeology\n* International Studies and Business\n* Management and Technology\n* Lauder Institute\n* Health Economics\n* Networked and Social Systems Engineering\n* Molecular Life Science\n* Public Policy\n* Diplomacy and Global Engagement\n |\n| Places | * University City\n* Annenberg Center\n* College Hall\n* College Houses\n* David Rittenhouse Laboratory\n* Fisher Fine Arts Library\n* Historic District\n* Houston Hall\n* Institute of Contemporary Art\n* Irvine Auditorium\n* Kelly Writers House\n* Meyerson Hall\n* Moore School\n* Morris Arboretum\n* Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology\n* New Bolton Center\n* Penn Park\n* Perelman Quadrangle\n* The Quadrangle\n* Richards Laboratories\n* Van Pelt Library\n |\n| Athletics | * Penn Quakers\n* Band\n* \"Fight on, Pennsylvania!\"\n* Basketball\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Football\n* College Boat Club\n* Lacrosse\n* Penn Relays\n* Soccer\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Men's squash\n* Class of 1923 Arena\n* Franklin Field\n* Meiklejohn Stadium\n* Palestra\n |\n| Media | * *The Daily Pennsylvanian*\n\t+ *34th Street Magazine*\n\t+ *Under the Button*\n* *Pennsylvania Punch Bowl*\n* Penn Press\n* Wharton School Publishing\n* WQHS\n* WXPN\n |\n| Life | * Student life\n* Penn Band\n* Mask and Wig\n* Glee Club\n* Masala\n* MERT\n* Philomathean Society\n* Penn Club of New York\n* \"Hail, Pennsylvania!\"\n* \"The Red and Blue\"\n |\n| People | * **President:** J.

One of its ten founding ministers, Abraham Pierson, became its first Rector, the administrative and ecclesiastical head of the college. After Pierson, four more ministers served as rectors of the collegiate school, until 1745 when Yale College was chartered by the Colony of Connecticut and Thomas Clap's title was changed to president. In 1878, Yale incorporated as a university, and incumbent Timothy Dwight V became the last president of the college and the first of Yale University. The first president not ordained as a minister was Arthur Twining Hadley, inaugurated in 1899; no ordained person has held the office since.\n\n\nThe president is elected by the Yale Corporation, the governing body of the University on which the president sits *ex-officio*. The corporation's bylaws state that the president is \"chief executive officer of the University and as such is responsible for the general direction of all its affairs.\"[1] The president nominates other university officers, including the provost, secretary, and other vice presidents, for election by the corporation. Other top-level administrative positions, such as university chaplain, deans of schools, and masters of residential colleges, are appointed by the president alone.\n\n\nThe university's current president is Peter Salovey, a professor of social psychology who formerly served as University Provost and Dean of Yale College and received his Ph.D. from Yale's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.\n\n\nThe Office of the President is located in Woodbridge Hall, a 1901 building erected specifically for administrative purpose.[2] The university maintains an official home for the president on Hillhouse Avenue, which hosts presidential events. Peter Salovey, inaugurated in 2013, is the first president since 1986 to use the home as his primary residence.[3]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ezra Stiles, by Samuel King\n## Rectors of Yale College (1701\u2013)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  | Rectors of Yale College[4] | birth\u2013death | years as rector\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Abraham Pierson | (1641\u20131707) | (1701\u20131707) Collegiate School\n |\n| 2 | Samuel Andrew | (1656\u20131738) | (1707\u20131719; *pro tempore*)\n |\n| 3 | Timothy Cutler | (1684\u20131765) | (1719\u20131726) 1718/9: renamed Yale College\n |\n| 4 | Elisha Williams | (1694\u20131755) | (1726\u20131739)\n |\n| 5 | Thomas Clap | (1703\u20131767) | (1740\u20131745)\n |\n\n\n## Presidents of Yale College (1740\u20131878) and Yale University (1878\u2013)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  | Presidents of Yale College[4] | birth\u2013death | years as president\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5 | Thomas Clap | (1703\u20131767) | (1745\u20131766)\n |\n| 6 | Naphtali Daggett | (1727\u20131780) | (1766\u20131777; *pro tempore*) - presidency during the American Revolution\n |\n| 7 | Ezra Stiles | (1727\u20131795) | (1778\u20131795) - presidency during the American Revolution\n |\n| 8 | Timothy Dwight IV | (1752\u20131817) | (1795\u20131817)\n |\n| 9 | Jeremiah Day | (1773\u20131867) | (1817\u20131846)\n |\n| 10 | Theodore Dwight Woolsey | (1801\u20131889) | (1846\u20131871)\n |\n| 11 | Noah Porter III | (1811\u20131892) | (1871\u20131886)\n |\n| 12 | Timothy Dwight V | (1828\u20131916) | (1886\u20131899) 1887: renamed Yale University\n |\n| 13 | Arthur Twining Hadley | (1856\u20131930) | (1899\u20131921)\n |\n| 14 | James Rowland Angell | (1869\u20131949) | (1921\u20131937)\n |\n| 15 | Charles Seymour | (1885\u20131963) | (1937\u20131951)\n |\n| 16 | Alfred Whitney Griswold | (1906\u20131963) | (1951\u20131963)\n |\n| 17 | Kingman Brewster, Jr. | (1919\u20131988) | (1963\u20131977)\n |\n| 18 | Hanna Holborn Gray | (1930\u2013 ) | (1977\u20131978; pro tempore)\n |\n| 19 | A.
