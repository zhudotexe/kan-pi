However, recent stratigraphic studies revealed that they had been filled by slope slide events, and were sometimes repaired and modified thereafter.[9]\n\n\nThe site was first noted in a survey in 1963. Schmidt recognized its significance in 1994 and began excavations there the following year. After his death in 2014, work continued as a joint project of Istanbul University, \u015eanl\u0131urfa Museum, and the German Archaeological Institute, under the direction of Turkish prehistorian Necmi Karul. G\u00f6bekli Tepe was designated an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018, recognising its outstanding universal value as \"one of the first manifestations of human-made monumental architecture\".[10] As of 2021[update], less than 5% of the site had been excavated.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt this early stage of the site's history, circular compounds first appear. They range from 10 to 30\u00a0m (33 to 98\u00a0ft) in diameter. Their most notable feature is the presence of T-shaped limestone pillars evenly set within thick interior walls composed of unworked stone. Four such circular structures have been unearthed so far. Geophysical surveys indicate that there are 16 more, enclosing up to eight pillars each, amounting to nearly 200 pillars in all. The slabs were transported from bedrock pits located approximately 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) from the hilltop, with workers using flint points to cut through the limestone bedrock.[56] The pillars are the oldest known megaliths in the world.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLater enclosures were rectangular in shape, perhaps to make more efficient use of space compared with circular structures. They often are associated with the emergence of the Neolithic,[62] but the T-shaped pillars, the main feature of the older enclosures, also are present here, indicating that the buildings continued to serve the same function in the culture,[63] during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB). The several adjoining rectangular, doorless, and windowless rooms have floors of polished lime reminiscent of Roman terrazzo floors. Carbon dating has yielded dates between 8800 and 8000 BCE.[64] Several T-pillars up to 1.5 meters tall occupy the center of the rooms. A pair decorated with fierce-looking lions is the rationale for the name \"lion pillar building\" by which their enclosure is known.[65]\n\n\n\n* ![Enclosure B](image)\n\nEnclosure B\n* ![Enclosure C](image)\n\nEnclosure C\n* ![Enclosure F](image)\n\nEnclosure F\n\n\n### Slope slide events[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Richter, Tobias; Darabi, Hojjat; Alibaigi, Sajjad; Arranz\u2010Otaegui, Amaia; Bangsgaard, Pernille; Khosravi, Shokouh; Maher, Lisa; Mortensen, Peder; Pedersen, Patrick; Roe, Joe; Yeomans, Lisa (February 2021). \"The Formation of Early Neolithic Communities in the Central Zagros: an 11,500 year-old communal structure at Asiab\". *Oxford Journal of Archaeology*. **40** (1): 2\u201322. doi:10.1111/ojoa.12213.

There are four 10-metre-long (33\u00a0ft) and 20-centimetre-wide (7.9\u00a0in) channels on the southern part of the plateau, interpreted as the remains of an ancient quarry from which rectangular blocks were taken. These are possibly related to a square building in the neighbourhood, of which only the foundation is preserved. Presumably, this is the remains of a Roman watchtower that was part of the *Limes Arabicus*, though this is conjecture.[70] Most structures on the plateau seem to be the result of Neolithic quarrying, with the quarries being used as sources for the huge, monolithic architectural elements. Their profiles were pecked into the rock, with the detached blocks then levered out of the rock bank.[70] Several quarries where round workpieces had been produced were identified. Their status as quarries was confirmed by the find of a 3-by-3\u00a0metre piece at the southeastern slope of the plateau. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nApart from the tell, there is an incised platform with two sockets that could have held pillars and a surrounding flat bench. This platform corresponds to the oldest parts of the tell. Continuing the naming pattern, it is called \"complex\u00a0E\". Owing to its similarity to the cult-buildings at Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori it has also been called \"Temple of the Rock\". Its floor has been carefully hewn out of the bedrock and smoothed, reminiscent of the terrazzo floors of the younger complexes at G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Immediately northwest of this area are two cistern-like pits that are believed to be part of complex\u00a0E. One of these pits has a table-high pin as well as a staircase with five steps.[69]\n\n\n\n### Later structures[edit]\n\n\nThe uppermost layer of the tell is the shallowest but accounts for the longest stretch of time. It consists of loose sediments caused by erosion and the virtually-uninterrupted use of the hill for agricultural purposes since it ceased to operate as a ceremonial center.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| UNESCO World Heritage Site\n |\n| Official name | G\u00f6bekli Tepe |\n| Type | Cultural |\n| Criteria | (i), (ii), (iv) |\n| Designated | 2018 (42nd session) |\n| Reference\u00a0no. | 1572 |\n| Region | Western Asia |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**G\u00f6bekli Tepe** (Turkish: [\u025f\u0153bec\u02c8li te\u02c8pe],[2] 'Potbelly Hill';[3] known as *Gir\u00ea Mirazan* or *Xirabre\u015fk\u00ea* in Kurdish,[4] Armenian: \u054a\u0578\u0580\u057f\u0561\u057d\u0561\u0580)[5] is a Neolithic archaeological site in the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Turkey. The settlement was inhabited from c. 9500 to at least 8000 BCE,[6] during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic. It is famous for its large circular structures that contain massive stone pillars\u2014the world's oldest known megaliths. Many of these pillars are decorated with anthropomorphic details, clothing, and sculptural reliefs of wild animals, providing archaeologists rare insights into prehistoric religion and the particular iconography of the period. The 15\u00a0m (50\u00a0ft)-high, 8\u00a0ha (20-acre) tell is densely covered with ancient domestic structures[7] and other small buildings, quarries, and stone-cut cisterns from the Neolithic, as well as some traces of activity from later periods.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMiddle Eastern megaliths\n |\n| --- |\n| Lebanon | * Sands of Beirut\n* Hermel\n* Kouachra\n* Tlail\n* Wadi Boura\n | ![Flint Dolmen in Johfiyeh in Jordan](image)\n |\n| Syria | * Stone circles, lines and tombs near the Monastery of Saint Moses the Abyssinian\n |\n| Saudi Arabia | * Hejaz\n* Tihamah\n |\n| Israel | * Atlit Yam\n* Dan (ancient city)\n |\n| Jordan | * Johfiyeh\n* Amman\n |\n| Turkey | * G\u00f6bekli Tepe\n* Karahan Tepe\n |\n| Egypt | * Nabta Playa\n |\n| Iran | * Kharg Island\n |\n| Iraq | * Barda Balka\n |\n| General articles | * Standing stone\n* Dolmen\n* Henge\n* Menhir\n* Stone circle\n* Stone row\n* Concentric stone circle\n* Recumbent stone circle\n* Chambered cairn\n* Harrespil\n* Photographs of stone circles\n* European megaliths\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * Germany\n* Czech Republic\n |\n| Geographic | * Pleiades\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnequivocally Neolithic are three T-shaped pillars that had not yet been levered out of the bedrock.

The two other unfinished pillars lie on the southern Plateau.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRadiocarbon dating shows that the earliest exposed structures at G\u00f6bekli Tepe were built between 9500 and 9000 BCE, towards the end of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) period.[9][25] The site was significantly expanded in the early 9th millennium BCE and remained in use until around 8000 BCE, or perhaps slightly later (the early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, PPNB).[25] There is evidence that smaller groups returned to live amongst the ruins after the Neolithic structures were abandoned.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nincluding the abandonment of the hypothesis that the fill of the structures was brought from elsewhere, and a recognition that direct dates on plaster are affected by the old wood effect.[51] Together with new radiocarbon dates, this has established the site's absolute chronology as falling in the period 9500 to 8000 BCE \u2013 the late PPNA and PPNB.[1][52]\n\n\n\n### Building phases[edit]\n\n\nThe preliminary, now abandoned,[53] stratigraphic model by Klaus Schmidt consisted of three architectural layers. The large circular enclosures were attributed to Layer III, dated to the 10th millennium BCE (PPNA). The smaller rectangular structures and the abandonment of the site were assigned to Layer II in the 9th millennium BCE (early to middle PPNB). Layer I consisted of all post-Neolithic activities up to the modern surface.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hadad, R\u00e9mi (2022). \"In the shadow of monoliths: G\u00f6bekli Tepe and the monumental tradition of the Pre-Pottery Levant\".

In this area, flint and limestone fragments occur more frequently. It was, therefore, suggested that this could have been some kind of sculpture workshop.[68] It is unclear, on the other hand, how to classify three phallic depictions from the surface of the southern plateau. They are near the quarries of classical times, making their dating difficult.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Protective roof added to the site\nG\u00f6bekli Tepe was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018, recognising its outstanding universal value as \"one of the first manifestations of human-made monumental architecture\".[10] As of 2021[update], less than 5% of the site had been excavated.[11]\n\n\nConservation work at the site caused controversy in 2018, when \u00c7i\u011fdem K\u00f6ksal Schmidt, an archaeologist, and widow of Klaus Schmidt, said that damage was caused by the use of concrete and \"heavy equipment\" during the construction of a new walkway. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism responded that no concrete was used and that no damage had occurred.[109]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe site was first used at the dawn of the Southwest Asian Neolithic period, which marked the appearance of the oldest permanent human settlements anywhere in the world. Prehistorians link this Neolithic Revolution to the advent of agriculture, but disagree on whether farming caused people to settle down or vice versa. G\u00f6bekli Tepe, a monumental complex built on the top of a rocky mountaintop, with no clear evidence of agricultural cultivation produced to date, has played a prominent role in this debate. \n\n\nCurrent excavators interpret G\u00f6bekli Tepe as a settlement, based on recent findings such as domestic structures and features, water supply installations, and Neolithic tools associated with domestic use.[8] The site's original excavator Klaus Schmidt had described it as a sanctuary used by groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers from a wide area, with few or no permanent inhabitants.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **Phases 6 and 7:** Building activity gradually declined in phases 6 and 7 (late 9th to early 8th millennium BC).

At some point, attempts had been made to break up some of the pillars, presumably by farmers who mistook them for ordinary large rocks.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Present day landscape around G\u00f6bekli TepeG\u00f6bekli Tepe is located in the Ta\u015f Tepeler ('Stone Hills'), in the foothills of the Taurus Mountains.[12] It overlooks the Harran plain and the headwaters of the Balikh River, a tributary of the Euphrates.[12] The site is a tell (artificial mound) situated on a flat limestone plateau.[13] In the north, the plateau is connected to the neighbouring mountains by a narrow promontory. In all other directions, the ridge descends steeply into slopes and steep cliffs.[14]\n\n\nLike most Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) sites in the Urfa region, G\u00f6bekli Tepe was built on a high point on the edge of the mountains, giving it both a wide view over the plain beneath, and good visibility from the plain.[15] This location also gave the builders good access to raw material: the soft limestone bedrock from which the complex was built, and the flint to make the tools to work the limestone.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Lang, Caroline; Peters, Joris; P\u00f6llath, Nadja; Schmidt, Klaus; Grupe, Gisela (2013). \"Gazelle behaviour and human presence at early Neolithic G\u00f6bekli Tepe, south-east Anatolia\". *World Archaeology*. **45** (3): 410\u2013429. doi:10.1080/00438243.2013.820648.

Durankulak lies north of the town of Shabla, with the only places to the north along the coast being the formerly exclusively Czechoslovak camping site Kosmos and the Kartalburun and Sivriburun headlands. Durankulak is also the name of the nearby border checkpoint on the Bulgarian-Romanian border; just north of the border is the Romanian seaside resort Vama Veche.\n\n\nThe village lies on an elevation of 26 metres above mean sea level, on the E87 littoral road, 6 kilometres south of the Romanian border. Durankulak lies 100\u00a0km from Varna, 68\u00a0km from Dobrich and 60\u00a0km from Constan\u0163a.\n\n\nThe coastal Lake Durankulak is located to the southeast and the Durankulak Swamp or Eagles' Swamp (\u041e\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043e, *Orlovo blato*) is to the northeast, towards the Black Sea\u2014 the two are connected by an artificial but overgrown marshy canal. To the northeast of the village is also the Anna Maria beach that continues up to Sivriburun and the border. There is another beach south of the village which extends to Krapets.\n\n\nThe village has a cultural centre (*chitalishte*) with a big hall and a small hall, a museum of local history, a small art gallery and a library. There are several monuments dedicated to the peasant revolt of 1900 built in the 1970s and 1980s. The local Bulgarian Orthodox church was built in 1942.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Archaeological Complex Durankulak |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Tell Golemija ostrov (Big Island)\n |\n| ![Location of Lake Durankulak in Bulgaria](image)![Location of Lake Durankulak in Bulgaria](image)\nArchaeological Complex Durankulak\n |\n| Location | Bulgaria |\n| Coordinates | 43\u00b040\u203219\u2033N 28\u00b032\u203249\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff43.672\u00b0N 28.547\u00b0E\ufeff / 43.672; 28.547\ufeff (Lake Durankulak) |\n|  |\n| Surface area | 1.5\u00a0km2 (0.58\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n|  |\n\n\nThe Durankulak settlement commenced on a small island approximately 7000 BC and lasted for a thousand years.[1][*circular reference*] The first inhabitants were the Hamangia culture, dated from the middle of the 6th millennium to the middle of 5th millennium BC, and were the first manifestation of the Neolithic life in Dobruzha. Hamangia people were small-scale cultivators and plant collectors who built houses made pottery and herded and hunted animals. Around 4700/4600 BC stone architecture was already in general use and became a characteristic phenomenon that was unique in Europe. The settlement in Durankulak was a well-organized aggregation of buildings of substantial size with several rooms. They were coherently laid out according to a plan that was repeated over successive generations of house reconstructions. Buildings were rectilinear and large, narrow paths separated individual houses, which stood alone or abutted by other buildings. The structures were robust and made of large wooden posts sunk into foundation trenches and joined with wooden planks or branches covered with mud or clay. In all building horizons, except for the earliest ones, buildings were internally divided into separate, mainly rectilinear, rooms.\nStone structures and bases from the houses are well preserved and there is a cave and some cisterns to see. Durankulak is one of the few monuments left from early farming societies in Europe and tells us about daily life.\nThe excavation in Durankulak took part between 1974 and 1997 when 1204 prehistoric burials were carefully recorded and the remains of 21 houses were found.[2]\n\n\nThe oldest village in this place was the small village of *Kartalii* to the northeast of modern Durankulak. It was abandoned in the middle of the 19th century and had around 200\u2013300 residents, but its location meant the danger of malaria made it unsuitable for living in the summer. Some of the population of Kartalii founded Durankulak, which used to be an Ottoman farm inhabited by a few Bulgarians. The bulk of Durankulak's residents were, however, settlers from the eastern Balkan Mountains who arrived in the early 19th century. After the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, it became part of the Principality of Bulgaria and, as the largest village in the region, was a municipal centre of 12 villages. On 1 June 1900, the village was the centre of an economic revolt against the government of Todor Ivanchov and as a result, 40 people (none of them locals) were killed by the national cavalry.\n\n\nBetween 1913 and 1940, it was under Romanian rule along with all of Southern Dobruja and was renamed to *R\u0103cari*, but it was returned to Bulgaria according to the Treaty of Craiova. According to the terms of that treaty, the native Bulgarian population of Northern Dobruja was exchanged with the Romanian and Aromanian colonists sent in the south during the period of Romanian rule. As a result, some Northern Dobrujan Bulgarian refugees (\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0446\u0438, *preseltsi*) settled in Durankulak. Most of them were from Nunta\u015fi not far from the Danube Delta and today form around half of the village's population. From its return to Bulgaria to 1963, the village was known as *Blatnitsa* (\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430, \"marshy place\"), but its historic name was reinstated to commemorate the revolt of 1900. The name is of ancient origin meaning the place where the taurus knocked with his fist (hoof) and gushed water surrounded the two isles in the lake. It's like a legend of the chosen land forever giving life and prosperity. The barelefs and golden\nornamentations of tauruses were found in Thracian tombs, Romans burial barelefs, and in Varna Necropolis[3][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n## Lake Durankulak[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Lake Durankulak |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)View of Lake Durankulak\n |\n| ![Location of Lake Durankulak in Bulgaria](image)![Location of Lake Durankulak in Bulgaria](image)\nLake Durankulak\n |\n| Coordinates | 43\u00b040\u203219\u2033N 28\u00b032\u203249\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff43.672\u00b0N 28.547\u00b0E\ufeff / 43.672; 28.547\ufeff (Lake Durankulak) |\n| Basin\u00a0countries | Bulgaria |\n|  |\n| Surface area | 4\u00a0km2 (1.5\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n|  |\n| Islands | 2 (Big Island, Small Island) |\n|  |\n| Ramsar Wetland\n |\n| Official name | Durankulak Lake |\n| Designated | 28 November 1984 |\n| Reference\u00a0no. | 293[4] |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n\nThe freshwater Lake Durankulak is separated from the Black Sea by sand dunes and a beach strip, it has an area of around 4 square kilometres and features two islands in its western part, the Big Island (0.02\u00a0km2) and the Small Island (0.0053\u00a0km2). As the habitat of 260 rare and endangered species, the lake is one of the most important and well-preserved coastal wetlands in Bulgaria. Among the important birds in the area are the little bittern, ferruginous duck, mute swan, western marsh harrier, paddyfield warbler. The greater white-fronted goose, red-breasted goose and mallard spend the winter there, and there are large populations of the pygmy cormorant and great white pelican.\n\n\nThe lake is also an archaeologically important area. Pithouses of the oldest known inhabitants of Dobruja, dating to 5100\u20134700 BC, have been unearthed near the west shore, as well as 3500\u20133400 BC mound burials and a Sarmatian necropolis from Late Antiquity. The Big Island of Lake Durankulak is particularly important, as it is the site of an Eneolithic settlement of 4600\u20134200 BC, a cultural monument of national importance. The island also features a 1300\u20131200 BC fortified settlement, a Hellenistic rock-hewn cave sanctuary of Cybele (3rd century BC) and a Bulgar settlement from the 9th\u201310th century AD. Because of its age and importance, the archaeological complex has been dubbed the \"Bulgarian Troy\".[5]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** *\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0412\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043e\u0432. \u0414\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0430\u043a-\u0413\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432*\n2. **^** Todorova, H. 2002a.

Sechin Bajo is located in the valley of the Sechin River, about 12 kilometres (7.5\u00a0mi) from the Pacific Ocean and about 330 kilometres (210\u00a0mi) northwest of Lima, Peru. Sechin Bajo is one ruin among many located in close proximity to each other in the valleys of the Casma and Sechin Rivers.\n\n\nIn 2008, a German and Peruvian archaeological team, headed by Peter Fuchs, announced that a circular plaza, 10\u201312 meters (11\u201313\u00a0yd) in diameter and constructed of rocks and rectangular adobe bricks had been found at Sechin Bajo. Radiocarbon dating indicated that plaza was constructed in 3500 BCE. A nearby 2 meter-tall (2 yards) frieze was dated at 3600 BCE.[3] The plaza and the frieze are the two oldest examples of monumental architecture discovered thus far in the Americas. Sechin Bajo may contend with sites of Norte Chico as the oldest urban settlement of the Americas.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\nThe Peruvian Pacific coast is one of the driest deserts in the world with average annual precipitation of less than 10 millimetres (0.39\u00a0in).[5] Along the 1,300 kilometres (810\u00a0mi) of Peruvian coast, 57 small rivers flow into the sea, watered by the higher precipitation received in the Andes Mountains inland at elevations higher than 2,500 metres (8,200\u00a0ft). Each river valley forms a linear oasis in which irrigated agriculture is possible. The valley of the Casma River and its tributary, the Sechin River, are one of the linear oases. The ancient area of the Casma/Sechin culture extends about 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi) inland from the sea. The width of the irrigable valleys range from one to seven kilometres (0.6 to 4.3\u00a0mi).[6]\n\n\nLocated along about 4 kilometres (2.5\u00a0mi) in the Sechin River valley, just upstream from its junction with the Casma, is a complex of archaeological ruins that includes sites such as Sechin Bajo, Sechin Alto, Cerro Sechin, and Taukachi-Konkan, all of them except Sechin Alto in the desert just beyond the edge of the irrigated river valley.[7] The Casma valley was populated long before the monumental construction began. The oldest radio carbon date found at Sechin Bajo is **4500 BCE** although other signs of human occupation of the Casma valley date back to before **6,000 BCE**.[8]\n\n\nSechin Bajo is located about 130 kilometres (81\u00a0mi) north of the Norte Chico civilization, believed to be the oldest in the Americas. Given the short distances contact and transmission of cultural traits between the two areas was likely.\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\nThe ruins of Sechin Bajo cover an area of about 37 hectares (91 acres). The ceremonial center of the ruin consists of three monumental constructions dating from different times. The \"First Edifice\" or \"First Building\" is the oldest, initially consisting of a platform 16 metres (52\u00a0ft) square built of rocks and adobe brick and raised 2 meters over sunken circular plazas. The sunken circular plaza feature was maintained throughout. In one iteration, calibrated radiocarbon dating of the First Building ranges from as early as 3700 BCE and as late as 2900 BCE during the pre-ceramic (prior to the use of pottery) period of Peruvian archaeology. The First Building was reconstructed on five occasions during that time period with plazas and staircases being constructed, filled in, and reconstructed on multiple occasions.[9]\n\n\nThe oldest of the sunken plazas was radio carbon dated at 3500 BCE in 2008. An adobe frieze was dated at 3600 BCE. The frieze, 2 metres (6.6\u00a0ft) tall, is of a man holding something in one hand and something else in the other. What he is holding has been interpreted as a ritual knife or a ceremonial cane in one hand and a human head or a shield in the other hand.[10]\n\n\nThe \"Second Building\" and the \"Third Building\" were constructed much later, on top of the First Building and to cover a much larger area. They date from approximately 1600 BCE to 1200 BCE. The Third Building is the most monumental with both public squares and private areas and with many walls decorated with relief carvings. After the three buildings on the site were abandoned, they were used as a graveyard up until the fifteenth century CE.[11] The construction of the Second and Third Buildings was oriented toward Cerro Sechin, 2 kilometres (1.2\u00a0mi) distant on the other side of the Sechin Valley. That indicates cooperation (or subordination) among the builders of the two sites.[12]\n\n\nThe husband and wife archaeological team of the Pozorskis have speculated that Sechin Bajo and other Casma/Sechin cities and ceremonial centers were conquered about 1000 BCE by invaders from the highlands. The purported invaders introduced maize, domesticated animals, warlike carvings, and different styles of ceramics and architecture.[13]\n\n\n\n## Importance[edit]\n\n\nThe oldest radiocarbon dates **(3600 BCE)** of Sechin Bajo, if confirmed by additional investigations, may establish it as oldest site of monumental construction yet found in the Americas. This may mean that Sechin Bajo in the Casma and Sechin valleys may claim to be the oldest urban site in the Americas. That distinction in the early 21st century is held by the Norte Chico civilization of which the oldest ruins are dated at about 3500 BCE at Huaricanga, 130 kilometres (81\u00a0mi) south of Sechin Bajo.[14] Another relevant ancient site is Bandurria, Peru in the River Huaura valley, with radio-carbon dates of 3200 BC.\n\n\nOther important findings include confirmation that the Casma and Sechin valleys were probably occupied **c.4500 BCE** by a stable and sedentary or semi-sedentary population which eventually produced the monumental architecture found at Sechin Bajo. The date at which agriculture became the most important source of subsistence of the people of the valleys is uncertain.[15]\n\n\nThe findings at Sechin Bajo appear to contradict the theory of anthropologist Michael E. Moseley and others that the earliest civilizations in Peru were based not on agriculture, but on exploitation of the rich maritime resources of the Peruvian coastline at sites such as Las Haldas which practiced little or no agriculture. The oldest radiocarbon dates for Las Haldas, about 20 kilometres (12\u00a0mi) from Sechin Bajo, are about **2400 BCE**.[16]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of the oldest buildings in the world\n* List of oldest buildings in the Americas\n* Cerro Sech\u00edn\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Fuchs, Peter R.; Patzchke, Renate; Yenque, German; and Briceno, Jesus (2009), \"Del Arcaico Tardio al Formativo Temprano: Las Investigaciones en Sechin Bajo, Valle de Casma\", *Boletin de Arqueologia PUCP*, No. 13, p. 59\n2. **^** Pozorski, Shelia and Pozorski, Thomas, (2006) *Early Settlement and Subsistence in the Casma Valley*, Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, pp 6-7.

The 6-tier, 4-sided structure is the earliest colossal stone building in Egypt.[4] It was built in the 27th century BC during the Third Dynasty for the burial of Pharaoh Djoser. The pyramid is the central feature of a vast mortuary complex in an enormous courtyard surrounded by ceremonial structures and decoration. Its architect was Imhotep, chancellor of the pharaoh and high priest of the god Ra.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjoser's Pyramid draws ideas from several precedents. The most relevant precedent is found at Saqqara mastaba 3038 (c. 2700 BC). The substructure lay in a 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) deep rectangular pit, and had mudbrick walls rising to 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft). Three sides were extended and built out to create eight shallow steps rising at an angle of 49\u00b0. This would have been an elongated step pyramid if the remaining side had not been left uncovered. In another parallel to Djoser's complex, to complete this mastaba complex a niched enclosure wall was erected.[10]\n\n\n\n## Layout[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe pyramid went through several revisions and redevelopments of the original plan. The pyramid originally stood 62.5\u00a0m (205\u00a0ft) tall, with a base of 109\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a0121\u00a0m (358\u00a0ft \u00d7\u00a0397\u00a0ft) and was clad in polished white limestone.[5] The step pyramid (or proto-pyramid) was considered to be the earliest large-scale cut stone construction made by man as of 1997,[6] although the nearby enclosure wall \"Gisr el-Mudir\" is suggested by some Egyptologists to predate the complex, and the South American pyramids at Caral are contemporary.\n\n\nIn March 2020, the pyramid was reopened for visitors after a 14-year restoration.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Djoser[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Perspective view, plan and elevation images Djoser's Pyramid Complex taken from a 3d model\nDjoser was the first or second king of the 3rd Dynasty (c.\u20092670\u20132650 BC) of the Old Kingdom of Egypt (c.\u20092686\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20092125 BC).[1] He is believed to have ruled for 19 years or, if the 19 years were biennial taxation years, 38 years.[8] He reigned long enough to allow the grandiose plan for his pyramid to be realized in his lifetime.[9]\n\n\nDjoser is best known for his innovative tomb, which dominates the Saqqara landscape.[8] In this tomb he is referred to by his Horus name Netjerikhet; Djoser is a name given by New Kingdom visitors thousands of years later. Djoser's step pyramid is astounding in its departure from previous architecture. It sets several important precedents, perhaps the most important of which is its status as the first monumental structure made of stone.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDevelopmental phases of Djoser's step pyramid[39]\n|  | Mastaba M1 | Mastaba M2 | Mastaba M3 | Pyramid P1 | Pyramid P1' | Pyramid P2\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| **Base dimensions** | 63\u00a0m (207\u00a0ft; 120\u00a0cu) | 71.5\u00a0m (235\u00a0ft; 136\u00a0cu) | 71.5\u00a0m (235\u00a0ft; 136\u00a0cu)79.5\u00a0m (261\u00a0ft; 152\u00a0cu) | 77\u00a0m (253\u00a0ft; 147\u00a0cu)85.5\u00a0m (281\u00a0ft; 163\u00a0cu) | 108\u00a0m (354\u00a0ft; 206\u00a0cu)120\u00a0m (394\u00a0ft; 229\u00a0cu) | 109\u00a0m (358\u00a0ft; 208\u00a0cu)121\u00a0m (397\u00a0ft; 231\u00a0cu)\n |\n| **Height** | 8.4\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft; 16\u00a0cu) | 8.4\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft; 16\u00a0cu)~7.75\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft; 15\u00a0cu) | 8.4\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft; 16\u00a0cu)~7.75\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft; 15\u00a0cu)~6.25\u00a0m (21\u00a0ft; 12\u00a0cu) | 42\u00a0m (138\u00a0ft; 80\u00a0cu) | 60\u00a0m (197\u00a0ft; 115\u00a0cu) to 62.5\u00a0m (205\u00a0ft; 119\u00a0cu) | 60\u00a0m (197\u00a0ft; 115\u00a0cu) to 62.5\u00a0m (205\u00a0ft; 119\u00a0cu)\n |\n| **Masonry blocks** | 0.3\u00a0m (0.98\u00a0ft) | 0.3\u00a0m (0.98\u00a0ft) | 0.3\u00a0m (0.98\u00a0ft) | 0.38\u00a0m (1.2\u00a0ft) | 0.38\u00a0m (1.2\u00a0ft) | 0.5\u00a0m (1.6\u00a0ft) to 0.52\u00a0m (1.7\u00a0ft)\n |\n| **Volume** |  |  |  |  |  | 330,400\u00a0m3 (11,670,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Outlines of various pyramids overlaid on top of on another to show relative height](image)Comparison of approximate profiles of the Pyramid of Djoser with some notable pyramidal or near-pyramidal buildings.

The complex covers 15\u00a0ha (37 acres) and is about 2.5 times as large as the Old Kingdom town of Hierakonpolis.[9] Several features of the complex differ from those of later Old Kingdom pyramids. The pyramid temple is situated at the north side of the pyramid, whereas in later pyramids it is on the east side. Also, the Djoser complex is built on a north\u2013south axis, whereas later complexes utilize an east\u2013west axis. Furthermore, the Djoser complex has one niched enclosure wall, whereas later pyramids have two enclosure walls with the outside one being smooth and the inside one sometimes niched.[10]\n\n\n\n### Great trench[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Relief of Djoser facing the temple of Horus of Behedet (modern Edfu) in a blue faience chamber of the south tomb\nThe south tomb has been likened to the satellite pyramids of later dynasties, and has been proposed to house the ka in the afterlife. Another proposal is that it may have held the canopic jar with the king's organs, but this does not follow later trends where the canopic jar is found in the same place as the body. These proposals stem from the fact that the granite burial vault is much too small to have facilitated an actual burial.[10]\n\n\nThe substructure of the south tomb is entered through a tunnel-like corridor with a staircase that descends about 30\u00a0m before opening up into the pink granite burial chamber. The staircase then continues east and leads to a gallery that imitates the blue chambers below the step pyramid.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Shaw, Ian, ed.

Within the court are curved stones thought to be territorial markers associated with the Heb-sed festival, an important ritual completed by Egyptian kings (typically after 30 years on the throne) to renew their powers.[9] These would have allowed Djoser to claim control over all of Egypt,[9] while its presence in the funerary complex would allow Djoser to continue to benefit from the ritual in the afterlife.[41] At the southern end of the court was a platform approached by steps. It has been suggested that this was a platform for the double throne. This fits into the theory proposed by Barry Kemp, and generally accepted by many, that suggests the whole step pyramid complex symbolizes the royal palace enclosure and allows the king to eternally perform the rituals associated with kingship.[41] At the very south of the South Court lay the South Tomb.\n\n\n\n### South tomb[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBefore the enclosure wall, Djoser's pyramid complex is surrounded by a trench dug into the underlying rock. At 750\u00a0m (2,460\u00a0ft; 1,430\u00a0cu) long and 40\u00a0m (130\u00a0ft; 76\u00a0cu) wide, the trench is the largest structure of this kind in the Memphis necropolis. It is rectangular in shape, oriented on the north\u2013south axis. The trench resembles a \ud80c\ude54 (hieroglyph h) which represents the floorplan of a house. It is decorated with niches which are suggested by Nabil Swelim to have hosted the spirits of members of the king's court, there to serve the king in his afterlife. In parts, the trench doubles into two with distinct entries. These make accessing the enclosure wall more difficult, indicating its function as a safe-guard. Miroslav Verner suspects that a single entrance was built at the south-east corner granting access to the area.[42]\n\n\n\n### Enclosure wall[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe social implications of such a large and carefully sculpted stone structure are staggering.[10] The process of building such a structure would be far more labor-intensive than previous monuments of mud-brick. This suggests that the state, and therefore the royal government, had a new level of control of resources, both material and human. Also, from this point on, kings of the Old Kingdom are buried in the North, rather than at Abydos.\n\n\nAlthough the plan of Djoser's pyramid complex is different from later complexes, many elements persist and the step pyramid sets the stage for later pyramids of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Dynasties, including the great pyramids of Giza. Though the Dynastic Egyptians themselves did not credit him as such,[11] most Egyptologists credit Djoser's vizier Imhotep with the design and construction of the complex.[9]\n\n\n\n## Precedents[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEgyptologists are split on the motivations behind the conception of the pyramidal form that the mastaba was converted into.[30] Lauer believed that the alteration was made to have the tomb visible from Memphis.[29][31] The fact of the mastaba's square plan led Rainer Stadelmann, however, to suggest that it was never the intended final form and that it was planned to be a pyramid from the outset.[32] The conversion (P1) encased the mastaba (M3) extending its length by 5.76\u00a0m (19\u00a0ft; 11\u00a0cu) on each axis giving it a base length of 85.5\u00a0m (281\u00a0ft; 163\u00a0cu) by 77\u00a0m (253\u00a0ft; 147\u00a0cu).[18][33] The alteration from mastaba to pyramid came with a shift in construction.[18] The builders used larger and better quality, roughly dressed limestone blocks \u2013 but instead of horizontal beds, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDjoser's mortuary complex comprises the great trench, enclosure wall, colonnaded entrance, 'T' temple, *Sed* festival complex, north and south pavilions, south tomb and court, western mounds, mortuary temple, and the crowning feature of it all, the step pyramid with its substructure.[12][13] The complex was a landmark achievement for Egyptian architecture.[14] It was the advent of the pyramidal form of the royal tomb and the first instance of the mass use of limestone in construction,[15] replacing mudbrick which had been the staple building material prior.[16] This shift to limestone \u2013 a hard, dense material compared to mudbrick \u2013 presented novel challenges to the architects, though they kept to earlier tradition, copying architectonic elements and carving them into the stone.[15] For example, the Egyptians hand-carved 1,680 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft; 17\u00a0cu)-tall niches out of the limestone enclosure wall.[16] In earlier projects, this element was built with wooden planks, ropes, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Entry hall. Step Pyramid Complex, Saqqara\n![](image)Temples of the festival complex\n## Pyramid complex[edit]\n\n\nDjoser's Step Pyramid complex included several structures pivotal to its function in both life and the afterlife. A pyramid was not simply a grave in ancient Egypt. Its purpose was to facilitate a successful afterlife for the king so that he could be eternally reborn. The symbolism of the step pyramid form, which did not survive beyond the 3rd Dynasty, is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may be a monumental symbol of the crown, especially the royal mortuary cult, since seven small step pyramids (that were not tombs) were built in the provinces.[9] Another well accepted theory is that it facilitated the king's ascension to join the eternal North Star.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSuch statues are present in the monuments of the Fourth Dynasty, but no trace of them has been uncovered at Djoser's complex.[45][52] The end walls of the alcoves had slits cut into them near the ceiling thus allow light to filter in.[54] Near the beginning of the colonnade, at its eastern end, is a corridor which leads to the *heb-sed* court.[55] Between the twelfth and thirteenth alcove[56] is a 'transverse vestibule' with a passage flanked by eight 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) tall columns and cross-walls leading to a sanctuary.[50][57] Lauer believes this chamber contained a statue of Djoser on a pedestal that bore his name and Imhotep's titles.[51] The torso and base of this statue were found in the entrance colonnade.[19] The west wall of the entrance colonnade has the form of an open door which leads into the south court.[57]\n\n\n\n* ![Entrance](image)\n\nEntrance\n* ![Entrance colonnade of the step pyramid complex](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** Kathryn A.

At this stage the mastaba still peaked at 8.4\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft; 16\u00a0cu) in height, too short to be seen from outside the 10.5\u00a0m (34\u00a0ft; 20\u00a0cu) high enclosure wall.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| III | * Djoser\n* *Buried*\n* *Layer*\n* *Lepsius I*\n* *Athribis*\n* *Elephantine*\n* *Edfu South*\n* *el-Kula*\n* *Naqada*\n* *Saujet el-Meitin\u00a0[de]*\n* *Sinki\u00a0[de]*\n |\n| IV | * *Seila*\n* *Meidum*\n* *Bent*\n* *Red*\n* Khufu\n* Djedefre\n* *Unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet el'Aryan*\n* Khafre\n* Menkaure\n* Khentkaus I\n* *Mastabet el-Fara'un*\n* *G1-a*\n* *G1-b*\n* *G1-c*\n* *G1-d*\n* *G2-a*\n* *G3-a*\n* *G3-b*\n* *G3-c*\n* *Lepsius L*\n |\n| V | * Userkaf\n* Neferhetepes\u00a0[de]\n* Sahure\n* Neferirkare\n* Khentkaus II\n* Neferefre\n* *Unfinished*\n* Nyuserre\n* *Lepsius XXIV*\n* *Double*\n* *Headless*\n* Djedkare-Isesi\n* Unas\n |\n| VI | * Teti\n* Pepi I\n* Merenre\n* Pepi II\n* Sesheshet\n |\n\n |\n| 1st Intermediate Period(2181\u20132040 BC) | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * VIII\n | * Ity\n* Neferkare Neby\n* Ibi\n* Khui\n |\n| X | * Merikare\n |\n\n |\n| Middle Kingdom(2040\u20131650 BC) | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCurrent evidence suggests that the south tomb was finished before the pyramid. The symbolic king's inner palace, decorated in blue faience, is much more complete than that of the pyramid. Three chambers of this substructure are decorated in blue faience to imitate reed-mat facades, just like the pyramid.[10] One room is decorated with three finely niche reliefs of the king, one depicting him running the Heb-sed.[9] Importantly, Egyptian builders chose to employ their most skilled artisans and depict their finest art in the darkest, most inaccessible place in the complex. This highlights the fact that this impressive craftsmanship was not meant for the benefit of the living but was meant to ensure the king had all the tools necessary for a successful afterlife.[10]\n\n\n\n### North temple and serdab court[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnder the step pyramid is a labyrinth of tunneled chambers and galleries that total nearly 6\u00a0km in length and connect to a central shaft 7\u00a0m square and 28\u00a0m deep.[40] These spaces provide room for the king's burial, the burial of family members, and the storage of goods and offerings. The entrance to the 28\u00a0m shaft was built on the north side of the pyramid, a trend that would remain throughout the Old Kingdom. The sides of the underground passages are limestone inlaid with blue faience tile to replicate reed matting. These \"palace fa\u00e7ade\" walls are further decorated by panels decorated in low relief that show the king participating in the Heb-sed.[36] Together these chambers constitute the funerary apartment that mimicked the palace and would serve as the living place of the royal *ka*. On the east side of the pyramid, eleven shafts 32\u00a0m deep were constructed and annexed to horizontal tunnels for royal family members. These were incorporated into the pre-existing substructure as it expanded eastward. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe witnessed these ceremonies through two small eye holes cut in the north wall of the serdab.[41] This temple appeared on the north side of the pyramid throughout the Third Dynasty, as the king wished to go north to become one of the eternal stars in the North Sky that never set.[40] In the Fourth Dynasty, when there was a religious shift to an emphasis on rebirth and eternity achieved through the sun, the temple was moved to the east side of the pyramid, where the sun rises, so that through association the king may be reborn every day.[40]\n\n\n\n### Heb-sed court[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Lauer 1962, p.\u00a069.\n24. **^** Lauer 1962, p.\u00a070.\n25. **^** Edwards 1993, pp.\u00a035\u201336.\n26. **^** Lauer 1962, p.\u00a071.\n27. **^** Edwards 1993, pp.\u00a038\u201339, fig. 7:7.\n28. **^** Lauer 1962, pp.\u00a071\u201372.\n29. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Lauer 1962, p.\u00a072.\n30. **^** Verner 2001d, pp.\u00a0116\u2013117.\n31. **^** Verner 2001d, p.\u00a0116.\n32. **^** Verner 2001d, p.\u00a0117.\n33. **^** Edwards 1993, p.\u00a036.\n34. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Lauer 1962, pp.\u00a073\u201374.\n35. **^** Lehner 2008, p.\u00a016.\n36. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Dick Parry, *Engineering the Pyramids* (Phoenix: Sutton Publishing Limited, 2004), 14\n37. **^** Dieter Arnold, *Building in Egypt, Pharaonic Stone Masonry* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), 79\u2013101.\n38. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Martin Isler, *Sticks, Stones, and Shadows: Building the Egyptian Pyramids* (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2001), 90\u201399.\n39. **^** Lauer 1962, pp.\u00a069\u201374; Verner 2001d, p.\u00a0461; Lehner 2008, p.\u00a017.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Bard, Kathryn (2015) [2008]. *An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt* (second\u00a0ed.).

An extensive network of underground galleries was located to the north, west and south of the central burial chamber and crude horizontal magazines were carved into these.[10]\n\n\n\n### Burial chamber[edit]\n\n\nThe burial chamber was a vault constructed of four courses of well-dressed granite. It had one opening, which was sealed with a 3.5 ton block after the burial.[8] No body was recovered as the tomb had been extensively robbed. Lauer believes that a burial chamber of alabaster existed before the one of granite. He found interesting evidence of limestone blocks with five pointed stars in low relief that were likely on the ceiling, indicating the first occurrence of what would become a tradition.[10] The king sought to associate himself with the eternal North Stars that never set so as to ensure his rebirth and eternity.[41]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe northern (funerary/mortuary) temple was on the north side of the pyramid and faced the north stars, which the king wished to join in eternity. This structure provided a place in which the daily rituals and offerings to the dead could be performed, and was the cult center for the king. To the east of the temple is the serdab, which is a small enclosed structure that housed the *ka* statue. The king's *ka* inhabited the *ka* statue, in order to benefit from daily ceremonies like the opening of the mouth, a ceremony that allowed him to breathe and eat, and the burning of incense. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n40. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Miroslav Verner, *The Pyramids* (New York: Grove Press, 1998), 105\u2013139.\n41. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Gay Robins, *The Art of Ancient Egypt* (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2000), 40\u201345.\n42. **^** Verner 2001d, pp.\u00a0110\u2013111.\n43. **^** Edwards 1993, pp.\u00a050\u201351.\n44. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Edwards 1993, p.\u00a051.\n45. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** Verner 2001d, p.\u00a0112.\n46. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Spencer 1993, pp.\u00a098\u201399.\n47. **^** Robins 1997, p.\u00a040.\n48. **^** Siliotti & Hawass 1997, pp.\u00a0105\u2013113.\n49. **^** Bard 2015, p.\u00a0142, fig. 6.2.\n50. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Verner 2001d, p.\u00a0113.\n51. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Lauer 1999, p.\u00a0861.\n52. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Edwards 1993, p.\u00a047.\n53. **^** Bard 2015, p.\u00a0143.\n54. **^** Edwards 1993, pp.\u00a047\u201348.\n55. **^** Edwards 1993, p.\u00a046.\n56. **^** Lauer 1962, p.\u00a0111.\n57. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Edwards 1993, p.\u00a048.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nand poles hung with reed mats.[15] In a modern context, the same element would be built by laying out the blocks to form the recesses.[16]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\nComplex layout: 1) step pyramid, 2) south tomb and chapel, 3) *Sed* festival complex, 4) 'T' temple, 5) south court, 6) south pavilion, 7) north pavilion, 8) mortuary temple, 9) western mounds, 10) colonnaded entrance, 11) north court, 12) north galleries, 13) step tombs, 14) serdab, and 15) north altar\n\n\n## Step pyramid[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
