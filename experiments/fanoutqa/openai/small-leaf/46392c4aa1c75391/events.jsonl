It is the fifth largest desert in the world and the largest in Asia. At its center is *Ar-Rub' al-Khali* (The Empty Quarter), one of the largest continuous bodies of sand in the world. It is an extension of the Sahara Desert.[4]\n\n\nGazelles, oryx, sand cats, and spiny-tailed lizards are just some of the desert-adapted species that survive in this extreme environment, which features everything from red dunes to deadly quicksand. The climate is mostly dry (the major part receives around 100 mm (3.9 in) of rain per year, but some very rare places receive as little as 50 mm), and temperatures oscillate between very high heat and seasonal night time freezes. It is part of the deserts and xeric shrublands biome and lie in biogeographical realms of the Palearctic (northern part) and Afrotropical (southern part).\n\n\nThe Arabian Desert ecoregion has little biodiversity, although a few endemic plants grow here. Many species, such as the striped hyena, jackal and honey badger have died out as a result of hunting, habitat destruction, overgrazing by livestock, off-road driving, and human encroachment on their habitat. Other species, such as the Arabian sand gazelle, have been successfully re-introduced and are protected at reserves.\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A satellite image of the Arabian Desert by NASA World Wind\nThe desert lies mostly in Saudi Arabia and covers most of the country. It extends into neighboring southern Iraq, southern Jordan, central Qatar, most of the Abu Dhabi emirate in the United Arab Emirates, western Oman, and northeastern Yemen. The ecoregion also includes most of the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt and the adjacent Negev desert in southern Israel.[1]\n\n\nThe Rub' al-Khali desert is a sedimentary basin stretching along a south-west to north-east axis across the Arabian Shelf.[5] At an altitude of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft), rock landscapes yield to the Rub' al-Khali, a vast stretch of sand whose extreme southern point crosses the center of Yemen. The sand overlies gravel or gypsum plains and the dunes reach maximum heights of up to 250 m (820 ft). The sands are predominantly silicates, composed of 80 to 90% quartz and the remainder feldspar, whose iron oxide-coated grains color the sands orange, purple, and red.\n\n\nA corridor of sandy terrain known as the Ad-Dahna desert connects the An-Nafud desert (65,000 km2 or 40,389 square miles) in the north of Saudi Arabia to the Rub' al-Khali in the south-east.[*citation needed*] The Tuwaiq escarpment is an 800 km (500 mi) arc that includes limestone cliffs, plateaus, and canyons.[*citation needed*] There are brackish salt flats, including the quicksands of Umm al Samim.[2] The Wahiba Sands of Oman are an isolated sand sea bordering the east coast.[6][7]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nThe Arabian Desert has a subtropical, hot desert climate, similar to the climate of the Sahara Desert (the world's largest hot desert). The Arabian Desert is actually an extension of the Sahara Desert over the Arabian peninsula. \n\n\nThe climate is mainly dry. Most areas get around 100 mm (3.9 in) of rain per year. Unlike the Sahara Desert—more than half of which is hyperarid (having rainfall of less than 50 mm (2.0 in) per year)—the Arabian Desert has only a few hyperarid areas. These rare driest areas may get only 30 to 40 mm (1.6 in) of rain per year. \n\n\nThe Arabian Desert’s sunshine duration index is very high by global standards: between 2,900 hours (66.2% of daylight hours) and 3,600 hours (82.1% of daylight hours), but typically around 3,400 hours (77.6% of daylight hours). Thus clear-sky conditions with plenty of sunshine prevail over the region throughout the year, and cloudy periods are infrequent. Visibility at ground level is relatively low, despite the brightness of the sun and moon, because of dust and humidity. \n\n\nTemperatures remain high year round. In the summer, in low-lying areas, average high temperatures are generally over 40 °C (104 °F). In extremely low-lying areas, especially along the Persian Gulf (near sea level), summer temperatures can reach 48 °C (118 °F). Average low temperatures in summer are typically over 20 °C (68 °F) and in the south can sometimes exceed 30 °C (86 °F). Record high temperatures above 50 °C (122 °F) have been reached in many areas of the desert, partly because its overall elevation is relatively low. [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nThe Arabian Desert ecoregion has about 900 species of plants.[8] The Rub'al-Khali has very limited floristic diversity. There are only 37 plant species, 20 recorded in the main body of the sands and 17 around the outer margins. Of these 37 species, one or two are endemic. Vegetation is very diffuse but fairly evenly distributed, with some interruptions of near sterile dunes.[2] Some typical plants are *Calligonum crinitum* on dune slopes, *Cornulaca arabica* (saltbush), *Salsola stocksii* (saltbush), and *Cyperus conglomeratus*. Other widespread species are *Dipterygium glaucum, Limeum arabicum*, and *Zygophyllum mandavillei*.\nVery few trees are found except at the outer margin (typically *Acacia ehrenbergiana* and *Prosopis cineraria*). Other species are a woody perennial *Calligonum comosum*, and annual herbs such as *Danthonia forskallii*.[2]\n\n\nThere are 102 native species of mammals.[8] Native mammals include the Arabian oryx (*Oryx leucoryx*), sand gazelle (*Gazella marica*), mountain gazelle (*G. gazella*), Nubian ibex (*Capra nubiana*), Arabian wolf (*Canis lupus arabs*), striped hyaena (*Hyaena hyaena*), caracal (*Caracal caracal*), sand cat (*Felis margarita*), red fox (*Vulpes vulpes*), and Cape hare (*Lepus capensis*).[2] The Asiatic cheetah[9] and Asiatic lion[10] used to live in the Arabian Desert. The ecoregion is home to 310 bird species.[8]\n\n\n\n## People[edit]\n\n\nThe area is home to several different cultures, languages, and peoples, with Islam as the predominant faith. The major ethnic group in the region is the Arabs, whose primary language is Arabic.\n\n\nIn the center of the desert lies Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, with more than 7 million inhabitants.[11] Other large cities, such as Dubai, Abu Dhabi, or Kuwait City, lie on the coast of the Persian Gulf.\n\n\n\n## Natural resources[edit]\n\n\nNatural resources available in the Arabian Desert include oil, natural gas, phosphates, and sulfur.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Conservation and threats[edit]\n\n\nThreats to the ecoregion include overgrazing by livestock and feral camels and goats, wildlife poaching, and damage to vegetation by off-road driving.[2]\n\n\nThe conservation status of the desert is critical/endangered. In the UAE, the sand gazelle and Arabian oryx are threatened, and honey badgers, jackals, and striped hyaenas already extirpated.[2]\n\n\n\n### Protected areas[edit]\n\n\n4.37% of the ecoregion is in protected areas.[1]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has established a system of reserves overseen by the National Commission for Wildlife Conservation and Development (NCWCD).[2]\n\n\n\n* Harrat al-Harrah Reserve (12,150 km2), established in 1987, is on the border with Jordan and Iraq, and protects a portion of the stony basaltic Harrat al-Sham desert. The reserve includes rough terrain of black basaltic boulders and extinct volcanic cones from the middle Miocene. It provides habitat to over 250 species of plants, 50 species of birds, and 22 mammal species.[2]\n* 'Uruq Bani Ma'arid Reserve (12,000 km2) is on the western edge of the Rub’ al-Khali. Arabian oryx and sand gazelle were reintroduced to the reserve in 1995.\n* Ibex Reserve (200 km2) is south of Riyadh. It protects Nubian ibex and a reintroduced population of mountain gazelle.[2]\n* Al-Tabayq Special Nature Reserve is in northern Saudi Arabia, and protects a population of Nubian ibex.[2]\n\n\nProtected areas in the United Arab Emirates include Al Houbara Protected Area (2492.0 km2), Al Ghadha Protected Area (1087.51 km2), Arabian Oryx Protected Area (5974.47 km2), Ramlah Protected Area (544.44 km2), and Al Beda'a Protected Area (417.0 km2).[12]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Saudi Arabia portal\n\n\n* ʿĀd\n* Iram of the Pillars\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Arabian Desert and East Sahero-Arabian xeric shrublands\".

They are occasionally visited by snow leopards, Gobi bears, and wolves. Lizards are especially well-adapted to the climate of the Gobi Desert, with approximately 30 species distributed across its southern Mongolian border.[10] The most common vegetation in the Gobi desert are shrubs adapted to drought.[11] These shrubs included gray sparrow's saltwort (*Salsola passerina*), gray sagebrush, and low grasses such as needle grass and bridlegrass. Due to livestock grazing, the amount of shrubs in the desert has decreased.[11] Several large nature reserves have been established in the Gobi, including Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park, Great Gobi A and Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough the southeast monsoons reach the southeast parts of the Gobi, the area throughout this region is generally characterized by extreme dryness, especially during the winter, when the Siberian anticyclone is at its strongest. The southern and central parts of the Gobi Desert have variable plant growth due to this monsoon activity. The more northern areas of the Gobi are very cold and dry, making it unable to support much plant growth; this cold and dry weather is attributed to Siberian-Mongolian high pressure cells.[7] Hence, the icy dust and snowstorms of spring and early summer[2] plus early January (winter).\n\n\n\n## Conservation, ecology, and economy[edit]\n\n\nThe Gobi Desert is the source of many important fossils finds, including the first dinosaur eggs, twenty-six of which, averaging 23 centimetres (9 in) in length, were uncovered in 1923.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Sternberg, Troy; Rueff, Henri; Middleton, Nick (2015-01-26). \"Contraction of the Gobi Desert, 2000–2012\". *Remote Sensing*. **7** (2): 1346–1358.

The Kuruk-tagh is throughout a relatively low, but almost completely barren range, being entirely destitute of animal life, save for hares, antelopes and wild camels, which frequent its few small, widely scattered oases. The vegetation, which is confined to these same areas, is of the scantiest and is mainly confined to bushes of saxaul *(Haloxylon)*, *anabasis*, reeds (kamish), tamarisks, poplars, and Ephedra.[2]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nThere is little information about early habitation of the Gobi desert. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> The structure here is that of the mighty T'ien Shan, or Heavenly Mountains, running from west to east. It divides the northern one-third of Sinkiang from the southern two-thirds. On the northern side, rivers formed from the snow and glaciers of the high mountains break through barren foothill ranges and flow out into an immense, hollow plain. Here the rivers begin to straggle and fan out, and form great marshes with dense reed-beds. Westerners call this terrain the Dzungarian desert. The Chinese also call it a desert, but the Mongols call it a 'gobi'—that is, a land of thin herbage, more suitable for camels than for cows, but capable also, if herds are kept small and moved frequently, of sustaining horses, sheep, and goats. The herbage comprises a high proportion of woody, fragrant plants. Gobi mutton is the most aromatic in the world.[20]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Gobi by NASA World Wind\n![](image)Sand dunes in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China\n![](image)Flaming Cliffs in Mongolia\n![](image)Sacred ovoo in the Gobi Desert\n![](image)The sand dunes of Khongoryn Els, Gurvansaikhan NP, Mongolia\n![](image)Remains of the Great Wall of China in the Gobi Desert\nThe Gobi is overall a cold desert, with frost and occasionally snow occurring on its dunes. Besides being quite far north, it is also located on a plateau roughly 910–1,520 m (2,990–4,990 ft) above sea level, which contributes to its low temperatures. An average of about 194 mm (7.6 in) of rain falls annually in the Gobi. Additional moisture reaches parts of the Gobi in winter as snow is blown by the wind from the Siberian Steppes. These winds may cause the Gobi to reach −40 °C (−40 °F) in winter to 45 °C (113 °F) in summer.[5]\n\n\nHowever, the climate of the Gobi is one of great extremes,[2] with rapid changes of temperature[2] of as much as 35 °C (63 °F) in 24-hour spans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCharacteristic of the flora are wild garlic, *Kalidium gracile*, wormwood, saxaul, *Nitraria schoberi*, *Caragana*, Ephedra, saltwort and the grass *Lasiagrostis splendens*.[2] The taana wild onion *Allium polyrrhizum* is the main browse eaten by many herd animals, and Mongolians claim that this is essential in producing the proper, hazelnut-like notes of camel airag (fermented milk).\n\n\nThe vast desert is crisscrossed by several trade routes, some of which have been in use for thousands of years. Among the most important are those from Kalgan (at the Great Wall) to Ulaanbaatar (960 km (597 mi)); from Jiuquan (in Gansu) to Hami 670 km (416 mi); from Hami to Beijing (2,000 km (1,243 mi)); from Hohhot to Hami and Barkul; and from Lanzhou (in Gansu) to Hami.[2]\n\n\n\n### Alashan Plateau semi-desert[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Alashan Plateau semi-desert\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Eastern Asia | * Alashan Plateau semi-desert\n* Dzungaria\n* Eastern Gobi desert steppe\n* Gobi Lakes Valley desert steppe\n* Great Lakes Basin desert steppe\n* Qaidam Basin\n* Taklamakan Desert\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld deserts\n |\n| --- |\n| * Desert\n* Desertification\n* Polar desert\n* List of deserts\n* List of deserts by area\n* Desert exploration\n |\n| Africa | * Algerian\n* Bayuda\n* Black Desert\n* Blue\n* Chalbi\n* Danakil\n* Djurab\n* Eastern\n* Ferlo\n* Farafra (White)\n* Kalahari\n* Libyan\n* Moçâmedes\n* Namib\n* Nubian\n* Nyiri\n* Plaine des Sables\n* Richtersveld\n* Sahara\n* Tanezrouft\n* Ténéré\n* Western\n |\n| Asia | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Chao SC (1984). \"The sandy deserts and the gobi of China\".

They are Oasis I, Oasis II, Oasis III. [21][22]\n\n\nOasis I is equivalent to the Mesolithic from 13500 cal BP to 8000 cal BP. During this time people began using oases. It is characterized by:\n\n\n\n* micro blades\n* small milling stones\n* small tools\n* plain, low fired, pottery with high organic content.[21]\n\n\nOasis II is equivalent to the Neolithic from 8000 cal BP to 5000 cal BP. People used the oases extensively. It was characterized by: \n\n\n\n* micro blades\n* milling stones\n* chipped macro tools\n* adzes\n* axes\n* high quality cryptocrystallines\n* honeycomb imprinted, corded, string paddled, low and high fired pottery with a sand and gravel mixture. [21]\n\n\nStarting around 8000 cal BP there was a warm wet phase in the Gobi desert. [22]By 7500 cal BP lake levels in the Western Gobi reached their peak. Around this time there was meadow steppe vegetation around lakes. In Ulaan Nuur there may have been shrubby riparian woodlands.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** F. Yu, K. P. Price, J.

The desert is widest in the west, along the line joining the Lake Bosten and the Lop Nor (87°–89° east).[2] In 2007, it occupied an arc of land[3] in area.\n\n\nIn its broadest definition, the Gobi includes the long stretch of desert extending from the foot of the Pamirs (77° east) to the Greater Khingan Mountains, 116–118° east, on the border of Manchuria; and from the foothills of the Altay, Sayan, and Yablonoi mountain ranges[2] on the north to the Kunlun, Altyn-Tagh, and Qilian mountain ranges, which form the northern edges of the Tibetan Plateau, on the south.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPalearctic deserts and xeric shrublands ecoregions\n |\n| --- |\n| Africa | * Atlantic coastal desert\n* North Saharan steppe and woodlands\n* Red Sea coastal desert\n* Sahara desert\n* South Saharan steppe and woodlands\n* Tibesti–Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands\n* West Saharan montane xeric woodlands\n |\n| Western Asia | * Arabian Desert\n* Azerbaijan shrub desert and steppe\n* Central Persian desert basins\n* Mesopotamian shrub desert\n* Persian Gulf desert and semi-desert\n* Red Sea Nubo–Sindian tropical desert and semi-desert\n* South Iran Nubo–Sindian desert and semi-desert\n |\n| Central Asia | * Afghan Mountains semi-desert\n* Badghyz and Karabil semi-desert\n* Baluchistan xeric woodlands\n* Caspian lowland desert\n* Central Afghan Mountains xeric woodlands\n* Central Asian northern desert\n* Central Asian riparian woodlands\n* Central Asian southern desert\n* Kazakh semi-desert\n* Kopet Dag semi-desert\n* Paropamisus xeric woodlands\n* Registan–North Pakistan sandy desert\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Alxa Left Banner, Inner Mongolia, China\nThe southwestern portion of the Gobi, known also as the Xitao and the Little Gobi, fills the space between the great north loop of the Yellow River on the east, the Ejin River on the west, and the Qilian Mountains and narrow rocky chain of Longshou, 3,200 to 3,500 m (10,500 to 11,500 ft) in altitude, on the southwest. The Ordos Desert, which covers the northeastern portion of the Ordos Plateau, in the great north loop of the Yellow River, is part of this ecoregion. It belongs to the middle basin of the three great depressions into which Potanin divides the Gobi as a whole.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe area is vulnerable to trampling by livestock and off-road vehicles (effects from human intervention are greater in the eastern Gobi Desert, where rainfall is heavier and may sustain livestock). In Mongolia, grasslands have been degraded by goats, which are raised by nomadic herders as source of cashmere wool.[12]\n\n\nLarge copper deposits are being mined by Rio Tinto Group.[13] The mine was and remains controversial. There was significant opposition in Mongolia's parliament to the terms under which the mine will proceed, and some are calling for the terms to be renegotiated. Specifically, the contention revolves primarily around the question of whether negotiations were fair (Rio Tinto is far better resourced) and whether Rio Tinto will pay adequate taxes on the revenues it derives from the mine (an agreement was reached whereby the operation will be exempt from windfall tax).[14]\n\n\n\n## Desertification[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Gobi Desert is expanding through desertification, most rapidly on the southern edge into China, which is seeing 3,600 km2 (1,390 sq mi) of grassland overtaken every year. Dust storms increased in frequency between 1996 and 2016, causing further damage to China's agriculture economy. However, in some areas desertification has been slowed or reversed.[15]\n\n\nThe northern and eastern boundaries between desert and grassland are constantly changing. This is mostly due to the climate conditions before the growing season, which influence the rate of evapotranspiration and subsequent plant growth.[16]\n\n\nThe expansion of the Gobi is attributed mostly to human activities, locally driven by deforestation, overgrazing, and depletion of water resources, as well as to climate change.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOasis III is equivalent to the Bronze Age from 5000 cal BP to 3000 cal BP. It is characterized by:\n\n\n\n* micro blades\n* chipped micro tools\n* bifacially flakes arrowheads\n* blades\n* knives\n* grinding stones\n* copper slag\n* high quality chalcedony\n* bone beads,\n* clay spindle whorls\n* plain, string paddled, moulded rim, painted, geometrically incised, high and low fired pottery with mixture of sand, gravel, mica, shells, and fiber. [21]\n\n\nBronze Age herder burials have been found in the Gobi desert, as well as Karasuk bronze knives, and Mongolian deer stones. [21] Between 5000 cal BP and 4500 cal BP there was a period of desertification. [21][22] Due to the increasing aridity between 3500 cal BP and 3000 cal BP there was a decline in human habitation in the Gobi desert. [21]\n\n\n\n### European and American exploration[edit]\n\n\nThe Gobi had a long history of human habitation, mostly by nomadic peoples. The name of Gobi means desert in Mongolian.

The elevations do not form continuous chains, but make up a congeries of short ridges and groups rising from a common base and intersected by a labyrinth of ravines, gullies, glens, and basins. But the tablelands, built up of the horizontal red deposits of the Han-gai (Obruchev's Gobi formation) which are characteristic of the southern parts of eastern Mongolia, are absent here or occur only in one locality, near the Shara-muren river. They are greatly intersected by gullies or dry watercourses. Water is scarce, with no streams, no lakes, no wells, and precipitation falls seldom. The prevailing winds blow from the west and northwest, and the pall of dust overhangs the country as in the Taklamakan and the desert of Lop. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"Topographically,\" says Nikolai Przhevalsky, \"it is a perfectly level plain, which in all probability once formed the bed of a huge lake or inland sea.\" He concludes this based on the level area of the region as a whole, the hard saline clay and the sand-strewn surface and, lastly, the salt lakes which occupy its lowest parts. For hundreds of kilometers, nothing can be seen but bare sands; in some places, they continue so far without a break that the Mongols call them *Tengger* (i.e. sky). These vast expanses are absolutely waterless, nor do any oases relieve the unbroken stretches of yellow sand, which alternate with equally vast areas of saline clay or, nearer the foot of the mountains, with barren shingle. Although on the whole a level country with a general altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 m (3,300 to 4,900 ft), this section, like most other parts of the Gobi, is crowned by a network of hills and broken ranges of at least 300 m in elevation. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChina has tried various plans to slow the expansion of the desert, which have met with some success.[17] The Three-North Shelter Forest Program (or \"Green Great Wall\") is a Chinese government tree-planting project begun in 1978 and set to continue through 2050. The goal of the program is to reverse desertification by planting aspen and other fast-growing trees on some 36.5 million hectares across some 551 counties in 12 provinces of northern China.[18][19]\n\n\n\n## Ecoregions[edit]\n\n\nThe Gobi, broadly defined, can be divided into five distinct dry ecoregions, based on variations in climate and topography:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arabian Peninsula | * Ad-Dahna\n* Nefud\n* Arabian\n* Judaean\n* Negev\n* Ramlat al-Sab'atayn\n* Rub' al Khali\n* Syrian\n* Wahiba Sands\n |\n| Central Asia | * Aral Karakum\n* Aralkum\n* Barsuki\n* Betpak-Dala\n* Dasht-e Naomid\n* Karakum\n* Kyzylkum\n* Moiynkum\n* Ryn\n* Saryesik-Atyrau\n* Sarykum\n* Taukum\n* Ustyurt\n |\n| East Asia | * Badain Jaran\n* Gobi\n* Gurbantünggüt\n* Hami\n* Lop\n* Kumtag\n* Ordos\n\t+ Kubuqi\n\t+ Mu Us\n* Qaidam\n* Taklamakan\n* Tengger\n |\n| South Asia | * Cholistan\n* Indus Valley\n* Katpana\n* Kharan\n* Thal\n* Thar\n |\n| Iranian Plateau | * Kavir\n* Khash\n* Leili\n* Lut\n* Margo\n* Naomid\n* Polond\n* Registan\n |\n| Southeast Asia | * La Paz\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTo this great swelling, which arches up between the two border-ranges of the Chol-tagh and Kuruk-tagh, the Mongols give the name of *Ghashuun-Gobi* or \"Salt Desert\".

Down its middle runs a broad stony valley, 40 to 80 km (25 to 50 mi) wide, at an elevation of 900 to 1,370 m (2,950 to 4,490 ft). The Chol-tagh, which reaches an average altitude of 1,800 m (5,900 ft), is absolutely sterile, and its northern foot rests upon a narrow belt of barren sand, which leads down to the depressions mentioned above.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_lgya8XzjIVLKB66n10HntOel","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Previously havens for wild animals from elephants to giraffes, and for predators such as lions and cheetahs, the riverbeds are now mostly grazing spots. However, leopards and cheetahs can still be found. The area is now heavily grazed, and cattle fences restrict wildlife movement. Among deserts of the Southern Hemisphere, the Kalahari most closely resembles some Australian deserts in its latitude and mode of formation.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Kalahari has had a complex climatic history over the past million or so years, in line with major global changes. Changes in the last 250,000 years have been reconstructed from various data sources, providing evidence of former extensive lakes and drier periods. During the latter, the area of the Kalahari has expanded to include parts of western Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Angola.[12]\n\n\n\n## Vegetation and flora[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Devil's thorn flower (Tribulus zeyheri) growing in the Kalahari Desert\n![](image)Camel thorn scattered on dunes in the Kalahari Desert\nDue to its low aridity, the Kalahari supports a variety of flora. The native flora includes acacia trees and many other herbs and grasses.[13] The kiwano fruit, also known as the horned melon, melano, African horned cucumber, jelly melon, or hedged gourd, is endemic to a region in the Kalahari Desert (specific region unknown).[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA semi-desert, with huge tracts of excellent grazing after good rains, the Kalahari supports more animals and plants than a true desert, such as the Namib Desert to the west. There is little rainfall, and the summer temperature is very high. The driest areas usually receive 110–200 millimetres (4.3–7.9 in) of rain per year,[1] and the wettest just a little over 500 millimetres (20 in). The surrounding Kalahari Basin covers over 2,500,000 square kilometres (970,000 sq mi) extending farther into Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa, encroaching into parts of Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough there are few endemic species, a wide variety of species are found in the region, including large predators such as the lion (*Panthera leo*), cheetah (*Acinonyx jubatus*), leopard (*Panthera pardus*), spotted hyena (*Crocuta crocuta*), brown hyena (*Parahyaena brunnea*), and African wild dog (*Lycaon pictus pictus*). Birds of prey include the secretary bird (*Sagittarius serpentarius*), martial eagle (*Polemaetus bellicosus*) and other eagles, the giant eagle owl (*Bubo lacteus*) and other owls, falcons, goshawks, kestrels, and kites. Other animals include wildebeest, springbok, gemsbok and other antelopes, porcupines (*Hystrix africaeaustralis*), and ostriches (*Struthio camelus*).[17]\n\n\nSome of the areas within the Kalahari are seasonal wetlands, such as the Makgadikgadi Pans of Botswana. This area, for example, supports numerous halophilic species, and in the rainy season, tens of thousands of flamingos visit these pans.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn an area of about 600,000 km2 in the south and west of the Kalahari, the vegetation is mainly xeric savanna. This area is the ecoregion identified by World Wide Fund for Nature as Kalahari xeric savanna AT1309. Typical savanna grasses include *Schmidtia*, *Stipagrostis*, *Aristida*, and *Eragrostis*; these are interspersed with trees such as camelthorn (*Acacia erioloba*), grey camelthorn (*Acacia haematoxylon*), shepherd's tree (*Boscia albitrunca*), blackthorn (*Acacia mellifera*), and silver cluster-leaf (*Terminalia sericea*).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe biggest threat to wildlife are the fences erected to manage herds of grazing cattle, which also removes the plant cover of the savanna itself. Cattle ranchers will also poison or hunt down predators from the rangeland, particularly targeting jackals and wild dogs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* ![Oryx gazella](image)\n\nOryx gazella\n* ![A meerkat in the Kalahari](image)\n\nA meerkat in the Kalahari\n* ![The endangered African wild dog in Central Kalahari Game Reserve](image)\n\nThe endangered African wild dog in Central Kalahari Game Reserve\n\n\n## Protected areas[edit]\n\n\nThe following protected areas were established in the Kalahari:\n\n\n\n* Central Kalahari Game Reserve\n* Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park\n* Khutse Game Reserve\n* Tswalu Kalahari\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn certain areas where the climate is drier, it becomes a true semi-desert with ground not entirely covered by vegetation: \"open\" as opposed to \"closed\" vegetation. Examples include the north of the ZF Mgcawu District Municipality, itself in the north of South Africa, and the Keetmanshoop Rural in the southeast of Namibia. In the north and east, dry forests cover an area of over 300,000 km2 in which Rhodesian teak and several species of acacia are prominent. These regions are termed Kalahari Acacia-Baikiaea woodlands AT0709.[16]\n\n\nOutside the Kalahari \"desert\", but in the Kalahari basin, halophytic vegetation to the north is adapted to pans, lakes that are completely dry during the dry season, and maybe for years during droughts, such as in Etosha (Etosha Pan halophytics AT0902) and Makgadikgadi (Zambezian halophytics AT0908).[16]\n\n\nA totally different vegetation is adapted to the perennial fresh water of the Okavango Delta, an ecoregion termed Zambezian flooded grasslands AT0907.[16]\n\n\n\n## Fauna[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)\nKalahari in Namibia\n![](image)\nBird's eye view of the Kalahari in Namibia: the darker dots are camel thorns\n![](image)\nKalahari claypan near Onderombapa\n\nDrainage of the desert is by dry black valleys, seasonally inundated pans, and the large salt pans of the Makgadikgadi Pan in Botswana and Etosha Pan in Namibia. The only permanent river, the Okavango, flows into a delta in the northwest, forming marshes that are rich in wildlife. Ancient dry riverbeds—called omuramba—traverse the central northern reaches of the Kalahari and provide standing pools of water during the rainy season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSemi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa\n\n\"Kalahari\" redirects here.

The main region that lacks ground cover is in the southwest Kalahari (southeast of Namibia, northwest of South Africa, and southwest of Botswana) in the south of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. For instance, in the ZF Mgcawu District Municipality of South Africa, total vegetation cover may be as low as 30.72% on non-protected (from cattle grazing) farmlands south of Twee Rivieren Rest Camp and 37.74% in the protected (from cattle grazing) South African side of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park:[15] these southernmost Kalahari xeric savanna areas are truly semi-deserts. However, in all the remaining Kalahari, except on salt pans during the dry season, the vegetation cover can be denser, up to almost 100%, in some limited areas.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)San man collecting devil's claw (2017)\nThe San people have lived in the Kalahari for 20,000 years as hunter-gatherers.[19] They hunt wild game with bows and poison arrows and gather edible plants, such as berries, melons and nuts, as well as insects. The San get most of their water requirements from plant roots and desert melons found on or under the desert floor. They often store water in the blown-out shells of ostrich eggs. The San live in huts built from local materials—the frame is made of branches, and the roof is thatched with long grass. Most of their hunting and gathering techniques replicate pre-historic tribes. Bantu-speaking Tswana, Kgalagadi, and Herero and a small number of European settlers also live in the Kalahari desert. The city of Windhoek is situated in the Kalahari Basin.\n\n\n\n## Kalahari, San and diamonds[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Ancestral land conflict in Botswana\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Kalahari* is derived from the Tswana word *Kgala*, meaning \"the great thirst\", or *Kgalagadi*, meaning \"a waterless place\";[1] the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

Such reserves may partly be the residues of ancient lakes; the Kalahari Desert was once a much wetter place. The ancient Lake Makgadikgadi dominated the area, covering the Makgadikgadi Pan and surrounding areas, but it drained or dried out some 10,000 years ago. It may have once covered as much as 120,000 square kilometres (46,000 sq mi).[10] In ancient times, there was sufficient moisture for farming, with dikes and dams collecting the water. These are now filled with sediment, breached, or no longer in use, though they can be readily seen via Google Earth.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Kalahari-Basin\". 15 July 2010.

This and other pans, as well as river bottoms, were written about extensively at Sciforums by an article by Walter Wagner regarding the extensive formerly wet areas of the Kalahari. The Kalahari is extensive and extends farther north, where abandoned extensive roadways also exist.[3][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Heavy thunderstorm near Stampriet\nThe dry season lasts eight months or more, and the wet season typically from less than one month to four months, depending on location. The southwestern Kalahari is the driest area, particularly a small region toward the west-southwest of Tsaraxaibis (Southeast of Namibia). The average annual rainfall ranges from around 110 mm (close to aridity) to more than 500 mm in some north and east areas. During summertime in all regions, rainfall may go with heavy thunderstorms. In the driest and sunniest parts of the Kalahari, over 4,000 hours of sunshine are recorded annually on average.\n\n\nIn the Kalahari, there are three main mechanisms of atmospheric circulation, dominated by the Kalahari High anticyclone[6] in winter, and by the Kalahari Heat Low in summer:[7]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The North and Northwest of the Kalahari are subject to the alternation \"Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)/\"Continental Trade winds\". The ITCZ is the meeting area of the boreal trade winds with their austral counterparts what meteorologists call \"Meteorological equator\" and the sailors \"Doldrum\" or \"Pot-au-noir\" : the ITCZ generates rains in the wet season, whereas the continental trade winds cause the dry season;\n* The rest of the Kalahari is subject to the maritime trade winds that largely shed their moisture as they cross up and over the Southern African Great Escarpment before arriving over the Kalahari.\n* In the southern hemisphere summer (from December to February), a low-pressure system develops over the Kalahari, which is driven by strong surface heating (known as a Thermal Low). The low-pressure system helps to control the moisture-bearing easterly wind emanating from the Indian Ocean,[8] thus influencing rainfall across southern Africa.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Kwaggarug Mountain Desert\n* Namib Lichen Fields\n* Noms Mountain Desert\n* Northern Nababiepsberge Mountain Desert\n* Richtersberg Mountain Desert\n* Richtersveld Sheet Wash Desert\n* Southern Nababiepsberge Mountain Desert\n* Western Gariep Hills Desert\n* Western Gariep Lowland Desert\n* Western Gariep Plains Desert\n |\n| Azonal | * Albany Alluvial Vegetation\n* Albany Dune Strandveld\n* Algoa Dune Strandveld\n* Arid Estuarine Salt Marshes\n* Bushmanland Vloere\n* Cape Estuarine Salt Marshes\n* Cape Inland Salt Pans\n* Cape Lowland Alluvial Vegetation\n* Cape Lowland Freshwater Wetlands\n* Cape Seashore Vegetation\n* Cape Vernal Pools\n* Drakensberg Wetlands\n* Eastern Temperate Freshwater Wetlands\n* Fynbos Riparian Vegetation\n* Highveld Alluvial Vegetation\n* Highveld Salt Pans\n* Lesotho Mires\n* Lower Gariep Alluvial Vegetation\n* Muscadel Riviere\n* Namaqualand Riviere\n* Namaqualand Salt Pans\n* Namaqualand Seashore Vegetation\n* Namib Seashore Vegetation\n* Southern Kalahari Mekgacha\n* Southern Kalahari Salt Pans\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe climate is sub-humid rather than semi-arid in the north and east, where the dry forests, savannahs, and salt lakes prevail. South and west, where the vegetation is predominantly xeric savanna or even a semi-desert, the climate is \"Kalaharian\" semi-arid. The Kalaharian climate is subtropical (average annual temperature greater than or equal to 18 °C, at peaks reaching 40 °C and above, with mean monthly temperature of the coldest month strictly below 18 °C), and is semi-arid with the dry season from April to September, the coldest six months of the year. It is the southern tropical equivalent of the Sahelian climate with the wet season during summer. The altitude has been adduced as the explanation why the Kalaharian climate is not tropical; its altitude ranges from 600 to 1600 meters (and generally from 800 to 1200 meters), resulting in a cooler climate than that of the Sahel or Sahara. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Tropical and subtropicalmoist broadleaf forests | * Knysna–Amatole montane forests\n* KwaZulu–Cape

very hot, but not in comparison to regions of low altitude in the Sahel or Sahara, where some stations record average temperatures of the warmest month around 38 °C, whereas the average temperature of the warmest month in any region in the Kalahari never exceeds 29 °C, though daily temperatures occasionally reach up to close to 45 °C (113 °F) (44.8 °C at Twee Rivieren Rest Camp in
