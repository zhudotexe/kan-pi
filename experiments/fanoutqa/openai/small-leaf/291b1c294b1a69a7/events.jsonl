It is the core of the much larger Miami metropolitan area, which, with a population of 6.14 million, is the second-largest metropolitan region in the Southeast and ninth-largest metropolitan region in the United States.[9] Miami has the third-largest skyline in the U.S. with over 300 high-rises,[13] 58 of which exceed 491 ft (150 m).[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMiami metropolitan area\n |\n| --- |\n| Population: **6,012,331** (2015)\n |\n| Counties | * Miami-Dade\n* Broward\n* Palm Beach\n |\n| Major city441k | * Miami\n |\n| Cities and towns100k–250k | * Coral Springs\n* Fort Lauderdale\n* Hialeah\n* Hollywood\n* Miami Gardens\n* Miramar\n* Pembroke Pines\n* Pompano Beach\n* West Palm Beach\n |\n| Cities and towns25k–99k | * Aventura\n* Boca Raton\n* Boynton Beach\n* Coconut Creek\n* Cooper City\n* Coral Gables\n* Cutler Bay\n* Dania Beach\n* Davie\n* Deerfield Beach\n* Delray Beach\n* Doral\n* Greenacres\n* Hallandale Beach\n* Homestead\n* Jupiter\n* Lake Worth\n* Lauderdale Lakes\n* Lauderhill\n* Margate\n* Miami Beach\n* North Lauderdale\n* North Miami\n* North Miami Beach\n* Oakland Park\n* Palm Beach Gardens\n* Plantation\n* Riviera Beach\n* Sunrise\n* Tamarac\n* West Park\n* Weston\n* Wilton Manors\n |\n| Cities and towns10k–25k | * Belle Glade\n* Hialeah Gardens\n* Lighthouse Point\n* Miami Lakes\n* Miami Springs\n* Opa-locka\n* Palm Beach\n* Parkland\n* South Miami\n* Sunny Isles Beach\n* Sweetwater\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMiami is the largest city in South Florida, the second-largest city in Florida, and is the anchor of the largest metropolitan area in Florida: the Miami metropolitan area, which has over 6 million residents. Despite the city being home to less than a fourteenth (1/14) of the population of the metro area, it is an outlier compared to its neighbors, being nearly twice the size of the next-largest city in the metro: Hialeah. The city also has approximately a sixth of the population of its own county, Miami-Dade, which is the state's largest.\n\n\nThe city witnessed rapid growth over the first half of the twentieth century, as its population grew from 1,681 at the time of the 1900 census to 249,276 at the time of the 1950 census. This made it Florida's largest city, a title it would retain until the Jacksonville Consolidation, when the city of Jacksonville absorbed most of Duval County, nearly tripling its population. Since then, Miami has retained its spot as Florida's second-largest city.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Named for | Miami River, ultimately derived from Mayaimi |\n| Government |\n|  • Type | Mayor–Commission |\n|  • Mayor | Francis Suarez (R) |\n| Area[5]\n |\n|  • Total | 56.07 sq mi (145.23 km2) |\n|  • Land | 36.00 sq mi (93.23 km2) |\n|  • Water | 20.08 sq mi (52.00 km2) |\n|  • Metro | 6,137 sq mi (15,890 km2) |\n| Elevation | 6 ft (1.8 m) |\n| Highest elevation | 42 ft (12.8 m) |\n| Population(2020)[6]\n |\n|  • Total | 442,241 |\n|  • Estimate (2022)[7]\n | 449,514 |\n|  • Rank | 44th in the United States2nd in Florida |\n|  • Density | 12,284.47/sq mi (4,743.55/km2) |\n|  • Urban[8]\n | 6,077,522 (US: 4th) |\n|  • Urban density | 4,884.8/sq mi (1,886.0/km2) |\n|  • Metro[9]\n | 6,091,747 (US: 9th) |\n| Demonym | Miamian |\n| Time zone | UTC– 05:00 (EST) |\n|  • Summer (DST) | UTC– 04:00 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Miami\n |\n| --- |\n| City\n |\n| ![](image)\nDowntown Miami skyline\n![](image)\nVizcaya Museum and Gardens\n![](image)\nUniversity of Miami\n![](image)\nFreedom Tower\n![](image)\nKaseya Center\n![](image)\nPortMiami\n |\n| \n![Flag of Miami](image)Flag\n![Official seal of Miami](image)Seal\n![Official logo of Miami](image)Logo\n |\n| Nicknames: *The 305*, *Magic City*, *Gateway to the Americas*, *North Cuba*, *Gateway to Latin America*, *Capital of Latin America*[1] and *Vice City*\n |\n| ![Map](image)Interactive map outlining Miami\n |\n| ![Miami is located in Florida](image)![Miami](image)\nMiami\nLocation within the state of Florida\nShow map of Florida\n![Miami is located in the United States](image)![Miami](image)\nMiami\nLocation within the United States\nShow map of the United States\n |\n| Coordinates: 25°47′N 80°13′W﻿ / ﻿25.78°N 80.21°W﻿ / 25.78; -80.21[2] |\n| Country | United States |\n| State | Florida |\n| County | Miami-Dade |\n| Settled | After 1858[a] |\n| Incorporated | July 28, 1896 |\n| Founded by | Julia Tuttle |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ZIP Codes | 33101-33102, 33106, 33109, 33111-33112, 33114, 33116, 33119, 33122, 33124-33138, 33140-33147, 33149-33158, 33160-33170, 33172-33199, 33206, 33222, 33231, 33233-33234, 33238-33239, 33242-33243, 33245, 33247, 33255-33257, 33261, 33265-33266, 33269, 33280, 33283, 33296, 33299\n |\n| Area code(s) | 305, 786, 645 |\n| FIPS code | 12-45000 |\n| GNIS feature ID | 277593, 2411786 |\n| GDP (Miami-Dade County, 2021) | $155 billion[10] (14th) |\n| GMP (Metro, 2021) | $403 billion[11][12] (12th) |\n| Website | miamigov.com |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, spurred by high-rise construction in Downtown Miami, Edgewater, and Brickell, Miami's population began to grow quickly once more.[79] An estimate by the American Community Survey found that the downtown population (from Brickell north to Midtown Miami) grew nearly 40% between 2010 and 2018.[80] From 2000 to 2010, the city's population grew by 10.2% and had reached 399,457 by 2010. In the early 2010s, the city's population crossed a milestone of 400,000 people, and by the time of the 2020 census, it had grown by a further 10.7%, up to a population of 442,241.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMiami is a major center and leader in finance, commerce, culture, arts, and international trade.[15][16] Miami's metropolitan area is by far the largest urban economy in Florida, with a gross domestic product of $344.9 billion as of 2017.[17] According to a 2018 UBS study of 77 world cities, Miami is the third-richest city in the U.S. and the third richest globally in purchasing power.[18] Miami is a majority-minority city with a Hispanic and Latino population of 310,472, or 70.2 percent of the city's population, as of 2020.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2022, Miami ranked seventh in the U.S. in business activity, human capital, information exchange, cultural experience, and political engagement.[25] It is the second-most visited city in the U.S. after New York City with over five million visitors as of 2019.[26]\n\n\n\n\n## Toponymy[edit]\n\n\nMiami was named after the Miami River, derived from Mayaimi, the historic name of Lake Okeechobee and the American Indians who lived around it.[27] Miami is sometimes colloquially referred to as **The 305**, **Magic City**, **Gateway to the Americas**, **Gateway to Latin America**, **Capital of Latin America**,[1] and **Vice City**.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Miami\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Miami.\n\nSee also: National Register of Historic Places listings in Miami\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1970, the Census Bureau reported Miami's population as 45.3% Hispanic, 32.9% non-Hispanic white, and 22.7% black.[82] Miami's explosive population growth has been driven by internal migration from other parts of the country, up until the 1960s. From 1970 to 2000, population growth in the city was stagnant, as Non-Hispanic White Miamians left and significant immigration from Latin America, particularly Cuba, made up the balance.[83][84] The city's Hispanic majority solidified itself in this period of time, and in 1985, the city elected its first Cuban-born mayor, Xavier Suarez.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Non-Hispanic Black population of the city of Miami peaked in 1990 at almost 90,000 (making up nearly a quarter of the population of the city). Since then, though, the city's Non-Hispanic Black population has experienced a precipitous and steady decline. At the time of the most recent census in 2020, it was found to be 52,447, only 11.7% of the population. Reasons for this include high costs in areas such as Liberty City and Little Haiti, compounded with gentrification.[85][86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMiami is a major center of commerce and finance and boasts a strong international business community. According to the 2020 ranking of world cities undertaken by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC) based on the level of presence of global corporate service organizations, Miami is considered a Beta + level world city, along with Atlanta, Dallas, and Houston, however according to the U.S. census between the years 2015–2019, Miami lacks in terms of owner-occupied housing, computer and internet usage, education regarding bachelor's degree or higher, median household income, per capita income, while achieving higher percentage of persons in poverty.[122][123] Miami has a Gross Metropolitan Product of $257 billion, ranking 11th in the United States and 20th worldwide in GMP.[124][125]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 74.9\n | 73.8\n | 72.5\n | 73.2\n |\n| Average dew point °F (°C)\n | 57.6(14.2)\n | 57.6(14.2)\n | 60.4(15.8)\n | 62.6(17.0)\n | 67.6(19.8)\n | 72.0(22.2)\n | 73.0(22.8)\n | 73.8(23.2)\n | 73.2(22.9)\n | 68.7(20.4)\n | 63.9(17.7)\n | 59.2(15.1)\n | 65.8(18.8)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 219.8\n | 216.9\n | 277.2\n | 293.8\n | 301.3\n | 288.7\n | 308.7\n | 288.3\n | 262.2\n | 260.2\n | 220.8\n | 216.1\n | 3,154\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 66\n | 69\n | 75\n | 77\n | 72\n | 70\n | 73\n | 71\n | 71\n | 73\n | 68\n | 66\n | 71\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 5.1\n | 6.7\n | 8.6\n | 10.2\n | 10.5\n | 10.7\n | 10.8\n | 10.5\n | 9.3\n | 7.1\n | 5.3\n | 4.5\n | 8.2\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA (relative humidity, dew point and sun 1961–1990),[52][68][69] The Weather Channel[70] |\n| Source 2: UV Index Today (1995 to 2022),[71] Thunderstorm days (1961 to 1990)[72] |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Miami\n\nFurther information: Cuban migration to Miami\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMunicipalities and communities of Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States\n |\n| --- |\n| County seat: **Miami**\n |\n| Cities | * Aventura\n* Coral Gables\n* Doral\n* Florida City\n* Hialeah\n* Hialeah Gardens\n* Homestead\n* Miami\n* Miami Beach\n* Miami Gardens\n* Miami Springs\n* North Bay Village\n* North Miami\n* North Miami Beach\n* Opa-locka\n* South Miami\n* Sunny Isles Beach\n* Sweetwater\n* West Miami\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Towns | * Bay Harbor Islands\n* Cutler Bay\n* Golden Beach\n* Medley\n* Miami Lakes\n* Surfside\n |\n| Villages | * Bal Harbour\n* Biscayne Park\n* El Portal\n* Indian Creek\n* Key Biscayne\n* Miami Shores\n* Palmetto Bay\n* Pinecrest\n* Virginia Gardens\n |\n| CDPs | * Brownsville\n* Coral Terrace\n* Country Club\n* Country Walk\n* Fisher Island\n* Fontainebleau\n* Gladeview\n* Glenvar Heights\n* Golden Glades\n* Goulds\n* Homestead Base\n* Ives Estates\n* Kendale Lakes\n* Kendall\n* Kendall West\n* Leisure City\n* Naranja\n* Ojus\n* Olympia Heights\n* Palm Springs North\n* Palmetto Estates\n* Pinewood\n* Princeton\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2010[update], 5.6% of city residents were West Indian or Afro-Caribbean American origin (4.4% Haitian, 0.4% Jamaican, 0.4% Bahamian, 0.1% British West Indian, and 0.1% Trinidadian and Tobagonian, 0.1% Other or Unspecified West Indian),[112] 3.0% were Black Hispanics,[113] and 0.4% were Subsaharan African origin.[114][115]\n\n\nAs of 2010[update], those of (non-Hispanic white) European ancestry accounted for 11.9% of Miami's population.

This caused the Non-Hispanic White population to rise from a nadir of 11.8% at the time of the 2000 census to 11.9% at the time of the 2010 census.

Julia Tuttle subsequently convinced railroad tycoon Henry Flagler to extend his Florida East Coast Railway to the region, for which she became known as \"the mother of Miami\".[32][33] Miami was officially incorporated as a city on July 28, 1896, with a population of just over 300.[34]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cuban migration to Miami\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Economic indicators\n |\n| --- |\n| 2017–21 American Community Survey | Miami\n | Miami-Dade County\n | Florida\n |\n| Median income[96] | $31,472\n | $32,513\n | $34,367\n |\n| Median household income[97] | $47,860\n | $57,815\n | $61,777\n |\n| Poverty Rate[98] | 20.9%\n | 15.7%\n | 13.1%\n |\n| High school diploma[99] | 79.2%\n | 82.5%\n | 89.0%\n |\n| Bachelor's degree[99] | 33.1%\n | 31.7%\n | 31.5%\n |\n| Advanced degree[99] | 13.2%\n | 11.9%\n | 11.7%\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Language spoken at home[d] | 2015[e] | 2010[f] | 2000[102] | 1990[103] | 1980[104] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English | 23.0%\n | 22.6%\n | 24.7%\n | 26.7%\n | 36.0%\n |\n| Spanish or Spanish Creole | 70.0%\n | 69.9%\n | 66.6%\n | 64.0%\n | 57.5%\n |\n| French or Haitian Creole | 4.5%\n | 4.9%\n | 6.0%\n | 7.7%\n | 2.6%\n |\n| Other Languages\n | 2.5%\n | 2.6%\n | 2.7%\n | 1.6%\n | 3.9%\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n137. **^** \"Telemundo plans to tape 1,100 hours of telenovelas in Miami\". *Miamitodaynews.com*.
