A list of the top twenty artists was given to the Nominations Review Committee, a specially selected group of anonymous members, who initially selected the top five artists to gain a nomination in the category in a special ballot; the number of nominated artists was increased to eight in 2018.[15][16] The rest of the members then vote on a winner from the final nominees.[17] In 2021, it was announced that the Nomination Review Committees would be disbanded, and the final nominees for best new artist would be decided by votes from members.[18] Starting in 2022, the number of nominees in the category increased to 10.[19] However, the decision to expand the number of nominees in this category was made 24 hours before the nominees were announced after an early version of the nominations list had already been circulated. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Grammy Award for **Best New Artist** has been awarded since the 2nd Annual Grammy Awards in 1960.[1] Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were handed out, for records released in the previous year. The award was not presented in 1967. The official guidelines are as follows: \"For a new artist who releases, during the Eligibility Year, the first recording which establishes the public identity of that artist.\" Note that this is not necessarily the first album released by an artist; for example, Shelby Lynne won the award in 2001 after having already released six albums over 13 years.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHonor presented to recording artists\n\n\"Best New Artist\" redirects here.

In 2010, Lady Gaga's exclusion from the Best New Artist category caused the Recording Academy to change eligibility requirements for the next ceremony. She was ineligible for the nomination because her hit \"Just Dance\" had been nominated in 2008. The new rule stated that an artist may be nominated as long as that artist has not previously released an entire album and has subsequently not won a Grammy.[22][23] In June 2016, the Grammy organization amended the Best New Artist rules once again, to remove the album barrier \"given current trends in how new music and developing artists are released and promoted\".[24] To be eligible in the category of Best New Artist, the artist, duo, or group:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. **^** Martens, Todd (December 1, 2010). \"Grammys 2011: Justin Bieber, Florence + the Machine and the best new artist crop\". *Los Angeles Times*.

So that was basically the kiss of death and I feel sorry for everyone who's gotten it since.\"[5]\n\n\nThe category is also notable for being the only category in which a Grammy Award was vacated; this occurred in 1990 after it was revealed that winners Milli Vanilli did not contribute their own vocals on their album, *Girl You Know It's True*.[6] The award was not then given to another artist.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Further information[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n86. **^** Williams, Chris (November 24, 2020). \"Grammy Awards Nominations 2021: The Complete List\". *Variety*.

By 2013, and under the moniker Kaytranada, he began gaining wider recognition and, the following year, signed a deal with XL Recordings, with whom he would release his critically acclaimed debut studio album *99.9%* in 2016. In 2019, he released its follow-up, *Bubba*, for which he won two Grammy Awards including Best Dance/Electronic Album.
