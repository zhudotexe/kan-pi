Its membership, as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869, consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom constitute a quorum.[1][2] Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants plenary power to the president of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court; justices have life tenure.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **Associate justices:** Clarence Thomas\n* Samuel Alito\n* Sonia Sotomayor\n* Elena Kagan\n* Neil Gorsuch\n* Brett Kavanaugh\n* Amy Coney Barrett\n* Ketanji Brown Jackson\n |\n| Retired justices | * Anthony Kennedy\n* David Souter\n* Stephen Breyer\n |\n| History | * Jay Court (1789\u20131795)\n* Rutledge Court (1795)\n* Ellsworth Court (1796\u20131800)\n* Marshall Court (1801\u20131835)\n* Taney Court (1836\u20131864)\n* Chase Court (1864\u20131873)\n* Waite Court (1874\u20131888)\n* Fuller Court (1888\u20131910)\n* White Court (1910\u20131921)\n* Taft Court (1921\u20131930)\n* Hughes Court (1930\u20131941)\n* Stone Court (1941\u20131946)\n* Vinson Court (1946\u20131953)\n* Warren Court (1953\u20131969)\n* Burger Court (1969\u20131986)\n* Rehnquist Court (1986\u20132005)\n* Roberts Court (2005\u2013present)\n |\n| Lists of justicesand nominees | * Chief justices\n* Associate justices\n* All justices\n\t+ court\n\t+ education\n\t+ seat\n\t+ time in office\n* All nominations\n\t+ unsuccessful\n* Justices who served in Congress\n* Burial places of justices\n |\n| Statutes affectingcourt size | * Judiciary Act of 1789\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Stathis, Stephen W.

The length of service on the Court for the 107 non-incumbent justices ranges from William O. Douglas's 36\u00a0years, 209\u00a0days to John Rutledge's 1\u00a0year, 18\u00a0days as associate justice and, separated by a period of years off the Court, his 138\u00a0days as chief justice. As of June 13, 2024, the length of service for the nine incumbent justices ranges from Clarence Thomas's 32\u00a0years, 234\u00a0days to Ketanji Brown Jackson's 1\u00a0year, 349\u00a0days. Five individuals, who were confirmed for associate justice, were later appointed chief justice separately: John Rutledge,[a] Edward Douglass White,[b] Charles Evans Hughes,[a] Harlan F.

The commissions of the first four associate justices bear the following dates: Rutledge, Sept.\u00a026, 1789; Cushing, Sept.\u00a027; Wilson, Sept.\u00a029; and Blair, Sept.\u00a030.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** Recess appointment.

Beginning in the early 20th century, many justices who left the Court voluntarily did so by retiring from the Court without leaving the federal judiciary altogether. A retired justice, according to the United States Code, is no longer a member of the Supreme Court, but remains eligible to serve by designation as a judge of a U.S. Court of Appeals or District Court, and many retired justices have served in these capacities. Historically, the average length of service on the Court has been less than 15 years. However, since 1970 the average length of service has increased to about 26 years.[8]\n\n\n\n## List of justices[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Justice\n | State[c] | Position\n | Succeeded\n | Date confirmed(Vote)\n | Tenure\n | Tenure length[d] | Nominated by\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | John Jay(1745\u20131829) | NY | ChiefJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | October 19, 1789\u2013June 29, 1795(Resigned) | 5\u00a0years, 253\u00a0days\n | George Washington |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | John Rutledge(1739\u20131800) | SC | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | February 15, 1790[e]\u2013March 5, 1791(Resigned) | 1\u00a0year, 18\u00a0days\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | William Cushing(1732\u20131810) | MA | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | February 2, 1790[e]\u2013September 13, 1810(Died) | 20\u00a0years, 223\u00a0days\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | James Wilson(1742\u20131798) | PA | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | October 5, 1789[e]\u2013August 21, 1798(Died) | 8\u00a0years, 320\u00a0days\n |\n| 5\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince 1789, Congress has occasionally altered the size of the Supreme Court, historically in response to the country's own expansion in size. An 1801 act would have decreased the Court's size to five members upon its next vacancy. However, an 1802 act negated the effects of the 1801 act upon the Court before any such vacancy occurred, maintaining the Court's size at six members. Later legislation increased its size to seven members in 1807, to nine in 1837, and to ten in 1863. An 1866 act was to have reduced the Court's size from ten members to seven upon its next three vacancies, and two vacancies did occur during this period. However, before a third vacancy occurred, the Judiciary Act of 1869 intervened, restoring the Court's size to nine members, where it has remained ever since.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Supreme Court was created by Article III of the United States Constitution, which stipulates that the \"judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court,\"[4] and was organized by the 1st United States Congress. Through the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress specified the Court's original and appellate jurisdiction, created thirteen judicial districts, and fixed the number of justices at six (one chief justice and five associate justices).[5][6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![](image) | Sandra Day O'Connor(born 1930) | AZ | AssociateJustice | Stewart | September 21, 1981(99\u20130)\n | September 25, 1981\u2013January 31, 2006(Retired) | 24\u00a0years, 128\u00a0days\n | Ronald Reagan |\n| 100\n | ![](image) | William Rehnquist(1924\u20132005) | VA | ChiefJustice | Burger | September 17, 1986(65\u201333)\n | September 26, 1986\u2013September 3, 2005(Died) | 18\u00a0years, 342\u00a0days\n |\n| 103\n | ![](image) | Antonin Scalia(1936\u20132016) | VA | AssociateJustice | Rehnquist | September 17, 1986(98\u20130)\n | September 26, 1986\u2013February 13, 2016(Died) | 29\u00a0years, 140\u00a0days\n |\n| 104\n | ![](image) | Anthony Kennedy(born 1936) | CA | AssociateJustice | Powell | February 3, 1988(97\u20130)\n | February 18, 1988\u2013July 31, 2018(Retired) | 30\u00a0years, 163\u00a0days\n |\n| 105\n | ![](image) | David Souter(born 1939) | NH | AssociateJustice | Brennan | October 2, 1990(90\u20139)\n | October 9, 1990\u2013June 29, 2009(Retired) | 18\u00a0years, 263\u00a0days\n | George H.

Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 by a vote of 68\u201331. While on the Court, Sotomayor has supported the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her Supreme Court tenure, Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants and criminal justice reform, and is known for her impassioned dissents on issues of race, ethnic, and gender identity, including in *Schuette v. BAMN*, *Utah v. Strieff*, and *Trump v. Hawaii*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor[5] was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx.[6] Her father was Juan Sotomayor (c. 1921\u20131964),[7] from the area of Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico,[8][9][10] and her mother was Celina B\u00e1ez (1927\u20132021),[11] an orphan[12] from Santa Rosa in Lajas, a rural area on Puerto Rico's southwest coast.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nand the emergence of the Black Spades gang.[17] In 1970, the family found refuge by moving to Co-op City in the Northeast Bronx.[17]\n\n\n\n### College and law school[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor attended Princeton University. She has said she was admitted in part due to her achievements in high school and in part because affirmative action made up for her standardized test scores, which she described as \"not comparable to her colleagues at Princeton and Yale.\"[31][32] She would later say that there are cultural biases built into such testing[31] and praise affirmative action for fulfilling \"its purpose: to create the conditions whereby students from disadvantaged backgrounds could be brought to the starting line of a race many were unaware was even being run.\"[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSotomayor was born in the Bronx, New York City,[4] to Puerto Rican-born parents. Her father died when she was nine, and she was subsequently raised by her mother. Sotomayor graduated *summa cum laude* from Princeton University in 1976 and received her Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1979, where she was an editor at the *Yale Law Journal*.[4] Sotomayor worked as an assistant district attorney in New York for four and a half years before entering private practice in 1984. She played an active role on the boards of directors for the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the State of New York Mortgage Agency, and the New York City Campaign Finance Board.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n39. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Smith, Ben (May 29, 2009). \"Princeton University holds the key to understanding Sonia Sotomayor\". *The Politico*.
