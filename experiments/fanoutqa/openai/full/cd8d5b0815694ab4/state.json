Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final.

The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.[622]\n\n\nRonaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.[623]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Caioli, Luca (2016) [2012]. *Ronaldo: The Obsession for Perfection* (2017 updated\u00a0ed.).

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards,[note 3] a record three UEFA Best Player in Europe, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 34 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and international appearances (204). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Ronaldo evading Luka Modri\u0107 during a friendly match against Croatia in 2013\nDuring the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals. A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1\u20131 draw against Northern Ireland, earned him his 100th cap.[393] His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4\u20132 qualifying win on 6 September 2013.[394] After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team's goals in the play-offs against Sweden, billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, which ensured their place at the tournament.[395] His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equalling Pauleta's record.[396] Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5\u20131 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country's all-time top scorer.[397]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2010 UEFA Team of the Year\n |\n| --- |\n| * GK: Casillas\n* RB: Maicon\n* CB: Piqu\u00e9\n* CB: Puyol\n* LB: Cole\n* MF: C.

In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6\u20130 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.[391] As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0\u20130 draw, as they won their group on goal differential.[392][393] In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1\u20131. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n352. **^** Thomas, Hindle (11 March 2023). \"PSG player ratings vs Brest: Kylian Mbappe & Lionel Messi connect for late winner but Ligue 1 leaders still look out of sorts\". *Goal*.

Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade \u20ac4.1\u00a0million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009.

As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[18] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they declined to pay for his treatment.[19][20] His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \"the best forward I've ever seen\".[21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand.

Due to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, Messi was condemned for taking on the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing.[640][641] In April 2023, Messi was featured in the 200 year old Thrissur Pooram festival in Kerala, India.[642] During Thrissur Pooram, which is one of the largest festivals in Asia, umbrellas carrying the illuminated cut outs of Messi holding the World Cup trophy were displayed on the top of caparisoned elephants during the Kudamattam ceremony.[643]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family and relationships[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)After blessing himself, Messi often celebrates a goal by pointing a finger on each hand towards the sky in dedication to his late grandmother.[613] His goal celebration features in the *FIFA* video game series, first appearing in *FIFA 14.*\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n570. **^** \"Magical Messi Grabs Hat-trick in Copa America as Argentina Romp into Quarters\". *The Daily Telegraph*.

Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent *La Albiceleste* since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8\u20130 victory.

A turning point came on 11 January during a 3\u20131 victory over Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, the first time Bar\u00e7a's attacking trident of Messi, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly successful run.[172][173] After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Su\u00e1rez, their striker.[173][174] From there, he regained his best form, while Su\u00e1rez and Neymar ended the team's attacking dependency on their star player.[175][176] With 58 goals from Messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.[177]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Messi missed the 2006 UEFA Champions League final through injury, but received a winners medal having been part of the Barcelona squad for the 2005\u201306 Champions League season.[8] The official UEFA website states \"several other players have four titles to their name but only three final appearances: Lionel Messi: 2006\\*, 2009, 2011, 2015 (Barcelona)\".[9]\n4. **^** Assist statistics began in 1990.\n5. **^** According to Bleacher Report's Richard Fitzpatrick, \"Schwarzstein and Messi built up a close relationship during more than four years of treatment.\"[647]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Does not include an unofficial friendly match played on 24 May 2008 in Barcelona between Argentina U23 and the Catalonia national football team,[688][689] as Catalonia is not affiliated with either FIFA or UEFA as a national member association and is therefore not allowed to participate in official competitions.[690]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHis team's prosperity continued into the second half of 2009, as Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year.[93] After victories in the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a and UEFA Super Cup in August, Barcelona won the FIFA Club World Cup against Estudiantes de La Plata on 19 December, with Messi scoring the winning 2\u20131 goal with his chest.[94] At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times by the biggest voting margin in each trophy's history.[75]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"Messi is the best player in the world by some distance.

A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou.[48] Capello sought to take Messi to Juventus on loan, but Inter Milan offered to pay his \u20ac150\u00a0million buyout clause and triple his wages.[49] According to then-president Joan Laporta, it was the only time the club faced a real risk of losing Messi, but he ultimately decided to stay.[50] On 16 September, his contract was updated for the second time in three months and extended to 2014.[41][51]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Messi prior to a friendly game with Al Ahli SC in Doha, Qatar in December 2016\nMessi finished the year with 51 goals, making him Europe's top scorer, one ahead of Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107.[215] After placing second in the 2016 Ballon d'Or, on 9 January 2017 Messi also finished in second place \u2013 behind Cristiano Ronaldo once again \u2013 in the 2016 Best FIFA Men's Player Award.[216] On 11 January, Messi scored from a free-kick in Barcelona's 3\u20131 victory against Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey, which enabled Barcelona to advance to the quarter-finals of the competition; with his 26th goal from a free-kick for Barcelona in all competitions, he equalled the club's all-time record, which had previously been set by Ronald Koeman.[217] In his next league match, on 14 January, Messi scored in a 5\u20130 win against Las Palmas; with this goal, he equalled Ra\u00fal's record for the most teams scored against in La Liga (35).[218]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Messi playing against M\u00e1laga in 2005\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n575. **^** \"Menotti: 'Messi Est\u00e1 al Nivel del Mejor Maradona Que Vi'\" [Menotti: 'Messi Is at the Level of the Best Maradona That I Saw']. *AS* (in Spanish). 10 January 2014.

Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association.[660][661] Messi has served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the recent earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.[662] To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.[663]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nand the most likable of all contemporary players.[630][631] On Messi's economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a \"tourist attraction\".[632]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLa Liga Foreign Player of the Year - Don Bal\u00f3n Award\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1976: Neeskens\n* 1977: Cruyff\n* 1978: Cruyff\n* 1979: Stielike\n* 1980: Stielike\n* 1981: Stielike\n* 1982: Stielike\n* 1983: Barbas\n* 1984: Barbas\n* 1985: Schuster\n* 1986: Valdano\n* 1987: S\u00e1nchez\n* 1988: Alem\u00e3o\n* 1989: Ruggeri\n* 1990: S\u00e1nchez\n* 1991: Schuster\n* 1992: Laudrup\n* 1993: \u0110uki\u0107\n* 1994: Stoichkov\n* 1995: Zamorano\n* 1996: Mijatovi\u0107\n* 1997: Ronaldo\n* 1998: Rivaldo\n* 1999: Figo\n* 2000: Figo\n* 2001: Figo\n* 2002: Zidane\n* 2003: Nihat\n* 2004: Ronaldinho\n* 2005: Riquelme\n* 2006: Ronaldinho\n* 2007: Messi\n* 2008: Ag\u00fcero\n* 2009: Messi\n* 2010: Messi\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLa Liga Forward of the Year - LFP Awards\n |\n| --- |\n| * 2009: Messi\n* 2010: Messi\n* 2011: Messi\n* 2012: Messi\n* 2013: Messi\n* 2014: Ronaldo\n* 2015: Messi\n* 2016: Messi\n* 2017: Messi\n* 2018: Messi\n* 2019: Messi\n* 2020: Benzema\n* 2021: Messi\n* 2022: Benzema\n* 2023: Lewandowski\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Messi (pictured in 2007) has worked with UNICEF since 2004 and has served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since 2010.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 1 June, Galtier confirmed that PSG's home game against Clermont on 3 June would be Messi's last for the club, with the club confirming his departure two days later;[361] the match ended in 3\u20132 defeat.

He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[540] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[541][542][543] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[532][544] As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65,[545] the most among active players.[546] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[547]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nArgentina squad \u2013 2022 FIFA World Cup winners (3rd title)\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1\u00a0Armani\n* 2\u00a0Foyth\n* 3\u00a0Tagliafico\n* 4\u00a0Montiel\n* 5\u00a0Paredes\n* 6\u00a0Pezzella\n* 7\u00a0De Paul\n* 8\u00a0Acu\u00f1a\n* 9\u00a0\u00c1lvarez\n* 10\u00a0Messi\u00a0(c)\n* 11\u00a0Di Mar\u00eda\n* 12\u00a0Rulli\n* 13\u00a0Romero\n* 14\u00a0Palacios\n* 15\u00a0Correa\n* 16\u00a0Almada\n* 17\u00a0G\u00f3mez\n* 18\u00a0Rodr\u00edguez\n* 19\u00a0Otamendi\n* 20\u00a0Mac Allister\n* 21\u00a0Dybala\n* 22\u00a0La.

We do everything that's Catholic, but we don't really have anything traditional except go to the park and have barbecues on Sundays after church.\"[11] Gomez was fluent in Spanish until age seven.[9][*clarification needed*] Her parents divorced when she was five years old, and she remained with her mother.[3][12] Gomez has two younger half-sisters and a younger stepbrother: Gracie Elliot Teefey, through Mandy and her second husband, Brian Teefey,[13][14] and Victoria \"Tori\" and Marcus Gomez, through Ricardo and his second wife, Sara.[15] She earned her high-school diploma through homeschooling in May 2010.[16]\n\n\nGomez was born when her mother was 16 years old.[17] The family had financial troubles throughout Gomez's childhood, her mother struggling to provide for the pair. At one point, Gomez recalls that they had to search for quarters just to get gas for their car. Her mother later recalled that the two would frequently walk to their local dollar store to buy spaghetti for dinner.[18] Gomez has said, \"I was frustrated that my parents weren't together, and never saw the light at the end of the tunnel where my mom was working hard to provide a better life for me. I'm terrified of what I would have become if I'd stayed [in Texas].\"[19] She later added that her mother \"was really strong around me. Having me at 16 had to have been a big responsibility. She gave up everything for me, had three jobs, supported me, sacrificed her life for me.\" Gomez had a close relationship with her grandparents as a child and appeared in various pageants. Her grandparents often took care of her while her parents finished their schooling, and she has said they \"raised her\" until she found success in show business.[20]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2002\u20132006: Career beginnings[edit]\n\n\nGomez first gained an interest in pursuing a career in entertainment watching her mother prepare for stage productions.[21] In 2002, she began her acting career on the children's television series *Barney & Friends*,[22][23] portraying the character Gianna.[24] The show was her first acting gig.

Its productions are rooted in today's pop-EDM default mode [...]\".[146] Andrew Hampp of *Billboard* wrote: \"[...] is a collection of 11 shinily produced pop songs that find Gomez trying on a series of different personalities with her slight-yet-capable vocals [...]\".[147] *Stars Dance* became her first album to debut at number one on the U.S. *Billboard* 200, with first-week sales of 97,000 album-equivalent units.[96] At that time, Gomez, who turned 21, became the youngest solo artist to take first place since *Speak Now* from Taylor Swift in 2010.[96] The album also reached number one in Canada.[92] Gomez incorporated choreographed dance routines into the album's music videos and her promotional live performances, having been inspired by artists such as Janet Jackson and Britney Spears.[148][149] The music video of \"Come & Get It\" won the Best Pop Video at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.[150]\n\n\nIn August 2013, Gomez embarked on her first solo worldwide concert tour, Stars Dance Tour, to further promote *Stars Dance*, with shows in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia.[151] In December 2013, Gomez canceled the Australian and Asian legs of the tour, claiming that she would be taking a hiatus to spend time with her family.[152] In January 2014, it was reported that Gomez had spent two weeks at Dawn at The Meadows, which is a treatment center in Wickenburg, Arizona, that specializes in treating addiction and trauma in young people.[153] Her representative stated that she had spent time there \"voluntarily [...] but not for substance abuse\".[154][155] Gomez confirmed in 2015 that she had been diagnosed with lupus and that after canceling the tour she entered rehab to undergo chemotherapy.[156][157] Gomez played Nina Pennington, an innocent straight-A student, in *Behaving Badly* (2014).[158][159] The project, filmed prior to Gomez's stint in rehab, was released in August to a generally negative critical and commercial reception.[160][161] However, critics deemed Gomez's performance superior to the film.[162][163] Gomez also had a supporting role in the drama *Rudderless* (2014), the directorial debut of William H.

In 2015, she launched her own cosmetics line called Kylie Lip Kits, which was renamed to Kylie Cosmetics the following year.[8]\n\n\nJenner has been an influential figure in culture since the mid 2010s. In 2014 and 2015, *Time* magazine listed the Jenner sisters on their list of the most influential teens in the world, citing their considerable influence among youth on social media.[9][10] In 2017, Jenner was placed on the *Forbes* Celebrity 100 list, making her the youngest person to be featured on the list.[11] Jenner starred on her own spin-off series, *Life of Kylie*, which premiered in 2017.[12]\n\n\nJenner's wealth and its coverage on the magazine *Forbes* has been a source of controversy in the past. In 2019, the magazine estimated Jenner's net worth at US$1 billion and called her the world's youngest self-made billionaire at age 21;[13][14] the notion of Jenner being self-made has been controversial.[15][16] In May 2020, *Forbes* released a statement accusing Jenner of forging tax documents so she would appear as a billionaire.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nKylie Kristen Jenner was born on August 10, 1997, in Los Angeles, California. The youngest daughter of former Olympic decathlete champion Caitlyn Jenner (then known as Bruce Jenner)[b][19] and television personality and businesswoman Kris Jenner (n\u00e9e Houghton).[20] From both of her parents' side, she is of Dutch, English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry, with some Welsh ancestry from her father's side.[21] Jenner has an older sister, Kendall and eight older half-siblings. [22] From Caitlyn's side of the family, she has three older half-brothers\u2015Burt, Brandon, and Brody Jenner\u2015and one older half-sister Cassandra Marino.[23] From Kris' side of the family, Jenner has three older half-sisters\u2015Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9\u2015and one older half-brother Rob Kardashian.[24] Her parents divorced in 2015,[25] prior to her father's transition.[26]\n\n\nJenner attended Sierra Canyon School, where she was also a member of the cheerleading team. Jenner claims to have performed in plays while attending school, along with community plays.[27] In 2012, she became homeschooled and enrolled in an at-home education program, from which she graduated with a high school diploma in July 2015 from Laurel Springs School in Ojai, California.[28][29]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2007\u20132012: *Keeping Up with the Kardashians*[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Jenner, along with her parents and siblings, Kendall, Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob, began appearing in the reality television series *Keeping Up with the Kardashians*, which chronicles the personal and professional lives of their family members.[30] The series was successful for its network, E!, and has resulted in the creation of numerous spin-offs including *Kourtney and Kim Take Miami*, *Khlo\u00e9 & Lamar*, *Kourtney and Kim Take New York*, and *Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Take The Hamptons*, in which Jenner has made multiple guest appearances.[31] The sisters hosted *Glee: The 3D Concert Movie* at the Regency Village Theater in Westwood, Los Angeles in August 2011,[32] In 2011, they were featured in *Seventeen* magazine's Style Stars of the Year,[33][34] and selected them as \"Style Ambassadors\" for the magazine.[35] The two hosted the premiere of *The Vow* in Hollywood in February 2012.[36] The Jenners also interviewed the cast of *The Hunger Games* premiere at The Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles in March 2012.[37] Later in 2012, she starred alongside her sister Kendall and mother Kris Jenner in an episode of American reality television series America's Next Top Model.\n\n\n\n### 2013\u20132014: Early ventures[edit]\n\n\nThe Jenner sisters co-hosted the 2014 Much Music Video Awards, where Kylie made her acting debut in a promo for the show in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in June 2014.[38] In August 2014, the Jenner sisters appeared in singer PartyNextDoor's \"Recognize\" music video.[39] She also appeared in Jaden Smith's music video for his song \"Blue Ocean\".[40] Jenner and her sister Kendall co-authored the dystopian science fiction novel *Rebels: City of Indra: The Story of Lex and Livia*, which revolved around two twin girls, Lex and Livia, in a \"self-sustaining biosphere\" put together from the remains of Earth known as Indra.[41] The novel was criticized upon release as a ghostwritten work, which prompted its ghostwriter Maya Sloan to reveal that while the Jenner sisters wrote a two-page outline for what they wanted the novel to be like, Sloan was truly responsible for the writing of the book. However, the Jenners' creative director, Elizabeth Killmond-Roman, clarified that the two had numerous Skype and FaceTime calls with Sloan to discuss the content of the novel.[42] The novel was mostly panned by critics, and sold only 13,000 copies in its first four months on sale.[43] The book was also given a sequel, *Time of the Twins*, which was also co-authored by the Jenner sisters.\n\n\n\n### 2015\u20132018: Rise of Kylie Cosmetics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kendall (left) and Kylie Jenner, 2016\nThe Jenner sisters were booed while introducing brother-in-law Kanye West's performance at the Billboard Music Awards in May 2015.[44] In May 2015, an episode of *Keeping Up with the Kardashians* premiered in which Jenner admitted to getting a lip augmentation.[45] Her enhanced lips from lip fillers created speculation and gained her publicity. Prior to the episode's debut, Jenner stated that she merely used lip liner and over lined her lips.[46] As a result, the practice of suctioning one's lips into a small glass in order to induce greater blood flow to swell the lips was called the \"Kylie Jenner Challenge\" (though there was no indication that Jenner herself employed this method).[47] Jenner responded to this by stating, \"I'm not here to try & encourage people/young girls to look like me or to think this is the way they should look.\"[48] In August 2015, Jenner announced that she would be launching her first lipstick line as a part of her self-titled lip kit under the name Kylie Lip Kit.[49] In November 2015, the Jenner sisters appeared in singer Justine Skye's \"I'm Yours\" music video.[50]\n\n\nIn February 2016, Jenner's cosmetic company was renamed to Kylie Cosmetics and the number of kits produced rose from an initial 15,000 to 500,000.[51] Jenner released a three-minute-long promotional video for a series of lip glosses in March 2016, directed by Colin Tilley and starring fellow models Karin Jinsui, Mara Teigen, and Jasmine Sanders.[52][53][54][55][56] The song in the video was revealed to be \"Three Strikes\" by Terror Jr, a band created on the same day as the release of the video; however, the lead singer, who was later revealed to be singer Lisa Vatale,[57] was heavily speculated to be Jenner herself.[58][59][60][61] However, Jenner subsequently denied any involvement with the band.[62][63] In May 2016, she made her musical debut rapping on producer Burberry Perry's song \"Beautiful Day\", with Lil Yachty, Jordyn Woods, and Justine Skye.[64] The next month, Jenner starred in another PartyNextDoor's music video for his song \"Come and See Me\".[65] In April 2017, she made a surprise appearance at the Rio Americano High School prom in Sacramento alongside junior Albert Ochoa after hearing that his date had turned him down.[66][67][68]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Jenner was placed at number 59 on the *Forbes* Celebrity 100, which calculates the 100 highest-paid celebrities of the previous 12 months, after earning approximately US$41,000,000, making her the youngest person on the list at 19 years old.[11]\n\n\nJenner starred in a reality show revolving around her life, *Life of Kylie*,[69] which premiered in August 2017. On mother's day 2018, Kylie Cosmetics launched makeup line called Kris Cosmetics, in collaboration with her mother Kris Jenner.[70] Jenner and her half-sister Kim Kardashian launched their second collaboration KKW x Kylie Cosmetics collection on Black Friday 2018 after previously launched the first collection in 2017.[71] The same month, she launched Kylie Cosmetics mobile app.[72]\n\n\n\n### 2019\u20132020: Debut of Kylie Skin[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jenner for *Vogue*\nIn April 2019, Jenner and her half-sister Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty teamed up to launch a new fragrance. This collaboration became Jenner's first foray into fragrance and it launched on April 26.[73] Jenner founded her own skincare brand Kylie Skin which was launched on May 22.[74][75] The brand began producing dermis products, including face washes, scrubs, moisturizers and makeup removing wipes. On June 14, 2019, Kylie Cosmetics launched their collaboration with her half-sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian called Kylie Cosmetics x Koko Kollection. This marked their third collaboration after previously launched special collection of lip products called Koko Kollection in 2016 and the second part in 2017.[76] In September, Jenner announced that she was serving as the makeup artistic director for Balmain's Spring 2020 runway show at Paris Fashion Week. To celebrate the new line, Kylie Cosmetics and Balmain launched a capsule makeup collection and available on September 27, the day of the show, on the Kylie Cosmetics website. This was the first time Jenner collaborated on a makeup collection with someone outside of her family's inner circle.[77]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Jenner filed to trademark the phrase \"rise and shine\", a line that became a meme when footage of Jenner singing the phrase to her daughter, Stormi, went viral.[78] The hashtag #RiseandShine reached one billion views on TikTok, making it the platform's fastest-growing hashtag trend.[79] In addition to the standard \"rise and shine\", Jenner also filed to trademark \"riiise and shiiinnee\".[80] The latter trademark would cover clothing while the former would also apply to cosmetics.[81][82] The next month, Jenner sold a 51 percent stake in Kylie Cosmetics to Coty, which owns other beauty brands including Covergirl, OPI, Rimmel, GHD and Clairol for $600 million.[83]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Jenner announced she had trademarked Kylie Con, Kylie Kon, and Kylie Museum.[84] In the same month, her sister Kendall confirmed that a cosmetics line in collaboration with Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics was in the process. Kylie Cosmetics launched Kylie Cosmetics x Kendall Jenner on June 26, 2020.[85] Still in the same month, Jenner announced that Kylie Cosmetics will launch a Valentine's Day Collection named after Jenner's daughter, Stormi. The Stormi Collection was launched in February 1, the same day as her daughter's birthday.[86] Jenner made a cameo appearance in singers Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber's \"Stuck with U\" music video in May 2020. The following month, the Jenners sisters addressed reports that their fashion brand Kendall + Kylie has failed to pay factory workers in Bangladesh as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was reported that Global Brands Group (GBG) previously listed the Kendall + Kylie brand on its website. As a result, the Jenners stated that their company is owned by a separate entity known as 3072541 Canada Inc. even though they say that their brand \"has worked with CAA-GBG in the past, in a sales and business development capacity only\" and that they \"do not currently have any relationship at all with GBG\".[87] In August 2020, Kylie Cosmetics launched Summer Sailor collection which marked the launch of Jenner's first-ever false lashes.[88] In the same month, she made a cameo in Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's \"WAP\" music video, alongside singers Normani and Rosal\u00eda; a petition asking that Jenner's cameo be edited out of the video reached over 65,000 signatures.[89]\n\n\nJenner topped the *Forbes* list of highest paid celebrities for 2020.[90]\n\n\n\n### 2021\u2013present: Business and television expansions[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Jenner and her family announced that their reality show, *Keeping Up With the Kardashians*, would be ending after twenty seasons and almost 15 years on air.[91][92][93]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Jenner teased Kylie Swim, a new swimwear line that includes sizes for all women.[94] On September 17, it was officially launched on Kylie Jenner's website.[95] Following release, the company received a lot of backlash on social media, with people saying that the products were poor quality and impractical, saying that they should only be used for Instagram photos.[96][97][98] On September 21, she announced a new skincare and hair product line for babies, called Kylie Baby.[99]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Jenner became the first woman to gain 300 million followers on the social network service Instagram, surpassing the previous recordholder, singer Ariana Grande.[100]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Jenner and her family returned to the television screens with their brand new reality television show, titled *The Kardashians*, after they left the E! Network to join Hulu.[101][102][103] The show features Jenner, alongside her sisters Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Kendall, and mother Kris Jenner, it also features ex and current partners including Scott Disick, Travis Barker, Tristan Thompson, and Corey Gamble, with Kanye West making a guest appearance.[104] The first season premiered on 14 April 2022, and its ten episodes can be streamed exclusively on Disney+.[105][106] Later in 2022, the show was announced to be returning for a second season, which officially premiered on 22 September 2022.[107][108] In late 2022, it was announced that the show had been officially renewed for a third season, set to premier in the first half of 2023.[109][110][111] The third season officially aired on 25 May 2023.[112][113][114]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Relationships[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2014, Tyga was seen getting close with Jenner at her 17th birthday party. Days later, Tyga ended his relationship with Blac Chyna, his fianc\u00e9e and the mother of his son.[115][116] In 2015, when she turned 18, Jenner and Tyga made their relationship official.[117][118] Jenner subsequently made appearances in two of Tyga's music videos, \"Stimulated\" and \"Dope'd Up\".[119] In April 2017, Jenner and Tyga broke up.[120]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Jenner was first seen with Travis Scott at Coachella.[121] On February 1, 2018, Jenner gave birth to their daughter.[122][123] Jenner appeared in the music video for \"Stop Trying to Be God\", from Scott's third studio album *Astroworld*.[124] They broke up in September 2019,[125][126] but quarantined together during the COVID-19 pandemic for the sake of their daughter and ended up rekindling their relationship.[127][128] On September 7, 2021, after weeks of speculation, Jenner revealed that she and Scott were expecting their second child.[129] Jenner gave birth to their son on February 2, 2022.[130][131][132] In January 2023, it was reported that the couple has split up again.[133]\n\n\n\n### Friendship with Jordyn Woods[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Jenner and Jordyn Woods met through their mutual friend, Jaden Smith, son of Hollywood actor Will Smith and actress Jada Pinkett Smith.[134] They were close friends for many years, with Woods appearing in Jenner's 2017 reality TV show, *Life of Kylie,*[135] and Jenner's 2018 pregnancy video. In September 2018, Kylie Cosmetics launched the Kylie x Jordyn collection, a collaboration between the two friends.[136] Their friendship ended in 2019 as a result of Woods cheating with Tristan Thompson, who was the fianc\u00e9 of Jenner's half-sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.[137] Jenner discontinued her Woods-named lip kit, cutting the price to eliminate remaining inventory.[138]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Kendall + Kylie \"Rock vs. Rap\" collection[edit]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2017, the Jenner sisters announced that they would be releasing a line of vintage T-shirts for their Kendall + Kylie line of clothing called Rock vs. Rap,[139][140] featuring the likenesses of various rock and rap artists[141] including The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur, Metallica, Pink Floyd, The Doors, Ozzy Osbourne, and Led Zeppelin, with pictures of the Jenner sisters superimposed over them.[139] The announcement of this line of products was met with swift backlash from relatives and representatives of the figures depicted on the shirts themselves, including Sharon Osbourne,[142] Jim Jampol,[143] and Voletta Wallace, mother of Biggie Smalls.[144] They were also criticized on social media and were called \"insensitive.\"[145] Wallace, The Doors' manager and the estate of Jim Morrison issued a cease-and-desist letter to the Jenner sisters, writing that they did not authorize the sisters' use of the likenesses of these musical icons.[146][147] The Jenners apologized for the shirts, and pulled them from retail.[139]\n\n\n\n### *Forbes* cover[edit]\n\n\nJenner appeared on the cover of the August 2018 issue of *Forbes*. The magazine claimed she had a net worth of $900 million and that she was on the verge of becoming the youngest \"self-made\" billionaire.[148] This would beat Mark Zuckerberg, who became a billionaire at age 23.[149] However, the publication's use of the term \"self-made\" sparked widespread criticism and jokes online.[150] Critics argued that Jenner was already born into fame and fortune.[151] Some discussions took a more serious tone, with journalists writing pieces on wealth distribution, inequality and inheritance, as well as upward mobility in society.[152][153][154] However, celebrities such as Jenner's half-sister Kim Kardashian and socialite Paris Hilton have come out and defended Jenner, legitimizing assertions that she is indeed self-made, while Hilton who was born into the Hilton family also described herself as self-made.[155][156]\n\n\nIn May 2020, *Forbes* released a statement accusing Jenner of forging tax documents so she would appear as a billionaire.[17] The publication also accused her of fabricating revenue figures for Kylie Cosmetics.[17] The same day, Jenner responded in a series of tweets, writing: \"What am I even waking up to? I thought this was a reputable site... All I see are a number of inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol. I've never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there EVER. Period\". Jenner's attorney also demanded that *Forbes* retract the statements, calling the magazine's accusations \"unequivocally false\". *Forbes* reacted, stating that they spent months uncovering the facts and concluded that their \"extensively-reported investigation was triggered by newly-filed documents that revealed glaring discrepancies between information privately supplied to journalists and information publicly supplied to shareholders\".[157] However, Jenner became the youngest person on *Forbes*'s list of 100 Richest Self-Made Women in October 2020. She is the only person on the list in her 20s, and is worth $700 million.[158]\n\n\n\n### Cultural appropriation[edit]\n\n\nJenner has been accused of appropriating African-American culture and style.[159] In 2016, Jenner was criticized for posting a photograph of herself wearing cornrows on Instagram.[160] In June 2017, urban streetwear brand PluggedNYC accused Jenner of stealing their designs for her collection of camouflage swimwear.[161]\n\n\n\n### Underpaying factory workers[edit]\n\n\nRemake, a non-profit, labeled Global Brands Group as the manufacturer for the Kendall + Kylie clothing line.[162] The organization claimed that money was being withheld from workers in the factories despite having finishing their work. The organization also reported them firing workers in Los Angeles, affecting over fifty-thousand workers.[163] She received criticism for this on multiple platforms, with fans asking her to pay her workers.[164] In response to this, the clothing line said that Kendall + Kylie was not owned by Global Brands Group.[165]\n\n\n\n### Lawsuits and civil disputes[edit]\n\n\n#### Vlada Haggarty[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2017, make-up artist Vlada Haggarty claimed that Jenner had stolen the creative style and aesthetic of her own work, such as the dripping gloss lip and golden finger tips, for her own products, and that Jenner had a history of taking Haggerty's original dripping lip art and passing it off as her own. Jenner later credited Vlada on social media and her work on the creation of the logo and an undisclosed settlement was paid to avoid any future legal issues.[166][167][168]\n\n\n\n#### \"Kylie\" trademark[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Australian singer Kylie Minogue won a legal battle against Jenner for name trademark \"Kylie\". Jenner had filed a U.S. trademark application for use of the name \"Kylie\" for \"advertising services\" and \"endorsement services\" in 2015.[169]\n\n\n\n#### Neon lip logo[edit]\n\n\nSara Pope, a British painter whose work has been featured in art galleries in several cities across the globe, filed a lawsuit against Jenner and NBC Universal for the use of a neon lip logo. Pope stated that Jenner posted to her social media accounts an image that was remarkably similar to Pope's most famous piece, \"Temptation Neon\" and used it to promote Jenner's TV series *Life of Kylie*. TMZ reported that the production art created for the series, including the lip design, was created by a third party designer.[170]\n\n\n\n#### Seed Beauty[edit]\n\n\nSeed Beauty filed a lawsuit against Coty and Kylie Cosmetics, alleging that Coty has purchased $600 million in Kylie Cosmetics stock from Jenner as a subterfuge to learn trade secrets.[171]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jenner being interviewed for Nip + Fab in 2015\nJenner has two nail lacquers from the Nicole by OPI nail polish brand called Wear Something Spar-kylie and Rainbow in the S-kylie.[172] Jenner and her sister Kendall earned $100,000 each for their OPI endorsements in 2013.[173] On November 15, 2013, the Jenner sisters announced that they would launch The Kendall & Kylie Collection with PacSun[174] which launched in February 2013. Since its conception, the sisters have released several collections for this line. In July 2013, the Jenner sisters launched a jewelry line with Pascal Mouawad's Glamhouse[175][176] to create the Metal Haven by Kendall & Kylie jewelry collection.\n\n\nIn February 2014, she and Kendall launched a shoe and handbag line for Steve Madden's Madden Girl line.[177][178] Jenner launched a line of hair extensions through a partnership with Bellami Hair, called *Kylie Hair Kouture*, in October 2014.[179][180][181] She became skincare brand Nip + Fab's second-ever ambassador in March 2015.[182] In June 2015, the Jenner sisters launched their clothing line *Kendall + Kylie* with British fashion retailer Topshop.[183] This Topshop clothing line also featured swimsuits.[184] In September 2015, the Jenner sisters launched their personalized website and mobile app, called *Kendall and Kylie*.[185]\n\n\nJenner partnered with nail polish brand Sinful Colors and launched 20 pieces nail polish collection in 2016. In fall the same year, Jenner was announced to be the new face of PUMA along with Rae Sremmurd.[186] In 2017, Jenner became the face of Beats Headphones special edition collection in collaboration between Apple and Balmain.[187] Jenner collaborated with Melbourne-based sunglasses brand Quay Australia[188][189] to release a line of sunglasses, *Quay x Kylie*. This collaboration was launched in June 2017.[190][191][192] She endorsed Calvin Klein along with her sisters in 2018. In the same year she signed a deal with Adidas to become their ambassador. Jenner also had endorsed hair vitamin SugarBearHair, Waist Gang Society waist trainer, monthly beauty subscription service Boxycharm, detox tea Fit Tea and Fashion Nova.[193] In 2018, Jenner reportedly made $1 million per sponsored Instagram post, making her the highest paid individuals on Instagram in 2018. The next year Jenner reportedly made $1.2 million per sponsored Instagram post, remaining her as the highest paid individuals on Instagram for the second year in a row.[194]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jenner in 2017\nJenner set up an eBay account where she auctions old clothing to raise money for the Children's Hospital Los Angeles.[195] She joined her sisters Khlo\u00e9 and Kendall, along with Lil Twist, and The Game at PINZ bowling alley in Studio City, California for a charity bowling game on January 19, 2014. The event was held to raise money for The Robin Hood Foundation, a nonprofit for which The Game pledged to raise $1 million in donations.[196] The Jenner sisters participated in singer Chris Brown's two Kick'n It For Charity Celebrity Kickball games in Glendale, California on July 19, 2014[197] and on August 16, 2014.[198] At the first game, she competed on actor/singer Quincy Brown's team.\n\n\nIn December 2015, Jenner made a donation of Christmas gifts to the Los Angeles LGBT Teen Center.[199] In January 2017, Jenner donated $10,000 to her then-friend Jordyn Woods to help cover memorial costs for Woods's father after he died from cancer.[200] On her birthday in the same year, Jenner announced on her Instagram she donated $500,000 from sales of her Birthday Collection to Teen Cancer America, an organization to help hospital and outpatient facilities develop special units for teens with cancer.[201] Jenner is an ambassador for Smile Train, a charity that funds surgery for children with cleft lips and palates. She became one of the organization's youngest ambassadors. Jenner visited Peru with Smile Train on an episode of *Life of Kylie*. In 2016, Jenner launched a special-edition lip kit called \"Smile\", and donated $159,500 to Smile Train to fund cleft lip and palate surgeries for 638 deserving children.[202] In September 2019, during her appearance on *The Ellen DeGeneres Show*, Jenner donated $750,000 to the founder and members of a feminist organization in Florida called Nest of Love, which is dedicated to mentoring young women, helping low-income kids in the community, and promoting female empowerment.[203]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Jenner gave a total of $1 million to five organisations in Australia to help tackle the bushfires.[204] In March 2020, Jenner, her mother Kris, along with beauty company Coty donated over 6,000 pounds of hand sanitizers to Southern California hospitals to help health care workers fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time,[6][7] he was integral to the development and success of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) during the Attitude Era, an industry boom period in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Johnson wrestled for the WWF for eight years before pursuing an acting career. His films have grossed over $3.5 billion in North America and over $10.5 billion worldwide,[8] making him one of the world's highest-grossing and highest-paid actors.[9][10][11]\n\n\nAfter accepting an athletic scholarship to play football at the University of Miami, he was a member of the 1991 national championship team, but was largely a backup player.[12] Despite aspirations to professional football, he went undrafted in the 1995 NFL draft, and briefly signed with the Calgary Stampeders before being cut in his first season.[13] In 1996, Johnson's father Rocky assisted in helping him secure a contract with the WWF.[2] Johnson quickly rose to global prominence, aided by a gimmick he employed as a charismatic trash talker. Johnson left the WWE in 2004 and returned in 2011 as a part-time performer until 2013, making sporadic appearances until retiring in 2019.[14] A 10-time world champion, including the promotion's first of African-American descent,[15] he is also a two-time Intercontinental Champion, a five-time Tag Team Champion, the 2000 Royal Rumble winner, and WWE's sixth Triple Crown champion. Johnson headlined the most-bought professional wrestling pay-per-view (WrestleMania XXVIII) and was featured among the most watched episodes of WWE's flagship television series (*Raw* and *SmackDown*).[16][17]\n\n\nJohnson's first film role was in *The Mummy Returns* (2001). The next year, he played his first leading role in the action fantasy film *The Scorpion King*. He has since starred in family films *The Game Plan* (2007), *Race to Witch Mountain* (2009), *Tooth Fairy* (2010), *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle* (2017), *Jumanji: The Next Level* (2019), and *Jungle Cruise* (2021), and the action films *Journey 2: The Mysterious Island* (2012), *G.I. Joe: Retaliation* (2013), *Hercules* (2014), *Skyscraper* (2018), *San Andreas* (2015) and *Rampage* (2018). He also starred in the action comedy films *Get Smart* (2008), *Central Intelligence* (2016), *Baywatch* (2017), and *Red Notice* (2021). His role as Luke Hobbs in the *Fast & Furious* films, beginning with *Fast Five* (2011), helped the franchise become one of the highest-grossing in film.[18] He joined the DC Extended Universe playing the title role in *Black Adam* (2022).[19] He is also known for voicing Maui in the Disney animated film *Moana* (2016) and is set to reprise the role in the upcoming live action remake.[20]\n\n\nJohnson produced and starred in the HBO comedy-drama series *Ballers* (2015\u20132019)[21] and the autobiographical sitcom *Young Rock* (2021). His autobiography, *The Rock Says*, was released in 2000 and was a *New York Times* bestseller.[22][23] In 2012, he co-founded the entertainment production company Seven Bucks Productions.[24] Johnson is a co-owner of the XFL, a professional American football league, which he acquired from WWE owner Vince McMahon for $15 million in 2020.[25][26][27] In 2016 and 2019, *Time* named Johnson one of the world's most influential people.[28][29]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJohnson was born in Hayward, California,[30] on May 2, 1972,[31] the son of Ata Johnson (n\u00e9e Maivia)[32] and former professional wrestler Rocky Johnson (born Wayde Douglas Bowles).[33][34] Growing up, he briefly lived in Grey Lynn in Auckland, New Zealand, with his mother's family,[35] where he played rugby[36] and attended Richmond Road Primary School before returning to the U.S.[35]\n\n\nJohnson's father was a Black Nova Scotian with a small amount of Irish ancestry.[37][38] His mother is Samoan. His father and Tony Atlas were the first black tag team champions in WWE history, in 1983.[39][40] His mother is the adopted daughter of Peter Maivia, who was also a professional wrestler.[41] Johnson's maternal grandmother Lia was one of the first female pro wrestling promoters, taking over Polynesian Pacific Pro Wrestling after her husband's death in 1982 and managing it until 1988.[42][43] Through his maternal grandfather Maivia, Johnson is a non-blood relative of the Anoa'i wrestling family.[44][45][46][47][48] In 2008, he inducted his father and grandfather into the WWE Hall of Fame.[49]\n\n\nJohnson attended Montclaire Elementary School in Charlotte, North Carolina, before moving to Hamden, Connecticut, where he attended Shepherd Glen Elementary School and then Hamden Middle School.[50][51] He attended President William McKinley High School in Honolulu and then Glencliff High School and McGavock High School, both in Nashville, and then Freedom High School in Bethlehem Township in the Lehigh Valley, from which he graduated in 1990.[52]\n\n\nAt Freedom High School, Johnson initially struggled and was drawn into a culture of conflict and petty crime. By age 17, he had been arrested several times for fighting, theft, and check fraud, and was suspended two weeks for fighting.[53] The local newspaper later called him \"a troubled teenager with a history of run-ins with police.\" But Freedom High School football coach Jody Cwik saw athletic potential in Johnson, and recruited him to join the football team, where he played defensive tackle. The experience proved the beginning of a personal transformation for Johnson. \"My thought process started to change. That's when I started thinking about goals and what I wanted to accomplish\", he has since said about his high school football experience.[12] In addition to playing football, Johnson also was a member of Freedom High School's track and field and wrestling teams. [33]\n\n\nBy his senior year, Johnson had played only two years of football, but was offered a full athletic scholarship offer from the University of Miami.[12]\n\n\n\n## Football career[edit]\n\n\n### College career[edit]\n\n\n\n\nDwayne Johnson| No.\u00a094 |\n| --- |\n| Position | Defensive tackle |\n| Major | Criminology and physiology |\n| Personal information |\n| Born: | May 2, 1972\u00a0(1972-05-02) (age\u00a052)Hayward, California, U.S. |\n| Height | 6\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in (1.96\u00a0m) |\n| Weight | 253\u00a0lb (115\u00a0kg) |\n| Career history |\n| College | * Miami (FL) (1990\u20131994)\n |\n| Bowl games | * Cotton Bowl Classic (1991)\n* Orange Bowl (1992)\n |\n| High school | Freedom High School(Bethlehem, Pennsylvania) |\n| Career highlights and awards |\n| * AP Poll national champion (1991)\n |\n\n\nAs he did in high school, Johnson continued to play defensive tackle at the University of Miami. He was a member of the Miami Hurricanes football team during his freshman year in 1991, and won that year's national championship.[54][33] Despite playing four years there, Johnson found himself behind elite players on the depth chart, including future NFL star and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Warren Sapp, and appeared mostly in backup roles.[55][56] In his time at Miami, Johnson played in 39 games with one start. He recorded 4.25 sacks and 77 tackles.[57]\n\n\nIn 1995, Johnson graduated with a Bachelor of General Studies and a dual major in criminology and physiology.[58] He was also one of the university's most prolific student speakers in the Miami-area community, frequently delivering positive messages about his own struggles and encouraging students to remain in school and avoid the dangers of drug use.[59]\n\n\n\n### Canadian Football League[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating, Johnson was signed by the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. Calgary moved him from defensive tackle to linebacker. He was assigned to Calgary's practice roster, but was cut two months into Calgary's 1995 season.[33][60][61]\n\n\n\n## Professional wrestling career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career (1996)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on |\n| Professional wrestling |\n| ![](image) |\n| History\n* History of professional wrestling\n\t+ By year\n* Early wrestling championships\n* Gold Dust Trio\n* 1980s boom\n* Black Saturday\n* 1994 NWA World Title Tournament\n* Monday Night Wars\n* Attitude Era\n* 2000 All Japan Pro Wrestling mass exodus\n* The Invasion\n* Wednesday Night Wars\n |\n| Notable promotions\n* All Elite Wrestling\n* All Japan Pro Wrestling\n* All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling\n* American Wrestling Association\n* Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\n* Extreme Championship Wrestling\n* Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling\n* Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling\n* Jim Crockett Promotions\n* Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide\n* National Wrestling Alliance\n* New Japan Pro-Wrestling\n* Pro Wrestling Noah\n* Ring of Honor\n* Tokyo Joshi Pro-Wrestling\n* Total Nonstop Action Wrestling\n* UWF International\n* Women of Wrestling\n* World Championship Wrestling\n* World Wonder Ring Stardom\n* WWE\n* Others\n |\n| Notable people\n**Early 20th Century**\n* George Hackenschmidt\n* The Great Gama\n* Frank Gotch\n* Billy Sandow\n* Toots Mondt\n* Ed Lewis\n* Jack Pfefer\n* Jim Londos\n* Salvador Lutteroth\n* Lou Thesz\n\n\n**Mid 20th Century**\n\n* Gorgeous George\n* El Santo\n* Sam Muchnick\n* Mildred Burke\n* The Fabulous Moolah\n* Blue Demon\n* Verne Gagne\n* Karl Gotch\n* Rikid\u014dzan\n* Stu Hart\n* Bruno Sammartino\n\n\n**1970s and 1980s**\n\n* Terry Funk\n* Harley Race\n* Gordon Solie\n* Antonio Inoki\n* Giant Baba\n* Mil M\u00e1scaras\n* Andr\u00e9 the Giant\n* Carlos Col\u00f3n\n* Dusty Rhodes\n* Ric Flair\n* Jim Crockett Jr.\n* Big Daddy\n* Vince McMahon\n* Dynamite Kid\n* Satoru \"Tiger Mask\" Sayama\n* Hulk Hogan\n* Randy Savage\n* Hisashi Shinma\n* Akira Maeda\n\n\n**1990s**\n\n* Ted Turner\n* Sting\n* The Great Muta\n* The Undertaker\n* Jim Ross\n* Mitsuharu Misawa\n* Kenta Kobashi\n* Toshiaki Kawada\n* Atsushi Onita\n* Antonio Pe\u00f1a\n* Eric Bischoff\n* Paul Heyman\n* Jim Cornette\n* Bret Hart\n* Shawn Michaels\n* Kevin Nash\n* Scott Hall\n* Vince Russo\n* Stone Cold Steve Austin\n* The Rock\n* Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque\n\n\n**2000s**\n\n* Chris Jericho\n* Jeff Jarrett\n* Eddie Guerrero\n* Rey Mysterio\n* Brock Lesnar\n* John Cena\n* Hiroshi Tanahashi\n* M\u00edstico\n\n\n**2010s and 2020s**\n\n* CM Punk\n* Bryan Danielson\n* Roman Reigns\n* Kazuchika Okada\n* Kenny Omega\n* Tony Khan\n* Nick Khan\n* Cody Rhodes\n |\n| By region\n* Australia\n* Bolivia\n* Canada\n* China\n* France\n* India\n* Israel\n* Japan\n* Mexico\n* New Zealand\n* Puerto Rico\n* Russia\n* Saudi Arabia\n* United Kingdom\n* United States\n |\n| Styles\n* British wrestling\n\t+ All-in style\n\t+ Mountevans rules\n* Catch-as-catch-can\n* Cruiserweight\n\t+ X Division\n* Hardcore\n* Intergender\n* *Lucha libre*\n* Midget\n\t+ *Mini-Estrella*\n* *Puroresu*\n* Shoot style\n\t+ *U-Kei*\n* Women's\n |\n| Concepts\n* Attire\n\t+ Masks\n\t+ Wrestling singlet\n\t+ Wrestling shoe\n* Backyarding\n* Blading\n* Championship\n\t+ World Heavyweight\n* Dirt sheet\n* Glossary of terms\n\t+ Kayfabe\n\t+ Gimmick\n\t+ Face\n\t+ Heel\n\t+ Shoot\n\t+ Heat\n\t+ Job\n\t+ Push\n* House show\n* Match types\n* Music\n* Rib\n* Ring name\n* Sports entertainment\n* Tag team\n* Weight classes\n* Wrestling ring\n |\n| Culture\n* Cauliflower Alley Club\n* Cauliflower ear\n* Comic books\n* Films\n\t+ Luchador films\n* Magazines\n* Paintings\n\t+ Gustave Courbet\n\t+ Thomas Eakins\n\t+ William Etty\n\t+ George Luks\n* Ribera Steakhouse\n* Sculpture\n* Ten-bell salute\n* Video games\n* Wrestling personalities in politics\n* Zubaz\n |\n| Media outlets\n* *Botchamania*\n* *Box y Lucha*\n* *Dark Side of the Ring*\n* *Fighting Spirit Magazine*\n* *Live Audio Wrestling*\n* *OSW Review*\n* *Power Slam*\n* *Pro Wrestling Illustrated*\n* *S\u00faper Luchas*\n* *Wrestling Observer Newsletter*\n |\n| Controversies\n* Animals in professional wrestling\n* Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide\n* Death of Owen Hart\n* Mass Transit incident\n* Montreal Screwjob\n* Murder of Bruiser Brody\n* Murder of Rikid\u014dzan\n* Premature deaths\n* Speaking Out\n* *United States v.

Wrestling at first under his real name, Johnson defeated The Brooklyn Brawler at a house show on March 10[62] and lost matches to Chris Candido and Owen Hart.[35] After wrestling at Jerry Lawler's United States Wrestling Association under the name Flex Kavana and winning the USWA tag team championship twice with his partner Bart Sawyer in the summer of 1996, Johnson was signed to a WWF contract. He received additional training from Tom Prichard, alongside Achim Albrecht and Mark Henry.[5][35]\n\n\n\n### World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment[edit]\n\n\n#### Debut; Intercontinental Champion (1996\u20131997)[edit]\n\n\nJohnson made his WWF debut as Rocky Maivia, a combination of his father and grandfather's ring names, although announcers acknowledged his real name.[63] He was initially reluctant to take this ring name but was persuaded by Vince McMahon and Jim Ross.[43][64] He was given the nickname \"The Blue Chipper\", and to play up his lineage, he was hyped as the WWF's first third-generation wrestler.[3] A clean-cut face character, Maivia was pushed heavily from the start despite his wrestling inexperience. He debuted on *Monday Night Raw* as a member of Marc Mero's entourage on November 4, 1996.[65] His first match came at Survivor Series, on November 17, 1996, in an eight-man elimination tag match; he was the sole survivor and eliminated the final two members of the opposing team, Crush and Goldust.[66] On February 13, 1997, he won the Intercontinental Championship from Hunter Hearst Helmsley on *Monday Night Raw*.[67][68][69] Maivia then successfully defended the title against Helmsley at In Your House 13: Final Four.\n\n\nJohnson's first WrestleMania match came at WrestleMania 13 on March 23, 1997, where he was victorious in his Intercontinental Championship defense against The Sultan. WWF fans started to reject his character and push from the company.[70] He defeated Bret Hart by disqualification in a title defense on the March 31 episode of *Raw is War*.[71] Behind the scenes, Hart mentored Johnson for his first year in WWF[72] and refused to be booked to take the title from him.[73] On April 20, at In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker, he lost to Savio Vega by countout but retained the title. Audiences became increasingly hostile toward Maivia, with chants of \"die, Rocky, die\" and \"Rocky sucks\" being heard during his matches.[2][43]\n\n\nAfter losing the Intercontinental Championship to Owen Hart on the April 28, 1997, episode of *Raw Is War*,[74] Maivia suffered a legitimate knee injury in a match against Mankind in June 1997 and spent several months recovering.[2]\n\n\n\n#### Nation of Domination (1997\u20131998)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Nation of Domination\n\nUpon returning in August 1997, Maivia turned heel for the first time in his career by lashing out at fans who had been booing him and joining Faarooq, D'Lo Brown and Kama in the stable called the Nation of Domination.[75] He then refused to acknowledge the Rocky Maivia name, instead referring to himself in the third person as the Rock, though he would still be billed as \"The Rock\" Rocky Maivia until 1998. The Rock would then regularly insult the audience, WWF performers, and interviewers in his promos.[75]\n\n\nAt D-Generation X: In Your House on December 7, 1997, Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated the Rock in under six minutes to retain the Intercontinental Championship.[76] The next night on *Raw Is War*, Austin was ordered by Mr. McMahon to defend the title in a rematch, but forfeited it to the Rock instead, handing him the title belt before hitting him with the *Stone Cold Stunner*.[77][78] The Rock feuded with Austin and Ken Shamrock through the end of 1997 and beginning of 1998.[79][80] On January 19, 1998, at the Royal Rumble, the Rock defeated Shamrock by disqualification to retain the Intercontinental title. Later that night, he entered the Royal Rumble match and lasted until the final two before he was eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin. On March 29, at WrestleMania XIV, he defeated Shamrock by disqualification once again to retain the title. The next night, on *Raw is War*, the Rock debuted a new Intercontinental Championship design and would later overthrow Faarooq as leader of the Nation of Domination to spark a feud between the two. He then successfully defended the Intercontinental title against Faarooq at Over the Edge: In Your House on May 31. The stable would then refer to themselves as simply \"The Nation\".[81]\n\n\nThe Rock and the Nation then feuded with Triple H and D-Generation X, with the two stable leaders first meeting in the quarter-final of the 1998 King of the Ring tournament, which the Rock won. At King of the Ring, the Rock defeated Dan Severn in the semi-final match and lost to rival Ken Shamrock in the final. The Rock then resumed his feud with Triple H, as the two had a two out of three falls match at Fully Loaded: In Your House for the Intercontinental title, which the Rock retained in controversial fashion.[82] This led to a ladder match at SummerSlam on August 30, 1998, where the Rock lost the title.[83]\n\n\nIn the latter half of 1998, The Rock saw a big uptick in fan support. He also started consolidating his famous persona during this time, which would last until 2000.[84] His popularity caused him to be booked in a feud with fellow Nation members Mark Henry and D'Lo Brown, turning babyface in the process. Henry defeated him at Judgment Day: In Your House on October 18, 1998, after interference from Brown, effectively breaking up the stable.[85][86]\n\n\n\n#### WWF Champion and rise to superstardom (1998\u20132000)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Corporation and Rock 'n' Sock Connection\n\n![](image)As part of The Corporation, the Rock feuded with Stone Cold Steve Austin and stole Austin's personalized WWF Championship and his \"Smoking Skull\" belt.\nThe Rock was then entered into the \"Deadly Game\" tournament for the vacant WWF Championship. The finals occurred at Survivor Series on November 15, 1998, where the Rock defeated Vince McMahon's associate, Mankind, to win his first WWF Championship.[87][88] A \"double turn\" then occurred as the Rock turned heel again after allying with Vince and Shane McMahon as the crown jewel of their stable, The Corporation, after the McMahons betrayed Mankind.[87][89] On December 13, 1998, at the pay-per-view named after him, Rock Bottom: In Your House, the Rock had a rematch with Mankind for the WWF Championship. Mankind appeared to win the match when the Rock passed out to the Mandible Claw submission move, but Vince McMahon ruled that since the Rock did not tap out, he retained his title.[89][90]\n\n\nIn the main event of the January 4, 1999, episode of *Raw Is War*, Mankind defeated the Rock for the championship after interference from Stone Cold Steve Austin.[91] Then at the Royal Rumble on January 24, 1999, the Rock regained the title in an \"I Quit\" match, a type of submission match that only ends if one of the combatants says \"I quit\" on a microphone. Intended to show a vicious streak in the Rock's character, the Rock hit Mankind in the head with a steel chair 11 times instead of the scripted five, five shots already being risky (most wrestling matches in the Attitude Era involving steel chairs had at most 2 or 3 shots to the head). After the fifth shot, Mankind was still ringside instead of two-thirds up the entrance ramp where he was supposed to be, and after the eleventh shot, which knocked Mankind out, a recording of Mankind saying \"I Quit\" from an earlier interview was played over the public address system.[92][93] On January 31, during an episode of *Sunday Night Heat*, the Rock and Mankind participated in an Empty Arena match, a match that took place in an arena with 22,000 empty seats where any part of the facility could be used to contest the match. After 20 minutes of chaotic brawling in the ring, the stands, a kitchen, the catering area, an office, the arena corridors and finally a basement loading area, Mankind pinned the Rock using a forklift truck to win the WWF title.[94] This match was referred to as \"Halftime Heat\" as it was televised during halftime of that year's Super Bowl.[95] The two faced off again, at St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House on February 14, 1999, in a Last Man Standing match which ended in a draw, meaning Mankind retained the title. Their feud ended on the February 15 *Raw Is War*, when the Rock won his third WWF Championship in a Ladder Match after a debuting Big Show interfered on his behalf.[96][97] The Rock then lost the WWF Championship to Stone Cold Steve Austin at WrestleMania XV on March 28, 1999.[98]\n\n\nThe Rock's popularity continued to grow and audiences still cheered for him even though he was a heel. He then lost the title rematch against Stone Cold Steve Austin at Backlash: In Your House on April 25, 1999.[99] The next night on *Raw is War* he was fired from the Corporation after he was betrayed by Shane McMahon, turning him face again and starting a feud with Triple H, The Undertaker and The Corporate Ministry. On April 29, 1999, WWF aired the pilot episode of *SmackDown!*, a term derived from one of the Rock's catchphrases. In the episode, the Rock continued his feud with The Corporate Ministry. This led to a match with Triple H, at Over the Edge on May 23, 1999, which the Rock won,[100] and a match for the WWF Championship against The Undertaker, at King of the Ring, which the Rock lost.[101] The Rock then lost a number one contender's match to Triple H, at Fully Loaded, after interference from \"Mr. Ass\" Billy Gunn.[102] The Rock then defeated Gunn in a Kiss My Ass match at SummerSlam on August 22, 1999. The Rock was also given the privilege of having his own signature match, like The Undertaker with the Buried Alive match, Kane with the Inferno Match and Mankind with the Boiler Room Brawl: the Brahma Bullrope match, a variant of a strap match was a normal singles match where the components are tied together with a rope used for cattle farming, and the rope and its attached cowbell could both be used as weapons. The Rock contested this match twice, both times in Texas (vs Triple H in Dallas, and vs Al Snow in Houston).[103]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock's popularity was fueled by his charisma and speaking abilities, which led to many catchphrases and merchandising opportunities.\nShortly after SummerSlam, the Rock began teaming with former opponent Mankind and the two became known as the Rock 'n' Sock Connection.[104] They became WWF Tag Team Champions for the first time after defeating The Undertaker and Big Show for the titles on the August 30, 1999, episode of *Raw is War*.[105][106] The two performed a number of critically acclaimed comedic skits together, including one called \"This Is Your Life\", which saw Mankind bring parody versions of people from the Rock's past on television, such as his high school girlfriend and his high school football coach, only to have the Rock insult them. The segment earned an 8.4 Nielsen rating, one of the highest ratings ever for a *Raw* segment.[107] The two lost the titles back to Undertaker and Big Show on the September 9 episode of *SmackDown!* and won them back from them on the September 20 episode of *Raw is War*.[108][109] Rock and Mankind then lost the titles to The New Age Outlaws on the very next episode of *SmackDown!*.[110] Rock and Mankind would win the tag titles for the third and final time after beating the New Age Outlaws on the October 14 episode of *SmackDown!* before losing the titles to The Holly Cousins on the October 18 episode of *Raw is War*.[111][112]\n\n\nAt the Royal Rumble, on January 23, 2000, the Rock entered the Royal Rumble match and was one of the final two remaining, along with Big Show. In an attempt at a \"false finish\", Big Show intended to throw the Rock over the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, before the Rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending Big Show to the floor before reentering the ring as the winner.[113] But the Rock's feet accidentally hit the floor during the reversal attempt, though those watching the event on television did not see that. This was played up in the storyline as Big Show provided additional video footage showing it and claimed to be the rightful winner. The Rock's number one contendership for the WWF Championship was then put on the line against Big Show at No Way Out on February 27, 2000, which Big Show won after Shane McMahon interfered.[114] The Rock then defeated Big Show on the March 13 episode of *Raw Is War*, to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 on April 2, in a Fatal Four-way elimination match, also including Big Show and Mick Foley.[115][116] Each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner: Triple H had his wife Stephanie, Foley had Linda, the Rock had Vince and Big Show had Shane.[116][117] The Rock lasted until the final two but was eliminated by Triple H after Vince betrayed him by hitting him with a chair.[117][118]\n\n\nDue to his image at the time, a Magic: The Gathering deck archetype was named after him.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Record-breaking world champion (2000\u20132002)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rock as the WWF Champion in 2000\nIn the following weeks, the Rock continued his feud with Triple H and eventually won his fourth WWF Championship, which he won on April 30, at Backlash, after Stone Cold Steve Austin intervened on his behalf.[120][121] The following night on *Raw*, he successfully defended his title against Shane McMahon in a Steel Cage match. On May 21, at Judgment Day, the Rock faced Triple H in an Iron Man match with Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee.[122] With the score tied at five falls each, and with seconds left on the time limit, the Rock was disqualified when The Undertaker attacked Triple H, thus giving Triple H the 6\u20135 win and the title.[122][123] The Rock won the WWF Championship for a fifth time at King of the Ring on June 25 by scoring the winning pin in a six-man tag team match, teaming with Kane and The Undertaker against Shane McMahon, Triple H and Vince McMahon, whom he pinned.[124][125] The Rock successfully defended the championship against Chris Benoit, on July 23, at Fully Loaded. The next month, he successfully defended his title against Kurt Angle and Triple H at SummerSlam. The Rock had another successful title defense against Benoit, Kane and The Undertaker, on September 24, at Unforgiven.[126]\n\n\nThe Rock then lost the WWF Championship to Kurt Angle, at No Mercy, on October 22, 2000.[127] The next month, the Rock feuded with Rikishi and defeated him at Survivor Series.[128] The Rock wrestled a six-man Hell in a Cell match for the WWF Championship, at Armageddon, which Angle won to retain the title.[129] On the December 18 episode of *Raw*, the Rock won the WWF Tag Team Championship with The Undertaker, defeating Edge and Christian, before losing it back to them the next night at a *SmackDown!* taping.[130] In 2001, the Rock continued to feud with Angle over the WWF Championship, culminating at No Way Out on February 25, 2001, where he pinned Angle to win the WWF Championship for a sixth time.[131][132] The Rock then feuded with the Royal Rumble winner, Stone Cold Steve Austin, whom he lost the title to at WrestleMania X-Seven after Austin allied with Vince McMahon, who interfered on his behalf.[133] On the next night's *Raw Is War*, during a steel cage title rematch, Triple H attacked the Rock, allying with McMahon and Austin and helping Austin retain the championship.[134] Austin and Triple H then formed a tag team called The Power Trip,[135] while the Rock was indefinitely suspended in storyline. Johnson used this time off to act in *The Scorpion King*.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock taunting an opponent at ringside at *WWF Raw*, October 2001\nThe Rock returned in late July 2001 when the WWF was feuding with rival promotions World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) during what is known as The Invasion storyline. In reality, WCW was purchased by Vince McMahon and the WWF, and ECW had gone out of business in early 2001. Many former WCW and ECW wrestlers were then brought onto WWF television and formed The Alliance to compete with WWF in storyline. The Alliance and Vince McMahon then both attempted to persuade the Rock to join their team. The Rock then aligned with McMahon and the WWF. The next month, the Rock defeated Booker T, at SummerSlam, to win the WCW Championship for the first time.[136][137] He later lost the title to Chris Jericho at No Mercy on October 21, 2001.[138][139] The next night on *Raw*, he teamed with Jericho to win the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Dudley Boyz. The two then lost the tag titles to Booker T and Test on the November 1, 2001, episode of *SmackDown!*.[140] The Rock defeated Jericho on the November 5 episode of *Raw* for his second WCW Championship.[141]\n\n\nAs part of the WWF's battle against The Alliance, the Rock wrestled in a \"winner takes all\" five-on-five elimination tag team match at Survivor Series where the losing team's company would be dissolved in storyline. He was a member of Team WWF along with Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and Big Show. The Alliance's team consisted of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Booker T, Rob Van Dam, and Shane McMahon. In the end, it came down to a one-on-one between the Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Rock seemed to have the upper hand, until his teammate Jericho entered the ring and attacked the Rock. Austin tried to capitalize on this by pinning the Rock, but Kurt Angle revealed his true allegiance by attacking Austin. The Rock then pinned Austin, giving Team WWF the victory and forcing The Alliance to disband. The Rock's WCW Championship was renamed the unbranded \"World Championship\" following the Alliance's loss.[142] At the next pay-per-view, Vengeance on December 9, 2001, the Rock lost the World Championship to Jericho, who would then unify the WWF and World titles later that night.[143] The Rock then unsuccessfully challenged Jericho for the now Undisputed WWF Championship at Royal Rumble on January 20, 2002.[144]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock doing his signature pose before wrestling Hulk Hogan (bottom right) at WrestleMania X8, March 2002\nAt the next pay-per-view, No Way Out on February 17, 2002, the Rock defeated The Undertaker in a singles match. The event also saw the WWF debut of the famed WCW faction New World Order, which at the time consisted of \"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall.[145] This later led to a match between the Rock and Hogan at WrestleMania X8 on March 17, 2002. The match was billed as \"icon versus icon\", with both men representing the top tier of two generations of wrestling; ultimately the Rock pinned Hogan at WrestleMania X8 to win the match.[146] Despite the Rock portraying a heroic character and Hogan a villain, a portion of the crowd attending the SkyDome was rooting heavily for Hogan.[147][148] In an interview in 2013, Hogan said he and the Rock changed the style of the match on the fly based on the crowd's response.[149] After the introduction of the first-ever brand extension, the WWF held a \"draft lottery\" on the March 25, 2002, episode of *Raw*. The Rock was the number one overall pick, going to the SmackDown! brand before taking a sabbatical from wrestling.[150]\n\n\nThe Rock made a surprise return on a June episode of *Raw* before going to his assigned brand of SmackDown!. There, he was named the number one contender for the WWE Undisputed Championship, which he won for a record-setting seventh time at Vengeance, on July 21, by defeating Kurt Angle and then-champion The Undertaker in a Triple Threat match.[151][152] The Rock successfully defended the title at the Global Warning event against Triple H and Brock Lesnar after pinning Triple H.[153] On August 25, at SummerSlam, after interference from Lesnar's manager Paul Heyman, the Rock lost the WWE Undisputed Championship to Lesnar along with the record for the youngest WWE Champion, which he had set in 1998.[154] In 2018, writing for *ESPN.com*, Sean Coyle noted in a retrospective review of the event, that following his victory over Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania X8, the Rock \"started to see a dip in fan support\" and \"that dip turned into a plunge\" by the time Rock had his match with Lesnar at SummerSlam because fans knew he was leaving WWE to pursue an acting career,[155] as evidenced by the negative crowd response during his match with Lesnar.[156] After SummerSlam ended, the Rock was visibly angry at the crowd reaction. When he tried to do a post-show speech for the crowd, the fans booed him.[157] The Rock then took time off to kickstart his acting career.[158]\n\n\n\n#### Final feuds and departure (2003\u20132004)[edit]\n\n\nThe Rock returned on the January 30, 2003, episode of *SmackDown!* to set up another match with Hulk Hogan at No Way Out.[159] Because of negative fan reaction during previous matches as a result of his budding acting career, The Rock turned heel for the first time since 1999. He also started a new persona that has been called *Hollywood Rock*, with a new look and a shaved head.[160][161] The Rock defeated Hogan at No Way Out before moving to the Raw brand.[162] There, he had various small feuds, including one with The Hurricane.[163] He also began performing \"Rock Concerts\", segments in which he played the guitar and mocked WWE performers and fans in song.[164]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin (left) in Austin's final match at WrestleMania XIX in March 2003.\nAfter failing to win a number one contendership for the World Heavyweight Championship, The Rock went into another program with Stone Cold Steve Austin. This led to a match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30, 2003, which called back to their previous two WrestleMania encounters, both of which Austin had won.[165] The Rock won after delivering three consecutive *Rock Bottoms*, ending their long-running rivalry in what turned out to be Austin's final match.[2][166] The next night, *Raw* was billed as \"The Rock Appreciation Night\", in honor of his victory over Austin. That night, he was attacked by a debuting Goldberg.[167] At Backlash on April 27, 2003, Goldberg defeated The Rock, who then briefly left WWE to film *Walking Tall*.[2][168]\n\n\nDuring the rest of the year, The Rock made occasional appearances, returning to a face character.[169] In 2004, The Rock aided Mick Foley in his feud against Evolution,[3][2][170] leading to a reunion of the Rock 'n' Sock Connection. They lost against Ric Flair, Randy Orton, and Batista in a handicap match at WrestleMania XX on March 14, 2004, when Orton pinned Foley after an *RKO*.[2][171] This was Johnson's final wrestling match until November 2011. The Rock appeared in WWE sporadically following WrestleMania XX. He made returns to provide support for Eugene against Jonathan Coachman, and made a cameo in his hometown of Miami and helped Mick Foley against La R\u00e9sistance.[2] Later in 2004, he hosted a pie-eating contest, as part of the WWE Diva Search, and ended the segment by giving Coachman a *People's Elbow*.[2] The Rock's contract with WWE then ended and he started his full-time acting career.[172]\n\n\n\n#### Non-wrestling appearances (2007\u20132009)[edit]\n\n\nOn March 12, 2007, the Rock appeared on a WWE show after nearly three years, via a pre-taped promo shown during *Raw*. He correctly predicted that Bobby Lashley would defeat Umaga at WrestleMania 23 in Donald Trump's and Vince McMahon's \"Battle of the Billionaires\" Hair vs. Hair match.[173] On March 29, 2008, Johnson inducted his father Rocky Johnson and grandfather Peter Maivia into the WWE Hall of Fame.[174] His next appearance was through a pre-taped promo on October 2, 2009, during the *Decade of SmackDown*.[175]\n\n\n\n### Independent circuit (2009)[edit]\n\n\nOn September 30, 2009, the Rock appeared at a World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) show to support the professional wrestling debut of Sarona Snuka, the daughter of his longtime friend and mentor Jimmy Snuka.[176]\n\n\n\n### Return to WWE[edit]\n\n\n#### Feud with John Cena (2011\u20132013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rock in the ring as WrestleMania XXVII host, April 2011\nOn February 14, 2011, the Rock was announced as the host of WrestleMania XXVII on April 3, 2011, appearing live on *Raw* for the first time in almost seven years. During a lengthy promo, he addressed the fans and started a feud with John Cena.[177][178] After numerous appearances via satellite, the Rock appeared live on the *Raw* before WrestleMania XXVII to confront Cena. After he and Cena exchanged insults, The Miz and Alex Riley appeared and attacked the Rock; he fended off Miz and Riley, only for Cena to blindside him with an *Attitude Adjustment*.[179]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock and John Cena (left) on *Raw*, agreeing to a match at WrestleMania XXVIII one year in advance\nOn April 3, at WrestleMania XXVII, the Rock opened the show by cutting a promo. After appearing in numerous backstage segments, the Rock came to ringside to restart the main event between Cena and The Miz as a No Disqualification match, after it had ended in a draw. As revenge for the *Attitude Adjustment* Cena had given him on *Raw*, Rock hit Cena with the *Rock Bottom*, allowing The Miz to pin him and retain the WWE Championship. After the match, Rock attacked Miz and hit him with the *People's Elbow*.[180] The next night on *Raw*, the Rock and Cena agreed to a match at WrestleMania XXVIII the next year. They then worked together to fend off an attack by The Corre, which at the time consisted of Wade Barrett, Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel, and Ezekiel Jackson.[181]\n\n\nThe Rock appeared live on *Raw* in his hometown of Miami to celebrate his 39th birthday.[182] On September 16, WWE announced the Rock would wrestle in a traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series tag team match, teaming with Cena at Survivor Series in November.[183] But on the October 24 episode of *Raw*, Cena instead suggested the Rock be his partner in a standard tag team match against The Miz and R-Truth, a team called Awesome Truth,[184] which Rock agreed to the next week.[185] On November 14, during the special *Raw Gets Rocked*, the Rock appeared live, delivering *Rock Bottom*s to Mick Foley, who had been hosting a \"This Is Your Life\"-style segment for Cena, and later both members of Awesome Truth.[186] The Rock and Cena defeated Awesome Truth on November 20 at Survivor Series, when the Rock pinned The Miz. After the match, the Rock gave Cena a *Rock Bottom*.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock celebrating his victory at WrestleMania XXVIII, April 2012\nLeading up to WrestleMania, the Rock and Cena had several verbal confrontations on *Raw*.[188][189] On the March 12, 2012, episode of *Raw*, the Rock hosted his first \"Rock Concert\" segment since 2004, mocking Cena in his songs.[190] On April 1, at WrestleMania XXVIII, the Rock defeated Cena in the main event after countering Cena's attempt at a *People's Elbow* into a *Rock Bottom* and pinning Cena.[191] This event broke the record for biggest professional wrestling pay-per-view buyrate. The following night on *Raw*, the Rock praised Cena, calling their match \"an honor\". He then vowed to once again become WWE Champion.[192]\n\n\nOn July 23, at *Raw 1000*, the Rock announced he would wrestle for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view. During the show, he encountered then-reigning WWE Champion CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, and John Cena, all of whom expressed a desire to face him. The Rock later saved Cena from an assault by Big Show, only to be laid out by CM Punk.[193] On the January 7, 2013, episode of *Raw*, the Rock returned to confront his Royal Rumble opponent CM Punk.[194] On January 11, he made his first *SmackDown* appearance in ten years, getting into an altercation with Team Rhodes Scholars, resulting in him delivering a *Rock Bottom* to Damien Sandow and a *People's Elbow* to Cody Rhodes.[195] The Rock closed out the 20th-anniversary episode of *Raw*, on January 14, with one of his \"Rock Concerts\", leading to a brawl with CM Punk.[196] The following week on *Raw*, the Rock was attacked by The Shield. Vince McMahon then asserted that if The Shield attacked the Rock in his title match with CM Punk, Punk would be stripped of the WWE Championship.[197]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock revealing the brand new WWE Championship design on *WWE Raw*, February 2013\nOn January 27, at the Royal Rumble, CM Punk would seemingly defeat the Rock after the arena lights went out and someone attacked the Rock. Vince McMahon then came out and was about to strip Punk of the championship, however, at the Rock's request, he instead restarted the match. This culminated in the Rock defeating Punk to win his eighth WWE Championship.[198] Punk received a title rematch with the Rock, at Elimination Chamber on February 17, 2013, with the added stipulation that if the Rock was disqualified or counted out, he would still lose the WWE Championship. The Rock would pin Punk to defeat him and retain the championship.[199] The following night on *Raw*, the Rock unveiled a new WWE Championship design, with a different center plate and removable customizable side-plates which had his \"Brahma Bull\" logo.[200] The Rock then resumed his rivalry with John Cena, who won that year's Royal Rumble to set up a rematch of the previous WrestleMania match between the two at WrestleMania 29, only this time with the WWE Championship on the line.[201][202]\n\n\nOn April 7, at WrestleMania 29, Rock lost the WWE Championship to Cena, ending his reign at 70 days.[203] Despite being advertised for *Raw* after WrestleMania, where it was stated that the Rock was still entitled a rematch for the WWE Championship,[204] The Rock did not appear because of a real injury sustained during his match with Cena, in which his abdominal and adductor tendons tore from his pelvis.[205] Johnson underwent surgery on April 23 to reattach the torn tendons.[206]\n\n\n\n#### Sporadic appearances (2014\u20132023)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rock (right) confronts Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania XXX, April 2014.\n![](image)The Wyatt Family confronting The Rock at WrestleMania 32, April 2016\nIn April 2014, the Rock appeared in the opening segment of WrestleMania XXX along with Stone Cold Steve Austin and Hulk Hogan.[207] On the October 6 episode of *Raw*, the Rock made a surprise appearance to confront Rusev and Lana; this resulted in the Rock clearing Rusev from the ring.[208]\n\n\nThe Rock appeared at the 2015 Royal Rumble event on January 25, 2015, during the main event match, where he helped his relative Roman Reigns fend off Big Show and Kane after Reigns eliminated them from the match. Reigns then won the match and the Rock endorsed him in the ring.[209][210][211] The Rock appeared at WrestleMania 31 on March 29, 2015, alongside Ronda Rousey, getting into an in-ring altercation with Triple H and Stephanie McMahon.

The Rock got into a verbal back-and-forth with Bray Wyatt before having an impromptu match with Wyatt Family member Erick Rowan. The Rock won after giving Rowan a *Rock Bottom* and pinning him in six seconds, which set the record for the fastest win in WrestleMania history. The Rock was then aided by a returning John Cena to fend off Wyatt, Rowan and Braun Strowman.[215] On the February 20, 2017, episode of *Raw*, the Rock made an untelevised appearance after the broadcast had gone off the air, where he promoted and filmed a scene for his then-upcoming film *Fighting with My Family*.[216]\n\n\nOn August 3, 2019, the Rock officially announced his retirement from professional wrestling.[217] On September 30, 2019, after weeks of speculation, the Rock announced that he would appear on *SmackDown*'s 20th Anniversary on October 4, 2019, marking his first appearance on SmackDown since October 2014 and his first televised appearance since April 2016.[218] At the event, he cut a promo with Becky Lynch before they were interrupted by King Corbin.

Many have placed the Rock on their \"Mount Rushmore of Pro Wrestling\", including Hulk Hogan,[250] Ric Flair,[251] and John Cena.[252] In \"Cable Visions: Television Beyond Broadcasting\", the Rock was described as \"for a long time, the WWE's biggest star and probably held the greatest international appeal\".[253] R. D. Reynolds stated in his book \"The WrestleCrap Book of Lists\" that the Rock was \"the biggest star for WWE from 1999 until 2004\".[254]\n\n\nThe Rock's \"I quit\" match with Mankind at the 1999 Royal Rumble event is infamous for its brutality and one of the most popular \"I quit\" match of all times.[255][256][257][258]\n\n\nThe Rock main-evented the most bought pay-per-view worldwide in WWE history (WrestleMania XXVIII),[259] the most bought pay-per-view domestically in WWE history (WrestleMania X-Seven), the highest rated *Raw* in history,[260][261] the highest rated *SmackDown* in history,[262] and was part of the highest rated cable segment in WWE history with Mankind entitled \"This is Your Life\", in which Mankind would honor The Rock with various gifts and reunions.[263][264] His return in 2001 had a 7.1 rating, the highest-rated segment of the year.

It is the third time that the two collaborated, after *Central Intelligence* and *Skyscraper*.[311][312] It co-stars Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds.[313]\n\n\nJohnson is noted for his busy schedule and developing multiple projects at once.[314][315] A sequel to the box-office hit *San Andreas* was announced to be in the pre-production stage with the director of the first film, Brad Peyton, returning as director along with the main cast (marking the fourth collaboration between the two following *Journey 2*, *San Andreas*, and *Rampage*).[316][296]\n\n\nOn November 14, 2019, he announced a December 2021 release date for the standalone *Black Adam* film.[317] Production on *Black Adam* began filming in April 2021 with it set to release on October 21, 2022.[318][319] He earned $22.5 million to star in the film and received millions more for producing and promoting it on social media.[320]\n\n\nJohnson has been a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in the Actor's Branch since 2017.[321]\n\n\nOn March 16, 2021, he appeared for the first time as The Foundation in Fortnite Battle Royale. Johnson was initially uncredited in his role, yet teased his involvement in a cryptic Instagram post shared on the day of the event. Following another Instagram video for Johnson's ZOA Energy drink, in which The Foundation's helmet and sidearm were subtly featured in the background, his involvement was finally confirmed during the Chapter 2 End Event on December 4, 2021, with The Foundation removing his helmet to reveal that he shared Johnson's voice and likeness.[322]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Johnson reprised his role as Luke Hobbs in a cameo appearance during the mid-credits scene of *Fast X*.\n\n\n\n## Producer[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Johnson founded his production company Seven Bucks Productions.[24]\n\n\nThough originally attached as producer and star, Johnson will now serve solely as the former on a film adaptation of *The Janson Directive*. John Cena will fill the leading role, with Akiva Goldsman attached as screenwriter.[323] Additionally, he will produce and star in a Netflix exclusive film titled *John Henry & The Statesmen*, as the titular folklore hero. The film will be directed by Jake Kasdan, from a script by Kasdan and Tom Wheeler. With the first official teaser trailer released in October 2018, the project marks Kasdan's and Johnson's third collaboration, after *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle* and *Jumanji: The Next Level*.[324]\n\n\nIn 2019, Johnson produced and appeared as himself in *Fighting with My Family*, a comedy drama about Paige and her family, who are also professional wrestlers.[325][326]\n\n\nJohnson will co-produce and star in *The King*, a film about king Kamehameha K\u016bnui\u0101kea, founder and first ruler of the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi. The project will be directed by Robert Zemeckis from a script by Randall Wallace. The movie will be comparable to *Braveheart* in tone, given Wallace's work on both films, and will depict the king's role in resolving the wars among the islands of Hawai\u02bbi. *The King* was scheduled to begin production in 2020, but was halted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[327] Johnson is also attached to produce/star in a sequel to *Big Trouble in Little China*,[328][329] as well as project under development with Shane Black focusing on a new interpretation of Doc Savage.[330]\n\n\nIn 2021, his biographical comedy-drama series *Young Rock* began airing on NBC.[331]\n\n\nA film centered around Teth-Adam/Black Adam, a part of the DC Extended Universe, was announced to be in development in January 2017. Originally cast in the role as early as September 2014 as the antagonist, in a film centered around the superhero Billy Batson/Shazam,[332][333] his villainous role for *Shazam!* was reworked into two separate films.[334] Johnson did not appear in *Shazam!*, but he served as a producer and his likeness was used through special effects in flashback scenes.[335][336]\n\n\n\n## Other work[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, Johnson published his autobiography, *The Rock Says...*, co-written with Joe Layden. It debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list and remained on the list for several weeks.[22]\n\n\nIn 2013, Johnson hosted and produced the TNT reality competition series *The Hero*.[286][337] In 2014, he hosted another TNT reality series, *Wake Up Call*.[294] In 2019, Johnson started hosting the NBC competition series *The Titan Games*.[338]\n\n\nIn March 2016, Johnson partnered with American fitness apparel manufacturer Under Armour to release \"Project Rock\".[339] The first item in his partnership with Under Armour, a gym bag, sold out in a couple of days.[340][341] His second item, a black T-shirt sporting his signature \"Brahma bull\", sold out after being worn at WrestleMania 32.[342] Johnson also released an alarm clock app as part of \"Project Rock\" that received more than one million downloads in its first week of release.[343] Since then, they have released sneakers, headphones, and other apparel.[344]\n\n\nIn 2016, Johnson started his YouTube channel. His first video, *The YouTube Factory*, featured online personality Lilly Singh and several other internet stars.[345]\n\n\nIn 2019, Johnson announced he would launch a competitive bodybuilding show, \"Athleticon\", with his business partner and ex-wife Dany Garcia. It is set to rival other long-standing bodybuilding shows such as The Arnold Classic and Joe Weider's Mr. Olympia.[346] The show was set to debut in October 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia, but plans were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[346]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Johnson launched Teremana Tequila which sold 600,000 nine-litre cases in its first year.[347]\n\n\nA fan of the rapper Tech N9ne,[348] Johnson is featured on the song \"Face Off\" from the rapper's 2021 album *Asin9ne*.[349]\n\n\n\n## Activism and philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nJohnson attended the 2000 Democratic National Convention[350] as part of WWE's non-partisan \"Smackdown Your Vote\" campaign, which aimed to influence young people to vote.[351] He also had a speaking role at the 2000 Republican National Convention.[352]\n\n\nJohnson voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections.[245] He did not vote in the 2016 election,[353] and is an independent voter as of 2017[update].[354] He endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.[355] Johnson has expressed interest in running for president himself, telling *USA Today* in February 2021, \"I would consider a presidential run in the future if that's what the people wanted\".[356] Following an online public opinion poll that found that 46% of Americans would consider voting for Johnson in a presidential election, he said in an April 12, 2021, interview on *The Today Show*, \"I do have that goal to unite our country and I also feel that if this is what the people want, then I will do that\".[357]\n\n\nIn 2006, Johnson founded the Dwayne Johnson Rock Foundation, a charity working with at-risk and terminally ill children.[358] On October 2, 2007, he and his then wife, Dany Garcia, donated $1\u00a0million to the University of Miami to support the renovation of its football facilities. The university renamed the Hurricanes' locker room in Johnson's honor.[359] In 2015, Johnson donated $1,500 to a GoFundMe to pay for an abandoned dog's surgery.[360] In 2017, he donated $25,000 to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts.[361] In 2018, Johnson donated a gym to a military base in Oahu, Hawaii.[362] After the 2018 Hawaii floods, he worked with Malama Kauai, a nonprofit organization, to help repair flood damage.[363] Johnson has also worked with Make-A-Wish Foundation on a number of occasions.[364]\n\n\nIn July 2023, Johnson made a seven-figure donation to the SAG-AFTRA Foundation during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, which foundation president Courtney B. Vance cited to be \"the largest single donation that (the foundation) has ever received from one individual at one time\".[365]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nJohnson first met fellow University of Miami student Dany Garcia in the early 1990s. They married on May 3, 1997. She is a businesswoman, IFBB professional bodybuilder, and producer.[366] Their daughter, Simone, was born on August 14, 2001.[366][367] On June 1, 2007, Johnson and Garcia announced they were separating amicably,[366] and their divorce was finalized in May 2008.[368]\n\n\nIn 2007, Johnson began dating Lauren Hashian, the daughter of Boston drummer Sib Hashian.[369] They first met in 2006 while Johnson was filming *The Game Plan*.[370] They were married on August 18, 2019, in Hawaii.[371][372][373] They have two daughters.[374][375] Johnson and Hashian live in Los Angeles, also maintaining a farm in Virginia[376] and a home in Southwest Ranches, Florida.[377][378]\n\n\nIn recognition of his service to the Samoan people, and because he is a descendant of Samoan chiefs, Johnson was given the noble title *Seiuli* (meaning the son of Malietoa [*Alo o Malietoa*]) by Malietoa Tanumafili II during his visit there on August 9, 2004.[379] In 2009, he gained Canadian citizenship through his father's birth and citizenship there.[380] He got a partial Samoan pe'a tattoo on his left side in 2003.[381] In 2017, he had the small \"Brahma bull\" tattoo on his right arm covered with a larger half-sleeve tattoo of a bull's skull.[382]\n\n\nIn February 2020, WWE announced that Johnson's daughter Simone had started training at the WWE Performance Center,[383] making her the first fourth-generation WWE wrestler.[384] On May 16, Johnson announced she had signed a contract with WWE,[385] and in May 2022 announced that her ring name would be Ava Raine. She has since been appearing on the NXT brand.[386]\n\n\nJohnson is a supporter of the Samoa national rugby league team, and publicly pledged his support to the team during the 2021 Rugby League World Cup where they made the Final for the first time.[387][388]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### Singles[edit]\n\n\n#### As lead artist[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of singles as lead artist, with selected chart positions\n| Title\n | Year\n | Peak chart positions\n | Certifications | Album\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US[389] | CAN[390] |\n| \"You're Welcome\"\n | 2016\n | 83 | 85\n | * RIAA: 6\u00d7 Platinum[391]\n* BPI: Platinum[392]\n | *Moana: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack* |\n\n\n#### As featured artist[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of singles as lead artist, with selected chart positions\n| Title\n | Year\n | Peak chart positions\n | Album\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US[393] | USR&B/HH[394] | CAN[395] |\n| \"It Doesn't Matter\"(Wyclef Jean featuring the Rock and Melky Sedeck) | 2000\n | \u2014 | 80 | \u2014[A] | *The Ecleftic: 2 Sides II a Book* |\n| \"Face Off\"(Tech N9ne featuring Joey Cool, King Iso, and Dwayne Johnson)[397] | 2021\n | \u2014[B] | 45 | 77\n | *Asin9ne* |\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dwayne Johnson filmography\n\n## Championships and accomplishments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rock in Nashville during his eighth and final WWE Championship reign, February 2013\n![](image)The Rock at *Mayhem in Manchester* in Manchester, England during one of his two Intercontinental Championship reigns, April 1998\n* ***Pro Wrestling Illustrated***\n\t+ Match of the Year (1999) vs. Mankind in an \"I Quit\" match at Royal Rumble[399][400]\n\t+ Match of the Year (2002) vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania X8[399][400]\n\t+ Most Popular Wrestler of the Year (1999, 2000)[399]\n\t+ Wrestler of the Year (2000)[399]\n\t+ Ranked No. 2 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the *PWI 500* in 2000[401]\n* **United States Wrestling Association**\n\t+ USWA World Tag Team Championship (2 times) \u2013 with Bart Sawyer[402]\n* ***Wrestling Observer Newsletter***\n\t+ Best Box Office Draw (2000, 2011, 2012)[403][404][405]\n\t+ Best Gimmick (1999)[403]\n\t+ Best on Interviews (1999, 2000)[403]\n\t+ Most Charismatic (1999\u20132002, 2011, 2012)[403][404][405]\n\t+ Most Improved (1998)[403]\n\t+ Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame (Class of 2007)[406]\n* **WWE/World Wrestling Entertainment/Federation**\n\t+ WWE Championship[a] (8 times)[407][408]\n\t+ WCW Championship[b] (2 times)[409][410]\n\t+ WWF Intercontinental Championship (2 times)[411]\n\t+ WWF Tag Team Championship (5 times) \u2013 with Mankind (3), The Undertaker (1), and Chris Jericho (1)[412]\n\t+ Royal Rumble (2000)[3]\n\t+ Sixth Triple Crown Champion[413]\n\t+ Deadly Games WWF Championship Tournament (1998)[414]\n\t+ Slammy Award (9 times)\n\t\t- Best Actor (2014)[415]\n\t\t- Game Changer of the Year (2011) \u2013 with John Cena[416]\n\t\t- Guess Who's Back or: Return of the Year (2011)[417]\n\t\t- LOL!

The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.[622]\n\n\nRonaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.[623]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the World Cup, despite having his future with the national team in doubt, after rumours of a possible omission by new manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez, Ronaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Luxembourg.[463] On 23 March, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 4\u20130 win over Liechtenstein; with his 197th international appearance, he overtook Al-Mutawa's record and became the most capped male footballer of all time.[464] On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers, as he became the first player in the history of men's international football to make 200 appearances for his country.[465] On 13 October, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 3\u20132 win over Slovakia, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2024, marking the nation's fastest qualification to a major tournament in their history.[466]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n### Style of play[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Varies between 1.85 and 1.89 by source. *FIFA and Sports Illustrated* give 1.85,[2][3] Luca Caioli\u00a0[es; fi] 1.86,[4] Soccerway and Eurosport 1.87,[5] Premier League 1.87,[6] and the Portuguese Football Federation 1.89.[7]\n2. **^** Although there was no third-place playoff, both losing semi-finalists (Germany and Portugal) were awarded bronze medals by UEFA.[8]\n3. **^** The terminology for the award has varied.

Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRonaldo has been the subject of several works. His autobiography, titled *Moments*, was published in December 2007.[566] His sponsor Castrol produced the television film *Ronaldo: Tested to the Limit*, in which he was physically and mentally tested in several areas; his physical performance was consequently subject to scrutiny by world media upon the film's release in September 2011.[527] *Cristiano Ronaldo: The World at His Feet*, a documentary narrated by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, was released via Vimeo in June 2014.[567] A documentary film directed by Anthony Wonke about his life and career, titled *Ronaldo*, was released on 9 November 2015.[568][569]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n200. **^** \"Cristiano Ronaldo scores a hat-trick as Real Madrid beat Shakhtar\".

While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints,[469][470] such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark;[471] he has also been known to use the flip-flap.[472]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Ronaldo in a Premier League match against Newcastle in September 2021, his first game back at Manchester United\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRonaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4\u20130 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt.[44] His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as \"undoubtedly the most exciting debut\" he had ever seen.[38] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3\u20130 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[45] Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,[46] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career.[47] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3\u20130 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a \"one-fingered gesture\" towards Benfica fans,[58] and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3\u20131 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole.[59] Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play.[60] Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off,[61] Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident.[62] United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 30 December 2022, Saudi club Al Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club effective 1 January 2023, signing a contract until 2025.[331] As reported by Fabrizio Romano of *The Guardian*, Ronaldo received the highest football salary in history, worth \u20ac200\u00a0million per year;[332][333] this included an annual guaranteed football salary of \u20ac90\u00a0million, with commercial and sponsorship deals included bringing his total annual salary to \u20ac200\u00a0million.

throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin.[519][520][521] After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a \"storming jump\" and \"turn\", before \"landing in spread-eagled fashion\"[520] into his \"signature power stance\",[521] while usually simultaneously exclaiming \"S\u00ed\" (Spanish and Italian for \"yes\").[519][522] This trademark celebration has been dubbed the \"Sii\" in the

Osasuna and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point.[142][143][144] Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, helping Madrid win their first

While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 or 4\u20133\u20133 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nback-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de F\u00fatbol Profesional,[184] which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.[185]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n367. **^** Chick, Alex (6 July 2006). \"Scolari's fortunes take a dive\". *ESPN FC*.

An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known.[65] He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading.[66][67][68] Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.[69]\n\n\n\n#### 2007\u20132008: collective and individual success[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished.[483] Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit.[483][484][485] Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade \u20ac4.1\u00a0million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of \u20ac5.1\u00a0million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay \u20ac1.7\u00a0million and \u20ac1.4\u00a0million in fines.[676] Facing the judge, he said, \"I just played football.

A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou.[48] Capello sought to take Messi to Juventus on loan, but Inter Milan offered to pay his \u20ac150\u00a0million buyout clause and triple his wages.[49] According to then-president Joan Laporta, it was the only time the club faced a real risk of losing Messi, but he ultimately decided to stay.[50] On 16 September, his contract was updated for the second time in three months and extended to 2014.[41][51]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20.[61] Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the Ballon d'Or, commented, \"I'm not even the best at Bar\u00e7a\", in reference to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.[565][566] Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin,[75] the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history.[12][536][567] An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen.[568] In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players,[115][569] and by the end of Bar\u00e7a's second treble-winning season, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n630. **^** Borg, Chris (2 December 2014). \"Ballon D'Or: Lionel Messi vs. Cristiano Ronaldo \u2013 Battle of the Brands\".

During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \"The Machine of '87\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.[16][17] However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[18] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they declined to pay for his treatment.[19][20] His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \"the best forward I've ever seen\".[21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Messi holding off Sevilla's \u00c9ver Banega during the 2015 UEFA Super Cup\nMessi opened the 2015\u201316 season by scoring twice from free kicks in Barcelona's 5\u20134 victory (after extra time) over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[192] On 16 September, he became the youngest player to make 100 appearances in the UEFA Champions League in a 1\u20131 away draw to Roma.[193] After a knee injury, he returned to the pitch on 21 November, making a substitute appearance in Barcelona's 4\u20130 away win over rivals Real Madrid in *El Cl\u00e1sico*.[194] Messi capped off the year by winning the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup final on 20 December, collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as Barcelona defeated River Plate 3\u20130 in Yokohama.[195] On 30 December, Messi scored on his 500th appearance for Barcelona, in a 4\u20130 home win over Real Betis.[196]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[19][22] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the *Infantiles* due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs Messi maintained his goalscoring form into the second half of the season, the year 2012 saw him break several longstanding records. On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying Jos\u00e9 Altafini's record from the 1962\u201363 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd M\u00fcller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of C\u00e9sar Rodr\u00edguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[130]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n247. **^** Lowe, Sid (10 December 2018). \"'His Magnum opus': even for Lionel Messi, this was special\". *The Guardian*.

Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent *La Albiceleste* since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA.

Upon the latter's departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt.[54] He signed a new contract in July with an annual salary of \u20ac7.8\u00a0million, becoming the club's highest-paid player.[81][82] Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential.[64][83] Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.[75][84]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 23 December, Messi scored his 644th goal for Barcelona against Real Valladolid in La Liga, surpassing Pel\u00e9 with Santos as the player with the most goals scored for a single club.[305][306] In order to celebrate his achievement, Budweiser sent personalised bottles of beer to every goalkeeper whom Messi has scored against.[307] On 17 January 2021, Messi was sent off for the first time in his club career for violent conduct (swinging an arm at the head of Asier Villalibre, missed initially by the referee but reviewed via VAR) in the final minutes of Barcelona's 2\u20133 extra time defeat to Athletic Bilbao in the 2020\u201321 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a Final.[308] On 10 March, Messi scored from 35 yards out and later had a penalty saved in a 1\u20131 draw against Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 as Barcelona were eliminated at this stage for the first time in 14 years by an aggregate score of 2\u20135 after having lost 1\u20134 at home on 16 February, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAn Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and also holds the national record for appearances.

Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association.[660][661] Messi has served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the recent earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.[662] To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.[663]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nhe received the *Guinness World Records* title for most goals scored in a calendar year.[141][142] As the odds-on favourite, Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times.[140][143]\n\n\n\n#### 2013\u20132014: *Messidependencia*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi made his first appearance of the season on 17 September, and on 6 October he scored his first goal of the season with a free kick in a 4\u20130 home win over Sevilla; this was his 420th goal in La Liga, which saw him break Cristiano Ronaldo's record of 419 goals scored in Europe's top five leagues.[269] On 23 October, Messi scored his first Champions League goal of the season in a 2\u20131 away win over Slavia Prague, becoming the first player to score in 15 consecutive Champions League seasons (excluding qualifying rounds).[270] He also equalled Ra\u00fal and Cristiano Ronaldo's shared record of the most sides scored against in the competition (33).[271] On 29 October, Messi scored in a 5\u20131 home win over Real Valladolid in La Liga; his first goal \u2013 a set piece from 35 yards \u2013 was the 50th free-kick of his career.[272] His goals (608) also saw him overtake Cristiano Ronaldo's senior goal tally (606) at club level.[273] On 9 November, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Bar\u00e7a's new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname \"Messiah\" from the Spanish media.[19][73][74] His efforts in 2007 also earned him award recognition; journalists voted him the third-best player of the year for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, behind Kak\u00e1 and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kak\u00e1.[75][76] Although he managed to score 16 goals during the 2007\u201308 campaign,[77] the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December.[78] He returned to score twice in their away victory against Celtic in the last 16 round of the Champions League, becoming the competition's top scorer at that point with six goals,[79] but reinjured himself during the return leg on 4 March 2008. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Lowe, Sid (17 May 2010). \"La Liga Title the Least Barcelona Deserve as Madrid Again Finish Empty Handed\". *The Guardian*.

A month later, on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B, and his buyout clause automatically increased to \u20ac80\u00a0million.[32][41] He played five games with the B team that season but did not score.[42] Physically he was weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAware of his physical limitations, Messi employed a personal trainer to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in an improved condition in time for the World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 1\u20130 defeat, the squad's senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil.

His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Mat\u00edas, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.[654]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing his announcement, a campaign began in Argentina for Messi to change his mind about retiring.[454] He was greeted by fans with signs like \"Don't go, Leo\" when the team landed in Buenos Aires. President of Argentina Mauricio Macri urged Messi not to quit, stating, \"We are lucky, it is one of life's pleasures, it is a gift from God to have the best player in the world in a footballing country like ours... Lionel Messi is the greatest thing we have in Argentina and we must take care of him.\"[455] Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodr\u00edguez Larreta unveiled a statue of Messi in the capital to convince him to reconsider retirement.[456] The campaign also continued in the streets and avenues of the Argentine capital, with about 50,000 supporters going to the Obelisco de Buenos Aires on 2 July, using the same slogan.[457]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"A lot of things went through my mind on the night of the final and I gave serious thought to quitting, but my love for my country and this shirt is too great.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDue to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles;[531][532] this has led the Spanish media to dub him ***La Pulga At\u00f3mica*** (\"The Atomic Flea\").[533][534][535] Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting.[16][532][536] His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed.[537] His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, \"Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.\"[45] Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Messi making his Maradona-esque run against Getafe in 2007\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Messi's six Ballon d'Or awards on display in the FC Barcelona Museum.

acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play.[51][52] Wearing the number 19 shirt, he gradually established himself as the first-choice right winger, forming an attacking trio with Ronaldinho and striker Samuel Eto'o.[29][53][54] He was in the starting line-up in major matches like his first *Cl\u00e1sico* against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November, as well as Barcelona's away victory over Chelsea in the last 16 round of the Champions League,[55][53] which came on back of an intense period of rivalry between the clubs leading a resentful Messi to state, \"We would rather play Arsenal, Manchester United or anyone else than be on the pitch with Chelsea.\"[56] After he had scored 8 goals in 25 games, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 14 June 2021, Messi scored from a free kick in a 1\u20131 draw against Chile in Argentina's opening group match of the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil.[498] On 21 June, Messi played in his 147th match as he equalled Javier Mascherano's record for most appearances for Argentina in a 1\u20130 win over Paraguay in their third game of the tournament.[499] A week later, he broke the record when he featured in a 4\u20131 win against Bolivia in his team's final group match, assisting Papu G\u00f3mez's opening goal and later scoring two.[500] On 3 July, Messi assisted twice and scored from a free-kick in a 3\u20130 win over Ecuador in the quarter-finals of the competition.[501] On 6 July, in a 1\u20131 draw in the semi-finals against Colombia, Messi made his 150th appearance for his country and registered his fifth assist of the tournament, a cut-back for Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[672][673] In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pel\u00e9's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for \u00a3125,000.[674]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA week later, Messi sustained a groin injury in a 1\u20131 draw against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and was ruled out with injury for three weeks.[211] He marked his return with a goal, scoring three minutes after coming off the bench in a 4\u20130 home win over Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a, on 16 October.[212] Three days after this, he netted his thirty-seventh club hat-trick as Barcelona defeated Manchester City 4\u20130.[213] On 1 November, Messi scored his 54th Champions League group stage goal in Barcelona's 3\u20131 away loss to Manchester City, surpassing the previous record of 53 goals held by Ra\u00fal.[214]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMessi's place in Argentina's Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario squad was initially put in jeopardy when he sustained a back injury in a 1\u20130 friendly win over Honduras in a pre-Copa Am\u00e9rica warm-up match on 27 May 2016.[440] It was later reported that he had suffered a deep bruise in his lumbar region. He was later left on the bench in Argentina's 2\u20131 opening win over defending champions Chile on 6 June due to concerns regarding his fitness.[441] Although Messi was declared match-fit for his nation's second group match against Panama on 10 June, Martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced Augusto Fern\u00e1ndez in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to Sergio Ag\u00fcero's goal, as the match ended in a 5\u20130 victory, sealing Argentina's place in the quarter-finals of the competition;[442] he was elected man of the match for his performance.[443]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> \n> \"When you saw him you would think: this kid can't play ball.

Messi worked to regain fitness in time for the Champions League final, but on 17 May, the day of the final, he was eventually ruled out. He was so disappointed that he did not celebrate his team's victory over Arsenal in Paris, something he later came to regret.[53][59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n431. **^** \"Gerardo 'Tata' Martino Appointed Argentina Coach\".

After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7\u20130 on aggregate by the eventual champions.[151] These matches gave credence to the notion of *Messidependencia*, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.[151]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn Argentina's final group match against Nigeria at the Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg on 26 June, Messi scored the opening goal in an eventual 2\u20131 victory, becoming the third Argentine after Diego Maradona and Gabriel Batistuta to score in three different World Cups; he also became the first player to score in the World Cup in his teens, twenties, and his thirties.[473] A goal of the tournament contender, Messi received a long pass from midfield and controlled the ball on the run with two touches before striking it across goal into the net with his weaker right foot.[474][475] He was awarded Man of the Match.[476] Argentina progressed to the second round as group runners-up behind Croatia.[477] In the round of 16 match against eventual champions France on 30 June, Messi set up Gabriel Mercado's and Sergio Ag\u00fcero's goals in a 3\u20134 defeat, which saw Argentina eliminated from the World Cup.[478] With his two assists in his team's second round fixture, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLa Liga Foreign Player of the Year - Don Bal\u00f3n Award\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1976: Neeskens\n* 1977: Cruyff\n* 1978: Cruyff\n* 1979: Stielike\n* 1980: Stielike\n* 1981: Stielike\n* 1982: Stielike\n* 1983: Barbas\n* 1984: Barbas\n* 1985: Schuster\n* 1986: Valdano\n* 1987: S\u00e1nchez\n* 1988: Alem\u00e3o\n* 1989: Ruggeri\n* 1990: S\u00e1nchez\n* 1991: Schuster\n* 1992: Laudrup\n* 1993: \u0110uki\u0107\n* 1994: Stoichkov\n* 1995: Zamorano\n* 1996: Mijatovi\u0107\n* 1997: Ronaldo\n* 1998: Rivaldo\n* 1999: Figo\n* 2000: Figo\n* 2001: Figo\n* 2002: Zidane\n* 2003: Nihat\n* 2004: Ronaldinho\n* 2005: Riquelme\n* 2006: Ronaldinho\n* 2007: Messi\n* 2008: Ag\u00fcero\n* 2009: Messi\n* 2010: Messi\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLa Liga Forward of the Year - LFP Awards\n |\n| --- |\n| * 2009: Messi\n* 2010: Messi\n* 2011: Messi\n* 2012: Messi\n* 2013: Messi\n* 2014: Ronaldo\n* 2015: Messi\n* 2016: Messi\n* 2017: Messi\n* 2018: Messi\n* 2019: Messi\n* 2020: Benzema\n* 2021: Messi\n* 2022: Benzema\n* 2023: Lewandowski\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 2022 FIFA World Cup final on 18 December, Messi made his record 26th World Cup match appearance at Lusail Stadium. He scored Argentina's opening goal with a penalty, becoming in the process the first player since the last-16 round was introduced in 1986 to score a goal in every round of a single World Cup edition.[520][521] After Argentina's eventual two-goal lead was erased by France forward Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who scored twice inside two minutes, Messi would score again in extra-time to restore Argentina's lead, before Mbapp\u00e9 again drew France level. Tied 3\u20133 after extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Messi scored Argentina's first goal in the shoot-out, with Argentina eventually winning 4\u20132, ending the nation's 36-year wait for the trophy.[522] Messi received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament, becoming the first player to win it twice. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAhead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches.[404] After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who had won the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista's under-23 squad in Beijing.[405] During the first match, he scored the opening goal in their 2\u20131 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1\u20130 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group.

Messi then helped the team secure their place in the 2014 World Cup with a 5\u20132 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013 when he scored twice from penalty kicks, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina's second-highest goalscorer behind Batistuta. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[588][589] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world.[160] Since 2008, Messi has won eight Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five,[590] seven FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four.[591] Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players.[160][592] Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques \u2013 Ronaldo is 1.87\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 1+1\u20442\u00a0in) with a muscular build \u2013 and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility.[593][594][595] From 2009\u201310 to 2017\u201318, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in *El Cl\u00e1sico*, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events.[596] Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.[596]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Men's Player of the Year Award\n |\n| --- |\n| UEFA Best Player in Europe | * 2010\u201311: ![Argentina](image) Messi\n* 2011\u201312: ![Spain](image) Iniesta\n* 2012\u201313: ![France](image) Rib\u00e9ry\n* 2013\u201314: ![Portugal](image) Ronaldo\n* 2014\u201315: ![Argentina](image) Messi\n* 2015\u201316: ![Portugal](image) Ronaldo\n |\n| UEFA Men's Player of the Year | * 2016\u201317: ![Portugal](image) Ronaldo\n* 2017\u201318: ![Croatia](image) Modri\u0107\n* 2018\u201319: ![Netherlands](image) Van Dijk\n* 2019\u201320: ![Poland](image) Lewandowski\n* 2020\u201321: ![Italy](image) Jorginho\n* 2021\u201322: ![France](image) Benzema\n* 2022\u201323: ![Norway](image) Haaland\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nArgentina won 4\u20133 in the penalty shootout, with Messi scoring the first penalty.[515] In the semi-final against Croatia, Messi made a record-equalling 25th World Cup finals appearance, drawing level with Germany's Lothar Matth\u00e4us, and scored the opening goal with a penalty before he assisted Argentina's third goal scored by Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez in a 3\u20130 win;[516] with his 11th World Cup goal, Messi overtook Batistuta to become Argentina's all-time top-scorer at the World Cup.[517] Argentina advanced to the final against France, with Messi stating that it would be his final World Cup appearance.[518][519]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 4 February 2017, Messi scored his 27th free-kick for Barcelona in a 3\u20130 home win over Athletic Bilbao in the league, overtaking Koeman as the club's all-time top-scorer from free-kicks.[219] On 23 April, Messi scored twice in a 3\u20132 away win over Real Madrid. His game-winning goal in stoppage time was his 500th for Barcelona.[220] His memorable celebration saw him taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans \u2013 with his name and number facing the crowd.[221] On 27 May, Messi scored a goal and set up another for Paco Alc\u00e1cer in the 2017 Copa del Rey final, helping Barcelona to a 3\u20131 victory over Alav\u00e9s, and was named Man of the Match.[222] In total, Messi finished the 2016\u201317 season with 54 goals, while his 37 goals in La Liga saw him claim both the Pichichi and European Golden Boot Awards for the fourth time in his career.[223]\n\n\n\n#### 2017\u201318: domestic double and a record fifth Golden Boot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nIFFHS World's Man Team of the Decade 2011\u20132020\n |\n| --- |\n| Goalkeeper | * ![Germany](image) Manuel Neuer\n |\n| Defenders | * ![Germany](image) Philipp Lahm\n* ![Spain](image) Sergio Ramos\n* ![Netherlands](image) Virgil van Dijk\n* ![Brazil](image) Marcelo\n |\n| Midfielders | * ![Germany](image) Toni Kroos\n* ![Spain](image) Andr\u00e9s Iniesta\n* ![Croatia](image) Luka Modri\u0107\n |\n| Forwards | * ![Argentina](image) Lionel Messi\n* ![Poland](image) Robert Lewandowski\n* ![Portugal](image) Cristiano Ronaldo\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAldo Rovira Trophy\n |\n| --- |\n| **Men's winners**\n* 2009\u201310: Messi\n* 2010\u201311: Messi\n* 2011\u201312: Abidal\n* 2012\u201313: Messi\n* 2013\u201314: Mascherano\n* 2014\u201315: Messi\n* 2015\u201316: Su\u00e1rez\n* 2016\u201317: Messi\n* 2017\u201318: Messi\n* 2018\u201319: Piqu\u00e9\n* 2019\u201320: Ter Stegen\n* 2020\u201321: Pedri\n* 2021\u201322: Gavi\n* 2022\u201323: Ter Stegen\n |\n| **Women's winners**\n- 2020\u201321: Putellas\n\n- 2021\u201322: Putellas\n\n- 2022\u201323: Bonmat\u00ed\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThroughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the \"New Maradona\" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona.[20][408] Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, \"Messi is Maradona every day. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 7 June, Inter Miami posted a video on their social media hinting at the club's impending signing of Messi.[367] On the same day, Messi confirmed his intention to join Miami in a joint interview with *Mundo Deportivo* and *Sport*, in which he said that they \"haven't closed it 100 percent\"; MLS also stated that the deal had not been finalised.[368] He explained that even though La Liga had accepted everything and was fine for him to return to Barcelona, there were many things left to be done such as lowering salaries and selling players, and he did not want to go through it again or be responsible for it.[369] He confirmed that other European clubs approached him, but that Barcelona was the only European team he wanted to play for.[366]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nand the most likable of all contemporary players.[630][631] On Messi's economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a \"tourist attraction\".[632]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLa Liga issued a statement stating Messi's contract and buyout clause were still active.[293]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFaced with aggression from opposing players, including taking a boot to the midriff, Messi played below his standards, though he was the only Argentine to successfully convert his penalty.[437] At the close of the tournament, he was reportedly selected to receive the Most Valuable Player award but rejected the honour.[438] As Argentina continued a trophy drought that began in 1993, the World Cup and Copa Am\u00e9rica defeats again brought intense criticism for Messi from Argentine media and fans.[439]\n\n\n\n### 2016\u20132017: third Copa Am\u00e9rica final, first retirement, and return[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.[16][655][656] Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's.[657] Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.[658] His favourite meals include asado (traditional South American barbecue), milanesa and pasta, and he prefers his mate unsweetened.[659]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Indian vehicle art of Messi\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCopa del Rey top scorers\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1986: Azcona, Merayo & R.

Some saw it as \"a touch of genius\", while others criticised it as being disrespectful to the opponent. The Celta players never complained and their coach defended the penalty, stating, \"Barca's forwards are very respectful.\" The penalty routine has been compared to that of *Bar\u00e7a* icon Johan Cruyff in 1982, who was battling lung cancer, leading many fans to indicate that the penalty was a tribute to him. Cruyff himself was \"very happy\" with the play, insisting \"it was legal and entertaining\".[199][200]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the start of 2015, Barcelona were perceived to be headed for another disappointing end to the season, with renewed speculation in the media that Messi was leaving the club. A turning point came on 11 January during a 3\u20131 victory over Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, the first time Bar\u00e7a's attacking trident of Messi, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly successful run.[172][173] After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Su\u00e1rez, their striker.[173][174] From there, he regained his best form, while Su\u00e1rez and Neymar ended the team's attacking dependency on their star player.[175][176] With 58 goals from Messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.[177]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBallon d'Or\n |\n| --- |\n| * *France Football* magazine award\n |\n| Ballon d'Or (1956\u20132009) | * 1956: Matthews\n* 1957: Di St\u00e9fano\n* 1958: Kopa\n* 1959: Di St\u00e9fano\n* 1960: Su\u00e1rez\n* 1961: S\u00edvori\n* 1962: Masopust\n* 1963: Yashin\n* 1964: Law\n* 1965: Eus\u00e9bio\n* 1966: Charlton\n* 1967: Albert\n* 1968: Best\n* 1969: Rivera\n* 1970: M\u00fcller\n* 1971: Cruyff\n* 1972: Beckenbauer\n* 1973: Cruyff\n* 1974: Cruyff\n* 1975: Blokhin\n* 1976: Beckenbauer\n* 1977: Simonsen\n* 1978: Keegan\n* 1979: Keegan\n* 1980: Rummenigge\n* 1981: Rummenigge\n* 1982: Rossi\n* 1983: Platini\n* 1984: Platini\n* 1985: Platini\n* 1986: Belanov\n* 1987: Gullit\n* 1988: van Basten\n* 1989: van Basten\n* 1990: Matth\u00e4us\n* 1991: Papin\n* 1992: van Basten\n* 1993: Baggio\n* 1994: Stoichkov\n* 1995: Weah\n* 1996: Sammer\n* 1997: Ronaldo\n* 1998: Zidane\n* 1999: Rivaldo\n* 2000: Figo\n* 2001: Owen\n* 2002: Ronaldo\n* 2003: Nedv\u011bd\n* 2004: Shevchenko\n* 2005: Ronaldinho\n* 2006: Cannavaro\n* 2007: Kak\u00e1\n* 2008: C.

We do everything that's Catholic, but we don't really have anything traditional except go to the park and have barbecues on Sundays after church.\"[11] Gomez was fluent in Spanish until age seven.[9][*clarification needed*] Her parents divorced when she was five years old, and she remained with her mother.[3][12] Gomez has two younger half-sisters and a younger stepbrother: Gracie Elliot Teefey, through Mandy and her second husband, Brian Teefey,[13][14] and Victoria \"Tori\" and Marcus Gomez, through Ricardo and his second wife, Sara.[15] She earned her high-school diploma through homeschooling in May 2010.[16]\n\n\nGomez was born when her mother was 16 years old.[17] The family had financial troubles throughout Gomez's childhood, her mother struggling to provide for the pair. At one point, Gomez recalls that they had to search for quarters just to get gas for their car. Her mother later recalled that the two would frequently walk to their local dollar store to buy spaghetti for dinner.[18] Gomez has said, \"I was frustrated that my parents weren't together, and never saw the light at the end of the tunnel where my mom was working hard to provide a better life for me. I'm terrified of what I would have become if I'd stayed [in Texas].\"[19] She later added that her mother \"was really strong around me. Having me at 16 had to have been a big responsibility. She gave up everything for me, had three jobs, supported me, sacrificed her life for me.\" Gomez had a close relationship with her grandparents as a child and appeared in various pageants. Her grandparents often took care of her while her parents finished their schooling, and she has said they \"raised her\" until she found success in show business.[20]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2002\u20132006: Career beginnings[edit]\n\n\nGomez first gained an interest in pursuing a career in entertainment watching her mother prepare for stage productions.[21] In 2002, she began her acting career on the children's television series *Barney & Friends*,[22][23] portraying the character Gianna.[24] The show was her first acting gig.

Its productions are rooted in today's pop-EDM default mode [...]\".[146] Andrew Hampp of *Billboard* wrote: \"[...] is a collection of 11 shinily produced pop songs that find Gomez trying on a series of different personalities with her slight-yet-capable vocals [...]\".[147] *Stars Dance* became her first album to debut at number one on the U.S. *Billboard* 200, with first-week sales of 97,000 album-equivalent units.[96] At that time, Gomez, who turned 21, became the youngest solo artist to take first place since *Speak Now* from Taylor Swift in 2010.[96] The album also reached number one in Canada.[92] Gomez incorporated choreographed dance routines into the album's music videos and her promotional live performances, having been inspired by artists such as Janet Jackson and Britney Spears.[148][149] The music video of \"Come & Get It\" won the Best Pop Video at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.[150]\n\n\nIn August 2013, Gomez embarked on her first solo worldwide concert tour, Stars Dance Tour, to further promote *Stars Dance*, with shows in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia.[151] In December 2013, Gomez canceled the Australian and Asian legs of the tour, claiming that she would be taking a hiatus to spend time with her family.[152] In January 2014, it was reported that Gomez had spent two weeks at Dawn at The Meadows, which is a treatment center in Wickenburg, Arizona, that specializes in treating addiction and trauma in young people.[153] Her representative stated that she had spent time there \"voluntarily [...] but not for substance abuse\".[154][155] Gomez confirmed in 2015 that she had been diagnosed with lupus and that after canceling the tour she entered rehab to undergo chemotherapy.[156][157] Gomez played Nina Pennington, an innocent straight-A student, in *Behaving Badly* (2014).[158][159] The project, filmed prior to Gomez's stint in rehab, was released in August to a generally negative critical and commercial reception.[160][161] However, critics deemed Gomez's performance superior to the film.[162][163] Gomez also had a supporting role in the drama *Rudderless* (2014), the directorial debut of William H.

She starred in the E! reality television series *Keeping Up with the Kardashians* from 2007 to 2021 and then the Hulu reality television series *The Kardashians* from 2022. She is the founder and owner of cosmetic company Kylie Cosmetics. She is the fifth-most-followed person on Instagram.\n\n\nAt age 14 in 2012, Jenner collaborated with the clothing brand PacSun, along with her sister Kendall, and created a line of clothing, Kendall & Kylie. In 2015, she launched her own cosmetics line called Kylie Lip Kits, which was renamed to Kylie Cosmetics the following year.[8]\n\n\nJenner has been an influential figure in culture since the mid 2010s. In 2014 and 2015, *Time* magazine listed the Jenner sisters on their list of the most influential teens in the world, citing their considerable influence among youth on social media.[9][10] In 2017, Jenner was placed on the *Forbes* Celebrity 100 list, making her the youngest person to be featured on the list.[11] Jenner starred on her own spin-off series, *Life of Kylie*, which premiered in 2017.[12]\n\n\nJenner's wealth and its coverage on the magazine *Forbes* has been a source of controversy in the past. In 2019, the magazine estimated Jenner's net worth at US$1 billion and called her the world's youngest self-made billionaire at age 21;[13][14] the notion of Jenner being self-made has been controversial.[15][16] In May 2020, *Forbes* released a statement accusing Jenner of forging tax documents so she would appear as a billionaire.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nKylie Kristen Jenner was born on August 10, 1997, in Los Angeles, California. The youngest daughter of former Olympic decathlete champion Caitlyn Jenner (then known as Bruce Jenner)[b][19] and television personality and businesswoman Kris Jenner (n\u00e9e Houghton).[20] From both of her parents' side, she is of Dutch, English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry, with some Welsh ancestry from her father's side.[21] Jenner has an older sister, Kendall and eight older half-siblings. [22] From Caitlyn's side of the family, she has three older half-brothers\u2015Burt, Brandon, and Brody Jenner\u2015and one older half-sister Cassandra Marino.[23] From Kris' side of the family, Jenner has three older half-sisters\u2015Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9\u2015and one older half-brother Rob Kardashian.[24] Her parents divorced in 2015,[25] prior to her father's transition.[26]\n\n\nJenner attended Sierra Canyon School, where she was also a member of the cheerleading team. Jenner claims to have performed in plays while attending school, along with community plays.[27] In 2012, she became homeschooled and enrolled in an at-home education program, from which she graduated with a high school diploma in July 2015 from Laurel Springs School in Ojai, California.[28][29]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2007\u20132012: *Keeping Up with the Kardashians*[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Jenner, along with her parents and siblings, Kendall, Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob, began appearing in the reality television series *Keeping Up with the Kardashians*, which chronicles the personal and professional lives of their family members.[30] The series was successful for its network, E!, and has resulted in the creation of numerous spin-offs including *Kourtney and Kim Take Miami*, *Khlo\u00e9 & Lamar*, *Kourtney and Kim Take New York*, and *Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Take The Hamptons*, in which Jenner has made multiple guest appearances.[31] The sisters hosted *Glee: The 3D Concert Movie* at the Regency Village Theater in Westwood, Los Angeles in August 2011,[32] In 2011, they were featured in *Seventeen* magazine's Style Stars of the Year,[33][34] and selected them as \"Style Ambassadors\" for the magazine.[35] The two hosted the premiere of *The Vow* in Hollywood in February 2012.[36] The Jenners also interviewed the cast of *The Hunger Games* premiere at The Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles in March 2012.[37] Later in 2012, she starred alongside her sister Kendall and mother Kris Jenner in an episode of American reality television series America's Next Top Model.\n\n\n\n### 2013\u20132014: Early ventures[edit]\n\n\nThe Jenner sisters co-hosted the 2014 Much Music Video Awards, where Kylie made her acting debut in a promo for the show in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in June 2014.[38] In August 2014, the Jenner sisters appeared in singer PartyNextDoor's \"Recognize\" music video.[39] She also appeared in Jaden Smith's music video for his song \"Blue Ocean\".[40] Jenner and her sister Kendall co-authored the dystopian science fiction novel *Rebels: City of Indra: The Story of Lex and Livia*, which revolved around two twin girls, Lex and Livia, in a \"self-sustaining biosphere\" put together from the remains of Earth known as Indra.[41] The novel was criticized upon release as a ghostwritten work, which prompted its ghostwriter Maya Sloan to reveal that while the Jenner sisters wrote a two-page outline for what they wanted the novel to be like, Sloan was truly responsible for the writing of the book. However, the Jenners' creative director, Elizabeth Killmond-Roman, clarified that the two had numerous Skype and FaceTime calls with Sloan to discuss the content of the novel.[42] The novel was mostly panned by critics, and sold only 13,000 copies in its first four months on sale.[43] The book was also given a sequel, *Time of the Twins*, which was also co-authored by the Jenner sisters.\n\n\n\n### 2015\u20132018: Rise of Kylie Cosmetics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kendall (left) and Kylie Jenner, 2016\nThe Jenner sisters were booed while introducing brother-in-law Kanye West's performance at the Billboard Music Awards in May 2015.[44] In May 2015, an episode of *Keeping Up with the Kardashians* premiered in which Jenner admitted to getting a lip augmentation.[45] Her enhanced lips from lip fillers created speculation and gained her publicity. Prior to the episode's debut, Jenner stated that she merely used lip liner and over lined her lips.[46] As a result, the practice of suctioning one's lips into a small glass in order to induce greater blood flow to swell the lips was called the \"Kylie Jenner Challenge\" (though there was no indication that Jenner herself employed this method).[47] Jenner responded to this by stating, \"I'm not here to try & encourage people/young girls to look like me or to think this is the way they should look.\"[48] In August 2015, Jenner announced that she would be launching her first lipstick line as a part of her self-titled lip kit under the name Kylie Lip Kit.[49] In November 2015, the Jenner sisters appeared in singer Justine Skye's \"I'm Yours\" music video.[50]\n\n\nIn February 2016, Jenner's cosmetic company was renamed to Kylie Cosmetics and the number of kits produced rose from an initial 15,000 to 500,000.[51] Jenner released a three-minute-long promotional video for a series of lip glosses in March 2016, directed by Colin Tilley and starring fellow models Karin Jinsui, Mara Teigen, and Jasmine Sanders.[52][53][54][55][56] The song in the video was revealed to be \"Three Strikes\" by Terror Jr, a band created on the same day as the release of the video; however, the lead singer, who was later revealed to be singer Lisa Vatale,[57] was heavily speculated to be Jenner herself.[58][59][60][61] However, Jenner subsequently denied any involvement with the band.[62][63] In May 2016, she made her musical debut rapping on producer Burberry Perry's song \"Beautiful Day\", with Lil Yachty, Jordyn Woods, and Justine Skye.[64] The next month, Jenner starred in another PartyNextDoor's music video for his song \"Come and See Me\".[65] In April 2017, she made a surprise appearance at the Rio Americano High School prom in Sacramento alongside junior Albert Ochoa after hearing that his date had turned him down.[66][67][68]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Jenner was placed at number 59 on the *Forbes* Celebrity 100, which calculates the 100 highest-paid celebrities of the previous 12 months, after earning approximately US$41,000,000, making her the youngest person on the list at 19 years old.[11]\n\n\nJenner starred in a reality show revolving around her life, *Life of Kylie*,[69] which premiered in August 2017. On mother's day 2018, Kylie Cosmetics launched makeup line called Kris Cosmetics, in collaboration with her mother Kris Jenner.[70] Jenner and her half-sister Kim Kardashian launched their second collaboration KKW x Kylie Cosmetics collection on Black Friday 2018 after previously launched the first collection in 2017.[71] The same month, she launched Kylie Cosmetics mobile app.[72]\n\n\n\n### 2019\u20132020: Debut of Kylie Skin[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jenner for *Vogue*\nIn April 2019, Jenner and her half-sister Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty teamed up to launch a new fragrance. This collaboration became Jenner's first foray into fragrance and it launched on April 26.[73] Jenner founded her own skincare brand Kylie Skin which was launched on May 22.[74][75] The brand began producing dermis products, including face washes, scrubs, moisturizers and makeup removing wipes. On June 14, 2019, Kylie Cosmetics launched their collaboration with her half-sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian called Kylie Cosmetics x Koko Kollection. This marked their third collaboration after previously launched special collection of lip products called Koko Kollection in 2016 and the second part in 2017.[76] In September, Jenner announced that she was serving as the makeup artistic director for Balmain's Spring 2020 runway show at Paris Fashion Week. To celebrate the new line, Kylie Cosmetics and Balmain launched a capsule makeup collection and available on September 27, the day of the show, on the Kylie Cosmetics website. This was the first time Jenner collaborated on a makeup collection with someone outside of her family's inner circle.[77]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Jenner filed to trademark the phrase \"rise and shine\", a line that became a meme when footage of Jenner singing the phrase to her daughter, Stormi, went viral.[78] The hashtag #RiseandShine reached one billion views on TikTok, making it the platform's fastest-growing hashtag trend.[79] In addition to the standard \"rise and shine\", Jenner also filed to trademark \"riiise and shiiinnee\".[80] The latter trademark would cover clothing while the former would also apply to cosmetics.[81][82] The next month, Jenner sold a 51 percent stake in Kylie Cosmetics to Coty, which owns other beauty brands including Covergirl, OPI, Rimmel, GHD and Clairol for $600 million.[83]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Jenner announced she had trademarked Kylie Con, Kylie Kon, and Kylie Museum.[84] In the same month, her sister Kendall confirmed that a cosmetics line in collaboration with Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics was in the process. Kylie Cosmetics launched Kylie Cosmetics x Kendall Jenner on June 26, 2020.[85] Still in the same month, Jenner announced that Kylie Cosmetics will launch a Valentine's Day Collection named after Jenner's daughter, Stormi. The Stormi Collection was launched in February 1, the same day as her daughter's birthday.[86] Jenner made a cameo appearance in singers Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber's \"Stuck with U\" music video in May 2020. The following month, the Jenners sisters addressed reports that their fashion brand Kendall + Kylie has failed to pay factory workers in Bangladesh as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was reported that Global Brands Group (GBG) previously listed the Kendall + Kylie brand on its website. As a result, the Jenners stated that their company is owned by a separate entity known as 3072541 Canada Inc. even though they say that their brand \"has worked with CAA-GBG in the past, in a sales and business development capacity only\" and that they \"do not currently have any relationship at all with GBG\".[87] In August 2020, Kylie Cosmetics launched Summer Sailor collection which marked the launch of Jenner's first-ever false lashes.[88] In the same month, she made a cameo in Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's \"WAP\" music video, alongside singers Normani and Rosal\u00eda; a petition asking that Jenner's cameo be edited out of the video reached over 65,000 signatures.[89]\n\n\nJenner topped the *Forbes* list of highest paid celebrities for 2020.[90]\n\n\n\n### 2021\u2013present: Business and television expansions[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Jenner and her family announced that their reality show, *Keeping Up With the Kardashians*, would be ending after twenty seasons and almost 15 years on air.[91][92][93]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Jenner teased Kylie Swim, a new swimwear line that includes sizes for all women.[94] On September 17, it was officially launched on Kylie Jenner's website.[95] Following release, the company received a lot of backlash on social media, with people saying that the products were poor quality and impractical, saying that they should only be used for Instagram photos.[96][97][98] On September 21, she announced a new skincare and hair product line for babies, called Kylie Baby.[99]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Jenner became the first woman to gain 300 million followers on the social network service Instagram, surpassing the previous recordholder, singer Ariana Grande.[100]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Jenner and her family returned to the television screens with their brand new reality television show, titled *The Kardashians*, after they left the E! Network to join Hulu.[101][102][103] The show features Jenner, alongside her sisters Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Kendall, and mother Kris Jenner, it also features ex and current partners including Scott Disick, Travis Barker, Tristan Thompson, and Corey Gamble, with Kanye West making a guest appearance.[104] The first season premiered on 14 April 2022, and its ten episodes can be streamed exclusively on Disney+.[105][106] Later in 2022, the show was announced to be returning for a second season, which officially premiered on 22 September 2022.[107][108] In late 2022, it was announced that the show had been officially renewed for a third season, set to premier in the first half of 2023.[109][110][111] The third season officially aired on 25 May 2023.[112][113][114]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Relationships[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2014, Tyga was seen getting close with Jenner at her 17th birthday party. Days later, Tyga ended his relationship with Blac Chyna, his fianc\u00e9e and the mother of his son.[115][116] In 2015, when she turned 18, Jenner and Tyga made their relationship official.[117][118] Jenner subsequently made appearances in two of Tyga's music videos, \"Stimulated\" and \"Dope'd Up\".[119] In April 2017, Jenner and Tyga broke up.[120]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Jenner was first seen with Travis Scott at Coachella.[121] On February 1, 2018, Jenner gave birth to their daughter.[122][123] Jenner appeared in the music video for \"Stop Trying to Be God\", from Scott's third studio album *Astroworld*.[124] They broke up in September 2019,[125][126] but quarantined together during the COVID-19 pandemic for the sake of their daughter and ended up rekindling their relationship.[127][128] On September 7, 2021, after weeks of speculation, Jenner revealed that she and Scott were expecting their second child.[129] Jenner gave birth to their son on February 2, 2022.[130][131][132] In January 2023, it was reported that the couple has split up again.[133]\n\n\n\n### Friendship with Jordyn Woods[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Jenner and Jordyn Woods met through their mutual friend, Jaden Smith, son of Hollywood actor Will Smith and actress Jada Pinkett Smith.[134] They were close friends for many years, with Woods appearing in Jenner's 2017 reality TV show, *Life of Kylie,*[135] and Jenner's 2018 pregnancy video. In September 2018, Kylie Cosmetics launched the Kylie x Jordyn collection, a collaboration between the two friends.[136] Their friendship ended in 2019 as a result of Woods cheating with Tristan Thompson, who was the fianc\u00e9 of Jenner's half-sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.[137] Jenner discontinued her Woods-named lip kit, cutting the price to eliminate remaining inventory.[138]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Kendall + Kylie \"Rock vs. Rap\" collection[edit]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2017, the Jenner sisters announced that they would be releasing a line of vintage T-shirts for their Kendall + Kylie line of clothing called Rock vs. Rap,[139][140] featuring the likenesses of various rock and rap artists[141] including The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur, Metallica, Pink Floyd, The Doors, Ozzy Osbourne, and Led Zeppelin, with pictures of the Jenner sisters superimposed over them.[139] The announcement of this line of products was met with swift backlash from relatives and representatives of the figures depicted on the shirts themselves, including Sharon Osbourne,[142] Jim Jampol,[143] and Voletta Wallace, mother of Biggie Smalls.[144] They were also criticized on social media and were called \"insensitive.\"[145] Wallace, The Doors' manager and the estate of Jim Morrison issued a cease-and-desist letter to the Jenner sisters, writing that they did not authorize the sisters' use of the likenesses of these musical icons.[146][147] The Jenners apologized for the shirts, and pulled them from retail.[139]\n\n\n\n### *Forbes* cover[edit]\n\n\nJenner appeared on the cover of the August 2018 issue of *Forbes*. The magazine claimed she had a net worth of $900 million and that she was on the verge of becoming the youngest \"self-made\" billionaire.[148] This would beat Mark Zuckerberg, who became a billionaire at age 23.[149] However, the publication's use of the term \"self-made\" sparked widespread criticism and jokes online.[150] Critics argued that Jenner was already born into fame and fortune.[151] Some discussions took a more serious tone, with journalists writing pieces on wealth distribution, inequality and inheritance, as well as upward mobility in society.[152][153][154] However, celebrities such as Jenner's half-sister Kim Kardashian and socialite Paris Hilton have come out and defended Jenner, legitimizing assertions that she is indeed self-made, while Hilton who was born into the Hilton family also described herself as self-made.[155][156]\n\n\nIn May 2020, *Forbes* released a statement accusing Jenner of forging tax documents so she would appear as a billionaire.[17] The publication also accused her of fabricating revenue figures for Kylie Cosmetics.[17] The same day, Jenner responded in a series of tweets, writing: \"What am I even waking up to? I thought this was a reputable site... All I see are a number of inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol. I've never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there EVER. Period\". Jenner's attorney also demanded that *Forbes* retract the statements, calling the magazine's accusations \"unequivocally false\". *Forbes* reacted, stating that they spent months uncovering the facts and concluded that their \"extensively-reported investigation was triggered by newly-filed documents that revealed glaring discrepancies between information privately supplied to journalists and information publicly supplied to shareholders\".[157] However, Jenner became the youngest person on *Forbes*'s list of 100 Richest Self-Made Women in October 2020. She is the only person on the list in her 20s, and is worth $700 million.[158]\n\n\n\n### Cultural appropriation[edit]\n\n\nJenner has been accused of appropriating African-American culture and style.[159] In 2016, Jenner was criticized for posting a photograph of herself wearing cornrows on Instagram.[160] In June 2017, urban streetwear brand PluggedNYC accused Jenner of stealing their designs for her collection of camouflage swimwear.[161]\n\n\n\n### Underpaying factory workers[edit]\n\n\nRemake, a non-profit, labeled Global Brands Group as the manufacturer for the Kendall + Kylie clothing line.[162] The organization claimed that money was being withheld from workers in the factories despite having finishing their work. The organization also reported them firing workers in Los Angeles, affecting over fifty-thousand workers.[163] She received criticism for this on multiple platforms, with fans asking her to pay her workers.[164] In response to this, the clothing line said that Kendall + Kylie was not owned by Global Brands Group.[165]\n\n\n\n### Lawsuits and civil disputes[edit]\n\n\n#### Vlada Haggarty[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2017, make-up artist Vlada Haggarty claimed that Jenner had stolen the creative style and aesthetic of her own work, such as the dripping gloss lip and golden finger tips, for her own products, and that Jenner had a history of taking Haggerty's original dripping lip art and passing it off as her own. Jenner later credited Vlada on social media and her work on the creation of the logo and an undisclosed settlement was paid to avoid any future legal issues.[166][167][168]\n\n\n\n#### \"Kylie\" trademark[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Australian singer Kylie Minogue won a legal battle against Jenner for name trademark \"Kylie\". Jenner had filed a U.S. trademark application for use of the name \"Kylie\" for \"advertising services\" and \"endorsement services\" in 2015.[169]\n\n\n\n#### Neon lip logo[edit]\n\n\nSara Pope, a British painter whose work has been featured in art galleries in several cities across the globe, filed a lawsuit against Jenner and NBC Universal for the use of a neon lip logo. Pope stated that Jenner posted to her social media accounts an image that was remarkably similar to Pope's most famous piece, \"Temptation Neon\" and used it to promote Jenner's TV series *Life of Kylie*. TMZ reported that the production art created for the series, including the lip design, was created by a third party designer.[170]\n\n\n\n#### Seed Beauty[edit]\n\n\nSeed Beauty filed a lawsuit against Coty and Kylie Cosmetics, alleging that Coty has purchased $600 million in Kylie Cosmetics stock from Jenner as a subterfuge to learn trade secrets.[171]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jenner being interviewed for Nip + Fab in 2015\nJenner has two nail lacquers from the Nicole by OPI nail polish brand called Wear Something Spar-kylie and Rainbow in the S-kylie.[172] Jenner and her sister Kendall earned $100,000 each for their OPI endorsements in 2013.[173] On November 15, 2013, the Jenner sisters announced that they would launch The Kendall & Kylie Collection with PacSun[174] which launched in February 2013.

In fall the same year, Jenner was announced to be the new face of PUMA along with Rae Sremmurd.[186] In 2017, Jenner became the face of Beats Headphones special edition collection in collaboration between Apple and Balmain.[187] Jenner collaborated with Melbourne-based sunglasses brand Quay Australia[188][189] to release a line of sunglasses, *Quay x Kylie*. This collaboration was launched in June 2017.[190][191][192] She endorsed Calvin Klein along with her sisters in 2018. In the same year she signed a deal with Adidas to become their ambassador. Jenner also had endorsed hair vitamin SugarBearHair, Waist Gang Society waist trainer, monthly beauty subscription service Boxycharm, detox tea Fit Tea and Fashion Nova.[193] In 2018, Jenner reportedly made $1 million per sponsored Instagram post, making her the highest paid individuals on Instagram in 2018. The next year Jenner reportedly made $1.2 million per sponsored Instagram post, remaining her as the highest paid individuals on Instagram for the second year in a row.[194]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jenner in 2017\nJenner set up an eBay account where she auctions old clothing to raise money for the Children's Hospital Los Angeles.[195] She joined her sisters Khlo\u00e9 and Kendall, along with Lil Twist, and The Game at PINZ bowling alley in Studio City, California for a charity bowling game on January 19, 2014. The event was held to raise money for The Robin Hood Foundation, a nonprofit for which The Game pledged to raise $1 million in donations.[196] The Jenner sisters participated in singer Chris Brown's two Kick'n It For Charity Celebrity Kickball games in Glendale, California on July 19, 2014[197] and on August 16, 2014.[198] At the first game, she competed on actor/singer Quincy Brown's team.\n\n\nIn December 2015, Jenner made a donation of Christmas gifts to the Los Angeles LGBT Teen Center.[199] In January 2017, Jenner donated $10,000 to her then-friend Jordyn Woods to help cover memorial costs for Woods's father after he died from cancer.[200] On her birthday in the same year, Jenner announced on her Instagram she donated $500,000 from sales of her Birthday Collection to Teen Cancer America, an organization to help hospital and outpatient facilities develop special units for teens with cancer.[201] Jenner is an ambassador for Smile Train, a charity that funds surgery for children with cleft lips and palates.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time,[6][7] he was integral to the development and success of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) during the Attitude Era, an industry boom period in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Johnson wrestled for the WWF for eight years before pursuing an acting career. His films have grossed over $3.5 billion in North America and over $10.5 billion worldwide,[8] making him one of the world's highest-grossing and highest-paid actors.[9][10][11]\n\n\nAfter accepting an athletic scholarship to play football at the University of Miami, he was a member of the 1991 national championship team, but was largely a backup player.[12] Despite aspirations to professional football, he went undrafted in the 1995 NFL draft, and briefly signed with the Calgary Stampeders before being cut in his first season.[13] In 1996, Johnson's father Rocky assisted in helping him secure a contract with the WWF.[2] Johnson quickly rose to global prominence, aided by a gimmick he employed as a charismatic trash talker. Johnson left the WWE in 2004 and returned in 2011 as a part-time performer until 2013, making sporadic appearances until retiring in 2019.[14] A 10-time world champion, including the promotion's first of African-American descent,[15] he is also a two-time Intercontinental Champion, a five-time Tag Team Champion, the 2000 Royal Rumble winner, and WWE's sixth Triple Crown champion. Johnson headlined the most-bought professional wrestling pay-per-view (WrestleMania XXVIII) and was featured among the most watched episodes of WWE's flagship television series (*Raw* and *SmackDown*).[16][17]\n\n\nJohnson's first film role was in *The Mummy Returns* (2001). The next year, he played his first leading role in the action fantasy film *The Scorpion King*. He has since starred in family films *The Game Plan* (2007), *Race to Witch Mountain* (2009), *Tooth Fairy* (2010), *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle* (2017), *Jumanji: The Next Level* (2019), and *Jungle Cruise* (2021), and the action films *Journey 2: The Mysterious Island* (2012), *G.I. Joe: Retaliation* (2013), *Hercules* (2014), *Skyscraper* (2018), *San Andreas* (2015) and *Rampage* (2018). He also starred in the action comedy films *Get Smart* (2008), *Central Intelligence* (2016), *Baywatch* (2017), and *Red Notice* (2021). His role as Luke Hobbs in the *Fast & Furious* films, beginning with *Fast Five* (2011), helped the franchise become one of the highest-grossing in film.[18] He joined the DC Extended Universe playing the title role in *Black Adam* (2022).[19] He is also known for voicing Maui in the Disney animated film *Moana* (2016) and is set to reprise the role in the upcoming live action remake.[20]\n\n\nJohnson produced and starred in the HBO comedy-drama series *Ballers* (2015\u20132019)[21] and the autobiographical sitcom *Young Rock* (2021). His autobiography, *The Rock Says*, was released in 2000 and was a *New York Times* bestseller.[22][23] In 2012, he co-founded the entertainment production company Seven Bucks Productions.[24] Johnson is a co-owner of the XFL, a professional American football league, which he acquired from WWE owner Vince McMahon for $15 million in 2020.[25][26][27] In 2016 and 2019, *Time* named Johnson one of the world's most influential people.[28][29]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJohnson was born in Hayward, California,[30] on May 2, 1972,[31] the son of Ata Johnson (n\u00e9e Maivia)[32] and former professional wrestler Rocky Johnson (born Wayde Douglas Bowles).[33][34] Growing up, he briefly lived in Grey Lynn in Auckland, New Zealand, with his mother's family,[35] where he played rugby[36] and attended Richmond Road Primary School before returning to the U.S.[35]\n\n\nJohnson's father was a Black Nova Scotian with a small amount of Irish ancestry.[37][38] His mother is Samoan. His father and Tony Atlas were the first black tag team champions in WWE history, in 1983.[39][40] His mother is the adopted daughter of Peter Maivia, who was also a professional wrestler.[41] Johnson's maternal grandmother Lia was one of the first female pro wrestling promoters, taking over Polynesian Pacific Pro Wrestling after her husband's death in 1982 and managing it until 1988.[42][43] Through his maternal grandfather Maivia, Johnson is a non-blood relative of the Anoa'i wrestling family.[44][45][46][47][48] In 2008, he inducted his father and grandfather into the WWE Hall of Fame.[49]\n\n\nJohnson attended Montclaire Elementary School in Charlotte, North Carolina, before moving to Hamden, Connecticut, where he attended Shepherd Glen Elementary School and then Hamden Middle School.[50][51] He attended President William McKinley High School in Honolulu and then Glencliff High School and McGavock High School, both in Nashville, and then Freedom High School in Bethlehem Township in the Lehigh Valley, from which he graduated in 1990.[52]\n\n\nAt Freedom High School, Johnson initially struggled and was drawn into a culture of conflict and petty crime. By age 17, he had been arrested several times for fighting, theft, and check fraud, and was suspended two weeks for fighting.[53] The local newspaper later called him \"a troubled teenager with a history of run-ins with police.\" But Freedom High School football coach Jody Cwik saw athletic potential in Johnson, and recruited him to join the football team, where he played defensive tackle. The experience proved the beginning of a personal transformation for Johnson. \"My thought process started to change. That's when I started thinking about goals and what I wanted to accomplish\", he has since said about his high school football experience.[12] In addition to playing football, Johnson also was a member of Freedom High School's track and field and wrestling teams. [33]\n\n\nBy his senior year, Johnson had played only two years of football, but was offered a full athletic scholarship offer from the University of Miami.[12]\n\n\n\n## Football career[edit]\n\n\n### College career[edit]\n\n\n\n\nDwayne Johnson| No.\u00a094 |\n| --- |\n| Position | Defensive tackle |\n| Major | Criminology and physiology |\n| Personal information |\n| Born: | May 2, 1972\u00a0(1972-05-02) (age\u00a052)Hayward, California, U.S. |\n| Height | 6\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in (1.96\u00a0m) |\n| Weight | 253\u00a0lb (115\u00a0kg) |\n| Career history |\n| College | * Miami (FL) (1990\u20131994)\n |\n| Bowl games | * Cotton Bowl Classic (1991)\n* Orange Bowl (1992)\n |\n| High school | Freedom High School(Bethlehem, Pennsylvania) |\n| Career highlights and awards |\n| * AP Poll national champion (1991)\n |\n\n\nAs he did in high school, Johnson continued to play defensive tackle at the University of Miami. He was a member of the Miami Hurricanes football team during his freshman year in 1991, and won that year's national championship.[54][33] Despite playing four years there, Johnson found himself behind elite players on the depth chart, including future NFL star and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Warren Sapp, and appeared mostly in backup roles.[55][56] In his time at Miami, Johnson played in 39 games with one start. He recorded 4.25 sacks and 77 tackles.[57]\n\n\nIn 1995, Johnson graduated with a Bachelor of General Studies and a dual major in criminology and physiology.[58] He was also one of the university's most prolific student speakers in the Miami-area community, frequently delivering positive messages about his own struggles and encouraging students to remain in school and avoid the dangers of drug use.[59]\n\n\n\n### Canadian Football League[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating, Johnson was signed by the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. Calgary moved him from defensive tackle to linebacker. He was assigned to Calgary's practice roster, but was cut two months into Calgary's 1995 season.[33][60][61]\n\n\n\n## Professional wrestling career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career (1996)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on |\n| Professional wrestling |\n| ![](image) |\n| History\n* History of professional wrestling\n\t+ By year\n* Early wrestling championships\n* Gold Dust Trio\n* 1980s boom\n* Black Saturday\n* 1994 NWA World Title Tournament\n* Monday Night Wars\n* Attitude Era\n* 2000 All Japan Pro Wrestling mass exodus\n* The Invasion\n* Wednesday Night Wars\n |\n| Notable promotions\n* All Elite Wrestling\n* All Japan Pro Wrestling\n* All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling\n* American Wrestling Association\n* Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\n* Extreme Championship Wrestling\n* Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling\n* Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling\n* Jim Crockett Promotions\n* Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide\n* National Wrestling Alliance\n* New Japan Pro-Wrestling\n* Pro Wrestling Noah\n* Ring of Honor\n* Tokyo Joshi Pro-Wrestling\n* Total Nonstop Action Wrestling\n* UWF International\n* Women of Wrestling\n* World Championship Wrestling\n* World Wonder Ring Stardom\n* WWE\n* Others\n |\n| Notable people\n**Early 20th Century**\n* George Hackenschmidt\n* The Great Gama\n* Frank Gotch\n* Billy Sandow\n* Toots Mondt\n* Ed Lewis\n* Jack Pfefer\n* Jim Londos\n* Salvador Lutteroth\n* Lou Thesz\n\n\n**Mid 20th Century**\n\n* Gorgeous George\n* El Santo\n* Sam Muchnick\n* Mildred Burke\n* The Fabulous Moolah\n* Blue Demon\n* Verne Gagne\n* Karl Gotch\n* Rikid\u014dzan\n* Stu Hart\n* Bruno Sammartino\n\n\n**1970s and 1980s**\n\n* Terry Funk\n* Harley Race\n* Gordon Solie\n* Antonio Inoki\n* Giant Baba\n* Mil M\u00e1scaras\n* Andr\u00e9 the Giant\n* Carlos Col\u00f3n\n* Dusty Rhodes\n* Ric Flair\n* Jim Crockett Jr.\n* Big Daddy\n* Vince McMahon\n* Dynamite Kid\n* Satoru \"Tiger Mask\" Sayama\n* Hulk Hogan\n* Randy Savage\n* Hisashi Shinma\n* Akira Maeda\n\n\n**1990s**\n\n* Ted Turner\n* Sting\n* The Great Muta\n* The Undertaker\n* Jim Ross\n* Mitsuharu Misawa\n* Kenta Kobashi\n* Toshiaki Kawada\n* Atsushi Onita\n* Antonio Pe\u00f1a\n* Eric Bischoff\n* Paul Heyman\n* Jim Cornette\n* Bret Hart\n* Shawn Michaels\n* Kevin Nash\n* Scott Hall\n* Vince Russo\n* Stone Cold Steve Austin\n* The Rock\n* Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque\n\n\n**2000s**\n\n* Chris Jericho\n* Jeff Jarrett\n* Eddie Guerrero\n* Rey Mysterio\n* Brock Lesnar\n* John Cena\n* Hiroshi Tanahashi\n* M\u00edstico\n\n\n**2010s and 2020s**\n\n* CM Punk\n* Bryan Danielson\n* Roman Reigns\n* Kazuchika Okada\n* Kenny Omega\n* Tony Khan\n* Nick Khan\n* Cody Rhodes\n |\n| By region\n* Australia\n* Bolivia\n* Canada\n* China\n* France\n* India\n* Israel\n* Japan\n* Mexico\n* New Zealand\n* Puerto Rico\n* Russia\n* Saudi Arabia\n* United Kingdom\n* United States\n |\n| Styles\n* British wrestling\n\t+ All-in style\n\t+ Mountevans rules\n* Catch-as-catch-can\n* Cruiserweight\n\t+ X Division\n* Hardcore\n* Intergender\n* *Lucha libre*\n* Midget\n\t+ *Mini-Estrella*\n* *Puroresu*\n* Shoot style\n\t+ *U-Kei*\n* Women's\n |\n| Concepts\n* Attire\n\t+ Masks\n\t+ Wrestling singlet\n\t+ Wrestling shoe\n* Backyarding\n* Blading\n* Championship\n\t+ World Heavyweight\n* Dirt sheet\n* Glossary of terms\n\t+ Kayfabe\n\t+ Gimmick\n\t+ Face\n\t+ Heel\n\t+ Shoot\n\t+ Heat\n\t+ Job\n\t+ Push\n* House show\n* Match types\n* Music\n* Rib\n* Ring name\n* Sports entertainment\n* Tag team\n* Weight classes\n* Wrestling ring\n |\n| Culture\n* Cauliflower Alley Club\n* Cauliflower ear\n* Comic books\n* Films\n\t+ Luchador films\n* Magazines\n* Paintings\n\t+ Gustave Courbet\n\t+ Thomas Eakins\n\t+ William Etty\n\t+ George Luks\n* Ribera Steakhouse\n* Sculpture\n* Ten-bell salute\n* Video games\n* Wrestling personalities in politics\n* Zubaz\n |\n| Media outlets\n* *Botchamania*\n* *Box y Lucha*\n* *Dark Side of the Ring*\n* *Fighting Spirit Magazine*\n* *Live Audio Wrestling*\n* *OSW Review*\n* *Power Slam*\n* *Pro Wrestling Illustrated*\n* *S\u00faper Luchas*\n* *Wrestling Observer Newsletter*\n |\n| Controversies\n* Animals in professional wrestling\n* Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide\n* Death of Owen Hart\n* Mass Transit incident\n* Montreal Screwjob\n* Murder of Bruiser Brody\n* Murder of Rikid\u014dzan\n* Premature deaths\n* Speaking Out\n* *United States v.

Wrestling at first under his real name, Johnson defeated The Brooklyn Brawler at a house show on March 10[62] and lost matches to Chris Candido and Owen Hart.[35] After wrestling at Jerry Lawler's United States Wrestling Association under the name Flex Kavana and winning the USWA tag team championship twice with his partner Bart Sawyer in the summer of 1996, Johnson was signed to a WWF contract. He received additional training from Tom Prichard, alongside Achim Albrecht and Mark Henry.[5][35]\n\n\n\n### World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment[edit]\n\n\n#### Debut; Intercontinental Champion (1996\u20131997)[edit]\n\n\nJohnson made his WWF debut as Rocky Maivia, a combination of his father and grandfather's ring names, although announcers acknowledged his real name.[63] He was initially reluctant to take this ring name but was persuaded by Vince McMahon and Jim Ross.[43][64] He was given the nickname \"The Blue Chipper\", and to play up his lineage, he was hyped as the WWF's first third-generation wrestler.[3] A clean-cut face character, Maivia was pushed heavily from the start despite his wrestling inexperience. He debuted on *Monday Night Raw* as a member of Marc Mero's entourage on November 4, 1996.[65] His first match came at Survivor Series, on November 17, 1996, in an eight-man elimination tag match; he was the sole survivor and eliminated the final two members of the opposing team, Crush and Goldust.[66] On February 13, 1997, he won the Intercontinental Championship from Hunter Hearst Helmsley on *Monday Night Raw*.[67][68][69] Maivia then successfully defended the title against Helmsley at In Your House 13: Final Four.\n\n\nJohnson's first WrestleMania match came at WrestleMania 13 on March 23, 1997, where he was victorious in his Intercontinental Championship defense against The Sultan. WWF fans started to reject his character and push from the company.[70] He defeated Bret Hart by disqualification in a title defense on the March 31 episode of *Raw is War*.[71] Behind the scenes, Hart mentored Johnson for his first year in WWF[72] and refused to be booked to take the title from him.[73] On April 20, at In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker, he lost to Savio Vega by countout but retained the title. Audiences became increasingly hostile toward Maivia, with chants of \"die, Rocky, die\" and \"Rocky sucks\" being heard during his matches.[2][43]\n\n\nAfter losing the Intercontinental Championship to Owen Hart on the April 28, 1997, episode of *Raw Is War*,[74] Maivia suffered a legitimate knee injury in a match against Mankind in June 1997 and spent several months recovering.[2]\n\n\n\n#### Nation of Domination (1997\u20131998)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Nation of Domination\n\nUpon returning in August 1997, Maivia turned heel for the first time in his career by lashing out at fans who had been booing him and joining Faarooq, D'Lo Brown and Kama in the stable called the Nation of Domination.[75] He then refused to acknowledge the Rocky Maivia name, instead referring to himself in the third person as the Rock, though he would still be billed as \"The Rock\" Rocky Maivia until 1998. The Rock would then regularly insult the audience, WWF performers, and interviewers in his promos.[75]\n\n\nAt D-Generation X: In Your House on December 7, 1997, Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated the Rock in under six minutes to retain the Intercontinental Championship.[76] The next night on *Raw Is War*, Austin was ordered by Mr. McMahon to defend the title in a rematch, but forfeited it to the Rock instead, handing him the title belt before hitting him with the *Stone Cold Stunner*.[77][78] The Rock feuded with Austin and Ken Shamrock through the end of 1997 and beginning of 1998.[79][80] On January 19, 1998, at the Royal Rumble, the Rock defeated Shamrock by disqualification to retain the Intercontinental title. Later that night, he entered the Royal Rumble match and lasted until the final two before he was eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin. On March 29, at WrestleMania XIV, he defeated Shamrock by disqualification once again to retain the title. The next night, on *Raw is War*, the Rock debuted a new Intercontinental Championship design and would later overthrow Faarooq as leader of the Nation of Domination to spark a feud between the two. He then successfully defended the Intercontinental title against Faarooq at Over the Edge: In Your House on May 31. The stable would then refer to themselves as simply \"The Nation\".[81]\n\n\nThe Rock and the Nation then feuded with Triple H and D-Generation X, with the two stable leaders first meeting in the quarter-final of the 1998 King of the Ring tournament, which the Rock won. At King of the Ring, the Rock defeated Dan Severn in the semi-final match and lost to rival Ken Shamrock in the final. The Rock then resumed his feud with Triple H, as the two had a two out of three falls match at Fully Loaded: In Your House for the Intercontinental title, which the Rock retained in controversial fashion.[82] This led to a ladder match at SummerSlam on August 30, 1998, where the Rock lost the title.[83]\n\n\nIn the latter half of 1998, The Rock saw a big uptick in fan support. He also started consolidating his famous persona during this time, which would last until 2000.[84] His popularity caused him to be booked in a feud with fellow Nation members Mark Henry and D'Lo Brown, turning babyface in the process. Henry defeated him at Judgment Day: In Your House on October 18, 1998, after interference from Brown, effectively breaking up the stable.[85][86]\n\n\n\n#### WWF Champion and rise to superstardom (1998\u20132000)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Corporation and Rock 'n' Sock Connection\n\n![](image)As part of The Corporation, the Rock feuded with Stone Cold Steve Austin and stole Austin's personalized WWF Championship and his \"Smoking Skull\" belt.\nThe Rock was then entered into the \"Deadly Game\" tournament for the vacant WWF Championship. The finals occurred at Survivor Series on November 15, 1998, where the Rock defeated Vince McMahon's associate, Mankind, to win his first WWF Championship.[87][88] A \"double turn\" then occurred as the Rock turned heel again after allying with Vince and Shane McMahon as the crown jewel of their stable, The Corporation, after the McMahons betrayed Mankind.[87][89] On December 13, 1998, at the pay-per-view named after him, Rock Bottom: In Your House, the Rock had a rematch with Mankind for the WWF Championship. Mankind appeared to win the match when the Rock passed out to the Mandible Claw submission move, but Vince McMahon ruled that since the Rock did not tap out, he retained his title.[89][90]\n\n\nIn the main event of the January 4, 1999, episode of *Raw Is War*, Mankind defeated the Rock for the championship after interference from Stone Cold Steve Austin.[91] Then at the Royal Rumble on January 24, 1999, the Rock regained the title in an \"I Quit\" match, a type of submission match that only ends if one of the combatants says \"I quit\" on a microphone. Intended to show a vicious streak in the Rock's character, the Rock hit Mankind in the head with a steel chair 11 times instead of the scripted five, five shots already being risky (most wrestling matches in the Attitude Era involving steel chairs had at most 2 or 3 shots to the head). After the fifth shot, Mankind was still ringside instead of two-thirds up the entrance ramp where he was supposed to be, and after the eleventh shot, which knocked Mankind out, a recording of Mankind saying \"I Quit\" from an earlier interview was played over the public address system.[92][93] On January 31, during an episode of *Sunday Night Heat*, the Rock and Mankind participated in an Empty Arena match, a match that took place in an arena with 22,000 empty seats where any part of the facility could be used to contest the match. After 20 minutes of chaotic brawling in the ring, the stands, a kitchen, the catering area, an office, the arena corridors and finally a basement loading area, Mankind pinned the Rock using a forklift truck to win the WWF title.[94] This match was referred to as \"Halftime Heat\" as it was televised during halftime of that year's Super Bowl.[95] The two faced off again, at St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House on February 14, 1999, in a Last Man Standing match which ended in a draw, meaning Mankind retained the title. Their feud ended on the February 15 *Raw Is War*, when the Rock won his third WWF Championship in a Ladder Match after a debuting Big Show interfered on his behalf.[96][97] The Rock then lost the WWF Championship to Stone Cold Steve Austin at WrestleMania XV on March 28, 1999.[98]\n\n\nThe Rock's popularity continued to grow and audiences still cheered for him even though he was a heel. He then lost the title rematch against Stone Cold Steve Austin at Backlash: In Your House on April 25, 1999.[99] The next night on *Raw is War* he was fired from the Corporation after he was betrayed by Shane McMahon, turning him face again and starting a feud with Triple H, The Undertaker and The Corporate Ministry. On April 29, 1999, WWF aired the pilot episode of *SmackDown!*, a term derived from one of the Rock's catchphrases. In the episode, the Rock continued his feud with The Corporate Ministry. This led to a match with Triple H, at Over the Edge on May 23, 1999, which the Rock won,[100] and a match for the WWF Championship against The Undertaker, at King of the Ring, which the Rock lost.[101] The Rock then lost a number one contender's match to Triple H, at Fully Loaded, after interference from \"Mr. Ass\" Billy Gunn.[102] The Rock then defeated Gunn in a Kiss My Ass match at SummerSlam on August 22, 1999. The Rock was also given the privilege of having his own signature match, like The Undertaker with the Buried Alive match, Kane with the Inferno Match and Mankind with the Boiler Room Brawl: the Brahma Bullrope match, a variant of a strap match was a normal singles match where the components are tied together with a rope used for cattle farming, and the rope and its attached cowbell could both be used as weapons. The Rock contested this match twice, both times in Texas (vs Triple H in Dallas, and vs Al Snow in Houston).[103]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock's popularity was fueled by his charisma and speaking abilities, which led to many catchphrases and merchandising opportunities.\nShortly after SummerSlam, the Rock began teaming with former opponent Mankind and the two became known as the Rock 'n' Sock Connection.[104] They became WWF Tag Team Champions for the first time after defeating The Undertaker and Big Show for the titles on the August 30, 1999, episode of *Raw is War*.[105][106] The two performed a number of critically acclaimed comedic skits together, including one called \"This Is Your Life\", which saw Mankind bring parody versions of people from the Rock's past on television, such as his high school girlfriend and his high school football coach, only to have the Rock insult them. The segment earned an 8.4 Nielsen rating, one of the highest ratings ever for a *Raw* segment.[107] The two lost the titles back to Undertaker and Big Show on the September 9 episode of *SmackDown!* and won them back from them on the September 20 episode of *Raw is War*.[108][109] Rock and Mankind then lost the titles to The New Age Outlaws on the very next episode of *SmackDown!*.[110] Rock and Mankind would win the tag titles for the third and final time after beating the New Age Outlaws on the October 14 episode of *SmackDown!* before losing the titles to The Holly Cousins on the October 18 episode of *Raw is War*.[111][112]\n\n\nAt the Royal Rumble, on January 23, 2000, the Rock entered the Royal Rumble match and was one of the final two remaining, along with Big Show. In an attempt at a \"false finish\", Big Show intended to throw the Rock over the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, before the Rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending Big Show to the floor before reentering the ring as the winner.[113] But the Rock's feet accidentally hit the floor during the reversal attempt, though those watching the event on television did not see that. This was played up in the storyline as Big Show provided additional video footage showing it and claimed to be the rightful winner. The Rock's number one contendership for the WWF Championship was then put on the line against Big Show at No Way Out on February 27, 2000, which Big Show won after Shane McMahon interfered.[114] The Rock then defeated Big Show on the March 13 episode of *Raw Is War*, to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 on April 2, in a Fatal Four-way elimination match, also including Big Show and Mick Foley.[115][116] Each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner: Triple H had his wife Stephanie, Foley had Linda, the Rock had Vince and Big Show had Shane.[116][117] The Rock lasted until the final two but was eliminated by Triple H after Vince betrayed him by hitting him with a chair.[117][118]\n\n\nDue to his image at the time, a Magic: The Gathering deck archetype was named after him.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Record-breaking world champion (2000\u20132002)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rock as the WWF Champion in 2000\nIn the following weeks, the Rock continued his feud with Triple H and eventually won his fourth WWF Championship, which he won on April 30, at Backlash, after Stone Cold Steve Austin intervened on his behalf.[120][121] The following night on *Raw*, he successfully defended his title against Shane McMahon in a Steel Cage match. On May 21, at Judgment Day, the Rock faced Triple H in an Iron Man match with Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee.[122] With the score tied at five falls each, and with seconds left on the time limit, the Rock was disqualified when The Undertaker attacked Triple H, thus giving Triple H the 6\u20135 win and the title.[122][123] The Rock won the WWF Championship for a fifth time at King of the Ring on June 25 by scoring the winning pin in a six-man tag team match, teaming with Kane and The Undertaker against Shane McMahon, Triple H and Vince McMahon, whom he pinned.[124][125] The Rock successfully defended the championship against Chris Benoit, on July 23, at Fully Loaded. The next month, he successfully defended his title against Kurt Angle and Triple H at SummerSlam. The Rock had another successful title defense against Benoit, Kane and The Undertaker, on September 24, at Unforgiven.[126]\n\n\nThe Rock then lost the WWF Championship to Kurt Angle, at No Mercy, on October 22, 2000.[127] The next month, the Rock feuded with Rikishi and defeated him at Survivor Series.[128] The Rock wrestled a six-man Hell in a Cell match for the WWF Championship, at Armageddon, which Angle won to retain the title.[129] On the December 18 episode of *Raw*, the Rock won the WWF Tag Team Championship with The Undertaker, defeating Edge and Christian, before losing it back to them the next night at a *SmackDown!* taping.[130] In 2001, the Rock continued to feud with Angle over the WWF Championship, culminating at No Way Out on February 25, 2001, where he pinned Angle to win the WWF Championship for a sixth time.[131][132] The Rock then feuded with the Royal Rumble winner, Stone Cold Steve Austin, whom he lost the title to at WrestleMania X-Seven after Austin allied with Vince McMahon, who interfered on his behalf.[133] On the next night's *Raw Is War*, during a steel cage title rematch, Triple H attacked the Rock, allying with McMahon and Austin and helping Austin retain the championship.[134] Austin and Triple H then formed a tag team called The Power Trip,[135] while the Rock was indefinitely suspended in storyline. Johnson used this time off to act in *The Scorpion King*.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock taunting an opponent at ringside at *WWF Raw*, October 2001\nThe Rock returned in late July 2001 when the WWF was feuding with rival promotions World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) during what is known as The Invasion storyline. In reality, WCW was purchased by Vince McMahon and the WWF, and ECW had gone out of business in early 2001. Many former WCW and ECW wrestlers were then brought onto WWF television and formed The Alliance to compete with WWF in storyline. The Alliance and Vince McMahon then both attempted to persuade the Rock to join their team. The Rock then aligned with McMahon and the WWF. The next month, the Rock defeated Booker T, at SummerSlam, to win the WCW Championship for the first time.[136][137] He later lost the title to Chris Jericho at No Mercy on October 21, 2001.[138][139] The next night on *Raw*, he teamed with Jericho to win the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Dudley Boyz. The two then lost the tag titles to Booker T and Test on the November 1, 2001, episode of *SmackDown!*.[140] The Rock defeated Jericho on the November 5 episode of *Raw* for his second WCW Championship.[141]\n\n\nAs part of the WWF's battle against The Alliance, the Rock wrestled in a \"winner takes all\" five-on-five elimination tag team match at Survivor Series where the losing team's company would be dissolved in storyline. He was a member of Team WWF along with Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and Big Show. The Alliance's team consisted of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Booker T, Rob Van Dam, and Shane McMahon. In the end, it came down to a one-on-one between the Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Rock seemed to have the upper hand, until his teammate Jericho entered the ring and attacked the Rock. Austin tried to capitalize on this by pinning the Rock, but Kurt Angle revealed his true allegiance by attacking Austin. The Rock then pinned Austin, giving Team WWF the victory and forcing The Alliance to disband. The Rock's WCW Championship was renamed the unbranded \"World Championship\" following the Alliance's loss.[142] At the next pay-per-view, Vengeance on December 9, 2001, the Rock lost the World Championship to Jericho, who would then unify the WWF and World titles later that night.[143] The Rock then unsuccessfully challenged Jericho for the now Undisputed WWF Championship at Royal Rumble on January 20, 2002.[144]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock doing his signature pose before wrestling Hulk Hogan (bottom right) at WrestleMania X8, March 2002\nAt the next pay-per-view, No Way Out on February 17, 2002, the Rock defeated The Undertaker in a singles match. The event also saw the WWF debut of the famed WCW faction New World Order, which at the time consisted of \"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall.[145] This later led to a match between the Rock and Hogan at WrestleMania X8 on March 17, 2002. The match was billed as \"icon versus icon\", with both men representing the top tier of two generations of wrestling; ultimately the Rock pinned Hogan at WrestleMania X8 to win the match.[146] Despite the Rock portraying a heroic character and Hogan a villain, a portion of the crowd attending the SkyDome was rooting heavily for Hogan.[147][148] In an interview in 2013, Hogan said he and the Rock changed the style of the match on the fly based on the crowd's response.[149] After the introduction of the first-ever brand extension, the WWF held a \"draft lottery\" on the March 25, 2002, episode of *Raw*. The Rock was the number one overall pick, going to the SmackDown! brand before taking a sabbatical from wrestling.[150]\n\n\nThe Rock made a surprise return on a June episode of *Raw* before going to his assigned brand of SmackDown!. There, he was named the number one contender for the WWE Undisputed Championship, which he won for a record-setting seventh time at Vengeance, on July 21, by defeating Kurt Angle and then-champion The Undertaker in a Triple Threat match.[151][152] The Rock successfully defended the title at the Global Warning event against Triple H and Brock Lesnar after pinning Triple H.[153] On August 25, at SummerSlam, after interference from Lesnar's manager Paul Heyman, the Rock lost the WWE Undisputed Championship to Lesnar along with the record for the youngest WWE Champion, which he had set in 1998.[154] In 2018, writing for *ESPN.com*, Sean Coyle noted in a retrospective review of the event, that following his victory over Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania X8, the Rock \"started to see a dip in fan support\" and \"that dip turned into a plunge\" by the time Rock had his match with Lesnar at SummerSlam because fans knew he was leaving WWE to pursue an acting career,[155] as evidenced by the negative crowd response during his match with Lesnar.[156] After SummerSlam ended, the Rock was visibly angry at the crowd reaction. When he tried to do a post-show speech for the crowd, the fans booed him.[157] The Rock then took time off to kickstart his acting career.[158]\n\n\n\n#### Final feuds and departure (2003\u20132004)[edit]\n\n\nThe Rock returned on the January 30, 2003, episode of *SmackDown!* to set up another match with Hulk Hogan at No Way Out.[159] Because of negative fan reaction during previous matches as a result of his budding acting career, The Rock turned heel for the first time since 1999. He also started a new persona that has been called *Hollywood Rock*, with a new look and a shaved head.[160][161] The Rock defeated Hogan at No Way Out before moving to the Raw brand.[162] There, he had various small feuds, including one with The Hurricane.[163] He also began performing \"Rock Concerts\", segments in which he played the guitar and mocked WWE performers and fans in song.[164]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin (left) in Austin's final match at WrestleMania XIX in March 2003.\nAfter failing to win a number one contendership for the World Heavyweight Championship, The Rock went into another program with Stone Cold Steve Austin. This led to a match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30, 2003, which called back to their previous two WrestleMania encounters, both of which Austin had won.[165] The Rock won after delivering three consecutive *Rock Bottoms*, ending their long-running rivalry in what turned out to be Austin's final match.[2][166] The next night, *Raw* was billed as \"The Rock Appreciation Night\", in honor of his victory over Austin. That night, he was attacked by a debuting Goldberg.[167] At Backlash on April 27, 2003, Goldberg defeated The Rock, who then briefly left WWE to film *Walking Tall*.[2][168]\n\n\nDuring the rest of the year, The Rock made occasional appearances, returning to a face character.[169] In 2004, The Rock aided Mick Foley in his feud against Evolution,[3][2][170] leading to a reunion of the Rock 'n' Sock Connection. They lost against Ric Flair, Randy Orton, and Batista in a handicap match at WrestleMania XX on March 14, 2004, when Orton pinned Foley after an *RKO*.[2][171] This was Johnson's final wrestling match until November 2011. The Rock appeared in WWE sporadically following WrestleMania XX. He made returns to provide support for Eugene against Jonathan Coachman, and made a cameo in his hometown of Miami and helped Mick Foley against La R\u00e9sistance.[2] Later in 2004, he hosted a pie-eating contest, as part of the WWE Diva Search, and ended the segment by giving Coachman a *People's Elbow*.[2] The Rock's contract with WWE then ended and he started his full-time acting career.[172]\n\n\n\n#### Non-wrestling appearances (2007\u20132009)[edit]\n\n\nOn March 12, 2007, the Rock appeared on a WWE show after nearly three years, via a pre-taped promo shown during *Raw*. He correctly predicted that Bobby Lashley would defeat Umaga at WrestleMania 23 in Donald Trump's and Vince McMahon's \"Battle of the Billionaires\" Hair vs. Hair match.[173] On March 29, 2008, Johnson inducted his father Rocky Johnson and grandfather Peter Maivia into the WWE Hall of Fame.[174] His next appearance was through a pre-taped promo on October 2, 2009, during the *Decade of SmackDown*.[175]\n\n\n\n### Independent circuit (2009)[edit]\n\n\nOn September 30, 2009, the Rock appeared at a World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) show to support the professional wrestling debut of Sarona Snuka, the daughter of his longtime friend and mentor Jimmy Snuka.[176]\n\n\n\n### Return to WWE[edit]\n\n\n#### Feud with John Cena (2011\u20132013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rock in the ring as WrestleMania XXVII host, April 2011\nOn February 14, 2011, the Rock was announced as the host of WrestleMania XXVII on April 3, 2011, appearing live on *Raw* for the first time in almost seven years. During a lengthy promo, he addressed the fans and started a feud with John Cena.[177][178] After numerous appearances via satellite, the Rock appeared live on the *Raw* before WrestleMania XXVII to confront Cena. After he and Cena exchanged insults, The Miz and Alex Riley appeared and attacked the Rock; he fended off Miz and Riley, only for Cena to blindside him with an *Attitude Adjustment*.[179]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock and John Cena (left) on *Raw*, agreeing to a match at WrestleMania XXVIII one year in advance\nOn April 3, at WrestleMania XXVII, the Rock opened the show by cutting a promo. After appearing in numerous backstage segments, the Rock came to ringside to restart the main event between Cena and The Miz as a No Disqualification match, after it had ended in a draw. As revenge for the *Attitude Adjustment* Cena had given him on *Raw*, Rock hit Cena with the *Rock Bottom*, allowing The Miz to pin him and retain the WWE Championship. After the match, Rock attacked Miz and hit him with the *People's Elbow*.[180] The next night on *Raw*, the Rock and Cena agreed to a match at WrestleMania XXVIII the next year. They then worked together to fend off an attack by The Corre, which at the time consisted of Wade Barrett, Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel, and Ezekiel Jackson.[181]\n\n\nThe Rock appeared live on *Raw* in his hometown of Miami to celebrate his 39th birthday.[182] On September 16, WWE announced the Rock would wrestle in a traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series tag team match, teaming with Cena at Survivor Series in November.[183] But on the October 24 episode of *Raw*, Cena instead suggested the Rock be his partner in a standard tag team match against The Miz and R-Truth, a team called Awesome Truth,[184] which Rock agreed to the next week.[185] On November 14, during the special *Raw Gets Rocked*, the Rock appeared live, delivering *Rock Bottom*s to Mick Foley, who had been hosting a \"This Is Your Life\"-style segment for Cena, and later both members of Awesome Truth.[186] The Rock and Cena defeated Awesome Truth on November 20 at Survivor Series, when the Rock pinned The Miz. After the match, the Rock gave Cena a *Rock Bottom*.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock celebrating his victory at WrestleMania XXVIII, April 2012\nLeading up to WrestleMania, the Rock and Cena had several verbal confrontations on *Raw*.[188][189] On the March 12, 2012, episode of *Raw*, the Rock hosted his first \"Rock Concert\" segment since 2004, mocking Cena in his songs.[190] On April 1, at WrestleMania XXVIII, the Rock defeated Cena in the main event after countering Cena's attempt at a *People's Elbow* into a *Rock Bottom* and pinning Cena.[191] This event broke the record for biggest professional wrestling pay-per-view buyrate. The following night on *Raw*, the Rock praised Cena, calling their match \"an honor\". He then vowed to once again become WWE Champion.[192]\n\n\nOn July 23, at *Raw 1000*, the Rock announced he would wrestle for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view. During the show, he encountered then-reigning WWE Champion CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, and John Cena, all of whom expressed a desire to face him. The Rock later saved Cena from an assault by Big Show, only to be laid out by CM Punk.[193] On the January 7, 2013, episode of *Raw*, the Rock returned to confront his Royal Rumble opponent CM Punk.[194] On January 11, he made his first *SmackDown* appearance in ten years, getting into an altercation with Team Rhodes Scholars, resulting in him delivering a *Rock Bottom* to Damien Sandow and a *People's Elbow* to Cody Rhodes.[195] The Rock closed out the 20th-anniversary episode of *Raw*, on January 14, with one of his \"Rock Concerts\", leading to a brawl with CM Punk.[196] The following week on *Raw*, the Rock was attacked by The Shield. Vince McMahon then asserted that if The Shield attacked the Rock in his title match with CM Punk, Punk would be stripped of the WWE Championship.[197]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rock revealing the brand new WWE Championship design on *WWE Raw*, February 2013\nOn January 27, at the Royal Rumble, CM Punk would seemingly defeat the Rock after the arena lights went out and someone attacked the Rock. Vince McMahon then came out and was about to strip Punk of the championship, however, at the Rock's request, he instead restarted the match. This culminated in the Rock defeating Punk to win his eighth WWE Championship.[198] Punk received a title rematch with the Rock, at Elimination Chamber on February 17, 2013, with the added stipulation that if the Rock was disqualified or counted out, he would still lose the WWE Championship. The Rock would pin Punk to defeat him and retain the championship.[199] The following night on *Raw*, the Rock unveiled a new WWE Championship design, with a different center plate and removable customizable side-plates which had his \"Brahma Bull\" logo.[200] The Rock then resumed his rivalry with John Cena, who won that year's Royal Rumble to set up a rematch of the previous WrestleMania match between the two at WrestleMania 29, only this time with the WWE Championship on the line.[201][202]\n\n\nOn April 7, at WrestleMania 29, Rock lost the WWE Championship to Cena, ending his reign at 70 days.[203] Despite being advertised for *Raw* after WrestleMania, where it was stated that the Rock was still entitled a rematch for the WWE Championship,[204] The Rock did not appear because of a real injury sustained during his match with Cena, in which his abdominal and adductor tendons tore from his pelvis.[205] Johnson underwent surgery on April 23 to reattach the torn tendons.[206]\n\n\n\n#### Sporadic appearances (2014\u20132023)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rock (right) confronts Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania XXX, April 2014.\n![](image)The Wyatt Family confronting The Rock at WrestleMania 32, April 2016\nIn April 2014, the Rock appeared in the opening segment of WrestleMania XXX along with Stone Cold Steve Austin and Hulk Hogan.[207] On the October 6 episode of *Raw*, the Rock made a surprise appearance to confront Rusev and Lana; this resulted in the Rock clearing Rusev from the ring.[208]\n\n\nThe Rock appeared at the 2015 Royal Rumble event on January 25, 2015, during the main event match, where he helped his relative Roman Reigns fend off Big Show and Kane after Reigns eliminated them from the match. Reigns then won the match and the Rock endorsed him in the ring.[209][210][211] The Rock appeared at WrestleMania 31 on March 29, 2015, alongside Ronda Rousey, getting into an in-ring altercation with Triple H and Stephanie McMahon. Rock and Rousey prevailed after he attacked Triple H and she overpowered McMahon.[212] On June 27, the Rock appeared at a live event in Boston, where he confronted Bo Dallas and gave him a *Rock Bottom*.[213]\n\n\nOn the January 25, 2016, episode of *Raw*, the Rock was in a segment that saw him converse with The Miz, Big Show, Lana and Rusev before he and his relatives, The Usos, got into an altercation with then-WWE Tag Team Champions, The New Day.[214] The Rock appeared at WrestleMania 32 on April 3, 2016, where he announced that WWE had broken the all-time WrestleMania attendance record before being interrupted by The Wyatt Family. The Rock got into a verbal back-and-forth with Bray Wyatt before having an impromptu match with Wyatt Family member Erick Rowan. The Rock won after giving Rowan a *Rock Bottom* and pinning him in six seconds, which set the record for the fastest win in WrestleMania history. The Rock was then aided by a returning John Cena to fend off Wyatt, Rowan and Braun Strowman.[215] On the February 20, 2017, episode of *Raw*, the Rock made an untelevised appearance after the broadcast had gone off the air, where he promoted and filmed a scene for his then-upcoming film *Fighting with My Family*.[216]\n\n\nOn August 3, 2019, the Rock officially announced his retirement from professional wrestling.[217] On September 30, 2019, after weeks of speculation, the Rock announced that he would appear on *SmackDown*'s 20th Anniversary on October 4, 2019, marking his first appearance on SmackDown since October 2014 and his first televised appearance since April 2016.[218] At the event, he cut a promo with Becky Lynch before they were interrupted by King Corbin.

Many have placed the Rock on their \"Mount Rushmore of Pro Wrestling\", including Hulk Hogan,[250] Ric Flair,[251] and John Cena.[252] In \"Cable Visions: Television Beyond Broadcasting\", the Rock was described as \"for a long time, the WWE's biggest star and probably held the greatest international appeal\".[253] R. D. Reynolds stated in his book \"The WrestleCrap Book of Lists\" that the Rock was \"the biggest star for WWE from 1999 until 2004\".[254]\n\n\nThe Rock's \"I quit\" match with Mankind at the 1999 Royal Rumble event is infamous for its brutality and one of the most popular \"I quit\" match of all times.[255][256][257][258]\n\n\nThe Rock main-evented the most bought pay-per-view worldwide in WWE history (WrestleMania XXVIII),[259] the most bought pay-per-view domestically in WWE history (WrestleMania X-Seven), the highest rated *Raw* in history,[260][261] the highest rated *SmackDown* in history,[262] and was part of the highest rated cable segment in WWE history with Mankind entitled \"This is Your Life\", in which Mankind would honor The Rock with various gifts and reunions.[263][264] His return in 2001 had a 7.1 rating, the highest-rated segment of the year.
