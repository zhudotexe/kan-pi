It took place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A]\n\n\nThis tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate,[B] the event was held during November and December instead of in the traditional months of May, June, or July.[C] It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. Qatar entered the event\u2014their first World Cup\u2014automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.\n\n\nArgentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4\u20132 on penalties following a 3\u20133 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since 1986, as well as being the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament since 2002. French player Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 became the first player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final since Geoff Hurst in the 1966 final and won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals (eight) during the tournament. Argentine captain Lionel Messi was voted the tournament's best player, winning the Golden Ball. The tournament has been considered exceptionally poetic as the capstone of his career, for some commentators fulfilling a previously unmet criterion to be regarded the greatest player of all time.[4] Teammates Emiliano Mart\u00ednez and Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez won the Golden Glove, awarded to the tournament's best goalkeeper; and the Young Player Award, awarded to the tournament's best young player, respectively. With 172 goals, the tournament set a record for the highest number of goals scored in the 32-team format, with every participating team scoring at least one goal.\n\n\nThe choice to host the World Cup in Qatar attracted significant criticism, with concerns raised over the country's treatment of migrant workers, women and members of the LGBT community, as well as Qatar's climate, lack of a strong football culture, scheduling changes, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption.[D]\n\n\n\n\n## Format[edit]\n\n\nThe FIFA World Cup is a professional football tournament held between national football teams, organised by FIFA.[13][14] The tournament, held every four years, was first played in 1930 in Uruguay,[15] and has been contested by 32 teams since the 1998 event.[15] The tournament was contested with eight round-robin groups followed by a knockout round for 16 teams.[16] The defending champions were France, who defeated Croatia 4\u20132 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final.[17][18] The event was scheduled to take place under a reduced length,[19] from 20 November to 18 December in Qatar.[20][21][22] Being held in Qatar, it was the first World Cup tournament to be held in the Arab world.[23] Spectators were not required to follow most COVID-19 pandemic restrictions such as social distancing, wearing masks, and negative tests.[24]\n\n\n\n### Schedule[edit]\n\n\nUnlike previous FIFA World Cups, which are typically played in June and July, because of Qatar's intense summer heat and often fairly high humidity,[2][21][25] the 2022 World Cup was played in November and December.[5][26] As a result, the World Cup was unusually staged in the middle of the seasons of many domestic association football leagues, which started in late July or August, including all of the major European leagues, which had been obliged to incorporate extended breaks into their domestic schedules to accommodate the World Cup. Major European competitions had scheduled their respective competitions group matches to be played before the World Cup, to avoid playing group matches the following year.[27]\n\n\nThe match schedule was confirmed by FIFA in July 2020.[28] The group stage was set to begin on 21 November, with four matches every day. Later, the schedule was tweaked by moving the Qatar vs Ecuador game to 20 November, after Qatar lobbied FIFA to allow their team to open the tournament.[29][30][31] The final was played on 18 December 2022, National Day, at Lusail Stadium.[28][32]\n\n\nThe matches for each group were allocated to the following stadiums:[32]\n\n\n\n* Groups A, B, E, F: Al Bayt Stadium, Khalifa International Stadium, Al Thumama Stadium, Ahmad bin Ali Stadium\n* Groups C, D, G, H: Lusail Stadium, Stadium 974, Education City Stadium, Al Janoub Stadium\n\n\nFIFA confirmed the group stage venue and kick-off times on 1 April 2022, following the draw.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Prize money[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2022, FIFA announced the prizes for all participating nations. Each qualified team received $1.5\u00a0million before the competition to cover preparation costs with each team receiving at least $9\u00a0million in prize money. This edition's total prize pool was $440\u00a0million, $40\u00a0million greater than the prize pool of the previous tournament.[35]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Place\n | Teams\n | Amount (in millions)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Per team\n | Total\n |\n| Champions\n | 1\n | $42\n | $42\n |\n| Runners-up\n | 1\n | $30\n | $30\n |\n| Third place\n | 1\n | $27\n | $27\n |\n| Fourth place\n | 1\n | $25\n | $25\n |\n| 5th\u20138th place (quarter-finals)\n | 4\n | $17\n | $68\n |\n| 9th\u201316th place (round of 16)\n | 8\n | $13\n | $104\n |\n| 17th\u201332nd place (group stage)\n | 16\n | $9\n | $144\n |\n| Total\n | 32\n | $440\n |\n\n\n### Rule changes[edit]\n\n\nThe tournament featured new substitution rules whereby teams could make up to five substitutions in normal time, and an additional substitution in extra time.[36][37][38] In addition, it was the first World Cup to feature concussion substitutions, whereby each team was permitted to use a maximum of one concussion substitute during a match. A concussion substitution did not count towards a team's quota of regular substitutions.[39] Iranian goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand suffered a concussion in his country's opening match against England and was replaced by Hossein Hosseini. This was the first use of a dedicated concussion substitute during a World Cup.[40]\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids and Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid\n\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups began in January 2009. National associations had until 2 February 2009 to register interest.[41] Initially, 11 bids were made for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico withdrew from proceedings,[42][43] and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian Football Association failed to submit a letter of Indonesian government guarantee to support the bid.[44]\n\n\nAfter UEFA were guaranteed to host the 2018 event, members of UEFA were no longer in contention to host in 2022.[45] There were five bids remaining for the 2022 FIFA World Cup: Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the United States.\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.[46] Two FIFA executive committee members were suspended before the vote in relation to allegations of corruption regarding their votes.[47] The decision to host the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which was graded as having \"high operational risk\",[48] generated criticism from media commentators.[49] It was criticised by many as being part of the FIFA corruption scandals,[50] which led to the 2015 FIFA corruption case.\n\n\nThe voting patterns were as follows:[51]\n\n\n\n\n\n2022 FIFA bidding (majority 12 votes)\n| Bidders\n | Votes\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Round 1\n | Round 2\n | Round 3\n | Round 4\n |\n| **Qatar** | 11\n | 10\n | 11\n | 14\n |\n| United States\n | 3\n | 5\n | 6\n | 8\n |\n| South Korea\n | 4\n | 5\n | 5\n | Eliminated\n |\n| Japan\n | 3\n | 2\n | Eliminated\n |\n| Australia\n | 1\n | Eliminated\n |\n\n\n### Cost of hosting the tournament[edit]\n\n\nAt an estimated cost of over $220\u00a0billion,[52] it is the most expensive World Cup ever held to date; this figure is disputed by Qatari officials, including organising CEO Nasser Al Khater, who said the true cost was $8\u00a0billion, and other figures related to overall infrastructure development since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in 2010.[53]\n\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of football stadiums in Qatar\n\n![](image)Six of the eight venues, such as the venue for the final, Lusail Stadium, were new stadiums built specifically for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nThe first five proposed venues for the World Cup were unveiled at the beginning of March 2010. Qatar intended that the stadiums should reflect its history and culture, and for the designs to meet the following terms of reference: legacy, comfort, accessibility, and sustainability.[54] The stadiums were equipped with cooling systems that aim to reduce temperatures within the stadium by up to 20\u00a0\u00b0C (36\u00a0\u00b0F).[55][56]\n\n\nTheir marketing included statements describing the stadiums as zero waste, and the upper tiers of the stadiums will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure.[55][56] Qatar aspired to be compliant and certified by the Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) for all the World Cup stadiums. All of the five stadium projects launched were designed by German architect Albert Speer & Partners.[57] The Al Bayt and Al Wakrah stadiums were the only indoor stadiums of the eight used.[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)Some venues, such as the 68,000-seat Al Bayt Stadium, had its upper tier of seating removed to reduce capacity after the tournament.\nIn an April 2013 report by Merrill Lynch, the organisers in Qatar requested that FIFA approve a smaller number of stadiums due to the growing costs.[59] Bloomberg said that Qatar wished to cut the number of venues to eight or nine from the twelve originally planned.[60] By April 2017, FIFA had yet to finalise the number of stadiums Qatar must have readied in five years' time. Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC) said it expected there would be eight in and near Doha, with the exception of Al Khor.[61][62]\n\n\nStadium 974, formerly known as the Ras Abu Aboud Stadium, was the seventh FIFA World Cup 2022 venue to be completed by the SC. Its name comes from the number of shipping containers used in its construction and Qatar's international dialling code. The venue will be dismantled completely after the tournament\u2014this stadium was the first temporary stadium ever used for a FIFA World Cup.[63] All of the other stadiums used except Khalifa International were reduced in capacity by half.[64]\n\n\n\n### Stadiums[edit]\n\n\n![Map](image)![About OpenStreetMaps](image)\n![Maps: terms of use](image)\n![](image)\n15km  \n10miles\n8\n![Al Janoub Stadium](image)\n7\n![Stadium 974](image)\n6\n![Al Thumama Stadium](image)\n5\n![Khalifa International Stadium](image)\n4\n![Education City Stadium](image)\n3\n![Ahmad bin Ali Stadium](image)\n\n2\n![Lusail Stadium](image)\n\n1\n![Al Bayt Stadium](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nVenues of the 2022 FIFA World Cup  \n1\n Al Bayt Stadium  \n2\n Lusail Stadium  \n3\n Ahmad bin Ali Stadium  \n4\n Education City Stadium  \n5\n Khalifa International Stadium  \n6\n Al Thumama Stadium  \n7\n Stadium 974  \n8\n Al Janoub Stadium\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Qatar |\n| --- |\n| City\n | Stadium\n | Capacity\n |\n| Al Khor | Al Bayt Stadium | 68,895[65][66][E] |\n| Lusail | Lusail Stadium | 88,966[67][68][F] |\n| Al Rayyan | Ahmad bin Ali Stadium | 45,032[69][70][G] |\n| Education City Stadium | 44,667[71][72][H] |\n| Khalifa International Stadium | 45,857[73][74][I] |\n| Doha | Al Thumama Stadium | 44,400[75][76][J] |\n| Stadium 974 | 44,089[77][78][K] |\n| Al Wakrah | Al Janoub Stadium | 44,325[79][80][L] |\n\n\n**Team base camps** \n\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.

It was the first Cup since 1930 in which players did not need to take flights to matches and could remain at the same training base throughout the entire tournament.[83][84]\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam base camps[83][84]\n| Team\n | Hotel\n | Training site\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Argentina | Qatar University Hostel 1\n | Qatar University Training Site 3\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Australia | New Aspire Academy Athlete Accommodation\n | Aspire Zone Training Facilities 5\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | Hilton Salwa Beach Resort and Villas\n | Salwa Training Site\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | The Westin Doha Hotel and Spa\n | Al Arabi SC Stadium |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Cameroon | Banyan Tree Doha at La Cigale Mushaireb\n | Al Sailiya SC Stadium |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Canada | Century Marina Hotel Lusail | Umm Salal SC Training Facilities\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Costa Rica | dusitD2 Salwa Doha\n | Al Ahli SC Stadium |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Croatia | Hilton Doha\n | Al Ersal Training Site 3\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Denmark | Retaj Salwa Resort & SPA\n | Al Sailiya SC 2\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Ecuador | Hyatt Regency Oryx Doha\n | Mesaimeer SC Training Facilities\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0England | Souq Al Wakra Hotel Qatar by Tivoli | Al Wakrah SC Stadium |\n| ![](image)\u00a0France | Al Messila \u2013 A Luxury Collection Resort & Spa, Doha\n | Al Sadd SC Stadium |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Germany | Zulal Wellness Resort\n | Al Shamal SC Stadium |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Ghana | DoubleTree by Hilton Doha \u2013 Al Sadd\n | Aspire Zone Training Facilities 1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Iran | Al Rayyan Hotel Doha Curio Collection by Hilton\n | Al Rayyan SC Training Facilities 1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Japan | Radisson Blu Hotel Doha\n | Al Sadd SC New Training Facilities 1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Mexico | Simaisma, A Murwab Resort\n | Al Khor SC Stadium |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Morocco | Wyndham Doha West Bay\n | Al Duhail SC Stadium |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | The St. Regis Doha\n | Qatar University Training Site 6\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Poland | Ezdan Palace Hotel\n | Al Kharaitiyat SC Training Facilities\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | Al Samriya Autograph Collection Hotel\n | Al Shahaniya SC Training Facilities\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Qatar | Al Aziziyah Boutique Hotel\n | Aspire Zone Training Facilities 3\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia | Sealine Beach, a Murwab Resort\n | Sealine Training Site\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Senegal | Duhail Handball Sports Hall | Al Duhail SC 2\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Serbia | Rixos Gulf Hotel Doha\n | Al Arabi SC Training Facilities\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | Le M\u00e9ridien City Center Doha\n | Al Egla Training Site 5\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Spain | Qatar University Hostel 2\n | Qatar University Training Site 1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland | Le Royal M\u00e9ridien, Doha\n | University of Doha for Science and Technology Training Facilities\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Tunisia | Wyndham Grand Doha West Bay Beach\n | Al Egla Training Sites 3\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0United States | Marsa Malaz Kempinski, The Pearl \u2013 Doha\n | Al Gharafa SC Stadium\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Uruguay | Pullman Doha West Bay\n | Al Ersal Training Site 1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Wales | Delta Hotels City Center Doha\n | Al Sadd SC New Training Facilities 2\n |\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nThe Qatari government employed about 50,000 security personnel including police departments and military forces from at least thirteen countries, including Poland, Germany, France, Kuwait, Jordan, Italy, Palestine, Spain, Pakistan, Turkey, USA, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom.[85] The Turkish government provided about 3,000 riot police personnel,[85] whilst Pakistan provided about 4,500 Army troops to Qatar for the event.[86]\n\n\n\n## Teams[edit]\n\n\n### Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\nFIFA's six continental confederations organised their own qualifying competitions. All 211 FIFA member associations were eligible to enter qualification. The Qatari national team, as hosts, qualified automatically for the tournament. However, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) obliged Qatar to participate in the Asian qualifying stage as the first two rounds also act as qualification for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.[87] Since Qatar reached the final stage as winners in their group, Lebanon, the fifth-best second place team, advanced instead.[88] France, the reigning World Cup champions, qualified for the event through European qualification.[89]\n\n\nSaint Lucia initially entered CONCACAF qualification but withdrew from it before their first match. North Korea withdrew from the AFC qualifying round due to safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both American Samoa and Samoa withdrew before the OFC qualification draw due to travel restrictions following the pandemic.[90] Tonga withdrew after the 2022 Hunga Tonga\u2013Hunga Ha'apai eruption and tsunami.[91] Due to COVID-19 outbreaks in their squads, Vanuatu and Cook Islands also withdrew because of the travel restrictions.[92][93]\n\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, 24 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2018.[94] Qatar were the only team making their debut in the FIFA World Cup, becoming the first hosts to make their tournament debut since Italy in 1934. The Netherlands, Ecuador, Ghana, Cameroon, and the United States returned to the tournament after missing the 2018 tournament. Canada returned after 36 years, their only prior appearance being in 1986.[95] Wales made their first appearance in 64 years\u2014the longest-ever gap for any team, their only previous participation having been in 1958.[96]\n\n\nItaly, four-time winners and reigning European champions, failed to qualify for a second successive World Cup for the first time in their history, losing in the qualification play-off semi-finals.[97] The Italians were the only former champions and the highest ranked team in the FIFA Men's World Rankings that failed to qualify. Italy were also the fourth team to have failed to qualify for the upcoming World Cup after having won the previous UEFA European Championship, following Czechoslovakia in 1978, Denmark in 1994, and Greece in 2006.[98] The previous World Cup hosts, Russia, were disqualified from competing due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[99]\n\n\nChile, the 2015 and 2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica winners, failed to qualify for the second consecutive time. Nigeria were defeated by Ghana on away goals in Confederation of African Football (CAF) final playoff round, having qualified for the previous three World Cups and six out of the last seven. Egypt, Panama, Colombia, Peru, Iceland, and Sweden, all of whom qualified for the 2018 World Cup, did not qualify for the 2022 tournament.[100] Ghana were the lowest ranked team to qualify, ranked 61st.[101]\n\n\nThe qualified teams, listed by region, with numbers in parentheses indicating final positions in the FIFA Men's World Ranking before the tournament were:[102]\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **AFC** (6)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Australia (38)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Iran (20)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Japan (24)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Qatar (50) (hosts)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia (51)\n* ![](image)\u00a0South Korea (28)\n\n**CAF** (5)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Cameroon (43)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Ghana (61)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Morocco (22)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Senegal (18)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Tunisia (30)\n | **CONCACAF** (4)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Canada (41)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Costa Rica (31)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Mexico (13)\n* ![](image)\u00a0United States (16)\n\n**CONMEBOL** (4)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Argentina (3)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Brazil (1)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Ecuador (44)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Uruguay (14)\n\n**OFC** (0)\n* *None qualified*\n | **UEFA** (13)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Belgium (2)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Croatia (12)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Denmark (10)\n* ![](image)\u00a0England (5)\n* ![](image)\u00a0France (4)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Germany (11)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands (8)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Poland (26)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Portugal (9)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Serbia (21)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Spain (7)\n* ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland (15)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Wales (19)\n | ![](image)Team qualified\n Team failed to qualify\n Team withdrew or suspended\n Not a FIFA member\n\n\n |\n\n### Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 FIFA World Cup squads\n\nBefore submitting their final squad for the tournament, teams named a provisional squad of up to 55 players. Teams were required to have their 55-player roster submitted to FIFA by 21 October.[103] Teams were required to name their final squads by 13 November.[104] In August 2022, FIFA increased the final squad size to 26 players from a total of 23 players at the 2018 edition.[105] All teams had a total of 26 players in their final squads except for France and Iran, who chose 25 players.[106][107]\n\n\n\n### Draw[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 FIFA World Cup seeding\n\nThe final draw was held at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center in Doha, Qatar,[108] on 1 April 2022,[109] 19:00 AST, prior to the completion of qualification. The two winners of the inter-confederation play-offs and the winner of the Path A of the UEFA play-offs were not known at the time of the draw.[110] The draw was attended by 2,000 guests and was led by Carli Lloyd, Jermaine Jenas and sports broadcaster Samantha Johnson, assisted by the likes of Cafu (Brazil), Lothar Matth\u00e4us (Germany), Adel Ahmed Malalla (Qatar), Ali Daei (Iran), Bora Milutinovi\u0107 (Serbia/Mexico), Jay-Jay Okocha (Nigeria), Rabah Madjer (Algeria), and Tim Cahill (Australia).[111][112]\n\n\nFor the draw, 32 teams were allocated into four pots based on the FIFA Men's World Rankings of 31 March 2022.[113] Pot 1 contained host Qatar (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams. Pot 2 contained the next best eight teams, with the next best eight teams into pot 3. Pot 4 contained the five lowest-ranked teams, along with the placeholders for the two inter-confederation play-off winners and the UEFA Path A play-off winner. Teams from the same confederation could not be drawn into the same group except for UEFA teams, for which there was at least one and no more than two per group.[114]\n\n\nThis principle also applied to the placeholder teams, with constraints applying based on the confederation of both potential winners of each play-off tie. The draw started with pot 1 and ended with pot 4, with each team selected then allocated into the first available group alphabetically. The position for the team within the group would then be drawn (for the purpose of the match schedule), with the pot 1 teams automatically drawn into position 1 of each group.[114] The pots for the draw are shown below.[115]\n\n\n\n\n\nDraw[116]\n| Pot 1\n | Pot 2\n | Pot 3\n | Pot 4\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Qatar (51) *(hosts)*![](image)\u00a0Brazil (1)![](image)\u00a0Belgium (2)![](image)\u00a0France (3)![](image)\u00a0Argentina (4)![](image)\u00a0England (5)![](image)\u00a0Spain (7)![](image)\u00a0Portugal (8)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Mexico (9)![](image)\u00a0Netherlands (10)![](image)\u00a0Denmark (11)![](image)\u00a0Germany (12)![](image)\u00a0Uruguay (13)![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland (14)![](image)\u00a0United States (15)![](image)\u00a0Croatia (16)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Senegal (20)![](image)\u00a0Iran (21)![](image)\u00a0Japan (23)![](image)\u00a0Morocco (24)![](image)\u00a0Serbia (25)![](image)\u00a0Poland (26)![](image)\u00a0South Korea (29)![](image)\u00a0Tunisia (35)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Cameroon (37)![](image)\u00a0Canada (38)![](image)\u00a0Ecuador (46)![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia (49)![](image)\u00a0Ghana (61)![](image)\u00a0Wales (18)\u200a[M]![](image)\u00a0Costa Rica (31)\u200a[N]![](image)\u00a0Australia (42)\u200a[O] |\n\n\n## Officiating[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 FIFA World Cup officials\n\nIn May 2022, FIFA announced the list of 36 referees, 69 assistant referees, and 24 video assistant referees for the tournament. Of the 36 referees, FIFA included two each from Argentina, Brazil, England, and France.[117][118]\n\n\nFor the first time women referees officiated games at a major men's tournament.[119] France's St\u00e9phanie Frappart, Salima Mukansanga from Rwanda, and Yoshimi Yamashita from Japan became the first female referees to be appointed to a men's World Cup.[120] Frappart previously oversaw the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup Final.[121] They were joined by three female assistant referees, Neuza Back, Kathryn Nesbitt, and Karen D\u00edaz Medina. Frappart then officially became the first-ever female referee to officiate a World Cup match when she worked the Costa Rica vs Germany match in Group E on 1 December.[122]\n\n\nGambian referee Bakary Gassama and Argentine assistant referee Juan Pablo Belatti were among the officials to serve at their third World Cup. Belatti was an assistant referee in the 2018 final.[123][124][125] Other returning officials included referees C\u00e9sar Arturo Ramos of Mexico and Janny Sikazwe of Zambia, and Iranian assistant referee Mohammadreza Mansouri.[126][127][128]\n\n\nOn 15 December 2022, FIFA announced that Polish referee Szymon Marciniak would adjudicate the final.[129]\n\n\n\n## Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on Sunday, 20 November 2022 at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor, prior to the opening match of the tournament between hosts Qatar and Ecuador.[130] It included appearances by Morgan Freeman and Ghanim Al-Muftah, along with performances by South Korean singer and BTS member Jungkook and Qatari singer Fahad Al Kubaisi.[131][132] It was the first time that the Qur'an had been recited as part of the opening ceremony.[133]\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\nAll times are local, AST (UTC+3).\n\nThe group stage was played from 20 November to 2 December.[134] Competing countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H). Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, where the top two teams advanced to the knockout stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  Tie-breaking criteria for group play\n |\n| --- |\n| The ranking of teams in the group stage was determined as follows:[135]1.

Ecuador had a disallowed goal in the opening minutes,[136] but eventually won 2\u20130 with two goals from Enner Valencia.[137] Qatar became the first host nation to lose their opening match at a World Cup.[138][139][140] Many Qatar natives were seen leaving the game before the end, with ESPN reporting that two-thirds of the attendance had left.[141][142] The other starting match in group A was won by the Netherlands 2\u20130 over Senegal. Cody Gakpo scored the opening goal in the 84th minute and Davy Klaassen added a second in stoppage time.[143] Senegal faced Qatar in the third match of the group; Boulaye Dia capitalised on a slip by Boualem Khoukhi to put Senegal 1\u20130 ahead. Famara Di\u00e9dhiou scored a second with a header, before Mohammed Muntari scored Qatar's first-ever goal at a World Cup to reduce the deficit back to one. Senegal eventually won the match 3\u20131 after an 84th-minute goal by Bamba Dieng. With this result, Qatar became the first team to be eliminated from the tournament, as well as becoming the first host nation to ever be knocked out of the tournament after two games.[144] Gakpo scored his second goal of the tournament as the Netherlands led Ecuador; however, Valencia scored an equaliser in the 49th minute.[145] The Netherlands won 2\u20130 against Qatar following goals by Gakpo and Frenkie de Jong to win the group, while Qatar attained the distinction of being the first home nation to lose all three group matches.[146] Senegal faced Ecuador to determine the second knockout round qualifier. At the end of the first half, Isma\u00efla Sarr scored a penalty kick to put Senegal ahead.

France, however, scored four goals, by Adrien Rabiot, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and two by Olivier Giroud to win 4\u20131.[165] The goals tied Giroud with Thierry Henry as France's all-time top goalscorer.[165] Mitchell Duke scored the only goal as Australia won against Tunisia. This was their first World Cup win since 2010.[166][167] Mbapp\u00e9 scored a brace as France defeated Denmark 2\u20131. This was enough for France to qualify for the knockout round\u2014the first time since Brazil in 2006 that the defending champions progressed through the opening round.[166][168] Mathew Leckie scored the only goal as Australia defeated Denmark 1\u20130, qualifying for the knockout round as runners-up with the win.[169] Wahbi Khazri scored for Tunisia against France in the 58th minute. Although Antoine Griezmann equalised in stoppage time it was overturned for offside.

After an early penalty kick was converted by Germany's \u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan, Japan scored two second-half goals by Ritsu D\u014dan and Takuma Asano in a 2\u20131 win.[171] In the second group match, Spain defeated Costa Rica 7\u20130. First-half goals by Dani Olmo, Marco Asensio, and Ferran Torres were followed by goals by Gavi, Carlos Soler, Alvaro Morata, and a second by Torres.[172][173] This was the largest defeat in a World Cup since Portugal's victory over North Korea in the 2010 event by the same scoreline.[174] Costa Rica defeated Japan 1\u20130, with Keysher Fuller scoring with Costa Rica's first shot on target of the tournament.[175] Germany and Spain drew 1\u20131, with \u00c1lvaro Morata scoring for Spain and Niclas F\u00fcllkrug scoring for Germany.[176][177][178] Morata scored the opening goal for Spain against Japan as they controlled the first half of the match.[179] Japan equalised on Ritsu Doan before a second goal by Ao Tanaka was heavily investigated by VAR for the ball potentially being out of play. The goal was awarded, and Japan won the group following a 2\u20131 win.[179] Serge Gnabry scored on ten minutes for Germany against Costa Rica and they led until half-time. Germany required a win, and for Japan to not win their match, or for both teams to win their matches by a combined goal difference of at least 9 goals, to qualify. In the second half, goals by Yeltsin Tejeda and Juan Vargas gave Costa Rica a 2\u20131 lead, which would have qualified them into the knockout stages ahead of Spain.

Belgium won the match by a single goal by Michy Batshuayi.[183][184] Belgium lost 2\u20130 to Morocco, despite Morocco having a long-range direct free kick goal by Hakim Ziyech overturned for an offside on another player in the lead up to the goal. Two second-half goals from Zakaria Aboukhlal and Romain Sa\u00efss helped the Morocco win their first World Cup match since 1998.[185][186] The match sparked riots in Belgium, with fires and fireworks being set off by residents.[187] Alphonso Davies scored Canada's first World Cup goal to give Canada the lead over Croatia. Goals by Marko Livaja, Lovro Majer, and two by Andrej Kramari\u0107 for Croatia completed a 4\u20131 victory.[188] Morocco scored two early goals through Hakim Ziyech and Youssef En-Nesyri in their game against Canada and qualified following a 2\u20131 victory. Canada's only goal was an own goal by Nayef Aguerd.[189] Croatia and Belgium played a goalless draw which eliminated Belgium, whose team was ranked second in the world, from the tournament.[190]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0Morocco | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 4\n | 1\n | +3\n | 7\n | Advanced to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0Croatia | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n | 0\n | 4\n | 1\n | +3\n | 5\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n | \u22121\n | 4\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n | 2\n | 7\n | \u22125\n | 0\n |\n\nSource: FIFA\n\n23\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-23)\n13:00\n\n\n| Morocco\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Croatia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nAl Bayt Stadium, Al Khor\nAttendance: 59,407\nReferee: Fernando Rapallini (Argentina)\n\n23\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-23)\n22:00\n\n\n| Belgium\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Canada |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Batshuayi ![](image) 44'\n | Report |  |\n\nAhmad bin Ali Stadium, Al Rayyan\nAttendance: 40,432\nReferee: Janny Sikazwe (Zambia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n27\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-27)\n16:00\n\n\n| Belgium\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0Morocco |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Sa\u00efss ![](image) 73'\n* Aboukhlal ![](image) 90+2'\n |\n\nAl Thumama Stadium, Doha\nAttendance: 43,738\nReferee: C\u00e9sar Arturo Ramos (Mexico)\n\n27\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-27)\n19:00\n\n\n| Croatia\u00a0![](image) | 4\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Canada |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Kramari\u0107 ![](image) 36', 70'\n* Livaja ![](image) 44'\n* Majer ![](image) 90+4'\n | Report | * Davies ![](image) 2'\n |\n\nKhalifa International Stadium, Al Rayyan\nAttendance: 44,374\nReferee: Andr\u00e9s Matonte (Uruguay)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-01)\n18:00\n\n\n| Croatia\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nAhmad bin Ali Stadium, Al Rayyan\nAttendance: 43,984\nReferee: Anthony Taylor (England)\n\n1\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-01)\n18:00\n\n\n| Canada\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0Morocco |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Aguerd ![](image) 40'\u00a0(o.g.)\n | Report | * Ziyech ![](image) 4'\n* En-Nesyri ![](image) 23'\n |\n\nAl Thumama Stadium, Doha\nAttendance: 43,102\nReferee: Raphael Claus (Brazil)\n\n### Group G[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 FIFA World Cup Group G\n\nBreel Embolo scored the only goal in Switzerland's 1\u20130 defeat of Cameroon.[191] Richarlison scored two goals as Brazil won against Serbia, with star player Neymar receiving an ankle injury.[192] Cameroon's Jean-Charles Castelletto scored the opening goal against Serbia, but they were quickly behind as Serbia scored three goals by Strahinja Pavlovi\u0107, Sergej Milinkovi\u0107-Savi\u0107, and Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107 either side of half time. Cameroon, however, scored goals through Vincent Aboubakar and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, completing a 3\u20133 draw.[193] An 83rd-minute winner by Casemiro for Brazil over Switzerland was enough for them to qualify for the knockout stage.[194] Having already qualified, Brazil were unable to win their final group game, as they were defeated by Cameroon 1\u20130 following a goal by Vincent Aboubakar. Already having a yellow card, he was later sent off for removing his shirt in celebrating the goal.[195] Cameroon, however, did not qualify, as Switzerland defeated Serbia 3\u20132.[196]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 3\n | 1\n | +2\n | 6\n | Advanced to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 4\n | 3\n | +1\n | 6\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Cameroon | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 4\n | 4\n | 0\n | 4\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0Serbia | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 5\n | 8\n | \u22123\n | 1\n |\n\nSource: FIFA\n\n24\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-24)\n13:00\n\n\n| Switzerland\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Cameroon |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Embolo ![](image) 48'\n | Report |  |\n\nAl Janoub Stadium, Al Wakrah\nAttendance: 39,089\nReferee: Facundo Tello (Argentina)\n\n24\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-24)\n22:00\n\n\n| Brazil\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Serbia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Richarlison ![](image) 62', 73'\n | Report |  |\n\nLusail Stadium, Lusail\nAttendance: 88,103\nReferee: Alireza Faghani (Iran)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n28\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-28)\n13:00\n\n\n| Cameroon\u00a0![](image) | 3\u20133 | ![](image)\u00a0Serbia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Castelletto ![](image) 29'\n* Aboubakar ![](image) 63'\n* Choupo-Moting ![](image) 66'\n | Report | * Pavlovi\u0107 ![](image) 45+1'\n* S.

In scoring the goal, Ronaldo became the first man to score in five World Cups. Ghana responded with a goal by Andr\u00e9 Ayew before goals by Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix, and Rafael Le\u00e3o by Portugal put them 3\u20131 ahead. Osman Bukari scored in the 89th minute to trail by a single goal, while I\u00f1aki Williams had a chance to equalise for Ghana ten minutes into stoppage time, but slipped before shooting. The match finished 3\u20132 to Portugal.[198] Ghanaian Mohammed Salisu opened the scoring against South Korea, with Mohammed Kudus following it up. In the second half, Cho Gue-sung scored a brace for South Korea, levelling the score. Mohammed Kudus scored again in the 68th minute, winning the match 3\u20132 for Ghana.[199] Portugal defeated Uruguay 2\u20130 with two goals from Bruno Fernandes, advancing them to the knockout stage.[200] A controversial penalty decision was called late in the game, with a suspected handball from Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez.[201][202] Portugal led South Korea through Ricardo Horta after 10 minutes. However, goals by Kim Young-gwon and Hwang Hee-chan won the match 2\u20131 for South Korea.[203] Giorgian de Arrascaeta scored two goals as Uruguay defeated Ghana 2\u20130.[204] However, with South Korea winning, Uruguay required another goal to progress as they finished third on goals scored.[205] Several Uruguay players left the pitch after the game surrounding the referees and followed them off the pitch.[206][207][208]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 6\n | 4\n | +2\n | 6\n | Advanced to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 4\n | 4\n | 0\n | 4\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Uruguay | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 0\n | 4\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0Ghana | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 5\n | 7\n | \u22122\n | 3\n |\n\nSource: FIFA\n\n24\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-24)\n16:00\n\n\n| Uruguay\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nEducation City Stadium, Al Rayyan\nAttendance: 41,663\nReferee: Cl\u00e9ment Turpin (France)\n\n24\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-24)\n19:00\n\n\n| Portugal\u00a0![](image) | 3\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0Ghana |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Ronaldo ![](image) 65'\u00a0(pen.)\n* F\u00e9lix ![](image) 78'\n* Le\u00e3o ![](image) 80'\n | Report | * A.

Morocco became the first African and the first Arab nation to advance as far as the semi-finals of the competition.[221] Despite Harry Kane scoring a penalty for England, it was not enough to beat France, who won 2\u20131 by virtue of goals from Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni and Olivier Giroud and a late missed penalty by Kane, sending them to their second consecutive World Cup semi-final and becoming the first defending champions to reach this stage since Brazil in 1998.[222][223]\n\n\n\n9\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-09)\n18:00\n\n\n| Croatia\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20131 (a.e.t.) | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Petkovi\u0107 ![](image) 117'\n | Report | * Neymar ![](image) 105+1'\n |\n| Penalties |\n| * Vla\u0161i\u0107 ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Majer ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Modri\u0107 ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Or\u0161i\u0107 ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 4\u20132 | * ![soccer ball with red X](image) Rodrygo\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Casemiro\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Pedro\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Marquinhos\n |\n\nEducation City Stadium, Al Rayyan\nAttendance: 43,893\nReferee: Michael Oliver (England)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nMain article: Battle of Lusail\n\n9\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-09)\n22:00\n\n\n| Netherlands\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20132 (a.e.t.) | ![](image)\u00a0Argentina |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Weghorst ![](image) 83', 90+11'\n | Report | * Molina ![](image) 35'\n* Messi ![](image) 73'\u00a0(pen.)\n |\n| Penalties |\n| * Van Dijk ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Berghuis ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Koopmeiners ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Weghorst ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* L. de Jong ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 3\u20134 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Messi\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Paredes\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Montiel\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Fern\u00e1ndez\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) La.

Both teams had won the event twice previously.[228] Early goals from Lionel Messi and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda gave Argentina, leading 2\u20130, a head start against the French.[228][229] Despite substitutions in the first half, France did not record a shot until after the 70th minute but were energised by additional substitutions in the 71st. A few minutes later, France were awarded a penalty as Randal Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area by Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi. Mbapp\u00e9 scored the penalty and added a second goal less than two minutes later to equalise the scores.[229] With the score tied at two goals apiece, the match went to extra time. Messi scored his second goal in the 108th minute, once again giving Argentina the lead. However, Mbapp\u00e9 was awarded a second penalty in the 115th minute after his shot hit the arm of Gonzalo Montiel. Mbapp\u00e9 scored his third goal, becoming the second player ever to complete a hat-trick in the final of a World Cup after Geoff Hurst for England in 1966.[229] With the score tied at 3\u20133, the match was determined via a penalty shootout. Argentina won the final after scoring all of their penalties, winning 4\u20132.[229] This marked their third World Cup win and their first since 1986.[229]\n\n\n\n18\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-18)\n18:00\n\n\n| Argentina\u00a0![](image) | 3\u20133 (a.e.t.) | ![](image)\u00a0France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Messi ![](image)

becoming the first player to win it twice. France's Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 *(right)* won the Golden Boot award after scoring eight goals in the tournament, the most since Ronaldo in 2002.\n\nThe following World Cup awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament: the Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper).[236]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Golden Ball | Silver Ball\n | Bronze Ball\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Argentina](image) Lionel Messi | ![France](image) Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 | ![Croatia](image) Luka Modri\u0107 |\n| Golden Boot | Silver Boot\n | Bronze Boot\n |\n| ![France](image) Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 | ![Argentina](image) Lionel Messi | ![France](image) Olivier Giroud |\n| 8 goals, 2 assists\n | 7 goals, 3 assists\n | 4 goals, 0 assists\n |\n| Golden Glove |\n| ![Argentina](image) Emiliano Mart\u00ednez |\n| FIFA Young Player Award |\n| ![Argentina](image) Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez |\n| FIFA Fair Play Trophy |\n| ![](image)\u00a0England |\n\n\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 10 goals for users to vote on as the tournament's best. The award was won by Brazil's Richarlison for his second goal in the group stage match against Serbia.[237]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Branding[edit]\n\n\nThe official emblem was designed by Unlock Brands[238] and unveiled in September 2019, during simultaneous events at the Doha Tower, Katara Cultural Village amphitheatre, Msheireb Downtown Doha, and Zubarah. It was designed to resemble the tournament trophy, the infinity symbol, and the number \"8\", reflecting upon the \"interconnected\" event and the eight host stadiums. It also evoked imagery of shawls to signify the tournament's late fall scheduling, and contained waves resembling desert dunes. The typography of the emblem's wordmark incorporated kashida\u2014the practice of elongating certain parts of characters in Arabic script to provide typographical emphasis.[239][240][241]\n\n\nH.E Ambassador Dr. Hend Al-Muftah, Permanent Representative of the State of Qatar to the United Nations Office at Geneva, explained to WIPO Magazine that the tournament provided an opportunity to \"promote our culture and showcase our signature hospitality in a multicultural environment\", and highlighted that the country has used sports to demonstrate its \"commitment to sustainable development, social inclusion and the values of community and mutual respect among peoples from different cultures and nations.\"[242]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nSee also: FIFA World Cup video games\n\nElectronic Arts' licensed video games *FIFA Mobile* and *FIFA 23* (except on Nintendo Switch) received free updates with tie-in content for the 2022 World Cup on 8 and 9 November 2022, respectively. The update for *FIFA 23* added World Cup-themed tournament modes with all teams and two of the stadiums from the event, campaigns and World Cup-themed unlockable content for Ultimate Team mode, and real-time squad and fixture updates during the tournament.[243]\n\n\nOn 24 August 2022, the Panini Group produced themed stickers and a sticker album for a 14th consecutive World Cup. This year, rare cards with coloured borders were included and could be collected, traded, or sold.[244]\n\n\nOn 12 April 2022, FIFA released an over-the-top media service and app revolving around the World Cup called FIFA+, where fans could play games, predict matches, and compete with others.[245]\n\n\n\n### Broadcasting rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights\n\nIn May 2022, Infantino projected that the 2022 FIFA World Cup could be the most-watched in its history, with a global audience of at least 5\u00a0billion. The 2018 tournament was seen by 3.57\u00a0billion across the tournament.[246] The various controversies surrounding the World Cup in Qatar led to questions over how the tournament would be covered in the media, and whether they would be discussed or addressed during coverage.[247][248] The match between England and the United States in the group stage was seen by approximately 20 million viewers across both Fox and Telemundo, ranking among the highest-rated associated football broadcasts in the United States (behind a 2014 World Cup match that drew 24.7\u00a0million).[249][250]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| FIFA partners | FIFA World Cup sponsors | African and Middle Eastern supporters | Asian supporters | European supporters | North American supporters | South American supporters\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Adidas[251]\n* Coca-Cola[252]\n* Hyundai\u2013Kia[253]\n* Qatar Airways[254]\n* QatarEnergy[255]\n* Visa[256]\n* Wanda Group[257]\n | * Anheuser-Busch InBev[258]\n* Byju's[259]\n* Crypto.com[260]\n* Hisense[261]\n* McDonald's[262]\n* Mengniu Dairy[263]\n* Vivo[264]\n | * Fine Hygienic Holding[265]\n* GWC Logistics[266]\n* Ooredoo[267]\n* Saudi Tourism Authority\n* QNB Group[268]\n | * BOSS Zhipin[269]\n* Yadea[270]\n | * Betano[271]\n* Globant[272]\n* YouTube[273]\n | * Algorand[274]\n* Frito-Lay[275]\n* Look Company[276]\n* Visit Las Vegas[277]\n | * Claro[278]\n* Inter Rapid\u00edsimo[279]\n* Nubank[280]\n* UPL[281]\n |\n\n\n## Symbols[edit]\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nMain article: La'eeb\n\nThe tournament's official mascot was unveiled on 1 April 2022, during the group stage draw. Its name is La\u02bceeb (Arabic: \u0644\u0639\u064a\u0628, romanized:\u00a0*La\u02bf\u012bb*), which is an Arabic word meaning \"super-skilled player\". The official website of FIFA says: \"La\u02bceeb will be known for his youthful spirit; spreading joy and confidence everywhere he goes\", and the official backstory of the character, published there, claims that it comes from a parallel world where tournament mascots live, \"a world where ideas and creativity form the basis of characters that live in the minds of everyone\".[282]\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Al Rihla\n\n![](image)*The adidas Al Rihla*\nThe official match ball, \"Al Rihla\", was unveiled on 30 March 2022. It was mainly inspired by the culture, architecture, iconic boats and flag of Qatar. In Arabic, the word *Al-Rihla* (\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0651\u062d\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0629 *ar-ri\u1e25la*) means \"the journey\". The ball was designed with sustainability as a priority, making it the first-ever official match ball created with water-based glues and inks. As \"the game is getting faster\" and \"speeds up\", the Adidas ball has internal electronic sensors, allowing detection of its speed and position, updated 500 times per second[283] and it has to be charged before each game.[284] Two of the match balls were sent and returned from space by FIFA and Qatar Airways on a SpaceX falcon 9 suborbital mission for promoting the World Cup.[285]\n\n\nThe match ball for the 2022 FIFA World Cup Final was announced on 11 December 2022. It is a variation of the Al Rihla named the *Adidas Al Hilm* (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0644\u0645, romanized:\u00a0*al-\u1e25ulm*, lit.\u2009'the dream', a reference to \"every nation's dream of lifting the FIFA World Cup\").[286] Whilst the technical aspects of the ball are the same, the colour is different from the Al-Rihla balls used in the group stages and preceding knockout games, with a *Gold Metallic*, maroon, *Collegiate Burgundy*, and red design,[287] a reference to the national colors of host nation Qatar and the golden colors shared by the Final's venue and the FIFA World Cup Trophy.[288]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nSee also: FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Official Soundtrack and List of FIFA World Cup songs and anthems\n\nFor the first time, a multi-song FIFA World Cup official soundtrack has been released, instead of one official song.[289] The first song of the album is \"Hayya Hayya (Better Together)\", performed by Trinidad Cardona, Davido, and AISHA, released on 1 April 2022 along with the music video.[290] The second song is \"Arhbo\", performed by Gims and Ozuna, released on 19 August 2022 along with the music video.[291] The third song is \"The World Is Yours to Take\" performed by American rapper Lil Baby, released on 23 September 2022 along with a music video.[292] The fourth song is \"Light The Sky\" performed by Nora Fatehi, Manal, Rahma Riad, and Balqees, composed by RedOne and released on 7 October 2022 along with the music video.[293]\nA fifth song, \"Tukoh Taka\", performed by Nicki Minaj, Maluma and Myriam Fares, was released on 17 November 2022 along with the music video, serving as the official song of the FIFA Fan Festival.[294] The final song is \"Dreamers\" by Jungkook of BTS released on 20 November 2022. It was performed with Fahad Al-Kubaisi during the tournament's opening ceremony.[295][296]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies\n\nCriticism of the 2022 FIFA World Cup focused on Qatar's human-rights record,[297] namely their treatment of migrant workers,[297] women, and position on LGBT rights,[298] leading to allegations of sportswashing.[P] Others cited Qatar's climate, lack of a strong football culture, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption.[6][302] Boycotts of the event were declared by several countries, clubs, and individual players,[300][301] with former FIFA president Sepp Blatter twice stating that giving Qatar hosting rights was a \"mistake\".[303][304] The FIFA World Cup delivered record-breaking numbers of TV audiences across multiple markets.[305] In June 2023, Le Point revealed that FIFA World Cup has raised great interest in the country despite \"calls for a boycott\". According to the study by *Arcom*, six out of ten French people followed at least one match.[306]\n\n\n\n### Host selection criticism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Russian President Vladimir Putin handing over the symbolic relay baton for the hosting rights of the 2022 FIFA World Cup to Qatar's Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in June 2018\nThere have been allegations of bribery and corruption in the selection process involving FIFA's executive committee members.[307] These allegations are being investigated by FIFA (see \u00a7\u00a0Bidding corruption allegations, 2014, below). In May 2011, allegations of corruption within the FIFA senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup 2022 being held in Qatar. The accusations of corruption were made relating to how Qatar won the right to host the event. A FIFA internal investigation and report cleared Qatar of any violation, but chief investigator Michael J. Garcia described FIFA's report on his enquiry as containing \"numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations.\"[308]\n\n\nIn May 2015, Swiss federal prosecutors opened an investigation into corruption and money laundering related to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids.[309][310] In August 2018, former FIFA president Sepp Blatter claimed that Qatar had used \"black ops\", suggesting that the bid committee had cheated to win the hosting rights.[311] Some investigations found that Qatar sought an edge in securing hosting by hiring a former CIA officer turned private contractor, Kevin Chalker, to spy on rival bid teams and key football officials who picked the winner in 2010.[312]\n\n\nIn September 2018, a delegation from al-Ghufran tribe lodged a complaint to FIFA's president to reject the establishment of the World Cup in Qatar unless its government restored the Qatari nationality to all those affected from the tribe and returned land allegedly stolen from them to build the sport facilities.[313]\n\n\nQatar faced strong criticism for the treatment of foreign workers involved in preparation for the World Cup, with Amnesty International referring to \"forced labour\" and poor working conditions,[314][315] while many migrant workers reported having to pay large \"recruitment fees\" to obtain employment.[316] *The Guardian* newspaper reported that many workers were denied food and water, had their identity papers taken away from them, and that they were not paid on time or at all, making some of them in effect slaves. *The Guardian* estimated that up to 4,000 workers could die from lax safety and other causes by the time the competition was held. Between 2015 and 2021, the Qatari government adopted new labour reforms to improve working conditions, including a minimum wage for all workers and the removal of the kafala system. Furthermore, in November 2017, the International Labour Organization concluded that no rights were violated and made the decision to close the complaint against Qatar regarding the alleged violation of migrant workers' rights.[317] According to Amnesty International, however, living and working conditions of the foreign workers did not improve in the last years.[318]\n\n\nQatar was the smallest nation by area ever to have been awarded a FIFA World Cup\u00a0\u2013 the next smallest by area was Switzerland, host of the 1954 World Cup, which was more than three times as large as Qatar and only needed to host 16 teams instead of 32. Qatar also became only the second country (not including Uruguay and Italy, hosts of the first two World Cups) to be awarded a FIFA World Cup despite having never qualified for a previous edition: Japan was awarded co-hosting rights of the 2002 World Cup in 1996 without ever having qualified for the finals, although they qualified for the 1998 edition. Of the eight stadiums used in the tournament, six were located in the Doha metropolitan area, making it the first World Cup since 1930 in which most of the stadiums were in one city. While this decreased the distance that fans and players needed to commute, Qatar itself struggled to accommodate the numbers of arriving fans with its diminutive amount of space.[319]\n\n\nDue to Qatar's laws on alcohol consumption, World Cup organisers announced the creation of designated \"sobering-up\" zones as an alternative to wide-scale arrests of intoxicated fans during the World Cup.[320] Qatar's World Cup chief executive of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, Nasser Al Khater, stated that the purpose of the designated sobering-up areas was to ensure the fans' safety.[321] If a fan was sent to the \"sobering up\" zone, they were permitted to leave when they could display clearheaded behaviour.[322] Multiple news agencies described the controversy as a \"cultural clash\" between social conservatism and Islamic morality against the \"norms\" of secular Western liberal democracies.[11][323]\n\n\nA number of groups and media outlets expressed concern over the suitability of Qatar to host the event.[324][325] Issues regarding from human rights,[8][298] worker conditions, the rights of LGBT fans,[298] and the illegality of homosexuality in Qatar.[326][327][328] In December 2020, Qatar said rainbow flags would be allowed at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[329] Qatari officials initially stated that they would not prohibit the display of pride flags at tournament venues, although the country still advised LGBT attendees to comply with the country's modesty and avoid public displays of affection.[330][331] Hassan Abdulla al-Thawadi, chief executive of the country's World Cup bid, said that Qatar would permit alcohol consumption during the event,[332][333] even though drinking in public was not permitted.[334] There were plans to allow the sale of alcohol inside stadiums and at fan villages.[335] Normally, the sale of alcohol is restricted to non-Muslim guests at selected luxury hotels only.[336] However, in the months preceding the tournament, the display of LGBT material and the sale of alcohol were banned.[335][337][338][339][340]\n\n\nThe climate conditions caused some to call hosting the tournament in Qatar infeasible, with initial plans for air-conditioned stadiums giving way to a potential date switch from summer to November and December.[5] In May 2014, Sepp Blatter, who was FIFA president at the time of the selection, remarked that awarding the World Cup to Qatar was a \"mistake\" because of the extreme heat.[5][341][342] While addressing delegates from African and Asian confederations, Blatter said allegations of corruption and some of the criticism, including those from sponsors, were \"very much linked to racism and discrimination\".[343] The attendance figures at the matches also came under scrutiny as the reported crowd attendance was more than the stadium capacities despite games having visible empty seats.[344]\n\n\nPrior to the tournament, a reporter for Denmark's TV 2 was threatened by security during a live report from the Katara Cultural Village; the organising committee apologised, stating that they were \"mistakenly interrupted\".[345] Tony O'Donoghue of Ireland's RT\u00c9 also accused Qatari police of interrupting him while filming.[346]\n\n\nOn 5 November 2022, *The Sunday Times* and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism published an investigation reporting that a group from an Indian hacking company had compromised the email accounts of various politicians, reporters, and other prominent individuals that had been critical of Qatar's hosting of the World Cup. It was also reported that the group had been hired by Jonas Rey, private investigators based in Switzerland, which were in turn hired by Qatari officials.[347]\n\n\n\n### Migrant workers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Human rights issues involving the 2022 FIFA World Cup \u00a7\u00a0Migrant workers\n\nThere were criticisms the state of human rights in Qatar and of the conditions of migrant workers brought in to build the required infrastructure, including indentured servitude and working conditions leading to deaths.[351] On October 23, 2022, an article published by *The Guardian* included statements from migrants working on the event infrastructure. Surveying 1,000 workers, 86% of participants said that the labour changes had improved their lives and that better working conditions are negotiable.[352] Legislation has also been proposed on the minimum wage, summertime worker safety, and the election of migrant worker representatives in businesses. Labour mobility is a result of changes to the Kafala system.[353]\n\n\nAccording to Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, prior to the tournament, \"the new Kafala system tranche of law will put an end to Kafala and establish a contemporary industrial relations system.\"[354]\n\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino has defended Qatar's decision to host the tournament.[355] Others have asserted that Qatar has a better human rights record than Russia and China, which were subjected to less harsh criticism for the same problems when hosting important athletic events in the years before the tournament.[356]\n\n\n\n### Move to November and December[edit]\n\n\nOwing to the climate in Qatar, concerns were expressed over holding the World Cup in its traditional time frame of June and July.[5] In October 2013, a task force was commissioned to consider alternative dates and report after the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.[357] On 24 February 2015, the FIFA Task Force proposed that the tournament be played from late November to late December 2022,[358] to avoid the summer heat and also avoid clashing with the 2022 Winter Olympics in February, the 2022 Winter Paralympics in March and Ramadan in April.[359][360]\n\n\nThe notion of staging the tournament in November was controversial because it would interfere with the regular season schedules of some domestic leagues around the world. Commentators noted the clash with the Christian Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, whilst there was concern about how short the tournament was intended to be.[361] FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the event to Qatar was a \"blatant mistake\".[362]\n\n\nFrank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said that if the 2022 World Cup were moved to November and thus upset the schedule of the A-League, they would seek compensation from FIFA.[363] Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme.[364] In 2015, FIFA confirmed that the final would be played in December.[365] Critics condemned the Euro-centrism of these allegations, and questioned why global sporting events must be held within the traditional European summer season.[366]\n\n\n\n### Bidding corruption allegations, 2014[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Garcia Report\n\nSome allegations were made over the role of former football official Mohammed bin Hammam played in securing the bid.[367] A former employee of the Qatar bid team alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5\u00a0million by Qatar.[368] She retracted her claims, but later said that she was coerced to do so by Qatari bid officials.[369][370] In March 2014, it was discovered that former CONCACAF president Jack Warner and his family were paid almost $2\u00a0million from a firm linked to Qatar's successful campaign.[371]\n\n\n*The Sunday Times* published bribery allegations based on a leak of millions of secret documents.[372] Five of FIFA's six primary sponsors, Sony, Adidas, Visa, Hyundai, and Coca-Cola, called upon FIFA to investigate the claims.[373][374] Jim Boyce, vice-president of FIFA, stated he would support a re-vote to find a new host if the corruption allegations are proven.[375][376] FIFA completed a lengthy investigation into these allegations and a report cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing. Despite the claims, the Qataris insisted that the corruption allegations were being driven by envy and mistrust while Blatter said it was fueled by racism in the British media.[377][378]\n\n\nIn the 2015 FIFA corruption case, Swiss officials, operating under information from the United States Department of Justice, arrested many senior FIFA officials in Z\u00fcrich and seized physical and electronic records from FIFA's main headquarters. The arrests continued in the United States, where several FIFA officers were arrested, and FIFA buildings were raided. The arrests were made on the information of at least a $150\u00a0million corruption and bribery scandal.[379] From those arrested, $40 million was forfeited under guilty pleas.[380] In 2022, the president of the El Salvador soccer association, Reynaldo Vasquez, was sentenced to 16 months in prison in connection to over $350,000 in bribes.[381]\n\n\nFollowing the corruption case, Phaedra Almajid, the former media officer for the Qatar bid team, claimed that the allegations would result in Qatar not hosting the World Cup.[382] In an interview published on the same day, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled.\"[383][384]\n\n\nIn 2014, FIFA appointed Michael Garcia as its independent ethics investigator to look into bribery allegations against Russia and Qatar. Garcia investigated all nine bids and eleven countries involved in the 2018 and 2022 bids.[385] At the end of the investigation, Garcia submitted a 430-page report. The FIFA governing body then appointed a German judge, Hans Joachim Eckert, who reviewed and presented a 42-page summary of the report two months later. The report cleared Qatar and Russia of bribery allegations, stating that Qatar \"pulled Aspire into the orbit of the bid in significant ways\" but did not \"compromise the integrity\" of the overall bid process.[386] Michael Garcia reacted almost immediately, stating that the report is \"materially incomplete\" and contains \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\".[386]\n\n\nIn 2017, a German journalist Peter Rossberg claimed to have obtained the report and wrote that it \"does not provide proof that the 2018 or 2022 World Cup was bought\" and stated that he would publish the full report. This forced FIFA to release the original report. The full report did not provide any evidence of corruption against the host of the 2022 World Cup but stated that bidders tested the rules of conduct to the limit.[387]\n\n\n\n### Russian participation[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) handed Russia a four-year ban from all major sporting events, after RUSADA was found non-compliant for handing over manipulated lab data to investigators.[388] The Russian national team were still permitted to enter qualification, as the ban only applied to the final tournament to decide the world champions. A team representing Russia, which used the Russian flag and anthem, could not participate under the WADA decision whilst the ban was active.[389] The decision was appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport,[390] and on 17 December 2020, Russian teams were banned from competing at world championships organized or sanctioned by a WADA signatory until 16 December 2022, the day before the third place play-off.[391]\n\n\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia's participation was further thrown into doubt. On 24 February 2022, the three teams in Russia's qualifying path\u2014Czech Republic, Poland, and Sweden\u2014announced their unwillingness to play any matches in Russian territory.[392] Poland and Sweden extended the boycott on 26 February to any qualifying games, and the Czech Republic made the same decision one day later.[393][394][395]\n\n\nOn 27 February 2022, FIFA announced a number of sanctions impacting Russia's participation in international football. Russia was prohibited from hosting international competitions, and the national team was ordered to play all home matches behind closed doors in neutral countries. Under these sanctions, Russia would not be allowed to compete under the country's name, flag, or national anthem; similarly to the Russian athletes' participation in events such as the Olympics,[396] the team would compete under the abbreviation of their national federation, the Russian Football Union (\"RFU\"), rather than \"Russia\".[397] The next day, FIFA decided to suspend Russia from international competitions \"until further notice\", including its participation in the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[398]\n\n\n\n### LGBT and women's rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup\n\nThere are no LGBT rights in Qatar, with homosexuality as well as campaigning for LGBTQ+ rights criminalized. As such, when Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with the security of fans,[399] as well as the homophobic football chants of certain nations, were points of discussion.[400] The main controversy came from a last-minute FIFA decision to hand out player punishments to European captains who had months earlier announced their intention to continue wearing rainbow-colored armbands (which began in 2020) in support of anti-discrimination. Typically, kit violations incur a fine, which the teams had said they would pay; on the day of the first match involving one of the teams, FIFA reportedly told the teams that they would receive a yellow card at a minimum for wearing the armbands.[401] Qatari officials stated that all people are welcome as long as they follow the public display of affection laws which apply to everyone.[402][403]\n\n\nSecurity officials at stadiums also confiscated items of rainbow clothing and flags featuring rainbows.[404][405][406] American journalist Grant Wahl was briefly detained for wearing a t-shirt with a rainbow on it.[407] Wahl reportedly received death threats for wearing the shirt, later dying at the stadium.[408][409] Other journalists with Wahl at the time of his death have reported that he began fitting or experiencing a seizure, and called for help himself. They criticized the Qatar Supreme Committee for not providing defibrillators in the stadium, as they had looked for one to try to help Wahl.[410] In response, FIFA said that according to the ambulance service, a defibrillator was made available when paramedics later arrived on scene.[411] An autopsy done on Wahl in New York City later revealed that Wahl died from an aortic aneurysm rupture.[412]\n\n\nDiscrimination against women in Qatar was also criticized.[413][414] Women in Qatar have few freedoms,[413][415] as they must obtain permission from their male guardians to marry, study abroad on government scholarships, work in many government jobs, travel abroad, receive certain forms of reproductive health care, and act as the primary guardian of children, even if they are divorced.[416]\n\n\nQatar attracted particular criticism for an incident where a Mexican employee of the World Cup Organizing Committee was accused of allegedly having sex outside of marriage. The woman had previously reported rape, while the male claimed to have been in a relationship with her, after which the woman was investigated for extramarital sex. Women in Qatar face the possible penalty of flagellation and a seven-year prison sentence if convicted for having sex outside of marriage. The criminal case was eventually dropped months after she was allowed to leave Qatar.[417]\n\n\n\n### Influence of Iran[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An Iranian fan showing a banner with \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" slogan\nIn November 2022, there were reports suggesting that the government of Iran were working with Qatari officials to suppress anti-government protests at the 2022 FIFA World Cup,[418] in light of the Mahsa Amini protests. Leaked documents and audio clips suggested that Iranian government officials were in correspondence with Qatari authorities in order to handle possible protesters.[419]\n\n\nIn November 2022, the Qatari government revoked the visas of journalists from a London-based Iranian news channel, Iran International, known for being critical of the regime, who were seeking to cover the World Cup.[420] On 21 November 2022, during the first group stage match from Group B, between Iran and England, attempts were reportedly made by the stadium's security forces to block Iranian fans who wore clothing or carried items bearing slogans that were deemed unsympathetic to the Islamic government of Iran.[421] These included t-shirts and signs with \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" embedded onto them, Iran's previous flags, or any slogans containing the name of Mahsa Amini.[422] This crackdown continued throughout all of Iran's matches at the World Cup.[418] In addition to removing fans from stadiums, reports showed that officials tried to suppress any filming or photography of possible protests. In one case, Qatari police detained Danish TV presenter, Rasmus Tantholdt, for filming fans with \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" slogans, some of whom who had been earlier abused by a group of pro-government supporters.[423]\n\n\n\n### Treatment of Jewish and Israeli visitors[edit]\n\n\nQatar had previously promised to provide Jewish tourists with cooked *kosher* food and public Jewish prayer services at the tournament. However, shortly before the World Cup began, both were banned by Qatar, who claimed it could not secure the safety of Jews.[424][425] Qatar alleged that they could not \"secure\" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat. It was estimated that 10,000 religious Jews from Israel and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar.[426]\n\n\nWhilst Jewish organisations complained of being unable to find cooked kosher food,[426] the Israeli government said it was happy with the efforts made by Qatar to meet its requests, including kosher food, direct flights from Israel to Qatar, and temporary diplomatic representation in the country. A kosher kitchen under the supervision of Rabbi Mendy Chitrik was open in time for the first match. Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, said he had never asked the Qatari government for cooked food, and he had been the only person in communication with the Qataris regarding making the World Cup experience inclusive for Jews.[427]\n\n\nMultiple Israeli reporters at the tournament reported fans from Arab nations waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israeli slogans while harassing them.[298][428][429] Some Israelis reported that they had been escorted out of restaurants when their nationality was revealed.[430] The Israeli government warned its citizens traveling to the tournament to hide their Israeli identity out of safety concerns.[431]\n\n\n\n### Accommodation[edit]\n\n\nThe Rawdat Al Jahhaniya fan village was criticised for its overpriced \"night cabins\" (\u00a3185 per night) made out of shipping containers. Tourists complained that the air conditioners in the cabins did not function well, facilities were falling apart, and the sleeping experience did not match their expectations.[432] The BBC reported that the tent accommodation at the Qetaifan Island fan village got criticism for having brown-colored tap water and no air conditioning other than a standing fan.[433][434] The tent village in Al Khor was criticized for having inconvenient transportation, a lack of alcohol, long waits to check in, and no locks on the tents.[435][436] The lack of suitable and affordable accommodation raised demand for daily shuttle flights from neighboring areas, such as Dubai, that had adequate numbers of hotel rooms.[437]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* FIFA World Cup\n* FIFA World Cup hosts\n* 2021 FIFA Arab Cup\n* 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup\n* 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The 2018 competition in Russia featured two partially Asian venues, according to various definitions of the geographical boundary between Asia and Europe\u2014Yekaterinburg (sits on the foothills of the Ural mountains and acts a barrier between Europe and Asia) and Sochi.

It took place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A]\n\n\nThis tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate,[B] the event was held during November and December instead of in the traditional months of May, June, or July.[C] It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. Qatar entered the event\u2014their first World Cup\u2014automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.\n\n\nArgentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4\u20132 on penalties following a 3\u20133 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since 1986, as well as being the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament since 2002. French player Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 became the first player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final since Geoff Hurst in the 1966 final and won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals (eight) during the tournament. Argentine captain Lionel Messi was voted the tournament's best player, winning the Golden Ball. The tournament has been considered exceptionally poetic as the capstone of his career, for some commentators fulfilling a previously unmet criterion to be regarded the greatest player of all time.[4] Teammates Emiliano Mart\u00ednez and Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez won the Golden Glove, awarded to the tournament's best goalkeeper; and the Young Player Award, awarded to the tournament's best young player, respectively. With 172 goals, the tournament set a record for the highest number of goals scored in the 32-team format, with every participating team scoring at least one goal.\n\n\nThe choice to host the World Cup in Qatar attracted significant criticism, with concerns raised over the country's treatment of migrant workers, women and members of the LGBT community, as well as Qatar's climate, lack of a strong football culture, scheduling changes, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption.[D]\n\n\n\n\n## Format[edit]\n\n\nThe FIFA World Cup is a professional football tournament held between national football teams, organised by FIFA.[13][14] The tournament, held every four years, was first played in 1930 in Uruguay,[15] and has been contested by 32 teams since the 1998 event.[15] The tournament was contested with eight round-robin groups followed by a knockout round for 16 teams.[16] The defending champions were France, who defeated Croatia 4\u20132 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final.[17][18] The event was scheduled to take place under a reduced length,[19] from 20 November to 18 December in Qatar.[20][21][22] Being held in Qatar, it was the first World Cup tournament to be held in the Arab world.[23] Spectators were not required to follow most COVID-19 pandemic restrictions such as social distancing, wearing masks, and negative tests.[24]\n\n\n\n### Schedule[edit]\n\n\nUnlike previous FIFA World Cups, which are typically played in June and July, because of Qatar's intense summer heat and often fairly high humidity,[2][21][25] the 2022 World Cup was played in November and December.[5][26] As a result, the World Cup was unusually staged in the middle of the seasons of many domestic association football leagues, which started in late July or August, including all of the major European leagues, which had been obliged to incorporate extended breaks into their domestic schedules to accommodate the World Cup. Major European competitions had scheduled their respective competitions group matches to be played before the World Cup, to avoid playing group matches the following year.[27]\n\n\nThe match schedule was confirmed by FIFA in July 2020.[28] The group stage was set to begin on 21 November, with four matches every day. Later, the schedule was tweaked by moving the Qatar vs Ecuador game to 20 November, after Qatar lobbied FIFA to allow their team to open the tournament.[29][30][31] The final was played on 18 December 2022, National Day, at Lusail Stadium.[28][32]\n\n\nThe matches for each group were allocated to the following stadiums:[32]\n\n\n\n* Groups A, B, E, F: Al Bayt Stadium, Khalifa International Stadium, Al Thumama Stadium, Ahmad bin Ali Stadium\n* Groups C, D, G, H: Lusail Stadium, Stadium 974, Education City Stadium, Al Janoub Stadium\n\n\nFIFA confirmed the group stage venue and kick-off times on 1 April 2022, following the draw.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Prize money[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2022, FIFA announced the prizes for all participating nations. Each qualified team received $1.5\u00a0million before the competition to cover preparation costs with each team receiving at least $9\u00a0million in prize money. This edition's total prize pool was $440\u00a0million, $40\u00a0million greater than the prize pool of the previous tournament.[35]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Place\n | Teams\n | Amount (in millions)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Per team\n | Total\n |\n| Champions\n | 1\n | $42\n | $42\n |\n| Runners-up\n | 1\n | $30\n | $30\n |\n| Third place\n | 1\n | $27\n | $27\n |\n| Fourth place\n | 1\n | $25\n | $25\n |\n| 5th\u20138th place (quarter-finals)\n | 4\n | $17\n | $68\n |\n| 9th\u201316th place (round of 16)\n | 8\n | $13\n | $104\n |\n| 17th\u201332nd place (group stage)\n | 16\n | $9\n | $144\n |\n| Total\n | 32\n | $440\n |\n\n\n### Rule changes[edit]\n\n\nThe tournament featured new substitution rules whereby teams could make up to five substitutions in normal time, and an additional substitution in extra time.[36][37][38] In addition, it was the first World Cup to feature concussion substitutions, whereby each team was permitted to use a maximum of one concussion substitute during a match. A concussion substitution did not count towards a team's quota of regular substitutions.[39] Iranian goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand suffered a concussion in his country's opening match against England and was replaced by Hossein Hosseini. This was the first use of a dedicated concussion substitute during a World Cup.[40]\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids and Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid\n\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups began in January 2009. National associations had until 2 February 2009 to register interest.[41] Initially, 11 bids were made for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico withdrew from proceedings,[42][43] and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian Football Association failed to submit a letter of Indonesian government guarantee to support the bid.[44]\n\n\nAfter UEFA were guaranteed to host the 2018 event, members of UEFA were no longer in contention to host in 2022.[45] There were five bids remaining for the 2022 FIFA World Cup: Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the United States.\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.[46] Two FIFA executive committee members were suspended before the vote in relation to allegations of corruption regarding their votes.[47] The decision to host the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which was graded as having \"high operational risk\",[48] generated criticism from media commentators.[49] It was criticised by many as being part of the FIFA corruption scandals,[50] which led to the 2015 FIFA corruption case.\n\n\nThe voting patterns were as follows:[51]\n\n\n\n\n\n2022 FIFA bidding (majority 12 votes)\n| Bidders\n | Votes\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Round 1\n | Round 2\n | Round 3\n | Round 4\n |\n| **Qatar** | 11\n | 10\n | 11\n | 14\n |\n| United States\n | 3\n | 5\n | 6\n | 8\n |\n| South Korea\n | 4\n | 5\n | 5\n | Eliminated\n |\n| Japan\n | 3\n | 2\n | Eliminated\n |\n| Australia\n | 1\n | Eliminated\n |\n\n\n### Cost of hosting the tournament[edit]\n\n\nAt an estimated cost of over $220\u00a0billion,[52] it is the most expensive World Cup ever held to date; this figure is disputed by Qatari officials, including organising CEO Nasser Al Khater, who said the true cost was $8\u00a0billion, and other figures related to overall infrastructure development since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in 2010.[53]\n\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of football stadiums in Qatar\n\n![](image)Six of the eight venues, such as the venue for the final, Lusail Stadium, were new stadiums built specifically for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nThe first five proposed venues for the World Cup were unveiled at the beginning of March 2010. Qatar intended that the stadiums should reflect its history and culture, and for the designs to meet the following terms of reference: legacy, comfort, accessibility, and sustainability.[54] The stadiums were equipped with cooling systems that aim to reduce temperatures within the stadium by up to 20\u00a0\u00b0C (36\u00a0\u00b0F).[55][56]\n\n\nTheir marketing included statements describing the stadiums as zero waste, and the upper tiers of the stadiums will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure.[55][56] Qatar aspired to be compliant and certified by the Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) for all the World Cup stadiums. All of the five stadium projects launched were designed by German architect Albert Speer & Partners.[57] The Al Bayt and Al Wakrah stadiums were the only indoor stadiums of the eight used.[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)Some venues, such as the 68,000-seat Al Bayt Stadium, had its upper tier of seating removed to reduce capacity after the tournament.\nIn an April 2013 report by Merrill Lynch, the organisers in Qatar requested that FIFA approve a smaller number of stadiums due to the growing costs.[59] Bloomberg said that Qatar wished to cut the number of venues to eight or nine from the twelve originally planned.[60] By April 2017, FIFA had yet to finalise the number of stadiums Qatar must have readied in five years' time. Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC) said it expected there would be eight in and near Doha, with the exception of Al Khor.[61][62]\n\n\nStadium 974, formerly known as the Ras Abu Aboud Stadium, was the seventh FIFA World Cup 2022 venue to be completed by the SC. Its name comes from the number of shipping containers used in its construction and Qatar's international dialling code. The venue will be dismantled completely after the tournament\u2014this stadium was the first temporary stadium ever used for a FIFA World Cup.[63] All of the other stadiums used except Khalifa International were reduced in capacity by half.[64]\n\n\n\n### Stadiums[edit]\n\n\n![Map](image)![About OpenStreetMaps](image)\n![Maps: terms of use](image)\n![](image)\n15km  \n10miles\n8\n![Al Janoub Stadium](image)\n7\n![Stadium 974](image)\n6\n![Al Thumama Stadium](image)\n5\n![Khalifa International Stadium](image)\n4\n![Education City Stadium](image)\n3\n![Ahmad bin Ali Stadium](image)\n\n2\n![Lusail Stadium](image)\n\n1\n![Al Bayt Stadium](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nVenues of the 2022 FIFA World Cup  \n1\n Al Bayt Stadium  \n2\n Lusail Stadium  \n3\n Ahmad bin Ali Stadium  \n4\n Education City Stadium  \n5\n Khalifa International Stadium  \n6\n Al Thumama Stadium  \n7\n Stadium 974  \n8\n Al Janoub Stadium\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Qatar |\n| --- |\n| City\n | Stadium\n | Capacity\n |\n| Al Khor | Al Bayt Stadium | 68,895[65][66][E] |\n| Lusail | Lusail Stadium | 88,966[67][68][F] |\n| Al Rayyan | Ahmad bin Ali Stadium | 45,032[69][70][G] |\n| Education City Stadium | 44,667[71][72][H] |\n| Khalifa International Stadium | 45,857[73][74][I] |\n| Doha | Al Thumama Stadium | 44,400[75][76][J] |\n| Stadium 974 | 44,089[77][78][K] |\n| Al Wakrah | Al Janoub Stadium | 44,325[79][80][L] |\n\n\n**Team base camps** \n\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. In July 2022, FIFA announced the hotels and training sites for each participating team.[81][82] This World Cup was the most compact since the inaugural edition in 1930, with 24 of the 32 teams being within a 10 km radius of each other, and are concentrated within the Doha area. It was the first Cup since 1930 in which players did not need to take flights to matches and could remain at the same training base throughout the entire tournament.[83][84]\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam base camps[83][84]\n| Team\n | Hotel\n | Training site\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Argentina | Qatar University Hostel 1\n | Qatar University Training Site 3\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Australia | New Aspire Academy Athlete Accommodation\n | Aspire Zone Training Facilities 5\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | Hilton Salwa Beach Resort and Villas\n | Salwa Training Site\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | The Westin Doha Hotel and Spa\n | Al Arabi SC Stadium |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Cameroon | Banyan Tree Doha at La Cigale Mushaireb\n | Al Sailiya SC Stadium |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Canada | Century Marina Hotel Lusail | Umm Salal SC Training Facilities\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Costa Rica | dusitD2 Salwa Doha\n | Al Ahli SC Stadium |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Croatia | Hilton Doha\n | Al Ersal Training Site 3\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Denmark | Retaj Salwa Resort & SPA\n | Al Sailiya SC 2\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Ecuador | Hyatt Regency Oryx Doha\n | Mesaimeer SC Training Facilities\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0England | Souq Al Wakra Hotel Qatar by Tivoli | Al Wakrah SC Stadium |\n| ![](image)\u00a0France | Al Messila \u2013 A Luxury Collection Resort & Spa, Doha\n | Al Sadd SC Stadium |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Germany | Zulal Wellness Resort\n | Al Shamal SC Stadium |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Ghana | DoubleTree by Hilton Doha \u2013 Al Sadd\n | Aspire Zone Training Facilities 1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Iran | Al Rayyan Hotel Doha Curio Collection by Hilton\n | Al Rayyan SC Training Facilities 1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Japan | Radisson Blu Hotel Doha\n | Al Sadd SC New Training Facilities 1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Mexico | Simaisma, A Murwab Resort\n | Al Khor SC Stadium |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Morocco | Wyndham Doha West Bay\n | Al Duhail SC Stadium |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | The St. Regis Doha\n | Qatar University Training Site 6\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Poland | Ezdan Palace Hotel\n | Al Kharaitiyat SC Training Facilities\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | Al Samriya Autograph Collection Hotel\n | Al Shahaniya SC Training Facilities\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Qatar | Al Aziziyah Boutique Hotel\n | Aspire Zone Training Facilities 3\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia | Sealine Beach, a Murwab Resort\n | Sealine Training Site\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Senegal | Duhail Handball Sports Hall | Al Duhail SC 2\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Serbia | Rixos Gulf Hotel Doha\n | Al Arabi SC Training Facilities\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | Le M\u00e9ridien City Center Doha\n | Al Egla Training Site 5\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Spain | Qatar University Hostel 2\n | Qatar University Training Site 1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland | Le Royal M\u00e9ridien, Doha\n | University of Doha for Science and Technology Training Facilities\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Tunisia | Wyndham Grand Doha West Bay Beach\n | Al Egla Training Sites 3\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0United States | Marsa Malaz Kempinski, The Pearl \u2013 Doha\n | Al Gharafa SC Stadium\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Uruguay | Pullman Doha West Bay\n | Al Ersal Training Site 1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Wales | Delta Hotels City Center Doha\n | Al Sadd SC New Training Facilities 2\n |\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nThe Qatari government employed about 50,000 security personnel including police departments and military forces from at least thirteen countries, including Poland, Germany, France, Kuwait, Jordan, Italy, Palestine, Spain, Pakistan, Turkey, USA, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom.[85] The Turkish government provided about 3,000 riot police personnel,[85] whilst Pakistan provided about 4,500 Army troops to Qatar for the event.[86]\n\n\n\n## Teams[edit]\n\n\n### Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\nFIFA's six continental confederations organised their own qualifying competitions. All 211 FIFA member associations were eligible to enter qualification. The Qatari national team, as hosts, qualified automatically for the tournament. However, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) obliged Qatar to participate in the Asian qualifying stage as the first two rounds also act as qualification for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.[87] Since Qatar reached the final stage as winners in their group, Lebanon, the fifth-best second place team, advanced instead.[88] France, the reigning World Cup champions, qualified for the event through European qualification.[89]\n\n\nSaint Lucia initially entered CONCACAF qualification but withdrew from it before their first match. North Korea withdrew from the AFC qualifying round due to safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both American Samoa and Samoa withdrew before the OFC qualification draw due to travel restrictions following the pandemic.[90] Tonga withdrew after the 2022 Hunga Tonga\u2013Hunga Ha'apai eruption and tsunami.[91] Due to COVID-19 outbreaks in their squads, Vanuatu and Cook Islands also withdrew because of the travel restrictions.[92][93]\n\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, 24 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2018.[94] Qatar were the only team making their debut in the FIFA World Cup, becoming the first hosts to make their tournament debut since Italy in 1934. The Netherlands, Ecuador, Ghana, Cameroon, and the United States returned to the tournament after missing the 2018 tournament. Canada returned after 36 years, their only prior appearance being in 1986.[95] Wales made their first appearance in 64 years\u2014the longest-ever gap for any team, their only previous participation having been in 1958.[96]\n\n\nItaly, four-time winners and reigning European champions, failed to qualify for a second successive World Cup for the first time in their history, losing in the qualification play-off semi-finals.[97] The Italians were the only former champions and the highest ranked team in the FIFA Men's World Rankings that failed to qualify. Italy were also the fourth team to have failed to qualify for the upcoming World Cup after having won the previous UEFA European Championship, following Czechoslovakia in 1978, Denmark in 1994, and Greece in 2006.[98] The previous World Cup hosts, Russia, were disqualified from competing due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[99]\n\n\nChile, the 2015 and 2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica winners, failed to qualify for the second consecutive time. Nigeria were defeated by Ghana on away goals in Confederation of African Football (CAF) final playoff round, having qualified for the previous three World Cups and six out of the last seven. Egypt, Panama, Colombia, Peru, Iceland, and Sweden, all of whom qualified for the 2018 World Cup, did not qualify for the 2022 tournament.[100] Ghana were the lowest ranked team to qualify, ranked 61st.[101]\n\n\nThe qualified teams, listed by region, with numbers in parentheses indicating final positions in the FIFA Men's World Ranking before the tournament were:[102]\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **AFC** (6)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Australia (38)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Iran (20)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Japan (24)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Qatar (50) (hosts)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia (51)\n* ![](image)\u00a0South Korea (28)\n\n**CAF** (5)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Cameroon (43)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Ghana (61)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Morocco (22)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Senegal (18)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Tunisia (30)\n | **CONCACAF** (4)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Canada (41)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Costa Rica (31)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Mexico (13)\n* ![](image)\u00a0United States (16)\n\n**CONMEBOL** (4)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Argentina (3)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Brazil (1)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Ecuador (44)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Uruguay (14)\n\n**OFC** (0)\n* *None qualified*\n | **UEFA** (13)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Belgium (2)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Croatia (12)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Denmark (10)\n* ![](image)\u00a0England (5)\n* ![](image)\u00a0France (4)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Germany (11)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands (8)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Poland (26)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Portugal (9)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Serbia (21)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Spain (7)\n* ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland (15)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Wales (19)\n | ![](image)Team qualified\n Team failed to qualify\n Team withdrew or suspended\n Not a FIFA member\n\n\n |\n\n### Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 FIFA World Cup squads\n\nBefore submitting their final squad for the tournament, teams named a provisional squad of up to 55 players. Teams were required to have their 55-player roster submitted to FIFA by 21 October.[103] Teams were required to name their final squads by 13 November.[104] In August 2022, FIFA increased the final squad size to 26 players from a total of 23 players at the 2018 edition.[105] All teams had a total of 26 players in their final squads except for France and Iran, who chose 25 players.[106][107]\n\n\n\n### Draw[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 FIFA World Cup seeding\n\nThe final draw was held at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center in Doha, Qatar,[108] on 1 April 2022,[109] 19:00 AST, prior to the completion of qualification. The two winners of the inter-confederation play-offs and the winner of the Path A of the UEFA play-offs were not known at the time of the draw.[110] The draw was attended by 2,000 guests and was led by Carli Lloyd, Jermaine Jenas and sports broadcaster Samantha Johnson, assisted by the likes of Cafu (Brazil), Lothar Matth\u00e4us (Germany), Adel Ahmed Malalla (Qatar), Ali Daei (Iran), Bora Milutinovi\u0107 (Serbia/Mexico), Jay-Jay Okocha (Nigeria), Rabah Madjer (Algeria), and Tim Cahill (Australia).[111][112]\n\n\nFor the draw, 32 teams were allocated into four pots based on the FIFA Men's World Rankings of 31 March 2022.[113] Pot 1 contained host Qatar (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams. Pot 2 contained the next best eight teams, with the next best eight teams into pot 3. Pot 4 contained the five lowest-ranked teams, along with the placeholders for the two inter-confederation play-off winners and the UEFA Path A play-off winner. Teams from the same confederation could not be drawn into the same group except for UEFA teams, for which there was at least one and no more than two per group.[114]\n\n\nThis principle also applied to the placeholder teams, with constraints applying based on the confederation of both potential winners of each play-off tie. The draw started with pot 1 and ended with pot 4, with each team selected then allocated into the first available group alphabetically. The position for the team within the group would then be drawn (for the purpose of the match schedule), with the pot 1 teams automatically drawn into position 1 of each group.[114] The pots for the draw are shown below.[115]\n\n\n\n\n\nDraw[116]\n| Pot 1\n | Pot 2\n | Pot 3\n | Pot 4\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Qatar (51) *(hosts)*![](image)\u00a0Brazil (1)![](image)\u00a0Belgium (2)![](image)\u00a0France (3)![](image)\u00a0Argentina (4)![](image)\u00a0England (5)![](image)\u00a0Spain (7)![](image)\u00a0Portugal (8)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Mexico (9)![](image)\u00a0Netherlands (10)![](image)\u00a0Denmark (11)![](image)\u00a0Germany (12)![](image)\u00a0Uruguay (13)![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland (14)![](image)\u00a0United States (15)![](image)\u00a0Croatia (16)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Senegal (20)![](image)\u00a0Iran (21)![](image)\u00a0Japan (23)![](image)\u00a0Morocco (24)![](image)\u00a0Serbia (25)![](image)\u00a0Poland (26)![](image)\u00a0South Korea (29)![](image)\u00a0Tunisia (35)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Cameroon (37)![](image)\u00a0Canada (38)![](image)\u00a0Ecuador (46)![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia (49)![](image)\u00a0Ghana (61)![](image)\u00a0Wales (18)\u200a[M]![](image)\u00a0Costa Rica (31)\u200a[N]![](image)\u00a0Australia (42)\u200a[O] |\n\n\n## Officiating[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 FIFA World Cup officials\n\nIn May 2022, FIFA announced the list of 36 referees, 69 assistant referees, and 24 video assistant referees for the tournament. Of the 36 referees, FIFA included two each from Argentina, Brazil, England, and France.[117][118]\n\n\nFor the first time women referees officiated games at a major men's tournament.[119] France's St\u00e9phanie Frappart, Salima Mukansanga from Rwanda, and Yoshimi Yamashita from Japan became the first female referees to be appointed to a men's World Cup.[120] Frappart previously oversaw the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup Final.[121] They were joined by three female assistant referees, Neuza Back, Kathryn Nesbitt, and Karen D\u00edaz Medina. Frappart then officially became the first-ever female referee to officiate a World Cup match when she worked the Costa Rica vs Germany match in Group E on 1 December.[122]\n\n\nGambian referee Bakary Gassama and Argentine assistant referee Juan Pablo Belatti were among the officials to serve at their third World Cup. Belatti was an assistant referee in the 2018 final.[123][124][125] Other returning officials included referees C\u00e9sar Arturo Ramos of Mexico and Janny Sikazwe of Zambia, and Iranian assistant referee Mohammadreza Mansouri.[126][127][128]\n\n\nOn 15 December 2022, FIFA announced that Polish referee Szymon Marciniak would adjudicate the final.[129]\n\n\n\n## Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on Sunday, 20 November 2022 at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor, prior to the opening match of the tournament between hosts Qatar and Ecuador.[130] It included appearances by Morgan Freeman and Ghanim Al-Muftah, along with performances by South Korean singer and BTS member Jungkook and Qatari singer Fahad Al Kubaisi.[131][132] It was the first time that the Qur'an had been recited as part of the opening ceremony.[133]\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\nAll times are local, AST (UTC+3).\n\nThe group stage was played from 20 November to 2 December.[134] Competing countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H). Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, where the top two teams advanced to the knockout stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  Tie-breaking criteria for group play\n |\n| --- |\n| The ranking of teams in the group stage was determined as follows:[135]1. Points obtained in all group matches;\n2. Goal difference in all group matches;\n3. Number of goals scored in all group matches;\n4. Points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;\n5. Goal difference in the matches played between the teams in question;\n6. Number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;\n7. Fair play points in all group matches (only one deduction could be applied to a player in a single match): * Yellow card: \u22121 points;\n\t* Indirect red card (second yellow card): \u22123 points;\n\t* Direct red card: \u22124 points;\n\t* Yellow card and direct red card: \u22125 points;\n8. Drawing of lots.\n |\n|  |\n\n\n![](image)Result of countries participating in the 2022 FIFA World Cup\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 FIFA World Cup Group A\n\nThe first match of the tournament was held between Qatar and Ecuador in Group A. Ecuador had a disallowed goal in the opening minutes,[136] but eventually won 2\u20130 with two goals from Enner Valencia.[137] Qatar became the first host nation to lose their opening match at a World Cup.[138][139][140] Many Qatar natives were seen leaving the game before the end, with ESPN reporting that two-thirds of the attendance had left.[141][142] The other starting match in group A was won by the Netherlands 2\u20130 over Senegal. Cody Gakpo scored the opening goal in the 84th minute and Davy Klaassen added a second in stoppage time.[143] Senegal faced Qatar in the third match of the group; Boulaye Dia capitalised on a slip by Boualem Khoukhi to put Senegal 1\u20130 ahead. Famara Di\u00e9dhiou scored a second with a header, before Mohammed Muntari scored Qatar's first-ever goal at a World Cup to reduce the deficit back to one. Senegal eventually won the match 3\u20131 after an 84th-minute goal by Bamba Dieng. With this result, Qatar became the first team to be eliminated from the tournament, as well as becoming the first host nation to ever be knocked out of the tournament after two games.[144] Gakpo scored his second goal of the tournament as the Netherlands led Ecuador; however, Valencia scored an equaliser in the 49th minute.[145] The Netherlands won 2\u20130 against Qatar following goals by Gakpo and Frenkie de Jong to win the group, while Qatar attained the distinction of being the first home nation to lose all three group matches.[146] Senegal faced Ecuador to determine the second knockout round qualifier. At the end of the first half, Isma\u00efla Sarr scored a penalty kick to put Senegal ahead. In the 67th minute, Mois\u00e9s Caicedo scored an equaliser, but shortly after, Kalidou Koulibaly gave Senegal the victory. The win was enough to qualify Senegal as the runners-up of Group A.[147]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 5\n | 1\n | +4\n | 7\n | Advanced to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0Senegal | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 5\n | 4\n | +1\n | 6\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Ecuador | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 4\n | 3\n | +1\n | 4\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0Qatar (H) | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n | 1\n | 7\n | \u22126\n | 0\n |\n\nSource: FIFA  \n(H) Hosts\n\n20\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-20)\n19:00\n\n\n| Qatar\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0Ecuador |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Valencia ![](image) 16'\u00a0(pen.), 31'\n |\n\nAl Bayt Stadium, Al Khor\nAttendance: 67,372\nReferee: Daniele Orsato (Italy)\n\n21\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-21)\n19:00\n\n\n| Senegal\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Gakpo ![](image) 84'\n* Klaassen ![](image) 90+9'\n |\n\nAl Thumama Stadium, Doha\nAttendance: 41,721\nReferee: Wilton Sampaio (Brazil)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n25\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-25)\n16:00\n\n\n| Qatar\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20133 | ![](image)\u00a0Senegal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Muntari ![](image) 78'\n | Report | * Dia ![](image) 41'\n* Di\u00e9dhiou ![](image) 48'\n* B.

France, however, scored four goals, by Adrien Rabiot, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and two by Olivier Giroud to win 4\u20131.[165] The goals tied Giroud with Thierry Henry as France's all-time top goalscorer.[165] Mitchell Duke scored the only goal as Australia won against Tunisia. This was their first World Cup win since 2010.[166][167] Mbapp\u00e9 scored a brace as France defeated Denmark 2\u20131. This was enough for France to qualify for the knockout round\u2014the first time since Brazil in 2006 that the defending champions progressed through the opening round.[166][168] Mathew Leckie scored the only goal as Australia defeated Denmark 1\u20130, qualifying for the knockout round as runners-up with the win.[169] Wahbi Khazri scored for Tunisia against France in the 58th minute. Although Antoine Griezmann equalised in stoppage time it was overturned for offside. Tunisia finished third in the group, as they required a draw in the Denmark and Australia game.[170]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0France | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 6\n | 3\n | +3\n | 6\n | Advanced to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0Australia | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 3\n | 4\n | \u22121\n | 6\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Tunisia | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 0\n | 4\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0Denmark | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1\n | 3\n | \u22122\n | 1\n |\n\nSource: FIFA\n\n22\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-22)\n16:00\n\n\n| Denmark\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Tunisia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nEducation City Stadium, Al Rayyan\nAttendance: 42,925\nReferee: C\u00e9sar Arturo Ramos (Mexico)\n\n22\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-22)\n22:00\n\n\n| France\u00a0![](image) | 4\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Australia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Rabiot ![](image) 27'\n* Giroud ![](image) 32', 71'\n* Mbapp\u00e9 ![](image) 68'\n | Report | * Goodwin ![](image) 9'\n |\n\nAl Janoub Stadium, Al Wakrah\nAttendance: 40,875\nReferee: Victor Gomes (South Africa)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n26\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-26)\n13:00\n\n\n| Tunisia\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Australia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Duke ![](image) 23'\n |\n\nAl Janoub Stadium, Al Wakrah\nAttendance: 41,823\nReferee: Daniel Siebert (Germany)\n\n26\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-26)\n19:00\n\n\n| France\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Denmark |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Mbapp\u00e9 ![](image) 61', 86'\n | Report | * A.

After an early penalty kick was converted by Germany's \u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan, Japan scored two second-half goals by Ritsu D\u014dan and Takuma Asano in a 2\u20131 win.[171] In the second group match, Spain defeated Costa Rica 7\u20130. First-half goals by Dani Olmo, Marco Asensio, and Ferran Torres were followed by goals by Gavi, Carlos Soler, Alvaro Morata, and a second by Torres.[172][173] This was the largest defeat in a World Cup since Portugal's victory over North Korea in the 2010 event by the same scoreline.[174] Costa Rica defeated Japan 1\u20130, with Keysher Fuller scoring with Costa Rica's first shot on target of the tournament.[175] Germany and Spain drew 1\u20131, with \u00c1lvaro Morata scoring for Spain and Niclas F\u00fcllkrug scoring for Germany.[176][177][178] Morata scored the opening goal for Spain against Japan as they controlled the first half of the match.[179] Japan equalised on Ritsu Doan before a second goal by Ao Tanaka was heavily investigated by VAR for the ball potentially being out of play. The goal was awarded, and Japan won the group following a 2\u20131 win.[179] Serge Gnabry scored on ten minutes for Germany against Costa Rica and they led until half-time. Germany required a win, and for Japan to not win their match, or for both teams to win their matches by a combined goal difference of at least 9 goals, to qualify. In the second half, goals by Yeltsin Tejeda and Juan Vargas gave Costa Rica a 2\u20131 lead, which would have qualified them into the knockout stages ahead of Spain. Germany scored three further goals\u2014two by Kai Havertz and a goal by Niclas Fullkrug, ending in a 4\u20132 win for Germany\u2014which was not enough to qualify them for the final stages. This was the second time in a row that the four-time champions failed to progress past the group stages.[180] Japan won the group ahead of Spain.[181]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 4\n | 3\n | +1\n | 6\n | Advanced to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 9\n | 3\n | +6\n | 4\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 6\n | 5\n | +1\n | 4\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0Costa Rica | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 3\n | 11\n | \u22128\n | 3\n |\n\nSource: FIFA\n\n23\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-23)\n16:00\n\n\n| Germany\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0Japan |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * G\u00fcndo\u011fan ![](image) 33'\u00a0(pen.)\n | Report | * D\u014dan ![](image) 75'\n* Asano ![](image) 83'\n |\n\nKhalifa International Stadium, Al Rayyan\nAttendance: 42,608\nReferee: Iv\u00e1n Barton (El Salvador)\n\n23\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-23)\n19:00\n\n\n| Spain\u00a0![](image) | 7\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Costa Rica |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Olmo ![](image) 11'\n* Asensio ![](image) 21'\n* F.

Belgium won the match by a single goal by Michy Batshuayi.[183][184] Belgium lost 2\u20130 to Morocco, despite Morocco having a long-range direct free kick goal by Hakim Ziyech overturned for an offside on another player in the lead up to the goal. Two second-half goals from Zakaria Aboukhlal and Romain Sa\u00efss helped the Morocco win their first World Cup match since 1998.[185][186] The match sparked riots in Belgium, with fires and fireworks being set off by residents.[187] Alphonso Davies scored Canada's first World Cup goal to give Canada the lead over Croatia. Goals by Marko Livaja, Lovro Majer, and two by Andrej Kramari\u0107 for Croatia completed a 4\u20131 victory.[188] Morocco scored two early goals through Hakim Ziyech and Youssef En-Nesyri in their game against Canada and qualified following a 2\u20131 victory. Canada's only goal was an own goal by Nayef Aguerd.[189] Croatia and Belgium played a goalless draw which eliminated Belgium, whose team was ranked second in the world, from the tournament.[190]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0Morocco | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 4\n | 1\n | +3\n | 7\n | Advanced to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0Croatia | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n | 0\n | 4\n | 1\n | +3\n | 5\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n | \u22121\n | 4\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n | 2\n | 7\n | \u22125\n | 0\n |\n\nSource: FIFA\n\n23\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-23)\n13:00\n\n\n| Morocco\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Croatia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nAl Bayt Stadium, Al Khor\nAttendance: 59,407\nReferee: Fernando Rapallini (Argentina)\n\n23\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-23)\n22:00\n\n\n| Belgium\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Canada |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Batshuayi ![](image) 44'\n | Report |  |\n\nAhmad bin Ali Stadium, Al Rayyan\nAttendance: 40,432\nReferee: Janny Sikazwe (Zambia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n27\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-27)\n16:00\n\n\n| Belgium\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0Morocco |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Sa\u00efss ![](image) 73'\n* Aboukhlal ![](image) 90+2'\n |\n\nAl Thumama Stadium, Doha\nAttendance: 43,738\nReferee: C\u00e9sar Arturo Ramos (Mexico)\n\n27\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-27)\n19:00\n\n\n| Croatia\u00a0![](image) | 4\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Canada |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Kramari\u0107 ![](image) 36', 70'\n* Livaja ![](image) 44'\n* Majer ![](image) 90+4'\n | Report | * Davies ![](image) 2'\n |\n\nKhalifa International Stadium, Al Rayyan\nAttendance: 44,374\nReferee: Andr\u00e9s Matonte (Uruguay)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-01)\n18:00\n\n\n| Croatia\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nAhmad bin Ali Stadium, Al Rayyan\nAttendance: 43,984\nReferee: Anthony Taylor (England)\n\n1\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-01)\n18:00\n\n\n| Canada\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0Morocco |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Aguerd ![](image) 40'\u00a0(o.g.)\n | Report | * Ziyech ![](image) 4'\n* En-Nesyri ![](image) 23'\n |\n\nAl Thumama Stadium, Doha\nAttendance: 43,102\nReferee: Raphael Claus (Brazil)\n\n### Group G[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 FIFA World Cup Group G\n\nBreel Embolo scored the only goal in Switzerland's 1\u20130 defeat of Cameroon.[191] Richarlison scored two goals as Brazil won against Serbia, with star player Neymar receiving an ankle injury.[192] Cameroon's Jean-Charles Castelletto scored the opening goal against Serbia, but they were quickly behind as Serbia scored three goals by Strahinja Pavlovi\u0107, Sergej Milinkovi\u0107-Savi\u0107, and Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107 either side of half time. Cameroon, however, scored goals through Vincent Aboubakar and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, completing a 3\u20133 draw.[193] An 83rd-minute winner by Casemiro for Brazil over Switzerland was enough for them to qualify for the knockout stage.[194] Having already qualified, Brazil were unable to win their final group game, as they were defeated by Cameroon 1\u20130 following a goal by Vincent Aboubakar. Already having a yellow card, he was later sent off for removing his shirt in celebrating the goal.[195] Cameroon, however, did not qualify, as Switzerland defeated Serbia 3\u20132.[196]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 3\n | 1\n | +2\n | 6\n | Advanced to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 4\n | 3\n | +1\n | 6\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Cameroon | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 4\n | 4\n | 0\n | 4\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0Serbia | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 5\n | 8\n | \u22123\n | 1\n |\n\nSource: FIFA\n\n24\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-24)\n13:00\n\n\n| Switzerland\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Cameroon |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Embolo ![](image) 48'\n | Report |  |\n\nAl Janoub Stadium, Al Wakrah\nAttendance: 39,089\nReferee: Facundo Tello (Argentina)\n\n24\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-24)\n22:00\n\n\n| Brazil\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Serbia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Richarlison ![](image) 62', 73'\n | Report |  |\n\nLusail Stadium, Lusail\nAttendance: 88,103\nReferee: Alireza Faghani (Iran)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n28\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-28)\n13:00\n\n\n| Cameroon\u00a0![](image) | 3\u20133 | ![](image)\u00a0Serbia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Castelletto ![](image) 29'\n* Aboubakar ![](image) 63'\n* Choupo-Moting ![](image) 66'\n | Report | * Pavlovi\u0107 ![](image) 45+1'\n* S.

In scoring the goal, Ronaldo became the first man to score in five World Cups. Ghana responded with a goal by Andr\u00e9 Ayew before goals by Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix, and Rafael Le\u00e3o by Portugal put them 3\u20131 ahead. Osman Bukari scored in the 89th minute to trail by a single goal, while I\u00f1aki Williams had a chance to equalise for Ghana ten minutes into stoppage time, but slipped before shooting. The match finished 3\u20132 to Portugal.[198] Ghanaian Mohammed Salisu opened the scoring against South Korea, with Mohammed Kudus following it up. In the second half, Cho Gue-sung scored a brace for South Korea, levelling the score. Mohammed Kudus scored again in the 68th minute, winning the match 3\u20132 for Ghana.[199] Portugal defeated Uruguay 2\u20130 with two goals from Bruno Fernandes, advancing them to the knockout stage.[200] A controversial penalty decision was called late in the game, with a suspected handball from Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez.[201][202] Portugal led South Korea through Ricardo Horta after 10 minutes. However, goals by Kim Young-gwon and Hwang Hee-chan won the match 2\u20131 for South Korea.[203] Giorgian de Arrascaeta scored two goals as Uruguay defeated Ghana 2\u20130.[204] However, with South Korea winning, Uruguay required another goal to progress as they finished third on goals scored.[205] Several Uruguay players left the pitch after the game surrounding the referees and followed them off the pitch.[206][207][208]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 6\n | 4\n | +2\n | 6\n | Advanced to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 4\n | 4\n | 0\n | 4\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Uruguay | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 0\n | 4\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0Ghana | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 5\n | 7\n | \u22122\n | 3\n |\n\nSource: FIFA\n\n24\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-24)\n16:00\n\n\n| Uruguay\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nEducation City Stadium, Al Rayyan\nAttendance: 41,663\nReferee: Cl\u00e9ment Turpin (France)\n\n24\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-24)\n19:00\n\n\n| Portugal\u00a0![](image) | 3\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0Ghana |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Ronaldo ![](image) 65'\u00a0(pen.)\n* F\u00e9lix ![](image) 78'\n* Le\u00e3o ![](image) 80'\n | Report | * A.

Neither team could find the winner, with Croatia defeating Japan 3\u20131 in a penalty shoot-out.[214] Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Neymar, Richarlison, and Lucas Paquet\u00e1 all scored for Brazil, but a volley from South Korean Paik Seung-ho reduced the deficit to 4\u20131.[215] Pablo Sarabia had the best chance for Spain to break the deadlock against Morocco in stoppage time after two goalless hours, but he hit the goalie's right-hand post after a shot from the left; Morocco won the match 3\u20130 on penalties.[216] A hat-trick by Gon\u00e7alo Ramos led Portugal to defeat Switzerland 6\u20131, with goals from Portugal's Pepe, Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro, and Rafael Le\u00e3o and from Switzerland's Manuel Akanji.[217]\n\n\n\n3\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-03)\n18:00\n\n\n| Netherlands\u00a0![](image) | 3\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0United States |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Depay ![](image) 10'\n* Blind ![](image) 45+1'\n* Dumfries ![](image) 81'\n | Report | * Wright ![](image) 76'\n |\n\nKhalifa International Stadium, Al Rayyan\nAttendance: 44,846\nReferee: Wilton Sampaio (Brazil)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n3\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-03)\n22:00\n\n\n| Argentina\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Australia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Messi ![](image) 35'\n* \u00c1lvarez ![](image) 57'\n | Report | * Fern\u00e1ndez ![](image) 77'\u00a0(o.g.)\n |\n\nAhmad bin Ali Stadium, Al Rayyan\nAttendance: 45,032\nReferee: Szymon Marciniak (Poland)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n4\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-04)\n18:00\n\n\n| France\u00a0![](image) | 3\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Poland |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Giroud ![](image) 44'\n* Mbapp\u00e9 ![](image) 74', 90+1'\n | Report | * Lewandowski ![](image) 90+9'\u00a0(pen.)\n |\n\nAl Thumama Stadium, Doha\nAttendance: 40,989\nReferee: Jes\u00fas Valenzuela (Venezuela)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n4\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-04)\n22:00\n\n\n| England\u00a0![](image) | 3\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Senegal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Henderson ![](image) 38'\n* Kane ![](image) 45+3'\n* Saka ![](image) 57'\n | Report |  |\n\nAl Bayt Stadium, Al Khor\nAttendance: 65,985\nReferee: Iv\u00e1n Barton (El Salvador)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n5\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-05)\n18:00\n\n\n| Japan\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20131 (a.e.t.) | ![](image)\u00a0Croatia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Maeda ![](image) 43'\n | Report | * Peri\u0161i\u0107 ![](image) 55'\n |\n| Penalties |\n| * Minamino ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Mitoma ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Asano ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Yoshida ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n | 1\u20133 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Vla\u0161i\u0107\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Brozovi\u0107\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Livaja\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Pa\u0161ali\u0107\n |\n\nAl Janoub Stadium, Al Wakrah\nAttendance: 42,523\nReferee: Ismail Elfath (United States)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n5\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-05)\n22:00\n\n\n| Brazil\u00a0![](image) | 4\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior ![](image) 7'\n* Neymar ![](image) 13'\u00a0(pen.)\n* Richarlison ![](image) 29'\n* Paquet\u00e1 ![](image) 36'\n | Report | * Paik Seung-ho ![](image) 76'\n |\n\nStadium 974, Doha\nAttendance: 43,847\nReferee: Cl\u00e9ment Turpin (France)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n6\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-06)\n18:00\n\n\n| Morocco\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20130 (a.e.t.) | ![](image)\u00a0Spain |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n| Penalties |\n| * Sabiri ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Ziyech ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Benoun ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Hakimi ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 3\u20130 | * ![soccer ball with red X](image) Sarabia\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Soler\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Busquets\n |\n\nEducation City Stadium, Al Rayyan\nAttendance: 44,667\nReferee: Fernando Rapallini (Argentina)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n6\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-06)\n22:00\n\n\n| Portugal\u00a0![](image) | 6\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Switzerland |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Ramos ![](image) 17', 51', 67'\n* Pepe ![](image) 33'\n* Guerreiro ![](image) 55'\n* Le\u00e3o ![](image) 90+2'\n | Report | * Akanji ![](image) 58'\n |\n\nLusail Stadium, Lusail\nAttendance: 83,720\nReferee: C\u00e9sar Arturo Ramos (Mexico)\n\n### Quarter-finals[edit]\n\n\nThe quarter-finals were played on 9 and 10 December.[32] Croatia and Brazil ended 0\u20130 after 90 minutes and went to extra time.

With the match tied, a penalty shootout decided the contest, with Croatia winning the shootout 4\u20132.[218][219] In the second quarter-final match, Nahuel Molina and Messi scored for Argentina before Wout Weghorst equalised with two goals shortly before the end of the game. The match went to extra time and then penalties, where Argentina would go on to win 4\u20133.[220] Morocco defeated Portugal 1\u20130, with Youssef En-Nesyri scoring at the end of the first half. Morocco became the first African and the first Arab nation to advance as far as the semi-finals of the competition.[221] Despite Harry Kane scoring a penalty for England, it was not enough to beat France, who won 2\u20131 by virtue of goals from Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni and Olivier Giroud and a late missed penalty by Kane, sending them to their second consecutive World Cup semi-final and becoming the first defending champions to reach this stage since Brazil in 1998.[222][223]\n\n\n\n9\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-09)\n18:00\n\n\n| Croatia\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20131 (a.e.t.) | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Petkovi\u0107 ![](image) 117'\n | Report | * Neymar ![](image) 105+1'\n |\n| Penalties |\n| * Vla\u0161i\u0107 ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Majer ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Modri\u0107 ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Or\u0161i\u0107 ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 4\u20132 | * ![soccer ball with red X](image) Rodrygo\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Casemiro\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Pedro\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Marquinhos\n |\n\nEducation City Stadium, Al Rayyan\nAttendance: 43,893\nReferee: Michael Oliver (England)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nMain article: Battle of Lusail\n\n9\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-09)\n22:00\n\n\n| Netherlands\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20132 (a.e.t.) | ![](image)\u00a0Argentina |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Weghorst ![](image) 83', 90+11'\n | Report | * Molina ![](image) 35'\n* Messi ![](image) 73'\u00a0(pen.)\n |\n| Penalties |\n| * Van Dijk ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Berghuis ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Koopmeiners ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Weghorst ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* L. de Jong ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 3\u20134 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Messi\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Paredes\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Montiel\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Fern\u00e1ndez\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) La.

Both teams had won the event twice previously.[228] Early goals from Lionel Messi and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda gave Argentina, leading 2\u20130, a head start against the French.[228][229] Despite substitutions in the first half, France did not record a shot until after the 70th minute but were energised by additional substitutions in the 71st. A few minutes later, France were awarded a penalty as Randal Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area by Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi. Mbapp\u00e9 scored the penalty and added a second goal less than two minutes later to equalise the scores.[229] With the score tied at two goals apiece, the match went to extra time. Messi scored his second goal in the 108th minute, once again giving Argentina the lead. However, Mbapp\u00e9 was awarded a second penalty in the 115th minute after his shot hit the arm of Gonzalo Montiel. Mbapp\u00e9 scored his third goal, becoming the second player ever to complete a hat-trick in the final of a World Cup after Geoff Hurst for England in 1966.[229] With the score tied at 3\u20133, the match was determined via a penalty shootout. Argentina won the final after scoring all of their penalties, winning 4\u20132.[229] This marked their third World Cup win and their first since 1986.[229]\n\n\n\n18\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-12-18)\n18:00\n\n\n| Argentina\u00a0![](image) | 3\u20133 (a.e.t.) | ![](image)\u00a0France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Messi ![](image)

becoming the first player to win it twice. France's Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 *(right)* won the Golden Boot award after scoring eight goals in the tournament, the most since Ronaldo in 2002.\n\nThe following World Cup awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament: the Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper).[236]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Golden Ball | Silver Ball\n | Bronze Ball\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Argentina](image) Lionel Messi | ![France](image) Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 | ![Croatia](image) Luka Modri\u0107 |\n| Golden Boot | Silver Boot\n | Bronze Boot\n |\n| ![France](image) Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 | ![Argentina](image) Lionel Messi | ![France](image) Olivier Giroud |\n| 8 goals, 2 assists\n | 7 goals, 3 assists\n | 4 goals, 0 assists\n |\n| Golden Glove |\n| ![Argentina](image) Emiliano Mart\u00ednez |\n| FIFA Young Player Award |\n| ![Argentina](image) Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez |\n| FIFA Fair Play Trophy |\n| ![](image)\u00a0England |\n\n\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 10 goals for users to vote on as the tournament's best. The award was won by Brazil's Richarlison for his second goal in the group stage match against Serbia.[237]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Branding[edit]\n\n\nThe official emblem was designed by Unlock Brands[238] and unveiled in September 2019, during simultaneous events at the Doha Tower, Katara Cultural Village amphitheatre, Msheireb Downtown Doha, and Zubarah. It was designed to resemble the tournament trophy, the infinity symbol, and the number \"8\", reflecting upon the \"interconnected\" event and the eight host stadiums. It also evoked imagery of shawls to signify the tournament's late fall scheduling, and contained waves resembling desert dunes. The typography of the emblem's wordmark incorporated kashida\u2014the practice of elongating certain parts of characters in Arabic script to provide typographical emphasis.[239][240][241]\n\n\nH.E Ambassador Dr. Hend Al-Muftah, Permanent Representative of the State of Qatar to the United Nations Office at Geneva, explained to WIPO Magazine that the tournament provided an opportunity to \"promote our culture and showcase our signature hospitality in a multicultural environment\", and highlighted that the country has used sports to demonstrate its \"commitment to sustainable development, social inclusion and the values of community and mutual respect among peoples from different cultures and nations.\"[242]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nSee also: FIFA World Cup video games\n\nElectronic Arts' licensed video games *FIFA Mobile* and *FIFA 23* (except on Nintendo Switch) received free updates with tie-in content for the 2022 World Cup on 8 and 9 November 2022, respectively. The update for *FIFA 23* added World Cup-themed tournament modes with all teams and two of the stadiums from the event, campaigns and World Cup-themed unlockable content for Ultimate Team mode, and real-time squad and fixture updates during the tournament.[243]\n\n\nOn 24 August 2022, the Panini Group produced themed stickers and a sticker album for a 14th consecutive World Cup. This year, rare cards with coloured borders were included and could be collected, traded, or sold.[244]\n\n\nOn 12 April 2022, FIFA released an over-the-top media service and app revolving around the World Cup called FIFA+, where fans could play games, predict matches, and compete with others.[245]\n\n\n\n### Broadcasting rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights\n\nIn May 2022, Infantino projected that the 2022 FIFA World Cup could be the most-watched in its history, with a global audience of at least 5\u00a0billion. The 2018 tournament was seen by 3.57\u00a0billion across the tournament.[246] The various controversies surrounding the World Cup in Qatar led to questions over how the tournament would be covered in the media, and whether they would be discussed or addressed during coverage.[247][248] The match between England and the United States in the group stage was seen by approximately 20 million viewers across both Fox and Telemundo, ranking among the highest-rated associated football broadcasts in the United States (behind a 2014 World Cup match that drew 24.7\u00a0million).[249][250]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| FIFA partners | FIFA World Cup sponsors | African and Middle Eastern supporters | Asian supporters | European supporters | North American supporters | South American supporters\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Adidas[251]\n* Coca-Cola[252]\n* Hyundai\u2013Kia[253]\n* Qatar Airways[254]\n* QatarEnergy[255]\n* Visa[256]\n* Wanda Group[257]\n | * Anheuser-Busch InBev[258]\n* Byju's[259]\n* Crypto.com[260]\n* Hisense[261]\n* McDonald's[262]\n* Mengniu Dairy[263]\n* Vivo[264]\n | * Fine Hygienic Holding[265]\n* GWC Logistics[266]\n* Ooredoo[267]\n* Saudi Tourism Authority\n* QNB Group[268]\n | * BOSS Zhipin[269]\n* Yadea[270]\n | * Betano[271]\n* Globant[272]\n* YouTube[273]\n | * Algorand[274]\n* Frito-Lay[275]\n* Look Company[276]\n* Visit Las Vegas[277]\n | * Claro[278]\n* Inter Rapid\u00edsimo[279]\n* Nubank[280]\n* UPL[281]\n |\n\n\n## Symbols[edit]\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nMain article: La'eeb\n\nThe tournament's official mascot was unveiled on 1 April 2022, during the group stage draw. Its name is La\u02bceeb (Arabic: \u0644\u0639\u064a\u0628, romanized:\u00a0*La\u02bf\u012bb*), which is an Arabic word meaning \"super-skilled player\". The official website of FIFA says: \"La\u02bceeb will be known for his youthful spirit; spreading joy and confidence everywhere he goes\", and the official backstory of the character, published there, claims that it comes from a parallel world where tournament mascots live, \"a world where ideas and creativity form the basis of characters that live in the minds of everyone\".[282]\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Al Rihla\n\n![](image)*The adidas Al Rihla*\nThe official match ball, \"Al Rihla\", was unveiled on 30 March 2022. It was mainly inspired by the culture, architecture, iconic boats and flag of Qatar. In Arabic, the word *Al-Rihla* (\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0651\u062d\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0629 *ar-ri\u1e25la*) means \"the journey\". The ball was designed with sustainability as a priority, making it the first-ever official match ball created with water-based glues and inks. As \"the game is getting faster\" and \"speeds up\", the Adidas ball has internal electronic sensors, allowing detection of its speed and position, updated 500 times per second[283] and it has to be charged before each game.[284] Two of the match balls were sent and returned from space by FIFA and Qatar Airways on a SpaceX falcon 9 suborbital mission for promoting the World Cup.[285]\n\n\nThe match ball for the 2022 FIFA World Cup Final was announced on 11 December 2022. It is a variation of the Al Rihla named the *Adidas Al Hilm* (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0644\u0645, romanized:\u00a0*al-\u1e25ulm*, lit.\u2009'the dream', a reference to \"every nation's dream of lifting the FIFA World Cup\").[286] Whilst the technical aspects of the ball are the same, the colour is different from the Al-Rihla balls used in the group stages and preceding knockout games, with a *Gold Metallic*, maroon, *Collegiate Burgundy*, and red design,[287] a reference to the national colors of host nation Qatar and the golden colors shared by the Final's venue and the FIFA World Cup Trophy.[288]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nSee also: FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Official Soundtrack and List of FIFA World Cup songs and anthems\n\nFor the first time, a multi-song FIFA World Cup official soundtrack has been released, instead of one official song.[289] The first song of the album is \"Hayya Hayya (Better Together)\", performed by Trinidad Cardona, Davido, and AISHA, released on 1 April 2022 along with the music video.[290] The second song is \"Arhbo\", performed by Gims and Ozuna, released on 19 August 2022 along with the music video.[291] The third song is \"The World Is Yours to Take\" performed by American rapper Lil Baby, released on 23 September 2022 along with a music video.[292] The fourth song is \"Light The Sky\" performed by Nora Fatehi, Manal, Rahma Riad, and Balqees, composed by RedOne and released on 7 October 2022 along with the music video.[293]\nA fifth song, \"Tukoh Taka\", performed by Nicki Minaj, Maluma and Myriam Fares, was released on 17 November 2022 along with the music video, serving as the official song of the FIFA Fan Festival.[294] The final song is \"Dreamers\" by Jungkook of BTS released on 20 November 2022. It was performed with Fahad Al-Kubaisi during the tournament's opening ceremony.[295][296]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies\n\nCriticism of the 2022 FIFA World Cup focused on Qatar's human-rights record,[297] namely their treatment of migrant workers,[297] women, and position on LGBT rights,[298] leading to allegations of sportswashing.[P] Others cited Qatar's climate, lack of a strong football culture, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption.[6][302] Boycotts of the event were declared by several countries, clubs, and individual players,[300][301] with former FIFA president Sepp Blatter twice stating that giving Qatar hosting rights was a \"mistake\".[303][304] The FIFA World Cup delivered record-breaking numbers of TV audiences across multiple markets.[305] In June 2023, Le Point revealed that FIFA World Cup has raised great interest in the country despite \"calls for a boycott\". According to the study by *Arcom*, six out of ten French people followed at least one match.[306]\n\n\n\n### Host selection criticism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Russian President Vladimir Putin handing over the symbolic relay baton for the hosting rights of the 2022 FIFA World Cup to Qatar's Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in June 2018\nThere have been allegations of bribery and corruption in the selection process involving FIFA's executive committee members.[307] These allegations are being investigated by FIFA (see \u00a7\u00a0Bidding corruption allegations, 2014, below). In May 2011, allegations of corruption within the FIFA senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup 2022 being held in Qatar. The accusations of corruption were made relating to how Qatar won the right to host the event. A FIFA internal investigation and report cleared Qatar of any violation, but chief investigator Michael J. Garcia described FIFA's report on his enquiry as containing \"numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations.\"[308]\n\n\nIn May 2015, Swiss federal prosecutors opened an investigation into corruption and money laundering related to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids.[309][310] In August 2018, former FIFA president Sepp Blatter claimed that Qatar had used \"black ops\", suggesting that the bid committee had cheated to win the hosting rights.[311] Some investigations found that Qatar sought an edge in securing hosting by hiring a former CIA officer turned private contractor, Kevin Chalker, to spy on rival bid teams and key football officials who picked the winner in 2010.[312]\n\n\nIn September 2018, a delegation from al-Ghufran tribe lodged a complaint to FIFA's president to reject the establishment of the World Cup in Qatar unless its government restored the Qatari nationality to all those affected from the tribe and returned land allegedly stolen from them to build the sport facilities.[313]\n\n\nQatar faced strong criticism for the treatment of foreign workers involved in preparation for the World Cup, with Amnesty International referring to \"forced labour\" and poor working conditions,[314][315] while many migrant workers reported having to pay large \"recruitment fees\" to obtain employment.[316] *The Guardian* newspaper reported that many workers were denied food and water, had their identity papers taken away from them, and that they were not paid on time or at all, making some of them in effect slaves. *The Guardian* estimated that up to 4,000 workers could die from lax safety and other causes by the time the competition was held. Between 2015 and 2021, the Qatari government adopted new labour reforms to improve working conditions, including a minimum wage for all workers and the removal of the kafala system. Furthermore, in November 2017, the International Labour Organization concluded that no rights were violated and made the decision to close the complaint against Qatar regarding the alleged violation of migrant workers' rights.[317] According to Amnesty International, however, living and working conditions of the foreign workers did not improve in the last years.[318]\n\n\nQatar was the smallest nation by area ever to have been awarded a FIFA World Cup\u00a0\u2013 the next smallest by area was Switzerland, host of the 1954 World Cup, which was more than three times as large as Qatar and only needed to host 16 teams instead of 32. Qatar also became only the second country (not including Uruguay and Italy, hosts of the first two World Cups) to be awarded a FIFA World Cup despite having never qualified for a previous edition: Japan was awarded co-hosting rights of the 2002 World Cup in 1996 without ever having qualified for the finals, although they qualified for the 1998 edition. Of the eight stadiums used in the tournament, six were located in the Doha metropolitan area, making it the first World Cup since 1930 in which most of the stadiums were in one city. While this decreased the distance that fans and players needed to commute, Qatar itself struggled to accommodate the numbers of arriving fans with its diminutive amount of space.[319]\n\n\nDue to Qatar's laws on alcohol consumption, World Cup organisers announced the creation of designated \"sobering-up\" zones as an alternative to wide-scale arrests of intoxicated fans during the World Cup.[320] Qatar's World Cup chief executive of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, Nasser Al Khater, stated that the purpose of the designated sobering-up areas was to ensure the fans' safety.[321] If a fan was sent to the \"sobering up\" zone, they were permitted to leave when they could display clearheaded behaviour.[322] Multiple news agencies described the controversy as a \"cultural clash\" between social conservatism and Islamic morality against the \"norms\" of secular Western liberal democracies.[11][323]\n\n\nA number of groups and media outlets expressed concern over the suitability of Qatar to host the event.[324][325] Issues regarding from human rights,[8][298] worker conditions, the rights of LGBT fans,[298] and the illegality of homosexuality in Qatar.[326][327][328] In December 2020, Qatar said rainbow flags would be allowed at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[329] Qatari officials initially stated that they would not prohibit the display of pride flags at tournament venues, although the country still advised LGBT attendees to comply with the country's modesty and avoid public displays of affection.[330][331] Hassan Abdulla al-Thawadi, chief executive of the country's World Cup bid, said that Qatar would permit alcohol consumption during the event,[332][333] even though drinking in public was not permitted.[334] There were plans to allow the sale of alcohol inside stadiums and at fan villages.[335] Normally, the sale of alcohol is restricted to non-Muslim guests at selected luxury hotels only.[336] However, in the months preceding the tournament, the display of LGBT material and the sale of alcohol were banned.[335][337][338][339][340]\n\n\nThe climate conditions caused some to call hosting the tournament in Qatar infeasible, with initial plans for air-conditioned stadiums giving way to a potential date switch from summer to November and December.[5] In May 2014, Sepp Blatter, who was FIFA president at the time of the selection, remarked that awarding the World Cup to Qatar was a \"mistake\" because of the extreme heat.[5][341][342] While addressing delegates from African and Asian confederations, Blatter said allegations of corruption and some of the criticism, including those from sponsors, were \"very much linked to racism and discrimination\".[343] The attendance figures at the matches also came under scrutiny as the reported crowd attendance was more than the stadium capacities despite games having visible empty seats.[344]\n\n\nPrior to the tournament, a reporter for Denmark's TV 2 was threatened by security during a live report from the Katara Cultural Village; the organising committee apologised, stating that they were \"mistakenly interrupted\".[345] Tony O'Donoghue of Ireland's RT\u00c9 also accused Qatari police of interrupting him while filming.[346]\n\n\nOn 5 November 2022, *The Sunday Times* and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism published an investigation reporting that a group from an Indian hacking company had compromised the email accounts of various politicians, reporters, and other prominent individuals that had been critical of Qatar's hosting of the World Cup. It was also reported that the group had been hired by Jonas Rey, private investigators based in Switzerland, which were in turn hired by Qatari officials.[347]\n\n\n\n### Migrant workers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Human rights issues involving the 2022 FIFA World Cup \u00a7\u00a0Migrant workers\n\nThere were criticisms the state of human rights in Qatar and of the conditions of migrant workers brought in to build the required infrastructure, including indentured servitude and working conditions leading to deaths.[351] On October 23, 2022, an article published by *The Guardian* included statements from migrants working on the event infrastructure. Surveying 1,000 workers, 86% of participants said that the labour changes had improved their lives and that better working conditions are negotiable.[352] Legislation has also been proposed on the minimum wage, summertime worker safety, and the election of migrant worker representatives in businesses. Labour mobility is a result of changes to the Kafala system.[353]\n\n\nAccording to Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, prior to the tournament, \"the new Kafala system tranche of law will put an end to Kafala and establish a contemporary industrial relations system.\"[354]\n\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino has defended Qatar's decision to host the tournament.[355] Others have asserted that Qatar has a better human rights record than Russia and China, which were subjected to less harsh criticism for the same problems when hosting important athletic events in the years before the tournament.[356]\n\n\n\n### Move to November and December[edit]\n\n\nOwing to the climate in Qatar, concerns were expressed over holding the World Cup in its traditional time frame of June and July.[5] In October 2013, a task force was commissioned to consider alternative dates and report after the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.[357] On 24 February 2015, the FIFA Task Force proposed that the tournament be played from late November to late December 2022,[358] to avoid the summer heat and also avoid clashing with the 2022 Winter Olympics in February, the 2022 Winter Paralympics in March and Ramadan in April.[359][360]\n\n\nThe notion of staging the tournament in November was controversial because it would interfere with the regular season schedules of some domestic leagues around the world. Commentators noted the clash with the Christian Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, whilst there was concern about how short the tournament was intended to be.[361] FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the event to Qatar was a \"blatant mistake\".[362]\n\n\nFrank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said that if the 2022 World Cup were moved to November and thus upset the schedule of the A-League, they would seek compensation from FIFA.[363] Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme.[364] In 2015, FIFA confirmed that the final would be played in December.[365] Critics condemned the Euro-centrism of these allegations, and questioned why global sporting events must be held within the traditional European summer season.[366]\n\n\n\n### Bidding corruption allegations, 2014[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Garcia Report\n\nSome allegations were made over the role of former football official Mohammed bin Hammam played in securing the bid.[367] A former employee of the Qatar bid team alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5\u00a0million by Qatar.[368] She retracted her claims, but later said that she was coerced to do so by Qatari bid officials.[369][370] In March 2014, it was discovered that former CONCACAF president Jack Warner and his family were paid almost $2\u00a0million from a firm linked to Qatar's successful campaign.[371]\n\n\n*The Sunday Times* published bribery allegations based on a leak of millions of secret documents.[372] Five of FIFA's six primary sponsors, Sony, Adidas, Visa, Hyundai, and Coca-Cola, called upon FIFA to investigate the claims.[373][374] Jim Boyce, vice-president of FIFA, stated he would support a re-vote to find a new host if the corruption allegations are proven.[375][376] FIFA completed a lengthy investigation into these allegations and a report cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing. Despite the claims, the Qataris insisted that the corruption allegations were being driven by envy and mistrust while Blatter said it was fueled by racism in the British media.[377][378]\n\n\nIn the 2015 FIFA corruption case, Swiss officials, operating under information from the United States Department of Justice, arrested many senior FIFA officials in Z\u00fcrich and seized physical and electronic records from FIFA's main headquarters. The arrests continued in the United States, where several FIFA officers were arrested, and FIFA buildings were raided. The arrests were made on the information of at least a $150\u00a0million corruption and bribery scandal.[379] From those arrested, $40 million was forfeited under guilty pleas.[380] In 2022, the president of the El Salvador soccer association, Reynaldo Vasquez, was sentenced to 16 months in prison in connection to over $350,000 in bribes.[381]\n\n\nFollowing the corruption case, Phaedra Almajid, the former media officer for the Qatar bid team, claimed that the allegations would result in Qatar not hosting the World Cup.[382] In an interview published on the same day, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled.\"[383][384]\n\n\nIn 2014, FIFA appointed Michael Garcia as its independent ethics investigator to look into bribery allegations against Russia and Qatar. Garcia investigated all nine bids and eleven countries involved in the 2018 and 2022 bids.[385] At the end of the investigation, Garcia submitted a 430-page report. The FIFA governing body then appointed a German judge, Hans Joachim Eckert, who reviewed and presented a 42-page summary of the report two months later. The report cleared Qatar and Russia of bribery allegations, stating that Qatar \"pulled Aspire into the orbit of the bid in significant ways\" but did not \"compromise the integrity\" of the overall bid process.[386] Michael Garcia reacted almost immediately, stating that the report is \"materially incomplete\" and contains \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\".[386]\n\n\nIn 2017, a German journalist Peter Rossberg claimed to have obtained the report and wrote that it \"does not provide proof that the 2018 or 2022 World Cup was bought\" and stated that he would publish the full report. This forced FIFA to release the original report. The full report did not provide any evidence of corruption against the host of the 2022 World Cup but stated that bidders tested the rules of conduct to the limit.[387]\n\n\n\n### Russian participation[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) handed Russia a four-year ban from all major sporting events, after RUSADA was found non-compliant for handing over manipulated lab data to investigators.[388] The Russian national team were still permitted to enter qualification, as the ban only applied to the final tournament to decide the world champions. A team representing Russia, which used the Russian flag and anthem, could not participate under the WADA decision whilst the ban was active.[389] The decision was appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport,[390] and on 17 December 2020, Russian teams were banned from competing at world championships organized or sanctioned by a WADA signatory until 16 December 2022, the day before the third place play-off.[391]\n\n\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia's participation was further thrown into doubt. On 24 February 2022, the three teams in Russia's qualifying path\u2014Czech Republic, Poland, and Sweden\u2014announced their unwillingness to play any matches in Russian territory.[392] Poland and Sweden extended the boycott on 26 February to any qualifying games, and the Czech Republic made the same decision one day later.[393][394][395]\n\n\nOn 27 February 2022, FIFA announced a number of sanctions impacting Russia's participation in international football. Russia was prohibited from hosting international competitions, and the national team was ordered to play all home matches behind closed doors in neutral countries. Under these sanctions, Russia would not be allowed to compete under the country's name, flag, or national anthem; similarly to the Russian athletes' participation in events such as the Olympics,[396] the team would compete under the abbreviation of their national federation, the Russian Football Union (\"RFU\"), rather than \"Russia\".[397] The next day, FIFA decided to suspend Russia from international competitions \"until further notice\", including its participation in the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[398]\n\n\n\n### LGBT and women's rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup\n\nThere are no LGBT rights in Qatar, with homosexuality as well as campaigning for LGBTQ+ rights criminalized. As such, when Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with the security of fans,[399] as well as the homophobic football chants of certain nations, were points of discussion.[400] The main controversy came from a last-minute FIFA decision to hand out player punishments to European captains who had months earlier announced their intention to continue wearing rainbow-colored armbands (which began in 2020) in support of anti-discrimination. Typically, kit violations incur a fine, which the teams had said they would pay; on the day of the first match involving one of the teams, FIFA reportedly told the teams that they would receive a yellow card at a minimum for wearing the armbands.[401] Qatari officials stated that all people are welcome as long as they follow the public display of affection laws which apply to everyone.[402][403]\n\n\nSecurity officials at stadiums also confiscated items of rainbow clothing and flags featuring rainbows.[404][405][406] American journalist Grant Wahl was briefly detained for wearing a t-shirt with a rainbow on it.[407] Wahl reportedly received death threats for wearing the shirt, later dying at the stadium.[408][409] Other journalists with Wahl at the time of his death have reported that he began fitting or experiencing a seizure, and called for help himself. They criticized the Qatar Supreme Committee for not providing defibrillators in the stadium, as they had looked for one to try to help Wahl.[410] In response, FIFA said that according to the ambulance service, a defibrillator was made available when paramedics later arrived on scene.[411] An autopsy done on Wahl in New York City later revealed that Wahl died from an aortic aneurysm rupture.[412]\n\n\nDiscrimination against women in Qatar was also criticized.[413][414] Women in Qatar have few freedoms,[413][415] as they must obtain permission from their male guardians to marry, study abroad on government scholarships, work in many government jobs, travel abroad, receive certain forms of reproductive health care, and act as the primary guardian of children, even if they are divorced.[416]\n\n\nQatar attracted particular criticism for an incident where a Mexican employee of the World Cup Organizing Committee was accused of allegedly having sex outside of marriage. The woman had previously reported rape, while the male claimed to have been in a relationship with her, after which the woman was investigated for extramarital sex. Women in Qatar face the possible penalty of flagellation and a seven-year prison sentence if convicted for having sex outside of marriage. The criminal case was eventually dropped months after she was allowed to leave Qatar.[417]\n\n\n\n### Influence of Iran[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An Iranian fan showing a banner with \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" slogan\nIn November 2022, there were reports suggesting that the government of Iran were working with Qatari officials to suppress anti-government protests at the 2022 FIFA World Cup,[418] in light of the Mahsa Amini protests. Leaked documents and audio clips suggested that Iranian government officials were in correspondence with Qatari authorities in order to handle possible protesters.[419]\n\n\nIn November 2022, the Qatari government revoked the visas of journalists from a London-based Iranian news channel, Iran International, known for being critical of the regime, who were seeking to cover the World Cup.[420] On 21 November 2022, during the first group stage match from Group B, between Iran and England, attempts were reportedly made by the stadium's security forces to block Iranian fans who wore clothing or carried items bearing slogans that were deemed unsympathetic to the Islamic government of Iran.[421] These included t-shirts and signs with \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" embedded onto them, Iran's previous flags, or any slogans containing the name of Mahsa Amini.[422] This crackdown continued throughout all of Iran's matches at the World Cup.[418] In addition to removing fans from stadiums, reports showed that officials tried to suppress any filming or photography of possible protests. In one case, Qatari police detained Danish TV presenter, Rasmus Tantholdt, for filming fans with \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" slogans, some of whom who had been earlier abused by a group of pro-government supporters.[423]\n\n\n\n### Treatment of Jewish and Israeli visitors[edit]\n\n\nQatar had previously promised to provide Jewish tourists with cooked *kosher* food and public Jewish prayer services at the tournament. However, shortly before the World Cup began, both were banned by Qatar, who claimed it could not secure the safety of Jews.[424][425] Qatar alleged that they could not \"secure\" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat. It was estimated that 10,000 religious Jews from Israel and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar.[426]\n\n\nWhilst Jewish organisations complained of being unable to find cooked kosher food,[426] the Israeli government said it was happy with the efforts made by Qatar to meet its requests, including kosher food, direct flights from Israel to Qatar, and temporary diplomatic representation in the country. A kosher kitchen under the supervision of Rabbi Mendy Chitrik was open in time for the first match. Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, said he had never asked the Qatari government for cooked food, and he had been the only person in communication with the Qataris regarding making the World Cup experience inclusive for Jews.[427]\n\n\nMultiple Israeli reporters at the tournament reported fans from Arab nations waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israeli slogans while harassing them.[298][428][429] Some Israelis reported that they had been escorted out of restaurants when their nationality was revealed.[430] The Israeli government warned its citizens traveling to the tournament to hide their Israeli identity out of safety concerns.[431]\n\n\n\n### Accommodation[edit]\n\n\nThe Rawdat Al Jahhaniya fan village was criticised for its overpriced \"night cabins\" (\u00a3185 per night) made out of shipping containers. Tourists complained that the air conditioners in the cabins did not function well, facilities were falling apart, and the sleeping experience did not match their expectations.[432] The BBC reported that the tent accommodation at the Qetaifan Island fan village got criticism for having brown-colored tap water and no air conditioning other than a standing fan.[433][434] The tent village in Al Khor was criticized for having inconvenient transportation, a lack of alcohol, long waits to check in, and no locks on the tents.[435][436] The lack of suitable and affordable accommodation raised demand for daily shuttle flights from neighboring areas, such as Dubai, that had adequate numbers of hotel rooms.[437]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* FIFA World Cup\n* FIFA World Cup hosts\n* 2021 FIFA Arab Cup\n* 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup\n* 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The 2018 competition in Russia featured two partially Asian venues, according to various definitions of the geographical boundary between Asia and Europe\u2014Yekaterinburg (sits on the foothills of the Ural mountains and acts a barrier between Europe and Asia) and Sochi.

Regarded as one of the best players in the world, he is renowned for his dribbling abilities, exceptional speed, and finishing.[2][3]\n\n\nBorn in Paris and raised in nearby Bondy, Mbapp\u00e9 began his senior club career in 2015 with Monaco, where he won the Ligue 1 title in the 2016\u201317 season. In 2017, aged 18, Mbapp\u00e9 signed for Paris Saint-Germain on an eventual permanent transfer worth \u20ac180\u00a0million, making him the second-most-expensive player and most expensive teenage player of all time.[4] With PSG, he has won five Ligue 1 titles and three Coupes de France, including a domestic quadruple in the 2019\u201320 season, while also leading the club to its first ever UEFA Champions League final in 2020. He is the club's all-time top goalscorer and ranks third of all time in assists.\n\n\nAt international level, Mbapp\u00e9 made his senior debut for France in 2017, at age of 18. At the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Mbapp\u00e9 became the youngest French player to score at a World Cup, as well as the second teenager, after Pel\u00e9, to score in a World Cup final. He finished as the joint second-highest goalscorer as France won the tournament; he went on to win the FIFA World Cup Best Young Player and French Player of the Year awards for his performances. At the 2022 FIFA World Cup, France reached the final again; Mbapp\u00e9 won the Golden Boot and Silver Ball and set the record for most goals scored in World Cup finals by scoring a hat-trick.\n\n\nMbapp\u00e9 finished in third place for the 2023 Ballon d'Or and was runner-up for the 2022 The Best FIFA Men's Player award. He was named to the FIFA FIFPro World11 in 2018, 2019 and 2022, the UEFA Team of the Year in 2018 and the UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season in 2016\u201317, 2019\u201320, 2020\u201321 and 2021\u201322.

In 2023, he was among *Time*'s 100 most influential people in the world, and was ranked third on the *Forbes* list of the world's highest-paid athletes.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nKylian Mbapp\u00e9 Lottin[5] was born on 20 December 1998[6] in the 19th arrondissement of Paris[7] and was raised in Bondy, Seine-Saint-Denis, in the northeastern suburbs of Paris.[8] His father, Wilfrid\u00a0[fr], is originally from Cameroon, and, as well as being his agent, is a football coach. His mother, Fayza Lamari, is of Algerian Kabyle origin and is a former handball player.[9][10][11][12] He has a younger brother, Ethan, who plays in the Paris Saint-Germain Academy.[13][14] Their older adoptive brother, Jir\u00e8s Kembo Ekoko, is a former professional footballer.[15]\n\n\nAs a child, Mbapp\u00e9 went to a private Catholic school in Bondy, where he was considered academically gifted but unruly.[16] At 15, he began taking Spanish lessons, and eventually became fluent in the language.[17] Among Mbapp\u00e9's idols growing up were Zinedine Zidane,[18] Cristiano Ronaldo,[19] Neymar,[20] Ronaldinho,[21] Lionel Messi,[20] Ronaldo Nazario,[22] Eden Hazard[23] and Thierry Henry.[24][25] As a child, Mbapp\u00e9 received Robinho's AC Milan shirt as a gift from his nanny's family, who were supporters of the Italian club.[26][27] However, Mbapp\u00e9 aspired to play for Real Madrid.[28]\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nMbapp\u00e9 began his career at AS Bondy, being coached by his father, Wilfrid. Another of his youth coaches at AS Bondy, Antonio Riccardi, stated,\n\n\n\n\n> The first time I coached him was when he was six years old. You could tell he was different. Kylian could do much more than the other children. His dribbling was already fantastic and he was much faster than the others. He was the best player I've ever seen in 15 years coaching here. In Paris, there are many talents but I'd never seen a talent like him. He was what we call a 'crack' (the best).[29]\n> \n> \n\n\nEventually, Mbapp\u00e9 moved to the Clairefontaine academy, putting in a host of impressive performances leading to numerous French clubs, and Real Madrid, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Bayern Munich, attempting to sign him.[12] At the age of 11, Real Madrid invited him to train with their under-12s and visit the club's facilities.[30] At age 14, he travelled to London after an invite from Chelsea, playing a match for their youth team against Charlton Athletic.[31]\n\n\n\n### Monaco[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2013, at the age of 14, Mbapp\u00e9 joined the youth academy of Monaco, signing a three-year contract.[32][33] The club had beat competition from Real Madrid and Zinedine Zidane, who was \"very involved\" in efforts to sign him.[34]\n\n\n\n#### 2015\u201316: Development[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2015, Mbapp\u00e9 was brought in by Leonardo Jardim to be a mainstay in Monaco's reserve team, but his level of skill and maturity prompted his promotion to the main squad after just three weeks.[35] He made his first team debut two months later, on 2 December 2015, in a 1\u20131 Ligue 1 home draw against Caen, replacing F\u00e1bio Coentr\u00e3o after 88 minutes. Mbapp\u00e9 therefore became Monaco's youngest-ever first-team player, aged 16 years and 347 days, breaking the previous record set by Thierry Henry in 1994.[32][36]\n\n\nOn 20 February 2016, Mbapp\u00e9 scored his first goal for the club's first team, a stoppage-time goal in a 3\u20131 league win over Troyes at the Stade Louis II; at the age of 17 years and 62 days, he became the youngest first-team goalscorer in Monaco's history\u2014once again displacing Henry in the process.[37][38] On 6 March 2016, Mbapp\u00e9 signed his first professional contract, a three-year deal, tying him to Monaco until June 2019.[39] In an interview with CNN, Vadim Vasilyev, AS Monaco's vice-president, stated that he knew early on that Mbapp\u00e9 was a \"phenomenon\".[40]\n\n\n\n#### 2016\u201317: Breakthrough and league title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mbapp\u00e9 warming up for Monaco in 2017\nMbapp\u00e9 scored the first hat-trick of his first-team career on 14 December 2016, in a 7\u20130 home win over Rennes in the Coupe de la Ligue round of 16 \u2013 the first hat-trick scored by any Monaco player in the competition since Sonny Anderson in 1997.[41][42][36] On 11 February 2017, Mbapp\u00e9 scored the first Ligue 1 hat-trick of his career in a 5\u20130 home win over Metz; at 18 years and two months, he became the youngest player to score a league hat-trick since J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez did so for Sochaux back in 2005.[43] On 21 February, Mbapp\u00e9 scored Monaco's second goal in the 40th minute of a 5\u20133 loss away to Manchester City in the UEFA Champions League round of 16. It was his first European-competition goal, and he became the second-youngest French scorer in Champions League history, behind only Karim Benzema.[44][45] On 5 March, Mbapp\u00e9 scored two first-half goals in a 4\u20130 home win over Nantes to bring his Ligue 1 career tally to ten goals, becoming the youngest player in the previous thirty years to reach the ten-goal mark in the league.[46][47] On 11 March, he scored a goal in a 2\u20131 home win over Bordeaux, registering his seventh goal in his previous four league starts.[48]\n\n\nOn 15 March 2017, Mbapp\u00e9 scored Monaco's opening goal in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 tie with Manchester City. Monaco went on to win 3\u20131, and with the aggregate score being tied 6\u20136, advanced to the quarter-finals thanks to the away goals rule.[49] In the quarter-finals against Borussia Dortmund, Mbapp\u00e9 won a penalty and scored two goals as Monaco won the first leg 3\u20132 at the Westfalenstadion.[50] In the second leg at home, he opened the scoring as Monaco won 3\u20131 and advanced to the semi-finals.[51] They were eventually eliminated from the Champions League following a 4\u20131 loss on aggregate to Juventus, with Mbapp\u00e9 scoring his team's lone goal in the second leg.[52] Mbapp\u00e9 ended the 2016\u201317 season with 26 goals from 44 matches in all competitions, as Monaco won the Ligue 1 title.[53] He credited fellow Monaco striker Radamel Falcao as a key influence on him throughout the season, giving him the space to express himself and teaching him to be \"calm\" and \"serene\" during the game.[54]\n\n\n\n### Paris Saint-Germain[edit]\n\n\n#### 2017\u201318: World record transfer and domestic treble[edit]\n\n\nOn 31 August 2017, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) announced the signing of Mbapp\u00e9 from Monaco on loan with a mandatory purchase option of \u20ac180 million.[55][56] According to PSG's assistant sporting director Luis Ferrer, the shift in Mbapp\u00e9's decision to join the club was partly thanks to a \"convincing\" speech given by manager Unai Emery at the Mbapp\u00e9s' home over the summer.[57][58][59] The \u20ac180 million fee made Mbapp\u00e9 the most expensive teenager ever and the second-most-expensive player ever (behind teammate Neymar), and broke the record for the largest transfer within a domestic league.[60][61][62][63] He was handed the number 29 shirt upon arrival in the French capital.[64]\n\n\nOn 8 September 2017, Mbapp\u00e9 made his PSG debut in a 5\u20131 Ligue 1 win away at Metz, scoring a goal.[65] Four days later, he recorded his first European goal for the club in a 5\u20130 UEFA Champions League group stage away defeat of Celtic.[66] He starred in PSG's 3\u20130 victory over Bayern Munich in the second group game of the Champions League, setting up goals for Edinson Cavani and Neymar, the latter seeing him taking out a defender with a feint by rolling the ball under his foot.[67] On 6 December, Mbapp\u00e9 scored his tenth career Champions League goal in a 3\u20131 defeat to Bayern Munich, becoming the youngest player to reach that mark, at the age of 18 years and 11 months.[68] Having already won his first league title with the club, on 8 May 2018, Mbapp\u00e9 featured in PSG's 2\u20130 win over Les Herbiers in the Coupe de France final.[69]\n\n\n\n#### 2018\u201319: Ligue 1 Player of the Year[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mbapp\u00e9 with Paris Saint-Germain in 2019\nIn July 2018, Mbapp\u00e9 was given the number 7 jersey for the upcoming season with PSG, taking up the squad number left vacant by Lucas Moura.[70] Sporting the hashtag #K7LIAN, Mbapp\u00e9 stated, \"I keep trying to progress on the pitch and I think that, for me, it was the right time to change number. It is something of an affirmation. The No. 7 shirt is a legendary one and many greats have worn it. I hope that I will be able to do this number justice on the pitch.\"[70]\n\n\nIn his first appearance of the season, Mbapp\u00e9 scored twice in the last 10 minutes as PSG won 3\u20131 against Guingamp in Ligue 1.[71] In the following league game, the front three of Mbapp\u00e9, Cavani and Neymar all scored in a 3\u20131 win over Angers at home, with Mbapp\u00e9 \u2013 starting his first game of the season \u2013 scoring from a volley and setting up Neymar to score the third.[72] On 1 September, he scored and assisted in a 4\u20132 away win over N\u00eemes, but was sent off for the first time in his career with a straight red card in injury time, after shoving T\u00e9ji Savanier in retaliation for a late challenge from behind, for which Savanier was also sent off.[73] Regarding his sending-off, Mbapp\u00e9 told reporters after the match, \"If I had the chance to do it over again, I would do the same thing. I will apologise to the supporters and everybody, but I cannot tolerate this sort of thing.\"[74] On 8 October, Mbapp\u00e9 scored four goals in just 13 minutes in a 5\u20130 home victory over Lyon and became the youngest player (at 19 years and 9 months) to score four goals in one game in Ligue 1 over the last forty-five seasons.[75] On 3 December, Mbapp\u00e9 was the inaugural winner of the Kopa Trophy, which is awarded by *France Football* to the best under-21 player in the world.[76]\n\n\nOn 19 January 2019, Mbapp\u00e9 was one of two players (the other being Cavani) to score a hat-trick in a 9\u20130 win over Guingamp, breaking a record PSG had set the previous season.[77] On 12 February, he scored a goal in a 2\u20130 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford in the Champions League round of 16.[78] On 2 March, he scored twice in a 2\u20131 away win over Caen to reach his 50th goal with the club.[79] On 6 March, PSG lost 3\u20131 at home against Manchester United and was subsequently knocked out from the Champions League on the away goals rule.[80] On 21 April, he scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20131 win against Monaco, netting his first goals against his former club.[81] PSG finished the season as Ligue 1 champions,[82] with Mbapp\u00e9 winning the Player of the Year award,[83] while also finishing the season as the top goalscorer with 33 goals.[82]\n\n\n\n#### 2019\u201320: Domestic quadruple and European final[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mbapp\u00e9 playing against Dynamo Dresden in July 2019\nOn 3 August, Mbapp\u00e9 scored in a 2\u20131 win over Rennes to capture his first title of the 2019\u201320 season, the Troph\u00e9e des Champions.[84] He then scored again in PSG's opening Ligue 1 match of the season, a 3\u20130 home win over N\u00eemes on 11 August.[85] On 22 October, he came off the bench and scored a perfect hat-trick in a 5\u20130 away win over Belgian side Club Brugge in the Champions League;[86] at the age of 20 years and 306 days, he became the youngest player ever to score at least 15 goals in the competition.[87]\n\n\nOn 1 May 2020, PSG were crowned Ligue 1 champions after the season had been called off amid the COVID-19 pandemic; at the time of the league's premature suspension, PSG were in first place, with a twelve\u2013point lead over second\u2013placed Marseille.[88][89] Mbapp\u00e9 finished the 2019\u201320 season as joint-top scorer in Ligue 1 with 18 goals, along with Monaco's Wissam Ben Yedder; however, Mbapp\u00e9 was assigned the title due to his higher goals-per-game ratio.[90] On 24 July, in the Coupe de France final against Saint-\u00c9tienne, Mbapp\u00e9 was forced off after sustaining an injury following a challenge from Lo\u00efc Perrin, who was sent off;

Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade \u20ac4.1\u00a0million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of \u20ac5.1\u00a0million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay \u20ac1.7\u00a0million and \u20ac1.4\u00a0million in fines.[676] Facing the judge, he said, \"I just played football.

First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[19][22] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the *Infantiles* due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Lionel Messi](image) | This article is part of a series aboutLionel Messi |\n\n |\n| **Argentine professional footballer**\n* Career\n* International goals\n* Achievements\n* Rivalry with Cristiano Ronaldo\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Eponyms and public art**\n* Cougar\n* Dog\n* *Liolaemus messii*\n* Sistine Chapel of Football\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Media**\n* *Messi* (2014)\n* *Messi* (2017)\n* *Messi and Maud* (2017)\n* *Take the Ball Pass the Ball* (2018)\n* *Messi's World Cup: The Rise of a Legend* (2024)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Family**\n* Antonela Roccuzzo\n* Maxi Biancucchi\n* Emanuel Biancucchi\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Related**\n* New Maradona\n* Hong Kong v Inter Miami\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 7 June, Inter Miami posted a video on their social media hinting at the club's impending signing of Messi.[367] On the same day, Messi confirmed his intention to join Miami in a joint interview with *Mundo Deportivo* and *Sport*, in which he said that they \"haven't closed it 100 percent\"; MLS also stated that the deal had not been finalised.[368] He explained that even though La Liga had accepted everything and was fine for him to return to Barcelona, there were many things left to be done such as lowering salaries and selling players, and he did not want to go through it again or be responsible for it.[369] He confirmed that other European clubs approached him, but that Barcelona was the only European team he wanted to play for.[366]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.[27] At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while F\u00e0bregas and Piqu\u00e9 soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.[22][28][29]\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Barcelona[edit]\n\n\n#### 2003\u20132005: rise to the first team[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"It seemed as if he had been playing with us all his life.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2013 Barcelona's then assistant coach Henk ten Cate on Messi's first-team debut.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** Two appearances and one goal in FIFA World Cup qualification, one appearance in CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions, seven appearances and seven goals in FIFA World Cup\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\nFor a comprehensive listing of Messi's achievements, see List of career achievements by Lionel Messi.\n\n![](image)Messi (Golden Ball winner) pictured with future teammate Neymar (Bronze Ball winner) at the conclusion of the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup final\n**Barcelona**[692]\n\n\n\n* La Liga: 2004\u201305, 2005\u201306, 2008\u201309, 2009\u201310, 2010\u201311, 2012\u201313, 2014\u201315, 2015\u201316, 2017\u201318, 2018\u201319\n* Copa del Rey: 2008\u201309, 2011\u201312, 2014\u201315, 2015\u201316, 2016\u201317, 2017\u201318, 2020\u201321\n* Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a: 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018\n* UEFA Champions League: 2005\u201306,[note 3] 2008\u201309, 2010\u201311, 2014\u201315\n* UEFA Super Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\n* FIFA Club World Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\n\n\n**Paris Saint-Germain**[693]\n\n\n\n* Ligue 1: 2021\u201322, 2022\u201323\n* Troph\u00e9e des Champions: 2022\n\n\n**Inter Miami**\n\n\n\n* Leagues Cup: 2023[694]\n\n\n**Argentina U20**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Men's football |\n| Representing ![](image)\u00a0Argentina |\n| FIFA World Cup |\n| **Winner** | 2022 Qatar |  |\n| **Runner-up** | 2014 Brazil |  |\n| Copa Am\u00e9rica |\n| **Winner** | 2021 Brazil |  |\n| **Runner-up** | 2007 Venezuela |  |\n| **Runner-up** | 2015 Chile |  |\n| **Runner-up** | 2016 United States |  |\n| ![Third place](image) | 2019 Brazil |  |\n| CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions |\n| **Winner** | 2022 England |  |\n| Olympic Games |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) | 2008 Beijing | Team |\n| FIFA U-20 World Cup |\n| **Winner** | 2005 Netherlands |  |\n| South American U-20 Championship |\n| ![Third place](image) | 2005 Colombia |  |\n |\n| \n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Signature |\n| ![Lionel Messi signature](image) |\n\n |\n| \n\\*Club domestic league appearances and goals, correct as of 00:16, 22 October 2023 (UTC)\u2021 National team caps and goals, correct as of 03:17, 17 November 2023 (UTC) |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022\u2122: List of Players: Argentina\" (PDF).

He helped save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera Divisi\u00f3n, scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey match while man-marked by Sevilla's Sergio Ramos.[32][40] His progress was reflected in his first professional contract, signed on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of \u20ac30\u00a0million. A month later, on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B, and his buyout clause automatically increased to \u20ac80\u00a0million.[32][41] He played five games with the B team that season but did not score.[42] Physically he was weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.[381] Selectors for Spain's Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona's director of football, Carles Rexach, alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent *La Albiceleste* since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8\u20130 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nArgentine footballer (born 1987)\n\n\"Messi\" redirects here.

While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box,[554] or even on the right wing[555] or as a false nine,[556][557] he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4\u20132\u20133\u20131,[553] or as a second striker in a 4\u20134\u20132 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team's attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Su\u00e1rez.[558][559]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 2023, Messi made his return to Argentina as a world champion with two appearances in friendlies in his home country.

As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[18] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they declined to pay for his treatment.[19][20] His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \"the best forward I've ever seen\".[21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\u2013 Messi reversing his decision from retiring on 12 August 2016[458]\n\nJust a week after Messi announced his international retirement, Argentine newspaper *La Naci\u00f3n* reported that he was reconsidering playing for Argentina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September.[459] On 12 August, it was confirmed that Messi had reversed his decision to retire from international football, and he was included in the squad for the national team's upcoming 2018 World Cup qualifiers.[460] On 1 September, in his first game back, he scored in a 1\u20130 home win over Uruguay in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.[461]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n327. **^** \"Lionel Messi Makes First PSG Start But Club Brugge Hold On For A Draw\". *NDTVSports.com*.

He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[540] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[541][542][543] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[532][544] As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65,[545] the most among active players.[546] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[547]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup qualifier which also moved him above Pel\u00e9 as South America's top male international scorer with 79 goals.[508] In the 2022 Finalissima, the third edition of the CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions, at Wembley on 2 June 2022, Messi assisted twice in a 3\u20130 victory against Italy and was named player of the match, securing his second trophy for Argentina at the senior level.[509] Messi then followed this on 6 June with all five Argentina goals in a 5\u20130 victory in a friendly win over Estonia, overtaking Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s among the all-time international men's top scorers.[510]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the 2003\u201304 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for four youth teams in a single campaign.[31] After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the *Juveniles* B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the *Juveniles A*, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[32][33] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: \"He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien.\"[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Lionel Andr\u00e9s Messi Cuccittini: Matches 2003\u201304\". BDFutbol.

Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During the 2011\u201312 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's Porto on 16 November 2003.[22][35] His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team.[36] After his first training session with the senior squad, Bar\u00e7a's new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself.[37] Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi, whom he called \"little brother\", which greatly eased his transition into the first team.[38][39]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.[16][655][656] Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's.[657] Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.[658] His favourite meals include asado (traditional South American barbecue), milanesa and pasta, and he prefers his mate unsweetened.[659]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter two unsuccessful seasons, Barcelona were in need of an overhaul, leading to the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter's departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt.[54] He signed a new contract in July with an annual salary of \u20ac7.8\u00a0million, becoming the club's highest-paid player.[81][82] Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential.[64][83] Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.[75][84]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Messi prior to a friendly game with Al Ahli SC in Doha, Qatar in December 2016\nMessi finished the year with 51 goals, making him Europe's top scorer, one ahead of Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107.[215] After placing second in the 2016 Ballon d'Or, on 9 January 2017 Messi also finished in second place \u2013 behind Cristiano Ronaldo once again \u2013 in the 2016 Best FIFA Men's Player Award.[216] On 11 January, Messi scored from a free-kick in Barcelona's 3\u20131 victory against Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey, which enabled Barcelona to advance to the quarter-finals of the competition; with his 26th goal from a free-kick for Barcelona in all competitions, he equalled the club's all-time record, which had previously been set by Ronald Koeman.[217] In his next league match, on 14 January, Messi scored in a 5\u20130 win against Las Palmas; with this goal, he equalled Ra\u00fal's record for the most teams scored against in La Liga (35).[218]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n307. **^** \"Lionel Messi: Which goalkeepers got the 644 bottles of Budweiser beer?\". *GiveMeSport*. 27 December 2020.

Lionel Messi is the greatest thing we have in Argentina and we must take care of him.\"[455] Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodr\u00edguez Larreta unveiled a statue of Messi in the capital to convince him to reconsider retirement.[456] The campaign also continued in the streets and avenues of the Argentine capital, with about 50,000 supporters going to the Obelisco de Buenos Aires on 2 July, using the same slogan.[457]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"A lot of things went through my mind on the night of the final and I gave serious thought to quitting, but my love for my country and this shirt is too great.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHis buyout clause was set at \u20ac700\u00a0million.[233] On 7 January 2018, Messi made his 400th La Liga appearance with Barcelona in a 3\u20130 home win over Levante, marking the occasion with his 144th league assist and 365th league goal for the club, the latter of which saw him equal Gerd M\u00fcller's record for the most league goals scored for the same club in one of Europe's top five divisions.[234] A week later, he broke the record, scoring his 366th La Liga goal from a free kick in a 4\u20132 away win against Real Sociedad.[234]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Includes Copa del Rey, Coupe de France, U.S. Open Cup\n2. **^** Includes UEFA Champions League\n3. **^** One appearance in UEFA Super Cup, two appearances in Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a\n4. **^** One appearance in UEFA Super Cup, one appearance and two goals in Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, two appearances and two goals in FIFA Club World Cup\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** Appearance(s) in Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a\n6. **^** One appearance and one goal in UEFA Super Cup, two appearances and three goals in Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, two appearances and two goals in FIFA Club World Cup\n7. **^** One appearance and two goals in UEFA Super Cup, two appearances and one goal in Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, one appearance and one goal in FIFA Club World Cup\n8. **^** Appearance in Troph\u00e9e des Champions\n9. **^** Appearance(s) in Leagues Cup\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of international goals scored by Lionel Messi\n\n*As of match played 17 November 2023*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDue to his form in the previous season, Messi was not nominated for the Ballon d'Or award for the first time since 2005.[344] On 21 August, Messi provided a long-range assist for Mbapp\u00e9, clocked at eight seconds, for Ligue 1's second-fastest goal ever scored, before also scoring a goal in 7\u20131 away win over Lille.[345][346] The following matches, after registering six goal contributions, including one goal and five assists, Messi was named Ligue 1's Player of the Month in September.[347] On 5 October, he scored in a 1\u20131 draw away to Benfica in the Champions League, becoming the only player in the competition's history to score against 40 different Champions League opponents.[348] On 25 October, he scored twice in a 7\u20132 Champions League win at home to Maccabi Haifa, setting the record for the most goals scored from outside the 18-yard box than any other player in the competition, with 23 goals.[349] Four days later, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Messi during a training session with Barcelona in 2006\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing growing dissatisfaction with the direction of Barcelona on and off the field,[288] Barcelona announced that Messi sent the club \"a document expressing his desire to leave\" on 25 August 2020.[289] The announcement garnered a significant media response, including from current and former teammates (who supported Messi's statement) and Catalan president Quim Torra.[290] On 26 August, Barcelona's sporting director Ramon Planes iterated the club's desire to \"build a team around the most important player in the world\"[291] and affirmed Messi will only be able to leave should a buyer pay his \u20ac700\u00a0million buyout clause; a reported early termination option available in Messi's contract (which would have allowed him to leave the club for free) could only be exercised if he had communicated his decision to Barcelona by 31 May 2020, although the player's representatives argued the deadline should be set to 31 August, due to the adjourned 2019\u201320 season.[292] On 30 August, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn eight qualifying matches under Maradona's stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4\u20130 victory over Venezuela.[389][408] During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme.[409] Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process.[389] Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4\u20133\u20131\u20132 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the *enganche* in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.[410]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Messi holding off Sevilla's \u00c9ver Banega during the 2015 UEFA Super Cup\nMessi opened the 2015\u201316 season by scoring twice from free kicks in Barcelona's 5\u20134 victory (after extra time) over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[192] On 16 September, he became the youngest player to make 100 appearances in the UEFA Champions League in a 1\u20131 away draw to Roma.[193] After a knee injury, he returned to the pitch on 21 November, making a substitute appearance in Barcelona's 4\u20130 away win over rivals Real Madrid in *El Cl\u00e1sico*.[194] Messi capped off the year by winning the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup final on 20 December, collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as Barcelona defeated River Plate 3\u20130 in Yokohama.[195] On 30 December, Messi scored on his 500th appearance for Barcelona, in a 4\u20130 home win over Real Betis.[196]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOther events have illustrated Messi's presence in popular culture. Madame Tussauds unveiled their first wax sculpture of Messi at Wembley Stadium in 2012.[633] A gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25\u00a0kg (55\u00a0lb) and valued at $5.25\u00a0million, went on sale in Japan in March 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami.[634] In 2013, a Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with then-Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in the year of its release, receiving 137 million views, and was subsequently voted the best advertisement of the 2005\u201315 decade to commemorate YouTube's founding.[635][636] World Press Photo selected \"The Final Game\", a photograph of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014.[637] *Messi*, a documentary about his life by filmmaker \u00c1lex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.[638]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** \"Barcelona Star Lionel Messi Sets New Goal-Scoring Record\". *Guinness World Records*. 10 December 2012.

A turning point came on 11 January during a 3\u20131 victory over Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, the first time Bar\u00e7a's attacking trident of Messi, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly successful run.[172][173] After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Su\u00e1rez, their striker.[173][174] From there, he regained his best form, while Su\u00e1rez and Neymar ended the team's attacking dependency on their star player.[175][176] With 58 goals from Messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.[177]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 27 April, Messi came off the bench and scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 home win over Levante, which allowed Barcelona to clinch the league title;[254] this was his 450th La Liga appearance, and his first league title as Barcelona's captain.[255][256] On 1 May, Messi scored twice in a 3\u20130 home win over Liverpool in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals; his second goal of the match, a 35-yard free kick, was the 600th senior club goal of his career, all of which had been scored with Barcelona.[257] In the return leg six days later at Anfield, Barcelona suffered a 4\u20130 away defeat, which saw Liverpool advance to the final 4\u20133 on aggregate.[258] On 19 May, in Barcelona's final La Liga match of the season, Messi scored twice in a 2\u20132 away draw against Eibar (his 49th and 50th goals of the season in all competitions), which saw him capture his sixth Pichichi Trophy as the league's top scorer, with 36 goals in 34 appearances; with six titles, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIndeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule.[563] With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.[415][564]\n\n\n\n### Reception and comparisons to Diego Maradona[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Maradona\n\n> \n> \"I have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football and his name is Messi.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2013 Diego Maradona hailing the 18-year-old Messi as his successor in February 2006[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n225. **^** \"Leo Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez call for optimism\".

He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[672][673] In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pel\u00e9's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for \u00a3125,000.[674]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand.

Due to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, Messi was condemned for taking on the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing.[640][641] In April 2023, Messi was featured in the 200 year old Thrissur Pooram festival in Kerala, India.[642] During Thrissur Pooram, which is one of the largest festivals in Asia, umbrellas carrying the illuminated cut outs of Messi holding the World Cup trophy were displayed on the top of caparisoned elephants during the Kudamattam ceremony.[643]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family and relationships[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 23 December, Messi scored his 644th goal for Barcelona against Real Valladolid in La Liga, surpassing Pel\u00e9 with Santos as the player with the most goals scored for a single club.[305][306] In order to celebrate his achievement, Budweiser sent personalised bottles of beer to every goalkeeper whom Messi has scored against.[307] On 17 January 2021, Messi was sent off for the first time in his club career for violent conduct (swinging an arm at the head of Asier Villalibre, missed initially by the referee but reviewed via VAR) in the final minutes of Barcelona's 2\u20133 extra time defeat to Athletic Bilbao in the 2020\u201321 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a Final.[308] On 10 March, Messi scored from 35 yards out and later had a penalty saved in a 1\u20131 draw against Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 as Barcelona were eliminated at this stage for the first time in 14 years by an aggregate score of 2\u20135 after having lost 1\u20134 at home on 16 February, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCopa del Rey top scorers\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1986: Azcona, Merayo & R.

After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil.

That same year, Messi received a seventh Ballon d'Or. In 2022, he led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden Ball, scored seven goals including two in the final, and broke the record for most games played at the World Cup (26), later receiving his record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or in 2023.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnder Sabella, Messi's goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years.[389][416] He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by Gabriel Batistuta for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country.[418] His first international hat-trick came in a friendly against Switzerland on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and Guatemala. Messi then helped the team secure their place in the 2014 World Cup with a 5\u20132 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013 when he scored twice from penalty kicks, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina's second-highest goalscorer behind Batistuta. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe has said: \"Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy.\"[582] Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi's leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability.[583][584][585] Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become \"more one of the group, more Argentine\", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.[581]\n\n\n\n### Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Messi\u2013Ronaldo rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMessi opened the 2017\u201318 season by converting a penalty in Barcelona's 1\u20133 first leg home defeat to Real Madrid in Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a.[224] Thereby, Messi also extended his *El Cl\u00e1sico* goalscoring record with the goal being his 24th official and 25th overall.[225]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe set up his side's first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6\u20132 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium.[87][88] Returning to the wing, he played his first final since breaking into the first team on 13 May, scoring once and assisting a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4\u20131 to win the Copa del Rey.[89] With 23 league goals from Messi that season, Barcelona became La Liga champions three days later and achieved its fifth double.[85][90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Messi pointing to the sky following his record five-goal display against Bayer Leverkusen in the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League in 2012\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2018 UEFA Team of the Year\n |\n| --- |\n| * GK: Ter Stegen\n* RB: Ramos\n* CB: van Dijk\n* CB: Varane\n* LB: Marcelo\n* MF: Modri\u0107\n* MF: Kant\u00e9\n* MF: Hazard\n* MF: Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\n* FW: Messi\n* FW: C.

During the *Cl\u00e1sico* on 2 May 2009, however, he played for the first time as a false nine, positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with Xavi and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 2022 FIFA World Cup final on 18 December, Messi made his record 26th World Cup match appearance at Lusail Stadium. He scored Argentina's opening goal with a penalty, becoming in the process the first player since the last-16 round was introduced in 1986 to score a goal in every round of a single World Cup edition.[520][521] After Argentina's eventual two-goal lead was erased by France forward Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who scored twice inside two minutes, Messi would score again in extra-time to restore Argentina's lead, before Mbapp\u00e9 again drew France level. Tied 3\u20133 after extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Messi scored Argentina's first goal in the shoot-out, with Argentina eventually winning 4\u20132, ending the nation's 36-year wait for the trophy.[522] Messi received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament, becoming the first player to win it twice. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Bar\u00e7a's new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname \"Messiah\" from the Spanish media.[19][73][74] His efforts in 2007 also earned him award recognition; journalists voted him the third-best player of the year for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, behind Kak\u00e1 and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kak\u00e1.[75][76] Although he managed to score 16 goals during the 2007\u201308 campaign,[77] the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December.[78] He returned to score twice in their away victory against Celtic in the last 16 round of the Champions League, becoming the competition's top scorer at that point with six goals,[79] but reinjured himself during the return leg on 4 March 2008. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 4 February 2017, Messi scored his 27th free-kick for Barcelona in a 3\u20130 home win over Athletic Bilbao in the league, overtaking Koeman as the club's all-time top-scorer from free-kicks.[219] On 23 April, Messi scored twice in a 3\u20132 away win over Real Madrid. His game-winning goal in stoppage time was his 500th for Barcelona.[220] His memorable celebration saw him taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans \u2013 with his name and number facing the crowd.[221] On 27 May, Messi scored a goal and set up another for Paco Alc\u00e1cer in the 2017 Copa del Rey final, helping Barcelona to a 3\u20131 victory over Alav\u00e9s, and was named Man of the Match.[222] In total, Messi finished the 2016\u201317 season with 54 goals, while his 37 goals in La Liga saw him claim both the Pichichi and European Golden Boot Awards for the fourth time in his career.[223]\n\n\n\n#### 2017\u201318: domestic double and a record fifth Golden Boot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nthe view of Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe.[570][571] He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina,[572] until he won his first at the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica.[573]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nArgentina fans with Messi and Maradona banners at the 2018 World Cup in Russia\n![](image)\nThe *Sistine Chapel of Football* painting (Messi to the left, Maradona to the right), on the ceiling of a sports club, Sportivo Pereyra, in Barracas, Buenos Aires\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the third-place match against Chile on 6 July, Messi set-up Ag\u00fcero's opening goal from a free kick in an eventual 2\u20131 win, to help Argentina win the bronze medal; however, he was sent off along with Gary Medel in the 37th minute of play, after being involved in an altercation with the Chilean defender.[491] Following the match, Messi refused to collect his medal, and implied in a post-match interview that his comments following the semi-final led to his sending off.[492] Messi later issued an apology for his comments, but was fined $1,500 and was handed a one-match ban by CONMEBOL, which ruled him out of Argentina's next World Cup qualifier.[493] On 2 August, Messi was banned for three months from international football and was fined $50,000 by CONMEBOL for his comments against the referee's decisions; this ban meant he would miss Argentina's friendly matches against Chile, Mexico and Germany in September and October.[494] On 15 November, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the season's Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history,[91] Messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 4\u20130 quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich.[87] He returned as a false nine during the final on 27 May in Rome against Manchester United. Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2\u20130, the second goal coming from a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[92] This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of \u20ac250\u00a0million, while his salary increased to \u20ac12\u00a0million.[81]\n\n\n\n#### 2009\u201310: first Ballon d'Or[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe new year, however, started on a less positive note for Barcelona, as they were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Sevilla in the Round of 16.[96] Unsatisfied with his position on the right wing \u2013 with the club's summer acquisition Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 occupying the central forward role \u2013 Messi resumed playing as a false nine in early 2010, beginning with a Champions League last 16-round match against VfB Stuttgart. After a first-leg draw, Barcelona won the second leg 4\u20130 with two goals and an assist from Messi. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBut I think the best player ever played today here in the United States.\"[451] Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3);[452] he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis S\u00e1nchez.[453]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n522. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Church, Ben (18 December 2022). \"Lionel Messi-inspired Argentina wins World Cup after beating France in sensational final\".

His opening goal was hailed as one of the greatest in his career; he collected the ball near the halfway line and beat four opposing players, before feinting the goalkeeper to score in a tight space by the near post.[183]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators, and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.[A]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs Messi evolved from the team's symbolic captain into a genuine leader, he led Argentina to the knockout stage as group winners.[435] In the quarter-final, they created numerous chances, including a rebound header by Messi, but were repeatedly denied by Colombia's goalkeeper, and ultimately ended the match scoreless, leading to a 5\u20134 penalty shootout in their favour, with Messi netting his team's first spot kick.[436] At the semi-final stage, Messi excelled as a playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side's 6\u20131 victory over Paraguay, receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd.[435] Argentina started the final as the odds-on title favourites, but were defeated by Chile 4\u20131 in a penalty shootout after a 0\u20130 extra-time draw. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi scored Barcelona's second goal \u2013 his 40th of the season \u2013 in a 5\u20130 win over Sevilla in the 2018 Copa del Rey final, later also setting up Su\u00e1rez's second goal; this was Barcelona's fourth consecutive title and their 30th overall.[240] On 29 April, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 4\u20132 away win over Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a, which saw Barcelona claim their 25th league title.[241] On 9 May, Messi scored as Barcelona defeated Villarreal 5\u20131 to set the longest unbeaten streak (43 games) in La Liga history.[242]\n\n\n\n#### 2018\u201319: captaincy, 10th La Liga title, and a record sixth Golden Boot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile Barcelona began a gradual decline, the 19-year-old Messi established himself as one of the best players in the world during the 2006\u201307 campaign.[60][61] Already an idol to the *cul\u00e9s*, the club's supporters, he scored 17 goals in 36 games across all competitions.[61][62] However, he continued to be plagued by major injuries; a metatarsal fracture sustained on 12 November 2006 kept him out of action for three months.[63][64] He recovered in time for the last 16 round of the Champions League against Liverpool, but was effectively marked out of the game; Barcelona, the reigning champions, were out of the competition.[65] In the league, his goal contribution increased towards the end of the season; 11 of his 14 goals came from the last 13 games.[62] On 10 March 2007, he scored his first hat-trick in a *Cl\u00e1sico*, the first player to do so in 12 years, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n424. **^** Jurejko, Jonathan (1 July 2014). \"Argentina 1\u20130 Switzerland\". *BBC Sport*.
