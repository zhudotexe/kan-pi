Such occurrences have been reported in many countries throughout history.[1] One hypothesis is that tornadic waterspouts sometimes pick up creatures such as fish or frogs, and carry them for up to several miles.[1][2] However, this aspect of the phenomenon has never been witnessed by scientists.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nRain of flightless animals and things has been reported throughout history.[1] In the first century AD, Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder documented storms of frogs and fish.[4] In 1794, French soldiers saw toads fall from the sky during heavy rain at Lalain, near the French city of Lille.[5] Rural inhabitants in Yoro, Honduras claim \"fish rain\" happens there every summer, a phenomenon they call Lluvia de Peces.[6]\n\n\n\n## Explanations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tornadoes and waterspouts may lift up animals into the air and deposit them miles away\nFrench physicist Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re (1775\u20131836) was among the first scientists to take seriously accounts of raining animals. Addressing the Society of Natural Science, Amp\u00e8re suggested that at times frogs and toads roam the countryside in large numbers, and that violent winds could pick them up and carry them great distances.[3]\n\n\nAfter a reported rain of fish in Singapore in 1861, French naturalist Francis de Laporte de Castelnau speculated that a migration of walking catfish had taken place, dragging themselves over land from one puddle to another, following the rain.[7]\n\n\nThe likeliest explanation for many of the supposed cases is that there is no falling happening at all and the animals are driven along by winds or a deluge of some sort.[8] This explanation also accounts for the prevalence of reports that only a single species or type of animal is ever reported raining from the sky.\n\n\nA current scientific hypothesis involves tornadic waterspouts: a tornado that forms over the water.[1][9][10][11] Under this hypothesis, a tornadic waterspout transports animals to relatively high altitudes, carrying them over large distances. This hypothesis appears supported by the type of animals in these rains: small and light, usually aquatic,[12] and by the suggestion that the rain of animals is often preceded by a storm. However, the theory does not account for how all the animals involved in each individual incident would be from only one species, and not a group of similarly sized animals from a single area.[13] Further, the theory also does not account for a genuine tornadic waterspout not actually sucking objects up and carrying them rather than flinging objects out to the sides.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Doppler Image from Texas showing the collision of a thunderstorm with a group of bats in flight. The color red indicates the animals flying into the storm.\nIn the case of birds, storms may overcome a flock in flight, especially in times of migration. The Doppler image to the right shows an example wherein a group of bats is overtaken by a thunderstorm.[15] In the image, the bats are in the red zone, which corresponds to winds moving away from the radar station, and enter into a mesocyclone associated with a tornado (in green). These events may occur easily with birds, which can get killed in flight, or stunned and then fall (unlike flightless creatures, which first have to be lifted into the air by an outside force). Sometimes this happens in large groups, for instance, the blackbirds falling from the sky in Beebe, Arkansas, United States on December 31, 2010.[16] It is common for birds to become disoriented (for example, because of bad weather or fireworks) and collide with objects such as trees or buildings, killing them or stunning them into falling to their death. The number of blackbirds killed in Beebe is not spectacular considering the size of their congregations, which can be in the millions.[17] The event in Beebe, however, captured the imagination and led to more reports in the media of birds falling from the sky across the globe, such as in Sweden and Italy,[18] though many scientists claim such mass deaths are common occurrences but usually go unnoticed.[19] In contrast, it is harder to find a plausible explanation for rains of terrestrial animals.\n\n\nSome cases are thought to be caused by birds dropping fish. With regard to a documented rain of fish that occurred on December 29, 2021 in Texarkana, Texas, independent researchers Sharon A. Hill and Paul Cropper proposed that the fish had been dropped or possibly regurgitated by passing birds.[20] The theory found some favor with airport workers who had cleaned up the fish; they noted that there were birds in the area around the same time, and the fish \"were kind of chewed up\". In June 2022 around the San Francisco coast, a boom of anchovies is likely to be the cause of fair weather falling of fish from birds' mouths, such as pelicans.[21]\n\n\n\n## Occurrences[edit]\n\n\nThe following list is a selection of examples.\n\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1555 engraving of rain of fish\n* Singapore, February 22, 1861[22]\n* Tarai, Nepal, May 15, 1900[23]\n* Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada, July 1, 1903[24]\n* Marksville, Louisiana, October 23, 1947[25]\n* Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria, May 19, 1993\n* Knighton, Powys, Wales, 18 August 2004[26]\n* Kerala State, India, February 12, 2008[27]\n* Bhanwad, Jamnagar, India, October 24, 2009[28]\n* Lajamanu, Northern Territory, Australia, February 25 and 26, 2010[29]\n* Loreto, Agusan del Sur, Philippines, January 13, 2012[30][31]\n* IIT Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India September 12, 2013[32]\n* The annual Lluvia de Peces in Yoro, Honduras\n* Chilaw, Sri Lanka, 6 May 2014[33]\n* Nandigama, Andhra Pradesh India, 19 June 2015,[34]\n* Guntur, Andhra Pradesh India, 16 August 2015[35]\n* Dire Dawa, Ethiopia, 20 January 2016[36]\n* Pathapatnam, Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh, 19 May 2016[37]\n* Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 9 September 2016[38]\n* Mexico, Tamaulipas, Tampico, 26 September 2017[39]\n* Oroville, California, 16 May 2017[40]\n* Jaffna, Sri Lanka, 7 November 2017[41]\n* Texarkana, Texas, 30 December 2021[42]\n\n\n### Spiders[edit]\n\n\n* Albury, Australia, 1974[43]\n* Santo Ant\u00f4nio da Platina, Brazil, February 3, 2013[44]\n* Goulburn, Australia, 15 May 2015[43]\n\n\n### Frogs and toads[edit]\n\n\n* Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan, June 2009 (occurrences reported throughout the month)[45]\n* R\u00e1k\u00f3czifalva, Hungary, 18\u201320 June 2010 (twice)[46]\n* Cabo Polonio, Uruguay, Since 2011 (twice)[47]\n\n\n### Others[edit]\n\n\n* Jellyfish: Bath, England, 1894[48]\n* Worms: Jennings, Louisiana, July 11, 2007[49]\n* Various marine animals, including octopuses, seashells and starfish: Qingdao, Shandong Province, China, June 13, 2018[50]\n\n\n## Examples in popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* *Magnolia*\n* *Sharknado (film series)*\n* *Watchmen (TV series)*\n* *Good Omens (book and in the title sequence of Amazon Prime video series)*\n* *Fuego gris* (also here: at the article's Spanish version).\n* *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 6: Stone Ocean (manga/anime series)*\n* *The Sarah Jane Adventures, series 5, episode 2, The Curse of Clyde Langer*\n* Fargo (TV series)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Blood rain\n* Flying fish\n* Kentucky meat shower\n* Lluvia de Peces, (Honduras, \"Fish rain\")\n* Raining cats and dogs\n* Red rain in Kerala\n* Star jelly\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Can it rain frogs, fish or other objects\". *Library of Congress*. 26 August 2010.\n2. **^** How can it rain fish?

It is located about one degree of latitude (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca to the west, the Singapore Strait to the south, the South China Sea to the east, and the Straits of Johor to the north. The country's territory comprises one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet; the combined area of these has increased by approximately 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. It has the second highest population density of any country in the world, although there are numerous green and recreational spaces as a result of urban planning. With a multicultural population and in recognition of the cultural identities of the major ethnic groups within the nation, Singapore has four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. English is the lingua franca, with its exclusive use in numerous public services. Multi-racialism is enshrined in the constitution and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and politics.\n\n\nSingapore's history dates back at least eight hundred years, having been a maritime emporium known as *Temasek* and subsequently a major constituent part of several successive thalassocratic empires. Its contemporary era began in 1819, when Stamford Raffles established Singapore as an entrep\u00f4t trading post of the British Empire. In 1867, the colonies in Southeast Asia were reorganised, and Singapore came under the direct control of Britain as part of the Straits Settlements. During World War II, Singapore was occupied by Japan in 1942 and returned to British control as a separate Crown colony following Japan's surrender in 1945. Singapore gained self-governance in 1959 and, in 1963, became part of the new federation of Malaysia, alongside Malaya, North Borneo, and Sarawak. Ideological differences, most notably the perceived encroachment of the egalitarian \"Malaysian Malaysia\" political ideology led by Lee Kuan Yew into the other constituent entities of Malaysia\u2014at the perceived expense of the *bumiputera* and the policies of *Ketuanan Melayu*\u2014eventually led to Singapore's expulsion from the federation two years later; Singapore became an independent sovereign country in 1965.\n\n\nAfter early years of turbulence and despite lacking natural resources and a hinterland, the nation rapidly developed to become one of the Four Asian Tigers. With its growth based on international trade and economic globalisation, it integrated itself with the world economy through free trade with minimal-to-no trade barriers or tariffs, export-oriented industrialisation, and the large accumulation of received foreign direct investments, foreign exchange reserves, and assets held by sovereign wealth funds. As a highly developed country, it has the highest GDP per capita (PPP) in the world. Identified as a tax haven, Singapore is the only country in Asia with a AAA sovereign credit rating from all major rating agencies. It is a major aviation, financial, and maritime shipping hub and has consistently been ranked as one of the most expensive cities to live in for expatriates and foreign workers. Singapore ranks highly in key social indicators: education, healthcare, quality of life, personal safety, infrastructure, and housing, with a home-ownership rate of 88 percent. Singaporeans enjoy one of the longest life expectancies, fastest Internet connection speeds, lowest infant mortality rates, and lowest levels of corruption in the world.\n\n\nSingapore is a unitary parliamentary republic with a Westminster system of unicameral parliamentary government, and its legal system is based on common law. While the country is a multi-party democracy with free elections, the government under the People's Action Party (PAP) wields significant control and dominance over politics and society. The PAP has governed the country continuously since full internal self-government was achieved in 1959, currently holding 79 out of 93 elected seats in Parliament. One of the five founding members of ASEAN, Singapore is also the headquarters of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Secretariat, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council Secretariat, and is the host city of many international conferences and events. Singapore is also a member of the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the East Asia Summit, the Non-Aligned Movement, and the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\n\n\n\n## Name and etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Singapore\n\nThe English name of \"Singapore\" is an anglicisation of the native Malay name for the country, *Singapura* (pronounced [si\u014bapura]), which was in turn derived from the Sanskrit word for 'lion city' (Sanskrit: \u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939\u092a\u0941\u0930; romanised: *Si\u1e43hapura*; Brahmi: \ud804\udc32\ud804\udc3a\ud804\udc01\ud804\udc33\ud804\udc27\ud804\udc3c\ud804\udc2d; literally \"lion city\"; *si\u1e43ha* means 'lion', *pura* means 'city' or 'fortress' ).[10] Pulau Ujong was one of the earliest references to Singapore Island, which corresponds to a Chinese account from the third century referred to a place as *P\u00fa Lu\u00f3 Zh\u014dng* (Chinese: \u84b2 \u7f85 \u4e2d), a transcription of the Malay name for 'island at the end of a peninsula'.[11] Early references to the name Temasek (or Tumasik) are found in the Nagarakretagama, a Javanese eulogy written in 1365, and a Vietnamese source from the same time period. The name possibly means *Sea Town*, being derived from the Malay *tasek*, meaning 'sea' or 'lake'.[12] The Chinese traveller Wang Dayuan visited a place around 1330 named *Danmaxi* (Chinese: \u6de1\u99ac\u932b; pinyin: *D\u00e0nm\u01cex\u00ed*; Wade\u2013Giles: *Tan Ma Hsi*) or *Tam ma siak*, depending on pronunciation; this may be a transcription of Temasek, alternatively, it may be a combination of the Malay *Tanah* meaning 'land' and Chinese *xi* meaning 'tin', which was traded on the island.[13][12]\n\n\nVariations of the name *Si\u1e43hapura* were used for a number of cities throughout the region prior to the establishment of the Kingdom of Singapura. In Hindu\u2013Buddhist culture, lions were associated with power and protection, which may explain the attraction of such a name.[14][15] The name *Singapura* supplanted Temasek sometime before the 15th century, after the establishment of the Kingdom of Singapura on the island by a fleeing Sumatran *Raja* (prince) from Palembang. However, the precise time and reason for the name change is unknown. The semi-historical Malay Annals state that Temasek was christened *Singapura* by Sang Nila Utama, a 13th-century Sumatran *Raja* from Palembang. The Annals state that Sang Nila Utama encountered a strange beast on the island that he took to be a lion. Seeing this as an omen, he established the town of *Singapura* where he encountered the beast.[16]:\u200a37,\u200a88\u201392[17]:\u200a30\u201331 The second hypothesis, drawn from Portuguese sources, postulates that this mythical story is based on the real life Parameswara of Palembang. Parameswara declared independence from Majapahit and mounted a Lion Throne. After then being driven into exile by the Javanese, he usurped control over Temasek. It is possible that he rechristened the area as *Singapura*, recalling the throne he had been driven from.[18]\n\n\nUnder Japanese occupation, Singapore was renamed *Syonan* (Japanese: \u662d \u5357, Hepburn: *Sh\u014dnan*), meaning 'light of the south'.[19][20] Singapore is sometimes referred to by the nickname the \"Garden City\", in reference to its parks and tree-lined streets.[21] Another informal name, the \"Little Red Dot\", was adopted after an article in the *Asian Wall Street Journal* of 4 August 1998 said that Indonesian President B. J. Habibie referred to Singapore as a red dot on a map.[22][23][24][25]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Singapore\n\n### Ancient Singapore[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Early history of Singapore\n\nIn 1299, according to the Malay Annals, the Kingdom of Singapura was founded on the island by Sang Nila Utama.[26] Although the historicity of the accounts as given in the Malay Annals is the subject of academic debates,[27] it is nevertheless known from various documents that Singapore in the 14th century, then known as Temasek, was a trading port under the influence of both the Majapahit Empire and the Siamese kingdoms,[28] and was a part of the Indosphere.[29][30][31][32][33] These Indianised kingdoms were characterised by surprising resilience, political integrity and administrative stability.[34] Historical sources also indicate that around the end of the 14th century, its ruler Parameswara was attacked by either the Majapahit or the Siamese, forcing him to move to Malacca where he founded the Sultanate of Malacca.[35] Archaeological evidence suggests that the main settlement on Fort Canning was abandoned around this time, although a small trading settlement continued in Singapore for some time afterwards.[18] In 1613, Portuguese raiders burned down the settlement, and the island faded into obscurity for the next two centuries.[36] By then, Singapore was nominally part of the Johor Sultanate.[37] The wider maritime region and much trade was under Dutch control for the following period after the Dutch conquest of Malacca.[38]\n\n\n\n### British colonisation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Founding of modern Singapore and Singapore in the Straits Settlements\n\n![](image)Letter from William Farquhar to Sultan Muhammad Kanzul Alam, the 21st Sultan of Brunei, dated 28 November 1819. In the first line, Farquhar mentions that Sultan Hussein Shah and Temenggong Abdul Rahman allowed the British East India Company to establish a factory in Singapore on 6 February 1819.[39][40]\nThe British governor Stamford Raffles arrived in Singapore on 28 January 1819 and soon recognised the island as a natural choice for the new port.[41] The island was then nominally ruled by Tengku Abdul Rahman, the Sultan of Johor, who was controlled by the Dutch and the Bugis.[42] However, the Sultanate was weakened by factional division: Abdul Rahman, the Temenggong of Johor to Tengku Abdul Rahman, as well as his officials, were loyal to the Sultan's elder brother Tengku Long, who was living in exile in Penyengat Island, Riau Islands. With the Temenggong's help, Raffles managed to smuggle Tengku Long back into Singapore. Raffles offered to recognise Tengku Long as the rightful Sultan of Johor, under the title of Sultan Hussein, as well as provide him with a yearly payment of $5000 and another $3000 to the Temenggong; in return, Sultan Hussein would grant the British the right to establish a trading post on Singapore.[43] The Treaty of Singapore was signed on 6 February 1819.[44][45]\n\n\n\n![](image)1825 survey map. Singapore's free port trade was at Singapore River for 150 years. Fort Canning hill (centre) was home to its ancient and early colonial rulers.\nIn 1824, a further treaty with the Sultan led to the entire island becoming a British possession.[46] In 1826, Singapore became part of the Straits Settlements, then under the jurisdiction of British India. Singapore became the regional capital in 1836.[47] Prior to Raffles' arrival, there were only about a thousand people living on the island, mostly indigenous Malays along with a handful of Chinese.[48] By 1860 the population had swelled to over 80,000, more than half being Chinese.[46] Many of these early immigrants came to work on the pepper and gambier plantations.[49] In 1867, the Straits Settlements were separated from British India, coming under the direct control of Britain.[50] Later, in the 1890s, when the rubber industry became established in Malaya and Singapore,[51] the island became a global centre for rubber sorting and export.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Panorama of Singapore at sunrise, 1865, lithograph by Vincent Brooks.\nSingapore was not greatly affected by the First World War (1914\u201318), as the conflict did not spread to Southeast Asia. The only significant event during the war was the 1915 Singapore Mutiny by Muslim sepoys from British India, who were garrisoned in Singapore.[52] After hearing rumours that they were to be sent to fight the Ottoman Empire, a Muslim state, the soldiers rebelled, killing their officers and several British civilians before the mutiny was suppressed by non-Muslim troops arriving from Johore and Burma.[53]\n\n\nAfter World War I, the British built the large Singapore Naval Base as part of the defensive Singapore strategy.[54] Originally announced in 1921, the construction of the base proceeded at a slow pace until the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. Costing $60\u00a0million and not fully completed in 1938, it was nonetheless the largest dry dock in the world, the third-largest floating dock, and had enough fuel tanks to support the entire British navy for six months.[54][55][56] The base was defended by heavy 15-inch (380\u00a0mm) naval guns stationed at Fort Siloso, Fort Canning and Labrador, as well as a Royal Air Force airfield at Tengah Air Base. Winston Churchill touted it as the \"Gibraltar of the East\", and military discussions often referred to the base as simply \"East of Suez\". However, the British Home Fleet was stationed in Europe, and the British could not afford to build a second fleet to protect their interests in Asia. The plan was for the Home Fleet to sail quickly to Singapore in the event of an emergency. As a consequence, after World War II broke out in 1939, the fleet was fully occupied with defending Britain, leaving Singapore vulnerable to Japanese invasion.[57][58]\n\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japanese occupation of Singapore\n\n![](image)British evacuation in 1945 after the Japanese surrender. Kallang Airport's control tower near the city has been conserved.\nDuring the Pacific War, the Japanese invasion of Malaya culminated in the Battle of Singapore. When the British force of 60,000 troops surrendered on 15 February 1942, British prime minister Winston Churchill called the defeat \"the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history\".[59] British and Empire losses during the fighting for Singapore were heavy, with a total of nearly 85,000 personnel captured.[60] About 5,000 were killed or wounded,[61] of which Australians made up the majority.[62][63][64] Japanese casualties during the fighting in Singapore amounted to 1,714 killed and 3,378 wounded.[60][e] The occupation was to become a major turning point in the histories of several nations, including those of Japan, Britain, and Singapore. Japanese newspapers triumphantly declared the victory as deciding the general situation of the war.[65][66] Between 5,000 and 25,000 ethnic Chinese people were killed in the subsequent Sook Ching massacre.[67] British forces had planned to liberate Singapore in 1945; however, the war ended before these operations could be carried out.[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Post-war period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colony of Singapore\n\nAfter the Japanese surrender to the Allies on 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder; looting and revenge-killing were widespread. British, Australian, and Indian troops led by Lord Louis Mountbatten returned to Singapore to receive the formal surrender of Japanese forces in the region from General Seishir\u014d Itagaki on behalf of General Hisaichi Terauchi on 12 September 1945.[68][69] Meanwhile, Tomoyuki Yamashita was tried by a US military commission for war crimes, but not for crimes committed by his troops in Malaya or Singapore. He was convicted and hanged in the Philippines on 23 February 1946.[70][71]\n\n\nMuch of Singapore's infrastructure had been destroyed during the war, including those needed to supply utilities. A shortage of food led to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. A series of strikes in 1947 caused massive stoppages in public transport and other services. However, by late 1947 the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing international demand for tin and rubber.[72] The failure of Britain to successfully defend its colony against the Japanese changed its image in the eyes of Singaporeans. British Military Administration ended on 1 April 1946, and Singapore became a separate Crown Colony.[72] In July 1947, separate Executive and Legislative Councils were established and the election of six members of the Legislative Council was scheduled for the following year.[73]\n\n\nDuring the 1950s, Chinese communists, with strong ties to the trade unions and Chinese schools, waged a guerrilla war against the government, leading to the Malayan Emergency. The 1954 National Service riots, Hock Lee bus riots, and Chinese middle schools riots in Singapore were all linked to these events.[74] David Marshall, pro-independence leader of the Labour Front, won Singapore's first general election in 1955.[75] He led a delegation to London, and Britain rejected his demand for complete self-rule. He resigned and was replaced by Lim Yew Hock in 1956, and after further negotiations Britain agreed to grant Singapore full internal self-government for all matters except defence and foreign affairs.[76] During the subsequent May 1959 elections, the People's Action Party (PAP) won a landslide victory.[77] Governor Sir William Allmond Codrington Goode served as the first Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Head of State).[78]\n\n\n\n### Within Malaysia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Singapore in Malaysia\n\n![](image)Singapore thrived as an entrep\u00f4t. In the 1960s, bumboats were used to transport cargoes and supplies between nearshore ships and Singapore River.\nPAP leaders believed that Singapore's future lay with Malaya, due to strong ties between the two. It was thought that reuniting with Malaya would benefit the economy by creating a common market, alleviating ongoing unemployment woes in Singapore. However, a sizeable pro-communist wing of the PAP was strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a loss of influence, and hence formed the Barisan Sosialis, splitting from the PAP.[79][80] The ruling party of Malaya, United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), was staunchly anti-communist, and it was suspected UMNO would support the non-communist factions of PAP. UMNO, initially sceptical of the idea of a merger due to distrust of the PAP government and concern that the large ethnic Chinese population in Singapore would alter the racial balance in Malaya on which their political power base depended, became supportive of the idea of the merger due to joint fear of a communist takeover.[81]\n\n\nOn 27 May 1961, Malaya's prime minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, made a surprise proposal for a new Federation called Malaysia, which would unite the current and former British possessions in the region: the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei, North Borneo, and Sarawak.[81][82] UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Bornean territories would balance Singapore's Chinese population.[76] The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming a haven for communism.[83] To obtain a mandate for a merger, the PAP held a referendum on the merger. This referendum included a choice of different terms for a merger with Malaysia and had no option for avoiding merger altogether.[84][85] On 16 September 1963, Singapore joined with Malaya, the North Borneo, and Sarawak to form the new Federation of Malaysia under the terms of the Malaysia Agreement.[86] Under this Agreement, Singapore had a relatively high level of autonomy compared to the other states of Malaysia.[87]\n\n\nIndonesia opposed the formation of Malaysia due to its own claims over Borneo and launched *Konfrontasi* (\"Confrontation\" in Indonesian) in response to the formation of Malaysia.[88] On 10 March 1965, a bomb planted by Indonesian saboteurs on a mezzanine floor of MacDonald House exploded, killing three people and injuring 33 others. It was the deadliest of at least 42 bomb incidents which occurred during the confrontation.[89] Two members of the Indonesian Marine Corps, Osman bin Haji Mohamed Ali and Harun bin Said, were eventually convicted and executed for the crime.[90] The explosion caused US$250,000 (equivalent to US$2,417,107 in 2023) in damages to MacDonald House.[91][92]\n\n\nEven after the merger, the Singaporean government and the Malaysian central government disagreed on many political and economic issues.[93] Despite an agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore did not extend to Sabah and Sarawak the full extent of the loans agreed to for economic development of the two eastern states. Talks soon broke down, and abusive speeches and writing became rife on both sides. This led to communal strife in Singapore, culminating in the 1964 race riots.[94] On 7 August 1965, Malaysian prime minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed (and with the help of secret negotiations by PAP leaders, as revealed in 2015)[95] advised the Parliament of Malaysia that it should vote to expel Singapore from Malaysia.[93] On 9 August 1965, the Malaysian Parliament voted 126 to 0 to move a bill to amend the constitution, expelling Singapore from Malaysia, which left Singapore as a newly independent country.[76][96][97][98][99][95]\n\n\n\n### Republic of Singapore[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Independence of Singapore Agreement 1965\n\n![](image)Lee Kuan Yew, the first prime minister of Singapore.\nAfter being expelled from Malaysia, Singapore became independent as the Republic of Singapore on 9 August 1965,[100][101] with Lee Kuan Yew and Yusof bin Ishak as the first prime minister and president respectively.[102][103] In 1967, the country co-founded the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).[104] Race riots broke out once more in 1969.[105] Lee Kuan Yew's emphasis on rapid economic growth, support for business entrepreneurship, and limitations on internal democracy shaped Singapore's policies for the next half-century.[106][107] Economic growth continued throughout the 1980s, with the unemployment rate falling to 3% and real GDP growth averaging at about 8% up until 1999. During the 1980s, Singapore began to shift towards high-tech industries, such as the wafer fabrication sector, in order to remain competitive as neighbouring countries began manufacturing with cheaper labour. Singapore Changi Airport was opened in 1981 and Singapore Airlines was formed.[108] The Port of Singapore became one of the world's busiest ports and the service and tourism industries also grew immensely during this period.[109][110]\n\n\nThe PAP has remained in power since independence. Some activists and opposition politicians see the government's strict regulation of political and media activities as an infringement on political rights.[111] In response, Singapore has seen several significant political changes, such as the introduction of the non-constituency members of parliament in 1984 to allow up to three losing candidates from opposition parties to be appointed as MPs. Group representation constituencies (GRCs) were introduced in 1988 to create multi-seat electoral divisions, intended to ensure minority representation in parliament.[112] Nominated members of parliament were introduced in 1990 to allow non-elected non-partisan MPs.[113] The constitution was amended in 1991 to provide for an elected president who has veto power in the use of past reserves and appointments to certain public offices.[114]\n\n\nIn 1990, Goh Chok Tong succeeded Lee and became Singapore's second prime minister.[115] During Goh's tenure, the country went through the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2003 SARS outbreak.[116][117] In 2004, Lee Hsien Loong, the eldest son of Lee Kuan Yew, became the country's third prime minister.[117] Lee Hsien Loong's tenure included the 2008 global financial crisis, the resolution of a dispute over land ownership at Tanjong Pagar railway station between Singapore and Malaysia, and the introduction of the two integrated resorts (IRs), located at the Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa.[118] The PAP suffered its worst ever electoral results in 2011, winning just 60% of votes, amidst debate over issues including the influx of foreign workers and the high cost of living.[119] On 23 March 2015, Lee Kuan Yew died, and a one-week period of public mourning was observed nationwide.[107] Subsequently, the PAP regained its dominance in Parliament through the September general election, receiving 69.9% of the popular vote,[120] although this remained lower than the 2001 tally of 75.3%[121] and the 1968 tally of 86.7%.[122] The 2020 election held in July saw the PAP drop to 61% of the vote, while the Workers' Party took 10 of the 93 seats, the highest number ever won by another party.[123]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Singapore, Politics of Singapore, and Administrative divisions of Singapore\n\n![](image)The Istana is the official residence and office of the president, as well as the working office of the prime minister.\n![](image)The Supreme Court (left) and the Parliament House (right) where the Singapore Parliament convenes\n![](image)The Speakers' Corner at Hong Lim Park provides a public demonstration area, which are often restricted in other parts of the country.\nSingapore is a parliamentary republic based on the Westminster system. The Constitution of Singapore is the supreme law of the country, establishing the structure and responsibility of governance. The President is the head of state.[124][125] The governance of Singapore is separated into three branches:\n\n\n\n* Executive: The executive consists of the cabinet, led by the prime minister, and the Attorney General's Chambers led by the Attorney-General.[126] The cabinet is collectively responsible for all government policies and the day-to-day administration of the affairs of state. It is typically composed of members of the Singapore Parliament. The prime minister is appointed by the President, and the ministers in the cabinet and the attorney-general are appointed by the president, acting on the advice and consent of the prime minister. The prime minister is the effective head of the executive branch of government.[127][124]\n\n\n* Legislature: The Singapore Parliament is unicameral and, together with the president, comprises the legislature.[128] Members of Parliament (MP) consist of elected, non-constituency, and nominated members. The majority of MPs are elected into parliament at a general election. The Singapore Parliament is collectively responsible for enacting the laws governing the state.[124] The president holds limited discretionary powers of oversight over the government. The president's veto powers are further subject to parliamentary overruling.[129][130]\n\n\n* Judiciary: The judiciary's function is to independently administer justice and is headed by the Chief Justice. The judges and judicial commissioners are appointed by the president on the advice of the prime minister.[131] The Supreme Court and State Courts adjudicates in civil disputes between persons, convicts or acquits accused persons in criminal prosecutions, and interprets laws to decide on its constitutionality. Any law or provision of a law found to be unconstitutional can be struck down by the Supreme Court.[132]\n\n\nThe president is directly elected by popular vote for a renewable six-year term. Requirements for this position, which were enacted by the PAP government, are extremely stringent, such that only a handful of people qualify for the candidacy.[133][134] These qualifications include that a candidate needs to be a person at least 45 years of age who is no longer a member of a political party, to either have held public office for at least 3 years in a number of specific public service leadership roles, or to have 3 years experience as chief executive of a fully profitable private sector company with at least S$500 million in shareholders' equity, be a resident in Singapore for at least 10 years, not have a criminal record, and more.[135][134][136] Candidates must also \"satisfy\" the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC) that he or she is a person of integrity, good character and reputation.\n\n\nThe Constitution requires that presidential elections be \"reserved\" for a racial community if no one from that ethnic group has been elected to the presidency in the five most recent terms.[137] Only members of that community may qualify as candidates in a reserved presidential election.[138] In the 2017 presidential election, this combination of stringent requirements and a reserved election that required the candidate to be of the 13% Malay ethnic group led to the PEC approving a single candidate for the presidency;[139] Halimah Yacob, considered part of the Malay community, won in an uncontested election. She also became Singapore's first female president.\n\n\nMembers of Parliament (MPs) are elected at least every five years (or sooner with a snap election). The 14th and current Parliament has 103 members; 93 were directly elected from the 31 constituencies, nine are nonpartisan nominated members appointed by the president, and three are non-constituency members from opposition parties who were not elected in the last general election but appointed to the legislature to increase opposition party representation. In group representation constituencies (GRCs), political parties assemble teams of candidates to contest elections. At least one MP in a GRC must be of an ethnic minority background. All elections are held using first-past-the-post voting.[140] MPs host weekly political surgeries, called \"Meet-the-People Sessions\", where they help constituents resolve personal issues which can be related to housing, financial assistance, and immigration.[141]\n\n\nThe People's Action Party occupies a dominant position in Singaporean politics, having won large parliamentary majorities in every election since self-governance was granted in 1959. The PAP, self-described as pragmatic, have a syncretic ideology combining free-market principles, civil nationalism, and welfarism.[142][143][144] Despite promulgating restrictions on civil liberties, Singapore under the PAP has seen consistent economic growth and political stability.[145] The most represented and popular opposition party is the Workers' Party.[123]\n\n\nThe judicial system is based on English common law, continuing the legal tradition established during British rule and with substantial local differences. Criminal law is based on the Indian Penal Code originally intended for British India, and was at the time as a crown colony also adopted by the British colonial authorities in Singapore and remains the basis of the criminal code in the country with a few exceptions, amendments and repeals since it came into force.[146] Trial by jury was abolished in 1970.[147] Both corporal punishment (caning)[148][149] and capital punishment (by hanging) are legal penalties.[150]\n\n\nThe right to freedom of speech and association is guaranteed by Article 14(1) of the Constitution of Singapore, although there are provisions in the subsequent subsection that regulate them.[151] The government has restricted freedom of speech and freedom of the press as well as some civil and political rights.[152] In 2023, Singapore was ranked 129th out of 180 nations by Reporters Without Borders on the global Press Freedom Index.[153] Freedom House ranks Singapore as \"partly free\" in its *Freedom in the World* report,[154][145] and the Economist Intelligence Unit ranks Singapore as a \"flawed democracy\", the second freest rank of four, in its \"Democracy Index\".[155][156] All public gatherings of five or more people require police permits, and protests may legally be held only at the Speakers' Corner.[157]\n\n\nIn the Corruption Perceptions Index, which ranks countries by \"perceived levels of public sector corruption\", Singapore has consistently ranked as one of the least corrupt countries in the world.[158] Singapore's unique combination of a strong, almost authoritarian, government with an emphasis on meritocracy and good governance is known as the \"Singapore model\", and is regarded as a key factor behind Singapore's political stability, economic growth, and harmonious social order.[159][160][161][162] In 2021, the World Justice Project's Rule of Law Index ranked Singapore as 17th overall among the world's 193 countries for adherence to the rule of law. Singapore ranked high on the factors of order and security (#3), absence of corruption (#3), regulatory enforcement (#4), civil justice (#8), and criminal justice (#7), and ranked significantly lower on factors of open government (#34), constraints on government powers (#32), and fundamental rights (#38).[163]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Singapore\n\n![](image)Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the 2017 G20 meeting in Germany. Since 2010, Singapore has often been invited to participate in G20 processes.\nSingapore's stated foreign policy priority is maintaining security in Southeast Asia and surrounding territories. An underlying principle is political and economic stability in the region.[164] It has diplomatic relations with more than 180 sovereign states.[165]\n\n\nAs one of the five founding members of ASEAN,[166] Singapore is a strong supporter of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the ASEAN Investment Area (AIA); it is also the host of the APEC Secretariat.[167] Singapore maintains membership in other regional organisations, such as Asia\u2013Europe Meeting, the Forum for East Asia-Latin American Cooperation, the Indian Ocean Rim Association, and the East Asia Summit.[164] It is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement,[168] the United Nations and the Commonwealth.[169][170] While Singapore is not a formal member of the G20, it has been invited to participate in G20 processes in most years since 2010.[171] Singapore is also the location of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) Secretariat.[172]\n\n\nIn general, bilateral relations with other ASEAN members are strong; however, disagreements have arisen,[173] and relations with neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia have sometimes been strained.[174] Malaysia and Singapore have clashed over the delivery of fresh water to Singapore,[175] and access by the Singapore Armed Forces to Malaysian airspace.[174] Border issues exist with Malaysia and Indonesia, and both have banned the sale of marine sand to Singapore over disputes about Singapore's land reclamation.[176] Some previous disputes, such as the Pedra Branca dispute, have been resolved by the International Court of Justice.[177] Piracy in the Strait of Malacca has been a cause of concern for all three countries.[175] Close economic ties exist with Brunei, and the two share a pegged currency value, through a Currency Interchangeability Agreement between the two countries which makes both Brunei dollar and Singapore dollar banknotes and coins legal tender in either country.[178][179]\n\n\nThe first diplomatic contact with China was made in the 1970s, with full diplomatic relations established in the 1990s. China has been Singapore's largest trading partner since 2013, after surpassing Malaysia.[180][181][182][183][184] Singapore and the United States share a long-standing close relationship, in particular in defence, the economy, health, and education. Singapore has also increased co-operation with ASEAN members and China to strengthen regional security and fight terrorism, and participated in ASEAN's first joint maritime exercise with China in 2018.[185] It has also given support to the US-led coalition to fight terrorism, with bilateral co-operation in counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation initiatives, and joint military exercises.[173]\n\n\nAs Singapore has diplomatic relations with both the United States and North Korea, and was one of the few countries that have relationships with both countries,[186] in June 2018, it hosted a historic summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the first-ever meeting between the sitting leaders of the two nations.[187][188] It also hosted the Ma\u2013Xi meeting in 2015, the first meeting between the political leaders of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1950.[189][190][191]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Singapore Armed Forces\n\n![](image)In 2007, military personnel from the Singapore Armed Forces were deployed in Afghanistan as part of a multinational coalition.\nThe Singaporean military, arguably the most technologically advanced in Southeast Asia,[192] consists of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the Digital and Intelligence Service. It is seen as the guarantor of the country's independence,[193] translating into Singapore culture, involving all citizens in the country's defence.[194] The government spends 4.9% of the country's GDP on the military\u2014high by regional standards[192]\u2014and one out of every four dollars of government spending is spent on defence.[195]\n\n\nAfter its independence, Singapore had only two infantry regiments commanded by British officers. Considered too small to provide effective security for the new country, the development of its military forces became a priority.[196] In addition, in October 1971, Britain pulled its military out of Singapore, leaving behind only a small British, Australian and New Zealand force as a token military presence.[197] A great deal of initial support came from Israel,[196] a country unrecognised by Singapore's neighbouring Muslim-majority nations of Malaysia and Indonesia.[198][199][200] The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) commanders were tasked by the Singapore Government to create the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) from scratch, and Israeli instructors were brought in to train Singaporean soldiers. Military courses were conducted according to the IDF's format, and Singapore adopted a system of conscription and reserve service based on the Israeli model.[196] Singapore still maintains strong security ties with Israel and is one of the biggest buyers of Israeli arms and weapons systems,[201] with one recent example being the MATADOR anti-tank weapon.[202]\n\n\nThe SAF is being developed to respond to a wide range of issues in both conventional and unconventional warfare. The Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) is responsible for procuring resources for the military.[203] The geographic restrictions of Singapore mean that the SAF must plan to fully repulse an attack, as they cannot fall back and re-group. The small size of the population has also affected the way the SAF has been designed, with a small active force and a large number of reserves.[194]\n\n\n\n![](image)Republic of Singapore Air Force Black Knights perform at the Singapore Air Show.\nSingapore has conscription for all able-bodied males at age 18, except those with a criminal record or who can prove that their loss would bring hardship to their families. Males who have yet to complete pre-university education, are awarded the Public Service Commission (PSC) scholarship, or are pursuing a local medical degree can opt to defer their draft.[204][205] Though not required to perform military service, the number of women in the SAF has been increasing: since 1989 they have been allowed to fill military vocations formerly reserved for men. Before induction into a specific branch of the armed forces, recruits undergo at least nine weeks of basic military training.[206]\n\n\nBecause of the scarcity of open land on the main island, training involving activities such as live firing and amphibious warfare are often carried out on smaller islands, typically barred to civilian access. However, large-scale drills, considered too dangerous to be performed in the country, have been performed in other countries such as Brunei, Indonesia, Thailand and the United States. In general, military exercises are held with foreign forces once or twice per week.[194] Due to airspace and land constraints, the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) maintains a number of overseas bases in Australia, the United States, and France. The RSAF's 130 Squadron is based in RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia,[207] and its 126 Squadron is based in the Oakey Army Aviation Centre, Queensland.[208] The RSAF has one squadron\u2014the 150 Squadron\u2014based in Cazaux Air Base in southern France.[209] The RSAF's overseas detachments in the United States are: Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, Marana in Arizona, Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, and Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.[210][211][212]\n\n\nThe SAF has sent forces to assist in operations outside the country, in areas such as Iraq,[213] and Afghanistan,[214][215] in both military and civilian roles. In the region, they have helped to stabilise East Timor and have provided aid to Aceh in Indonesia following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Since 2009, the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) has deployed ships to the Gulf of Aden to aid in countering piracy efforts as part of Task Force 151.[216] The SAF also helped in relief efforts during Hurricane Katrina,[217] and Typhoon Haiyan.[218] Singapore is part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA), a military alliance with Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.[194] In 2023, Singapore was ranked the 6th most peaceful country on the Global Peace Index.[219]\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Human rights in Singapore\n\nSee also: Abortion in Singapore, Capital punishment in Singapore, and LGBT rights in Singapore\n\nCapital punishment is a legal and enforced penalty in Singapore. The country is one of four in the developed world to retain the death penalty, along with the United States, Japan and Taiwan. Particularly, its use against drug trafficking has been a source of contention with various non-governmental organisations[*who?*], regarded by some as a victimless crime.[*citation needed*] The government has responded that it has \"no doubts\" that it is the right policy and that there is \"clear evidence\" of serious deterrence, and that the law should be looked at upon in the wider context of \"saving lives\", particularly citizens.[220] In 2004, Amnesty International claimed that some legal provisions of the Singapore system for the death penalty conflict with \"the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty\".[221] The government has disputed Amnesty's claims, stating that their \"position on abolition of the death penalty is by no means uncontested internationally\" and that the report contains \"grave errors of facts and misrepresentations\".[222]\n\n\nFrom 1938 to 2022, sexual relations between men were technically illegal under Section 377A of the Penal Code, first introduced during British colonial rule.[223] During the last few decades, the law was unenforced and pressure to repeal this law increased as homosexuality became more understood.[224] Meanwhile, sexual relations between women had always been legal.[225] In 2022, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that Singapore would scrap 377A for good, effectively decriminalising homosexual behaviour. Nevertheless, he added that the repeal will not affect the recognition of \"traditional familial and societal norms\", including how marriage is defined\u2014putting the legalisation of same-sex marriage on the back-burner at least for now, although the possibility of civil unions was not officially ruled out.[226] He added this was a compromise between the conservative (and often religious) and progressive elements of Singaporean society to prevent fracturing it.[227]\n\n\nPink Dot SG, an event held in support of the LGBT community, has drawn thousands of people annually since 2009 with increasing attendance.[228] According to a survey conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies in 2019, Singaporean society has become more liberal on LGBT rights. In the survey, more than 20% of people said that sexual relations between adults of the same sex were not wrong at all or not wrong most of the time, up from 10% in 2013. The survey found that 27% felt the same way about same-sex marriage (an increase from 15% in 2013) and 30% did so about same-sex couples adopting a child (an increase from 24% in 2013).[229][230] In 2021, 6 Singaporeans protested for improved trans protections in the educational system outside the Ministry of Education headquarters at Buona Vista.[231]\n\n\nPimps often traffic women from neighbouring countries such as China, Malaysia and Vietnam at their brothels as well as rented apartments and hostels for higher profit margins when they get a cut from customers.[232][233] In response, amendments were made to the Women's Charter by the government in 2019 to legislate more serious punishments for traffickers, including imprisonment of up to seven years and a fine of S$100,000.[234]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Singapore\n\n![](image)Skyline of Singapore's Downtown Core\nSingapore has a highly developed market economy, based historically on extended entrep\u00f4t trade. Along with Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan, Singapore is one of the Four Asian Tigers, and has surpassed its peers in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. Between 1965 and 1995, growth rates averaged around 6 per cent per annum, transforming the living standards of the population.[235]\n\n\nThe Singaporean economy is regarded as free,[236] innovative,[237]\ndynamic[238] and business-friendly.[239] For several years, Singapore has been one of the few[240] countries with an AAA credit rating from the big three, and the only Asian country to achieve this rating.[241] Singapore attracts a large amount of foreign investment as a result of its location, skilled workforce, low tax rates, advanced infrastructure and zero-tolerance against corruption.[242] It was the world's 4th most competitive economy in 2023, according to the International Institute for Management Development's World Competitiveness Ranking of 64 countries,[243] with the highest GDP (PPP) per capita.[244][245][246] Roughly 44 percent of the Singaporean workforce is made up of non-Singaporeans.[247] Despite market freedom, Singapore's government operations have a significant stake in the economy, contributing 22% of the GDP.[248] The city is a popular location for conferences and events.[249]\n\n\n\n![Singapore Airlines celebrated the nation's Golden Jubilee with a flag livery on its Airbus A380](image)Singapore Airlines, the country's flag carrier, celebrated the nation's 2015 Golden Jubilee with a flag livery on its Airbus A380.\nThe currency of Singapore is the Singapore dollar (SGD or S$), issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).[250] It has been interchangeable with the Brunei dollar at par value since 1967.[251] MAS manages its monetary policy by allowing the Singapore dollar exchange rate to rise or fall within an undisclosed trading band. This is different from most central banks, which use interest rates to manage policy.[252] Singapore has the world's eleventh largest foreign reserves,[253] and one of the highest net international investment position per capita.[254][255]\n\n\nSingapore has been identified as a tax haven[256] for the wealthy due to its low tax rates on personal income and tax exemptions on foreign-based income and capital gains. Individuals such as Australian millionaire retailer Brett Blundy and multi-billionaire Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin are two examples of wealthy individuals who have settled in Singapore.[257] In 2009, Singapore was removed from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \"liste grise\" of tax havens,[258] and ranked fourth on the Tax Justice Network's 2015 Financial Secrecy Index of the world's off-shore financial service providers, banking one-eighth of the world's offshore capital, while \"providing numerous tax avoidance and evasion opportunities\".[259] In August 2016, *The Straits Times* reported that Indonesia had decided to create tax havens on two islands near Singapore to bring Indonesian capital back into the tax base.[260] In October 2016, the Monetary Authority of Singapore admonished and fined UBS and DBS and withdrew Falcon Private Bank's banking licence for their alleged role in the Malaysian Sovereign Fund scandal.[261][262]\n\n\nIn 2016, Singapore was rated the world's most expensive city for the third consecutive year by the Economist Intelligence Unit,[263][264] and this remained true in 2018.[265] The government provides numerous assistance programmes to the homeless and needy through the Ministry of Social and Family Development, so acute poverty is rare. Some of the programmes include providing financial assistance to needy households, providing free medical care at government hospitals, and paying for children's tuition.[266][267][268] Other benefits include compensation for gym fees to encourage citizens to exercise,[269] up to S$166,000 as a baby bonus for each citizen,[270] heavily subsidised healthcare, financial aid for the disabled, the provision of reduced-cost laptops for poor students,[271] rebates for costs such as public transport[272] and utility bills, and more.[273][274] As of 2018 Singapore's ranking in the Human Development Index is 9th in the world, with an HDI value of 0.935.[275]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Singapore\n\nSee also: Land reclamation in Singapore\n\n![Map showing Singapore island and the territories belonging to Singapore and its neighbours](image)An outline of Singapore and the surrounding islands and waterways\nSingapore consists of 63 islands, including the main island, Pulau Ujong.[276] There are two man-made connections to Johor, Malaysia: the Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway in the north and the Tuas Second Link in the west. Jurong Island, Pulau Tekong, Pulau Ubin and Sentosa are the largest of Singapore's smaller islands. The highest natural point is Bukit Timah Hill at 163.63\u00a0m (537\u00a0ft).[277] Under British rule, Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands were part of Singapore, and both were transferred to Australia in 1957.[278][279][280] Pedra Branca is the nation's easternmost point.[281]\n\n\nLand reclamation projects have increased Singapore's land area from 580\u00a0km2 (220\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in the 1960s to 710\u00a0km2 (270\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) by 2015, an increase of some 22% (130\u00a0km2).[282] The country is projected to reclaim another 56\u00a0km2 (20\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[283] Some projects involve merging smaller islands through land reclamation to form larger, more functional and habitable islands, as has been done with Jurong Island.[284] The type of sand used in reclamation is found in rivers and beaches, rather than deserts, and is in great demand worldwide. In 2010 Singapore imported almost 15 million tons of sand for its projects, the demand being such that Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam have all restricted or barred the export of sand to Singapore in recent years. As a result, in 2016 Singapore switched to using polders for reclamation, in which an area is enclosed and then pumped dry.[285]\n\n\n\n### Nature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Singapore\n\n![](image)Singapore Botanic Gardens is a UNESCO World Heritage Site \u2013 one of three gardens in the world, and the only tropical garden, to be recognised as such.\nSingapore's urbanisation means that it has lost 95% of its historical forests,[286] and now over half of the naturally occurring fauna and flora in Singapore is present in nature reserves, such as the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, which comprise only 0.25% of Singapore's land area.[286] In 1967, to combat this decline in natural space, the government introduced the vision of making Singapore a \"garden city\",[287] aiming to improve quality of life.[288] Since then, nearly 10% of Singapore's land has been set aside for parks and nature reserves.[289] The government has created plans to preserve the country's remaining wildlife.[290] Singapore's well known gardens include the Singapore Botanic Gardens, a 161-year-old tropical garden and Singapore's first UNESCO World Heritage Site.[291]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSingapore has a tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen: *Af*) with no distinctive seasons, uniform temperature and pressure, high humidity, and abundant rainfall.[292][293] Temperatures usually range from 23 to 32\u00a0\u00b0C (73 to 90\u00a0\u00b0F). While temperature does not vary greatly throughout the year, there is a wetter monsoon season from November to February.[294]\n\n\nFrom July to October, there is often haze caused by bush fires in neighbouring Indonesia, usually from the island of Sumatra.[295] Singapore follows the GMT+8 time zone, one hour ahead of the typical zone for its geographical location.[296] This causes the sun to rise and set particularly late during February, where the sun rises at 7:15\u00a0am and sets around 7:20\u00a0pm. During July, the sun sets at around 7:15\u00a0pm. The earliest the sun rises and sets is in late October and early November when the sun rises at 6:46\u00a0am and sets at 6:50\u00a0pm.[297]\n\n\nSingapore recognises that climate change and rising sea levels in the decades ahead will have major implications for its low-lying coastline. It estimates that the nation will need to spend $100 billion over the course of the next century to address the issue. In its 2020 budget, the government set aside an initial $5 billion towards a Coastline and Flood Protection Fund.[298][299] Singapore is the first country in Southeast Asia to levy a carbon tax on its largest carbon-emitting corporations producing more than 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year, at $5 per ton.[300]\n\n\nTo reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels, it has ramped up deployment of solar panels on rooftops and vertical surfaces of buildings, and other initiatives like building one of the world's largest floating solar farms at Tengeh Reservoir in Tuas.[301]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Singapore (1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1929\u20131941 and 1948\u2013present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 36.0(96.8)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n | 36.5(97.7)\n | 35.0(95.0)\n | 34.0(93.2)\n | 34.2(93.6)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n | 34.6(94.3)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n | 33.8(92.8)\n | 36.0(96.8)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 30.6(87.1)\n | 31.5(88.7)\n | 32.2(90.0)\n | 32.4(90.3)\n | 32.3(90.1)\n | 31.9(89.4)\n | 31.4(88.5)\n | 31.4(88.5)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 31.8(89.2)\n | 31.2(88.2)\n | 30.5(86.9)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 27.8(82.0)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 28.5(83.3)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 28.0(82.4)\n | 27.9(82.2)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 27.8(82.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 24.6(76.3)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 25.4(77.7)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.2(77.4)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 24.6(76.3)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 20.7(69.3)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 20.7(69.3)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 221.6(8.72)\n | 105.1(4.14)\n | 151.7(5.97)\n | 164.3(6.47)\n | 164.3(6.47)\n | 135.3(5.33)\n | 146.6(5.77)\n | 146.9(5.78)\n | 124.9(4.92)\n | 168.3(6.63)\n | 252.3(9.93)\n | 331.9(13.07)\n | 2,113.2(83.20)\n |\n| Average rainy days (\u2265 0.2 mm) | 13\n | 9\n | 12\n | 15\n | 15\n | 13\n | 14\n | 14\n | 13\n | 15\n | 19\n | 19\n | 171\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 83.5\n | 81.2\n | 81.7\n | 82.6\n | 82.3\n | 80.9\n | 80.9\n | 80.7\n | 80.7\n | 81.5\n | 84.9\n | 85.5\n | 82.2\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 180.4\n | 198.6\n | 196.6\n | 182.4\n | 184.8\n | 175.4\n | 188.5\n | 184.6\n | 161.4\n | 155.0\n | 133.2\n | 133.1\n | 2,074\n |\n| Source 1: National Environment Agency[302][303] |\n| Source 2: NOAA (sun only, 1991\u20132020)[304] |\n\n### Water supply[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Water supply and sanitation in Singapore\n\nSingapore considers water a national security issue and the government has sought to emphasise conservation.[305] Water access is universal and of high quality, though the country is projected to face significant water-stress by 2040.[306][307] To circumvent this, the Public Utilities Board has implemented the \"four national taps\" strategy \u2013 water imported from neighbouring Malaysia, urban rainwater catchments, reclaimed water (NEWater) and seawater desalination.[308] Singapore's approach does not rely only on physical infrastructure; it also emphasises proper legislation and enforcement, water pricing, public education as well as research and development.[309] Singapore has declared that it will be water self-sufficient by the time its 1961 long-term water supply agreement with Malaysia expires in 2061. However, according to official forecasts, water demand in Singapore is expected to double from 380 to 760 million US gallons (1.4 to 2.8 billion litres; 1.4 to 2.8 million cubic meters) per day between 2010 and 2060. The increase is expected to come primarily from non-domestic water use, which accounted for 55% of water demand in 2010 and is expected to account for 70% of demand in 2060. By that time, water demand is expected to be met by reclaimed water at the tune of 50% and by desalination accounting for 30%, compared to only 20% supplied by internal catchments.[310][311]\n\n\nSingapore is expanding its recycling system and intends to spend $7.4 billion (S$10 billion) in water treatment infrastructure upgrades.[312] The Ulu Pandan wastewater treatment was specially built to test advanced used-water treatment processes before full deployment and won the *Water/Wastewater Project of the Year Award* at the 2018 Global Water Awards in Paris, France.[313] Operation started in 2017 and was jointly developed by PUB and the Black & Veatch + AECOM Joint Venture.[314]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\n### Land[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Singapore\n\n![](image)Entrance to Toa Payoh MRT station\n![](image)Double-deck bus operated by SBS Transit\nSingapore has a road system covering 3,356 kilometres (2,085\u00a0mi), which includes 161 kilometres (100\u00a0mi) of expressways.[315][316] The Singapore Area Licensing Scheme, implemented in 1975, became the world's first congestion pricing scheme, and included other complementary measures such as stringent car ownership quotas and improvements in mass transit.[317][318] Upgraded in 1998 and renamed Electronic Road Pricing (ERP), the system introduced electronic toll collection, electronic detection, and video surveillance technology.[319] A satellite-based system was due to replace the physical gantries by 2020, but has been delayed until 2026 due to global shortages in the supply of semiconductors.[320] As Singapore is a small island with a high population density, the number of private cars on the road is restricted with a pre-set car population quota, to curb pollution and congestion. Car buyers must pay for Additional Registration Fees (ARF) duties of either 100%, 140%, 180% or 220% of the vehicle's Open Market Value (OMV), and bid for a Singaporean Certificate of Entitlement (COE) (that varies twice a month in supply based on the number of car registrations and de-registrations), which allows the car to be driven on the road for maximum period of 10 years. Car prices are generally significantly higher in Singapore than in other English-speaking countries.[321] As with most Commonwealth countries, vehicles on the road and people walking on the streets keep to the left (left-hand traffic).[322]\n\n\nSingapore's public transport network is shaped up with trains (consisting of the MRT and LRT systems), buses and taxis. There are currently six MRT lines (North South MRT line, East West MRT line, North East MRT line, Circle MRT line, Downtown MRT line and Thomson-East Coast MRT line), three LRT lines serving the neighbourhoods of Bukit Panjang and Choa Chu Kang (Bukit Panjang LRT line), Sengkang (Sengkang LRT line) and Punggol (Punggol LRT line),[323] and more than 300 bus routes in operation.[324] Taxis are a popular form of transport as the fares are relatively affordable when compared to many other developed countries, whilst cars in Singapore are the most expensive to own worldwide.[325]\n\n\nThe Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway (connecting Singapore with Johor Bahru, Malaysia) is the busiest international land border crossing in the world, whereby approximately 350,000 travellers cross the border checkpoints of both Woodlands Checkpoint and Sultan Iskandar Building daily (with an annual total of 128 million travellers).[326]\n\n\nThe Land Transport Authority (LTA) is responsible for all land transport-related infrastructure and operations in Singapore.\n\n\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rain Vortex at Jewel Changi Airport\nSingapore is a major international transport hub in Asia, serving some of the busiest sea and air trade routes. Changi Airport is an aviation centre for Southeast Asia and a stopover on Qantas' Kangaroo Route between Sydney and London.[327] There are two civilian airports in Singapore, Singapore Changi Airport and Seletar Airport.[328][329] Singapore Changi Airport hosts a network of over 100 airlines connecting Singapore to some 300 cities in about 70 countries and territories worldwide.[330] It has been rated one of the best international airports by international travel magazines, including being rated as the world's best airport for the first time in 2006 by Skytrax.[331] Singapore Changi Airport also had the second- and third-busiest international air routes in the world; the Jakarta-Singapore airport pair had 4.8 million passengers carried in 2018, whilst the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur airport pair had 4.5 million passengers carried in 2018, both trailing only behind Hong Kong-Taipei (6.5 million).\n\n\nSingapore Airlines, which is the flag carrier of Singapore,[332] has been regarded as a 5-star airline by Skytrax[333] and been in the world top 10 list of airlines for multiple consecutive years.[334] Changi Airport had also been rated as the world's best airport from 2013 to 2020 before being superseded by Hamad International Airport in Doha;[335] it reclaimed this title in 2023.[336]\n\n\n\n### Sea[edit]\n\n\nThe Port of Singapore, managed by port operators PSA International and Jurong Port, was the world's second-busiest port in 2019 in terms of shipping tonnage handled, at 2.85\u00a0billion gross tons (GT), and in terms of containerised traffic, at 37.2\u00a0million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs).[337] It is also the world's second-busiest, behind Shanghai, in terms of cargo tonnage with 626\u00a0million tons handled. In addition, the port is the world's busiest for transshipment traffic and the world's biggest ship refuelling centre.[338]\n\n\n\n## Industry sectors[edit]\n\n\nSingapore is the world's 3rd-largest foreign exchange centre, 6th-largest financial centre,[339] 2nd-largest casino gambling market,[340] 3rd-largest oil-refining and trading centre, largest oil-rig producer and hub for ship repair services,[341][342][343] and largest logistics hub.[344] The economy is diversified, with its top contributors being financial services, manufacturing, and oil-refining. Its main exports are refined petroleum, integrated circuits, and computers,[345] which constituted 27% of the country's GDP in 2010. Other significant sectors include electronics, chemicals, mechanical engineering, and biomedical sciences. Singapore was ranked 5th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023 and 7th in 2022.[346][347][348][349] In 2019, there were more than 60 semiconductor companies in Singapore, which together constituted 11% of the global market share. The semiconductor industry alone contributes around 7% of Singapore's GDP.[350]\n\n\nSingapore's largest companies are in the telecommunications, banking, transportation, and manufacturing sectors, many of which started as state-run statutory corporations and have since been publicly listed on the Singapore Exchange. Such companies include Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel), Singapore Technologies Engineering, Keppel Corporation, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), Development Bank of Singapore (DBS), and United Overseas Bank (UOB). In 2011, amidst the global financial crisis, OCBC, DBS and UOB were ranked by *Bloomberg Businessweek* as the world's 1st, 5th, and 6th strongest banks in the world, respectively.[351] It is home to the headquarters of 3 *Fortune* Global 500 companies, the highest in the region.[352]\n\n\nThe nation's best known global companies include Singapore Airlines, Changi Airport, and the Port of Singapore, all of which are among the most-awarded in their respective fields. Singapore Airlines was ranked as Asia's most-admired company, and the world's 19th most-admired company in 2015 by *Fortune*'s annual \"50 most admired companies in the world\" industry surveys. Other awards it has received include the US-based *Travel + Leisure*'s Best International Airline award, which it has won for 20 consecutive years.[353][354] Changi Airport connects over 100 airlines to more than 300 cities. The strategic international air hub has more than 480 World's Best Airport awards as of 2015[update], and is known as the most-awarded airport in the world.[355] Over ten free-trade agreements have been signed with other countries and regions.[173] Singapore is the second-largest foreign investor in India.[356] It is the 14th largest exporter and the 15th largest importer in the world.[357][358]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Singapore\n\n![](image)The Merlion, the official mascot of Singapore\nTourism is a major industry and contributor to the Singaporean economy, attracting 18.5 million international tourists in 2018, more than three times Singapore's total population.[359] Singapore is the 5th most visited city in the world, and 2nd in the Asia-Pacific.[360] In 2019 tourism contributed directly to about 4% of Singapore's GDP,[361] down from 2016, when tourism contributed, directly and indirectly, to around 9.9% of Singapore's GDP.[362] Altogether, the sector generated approximately 8.6% of Singapore's employment in 2016.[362]\n\n\nIn 2015, Lonely Planet and *The New York Times* listed Singapore as their top and 6th-best world destinations to visit, respectively.[363] Well-known landmarks include the Merlion,[364] the Esplanade,[365] Marina Bay Sands,[366] Gardens by the Bay,[367] Jewel Changi Airport,[368] CHIJMES,[365] National Gallery Singapore,[365] the Singapore Flyer,[365] the Orchard Road shopping belt,[369] the resort island of Sentosa,[370] and the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Singapore's first UNESCO World Heritage Site.[371]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Victoria Theatre\nThe Singapore Tourism Board (STB) is the statutory board under the Ministry of Trade and Industry which is tasked with the promotion of the country's tourism industry. In August 2017 the STB and the Economic Development Board (EDB) unveiled a unified brand, Singapore \u2013 Passion Made Possible, to market Singapore internationally for tourism and business purposes.[372] The Orchard Road district, which contains multi-storey shopping centres and hotels, can be considered the centre of shopping and tourism in Singapore.[369] Other popular tourist attractions include the Singapore Zoo, River Wonders, Bird Paradise and Night Safari. The Singapore Zoo has embraced the open zoo concept whereby animals are kept in enclosures, separated from visitors by hidden dry or wet moats, instead of caging the animals, and the River Wonders has 300 species of animals, including numerous endangered species.[373] Singapore promotes itself as a medical tourism hub, with about 200,000 foreigners seeking medical care there each year. Singapore medical services aim to serve at least one million foreign patients annually and generate US$3\u00a0billion in revenue.[374]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Singapore and Singaporeans\n\nSee also: Race in Singapore\n\n![](image)Chinese (East Asian), Malay (Southeast Asian), and Indian (South Asian) women in Singapore, c.\u20091890. To promote racial harmony among the three races, a unique Racial Harmony Day is celebrated on 21 July every year.\nAs of mid-2023, the estimated population of Singapore was 5,917,600 people, 3,610,700 (61.6%) of whom were citizens, while the remaining 2,306,900 (38.4%) were permanent residents (522,300) or international students, foreign workers, or dependants (1,644,500).[6] According to the country's 2010 census, nearly 23% of Singaporean residents (i.e. citizens and permanent residents) were foreign born; if non-residents were counted, nearly 43% of the total population were foreign born.[375][376]\n\n\nThe same census also reports that about 74.1% of residents were of Chinese descent, 13.4% of Malay descent, 9.2% of Indian descent, and 3.3% of other (including Eurasian) descent.[375] Prior to 2010, each person could register as a member of only one race, by default that of his or her father; therefore mixed-race persons were solely grouped under their father's race in government censuses. From 2010 onward, people may register using a multi-racial classification, in which they may choose one primary race and one secondary race, but no more than two.[377]\n\n\nThe median age of Singaporean residents was 40.5 in 2017,[378] and the total fertility rate is estimated to be 0.80 children per woman in 2014, the lowest in the world and well below the 2.1 needed to replace the population.[379] The government has attempted to increase fertility with limited success, as well as adjusting immigration policy to maintain its working-age population.[380][381]\n\n\n91% of resident households (i.e. households headed by a Singapore citizen or permanent resident) own the homes they live in, and the average household size is 3.43 persons (which include dependants who are neither citizens nor permanent residents).[382][383] However, due to scarcity of land, 78.7% of resident households live in subsidised, high-rise, public housing apartments developed by the Housing and Development Board (HDB). Also, 75.9% of resident households live in properties that are equal to, or larger than, a four-room (i.e. three bedrooms plus one living room) HDB flat or in private housing.[384][385] Live-in foreign domestic workers are quite common in Singapore, with about 224,500 foreign domestic workers there, as of December 2013.[386]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest towns and planning areas in SingaporeSingapore Department of Statistics population report for June 2023\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Region |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Region |  Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Bedok](image)Bedok![Tampines](image)Tampines | 1 | Bedok | East | 279,510 | 11 | Ang Mo Kio | North-East | 161,180\n | ![Jurong West](image)Jurong West![Sengkang](image)Sengkang |\n| 2 | Tampines | East | 274,360 | 12 | Bukit Merah | Central | 149,530\n |\n| 3 | Jurong West | West | 259,740 | 13 | Pasir Ris | East | 146,930\n |\n| 4 | Sengkang | North-East | 257,190 | 14 | Bukit Panjang | West | 138,940\n |\n| 5 | Woodlands | North | 255,390 | 15 | Toa Payoh | Central | 134,610\n |\n| 6 | Hougang | North-East | 227,610 | 16 | Serangoon | North-East | 118,780\n |\n| 7 | Yishun | North | 228,910 | 17 | Geylang | Central | 114,750\n |\n| 8 | Choa Chu Kang | West | 191,480 | 18 | Sembawang | North | 109,120\n |\n| 9 | Punggol | North-East | 194,750 | 19 | Kallang | Central | 100,870\n |\n| 10 | Bukit Batok | West | 168,560 | 20 | Queenstown | Central | 99,690\n |\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Singapore\n\nMost major religious denominations are present in Singapore, with the Inter-Religious Organisation, Singapore (IRO) recognising 10 major religions in the city state.[387] A 2014 analysis by the Pew Research Center found Singapore to be the world's most religiously diverse nation.[388]\n\n| Religion in Singapore, 2020[4] |\n| --- |\n| Religion |  | Percent |\n| Buddhism |  | 31.1% |\n| No religion |  | 20.0% |\n| Christianity |  | 18.9% |\n| Islam |  | 15.6% |\n| Taoism and folk religion |  | 8.8% |\n| Hinduism |  | 5.0% |\n| Other religions |  | 0.6% |\n\nBuddhism is the most widely practised religion in Singapore: 31% of the resident population declared themselves adherents at the most recent census. The next-most practised religion is Christianity, followed by Islam, Taoism, and Hinduism. 20% of the population did not have a religious affiliation. The proportion of Christians, Taoists, and non-religious people increased between 2000 and 2010 by about 3 percentage points each, while the proportion of Buddhists decreased. Other faiths remained largely stable in their share of the population.[389]\n\n\nThere are monasteries and Dharma centres from all three major traditions of Buddhism in Singapore: Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. Most Buddhists in Singapore are Chinese and are of the Mahayana tradition,[390] missionaries having come into the country from China for several decades. However, Thailand's Theravada Buddhism has seen growing popularity among the populace (not only the Chinese) during the past decade. The religion of Soka Gakkai International, a Japanese Buddhist organisation, is practised by many people in Singapore, and mostly by those of Chinese descent. Tibetan Buddhism has also made slow inroads into the country in recent years.[391]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Singapore\n\nSingapore has four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil.[392]\n\n\n\n| Language used most frequently at home[4] |\n| --- |\n| Language |  | Percent |\n| English |  | 48.3% |\n| Mandarin |  | 29.9% |\n| Malay |  | 9.2% |\n| Other Sinitic languages |  | 8.7% |\n| Tamil |  | 2.5% |\n| Others |  | 1.4% |\n\nEnglish is the lingua franca[393][394][395][396] and the main language used in business, government, law and education.[397][398] The Constitution of Singapore and all government legislation is written in English, and interpreters are required if a language other than English is used in the Singaporean courts.[399][400] Statutory corporations conduct their businesses in English, while any official documents written in a non-English official language such as Malay, Mandarin, or Tamil are typically translated into English to be accepted for use.[401][394][402]\n\n\nMalay was designated as a national language by the Singaporean government after independence from Britain in the 1960s to avoid friction with Singapore's Malay-speaking neighbours of Malaysia and Indonesia.[161] It has a symbolic, rather than functional purpose.[392][403][404] It is used in the national anthem *Majulah Singapura*,[405] in citations of Singaporean orders and decorations and in military commands.[406][407] Singaporean Malay is officially written in the Latin-based Rumi script, though some Singaporean Malays also learn the Arabic-based Jawi script.[408] Jawi is considered an ethnic script for use on Singaporean identity cards.[409]\n\n\nSingaporeans are mostly bilingual, typically with English as their common language and their mother-tongue as a second language taught in schools, in order to preserve each individual's ethnic identity and values. According to the 2020 census, English was the language most spoken at home, used by 48.3% of the population; Mandarin was next, spoken at home by 29.9%.[407][410] Nearly half a million speak other ancestral Southern varieties of Chinese, mainly Hokkien, Teochew, and Cantonese, as their home language, although the use of these is declining in favour of Mandarin or just English.[411] Singapore Chinese characters are written using simplified Chinese characters.[412]\n\n\nSingaporean English is largely based on British English, owing to the country's status as a former crown colony.[413][414] However, forms of English spoken in Singapore range from Standard Singapore English to a colloquial form known as Singlish, which is discouraged by the government as it claims it to be a substandard English creole that handicaps Singaporeans, presenting an obstacle to learning standard English and rendering the speaker incomprehensible to everyone except to another Singlish speaker.[415] Standard Singapore English is fully understandable to all Standard English speakers, while most English-speaking people do not understand Singlish. Nevertheless, Singaporeans have a strong sense of identity and connection to Singlish, whereby the existence of Singlish is recognised as a distinctive cultural marker for many Singaporeans.[416] As such, in recent times, the government has tolerated the diglossia of both Singlish and Standard English (only for those who are fluent in both), whilst continuously reinforcing the importance of Standard English amongst those who speak only Singlish (which is not mutually intelligible with the Standard English of other English-speaking countries).[416]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Singapore\n\n![](image)National University of Singapore is one of six autonomous universities in the city-state.\nEducation for primary, secondary, and tertiary levels is mostly supported by the state. All institutions, public and private, must be registered with the Ministry of Education (MOE).[417] English is the language of instruction in all public schools,[418] and all subjects are taught and examined in English except for the \"mother tongue\" language paper.[419] While the term \"mother tongue\" in general refers to the first language internationally, in Singapore's education system, it is used to refer to the second language, as English is the first language.[420][421] Students who have been abroad for a while, or who struggle with their \"Mother Tongue\" language, are allowed to take a simpler syllabus or drop the subject.[422][423]\n\n\nEducation takes place in three stages: primary, secondary, and pre-university education, with the primary education being compulsory. Students begin with six years of primary school, which is made up of a four-year foundation course and a two-year orientation stage. The curriculum is focused on the development of English, the mother tongue, mathematics, and science.[424][425] Secondary school lasts from four to five years, and is divided between Express, Normal (Academic), and Normal (Technical) streams in each school, depending on a student's ability level.[426] The basic coursework breakdown is the same as in the primary level, although classes are much more specialised.[427] Pre-university education takes place at either the 21 Junior Colleges or the Millennia Institute, over a period of two and three years respectively.[428] As alternatives to pre-university education, however, courses are offered in other post-secondary education institutions, including the 5 polytechnics and 3 ITE colleges. Singapore has six public universities,[429] of which the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University are among the top 20 universities in the world.[430]\n\n\nNational examinations are standardised across all schools, with a test taken after each stage. After the first six years of education, students take the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE),[424] which determines their placement at secondary school. At the end of the secondary stage, O-Level or N-Level exams are taken;[431] at the end of the following pre-university stage, the GCE A-Level exams are taken.[432] Some schools have a degree of freedom in their curriculum and are known as autonomous schools, for secondary education level and above.[426]\n\n\nSingapore is also an education hub, with more than 80,000 international students in 2006.[433] 5,000 Malaysian students cross the Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway daily to attend schools in Singapore.[434] In 2009, 20% of all students in Singaporean universities were international students\u2014the maximum cap allowed, a majority from ASEAN, China and India.[435]\n\n\nSingapore students have excelled in many of the world education benchmarks in maths, science and reading. In 2015, both its primary and secondary students rank first in OECD's global school performance rankings across 76 countries\u2014described as the most comprehensive map of education standards.[436][437] In 2016, Singapore students topped both the Program International Student Assessment (PISA)[438][439][440][441] and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).[442][443][444] In the 2016 EF English Proficiency Index taken in 72 countries, Singapore place 6th and has been the only Asian country in the top ten.[445][446][447][448]\n\n\n\n## Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Singapore\n\n![](image)National University Hospital is the second largest hospital in the city, serving one million patients yearly.\nSingapore has a generally efficient healthcare system, even though health expenditures are relatively low for developed countries.[449] The World Health Organisation ranks Singapore's healthcare system as 6th overall in the world in its World Health Report.[450] Singapore has had the lowest infant mortality rates in the world for the past two decades.[451] In 2019, Singaporeans had the longest life expectancy of any country at 84.8 years. Women can expect to live an average of 87.6 years with 75.8 years in good health. The averages are lower for men.[452] Singapore is ranked 1st on the Global Food Security Index.[453]\n\n\nAs of December 2011 and January 2013, 8,800 foreigners and 5,400 Singaporeans were respectively diagnosed with HIV,[454] but there are fewer than 10 annual deaths from HIV per 100,000 people. Adult obesity is below 10%.[455]There is a high level of immunisation.[456] In 2013, the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Singapore as having the best quality of life in Asia and sixth overall in the world.[457]\n\n\nThe government's healthcare system is based upon the \"3M\" framework. This has three components: Medifund, which provides a safety net for those not able to otherwise afford healthcare; Medisave, a compulsory national medical savings account system covering about 85% of the population; and Medishield, a government-funded health insurance program. Public hospitals in Singapore have a considerable autonomy in their management decisions, and notionally compete for patients, but remain in government ownership.[458] A subsidy scheme exists for those on low income.[459] In 2008, 32% of healthcare was funded by the government. Healthcare accounts for approximately 3.5% of Singapore's GDP.[460]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Singapore\n\n![](image)Ornate details on top of Sri Mariamman Temple in Chinatown district, Singapore's oldest Hindu temple since 1827.\nDespite its small size, Singapore has a diversity of languages, religions, and cultures.[461] Former prime ministers of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, have stated that Singapore does not fit the traditional description of a nation, calling it a society-in-transition, pointing out the fact that Singaporeans do not all speak the same language, share the same religion, or have the same customs.[461][462] Singaporeans who speak English as their native language would likely lean toward Western culture (along with either Christian culture or secularism),[463] while those who speak Chinese as their native language mostly lean toward Chinese culture, which has linkages with Chinese folk religion, Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. Malay-speaking Singaporeans mostly lean toward Malay culture, which itself is closely linked to Islamic culture.[464][465] Tamil-speaking Singaporeans mostly lean toward Tamil culture, which itself is mostly linked to Hindu culture. Racial and religious harmony is regarded as a crucial part of Singapore's success, and played a part in building a Singaporean identity.[466][467]\n\n\nWhen Singapore became independent from the United Kingdom in 1963, most Singaporean citizens were transient migrant labourers who had no intention of staying permanently.[468] There was also a sizeable minority of middle-class, locally born people\u2014known as Peranakans or Baba-Nyonya-descendants of 15th- and 16th-century Chinese immigrants. With the exception of the Peranakans who pledged their loyalties to Singapore, most of the labourers' loyalties lay with their respective homelands of Malaya, China and India. After independence, the government began a deliberate process of crafting a uniquely Singaporean identity and culture.[468] Singapore has a reputation as a nanny state.[469][470] The government also places a heavy emphasis on meritocracy, where one is judged based on one's ability.[471]\n\n\nThe national flower of Singapore is the hybrid orchid, Vanda 'Miss Joaquim', named in memory of a Singapore-born Armenian woman, who crossbred the flower in her garden at Tanjong Pagar in 1893.[472] Singapore is known as the *Lion City* and many national symbols such as the coat of arms and the lion head symbol make use of a lion. Major religious festivals are public holidays.[473]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Dance in Singapore, Singaporean literature, and Music of Singapore\n\n![The National Gallery Singapore oversees the world's largest public collection of Southeast Asian and Singapore art](image)The National Gallery Singapore oversees the world's largest public collection of Singapore and Southeast Asian art.\nDuring the 1990s the National Arts Council was created to spearhead the development of performing arts, along with visual and literary art forms.[474] The National Gallery Singapore is the nation's flagship museum with some 8,000 works from Singaporean and other Southeast Asian artists. The Singapore Art Museum focuses on contemporary art. The Red Dot Design Museum celebrates exceptional art and design of objects for everyday life, hosting more than 1,000 items from 50 countries. The lotus-shaped ArtScience Museum hosts touring exhibitions that combine art with the sciences. Other major museums include the Asian Civilisations Museum, the Peranakan Museum, and The Arts House.[475] The Esplanade is Singapore's largest performing arts centre. In 2016 alone, it was the site of 5,900 free art and culture events.[476][477]\n\n\nLiterature of Singapore, or \"SingLit\", consists of a collection of literary works by Singaporeans written chiefly in the country's four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. Singapore is increasingly regarded as having four sub-literatures instead of one. Many significant works have been translated and showcased in publications such as the literary journal *Singa*, published in the 1980s and 1990s with editors including Edwin Thumboo and Koh Buck Song, as well as in multilingual anthologies such as *Rhythms: A Singaporean Millennial Anthology Of Poetry* (2000), in which the poems were all translated three times each. A number of Singaporean writers such as Tan Swie Hian and Kuo Pao Kun have contributed work in more than one language.[478][479]\n\n\nSingapore has a diverse music culture that ranges from pop and rock, to folk and classical. Western classical music plays a significant role in the cultural life in Singapore, with the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO) instituted in 1979. Other notable western orchestras in Singapore include Singapore National Youth Orchestra[480] and the community-based Braddell Heights Symphony Orchestra.[481] Many orchestras and ensembles are also found in secondary schools and junior colleges. Various communities have their own distinct ethnic musical traditions: Chinese, Malays, Indians, and Eurasians. With their traditional forms of music and various modern musical styles, the fusion of different forms account for the musical diversity in the country.[482] The nation's lively urban musical scene has made it a centre for international performances and festivals in the region. Some of Singapore's best known pop singers include Stefanie Sun, JJ Lin, Liang Wern Fook, Taufik Batisah and Dick Lee, who is famous for composing National Day theme songs, including *Home*.[483][484]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Singaporean cuisine\n\n![Satay stalls along Boon Tat Street next to Telok Ayer Market, better known as Lau Pa Sat](image)Lau Pa Sat hawker centre in the financial district. Satay cart-stalls roll in after dusk, on a side street.\nSingapore's diversity of cuisine is touted as a reason to visit the country, due to its combination of convenience, variety, quality, and price.[485] Local food items generally relate to a particular ethnicity \u2013 Chinese, Malay and Indian; but the diversity of cuisine has increased further by the hybridisation of different styles (e.g., the Peranakan cuisine, a mix of Chinese and Malay cuisine). In hawker centres, cultural diffusion is exemplified by traditionally Malay hawker stalls also selling Tamil food. Hainanese chicken rice, based on the Hainanese dish Wenchang chicken, is considered Singapore's national dish.[486][487]\n\n\nThe city-state has a burgeoning food scene ranging from hawker centres (open-air), food courts (air-conditioned), coffee shops (open-air with up to a dozen hawker stalls), cafes, fast food, simple kitchens, casual, celebrity and high-end restaurants.[488] Cloud kitchens and food delivery are also on the rise, with 70% of residents ordering from delivery apps at least once a month.[489][490] Many international celebrity chef restaurants are located within the integrated resorts.[491] Religious dietary strictures exist (Muslims do not eat pork and Hindus do not eat beef), and there is also a significant group of vegetarians. The Singapore Food Festival which celebrates Singapore's cuisine is held annually in July.[492]\n\n\nPrior to the 1980s, street food was sold mainly by immigrants from China, India, and Malaysia to other immigrants seeking a familiar taste. In Singapore, street food has long been associated with hawker centres with communal seating areas. Typically, these centres have a few dozen to hundreds of food stalls, with each specialising in one or more related dishes.[493][488] While street food can be found in many countries, the variety and reach of centralised hawker centres that serve heritage street food in Singapore is unique.[494] In 2018, there were 114 hawker centres spread across the city centre and heartland housing estates. They are maintained by the National Environment Agency, which also grades each food stall for hygiene. The largest hawker centre is located on the second floor of Chinatown Complex, and contains over 200 stalls.[494] The complex is also home to the cheapest Michelin-starred meal in the world \u2013 a plate of soya-sauce chicken rice or noodles for S$2 (US$1.50). Two street food stalls in the city are the first in the world to be awarded a Michelin star, obtaining a single star each.[495]\n\n\n\n### Sport and recreation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Singapore\n\n![](image)Joseph Schooling is a gold medalist and Olympic record holder at the Rio 2016 Games \u2013 100\u00a0m butterfly.[496]\nThe development of private sports and recreation clubs began in the 19th century colonial Singapore, with clubs founded during this time including the Cricket Club, the Singapore Recreation Club, the Singapore Swimming Club, and the Hollandse Club.[497] Weightlifter Tan Howe Liang was Singapore's first Olympic medalist, winning a silver at the 1960 Rome Games.[498]\n\n\nIndoor and water sports are some of the most popular sports in Singapore. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Joseph Schooling won Singapore's first Olympic gold medal, claiming the 100-metre butterfly in a new Olympic record time of 50.39 seconds.[496] Singapore sailors have had success on the international stage, with their Optimist team being considered among the best in the world.[499][500] Despite its size, the country has dominated swim meets in the Southeast Asia Games. Its men's water polo team won the SEA Games gold medal for the 27th time in 2017, continuing Singapore sport's longest winning streak.[501] Singapore hosted the inaugural 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, in which 3,600 athletes from 204 nations competed in 26 sports.[502] The island is home to ONE Championship, the biggest Mixed Martial Arts promotion in Asia.[503] Singapore's women's table tennis team were silver medalists at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.[504][505] They became world champions in 2010 when they beat China at the World Team Table Tennis Championships in Russia, breaking China's 19-year winning streak.[506] In 2021, Singapore's Loh Kean Yew achieved a \"World Champion\" status when he won a badminton gold at the 2021 BWF World Championships men's singles, which is one of the most prestigious badminton tournaments alongside the Summer Olympics badminton tournaments.[507]\n\n\nSingapore's football league, the Singapore Premier League, was launched in 1996 as the S.League and comprises eight clubs, including one foreign team.[508][509] The Singapore Slingers is one of the inaugural teams in the ASEAN Basketball League, which was founded in October 2009.[510] Kranji Racecourse is run by the Singapore Turf Club and hosts several meetings per week, including international races\u2014notably the Singapore Airlines International Cup.[511]\n\n\nSingapore began hosting a round of the Formula One World Championship, the Singapore Grand Prix at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in 2008. It was the inaugural F1 night race,[512] and the first F1 street race in Asia.[513] It is considered a signature event on the F1 calendar.[514]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media of Singapore\n\nSee also: Telecommunications in Singapore\n\n![](image)The Ministry of Communications and Information oversees the development of infocomm, media and the arts.\nCompanies linked to the government control much of the domestic media in Singapore.[515] MediaCorp operates most free-to-air television channels and free-to-air radio stations in Singapore. There are a total of six free-to-air TV channels offered by MediaCorp.[516] StarHub TV and Singtel TV also offer IPTV with channels from all around the world.[517][518] SPH Media Trust, a body with close links to the government, controls most of the newspaper industry in Singapore.[519]\n\n\nSingapore's media industry has sometimes been criticised for being overly regulated and lacking in freedom by human rights groups such as Freedom House.[515] Self-censorship among journalists is said to be common.[519] In 2023, Singapore was ranked 129 on the Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders, up from 139 the previous year.[520] The Media Development Authority regulates Singaporean media, claiming to balance the demand for choice and protection against offensive and harmful material.[521] Private ownership of TV satellite dishes is banned.[519]\n\n\nInternet in Singapore is provided by state-owned Singtel, partially state-owned Starhub and M1 Limited as well as some other business internet service providers (ISPs) that offer residential service plans of speeds up to 2 Gbit/s as of spring 2015.[522] Equinix (332 participants) and the Singapore Internet Exchange (70 participants) are Internet exchange points where Internet service providers and Content delivery networks exchange Internet traffic between their networks (autonomous systems) in various locations in Singapore.[523][524] In the mid-1980s to 1990s, Singaporeans could also use the locally based videotext service Singapore Teleview to communicate with one another.[525] The phrase *Intelligent Island* arose in the 1990s in reference to the island nation's early adaptive relationship with the internet.[525][526]\n\n\nIn 2016, there were an estimated 4.7\u00a0million internet users in Singapore, representing 82.5% of the population.[527] The Singapore government does not engage in widespread censoring of the internet,[528] but it maintains a list of one hundred websites\u2014mostly pornographic\u2014that it blocks from home internet access as a \"symbolic statement of the Singaporean community's stand on harmful and undesirable content on the Internet\".[529][530] Singapore has the world's highest smartphone penetration rates, in surveys by Deloitte[531][532] and the Google Consumer Barometer\u2014at 89% and 85% of the population respectively in 2014.[533] The overall mobile phone penetration rate is at 148 mobile phone subscribers per 100 people.[534]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Singapore portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![icon](image)Islands portal\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n\n\n* Index of Singapore-related articles\n* Foreign relations of Singapore\n* Outline of Singapore\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In Singapore, the population is classified based on the Chinese-Malay-Indian-Others (CMIO) racial framework used by the Singaporean government, and does not necessarily reflect the ethnic identity of the individual.

The republic of Honduras is bordered to the west by Guatemala, to the southwest by El Salvador, to the southeast by Nicaragua, to the south by the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Fonseca, and to the north by the Gulf of Honduras, a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea. Its capital and largest city is Tegucigalpa.\n\n\nHonduras was home to several important Mesoamerican cultures, most notably the Maya, before the Spanish colonization in the sixteenth century. The Spanish introduced Catholicism and the now predominant Spanish language, along with numerous customs that have blended with the indigenous culture. Honduras became independent in 1821 and has since been a republic, although it has consistently endured much social strife and political instability, and remains one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere. In 1960, the northern part of what was the Mosquito Coast was transferred from Nicaragua to Honduras by the International Court of Justice.[8]\n\n\nThe nation's economy is primarily agricultural, making it especially vulnerable to natural disasters such as Hurricane Mitch in 1998.[9] The lower class is primarily agriculturally based while wealth is concentrated in the country's urban centers.[10] Honduras has a Human Development Index of 0.625, classifying it as a nation with medium development.[11] When adjusted for income inequality, its Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index is 0.443.[11]\n\n\nHonduran society is predominantly Mestizo; however, there are also significant Indigenous Americans, black and white communities in Honduras.[12] The nation had a relatively high political stability until its 2009 coup and again with the 2017 presidential election.[13]\n\n\nHonduras spans about 112,492\u00a0km2 (43,433\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and has a population exceeding 10 million.[14][15] Its northern portions are part of the western Caribbean zone, as reflected in the area's demographics and culture. Honduras is known for its rich natural resources, including minerals, coffee, tropical fruit, and sugar cane, as well as for its growing textiles industry, which serves the international market.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe literal meaning of the term \"Honduras\" is \"depths\" in Spanish. The name could either refer to the bay of Trujillo as an anchorage, *fondura* in the Leonese dialect of Spain, or to Columbus's alleged quote that *\"Gracias a Dios que hemos salido de esas honduras\"* (\"Thank God we have departed from those depths\").[16][17][18]\n\n\nIt was not until the end of the 16th century that *Honduras* was used for the whole province. Prior to 1580, *Honduras* referred to only the eastern part of the province, and *Higueras* referred to the western part.[18] Another early name is Guaymuras, revived as the name for the political dialogue in 2009 that took place in Honduras as opposed to Costa Rica.[19]\n\n\nHondurans are often referred to as *Catracho* or *Catracha* (fem) in Spanish.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Honduras\n\n![](image)A Maya stela, an emblematic symbol of the Honduran Mayan civilization at Copan\n### Pre-colonial period[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mesoamerican chronology\n\nSee also: Bajo Agu\u00e1n\n\nIn the pre-Columbian era, modern Honduras was split between two pan-cultural regions: Mesoamerica in the west and the Isthmo-Colombian area in the east. Each complex had a \"core area\" within Honduras (the Sula Valley for Mesoamerica, and La Mosquitia for the Isthmo-Colombian area), and the intervening area was one of gradual transition. However, these concepts had no meaning in the Pre-Columbian era itself and represent extremely diverse areas. The Lenca people of the interior highlands are also generally considered to be culturally Mesoamerican, though the extent of linkage with other areas varied over time (for example, expanding during the zenith of the Toltec Empire).\n\n\nIn the extreme west, Maya civilization flourished for hundreds of years. The dominant, best known, and best studied state within Honduras's borders was in Cop\u00e1n, which was located in a mainly non-Maya area, or on the frontier between Maya and non-Maya areas. Cop\u00e1n declined with other Lowland centres during the conflagrations of the Terminal Classic in the 9th century. The Maya of this civilization survive in western Honduras as the Ch'orti', isolated from their Choltian linguistic peers to the west.[20]\n\n\nHowever, Cop\u00e1n represents only a fraction of Honduran pre-Columbian history. Remnants of other civilizations are found throughout the country. Archaeologists have studied sites such as Naco\u00a0[es] and La Sierra in the Naco Valley, Los Naranjos on Lake Yojoa, Yarumela in the Comayagua Valley,[21] La Ceiba and Salitron Viejo[22] (both now under the Caj\u00f3n Dam reservoir), Selin Farm and Cuyamel in the Aguan valley, Cerro Palenque, Travesia, Curruste, Ticamaya, Despoloncal, and Playa de los Muertos in the lower Ul\u00faa River valley, and many others.\n\n\nIn 2012, LiDAR scanning revealed that several previously unknown high density settlements existed in La Mosquitia, corresponding to the legend of \"La Ciudad Blanca\". Excavation and study has since improved knowledge of the region's history. It is estimated that these settlements reached their zenith from 500 to 1000 AD.\n\n\n\n### Spanish conquest (1524\u20131539)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spanish conquest of Honduras\n\n![](image)Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, one of the conquerors of Honduras\nOn his fourth and the final voyage to the New World in 1502, Christopher Columbus landed near the modern town of Trujillo, near Guaimoreto Lagoon, becoming the first European to visit the Bay Islands on the coast of Honduras.[23] On 30 July 1502, Columbus sent his brother Bartholomew to explore the islands and Bartholomew encountered a Mayan trading vessel from Yucat\u00e1n, carrying well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo.[24][25] Bartholomew's men stole the cargo they wanted and kidnapped the ship's elderly captain to serve as an interpreter[25] in the first recorded encounter between the Spanish and the Maya.[26]\n\n\nIn March 1524, Gil Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila became the first Spaniard to enter Honduras as a conquistador.[27][28] followed by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, who had brought forces down from Mexico. Much of the conquest took place in the following two decades, first by groups loyal to Crist\u00f3bal de Olid, and then by those loyal to Francisco de Montejo but most particularly by those following Alvarado.[*who?*] In addition to Spanish resources, the conquerors relied heavily on armed forces from Mexico\u2014Tlaxcalans and Mexica armies of thousands who remained garrisoned in the region.\n\n\nResistance to conquest was led in particular by Lempira. Many regions in the north of Honduras never fell to the Spanish, notably the Miskito Kingdom. After the Spanish conquest, Honduras became part of Spain's vast empire in the New World within the Kingdom of Guatemala. Trujillo and Gracias were the first city-capitals. The Spanish ruled the region for approximately three centuries.\n\n\n\n### Spanish Honduras (1524\u20131821)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Church of San Manuel de Colohete\nHonduras was organized as a province of the Kingdom of Guatemala and the capital was fixed, first at Trujillo on the Atlantic coast, and later at Comayagua, and finally at Tegucigalpa in the central part of the country.\n\n\nSilver mining was a key factor in the Spanish conquest and settlement of Honduras.[29] Initially the mines were worked by local people through the encomienda system, but as disease and resistance made this option less available, slaves from other parts of Central America were brought in. When local slave trading stopped at the end of the sixteenth century, African slaves, mostly from Angola, were imported.[30] After about 1650, very few slaves or other outside workers arrived in Honduras.\n\n\nAlthough the Spanish conquered the southern or Pacific portion of Honduras fairly quickly, they were less successful on the northern, or Atlantic side. They managed to found a few towns along the coast, at Puerto Caballos and Trujillo in particular, but failed to conquer the eastern portion of the region and many pockets of independent indigenous people as well. The Miskito Kingdom in the northeast was particularly effective at resisting conquest. The Miskito Kingdom found support from northern European privateers, pirates and especially the British formerly English colony of Jamaica, which placed much of the area under its protection after 1740.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Fortaleza de San Fernando de Omoa was built by the Spanish to protect the coast of Honduras from English pirates.\n### Independence (1821)[edit]\n\n\nHonduras gained independence from Spain in 1821 and was a part of the First Mexican Empire until 1823, when it became part of the United Provinces of Central America. It has been an independent republic and has held regular elections since 1838. In the 1840s and 1850s Honduras participated in several failed attempts at Central American unity, such as the Confederation of Central America (1842\u20131845), the covenant of Guatemala (1842), the Diet of Sonsonate (1846), the Diet of Nacaome (1847) and National Representation in Central America (1849\u20131852). Although Honduras eventually adopted the name Republic of Honduras, the unionist ideal never waned, and Honduras was one of the Central American countries that pushed the hardest for a policy of regional unity.\n\n\nPolicies favoring international trade and investment began in the 1870s, and soon foreign interests became involved, first in shipping from the north coast, especially tropical fruit and most notably bananas, and then in building railroads. In 1888, a projected railroad line from the Caribbean coast to the capital, Tegucigalpa, ran out of money when it reached San Pedro Sula. As a result, San Pedro grew into the nation's primary industrial center and second-largest city. Comayagua was the capital of Honduras until 1880, when the capital moved to Tegucigalpa.\n\n\nSince independence, nearly 300 small internal rebellions and civil wars have occurred in the country, including some changes of r\u00e9gime.[31][32]\n\n\n\n### 20th century and the role of American companies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Banana Wars\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, Honduras granted land and substantial exemptions to several US-based fruit and infrastructure companies in return for developing the country's northern regions. Thousands of workers came to the north coast as a result to work in banana plantations and other businesses that grew up around the export industry. Banana-exporting companies, dominated until 1930 by the Cuyamel Fruit Company, as well as the United Fruit Company, and Standard Fruit Company, built an enclave economy in northern Honduras, controlling infrastructure and creating self-sufficient, tax-exempt sectors that contributed relatively little to economic growth. American troops landed in Honduras in 1903, 1907, 1911, 1912, 1919, 1924 and 1925.[33]\n\n\nIn 1904, the writer O. Henry coined the term \"banana republic\" to describe Honduras,[34] publishing a book called *Cabbages and Kings*, about a fictional country, Anchuria, inspired by his experiences in Honduras, where he had lived for six months.[35] In *The Admiral*, O.Henry refers to the nation as a \"small maritime banana republic\"; naturally, the fruit was the entire basis of its economy.[36][37] According to a literary analyst writing for *The Economist*, \"his phrase neatly conjures up the image of a tropical, agrarian country. But its real meaning is sharper: it refers to the fruit companies from the United States that came to exert extraordinary influence over the politics of Honduras and its neighbors.\"[38][39] In addition to drawing Central American workers north, the fruit companies encouraged immigration of workers from the English-speaking Caribbean, notably Jamaica and Belize, which introduced an African-descended, English-speaking and largely Protestant population into the country, although many of these workers left following changes to immigration law in 1939.[40]\nHonduras joined the Allied Nations after Pearl Harbor, on 8 December 1941, and signed the Declaration by United Nations on 1 January 1942, along with twenty-five other governments.\n\n\nConstitutional crises in the 1940s led to reforms in the 1950s. One reform gave workers permission to organize, and a 1954 general strike paralyzed the northern part of the country for more than two months, but led to reforms. In 1963 a military coup unseated democratically elected President Ram\u00f3n Villeda Morales. In 1960, the northern part of what was the Mosquito Coast was transferred from Nicaragua to Honduras by the International Court of Justice.[8]\n\n\n\n### War and upheaval (1969\u20131999)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1969, Honduras and El Salvador fought what became known as the Football War.[41] Border tensions led to acrimony between the two countries after Oswaldo L\u00f3pez Arellano, the president of Honduras, blamed the deteriorating Honduran economy on immigrants from El Salvador. The relationship reached a low when El Salvador met Honduras for a three-round football elimination match preliminary to the World Cup.[42]\n\n\nTensions escalated and on 14 July 1969, the Salvadoran army invaded Honduras.[41] The Organization of American States (OAS) negotiated a cease-fire which took effect on 20 July and brought about a withdrawal of Salvadoran troops in early August.[42] Contributing factors to the conflict were a boundary dispute and the presence of thousands of Salvadorans living in Honduras illegally. After the week-long war, as many as 130,000 Salvadoran immigrants were expelled.[10]\n\n\nHurricane Fifi caused severe damage when it skimmed the northern coast of Honduras on 18 and 19 September 1974. Melgar Castro (1975\u201378) and Paz Garcia (1978\u201382) largely built the current physical infrastructure and telecommunications system of Honduras.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Part of the massive damage caused by Hurricane Mitch in Tegucigalpa, 1998\nIn 1979, the country returned to civilian rule. A constituent assembly was popularly elected in April 1980 to write a new constitution, and general elections were held in November 1981. The constitution was approved in 1982 and the PLH government of Roberto Suazo won the election with a promise to carry out an ambitious program of economic and social development to tackle the recession in which Honduras found itself. He launched ambitious social and economic development projects sponsored by American development aid. Honduras became host to the largest Peace Corps mission in the world, and nongovernmental and international voluntary agencies proliferated. The Peace Corps withdrew its volunteers in 2012, citing safety concerns.[44]\n\n\nDuring the early 1980s, the United States established a continuing military presence in Honduras to support El Salvador, the Contra guerrillas fighting the Nicaraguan government, and also develop an airstrip and modern port in Honduras. Though spared the bloody civil wars wracking its neighbors, the Honduran army quietly waged campaigns against Marxist\u2013Leninist militias such as the Cinchoneros Popular Liberation Movement, notorious for kidnappings and bombings,[45] and against many non-militants as well. The operation included a campaign of extrajudicial killings by government units, most notably the CIA-trained Battalion 316.[46]\n\n\nIn 1998, Hurricane Mitch caused massive and widespread destruction. Honduran President Carlos Roberto Flores said that fifty years of progress in the country had been reversed. Mitch destroyed about 70% of the country's crops and an estimated 70\u201380% of the transportation infrastructure, including nearly all bridges and secondary roads. Across Honduras 33,000 houses were destroyed, and an additional 50,000 damaged. Some 5,000 people killed, and 12,000 more injured. Total losses were estimated at US$3 billion.[47]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Ricardo Maduro with U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in August 2003\nIn 2007, President of Honduras Manuel Zelaya and President of the United States George W. Bush began talks on US assistance to Honduras to tackle the latter's growing drug cartels in Mosquito, Eastern Honduras using US special forces. This marked the beginning of a new foothold for the US military's continued presence in Central America.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)2009 Honduran coup d'\u00e9tat\nUnder Zelaya, Honduras joined ALBA in 2008, but withdrew in 2010 after the 2009 Honduran coup d'\u00e9tat.[49] In 2009, a constitutional crisis resulted when power was transferred in a coup from the president to the head of Congress. The OAS suspended Honduras because it did not regard its government as legitimate.[50][51]\n\n\nCountries around the world, the OAS, and the United Nations[52] formally and unanimously condemned the action as a coup d'\u00e9tat, refusing to recognize the *de facto* government, even though the lawyers consulted by the Library of Congress submitted to the United States Congress an opinion that declared the coup legal.[52][53][54] The Honduran Supreme Court also ruled that the proceedings had been legal. The government that followed the *de facto government* established a truth and reconciliation commission, *Comisi\u00f3n de la Verdad y Reconciliaci\u00f3n*, which after more than a year of research and debate concluded that the ousting had been a coup d'\u00e9tat, and illegal in the commission's opinion.[55][56][57]\n\n\nOn 28 November 2021, the former first lady Xiomara Castro, leftist presidential candidate of opposition Liberty and Refoundation Party, won 53% of the votes in the presidential election to become the first female president of Honduras, bringing an end to the 12-year reign of the right-wing National Party.[58] She was sworn in on 27 January 2022. Her husband, Manuel Zelaya, held the same office from 2006 until 2009.[59]\n\n\nIn April 2022, former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, who served two terms between 2014 and January 2022, was extradited to the United States to face charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. Hernandez denied the accusations.[60]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Honduras\n\n![](image)Honduras's topography.\nThe north coast of Honduras borders the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean lies south through the Gulf of Fonseca. Honduras consists mainly of mountains, with narrow plains along the coasts. A large undeveloped lowland jungle, *La Mosquitia* lies in the northeast, and the heavily populated lowland Sula valley in the northwest. In La Mosquitia lies the UNESCO world-heritage site R\u00edo Pl\u00e1tano Biosphere Reserve, with the Coco River which divides Honduras from Nicaragua.\n\n\nThe Islas de la Bah\u00eda and the Swan Islands are off the north coast. Misteriosa Bank and Rosario Bank, 130 to 150 kilometres (81 to 93 miles) north of the Swan Islands, fall within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Honduras.\n\n\nNatural resources include timber, gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, iron ore, antimony, coal, fish, shrimp, and hydropower.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)K\u00f6ppen climate types of Honduras\nMain article: Geography of Honduras \u00a7\u00a0Climate\n\nThe climate varies from tropical in the lowlands to temperate in the mountains. The Pacific coast is generally drier than the Caribbean.\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Flora and Fauna of Honduras\n\nSee also: List of birds of Honduras and List of national parks of Honduras\n\nThe region is considered a biodiversity hotspot because of the many plant and animal species found there. Like other countries in the region, it contains vast biological resources. Honduras hosts more than 6,000 species of vascular plants, of which 630 (described so far) are orchids; around 250 reptiles and amphibians, more than 700 bird species, and 110 mammalian species, of which half are bats.[61]\n\n\nIn the northeastern region of La Mosquitia lies the R\u00edo Pl\u00e1tano Biosphere Reserve, a lowland rainforest which is home to a great diversity of life. The reserve was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites List in 1982.\n\n\nHonduras has rain forests, cloud forests (which can rise up to nearly 3,000 metres or 9,800 feet above sea level), mangroves, savannas and mountain ranges with pine and oak trees, and the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. In the Bay Islands there are bottlenose dolphins, manta rays, parrot fish, schools of blue tang and whale shark.\n\n\nDeforestation resulting from logging is rampant in Olancho Department. The clearing of land for agriculture is prevalent in the largely undeveloped La Mosquitia region, causing land degradation and soil erosion. Honduras had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.48/10, ranking it 126th globally out of 172 countries.[62]\n\n\nLake Yojoa, which is Honduras's largest source of fresh water, is polluted by heavy metals produced from mining activities.[63] Some rivers and streams are also polluted by mining.[64]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Honduras\n\nHonduras is governed within a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic. The President of Honduras is both head of state and head of government. Executive power is exercised by the Honduran government. Legislative power is vested in the National Congress of Honduras. The judiciary is independent of both the executive branch and the legislature.\n\n\nThe National Congress of Honduras (*Congreso Nacional*) has 128 members (*diputados*), elected for a four-year term by proportional representation. Congressional seats are assigned the parties' candidates on a departmental basis in proportion to the number of votes each party receives.[1]\n\n\n\n### Political culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Incumbent President Xiomara Castro\nIn 1963, a military coup removed the democratically elected president, Ram\u00f3n Villeda Morales. A string of authoritarian military governments held power uninterrupted until 1981, when Roberto Suazo C\u00f3rdova was elected president.\n\n\nThe party system was dominated by the conservative National Party of Honduras (Partido Nacional de Honduras: PNH) and the liberal Liberal Party of Honduras (Partido Liberal de Honduras: PLH) until the 2009 Honduran coup d'\u00e9tat removed Manuel Zelaya from office and put Roberto Micheletti in his place.\n\n\n\n![](image)The 2009 military coup ousted the country's democratically elected President Manuel Zelaya.\nIn late 2012, 1540 persons were interviewed by ERIC in collaboration with the Jesuit university, as reported by Associated Press. This survey found that 60.3% believed the police were involved in crime, 44.9% had \"no confidence\" in the Supreme Court, and 72% thought there was electoral fraud in the primary elections of November 2012. Also, 56% expected the presidential, legislative and municipal elections of 2013 to be fraudulent.[65]\n\n\nThen-president Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez took office on 27 January 2014. After managing to stand for a second term,[66] a very close election in 2017 left uncertainty as to whether then-President Hernandez or his main challenger, television personality Salvador Nasralla, had prevailed.[67] The disputed election caused protests and violence. In December 2017, Hern\u00e1ndez was declared the winner of the election after a partial recount.[68] In January 2018, Hern\u00e1ndez was sworn in for a second presidential term.[69] He was succeeded by Xiomara Castro, the leader of the left-wing Libre Party, and wife of Manuel Zelaya, on 27 January 2022, becoming the first woman to serve as president.[70]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Foreign relations of Honduras\n\n![](image)Map of Honduran diplomatic missions\n![](image)Map of diplomatic missions in Honduras\nHonduras and Nicaragua had tense relations throughout 2000 and early 2001 due to a boundary dispute off the Atlantic coast. Nicaragua imposed a 35% tariff against Honduran goods due to the dispute.[71]\n\n\nIn June 2009 a coup d'\u00e9tat ousted President Manuel Zelaya; he was taken in a military aircraft to Costa Rica. The General Assembly of the United Nations voted to denounce the coup and called for the restoration of Zelaya. Several Latin American nations, including Mexico, temporarily severed diplomatic relations with Honduras. In July 2010, full diplomatic relations were once again re-established with Mexico.[72] The United States sent out mixed messages after the coup; U.S. President Obama called the ouster a coup and expressed support for Zelaya's return to power. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, advised by John Negroponte, the former Reagan-era Ambassador to Honduras implicated in the Iran\u2013Contra affair, refrained from expressing support.[73] She has since explained that the US would have had to cut aid if it called Zelaya's ouster a military coup, although the US has a record of ignoring these events when it chooses.[74] Zelaya had expressed an interest in Hugo Ch\u00e1vez' Bolivarian Alliance for Peoples of our America (ALBA), and had actually joined in 2008. After the 2009 coup, Honduras withdrew its membership.[49]\n\n\nThis interest in regional agreements may have increased the alarm of establishment politicians. When Zelaya began calling for a \"fourth ballot box\" to determine whether Hondurans wished to convoke a special constitutional congress, this sounded a lot to some like the constitutional amendments that had extended the terms of both Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Evo Morales. \"Ch\u00e1vez has served as a role model for like-minded leaders intent on cementing their power. These presidents are barely in office when they typically convene a constitutional convention to guarantee their reelection,\" said a 2009 Spiegel International analysis,[75] which noted that one reason to join ALBA was discounted Venezuelan oil. In addition to Ch\u00e1vez and Morales, Carlos Menem of Argentina, Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil and Columbian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe had all taken this step, and Washington and the EU were both accusing the Sandinista National Liberation Front government in Nicaragua of tampering with election results.[75] Politicians of all stripes expressed opposition to Zelaya's referendum proposal, and the Attorney-General accused him of violating the constitution. The Honduran Supreme Court agreed, saying that the constitution had put the Supreme Electoral Tribunal in charge of elections and referenda, not the National Statistics Institute, which Zelaya had proposed to have run the count.[76] Whether or not Zelaya's removal from power had constitutional elements, the Honduran constitution explicitly protects all Hondurans from forced expulsion from Honduras.\n\n\nThe United States maintains a small military presence at one Honduran base. The two countries conduct joint peacekeeping, counter-narcotics, humanitarian, disaster relief, humanitarian, medical and civic action exercises. U.S. troops conduct and provide logistics support for a variety of bilateral and multilateral exercises. The United States is Honduras's chief trading partner.[43]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Armed Forces of Honduras\n\nHonduras has a military with the Honduran Army, Honduran Navy and Honduran Air Force.\n\n\nIn 2017, Honduras signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[77]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Departments of Honduras and Municipalities of Honduras\n\n![](image)The departmental divisions of Honduras\nHonduras is divided into 18 departments.

ZEDEs have a high level of autonomy with their own political system at a judicial, economic and administrative level, and are based on free market capitalism.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Honduras\nThis section is an excerpt from Economy of Honduras.[edit]\n![](image)San Pedro Sula, industrial center of Honduras\nThe economy of Honduras is based mostly on agriculture, which accounts for 14% of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013. The country's leading export is coffee (US$340\u00a0million), which accounted for 22% of the total Honduran export revenues. Bananas, formerly the country's second-largest export until being virtually wiped out by 1998's Hurricane Mitch, recovered in 2000 to 57% of pre-Mitch levels. Cultivated shrimp is another important export sector. Since the late 1970s, towns in the north began industrial production through maquiladoras, especially in San Pedro Sula and Puerto Cort\u00e9s.[78]\n\n\nHonduras has extensive forests, marine, and mineral resources, although widespread slash and burn agricultural methods continue to destroy Honduran forests. The Honduran economy grew 4.8% in 2000, recovering from the Mitch-induced recession (\u22121.9%) of 1999. The Honduran maquiladora sector, the third-largest in the world, continued its strong performance in 2000, providing employment to over 120,000 and generating more than $528\u00a0 million in foreign exchange for the country. Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, was 10.1% in 2000, down slightly from the 10.9% recorded in 1999. The country's international reserve position continued to be strong in 2000, at slightly over US$1 billion. Remittances from Hondurans living abroad (mostly in the United States) rose 28% to $410 million in 2000. The Lempira (currency) was devaluing for many years, but stabilized at L19 to the United States dollar in 2005. The Honduran people are among the poorest in Latin America; gross national income per capita (2007) is US$1,649; the average for Central America is $6,736.[79]\nHonduras is the fourth poorest country in the Western Hemisphere; only Haiti, Nicaragua, and Guyana are poorer. Using alternative statistical measurements in addition to the gross domestic product can provide greater context for the nation's poverty.\n\n\nThe country signed an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) \u2013 later converted to a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) with the International Monetary Fund in March 1999. Honduras (as of the about year 2000) continues to maintain stable macroeconomic policies. It has not been swift in implementing structural changes, such as privatization of the publicly owned telephone and energy distribution companies\u2014changes which are desired by the IMF and other international lenders. Honduras received significant debt relief in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, including the suspension of bilateral debt service payments and bilateral debt reduction by the Paris Club\u2014including the United States \u2013 worth over $400\u00a0 million. In July 2000, Honduras reached its decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), qualifying the country for interim multilateral debt relief.\n\n\nLand appears to be plentiful and readily exploitable, but the presence of apparently extensive land is misleading because the nation's rugged, mountainous terrain restricts large-scale agricultural production to narrow strips on the coasts and to a few fertile valleys. Honduras's manufacturing sector has not yet developed beyond simple textile and agricultural processing industries and assembly operations. The small domestic market and competition from more industrially advanced countries in the region have inhibited more complex industrialization.\n\n\n\nIn 2022, according to the National Institute of Statistics of Honduras (INE), 73% of the country's population is poor and 53% lives in extreme poverty.[80] The country is one of the most unequal in Latin America.[81]\n![](image)Historical GDP per capita development of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras\n### Poverty[edit]\n\n\nThe World Bank categorizes Honduras as a low middle-income nation.[82] The nation's per capita income sits at around 600 US dollars making it one of the lowest in North America.[83]\n\n\nIn 2010, 50% of the population were living below the poverty line.[84] By 2016 more than 66% were living below the poverty line.[82]\n\n\nEconomic growth in the last few years has averaged 7% a year, one of the highest rates in Latin America (2010).[82] Despite this, Honduras has seen the least development amongst all Central American countries.[85] Honduras is ranked 130 of 188 countries with a Human Development Index of .625 that classifies the nation as having medium development (2015).[11] The three factors that go into Honduras's HDI (an extended and healthy life, accessibility of knowledge and standard of living) have all improved since 1990 but still remain relatively low with life expectancy at birth being 73.3, expected years of schooling being 11.2 (mean of 6.2 years) and GNI per capita being $4,466 (2015).[11] The HDI for Latin America and the Caribbean overall is 0.751 with life expectancy at birth being 68.6, expected years of schooling being 11.5 (mean of 6.6) and GNI per capita being $6,281 (2015).[11]\n\n\nThe 2009 Honduran coup d'\u00e9tat led to a variety of economic trends in the nation.[86] Overall growth has slowed, averaging 5.7 percent from 2006 to 2008 but slowing to 3.5 percent annually between 2010 and 2013.[86] Following the coup trends of decreasing poverty and extreme poverty were reversed. The nation saw a poverty increase of 13.2 percent and in extreme poverty of 26.3 percent in just 3 years.[86] Furthermore, unemployment grew between 2008 and 2012 from 6.8 percent to 14.1 percent.[86]\n\n\nBecause much of the Honduran economy is based on small scale agriculture of only a few exports, natural disasters have a particularly devastating impact. Natural disasters, such as 1998 Hurricane Mitch, have contributed to this inequality as they particularly affect poor rural areas.[87] Additionally, they are a large contributor to food insecurity in the country as farmers are left unable to provide for their families.[87] A study done by Honduras NGO, World Neighbors, determined the terms \"increased workload, decreased basic grains, expensive food, and fear\" were most associated with Hurricane Mitch.[88]\n\n\nThe rural and urban poor were hit hardest by Hurricane Mitch.[87] Those in southern and western regions specifically were considered most vulnerable as they both were subject to environmental destruction and home to many subsistence farmers.[87] Due to disasters such as Hurricane Mitch, the agricultural economic sector has declined a third in the past twenty years.[87] This is mostly due to a decline in exports, such as bananas and coffee, that were affected by factors such as natural disasters.[87] Indigenous communities along the Patuca River were hit extremely hard as well.[9] The mid-Pataca region was almost completely destroyed.[9] Over 80% of rice harvest and all of banana, plantain, and manioc harvests were lost.[9] Relief and reconstruction efforts following the storm were partial and incomplete, reinforcing existing levels of poverty rather than reversing those levels, especially for indigenous communities.[9] The period between the end of food donations and the following harvest led to extreme hunger, causing deaths amongst the Tawahka population.[9] Those that were considered the most \"land-rich\" lost 36% of their total land on average.[9] Those that were the most \"land-poor\", lost less total land but a greater share of their overall total.[9] This meant that those hit hardest were single women as they constitute the majority of this population.[9]\n\n\n\n### Poverty reduction strategies[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1970s when Honduras was designated a \"food priority country\" by the UN, organizations such as The World Food Program (WFP) have worked to decrease malnutrition and food insecurity.[89] A large majority of Honduran farmers live in extreme poverty, or below 180 US dollars per capita.[90] Currently one fourth of children are affected by chronic malnutrition.[89] WFP is currently working with the Honduran government on a School Feeding Program which provides meals for 21,000 Honduran schools, reaching 1.4 million school children.[89] WFP also participates in disaster relief through reparations and emergency response in order to aid in quick recovery that tackles the effects of natural disasters on agricultural production.[89]\n\n\nHonduras's Poverty Reduction Strategy was implemented in 1999 and aimed to cut extreme poverty in half by 2015.[91] While spending on poverty-reduction aid increased there was only a 2.5% increase in GDP between 1999 and 2002.[92] This improvement left Honduras still below that of countries that lacked aid through Poverty Reduction Strategy behind those without it.[92] The World Bank believes that this inefficiency stems from a lack of focus on infrastructure and rural development.[92] Extreme poverty saw a low of 36.2 percent only two years after the implementation of the strategy but then increased to 66.5 percent by 2012.[86]\n\n\nPoverty Reduction Strategies were also intended to affect social policy through increased investment in education and health sectors.[93] This was expected to lift poor communities out of poverty while also increasing the workforce as a means of stimulating the Honduran economy.[93] Conditional cash transfers were used to do this by the Family Assistance Program.[93] This program was restructured in 1998 in an attempt to increase effectiveness of cash transfers for health and education specifically for those in extreme poverty.[93] Overall spending within Poverty Reduction Strategies have been focused on education and health sectors increasing social spending from 44% of Honduras's GDP in 2000 to 51% in 2004.[93]\n\n\nCritics of aid from International Finance Institutions believe that the World Bank's Poverty Reduction Strategy result in little substantive change to Honduran policy.[93] Poverty Reduction Strategies also excluded clear priorities, specific intervention strategy, strong commitment to the strategy and more effective macro-level economic reforms according to Jose Cuesta of Cambridge University.[92] Due to this he believes that the strategy did not provide a pathway for economic development that could lift Honduras out of poverty resulting in neither lasting economic growth of poverty reduction.[92]\n\n\nPrior to its 2009 coup Honduras widely expanded social spending and an extreme increase in minimum wage.[86] Efforts to decrease inequality were swiftly reversed following the coup.[86] When Zelaya was removed from office social spending as a percent of GDP decreased from 13.3 percent in 2009 to 10.9 recent in 2012.[86] This decrease in social spending exacerbated the effects of the recession, which the nation was previously relatively well equipped to deal with.[86]\n\n\n\n### Economic inequality[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Slum in Tegucigalpa\nLevels of income inequality in Honduras are higher than in any other Latin American country.[86] Unlike other Latin American countries, inequality steadily increased in Honduras between 1991 and 2005.[91] Between 2006 and 2010 inequality saw a decrease but increased again in 2010.[86]\n\n\nWhen Honduras's Human Development Index is adjusted for inequality (known as the IHDI) Honduras's development index is reduced to .443.[11] The levels of inequality in each aspect of development can also be assessed.[11] In 2015 inequality of life expectancy at birth was 19.6%, inequality in education was 24.4% and inequality in income was 41.5% [11] The overall loss in human development due to inequality was 29.2.[11]\n\n\nThe IHDI for Latin America and the Caribbean overall is 0.575 with an overall loss of 23.4%.[11] In 2015 for the entire region, inequality of life expectancy at birth was 22.9%, inequality in education was 14.0% and inequality in income was 34.9%.[11] While Honduras has a higher life expectancy than other countries in the region (before and after inequality adjustments), its quality of education and economic standard of living are lower.[11] Income inequality and education inequality have a large impact on the overall development of the nation.[11]\n\n\nInequality also exists between rural and urban areas as it relates to the distribution of resources.[94] Poverty is concentrated in southern, eastern, and western regions where rural and indigenous peoples live. North and central Honduras are home to the country's industries and infrastructure, resulting in low levels of poverty.[83] Poverty is concentrated in rural Honduras, a pattern that is reflected throughout Latin America.[12] The effects of poverty on rural communities are vast. Poor communities typically live in adobe homes, lack material resources, have limited access to medical resources, and live off of basics such as rice, maize and beans.[95]\n\n\nThe lower class predominantly consists of rural subsistence farmers and landless peasants.[96] Since 1965 there has been an increase in the number of landless peasants in Honduras which has led to a growing class of urban poor individuals.[96] These individuals often migrate to urban centers in search of work in the service sector, manufacturing, or construction.[96] Demographers believe that without social and economic reform, rural to urban migration will increase, resulting in the expansion of urban centers.[96] Within the lower class, underemployment is a major issue.[96] Individuals that are underemployed often only work as part-time laborers on seasonal farms meaning their annual income remains low.[96] In the 1980s peasant organizations and labor unions such as the National Federation of Honduran Peasants, The National Association of Honduran Peasants and the National Union of Peasants formed.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)An indigenous family in a small mountain village in Honduras\nIt is not uncommon for rural individuals to voluntarily enlist in the military, however this often does not offer stable or promising career opportunities.[97] The majority of high-ranking officials in the Honduran army are recruited from elite military academies.[97] Additionally, the majority of enlistment in the military is forced.[97] Forced recruitment largely relies on an alliance between the Honduran government, military and upper class Honduran society.[97] In urban areas males are often sought out from secondary schools while in rural areas roadblocks aided the military in handpicking recruits.[97] Higher socio-economic status enables individuals to more easily evade the draft.[97]\n\n\nMiddle class Honduras is a small group defined by relatively low membership and income levels.[96] Movement from lower to middle class is typically facilitated by higher education.[96] Professionals, students, farmers, merchants, business employees, and civil servants are all considered a part of the Honduran middle class.[96] Opportunities for employment and the industrial and commercial sectors are slow-growing, limiting middle class membership.[96]\n\n\nThe Honduran upper class has much higher income levels than the rest of the Honduran population reflecting large amounts of income inequality.[96] Much of the upper class affords their success to the growth of cotton and livestock exports post-World War II.[96] The wealthy are not politically unified and differ in political and economic views.[96]\n\n\n\n### Trade[edit]\n\n\n![](image)San Pedro Sula is a major center of business and commerce in Honduras, and is home to many large manufacturers and companies. It is often referred to as \"La Capital Industrial\".[98]\nThe currency is the Honduran lempira.\n\n\nThe government operates both the electrical grid, Empresa Nacional de Energ\u00eda El\u00e9ctrica (ENEE) and the land-line telephone service, Hondutel. ENEE receives heavy subsidies to counter its chronic financial problems, but Hondutel is no longer a monopoly. The telecommunication sector was opened to private investment on 25 December 2005, as required under CAFTA. The price of petroleum is regulated, and the Congress often ratifies temporary price regulation for basic commodities.\n\n\nGold, silver, lead and zinc are mined.[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)CAFTA countries\nIn 2005 Honduras signed CAFTA, a free trade agreement with the United States. In December 2005, Puerto Cort\u00e9s, the primary seaport of Honduras, was included in the U.S. Container Security Initiative.[100]\n\n\nIn 2006 the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Energy announced the first phase of the Secure Freight Initiative (SFI), which built upon existing port security measures. SFI gave the U.S. government enhanced authority, allowing it to scan containers from overseas[*clarification needed*] for nuclear and radiological materials in order to improve the risk assessment of individual US-bound containers. The initial phase of Secure Freight involved deploying of nuclear detection and other devices to six foreign ports:\n\n\n\n* Port Qasim in Pakistan;\n* Puerto Cort\u00e9s in Honduras;\n* Southampton in the United Kingdom;\n* Port of Salalah in Oman;\n* Port of Singapore;\n* Gamman Terminal at Port Busan, Korea.\n\n\nContainers in these ports have been scanned since 2007 for radiation and other risk factors before they are allowed to depart for the United States.[101]\n\n\nFor economic development a 2012 memorandum of understanding with a group of international investors obtained Honduran government approval to build a zone (city) with its own laws, tax system, judiciary and police, but opponents brought a suit against it in the Supreme Court, calling it a \"state within a state\".[102] In 2013, Honduras's Congress ratified Decree 120, which led to the establishment of ZEDEs. The government began construction of the first zones in June 2015.[103]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Electricity sector in Honduras\n\nAbout half of the electricity sector in Honduras is privately owned. The remaining generation capacity is run by ENEE (*Empresa Nacional de Energ\u00eda El\u00e9ctrica*).\nKey challenges in the sector are:\n\n\n\n* Financing investments in generation and transmission without either a financially healthy utility or concessionary funds from external donors\n* Re-balancing tariffs, cutting arrears and reducing losses, including electricity theft, without social unrest\n* Reconciling environmental concerns with government objectives \u2013 two large new dams and associated hydropower plants.\n* Improving access to electricity in rural areas.\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A highway in Honduras\nInfrastructure for transportation in Honduras consists of: 699 kilometres (434 miles) of railways; 13,603 kilometres (8,453 miles) of roadways;[1] six ports;[104] and 112 airports altogether (12 Paved, 100 unpaved).[1] The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Housing (SOPRTRAVI in Spanish acronym) is responsible for transport sector policy.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Honduras\n\nHonduras had a population of 10,278,345 in 2021.[14][15] The proportion of the population below the age of 15 in 2010 was 36.8%, 58.9% were between 15 and 65 years old, and 4.3% were 65 years old or older.[105]\n\n\nSince 1975, emigration from Honduras has accelerated as economic migrants and political refugees sought a better life elsewhere. A majority of expatriate Hondurans live in the United States. A 2012 US State Department estimate suggested that between 800,000 and one million Hondurans lived in the United States at that time, nearly 15% of the Honduran population.[43] The large uncertainty about numbers is because numerous Hondurans live in the United States without a visa. In the 2010 census in the United States, 617,392 residents identified as Hondurans, up from 217,569 in 2000.[106]\n\n\n\n### Race and ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nEthnic groups in Honduras\u00a0%[107]\n\n\n\nMestizo (mixed Amerindian and European) (90%)\nAmerindians (7%)\nBlacks (2%)\nWhites (1%)\n\nThe ethnic breakdown of Honduran society was 90% Mestizo, 7% American Indian, 2% Black and 1% White (2017).[12] The 1927 Honduran census provides no racial data but in 1930 five classifications were created: white, Indian, Negro, yellow, and mestizo.[108] This system was used in the 1935 and 1940 census.[108] Mestizo was used to describe individuals that did not fit neatly into the categories of white, American Indian, negro or yellow or who are of mixed white-American Indian descent.[108]\n\n\nJohn Gillin considers Honduras to be one of thirteen \"Mestizo countries\" (Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay).[109] He claims that in much of Spanish America little attention is paid to race and race mixture resulting in social status having little reliance on one's physical features.[109] However, in \"Mestizo countries\" such as Honduras, this is not the case.[109] Social stratification from Spain was able to develop in these countries through colonization.[109]\n\n\nDuring colonization the majority of Honduras's indigenous population died of diseases like smallpox and measles resulting in a more homogenous indigenous population compared to other colonies.[96] Nine indigenous and African groups are recognized by the government in Honduras.[110] The majority of Amerindians in Honduras are Lenca, followed by the Miskito, Cho'rti', Tolupan, Pech and Sumo.[110] Around 50,000 Lenca individuals live in the west and western interior of Honduras while the other small native groups are located throughout the country.[96]\n\n\nThe majority of blacks in Honduras are ladino, meaning they are culturally Latino.[96] Non-ladino groups in Honduras include the Garifuna, Miskito, Bay Island Creoles, and Arab immigrants. [96] The Garifunas descended from freed slaves from the island of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.[96] The Bay Island Creoles are the descendants of freed African slaves from the British empire, who administered the Bay Islands from early 17th century to 1850. The Creoles, the Garinagu, and the Miskitos are extremely racially diverse.[96] While the Garinagu and Miskitos have similar origins, Garifunas are considered black while Miskitos are considered indigenous.[96] This is largely a reflection of cultural differences, as Garinagu have retained much of their original African culture.[96] The majority of Arab Hondurans are of Palestinian and Lebanese descent.[96] They are known as \"turcos\" in Honduras because of migration during the rule of the Ottoman Empire.[96] They have maintained cultural distinctiveness and prospered economically.[96]\n\n\n\n### Gender[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Gender inequality in Honduras\n\nThe male to female ratio of the Honduran population is 1.01. This ratio stands at 1.05 at birth, 1.04 from 15 to 24 years old, 1.02 from 25 to 54 years old, .88 from 55 to 64 years old, and .77 for those 65 years or older.[12]\n\n\nThe Gender Development Index (GDI) was .942 in 2015 with an HDI of .600 for females and .637 for males.[11] Life expectancy at birth for males is 70.9 and 75.9 for females.[11] Expected years of schooling in Honduras is 10.9 years for males (mean of 6.1) and 11.6 for females (mean of 6.2).[11] These measures do not reveal a large disparity between male and female development levels, however, GNI per capita is vastly different by gender.[11] Males have a GNI per capita of $6,254 while that of females is only $2,680.[11] Honduras's overall GDI is higher than that of other medium HDI nations (.871) but lower than the overall HDI for Latin America and the Caribbean (.981).[11]\n\n\nThe United Nations Development Program (UNDP) ranks Honduras 116th for measures including women's political power, and female access to resources.[111] The Gender Inequality Index (GII) depicts gender-based inequalities in Honduras according to reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity.[11] Honduras has a GII of .461 and ranked 101 of 159 countries in 2015.[11] 25.8% of Honduras's parliament is female and 33.4% of adult females have a secondary education or higher while only 31.1% of adult males do.[11] Despite this, while male participation in the labor market is 84.4, female participation is 47.2%.[11] Honduras's maternal mortality ratio is 129 and the adolescent birth rate is 65.0 for women ages 15\u201319.[11]\n\n\nFamilialism and machismo carry a lot of weight within Honduran society.[112] Familialism refers to the idea of individual interests being second to that of the family, most often in relation to dating and marriage, abstinence, and parental approval and supervision of dating.[112] Aggression and proof of masculinity through physical dominance are characteristic of machismo.[112]\n\n\nHonduras has historically functioned with a patriarchal system like many other Latin American countries.[113] Honduran men claim responsibility for family decisions including reproductive health decisions.[113] Recently Honduras has seen an increase in challenges to this notion as feminist movements and access to global media increases.[113] There has been an increase in educational attainment, labor force participating, urban migration, late-age marriage, and contraceptive use amongst Honduran women.[113]\n\n\nBetween 1971 and 2001 Honduran total fertility rate decreased from 7.4 births to 4.4 births.[113] This is largely attributable to an increase in educational attainment and workforce participation by women, as well as more widespread use of contraceptives.[113] In 1996 50% of women were using at least one type of contraceptive.[113] By 2001 62% were largely due to female sterilization, birth control in the form of a pill, injectable birth control, and IUDs.[113] A study done in 2001 of Honduran men and women reflect conceptualization of reproductive health and decision making in Honduras.[113] 28% of men and 25% of women surveyed believed men were responsible for decisions regarding family size and family planning uses.[113] 21% of men believed men were responsible for both.[113]\n\n\nSexual violence against women has proven to be a large issue in Honduras that has caused many to migrate to the U.S.[114] The prevalence of child sexual abuse was 7.8% in Honduras with the majority of reports being from children under the age of 11.[115] Women that experienced sexual abuse as children were found to be twice as likely to be in violent relationships.[115] Femicide is widespread in Honduras.[114] In 2014, 40% of unaccompanied refugee minors were female.[114] Gangs are largely responsible for sexual violence against women as they often use sexual violence.[114] Between 2005 and 2013 according to the UN Special Repporteur on Violence Against Women, violent deaths increased 263.4 percent.[114] Impunity for sexual violence and femicide crimes was 95 percent in 2014.[114] Additionally, many girls are forced into human trafficking and prostitution.[114]\n\n\nBetween 1995 and 1997 Honduras recognized domestic violence as both a public health issue and a punishable offense due to efforts by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).[111] PAHO's subcommittee on Women, Health and Development was used as a guide to develop programs that aid in domestic violence prevention and victim assistance programs [111] However, a study done in 2009 showed that while the policy requires health care providers to report cases of sexual violence, emergency contraception, and victim referral to legal institutions and support groups, very few other regulations exist within the realm of registry, examination and follow-up.[116] Unlike other Central American countries such as El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua, Honduras does not have detailed guidelines requiring service providers to be extensively trained and respect the rights of sexual violence victims.[116] Since the study was done the UNFPA and the Health Secretariat of Honduras have worked to develop and implement improved guidelines for handling cases of sexual violence.[116]\n\n\nAn educational program in Honduras known as *Sistema de Aprendizaje Tutorial* (SAT) has attempted to \"undo gender\" through focusing on gender equality in everyday interactions.[117] Honduras's SAT program is one of the largest in the world, second only to Colombia's with 6,000 students.[117] It is currently sponsored by *Asociacion Bayan*, a Honduran NGO, and the Honduran Ministry of Education.[117] It functions by integrating gender into curriculum topics, linking gender to the ideas of justice and equality, encouraging reflection, dialogue and debate and emphasizing the need for individual and social change.[117] This program was found to increase gender consciousness and a desire for gender equality amongst Honduran women through encouraging discourse surrounding existing gender inequality in the Honduran communities.[117]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nSpanish is the official, national language, spoken by virtually all Hondurans. In addition to Spanish, a number of indigenous languages are spoken in some small communities. Other languages spoken by some include Honduran sign language and Bay Islands Creole English.[118]\n\n\nThe main indigenous languages are:\n\n\n\n* Garifuna (Arawakan) (almost 100,000 speakers in Honduras including monolinguals)\n* M\u00edskito (Misumalpan) (29,000 speakers in Honduras)\n* Mayangna (Misumalpan) (less than 1000 speakers in Honduras, more in Nicaragua)\n* Pech/Paya, (Chibchan) (less than 1000 speakers)\n* Tol (Jicaquean) (less than 500 speakers)\n* Ch'orti' (Mayan) (less than 50 speakers)\n\n\nThe Lenca isolate lost all its fluent native speakers in the 20th century but is currently undergoing revival efforts among the members of the ethnic population of about 100,000. The largest immigrant languages are Arabic (42,000), Armenian (1,300), Turkish (900), Yue Chinese (1,000).[118]\n\n\n\n### Largest cities[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of cities in Honduras\n\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in HondurasAccording to the 2013 Census[119]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank\n | Name | Department | Municipal pop.\n |  |\n| ![Tegucigalpa](image)Tegucigalpa![San Pedro Sula](image)San Pedro Sula | 1 | Tegucigalpa | Francisco Moraz\u00e1n | 996,658\n | ![La Ceiba](image)La Ceiba![Choloma](image)Choloma |\n| 2 | San Pedro Sula | Cort\u00e9s | 598,519\n |\n| 3 | La Ceiba | Atl\u00e1ntida | 176,212\n |\n| 4 | Choloma | Cort\u00e9s | 163,818\n |\n| 5 | El Progreso | Yoro | 114,934\n |\n| 6 | Comayagua | Comayagua | 92,883\n |\n| 7 | Choluteca | Choluteca | 86,179\n |\n| 8 | Danl\u00ed | El Para\u00edso | 64,976\n |\n| 9 | La Lima | Cort\u00e9s | 62,903\n |\n| 10 | Villanueva | Cort\u00e9s | 62,711\n |\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Honduras\n\nReligions: in Honduras\u00a0%[107]\n\n\n\nCatholic (46%)\nProtestant (39%)\n\nAlthough most Hondurans are nominally Catholic (which would be considered the main religion), membership in the Catholic Church is declining while membership in Protestant churches is increasing. The International Religious Freedom Report, 2008, notes that a CID Gallup poll reported that 51.4% of the population identified themselves as Catholic, 36.2% as evangelical Protestant, 1.3% claiming to be from other religions, including Muslims, Buddhists, Jews, Rastafarians, etc. and 11.1% do not belong to any religion or unresponsive. 8% reported as being either atheistic or agnostic. Customary Catholic church tallies and membership estimates 81% Catholic where the priest (in more than 185 parishes) is required to fill out a pastoral account of the parish each year.[120][121]\n\n\nThe CIA Factbook lists Honduras as 97% Catholic and 3% Protestant.[1] Commenting on statistical variations everywhere, John Green of Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life notes that: \"It isn't that ... numbers are more right than [someone else's] numbers ... but how one conceptualizes the group.\"[122] Often people attend one church without giving up their \"home\" church. Many who attend evangelical megachurches in the US, for example, attend more than one church.[123] This shifting and fluidity is common in Brazil where two-fifths of those who were raised evangelical are no longer evangelical and Catholics seem to shift in and out of various churches, often while still remaining Catholic.[124]\n\n\nMost pollsters suggest an annual poll taken over a number of years would provide the best method of knowing religious demographics and variations in any single country. Still, in Honduras are thriving Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist, Seventh-day Adventist, Lutheran, Latter-day Saint (Mormon) and Pentecostal churches. There are Protestant seminaries. The Catholic Church, still the only \"church\" that is recognized, is also thriving in the number of schools, hospitals, and pastoral institutions (including its own medical school) that it operates. Its archbishop, Cardinal \u00d3scar Andr\u00e9s Rodriguez Maradiaga, is also very popular with the government, other churches, and in his own church. Practitioners of the Buddhist, Jewish, Islamic, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed, Rastafari and indigenous denominations and religions exist.[125]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nSee Health in Honduras\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Honduras\n\nAbout 83.6% of the population are literate and the net primary enrollment rate was 94% in 2004.[126] In 2014, the primary school *completion* rate was 90.7%.[127] Honduras has bilingual (Spanish and English) and even trilingual (Spanish with English, Arabic, or German) schools and numerous universities.[128]\n\n\nThe higher education is governed by the National Autonomous University of Honduras which has centers in the most important cities of Honduras. Hondura was ranked 116th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[129]\n\n\n\n### Crime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crime in Honduras\n\nCrime in Honduras is rampant and criminals operate with a high degree of impunity. Honduras has one of the highest national murder rates in the world; cities such as San Pedro Sula and the Tegucigalpa likewise have registered homicide rates among the highest in the world. The violence is associated with drug trafficking as Honduras is often a transit point, and with a number of urban gangs, mainly the MS-13 and the 18th Street gang. Homicide violence reached a peak in 2012 with an average of 20 homicides a day.[130] Official statistics from the Honduran Observatory on National Violence show Honduras's homicide rate was 60 per 100,000 in 2015 with the majority of homicide cases unprosecuted.[131] But as recently as 2017, organizations such as InSight Crime's show figures of 42 per 100,000 inhabitants,[132] a 26% drop from 2016 figures.\n\n\nHighway assaults and carjackings at roadblocks or checkpoints set up by criminals with police uniforms and equipment occur frequently. Although reports of kidnappings of foreigners are not common, families of kidnapping victims often pay ransoms without reporting the crime to police out of fear of retribution, so kidnapping figures may be underreported.[131]\n\n\nViolence in Honduras increased after Plan Colombia was implemented and after Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n declared the war against drug trafficking in Mexico.[133] Along with neighboring El Salvador and Guatemala, Honduras forms part of the Northern Triangle of Central America, which has been characterized as one of the most violent regions in the world.[134] As a result of crime and increasing murder rates, the flow of migrants from Honduras to the U.S. also went up. The rise in violence in the region has received international attention.\n\n\nOwing to measures taken by government and business in 2014 to improve tourist safety, Roatan and the Bay Islands have lower crime rates than the Honduran mainland.[131]\n\n\nIn the less populated region of Gracias a Dios, narcotics-trafficking is rampant and police presence is scarce. Threats against U.S. citizens by drug traffickers and other criminal organizations have resulted in the U.S. Embassy placing restrictions on the travel of U.S. officials through the region.[131]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Other important painters include Carlos Garay, and Roque Zelaya. Some of Honduras's most notable writers are Lucila Gamero de Medina, Froyl\u00e1n Turcios, Ram\u00f3n Amaya Amador and Juan Pablo Suazo Euceda, Marco Antonio Rosa,[135] Roberto Sosa, Eduardo B\u00e4hr, Amanda Castro, Javier Abril Espinoza, Te\u00f3filo Trejo, and Roberto Quesada.\n\n\nThe Jos\u00e9 Francisco Saybe theater in San Pedro Sula is home to the C\u00edrculo Teatral Sampedrano (Theatrical Circle of San Pedro Sula)\n\n\nHonduras has experienced a boom from its film industry for the past two decades. Since the premiere of the movie \"Anita la cazadora de insectos\" in 2001, the level of Honduran productions has increased, many collaborating with countries such as Mexico, Colombia, and the U.S. The most well known Honduran films are \"El Xendra\", \"Amor y Frijoles\", and \"Cafe con aroma a mi tierra\".\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Honduran cuisine\n\nHonduran cuisine is a fusion of indigenous Lenca cuisine, Spanish cuisine, Caribbean cuisine and African cuisine. There are also dishes from the Garifuna people. Coconut and coconut milk are featured in both sweet and savory dishes. Regional specialties include fried fish, tamales, carne asada and baleadas.\n\n\nOther popular dishes include: meat roasted with chismol and carne asada, chicken with rice and corn, and fried fish with pickled onions and jalape\u00f1os. Some of the ways seafood and some meats are prepared in coastal areas and in the Bay Islands involve coconut milk.\n\n\nThe soups Hondurans enjoy include bean soup, mondongo soup (tripe soup), seafood soups and beef soups. Generally these soups are served mixed with plantains, yuca, and cabbage, and served with corn tortillas.\n\n\nOther typical dishes are the montucas or corn tamales, stuffed tortillas, and tamales wrapped in plantain leaves. Honduran typical dishes also include an abundant selection of tropical fruits such as papaya, pineapple, plum, sapote, passion fruit and bananas which are prepared in many ways while they are still green.\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Media of Honduras\n\nAt least half of Honduran households have at least one television. Public television has a far smaller role than in most other countries. Honduras's main newspapers are La Prensa, El Heraldo, La Tribuna and Diario Tiempo. The official newspaper is La Gaceta (Honduras)\u00a0[es].\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Music of Honduras\n\nPunta is the main music of Honduras, with other sounds such as Caribbean salsa, merengue, reggae, and reggaeton all widely heard, especially in the north, and Mexican rancheras heard in the rural interior of the country. The most well known musicians are Guillermo Anderson and Polache. Banda Blanca is a widely known music group in both Honduras and internationally.\n\n\n\n### Celebrations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Public holidays in Honduras\n\n![](image)Sawdust carpets of Comayagua during Easter celebrations\nSome of Honduras's national holidays include Honduras Independence Day on 15 September and Children's Day or D\u00eda del Ni\u00f1o, which is celebrated in homes, schools and churches on 10 September; on this day, children receive presents and have parties similar to Christmas or birthday celebrations. Some neighborhoods have pi\u00f1atas on the street. Other holidays are Easter, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Day of the Soldier (3 October to celebrate the birth of Francisco Moraz\u00e1n), Christmas, El Dia de Lempira on 20 July,[136] and New Year's Eve.\n\n\nHonduras Independence Day festivities start early in the morning with marching bands. Each band wears different colors and features cheerleaders. Fiesta Catracha takes place this same day: typical Honduran foods such as beans, tamales, baleadas, cassava with chicharr\u00f3n, and tortillas are offered.\n\n\nOn Christmas Eve people reunite with their families and close friends to have dinner, then give out presents at midnight. In some cities fireworks are seen and heard at midnight. On New Year's Eve there is food and \"cohetes\", fireworks and festivities. Birthdays are also great events, and include pi\u00f1atas filled with candies and surprises for the children.\n\n\nLa Ceiba Carnival is celebrated in La Ceiba, a city located in the north coast, in the second half of May to celebrate the day of the city's patron saint Saint Isidore. People from all over the world come for one week of festivities. Every night there is a little carnaval (carnavalito) in a neighborhood. On Saturday there is a big parade with floats and displays with people from many countries. This celebration is also accompanied by the Milk Fair, where many Hondurans come to show off their farm products and animals.\n\n\n\n### National symbols[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The national bird, *Ara macao*\nThe flag of Honduras is composed of three equal horizontal stripes. The blue upper and lower stripes represent the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The central stripe is white. It contains five blue stars representing the five states of the Central American Union. The middle star represents Honduras, located in the center of the Central American Union.\n\n\nThe coat of arms was established in 1945. It is an equilateral triangle, at the base is a volcano between three castles, over which is a rainbow and the sun shining. The triangle is placed on an area that symbolizes being bathed by both seas. Around all of this an oval containing in golden lettering: \"Republic of Honduras, Free, Sovereign and Independent\".\n\n\nThe \"National Anthem of Honduras\" is a result of a contest carried out in 1914 during the presidency of Manuel Bonilla. In the end, it was the poet Augusto Coello that ended up writing the anthem, with German-born Honduran composer Carlos Hartling writing the music. The anthem was officially adopted on 15 November 1915, during the presidency of Alberto de Jes\u00fas Membre\u00f1o\u00a0[es]. The anthem is composed of a choir and seven stroonduran.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nThe national flower is the famous orchid, *Rhyncholaelia digbyana* (formerly known as *Brassavola digbyana*), which replaced the rose in 1969. The change of the national flower was carried out during the administration of general Oswaldo L\u00f3pez Arellano, thinking that *Brassavola digbyana* \"is an indigenous plant of Honduras; having this flower exceptional characteristics of beauty, vigor and distinction\", as the decree dictates it.\n\n\nThe national tree of Honduras was declared in 1928 to be simply \"the Pine that appears symbolically in our Coat of Arms\" (*el Pino que figura simb\u00f3licamente en nuestro Escudo*),[137] even though pines comprise a genus and not a species, and even though legally there's no specification as for what kind of pine should appear in the coat of arms *either*. Because of its commonality in the country, the *Pinus oocarpa* species has become since then the species most strongly associated as the national tree, but legally it is not so. Another species associated as the national tree is the *Pinus caribaea*.\n\n\nThe national mammal is the white-tailed deer (*Odocoileus virginianus*), which was adopted as a measure to avoid excessive depredation.[*clarification needed*] It is one of two species of deer that live in Honduras.\nThe national bird of Honduras is the scarlet macaw (*Ara macao*). This bird was much valued by the pre-Columbian civilizations of Honduras.\n\n\n\n### Folklore[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Honduran folklore\n\nLegends and fairy tales are paramount in Honduran culture. Lluvia de Peces (Rain of Fish) is an example of this. The legends of El Cadejo and La Llorona are also popular.\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Honduras\n\n![](image)Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Metropolitano in San Pedro Sula is the official ground of football in the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers.\n![](image)Mauricio Dub\u00f3n\u2013the first born and raised Honduran in the MLB\u2013preparing his shortstop play.\nFootball is the most popular sport in Honduras.[138] Honduras's first international competition began in 1921 at the Independence Centenary Games featuring neighboring countries in Central America.[139] The highest division of football is The Honduran National Professional Football League (Spanish: *La Liga Nacional de F\u00fatbol Profesional de Honduras*), which was established in 1964.[140] The league is recognized on a continental level, as C.D. Olimpia\u2013the only Honduran club to win the competition\u2013won the CONCACAF Champions League in 1972 and 1988.[141][142] The Honduras national football team (Spanish: *Selecci\u00f3n de f\u00fatbol de Honduras*) is considered one of the best nations in North America, as the country last won the CONCACAF Gold Cup in 1981 and placed third in 2013.[143][144] On a global scale, Honduras has competed in the FIFA World Cup three times in 1982, 2010, and 2014, although *Los Catrachos* have yet to win a game.[145][146][147]\n\n\nBaseball is the second most popular sport in Honduras.[148] Honduras's first international competition began in 1950 in the Baseball World Cup, which was the most prestigious global competition at the time.[149] The country lacks a division in baseball, likely due to the absence of competition in international baseball since 1973.[*citation needed*] The Honduras national baseball team (Spanish: *Selecci\u00f3n de b\u00e9isbol de Honduras*) is shy of being a top ten nation in North and South America due to infrequent scheduling, although competition is consistent and growing at the youth level.[150][151] Inspiration at the youth level came from Mauricio Dub\u00f3n being the first born and raised Honduran to start in Major League Baseball, who is currently competing today.[152]\n\n\nAll other sports tend to be minor at best, as Honduras has not won a medal in the Olympics and has not made notable results in other world championships yet.[153] However, Hondurans have consistently entered track & field and swimming games at the Summer Olympics since 1968 and 1984, respectively.[154] Occasionally, Honduras has competed in combat sports ranging from judo to boxing at the Summer Olympics as well.[155][156] Gender inequality in Honduras is present in the sports industry, as teams like the Honduras women's national football team (Spanish: *Selecci\u00f3n de f\u00fatbol de Honduras Femenina*) has yet to qualify in global and continental tournaments and softball being nearly nonexistent in the country.[157][158]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Honduras portal\n\n\n* Outline of Honduras\n* Index of Honduras-related articles\n* Water crisis in Honduras\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** /h\u0252n\u02c8dj\u028a\u0259r\u0259s, -\u00e6s/ \u24d8;[7] Spanish: [on\u02c8du\u027eas] \u24d8\n2. **^** Spanish: *Rep\u00fablica de Honduras*\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Honduras\". *The World Factbook*. 5 January 2016.

It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India in the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest city. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language.\n\n\nThe name \"Nepal\" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the era in ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. In the middle of the first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet. The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley's traders. The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture. By the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. The country was never colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India. Parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese Civil War in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular republic in 2008, ending the world's last Hindu monarchy.\n\n\nThe Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms the country as a secular federal parliamentary republic divided into seven provinces. Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and friendship treaties were signed with India in 1950 and China in 1960. Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), of which it is a founding member. Nepal is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bay of Bengal Initiative. The Nepalese Armed Forces are the fifth-largest in South Asia; and are notable for their Gurkha history, particularly during the world wars, and has been a significant contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Name of Nepal\n\n![](image)\"N\u0113p\u0101la\" in the late Brahmi script, in the Allahabad Pillar inscription of Samudragupta (350\u2013375 CE).[16]\nBefore the unification of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley was known as *Nepal*.[c] The precise origin of the term *Nep\u0101l* is uncertain. *Nepal* appears in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far back as the fourth century BC.[*which?*] An absolute chronology can not be established, as even the oldest texts may contain anonymous contributions dating as late as the early modern period. Academic attempts to provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a complete picture of history and insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman languages.[18]\n\n\nAccording to Hindu mythology, Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu sage called *Ne*, referred to variously as *Ne Muni* or *Nemi*. According to *Pashupati Pur\u0101na*, as a place protected by *Ne*, the country in the heart of the Himalayas came to be known as *Nep\u0101l*.[d] According to *Nep\u0101l Mah\u0101tmya*,[e] *Nemi* was charged with protection of the country by Pashupati.[19] According to Buddhist mythology, Manjushri Bodhisattva drained a primordial lake of serpents to create the Nepal valley and proclaimed that *Adi-Buddha* *Ne* would take care of the community that would settle it. As the cherished of *Ne*, the valley would be called *Nep\u0101l*.[20] According to *Gopalar\u0101jvamsh\u0101vali*, the genealogy of ancient Gopala dynasty compiled c.\u20091380s, Nepal is named after *Nepa* the cowherd, the founder of the Nepali scion of the Abhiras. In this account, the cow that issued milk to the spot, at which *Nepa* discovered the *Jyotirlinga* of *Pashupatin\u0101th* upon investigation, was also named *Ne*.[18]\n\n\nNorwegian indologist Christian Lassen had proposed that *Nep\u0101la* was a compound of *Nipa* (foot of a mountain) and *-ala* (short suffix for *alaya* meaning abode), and so *Nep\u0101la* meant \"abode at the foot of the mountain\". He considered *Ne Muni* to be a fabrication.[21] Indologist Sylvain Levi found Lassen's theory untenable but had no theories of his own, only suggesting that either *Newara* is a vulgarism of sanskritic *Nepala,* or *Nepala* is Sanskritisation of the local ethnic;[22] his view has found some support though it does not answer the question of etymology.[23][24][25][18] It has also been proposed that *Nepa* is a Tibeto-Burman stem consisting of *Ne* (cattle) and *Pa* (keeper), reflecting the fact that early inhabitants of the valley were *Gopalas* (cowherds) and *Mahispalas* (buffalo-herds).[18] Suniti Kumar Chatterji believed *Nepal* originated from Tibeto-Burman roots \u2013 *Ne,* of uncertain meaning (as multiple possibilities exist), and *pala* or *bal*, whose meaning is lost entirely.[26]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Nepal\n\n### Ancient Nepal[edit]\n\n\nAncient Nepal\n![](image)\nThis painting in a Laotian temple depicts a legend surrounding the birth of Gautama Buddha c.\u2009563 BC in Lumbini, Western Nepal.\n![](image)\nIn the premises of the Changu Narayan Temple, is a stone inscription dated 464 AD, the first in Nepal since the Ashoka inscription of Lumbini (c.\u2009250 BC).\n\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[27][28][29] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[30] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time.[31]\n\n\nAfter 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan.[32] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley civilisation,[33][32] the first urban culture in South Asia.[34] Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic origins have been discovered in the Siwalik hills of Dang district.[35] The earliest inhabitants of modern Nepal and adjoining areas are believed to be people from the Indus Valley civilisation. It is possible that the Dravidian people whose history predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other ethnic groups like the Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans from across the border.[36] By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese people had reached Nepal either directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via Myanmar and north-east India or both.[37] Stella Kramrisch (1964) mentions a substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and Dravidians, who were in Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient inhabitants of the valley of Kathmandu.[38]\n\n\nBy the late Vedic period, Nepal was being mentioned in various Hindu texts, such as the late Vedic *Atharvaveda Pari\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6da* and in the post-Vedic *Atharvashirsha* Upanishad.[39] The Gopal Bansa was the oldest dynasty to be mentioned in various texts as the earliest rulers of the central Himalayan kingdom known by the name 'Nepal'.[40] The Gopalas were followed by Kiratas who ruled for over 16 centuries by some accounts.[41] According to the Mahabharata, the then Kirata king went to take part in the Battle of Kurukshetra. In the south-eastern region, Janakpurdham was the capital of the prosperous kingdom of Videha or Mithila, that extended down to the Ganges, and home to King Janaka and his daughter, Sita.\n\n\nAround 600 BC, small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of Nepal. From one of these, the Shakya polity, arose a prince who later renounced his status to lead an ascetic life, founded Buddhism, and came to be known as Gautama Buddha (traditionally dated 563\u2013483 BC).[42] Nepal came to be established as a land of spirituality and refuge in the intervening centuries, played an important role in transmitting Buddhism to East Asia via Tibet,[43] and helped preserve Hindu and Buddhist manuscripts.\n\n\nBy 250 BC, the southern regions had come under the influence of the Maurya Empire. Emperor Ashoka made a pilgrimage to Lumbini and erected a pillar at Buddha's birthplace, the inscriptions on which mark the starting point for properly recorded history of Nepal.[44] Ashoka also visited the Kathmandu valley and built monuments commemorating Gautama Buddha's visit there. By the 4th century AD, much of Nepal was under the influence of the Gupta Empire.[f][45]\n\n\nIn the Kathmandu valley, the Kiratas were pushed eastward by the Licchavis, and the Licchavi dynasty came into power c. 400 AD. The Lichchhavis built monuments and left a series of inscriptions; Nepal's history of the period is pieced together almost entirely from them.[46][43] In 641, Songtsen Gampo of the Tibetan Empire sends Narendradeva back to Licchavi with an army and subjugates Nepal. Parts of Nepal and Licchavi was later under the direct influences of the Tibetan empire.[47] The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late 8th century and was followed by a Thakuri rule. Thakuri kings ruled over the country up to the middle of the 11th century AD; not much is known of this period that is often called the dark period.[48]\n\n\n\n### Medieval Nepal[edit]\n\n\nMedieval Nepal\n![](image)\nSinja Valley, thought to be the place of origin of the Khasas and the Nepali language, was at the heart of the Khas Malla empire.\n![](image)\nPatan Durbar Square, one of the three palace squares in the Kathmandu Valley, was built by the Mallas in the 17th century. The Durbar Squares are a culmination of over a millennium of development in Nepali art and architecture.\n\nIn the 11th century, a powerful empire of Khas people emerged in western Nepal whose territory at its highest peak included much of western Nepal as well as parts of western Tibet and Uttarakhand of India. By the 14th century, the empire had splintered into loosely associated *Baise rajyas*, literally 22 states as they were counted. The rich culture and language of the Khas people spread throughout Nepal and as far as Indo-China in the intervening centuries; their language, later renamed the Nepali language, became the lingua franca of Nepal as well as much of North-east India.[43]\n\n\nIn south-eastern Nepal, Simraungarh annexed Mithila around 1100 AD, and the unified Tirhut stood as a powerful kingdom for more than 200 years,[49] even ruling over Kathmandu for a time.[50] After another 300 years of Muslim rule, Tirhut came under the control of the Sens of Makawanpur.[49] In the eastern hills, a confederation of Kirat principalities ruled the area between Kathmandu and Bengal.\n\n\nIn the Kathmandu valley, the Mallas, who make several appearances in Nepalese history since ancient times, had established themselves in Kathmandu and Patan by the middle of the 14th century. The Mallas ruled the valley first under the suzerainty of Tirhut but established independent reign by late 14th century as Tirhut went into decline. In the late 14th century, Jayasthiti Malla introduced widespread socio-economic reforms, principal of which was the caste system. By dividing the indigenous non-Aryan Buddhist population into castes modelled after the four Varna system of Hinduism, he provided an influential model for the Sanskritisation and Hinduisation of the indigenous non-Hindu tribal populations in all principalities throughout Nepal. By the middle of the 15th century, Kathmandu had become a powerful empire which, according to Kirkpatrick, extended from Digarchi or Sigatse in Tibet to Tirhut and Gaya in India.[51] In the late 15th century, Malla princes divided their kingdom in four \u2013 Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur in the valley and Banepa to the east. The competition for prestige among these brotherly kingdoms saw the flourishing of art and architecture in central Nepal, and the building of famous Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur Durbar Squares; their division and mistrust led to their fall in the late 18th century, and ultimately, the unification of Nepal into a modern state.[43][52]\n\n\nApart from one destructive sacking of Kathmandu valley in the mid 14th century,[53] Nepal remains largely untouched by the Muslim invasion of India that began in the 11th century. The Mughal period saw an influx of high-caste Hindus from India into Nepal. They soon intermingled with the Khas people and by the 16th century, there were about 50 Rajput-ruled principalities in Nepal, including the 22 (Baisi) states and, to their east in west-central Nepal, 24 *Chaubisi* states. There emerged a view that Nepal remained the true bastion of unadulterated Hinduism at a time when Indian culture had been influenced by centuries of Mughal, followed by British rule. Gorkha, one of the Baisi states, emerged as an influential and ambitious kingdom with a reputation for justice, after it codified the first Hinduism-based laws in the Nepalese hills.[43]\n\n\n\n### Unification, expansion and consolidation (1768\u20131951)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kingdom of Nepal\n\n![](image)\nPrithvi Narayan Shah, began the unification process of what would become the present-day country of Nepal\n![](image)\nDuring Bhimsen Thapa's premiership Nepal reached its zenith\n![](image)\nJung Bahadur Rana, who established the autocratic Rana regime in 1846 and instituted a pro-British foreign policy\n![](image)\nDuring King Mahendra's reign, Nepal experienced a period of industrial, political, and economic change.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, Prithvi Narayan Shah, a Gorkha king, set out to put together what would become present-day Nepal. He embarked on his mission by securing the neutrality of the bordering mountain kingdoms. After several bloody battles and sieges, notably the Battle of Kirtipur, he managed to conquer the Kathmandu Valley in 1769.[54]\nThe Gorkha control reached its height when the Kumaon and Garhwal Kingdoms in the west to Sikkim in the east came under Nepalese control. A dispute with Tibet over the control of mountain passes and inner Tingri valleys of Tibet prompted the Qing Emperor of China to start the Sino-Nepali War compelling the Nepali to retreat to their own borders in the north.[55] The rivalry between the Kingdom of Nepal and the East India Company over the control of states bordering Nepal eventually led to the Anglo-Nepali War (1815\u201316). At first, the British underestimated the Nepali and were soundly defeated until committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing. Thus began the reputation of Gurkhas as fierce and ruthless soldiers. The war ended in the Sugauli Treaty, under which Nepal ceded recently captured lands.[56][43]\n\n\nFactionalism inside the royal family led to a period of instability. In 1846, a plot was discovered revealing that the reigning queen had planned to overthrow Jung Bahadur Kunwar, a fast-rising military leader. This led to the Kot massacre; armed clashes between military personnel and administrators loyal to the queen led to the execution of several hundred princes and chieftains around the country. Bir Narsingh Kunwar emerged victoriously and founded the Rana dynasty, and came to be known as Jung Bahadur Rana. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Ranas were staunchly pro-British and assisted them during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (and later in both World Wars). In 1860 some parts of the western Terai region were gifted to Nepal by the British as a friendly gesture because of her military help to sustain British control in India during the rebellion (known as *Naya Muluk*, new country). In 1923, the United Kingdom and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship that superseded the Sugauli Treaty of 1816.[57]\n\n\nThe Hindu practice of Sati, in which a widow sacrificed herself in the funeral pyre of her husband, was banned in 1919, and slavery was officially abolished in 1924.[58] Rana rule was marked by tyranny, debauchery, economic exploitation and religious persecution.[59][60]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary history[edit]\n\n\nIn the late 1940s, newly emerging pro-democracy movements and political parties in Nepal were critical of the Rana autocracy. Following the success of Indian Independence Movement which Nepalese activists had taken part in, with India's support and cooperation of King Tribhuvan, Nepali Congress was successful in toppling the Rana regime, establishing a parliamentary democracy. After a decade of power wrangling between the king and the government, King Mahendra (ruled 1955\u20131972) scrapped the democratic experiment in 1960, and a \"partyless\" Panchayat system was made to govern Nepal. The political parties were banned and politicians imprisoned or exiled.[61] The Panchayat rule modernised the country, introducing reforms and developing infrastructure, but curtailed liberties and imposed heavy censorship. In 1990, the People's Movement forced King Birendra (ruled 1972\u20132001) to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty democracy.[61][62]\n\n\nIn 1996, the Maoist Party started a violent bid to replace the royal parliamentary system with a people's republic.[61] This led to the long Nepali Civil War and more than 16,000 deaths.[63] With the death of both the King and the Crown Prince in a massacre in the royal palace, King Birendra's brother Gyanendra inherited the throne in 2001[61] and subsequently assumed full executive powers aiming to quash the Maoist insurgency himself.[64]\n\n\nThe Maoist Party joined mainstream politics following the success of the peaceful democratic revolution of 2006;[65] Nepal became a secular state,[66] and on 28 May 2008, it was declared a federal republic,[65] ending its time-honoured status as the world's only Hindu kingdom.[67] After a decade of instability and internal strife which saw two constituent assembly elections,[68][69][70][71] the new constitution was promulgated on 20 September 2015, making Nepal a federal democratic republic divided into seven provinces.[72][73]\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Nepal and Geology of Nepal\n\n![](image)A topographic map of Nepal\nNepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, about 800 kilometres (500\u00a0mi) long and 200 kilometres (120\u00a0mi) wide, with an area of 147,516\u00a0km2 (56,956\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It lies between latitudes 26\u00b0 and 31\u00b0N, and longitudes 80\u00b0 and 89\u00b0E. Nepal's defining geological processes began 75\u00a0million years ago when the Indian plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[74] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyn oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian plate.[74] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[74] The rising barriers blocked the paths of rivers creating large lakes, which only broke through as late as 100,000 years ago, creating fertile valleys in the middle hills like the Kathmandu Valley. In the western region, rivers which were too strong to be hampered, cut some of the world's deepest gorges.[75] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[76] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[77] Nepal lies almost completely within this collision zone, occupying the central sector of the Himalayan arc, nearly one-third of the 2,400\u00a0km (1,500\u00a0mi)-long Himalayas,[78][79][80][81][82][83] with a small strip of southernmost Nepal stretching into the Indo-Gangetic plain and two districts in the northwest stretching up to the Tibetan plateau.[75]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mount Everest, the highest peak on earth, lies on the Nepal\u2013China border.\nNepal is divided into three principal physiographic belts known as *Himal*\u2013*Pahad*\u2013*Terai*.[g] Himal is the mountain region containing snow and situated in the Great Himalayan Range; it makes up the northern part of Nepal. It contains the highest elevations in the world including 8,848.86 metres (29,032\u00a0ft) height Mount Everest (*Sagarm\u0101th\u0101* in Nepali) on the border with China. Seven other of the world's \"eight-thousanders\" are in Nepal or on its border with Tibet: Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu, Kangchenjunga, Dhaulagiri, Annapurna and Manaslu. Pahad is the mountain region that does not generally contain snow. The mountains vary from 800 to 4,000 metres (2,600 to 13,100\u00a0ft) in altitude, with progression from subtropical climates below 1,200 metres (3,900\u00a0ft) to alpine climates above 3,600 metres (11,800\u00a0ft). The Lower Himalayan Range, reaching 1,500 to 3,000 metres (4,900 to 9,800\u00a0ft), is the southern limit of this region, with subtropical river valleys and \"hills\" alternating to the north of this range. Population density is high in valleys but notably less above 2,000 metres (6,600\u00a0ft) and very low above 2,500 metres (8,200\u00a0ft), where snow occasionally falls in winter. The southern lowland plains or *Terai* bordering India are part of the northern rim of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Terai is the lowland region containing some hill ranges. The plains were formed and are fed by three major Himalayan rivers: the Koshi, the Narayani, and the Karnali as well as smaller rivers rising below the permanent snowline. This region has a subtropical to tropical climate. The outermost range of the foothills called Sivalik Hills or Churia Range, cresting at 700 to 1,000 metres (2,300 to 3,280\u00a0ft), marks the limits of the Gangetic Plain. Broad, low valleys called Inner Terai Valleys (*Bhitri Tarai Upatyaka*) lie north of these foothills in several places.\n\n\n\n![](image)K\u00f6ppen climate classification for Nepal\nThe Indian plate continues to move north relative to Asia at about 50\u00a0mm (2.0\u00a0in) per year.[84] This makes Nepal an earthquake-prone zone, and periodic earthquakes that have devastating consequences present a significant hurdle to development.[85] Erosion of the Himalayas is a very important source of sediment, which flows to the Indian Ocean.[86] Saptakoshi, in particular, carries a huge amount of silt out of Nepal but sees extreme drop in Gradient in Bihar, causing severe floods and course changes, and is, therefore, known as the sorrow of Bihar. Severe flooding and landslides cause deaths and disease, destroy farmlands and cripple the transport infrastructure of the country, during the monsoon season each year.\n\n\nNepal has five climatic zones, broadly corresponding to the altitudes. The tropical and subtropical zones lie below 1,200 metres (3,900\u00a0ft), the temperate zone 1,200 to 2,400 metres (3,900 to 7,900\u00a0ft), the cold zone 2,400 to 3,600 metres (7,900 to 11,800\u00a0ft), the subarctic zone 3,600 to 4,400 metres (11,800 to 14,400\u00a0ft), and the Arctic zone above 4,400 metres (14,400\u00a0ft). Nepal experiences five seasons: summer, monsoon, autumn, winter and spring. The Himalayas block cold winds from Central Asia in the winter and form the northern limits of the monsoon wind patterns.\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Nepal\n\nSee also: List of protected areas of Nepal and Community forestry in Nepal\n\n![](image)This land cover map of Nepal using Landsat 30\u00a0m (2010) data shows forest cover as the dominant type of land cover in Nepal.[87]\nNepal contains a disproportionately large diversity of plants and animals, relative to its size.[88][89] Nepal, in its entirety, forms the western portion of the eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot, with notable biocultural diversity.[90] The dramatic differences in elevation found in Nepal (60\u00a0m from sea level in the Terai plains, to 8,848\u00a0m Mount Everest)[91] result in a variety of biomes.[88] The Eastern half of Nepal is richer in biodiversity as it receives more rain, compared to western parts, where arctic desert-type conditions are more common at higher elevations.[89] Nepal is a habitat for 4.0% of all mammal species, 8.9% of bird species, 1.0% of reptile species, 2.5% of amphibian species, 1.9% of fish species, 3.7% of butterfly species, 0.5% of moth species and 0.4% of spider species.[89] In its 35 forest-types and 118 ecosystems,[88][h] Nepal harbours 2% of the flowering plant species, 3% of pteridophytes and 6% of bryophytes.[89]\n\n\n\n![](image)The greater one-horned rhinoceros roams the sub-tropical grasslands of the Terai plains.\nNepal's forest cover is 59,624\u00a0km2 (23,021\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), 40.36% of the country's total land area, with an additional 4.38% of scrubland, for a total forested area of 44.74%, an increase of 5% since the turn of the millennium.[92] The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.23/10, ranking it 45th globally out of 172 countries.[93] In the southern plains, Terai\u2013Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion contains some of the world's tallest grasses as well as *Sal* forests, tropical evergreen forests and tropical riverine deciduous forests.[94] In the lower hills (700\u00a0m \u2013 2,000\u00a0m), subtropical and temperate deciduous mixed forests containing mostly S*al* (in the lower altitudes), *Chilaune* and *Katus*, as well as subtropical pine forest dominated by chir pine are common. The middle hills (2,000\u00a0m \u2013 3,000\u00a0m) are dominated by oak and rhododendron. Subalpine coniferous forests cover the 3,000\u00a0m to 3,500\u00a0m range, dominated by oak (particularly in the west), Eastern Himalayan fir, Himalayan pine and Himalayan hemlock; rhododendron is common as well. Above 3,500\u00a0m in the west and 4,000\u00a0m in the east, coniferous trees give way to rhododendron-dominated alpine shrubs and meadows.[89]\n\n\nAmong the notable trees, are the astringent *Azadirachta indica*, or *neem*, which is widely used in traditional herbal medicine,[95] and the luxuriant *Ficus religiosa*, or *peepal*,[96] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro,[97] and under which Gautam Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.[98]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Himalayan monal (*Danphe*), the national bird of Nepal,[99] nests high in the Himalayas.\nMost of the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest of the lower Himalayan region is descended from the Tethyan Tertiary flora.[100] As the Indian Plate collided with Eurasia forming and raising the Himalayas, the arid and semi-arid Mediterranean flora was pushed up and adapted to the more alpine climate over the next 40\u201350\u00a0million years.[100][101] The Himalayan biodiversity hotspot was the site of mass exchange and intermingling of the Indian and Eurasian species in the neogene.[102] One mammal species (Himalayan field mouse), two each of bird and reptile species, nine amphibia, eight fish and 29 butterfly species are endemic to Nepal.[89][i]\n\n\nNepal contains 107 IUCN-designated threatened species, 88 of them animal species, 18 plant species and one species of \"fungi or protist\" group.[104] These include the endangered Bengal tiger, the red panda, the Asiatic elephant, the Himalayan musk deer, the wild water buffalo and the South Asian river dolphin,[105] as well as the critically endangered gharial, the Bengal florican,[88][106] and the white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle.[107] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Nepali wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1973 with the enactment of *National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1973*,[108] was substantially expanded. *Vulture restaurants*[89] coupled with a ban on veterinary usage of diclofenac has seen a rise in the number of white-rumped vultures.[109][107] The community forestry programme which has seen a third of the country's population directly participate in managing a quarter of the total forested area has helped the local economies while reducing human-wildlife conflict.[110][111] The breeding programmes[112] coupled with community-assisted military patrols,[113] and a crackdown on poaching and smuggling, has seen poaching of critically endangered tigers and elephants as well as vulnerable rhinos, among others, go down to effectively zero, and their numbers have steadily increased.[114] Nepal has ten national parks, three wildlife reserves, one hunting reserve, three Conservation Areas and eleven buffer zones, covering a total area of 28,959.67\u00a0km2 (11,181.39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), or 19.67% of the total land area,[115] while ten wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[116]\n\n\n\n## Politics and government[edit]\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Ram Chandra PoudelPresident | Pushpa Kamal DahalPrime Minister |\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Nepal\n\nNepal is a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system.[117] Nepal used to be referred as 'Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal' until Nepal Government decided to use just 'Nepal' as official name of the country.[118] It has seven national political parties recognised in the federal parliament: Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist\u2013Leninist), Nepali Congress, Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), Rastriya Swatantra Party, Rastriya Prajatantra Party, People's Socialist Party and Janamat Party.[119][117] Of the two major parties which both officially espouse democratic socialism, CPN(UML) is considered leftist while Nepali Congress is considered centrist.[120] During most of the brief periods of democratic exercise in the 1950s and the 1990s, Nepali Congress held majority of seats in parliament; CPN (UML) was its competitor in the 1990s.[121] After the Maoists entered the political process in 2006, they emerged as the third largest party.[68] In the aftermath of the 2017 elections, the first one according to the new constitution, NCP, formed by the merger of CPN (UML) and CPN (Maoist Centre) had become the ruling party at the federal level and in six out of seven provinces.[122] After the 2022 general election, the House of Representatives of 2nd Federal parliament was formed as hung parliament and a coalition government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal was formed in December 2022.[123]\n\n\n\n![Portrait of B. P. Koirala](image)B.P. Koirala led the 1951 revolution, became the first democratically elected Prime Minister, and after being deposed and imprisoned in 1961, spent the rest of his life fighting for democracy.\nIn the 1930s, a vibrant underground political movement arose in the capital, birthing Nepal Praja Parishad in 1936,[61] which was dissolved seven years later, following the execution of the four great martyrs. Around the same time, Nepalis involved in the Indian independence movement started organizing into political parties, leading to the birth of Nepali Congress and Communist Party of Nepal.[124] As communism was trying to find its footing, Nepali Congress was successful in overthrowing the Rana regime in 1951 and enjoyed the overwhelming support of the electorate.[125] In the partyless Panchayat system initiated in 1962 by King Mahendra, monarchy loyalists took turns leading the government; political leaders remained underground, exiled or in prison.[61] A communist insurgency was crushed in its cradle in the 1970s, which led to the eventual coalescence of hitherto scattered communist factions under the United Left Front.\n\n\nAfter the joint civil resistance launched by the United Left Front and Nepali Congress overthrew the Panchayat in 1990,[125][126] the Front became CPN (UML), adopted multi-party democracy, and in the brief period, it was in government, introduced welfare programmes that remain popular.[121] After the Maoist Party joined mainstream politics, in the aftermath of the peaceful revolution of 2006, it also adopted multi-party democracy as its official line. The transition period between 2006 and 2015 saw sustained protests from the newly formed ethnocentric nationalist movements, principal among them the Madhes Movement.\n\n\n\n### Government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Nepal and Constitution of Nepal\n\nNepal is governed according to the Constitution of Nepal. It defines Nepal as having multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious, multi-cultural characteristics with common aspirations of people living in diverse geographical regions, and being committed to and united by a bond of allegiance to the national independence, territorial integrity, national interest, and prosperity of Nepal.[3]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSingha Durbar, the seat of government in Kathmandu\n![](image)\nThe Supreme Court\n![](image)\nParliament House\n\nThe Government of Nepal has three branches:[3]\n\n\n\n* Executive: The form of governance is a multi-party, competitive, federal democratic republican parliamentary system based on plurality. The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister, who forms the Council of ministers that exercises the executive power.\n* Legislature: The Legislature of Nepal, called the Federal Parliament, consists of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly. The House of Representatives consists of 275 members elected through a mixed electoral system and has a term of five years. The National Assembly, consisting of 59 members elected by provincial electoral colleges, is a permanent house; a third of its members are elected every two years for a six-year term.[127]\n* Judiciary: Nepal has a unitary three-tier independent judiciary that comprises the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, headed by the Chief Justice, seven High Courts, one in each province, the highest court at the provincial level, and 77 district courts, one in each district. The municipal councils can convene local judicial bodies to resolve disputes and render non-binding verdicts in cases not involving actionable crime. The actions and proceedings of the local judicial bodies may be guided and countermanded by the district courts.[3]\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of Nepal\n\n![](image)\n**Sudurpashchim**\n\n**Karnali**\n\n**Lumbini**\n\n**Gandaki**\n\n**Bagmati**\n\n**Madhesh**\n\n**Koshi**\n\n\n\n\n| Province\n | Capital\n | Governor | Chief Minister | Districts | Area(km2)\n | PopulationCensus2011\n | PopulationCensus2021\n | Density(people/km2)2021\n | HumanDevelopmentIndex | Map\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Koshi Province | Biratnagar | Somnath Adhikari | Hikmat Kumar Karki | 14 | 25,905 | 4,534,943 | 4,972,021 | 192 | 0.553 | ![](image) |\n| Madhesh Province | Janakpur | Hari Shankar Mishra | Saroj Yadav | 8 | 9,661 | 5,404,145 | 6,126,288 | 634 | 0.485 | ![](image) |\n| Bagmati Province | Hetauda | Yadav Chandra Sharma | Salikram Jamkattel | 13 | 20,300 | 5,529,452 | 6,084,042 | 300 | 0.560 | ![](image) |\n| Gandaki Province | Pokhara | Prithvi Man Gurung | Khagaraj Adhikari | 11 | 21,856 | 2,403,757 | 2,479,745 | 113 | 0.567 | ![](image) |\n| Lumbini Province | Deukhuri | Amik Sherchan | Leela GIri | 12 | 19,707 | 4,499,272 | 5,124,225 | 260 | 0.519 | ![](image) |\n| Karnali Province | Birendranagar | Govinda Prasad Kalauni | Raj Kumar Sharma | 10 | 30,213 | 1,570,418 | 1,694,889 | 56 | 0.469 | ![](image) |\n| Sudurpashchim Province | Godawari | Ganga Prasad Yadav | Rajendra Singh Rawal | 9 | 19,539 | 2,552,517 | 2,711,270 | 139 | 0.478 | ![](image) |\n| Nepal\n | Kathmandu | PresidentRam Chandra Poudel | Prime MinisterPushpa Kamal Dahal | 77 | 147,181\n | 26,494,504\n | 29,192,480\n | 198\n | 0.579\n | ![](image) |\n\n\nNepal is a federal republic comprising 7 provinces. Each province is composed of 8 to 14 districts. The districts, in turn, comprise local units known as urban and rural municipalities.[3] There is a total of 753 local units which includes 6 metropolitan municipalities, 11 sub-metropolitan municipalities and 276 municipalities for a total of 293 urban municipalities, and 460 rural municipalities.[128] Each local unit is composed of wards. There are 6,743 wards in total.\n\n\nThe local governments enjoy executive and legislative as well as limited judicial powers in their local jurisdiction. The provinces have unicameral parliamentary Westminster system of governance. The local and provincial governments exercise some absolute powers and some powers shared with provincial or federal government. The district coordination committee, a committee composed of all elected officials from the local governments in the district, has a very limited role.[3][128]\n\n\n\n### Laws and law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law enforcement in Nepal\n\n![](image)Nepal has made progress with regard to minority rights in recent years.\nThe Constitution of Nepal is the supreme law of the land, and any other laws contradicting it are automatically invalid to the extent of the contradiction.[129] The specific legal provisions are codified as Civil Code and Criminal Code, accompanied by Civil Procedure Code and Criminal Procedure Code respectively.[130] The Supreme Court is the highest authority in the interpretation of laws and it can direct the parliament to amend or enact new laws as required. Nepali laws are considered generally more progressive compared to other developing countries, and in some instances, many developed ones. The death penalty has been abolished.[131] Nepal also has made progress in LGBT rights and gender equality. It recognises marital rape and supports abortion rights. Owing to a rise in sex-selective abortion, however, constraints have been introduced. Nepal is a signatory to the Geneva Convention, Conventions/Treaties on the prohibition of Biological, Chemical and Nuclear weapons,[132] International Labour Organization Fundamental Conventions, Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Paris climate accord. Some legal provisions, guided by socio-economic, cultural and religious sensibilities, remain discriminatory. There is gender-based discrimination against foreign nationals married to Nepali citizens.[j] Paternal lineage of a person is valued and required in legal documents. Many laws remain unenforced in practice.\n\n\n\n![](image)Traffic Police personnel manually direct traffic at the busiest roads and junctions.\nNepal Police is the primary law enforcement agency. It is an independent organisation under the command of the Inspector General, who is appointed by and reports to the Ministry of Home Affairs. In addition to maintaining law and order, it is responsible for the management of road traffic, which is undertaken by Nepal Traffic Police. Nepal Armed Police Force, a separate paramilitary police organisation, works in cooperation with Nepal police in routine security matters; it is intended for crowd control, counter-insurgency and anti-terrorism actions, and other internal matters where the use of force may be necessary. The Crime Investigation Department of Nepal Police specialises in criminal investigation and forensic analysis.[134][135][136][137][138] The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority is an independent investigative agency that investigates and prosecutes cases related to corruption, bribery and abuses of authority. At 2.16 per 100,000 in 2016, Nepal's intentional homicide rate is much lower than average; police data indicates a steady increase in the crime rate in recent years.[139] Nepal was ranked 76 out of 163 countries in the Global Peace Index (GPI) in 2019.[140]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Nepal\n\n![](image)Gurkha Memorial, London\nNepal depends on diplomacy for national defence. It maintains a policy of neutrality between its neighbours, has amicable relations with other countries in the region, and has a policy of non-alignment at the global stage. Nepal is a member of SAARC, UN, WTO, BIMSTEC and ACD, among others. It has bilateral diplomatic relations with 167 countries and the EU,[141] has embassies in 30 countries[142] and six consulates,[143] while 25 countries maintain embassies in Nepal, and more than 80 others maintain non-residential diplomatic missions.[144] Nepal is one of the major contributors to the UN peacekeeping missions, having contributed more than 119,000 personnel to 42 missions since 1958.[145] Nepali people have a reputation for honesty, loyalty and bravery, which has led to them serving as legendary Gurkha warriors in the Indian and British armies for the last 200 years, with service in both world wars, India-Pakistan wars as well as Afghanistan and Iraq,[146] though Nepal was not directly involved in any of those conflicts, and winning the highest military awards, including the Victoria Cross and the Param Vir Chakra.[147]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nepal is one of the major contributors to UN peacekeeping missions.\nNepal pursues a policy of \"balanced relations\" with the two giant immediate neighbours, India and China;[148][149] the 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship with India provides for a much closer relationship.[150] Nepal and India share an open border with free movement of people, religious, cultural and marital ties. India is Nepal's largest trading partner, which it depends upon for all of its oil and gas, and a number of essential goods. Nepalis can own property in India, while Indians are free to live and work in Nepal.[151] Relations between India and Nepal, though very close, have faced difficulties stemming from territorial disputes,[152] economics, and the problems inherent in big power-small power relations.[153][*failed verification*] Nepal established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China on 1 August 1955, and signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1960; relations since have been based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Nepal maintains neutrality in conflicts between China and India. It remains firmly committed to the One China Policy and is known to curb anti-China activities from the Tibetan refugees in Nepal.[154][155] Citizens of both countries can cross the border and travel as far as 30\u00a0km without a visa.[156] China is viewed favourably in Nepal owing to the absence of any border disputes or serious interference in internal politics, coupled with its assistance in infrastructure development and aid during emergencies; favourability has increased since China helped Nepal during the 2015 economic blockade imposed by India.[157] Subsequently, China granted Nepal access to its ports for third-country trade, and Nepal joined China's Belt and Road Initiative.[158]\n\n\nNepal emphasises greater cooperation in South Asia and actively pushed for the establishment of SAARC, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, the permanent secretariat of which, is hosted in Kathmandu.[159] Nepal was one of the first countries to recognise an independent Bangladesh, and the two countries seek to enhance greater cooperation, on trade and water management; seaports in Bangladesh, being closer, are seen as viable alternatives to India's monopoly on Nepal's third-country trade.[160] Nepal was the first South Asian country to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, and the countries enjoy a strong relationship;[161] it recognises the rights of the Palestinians, having voted in favour of its recognition at the UN and against the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.[162] Countries that Nepal maintains a close relationship with, include the most generous donors and development partners\u2014the United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Japan and Norway, among others.[163]\n\n\n\n### Military and intelligence[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nepali Army\n\n![](image)The multipurpose Kukri knife (top) is the signature weapon of the Nepali armed forces, and is used by the Gurkhas, Nepal Army, Police and even security guards.\nThe President is the supreme commander of the Nepali Army; its routine management is handled by the Ministry of Defence. The military expenditure for 2018 was $398.5\u00a0million,[164] around 1.4% of GDP.[165] An almost exclusively ground infantry force, Nepal Army numbers at less than one hundred thousand;[166][167][168] recruitment is voluntary.[169] It has few aircraft, mainly helicopters, primarily used for transport, patrol, and search and rescue.[170] Directorate of Military Intelligence under Nepal Army serves as the military intelligence agency;[171] National Investigation Department tasked with national and international intelligence gathering, is independent.[166] Nepal Army is primarily used for routine security of critical assets, an anti-poaching patrol of national parks, counterinsurgency, and search and rescue during natural disasters;[172] it also undertakes major construction projects.[173] There are no discriminatory policies on recruitment into the army, but it is dominated by men from elite Pahari warrior castes.[174][175]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Nepal\n\n![](image)A proportional representation of Nepal exports, 2019\nNepal is a developing country, which ranks 165th in the world[k] in nominal GDP per capita[176] and 162nd[l] in GDP per capita at PPP.[177] Nepal's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2019 was $34.186\u00a0billion.[178][179] With an annual growth rate calculated at 6.6% in 2019,[180] and expected 2.89% in 2021,[181] Nepal is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.[*citation needed*] Nepal has been a member of WTO since 23 April 2004.[182]\n\n\nThe 16.8-million-worker Nepali labour force is the 37th largest in the world.[183] The primary sector makes up 27.59% of GDP, the secondary sector 14.6%, and the tertiary sector 57.81%.[184] Nepal's foreign exchange remittances of US$8.1\u00a0billion in 2018, the 19th largest in the world and constituting 28.0% of GDP,[185] were contributed to its economy by millions of workers primarily in India, the Middle East and East Asia, almost all of them unskilled labourers.[186][187] Major agricultural products include cereals (barley, maize, millet, paddy and wheat), oilseed, potato, pulses, sugarcane, jute, tobacco, milk and water buffalo meat.[188][189] Major industries include tourism, carpets, textiles, cigarettes, cement, brick, as well as small rice, jute, sugar and oilseed mills.[188] Nepal's international trade greatly expanded in 1951 with the establishment of democracy; liberalisation began in 1985 and picked up pace after 1990. By the fiscal year 2016/17, Nepal's foreign trade amounted Rs 1.06\u00a0trillion, a twenty-three folds increase from Rs 45.6\u00a0billion in 1990/91. More than 60% of Nepal's trade is with India. Major exports include readymade garment, carpet, pulses, handicrafts, leather, medicinal herbs, and paper products, which account for 90% of the total. Major imports include various finished and semi-finished goods, raw materials, machinery and equipment, chemical fertilisers, electrical and electronic devices, petroleum products, gold, and readymade garments.[190] Inflation was at 4.5% in 2019.[191] Foreign exchange reserves were at US$9.5\u00a0billion in July 2019, equivalent to 7.8 months of imports.[191]\n\n\n\n![](image)Real GDP per capita development of Nepal\nNepal has made significant progress in poverty reduction bringing the population below the international poverty line (US$1.90 per person per day) from 15% in 2010 to just 9.3% in 2018, although vulnerability remains extremely high, with almost 32% of the population living on between US$1.90 and US$3.20 per person per day.[191] Nepal has made improvement in sectors like nutrition, child mortality, electricity, improved flooring and assets. Under the current trend, Nepal is expected to eradicate poverty within 20 years.[192][193] The agriculture sector is particularly vulnerable as it is highly dependent on the monsoon rains, with just 28% of the arable land being irrigated, As of 2014[update].[194] Agriculture employs 76% of the workforce, services 18%, and manufacturing and craft-based industry 6%.[195] Private investment, consumption, tourism and agriculture are the principal contributors to economic growth.[191]\n\n\nThe government's budget is about $13.71\u00a0billion (FY 2019/20);[196] expenditure of infrastructure development budget, most of it contributed by foreign aid, usually fails to meet the target.[197] The country receives foreign aid from the UK,[198][199] India, Japan, the US, the EU, China, Switzerland, and Scandinavian countries. The Nepali rupee has been tied to the Indian rupee at an exchange rate of 1.6 for many years. Per capita income is $1,004.[200] The distribution of wealth among the Nepalis is consistent with that in many developed and developing countries: the highest 10% of households control 39.1% of the national wealth and the lowest 10% control only 2.6%. European Union (EU) (46.13%), the US (17.4%), and Germany (7.1%) are its main export partners; they mainly buy Nepali ready-made garments (RMG).[201] Nepal's import partners include India (47.5%), the United Arab Emirates (11.2%), China (10.7%), Saudi Arabia (4.9%), and Singapore (4%).\n\n\nBesides having landlocked, rugged geography, few tangible natural resources and poor infrastructure, the ineffective post-1950 government and the long-running civil war are also factors in stunting the country's economic growth and development.[202][203][204] Debt bondage even involving debtors' children has been a persistent social problem in the western hills and the Terai, with an estimated 234,600 people or 0.82% of the population considered as enslaved, by The Global Slavery Index in 2016.[205]\n\n\nIn 2022, Nepal limited import of non-essential goods after its foreign currency reserves dropped. COVID-19 pandemic caused a decline in tourism spending and the money sent home by Nepalis working abroad, which in turn lowered country's foreign currency reserve.[206]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tourists view a greater one-horned rhinoceros from an elephant in Chitwan National Park.\nMain article: Tourism in Nepal\n\nTourism is one of the largest and fastest-growing industries in Nepal, employing more than a million people and contributing 7.9% of the total GDP.[207] The number of international visitors crossed one million in 2018 for the first time (not counting Indian tourists arriving by land).[207][208] Nepal's share of visitors to South Asia is about 6%, and they spend much less on average, with Nepal sharing 1.7% of the earnings.[209] Premier destinations include Pokhara, the Annapurna trekking circuit and the four UNESCO world heritage sites\u2014Lumbini, Sagarmatha National Park (home to Mount Everest), seven sites in the Kathmandu Valley collectively listed as one, and Chitwan National Park. Most of Nepal's mountaineering earning comes from Mount Everest, which is more accessible from the Nepalese side.\n\n\nNepal, officially opened to westerners in 1951, became a popular destination at the end of the hippie trail, during the 1960s and 1970s. The industry, disrupted by the civil war in the 1990s, has since recovered but faces challenges to growth, owing to a lack of proper facilities for high-end tourism termed the \"infrastructure bottleneck\", the flag carrier in shambles, and a handful of destinations properly developed and marketed. The home-stay tourism, in which cultural and eco-tourists stay as paying guests in the homes of indigenous people, has seen some success.[210]\n\n\n\n### Foreign employment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)While adults are employed in slavery-like conditions abroad, hundreds of thousands of children in the country are employed as child labour (not including the agricultural sector).\nThe rate of unemployment and underemployment exceeds half of the working-age population,[211] driving millions to seek employment abroad, mainly in India, the Gulf, and East Asia. Mostly unskilled, uneducated, and indebted to loan sharks, these workers are swindled by the manpower companies and sent to exploitative employers or war-ridden countries under fraudulent contracts.[212][213] They have their passports seized, to be returned when the employer grants them leave or terminates their contracts. Most do not get paid minimum wage,[214] and many are forced to forfeit all or part of the wages.[215] Many Nepalis work in extremely unsafe conditions; an average of two workers die each day.[216] Due to restrictions placed on women, many depend on traffickers to get out of the country, and end up victims of violence and abuse.[217] Many Nepalese are believed to be working under slavery-like conditions, and Nepal spends billions of rupees rescuing stranded workers, on remuneration to the indebted families of the dead, and in legal costs for those arrested in foreign countries.[218][219] Though millions have raised themselves out of poverty, due to a lack of entrepreneurial skills, the remittance is largely spent on real estate and consumption.[220][219]\n\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Middle Marsyangdi Hydroelectric Dam. Nepal has significant potential to generate hydropower, which it plans to export across South Asia.\nThe bulk of energy in Nepal comes from biomass (80%) and imported fossil fuels (16%).[221] Most of the final energy consumption goes to the residential sector (84%) followed by transport (7%) and industry (6%); the transport and industry sectors have been expanding rapidly in recent years.[221] Except for some lignite deposits, Nepal has no known oil, gas or coal deposits.[221] All commercial fossil fuels (mainly oil, LPG and coal) are imported, spending 129% of the country's total export revenue.[222] Only about 1% of the energy need is fulfilled by electricity.[221] The perennial nature of Nepali rivers and the steep gradient of the country's topography provide ideal conditions for the development of hydroelectric projects. Estimates put Nepal's economically feasible hydro-power potential at approximately 42,000 MW.[221] Nepal has been able to exploit only about 1,100 MW. As most of it is generated from run-of-river (ROR) plants, the actual power produced is much lower in the dry winter months when peak demand can reach as high as 1,200 MW, and Nepal needs to import as much as 650 MW from India to meet the demands.[223] Major hydro-power projects suffer delays and setbacks.[224][225][226] Nepal's electrification rate (76%) is comparable to that of other countries in the region but there is significant disparity between the rural (72%) and urban (97%) areas.[221] The position of the power sector remains unsatisfactory because of high tariffs, high system losses, high generation costs, high overheads, over staffing, and lower domestic demand.[227]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nNepal remains isolated from the world's major land, air and sea transport routes, although, within the country, aviation is in a better state, with 47 airports, 11 of them with paved runways;[228] flights are frequent and support a sizeable traffic. The hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two-thirds of the country has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. As of 2016[update], there were just over 11,890\u00a0km (7,388\u00a0mi) of paved roads, 16,100\u00a0km (10,004\u00a0mi) of unpaved roads, and just 59\u00a0km (37\u00a0mi) of railway line in the south.[228] As of 2018[update], all district headquarters (except Simikot) had been connected to the road network.[173] Most of the rural roads are not operable during the rainy season; even national highways regularly become inoperable.[229] Nepal depends almost entirely on assistance from countries like China, India and Japan, for building, maintenance and expansion of the road network. The only practical seaport of entry for goods bound for Kathmandu is Kolkata in India. The national carrier, Nepal Airlines, is in poor shape due to mismanagement and corruption, and has been blacklisted by the EU.[230] Internally, the poor state of development of the road system makes access to markets, schools, and health clinics a challenge.[202]\n\n\n\n### Communication[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Nepal Telecommunication Authority MIS August 2019 report, voice telephony subscription rate was at 2.70% of total population for fixed phones and 138.59% for mobile; 98% of all voice telephony was through mobile phones.[231] Similarly, while an estimated 14.52% had access to fixed broadband, an additional 52.71% were accessing the internet using their mobile data subscriptions; almost 15\u00a0million of them with 3G or better.[231] The mobile voice telephony and broadband market was dominated by two telecommunications companies, the state-owned Nepal Telecom (55%) and the private multinational, Ncell (40%).[231] Of the 21% market share enjoyed by fixed broadband, around 25% was again shared by Nepal Telecom, with the rest going to the private Internet Service Providers.[231] Although there is high disparity in penetration rate between the rural and urban areas, mobile service has reached 75 districts of the country covering 90% of land area, and broadband access is expected to reach 90% of the population by 2020.[228]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mass media in Nepal\n\nAs of 2019[update], the state operates three television stations as well as national and regional radio stations. There are 117 private TV channels and 736 FM radio stations licensed for operation, at least 314 of them, community radio stations.[228] According to the 2011 census, the percentage of households possessing radio was 50.82%, television 36.45%, cable TV 19.33%, and computer 7.28%.[232] According to the Press Council Nepal classification, as of 2017[update] of the 833 publications producing original content, ten national dailies and weeklies are rated A+ class.[233] In 2019, Reporters Without Borders ranked Nepal at 106th in the world in terms of press freedom.[234]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Nepal\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1911\n | 5,638,749 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| 1920 \n | 5,573,788 | \u22120.13% |\n| 1930 \n | 5,532,574 | \u22120.07% |\n| 1941\n | 6,283,649 | +1.16% |\n| 1952/54\n | 8,256,625 | +2.51% |\n| 1961\n | 9,412,996 | +1.47% |\n| 1971\n | 11,555,983 | +2.07% |\n| 1981 \n | 15,022,839 | +2.66% |\n| 1991 \n | 18,491,097 | +2.10% |\n| 2001\n | 23,151,423 | +2.27% |\n| 2011\n | 26,494,504 | +1.36% |\n| 2021\n | 29,192,480 | +0.97% |\n| Source:Census in Nepal |\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\nThe citizens of Nepal are known as Nepali or Nepalese. The Nepali are descendants of three major migrations from India, Tibet and North Burma, and the Chinese province of Yunnan via Assam. Among the earliest inhabitants were the Kirat of the eastern region, Newars of the Kathmandu Valley, aboriginal Tharus of the Terai plains and the Khas Pahari people of the far-western hills. Despite the migration of a significant section of the population to the Terai in recent years, the majority of Nepalese still live in the central highlands, and the northern mountains are sparsely populated.\n\n\nNepal is a multicultural and multiethnic country, home to 125 distinct ethnic groups, speaking 123 different mother tongues and following a number of indigenous and folk religions in addition to Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Christianity.[5] According to the 2011 census, Nepal's population was 26.5\u00a0million, almost a threefold increase from nine million in 1950. From 2001 to 2011, the average family size declined from 5.44 to 4.9. The census also noted some 1.9\u00a0million absentee people, over a million more than in 2001; most are male labourers employed overseas. This correlated with the drop in sex ratio to 94.2 from 99.8 for 2001.[235] The annual population growth rate was 1.35% between 2001 and 2011, compared to an average of 2.25% between 1961 and 2001; also attributed to the absentee population.[236]\n\n\nNepal is one of the ten least urbanised, and the ten fastest urbanizing countries in the world. As of 2014[update], an estimated 18.3% of the population lived in urban areas. Urbanisation rate is high in the Terai, doon valleys of the inner Terai and valleys of the middle hills, but low in the high Himalayas. Similarly, the rate is higher in central and eastern Nepal compared to further west.[237] The capital, Kathmandu, nicknamed the \"City of temples\", is the largest city in the country and the cultural and economic heart. Other large cities in Nepal include Pokhara, Biratnagar, Lalitpur, Bharatpur, Birgunj, Dharan, Hetauda and Nepalgunj. Congestion, pollution and drinking water shortage are some of the major problems facing the rapidly growing cities, most prominently the Kathmandu Valley.\n\n\n\n### Largest cities[edit]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or towns in NepalCentral Bureau of Statistics 2021 Nepal census[238]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank\n | Name | Province | Municipal pop.\n | Rank\n | Name | Province | Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Kathmandu](image)Kathmandu![Pokhara](image)Pokhara | 1 | Kathmandu | Bagmati | 845,767 | 11 | Janakpur | Madhesh | 195,438\n | ![Bharatpur](image)Bharatpur![Lalitpur](image)Lalitpur |\n| 2 | Pokhara | Gandaki | 518,452 | 12 | Butwal | Lumbini | 195,054\n |\n| 3 | Bharatpur | Bagmati | 369,377 | 13 | Tulsipur | Lumbini | 180,734\n |\n| 4 | Lalitpur | Bagmati | 299,843 | 14 | Budhanilkantha | Bagmati | 179,688\n |\n| 5 | Birgunj | Madhesh | 268,273 | 15 | Dharan | Koshi | 173,096\n |\n| 6 | Biratnagar | Koshi | 244,750 | 16 | Nepalgunj | Lumbini | 166,258\n |\n| 7 | Dhangadhi | Sudurpashchim | 204,788 | 17 | Birendranagar | Karnali | 154,886\n |\n| 8 | Ghorahi | Lumbini | 201,079 | 18 | Tarakeshwar | Bagmati | 151,508\n |\n| 9 | Itahari | Koshi | 198,098 | 19 | Gokarneshwar | Bagmati | 151,200\n |\n| 10 | Hetauda | Bagmati | 195,951 | 20 | Tilottama | Lumbini | 149,657\n |\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Nepal\n\nNepal's diverse linguistic heritage stems from three major language groups: Indo-Aryan, Sino-Tibetan and various indigenous language isolates. The major languages of Nepal (percent spoken as native language) according to the 2011 census are Nepali (44.6%), Maithili (11.7%), Bhojpuri (6.0%), Tharu (5.8%), Tamang (5.1%), Nepal Bhasa (3.2%), Bajjika (3%) and Magar (3.0%), Doteli (3.0%), Urdu (2.6%), Awadhi (1.89%), and Sunwar. Nepal is home to at least four indigenous sign languages.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDescendent of Sanskrit, Nepali is written in Devanagari script. It is the official language and serves as *lingua franca* among Nepali of different ethnolinguistic groups. The regional languages Maithili, Awadhi and Bhojpuri are spoken in the southern Terai region; Urdu is common among Nepali Muslims. Varieties of Tibetan are spoken in and north of the higher Himalaya where standard literary Tibetan is widely understood by those with religious education. Local dialects in the Terai and hills are mostly unwritten with efforts underway to develop systems for writing many in Devanagari or the Roman alphabet.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Nepal\n\n![](image)Sadhus in Pashupatinath Temple\nNepal is a secular country, as declared by the Constitution of Nepal 2012 (Part 1, Article 4), where secularism 'means religious, cultural freedom, along with the protection of religion, culture handed down from time immemorial (\u0938\u0928\u093e\u0924\u0928)'.[239][240] The 2011 census reported that the religion with the largest number of followers in Nepal was Hinduism (81.3% of the population), followed by Buddhism (9%); the remaining were Islam (4.4%), Kirant (3.1%), Christianity (1.4%) and *Prakriti* or nature worship (0.5%).[241] By percentage of population, Nepal has the largest population of Hindus in the world.[242] Nepal was officially a Hindu Kingdom until recently, and Shiva was considered the guardian deity of the country.[243] Although many government policies throughout history have disregarded or marginalised minority religions, Nepalese societies generally enjoy religious tolerance and harmony among all religions, with only isolated incidents of religiously motivated violence.[244][245] Nepal's constitution does not give anyone the right to convert any person to another religion. Nepal also passed a more stringent anti-conversion law on 2017.[246] Nepal has the second-largest number of Hindus in the world after India.[247]\n\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Nepal\n\nNepal entered modernity in 1951 with a literacy rate of 5% and about 10,000 students enrolled in 300 schools.[*citation needed*] By 2017, there were more than seven million students enrolled in 35,601 schools.[248] The overall literacy rate (for population age 5 years and above) increased from 54.1% in 2001 to 65.9% in 2011.[5] The net primary enrolment rate reached 97% by 2017,[249][250] yet enrolment was less than 60% at the secondary level (grades 9 \u201312),[251] and around 12% at the tertiary level.[251] Though there is significant gender disparity in overall literacy rate,[5] girls have overtaken boys in enrolment to all levels of education.[251] Nepal has eleven universities and four independent science academies.[248] Nepal was ranked 108th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[252][253]\n\n\nLack of proper infrastructures and teaching materials, and a high student-to-teacher ratio, as well as politicisation of school management committees[254] and partisan unionisation among both students and teachers,[255] present a hurdle to progress. Free basic education is guaranteed in the constitution but the programme lacks funding for effective implementation.[256] Government has scholarship programmes for girls and disabled students as well as the children of martyrs, marginalised communities and the poor.[257][258] Tens of thousands of Nepali students leave the country every year in search of better education and work, with half of them never returning.[259][260]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in Nepal\n\n![](image)Historical development of life expectancy in Nepal\nHealth care services in Nepal are provided by both the public and private sectors. Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 71 years as of 2017, 153rd highest in the world,[261] up from 54 years in the 1990s and 35 years in 1950.[262][263] Two-thirds of all deaths are due to non-communicable diseases; heart disease is the leading cause of death.[264] While sedentary lifestyle, imbalanced diet and consumption of tobacco and alcohol has contributed in the rise of non-communicable diseases, many lose their life to communicable and treatable diseases caused by poor sanitation and malnutrition due to a lack of education, awareness and access to healthcare services.[264][265]\n\n\nNepal has made great progress in maternal and child health. 95% of children have access to iodised salt, and 86% of children aged 6 \u2013 59 months receive Vitamin A prophylaxis.[266] Stunting, underweight and wasting has been reduced significantly;[266] malnutrition, at 43% among children under five, is extremely high.[267] Anemia in women and children increased between 2011 and 2016, reaching 41% and 53% respectively.[267] Low birth weight is at 27% while breastfeeding is at 65%.[267] Nepal has reduced maternal mortality rate to 229,[268] from 901 in 1990;[269][268] infant mortality is down to 32.2 per thousand live births compared to 139.8 in 1990.[270] Contraceptive prevalence rate is 53% but the disparity rate between rural and urban areas is high due to a lack of awareness and easy access.[271]\n\n\nProgress in health is driven by strong government initiative in cooperation with NGOs and INGOs. Public health centres provide 72 essential medicines free of cost. In addition, the public health insurance plan initiated in 2016 which covers health treatments of up to Rs 50,000 for five members of a family, for a premium of Rs 2500 per year, has seen limited success, and is expected to expand.[272] By paying stipends for four antenatal visits to health centres and hospitalised delivery, Nepal decreased home-births from 81% in 2006[269] to 41% in 2016.[273] School meal programmes have improved education as well as nutrition metrics among children.[274] Toilet building subsidies under the ambitious \"one household-one toilet\" programme has seen toilet prevalence rate reach 99% in 2019, from just 6% in 1990.[275]\n\n\n\n### Immigrants and refugees[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Nepal \u00a7\u00a0Foreign population in Nepal\n\nNepal has a long tradition of accepting immigrants and refugees.[276] In modern times, Tibetans and Bhutanese have constituted a majority of refugees in Nepal. Tibetan refugees began arriving in 1959,[277] and many more cross into Nepal every year.[278] The Bhutanese Lhotsampa refugees began arriving in the 1980s and numbered more than 110,000 by the 2000s. Most of them have been resettled in third countries.[279] In late 2018, Nepal had a total of 20,800 confirmed refugees, 64% of them Tibetan and 31% Bhutanese.[280] Economic immigrants, and refugees fleeing persecution or war, from neighbouring countries, Africa and the Middle East, termed \"urban refugees\" because they live in apartments in the cities instead of refugee camps,[281][282][283] lack official recognition; the government facilitates their resettlement in third countries.[284]\n\n\nAround 2,000 immigrants, half of them Chinese, applied for a work permit in 2018/19. The government lacks data on Indian immigrants as they do not require permits to live and work in Nepal;[285] Government of India puts the number of Non-Resident Indians in the country at 600,000.[286]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Nepal\n\n![](image)A Magar couple in their ethnic dress\n### Society[edit]\n\n\nTraditional Nepali society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Nepali caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in South Asia. Social classes are defined by more than a hundred endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as *j\u0101tis*, or \"castes\". Nepal declared untouchability to be illegal in 1963[287] and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives. At the workplace and educational institutions in urban Nepal, caste-related identification has pretty much lost its importance.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFamily values are important in the Nepali tradition, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have been the norm in Nepal, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas. An overwhelming majority of Nepalis, with or without their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders. Marriage is thought to be for life, and the divorce rate is extremely low, with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.[288] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18.[289]\n\n\nMany Nepali festivals are religious in origin. The best known include: Dashain, Tihar, Teej, Chhath, Maghi, Sakela, Holi, Eid ul-Fitr, Christmas, and the Nepali new year.\n\n\n\n### Symbols[edit]\n\n\nMain article: National symbols of Nepal\n\n\n\nNational symbols| ![](image)Flag of Nepal\n |\n| Emblem | Emblem of Nepal |\n| Anthem | Sayaun Thunga Phulka |\n| Language | All mother-tongues of Nepal |\n| Currency | Nepalese rupee (\u0930\u0942) (NPR) |\n| Bird | Himalayan monal |\n| Flower | Rhododendron arboreum[291] |\n| Mammal | Cow[290] |\n| Colour | \u00a0 Crimson |\n| Sport | Volleyball[292] |\n\n\nThe emblem of Nepal depicts the snowy Himalayas, the forested hills, and the fertile Terai, supported by a wreath of rhododendrons, with the national flag at the crest and in the foreground, a plain white map of Nepal below it, and a man's and woman's right hands joined to signify gender equality. At the bottom is the national motto, a Sanskrit quote of patriotism attributed in Nepali folklore to Lord Rama, written in Devanagari script\u2014\"*Mother and motherland are greater than heaven*\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNepal's flag is the only national flag in the world that is not rectangular in shape.[293] The constitution contains instructions for a Geometric Construction of the double-pennant flag.[294] According to its official description, the crimson in the flag stands for victory in war or courage, and is also the colour of the rhododendron. The flag's blue border signifies Nepali people's desire for peace. The moon on the flag is a symbol of the peaceful and calm nature of Nepalis, while the sun represents the aggressiveness of Nepali warriors.\n\n\nThe president is the symbol of national unity. The martyrs are the symbols of patriotism. Commanders of the Anglo-Nepalese war, Amar Singh Thapa, Bhakti Thapa, and Balbhadra Kunwar are considered war heroes. A special designation of \"National hero\" has been conferred to 16 people from Nepal's history for their exceptional contributions to the prestige of Nepal. Prithvi Narayan Shah, the founder of modern Nepal, is held in high regard and considered \"Father of the Nation\" by many.[295][296]\n\n\n\n### Art and architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of Nepal\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nClockwise from top-left: (a) Nyatapola, a five storied pagoda in Bhaktapur, bejewelled with characteristic stone, metal and wood craftsmanship, has survived at least four major earthquakes.[297] Pagodas, now an indispensable part of East Asian architecture, are conjectured to have been transmitted to China from Nepal. (b) Nepali stonecraft in a royal water spout (c) A traditional Newar \"Ankhijhyal\" window in the form of a peacock\n\nThe oldest known examples of architecture in Nepal are stupas of early Buddhist constructions in and around Kapilvastu in south-western Nepal, and those constructed by Ashoka in the Kathmandu Valley c.\u2009250 BC. The characteristic architecture associated exclusively with Nepal was developed and refined by Newa artisans of the Kathmandu Valley starting no later than the Lichchhavi period. A Tang dynasty Chinese travel book, probably based on records from c.\u2009650 AD, describes contemporary Nepali architecture, predominantly built with wood, as rich in artistry, as well as wood and metal sculpture. It describes a magnificent seven-storied pagoda in the middle of a palace, with copper-tiled roofs, its balustrade, grills, columns and beams set about with fine and precious stones, and four golden sculptures of Makaras in the four corners of the base spouting water from their mouths like a fountain, supplied by copper pipes connected to the runnels at the top of the tower. Later Chinese chronicles describe Nepal's king's palace as an immense structure with many roofs, suggesting that the Chinese were not yet familiar with the pagoda architecture, which has now become one of the chief characteristics of Chinese architecture.\n\n\nA typical pagoda temple is built with wood, every piece of it finely carved with geometrical patterns or images of gods, goddesses, mythical beings and beasts. The roofs usually tiled with clay, and sometimes gold plated, diminish in proportion successively until the topmost roof is reached which is itself ensigned by a golden finial. The base is usually composed of rectangular terraces of finely carved stone; the entrance is usually guarded by stone sculptures of conventional figures. Bronze and copper craftsmanship observable in the sculpture of deities and beasts, decorations of doors and windows and the finials of buildings, as well as items of every day use is found to be of equal splendour. The most well-developed of Nepali painting traditions is the thanka or paubha painting tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, practised in Nepal by the Buddhist monks and Newar artisans. Changu Narayan Temple, built c. 4th century AD has probably the finest of Nepali woodcraft; the Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur Durbar Squares are the culmination of Nepali art and architecture, showcasing Nepali wood, metal and stone craftsmanship refined over two millennia.[298]\n\n\nThe \"ankhijhyal\" window, that allow a one-way view of the outside world, is an example of unique Nepali woodcraft, found in building structures, domestic and public alike, ancient and modern. Many cultures paint the walls of their homes with regular patterns, figures of gods and beasts and religious symbols; others paint their walls plain, often with clay or chernozem contrasted with yellow soil or limestone. The roofs of religious as well as domestic structures project considerably, presumably to provide protection from the sun and the rain. The timber of domestic structures are finely carved as with their religious counterparts.[298]\n\n\n\n### Looting of the cultural heritage of Nepal[edit]\n\n\nCultural looting is a crisis in Nepal despite efforts to combat it.[299][300][301] Volunteers working for the Nepal Heritage Recovery Campaign have helped recover artifacts.[302] In 2022 Barakat Gallery\u2019s London branch relinquished 16th-century carved wooden Torana, a ceremonial gateway, and the 17th-century stone statue of a kneeling devotee, both taken from sacred sites near Kathmandu.[303] In 2023 Nepalese artifacts suspected of having been looted were found in the Art Institute of Chicago,[304] the Metropolitan Museum of Art,[305][306] the Dallas Museum of Art,[307] the Rubin Museum[308] and other museums, and turned up in auctions at Christie's,[309] Bonhams[310] and other auction houses.\n\n\n\n### Literature and the performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Nepalese literature, Music of Nepal, and Cinema of Nepal\n\n![](image)Bhanubhakta Acharya, Nepali writer who translated the ancient Hindu epic *Ramayana* in the Nepali language\nNepal's literature was closely intertwined with that of the rest of South Asia until its unification into a modern kingdom. Literary works, which were written in Sanskrit by Brahmin priests educated and sometimes also based in Varanasi, included religious texts and other fantasies involving kings, gods and demons.[311] The oldest extant Nepali language text is dated to the 13th century but except for the epigraphic material, Nepali language literature older than the 17th century haven't been found. Newar literature dates back almost 500 years.[296] The modern history of Nepali literature begins with Bhanubhakta Acharya (1814\u20131868), who for the first time composed major and influential works in Nepali, the language accessible to the masses, most prominently, the Bhanubhakta Ramayana, a translation of the ancient Hindu epic.[311] By the end of the nineteenth century, Motiram Bhatta had published print editions of the works of Acharya, and through his efforts, single-handedly popularised and propelled Nepali language literature into modernity.[296] By the mid-twentieth century, Nepali literature was no longer limited to the Hindu literary traditions. Influenced by western literary traditions, writers in this period started producing literary works addressing the contemporary social problems,[312] while many others continued to enrich Nepali poetic traditions with authentic Nepali poetry. Newar literature also emerged as a premier literary tradition. After the advent of democracy in 1951, Nepali literature flourished. Literary works in many other languages began to be produced. Nepali literature continued to modernise, and in recent years, has been strongly influenced by the post civil-war Nepali experience as well as global literary traditions.[313][314][315][296]\n\n\nMaruni, Lakhey, Sakela, Kauda and Tamang Selo are some examples of the traditional Nepali music and dance in the hilly regions of Nepal.\n\n\nNepali film industry is known as \"Kollywood\".[316]\n\n\nNepal Academy is the foremost institution for the promotion of arts and culture in Nepal, established in 1957.[296]\n\n\n\n### Clothing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Nepali man in Daura-Suruwal, coat and Dhaka topi, displays the bhoto during the Bhoto Jatra festival.\nThe most widely worn traditional dress in Nepal, for both women and men, from ancient times until the advent of modern times, was draped.[317] For women, it eventually took the form of a sari, a single long piece of cloth, famously six yards long, and of width spanning the lower body.[317] The sari is tied around the waist and knotted at one end, wrapped around the lower body, and then over the shoulder.[317] In its more modern form, it has been used to cover the head, and sometimes the face, as a veil,[317] particularly in the Terai. It has been combined with an underskirt, or the petticoat, and tucked in the waistband for more secure fastening. It is worn with a blouse, or cholo, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end, passing over the shoulder, now serving to obscure the upper body's contours, and to cover the midriff.[317] Cholo-sari has become the attire of choice for formal occasions, official environs and festive gatherings. In its more traditional form, as part of traditional dresses and as worn in daily life while performing household chores or labour, it takes the form of a *fariya* or *gunyu*, usually shorter than a sari in length as well as breadth, and all of it wrapped around the lower body.\n\n\nFor men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[318] It too is tied around the waist and wrapped.[318] Among the Aryans, it is also wrapped once around each leg before being brought up through the legs to be tucked in at the back. Dhoti or its variants, usually worn over a langauti, constitute the lower-body garment in the traditional clothing of Tharus, Gurungs and Magars as well as the Madhesi people, among others. Other forms of traditional apparel that involve no stitching or tailoring are patukas (a length of cloth wrapped tightly over the waist by both sexes as a waistband, a part of most traditional Nepali costumes, usually with a khukuri tucked into it when worn by men), scarves like *pachhyauras* and *majetros* and shawls like the newar *ga* and Tibetan khata, ghumtos (the wedding veils) and various kinds of turbans (scarves worn around the head as a part of a tradition, or to keep off the sun or the cold,[318] called a pheta, pagri or sirpau).\n\n\nUntil the beginning of the first millennium AD, the ordinary dress of people in South Asia was entirely unstitched.[319] The arrival of the Kushans from Central Asia, c.\u200948 AD, popularised cut and sewn garments in the style of Central Asia.[319] The simplest form of sewn clothing, Bhoto (a rudimentary vest), is a universal unisex clothing for children, and traditionally the only clothing children wear until they come of age and are given adult garb, sometimes in a ceremonial rite of passage, such as the gunyu-choli ceremony for Hindu girls. Men continue to wear bhoto through adulthood. Upper body garment for men is usually a vest such as the *bhoto*, or a shirt similar to the *kurta*, such as *daura*, a closed-necked double-breasted long shirt with five pleats and eight strings that serve to tie it around the body. *Suruwal*, simply translated as a pair of trousers, is an alternative to and, more recently, replacement for *dhoti*, *kachhad* (Magars) or *lungi* (Tharus); it is traditionally much wider above the knees but tapers below, to fit tightly at the ankles, and is tied to the waist with a drawstring. Modern cholos worn with sarees are usually half-sleeved and single-breasted, and do not cover the midriff. The traditional one called the chaubandi cholo, like the daura, is full-sleeved, double-breasted with pleats and strings, and extends down to the patuka, covering the midriff.\n\n\nDaura-Suruwal and Gunyu-Cholo were the national dresses for men and women respectively until 2011 when they were removed to eliminate favouritism.[320] Traditional dresses of many pahari ethnic groups are Daura-Suruwal or similar, with patuka, a dhaka topi and a coat for men, and Gunyu-cholo or similar, with patuka and sometimes a scarf for women. For many other groups, men's traditional dresses consist of a shirt or a vest, paired with a *dhoti*, *kachhad* or *lungi*. In the high Himalayas, the traditional dresses are largely influenced by Tibetan culture. Sherpa women wear the chuba with the pangi apron, while Sherpa men wear shirts with stiff high collar and long sleeves called tetung under the chuba. Tibetan Xamo Gyaise hats of the Sherpas, dhaka topi of pahari men and tamang round caps are among the more distinctive headwears.\n\n\nMarried Hindu women wear *tika*, *sindur*, *pote* and red bangles. Jewellery of gold and silver, and sometimes precious stones, are common. Gold jewellery includes *mangalsutras* and *tilaharis* worn with the *pote* by the Hindus, *samyafung* (a huge gold flower worn on the head) and Nessey (huge flattened gold earrings) worn by the Limbus, and *sirphuli*, *sirbandhi* and *chandra* worn by the Magars. Tharu women can wear as much as six kilograms of silver in jewellery, which includes *mangiya* worn on the head, *tikuli* the forehead, and *kanseri* and *tikahamala* around the neck.[321]\n\n\nIn the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in Nepal. Increasingly, in urban settings, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, transformed instead into one for formal occasions. The traditional kurta suruwal is rarely worn by younger women, who increasingly favour jeans. The *dhoti* has largely been reduced to the liturgical vestment of shamans and Hindu priests.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nepalese cuisine\n\n![](image)A dal-bhat thali with boiled rice, lentil soup, fried leafy greens, vegetable curry, yoghurt, papad and vegetable salad\nNepali cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines. Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially from each other, using locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruit.[322] The Columbian exchange had brought the potato, the tomato, maize, peanuts, cashew nuts, pineapples, guavas, and most notably, chilli peppers, to South Asia. Each became staples of use.[323] The cereals grown in Nepal, their choice, times, and regions of planting, correspond strongly to the timing of Nepal's monsoons,[324] and the variations in altitude. Rice and wheat are mostly cultivated in the terai plains and well-irrigated valleys, and maize, millet, barley and buckwheat in the lesser fertile and drier hills.[322][325]\n\n\nThe foundation of a typical Nepali meal is a cereal cooked in plain fashion, and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[326] The latter includes lentils, pulses and vegetables spiced commonly with ginger and garlic, but also more discerningly with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon, jimbu and others as informed by culinary conventions.[326] In an actual meal, this mental representation takes the form of a platter, or thali, with a central place for the cooked cereal, peripheral ones, often in small bowls, for the flavourful accompaniments, and the simultaneous, rather than piecemeal, ingestion of the two in each act of eating, whether by actual mixing\u2014for example of rice and lentils\u2014or in the folding of one\u2014such as bread\u2014around the other, such as cooked vegetables.[326] *Dal-bhat*, centred around steamed rice is the most common example.[327] as well as dairy and sometimes meat, is the most common and prominent example. The unleavened flat bread made from wheat flour called chapati occasionally replaces the steamed rice, particularly in the Terai, while Dhindo, prepared by boiling corn, millet or buckwheat flour in water, continuously stirring and adding flour until thick, almost solid consistency is reached, is the main substitute in the hills and mountains. Tsampa, flour made from roasted barley or naked barley, is the main staple in the high himalayas. Throughout Nepal, fermented, then sun-dried, leafy greens called *Gundruk*, are both a delicacy and a vital substitute for fresh vegetables in the winter.[325]\n\n\n\n![](image)Momo dumplings with chutney\nA notable feature of Nepali food is the existence of a number of distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[328] The appearance of *ahimsa*, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in South Asian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought to have been a notable factor in the prevalence of vegetarianism among a segment of Nepal's Hindu and Buddhist populations, as well as among Jains.[328] Among these groups, strong discomfort is felt at thoughts of eating meat.[329] Though per capita meat consumption is low in Nepal, the proportion of vegetarianism is not high as in India, due to the prevalence of Shaktism, of which animal sacrifice is a prominent feature.[330]\n\n\n\n![](image)Samayabaji (Newar cuisine)\nNepali cuisines possess their own distinctive qualities to distinguish these hybrid cuisines from both their northern and southern neighbours.[331][327] Nepali cuisines, with generally tomato-based, leaner curries, are lighter than their cream-based Indian counterparts, and Nepali momo dumplings are heavily spiced compared to their northern counterparts.[327] Newar cuisine, one of the richest and most influential in Nepal, is more elaborate and diverse than most, as Newar culture developed in the highly fertile and prosperous Kathmandu valley.[322] A typical Newar cuisine can comprise more than a dozen dishes of cereals, meat, vegetable curries, chutneys and pickles. Kwanti (sprouted beans soup), chhwela (ground beef), chatamari (rice flour crepe), bara (fried lentil cake), kachila (marinated raw minced beef), samaybaji (centred around flattened rice), *lakhaamari* and *yomuri* are among the more widely recognised.[327][332] Juju dhau, a sweet yoghurt originating in Bhaktapur, is also famous.[327] Thakali cuisine is another well-known food tradition which seamlessly melds the Tibetan and the Indian with variety in ingredients, especially the herbs and spices.[322] In the Terai, Bagiya is a rice flour dumpling with sweets inside, popular among the Tharu and Maithil people. Various communities in the Terai make *sidhara* (sun-dried small fish mixed with taro leaves) and biriya (lentil paste mixed with taro leaves) to stock for the monsoon floods.[322] *Selroti*, *kasaar*, *fini* and *chaku* are among the sweet delicacies. Rice pulau or sweet rice porridge called *kheer* are usually the main dish in feasts.[325] Tea and buttermilk (fermented milk leftover from churning butter from yoghurt) are common non-alcoholic drinks. Almost all janajati communities have their own traditional methods of brewing alcohol. Raksi (traditional distilled alcohol), jaand (rice beer), tongba (millet beer) and chyaang are the most well-known.\n\n\n\n### Sports and recreation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Nepal\n\n![](image)Nepali children playing a variant of knucklebones, with pebbles\nNepali indigenous sports, like dandi biyo and kabaddi which were considered the unofficial national sports until recently,[292] are still popular in rural areas.[333] Despite efforts, standardisation and development of dandi biyo has not been achieved,[334][335] while Kabaddi, as a professional sport, is still in its infancy in Nepal.[336] Bagh-Chal, an ancient board game that is thought to have originated in Nepal, can be played on chalk-drawn boards, with pebbles, and is still popular today.[337][338] Ludo, snakes and ladders and carrom are popular pastimes.[339] Chess is also played.[333] Volleyball was declared as the national sport of Nepal in 2017.[292] Popular children's games include versions of tag,[333] knucklebones,[333] hopscotch, Duck, duck, goose[333] and lagori, while marbles,[333] top, hoop rolling and gully cricket are also popular among boys. Rubber bands, or ranger bands cut from tubes in bike tyres, make a multi-purpose sporting equipment for Nepali children, which may be bunched or chained together, and used to play dodgeball, cat's cradle, jianzi[333] and a variety of skipping rope games.[333]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nepali cricket fans are renowned for their exceptionally enthusiastic support of their national team.[340][341]\nFootball and cricket are popular professional sports.[342] Nepal is competitive in football in the South Asia region but has never won the SAFF championships, the regional tournament.[343][344] It usually ranks in the bottom quarter in the FIFA World Rankings.[345] Nepal has had success in cricket and holds the elite ODI status,[346][347] consistently ranking in the Top 20 in the ICC ODI and T20I rankings.[348][349] Nepal has had some success in athletics and martial arts, having won many medals at the South Asian Games and some at the Asian games.[350] Nepal has never won an olympic medal.[351] Sports like basketball, volleyball, futsal, wrestling, competitive bodybuilding[351][352] and badminton are also gaining in popularity.[333] Women in football, cricket, athletics, martial arts, badminton and swimming have found some success.[353][351] Nepal also fields players and national teams in several tournaments for disabled individuals, most notably in men's[354] as well as women's blind cricket.[355]\n\n\nThe only international stadium in the country is the multi-purpose Dasarath Stadium where the men and women national football teams play their home matches.[356] Since the formation of the national team, Nepal has played its home matches of cricket at Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground.[357] Nepal police, Armed police force and Nepal army are the most prolific producers of national players, and aspiring players are known to join armed forces, for the better sporting opportunities they can provide.[358][359] Nepali sports is hindered by a lack of infrastructure,[360] funding,[354] corruption, nepotism and political interference.[350][361][362] Very few players are able to make a living as professional sportspeople.[356][363]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Nepal portal\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n\n\n* Outline of Nepal\n\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** English: /n\u026a\u02c8p\u0254\u02d0l/,[15] /-\u02c8p\u0251\u02d0l/ *nih-PAWL, -\u2060PAHL*; Nepali: \u0928\u0947\u092a\u093e\u0932 [nepal]\n2. **^** \u0928\u0947\u092a\u093e\u0932\u0940: \u0938\u0902\u0918\u0940\u092f \u0932\u094b\u0915\u0924\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0915 \u0917\u0923\u0924\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0915 \u0928\u0947\u092a\u093e\u0932\n3. **^** The entire territory controlled by the monarch seated in Kathmandu at any given time would also be referred to as *Nepal*.

Quote: \"Scholars estimate that the first successful expansion of the *Homo sapiens* range beyond Africa and across the Arabian Peninsula occurred from as early as 80,000 years ago to as late as 40,000 years ago, although there may have been prior unsuccessful emigrations. Some of their descendants extended the human range ever further in each generation, spreading into each habitable land they encountered. One human channel was along with the warm and productive coastal lands of the Persian Gulf and the northern Indian Ocean. Eventually, various bands entered India between 75,000 years ago and 35,000 years ago (page 23)\"\n30. **^** Petraglia, Michael D.; Allchin, Bridget (2007). \"Human evolution and culture change in the Indian subcontinent\".

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, making it the world's second-largest country by total area, with the world's longest coastline. Its border with the United States is the world's longest international land border. The country is characterized by a wide range of both meteorologic and geological regions. It is a sparsely inhabited country of 40\u00a0million people, the vast majority residing south of the 55th parallel in urban areas. Canada's capital is Ottawa and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.\n\n\nIndigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the *Statute of Westminster, 1931*, and culminating in the *Canada Act 1982*, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\n\nCanada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The country's head of government is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons and is \"called upon\" by the governor general, representing the monarch of Canada, the head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is very highly ranked in international measurements of government transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness, innovation, education and gender equality. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its history, economy, and culture.\n\n\nA developed country, Canada has a high nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs, with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions. Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has had a significant influence on its global image. Canada is part of multiple major international and intergovernmental institutions.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Name of Canada\n\nWhile a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of *Canada*, the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word *kanata*, meaning \"village\" or \"settlement\".[9] In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona.[10] Cartier later used the word *Canada* to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona);[10] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as *Canada*.[10]\n\n\nFrom the 16th to the early 18th century, \"Canada\" referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint Lawrence River.[11] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada. These two colonies were collectively named the Canadas until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.[12]\n\n\nUpon Confederation in 1867, *Canada* was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference and the word *dominion* was conferred as the country's title.[13] By the 1950s, the term *Dominion of Canada* was no longer used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a \"realm of the Commonwealth\".[14]\n\n\nThe *Canada Act 1982*, which brought the Constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control, referred only to *Canada*. Later that year, the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day.[15] The term *Dominion* was used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though after the Second World War the term *federal* had replaced *dominion*.[16]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Canada\n\nFurther information: Timeline of Canadian history and Historiography of Canada\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nIndigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis,[17] the last being of mixed descent who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and subsequently developed their own identity.[17]\n\n\nThe first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago.[18][19] The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.[20] The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks.[21][22] Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.[23]\n\n\n\n![Colour-coded map of North America showing the distribution of North American language families north of Mexico](image)Linguistic areas of North American Indigenous peoples at the time of European contact[24]\nThe Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000[25] and two million,[26] with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.[27] As a consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent and several First Nations, such as the Beothuk, disappeared.[28] The decline is attributed to several causes, including the transfer of European diseases, such as influenza, measles, and smallpox, to which they had no natural immunity,[25][29] conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.[30][31]\n\n\nAlthough not without conflict, European Canadians' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful.[32] First Nations and M\u00e9tis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureurs des bois and voyageurs in their explorations of the continent during the North American fur trade.[33] These early European interactions with First Nations would change from friendship and peace treaties to the dispossession of Indigenous lands through treaties.[34][35] From the late 18th century, European Canadians forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a western Canadian society.[36] These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration through state-funded boarding schools,[37] health-care segregation,[38] and displacement.[39] A period of redress began with the formation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.[40] This included recognition of past colonial injustices and settlement agreements and betterment of racial discrimination issues, such as addressing the plight of missing and murdered Indigenous women.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### European colonization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of territorial claims in North America by 1750. Possessions of British America (pink), New France (blue), and New Spain (orange); California, Pacific Northwest, and Great Basin not indicated.[42]\nIt is believed that the first European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif Erikson.[43][44] In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland.[45] No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when Italian seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of King Henry VII of England.[46] In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33\u00a0ft) cross bearing the words, \"long live the King of France\", and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis I.[47] The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and Portuguese establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast.[48] In general, early settlements during the Age of Discovery appear to have been short-lived due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia.[49][50]\n\n\nIn 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St John's, Newfoundland, as the first North American English seasonal camp.[51] In 1600, the French established their first seasonal trading post at Tadoussac along the Saint Lawrence.[45] French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608).[52] Among the colonists of New France, *Canadiens* extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day Maritimes, while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana.[53] The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade.[54]\n\n\nThe English established additional settlements in Newfoundland in 1610 along with settlements in the Thirteen Colonies to the south.[55][56] A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War.[57] Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War.[58]\n\n\n\n### British North America[edit]\n\n\n![Painting of General Wolfe dying in front of the British flag while attended by officers and native allies](image)Benjamin West's *The Death of General Wolfe* (1771) dramatizes James Wolfe's death during the Battle of the Plains of Abraham at Quebec.[59]\nThe Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia.[15] St John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769.[60] To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.[61] More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule.[62] It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies.[63] The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution.[15]\n\n\nAfter the successful American War of Independence, the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the newly formed United States and set the terms of peace, ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country.[64] The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of Loyalists, the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. New Brunswick was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the incorporation of Saint John, New Brunswick, as Canada's first city.[65] To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in Central Canada, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French-speaking Lower Canada (later Quebec) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later Ontario), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.[66]\n\n\n\n![Painting of Laura Secord warning British commander James FitzGibbon of an impending American attack at Beaver Dams](image)War of 1812 heroine Laura Secord warning British commander James FitzGibbon of an impending American attack at Beaver Dams[67]\nThe Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom. Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed.[68] Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850.[69] New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Gaelic-speaking Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances.[70] Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891.[25]\n\n\nThe desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837.[71] The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture.[15] The Act of Union 1840 merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America east of Lake Superior by 1855.[72] The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858).[73] The Anglo-Russian Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825) established the border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US Alaska Purchase of 1867, disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska\u2013Yukon and Alaska\u2013BC border.[74]\n\n\n\n### Confederation and expansion[edit]\n\n\n![Refer to caption](image)Animated map showing the growth and change of Canada's provinces and territories since Confederation in 1867[75]\nFollowing three constitutional conferences, the *British North America Act, 1867* officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.[76][77] Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories, where the M\u00e9tis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870.[78] British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years,[79] while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873.[80] In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory. Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905.[80] Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated south to the US.[81]\n\n\nTo open the West and encourage European immigration, the Government of Canada sponsored the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway), passed the *Dominion Lands Act* to regulate settlement and established the North-West Mounted Police to assert authority over the territory.[82][83] This period of westward expansion and nation building resulted in the displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the Canadian Prairies to \"Indian reserves\",[84] clearing the way for ethnic European block settlements.[85] This caused the collapse of the Plains Bison in western Canada and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating the land.[86] The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands.[87] The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves.[88] During this time, Canada introduced the *Indian Act* extending its control over the First Nations to education, government and legal rights.[89]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th century[edit]\n\n\n1918 Canadian War bond posters depicting three French women pulling a plow that had been constructed for horses\n![](image)\nFrench version of the poster roughly translates as \"They serve France\u2013Everyone can serve; Buy Victory Bonds\".\n![](image)\nThe same poster in English, with subtle differences in text. \"They serve France\u2014How can I serve Canada? Buy Victory Bonds\".\n\nBecause Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the British North America Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into the First World War.[90] Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of the Canadian Corps, which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of the war.[91] Out of approximately 625,000 Canadians who served in World War I, some 60,000 were killed and another 172,000 were wounded.[92] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers.[93] The *Military Service Act* brought in compulsory military service, though it, coupled with disputes over French language schools outside Quebec, deeply alienated Francophone Canadians and temporarily split the Liberal Party.[93] In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain,[91] and the *Statute of Westminster, 1931*, affirmed Canada's independence.[94]\n\n\nThe Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country.[95] In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s.[96] On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.[91]\n\n\nThe first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during the Second World War and approximately 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded.[97] Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid, the Allied invasion of Italy, the Normandy landings, the Battle of Normandy, and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944.[91] Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi Germany.[98]\n\n\nThe Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union.[91] Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.[99]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary era[edit]\n\n\nThe financial crisis of the Great Depression led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a Crown colony ruled by a British governor.[100] After two referendums, Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.[101]\n\n\nCanada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the maple leaf flag in 1965,[102] the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969,[103] and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971.[104] Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans; though, provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.[105]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)A copy of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*[106]\nFinally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the *Canada Act 1982*, the patriation of Canada's constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.[107][108][109] Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country under its own monarchy.[110][111] In 1999, Nunavut became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government.[112]\n\n\nAt the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, giving birth to a secular nationalist movement.[113] The radical Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) ignited the October Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970,[114] and the sovereignist Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was elected in 1976, organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990.[115] This led to the formation of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West.[116][117] A second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent.[118] In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional, and the Clarity Act was passed by Parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation.[115]\n\n\nIn addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history;[119] the \u00c9cole Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university shooting targeting female students;[120] and the Oka Crisis of 1990,[121] the first of a number of violent confrontations between provincial governments and Indigenous groups.[122] Canada also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a United States\u2013led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia.[123] Canada sent troops to Afghanistan in 2001 but declined to join the United States\u2013led invasion of Iraq in 2003.[124]\n\n\nIn 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into the Libyan Civil War[125] and also became involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s.[126] The country celebrated its sesquicentennial in 2017, three years before the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada began on January 27, 2020, with widespread social and economic disruption.[127] In 2021, the possible graves of hundreds of Indigenous people were discovered near the former sites of Canadian Indian residential schools.[128] Administered by various Christian churches and funded by the Canadian government from 1828 to 1997, these boarding schools attempted to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture.[37]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Canada\n\n![refer to caption](image)A topographic map of Canada, in polar projection (for 90\u00b0 W), showing elevations shaded from green to brown (higher)\nBy total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia.[129] By land area alone, Canada ranks fourth, due to having the world's largest area of fresh water lakes.[130] Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, along the Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in the west, the country encompasses 9,984,670\u00a0km2 (3,855,100\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of territory.[131] Canada also has vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of 243,042 kilometres (151,019\u00a0mi).[132][133] In addition to sharing the world's largest land border with the United States\u2014spanning 8,891\u00a0km (5,525\u00a0mi)[a]\u2014Canada shares a land border with Greenland (and hence the Kingdom of Denmark) to the northeast, on Hans Island,[134] and a maritime boundary with France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the southeast.[135] Canada is also home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island\u2014latitude 82.5\u00b0N\u2014which lies 817 kilometres (508\u00a0mi) from the North Pole.[136]\n\n\nCanada can be divided into seven physiographic regions: the Canadian Shield, the interior plains, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Appalachian region, the Western Cordillera, Hudson Bay Lowlands, and the Arctic Archipelago.[137] Boreal forests prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in northern Arctic regions and through the Rocky Mountains, and the relatively flat Canadian Prairies in the southwest facilitate productive agriculture.[131] The Great Lakes feed the St. Lawrence River (in the southeast) where the lowlands host much of Canada's economic output.[131] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes\u2014563 of which are larger than 100\u00a0km2 (39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\u2014containing much of the world's fresh water.[138][139] There are also fresh-water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies, the Coast Mountains, and the Arctic Cordillera.[140] Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably Mount Meager massif, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.[141]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Temperature in Canada\n\n![](image)K\u00f6ppen climate classification types of Canada\nAverage winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near \u221215\u00a0\u00b0C (5\u00a0\u00b0F), but can drop below \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221240\u00a0\u00b0F) with severe wind chills.[142] In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s \u00b0C (70s \u00b0F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30\u00a0\u00b0C (77 to 86\u00a0\u00b0F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F).[143]\n\n\nMuch of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost. The future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada.[144] Canada's annual average temperature over land has risen by 1.7\u00a0\u00b0C (3.1\u00a0\u00b0F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3\u00a0\u00b0C (2.0 to 4.1\u00a0\u00b0F) in various regions, since 1948.[131] The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies.[145] In the southern regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and the United States\u2014caused by metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions\u2014has resulted in acid rain, which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth, and agricultural productivity in Canada.[146]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Canada\n\n![Map showing Canada divided into different ecozones](image)Terrestrial ecozones and ecoprovinces of Canada. Ecozones are identified with a unique colour. Ecoprovinces are subdivisions of ecozones and are identified with a unique numeric code.[147]\nCanada is divided into 15 terrestrial and five marine ecozones.[148] These ecozones encompass over 80,000 classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered.[149] Although Canada has a low percentage of endemic species compared to other countries,[150] due to human activities, invasive species, and environmental issues in the country, there are currently more than 800 species at risk of being lost.[151] About 65 percent of Canada's resident species are considered \"Secure\".[152] Over half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development.[153] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with approximately 3,000,000\u00a0km2 (1,200,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry.[154] Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions,[155] with 42 percent of its land area covered by forests (approximately 8 percent of the world's forested land).[156]\n\n\nApproximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas, including 11.4 percent designated as protected areas.[157] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas.[157] Canada's first National Park, Banff National Park established in 1885, spans 6,641 square kilometres (2,564\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[158] of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes.[159] Canada's oldest provincial park, Algonquin Provincial Park, established in 1893, covers an area of 7,653.45 square kilometres (2,955.01\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It is dominated by old-growth forest with over 2,400 lakes and 1,200 kilometres of streams and rivers.[160] Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area is the world's largest freshwater protected area, spanning roughly 10,000 square kilometres (3,900\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of lakebed, its overlaying freshwater, and associated shoreline on 60 square kilometres (23\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of islands and mainland.[161] Canada's largest national wildlife region is the Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area, which spans 11,570.65 square kilometres (4,467.45\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[162] and protects critical breeding and nesting habitat for over 40 percent of British Columbia's seabirds.[163] Canada's 18 UNESCO Biosphere Reserves cover a total area of 235,000 square kilometres (91,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[164]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Canada and Politics of Canada\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Canadian Parliament Buildings and their surroundings\nCanada is described as a \"full democracy\",[165] with a tradition of liberalism,[166] and an egalitarian,[167] moderate political ideology.[168] An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture.[169][170] Peace, order, and good government, alongside an Implied Bill of Rights, are founding principles of the Canadian government.[171][172]\n\n\nAt the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two relatively centrist parties practising \"brokerage politics\":[b] the centre-left leaning Liberal Party of Canada[179][180] and the centre-right leaning Conservative Party of Canada (or its predecessors).[181] The historically predominant Liberals position themselves at the centre of the political scale.[181] Five parties had representatives elected to the Parliament in the 2021 election\u2014the Liberals, who formed a minority government; the Conservatives, who became the Official Opposition; the New Democratic Party (occupying the left[182][183]); the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois; and the Green Party of Canada.[184] Far-right and far-left politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society.[185][186][187]\n\n\nCanada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy\u2014the monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.[188][189][190][191] The reigning monarch is also monarch of 14 other Commonwealth countries (though, all are sovereign of one another[192]) and each of Canada's 10 provinces. To carry out most of their federal royal duties in Canada, the monarch appoints a representative, the governor general, on the advice of the prime minister.[193][194]\n\n\n\n![King Charles III](image)\nCharles III, King of Canada\n![Governor General Mary Simon](image)\nMary Simon, Governor General of Canada\n![Prime Minister Justin Trudeau](image)\nJustin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada\n\nThe monarchy is the source of sovereignty and authority in Canada.[191][195][196] However, while the governor general or monarch may exercise their power without ministerial advice in certain rare crisis situations,[195] the use of the executive powers (or royal prerogative) is otherwise always directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the prime minister,[197] the head of government. To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the individual who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a majority of members in the House of Commons.[198] The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is thus one of the most powerful institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies.[195] The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the leader of the Official Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.[199]\n\n\n\n![The House of Commons chamber](image)The House of Commons in its temporary location, the West Block[200]\nThe Parliament of Canada passes all statute laws within the federal sphere. It comprises the monarch, the House of Commons, and the Senate. While Canada inherited the British concept of parliamentary supremacy, this was later, with the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, all but completely superseded by the American notion of the supremacy of the law.[201]\n\n\nEach of the 338 members of Parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. The *Constitution Act, 1982*, requires that no more than five years pass between elections, although the *Canada Elections Act* limits this to four years with a \"fixed\" election date in October; general elections still must be called by the governor general and can be triggered by either the advice of the prime minister or a lost confidence vote in the House.[202][203] The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75.[204]\n\n\nCanadian federalism divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the 10 provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons.[196] Canada's three territories also have legislatures; but, these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces.[205] The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.[206]\n\n\nThe Bank of Canada is the central bank of the country.[207] The minister of finance and minister of innovation, science, and industry use the Statistics Canada agency for financial planning and economic policy development.[208] The Bank of Canada is the sole authority authorized to issue currency in the form of Canadian bank notes.[209] The bank does not issue Canadian coins; they are issued by the Royal Canadian Mint.[210]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of Canada\n\nThe Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country and consists of written text and unwritten conventions.[211] The *Constitution Act, 1867* (known as the British North America Act, 1867 prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments.[212] The *Statute of Westminster, 1931*, granted full autonomy, and the *Constitution Act, 1982*, ended all legislative ties to Britain, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.[213] The *Charter* guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be over-ridden by any government; though, a notwithstanding clause allows Parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the *Charter* for a period of five years.[214]\n\n\n\n![Supreme Court of Canada building](image)The Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa, west of Parliament Hill\nCanada's judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court, final arbiter, and has been led since December 18, 2017, by Richard Wagner, the Chief Justice of Canada.[215] The governor general appoints the court's nine members on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice.[216] The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions.[217]\n\n\nCommon law prevails everywhere, except in Quebec, where civil law predominates.[218] Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada.[219] Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially a provincial responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police forces.[220] In most rural and some urban areas, policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police.[221]\n\n\nCanadian Aboriginal law provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices for Indigenous groups in Canada.[222] Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and many Indigenous peoples.[223] Most notably, a series of 11 treaties, known as the Numbered Treaties, were signed between the Indigenous peoples and the reigning monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921.[224] These treaties are agreements between the Canadian Crown-in-Council, with the duty to consult and accommodate.[225] The role of Aboriginal law and the rights they support were reaffirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.[223] These rights may include provision of services, such as healthcare through the Indian Health Transfer Policy, and exemption from taxation.[226]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations and military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign relations of Canada, Canadian Armed Forces, and Military history of Canada\n\n![Canadian Delegation to the United Nations seated around conference table](image)The Canadian delegation to the United Nations Conference on International Organization, San Francisco, May 1945[227]\nCanada is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions.[228] Canada's foreign policy based on international peacekeeping and security is carried out through coalitions, international organizations, and the work of numerous federal institutions.[229][230] Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has played a major role in its global image.[231][232] The strategy of the Canadian government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises.[233]\n\n\nCanada and the United States have a long, complex, and intertwined relationship;[234][235] they are close allies, co-operating regularly on military campaigns and humanitarian efforts.[236][237] Canada also maintains historic and traditional ties to the United Kingdom and to France,[238] along with both countries' former colonies through its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the *Organisation internationale de la Francophonie*.[239] Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II.[98] Canada was a founding member of the United Nations and has membership in the World Trade Organization, the G20, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).[228] Canada is also a member of various other international and regional organizations and forums for economic and cultural affairs.[240] Canada acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1976.[241] The country joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in 2000 and the 3rd Summit of the Americas in 2001.[242] Canada seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).[243]\n\n\nCanada's earlier strong attachment to the British Empire and, later, the Commonwealth, led it to make significant contributions to British military efforts in the Second Boer War (1899\u20131902), the First World War (1914\u20131918), and the Second World War (1939\u20131945).[244] Since then, Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism, making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations.[245][246] During the Cold War, Canada was a major contributor to UN forces in the Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), in cooperation with the United States, to defend against potential aerial attacks from the Soviet Union.[247]\n\n\n\n![A fighter jet taking off from a runway](image)A Canadian McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet in \"special markings\" used by the 2014 CF-18 Demonstration Team[248]\nDuring the Suez Crisis of 1956, future prime minister Lester B. Pearson eased tensions by proposing the inception of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, for which he was awarded the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize.[249] As this was the first UN peacekeeping mission, Pearson is often credited as the inventor of the concept.[250] Canada has since served in over 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989,[91] and has since maintained forces in international missions in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and elsewhere. Canada has sometimes faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries, notably in the 1993 Somalia affair.[251]\n\n\nIn 2001, Canada deployed troops to Afghanistan as part of the US stabilization force and the UN-authorized, NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.[252] In August 2007, Canada's territorial claims in the Arctic were challenged after a Russian underwater expedition to the North Pole; Canada has considered that area to be sovereign territory since 1925.[253]\n\n\nThe unified Canadian Forces (CF) comprise the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force. The nation employs a professional, volunteer force of approximately 68,000 active personnel and 27,000 reserve personnel\u2014increasing to 71,500 and 30,000 respectively under \"Strong, Secure, Engaged\"[254]\u2014with a sub-component of approximately 5,000 Canadian Rangers.[255][c] In 2021, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately $26.4\u00a0billion, or around 1.3\u00a0percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).[257] Canada's total military expenditure is expected to reach $32.7\u00a0billion by 2027.[258] Canada's military currently has over 3000 personnel deployed overseas in multiple operations, such as Operation Snowgoose in Cyprus, Operation Unifier supporting Ukraine, Operation Caribbe in the Caribbean Sea, and Operation Impact, a coalition for the military intervention against ISIL.[259]\n\n\n\n### Provinces and territories[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Provinces and territories of Canada\n\nSee also: Canadian federalism\n\n![Labelled map of Canada detailing its provinces and territories](image)Political map of Canada showing its 10 provinces and 3 territories[260]\nCanada is a federation composed of 10 federated states, called provinces, and three federal territories. In turn, these may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (*Eastern Canada* refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together).[261] Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare, education, and welfare,[262] as well as administration of justice (but not criminal law). Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, a rarity among other federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas such as health and child care; the provinces can opt out of these cost-share programs but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.[263]\n\n\nThe major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their sovereignty from the Crown[264] and power and authority from the *Constitution Act, 1867*, whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada[265] and the commissioners represent the King in his federal Council,[266] rather than the monarch directly. The powers flowing from the *Constitution Act, 1867*, are divided between the federal government and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively[267] and any changes to that arrangement require a constitutional amendment, while changes to the roles and powers of the territories may be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada.[268]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Canada\n\n![](image)The Toronto financial district is the second-largest financial centre in North America, the seventh-largest globally in employment and the heart of Canada's finance industry.[269]\nCanada has a highly developed mixed-market economy,[270][271] with the world's ninth-largest economy as of 2023[update], and a nominal GDP of approximately US$2.221\u00a0trillion.[272] It is one of the world's largest trading nations, with a highly globalized economy.[273] In 2021, Canadian trade in goods and services reached $2.016\u00a0trillion.[274] Canada's exports totalled over $637\u00a0billion, while its imported goods were worth over $631\u00a0billion, of which approximately $391\u00a0billion originated from the United States.[274] In 2018, Canada had a trade deficit in goods of $22\u00a0billion and a trade deficit in services of $25\u00a0billion.[274] The Toronto Stock Exchange is the ninth-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of over US$2\u00a0trillion.[275]\n\n\nCanada has a strong cooperative banking sector, with the world's highest per-capita membership in credit unions.[276] It ranks low in the Corruption Perceptions Index (14th in 2023)[277] and \"is widely regarded as among the least corrupt countries of the world\".[278] It ranks high in the Global Competitiveness Report (14th in 2019)[279] and Global Innovation Index (15th in 2023).[280] Canada's economy ranks above most Western nations on The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom[281] and experiences a relatively low level of income disparity.[282] The country's average household disposable income per capita is \"well above\" the OECD average.[283] Canada ranks among the lowest of the most developed countries for housing affordability[284][285] and foreign direct investment.[286][285]\n\n\nSince the early 20th century, the growth of Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one.[287] Like many other developed countries, the Canadian economy is dominated by the service industry, which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce.[288] Among developed countries, Canada has an unusually important primary sector, of which the forestry and petroleum industries are the most prominent components.[289] Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustained by nearby mines or sources of timber.[290]\n\n\n\n![](image)Canada\nCountries and territories with free-trade agreements[291]\n\nCanada's economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II.[292] The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing industry.[293] The Canada\u00a0\u2013 United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994 (later replaced by the Canada\u2013United States\u2013Mexico Agreement).[294] As of 2023, Canada is a signatory to 15 free trade agreements with 51 different countries.[291]\n\n\nCanada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy.[289][295] Atlantic Canada possess vast offshore deposits of natural gas,[296] and Alberta hosts the fourth-largest oil reserves in the world.[297] The vast Athabasca oil sands and other oil reserves give Canada 13\u00a0percent of global oil reserves, constituting the world's third or fourth-largest.[298] Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies region is one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains.[299] The country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, platinoids, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal, lead, copper, molybdenum, cobalt, and cadmium.[300][301] Canada has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.[302] The fishing industry is also a key contributor to the economy.[303]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Canada\n\nIn 2020, Canada spent approximately $41.9\u00a0billion on domestic research and development, with supplementary estimates for 2022 at $43.2\u00a0billion.[304] As of 2023[update], the country has produced 15 Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and medicine.[305] The country ranks seventh in the worldwide share of articles published in scientific journals, according to the Nature Index,[306] and is home to the headquarters of a number of global technology firms.[307] Canada has one of the highest levels of Internet access in the world, with over 33\u00a0million users, equivalent to around 94 percent of its total population.[308]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Canadian-built Space Shuttle robotic arm (left), referred to as Canadarm, transferred the P5 truss segment over to the Canadian-built space station robotic arm, referred to as Canadarm2.[309]\nCanada's developments in science and technology include the creation of the modern alkaline battery,[310] the discovery of insulin,[311] the development of the polio vaccine,[312] and discoveries about the interior structure of the atomic nucleus.[313] Other major Canadian scientific contributions include the artificial cardiac pacemaker, mapping the visual cortex,[314][315] the development of the electron microscope,[316][317] plate tectonics, deep learning, multi-touch technology, and the identification of the first black hole, Cygnus X-1.[318] Canada has a long history of discovery in genetics, which include stem cells, site-directed mutagenesis, T-cell receptor, and the identification of the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis, and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases.[315][319]\n\n\nThe Canadian Space Agency operates a highly active space program, conducting deep-space, planetary, and aviation research and developing rockets and satellites.[320] Canada was the third country to design and construct a satellite after the Soviet Union and the United States, with the 1962 Alouette 1 launch.[321] Canada is a participant in the International Space Station (ISS), and is a pioneer in space robotics, having constructed the Canadarm, Canadarm2, Canadarm3 and Dextre robotic manipulators for the ISS and NASA's Space Shuttle.[322] Since the 1960s, Canada's aerospace industry has designed and built numerous marques of satellite, including Radarsat-1 and 2, ISIS, and MOST.[323] Canada has also produced one of the world's most successful and widely used sounding rockets, the Black Brant.[324]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Canada and List of cities in Canada\n\n![](image)Canada population density map (2014)[325]\nThe 2021 Canadian census enumerated a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016 figure.[326] It is estimated that Canada's population surpassed 40,000,000 in 2023.[327] The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth.[328] Canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world,[329] driven mainly by economic policy and also family reunification.[330][331] A record 405,000 immigrants were admitted to Canada in 2021.[332] Canada leads the world in refugee resettlement; it resettled more than 28,000 in 2018.[333] New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas in the country, such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.[334]\n\n\nCanada's population density, at 4.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (11/sq\u00a0mi), is among the lowest in the world.[326] Canada spans latitudinally from the 83rd parallel north to the 41st parallel north and approximately 95\u00a0percent of the population is found south of the 55th parallel north.[335] About 80 percent of the population lives within 150 kilometres (93\u00a0mi) of the border with the contiguous United States.[336] Canada is highly urbanized, with over 80 percent of the population living urban centres.[337] The most densely populated part of the country, accounting for nearly 50 percent, is the Quebec City\u2013Windsor Corridor in Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.[338][335]\n\n\nThe majority of Canadians (81.1\u00a0percent) live in family households, 12.1\u00a0percent report living alone, and those living with other relatives or unrelated persons reported at 6.8\u00a0percent.[339] Fifty-one\u00a0percent of households are couples with or without children, 8.7\u00a0percent are single-parent households, 2.9\u00a0percent are multigenerational households, and 29.3\u00a0percent are single-person households.[339]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in Canada2021 Canadian census[340]\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. |\n| 1 | Toronto | Ontario | 6,202,225 | 11 | London | Ontario | 543,551\n |\n| 2 | Montreal | Quebec | 4,291,732 | 12 | Halifax | Nova Scotia | 465,703\n |\n| 3 | Vancouver | British Columbia | 2,642,825 | 13 | Niagara Region | Ontario | 433,604\n |\n| 4 | Ottawa\u2013Gatineau | Ontario\u2013Quebec | 1,488,307 | 14 | Windsor | Ontario | 422,630\n |\n| 5 | Calgary | Alberta | 1,481,806 | 15 | Oshawa | Ontario | 415,311\n |\n| 6 | Edmonton | Alberta | 1,418,118 | 16 | Victoria | British Columbia | 397,237\n |\n| 7 | Quebec City | Quebec | 839,311 | 17 | Saskatoon | Saskatchewan | 317,480\n |\n| 8 | Winnipeg | Manitoba | 834,678 | 18 | Regina | Saskatchewan | 249,217\n |\n| 9 | Hamilton | Ontario | 785,184 | 19 | Sherbrooke | Quebec | 227,398\n |\n| 10 | Waterloo Region | Ontario | 575,847 | 20 | Kelowna | British Columbia | 222,162\n |\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic origins of people in Canada\n\nAccording to the 2021 Canadian census, over 450 \"ethnic or cultural origins\" were self-reported by Canadians.[341] The major panethnic groups chosen were: European (52.5\u00a0percent), North American (22.9\u00a0percent), Asian (19.3\u00a0percent), North American Indigenous (6.1\u00a0percent), African (3.8\u00a0percent), Latin, Central and South American (2.5\u00a0percent), Caribbean (2.1\u00a0percent), Oceanian (0.3\u00a0percent), and other (6\u00a0percent).[341][342] Over 60 percent of Canadians reported a single origin, and 36 percent of Canadians reported having multiple ethnic origins, thus the overall total is greater than 100\u00a0percent.[341]\n\n\n\n![](image)The top 168 ethnic or cultural origins self-reported by Canadians in the 2021 census[343]\nThe country's ten largest self-reported specific ethnic or cultural origins in 2021 were Canadian[d] (accounting for 15.6\u00a0percent of the population), followed by English (14.7\u00a0percent), Irish (12.1\u00a0percent), Scottish (12.1\u00a0percent), French (11.0\u00a0percent), German (8.1\u00a0percent), Chinese (4.7\u00a0percent), Italian (4.3\u00a0percent), Indian (3.7\u00a0percent), and Ukrainian (3.5\u00a0percent).[347]\n\n\nOf the 36.3 million people enumerated in 2021, approximately 25.4 million reported being \"White\", representing 69.8\u00a0percent of the population.[348] The Indigenous population representing 5\u00a0percent or 1.8 million individuals, grew by 9.4\u00a0percent compared to the non-Indigenous population, which grew by 5.3\u00a0percent from 2016 to 2021.[348] One out of every four Canadians or 26.5\u00a0percent of the population belonged to a non-White and non-Indigenous visible minority,[349][e] the largest of which in 2021 were South Asian (2.6 million people; 7.1\u00a0percent), Chinese (1.7 million; 4.7\u00a0percent), and Black (1.5 million; 4.3\u00a0percent).[351]\n\n\nBetween 2011 and 2016, the visible minority population rose by 18.4\u00a0percent.[352] In 1961, about 300,000 people, less than two percent of Canada's population, were members of visible minority groups.[353] The 2021 census indicated that 8.3\u00a0million people, or almost one-quarter (23.0\u00a0percent) of the population, reported themselves as being or having been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada\u2014above the 1921 census previous record of 22.3\u00a0percent.[354] In 2021, India, China, and the Philippines were the top three countries of origin for immigrants moving to Canada.[355]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Canada\n\n![Map of Canada with English speakers and French speakers at a percentage](image)Approximately 98\u00a0percent of Canadians can speak either or both English and French:[356]English \u2013 57%\nEnglish and French \u2013 16%\nFrench \u2013 21%\nSparsely populated area ( < 0.4 persons per km2)\n\nA multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 54\u00a0percent and 19\u00a0percent of Canadians, respectively.[339] As of the 2021 census, just over 7.8\u00a0million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some of the most common non-official first languages include Mandarin (679,255 first-language speakers), Punjabi (666,585), Cantonese (553,380), Spanish (538,870), Arabic (508,410), Tagalog (461,150), Italian (319,505), German (272,865), and Tamil (237,890).[339] Canada's federal government practises official bilingualism, which is applied by the commissioner of official languages in consonance with section 16 of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* and the federal *Official Languages Act*. English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions. Citizens have the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French and official-language minorities are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.[357]\n\n\nThe 1977 *Charter of the French Language* established French as the official language of Quebec.[358] Although more than 82 percent of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial Francophone populations in New Brunswick, Alberta, and Manitoba; Ontario has the largest French-speaking population outside Quebec.[359] New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province, has a French-speaking Acadian minority constituting 33 percent of the population.[360] There are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, and in central and western Prince Edward Island.[361]\n\n\nOther provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official.[362] There are 11 Indigenous language groups, composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects.[363] Several Indigenous languages have official status in the Northwest Territories.[364] Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut and is one of three official languages in the territory.[365]\n\n\nAdditionally, Canada is home to many sign languages, some of which are Indigenous.[366] American Sign Language (ASL) is used across the country due to the prevalence of ASL in primary and secondary schools.[367] Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) is used primarily in Quebec.[368]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Canada\n\n![](image)Freedom of religion sculpture by Marlene Hilton Moore at the McMurtry Gardens of Justice in Toronto[369]\nCanada is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and customs.[370] The Constitution of Canada refers to God and the monarch carries the title of *Defender of the Faith*; however, Canada has no official church and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism.[371] Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference.[372]\n\n\nRates of religious adherence have steadily decreased since the 1970s.[370] With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life,[373] Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state.[374][375][376] Although the majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives,[377] they still believe in God.[378] The practice of religion is generally considered a private matter throughout Canadian society and by the state.[379]\n\n\nAccording to the 2021 census, Christianity is the largest religion in Canada, with Roman Catholics representing 29.9\u00a0percent of the population having the most adherents. Christians overall representing 53.3\u00a0percent of the population,[f] are followed by people reporting irreligion or having no religion at 34.6\u00a0percent.[382] Other faiths include Islam (4.9\u00a0percent), Hinduism (2.3\u00a0percent), Sikhism (2.1\u00a0percent), Buddhism (1.0\u00a0percent), Judaism (0.9\u00a0percent), and Indigenous spirituality (0.2\u00a0percent).[383] Canada has the second-largest national Sikh population, behind India.[384]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Canada\n\nHealthcare in Canada is delivered through the provincial and territorial systems of publicly funded health care, informally called Medicare.[385][386] It is guided by the provisions of the *Canada Health Act* of 1984[387] and is universal.[388] Universal access to publicly funded health services \"is often considered by Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national healthcare insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country.\"[389] Around 30\u00a0percent of Canadians' healthcare is paid for through the private sector.[390] This mostly pays for services not covered or partially covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry.[390] Approximately 65 to 75\u00a0percent of Canadians have some form of supplementary health insurance; many receive it through their employers or access secondary social service programs.[391][390]\n\n\n\n![graph of expenditures as described in the caption](image)Health expenditure and financing by country. Total health expenditure per capita in US dollars (PPP).\nIn common with many other developed countries, Canada is experiencing an increase in healthcare expenditures due to a demographic shift toward an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2021, the average age in Canada was 41.9 years.[339] Life expectancy is 81.1 years.[392] A 2016 report by the chief public health officer found that 88\u00a0percent of Canadians, one of the highest proportions of the population among G7 countries, indicated that they \"had good or very good health\".[393] Eighty\u00a0percent of Canadian adults self-report having at least one major risk factor for chronic disease: smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating or excessive alcohol use.[394] Canada has one of the highest rates of adult obesity among OECD countries, contributing to approximately 2.7\u00a0million cases of diabetes.[394] Four chronic diseases\u2014cancer (leading cause of death), cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and diabetes\u2014account for 65\u00a0percent of deaths in Canada.[395][396]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Canadian Institute for Health Information reported that healthcare spending reached $308\u00a0billion, or 12.7 percent of Canada's GDP for that year.[397] In 2022, Canada's per-capita spending on health expenditures ranked 12th among health-care systems in the OECD.[398] Canada has performed close to, or above the average on the majority of OECD health indicators since the early 2000s, ranking above the average on OECD indicators for wait-times and access to care, with average scores for quality of care and use of resources.[399][400] The Commonwealth Fund's 2021 report comparing the healthcare systems of the 11 most developed countries ranked Canada second-to-last.[401] Identified weaknesses were comparatively higher infant mortality rate, the prevalence of chronic conditions, long wait times, poor availability of after-hours care, and a lack of prescription drugs and dental coverage.[401] An increasing problem in Canada's health system is a lack of healthcare professionals.[402]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Canada and Higher education in Canada\n\n![The University of Toronto campus](image)University College, seen through the main gate and up King's College Road, at Canada's largest post-secondary institution, the University of Toronto\nEducation in Canada is for the most part provided publicly, funded and overseen by federal, provincial, and local governments.[403] Education is within provincial jurisdiction and the curriculum is overseen by the province.[404][405] Education in Canada is generally divided into primary education, followed by secondary education and post-secondary. Education in both English and French is available in most places across Canada.[406] Canada has a large number of universities, almost all of which are publicly funded.[407] Established in 1663, Universit\u00e9 Laval is the oldest post-secondary institution in Canada.[408] The largest university is the University of Toronto with over 85,000 students.[409] Four universities are regularly ranked among the top 100 world-wide, namely University of Toronto, University of British Columbia, McGill University, and McMaster University, with a total of 18 universities ranked in the top 500 worldwide.[410]\n\n\nAccording to a 2019 report by the OECD, Canada is one of the most educated countries in the world;[411] the country ranks first worldwide in the percentage of adults having tertiary education, with over 56 percent of Canadian adults having attained at least an undergraduate college or university degree.[411] Canada spends about 5.3\u00a0percent of its GDP on education.[412] The country invests heavily in tertiary education (more than US$20,000 per student).[413] As of 2014[update], 89 percent of adults aged 25 to 64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, compared to an OECD average of 75 percent.[414]\n\n\nThe mandatory education age ranges between 5\u20137 to 16\u201318 years,[415] contributing to an adult literacy rate of 99 percent.[416] Just over 60,000 children are homeschooled in the country as of 2016. The Programme for International Student Assessment indicates Canadian students perform well above the OECD average, particularly in mathematics, science, and reading,[417][418] ranking the overall knowledge and skills of Canadian 15-year-olds as the sixth-best in the world, although these scores have been declining in recent years. Canada is a well-performing OECD country in reading literacy, mathematics, and science, with the average student scoring 523.7, compared with the OECD average of 493 in 2015.[419][420]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Canada\n\n![](image)*Monument to Multiculturalism* by Francesco Pirelli, in Toronto\nCanada's culture draws influences from its broad range of constituent nationalities and policies that promote a \"just society\" are constitutionally protected.[421][422][423] Since the 1960s, Canada has emphasized equality and inclusiveness for all its people.[424][425][426] The official state policy of multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments[427] and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity.[428][429] In Quebec, cultural identity is strong and there is a French Canadian culture that is distinct from English Canadian culture.[430]\n\n\nCanada's approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is based on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support.[431] Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control, a social liberal attitude toward women's rights (like pregnancy termination) and LGBT rights, and legalized euthanasia and cannabis use are indicators of Canada's political and cultural values.[432][433][434] Canadians also identify with the country's foreign aid policies, peacekeeping roles, the national park system, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[435][436]\n\n\nHistorically, Canada has been influenced by British, French, and Indigenous cultures and traditions. Through their language, art, and music, Indigenous peoples continue to influence the Canadian identity.[437] During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean, and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture.[438]\n\n\n\n### Symbols[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: National symbols of Canada and Canadian royal symbols\n\n![The mother beaver sculpture outside the House of Commons](image)*The mother beaver* on the Canadian parliament's Peace Tower.[439] The five flowers on the shield each represent an ethnicity\u2014Tudor rose: English; Fleur de lis: French; thistle: Scottish; shamrock: Irish; and leek: Welsh.\nThemes of nature, pioneers, trappers, and traders played an important part in the early development of Canadian symbolism.[440] Modern symbols emphasize the country's geography, cold climate, lifestyles, and the Canadianization of traditional European and Indigenous symbols.[441] The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags and on the Arms of Canada.[442] Canada's official tartan, known as the \"maple leaf tartan\", has four colours that reflect the colours of the maple leaf as it changes through the seasons\u2014green in the spring, gold in the early autumn, red at the first frost, and brown after falling.[443] The Arms of Canada are closely modelled after those of the United Kingdom, with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version.[444]\n\n\nOther prominent symbols include the national motto, \"*A mari usque ad mare*\" (\"From Sea to Sea\"),[445] the sports of ice hockey and lacrosse, the beaver, Canada goose, common loon, Canadian horse, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rockies,[442] and, more recently, the totem pole and Inuksuk.[446] Canadian beer, maple syrup, tuques, canoes, nanaimo bars, butter tarts, and poutine are defined as uniquely Canadian.[446][447] Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50\u00a2 piece, and the beaver on the nickel.[448] An image of the previous monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, appears on $20 bank notes and the obverse of all current Canadian coins.[448]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Canadian literature\n\nCanadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively.[449] The earliest Canadian narratives were of travel and exploration.[450] This progressed into three major themes that can be found within historical Canadian literature: nature, frontier life, and Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the garrison mentality.[451] In recent decades, Canada's literature has been strongly influenced by immigrants from around the world.[452] By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best.[453]\n\n\nNumerous Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards,[454] including novelist, poet, and literary critic Margaret Atwood, who received two Booker Prizes;[455] Nobel laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English;[456] and Booker Prize recipient Michael Ondaatje, who wrote the novel *The English Patient*, which was adapted as a film of the same name that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.[457] L. M. Montgomery produced a series of children's novels beginning in 1908 with *Anne of Green Gables*.[458]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media of Canada\n\n![](image)A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) satellite truck, used for live television broadcasts\nCanada's media is highly autonomous, uncensored, diverse, and very regionalized.[459][460] The *Broadcasting Act* declares \"the system should serve to safeguard, enrich, and strengthen the cultural, political, social, and economic fabric of Canada\".[461] Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output\u2014particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines\u2014is often overshadowed by imports from the United States.[462] As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).[463]\n\n\nCanadian mass media, both print and digital, and in both official languages, is largely dominated by a \"handful of corporations\".[464] The largest of these corporations is the country's national public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which also plays a significant role in producing domestic cultural content, operating its own radio and TV networks in both English and French.[465] In addition to the CBC, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as TVOntario and T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec.[466]\n\n\nNon-news media content in Canada, including film and television, is influenced both by local creators as well as by imports from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France.[467] In an effort to reduce the amount of foreign-made media, government interventions in television broadcasting can include both regulation of content and public financing.[468] Canadian tax laws limit foreign competition in magazine advertising.[469]\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Canadian art\n\n![Oil on canvas painting of a tree dominating its rocky landscape during a sunset](image)*The Jack Pine* by Tom Thomson. Oil on canvas, 1916, in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada.[470]\nArt in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by its Indigenous peoples,[471] and, in later times, artists have combined British, French, Indigenous, and American artistic traditions, at times embracing European styles while working to promote nationalism.[472] The nature of Canadian art reflects these diverse origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality of their lives in Canada.[473]\n\n\nThe Canadian government has played a role in the development of Canadian culture through the department of Canadian Heritage, by giving grants to art galleries,[474] as well as establishing and funding art schools and colleges across the country, and through the Canada Council for the Arts, the national public arts funder, helping artists, art galleries and periodicals, and thus contributing to the development of Canada's cultural works.[475]\n\n\nCanadian visual art has been dominated by figures, such as painter Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven.[476] The latter were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who first exhibited their distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to as having seven members, five artists\u2014Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley\u2014were responsible for articulating the group's ideas. They were joined briefly by Frank Johnston and commercial artist Franklin Carmichael. A. J. Casson became part of the group in 1926.[477] Associated with the group was another prominent Canadian artist, Emily Carr, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast.[478]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Canada\n\n![](image)Original publication of \"O Canada\", 1908\nCanadian music reflects a variety of regional scenes.[479] Canada has developed a vast music infrastructure that includes church halls, chamber halls, conservatories, academies, performing arts centres, record companies, radio stations, and television music video channels.[480] Government support programs, such as the Canada Music Fund, assist a wide range of musicians and entrepreneurs who create, produce and market original and diverse Canadian music.[481] As a result of its cultural importance, as well as government initiatives and regulations, the Canadian music industry is one of the largest in the world,[482] producing internationally renowned composers, musicians, and ensembles.[483] Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC.[484] The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada's music industry awards, the Juno Awards.[485] The Canadian Music Hall of Fame honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements.[486]\n\n\nPatriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years. The earliest work of patriotic music in Canada, \"The Bold Canadian\", was written in 1812.[487] \"The Maple Leaf Forever\", written in 1866, was a popular patriotic song throughout English Canada and, for many years, served as an unofficial national anthem.[488] \"O Canada\" was adopted as the official anthem in 1980.[489] Calixa Lavall\u00e9e wrote the music, which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. The text was originally only in French before it was adapted into English in 1906.[490]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Canada\n\n![](image)The Canadian men's national ice hockey team celebrates shortly after winning the gold medal final at the 2010 Winter Olympics.\nThe roots of organized sports in Canada date back to the 1770s,[491] culminating in the development and popularization of the major professional games of ice hockey, lacrosse, curling, basketball, baseball, soccer, and Canadian football.[492] Canada's official national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse.[493] Other sports such as golf, volleyball, skiing, cycling, swimming, badminton, tennis, bowling, and the study of martial arts are all widely enjoyed at the youth and amateur levels.[494] Great achievements in Canadian sports are recognized by Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.[495] There are numerous other sport \"halls of fame\" in Canada, such as the Hockey Hall of Fame.[495]\n\n\nCanada shares several major professional sports leagues with the United States.[496] Canadian teams in these leagues include seven franchises in the National Hockey League, as well as three Major League Soccer teams and one team in each of Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. Other popular professional competitions include the Canadian Football League, National Lacrosse League, the Canadian Premier League, and the various curling tournaments sanctioned and organized by Curling Canada.[497]\n\n\nCanada has enjoyed success both at the Winter Olympics and at the Summer Olympics[498]\u2014though, particularly, the Winter Games as a \"winter sports nation\"\u2014and has hosted several high-profile international sporting events such as the 1976 Summer Olympics,[499] the 1988 Winter Olympics,[500] the 2010 Winter Olympics,[501][502] and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.[503] Most recently, Canada hosted the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games in Toronto.[504] The country is scheduled to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Mexico and the United States.[505]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Canada portal\n* ![icon](image)Countries portal\n\n\n* Index of Canada-related articles\n* List of Canada-related topics by provinces and territories\n* Outline of Canada\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 6,416\u00a0km (3,987\u00a0mi) via the contiguous 48 states and 2,475\u00a0km (1,538\u00a0mi) via Alaska[133]\n2. **^** \"Brokerage politics: A Canadian term for successful big tent parties that embody a pluralistic catch-all approach to appeal to the median Canadian voter ... adopting centrist policies and electoral coalitions to satisfy the short-term preferences of a majority of electors who are not located on the ideological fringe.\"[173][174] \"The traditional *brokerage* model of Canadian politics leaves little room for ideology.\"[175][176][177][178]\n3. **^**  \"The Royal Canadian Navy is composed of approximately 8,400 full-time sailors and 5,100 part-time sailors.

It covers an area of 923,769 square kilometres (356,669\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and with a population of over 230 million, it is the most populous country in Africa, and the world's sixth-most populous country. Nigeria borders Niger in the north, Chad in the northeast, Cameroon in the east, and Benin in the west. Nigeria is a federal republic comprising 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, where the capital, Abuja, is located. The largest city in Nigeria is Lagos, one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world and the largest in Africa.\n\n\nNigeria has been home to several indigenous pre-colonial states and kingdoms since the second millennium BC, with the Nok civilization in the 15th century BC marking the first internal unification in the country.[10] The modern state originated with British colonialization in the 19th century, taking its present territorial shape with the merging of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate in 1914 by Lord Lugard. The British set up administrative and legal structures while practising indirect rule through traditional chiefdoms in the Nigeria region.[11] Nigeria became a formally independent federation on 1 October 1960. It experienced a civil war from 1967 to 1970, followed by a succession of military dictatorships and democratically elected civilian governments until achieving a stable democracy in the 1999 presidential election. The 2015 general election was the first time an incumbent president failed to be re-elected.[12]\n\n\nNigeria is a multinational state inhabited by more than 250 ethnic groups speaking 500 distinct languages, all identifying with a wide variety of cultures.[13][14][15] The three largest ethnic groups are the Hausa in the north, Yoruba in the west, and Igbo in the east, together constituting over 60% of the total population.[16] The official language is English, chosen to facilitate linguistic unity at the national level.[17] Nigeria's constitution ensures *de jure* freedom of religion[18] and it is home to some of the world's largest Muslim and Christian populations.[19] Nigeria is divided roughly in half between Muslims, who live mostly in the north, and Christians, who live mostly in the south; indigenous religions, such as those native to the Igbo and Yoruba ethnicities, are in the minority.[20]\n\n\nNigeria is a regional power in Africa and a middle and emerging power in international affairs. Nigeria's economy is the largest in Africa, the 39th-largest in the world by nominal GDP, and 27th-largest by PPP. Nigeria is often referred to as the Giant of Africa owing to its large population and economy[21] and is considered to be an emerging market by the World Bank. Nigeria is a founding member of the African Union and a member of many international organizations, including the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, NAM,[22] the Economic Community of West African States, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and OPEC. It is also a member of the informal MINT group of countries and is one of the Next Eleven economies.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe name *Nigeria* was taken from the Niger River running through the country. This name was coined on 8 January 1897, by the British journalist Flora Shaw, who later married Frederick Lugard, a British colonial administrator. The neighbouring Republic of Niger takes its name from the same river. The origin of the name *Niger*, which originally applied to only the middle reaches of the Niger River, is uncertain. The word is likely an alteration of the Tuareg name *egerew n-igerewen* used by inhabitants along the middle reaches of the river around Timbuktu before 19th-century European colonialism.[23][24]\n\n\nBefore Flora Shaw suggested the name *Nigeria*, other competing names included \"Royal Niger Company Territories\", \"Central Sudan\", \"Niger Empire\", \"Niger Sudan\", and \"Hausa Territories\".[25]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Nigeria and Timeline of Nigerian history\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prehistory of Nigeria\n\nKainji Dam excavations showed ironworking by the 2nd century BC. The transition from Neolithic times to the Iron Age was accomplished without intermediate bronze production. Some have suggested the technology moved west from the Nile Valley. But the Iron Age in the Niger River valley and the forest region appears to predate the introduction of metallurgy in the upper savanna by more than 800 years, as well as predating it in the Nile Valley. And more recent research suggests that iron metallurgy was developed independently in sub-saharan Africa.[26][27][28][29]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nok sculpture, terracotta\nThe Nok civilization of Nigeria thrived between 1,500 BC and AD 200. It produced life-sized terracotta figures that are some of the earliest known sculptures in Sub-Saharan Africa[30][31][32][33][34] and smelted iron by about 550 BC and possibly a few centuries earlier.[35][36][37] Evidence of iron smelting has also been excavated at sites in the Nsukka region of southeast Nigeria: dating to 2000 BC at the site of Lejja[38] and to 750 BC and at the site of Opi.\n\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Nigeria before 1500\n\n![](image)Royal Benin ivory mask, one of Nigeria's most recognized artifacts. Benin Empire, 16th century.\nThe *Kano Chronicle* highlights an ancient history dating to around 999 AD of the Hausa Sahelian city-state of Kano, with other major Hausa cities (or Hausa Bakwai) of Daura, Hadeija, Kano, Katsina, Zazzau, Rano, and Gobir all having recorded histories dating back to the 10th century. With the spread of Islam from the 7th century AD, the area became known as *Sudan* or as *Bilad Al Sudan* (English: Land of the Blacks; Arabic: \u0628\u0644\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u062f\u0627\u0646). Since the populations were partially affiliated with the Arab Muslim culture of North Africa, they began trans-Saharan trade and were referred to by the Arabic speakers as *Al-Sudan* (meaning \"The Blacks\") as they were considered an extended part of the Muslim world. There are early historical references by medieval Arab and Muslim historians and geographers which refer to the Kanem-Bornu Empire as the region's major centre for Islamic civilization.\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Nri of the Igbo people consolidated in the 10th century and continued until it lost its sovereignty to the British in 1911.[39][40] Nri was ruled by the Eze Nri, and the city of Nri is considered to be the foundation of Igbo culture. Nri and Aguleri, where the Igbo creation myth originates, are in the territory of the Umeuri clan. Members of the clan trace their lineages back to the patriarchal king-figure Eri.[41] In West Africa, the oldest bronzes made using the lost wax process were from Igbo-Ukwu, a city under Nri influence.[39]\n\n\nThe Yoruba kingdoms of Ife and Oyo in southwestern Nigeria became prominent in the 12th[42][43] and 14th[44] centuries, respectively. The oldest signs of human settlement at Ife's current site date back to the 9th century,[42] and its material culture includes terracotta and bronze figures.\n\n\n\n### Pre-colonial era[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of Nigeria (1500\u20131800)\n\n![](image)Depiction of Benin City by a Dutch illustrator in 1668. The wall-like structure in the centre probably represents the walls of Benin, housing the Benin bronze decorated historic Benin City Palace.\nIn the 16th century, Portuguese explorers were the first Europeans to begin important, direct trade with the peoples of southern Nigeria, at the port they named Lagos (formerly Eko) and in Calabar along the region Slave Coast. Europeans traded goods with peoples at the coast; coastal trade with Europeans also marked the beginnings of the Atlantic slave trade.[45] The port of Calabar on the historical Bight of Biafra (now commonly referred to as the Bight of Bonny) became one of the largest slave-trading posts in West Africa in the era of the Atlantic slave trade. Other major slaving ports in Nigeria were located in Badagry, Lagos on the Bight of Benin, and Bonny Island on the Bight of Biafra.[45][46] The majority of those enslaved and taken to these ports were captured in raids and wars.[47] Usually, the captives were taken back to the conquerors' territory as forced labour; after time, they were sometimes acculturated and absorbed into the conquerors' society. Slave routes were established throughout Nigeria linking the hinterland areas with the major coastal ports. Some of the more prolific slave-trading kingdoms who participated in the Atlantic slave trade were linked with the Edo's Benin Empire in the south, Oyo Empire in the southwest, and the Aro Confederacy in the southeast.[45][46] Benin's power lasted between the 15th and 19th centuries.[48] Oyo, at its territorial zenith in the late 17th to early 18th centuries, extended its influence from western Nigeria to modern-day Togo.\n\n\nIn the north, the incessant fighting amongst the Hausa city-states and the decline of the Bornu Empire gave rise to the Fulani people gaining headway into the region. Until this point, the Fulani, a nomadic ethnic group, primarily traversed the semi-desert Sahelian region north of Sudan with cattle and avoided trade and intermingling with the Sudanic peoples. At the beginning of the 19th century, Usman dan Fodio led a successful jihad against the Hausa Kingdoms, founding the centralised Sokoto Caliphate. This empire, with Arabic as its official language, grew rapidly under his rule and that of his descendants, who sent out invading armies in every direction. The vast landlocked empire connected the east with the western Sudan region and made inroads down south conquering parts of the Oyo Empire (modern-day Kwara), and advanced towards the Yoruba heartland of Ibadan, to reach the Atlantic Ocean. The territory controlled by the empire included much of modern-day northern and central Nigeria. The sultan sent out emirs to establish suzerainty over the conquered territories and promote Islamic civilization; the emirs in turn became increasingly rich and powerful through trade and slavery. By the 1890s, the largest slave population in the world, about two million, was concentrated in the territories of the Sokoto Caliphate. The use of slave labour was extensive, especially in agriculture.[49] By the time of its break-up in 1903 into various European colonies, the Sokoto Caliphate was one of the largest pre-colonial African states.[50]\n\n\nA changing legal imperative (the outlawing of the Atlantic slave trade in 1807) and economic imperative (a desire for political and social stability) led most European powers to support the widespread cultivation of agricultural products, such as the palm, for use in European industry. European companies engaged in the Atlantic slave trade until it was outlawed in 1807 by Britain, which up until that point had been the second largest actor in the trade. The slave trade continued after the ban, as illegal smugglers purchased slaves along the coast from native slavers. Britain's West Africa Squadron sought to intercept the smugglers at sea. The rescued slaves were taken to Freetown, a colony in West Africa originally established by Lieutenant John Clarkson for the resettlement of slaves freed by Britain in North America after the American Revolutionary War.\n\n\n\n### British colonization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Colonial Nigeria and Royal Niger Company\n\nBritain intervened in the Lagos kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave-trade-friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba Akitoye and signing the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos on 1\u00a0January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as a crown colony in August 1861 with the Lagos Treaty of Cession. British missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland. In 1864, Samuel Ajayi Crowther became the first African bishop of the Anglican Church.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)Flag of the Lagos Colony\nIn 1885, British claims to a West African sphere of influence received recognition from other European nations at the Berlin Conference. The following year, it chartered the Royal Niger Company under the leadership of Sir George Taubman Goldie. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the company had vastly succeeded in subjugating the independent southern kingdoms along the Niger River, the British conquered Benin in 1897, and, in the Anglo-Aro War (1901\u20131902), defeated other opponents. The defeat of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule. In 1900, the company's territory came under the direct control of the British government and established the Southern Nigeria Protectorate as a British protectorate and part of the British Empire, the foremost world power at the time.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Lord and Lady Lugard, 1908\nBy 1902, the British had begun plans to move north into the Sokoto Caliphate. British General Lord Frederick Lugard was tasked by the Colonial Office to implement the agenda. Lugard used rivalries between many of the emirs in the southern reach of the caliphate and the central Sokoto administration to prevent any defence as he worked towards the capital. As the British approached the city of Sokoto, Sultan Muhammadu Attahiru I organized a quick defence of the city and fought the advancing British-led forces. The British force quickly won, sending Attahiru I and thousands of followers on a Mahdist *hijra*. In the northeast, the decline of the Bornu Empire gave rise to the British-controlled Borno Emirate which established Abubakar Garbai of Borno as ruler.\n\n\n\n![](image)Emir of Kano with cavalry, 1911In 1903, the British victory in the Battle of Kano gave them a logistical edge in pacifying the heartland of the Sokoto Caliphate and parts of the former Bornu Empire. On 13 March 1903, at the grand market square of Sokoto, the last vizier of the caliphate officially conceded to British rule. The British appointed Muhammadu Attahiru II as the new caliph. Lugard abolished the caliphate but retained the title *sultan* as a symbolic position in the newly organized Northern Nigeria Protectorate. This remnant became known as \"Sokoto Sultanate Council\". In June 1903, the British defeated the remaining northern forces of Attahiru. By 1906, all resistance to British rule had ended.\n\n\nOn 1 January 1914, the British formally united the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and the Northern Nigeria Protectorate into the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. Administratively, Nigeria remained divided into the Northern and Southern Protectorates and Lagos Colony. Inhabitants of the southern region sustained more interaction, economic and cultural, with the British and other Europeans owing to the coastal economy.[52] Christian missions established Western educational institutions in the protectorates. Under Britain's policy of indirect rule and validation of Islamic legitimist tradition, the Crown did not encourage the operation of Christian missions in the northern, Islamic part of the country.[53] Some children of the southern elite went to Great Britain to pursue higher education.\n\n\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century following World War II, a great wave for independence was sweeping across Africa, in response to the growth of Nigerian nationalism and demands for independence, successive constitutions legislated by the British government moved Nigeria toward self-government on a representative and increasingly federal basis. By the eve of independence in 1960, regional differences in modern educational access were marked. The legacy, though less pronounced, continues to the present day. Imbalances between north and south were expressed in Nigeria's political life as well. For instance, northern Nigeria did not outlaw slavery until 1936 whilst in other parts of Nigeria, slavery was abolished soon after colonialism.[54][46]\n\n![](image)1953 postage stamp with portrait of Queen Elizabeth II\n![](image)Nnamdi Azikwe, first president of Nigeria\n### Independence and federal republic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Federation of Nigeria, First Nigerian Republic, and Independence Day (Nigeria)\n\nNigeria gained a degree of self-rule in 1954, and full independence from the United Kingdom on 1 October 1960, as the Federation of Nigeria with Abubakar Tafawa Balewa as its prime minister, while retaining the British monarch, Elizabeth II, as nominal head of state and Queen of Nigeria. Azikiwe replaced the colonial governor-general in November 1960. At independence, the cultural and political differences were sharp among Nigeria's dominant ethnic groups: the Hausa in the north, Igbo in the east and Yoruba in the west.[55] The Westminster system of government was retained, and thus the President's powers were generally ceremonial.[56] The parliamentary system of government had Abubakar Tafawa Balewa as Prime Minister and Nnamdi Azikiwe as the ceremonial president.\n\n\n\n![](image)Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, prime minister of Nigeria, 1962\nThe founding government was a coalition of conservative parties: the Northern People's Congress led by Sir Ahmadu Bello, a party dominated by Muslim northerners, and the Igbo and Christian-dominated National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons led by Nnamdi Azikiwe. The opposition consisted of the comparatively liberal Action Group, which was largely dominated by the Yoruba and led by Obafemi Awolowo. An imbalance was created in the polity as the result of the 1961 plebiscite. Southern Cameroons opted to join the Republic of Cameroon while Northern Cameroons chose to join Nigeria. The northern part of the country became larger than the southern part.\n\n\n\n### Fall of the First Republic and Civil War[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 1966 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat, 1966 Nigerian counter-coup, and Nigerian Civil War\n\nThe disequilibrium and perceived corruption of the electoral and political process led to two military coups in 1966. The first coup was in January 1966 and was led mostly by soldiers under Majors Emmanuel Ifeajuna (of the Igbo tribe), Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu (Northerner of Eastern extraction) and Adewale Ademoyega (a Yoruba from the West). The coup plotters succeeded in assassinating Sir Ahmadu Bello and Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa alongside prominent leaders of the Northern Region and also Premier Samuel Akintola of the Western Region, but the coup plotters struggled to form a central government. Senate President Nwafor Orizu handed over government control to the Army, under the command of another Igbo officer, Major General[57] Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi. Later, the counter-coup of 1966, supported primarily by Northern military officers, facilitated the rise of Yakubu Gowon as military head of state. Tension rose between north and south; Igbos in northern cities suffered persecution and many fled to the Eastern Region.[58]\n\n![](image)The Republic of Biafra in June 1967, when it declared its independence from the rest of Nigeria\nIn May 1967, Governor of the Eastern Region Lt. Colonel Emeka Ojukwu declared the region independent from the federation as a state called the Republic of Biafra, as a result of the continuous and systematically planned attacks against Igbos and those of Eastern extraction popularly known as 1966 pogroms.[59][60] This declaration precipitated the Nigerian Civil War, which began as the official Nigerian government side attacked Biafra on 6 July 1967, at Garkem. The 30-month war, with a long blockade of Biafra and its isolation from trade and international relief, ended in January 1970.[61] Estimates of the number of dead in the former Eastern Region during the 30-month civil war range from one to three million.[62] France, Egypt, the Soviet Union, Britain, Israel, and others were deeply involved in the civil war behind the scenes. Britain and the Soviet Union were the main military backers of the Nigerian government, with Nigeria utilizing air support from Egyptian pilots provided by Gamal Abdel Nasser,[63][64] while France and Israel aided the Biafrans. The Congolese government, under President Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu, took an early stand on the Biafran secession, voicing strong support for the Nigerian federal government[65] and deploying thousands of troops to fight against the secessionists.[66][67]\n\n\nFollowing the war, Nigeria enjoyed an oil boom in the 1970s, during which the country joined OPEC and received huge oil revenues. Despite these revenues, the military government did little to improve the standard of living of the population, help small and medium businesses, or invest in infrastructure. As oil revenues fuelled the rise of federal subsidies to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)Yakubu Gowon, civil war national leader of Nigeria\nThe coup in July 1975, led by Generals Shehu Musa Yar'Adua and Joseph Garba, ousted Gowon,[69] who fled to Britain.[70] The coup plotters wanted to replace Gowon's autocratic rule with a triumvirate of three brigadier generals whose decisions could be vetoed by a Supreme Military Council. For this triumvirate, they convinced General Murtala Muhammed to become military head of state, with General Olusegun Obasanjo as his second-in-command, and General Theophilus Danjuma as the third.[71] Together, the triumvirate introduced austerity measures to stem inflation, established a Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, replaced all military governors with new officers, and launched \"Operation Deadwood\" through which they fired 11,000 officials from the civil service.[72]\n\n\nColonel Buka Suka Dimka launched a February 1976 coup attempt,[73] during which General Murtala Muhammed was assassinated. Dimka lacked widespread support among the military, and his coup failed, forcing him to flee.[74] After the coup attempt, General Olusegun Obasanjo was appointed military head of state.[75] As head of state, Obasanjo vowed to continue Murtala's policies.[76] Aware of the danger of alienating northern Nigerians, Obasanjo brought General Shehu Yar'Adua as his replacement and second-in-command as Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters completing the military triumvirate, with Obasanjo as head of state and General Theophilus Danjuma as Chief of Army Staff, the three went on to re-establish control over the military regime and organized the military's transfer of power programme: states creation and national delimitation, local government reforms and the constitutional drafting committee for a new republic.[77]\n\n\n\n### Second Republic and military dictatorship[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Second Nigerian Republic and Military dictatorship in Nigeria\n\n![](image)Flag of the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, 1979\nThe military carefully planned the return to civilian rule putting in place measures to ensure that political parties had broader support than witnessed during the first republic. In 1979, five political parties competed in a series of elections in which Alhaji Shehu Shagari of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) was elected president. All five parties won representation in the National Assembly. On 1 October 1979, Shehu Shagari was sworn in as the first President and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Obasanjo peacefully transferred power to Shagari, becoming the first head of state in Nigerian history to willingly step down.\n\n![](image)Shehu Shagari was the first elected President of Nigeria from 1979 to 1983.The Shagari government became viewed as corrupt by virtually all sectors of Nigerian society. In 1983, the inspectors of the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation began to notice \"the slow poisoning of the waters of this country\".[78] In August 1983, Shagari and the NPN were returned to power in a landslide victory, with a majority of seats in the National Assembly and control of 12 state governments. But the elections were marred by violence, and allegations of widespread vote-rigging and electoral malfeasance led to legal battles over the results. There were also uncertainties, such as in the first republic, that political leaders may be unable to govern properly.\n\n\nThe 1983 military coup d'\u00e9tat took place on New Year's Eve of that year. It was coordinated by key officers of the Nigerian military and led to the overthrow of the government and the installation of Major General Muhammadu Buhari as head of state. The military coup of Muhammadu Buhari shortly after the regime's re-election in 1984 was generally viewed as a positive development.[79] In 1985, Ibrahim Babangida overthrew Buhari in a coup d'\u00e9tat. In 1986, Babangida established the Nigerian Political Bureau which made recommendations for the transition to the Third Nigerian Republic. In 1989, Babangida started making plans for the transition to the Third Nigerian Republic. Babangida survived the 1990 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt, then postponed a promised return to democracy to 1992.[80]\n\n\n\n### June 12 and the crisis of the Third Republic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Third Nigerian Republic and 1993 Nigerian presidential election\n\n![](image)Moshood Abiola, Hope campaign poster in 1993\nBabangida legalized the formation of political parties and formed the two-party system with the Social Democratic Party and National Republican Convention ahead of the 1992 general elections. He urged all Nigerians to join either of the parties, which Chief Bola Ige referred to as \"two leper hands\". The two-party state had been a Political Bureau recommendation. After a census was conducted, the National Electoral Commission announced on 24 January 1992, that both legislative elections to a bicameral National Assembly and a presidential election would be held later that year. The adopted process advocated that any candidate needed to pass through adoption for all elective positions from the local government, state government and federal government.[81]\n\n\nThe 1993 presidential election held on 12 June, was the first since the military coup of 1983. The results, though not officially declared by the National Electoral Commission, showed the duo of Moshood Abiola and Baba Gana Kingibe of the Social Democratic Party defeated Bashir Tofa and Sylvester Ugoh of the National Republican Convention by over 2.3\u00a0million votes. However, Babangida annulled the elections, leading to massive civilian protests that effectively shut down the country for weeks. In August 1993, Babangida finally kept his promise to relinquish power to a civilian government but not before appointing Ernest Shonekan head of an interim national government.[82] Babangida's regime has been considered the most corrupt and responsible for creating a culture of corruption in Nigeria.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Abdulsalami Abubakar, military ruler in 1998 saw the return to democracy in 1999\nShonekan's interim government, the shortest in the political history of the country, was overthrown in a coup d'\u00e9tat of 1993 led by General Sani Abacha, who used military force on a wide scale to suppress the continuing civilian unrest. In 1995, the government hanged environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa on trumped-up charges in the deaths of four Ogoni elders, which caused Nigerian's suspension from the Commonwealth. Lawsuits under the American Alien Tort Statute against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of Shell's Nigerian operation, settled out of court with Shell continuing to deny liability.[84] Several hundred million dollars in accounts traced to Abacha were discovered in 1999.[85] The regime came to an end in 1998 when the dictator died in the villa. He looted money to offshore accounts in western European banks and defeated coup plots by arresting and bribing generals and politicians. His successor, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, adopted a new constitution on 5 May 1999, which provided for multiparty elections.\n\n\n\n### Return to democracy (1999\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fourth Nigerian Republic\n\n![](image)Olusegun Obasanjo served as president of Nigeria from 1999 to 2007.\nOn 29 May 1999, Abubakar handed over power to the winner of the 1999 presidential election, former military ruler General Olusegun Obasanjo, as President of Nigeria. Obasanjo had been in prison under the dictatorship of Abacha. Obasanjo's inauguration heralded the beginning of the Fourth Nigerian Republic,[86] ending a 39-year period of short-lived democracies, civil war and military dictatorship. Although the elections that brought Obasanjo to power and allowed him to run for a second term in the 2003 presidential elections were condemned as unfree and unfair, Nigeria made significant progress in democratisation under Obasanjo.[87] The fact that parliament was able to successfully deny the president a third term in office, despite his influence on the army and security forces, is evidence of the strengthened parliamentarism in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n![](image)Goodluck Jonathan in a handshake with his successor, Buhari at the inauguration in 2015\nIn the 2007 general elections, Umaru Yar'Adua of the People's Democratic Party came to power. The international community, which had observed the Nigerian elections to promote a free and fair process, condemned these elections as seriously flawed.[88] Obasanjo acknowledged fraud and other \"shortcomings\" in the elections, but said the result was in line with opinion polls. In a nationally televised address in 2007, he added that if Nigerians did not like the victory of his handpicked successor, they had the option of voting again in four years' time.[89] Yar'Adua died on 5 May 2010, and Vice President Goodluck Jonathan had been sworn in by the Senate three months earlier as acting president to succeed Yar'Adua.[90][91] Jonathan won the 2011 presidential election, unlike previous elections, the polls went smoothly and with relatively little violence or electoral fraud.[92] Jonathan's tenure saw an economic recovery that made Nigeria the leading economic power in Africa.[93][94] The Jonathan admininistration also saw an increase in unparalleled corruption, with as many as 20 billion US dollars said to have been lost to the Nigerian state through the national oil company. Above all, however, Jonathan's tenure saw the emergence of a wave of terror by the Boko Haram insurgency, such as the Gwoza massacre and Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping in 2014.[95]\n\n\n\n![](image)Muhammadu Buhari was president of Nigeria, serving from 2015 to 2023.\nAhead of the general election of 2015, a merger of the biggest opposition parties in Nigeria \u2013 the Action Congress of Nigeria, the Congress for Progressive Change, the All Nigeria Peoples Party, a faction of the All Progressives Grand Alliance and the new PDP (a faction of serving governors of the ruling People's Democratic Party) \u2013 formed the All Progressives Congress led by current president Bola Ahmed Tinubu. At the time, it was the most expensive election ever to be held on the African continent (being surpassed only by the elections of 2019 and 2023). The new mega-opposition party chose as their candidate for the election, former military dictator Muhammadu Buhari\u2014who had previously contested in the 2003, 2007, and 2011 presidential elections. Buhari's campaign in 2015 was popular and built around his image as a staunch anti-corruption fighter and his incorruptible and charismatic honest reputation, he pledged not to probe past corrupt leaders and would give officials who stole public funds in the past amnesty if they repented \u2014he won the election by over two million votes. Jonathan in an unprecedented presidential call telephoned Buhari to concede and congratulate him on his election victory. Observers generally praised the election as being fair.[96][97][98][99] The election marked the first time an incumbent president had lost re-election in Nigeria. In the 2019 presidential election, Buhari was re-elected for a second term in office defeating his closest rival Atiku Abubakar.[100]\n\n\n\nFor the first time since the elections of the Second Republic, four candidates vied for the presidency in the February 2023 presidential election: Bola Tinubu leader of the progressive ruling party the All Progressives Congress, Atiku Abubakar of the conservative People's Democratic Party, Peter Obi of the Labour Party and Kwankwaso of the far-left New Nigeria Peoples Party. Moreover, for the first time since the return of democracy, no former military ruler ran for president, marking a strengthening of democracy and faith in the multiparty constitution as well as heralding the transition to a new-savvy democratic class of politicians. The election also saw the rise of metonymic supporters of the new candidates, the Obidient movement of Peter Obi, previously governor of Anambra State, widely appealed to young, urban voters and has his core base in the Southeast;[101] and the Kwankwassiya of Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, former governor of Kano State in the Northwest.[102]\n\n![](image)Chief Bola Tinubu is currently serving as President of Nigeria since 29 May 2023.Bola Tinubu of the ruling party, won the disputed election with 36.61% of the vote, 8,794,726 total votes.[103] Runners-up were former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Peoples Democratic Party, and former Governor of Anambra State Peter Obi, Labour Party, who both immediately contested the result;[104] however both runner-ups claimed victory and litigation is ongoing in an election tribunal. Other federal elections, including elections to the House of Representatives and the Senate, held on the same date while state elections were scheduled to hold two weeks afterward on 11 March, but were postponed by a week and was held on 18 March.[105] Bola Tinubu's inauguration was held on 29 May 2023 and Bola Tinubu was sworn in as Nigeria\u2019s president to succeed Buhari.[106]\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Nigeria, Geology of Nigeria, and Wildlife of Nigeria\n\n![](image)Topography of Nigeria\nNigeria is located in western Africa on the Gulf of Guinea and has a total area of 923,768\u00a0km2 (356,669\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[107] making it the world's 32nd-largest country. Its borders span 4,047 kilometres (2,515\u00a0mi), and it shares borders with Benin (773\u00a0km or 480\u00a0mi), Niger (1,497\u00a0km or 930\u00a0mi), Chad (87\u00a0km or 54\u00a0mi), and Cameroon (including the separatist Ambazonia) 1,690\u00a0km or 1,050\u00a0mi. Its coastline is at least 853\u00a0km (530\u00a0mi).[108] Nigeria lies between latitudes 4\u00b0 and 14\u00b0N, and longitudes 2\u00b0 and 15\u00b0E. The highest point in Nigeria is Chappal Waddi at 2,419\u00a0m (7,936\u00a0ft). The main rivers are the Niger and the Benue, which converge and empty into the Niger Delta. This is one of the world's largest river deltas and the location of a large area of Central African mangroves.\n\n\nNigeria's most expansive topographical region is that of the valleys of the Niger and Benue river valleys (which merge and form a Y-shape).[109] To the southwest of the Niger is a \"rugged\" highland. To the southeast of the Benue are hills and mountains, which form the Mambilla Plateau, the highest plateau in Nigeria. This plateau extends through the border with Cameroon, where the montane land is part of the Bamenda Highlands of Cameroon.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Climate map of Nigeria\nNigeria has a varied landscape. The far south is defined by its tropical rainforest climate, where annual rainfall is 1,500 to 2,000 millimetres (60 to 80\u00a0in) per year.[110] In the southeast stands the Obudu Plateau. Coastal plains are found in both the southwest and the southeast.[109] Mangrove swamps are found along the coast.[111]\n\n\nThe area near the border with Cameroon close to the coast is rich rainforest and part of the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests ecoregion, an important centre for biodiversity. It is a habitat for the drill primate, which is found in the wild only in this area and across the border in Cameroon. The areas surrounding Calabar, Cross River State, also in this forest, are believed to contain the world's largest diversity of butterflies. The area of southern Nigeria between the Niger and the Cross Rivers has lost most of its forest because of development and harvesting by increased population, and has been replaced by grassland.\n\n\n\nEverything in between the far south and the far north is savannah (insignificant tree cover, with grasses and flowers located between trees). Rainfall is more limited to between 500 and 1,500 millimetres (20 and 60\u00a0in) per year.[110] The savannah zone's three categories are Guinean forest-savanna mosaic, Sudan savannah, and Sahel savannah. Guinean forest-savanna mosaic is plains of tall grass interrupted by trees. Sudan savannah is similar but with shorter grasses and shorter trees. Sahel savannah consists of patches of grass and sand, found in the northeast.[111]\n\n![](image)Shrinking of Lake Chad in north-eastern Nigeria, with the outline of the British Isles for size comparison\n### Hydrology[edit]\n\n\nNigeria is divided into two main catchment areas - that of Lake Chad and that of the Niger. The Niger catchment area covers about 63% of the country. The main tributary of the Niger is the Benue, whose tributaries extend beyond Cameroon into Cameroon into Chad and the Sharie catchment area. In the Sahel region, rain is less than 500 millimetres (20\u00a0in) per year, and the Sahara Desert is encroaching.[110] In the dry northeast corner of the country lies Lake Chad, on a shared water boundary delimitation with Niger, Chad and Cameroon.\n\n\nThe Chad Basin is fed from the north-eastern quarter of Nigeria. The Bauchi Plateau forms the watershed between the Niger/Benue and Komadugu Yobe river systems. The flat plains of north-eastern Nigeria are geographically part of the Chad Basin, where the course of the El Beid River forms the border with Cameroon, from the Mandara Mountains to Lake Chad. The Komadugu Yobe river system gives rise to the internationally important Hadejia-Nguru wetlands and Ox-bow lakes around Lake Nguru in the rainy season.[112][113] Other rivers of the northeast include the Ngadda and the Yedseram, both of which flow through the Sambisa swamps, thus forming a river system. The river system of the northeast is also a major river system.[114] In addition, Nigeria has numerous coastal rivers.\n\n\n\n![](image)Photo of Lake Chad from Apollo 7, 1968\nLake Chad in the far north-east of Nigeria has had a chequered history over the last million years, drying up several times for a few thousand years and just as often growing to many times its current size. In recent decades its surface area has been reduced considerably, which may also be due to humans taking water from the inlets to irrigate agricultural land.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Obudu mountains in the southern region of Nigeria\n### Vegetation[edit]\n\n\nNigeria is covered by three types of vegetation: forests (where there is significant tree cover), savannahs (insignificant tree cover, with grasses and flowers located between trees), and montane land (least common and mainly found in the mountains near the Cameroon border. Both the forest zone and the savannah zone are divided into three parts.[115]\n\n\nSome of the forest zone's most southerly portion, especially around the Niger River and Cross River deltas, is mangrove swamp. North of this is fresh water swamp, containing different vegetation from the salt water mangrove swamps, and north of that is rain forest.[115]\n\n\nThe savannah zone's three categories are divided into Guinean forest-savanna mosaic, made up of plains of tall grass which are interrupted by trees, the most common across the country; Sudan savannah, with short grasses and short trees; and Sahel savannah patches of grass and sand, found in the northeast.[115]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Mambilla Plateau in the North-Eastern region of Nigeria\n### Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Deforestation in Nigeria and Environmental issues in the Niger Delta\n\n![Nigerian deforrestation 1981 - 2020](image)Deforestation in Nigeria 1981\u20132020[116]\nWaste management including sewage treatment, the linked processes of deforestation and soil degradation, and climate change or global warming are the major environmental problems in Nigeria. Waste management presents problems in a megacity like Lagos and other major Nigerian cities which are linked with economic development, population growth and the inability of municipal councils to manage the resulting rise in industrial and domestic waste. This waste management problem is also attributable to unsustainable environmental management lifestyles of Kubwa community in the Federal Capital Territory, where there are habits of indiscriminate disposal of waste, dumping of waste along or into the canals, sewerage systems that are channels for water flows, and the like. Haphazard industrial planning, increased urbanisation, poverty and lack of competence of the municipal government are seen as the major reasons for high levels of waste pollution in major cities of the country. Some of the solutions have been disastrous to the environment, resulting in untreated waste being dumped in places where it can pollute waterways and groundwater.[117]\n\n\nIn 2005, Nigeria had the highest rate of deforestation in the world, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.[118] That year, 12.2%, the equivalent of 11,089,000 hectares, had been forested in the country. Between 1990 and 2000, Nigeria lost an average of 409,700 hectares of forest every year equal to an average annual deforestation rate of 2.4%. Between 1990 and 2005, in total Nigeria lost 35.7% of its forest cover or around 6,145,000 hectares.[119] Nigeria had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.2/10, ranking it 82nd globally out of 172 countries.[120]\n\n\nIn the year 2010, thousands of people were inadvertently exposed to lead-containing soil from informal gold mining within the northern state of Zamfara. While estimates vary, it is thought that upwards of 400 children died of acute lead poisoning, making this perhaps the largest lead poisoning fatality outbreak ever encountered.[121]\n\n\nNigeria's Delta region is one of the most polluted regions in the world due to serious oil spills and other environmental problems caused by its oil industry.[122][123] The heavy contamination of the air, ground and water with toxic pollutants is often used as an example of ecocide.[124][125][126][127][128] In additional to the environmental damage it has caused conflict in the Delta region.\n\n\nIllegal oil refineries, in which local operators convert stolen crude oil into petrol and diesel, are considered particularly \"dirty, dangerous and lucrative\".[129] Safety and environmental aspects are usually ignored (e.g. no sulphur is removed from the fuels produced). Refining petroleum also inevitably produces heavy oil, which is \"cracked\" into lighter fuel components in regular plants at great technical expense. Illegal refineries do not have these technical possibilities and \"dispose\" of the heavy oil where it accumulates. The lighter components of crude oil (methane to butane, isobutane), on the other hand, always mean a certain risk of explosion, which often leads to disasters at illegal plants.[130] In 2022, Nigeria suffered 125 deaths from explosions at local, illegal refineries.[131]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Nigeria and Political parties in Nigeria\n\n### Government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Coat of arms of Nigeria in current use\n![](image)The National Assembly Complex in the capital Abuja, with the Senate located on the left and backdrop of Aso Rock\nNigeria is a federal republic modelled after the United States,[132] with 36 states and capital Abuja as an independent unit. The executive power is exercised by the President. The president is both head of state and head of the federal government; the president is elected by popular vote to a maximum of two four-year terms.[133] State governors, like the president, are elected for four years and may serve a maximum of two terms. The president's power is checked by a Senate and a House of Representatives, which are combined in a bicameral body called the National Assembly. The Senate is a 109-seat body with three members from each state and one from the capital region of Abuja; members are elected by popular vote to four-year terms. The House contains 360 seats, with the number of seats per state determined by population.[133]\n\n\nThe Nigerian president is elected in a modified two-round system. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive a relative majority of the votes and more than 25% of the votes in at least 24 of the 36 states.[134] If no candidate reaches this hurdle, a second round of voting takes place between the leading candidate and the next candidate who received the majority of votes in the highest number of states. Presidential candidates take a \"running mate\" (candidate for the vice-presidency) who is both ethnically and religiously the opposite of themselves: a Christian candidate from the South will choose a Muslim running mate from the North - and vice versa. There is no law prescribing this, yet all presidential candidates since the existence of the Fourth Republic have adhered to this rule.\n\n\nHowever, this principle of religious and ethnic diversity in leadership was ignored in the 2023 General Elections, where the candidate for the All Progressives Congress, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a Muslim, selected another Muslim, Senator Kashim Shettima, as running mate.\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Subdivisions of Nigeria\n\n![](image)Map of Nigeria with administrative divisionsNigeria is divided into thirty-six states and one Federal Capital Territory, which are further sub-divided into 774 local government areas. In some contexts, the states are aggregated into six geopolitical zones: North West, North East, North Central, South West, South East, and South South.[135][136]\n\n\nNigeria has five cities with a population of over a million (from largest to smallest): Lagos, Kano, Ibadan, Benin City and Port Harcourt. Lagos is the largest city in Africa, with a population of over 12 million in its urban area.[137]\n\n\nThe south of the country in particular is characterised by very strong urbanisation and a relatively large number of cities. According to an estimate from 2015,[138] there are 20 cities in Nigeria with more than 500,000 inhabitants, including ten cities with a population of one million.\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of Nigeria\n\nThe Constitution of Nigeria is the supreme law of the country. There are four distinct legal systems in Nigeria, which include English law, common law, customary law, and Sharia law:\n\n\n\n* English law in Nigeria consists of the collection of British laws from colonial times.\n* Common law is the collection of authoritative judicial decisions in the field of civil law (so-called precedents) that have been handed down in the country concerned - in this case Nigeria. (This system is mainly found in Anglo-Saxon countries; in continental Europe, on the other hand, codified and, as far as possible, abstracted civil law predominates, as in the Napoleonic Code in France).[139]\n* Customary law is derived from indigenous traditional norms and practices, including the dispute resolution meetings of pre-colonial Yoruba land secret societies and the \u00c8kp\u00e8 and Ok\u00f3nk\u00f2 of Igboland and Ibibioland.[140]\n* Sharia law *(also known as Islamic Law)* used to be used only in Northern Nigeria, where Islam is the predominant religion. It is also being used in Lagos State, Oyo State, Kwara State, Ogun State, and Osun State by Muslims. Muslim penal codes are not the same in every state and they differentiate in punishment and offences according to religious affiliation (for example, alcohol consumption and distribution).\n\n\nThe country has a judicial branch, the highest court of which is the Supreme Court of Nigeria.[141]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Nigeria\n\n![](image)The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Abuja\nUpon gaining independence in 1960, Nigeria made African unity the centrepiece of its foreign policy.[142] One exception to the African focus was Nigeria's close relationship developed with Israel throughout the 1960s. Israel sponsored and oversaw the construction of Nigeria's parliament buildings.[143]\n\n\nNigeria's foreign policy was put to the test in the 1970s after the country emerged united from its civil war. It supported movements against white minority governments in Southern Africa. Nigeria backed the African National Congress by taking a committed tough line about the South African government. Nigeria was a founding member of the Organisation for African Unity (now the African Union) and has tremendous influence in West Africa and Africa on the whole. Nigeria founded regional cooperative efforts in West Africa, functioning as the standard-bearer for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and ECOMOG (especially during the Liberia and Sierra Leone civil wars) - which are economic and military organizations, respectively.\n\n\nWith this Africa-centred stance, Nigeria readily sent troops to the Congo at the behest of the United Nations shortly after independence (and has maintained membership since that time). Nigeria also supported several Pan-African and pro-self government causes in the 1970s, including garnering support for Angola's MPLA, SWAPO in Namibia, and aiding opposition to the minority governments of Portuguese Mozambique, and Rhodesia. Nigeria retains membership in the Non-Aligned Movement. In late November 2006, it organized an Africa-South America Summit in Abuja to promote what some attendees termed \"South-South\" linkages on a variety of fronts.[144] Nigeria is also a member of the International Criminal Court and the Commonwealth of Nations. It was temporarily expelled from the latter in 1995 when ruled by the Abacha regime.\n\n\nNigeria has remained a key player in the international oil industry since the 1970s and maintains membership in OPEC, which it joined in July 1971. Its status as a major petroleum producer figures prominently in its sometimes volatile international relations with developed countries, notably the United States, and with developing countries.[145]\n\n\nSince 2000, Chinese\u2013Nigerian trade relations have risen exponentially. There has been an increase in total trade of over 10,384\u00a0million dollars between the two nations from 2000 to 2016.[146] However, the structure of the Chinese\u2013Nigerian trade relationship has become a major political issue for the Nigerian state. This is illustrated by the fact that Chinese exports account for around 80 per cent of total bilateral trade volumes.[147] This has resulted in a serious trade imbalance, with Nigeria importing ten times more than it exports to China.[148] Subsequently, Nigeria's economy is becoming over-reliant on cheap imports to sustain itself, resulting in a clear decline in Nigerian industry under such arrangements.[149]\n\n\nContinuing its Africa-centred foreign policy, Nigeria introduced the idea of a single currency for West Africa known as the Eco under the presumption that it would be led by the naira. But on 21 December 2019, Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara, Emmanuel Macron, and multiple other UEMOA states announced that they would merely rename the CFA franc instead of replacing the currency as originally intended. As of 2020, the Eco currency has been delayed to 2025.[150]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nigerian Armed Forces\n\n![](image)Nigerian Army self-propelled anti-aircraft gun\nThe Nigerian Armed Forces are the combined military forces of Nigeria. It consists of three uniformed service branches: the Nigerian Army, Nigerian Navy, and Nigerian Air Force. The President of Nigeria functions as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, exercising his constitutional authority through the Ministry of Defence, which is responsible for the management of the military and its personnel. The operational head of the AFN is the Chief of the Defence Staff, who is subordinate to the Nigerian Defence Minister. With a force of more than 223,000 active personnel, the Nigerian military is one of the largest uniformed combat services in Africa.[151]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nigerian Air Force attack helicopter\nNigeria has 143,000 troops in the armed forces (army 100,000, navy 25,000, air force 18,000) and another 80,000 personnel for \"gendarmerie & paramilitary\" in 2020, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.[152] By comparison, Poland has 114,500 troops in armed forces and \"paramilitary\" and Germany 183,500, according to the same source.[152] Nigeria spent just under 0.4 per cent of its economic output, or US$1.6 billion, on its armed forces in 2017.[153][154] For 2022, US$2.26 billion has been budgeted for the Nigerian armed forces, which is just over a third of Belgium's defence budget (US$5.99 billion).[152]\n\n\n\n### Communal and religious conflicts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Communal conflicts in Nigeria, Religious violence in Nigeria, and Nigerian bandit conflict\n\n![](image)Attacks by Boko Haram, 2011 to date (as of October 2022). Each figure represents 1,000 deaths.[155]\nBoko Haram and the bandit conflict have been responsible for numerous serious attacks with thousands of casualties since mid-2010. Since then, according to the Council on Foreign Relations' Nigeria Security Tracker, over 41,600 lives have been lost to this conflict (as of October 2022).[155] The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR counts about 1.8 million internally displaced persons and about 200,000 Nigerian refugees in neighbouring countries who have fled the fighting in northeastern Nigeria.\n\n\nThe Boko Haram-affected states agreed in February 2015 to establish an 8,700-strong Multinational Joint Task Force to jointly fight Boko Haram. By October 2015, Boko Haram had been driven out of all the cities it controlled and almost all the counties in northeastern Nigeria. In 2016, Boko Haram split and in 2022, 40,000 fighters surrendered.[156] The splinter group ISWAP (Islamic State in West Africa) remains active.\n\n\nThe fight against Boko Haram, other sectarians and criminals has been accompanied by increasing police attacks. The Council on Foreign Relations' Nigeria Security Tracker counted 1,086 deaths from Boko Haram attacks and 290 deaths from police violence in the first 12 months of its establishment in May 2011. In the 12 months after October 2021, 2,193 people died from police violence and 498 from Boko Haram and ISWAP,[155] according to the NST. The Nigerian police are notorious for vigilante justice.[155]\n\n\nThe Niger Delta saw intense attacks on oil infrastructure in 2016 by militant groups such as the *Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta* (MEND), the *Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force* (NDPVF), the *Ijaw National Congress* (INC) and the *Pan Niger Delta Forum* (PANDEF). In response, the new Buhari government pursued a dual strategy of repression and negotiation.\n\n\nIn late 2016, the Nigerian federal government resorted to the gambit of offering the militant groups a 4.5 billion naira (US$144 million) contract to *guard* oil infrastructure. Most accepted. The contract was renewed in August 2022, but led to fierce disputes among the above-mentioned groups over the distribution of the funds. Representatives speak of \"war\"[157] - against each other. The high propensity for violence and the pettiness of the leaders, as well as the complete absence of social and environmental arguments in this dispute[157] give rise to fears that the militant groups, despite their lofty names, have discarded responsibility for their region and ethnic groups and have moved into the realm of protection rackets and self-enrichment. In any case, the pipelines in the Niger Delta are not very effectively \"guarded\" - the pollution of the Niger Delta with stolen crude oil and illegally produced heavy fuel oil continued unhindered after 2016.[158]\n\n\nIn central Nigeria, conflicts between Muslim Hausa-Fulani herders and indigenous Christian farmers flared up again, especially in Kaduna, Plateau, Taraba and Benue states. In individual cases, these clashes have claimed several hundred lives. Conflict over land and resources is increasing due to the ongoing desertification in northern Nigeria, population growth and the generally tense economic situation.\n\n\nIn June 2022, a massacre took place in the St. Francis Xavier Church, in Owo. The Government blamed ISWAP for the murder of over 50 parishioners, but locals suspect Fulani herdsmen involvement.[159]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Nigeria\n\n![](image)GDP per capita in West Africa, 2019[160] ![](image)A proportional representation of Nigeria exports, 2019\nNigeria's economy is the largest in Africa, the 31st-largest in the world by nominal GDP, and 30th-largest by PPP. GDP (PPP) per capita is US$9,148[161] (as of 2022), which is less than South Africa, Egypt or Morocco, but a little more than Ghana or Ivory Coast.\n\n\nNigeria is a leader in Africa as an energy power, financial market, in pharmaceuticals and in the entertainment industry. Next to petroleum, the second-largest source of foreign exchange earnings for Nigeria are remittances sent home by Nigerians living abroad.[162]\n\n\nNigeria has a highly developed financial services sector, with a mix of local and international banks, asset management companies, brokerage houses, insurance companies and brokers, private equity funds and investment banks.[163]\n\n\nNigeria has a lower-middle-income economy[164] with an abundant supply of natural resources. Its wide array of underexploited mineral resources include coal, bauxite, tantalite, gold, tin, iron ore, limestone, niobium, lead and zinc.[165] Despite huge deposits of these natural resources, the mining industry in Nigeria is still in its infancy.\n\n\nBefore 1999, economic development has been hindered by years of military rule, corruption, and mismanagement. The restoration of democracy and subsequent economic reforms have successfully put Nigeria back on track towards achieving its full economic potential.\n\n\nAfter 2015, the Nigerian economy was able to diversify somewhat. Apart from oil and gas, Nigeria exports fertilisers and cement/cement board, moulded polypropylene (plastic) products, personal care products, paint, malt beverages and armoured vehicles.\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Agriculture in Nigeria\n\n![](image)Nigerian palm nuts put out to dry\nIn 2021, about 23.4% of Nigeria's GDP is contributed by agriculture, forestry and fishing combined.[166] As far as cassava is concerned, Nigeria is the world's largest producer.[167] Further major crops include maize, rice, millet, yam beans, and guinea corn (sorghum).[168] Cocoa is the principal agricultural export, and one of the country's most significant non-petroleum products.[169][170] Nigeria is also one of the world's top twenty exporters of natural rubber, generating $20.9 million in 2019.[171]\n\n\nBefore the Nigerian Civil War and the oil boom, Nigeria was self-sufficient in food.[172][173][174] Agriculture used to be the principal foreign exchange earner of Nigeria.[175] Agriculture has failed to keep pace with Nigeria's rapid population growth, and Nigeria now relies upon food imports to sustain itself.[173][176] It spends US$6.7 billion yearly for food imports, four times more than revenues from food export.[167] The Nigerian government promoted the use of inorganic fertilizers in the 1970s.[177]\n\n\nNigeria's rice production increased by 10% from 2017/18 to 2021/22 to 5 million tonnes a year,[178] but could hardly keep up with the increased demand. Rice imports therefore remained constant at 2 million tonnes per year. In August 2019, Nigeria closed its border with Benin and other neighbouring countries to stop rice smuggling into the country as part of efforts to boost local production.[179]\n\n\nUntil now, Nigeria exported unhusked rice but had to import husked rice, the country's staple food. - The rice mill in Imota, near Lagos, is intended to handle the corresponding processing at home, improve the balance of trade and the labour market, and save unnecessary costs for transport and middlemen. When fully operational at the end of 2022, the plant, the largest south of the Sahara, is expected to employ 250,000 people and produce 2.5 million 50-kg bags of rice annually.[180]\n\n\n\n### Oil and natural gas[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Petroleum industry in Nigeria and Oil theft in Nigeria\n\nFile:Nigeria-oil-n-gas.jpgOil and gas fields in the Niger delta\nNigeria is the 15th largest producer of petroleum in the world, the 6th largest exporter, and has the 9th largest proven reserves. Petroleum plays a large role in the Nigerian economy and politics, accounting for about 80% of government earnings. Nigeria also has the 9th largest proven natural gas reserves estimated by OPEC; the government's value of its about 206.53 trillion cubic feet has been valued at $803.4 trillion.[181] Natural gas is seen as having the potential to unlock an economic miracle on the Niger River.[182] Nigeria each year loses to gas flaring an estimate of US$2.5 billion,[183] and over 120,000 barrels of oil per day to crude theft in the Niger Delta, its main oil-producing region.[184][185] This has led to piracy and conflict for control in the region and has led to disruptions in production preventing the country from meeting its OPEC quota and exporting petroleum at full capability.[186]\n\n\n\n![](image)Overflight photo of the creeks of the Niger Delta\nNigeria has a total of 159 oil fields and 1,481 wells in operation according to the Department of Petroleum Resources.[187] The most productive region of the nation is the coastal Niger Delta Basin in the Niger Delta or \"south-south\" region which encompasses 78 of the 159 oil fields. Most of Nigeria's oil fields are small and scattered, and as of 1990, these small fields accounted for 62.1% of all Nigerian production. This contrasts with the sixteen largest fields which produced 37.9% of Nigeria's petroleum at that time.[188] Petrol was Nigeria's main import commodity until 2021, accounting for 24% of import volume.[189]\n\n\nThe Niger Delta Nembe Creek oil field was discovered in 1973 and produces from middle Miocene deltaic sandstone-shale in an anticline structural trap at a depth of 2 to 4 kilometres (7,000 to 13,000 feet).[190] In June 2013, Shell announced a strategic review of its operations in Nigeria, hinting that assets could be divested. While many international oil companies have operated there for decades, by 2014 most were making moves to divest their interests, citing a range of issues including oil theft. In August 2014, Shell said it was finalising its interests in four Nigerian oil fields.[191]\n\n\nThe supply of natural gas to Europe, threatened by the Ukraine war, is pushing projects to transport Nigerian natural gas via pipelines to Morocco or Algeria.[192][193][194] As of May 2022, however, there are no results on this yet.\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Nigeria\n\n![](image)Kainji Dam on the Niger River, built in the 1960s\nNigeria's energy consumption is much more than its generation capacity. Most of the energy comes from traditional fossil fuel, which account for 73% of total primary production. The rest is from hydropower (27%). Since independence, Nigeria has tried to develop a domestic nuclear industry for energy. Nigeria opened in 2004 a Chinese-origin research reactor at Ahmadu Bello University and has sought the support of the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop plans for up to 4,000 MWe of nuclear capacity by 2027 according to the National Program for the Deployment of Nuclear Power for Generation of Electricity. In 2007, President Umaru Yar'Adua urged the country to embrace nuclear power to meet its growing energy needs. In 2017, Nigeria signed the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[195] In April 2015, Nigeria began talks with Russia's state-owned Rosatom to collaborate on the design, construction and operation of four nuclear power plants by 2035, the first of which will be in operation by 2025. In June 2015, Nigeria selected two sites for the planned construction of the nuclear plants. Neither the Nigerian government nor Rosatom would disclose the specific locations of the sites, but it is believed that the nuclear plants will be sited in Akwa Ibom State and Kogi State. The sites are planned to house two plants each. In 2017 agreements were signed for the construction of the Itu nuclear power plant.\n\n\n\n#### Electricity[edit]\n\n\n94% of Nigerians are connected to the national grid, according to the survey, but only 57% have their electricity consumption recorded by an electricity meter.[196] Only 1% of Nigerians surveyed reported having electricity 24 hours a day. 68% have electricity 1 to 9 hours a day, according to the NIO. 66% of Nigerians pay up to 10,000 Naira (13 USD) a month for electricity, which is almost 3% of the average income in Nigeria.[196] 67% of respondents were willing to pay more for uninterrupted electricity supply. 21% own a power generator, 14% of Nigerians use solar energy.[196]\n\n\n\n### Manufacturing and technology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Automotive industry in Nigeria and Pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria\n\n![](image)Nigeria EduSat-1, the first satellite built by Nigeria by the Federal University of Technology Akure\nNigeria has a manufacturing industry that includes leather and textiles (centred in Kano, Abeokuta, Onitsha, and Lagos), plastics and processed food. Ogun is considered to be Nigeria's current industrial hub, as most factories are located in Ogun and more companies are moving there, followed by Lagos.[197][198][199] The city of Aba in the south-eastern part of the country is well known for handicrafts and shoes, known as \"Aba made\".[200] Nigeria has a market of 720,000 cars per year, but less than 20% of these are produced domestically.[201]\n\n\nIn 2016 (the last year from which data is available), Nigeria was the leading cement producer south of the Sahara, ahead of South Africa.[202] Aliko Dangote, Nigeria's richest inhabitant, based his wealth on cement production, as well as agricultural commodities.[203] According to its own information, the Ajaokuta Steel Company Limited produces 1.3 million tonnes of steel per year.[204] This would be equivalent to one-sixth of the United Kingdom's steel production in 2021.[205] However, steel plants in Katsina, Jos and Osogbo no longer appear to be active.[206]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Nigeria EduSat-1 was deployed from the International Space Station. It is the first satellite that was built in Nigeria, which followed many other Nigerian satellites that was built by other countries.[b][207] In 2021, Nigeria hosts about 60 percent of the pharmaceutical production capacity in Africa,[208] the larger pharmaceutical companies are located in Lagos.[209] The pharmaceutical producer with the most employees in Nigeria is Emzor Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.[210] Nigeria has a few electronic manufacturers like Zinox, the first branded Nigerian computer, and manufacturers of electronic gadgets such as tablet PCs.[211] As of January 2022, Nigeria is the host 5 out of the 7 unicorn companies in Africa.[212]\n\n\n\n### Internet and telecommunications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nigerian librarians editing the Wikidata database Nigerian telecommunications market is one of the fastest-growing in the world, with major emerging market operators (like MTN, 9mobile, Airtel and Globacom) basing their largest and most profitable centres in the country.[213] Nigeria's ICT sector has experienced a lot of growth, representing 10% of the nation's GDP in 2018 as compared to just 1% in 2001.[214] Lagos is regarded as one of the largest technology hubs in Africa with its thriving tech ecosystem.[215] According to a survey by the GSM Association, 92% of adult Nigerian men and 88% of women owned a mobile phone.[216] Using various measures including but not limited to Illegal arrest, taking down of websites, passport seizures, and restricted access to bank accounts, the Nigerian government is punishing citizens for expressing themselves on the internet and working to stifle internet freedom.[217]\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Nigeria\n\n![](image)\u00d2w\u00fa waterfalls, visited by Nigerian undergraduates\nTourism in Nigeria centres largely on events, because of the country's ample amount of ethnic groups, but also includes rain forests, savannah, waterfalls, and other natural attractions.[218]\nAbuja is home to several parks and green areas. The largest, Millennium Park, was designed by architect Manfredi Nicoletti and officially opened in December 2003. After the re-modernization project achieved by the administration of Governor Raji Babatunde Fashola, Lagos is gradually becoming a major tourist destination. Lagos is currently taking steps to become a global city. The 2009 Eyo carnival (a yearly festival originating from Iperu Remo, Ogun State) was a step toward world city status. Currently, Lagos is primarily known as a business-oriented and fast-paced community.[219] Lagos has become an important location for African and black cultural identity.[220]\n\n\nLagos has sandy beaches by the Atlantic Ocean, including Elegushi Beach and Alpha Beach. Lagos also has many private beach resorts including Inagbe Grand Beach Resort and several others in the outskirts. Lagos has a variety of hotels ranging from three-star to five-star hotels, with a mixture of local hotels such as Eko Hotels and Suites, Federal Palace Hotel and franchises of multinational chains such as Intercontinental Hotel, Sheraton, and Four Points by Sheraton. Other places of interest include the Tafawa Balewa Square, Festac town, The Nike Art Gallery, Freedom Park, and the Cathedral Church of Christ.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Nigeria\n\nDue to Nigeria's location in the centre of West Africa, transport plays a major role in the national service sector. The government investments has seen an increase in extensive road repairs and new construction have been carried out gradually as states in particular spend their share of increased government allocations. Representative of these improvements is the Second Niger Bridge near Onitsha, which was largely completed in 2022.[221] A 2017 World Bank report on logistics hubs in Africa placed the country in fourth place, behind C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Senegal, and Sao Tome,[222] but in 2021, Nigeria joined the World Logistics Passport, a private sector group working to increase the effiency of global trade.[223]\n\n\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roads in Nigeria\n\n![](image)Third Mainland bridge across the Lagos lagoon\nNigeria has the largest road network in West Africa. It covers about 200,000\u00a0km, of which 60,000\u00a0km are asphalted. Nigeria's roads and highways handle 90% of all passenger and freight traffic. It contributes N2.4trn ($6.4bn) to GDP in 2020. 35,000\u00a0km of the road network fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government. The motorway links of important economic centres such as Lagos-Ibadan, Lagos-Badagry and Enugu-Onitsha have been renovated.[224]\n\n\nThe rest of the road network is a state matter and therefore in very different shape, depending on which state you are in. Economically strong states such as Lagos, Anambra and Rivers receive particularly poor evaluations.[225] Most roads were built in the 1980s and early 1990s. Poor maintenance and inferior materials have worsened the condition of the roads. Travelling is very difficult. Especially during the rainy season, the use of secondary roads is sometimes almost impossible due to potholes.[226] Road bandits often take advantage of this situation for their criminal purposes.[227][228]\n\n\n\n![](image)Abuja Light Rail in Idu Station\n### Rail transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rail transport in Nigeria\n\nRailways have undergone a massive revamping with projects such as the Lagos-Kano Standard Gauge Railway being completed connecting northern cities of Kano, Kaduna, Abuja, Ibadan and Lagos.\n\n\n\n### Air transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of airports in Nigeria\n\n![](image)An A340-500 of Arik Air\nThe Nigerian aviation industry generated 198.62 billion naira (\u20ac400 million) in 2019, representing a contribution of 0.14 per cent to GDP. It was the fastest growing sector of the Nigerian economy in 2019. Passenger traffic increased from 9,358,166 in 2020 to 15,886,955 in 2021, a significant increase of over 69 per cent. Aircraft movements increased by more than 46 per cent from 2020 to 2021. Total freight volumes were 191 tonnes in 2020 but increased to 391 tonnes in 2021.[229] In December 2021, the Anambra International Cargo Airport started its operation.[230] In April 2022, the second terminal of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport has been inaugurated. It will increase the capacity of the airport to 14 million passengers per year.[231]\n\n\n\n![](image)B737-300 of Air Peace\nThere are 54 airports in Nigeria; the principal airports are\n\n\n\n* Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos,\n* Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja,\n* Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport in Kano,\n* Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu and\n* Port Harcourt International Airport in Port Harcourt.\n\n\nNigeria had in the past operated state-owned airline Nigeria Airways which was over-indebted in 2003 and was bought by the British Virgin Group; since 28 June 2005 it has flown under the name Virgin Nigeria Airways. At the end of 2008, the Virgin Group announced its withdrawal from the airline, so that since September 2009 the airline has been operating as Nigerian Eagle Airlines. The largest airline in Nigeria is privately-owned Air Peace, founded in 2012. It has a fleet of over 31 aircraft and serves national and international destinations.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Nigeria\n\nSee also: Social class in Nigeria\n\n![](image)Population density (persons per square kilometer) in Nigeria\nThe United Nations estimates that the population of Nigeria in 2021 was at 213,401,323[232][233], distributed as 51.7% rural and 48.3% urban, and with a population density of 167.5 people per square kilometer. Around 42.5% of the population were 14 years or younger, 19.6% were aged 15\u201324, 30.7% were aged 25\u201354, 4.0% were aged 55\u201364, and 3.1% were aged 65 years or older. The median age in 2017 was 18.4 years.[234] Nigeria is the world's sixth-most populous country. The birth rate is 35.2-births/1,000 population and the death rate is 9.6 deaths/1,000 population as of 2017, while the total fertility rate is 5.07 children born/woman.[234] Nigeria's population increased by 57\u00a0million from 1990 to 2008, a 60% growth rate in less than two decades.[235] Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa[236] and accounts for about 17% of the continent's total population as of 2017; however, exactly how populous is a subject of speculation.[237]\n\n\nMillions of Nigerians have emigrated during times of economic hardship, primarily to Europe, North America and Australia. It is estimated that over a million Nigerians have emigrated to the United States and constitute the Nigerian American populace. Individuals in many such Diasporic communities have joined the \"Egbe Omo Yoruba\" society, a national association of Yoruba descendants in North America.[238][239] Nigeria's largest city is Lagos. Lagos has grown from about 300,000 in 1950[240] to an estimated 13.4\u00a0million in 2017.[241]\n\n\nNigeria has more than 250 ethnic groups, with varying languages and customs, creating a country of rich ethnic diversity. The three largest ethnic groups are the Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo, together accounting for more than 60% of the population, while the Edo, Ijaw, Ful\u0253e, Kanuri, Urhobo-Isoko, Ibibio, Ebira, Nupe, Gbagyi, Jukun, Igala, Idoma, Ogoni and Tiv account for between 35 and 40%; other minorities make up the remaining 5%.[242] The Middle Belt of Nigeria is known for its diversity of ethnic groups, including the Atyap, Berom, Goemai, Igala, Kofyar, Pyem, and Tiv.[137][243][244] There are small minorities of British, American, Indian, Chinese (est. 50,000),[245] white Zimbabwean,[246] Japanese, Greek, Syrian and Lebanese immigrants. Immigrants also include those from other West African or East African nations.\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Nigeria\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The official language of Nigeria, English, was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country, owing to the influence of British colonisation which ended in 1960. Many French speakers from surrounding countries have influenced the English spoken in the border regions of Nigeria and some Nigerian citizens have become fluent enough in French to work in the surrounding countries. The French spoken in Nigeria may be mixed with some native languages and English.[248]\n\n\nThe major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of languages of Africa: the majority are Niger-Congo languages, such as Igbo, Yoruba, Ibibio, Ijaw, Fulfulde, Ogoni, and Edo. Kanuri, spoken in the northeast, primarily in Borno and Yobe State, is part of the Nilo-Saharan family, and Hausa is an Afroasiatic language. Even though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and official purposes. English as a first language is used by only a small minority of the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the three main languages spoken in Nigeria.\n\n\nWith the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas, the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages. Some of the largest of these, notably Yoruba and Igbo, have derived standardised languages from several different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups. Nigerian Pidgin English, often known simply as \"Pidgin\" or \"Broken\" (Broken English), is also a popular lingua franca, though with varying regional influences on dialect and slang. The pidgin English or Nigerian English is widely spoken within the Niger Delta Region.[249]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Nigeria\n\n![](image)\nNational Church of Nigeria, Abuja\n![](image)\nAbuja National Mosque\n![](image)\nThe Cathedral Church of Christ Marina\nFile:All saints Onitsha.jpg\nCathedral Church of All Saints\n\nNigeria is a religiously diverse society, with Islam and Christianity being the most widely professed religions. Nigerians are nearly equally divided into Muslims and Christians, with a tiny minority of adherents of traditional African religions and other religions.[250] The Christian share of Nigeria's population is in decline because of the lower fertility rate compared to Muslims in the country.[251] As in other parts of Africa where Islam and Christianity are dominant, religious syncretism with the traditional African religions is common.[252]\n\n\nA 2012 report on religion and public life by the Pew Research Center stated that in 2010, 49.3% of Nigeria's population was Christian, 48.8% was Muslim, and 1.9% were followers of indigenous and other religions (such as the Bori in the North) or unaffiliated.[253] However, in a report released by Pew Research Center in 2015, the Muslim population was estimated to be 50%, and by 2060, according to the report, Muslims will account for about 60% of the country.[254] The 2010 census of Association of Religion Data Archives has also reported that 48.8% of the total population was Christian, slightly larger than the Muslim population of 43.4%, while 7.5% were members of other religions.[255] However, these estimates should be taken with caution because sample data is mostly collected from major urban areas in the south, which are predominantly Christian.[256][257][258] According to a 2018 estimate in The World Factbook by the CIA, the population is estimated to be 53.5% Muslim, 45.9% Christian (10.6% Roman Catholic and 35.3% protestant and other Christian), and 0.6% as other.[259]\n\n\nIslam dominates northwestern Nigeria (Hausa, Nupe, Fulani and others), with 99% Muslim, and northeastern Nigeria (Kanuri, Fulani and other groups). In the west, the Yoruba people are predominantly Muslim with a significant Christian minority and a few adherents of traditional religions.[260] Protestant and locally cultivated Christianity are widely practised in Western areas, while Roman Catholicism is a more prominent Christian feature of southeastern Nigeria. Both Roman Catholicism and Protestantism are observed in the Ibibio, Efik, Ijo and Ogoni lands of the south. The Igbos (predominant in the east) and the Ibibio (south) are 98% Christian, with 2% practising traditional religions.[261] The middle belt of Nigeria contains the largest number of minority ethnic groups in Nigeria, who were found to be majority Christians and members of traditional religions, with a small proportion of Muslims.[262]\n\n\n\n#### Conflicts[edit]\n\n\nSince mid-2010, Boko Haram has terrorised northeastern Nigeria. In the following 12 years, according to the Council on Foreign Relations' \"Nigeria Security Tracker\", over 41,600 people died because of this group (as of October 2022).[263] Millions of people fled south or to the big cities, such as Maiduguri. Boko Haram also attacked churches.\n\n\nHowever, the formula \"Muslims against Christians\" falls short.[264] Despite Boko Haram's murderous hostility towards Christians, most of their victims have always been Muslims, not least because the insurgency is taking place in a predominantly Muslim part of the country, mainly Borno state in the far northeast of Nigeria.[263] The killing of such a large number of Muslims by Boko Haram, based on a broad definition of apostasy, is believed to have been one of the reasons for the group's split in 2016.[265] Nigeria Security Tracker (NST) data shows (as of March 2022) that Boko Haram attacks on churches have decreased over time, while attacks on mosques have increased.[263] The lower number of Christian fatalities at the hands of Boko Haram probably reflects the fact that most of them have fled.[265]\n\n\nBoko Haram has been in decline since at least March 2022. 40,000 of its fighters surrendered in 2022.[266] Since 2021, the Islamic State in West Africa (ISWAP) appears more dominant than Boko Haram. ISWAP is, for example, credited with the church attack in Owo at Pentecost 2022.[267][268]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Health in Nigeria\n\n![](image)Paediatric ward, General hospital, Ilorin\nHealth care delivery in Nigeria is a concurrent responsibility of the three tiers of government in the country, and the private sector.[269] Nigeria has been reorganising its health system since the Bamako Initiative of 1987, which formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population, in part by implementing user fees.[270] The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based health care reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services. A comprehensive approach strategy was extended to all areas of health care, with subsequent improvement in the health care indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost.[271]\n\n\n48% of Nigerians report that they or a household member have fallen ill in the last three months. Malaria had been diagnosed in 88% of the cases and typhoid fever in 32%.[272] High blood pressure was in third place with 8%. For symptoms of malaria, 41% of Nigerians turn to a hospital, 22% to a chemist's shop, 21% to a pharmacy and 11% seek cure through herbs.[272]\n\n\nThe HIV/AIDS rate in Nigeria is much lower than in other African nations such as Botswana or South Africa whose prevalence (percentage) rates are in the double digits. As of 2019[update], the HIV prevalence rate among adults of ages 15\u201349 was 1.5 per cent.[273] Life expectancy in Nigeria is 54.7 years on average,[273] and 71% and 39% of the population have access to improved water sources and improved sanitation, respectively.[274] As of 2019[update], the infant mortality is 74.2 deaths per 1,000 live births.[275]\n\n\nIn 2012, a new bone marrow donor program was launched by the University of Nigeria to help people with leukaemia, lymphoma, or sickle cell disease to find a compatible donor for a life-saving bone marrow transplant, which cures them of their conditions. Nigeria became the second African country to have successfully carried out this surgery.[276] In the 2014 Ebola outbreak, Nigeria was the first country to effectively contain and eliminate the Ebola threat that was ravaging three other countries in the West African region; the unique method of contact tracing employed by Nigeria became an effective method later used by countries such as the United States when Ebola threats were discovered.[277][278][279]\n\n\nThe Nigerian health care system is continuously faced with a shortage of doctors known as \"brain drain\", because of emigration by skilled Nigerian doctors to North America and Europe. In 1995, an estimated 21,000 Nigerian doctors were practising in the United States alone, which is about the same as the number of doctors working in the Nigerian public service. Retaining these expensively trained professionals has been identified as one of the goals of the government.[280]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Nigeria\n\n![](image)Abisogun Leigh Science Building, for the Lagos State University's Faculty of Science\nEducation in Nigeria is overseen by the Ministry of Education. Local authorities take responsibility for implementing policy for state-controlled public education and state schools at a regional level. The education system is divided into kindergarten, primary education, secondary education and tertiary education. After the 1970s oil boom, tertiary education was improved so it would reach every subregion of Nigeria. 68% of the Nigerian population is literate, and the rate for men (75.7%) is higher than that for women (60.6%).[281]\n\n\nNigeria provides free, government-supported education, but attendance is not compulsory at any level, and certain groups, such as nomads and the handicapped, are under-served. The education system consists of six years of primary school, three years of junior secondary school, three years of senior secondary school, and four, five or six years of university education leading to a bachelor's degree.[281] The government has majority control of university education. Tertiary education in Nigeria consists of universities (public and private), polytechnics, monotechnics, and colleges of education. The country has a total of 138 universities, with 40 federally owned, 39 state-owned, and 59 privately owned. Nigeria was ranked 109th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023, up from 118th in 2021.[282][283]\n\n\n\n### Crime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crime in Nigeria\n\n![](image)A Nigerian police officer at the Eyo festival in LagosThe security situation in Nigeria is considered inadequate despite political stability. 68% of Nigerians feel \"not safe\" in their country, according to a survey conducted by the polling institute NOI-Polls in May 2022. 77% do not know of an alarm number (\"helpline\") for emergencies.[284]\nNigerians, according to the above survey, fear being robbed (24%) or kidnapped (also 24%), being victims of armed bandits or of petty theft (both 8%), or being harmed in the herdsmen-farmers conflict (also 8%).[284] This is followed by \"ritual killings\" (4%) and \"Boko Haram\" (3.5%). Respondents see \"more security personnel and better training\" (37%), \"reduction of unemployment\" (13%) and \"prayers / divine intervention\" (8%) as promising countermeasures.[284]\n\n![](image)Homicides by Nigerian state per year and per 1 million inhabitants, comparing the UK and Turkey (Source: Nigeria Security Tracker 1/2020-6/2023)\nThe number of homicides in Nigeria varies greatly depending on the state. It is noticeable that metropoles such as Lagos, Kano and Ibadan seem much safer than rural areas. Kano has better statistics than the UK, with 1.5 homicides per year and 1 million inhabitants - which can be explained by the fact that the region's religious and morality police not only monitor the morality of the inhabitants and crack down on drug users, but also have a curbing effect on murder and manslaughter.[285] This contrasts with other cities that are also Islamic, such as Maiduguri and Kaduna, which have worrying statistics on homicides.\n\n\nThere is some piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, with attacks directed at all types of vessels. However, security measures on board of mentioned vessels have recently meant that pirates are now more likely to attack fishing villages.[286]\n\n\nInternationally, Nigeria is infamous for a type of advance-fee scam along with a form of confidence trick. The victim is talked into exchanging bank account information on the premise that the money will be transferred to them. In reality, money is taken out instead. In 2003, the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission was created to combat this and other forms of organised financial crime.[287] The EFCC is quite active.[288] On X (formerly Twitter), the financial watchdog reports almost daily on successes against fraudsters etc. and does not avoid conflicts with top politicians.[289][290]\n\n\n\n### Poverty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Poverty in Nigeria\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, 32% of Nigeria's population lives in extreme poverty (as of 2017), living on less than US$2.15 a day.[291] The World Bank stated in March 2022 that the number of poor Nigerians had increased by 5 million to 95.1 million during the Covid period.[292] Accordingly, 40% of Nigerians live below the poverty line of US$1.90 as handled by the World Bank.[293]\n\n\nThe threshold amounts used internationally by the IMF and the World Bank do not take into account the local purchasing power of a US dollar.[*citation needed*] The methodology is therefore not without controversy.[294][295] Despite the undoubted existence of slums in Nigeria, for example, the fact that 92% of men and 88% of women in Nigeria own a mobile phone[296] is difficult to reconcile with the poverty percentages published by the IMF and the World Bank.\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Human rights in Nigeria and LGBT rights in Nigeria\n\n![](image)End SARS is a decentralised social movement and series of mass protests against police brutality in Nigeria.\nNigeria's human rights record remains poor.[297] According to the U.S. Department of State,[297] the most significant human rights problems are the use of excessive force by security forces, impunity for abuses by security forces, arbitrary arrests, prolonged pretrial detention, judicial corruption and executive influence on the judiciary, rape, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners, detainees and suspects; harsh and life\u2011threatening prison and detention centre conditions; human trafficking for prostitution and forced labour, societal violence and vigilante killings, child labour, child abuse and child sexual exploitation, domestic violence, discrimination based on ethnicity, region and religion.\n\n\nNigeria is a state party of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women[298] It also has signed the Maputo Protocol, an international treaty on women's rights, and the African Union Women's Rights Framework.[299] Discrimination based on sex is a significant human rights issue. Forced marriages are common.[300] Child marriage remains common in Northern Nigeria;[301] 39% of girls are married before age 15, although the Marriage Rights Act banning marriage of girls below 18 years old was introduced on a federal level in 2008.[302] There is rampant polygamy in Northern Nigeria.[303] Submission of the wife to her husband and domestic violence are common. Women have fewer land rights.[304] Maternal mortality was at 814 per 100,000 live births in 2015.[305] Female genital mutilation is common, although a ban was implemented in 2015.[306] In Nigeria, at least half a million suffer from vaginal fistula, largely as a result of lack of medical care.[307][308] Early marriages can result in the fistula.[309]\n\n\nWomen face a large amount of inequality politically in Nigeria, being subjugated to a bias that is sexist and reinforced by socio-cultural, economic and oppressive ways.[310] Women throughout the country were only politically emancipated in 1979.[311] Yet husbands continue to dictate the votes for many women in Nigeria, which upholds the patriarchal system.[312] Most workers in the informal sector are women.[313] Women's representation in government since independence from Britain is very poor. Women have been reduced to sideline roles in appointive posts throughout all levels of government and still make up a tiny minority of elected officials.[312] But nowadays with more education available to the public, Nigerian women are taking steps to have more active roles in the public, and with the help of different initiatives, more businesses are being started by women.\n\n\nUnder the Shari'a penal code that applies to Muslims in twelve northern states, offences such as alcohol consumption, homosexuality,[314] infidelity and theft carry harsh sentences, including amputation, lashing, stoning and long prison terms.[315] Nigeria is considered to be one of the most homophobic countries in the world.[316][317][318] In the 23 years up to September 2022, university workers in Nigeria went on strike 17 times, for a total of 57 months.[319] As a result, the 2022 summer semester was cancelled nationwide.[320]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Nigeria\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nigerian literature\n\n![](image)Chinua Achebe, winner Booker Prize 2007 and Peace Award of the German book trade 2002\nMost Nigerian literature is written in English, partly because this language is understood by most Nigerians. Literature in the Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo languages (the three most populous language groups in Nigeria) does exist, however, and in the case of the Hausa, for example, can look back on a centuries-old tradition. With Wole Soyinka, Nigeria can present a Nobel Prize winner for literature. Chinua Achebe won the prestigious Booker Prize in 2007 and Ben Okri in 1991. Achebe also won the Peace Award of the German Book Trade in 2002. Lola Shoneyin has won several awards for her book The Secret Lives of Baba Segi's Wives (novel).\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Nigeria\n\nThe earliest known form of popular music in Nigeria was the palm-wine music which dominated the music landscape in the 1920s. Tunde King was a prominent name in the genre.[321][322]\n\n\n1930s saw the emergence of Onitsha Native Orchestra. They explored various social themes and trends in their native singing style.[321][322]\n\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Highlife music became a popular staple in the country with regional genres such as the Igbo Highlife. A notable exponent of the genre were the genre's first Nigerian boy band Oriental Brothers International, Bobby Benson, Osita Osadebe, Victor Olaiya, Rex Lawson, Dr Sir Warrior and Oliver De Coque.[321][322]\n\n\nThe 1970s was the era of Fela Kuti, the pioneer of afrobeat genre - fused from Highlife, Jazz and Yoruba Music. Fela later evolved into social activism and black consciousness.[321][322]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, King Sunny Ade achieved success with Juju Music. Prominent singer of the era is William Onyeabor who is known for his fusion of Funk Music and Disco.[321][323]\n\n\nBy 1990s, Reggae music transitioned into the music scene. Prominent reggae artiste of the era was Majek Fashek. By the mid-1990s, Hip hop Music began to gain popularity, led by acts such as Remedies, Trybes Men, JJC, etc. All throughout the years, highlife music retained its popularity in the country.\n\n\nAt the turn of the century, famous 2000s Acts like P-Square, 2face, and Dbanj were credited to have made tremendous impact in the evolution of Afrobeats and its popularization on the international stage. [324][325][326]\n\n\nIn November 2008, Nigeria's music scene (and that of Africa) received international attention when MTV hosted the continent's first African music awards show in Abuja.[327] over a decade later and Afro beats has widely taken over with artist like Davido, Wizkid and Burna Boy.\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of Nigeria\n\n> \n> Top five highest grossing Nigerian films:\n> \n> \n> \n> * *Omo Ghetto: The Saga* (\u20a6636 million)[328]\n> * *The Wedding Party* (\u20a6452 million)[329]\n> * *The Wedding Party 2* (\u20a6433 million)[330]\n> * *Chief Daddy* (\u20a6387 million)[331]\n> * *King of Thieves* (2022, \u20a6321 million)[332]\n> \n> \n>\n\nThe Nigerian film industry is known as Nollywood (a blend of \"Nigeria\" and \"Hollywood\")[333] and is now the second-largest producer of movies in the world, having surpassed Hollywood. Only India's Bollywood is larger. Nigerian film studios are based in Lagos, Kano, and Enugu, and form a major portion of the local economy of these cities. Nigerian cinema is Africa's largest movie industry in terms of both value and the number of movies produced per year. Although Nigerian films have been produced since the 1960s, the country's film industry has been aided by the rise of affordable digital filming and editing technologies.\nThe 2009 thriller film *The Figurine* heightened the media attention towards the New Nigerian Cinema revolution. The film was a critical and commercial success in Nigeria, and it was also screened in international film festivals.[334] The 2010 film *Ij\u00e9* by Chineze Anyaene, overtook *The Figurine* to become the highest-grossing Nigerian film; a record it held for four years until it was overtaken in 2014 by *Half of a Yellow Sun* (2013).[335][336] By 2016, this record was held by *The Wedding Party*, a film by Kemi Adetiba.\n\n\nBy the end of 2013, the film industry reportedly hit a record-breaking revenue of \u20a61.72\u00a0trillion (US$4.1\u00a0billion). As of 2014, the industry was worth \u20a6853.9\u00a0billion (US$5.1\u00a0billion), making it the third most valuable film industry in the world behind the United States and India. It contributed about 1.4% to Nigeria's economy; this was attributed to the increase in the number of quality films produced and more formal distribution methods.[337][338]\n\n\nT.B. Joshua's Emmanuel TV, originating from Nigeria, is one of the most viewed television stations across Africa.[339]\n\n\n\n### Festival[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Festivals in Nigeria\n\n![](image)Ofala Festival of Onitsha People\nThere are many festivals in Nigeria, some of which date to the period before the arrival of the major religions in this ethnically and culturally diverse society. The main Muslim and Christian festivals are often celebrated in ways that are unique to Nigeria or unique to the people of a locality.[340] The Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation has been working with the states to upgrade the traditional festivals, which may become important sources of tourism revenue.[341]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Suya With Pepper Sauce\n![](image)Akara\n![](image)Nkwobi\nNigerian cuisine, like West African cuisine in general, is known for its richness and variety. Many different spices, herbs, and flavourings are used in conjunction with palm oil or groundnut oil to create deeply flavoured sauces and soups often made very hot with chilli peppers. Nigerian feasts are colourful and lavish, while aromatic market and roadside snacks cooked on barbecues or fried in oil are plentiful and varied. Suya is usually sold in urban areas especially during night-time.[342]\n\n\n\n### Fashion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fashion in Nigeria\n\n![](image)Dumebi Iyamah, founder and CEO of the fashion label Andrea Iyamah\nThe fashion industry in Nigeria contributes significantly to the country's economics. Casual attire is commonly worn but formal and traditional styles are also worn depending on the occasion. Nigeria is known not only for its fashionable textiles and garments, but also for its fashion designers who have increasingly gained international recognition. Euromonitor estimates the Sub-Saharan fashion market to be worth $31 billion, with Nigeria accounting for 15% of these $31 billion.[343] Nigeria is not only known for their many fashion textiles and garment pieces that are secret to their culture. They also outputted many fashion designers who have developed many techniques and businesses along the way.\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Nigeria\n\n![](image)Nigeria at the 2018 FIFA World Cup\nFootball is largely considered Nigeria's national sport, and the country has its own Premier League of football. Nigeria's national football team, known as the \"Super Eagles\", has made the World Cup on six occasions 1994, 1998, 2002, 2010, 2014, and 2018. In April 1994, the Super Eagles ranked 5th in the FIFA World Rankings, the highest-ranking achieved by an African football team. They won the African Cup of Nations in 1980, 1994, and 2013, and have also hosted the U-17 & U-20 World Cup. They won the gold medal for football in the 1996 Summer Olympics (in which they beat Argentina) becoming the first African football team to win gold in Olympic football.\n\n\n\n![](image)Nigerian football supporters at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia\nNigeria is also involved in other sports such as basketball, cricket and track and field.[344] Boxing is also an important sport in Nigeria;.[345] Nigeria's national basketball team made the headlines internationally when it became the first African team to beat the United States men's national team.[346] In earlier years, Nigeria qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics as it beat heavily favoured world elite teams such as Greece and Lithuania.[347] Nigeria has been home to numerous internationally recognised basketball players in the world's top leagues in America, Europe and Asia. These players include Basketball Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon, and later players in the NBA. The Nigerian Premier League has become one of the biggest and most-watched basketball competitions in Africa. The games have aired on *Kwese TV* and have averaged a viewership of over a million people.[348]\n\n\nNigeria made history by qualifying the first bobsled team for the Winter Olympics from Africa when their women's two-person team qualified for the bobsled competition at the XXIII Olympic Winter Games.[349] In the early 1990s, Scrabble was made an official sport in Nigeria; by the end of 2017, there were around 4,000 players in more than 100 clubs in the country.[350] In 2018, the Nigerian Curling Federation was established to introduce a new sport to the country with the hope of getting the game to be a part of the curriculum at the elementary, high school, and university levels respectively. At the 2019 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship in Norway, Nigeria won their first international match beating France 8\u20135.[351]\n\n\nNigeria's women's and men's national teams in beach volleyball competed at the 2018\u20132020 CAVB Beach Volleyball Continental Cup.[352] The country's U21 national teams qualified for the 2019 FIVB Beach Volleyball U21 World Championships.[353]\n\n\nNigeria is the birthplace of the sport loofball. It is a team sport which is played by tossing a furry ball over a net.[354]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Nigeria portal\n\n\n* Index of Nigeria-related articles\n* Outline of Nigeria\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Hausa: *Najeriya* Hausa pronunciation: [n\u00e0\u02d0.(d)\u0292\u00e9\u02d0.r\u00ed.j\u00e0\u02d0] listen\u24d8, Igbo: *Na\u00ecj\u00edr\u00edy\u00e0*, Yoruba: *N\u00e0\u00ecj\u00edr\u00ed\u00e0*, Nigerian Pidgin: *Naij\u00e1* [\u02c8na\u026a.d\u0292\u0259], Fula: *Naajeeriya*, Tyap: *Naijeriya*\n2. **^** NigeriaSat-1, NigeriaSat-2, NigeriaSat-X, NigComSat-1, and NigComSat-1R\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Blench, Roger (2014). *An Atlas Of Nigerian Languages*.

It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, the Celtic Sea to the southwest and the Bristol Channel to the south. As of the 2021 census, it had a population of 3,107,494.[1] It has a total area of 21,218\u00a0km2 (8,192\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and over 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline.[7] It is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon (*Yr Wyddfa*), its highest summit.[13] The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. The capital and largest city is Cardiff.\n\n\nA distinct Welsh culture emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales was briefly united under Gruffydd ap Llywelyn in 1055. After over 200 years of war, the conquest of Wales by King Edward I of England was completed by 1283, though Owain Glynd\u0175r led the Welsh Revolt against English rule in the early 15th century, and briefly re-established an independent Welsh state with its own national parliament (Welsh: *senedd*). In the 16th century the whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century. Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by David Lloyd George, was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party. Welsh national feeling grew over the century: a nationalist party, Plaid Cymru, was formed in 1925, and the Welsh Language Society in 1962. A governing system of Welsh devolution is employed in Wales, of which the most major step was the formation of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament, formerly the National Assembly for Wales) in 1998, responsible for a range of devolved policy matters.\n\n\nAt the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial one; the South Wales Coalfield's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales's population. Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales, including Cardiff, Swansea, Newport and the nearby valleys. The eastern region of North Wales has about a sixth of the overall population, with Wrexham being the largest northern city. The remaining parts of Wales are sparsely populated. Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, the economy is based on the public sector, light and service industries, and tourism. Agriculture in Wales is largely livestock based, making Wales a net exporter of animal produce, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency.\n\n\nThe country has a distinct national and cultural identity and from the late 19th century onwards Wales acquired its popular image as the \"land of song\", in part due to the *eisteddfod* tradition and rousing choir singing. Both Welsh and English are official languages. A majority of the population in most areas speaks English whilst the majority of the population in parts of the north and west speak Welsh, with a total of 538,300 Welsh speakers across the entire country.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Etymology of Wales\n\nThe English words \"Wales\" and \"Welsh\" derive from the same Old English root (singular *Wealh*, plural *W\u0113alas*), a descendant of Proto-Germanic \\**Walhaz*, which was itself derived from the name of the Gauls known to the Romans as Volcae. This term was later used to refer indiscriminately to inhabitants of the Western Roman Empire.[14] Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular; the plural form *W\u0113alas* evolved into the name for their territory, Wales.[15][16] Historically in Britain, the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that Anglo-Saxons associated with Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g. Cornwall) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g. Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire).[17]\n\n\nThe modern Welsh name for themselves is *Cymry*, and *Cymru* is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced [\u02c8k\u0259m.r\u0268]) are descended from the Brythonic word *combrogi*, meaning \"fellow-countrymen\",[18][19] and probably came into use before the 7th century.[20] In literature, they could be spelt *Kymry* or *Cymry*, regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland.[18] The Latinised forms of these names, *Cambrian*, *Cambric* and *Cambria*, survive as names such as the Cambrian Mountains and the Cambrian geological period.[21]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Wales and Timeline of Welsh history\nSee also: Archaeology of Wales\n\n### Prehistoric origins[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Prehistoric Wales\n\n![A low grassy mound with an entrance at its centre framed by cyclopean stones](image)Bryn Celli Ddu, a late Neolithic chambered tomb on Anglesey\n![](image)Caradog by Thomas Prydderch. Caradog was leader of the north Walian Celtic tribe, the Ordovices.\nWales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years[22] Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age, between 12,000 and 10,000\u00a0years before present (BP), when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain. At that time, sea levels were much lower than today. Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250\u00a0BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea. By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island.[23] By the beginning of the Neolithic (c.\u20096,000 BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet (10 metres) lower than today.[24] The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod's drowning and tales in the *Mabinogion*, of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time.[25]\n\n\nNeolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changing their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers about 6,000\u00a0BP \u2013 the Neolithic Revolution.[25][26] They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land, developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production, and built cromlechs such as Pentre Ifan, Bryn Celli Ddu, and Parc Cwm long cairn between about 5,800\u00a0BP and 5,500\u00a0BP.[27] Over the following centuries they assimilated immigrants and adopted ideas from Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic cultures. Some historians, such as John T. Koch, consider Wales in the Late Bronze Age as part of a maritime trading-networked culture that included other Celtic nations.[28] This \"Atlantic-Celtic\" view is opposed by others who hold that the Celtic languages derive their origins from the more easterly Hallstatt culture.[29] By the time of the Roman invasion of Britain the area of modern Wales had been divided among the tribes of the Deceangli (north-east), Ordovices (north-west), Demetae (south-west), Silures (south-east) and Cornovii (east), centuries.[25][30]\n\n\n\n### Roman era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wales in the Roman era\n\n![](image)Map of the Roman invasion of Wales\nThe Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48 and took 30 years to complete; the occupation lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest were opposed by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices. Caractacus or *Caradog*, leader of the Ordovices, had initial success in resisting Roman invasions of north Wales but was eventually defeated.[31][32] Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales, where there is a legacy of Romanisation.[33] The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent, is in south east Wales.[34] Both Caerwent and Carmarthen, also in southern Wales, became Roman *civitates*.[35] Wales had a rich mineral wealth. The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold, copper and lead, as well as lesser amounts of zinc and silver.[36] No significant industries were located in Wales in this time;[36] this was largely a matter of circumstance as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation. Latin became the official language of Wales, though the people continued to speak in Brythonic. While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes came to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire.[37] Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity, which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4th\u00a0century, as a result of Constantine I issuing an edict of toleration in 313.[37]\n\n\nEarly historians, including the 6th-century cleric Gildas, have noted 383 as a significant point in Welsh history.[38] In that year, the Roman general Magnus Maximus, or Macsen Wledig, stripped Britain of troops to launch a successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor, and transferring power to local leaders.[39] The earliest Welsh genealogies cite Maximus as the founder of several royal dynasties,[40] and as the father of the Welsh Nation.[38] He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg, erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales.[41]\n\n\n\n### Post-Roman era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Wales in the Early Middle Ages\n\n![](image)Britain in AD 500: The areas shaded pink on the map were inhabited by the Britons, here labelled *Welsh*. The pale blue areas in the east were controlled by Germanic tribes, whilst the pale green areas to the north were inhabited by the Gaels and Picts.\nThe 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales.[37] After the Roman departure in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples, commonly known as Anglo-Saxons. Some have theorized that the cultural dominance of the Anglo-Saxons was due to apartheid-like social conditions in which the Britons were at a disadvantage.[42]\nBy AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule.[37] The kingdoms of Gwynedd, Powys, Dyfed, Caredigion, Morgannwg, the Ystrad Tywi, and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh successor states.[37] Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles.[43] John Davies notes this as consistent with a victory for the Celtic Britons at Badon Hill against the Saxons, which was attributed to Arthur by Nennius.[43]\n\n\nHaving lost much of what is now the West Midlands to Mercia in the 6th and early 7th centuries, a resurgent late-7th-century Powys checked Mercian advances. Aethelbald of Mercia, looking to defend recently acquired lands, had built Wat's Dyke. According to Davies, this had been with the agreement of king Elisedd ap Gwylog of Powys, as this boundary, extending north from the valley of the River Severn to the Dee estuary, gave him Oswestry.[44] Another theory, after carbon dating placed the dyke's existence 300 years earlier, is that it was built by the post-Roman rulers of Wroxeter.[45] King Offa of Mercia seems to have continued this initiative when he created a larger earthwork, now known as Offa's Dyke (*Clawdd Offa*). Davies wrote of Cyril Fox's study of Offa's Dyke: \"In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near Trelystan, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near Rhiwabon, it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden.\" And, for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built \"on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the River Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent.\"[44] However, Fox's interpretations of both the length and purpose of the Dyke have been questioned by more recent research.[46]\n\n\n\nIn 853, the Vikings raided Anglesey, but in 856, Rhodri Mawr defeated and killed their leader, Gorm.[47] The Celtic Britons of Wales made peace with the Vikings and Anarawd ap Rhodri allied with the Norsemen occupying Northumbria to conquer the north.[48] This alliance later broke down and Anarawd came to an agreement with Alfred, king of Wessex, with whom he fought against the west Welsh. According to *Annales Cambriae*, in 894, \"Anarawd came with the Angles and laid waste Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi.\"[49]\n\n![](image)Medieval map of Welsh realms\n![](image)Hywel Dda enthroned\nThe southern and eastern parts of Great Britain lost to English settlement became known in Welsh as *Lloegyr* (Modern Welsh *Lloegr*), which may have referred to the kingdom of Mercia originally and which came to refer to England as a whole.[a] The Germanic tribes who now dominated these lands were invariably called *Saeson*, meaning \"Saxons\". The Anglo-Saxons called the Romano-British \\**Walha*, meaning 'Romanised foreigner' or 'stranger'.[50] The Welsh continued to call themselves *Brythoniaid* (Brythons or Britons) well into the Middle Ages, though the first written evidence of the use of *Cymru* and *y Cymry* is found in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan (*Moliant Cadwallon*, by Afan Ferddig) c.\u2009633.[15] In *Armes Prydain*, believed to be written around 930\u2013942, the words *Cymry* and *Cymro* are used as often as 15 times.[51] However, from the Anglo-Saxon settlement onwards, the people gradually begin to adopt the name *Cymry* over *Brythoniad*.[52]\n\n\nFrom 800 onwards, a series of dynastic marriages led to Rhodri Mawr's (r. 844\u201377) inheritance of Gwynedd and Powys. His sons founded the three dynasties of (Aberffraw for Gwynedd, Dinefwr for Deheubarth and Mathrafal for Powys). Rhodri's grandson Hywel Dda (r. 900\u201350) founded Deheubarth out of his maternal and paternal inheritances of Dyfed and Seisyllwg in 930, ousted the Aberffraw dynasty from Gwynedd and Powys and then codified Welsh law in the 940s.[53]\n\n\n\n### High to late middle ages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Wales in the High Middle Ages and Wales in the Late Middle Ages\n\nSee also: List of rulers of Wales and Welsh rebellions against English rule\n\nGruffydd ap Llywelyn was the only ruler to unite all of Wales under his rule, described by one chronicler after his death as king of Wales. In 1055 Gruffydd ap Llywelyn killed his rival Gruffydd ap Rhydderch in battle and recaptured Deheubarth.[54] Originally king of Gwynedd, by 1057 he was ruler of Wales and had annexed parts of England around the border. He ruled Wales with no internal battles.[55] His territories were again divided into the traditional kingdoms.[56] John Davies states that Gruffydd was \"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales... Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.\"[2] Owain Gwynedd (1100\u201370) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title *princeps Wallensium* (prince of the Welsh), a title of substance given his victory on the Berwyn Mountains, according to Davies.[57] During this time, between 1053 and 1063, Wales lacked any internal strife and was at peace.[58]\n\n\nWithin four years of the Battle of Hastings (1066), England had been completely subjugated by the Normans.[2] William I of England established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors, along the Welsh border, their boundaries fixed only to the east (where they met other feudal properties inside England).[59] Starting in the 1070s, these lords began conquering land in southern and eastern Wales, west of the River Wye. The frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as *Marchia Wallie*, the Welsh Marches, in which the Marcher lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law.[60] The extent of the March varied as the fortunes of the Marcher lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed.[61]\n\n\n\nOwain Gwynedd's grandson Llywelyn Fawr (the Great, 1173\u20131240), received the fealty of other Welsh lords in 1216 at the council at Aberdyfi, becoming in effect the first prince of Wales.[62] His grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd secured the recognition of the title *Prince of Wales* from Henry III with the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267.[63] Subsequent disputes, including the imprisonment of Llywelyn's wife Eleanor, culminated in the first invasion by King Edward I of England.[64] As a result of military defeat, the Treaty of Aberconwy exacted Llywelyn's fealty to England in 1277.[64] Peace was short-lived, and, with the 1282 Edwardian conquest, the rule of the Welsh princes permanently ended. With Llywelyn's death and his brother prince Dafydd's execution, the few remaining Welsh lords did homage to Edward I.[65] The Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 provided the constitutional basis for a post-conquest government of the Principality of North Wales from 1284 until 1535/36.[66] It defined Wales as \"annexed and united\" to the English Crown, separate from England but under the same monarch. The king ruled directly in two areas: the Statute divided the north and delegated administrative duties to the Justice of Chester and Justiciar of North Wales, and further south in western Wales the King's authority was delegated to the Justiciar of South Wales. The existing royal lordships of Montgomery and Builth remained unchanged.[67] To maintain his dominance, Edward constructed a series of castles: Beaumaris, Caernarfon, Harlech and Conwy. His son, the future Edward II, was born at Caernarfon in 1284.[68] He became the first English prince of Wales in 1301, which at the time provided an income from northwest Wales known as the Principality of Wales.[69] \n\n![The statue of a man in a tunic and short cape clasped at his right shoulder, sculpted in white stone.

In 1404, Owain was crowned prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain (Castille) and Scotland.[70] Glynd\u0175r went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including a Welsh parliament (Welsh: *senedd*) at Machynlleth. The rebellion was eventually defeated by 1412. Having failed Owain went into hiding and nothing was known of him after 1413.[71][72] The penal laws against the Welsh of 1401\u201302 passed by the English parliament made the Welsh second-class citizens. With hopes of independence ended, there were no further wars or rebellions against English colonial rule and the laws remained on the statute books until 1624.[73]\n\n\nHenry Tudor (born in Wales in 1457) seized the throne of England from Richard III in 1485, uniting England and Wales under one royal house. The last remnants of Celtic-tradition Welsh law were abolished and replaced by English law by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 during the reign of Henry VII's son, Henry VIII.[74] In the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales, Wales became unified with the kingdom of England; the \"Principality of Wales\" began to refer to the whole country, though it remained a \"principality\" only in a ceremonial sense.[66][75] The Marcher lordships were abolished, and Wales began electing members of the Westminster parliament.[76]\n\n\n\n### Early modern period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Early modern period in Wales\n\n![](image)*Dowlais Ironworks* (1840) by George Childs (1798\u20131875)In 1536 Wales had around 278,000 inhabitants, which increased to around 360,000 by 1620. This was primarily due to rural settlement, where animal farming was central to the Welsh economy. Increase in trade and increased economic stability occurred due to the increased diversity of the Welsh economy. Population growth however outpaced economic growth and the standard of living dropped.[77]\n\n\nPrior to the Industrial Revolution in Wales, there were small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales.[78] These ranged from those connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles, through to mining and quarrying.[78] Agriculture remained the dominant source of wealth.[78] The emerging industrial period saw the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that connected it with Cornwall's copper mines in the south and the large copper deposits at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century.[78] The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both the north and the south of the country.[79] In the north, John Wilkinson's Ironworks at Bersham was a major centre, while in the south, at Merthyr Tydfil, the ironworks of Dowlais, Cyfarthfa, Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales.[79] By the 1820s, south Wales produced 40 per cent of all Britain's pig iron.[79]\n\n\nBy the 18th century, lawyers, doctors, estate agents and government officials formed a bourgeoisie with sizeable houses.[77] In the late 18th century, slate quarrying began to expand rapidly, most notably in North Wales. The Penrhyn Quarry, opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant, was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century,[80] and along with Dinorwic Quarry, it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying has been described as \"the most Welsh of Welsh industries\",[81] it is coal mining which became the industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw an explosion in demand. As the South Wales coalfield was exploited, Cardiff, Swansea, Penarth and Barry grew as world exporters of coal. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal.[82]\n\n\n\n### Modern period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Modern history of Wales\n\nSee also: Wales in the World Wars\n\n![](image)*Battle at Mametz Wood* by Christopher Williams (1918)\n![](image)A Plaid Cymru rally in Machynlleth in 1949, where the \"Parliament for Wales in 5 years\" campaign was started\nHistorian Kenneth Morgan described Wales on the eve of the First World War as a \"relatively placid, self-confident and successful nation\". The output from the coalfields continued to increase, with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9.6\u00a0million tons of coal extracted in 1913.[83] The First World War (1914\u20131918) saw a total of 272,924 Welshmen under arms, representing 21.5 per cent of the male population. Of these, roughly 35,000 were killed,[84] with particularly heavy losses of Welsh forces at Mametz Wood on the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele.[85] The first quarter of the 20th century also saw a shift in the political landscape of Wales. Since 1865, the Liberal Party had held a parliamentary majority in Wales and, following the general election of 1906, only one non-Liberal Member of Parliament, Keir Hardie of Merthyr Tydfil, represented a Welsh constituency at Westminster. Yet by 1906, industrial dissension and political militancy had begun to undermine Liberal consensus in the southern coalfields.[86] In 1916, David Lloyd George became the first Welshman to become Prime Minister of Britain.[87] In December 1918, Lloyd George was re-elected at the head of a Conservative-dominated coalition government, and his poor handling of the 1919 coal miners' strike was a key factor in destroying support for the Liberal party in south Wales.[88] The industrial workers of Wales began shifting towards the Labour Party. When in 1908 the Miners' Federation of Great Britain became affiliated to the Labour Party, the four Labour candidates sponsored by miners were all elected as MPs. By 1922, half the Welsh seats at Westminster were held by Labour politicians\u2014the start of a Labour dominance of Welsh politics that continued into the 21st century.[89]\n\n\nAfter economic growth in the first two decades of the 20th century, Wales's staple industries endured a prolonged slump from the early 1920s to the late 1930s, leading to widespread unemployment and poverty.[90] For the first time in centuries, the population of Wales went into decline; unemployment reduced only with the production demands of the Second World War.[91] The war saw Welsh servicemen and women fight in all major theatres, with some 15,000 of them killed. Bombing raids brought high loss of life as the German Air Force targeted the docks at Swansea, Cardiff and Pembroke. After 1943, 10 per cent of Welsh conscripts aged 18 were sent to work in the coal mines, where there were labour shortages; they became known as Bevin Boys. Pacifist numbers during both World Wars were fairly low, especially in the Second World War, which was seen as a fight against fascism.[92]\n\n\nPlaid Cymru was formed in 1925, seeking greater autonomy or independence from the rest of the UK.[93] The term \"England and Wales\" became common for describing the area to which English law applied, and in 1955 Cardiff was proclaimed as Wales's capital. *Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg* (The Welsh Language Society) was formed in 1962, in response to fears that the language might soon die out.[94] Nationalist sentiment grew following the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in 1965 to create a reservoir to supply water to the English city of Liverpool.[95] Although 35 of the 36 Welsh MPs voted against the bill (one abstained), Parliament passed the bill and the village of Capel Celyn was submerged, highlighting Wales's powerlessness in her own affairs in the face of the numerical superiority of English MPs in Parliament.[96] Separatist groupings, such as the Free Wales Army and *Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru* were formed, conducting campaigns from 1963.[97] Prior to the investiture of Charles in 1969, these groups were responsible for a number of bomb attacks on infrastructure.[98] At a by-election in 1966, Gwynfor Evans won the parliamentary seat of Carmarthen, Plaid Cymru's first Parliamentary seat.[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)\"Cofiwch Dryweryn\" mural after rebuild in October 2020, protesting the Tryweryn flooding to supply water to England\nBy the end of the 1960s, the policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy.[100] This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications,[100] most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period, but this was shown to be optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years.[101]\n\n\n\n### Devolution[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Welsh devolution\n\nThe Welsh Language Act 1967 repealed a section of the Wales and Berwick Act and thus \"Wales\" was no longer part of the legal definition of England. This essentially defined Wales as a separate entity legally (but within the UK), for the first time since before the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 which defined Wales as a part of the Kingdom of England. The Welsh Language Act 1967 also expanded areas where use of Welsh was permitted, including in some legal situations.[102]\n\n\n\n![](image)Protest against the Investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales at the memorial to Llywelyn the Last, native Prince of Wales in Cilmeri, 1969\nIn a referendum in 1979, Wales voted against the creation of a Welsh assembly with an 80 per cent majority. In 1997, a second referendum on the same issue secured a very narrow majority (50.3 per cent).[103] The National Assembly for Wales (*Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru*) was set up in 1999 (under the Government of Wales Act 1998) with the power to determine how Wales's central government budget is spent and administered, although the UK Parliament reserved the right to set limits on its powers.[103] The governments of the United Kingdom and of Wales almost invariably define Wales as a country.[104] The Welsh Government says: \"Wales is not a Principality. Although we are joined with England by land, and we are part of Great Britain, Wales is a country in its own right.\"[105][b]\n\n\nThe Government of Wales Act 2006 (c 32) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that reformed the National Assembly for Wales and allows further powers to be granted to it more easily. The Act creates a system of government with a separate executive drawn from and accountable to the legislature.[107] Following a successful referendum in 2011 on extending the law making powers of the National Assembly it is now able to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly, on all matters in devolved subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament's agreement.[107]\n\n\nIn the 2016 referendum, Wales voted in support of leaving the European Union, although demographic differences became evident. According to Danny Dorling, professor of geography at Oxford University, votes for Leave may have been boosted by the large proportion (21 per cent) of retired English people living in Wales.[108]\n\n\n\nAfter the Senedd and Elections (Wales) Act 2020, the National Assembly was renamed \"*Senedd Cymru*\" (in Welsh) and the \"Welsh Parliament\" (in English), which was seen as a better reflection of the body's expanded legislative powers.[109]\n\n![](image)First ever rally for Welsh Independence, Cardiff 2019\nIn 2016, YesCymru was launched.

Most linguists believe that the Celtic languages arrived in Britain around 600 BCE.[113] The Brythonic languages ceased to be spoken in England and were replaced by the English language, which arrived in Wales around the end of the eighth century due to the defeat of the Kingdom of Powys.[114]\n\n\nThe Bible translations into Welsh and the Protestant Reformation, which encouraged use of the vernacular in religious services, helped the language survive after Welsh elites abandoned it in favour of English in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.[115]\n\n\nSuccessive Welsh Language Acts, in 1942, 1967 and 1993, improved the legal status of Welsh.[116] The Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 modernised the 1993 Welsh Language Act and gave Welsh an official status in Wales for the first time, a major landmark for the language. The Measure also created the post of Welsh Language Commissioner, replacing the Welsh Language Board.[117] Following the referendum in 2011, the Official Languages Act became the first Welsh law to be created in 600 years, according to the First Minister at the time, Carwyn Jones. This law was passed by Welsh Assembly members (AMs) only and made Welsh an official language of the National Assembly.[118]\n\n\nStarting in the 1960s, many road signs have been replaced by bilingual versions.[119] Various public and private sector bodies have adopted bilingualism to a varying degree and (since 2011) Welsh is the only official (*de jure*) language in any part of Great Britain.[120]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Wales\n\nSee also: Politics of the United Kingdom and Welsh devolution\n\n![](image)The Senedd building, designed by Richard Rogers, opened on St David's Day 2006.\nWales is a country that is part of the sovereign state of the United Kingdom.[13] Constitutionally, the UK is a *de jure* unitary state, with a parliament and government in Westminster.[121] Wales has a devolved, unicameral legislature known as the Senedd (Senedd Cymru - Welsh Parliament) which holds devolved powers from the UK Parliament via a reserved powers model.[122] For the purposes of local government, Wales has been divided into 22 council areas since 1996.

At the 2019 general election, 22 Labour and Labour Co-op MPs were elected, along with 14 Conservative MPs and 4 Plaid Cymru MPs from Wales.[121] The Wales Office is a department of the UK government responsible for Wales, whose minister, the secretary of state for Wales (Welsh secretary), sits in the UK cabinet.[125]\n\n\n\n### Devolved Government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Welsh Government and Senedd\n\n![](image)First Minister Mark Drakeford meets with First Minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf in Edinburgh, 2023\nFollowing devolution in 1997, the Government of Wales Act 1998 created a Welsh devolved assembly, the National Assembly for Wales, with the power to determine how Wales's central government budget is spent and administered.[126] Eight years later, the Government of Wales Act 2006 reformed the National Assembly for Wales and allowed further powers to be granted to it more easily. The Act also created a system of government with a separate executive, the Welsh Government, drawn from and accountable to the legislature, the National Assembly. Following a successful referendum in 2011, the National Assembly was empowered to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly, on all matters in devolved subject areas, without requiring the UK Parliament's approval of legislative competence. It also gained powers to raise taxes.[127]:\u200a33\u201334 In May 2020, the National Assembly was renamed \"Senedd Cymru\" or \"the Welsh Parliament\", commonly known as the Senedd in both English and Welsh.[127]:\u200a18,\u200a33\u201334\n\n\nDevolved areas of responsibility include agriculture, economic development, education, health, housing, local government, social services, tourism, transport and the Welsh language.[128] The Welsh Government also promotes Welsh interests abroad.[129]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Welsh law, Law of the United Kingdom, and English law\n\n![A half timbered building of two floors, with four sets of leaded windows to the front aspect and one set to the side.

The 'law of Hywel Dda' (Welsh: *Cyfraith Hywel*), as it became known, codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries. Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim, or the victim's kin, rather than punishment by the ruler.[130] Other than in the Marches, where March law was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284. Edward I of England annexed the Principality of Wales following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute. Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until Henry VIII of England annexed the whole of Wales under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 (often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales.[131][132] The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of Berwick) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967. English law has been the legal system of England and Wales since 1536.[133]\n\n\nEnglish law is regarded as a common law system, with no major codification of the law and legal precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive. The court system is headed by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The Senior Courts of England and Wales is the highest court of first instance as well as an appellate court. The three divisions are the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice, and the Crown Court. Minor cases are heard by magistrates' courts or the County Court. In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point, Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single jurisdiction of England and Wales.[134]\n\n\nThe Senedd has the authority to draft and approve laws outside of the UK Parliamentary system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a referendum held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation, at the time referred to as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales but now known as an Act of Senedd Cymru in relation to twenty subjects listed in the Government of Wales Act 2006 such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the Welsh Government can then also enact more specific subordinate legislation.[135]\n\n\nWales is served by four regional police forces: Dyfed-Powys Police, Gwent Police, North Wales Police, and South Wales Police.[136] There are five prisons in Wales: four in the southern half of the country, and one in Wrexham. Wales has no women's prisons: female inmates are imprisoned in England.[137]\n\n\n\n## Geography and natural history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Wales\n\nSee also: List of settlements in Wales by population, List of towns in Wales, and List of cities in Wales\n\nSee also: Natural resources of Wales\n\n![](image)Snowdon (Welsh: *Yr Wyddfa*) Gwynedd, the highest mountain in Wales\nWales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain.[138] It is about 170 miles (270\u00a0km) north to south.[139] The oft-quoted \"size of Wales\" is about 20,779\u00a0km2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[140] Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions: the Irish Sea to the north and west, St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest and the Bristol Channel to the south.[141][142] Wales has about 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline (along the mean high water mark), including the mainland, Anglesey and Holyhead.[143] Over 50 islands lie off the Welsh mainland, the largest being Anglesey, in the north-west.[144]\n\n\nMuch of Wales's diverse landscape is mountainous, particularly in the north and central regions. The mountains were shaped during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation. The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia (*Eryri*), of which five are over 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). The highest of these is Snowdon (*Yr Wyddfa*), at 1,085\u00a0m (3,560\u00a0ft).[145][146] The 14 Welsh mountains, or 15 if including Carnedd Gwenllian\u00a0\u2013 often discounted because of its low topographic prominence\u00a0\u2013 over 3,000 feet (910 metres) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s and are located in a small area in the north-west.[147] The highest outside the 3000s is Aran Fawddwy, at 905 metres (2,969 feet), in the south of Snowdonia.[148] The Brecon Beacons (*Bannau Brycheiniog*) are in the south (highest point Pen y Fan, at 886 metres (2,907 feet)),[149] and are joined by the Cambrian Mountains in Mid Wales (highest point Pumlumon, at 752 metres (2,467 feet)).[150]\n\n\n\n![](image)Relief map of Wales:  \nTopography above 600 feet (180\u00a0m)\nNational Parks\n\nWales has three national parks: Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons, and Pembrokeshire Coast (*Arfordir Penfro*). It has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty: Anglesey, the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley, the Gower Peninsula, the Ll\u0177n Peninsula, and the Wye Valley.[151] The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in 1956. As of 2019, the coastline of Wales had 40 Blue Flag beaches, three Blue Flag marinas and one Blue Flag boat operator.[152] Despite its heritage and award-winning beaches, the south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies/south-westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. In 1859 over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales in a hurricane that saw more than 800 lives lost across Britain.[153] The greatest single loss occurred with the sinking of the *Royal Charter* off Anglesey in which 459 people died.[154] The 19th century saw over 100 vessels lost with an average loss of 78 sailors per year.[155] Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead, Milford Haven and Swansea.[155] Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the *Sea Empress* oil spill in 1996.[156]\n\n\nThe first border between Wales and England was zonal, apart from around the River Wye, which was the first accepted boundary.[157] Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke.[157] The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching from the mouth of the Dee to the mouth of the Wye.[157] Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law.[157]\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of Wales\n\nThe earliest geological period of the Palaeozoic era, the Cambrian, takes its name from the Cambrian Mountains, where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants.[158][159] In the mid-19th century, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick used their studies of Welsh geology to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology. The next two periods of the Palaeozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian, were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area.[160][161]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Wales\n\n\n\n| Wales\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 159\n\n\n\n7\n\n1\n | 114\n\n\n\n7\n\n1\n | 119\n\n\n\n9\n\n2\n | 86\n\n\n\n11\n\n3\n | 81\n\n\n\n15\n\n6\n | 86\n\n\n\n17\n\n9\n | 78\n\n\n\n19\n\n11\n | 106\n\n\n\n19\n\n11\n | 124\n\n\n\n16\n\n9\n | 153\n\n\n\n13\n\n7\n | 157\n\n\n\n9\n\n4\n | 173\n\n\n\n7\n\n2\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0C |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in mm |\n| Source: Met Office |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 6.2\n\n\n\n44\n\n34\n | 4.5\n\n\n\n44\n\n34\n | 4.7\n\n\n\n47\n\n36\n | 3.4\n\n\n\n52\n\n38\n | 3.2\n\n\n\n58\n\n43\n | 3.4\n\n\n\n62\n\n47\n | 3.1\n\n\n\n66\n\n52\n | 4.2\n\n\n\n66\n\n51\n | 4.9\n\n\n\n61\n\n48\n | 6\n\n\n\n55\n\n44\n | 6.2\n\n\n\n49\n\n39\n | 6.8\n\n\n\n45\n\n36\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0F |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\n![](image)A Red kite, considered one of the national symbols of Wales and voted the nation's favourite bird[162]\nWales lies within the north temperate zone. It has a changeable, maritime climate and is one of the wettest countries in Europe.[163][164] Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters.[163][165]\n\n\n\n* Highest maximum temperature: 37.1\u00a0\u00b0C (99\u00a0\u00b0F) at Hawarden, Flintshire on 18 July 2022.[166]\n* Lowest minimum temperature: \u221223.3\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221210\u00a0\u00b0F) at Rhayader, Radnorshire (now Powys) on 21 January 1940.[167]\n* Maximum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 354.3 hours at Dale Fort, Pembrokeshire in July 1955.[168]\n* Minimum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 2.7 hours at Llwynon, Brecknockshire in January 1962.[168]\n* Maximum rainfall in a day (0900 UTC \u2212 0900 UTC): 211 millimetres (8.3\u00a0in) at Rhondda, Glamorgan, on 11 November 1929.[169]\n* Wettest spot \u2013 an average of 4,473 millimetres (176\u00a0in) rain a year at Crib Goch in Snowdonia, Gwynedd (making it also the wettest spot in the United Kingdom).[170]\n\n\n### Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Biodiversity of Wales\n\nWales's wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets, Manx shearwater, puffins, kittiwakes, shags and razorbills. In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland-habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel.[171][172] Birds of prey include the merlin, hen harrier and the red kite, a national symbol of Welsh wildlife.[173] In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy, including seasonal visitors.[174] Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period. Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse, are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area.[175] The pine marten, which has been sighted occasionally, has been reintroduced in parts of Wales since 2015, having previously not been officially recorded since the 1950s.[176] The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats can be found in Snowdonia.[177] In March 2021, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) granted a licence to release up to six beavers in the Dyfi Valley, the first official beaver release in Wales.[178]\n\n\nBelieved to be home to some of Wales's rarest land invertebrates, some 2,500 disused coal tips are the subject of study by the Welsh Government; the tips are home to a wide variety of other wildlife.[179]\n\n\nThe waters of south-west Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks, Atlantic grey seals, leatherback turtles, dolphins, porpoises, jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, in particular, are recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins, and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins in the whole of the UK. River fish of note include char, eel, salmon, shad, sparling and Arctic char, whilst the gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake. Wales is known for its shellfish, including cockles, limpet, mussels and periwinkles. Herring, mackerel and hake are the more common of the country's marine fish.[180] The north facing high grounds of Snowdonia support a relict pre-glacial flora including the iconic Snowdon lily \u2013 *Gagea serotina* \u2013 and other alpine species such as *Saxifraga cespitosa*, *Saxifraga oppositifolia* and *Silene acaulis*. Wales has a number of plant species not found elsewhere in the UK, including the spotted rock-rose *Tuberaria guttata* on Anglesey and *Draba aizoides* on the Gower.[181]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Wales\n\n![](image)A profile of the economy of Wales in 2012\nA 2021 introduction to some of the largest companies based in Wales, including: Airbus, bipsync, HCI Pharmaceutical, ReNeuron, Deloitte, Coaltown Coffee, DMM International and Freudenberg\nOver the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and then to a post-industrial economy.[182] In the 1950s, Wales's GDP was twice as big as Ireland\u2019s; by the 2020s, Ireland's economy was four times that of Wales. Since the Second World War, the service sector has come to account for the majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies.[183] in 2018, according to OECD and Eurostat data, gross domestic product (GDP) in Wales was \u00a375\u00a0billion, an increase of 3.3 per cent from 2017. GDP per head in Wales in 2018 was \u00a323,866, an increase of 2.9 per cent on 2017. This compares to Italy\u2019s GDP/capita of \u00a325,000, Spain \u00a322,000, Slovenia \u00a320,000 and New Zealand \u00a330,000.[184][185] In the three months to December 2017, 72.7 per cent of working-age adults were employed, compared to 75.2 per cent across the UK as a whole.[186] For the 2018\u201319 fiscal year, the Welsh fiscal deficit accounts for 19.4 per cent of Wales's estimated GDP.[187]\n\n\nIn 2019, Wales was a net exporter of electricity. It produced 27.9 TWh of electricity while only consuming 14.7 TWh.[188] In 2021, the Welsh government said that more than half the country's energy needs were being met by renewable sources, 2 per cent of which was from 363 hydropower projects.[189]\n\n\nBy UK law, Wales contributes to items that do not directly benefit Wales e.g. over \u00a35 billion for HS2 \"which will damage the Welsh economy by \u00a3200m pa\", according to the UK and Welsh Government's transport adviser Mark Barry. Wales also pays more in military costs than most similar-sized countries e.g. Wales pays twice the amount Ireland spends on the military.[190] The UK government spends \u00a31.75bn per year on the military in Wales, which is almost as much as Wales spends on education every year (\u00a31.8 billion in 2018/19) and five times as much as the total amount spent on the police in Wales (\u00a3365 million).[191]\n\n\nFrom the middle of the 19th century until the post-war era, the mining and export of coal was the dominant industry. At its peak of production in 1913, nearly 233,000 men and women were employed in the South Wales coalfield, mining 56 million tons of coal.[192] Cardiff was once the largest coal-exporting port in the world and, for a few years before the First World War, handled a greater tonnage of cargo than either London or Liverpool.[193] In the 1920s, over 40 per cent of the male Welsh population worked in heavy industry.[194] According to Phil Williams, the Great Depression \"devastated Wales\", north and south, because of its \"overwhelming dependence on coal and steel\".[194] From the mid-1970s, the Welsh economy faced massive restructuring with large numbers of jobs in heavy industry disappearing and being replaced eventually by new ones in light industry and in services. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wales was successful in attracting an above average share of foreign direct investment in the UK.[195] Much of the new industry was essentially of a \"branch (or \"screwdriver\") factory\" type where a manufacturing plant or call centre is in Wales but the most highly-paid jobs in the company are elsewhere.[196][197]\n\n\nPoor-quality soil in much of Wales is unsuitable for crop-growing, so livestock farming has been the focus of farming. About 78 per cent of the land surface is used for agriculture.[198] The Welsh landscape, with its three national parks and Blue Flag beaches, attracts large numbers of tourists, who bolster the economy of rural areas.[199] Wales, like Northern Ireland, has relatively few high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of \"economic mass\" (i.e. population) \u2013 Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre.[197] The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK: in 2002 it stood at 90 per cent of the EU25 average and around 80 per cent of the UK average.[197] In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation to be awarded Fairtrade status.[200]\n\n\nThe pound sterling is the currency used in Wales. Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century: the last bank to do so closed in 1908. Since then the Bank of England has had a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales.[201] The Commercial Bank of Wales, established in Cardiff by Sir Julian Hodge in 1971, was taken over by the Bank of Scotland in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002.[202] The Royal Mint, which issues the coinage circulating through the whole of the UK, has been based at a single site in Llantrisant since 1980.[203] Since decimalisation, in 1971, at least one of the coins in circulation emphasises Wales such as the 1995 and 2000 one pound coin (above). As at 2012, the last designs devoted to Wales saw production in 2008.[204]\n\n\nDuring 2020, and well into 2021, the restrictions and lockdowns necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic affected all sectors of the economy and \"tourism and hospitality suffered notable losses from the pandemic\" across the UK.[205] As of 6 April 2021, visitors from \"red list\" countries were still not allowed to enter unless they were UK residents. Restrictions will \"likely be in place until the summer\", one report predicted, with June being the most likely time for tourism from other countries to begin a rebound.[206] On 12 April 2021, many tourist facilities were still closed in Wales but non-essential travel between Wales and England was finally permitted. Wales also allowed non-essential retail stores to open.[207]\u00a0\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Wales\n\nThe M4 motorway running from West London to South Wales links Newport, Cardiff and Swansea. Responsibility for the section of the motorway within Wales, from the Second Severn Crossing to Pont Abraham services, sits with the Welsh Government.\n\n\n\n[208] The A55 expressway has a similar role along the North Wales coast, connecting Holyhead and Bangor with Wrexham and Flintshire. It also links to northwest England, principally Chester.[209] The main north-south Wales link is the A470, which runs from Cardiff to Llandudno.[210]\n\n![](image)Rail network of Wales, 2021Rail transport in Wales includes the Wales & Borders franchise, which is overseen by the Welsh Government with most passenger services operated by Transport for Wales Rail.[211] The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network. Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland.[212] Services between north and south Wales operate through the English cities of Chester and Hereford and towns of Shrewsbury, Gobowen for Oswestry and along the Welsh Marches Line, with trains on the Heart of Wales Line from Swansea to Llandovery, Llandrindod and Knighton connecting the Welsh March Line in Craven Arms. Trains in Wales are mainly diesel-powered but the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff is undergoing electrification, although the programme has experienced significant delays and costs-overruns.[213] A North-South railway has been suggested to better link North and South Wales.[214][215][216]\n\n\nCardiff Airport is the international airport of Wales. Providing links to European, African and North American destinations, it is about 12 miles (19\u00a0km) southwest of Cardiff city centre, in the Vale of Glamorgan. Intra-Wales flights used to run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, and were operated since 2017 by Eastern Airways.,[217] those flights are no longer, as of 2022, available. Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.[218] Wales has four commercial ferry ports. Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from Holyhead, Pembroke Dock and Fishguard. The Swansea to Cork service was cancelled in 2006, reinstated in March 2010, and withdrawn again in 2012.[219]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Wales and History of education in Wales\n\nSee also: List of universities in Wales, List of further education colleges in Wales, and Lists of schools in Wales\n\n![](image)St. David's Building, Lampeter campus, University of Wales, Trinity Saint David (*Prifysgol Cymru, Y Drindod Dewi Sant*). Founded in 1822, it is the oldest degree-awarding institution in Wales.[220] A distinct education system has developed in Wales.[221] Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite. The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin, Brecon and Cowbridge.[221] One of the first successful schooling systems was started by Griffith Jones, who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s; these are believed to have taught half the country's population to read.[222] In the 19th century, with increasing state involvement in education, Wales was forced to adopt an education system that was English in ethos even though the country was predominantly Non-conformist, Welsh-speaking and demographically uneven because of the economic expansion in the south.[222] In some schools, to ensure Welsh children spoke English at school, the Welsh Not was employed as corrective punishment; this was much resented,[223] although the extent of its use is difficult to determine.[224] State and local governmental edicts resulted in schooling in the English language which, following the 1847 Inquiry into the State of Education in Wales \u2013 an event subsequently referred to as the Treachery of the Blue Books (Welsh: *Brad y Llyfrau Gleision*) \u2013 was seen as more academic and worthwhile for children.[225]\n\n\nThe University College of Wales opened in Aberystwyth in 1872. Cardiff and Bangor followed, and the three colleges came together in 1893 to form the University of Wales.[222] The Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889 created 95 secondary schools. The Welsh Department for the Board of Education followed in 1907, which gave Wales its first significant educational devolution.[222] A resurgence in Welsh-language schools in the latter half of the 20th century at nursery and primary level saw attitudes shift towards teaching in the medium of Welsh.[226] Welsh is a compulsory subject in all of Wales's state schools for pupils aged 5\u201316 years old.[227] While there has never been an exclusively Welsh-language college, Welsh-medium higher education is delivered through the individual universities and has since 2011 been supported by the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (Welsh National College) as a delocalised federal institution. In 2021\u20132022, there were 1,470 maintained schools in Wales.[228] In 2021\u201322, the country had 471,131 pupils taught by 25,210 full-time equivalent teachers.[229][230]\n\n\n\n## Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Wales\n\n![](image)University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff\nPublic healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales (*GIG Cymru*), through seven local health boards and three all-Wales trusts. It was originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales by the National Health Service Act 1946, but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969.[231] Responsibility for NHS Wales passed to the Welsh Assembly under devolution in 1999, and is now the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Social Services.[232] Historically, Wales was served by smaller 'cottage' hospitals, built as voluntary institutions.[233] As newer, more expensive, diagnostic techniques and treatments became available, clinical work has been concentrated in newer, larger district hospitals.[233] In 2006, there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales.[233] NHS Wales directly employs over 90,000 staff, making it Wales's biggest employer.[234] The National Survey for Wales in 2021\u201322 reported that 72 per cent of adults surveyed had good or very good general health, 19 per cent had fair general health and 8 had bad or very bad general health.[235] The survey recorded that 46 per cent of Welsh adults had a long-standing illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes or heart disease.[236] The survey also reported that 13 per cent of the adult population were smokers, 16 per cent admitted drinking alcohol above weekly recommended guidelines, while 56 per cent undertook the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week.[237] According to the survey, 30 per cent of adults in Wales reported to have eaten at least 5 portions of fruit or vegetables the previous day and 36 per cent reported a healthy weight.[238]\n\n\n\n## Demography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demography of Wales\n\n### Population history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPopulation of Wales| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  1536\n | 278,000 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n|  1620\n | 360,000 | +29.5% |\n|  1770\n | 500,000 | +38.9% |\n|  1801\n | 587,000 | +17.4% |\n|  1851\n | 1,163,000 | +98.1% |\n|  1911\n | 2,421,000 | +108.2% |\n|  1921\n | 2,656,000 | +9.7% |\n|  1939\n | 2,487,000 | \u22126.4% |\n|  1961\n | 2,644,000 | +6.3% |\n|  1991\n | 2,811,865 | +6.3% |\n|  2001\n | 2,910,200 | +3.5% |\n|  2011\n | 3,063,456 | +5.3% |\n|  2021\n | 3,107,500 | +1.4% |\n| Estimated (pre-1801);census (post-1801)[239] 2001 census[240]2021 census[241] |\n\n\nThe population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire, which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911.[242] Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution, as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups,[243] including Italians, who migrated to South Wales.[244] Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales. Many of these self-identify as Welsh.[245]\n\n\nThe population in 1972 stood at 2.74 million and remained broadly static for the rest of the decade. However, in the early 1980s, the population fell due to net migration out of Wales. Since the 1980s, net migration has generally been inward, and has contributed more to population growth than natural change.[246] The resident population of Wales in 2021 according to the census was 3,107,500 (1,586,600 female and 1,521,000 male), an increase of 1.4 per cent over 2011. A decreased change from the 5 per cent increase between 2001 and 2011.[247] Wales accounted for 5.2 per cent of the population of England and Wales in 2021. Wales has seven cities, those being Cardiff, Newport, Swansea, and Wrexham, with the communities of Bangor, St Asaph and St Davids also having city status in the United Kingdom.[248] Wrexham, north Wales's largest settlement, became Wales's newest and seventh city in September 2022.[249]\n\n\n\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in WalesOffice for National Statistics 2011 Census[250]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Council area |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Council area |  Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Cardiff](image)Cardiff![Swansea](image)Swansea | 1 | Cardiff | City & County of Cardiff | 335,145 | 11 | Caerphilly | Caerphilly County Borough | 41,402\n | ![Newport](image)Newport![Wrexham](image)Wrexham |\n| 2 | Swansea | City & County of Swansea | 239,000 | 12 | Port Talbot | Neath Port Talbot | 37,276\n |\n| 3 | Newport | Newport City | 128,060 | 13 | Pontypridd | Rhondda Cynon Taf | 30,457\n |\n| 4 | Wrexham | Wrexham County Borough | 61,603 | 14 | Aberdare | Rhondda Cynon Taf | 29,748\n |\n| 5 | Barry | Vale of Glamorgan | 54,673 | 15 | Colwyn Bay | Conwy County Borough | 29,405\n |\n| 6 | Neath | Neath Port Talbot | 50,658 | 16 | Pontypool | Torfaen | 28,334\n |\n| 7 | Cwmbran | Torfaen | 46,915 | 17 | Penarth | Vale of Glamorgan | 27,226\n |\n| 8 | Bridgend | Bridgend County Borough | 46,757 | 18 | Rhyl | Denbighshire | 25,149\n |\n| 9 | Llanelli | Carmarthenshire | 43,878 | 19 | Blackwood | Caerphilly County Borough | 24,042\n |\n| 10 | Merthyr Tydfil | Merthyr Tydfil | 43,820 | 20 | Maesteg | Bridgend County Borough | 18,888\n |\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Wales\n\nSee also: Welsh language and Welsh-speaking population\n![](image)The proportion of respondents in the 2011 census who said they could speak WelshWelsh is an official language in Wales as legislated by the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011.[251] Both Welsh and English are also official languages of the Senedd.[252] The proportion of the Welsh population able to speak the Welsh language fell from just under 50 per cent in 1901 to 43.5 per cent in 1911, and continued to fall to a low of 18.9 per cent in 1981.[253] The results of the 2001 Census showed an increase in the number of Welsh speakers to 21 per cent of the population aged 3 and older, compared with 18.7 per cent in 1991 and 19 per cent in 1981. This compares with a pattern of steady decline indicated by census results during the 20th century.[254] In the 2011 census it was recorded that the proportion of people able to speak Welsh had dropped from 20.8 per cent to 19 per cent (still higher than 1991). Despite an increase in the overall size of the Welsh population this still meant that the number of Welsh speakers in Wales dropped from 582,000 in 2001 to 562,000 in 2011. However this figure was still much higher than 508,000 or 18.7 per cent of people who said they could speak Welsh in the 1991 census.[255]\n\n\nAccording to the 2021 census, the Welsh-speaking population of Wales aged three or older was 17.8 per cent (538,300 people) and nearly three quarters of the population in Wales said they had no Welsh language skills.[256] Other estimates suggest that 29.7 per cent (899,500) of people aged three or older in Wales could speak Welsh in June 2022.[257]\n\n\nEnglish is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language in most of the country. Code-switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists.[258] \"Wenglish\" is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh.[259] Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh no longer occurs.[260]\n\n\nSince Poland joined the European Union, Wales has seen a significant increase in Polish immigrants. This has made Polish the most common main language in Wales after English or Welsh, at 0.7 per cent of the population.[261]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Wales\n\n![](image)St. David's Cathedral, Pembrokeshire\nForms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now the Wales for more than 1,400 years.[262][263]\nThe 2021 census recorded 46.5 per cent had \"No religion\", more than any single religious affiliation and up from 32.1 per cent in 2011.[264] The largest religion in Wales is Christianity, with 43.6 per cent of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2021 census.[264] The patron saint of Wales is Saint David (*Dewi Sant*), with Saint David's Day (*Dydd G\u0175yl Dewi Sant*) celebrated annually on 1 March.[265] The early 20th century saw a religious revival, the 1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival, which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and brought large numbers of converts, sometimes whole communities, to non-Anglican Christianity.[266]\n\n\nThe Church in Wales with 56,000 adherents has the largest attendance of the denominations.[267] It is a province of the Anglican Communion, and was part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914. The first Independent Church in Wales was founded at Llanvaches in 1638 by William Wroth. The Presbyterian Church of Wales was born out of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811.[268] The second largest attending faith in Wales is Roman Catholic, with an estimated 43,000 adherents.[267]\n\n\nNon-Christian religions are small in Wales, making up approximately 2.7 per cent of the population.[269] Islam is the largest, with 24,000 (0.8 per cent) reported Muslims in the 2011 census.[269] There are also communities of Hindus and Sikhs, mainly in the south Wales cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea, while the largest concentration of Buddhists is in the western rural county of Ceredigion.[270] Judaism was the first non-Christian faith to be established in Wales since Roman times, though by 2001 the community had declined to approximately 2,000[271] and as of 2019 only numbers in the hundreds.[272]\n\n\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demography of Wales \u00a7\u00a0Ethnicity\n\n![](image)Singer Shirley Bassey\nThe 2021 census showed that 93.8 per cent of the population of Wales identified as \"White\", compared to 95.6 per cent in 2011. 90.6 per cent of the population identified as \"White: Welsh, English, Scottish, Northern Irish or British\" in 2021. The second-highest ethnicity in 2021 was \"Asian, Asian Welsh or Asian British\" at 2.9 per cent of the population, compared to 2.3 per cent in 2011. 1.6 per cent of the population identified as \"Mixed or multiple ethnic groups\", compared to 1.0 per cent in 2011; 0.9 per cent of the population identified as \"Black, Black Welsh, Black British, Caribbean or African\", compared to 0.6 per cent in 2011; and 0.9 per cent identified as \"Other ethnic group\" compared to 0.5 per cent in 2011. The local authorities with the highest proportions of \"high-level\" ethnic groups other than \"White\" were mainly urban areas including Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. 5.3 per cent of households in Wales were multiple ethnic group households, up from 4.2 per cent in 2011.[273]\n\n\nIn 2021, the first statue of a named, non-fictional woman outdoors was raised for Wales's first black headteacher, Betty Campbell. In 2023, Patti Flynn (a contemporary of Shirley Bassey, both of Tiger Bay, Cardiff) became the first black Welsh woman to be awarded a purple plaque. [274]\n\n\n\n### National identity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Welsh national identity\n\nThe 2021 census showed that 55.2 per cent identified as \"Welsh only\" and 8.1 per cent identified as \"Welsh and British\", giving the combined proportion of 63.3 per cent for people identifying as Welsh.[275] The Welsh Annual Population Survey showed that the proportion of people who identified as Welsh versus another identity was 62.3 per cent in 2022, compared to 69.2 per cent in 2001.[276] A 2022 YouGov poll found that 21 per cent considered themselves Welsh not British, 15 per cent more Welsh than British, 24 per cent equally Welsh and British, 7 per cent more British than Welsh, 20 per cent British and not Welsh, and 8 per cent other; a total of 67 per cent thus considered themselves Welsh to some degree.[277]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Wales\n\nWales has a distinctive culture including its own language, customs, holidays and music. There are four UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Wales: The Castles and Town Walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd; Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and Canal; the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape; and The Slate Landscape of Northwest Wales.[278]\n\n\n\n### Mythology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Welsh mythology\n\nRemnants of native Celtic mythology of the pre-Christian Britons was passed down orally by the *cynfeirdd* (the early poets).[279] Some of their work survives in later medieval Welsh manuscripts: the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Book of Aneirin (both 13th-century); the Book of Taliesin and the White Book of Rhydderch (both 14th-century); and the Red Book of Hergest (c.\u00a01400).[279] The prose stories from the White and Red Books are known as the *Mabinogion*.[280] Poems such as *Cad Goddeu* (The Battle of the Trees) and mnemonic list-texts like the *Welsh Triads* and the *Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain*, also contain mythological material.[281] These texts include the earliest forms of the Arthurian legend and the traditional history of post-Roman Britain.[279] Other sources of Welsh folklore include the 9th-century Latin historical compilation *Historia Britonum* (the History of the Britons) and Geoffrey of Monmouth's 12th-century Latin chronicle *Historia Regum Britanniae* (the History of the Kings of Britain), and later folklore, such as *The Welsh Fairy Book* by W. Jenkyn Thomas.[282]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Literature of Wales (Welsh language), List of Welsh writers, and Literature of Wales (English language)\n\n![](image)Welsh poetry from the 13th-century Black Book of Carmarthen.\nWales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe[283] going back to the sixth century and including Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales, regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages.[283] The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets Taliesin and Aneirin, survive not in their original form, but in much-changed, medieval versions.[283] Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived the Dark Ages, through the era of the Poets of the Princes (c.\u20091100\u20131280) and then the Poets of the Gentry (c.\u20091350\u20131650). The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the cywydd metre.[284] The period produced one of Wales's greatest poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym.[285] After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined.[284]\n\n\nDespite the extinction of the professional poet, the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits.[286] Renaissance scholars such as William Salesbury and John Davies brought humanist ideals from English universities.[286] In 1588 William Morgan became the first person to translate the Bible into Welsh.[286] From the 16th century the proliferation of the 'free-metre' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular.[286] By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers.[287] The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality.[288] Initially excluded, religious denominations came to dominate the competitions, with bardic themes becoming scriptural and didactic.[288]\n\n\nDevelopments in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest's translation into English of the Mabinogion, one of the most important medieval Welsh prose works of Celtic mythology. 1885 saw the publication of *Rhys Lewis* by Daniel Owen, credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century saw a move from the verbose Victorian Welsh style, with works such as Thomas Gwynn Jones's *Ymadawiad Arthur*.[287] The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry.[287] The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. The inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis, for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism.[287]\n\n\nThe careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two, including those of Gwyn Thomas, Vernon Watkins, and Dylan Thomas, whose most famous work *Under Milk Wood* was first broadcast in 1954. Thomas was one of the most notable and popular Welsh writers of the 20th century and one of the most innovative poets of his time.[289] The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, with greater sympathy for Welsh nationalism and the Welsh language. The change is linked to the nationalism of Saunders Lewis and the burning of the Bombing School on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in 1936.[290] In poetry R. S. Thomas (1913\u20132000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the twentieth century. He \"did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English\".[291] Major writers in the second half of the twentieth century include Emyr Humphreys (born 1919), who during his long writing career published over twenty novels,[292] and Raymond Williams (1921\u20131988).[293]\n\n\n\n### Museums and libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth\nAmgueddfa Cymru \u2013 Museum Wales was founded by royal charter in 1907 as the National Museum of Wales. It operates at seven sites: National Museum Cardiff, St Fagans National History Museum, Big Pit National Coal Museum, National Wool Museum, National Slate Museum, National Roman Legion Museum, and the National Waterfront Museum. Entry to all sites is free.[294] The National Library of Wales, based in Aberystwyth, houses important collections of printed works, including the Sir John Williams Collection and the Shirburn Castle collection,[295] as well as art collections including portraits and photographs, ephemera and Ordnance Survey maps.[295]\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Welsh art\n\nSee also: Architecture of Wales\n\nWorks of Celtic art have been found in Wales.[296] In the Early Medieval period, the Celtic Christianity of Wales was part of the Insular art of the British Isles. A number of illuminated manuscripts from Wales survive, including the 8th-century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels. The 11th-century Ricemarch Psalter (now in Dublin) is certainly Welsh, made in St David's, and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence.[297]\n\n\nSome Welsh artists of the 16th\u201318th centuries tended to leave the country to work, moving to London or Italy. Richard Wilson (1714\u20131782) is arguably the first major British landscapist; although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London. By the late 18th century, the popularity of landscape art grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the Celtic Revival.[298]\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Bard*, 1774, by Thomas Jones (1742\u20131803).\nAn Act of Parliament in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom, and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists, and its artists' colony helped to form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881.[299] The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams, whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens[300] and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists, based respectively in the United States and France.[301]\n\n\nWelsh painters gravitated towards the art capitals of Europe. Augustus John and his sister Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales for most of their lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London; he was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism. Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill, the London-Welshman David Jones, and the sculptor Jonah Jones. The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle in Swansea, centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and the poet and artist Vernon Watkins, which also included the painter Alfred Janes.[302]\n\n\nSouth Wales had several notable potteries, one of the first important sites being the Ewenny Pottery in Bridgend, which began producing earthenware in the 17th century.[303] In the 18th and 19th centuries, with more scientific methods becoming available, more refined ceramics were produced: this was led by the Cambrian Pottery (1764\u20131870, also known as \"Swansea pottery\"), and later Nantgarw Pottery near Cardiff, which was in operation from 1813 to 1820 making fine porcelain, and then utilitarian pottery from 1833 until 1920.[303] Portmeirion Pottery, founded in 1960 by Susan Williams-Ellis (daughter of Clough Williams-Ellis, creator of the Italianate village of Portmeirion, Gwynedd) is based in Stoke-on-Trent, England.[304]\n\n\n\n### National symbols and identity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Welsh national identity and National symbols of Wales\n\n![](image)The red dragon, a popular symbol in Wales.\nWales is regarded as a modern Celtic nation which contributes to its national identity,[30][305] with Welsh artists regularly appearing at Celtic festivals.[306] The red dragon is the principal symbol of national identity and pride, personifying the fearlessness of the Welsh nation.[307] The dragon is first referenced in literature as a symbol of the people in the Historia Brittonum. Vortigern (Welsh: *Gwrtheyrn*), King of the Celtic Britons, is interrupted whilst attempting to build a fort at Dinas Emrys. He is told by Ambrosius[c] to dig up two dragons beneath the castle. He discovers a red dragon representing the Celtic Britons, and a white dragon representing Anglo-Saxons. Ambrosius prophesies that the Celtic Britons will reclaim the island and push the Anglo-Saxons back to the sea.[309]\n\n\nAs an emblem, the red dragon of Wales has been used since the reign of Cadwaladr, King of Gwynedd from around 655AD, and is present on the national flag of Wales, which became an official flag in 1959.[310] The banner of Owain Glynd\u0175r is associated with Welsh nationhood; it was carried into battle by Welsh forces during Glynd\u0175r's battles against the English, and includes four lions on red and gold.[311] The standard is similar to the arms of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (Llywelyn the Last), the last Prince of Wales before the conquest of Wales by Edward I of England. The design may also be influenced by the arms of Glyndwr's parents, both of whom had lions in their arms. Owain Glynd\u0175r Day is celebrated on 16 September in Wales and there have been calls to make it a national bank holiday.[312][313][314] The Prince of Wales's feathers is also used in Wales: it consists of three white feathers emerging from a gold coronet, and the German motto *Ich dien* (I serve). Several Welsh representative teams, including the Welsh rugby union, and Welsh regiments in the British Army, including the Royal Welsh, use the badge or a stylised version of it.[315][316][d]\n\n\nOn 1 March, Welsh people celebrate St David's day, commemorating the death of the country's patron saint in 589.[318] It is not a recognised Bank holiday although there have been calls to make it so.[319][320][321] The day is celebrated by schools and cultural societies across Wales, and customs include the wearing of a leek or a daffodil, which are two national emblems of Wales. Children also wear the national costume.[322] The origins of the leek can be traced to the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd George.[323] This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek, *cenhinen*, and that for daffodil, *cenhinen Bedr* or St. Peter's leek.[138] A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins.[323] Other Welsh festivals include Mabsant when parishes would celebrate the patron saint of their local church, although this is now rarely observed,[324] and a more modern celebration, Dydd Santes Dwynwen (St Dwynwen's Day), observed on 25 January in a similar way to St Valentine's Day.[325]\n\n\n*\"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" (English: Land of My Fathers)* is the National Anthem of Wales, and is played at events such as football or rugby matches involving the Wales national team, as well as the opening of the Senedd and other official occasions.[326] \"*Cymru am byth*\" (\"Wales forever\") is a popular Welsh motto.[327] Another Welsh motto \"Y Ddraig Goch Ddyry Cychwyn\" (\"the red dragon inspires action\") has been used on the Royal Badge of Wales when it was created in 1953.[328]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Wales\n\n![](image)Millennium Stadium, Cardiff\nMore than 50 national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales.[329] Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup, Rugby World Cup, Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games. At the Olympic Games, Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team. Wales has hosted several international sporting events.[330] These include the 1958 Commonwealth Games,[331] the 1999 Rugby World Cup, the 2010 Ryder Cup and the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final.[330][332]\n\n\nAlthough football has traditionally been the more popular sport in North Wales, rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness.[333] The Wales national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup, hosting the tournament in 1999. The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions: Cardiff Blues, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets.[334] The Welsh regional teams play in the United Rugby Championship,[335] the Heineken Champions Cup if they qualify[336] and the European Rugby Challenge Cup, again dependent on qualification.[337] Rugby league in Wales dates back to 1907. A professional Welsh League existed from 1908 to 1910.[338]\n\n\nWales has had its own football league, the Welsh Premier League, since 1992.[339] For historical reasons, five Welsh clubs play in the English football league system: Cardiff City, Swansea City, Newport County, Wrexham, and Merthyr Town.[340] The country has produced a considerable number of footballers who have played at international level.[341] At UEFA Euro 2016, the Wales national team achieved their best ever finish, reaching the semi-finals.[342]\n\n\nIn international cricket, Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), called the England cricket team, or simply 'England'.[343] Occasionally, a separate Wales team play limited-overs competitions. Glamorgan County Cricket Club is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship.[344] Wales has produced notable participants of individual sports including snooker,[345] track and field,[346] cycling,[347][348] and boxing.[349][350]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media in Wales\n\nSee also: List of newspapers in Wales, Radio in Wales, and Television in Wales\n\n![](image)A number of BBC productions, such as *Doctor Who* and *Torchwood*, have been filmed in Wales.\nWales became the UK's first digital television nation in 2010.[351] BBC Cymru Wales is the national broadcaster,[352] producing both television and radio programmes in Welsh and English.[353] It has also produced programmes such as *Life on Mars*, *Doctor Who* and *Torchwood* for BBC's network audience across the United Kingdom.[352][354] ITV, the UK's main commercial broadcaster, has a Welsh-orientated service branded ITV Cymru Wales.[355] S4C began broadcasting in 1982. Its output was mostly in Welsh at peak hours, but shared English-language content with Channel 4 at other times. Since the digital switchover the channel has broadcast exclusively in Welsh.[356] BBC Radio Cymru is the BBC's Welsh-language radio service, which broadcasts throughout Wales.[352] A number of independent radio stations broadcast in the Welsh regions, predominantly in English. In 2006, several regional radio stations broadcast in Welsh: output ranged from two two-minute news bulletins each weekday (Radio Maldwyn) to over 14 hours of Welsh-language programmes weekly (Swansea Sound) to essentially bilingual stations such as Heart Cymru and Radio Ceredigion.[357]\n\n\nMost of the newspapers sold and read in Wales are national newspapers available throughout Britain. The *Western Mail* is Wales's only print national daily newspaper.[358] Wales-based regional daily newspapers include the *Daily Post* (which covers North Wales), the *South Wales Evening Post* (Swansea), the *South Wales Echo* (Cardiff), and the *South Wales Argus* (Newport).[358] *Y Cymro* is a Welsh-language newspaper, published weekly.[359] *Wales on Sunday* is the only Welsh Sunday newspaper that covers the whole of Wales.[360] The Books Council of Wales is the Welsh-Government-funded body tasked with promoting Welsh literature in Welsh and English.[361] The BCW provides publishing grants for qualifying English- and Welsh-language publications.[362] Around 650 books are published each year, by some of the dozens of Welsh publishers.[363][364] Wales's main publishing houses include Gomer Press, Gwasg Carreg Gwalch, Honno, the University of Wales Press and Y Lolfa.[363] Journals with a Welsh focus include *Cambria* (a Welsh affairs magazine published bi-monthly in English),[365] *Planet,* and *Poetry Wales*.[366] Welsh-language magazines include the current affairs titles *Golwg* (\"View\"), published weekly, and *Barn* (\"Opinion\"), published monthly.[359] *Y Wawr* (\"The Dawn\") is published quarterly by *Merched y Wawr*, the national organisation for women.[359] *Y Traethodydd* (\"The Essayist\"), a quarterly publication by the Presbyterian Church of Wales, first appeared in 1845 and is the oldest Welsh publication still in print.[359]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Welsh cuisine\n\n![](image)Cawl, a traditional meat and vegetable dish from Wales.\nTraditional Welsh dishes include laverbread (made from *Porphyra umbilicalis*, an edible seaweed), bara brith (fruit bread), cawl (a lamb stew), cawl cennin (leek soup), and Welsh cakes.[367] Cockles are sometimes served as a traditional breakfast with bacon and laverbread.[368] Although Wales has its own traditional food and has absorbed much of the cuisine of England, Welsh diets now owe more to the countries of India, China and the United States. Chicken tikka masala is the country's favourite dish, while hamburgers and Chinese food outsell fish and chips as takeaways.[369]\n\n\n\n### Performing arts[edit]\n\n\n#### Music and festivals[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of Wales and List of festivals in Wales\n\n![](image)Singer Tom Jones\nWales, \"the land of song\", is notable for its solo artists, its male voice choirs and its harpists.[370] The annual *National Eisteddfod* is the country's main performance festival. The *Llangollen International Eisteddfod* provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform. The Welsh Folk Song Society publishes collections of historical songs and tunes.[371] Traditional instruments of Wales include the *telyn deires* (triple harp), fiddle, *crwth* (bowed lyre) and the *pibgorn* (hornpipe).[372] Male voice choirs emerged in the 19th century, formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day.[373] Welsh congregations and choirs were known for singing in a rousing four-voice style, becoming characteristic of the country.[374] Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs.[373]\n\n\nThe BBC National Orchestra of Wales performs in Wales and internationally. The Welsh National Opera is based at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay, while the National Youth Orchestra of Wales was the first of its type in the world.[375] Wales has a tradition of producing notable singers in both the classical and pop arenas,[376] as well as some popular bands.[377][378][379] The Welsh folk music scene has enjoyed a resurgence in the 21st century.[380]\n\n\n\n#### Drama[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cinema of Wales and List of Welsh television series\n\n![](image)Catherine Zeta-Jones, born in Swansea\nThe earliest surviving Welsh plays are two medieval miracle plays, *Y Tri Brenin o Gwlen* (\"The three Kings from Cologne\") and *Y Dioddefaint a'r Atgyfodiad* (\"The Passion and the Resurrection\").[381] A recognised Welsh tradition of theatre emerged during the 18th century, in the form of an interlude, a metrical play performed at fairs and markets.[382] Drama in the early 20th century thrived, but the country established neither a Welsh National Theatre nor a national ballet company.[383] After the Second World War, the substantial number of amateur theatre companies reduced by two thirds.[384] Competition from television in the mid-20th century led to greater professionalism in the theatre.[384] Plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton and Anthony Hopkins, were establishing international reputations.[384][385][386] Wales has also produced some well-known comedians.[387]\n\n\n\n#### Dance[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Welsh dance and Welsh stepdance\n\n![](image)Welsh dancer at the Senedd building\nTraditional dances include Welsh folk dancing and clog dancing. The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis, but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out due to religious opposition.[383] In the 20th century a revival was led by Lois Blake (1890\u20131974).[383] Clog dancing was preserved and developed by Hywel Wood (1882\u20131967) and others who perpetuated the art on local and national stages.[388] The Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded in 1949.[388] Contemporary dance grew out of Cardiff in the 1970s.[388] The National Dance Company Wales, formed in 1983, is now resident at the Wales Millennium Centre.[389]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Wales portal\n\n\n* List of movements in Wales\n* Outline of Wales\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The earliest instance of *Lloegyr* occurs in the early 10th-century prophetic poem *Armes Prydein*. It seems comparatively late as a place name, the nominative plural *Lloegrwys*, \"men of *Lloegr*\", being earlier and more common. The English were sometimes referred to as an entity in early poetry (*Saeson*, as today) but just as often as *Eingl* (Angles), *Iwys* (Wessex-men), etc. *Lloegr* and *Sacson* became the norm later when England emerged as a kingdom. As for its origins, some scholars have suggested that it originally referred only to Mercia \u2013 at that time a powerful kingdom and for centuries the main foe of the Welsh. It was then applied to the new kingdom of England as a whole (see for instance Rachel Bromwich (ed.), *Trioedd Ynys Prydein*, University of Wales Press, 1987). \"The lost land\" and other fanciful meanings, such as Geoffrey of Monmouth's monarch Locrinus, have no etymological basis. (See also Discussion in Reference 40)\n2. **^** The title *Prince of Wales* is still conferred on the heir apparent to the British throne, currently Prince William, but he has no constitutional role in modern Wales.[106] According to the Welsh Government in 2008: \"Our Prince of Wales at the moment is Prince Charles, who is the present heir to the throne. But he does not have a role in the governance of Wales, even though his title might suggest that he does.\"[105]\n3. **^** \"Latin: *Ambrosius vocor, id est, Embreis Guletic.*, lit.\u2009'\"I am called Ambrosius, that is Embreis Guletic\"'.[308] Embreis Guletic is probably Emrys Gwledig.\n4. **^** Wales is not separately represented on the Union Jack as, at the time of the flag's creation, Wales was considered part of England.[317]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n**Citations**\n\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** UK Census (2021). \"2021 Census Area Profile \u2013 Wales Country (W92000004)\". *Nomis*.

'This constitutional vacuum', Jonathan Dimbleby, biographer of the Prince of Wales, has noted, 'was not an oversight, but documentary evidence of the peculiar position that the heir apparent occupies; there is no formal \"role\", except to wait.'\n107. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"StackPath\". *www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk*. 11 April 2018.

It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country as of June 2023;[22][23] and from the time of its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy.[24][25][26] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.\n\n\nModern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[27][28][29]\nTheir long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[30] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[31]\nBy 1200\u00a0BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[32][33] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the *Rigveda*. Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely vigilant, the *Rigveda* records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[34] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[35]\nBy 400\u00a0BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[36]\nand Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[37]\nEarly political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[38]\nTheir collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[39] but also marked by the declining status of women,[40] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[k][41] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[42]\n\n\nIn the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts.[43]\nMuslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains,[44]\neventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[45]\nIn the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[46]\nIn the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[47]\nThe Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[48]\nleaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[l][49]\nGradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[50] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[51][52] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root.[53] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[54][55] In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[56][57][58][59] a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[60]\n\n\nIndia has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost 1.4\u00a0billion in 2022.[61]\nDuring the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[62] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[63] India has a space programme with several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. It is the fourth country to land a craft on the moon and the first to do so within 600 kilometres (370\u00a0mi) of the Lunar south pole.[64] Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[65] India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[66] India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[67] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[68] and rising levels of air pollution.[69] India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[70] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[71] India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture,[72] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names for India\n\nAccording to the *Oxford English Dictionary* (third edition 2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin *India*, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east. In turn the name \"India\" derived successively from Hellenistic Greek *India* ( *\u1f38\u03bd\u03b4\u03af\u03b1*), ancient Greek *Indos* ( *\u1f38\u03bd\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2*), Old Persian *Hindush* (an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire), and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit *Sindhu*, or \"river\", specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[73][74] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as *Indoi* (*\u1f38\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03af*), which translates as \"The people of the Indus\".[75]\n\n\nThe term *Bharat* (*Bh\u0101rat*; pronounced [\u02c8b\u02b1a\u02d0\u027e\u0259t] \u24d8), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[76][77] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name *Bharatavarsha*, which applied originally to North India,[78][79] *Bharat* gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[76][80]\n\n\n*Hindustan* ([\u0266\u026and\u028a\u02c8sta\u02d0n] \u24d8) is a Middle Persian name for India that became popular by the 13th century,[81] and was used widely since the era of the Mughal Empire. The meaning of *Hindustan* has varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.[76][80][82]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of India and History of the Republic of India\n\n### Ancient India[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Manuscript illustration, c.\u20091650, of the Sanskrit epic Ramayana, composed in story-telling fashion c.\u2009400\u00a0BCE\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009300\u00a0CE[83]\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or *Homo sapiens*, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[27][28][29] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[27] After 6500\u00a0BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.[84] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[85][84] the first urban culture in South Asia,[86] which flourished during 2500\u20131900\u00a0BCE in Pakistan and western India.[87] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[86]\n\n\nDuring the period 2000\u2013500\u00a0BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[88] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[89] were composed during this period,[90] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[88] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[89] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[91] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[88] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[92] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[92]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cave 26 of the rock-cut Ajanta Caves\nIn the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the *mahajanapadas*.[93][94] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[95] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[96][97][98] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[99] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[100] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[101][102] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist *dhamma*.[103][104]\n\n\nThe Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200\u00a0BCE and 200\u00a0CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and Southeast Asia.[105][106] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[107][100] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[108][109] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[110] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[109] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[109]\n\n\n\n### Medieval India[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nBrihadeshwara temple, Thanjavur, completed in 1010\u00a0CE\n![](image)\nThe Qutub Minar, 73\u00a0m (240\u00a0ft) tall, completed by the Sultan of Delhi, Iltutmish\n\nThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200\u00a0CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[111] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647\u00a0CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[112] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[112] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[112] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[111] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[113] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[113]\n\n\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[114] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[114] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[115] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[115] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[116] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[116]\n\n\nAfter the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[117] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[118][119] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[120][121] The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[122] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[123] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[122]\n\n\n\n### Early modern India[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[124] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[125] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[126][127] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[128] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[129] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[128] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[130] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[131] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[129] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,[129] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[132] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[133] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[133] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[134]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA distant view of the Taj Mahal from the Agra Fort\n![](image)\nA two mohur Company gold coin, issued in 1835, the obverse inscribed \"William IV, King\"\n\nBy the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[135][136] The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[137][135][138][139] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[140] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.[135] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture.[141]\n\n\n\n### Modern India[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Republic of India\n\nHistorians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes\u2014among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph\u2014were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[142][143][144][145] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[146][147] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[148][149] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[150][151][152][153]\n\n\nThe rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[154] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[155] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[156] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[157] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[158] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[158] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[157]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n1909 map of the British Indian Empire\n![](image)\nJawaharlal Nehru sharing a light moment with Mahatma Gandhi, Mumbai, 6 July 1946\n\nAfter World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[159] a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mahatma Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[160] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[161] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War\u00a0II, the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.[162]\n\n\nVital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic.[163] Per the London Declaration, India retained its membership of the Commonwealth, becoming the first republic within it.[164] Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1980s and the collaboration with Soviet Union for technical know-how,[165] has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world's fastest-growing economies,[166] and increased its geopolitical clout. Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban;[167] by religious and caste-related violence;[168] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[169] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India.[170] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China[171] and with Pakistan.[171] India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.[172]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of India\n\nIndia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[173] India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[173] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[173] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[173] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[174] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[175] The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis.[176][177][178]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Tungabhadra, with rocky outcrops, flows into the peninsular Krishna river.[179]\n![](image)\nFishing boats lashed together in a tidal creek in Anjarle village, Maharashtra\n\nThe remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east.[180] To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats;[181] the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6\u00b0 44\u2032 and 35\u00b0 30\u2032 north latitude[m] and 68\u00b0 7\u2032 and 97\u00b0 25\u2032 east longitude.[182]\n\n\nIndia's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700\u00a0mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400\u00a0mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300\u00a0mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.[183] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.[183]\n\n\nMajor Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal.[184] Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes.[185][186] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;[187] and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea.[188] Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.[189] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.[190]\n\n\nIndian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons.[191] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.[192][193] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.[191] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.[194]\n\n\nTemperatures in India have risen by 0.7\u00a0\u00b0C (1.3\u00a0\u00b0F) between 1901 and 2018.[195] Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.[196] According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.[197]\n\n\n\n## Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Forestry in India and Wildlife of India\n\nIndia is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries which display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[198] India is a habitat for 8.6% of all mammal species, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[199][200] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.[201] India also contains four of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots,[70] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[n][202]\n\n\nAccording to official statistics, India's forest cover is 713,789\u00a0km2 (275,595\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), which is 21.71% of the country's total land area.[71] It can be subdivided further into broad categories of *canopy density*, or the proportion of the area of a forest covered by its tree canopy.[203] *Very dense forest*, whose *canopy density* is greater than 70%, occupies 3.02% of India's land area.[203][204] It predominates in the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India. *Moderately dense forest*, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India's land area.[203][204] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous *sal* forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India.[205] *Open forest*, whose canopy density is between 10% and 40%, occupies 9.26% of India's land area.[203][204] India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible.[206]\n\n\nAmong the Indian subcontinent's notable indigenous trees are the astringent *Azadirachta indica*, or *neem*, which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine,[207] and the luxuriant *Ficus religiosa*, or *peepul*,[208] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro,[209] and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.[210]\n\n\nMany Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago.[211] India's subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[212] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the Himalayas.[213] This had the effect of lowering endemism among India's mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[200] Among endemics are the vulnerable[214] hooded leaf monkey[215] and the threatened[216] Beddome's toad[216][217] of the Western Ghats.\n\n\nIndia contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms.[218] These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include the gharial, a crocodilian; the great Indian bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle.[219] Before they were extensively used for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct.[220] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act[221] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988.[222] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and eighteen\u00a0biosphere reserves,[223] four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; seventy-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[224]\n\n\n\n* ![India has the majority of the world's wild tigers, approximately 3,170 in 2022.[225]](image)\n\nIndia has the majority of the world's wild tigers, approximately 3,170 in 2022.[225]\n* ![A chital (Axis axis) stag in the Nagarhole National Park in a region covered by a moderately dense[o] forest.](image)\n\nA chital (*Axis axis*) stag in the Nagarhole National Park in a region covered by a moderately dense[o] forest.\n* ![Three of the last Asiatic cheetahs in India were shot dead in 1948 in Surguja district, Madhya Pradesh, Central India by Maharajah Ramanuj Pratap Singh Deo.

V.[226]\n\nA parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[227] India has six\u00a0recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 50\u00a0regional parties.[228] The Congress is considered centre-left in Indian political culture,[229] and the BJP right-wing.[230][231][232] For most of the period between 1950\u2014when India first became a republic\u2014and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the Parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[233] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the centre.[234]\n\n\nIn the Republic of India's first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; Morarji Desai and Charan Singh. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar.[235] Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.[236]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nUS president Barack Obama addresses the members of the Parliament of India in New Delhi in November 2010.\n\nA two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. There were two prime ministers during this period; H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term.[237] Again in the 2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India's communist parties.[238] That year, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.[239] In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties.[240] In the 2019 general election, the BJP was victorious again. The incumbent prime minister is Narendra Modi, a former chief minister of Gujarat. On 22 July 2022, Droupadi Murmu was elected India's 15th president and took the oath of office on 25 July 2022.[241]\n\n\n\n### Government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of India and Constitution of India\n\n![](image)\nRashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India, was designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker for the Viceroy of India, and constructed between 1911 and 1931 during the British Raj.[242]\n\nIndia is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India\u2014the country's supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic.\n\n\nFederalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[243] originally stated India to be a \"sovereign, democratic republic;\" this characterisation was amended in 1971 to \"a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic\".[244] India's form of government, traditionally described as \"quasi-federal\" with a strong centre and weak states,[245] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.[246][247]\n\n\n\n\n\nNational symbols[1]| Emblem | Sarnath Lion Capital |\n| Anthem | *Jana Gana Mana* |\n| Song | \"Vande Mataram\" |\n| Language | None[248][249][250] |\n| Currency | \u20b9 (Indian rupee) |\n| Calendar | Shaka |\n| Bird | Indian peafowl |\n| Flower | Lotus |\n| Fruit | Mango |\n| Mammal | * Bengal tiger\n* River dolphin\n |\n| Tree | Banyan |\n| River | Ganges |\n\n\nThe Government of India comprises three branches:[251]\n\n\n\n* Executive: The President of India is the ceremonial head of state,[252] who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an electoral college comprising members of national and state legislatures.[253][254] The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive power.[255] Appointed by the president,[256] the prime minister is by convention supported by the party or political alliance having a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.[255] The executive of the Indian government consists of the president, the vice-president, and the Union Council of Ministers\u2014with the cabinet being its executive committee\u2014headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament.[252] In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the executive are implemented by them.[257]\n* Legislature: The legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. Operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of the People).[258] The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245\u00a0members who serve staggered six-year terms.[259] Most are elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population.[256] All but two of the Lok Sabha's 545\u00a0members are elected directly by popular vote; they represent single-member constituencies for five-year\u00a0terms.[260] Two seats of parliament, reserved for Anglo-Indians in the article 331, have been scrapped.[261][262]\n* Judiciary: India has a three-tier\u00a0unitary independent judiciary[263] comprising the supreme court, headed by the Chief Justice of India, 25\u00a0high courts, and a large number of trial courts.[263] The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high courts.[264] It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution[265] and invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.[266]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of India\n\nSee also: Political integration of India\n\nIndia is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.[13] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[267] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.[268]\n\n\n\n![](image)A clickable map of the 28 states and 8 union territories of India\n  \n\n\n\n\n#### States[edit]\n\n\n1.

Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the third, the 1971 war, followed from India's support for the independence of Bangladesh.[273] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d'\u00e9tat attempt in the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[274]\n\n\nAside from its ongoing special relationship with Russia,[275] India has wide-ranging defence relations with Israel and France. In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other multilateral forums.[276] India has close economic ties with countries in South America,[277] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a \"Look East\" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional security.[278][279]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Indian Air Force contingent marching at the 221st Bastille Day military parade in Paris, on 14 July 2009. The parade at which India was the foreign guest was led by India's oldest regiment, the Maratha Light Infantry, founded in 1768.[280]\n\nChina's nuclear test of 1964, as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India to develop nuclear weapons.[281] India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out additional underground testing in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.[282] India maintains a \"no first use\" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its \"Minimum Credible Deterrence\" doctrine.[283][284] It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, a fifth-generation fighter jet.[285][286] Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of *Vikrant*-class aircraft carriers and *Arihant*-class nuclear submarines.[287]\n\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union.[288] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[289] India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[290] France,[291] the United Kingdom,[292] and Canada.[293]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India (left, background) in talks with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico during a visit to Mexico, 2016\n\nThe President of India is the supreme commander of the nation's armed forces; with 1.45\u00a0million active troops, they compose the world's second-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard.[294] The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03\u00a0billion, or 1.83% of GDP.[295] Defence expenditure was pegged at US$70.12\u00a0billion for fiscal year 2022\u201323 and, increased 9.8% than previous fiscal year.[296][297] India is the world's second-largest arms importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total global arms imports.[298] Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.[299] In May 2017, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the South Asia Satellite, a gift from India to its neighbouring SAARC countries.[300] In October 2018, India signed a US$5.43\u00a0billion (over \u20b9400\u00a0billion) agreement with Russia to procure four S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defence systems, Russia's most advanced long-range missile defence system.[301]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of India\n\n![](image)\nA farmer in northwestern Karnataka ploughs his field with a tractor even as another in a field beyond does the same with a pair of oxen. In 2019, 43% of India's total workforce was employed in agriculture.[302]\n![](image)\nIndia is the world's largest producer of milk, with the largest population of cattle. In 2018, nearly 80% of India's milk was sourced from small farms with herd size between one and two, the milk harvested by hand milking.[304]\n![](image)\nWomen tend to a recently planted rice field in Junagadh district in Gujarat. 55% of India's female workforce was employed in agriculture in 2019.[303]\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2022 was nominally worth $3.46\u00a0trillion; it was the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates and is, around $11.6\u00a0trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).[305] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011\u20132012,[306] India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies.[307] However, the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in GDP per capita at PPP.[308] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[309] since then, it has moved increasingly towards a free-market system[310][311] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[312] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.[313]\n\n\nThe 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world's second-largest, as of 2017[update].[294] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India's foreign exchange remittances of US$100\u00a0billion in 2022,[314] highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries.[315] Major agricultural products include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[13] Major industries include textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[13] In 2006, the share of external trade in India's GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[310] In 2008, India's share of world trade was 1.68%;[316] In 2021, India was the world's ninth-largest importer and the sixteenth-largest exporter.[317] Major exports include petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and manufactured leather goods.[13] Major imports include crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals.[13] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.[318] India was the world's second-largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year.[319]\n\n\nAveraging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007,[310] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century.[320] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India's middle classes are projected to number around 580\u00a0million by 2030.[321] Though ranking 68th in global competitiveness,[322] as of 2010[update], India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of several advanced economies.[323] With seven of the world's top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in India, as of 2009[update], the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the United States.[324] India is ranked 40th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[325] India's consumer market, the world's eleventh-largest,[*as of?*] is expected to become fifth-largest by 2030.[321]\n\n\nDriven by growth, India's nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$1,730 in 2016. It is expected to grow to US$2,466 by 2022.[17] However, it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected to remain so in the near future.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA panorama of Bangalore, the centre of India's software development economy. In the 1980s, when the first multinational corporations began to set up centres in India, they chose Bangalore because of the large pool of skilled graduates in the area, in turn due to the many science and engineering colleges in the surrounding region.[326]\n\nAccording to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report, India's GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United States by 2045.[327] During the next four decades, Indian GDP is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050.[327] The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle-class.[327] The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.[328]\n\n\nAccording to the Worldwide Cost of Living Report 2017 released by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) which was created by comparing more than 400 individual prices across 160 products and services, four of the cheapest cities were in India: Bangalore (3rd), Mumbai (5th), Chennai (5th) and New Delhi (8th).[329]\n\n\n\n### Industries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nA tea garden in Sikkim. India, the world's second-largest producer of tea, is a nation of one billion tea drinkers, who consume 70% of India's tea output.\n\nIndia's telecommunication industry is the second-largest in the world with over 1.2\u00a0billion subscribers. It contributes 6.5% to India's GDP.[330] After the third quarter of 2017, India surpassed the US to become the second-largest smartphone market in the world after China.[331]\n\n\nThe Indian automotive industry, the world's second-fastest growing, increased domestic sales by 26% during 2009\u20132010,[332] and exports by 36% during 2008\u20132009.[333] In 2022, India became the world's third-largest vehicle market after China and the United States, surpassing Japan.[334] At the end of 2011, the Indian IT industry employed 2.8\u00a0million professionals, generated revenues close to US$100\u00a0billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP, and contributed 26% of India's merchandise exports.[335]\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry in India emerged as a global player. As of 2021, with 3000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500 manufacturing units India is the world's third-largest pharmaceutical producer, largest producer of generic medicines and supply up to 50\u201460% of global vaccines demand, these all contribute up to US$24.44\u00a0billions in exports and India's local pharmaceutical market is estimated up to US$42\u00a0billion.[336][337] India is among the top 12 biotech destinations in the world.[338][339] The Indian biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012\u20132013, increasing its revenues from \u20b9204.4\u00a0billion (Indian rupees) to \u20b9235.24\u00a0billion (US$3.94\u00a0billion at June 2013 exchange rates).[340]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Energy in India and Energy policy of India\n\nIndia's capacity to generate electrical power is 300 gigawatts, of which 42 gigawatts is renewable.[341] The country's usage of coal is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions by India but its renewable energy is competing strongly.[342] India emits about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This equates to about 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half the world average.[343][344] Increasing access to electricity and clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for energy in India.[345]\n\n\n\n### Socio-economic challenges[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nHealth workers about to begin another day of immunisation against infectious diseases in 2006. Eight years later, and three years after India's last case of polio, the World Health Organization declared India to be polio-free.[346]\n\nDespite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the largest number of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day.[347] The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005.[348] Under the World Bank's later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011.[p][350] 30.7% of India's children under the age of five are underweight.[351] According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished.[352][353] The Mid-Day Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates.[354]\n\n\nA 2018 Walk Free Foundation report estimated that nearly 8\u00a0million people in India were living in different forms of modern slavery, such as bonded labour, child labour, human trafficking, and forced begging, among others.[355] According to the 2011 census, there were 10.1\u00a0million child labourers in the country, a decline of 2.6\u00a0million from 12.6\u00a0million in 2001.[356]\n\n\nSince 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest.[357] Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018 with a score of 41 out of 100, an improvement from 85th in 2014.[358][359]\n\n\nEpidemic and pandemic diseases have long been a major factor, including COVID-19 recently.[360]\n\n\n\n## Demographics, languages and religion[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of India, Languages of India, and Religion in India\n\nSee also: South Asian ethnic groups\n\nIndia by language\n![](image)\nThe language families of South Asia\n\nWith 1,210,193,422 residents reported in the 2011 provisional census report,[361] India was the world's second-most populous country.[q] Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011,[363] compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991\u20132001).[363] The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males.[361] The median age was 28.7 as of 2020[update].[294] The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361\u00a0million people.[364] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the \"Green Revolution\" have caused India's population to grow rapidly.[365]\n\n\nThe life expectancy in India is at 70 years\u201471.5 years for women, 68.7 years for men.[294] There are around 93 physicians per 100,000 people.[366] Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India's recent history. The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001.[367] Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural areas.[368][369] The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991.[370] According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population.[371] The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males.[372] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas.[370] Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%.[372]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe interior of San Thome Basilica, Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Christianity is believed to have been introduced to India by the late 2nd century by Syriac-speaking Christians.\n\nAmong speakers of the Indian languages, 74% speak Indo-Aryan languages, the easternmost branch of the Indo-European languages; 24% speak Dravidian languages, indigenous to South Asia and spoken widely before the spread of Indo-Aryan languages and 2% speak Austroasiatic languages or the Sino-Tibetan languages. India has no national language.[373] Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government.[374][375] English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a \"subsidiary official language\";[6] it is important in education, especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 \"scheduled languages\".\n\n\nThe 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by Islam (14.23%); the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and others[r] (0.9%).[12] India has the third-largest Muslim population\u2014the largest for a non-Muslim majority country.[376][377]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of India\n\n![](image)\nA Sikh pilgrim at the Harmandir Sahib, or Golden Temple, in Amritsar, Punjab\n\nIndian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[378] During the Vedic period (c.\u20091700\u00a0BCE\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009500\u00a0BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as *dh\u00e1rma*, *k\u00e1rma*, *y\u00f3ga*, and *mok\u1e63a*, were established.[75] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions.[379] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the *Upanishads*,[380] the *Yoga Sutras*, the *Bhakti* movement,[379] and by Buddhist philosophy.[381]\n\n\n\n### Visual art[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian art\n\nIndia has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[382] Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The \"Pashupati\" seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928\u201329, is the best known.[383][384] After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[384][385] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement.[386][387][388] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[389] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing *prana* (\"breath\" or life-force).[390][391] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.[392][393]\n\n\nMost of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati,[394] or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.[395][396] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.[397] Gupta art, at its peak c.\u2009300\u00a0CE\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009500\u00a0CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves.[398][399] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c.\u2009800\u00a0CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[400] But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.[401][402]\n\n\nAncient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times.[403][404] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings.[405] The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[406][407] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nih\u00e2l Chand and Nainsukh.[408][409] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence.[410][411] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern Indian painting.[412][413]\n\n\n\n* ![Bhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs from Mathura, 2nd century\u00a0CE](image)\n\nBhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs from Mathura, 2nd century\u00a0CE\n* ![Gupta terracotta relief, Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th century](image)\n\nGupta terracotta relief, Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th century\n* ![Elephanta Caves, triple-bust (trimurti) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5\u00a0m) tall, c.\u2009550](image)\n\nElephanta Caves, triple-bust (*trimurti*) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5\u00a0m) tall, c.\u2009550\n* ![Chola bronze of Shiva as Nataraja (\"Lord of Dance\"), Tamil Nadu, 10th or 11th century](image)\n\nChola bronze of Shiva as Nataraja (\"Lord of Dance\"), Tamil Nadu, 10th or 11th century\n* ![Jahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign, Balchand, c.\u20091635](image)\n\n*Jahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign*, Balchand, c.\u20091635\n* ![Krishna Fluting to the Milkmaids, Kangra painting, 1775\u20131785](image)\n\n*Krishna Fluting to the Milkmaids*, Kangra painting, 1775\u20131785\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of India\n\n![](image)\nThe Taj Mahal from across the Yamuna river showing two outlying red sandstone buildings, a mosque on the right (west) and a *jawab* (response) thought to have been built for architectural balance\n\nMuch of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Indo-Islamic Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.[414] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours. *Vastu shastra*, literally \"science of construction\" or \"architecture\" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,[415] explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;[416] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs.[417] As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the *Shilpa Shastras*, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the *Vastu-Purusha mandala*, a square that embodied the \"absolute\".[418] The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\".[419] Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.[420]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian literature\n\nThe earliest literature in India, composed between 1500\u00a0BCE and 1200\u00a0CE, was in the Sanskrit language.[421] Major works of Sanskrit literature include the *Rigveda* (c.\u20091500\u00a0BCE\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091200\u00a0BCE), the epics: *Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata* (c.\u2009400\u00a0BCE\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009400\u00a0CE) and the *Ramayana* (c.\u2009300\u00a0BCE and later); *Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntalam* (*The Recognition of \u015aakuntal\u0101*, and other dramas of K\u0101lid\u0101sa (c.\u20095th century\u00a0CE) and *Mah\u0101k\u0101vya* poetry.[422][423][424] In Tamil literature, the Sangam literature (c.\u2009600\u00a0BCE\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009300\u00a0BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work.[425][426][427][428] From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kab\u012br, Tuls\u012bd\u0101s, and Guru N\u0101nak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.[429] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of the Bengali poet, author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore,[430] who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n\n\n### Performing arts and media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of India, Dance in India, Cinema of India, and Television in India\n\n![](image)\nIndia's National Academy of Performance Arts has recognised eight Indian dance styles to be *classical*. One such is Kuchipudi shown here.\n\nIndian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and the southern Carnatic schools.[431] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the *bauls* is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are: *bhangra* of Punjab, *bihu* of Assam, *Jhumair* and *chhau* of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, *garba* and *dandiya* of Gujarat, *ghoomar* of Rajasthan, and *lavani* of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: *bharatanatyam* of the state of Tamil Nadu, *kathak* of Uttar Pradesh, *kathakali* and *mohiniyattam* of Kerala, *kuchipudi* of Andhra Pradesh, *manipuri* of Manipur, *odissi* of Odisha, and the *sattriya* of Assam.[432]\n\n\nTheatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.[433] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes: the *bhavai* of Gujarat, the *jatra* of West Bengal, the *nautanki* and *ramlila* of North India, *tamasha* of Maharashtra, *burrakatha* of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, *terukkuttu* of Tamil Nadu, and the *yakshagana* of Karnataka.[434] India has a theatre training institute the National School of Drama (NSD) that is situated at New Delhi. It is an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of culture, Government of India.[435]\nThe Indian film industry produces the world's most-watched cinema.[436] Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu languages.[437] The Hindi language film industry (*Bollywood*) is the largest sector representing 43% of box office revenue, followed by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent 36% combined.[438]\n\n\nTelevision broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication and expanded slowly for more than two decades.[439][440] The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s. Since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society.[441] Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012[update] there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462\u00a0million with satellite or cable connections compared to other forms of mass media such as the press (350\u00a0million), radio (156\u00a0million) or internet (37\u00a0million).[442]\n\n\n\n### Society[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nMuslims offer *namaz* at a mosque in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nTraditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as *j\u0101tis*, or \"castes\".[443] India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.\n\n\nFamily values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.[444] An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders.[445] Marriage is thought to be for life,[445] and the divorce rate is extremely low,[446] with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.[447] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.[448] Female infanticide in India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63\u00a0million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period, and constituting 20 percent of India's female electorate.[449] According to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care.[450] Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society.[451] The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines.[452] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.[453]\n\n\nMany Indian festivals are religious in origin. The best known include Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Thai Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi.[454][455]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in India, Literacy in India, and History of education in the Indian subcontinent\n\n![](image)Children awaiting school lunch in Rayka (also Raika), a village in rural Gujarat. The salutation *Jai Bhim* written on the blackboard honours the jurist, social reformer, and Dalit leader B. R. Ambedkar.\nIn the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%,[456][457] According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth.[458]\n\n\nThe education system of India is the world's second-largest.[459] India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges[460] and 1.5\u00a0million schools.[461] In India's higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[462][463]\n\n\n\n### Clothing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Clothing in India\n\n![](image)\nWomen in sari at an adult literacy class in Tamil Nadu\n![](image)\nA man in dhoti and wearing a woollen shawl, in Varanasi\n\nFrom ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped.[464] For women it took the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long.[464] The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder.[464] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end\u2014passing over the shoulder\u2014serving to cover the midriff and obscure the upper body's contours.[464] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[465]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nWomen (from left to right) in churidars and kameez (with back to the camera), jeans and sweater, and pink shalwar kameez\n\nThe use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate (c.\u20091300 CE) and then continued by the Mughal Empire (c.\u20091525 CE).[466] Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez.[466] In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.[466]\n\n\nShalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist.[467] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[468] its side seams left open below the waist-line.[469] The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikan; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer's knees.[470]\n\n\nIn the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[471] The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans.[471] In white-collar office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[471] For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wear bandgala, or short Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars.[471] The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[472]\nis seldom seen in the cities.[471]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian cuisine\n\n![](image)\nSouth Indian vegetarian thali, or platter\n![](image)\nRailway mutton curry from Odisha\n\nThe foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[473] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread made from wheat flour, or occasionally cornmeal, and griddle-cooked dry;[474] the idli, a steamed breakfast cake, or dosa, a griddled pancake, both leavened and made from a batter of rice- and gram meal.[475] The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others as informed by culinary conventions.[473] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking.[476]\n\n\nA platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments, which are often served in small bowls. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is accomplished by mixing\u2014for example of rice and lentils\u2014or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping\u2014such as chapati and cooked vegetables or lentils.[473]\n\n\n\nA tandoor chef in the Turkman Gate, Old Delhi, makes Khameeri roti (a Muslim-influenced style of leavened bread).[477]\nIndia has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[478] The appearance of *ahimsa*, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India's Hindu population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as among Jains.[478] Although meat is eaten widely in India, the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.[479] Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption.[480]\n\n\nThe most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the pilaf,[481] developed in the Abbasid caliphate,[482] and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[483] To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India.[483] Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become the Indian biryani,[483] a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[484] In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine. The popularity of tandoori chicken\u2014cooked in the tandoor oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from Central Asia\u2014dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition of India.[478]\n\n\n\n### Sports and recreation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in India\n\n![](image)\nGirls play hopscotch in Jaora, Madhya Pradesh. Hopscotch has been commonly played by girls in rural India.[485]\n\nSeveral traditional indigenous sports such as *kabaddi*, *kho kho*, *pehlwani* and *gilli-danda*, and also martial arts such as *Kalarippayattu* and *marma adi*, remain popular. Chess is commonly held to have originated in India as *chatura\u1e45ga*;[486] in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of Indian grandmasters.[487] Viswanathan Anand became the Chess World Champion in 2007 and held the status until 2013. He also won the Chess World Cup in 2000 and 2002. In 2023, R Praggnanandhaa finished as runners up in the tournament. [488] Parcheesi is derived from *Pachisi*, another traditional Indian pastime, which in early modern times was played on a giant marble court by Mughal emperor Akbar the Great.[489]\n\n\nCricket is the most popular sport in India.[490] Major domestic leagues include the Indian Premier League. Professional leagues in other sports include the Indian Super League (football) and the Pro Kabaddi league.[491][492][493]\n\n\n\n![](image)Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar about to score a record 14,000 runs in Test cricket while playing against Australia in Bangalore, 2010\nIndia has won two Cricket World Cups, the 1983 edition and the 2011 edition, as well as becoming the inaugural T20 World Cup Champions in 2007. India has also won the Champions Trophy twice, in 2002 and 2013. The only edition of the World Championship of Cricket was won by India in 1985. \n\n\nIndia also has eight field hockey gold medals in the summer olympics.[494]\nThe improved results garnered by the Indian Davis Cup team and other tennis players in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country.[495] India has a comparatively strong presence in shooting sports, and has won several medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships, and the Commonwealth Games.[496][497] Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton[498] (Saina Nehwal and P. V. Sindhu are two of the top-ranked female badminton players in the world), boxing,[499] and wrestling.[500] Football is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states.India has traditionally been the dominant country at the South Asian Games. An example of this dominance is the basketball competition where the Indian team won four out of five tournaments to date.[501][502]\n\n\nIndia has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the 1951 and 1982 Asian Games; the 1987, 1996, 2011 and 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup tournaments (and is also scheduled to host it in 2031); the 1978, 1997 and 2013 ICC Women's Cricket World Cup tournaments (and is also scheduled to host it in 2025); the 1987, 1985 and 2016 South Asian Games; the 1990-91 Men's Asia Cup; the 2002 Chess World Cup; the 2003 Afro-Asian Games; the 2006 ICC Cricket Champion's Trophy (and is also scheduled to host it in 2029); the 2006 Women's Asia Cup; the 2009 World Badminton Championships; the 2010 Hockey World Cup; the 2010 Commonwealth Games; the 2016 ICC Men's Cricket T20 World Cup (and is also scheduled to host it in 2026); the 2016 ICC Women's Cricket T20 World Cup and the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Major international sporting events held annually in India include the Maharashtra Open, the Mumbai Marathon, the Delhi Half Marathon, and the Indian Masters. The first Formula 1 Indian Grand Prix featured in late 2011 but has been discontinued from the F1 season calendar since 2014.[503]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n\n\n* Administrative divisions of India\n* Outline of India\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Originally written in Sanskritised Bengali and adopted as the national anthem in its Hindi translation.\n2. **^** \"[...] *Jana Gana Mana* is the National Anthem of India, subject to such alterations in the words as the Government may authorise as occasion arises; and the song *Vande Mataram*, which has played a historic part in the struggle for Indian freedom, shall be honoured equally with *Jana Gana Mana* and shall have equal status with it.\"[5]\n3. **^** Written in a mixture of Sanskrit and Sanskritised Bengali.\n4. **^** According to Part XVII of the Constitution of India, Hindi in the Devanagari script is the official language of the Union, along with English as an additional official language.[1][6][7] States and union territories can have a different official language of their own other than Hindi or English.\n5. **^** Not all the state-level official languages are in the eighth schedule and not all the scheduled languages are state-level official languages.

Its elite called itself Arya (pure) and distinguished themselves sharply from others. Aryans led kin groups organized as nomadic horse-herding tribes. Their ritual texts are called Vedas, composed in Sanskrit. Vedic Sanskrit is recorded only in hymns that were part of Vedic rituals to Aryan gods. To be Aryan apparently meant to belong to the elite among pastoral tribes. Texts that record Aryan culture are not precisely datable, but they seem to begin around 1200 BCE with four collections of Vedic hymns (Rg, Sama, Yajur, and Artharva).\"\n  \n(d) Dyson 2018, pp.\u00a014\u201315, \"Although the collapse of the Indus valley civilization is no longer believed to have been due to an 'Aryan invasion' it is widely thought that, at roughly the same time, or perhaps a few centuries later, new Indo-Aryan-speaking people and influences began to enter the subcontinent from the north-west. Detailed evidence is lacking. Nevertheless, a predecessor of the language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was probably introduced into the north-west sometime between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago. This language was related to one then spoken in eastern Iran; and both of these languages belonged to the Indo-European language family. ... It seems likely that various small-scale migrations were involved in the gradual introduction of the predecessor language and associated cultural characteristics. However, there may not have been a tight relationship between movements of people on the one hand, and changes in language and culture on the other. Moreover, the process whereby a dynamic new force gradually arose\u2014a people with a distinct ideology who eventually seem to have referred to themselves as 'Arya'\u2014was certainly two-way. That is, it involved a blending of new features which came from outside with other features\u2014probably including some surviving Harappan influences\u2014that were already present. Anyhow, it would be quite a few centuries before Sanskrit was written down. And the hymns and stories of the Arya people\u2014especially the Vedas and the later Mahabharata and Ramayana epics\u2014are poor guides as to historical events. Of course, the emerging Arya were to have a huge impact on the history of the subcontinent. Nevertheless, little is known about their early presence.\";   \n (e) Robb 2011, pp.\u00a046\u2013, \"The expansion of Aryan culture is supposed to have begun around 1500 BCE. It should not be thought that this Aryan emergence (though it implies some migration) necessarily meant either a sudden invasion of new peoples, or a complete break with earlier traditions. It comprises a set of cultural ideas and practices, upheld by a Sanskrit-speaking elite, or Aryans. The features of this society are recorded in the Vedas.\"\n34. **^** (a) Jamison, Stephanie; Brereton, Joel (2020), *The Rigveda*, Oxford University Press, pp.\u00a02, 4, ISBN\u00a0978-0-19-063339-4, The RgVeda is one of the four Vedas, which together constitute the oldest texts in Sanskrit and the earliest evidence for what will become Hinduism.

Gods like Visnu and Siva (under the name Rudra), who will become so dominant later, are already present in the Rgveda, though in roles both lesser than and different from those they will later play, and the principal Rgvedic gods like Indra remain in later Hinduism, though in diminished capacity (p. 4).;  \n(b) Flood, Gavin (2020), \"Introduction\", in Gavin Flood (ed.), *The Oxford History of Hinduism: Hindu Practice: Hindu Practice*, Oxford University Press, pp.\u00a04\u2013, ISBN\u00a0978-0-19-105322-1, I take the term 'Hinduism to meaningfully denote a range and history of practice characterised by a number of features, particularly reference to Vedic textual and sacrificial origins, belonging to endogamous social units (jati/varna), participating in practices that involve making an offering to a deity and receiving a blessing (puja), and a first-level cultural polytheism (although many Hindus adhere to a second-level monotheism in which many gods are regarded as emanations or manifestations of the one, supreme being).;  \n(c) Michaels, Axel (2017).

Most other rituals have lost their popularity, are combined with other rites of passage, or are drastically shortened. Although *samskaras* vary from region to region, from class (*varna*) to class, and from caste to caste, their core elements remain the same owing to the common source, the Veda, and a common priestly tradition preserved by the *Brahmin* priests.

Geographical location, personal and popular sentiment, and substantial pressure and incentives from the new governments led almost all princes eventually to merge their domains into either Pakistan or India. ... Each new government asserted its exclusive sovereignty within its borders, realigning all territories, animals, plants, minerals, and all other natural and human-made resources as either Pakistani or Indian property, to be used for its national development...

She also demonstrates that the new national states of India and Pakistan were quickly drawn into trying to stem this migration. As they put into place laws designed to restrict the return of partition emigrants, this produced new dilemmas for both new nations in their treatment of 'overseas Indians'; and many of them lost their right to return to their places of origin in the subcontinent, and also their claims to full citizenship in host countries.\n58. **^** Talbot, Ian; Singh, Gurharpal (2009), *The Partition of India*, Cambridge University Press, ISBN\u00a0978-0-521-85661-4, archived from the original on 13 December 2016, retrieved 15 November 2015, When the British divided and quit India in August 1947, they not only partitioned the subcontinent with the emergence of the two nations of India and Pakistan but also the provinces of Punjab and Bengal. ...

They heard about it on the radio, from relations and friends, by reading newspapers and, later, through government pamphlets. Among a population of almost four hundred million, where the vast majority live in the countryside, ploughing the land as landless peasants or sharecroppers, it is hardly surprising that many thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, did not hear the news for many weeks afterwards. For some, the butchery and forced relocation of the summer months of 1947 may have been the first that they knew about the creation of the two new states rising from the fragmentary and terminally weakened British empire in India\n60. **^** (a) Copland 2001, pp.\u00a071\u201378;  \n(b) Metcalf & Metcalf 2006, p.\u00a0222.\n61. **^** Dyson 2018, pp.\u00a0219, 262\n62. **^** Fisher 2018, p.\u00a08\n63. **^** Metcalf & Metcalf 2012, pp.\u00a0265\u2013266\n64. **^** Kumar, Hari; Travelli, Alex; Mashal, Mujib; Chang, Kenneth (23 August 2023), \"'India Is on the Moon': Lander's Success Moves Nation to Next Space Chapter\", *The New York Times*, Two visitors from India \u2014 a lander named Vikram and a rover named Pragyan \u2014 landed in the southern polar region of the moon on Wednesday.

It also hoped to get, once and for all, the upper hand in their shadowing competition.\n  \n(b) Chubb, Andrew (2021), \"The Sino-Indian Border Crisis: Chinese Perceptions of Indian Nationalism\", in Golley, Jane; Jaivan, Linda; Strange, Sharon (eds.), *Crisis*, Australian National University Press, pp.\u00a0231\u2013232, ISBN\u00a0978-1-76046-439-4, The ensuing cycle of escalation culminated in the 1962 Sino-Indian border war in which Mao Zedong's troops overran almost the entire state of Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern sector before unilaterally withdrawing, as if to underline the insult; most of the war's several thousand casualties were Indian. The PLA's decisive victories in the 1962 war not only humiliated the Indian Army, they also entrenched a status quo in Ladakh that was highly unfavourable for India, in which China controls almost all of the disputed territory. A nationalistic press and commentariat have kept 1962 vivid in India's popular consciousness.\n  \n(c) Lintner, Bertil (2018), *China's India War: Collision Course on the Roof of the World*, Oxford University Press, ISBN\u00a0978-0-19-909163-8, Lin Biao was put in charge of the operation and that alliance between Mao and his loyal de facto chief of the PLA made the attack on India possible. With China's ultimate victory in the war, Mao's ultra-leftist line had won in China; whatever critical voices that were left in the Party after all the purges fell silent.\n  \n(d) Medcalf, Rory (2020), *Indo-Pacific Empire: China, America and the contest for the world's pivotal*, Manchester University Press, ISBN\u00a0978-1-5261-5077-6, From an Indian perspective, the China-India war of 1962 was a shocking betrayal of the principles of co-operation and coexistence: a surprise attack that humiliated India and personally broke Nehru.\n  \n(e) Ganguly, Sumit (1997), *The Crisis in Kashmir: Portents of War, Hope of Peace*, Woodrow Wilson Center Press and Cambridge University Press, p.\u00a044, ISBN\u00a0978-0-521-65566-8, In October 1962 India suffered the most humiliating military debacle in its post-independence history, at the hands of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA). The outcome of this conflict had far-reaching consequences for Indian foreign and defence policies. The harsh defeat that the Chinese PLA had inflicted on the Indian Army called into question some of the most deeply held precepts of Nehru's foreign and defence policies.\n  \n(f) Raghavan, Srinath (2019), \"A Missed Opportunity?

These misjudgments would eventually culminate in India's humiliating defeat in the war of October\u2013November 1962.\n272. **^** Brahma Chellaney (2006). *Asian Juggernaut: The Rise of China, India, and Japan*.

In this manner, Central Asian cooking merged with older traditions within the subcontinent, to create such signature dishes as biryani (a fusion of the Persian pilau and the spice-laden dishes of Hindustan), and the Kashmiri meat stew of Rogan Josh. It not only generated new dishes and entire cuisines, but also fostered novel modes of eating. Such newer trends included the consumption of Persian condiments, which relied heavily on almonds, pastries and quince jams, alongside Indian achars made from sweet limes, green vegetables and curds as side relishes during Mughlai meals.\n477. **^** Panjabi, Camellia (1995), *The Great Curries of India*, Simon and Schuster, pp.\u00a0158\u2013, ISBN\u00a0978-0-684-80383-8, The Muslim influenced breads of India are leavened, like *naan*, *Khamiri roti*, ...\n478. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Davidson, Alan (2014), *The Oxford Companion to Food*, Oxford University Press, p.\u00a0410, ISBN\u00a0978-0-19-967733-7\n479. **^** Sahakian, Marlyne; Saloma, Czarina; Erkman, Suren (2016), *Food Consumption in the City: Practices and patterns in urban Asia and the Pacific*, Taylor & Francis, p.\u00a050, ISBN\u00a0978-1-317-31050-1\n480. **^** OECD; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2018), *OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2018\u20132027*, OECD Publishing, p.\u00a021, ISBN\u00a0978-92-64-06203-0\n481. **^** Roger 2000.\n482. **^** Sengupta, Jayanta (2014), \"India\", in Freedman, Paul; Chaplin, Joyce E.; Albala, Ken (eds.), *Food in Time and Place: The American Historical Association Companion to Food History*, University of California Press, p.\u00a074, ISBN\u00a0978-0-520-27745-8\n483. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Collingham, Elizabeth M.

Australia is the oldest,[19] flattest,[20] and driest inhabited continent,[21][22] with the least fertile soils.[23][24] It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates, with deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east, tropical savannas in the north, and mountain ranges in the south-east. \n\n\nThe ancestors of Aboriginal Australians began arriving from south-east Asia 50,000 to 65,000 years ago, during the last glacial period.[25][26][27] Arriving by sea, they settled the continent and had formed approximately 250 distinct language groups by the time of European settlement, maintaining some of the longest known continuing artistic and religious traditions in the world.[28] Australia's written history commenced with the European maritime exploration of Australia. The Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon was the first known European to reach Australia, in 1606. In 1770, the British explorer James Cook mapped and claimed the east coast of Australia for Great Britain, and the First Fleet of British ships arrived at Sydney in 1788 to establish the penal colony of New South Wales. The European population grew in subsequent decades, and by the end of the 1850s gold rush, most of the continent had been explored by European settlers and an additional five self-governing British colonies established. Democratic parliaments were gradually established through the 19th century, culminating with a vote for the federation of the six colonies and foundation of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901.[29] This began a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the *Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942*, and culminating in the *Australia Act 1986*.[29]\n\n\nAustralia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising six states and ten territories. Australia's population of nearly 27 million[11] is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard.[30] Canberra is the nation's capital, while its most populous cities are Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide.[31] It is ethnically diverse and multicultural, the product of large-scale immigration, with almost half of the population having at least one parent born overseas.[32] Australia's abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade relations are crucial to the country's economy, which generates its income from various sources including services, mining exports, banking, manufacturing, agriculture and international education.[33][34][35] Australia ranks highly for quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, civil liberties and political rights.[36]\n\n\nAustralia has a highly developed market economy and one of the highest per capita incomes globally.[37][38] Australia is a regional power, and has the world's thirteenth-highest military expenditure.[39] It is a member of international groupings including the United Nations; the G20; the OECD; the World Trade Organization; Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation; the Pacific Islands Forum; the Pacific Community; the Commonwealth of Nations; and the defence/security organisations ANZUS, AUKUS, and the Five Eyes. It is a major non-NATO ally of the United States.[40]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Name of Australia\n\n\n\n\nThe name *Australia* (pronounced /\u0259\u02c8stre\u026ali\u0259/ in Australian English[41]) is derived from the Latin *Terra Australis* (\"southern land\"), a name used for a hypothetical continent in the Southern Hemisphere since ancient times.[42] Several sixteenth century cartographers used the word Australia on maps, but not to identify modern Australia.[43] When Europeans began visiting and mapping Australia in the 17th century, the name *Terra Australis* was naturally applied to the new territories.[N 5]\n\n\nUntil the early 19th century, Australia was best known as *New Holland*, a name first applied by the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1644 (as *Nieuw-Holland*) and subsequently anglicised. *Terra Australis* still saw occasional usage, such as in scientific texts.[N 6] The name *Australia* was popularised by the explorer Matthew Flinders, who said it was \"more agreeable to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the Earth\".[49] The first time that *Australia* appears to have been officially used was in April 1817, when Governor Lachlan Macquarie acknowledged the receipt of Flinders' charts of Australia from Lord Bathurst.[50] In December 1817, Macquarie recommended to the Colonial Office that it be formally adopted.[51] In 1824, the Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially by that name.[52] The first official published use of the new name came with the publication in 1830 of *The Australia Directory* by the Hydrographic Office.[53]\n\n\nColloquial names for Australia include \"Oz\" and \"the Land Down Under\" (usually shortened to just \"Down Under\"). Other epithets include \"the Great Southern Land\", \"the Lucky Country\", \"the Sunburnt Country\", and \"the Wide Brown Land\". The latter two both derive from Dorothea Mackellar's 1908 poem \"My Country\".[54]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Australia\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Australian history.\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Prehistory of Australia and Indigenous Australians\n\n![](image)Aboriginal rock art in the Kimberley region of Western Australia\nIndigenous Australians comprise two broad groups: the Aboriginal peoples of the Australian mainland (and surrounding islands including Tasmania), and the Torres Strait Islanders, who are a distinct Melanesian people. Human habitation of the Australian continent is estimated to have begun 50,000 to 65,000 years ago,[25][55][56][26] with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea crossings from what is now Southeast Asia.[57] It is uncertain how many waves of immigration may have contributed to these ancestors of modern Aboriginal Australians.[58][59] The Madjedbebe rock shelter in Arnhem Land is recognised as the oldest site showing the presence of humans in Australia.[60] The oldest human remains found are the Lake Mungo remains, which have been dated to around 41,000 years ago.[61][62]\n\n\nAboriginal Australian culture is one of the oldest continuous cultures on Earth.[63] At the time of first European contact, Aboriginal Australians were complex hunter-gatherers with diverse economies and societies and about 250 different language groups.[64][65] Recent archaeological finds suggest that a population of 750,000 could have been sustained.[66][67] Aboriginal Australians have an oral culture with spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the Dreamtime.[68]\n\n\nThe Torres Strait Islander people first settled their islands around 4000 years ago.[69] Culturally and linguistically distinct from mainland Aboriginal peoples, they were seafarers and obtained their livelihood from seasonal horticulture and the resources of their reefs and seas.[70]\n\n\n\n### European exploration and colonisation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: European maritime exploration of Australia, European land exploration of Australia, and History of Australia (1788\u20131850)\n\n![Landing of Lieutenant James Cook at Botany Bay, 29 April 1770](image)Landing of James Cook at Botany Bay on 29 April 1770 to claim Australia's east coast for Great Britain\nThe northern coasts and waters of Australia were visited sporadically for trade by Makassan fishermen from what is now Indonesia.[71] The first recorded European sighting of the Australian mainland, and the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent, are attributed to the Dutch.[72] The first ship and crew to chart the Australian coast and meet with Aboriginal people was the *Duyfken*, captained by Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon.[73] He sighted the coast of Cape York Peninsula in early 1606, and made landfall on 26 February 1606 at the Pennefather River near the modern town of Weipa on Cape York.[74] Later that year, Spanish explorer Lu\u00eds Vaz de Torres sailed through and navigated the Torres Strait Islands.[75] The Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent \"New Holland\" during the 17th century, and although no attempt at settlement was made,[74] a number of shipwrecks left men either stranded or, as in the case of the *Batavia* in 1629, marooned for mutiny and murder, thus becoming the first Europeans to permanently inhabit the continent.[76] In 1770, Captain James Cook sailed along and mapped the east coast, which he named \"New South Wales\" and claimed for Great Britain.[77]\n\n\nFollowing the loss of its American colonies in 1783, the British Government sent a fleet of ships, the First Fleet, under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip, to establish a new penal colony in New South Wales. A camp was set up and the Union Flag raised at Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, on 26 January 1788,[78][79] a date which later became Australia's national day. Most early convicts were transported for petty crimes and assigned as labourers or servants to \"free settlers\" (non-convict immigrants). While the majority of convicts settled into colonial society once emancipated, convict rebellions and uprisings were also staged, but invariably suppressed under martial law. The 1808 Rum Rebellion, the only successful armed takeover of government in Australia, instigated a two-year period of military rule.[80] The following decade, social and economic reforms initiated by Governor Lachlan Macquarie saw New South Wales transition from a penal colony to a civil society.[81][82]\n\n\nThe indigenous population declined for 150 years following settlement, mainly due to infectious disease.[83] Thousands more died as a result of frontier conflict with settlers.[84]\n\n\n\n### Colonial expansion[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Australia (1788\u20131850) and History of Australia (1851\u20131900)\n\n![A calm body of water is in the foreground.

Forested land rises gently to a peak several kilometres back from the shore.](image)Tasmania's Port Arthur penal settlement is one of eleven UNESCO World Heritage-listed Australian Convict Sites.\nThe British continued to push into other areas of the continent in the early 19th century, initially along the coast. In 1803, a settlement was established in Van Diemen's Land (present-day Tasmania),[85] and in 1813, Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth crossed the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, opening the interior to European settlement.[86] The British claim extended to the whole Australian continent in 1827 when Major Edmund Lockyer established a settlement on King George Sound (modern-day Albany).[87] The Swan River Colony (present-day Perth) was established in 1829, evolving into the largest Australian colony by area, Western Australia.[88] In accordance with population growth, separate colonies were carved from New South Wales: Tasmania in 1825, South Australia in 1836, New Zealand in 1841, Victoria in 1851, and Queensland in 1859.[89] South Australia was founded as a \"free province\"\u2014it was never a penal colony.[90] Western Australia was also founded \"free\" but later accepted transported convicts, the last of which arrived in 1868, decades after transportation had ceased to the other colonies.[91]\n\n\nIn 1823, a Legislative Council nominated by the governor of New South Wales was established, together with a new Supreme Court, thus limiting the powers of colonial governors.[92] Between 1855 and 1890, the six colonies individually gained responsible government, thus becoming elective democracies managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the British Empire.[93] The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs[94] and defence.[95]\n\n\nIn the mid-19th century, explorers such as Burke and Wills went further inland to determine its agricultural potential and answer scientific questions.[96] A series of gold rushes beginning in the early 1850s led to an influx of new migrants from China, North America and continental Europe,[97] as well as outbreaks of bushranging and civil unrest; the latter peaked in 1854 when Ballarat miners launched the Eureka Rebellion against gold license fees.[98]\n\n\nFrom 1886, Australian colonial governments began introducing policies resulting in the removal of many Aboriginal children from their families and communities (referred to as the Stolen Generations).[99]\n\n\n\n### Federation to the World Wars[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Australia (1901\u20131945)\n\nSee also: Federation of Australia, Military history of Australia during World War I, and Military history of Australia during World War II\n\n![](image)*The Big Picture*, a painting by Tom Roberts, depicts the opening of the first Australian Parliament in 1901.\nOn 1 January 1901, federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning, constitutional conventions and referendums, resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia as a nation and the entering into force of the Australian Constitution.[100]\n\n\nAfter the 1907 Imperial Conference, Australia and several other self-governing British settler colonies were given the status of self-governing \"dominions\" within the British Empire.[101][102] Australia was one of the founding members of the League of Nations in 1920,[103] and subsequently of the United Nations in 1945.[104] Britain's Statute of Westminster 1931 formally ended most of the constitutional links between Australia and the United Kingdom. Australia adopted it in 1942,[105] but it was backdated to 1939 to confirm the validity of legislation passed by the Australian Parliament during World War II.[106][107]\n\n\nThe Federal Capital Territory (later renamed the Australian Capital Territory) was formed in 1911 as the location for the future federal capital of Canberra. Melbourne was the temporary seat of government from 1901 to 1927 while Canberra was being constructed.[108] The Northern Territory was transferred from the control of the South Australian government to the federal parliament in 1911.[109] Australia became the colonial ruler of the Territory of Papua (which had initially been annexed by Queensland in 1883)[110] in 1902 and of the Territory of New Guinea (formerly German New Guinea) in 1920. The two were unified as the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in 1949 and gained independence from Australia in 1975.[111][112][113]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 1942 Bombing of Darwin, the first of over 100 Japanese air raids on Australia during World War II\nIn 1914, Australia joined the Allies in fighting the First World War, and took part in many of the major battles fought on the Western Front.[114] Of about 416,000 who served, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were wounded.[115] Many Australians regard the defeat of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZACs) at Gallipoli in 1915 as the nation's \"baptism of fire\"\u2014its first major military action,[116][117] with the anniversary of the landing at Anzac Cove commemorated each year on Anzac Day.[118]\n\n\nFrom 1939 to 1945, Australia joined the Allies in fighting the Second World War. Australia's armed forces fought in the Pacific, European and Mediterranean and Middle East theatres.[119][120] The shock of Britain's defeat in Asia in 1942, followed soon after by the bombing of Darwin and other Japanese attacks on Australian soil, led to a widespread belief in Australia that a Japanese invasion was imminent, and a shift from the United Kingdom to the United States as Australia's principal ally and security partner.[121] Since 1951, Australia has been a formal military ally of the United States, under the ANZUS treaty.[122]\n\n\n\n### Post-war and contemporary eras[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Australia (1945\u2013present)\n\n![](image)Postwar migrants from Europe arriving in Australia in 1954\nIn the decades following World War II, Australia enjoyed significant increases in living standards, leisure time and suburban development.[123][124] Using the slogan \"populate or perish\", the nation encouraged a large wave of immigration from across Europe, with such immigrants referred to as \"New Australians\".[125]\n\n\nA member of the Western Bloc during the Cold War, Australia participated in the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency during the 1950s and the Vietnam War from 1962 to 1972.[126] During this time, tensions over communist influence in society led to unsuccessful attempts by the Menzies Government to ban the Communist Party of Australia,[127] and a bitter splitting of the Labor Party in 1955.[128]\n\n\nAs a result of a 1967 referendum, the Federal Government received a mandate to implement policies to benefit Aboriginal people, and all Indigenous Australians were included in the Census.[129] Traditional ownership of land (\"native title\") was recognised in law for the first time when the High Court of Australia held in *Mabo v Queensland (No 2)* that the legal doctrine of *terra nullius* (\"land belonging to no one\") did not apply to Australia at the time of European settlement.[130]\n\n\nFollowing the final abolition of the White Australia policy in 1973,[131] Australia's demography and culture transformed as a result of a large and ongoing wave of non-European immigration, mostly from Asia.[132][133] The late 20th century also saw an increasing focus on foreign policy ties with other Pacific Rim nations.[134] While the *Australia Act 1986* severed the remaining vestigial constitutional ties between Australia and the United Kingdom,[135] a 1999 referendum resulted in 55% of voters rejecting a proposal to abolish the Monarchy of Australia and become a republic.[136]\n\n\nFollowing the September 11 attacks on the United States, Australia joined the United States in fighting the Afghanistan War from 2001 to 2021 and the Iraq War from 2003 to 2009.[137] The nation's trade relations also became increasingly oriented towards East Asia in the 21st century, with China becoming the nation's largest trading partner by a large margin.[138]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic which commenced in Australia in 2020, several of Australia's largest cities were locked down for extended periods of time, and free movement across state borders was restricted in an attempt to slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.[139]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Australia and Environment of Australia\n\nSee also: Environmental issues in Australia\n\n### General characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![Map showing the topography of Australia, showing some elevation in the west and very high elevation in mountains in the southeast](image)Topographic map of Australia. Dark green represents the lowest elevation and dark brown the highest.\nSurrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans,[N 7] Australia is separated from Asia by the Arafura and Timor seas, with the Coral Sea lying off the Queensland coast, and the Tasman Sea lying between Australia and New Zealand. The world's smallest continent[141] and sixth largest country by total area,[142] Australia\u2014owing to its size and isolation\u2014is often dubbed the \"island continent\"[143] and is sometimes considered the world's largest island.[144] Australia has 34,218\u00a0km (21,262\u00a0mi) of coastline (excluding all offshore islands),[145] and claims an extensive Exclusive Economic Zone of 8,148,250 square kilometres (3,146,060\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). This exclusive economic zone does not include the Australian Antarctic Territory.[146]\n\n\nMainland Australia lies between latitudes 9\u00b0 and 44\u00b0 South, and longitudes 112\u00b0 and 154\u00b0 East.[147] Australia's size gives it a wide variety of landscapes, with tropical rainforests in the north-east, mountain ranges in the south-east, south-west and east, and desert in the centre.[148] The desert or semi-arid land commonly known as the outback makes up by far the largest portion of land.[149] Australia is the driest inhabited continent; its annual rainfall averaged over continental area is less than 500\u00a0mm.[150] The population density is 3.4 inhabitants per square kilometre, although the large majority of the population lives along the temperate south-eastern coastline. The population density exceeds 19,500 inhabitants per square kilometre in central Melbourne.[151]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fitzroy Island, one of the 600 islands within the main archipelago of the Great Barrier Reef\nThe Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest coral reef,[152] lies a short distance off the north-east coast and extends for over 2,000\u00a0km (1,200\u00a0mi). Mount Augustus, claimed to be the world's largest monolith,[153] is located in Western Australia. At 2,228\u00a0m (7,310\u00a0ft), Mount Kosciuszko is the highest mountain on the Australian mainland. Even taller are Mawson Peak (at 2,745\u00a0m (9,006\u00a0ft)), on the remote Australian external territory of Heard Island, and, in the Australian Antarctic Territory, Mount McClintock and Mount Menzies, at 3,492\u00a0m (11,457\u00a0ft) and 3,355\u00a0m (11,007\u00a0ft) respectively.[154]\n\n\nEastern Australia is marked by the Great Dividing Range, which runs parallel to the coast of Queensland, New South Wales and much of Victoria. The name is not strictly accurate, because parts of the range consist of low hills, and the highlands are typically no more than 1,600\u00a0m (5,200\u00a0ft) in height.[155] The coastal uplands and a belt of Brigalow grasslands lie between the coast and the mountains, while inland of the dividing range are large areas of grassland and shrubland.[155][156] These include the western plains of New South Wales, and the Mitchell Grass Downs and Mulga Lands of inland Queensland.[157][158][159][160] The northernmost point of the mainland is the tropical Cape York Peninsula.[147]\n\n\n\n![](image)Uluru in the semi-arid region of Central Australia\nThe landscapes of the Top End and the Gulf Country\u2014with their tropical climate\u2014include forest, woodland, wetland, grassland, rainforest and desert.[161][162][163] At the north-west corner of the continent are the sandstone cliffs and gorges of The Kimberley, and below that the Pilbara. The Victoria Plains tropical savanna lies south of the Kimberley and Arnhem Land savannas, forming a transition between the coastal savannas and the interior deserts.[164][165][166] At the heart of the country are the uplands of central Australia. Prominent features of the centre and south include Uluru (also known as Ayers Rock), the famous sandstone monolith, and the inland Simpson, Tirari and Sturt Stony, Gibson, Great Sandy, Tanami, and Great Victoria deserts, with the famous Nullarbor Plain on the southern coast.[167][168][169][170] The Western Australian mulga shrublands lie between the interior deserts and Mediterranean-climate Southwest Australia.[169][171]\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of Australia\n\n![](image)Basic geological regions of Australia, by age\nLying on the Indo-Australian Plate, the mainland of Australia is the lowest and most primordial landmass on Earth with a relatively stable geological history.[172][173] The landmass includes virtually all known rock types and from all geological time periods spanning over 3.8 billion years of the Earth's history. The Pilbara Craton is one of only two pristine Archaean 3.6\u20132.7 Ga (billion years ago) crusts identified on the Earth.[174]\n\n\nHaving been part of all major supercontinents, the Australian continent began to form after the breakup of Gondwana in the Permian, with the separation of the continental landmass from the African continent and Indian subcontinent. It separated from Antarctica over a prolonged period beginning in the Permian and continuing through to the Cretaceous.[175] When the last glacial period ended in about 10,000 BC, rising sea levels formed Bass Strait, separating Tasmania from the mainland. Then between about 8,000 and 6,500 BC, the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea, separating New Guinea, the Aru Islands, and the mainland of Australia.[176] The Australian continent is moving toward Eurasia at the rate of 6 to 7 centimetres a year.[177]\n\n\nThe Australian mainland's continental crust, excluding the thinned margins, has an average thickness of 38\u00a0km, with a range in thickness from 24\u00a0km to 59\u00a0km.[178] Australia's geology can be divided into several main sections, showcasing that the continent grew from west to east: the Archaean cratonic shields found mostly in the west, Proterozoic fold belts in the centre and Phanerozoic sedimentary basins, metamorphic and igneous rocks in the east.[179]\n\n\nThe Australian mainland and Tasmania are situated in the middle of the tectonic plate and have no active volcanoes,[180] but due to passing over the East Australia hotspot, recent volcanism has occurred during the Holocene, in the Newer Volcanics Province of western Victoria and southeastern South Australia. Volcanism also occurs in the island of New Guinea (considered geologically as part of the Australian continent), and in the Australian external territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands.[181] Seismic activity in the Australian mainland and Tasmania is also low, with the greatest number of fatalities having occurred in the 1989 Newcastle earthquake.[182]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Australia\n\n![](image)K\u00f6ppen climate types of Australia[183]\nThe climate of Australia is significantly influenced by ocean currents, including the Indian Ocean Dipole and the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation, which is correlated with periodic drought, and the seasonal tropical low-pressure system that produces cyclones in northern Australia.[184][185] These factors cause rainfall to vary markedly from year to year. Much of the northern part of the country has a tropical, predominantly summer-rainfall (monsoon).[150] The south-west corner of the country has a Mediterranean climate.[186] The south-east ranges from oceanic (Tasmania and coastal Victoria) to humid subtropical (upper half of New South Wales), with the highlands featuring alpine and subpolar oceanic climates. The interior is arid to semi-arid.[150]\n\n\nDriven by climate change, average temperatures have risen more than 1\u00b0C since 1960. Associated changes in rainfall patterns and climate extremes exacerbate existing issues such as drought and bushfires. 2019 was Australia's warmest recorded year,[187] and the 2019\u20132020 bushfire season was the country's worst on record.[188] Australia's greenhouse gas emissions per capita are among the highest in the world.[189]\n\n\nWater restrictions are frequently in place in many regions and cities of Australia in response to chronic shortages due to urban population increases and localised drought.[190][191] Throughout much of the continent, major flooding regularly follows extended periods of drought, flushing out inland river systems, overflowing dams and inundating large inland flood plains, as occurred throughout Eastern Australia in the early 2010s after the 2000s Australian drought.[192]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Fauna of Australia, Flora of Australia, and Fungi of Australia\n\n![A koala holding onto a eucalyptus tree with its head turned so both eyes are visible](image)The koala and the *eucalyptus* form an iconic Australian pair.\nAlthough most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, the continent includes a diverse range of habitats from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests. Fungi typify that diversity\u2014an estimated 250,000 species\u2014of which only 5% have been described\u2014occur in Australia.[193] Because of the continent's great age, extremely variable weather patterns, and long-term geographic isolation, much of Australia's biota is unique. About 85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, more than 45% of birds, and 89% of in-shore, temperate-zone fish are endemic.[194] Australia has at least 755 species of reptile, more than any other country in the world.[195] Besides Antarctica, Australia is the only continent that developed without feline species. Feral cats may have been introduced in the 17th century by Dutch shipwrecks, and later in the 18th century by European settlers. They are now considered a major factor in the decline and extinction of many vulnerable and endangered native species.[196] Seafaring immigrants from Asia are believed to have brought the dingo to Australia sometime after the end of the last ice age\u2014perhaps 4000 years ago\u2014and Aboriginal people helped disperse them across the continent as pets, contributing to the demise of thylacines on the mainland.[197] Australia is also one of 17 megadiverse countries.[198]\n\n\nAustralian forests are mostly made up of evergreen species, particularly eucalyptus trees in the less arid regions; wattles replace them as the dominant species in drier regions and deserts.[199] Among well-known Australian animals are the monotremes (the platypus and echidna); a host of marsupials, including the kangaroo, koala, and wombat, and birds such as the emu and the kookaburra.[199] Australia is home to many dangerous animals including some of the most venomous snakes in the world.[200] The dingo was introduced by Austronesian people who traded with Indigenous Australians around 3000 BCE.[201] Many animal and plant species became extinct soon after first human settlement,[202] including the Australian megafauna; others have disappeared since European settlement, among them the thylacine.[203][204]\n\n\nMany of Australia's ecoregions, and the species within those regions, are threatened by human activities and introduced animal, chromistan, fungal and plant species.[205] All these factors have led to Australia's having the highest mammal extinction rate of any country in the world.[206] The federal *Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999* is the legal framework for the protection of threatened species.[207] Numerous protected areas have been created under the National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia's Biological Diversity to protect and preserve unique ecosystems;[208][209] 65 wetlands are listed under the Ramsar Convention,[210] and 16 natural World Heritage Sites have been established.[211] Australia was ranked 21st out of 178 countries in the world on the 2018 Environmental Performance Index.[212] There are more than 1,800 animals and plants on Australia's threatened species list, including more than 500 animals.[213]\n\n\nPaleontologists discovered a fossil site of a prehistoric rainforest in McGraths Flat, in South Australia, that presents evidence that this now arid desert and dry shrubland/grassland was once home to an abundance of life.[214][215]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Australia and Politics of Australia\n\n![](image)\nCharles III,  \nKing of Australia\n![](image)\nDavid Hurley,  \nGovernor-General of Australia\n![](image)\nAnthony Albanese,  \nPrime Minister of Australia\n\nAustralia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy.[216] The country has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system under its constitution, which is one of the world's oldest, since Federation in 1901. It is also one of the world's oldest federations, in which power is divided between the federal and state and territorial governments. The Australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the United Kingdom (a fused executive, constitutional monarchy and strong party discipline) and the United States (federalism, a written constitution and strong bicameralism with an elected upper house), along with distinctive indigenous features.[217][218]\n\n\nThe federal government is separated into three branches:[219]\n\n\n\n* Legislature: the bicameral Parliament, comprising the monarch (represented by the governor-general), the Senate, and the House of Representatives;\n* Executive: the Federal Executive Council, which in practice gives legal effect to the decisions of the cabinet, comprising the prime minister and other ministers of state appointed by the governor-general on the advice of Parliament;[220]\n* Judiciary: the High Court of Australia and other federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the governor-general on advice of Parliament\n\n\nCharles III reigns as King of Australia and is represented in Australia by the governor-general at the federal level and by the governors at the state level, who by convention act on the advice of his ministers.[221][222] Thus, in practice the governor-general acts as a legal figurehead for the actions of the prime minister and the Federal Executive Council. The governor-general, however, does have reserve powers which, in some situations, may be exercised outside the prime minister's request. These powers are held by convention and their scope is unclear. The most notable exercise of these powers was the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in the constitutional crisis of 1975.[223]\n\n\n\n![A large white and cream coloured building with grass on its roof. The building is topped with a large flagpole.](image)Parliament House, Canberra\nIn the Senate (the upper house), there are 76 senators: twelve each from the states and two each from the mainland territories (the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory).[224] The House of Representatives (the lower house) has 151 members elected from single-member electoral divisions, commonly known as \"electorates\" or \"seats\", allocated to states on the basis of population,[225] with each original state guaranteed a minimum of five seats.[226] Elections for both chambers are normally held every three years simultaneously; senators have overlapping six-year terms except for those from the territories, whose terms are not fixed but are tied to the electoral cycle for the lower house; thus only 40 of the 76 places in the Senate are put to each election unless the cycle is interrupted by a double dissolution.[224]\n\n\nAustralia's electoral system uses preferential voting for all lower house elections with the exception of Tasmania and the ACT which, along with the Senate and most state upper houses, combine it with proportional representation in a system known as the single transferable vote. Voting is compulsory for all enrolled citizens 18 years and over in every jurisdiction,[227] as is enrolment.[228] The party with majority support in the House of Representatives forms the government and its leader becomes Prime Minister. In cases where no party has majority support, the Governor-General has the constitutional power to appoint the Prime Minister and, if necessary, dismiss one that has lost the confidence of Parliament.[229] Due to the relatively unique position of Australia operating as a Westminster parliamentary democracy with an elected upper house, the system has sometimes been referred to as having a \"Washminster mutation\",[230] or as a semi-parliamentary system.[231]\n\n\nThere are two major political groups that usually form government, federally and in the states: the Australian Labor Party and the Coalition, which is a formal grouping of the Liberal Party and its minor partner, the National Party.[232][233] The Liberal National Party and the Country Liberal Party are merged state branches in Queensland and the Northern Territory that function as separate parties at a federal level.[234] Within Australian political culture, the Coalition is considered centre-right and the Labor Party is considered centre-left.[235] Independent members and several minor parties have achieved representation in Australian parliaments, mostly in upper houses. The Australian Greens are often considered the \"third force\" in politics, being the third largest party by both vote and membership.[236][237]\n\n\nThe most recent federal election was held on 21 May 2022 and resulted in the Australian Labor Party, led by Anthony Albanese, being elected to government.[238]\n\n\n\n### States and territories[edit]\n\n\nMain article: States and territories of Australia\n\n![](image)A map of Australia's states and territories\nAustralia has six states\u2014New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (Qld), South Australia (SA), Tasmania (Tas), Victoria (Vic) and Western Australia (WA)\u2014and three mainland territories\u2014the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), the Northern Territory (NT), and the Jervis Bay Territory (JBT). The ACT and NT are mostly self-governing, except that the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to modify or repeal any legislation passed by the territory parliaments.[239]\n\n\nUnder the constitution, the states essentially have plenary legislative power to legislate on any subject, whereas the Commonwealth (federal) Parliament may legislate only within the subject areas enumerated under section 51. For example, state parliaments have the power to legislate with respect to education, criminal law and state police, health, transport, and local government, but the Commonwealth Parliament does not have any specific power to legislate in these areas.[240] However, Commonwealth laws prevail over state laws to the extent of the inconsistency.[241]\n\n\nEach state and major mainland territory has its own parliament\u2014unicameral in the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the other states. The states are sovereign entities, although subject to certain powers of the Commonwealth as defined by the Constitution. The lower houses are known as the Legislative Assembly (the House of Assembly in South Australia and Tasmania); the upper houses are known as the Legislative Council. The head of the government in each state is the Premier and in each territory the Chief Minister. The King is represented in each state by a governor. In the Commonwealth, the King's representative is the governor-general.[242]\n\n\nThe Commonwealth Parliament also directly administers the external territories of Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, and the claimed region of Australian Antarctic Territory, as well as the internal Jervis Bay Territory, a naval base and sea port for the national capital in land that was formerly part of New South Wales.[220] The external territory of Norfolk Island previously exercised considerable autonomy under the *Norfolk Island Act 1979* through its own legislative assembly and an Administrator to represent the monarch.[243] In 2015, the Commonwealth Parliament abolished self-government, integrating Norfolk Island into the Australian tax and welfare systems and replacing its legislative assembly with a council.[244] Macquarie Island is part of Tasmania,[245] and Lord Howe Island of New South Wales.[246]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Australia\n\n![](image)Diplomatic missions of Australia\nOver recent decades, Australia's foreign relations have been driven by a focus on relationships within the Asia-Pacific region and a continued close association with the United States through the ANZUS pact and its status as a major non-NATO ally of that country.[247] A regional power, Australia is a member of regional and cultural groupings including the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Community and the Commonwealth of Nations, and is a participant in the ASEAN+6 mechanism and the East Asia Summit.\n\n\nAustralia is a member of several defence, intelligence and security groupings including the Five Eyes intelligence alliance with the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand; the ANZUS alliance with the United States and New Zealand; the AUKUS security treaty with the United States and United Kingdom; the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with the United States, India and Japan; the Five Power Defence Arrangements with New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and Singapore; and the Reciprocal Access defence and security agreement with Japan.\n\n\n\n![](image)Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese with American President Joe Biden in Kantei, Tokyo, 2022\nAustralia has pursued the cause of international trade liberalisation.[248] It led the formation of the Cairns Group and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation,[249][250] and is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).[251][252] In recent decades, Australia has entered into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership multilateral free trade agreements as well as bilateral free trade agreements with the United States, China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand.[253]\n\n\nAustralia maintains a deeply integrated relationship with neighbouring New Zealand, with free mobility of citizens between the two countries under the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement and free trade under the Closer Economic Relations agreement.[254] The most favourably viewed countries by the Australian people in 2021 include New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and South Korea.[255] A founding member country of the United Nations, Australia is strongly committed to multilateralism,[256] and maintains an international aid program under which some 60 countries receive assistance.[257] Australia ranked fourth in the Center for Global Development's 2021 Commitment to Development Index.[258]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Australian Defence Force, Royal Australian Navy, Australian Army, and Royal Australian Air Force\n\n![](image)HMAS Canberra, a Canberra class landing helicopter dock, and HMAS Arunta, an Anzac-class frigate, sailing in formation\nAustralia's armed forces\u2014the Australian Defence Force (ADF)\u2014comprise the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), in total numbering 81,214 personnel (including 57,982 regulars and 23,232 reservists) as of November\u00a02015[update]. The titular role of Commander-in-Chief is vested in the Governor-General, who appoints a Chief of the Defence Force from one of the armed services on the advice of the government.[259] In a diarchy, the Chief of the Defence Force serves as co-chairman of the Defence Committee, conjointly with the Secretary of Defence, in the command and control of the Australian Defence Organisation.[260]\n\n\nIn the 2016\u20132017 budget, defence spending comprised 2% of GDP, representing the world's 12th largest defence budget.[261] Australia has been involved in United Nations and regional peacekeeping, disaster relief, as well as armed conflicts from the First World War onwards.\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Human rights in Australia and LGBT rights in Australia\n\nLegal and social rights in Australia are regarded as among the most developed in the world.[36] Attitudes towards LGBT people are generally positive within Australia, and same-sex marriage has been legal in the nation since 2017.[262][263] Australia has had anti-discrimination laws regarding disability since 1992.[264]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Australia\n\nFurther information: Economic history of Australia and Tourism in Australia\n\n![](image)The central business district of Sydney is the financial centre of Australia.\nAustralia's high-income mixed-market economy is rich in natural resources.[265] It is the world's fourteenth-largest by nominal terms, and the 18th-largest by PPP. As of 2021[update], it has the second-highest amount of wealth per adult, after Luxembourg,[266] and has the thirteenth-highest financial assets per capita.[267] Australia has a labour force of some 13.5 million, with an unemployment rate of 3.5% as of June 2022.[268] According to the Australian Council of Social Service, the poverty rate of Australia exceeds 13.6% of the population, encompassing 3.2\u00a0million. It also estimated that there were 774,000 (17.7%) children under the age of 15 living in relative poverty.[269][270] The Australian dollar is the national currency, which is also shared with three Island states in the Pacific: Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu.[271]\n\n\nAustralian government debt, about $963 billion, exceeds 45.1% of the country's total GDP, and is the world's eighth-highest.[272] Australia had the second-highest level of household debt in the world in 2020, after Switzerland.[273] Its house prices are among the highest in the world, especially in the large urban areas.[274] The large service sector accounts for about 71.2% of total GDP, followed by the industrial sector (25.3%), while the agriculture sector is by far the smallest, making up only 3.6% of total GDP.[275] Australia is the world's 21st-largest exporter and 24th-largest importer.[276][277] China is Australia's largest trading partner by a wide margin, accounting for roughly 40% of the country's exports and 17.6% of its imports.[278] Other major export markets include Japan, the United States, and South Korea.[279]\n\n\nAustralia has high levels of competitiveness and economic freedom, and was ranked fifth in the Human Development Index in 2021.[280] As of 2022[update], it is ranked twelfth in the Index of Economic Freedom and nineteenth in the Global Competitiveness Report.[281][282] It attracted 9.5\u00a0million international tourists in 2019,[283] and was ranked thirteenth among the countries of Asia-Pacific in 2019 for inbound tourism.[284] The 2021 *Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report* ranked Australia seventh-highest in the world out of 117 countries.[285] Its international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to $45.7 billion.[284]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Energy policy of Australia and Renewable energy in Australia\n\nIn 2003, Australia's energy sources were coal (58.4%), hydropower (19.1%), natural gas (13.5%), liquid/gas fossil fuel-switching plants (5.4%), oil (2.9%), and other renewable resources like wind power, solar energy, and bioenergy (0.7%).[286] During the 21st century, Australia has been trending to generate more energy using renewable resources and less energy using fossil fuels. In 2020, Australia used coal for 62% of all energy (3.6% increase compared to 2013), wind power for 9.9% (9.5% increase), natural gas for 9.9% (3.6% decrease), solar power for 9.9% (9.8% increase), hydropower for 6.4% (12.7% decrease), bioenergy for 1.4% (1.2% increase), and other sources like oil and waste coal mine gas for 0.5%.[287][288]\n\n\nIn August 2009, Australia's government set a goal to achieve 20% of all energy in the country from renewable sources by 2020.[289] They achieved this goal, as renewable resources accounted for 27.7% of Australia's energy in 2020.[287]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, Australia spent A$35.6 billion on research and development, allocating about 1.79% of GDP.[290] A recent study by Accenture for the Tech Council shows that the Australian tech sector combined contributes $167 billion a year to the economy and employs 861,000 people.[291] The country's most recognized and important sector of this type is mining,[292] where Australia continues to have the highest penetration of technologies, especially drones, autonomous and remote-controlled vehicles and mine management software.[293] In addition, recent startup ecosystems in Sydney and Melbourne are already valued at $34 billion combined.[294] Australia ranked 24th in the Global Innovation Index 2023.[295]\n\n\nWith only 0.3% of the world's population, Australia contributed 4.1% of the world's published research in 2020, making it one of the top 10 research contributors in the world.[296][297] CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, contributes 10% of all research in the country, while the rest is carried out by universities.[297] Its most notable contributions include the invention of atomic absorption spectroscopy,[298] the essential components of Wi-Fi technology,[299] and the development of the first commercially successful polymer banknote.[300]\n\n\nAustralia is a key player in supporting space exploration. Facilities such as the Square Kilometre Array and Australia Telescope Compact Array radio telescopes, telescopes such as the Siding Spring Observatory, and ground stations such as the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex are of great assistance in deep space exploration missions, primarily by NASA.[301]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Australia\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of cities in Australia by population.\n\nAustralia has an average population density of 3.5 persons per square kilometre of total land area, which makes it one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. The population is heavily concentrated on the east coast, and in particular in the south-eastern region between South East Queensland to the north-east and Adelaide to the south-west.[302]\n\n\nAustralia is highly urbanised, with 67% of the population living in the Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (metropolitan areas of the state and mainland territorial capital cities) in 2018.[303] Metropolitan areas with more than one million inhabitants are Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide.[304]\n\n\nIn common with many other developed countries, Australia is experiencing a demographic shift towards an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2018 the average age of the Australian population was 38.8 years.[305] In 2015, 2.15% of the Australian population lived overseas, one of the lowest proportions worldwide.[306]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest populated areas in Australia2021 data from Australian Bureau of Statistics[307]\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Name | State |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | State |  Municipal pop. |\n| 1 | Sydney | NSW | 5,259,764 | 11 | Geelong | Vic | 289,400\n |\n| 2 | Melbourne | Vic | 4,976,157 | 12 | Hobart | Tas | 251,047\n |\n| 3 | Brisbane | Qld | 2,568,927 | 13 | Townsville | Qld | 181,665\n |\n| 4 | Perth | WA | 2,192,229 | 14 | Cairns | Qld | 155,638\n |\n| 5 | Adelaide | SA | 1,402,393 | 15 | Darwin | NT | 148,801\n |\n| 6 | Gold Coast\u2013Tweed Heads | Qld/NSW | 706,673 | 16 | Toowoomba | Qld | 143,994\n |\n| 7 | Newcastle\u2013Maitland | NSW | 509,894 | 17 | Ballarat | Vic | 111,702\n |\n| 8 | Canberra\u2013Queanbeyan | ACT/NSW | 482,250 | 18 | Bendigo | Vic | 102,899\n |\n| 9 | Sunshine Coast | Qld | 355,631 | 19 | Albury-Wodonga | NSW/Vic | 97,676\n |\n| 10 | Wollongong | NSW | 305,880 | 20 | Launceston | Tas | 93,332\n |\n\n### Ancestry and immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Australia\n\n![](image)Australian residents by country of birth, 2021 census\nBetween 1788 and the Second World War, the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from the British Isles (principally England, Ireland and Scotland), although there was significant immigration from China and Germany during the 19th century. In the decades immediately following the Second World War, Australia received a large wave of immigration from across Europe, with many more immigrants arriving from Southern and Eastern Europe than in previous decades. Since the end of the White Australia policy in 1973, Australia has pursued an official policy of multiculturalism,[308] and there has been a large and continuing wave of immigration from across the world, with Asia being the largest source of immigrants in the 21st century.[309]\n\n\nToday, Australia has the world's eighth-largest immigrant population, with immigrants accounting for 30% of the population, the highest proportion among major Western nations.[310][311] 160,323 permanent immigrants were admitted to Australia in 2018\u20132019 (excluding refugees),[309] whilst there was a net population gain of 239,600 people from all permanent and temporary immigration in that year.[312] The majority of immigrants are skilled,[309] but the immigration program includes categories for family members and refugees.[312] In 2020, the largest foreign-born populations were those born in England (3.8%), India (2.8%), Mainland China (2.5%), New Zealand (2.2%), the Philippines (1.2%) and Vietnam (1.1%).[313]\n\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics does not collect data on race, but asks each Australian resident to nominate up to two ancestries each census.[314] These ancestry responses are classified into broad standardised ancestry groups.[315] At the 2021 census, the number of ancestry responses within each standardised group as a proportion of the total population was as follows:[316] 57.2% European (including 46% North-West European and 11.2% Southern and Eastern European), 33.8% Oceanian,[N 8] 17.4% Asian (including 6.5% Southern and Central Asian, 6.4% North-East Asian, and 4.5% South-East Asian), 3.2% North African and Middle Eastern, 1.4% Peoples of the Americas, and 1.3% Sub-Saharan African. At the 2021 census, the most commonly nominated individual ancestries as a proportion of the total population were:[6]\n\n\n\n* English (33%)\n* Australian (29.9%)[N 9]\n* Irish (9.5%)\n* Scottish (8.6%)\n* Chinese (5.5%)\n* Italian (4.4%)\n* German (4%)\n* Indian (3.1%)\n* Aboriginal (2.9%)[N 10]\n* Greek (1.7%)\n* Filipino (1.6%)\n* Dutch (1.5%)\n* Vietnamese (1.3%)\n* Lebanese (1%)\n\nAt the 2021 census, 3.8% of the Australian population identified as being Indigenous\u2014Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders.[N 11][318]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Australia\n\nAlthough English is not the official language of Australia in law, it is the *de facto* official and national language.[319][320] Australian English is a major variety of the language with a distinctive accent and lexicon,[321] and differs slightly from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling.[322] General Australian serves as the standard dialect.[323]\n\n\nAt the 2021 census, English was the only language spoken in the home for 72% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home were Mandarin (2.7%), Arabic (1.4%), Vietnamese (1.3%), Cantonese (1.2%) and Punjabi (0.9%).[324]\n\n\nOver 250 Australian Aboriginal languages are thought to have existed at the time of first European contact.[325] The National Indigenous Languages Survey (NILS) for 2018\u201319 found that more than 120 Indigenous language varieties were in use or being revived, although 70 of those in use were endangered.[326] The 2021 census found that 167 Indigenous languages were spoken at home by 76,978 Indigenous Australians.[327] NILS and the Australian Bureau of Statistics use different classifications for Indigenous Australian languages.[328]\n\n\nThe Australian sign language known as Auslan was used at home by 16,242 people at the time of the 2021 census.[329]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Australia\n\n![](image)Australia is secular and hosts a diversity of religions. St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney belongs to the Roman Catholic Church, Australia's largest religious denomination.\nAustralia has no state religion; Section 116 of the Australian Constitution prohibits the federal government from making any law to establish any religion, impose any religious observance, or prohibit the free exercise of any religion.[330] As of 2023, a plurality of Australians are irreligious.[331]\n\n\nAt the 2021 Census, 38.9% of the population identified as having \"no religion\",[6] up from 15.5% in 2001.[332] The largest religion is Christianity (43.9% of the population).[6] The largest Christian denominations are the Roman Catholic Church (20% of the population) and the Anglican Church of Australia (9.8%). Multicultural immigration since the Second World War has led to the growth of non-Christian religions, the largest of which are Islam (3.2%), Hinduism (2.7%), Buddhism (2.4%), Sikhism (0.8%), and Judaism (0.4%).[6]\n\n\nIn 2021, just under 8,000 people declared an affiliation with traditional Aboriginal religions.[6] In Australian Aboriginal mythology and the animist framework developed in Aboriginal Australia, the Dreaming is a sacred era in which ancestral totemic spirit beings formed The Creation. The Dreaming established the laws and structures of society and the ceremonies performed to ensure continuity of life and land.[333]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Health care in Australia\n\nAustralia's life expectancy of 83 years (81 years for males and 85 years for females),[334] is the fifth-highest in the world. It has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world,[335] while cigarette smoking is the largest preventable cause of death and disease, responsible for 7.8% of the total mortality and disease. Ranked second in preventable causes is hypertension at 7.6%, with obesity third at 7.5%.[336][337] Australia ranked 35th in the world in 2012 for its proportion of obese women[338] and near the top of developed nations for its proportion of obese adults;[339] 63% of its adult population is either overweight or obese.[340]\n\n\nAustralia spent around 9.91% of its total GDP to health care in 2021.[341] It introduced universal health care in 1975.[342] Known as Medicare, it is now nominally funded by an income tax surcharge known as the Medicare levy, currently at 2%.[343] The states manage hospitals and attached outpatient services, while the Commonwealth funds the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (subsidising the costs of medicines) and general practice.[342]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic Australia had one of the most restrictive quarantine policies, resulting in one of the lowest death rates worldwide.[344]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Australia\n\n![](image)Five Australian universities rank in the top 50 of the *QS World University Rankings*, including the Australian National University (19th).[345]\nSchool attendance, or registration for home schooling,[346] is compulsory throughout Australia. Education is the responsibility of the individual states and territories[347] so the rules vary between states, but in general children are required to attend school from the age of about 5 until about 16.[348][349] In some states (Western Australia, Northern Territory and New South Wales), children aged 16\u201317 are required to either attend school or participate in vocational training, such as an apprenticeship.[350][351][352][353]\n\n\nAustralia has an adult literacy rate that was estimated to be 99% in 2003.[354] However, a 2011\u20132012 report for the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that Tasmania has a literacy and numeracy rate of only 50%.[355]\n\n\nAustralia has 37 government-funded universities and three private universities, as well as a number of other specialist institutions that provide approved courses at the higher education level.[356] The OECD places Australia among the most expensive nations to attend university.[357] There is a state-based system of vocational training, known as TAFE, and many trades conduct apprenticeships for training new tradespeople.[358] About 58% of Australians aged from 25 to 64 have vocational or tertiary qualifications[359] and the tertiary graduation rate of 49% is the highest among OECD countries. 30.9% of Australia's population has attained a higher education qualification, which is among the highest percentages in the world.[360][361][362]\n\n\nAustralia has the highest ratio of international students per head of population in the world by a large margin, with 812,000 international students enrolled in the nation's universities and vocational institutions in 2019.[363][364] Accordingly, in 2019, international students represented on average 26.7% of the student bodies of Australian universities. International education therefore represents one of the country's largest exports and has a pronounced influence on the country's demographics, with a significant proportion of international students remaining in Australia after graduation on various skill and employment visas.[365] Education is Australia's third-largest export, after iron ore and coal, and contributed over $28 billion to the economy in 2016\u201317.[297]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Australia\n\n![Ornate white building with an elevated dome in the middle, fronted by a golden fountain and orange flowers](image)The Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne was the first building in Australia to be listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004.[366]\nThe country is home to a diversity of cultures, a result of its history of immigration.[367] Prior to 1850, Australia was dominated by Indigenous cultures.[368][369] Since then, Australian culture has primarily been a Western culture, strongly influenced by Anglo-Celtic settlers.[370][371] Other influences include Australian Aboriginal culture, the traditions brought to the country by waves of immigration from around the world,[372] and the culture of the United States.[373] The cultural divergence and evolution that has occurred over the centuries since European settlement has resulted in a distinctive Australian culture.[374][375]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Australian art, Australian literature, Theatre of Australia, and Dance in Australia\n\n![](image)Sidney Nolan's *Snake* mural (1970), held at the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, Tasmania, is inspired by the Aboriginal creation myth of the Rainbow Serpent, as well as desert flowers in bloom after a drought.[376]\nAustralia has over 100,000 Aboriginal rock art sites,[377] and traditional designs, patterns and stories infuse contemporary Indigenous Australian art, \"the last great art movement of the 20th century\" according to critic Robert Hughes;[378] its exponents include Emily Kame Kngwarreye.[379] Early colonial artists showed a fascination with the unfamiliar land.[380] The impressionistic works of Arthur Streeton, Tom Roberts and other members of the 19th-century Heidelberg School\u2014the first \"distinctively Australian\" movement in Western art\u2014gave expression to nationalist sentiments in the lead-up to Federation.[380] While the school remained influential into the 1900s, modernists such as Margaret Preston, and, later, Sidney Nolan, explored new artistic trends.[380] The landscape remained central to the work of Aboriginal watercolourist Albert Namatjira,[381] as well as Fred Williams, Brett Whiteley and other post-war artists whose works, eclectic in style yet uniquely Australian, moved between the figurative and the abstract.[380][382]\n\n\nAustralian literature grew slowly in the decades following European settlement though Indigenous oral traditions, many of which have since been recorded in writing, are much older.[383] In the 19th-century, Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson captured the experience of the bush using a distinctive Australian vocabulary.[384] Their works are still popular; Paterson's bush poem \"Waltzing Matilda\" (1895) is regarded as Australia's unofficial national anthem.[385] Miles Franklin is the namesake of Australia's most prestigious literary prize, awarded annually to the best novel about Australian life.[386] Its first recipient, Patrick White, went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1973.[387] Australian Booker Prize winners include Peter Carey, Thomas Keneally and Richard Flanagan.[388] Australian public intellectuals have also written seminal works in their respective fields, including feminist Germaine Greer and philosopher Peter Singer.[389]\n\n\nMany of Australia's performing arts companies receive funding through the federal government's Australia Council.[390] There is a symphony orchestra in each state,[391] and a national opera company, Opera Australia,[392] well known for its famous soprano Joan Sutherland.[393] At the beginning of the 20th century, Nellie Melba was one of the world's leading opera singers.[394] Ballet and dance are represented by The Australian Ballet and various state companies. Each state has a publicly funded theatre company.[395]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cinema of Australia, Television in Australia, Media of Australia, and Music of Australia\n\n![](image)Actor playing the bushranger Ned Kelly in *The Story of the Kelly Gang* (1906), the world's first feature-length narrative film\n*The Story of the Kelly Gang* (1906), the world's first feature-length narrative film, spurred a boom in Australian cinema during the silent film era.[396] After World War I, Hollywood monopolised the industry,[397] and by the 1960s Australian film production had effectively ceased.[398] With the benefit of government support, the Australian New Wave of the 1970s brought provocative and successful films, many exploring themes of national identity, such as *Wake in Fright* and *Gallipoli*,[399] while *Crocodile Dundee* and the Ozploitation movement's *Mad Max* series became international blockbusters.[400] In a film market flooded with foreign content, Australian films delivered a 7.7% share of the local box office in 2015.[401] The AACTAs are Australia's premier film and television awards, and notable Academy Award winners from Australia include Geoffrey Rush, Nicole Kidman, Cate Blanchett and Heath Ledger.[402]\n\n\nAustralia has two public broadcasters (the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the multicultural Special Broadcasting Service), three commercial television networks, several pay-TV services,[403] and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has at least one daily newspaper,[403] and there are two national daily newspapers, *The Australian* and *The Australian Financial Review*.[403] In 2020, Reporters Without Borders placed Australia 25th on a list of 180 countries ranked by press freedom, behind New Zealand (8th) but ahead of the United Kingdom (33rd) and United States (44th).[404] This relatively low ranking is primarily because of the limited diversity of commercial media ownership in Australia;[405] most print media are under the control of News Corporation and Nine Entertainment Co.[406]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Australian cuisine\n\n![](image)The meringue-based pavlova is generally eaten at Christmas time.\nMost Indigenous Australian groups subsisted on a simple hunter-gatherer diet of native fauna and flora, otherwise called bush tucker.[407] The first settlers introduced British and Irish cuisine to the continent.[408][409] This influence is seen in the enduring popularity of several British dishes such as fish and chips, and in quintessential Australian dishes such as the Australian meat pie, which is related to the British steak pie. Post-war immigration transformed Australian cuisine. For instance, Southern European migrants helped to build a thriving Australian coffee culture which gave rise to Australian coffee drinks such as the flat white,[410] while East Asian migration led to dishes such as the Cantonese-influenced dim sim and Chiko Roll,[411] as well as a distinct Australian Chinese cuisine. Sausage sizzles, pavlovas, lamingtons, meat pies, Vegemite and Anzac biscuits are regarded as iconic Australian foods.[412]\n\n\nAustralia is a leading exporter and consumer of wine.[413] Australian wine is produced mainly in the southern, cooler parts of the country.[414] The nation also ranks highly in beer consumption,[415] with each state and territory hosting numerous breweries. Australia is also known for its cafe and coffee culture in urban centres.[416]\n\n\n\n### Sport and recreation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Australia\n\n![](image)The Melbourne Cricket Ground is strongly associated with the history and development of cricket and Australian rules football, Australia's two most popular spectator sports.[417]\nCricket and football are the predominant sports in Australia during the summer and winter months, respectively. Australia is unique in that it has professional leagues for four football codes. Originating in Melbourne in the 1850s, Australian rules football is the most popular code in all states except New South Wales and Queensland, where rugby league holds sway, followed by rugby union.[418] Soccer, while ranked fourth in popularity and resources, has the highest overall participation rates.[419] Cricket is popular across all borders and has been regarded by many Australians as the national sport. The Australian national cricket team competed against England in the first Test match (1877) and the first One Day International (1971), and against New Zealand in the first Twenty20 International (2004), winning all three games. It has also participated in every edition of the Cricket World Cup, winning the tournament a record five times.[420]\n\n\nAustralia is one of five nations to have participated in every Summer Olympics of the modern era,[421] and has hosted the Games twice: 1956 in Melbourne and 2000 in Sydney.[422] It is also set to host the 2032 Games in Brisbane.[423] Australia has also participated in every Commonwealth Games,[424] hosting the event in 1938, 1962, 1982, 2006 and 2018.[425] As well as being a regular FIFA World Cup participant, Australia has won the OFC Nations Cup four times and the AFC Asian Cup once\u2014the only country to have won championships in two different FIFA confederations.[426]\n\n\nOther major international events held in Australia include the Australian Open tennis grand slam tournament and the Australian Formula One Grand Prix. The annual Melbourne Cup horse race and the Sydney to Hobart yacht race also attract intense interest.[427] Australia is also notable for water-based sports, such as swimming and surfing.[428] The surf lifesaving movement originated in Australia, and the volunteer lifesaver is one of the country's icons.[429] Snow sports take place primarily in the Australian Alps and Tasmania.[430]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Australia portal\n* ![icon](image)Oceania portal\n\n\n* Index of Australia-related articles\n* Outline of Australia\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Australia's royal anthem is \"God Save the King\", played in the presence of members of the royal family when they are in Australia.

In the western Pacific Ocean, it consists of 7,641 islands which are broadly categorized in three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The Philippines is bounded by the South China Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to the east, and the Celebes Sea to the south. It shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Japan to the northeast, Palau to the east and southeast, Indonesia to the south, Malaysia to the southwest, Vietnam to the west, and China to the northwest.

Manila is the country's capital, and its most populated city is Quezon City; both are within Metro Manila.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNegritos, the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, were followed by waves of Austronesian peoples. The adoption of Animism, Islam and Hinduism established island-kingdoms ruled by datus, rajas, and sultans. The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer leading a fleet for Spain, marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos named the archipelago *Las Islas Filipinas* in honor of King Philip II of Castile. Spanish settlement via New Spain, beginning in 1565, led to the Philippines becoming ruled by the Crown of Castile, as part of the Spanish Empire, for more than 300 years. Catholic Christianity became the dominant religion, and Manila became the western hub of trans-Pacific trade. The Philippine Revolution began in 1896, which became entwined with the 1898 Spanish\u2013American War. Spain ceded the territory to the United States, and Filipino revolutionaries declared the First Philippine Republic. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n280. **^** Lee-Brago, Pia (May 30, 2003). \"RP seeks observer status in OIC\". *The Philippine Star*.

It lies in the Indian Ocean, southwest of the Bay of Bengal, separated from the Indian peninsula by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait. Sri Lanka shares a maritime border with the Maldives in the south-west and India in the north-west.\n\n\nSri Lanka has a population of approximately 22 million people and is home to many cultures, languages, and ethnicities. The Sinhalese people form the majority of the nation's population, followed by the Tamils, who are the largest minority group and are concentrated in northern Sri Lanka; both groups have played an influential role in the island's history. Other long-established groups include the Moors, Indian Tamils, Burghers, Malays, Chinese, and Vedda.[14]\n\n\nSri Lanka's documented history goes back 3,000 years, with evidence of prehistoric human settlements that dates back 125,000 years.[15] The earliest known Buddhist writings of Sri Lanka, known collectively as the P\u0101li canon, date to the fourth Buddhist council, which took place in 29 BCE.[16][17] Also called the *Teardrop of India*, or the *Granary of the East*, Sri Lanka's geographic location and deep harbours have made it of great strategic importance, from the earliest days of the ancient Silk Road trade route to today's so-called maritime Silk Road.[18][19][20] Because its location made it a major trading hub, it was already known to both East Asians and Europeans as long ago as the Anuradhapura period. During a period of great political crisis in the Kingdom of Kotte, the Portuguese arrived in Sri Lanka and sought to control the island's maritime trade, with a part of Sri Lanka subsequently becoming a Portuguese possession. After the Sinhalese-Portuguese war, the Dutch Empire and the Kingdom of Kandy took control of those areas. The Dutch possessions were then taken by the British, who later extended their control over the whole island, colonising it from 1815 to 1948. A national movement for political independence arose in the early 20th century, and in 1948, Ceylon became a dominion. The dominion was succeeded by the republic of Sri Lanka in 1972. Sri Lanka's more recent history was marred by a 26-year civil war, which began in 1983 and ended in 2009, when the Sri Lanka Armed Forces defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.[21]\n\n\nSri Lanka is a developing country, ranking 73rd on the Human Development Index. It is the highest-ranked South Asian nation in terms of development and has the second-highest per capita income in South Asia. However, the ongoing economic crisis has resulted in the collapse of its currency, rising inflation, and a humanitarian crisis due to a severe shortage of essentials. It has also led to an eruption of street protests, with citizens successfully demanding that the President and the Government step down.[22] The country has had a long history of engagement with modern international groups: it is a founding member of the SAARC and a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the G77 and the Non-Aligned Movement.\n\n\n\n\n## Toponymy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Sri Lanka\n\nIn antiquity, Sri Lanka was known to travellers by a variety of names. According to the *Mah\u0101va\u1e43sa*, the legendary Prince Vijaya named the island Tambapa\u1e47\u1e47\u0129 (\"copper-red hands\" or \"copper-red earth\"), because his followers' hands were reddened by the red soil of the area where he landed.[23][24] In Hindu mythology, the term *Lank\u0101* (\"Island\") appears but it is unknown whether it refers to the modern day state. The Tamil term Eelam (Tamil: \u0b88\u0bb4\u0bae\u0bcd, romanized:\u00a0*\u012b\u1e3bam*) was used to designate the whole island in Sangam literature.[25][26] The island was known under Chola rule as *Mummudi Cholamandalam* (\"realm of the three crowned Cholas\").[27]\n\n\nAncient Greek geographers called it *Taproban\u0101* (Ancient Greek: \u03a4\u03b1\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u1fb6) or *Taproban\u0113* (\u03a4\u03b1\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u1fc6)[28] from the word *Tambapanni*. The Persians and Arabs referred to it as *Sarand\u012bb* (the origin of the word \"serendipity\") from Sanskrit *Si\u1e43haladv\u012bpa\u1e25*.[29][30] *Ceil\u00e3o*, the name given to Sri Lanka by the Portuguese Empire when it arrived in 1505,[31] was transliterated into English as **Ceylon**.[32] As a British crown colony, the island was known as Ceylon; it achieved independence as the Dominion of Ceylon in 1948.\n\n\nThe country is now known in Sinhala as **\u015ar\u012b La\u1e45k\u0101** (Sinhala: \u0dc1\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd3 \u0dbd\u0d82\u0d9a\u0dcf) and in Tamil as **Ila\u1e45kai** (Tamil: \u0b87\u0bb2\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc8, IPA: [i\u02c8la\u014b\u0261a\u026a]). In 1972, its formal name was changed to \"Free, Sovereign and Independent Republic of Sri Lanka\". Later, on 7 September 1978, it was changed to the \"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\".[33][34] As the name Ceylon still appears in the names of a number of organisations, the Sri Lankan government announced in 2011 a plan to rename all those over which it has authority.[35]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Sri Lanka\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prehistory of Sri Lanka\n\nThe pre-history of Sri Lanka goes back 125,000 years and possibly even as far back as 500,000 years.[36] The era spans the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and early Iron Ages. Among the Paleolithic human settlements discovered in Sri Lanka, Pahiyangala (37,000 BP), named after the Chinese traveller monk Faxian;[37] Batadombalena (28,500 BP);[38] and Belilena (12,000 BP) are the most important. In these caves, archaeologists have found the remains of anatomically modern humans which they have named Balangoda Man, and other evidence[39] suggesting that they may have engaged in agriculture and kept domestic dogs for driving game.[40]\n\n\nThe earliest inhabitants of Sri Lanka were probably ancestors of the Vedda people,[41] an indigenous people numbering approximately 2,500 living in modern-day Sri Lanka.\n\n\nDuring the protohistoric period (1000\u2013500 BCE) Sri Lanka was culturally united with southern India,[42] and shared the same megalithic burials, pottery, iron technology, farming techniques and megalithic graffiti.[43][44] This cultural complex spread from southern India along with Dravidian clans such as the Velir, prior to the migration of Prakrit speakers.[45][46][43]\n\n\nOne of the first written references to the island is found in the Indian epic Ramayana, which provides details of a kingdom named *Lanka* that was created by the divine sculptor Vishvakarma for Kubera, the God of Wealth.[47] It is said that Kubera was overthrown by his rakshasa stepbrother, Ravana.[48]\n\n\n\n### Ancient history[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Pre Anuradhapura period and Anuradhapura period\n\n![](image)Ptolemy's world map of Ceylon, first century CE, in a 1535 publication\nAccording to the *Mah\u0101vamsa*, a P\u0101\u1e37i chronicle written in the 5th century CE, the original inhabitants of Sri Lanka are said to be the Yakshas and Nagas. Ancient cemeteries that were used before 600 BCE have also been discovered in Sri Lanka.[49] Sinhalese history traditionally starts in 543 BCE with the arrival of Prince Vijaya, a semi-legendary prince who sailed with 700 followers to Sri Lanka, after being expelled from Vanga Kingdom (present-day Bengal).[50] He established the Kingdom of Tambapanni, near modern-day Mannar. Vijaya (Singha) is the first of the approximately 189 monarchs of Sri Lanka described in chronicles such as the *Dipavamsa*, *Mah\u0101va\u1e43sa*, *C\u016b\u1e37ava\u1e43sa*, and *R\u0101j\u0101valiya*.[51]\n\n\nOnce Prakrit speakers had attained dominance on the island, the Mahavamsa further recounts the later migration of royal brides and service castes from the Tamil Pandya Kingdom to the Anuradhapura Kingdom in the early historic period.[52]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Avukana Buddha statue, a 12-metre-tall (39\u00a0ft) standing Buddha statue from the reign of Dhatusena of Anuradhapura, 5th century\nThe Anuradhapura period (377 BCE\u00a0\u2013 1017 CE) began with the establishment of the Anuradhapura Kingdom in 380 BCE during the reign of Pandukabhaya. Thereafter, Anuradhapura served as the capital city of the country for nearly 1,400 years.[53] Ancient Sri Lankans excelled at building certain types of structures such as tanks, dagobas and palaces.[54] Society underwent a major transformation during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa, with the arrival of Buddhism from India. In 250 BCE,[55] Mahinda, a bhikkhu and the son of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka arrived in Mihintale carrying the message of Buddhism.[56] His mission won over the monarch, who embraced the faith and propagated it throughout the Sinhalese population.[57]\n\n\nSucceeding kingdoms of Sri Lanka would maintain many Buddhist schools and monasteries and support the propagation of Buddhism into other countries in Southeast Asia. Sri Lankan Bhikkhus studied in India's famous ancient Buddhist University of Nalanda, which was destroyed by Bakhtiyar Khilji. It is probable that many of the scriptures from Nalanda are preserved in Sri Lanka's many monasteries and that the written form of the Tripi\u1e6daka, including Sinhalese Buddhist literature, were part of the University of Nalanda.[58] In 245 BCE, bhikkhuni Sanghamitta arrived with the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi tree, which is considered to be a sapling from the historical Bodhi Tree under which Gautama Buddha became enlightened.[59] It is considered the oldest human-planted tree (with a continuous historical record) in the world. (Bodhivamsa)[60][61]\n\n\nSri Lanka experienced the first of many foreign invasions during the reign of Suratissa, who was defeated by two horse traders named Sena and Guttika from South India.[57] The next invasion came immediately in 205 BCE by a Chola named Elara, who overthrew Asela and ruled the country for 44 years. Dutugamunu, the eldest son of the southern regional sub-king, Kavan Tissa, defeated Elara in the Battle of Vijithapura. During its two and a half millennia of existence, the Sinhala Kingdom was invaded at least eight times by neighbouring South Indian dynasties such as the Chola, Pandya, and Pallava.[*citation needed*] There also were incursions by the kingdoms of Kalinga (modern Odisha) and from the Malay Peninsula as well.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sigiriya (\"Lion Rock\"), a rock fortress and city, built by King Kashyapa (477\u2013495 CE) as a new more defensible capital. It was also used as a Buddhist monastery after the capital was moved back to Anuradhapura.\nThe Fourth Buddhist Council of Theravada Buddhism was held at the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya in Sri Lanka under the patronage of Valagamba of Anuradhapura in 25 BCE. The council was held in response to a year in which the harvests in Sri Lanka were particularly poor and many Buddhist monks subsequently died of starvation. Because the P\u0101li Canon was at that time oral literature maintained in several recensions by *dhammabh\u0101\u1e47aka*s (dharma reciters), the surviving monks recognised the danger of not writing it down so that even if some of the monks whose duty it was to study and remember parts of the Canon for later generations died, the teachings would not be lost.[62] After the council, palm-leaf manuscripts containing the completed Canon were taken to other countries such as Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos.\n\n\nSri Lanka was the first Asian country known to have a female ruler: Anula of Anuradhapura (r. 47\u201342 BCE).[63] Sri Lankan monarchs undertook some remarkable construction projects such as Sigiriya, the so-called \"Fortress in the Sky\", built during the reign of Kashyapa I of Anuradhapura, who ruled between 477 and 495. The Sigiriya rock fortress is surrounded by an extensive network of ramparts and moats. Inside this protective enclosure were gardens, ponds, pavilions, palaces and other structures.[64][65]\n\n\nIn 993 CE, the invasion of Chola emperor Rajaraja I forced the then Sinhalese ruler Mahinda V to flee to the southern part of Sri Lanka. Taking advantage of this situation, Rajendra I, son of Rajaraja I, launched a large invasion in 1017. Mahinda V was captured and taken to India, and the Cholas sacked the city of Anuradhapura causing the fall of Anuradhapura Kingdom. Subsequently, they moved the capital to Polonnaruwa.[66]\n\n\n\n### Post-classical period[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Polonnaruwa period and Transitional period of Sri Lanka\n\nFollowing a 17-year-long campaign, Vijayabahu I successfully drove the Chola out of Sri Lanka in 1070, reuniting the country for the first time in over a century.[67][68] Upon his request, ordained monks were sent from Burma to Sri Lanka to re-establish Buddhism, which had almost disappeared from the country during the Chola reign.[69] During the medieval period, Sri Lanka was divided into three sub-territories, namely, Ruhunu, Pihiti and Maya.[70]\n\n\n\n![](image)The seated image of Gal Vihara in Polonnaruwa, 12th century, which depicts the dhyana mudra, shows signs of Mahayana influence.\nSri Lanka's irrigation system was extensively expanded during the reign of Par\u0101kramab\u0101hu the Great (1153\u20131186).[71] This period is considered as a time when Sri Lanka was at the height of its power.[72][73] He built 1,470 reservoirs \u2013 the highest number by any ruler in Sri Lanka's history \u2013 repaired 165 dams, 3,910 canals, 163 major reservoirs, and 2,376 mini-reservoirs.[74] His most famous construction is the Parakrama Samudra,[75] the largest irrigation project of medieval Sri Lanka. Par\u0101kramab\u0101hu's reign is memorable for two major campaigns \u2013 in the south of India as part of a Pandyan war of succession, and a punitive strike against the kings of Ramanna (Burma) for various perceived insults to Sri Lanka.[76]\n\n\nAfter his demise, Sri Lanka gradually decayed in power. In 1215, Kalinga Magha, an invader with uncertain origins, identified as the founder of the Jaffna kingdom, invaded and captured the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa. He sailed from Kalinga[74] 690 nautical miles on 100 large ships with a 24,000 strong army. Unlike previous invaders, he looted, ransacked and destroyed everything in the ancient Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Kingdoms beyond recovery.[77] His priorities in ruling were to extract as much as possible from the land and overturn as many of the traditions of Rajarata as possible. His reign saw the massive migration of native Sinhalese people to the south and west of Sri Lanka, and into the mountainous interior, in a bid to escape his power.[78][79]\n\n\nSri Lanka never really recovered from the effects of Kalinga Magha's invasion. King Vijayab\u00e2hu III, who led the resistance, brought the kingdom to Dambadeniya. The north, in the meanwhile, eventually evolved into the Jaffna kingdom.[78][79] The Jaffna kingdom never came under the rule of any kingdom of the south except on one occasion; in 1450, following the conquest led by king Par\u00e2kramab\u00e2hu VI's adopted son, Prince Sapumal.[80] He ruled the North from 1450 to 1467 CE.[81]\n\n\nThe next three centuries starting from 1215 were marked by kaleidoscopically shifting collections of capitals in south and central Sri Lanka, including Dambadeniya, Yapahuwa, Gampola, Raigama, Kotte,[82] Sitawaka, and finally, Kandy. In 1247, the Malay kingdom of Tambralinga which was a vassal of the Srivijaya Empire led by their king Chandrabhanu[83] briefly invaded Sri Lanka from Insular Southeast Asia. They were then expelled by the South Indian Pandyan dynasty.[84] However, this temporary invasion reinforced the steady flow of the presence of various Austronesian merchant ethnic groups, from Sumatrans (Indonesia) to Lucoes (Philippines) into Sri Lanka which occurred since 200 BCE.[85] Chinese admiral Zheng He and his naval expeditionary force landed at Galle, Sri Lanka in 1409 and got into battle with the local king Vira Alakesvara of Gampola. Zheng He captured King Vira Alakesvara and later released him.[86][87][88][89] Zheng He erected the Galle Trilingual Inscription, a stone tablet at Galle written in three languages (Chinese, Tamil, and Persian), to commemorate his visit.[90][91] The stele was discovered by S. H. Thomlin at Galle in 1911 and is now preserved in the Colombo National Museum.\n\n\n\n### Early modern period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kandyan period\n\nSee also: Portuguese Ceylon, Dutch Ceylon, and British Ceylon period\n\n![](image)A 17th-century engraving of Dutch explorer Joris van Spilbergen meeting with King Vimaladharmasuriya in 1602\n![A 1595 map of Sri Lanka created by Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius](image)A 1595 map of Sri Lanka created by Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius\nThe early modern period of Sri Lanka begins with the arrival of Portuguese soldier and explorer Louren\u00e7o de Almeida, the son of Francisco de Almeida, in 1505.[92] In 1517, the Portuguese built a fort at the port city of Colombo and gradually extended their control over the coastal areas. In 1592, after decades of intermittent warfare with the Portuguese, Vimaladharmasuriya I moved his kingdom to the inland city of Kandy, a location he thought more secure from attack.[93] In 1619, succumbing to attacks by the Portuguese, the independent existence of the Jaffna kingdom came to an end.[94]\n\n\nDuring the reign of the Rajasinha II, Dutch explorers arrived on the island. In 1638, the king signed a treaty with the Dutch East India Company to get rid of the Portuguese who ruled most of the coastal areas.[95] The following Dutch\u2013Portuguese War resulted in a Dutch victory, with Colombo falling into Dutch hands by 1656. The Dutch remained in the areas they had captured, thereby violating the treaty they had signed in 1638. The Burgher people, a distinct ethnic group, emerged as a result of intermingling between the Dutch and native Sri Lankans in this period.[96]\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Kandy was the last independent monarchy of Sri Lanka.[97] In 1595, Vimaladharmasurya brought the sacred Tooth Relic\u2014the traditional symbol of royal and religious authority amongst the Sinhalese\u2014to Kandy and built the Temple of the Tooth.[97] In spite of on-going intermittent warfare with Europeans, the kingdom survived. Later, a crisis of succession emerged in Kandy upon king Vira Narendrasinha's death in 1739. He was married to a Telugu-speaking Nayakkar princess from South India (Madurai) and was childless by her.[97]\n\n\nEventually, with the support of bhikku Weliwita Sarankara and ignoring the right of *\"Unambuwe Bandara\"*, the crown passed to the brother of one of Narendrasinha's princesses, overlooking Narendrasinha's own son by a Sinhalese concubine.[98] The new king was crowned Sri Vijaya Rajasinha later that year. Kings of the Nayakkar dynasty launched several attacks on Dutch controlled areas, which proved to be unsuccessful.[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sri Vikrama Rajasinha of Kandy, the last ruling native Sri Lankan monarch\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, fearing that French control of the Netherlands might deliver Sri Lanka to the French, the British Empire occupied the coastal areas of the island (which they called the colony of British Ceylon) with little difficulty in 1796.[100] Two years later, in 1798, Sri Rajadhi Rajasinha, third of the four Nayakkar kings of Sri Lanka, died of a fever. Following his death, a nephew of Rajadhi Rajasinha, eighteen-year-old Kannasamy, was crowned.[101] The young king, now named Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, faced a British invasion in 1803 but successfully retaliated. The First Kandyan War ended in a stalemate.[101]\n\n\nBy then the entire coastal area was under the British East India Company as a result of the Treaty of Amiens. On 14 February 1815, Kandy was occupied by the British in the second Kandyan War, ending Sri Lanka's independence.[101] Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, the last native monarch of Sri Lanka, was exiled to India.[102] The Kandyan Convention formally ceded the entire country to the British Empire. Attempts by Sri Lankan noblemen to undermine British power in 1818 during the Uva Rebellion were thwarted by Governor Robert Brownrigg.[103]\n\n\nThe beginning of the modern period of Sri Lanka is marked by the Colebrooke-Cameron reforms of 1833.[104] They introduced a utilitarian and liberal political culture to the country based on the rule of law and amalgamated the Kandyan and maritime provinces as a single unit of government.[104] An executive council and a legislative council were established, later becoming the foundation of a representative legislature. By this time, experiments with coffee plantations were largely successful.[105]\n\n\nSoon, coffee became the primary commodity export of Sri Lanka. Falling coffee prices as a result of the depression of 1847 stalled economic development and prompted the governor to introduce a series of taxes on firearms, dogs, shops, boats, etc., and to reintroduce a form of *rajakariya*, requiring six days free labour on roads or payment of a cash equivalent.[105] These harsh measures antagonised the locals, and another rebellion broke out in 1848.[106] A devastating leaf disease, *Hemileia vastatrix*, struck the coffee plantations in 1869, destroying the entire industry within fifteen years.[107] The British quickly found a replacement: abandoning coffee, they began cultivating tea instead. Tea production in Sri Lanka thrived in the following decades. Large-scale rubber plantations began in the early 20th century.\n\n\n\n![](image)British appointed Kandyan chief headmen in 1905.\nBy the end of the 19th century, a new educated social class transcending race and caste arose through British attempts to staff the Ceylon Civil Service and the legal, educational, engineering, and medical professions with natives.[108] New leaders represented the various ethnic groups of the population in the Ceylon Legislative Council on a communal basis. Buddhist and Hindu revivalism reacted against Christian missionary activities.[109][110] The first two decades in the 20th century are noted by the unique harmony among Sinhalese and Tamil political leadership, which has since been lost.[111]\n\n\nThe 1906 malaria outbreak in Ceylon actually started in the early 1900s, but the first case was documented in 1906.\n\n\nIn 1919, major Sinhalese and Tamil political organisations united to form the Ceylon National Congress, under the leadership of Ponnambalam Arunachalam,[112] pressing colonial masters for more constitutional reforms. But without massive popular support, and with the governor's encouragement for \"communal representation\" by creating a \"Colombo seat\" that dangled between Sinhalese and Tamils, the Congress lost momentum towards the mid-1920s.[113]\n\n\nThe Donoughmore reforms of 1931 repudiated the communal representation and introduced universal adult franchise (the franchise stood at 4% before the reforms). This step was strongly criticised by the Tamil political leadership, who realised that they would be reduced to a minority in the newly created State Council of Ceylon, which succeeded the legislative council.[114][115] In 1937, Tamil leader G. G. Ponnambalam demanded a 50\u201350 representation (50% for the Sinhalese and 50% for other ethnic groups) in the State Council. However, this demand was not met by the Soulbury reforms of 1944\u201345.\n\n\n\n### Contemporary history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Sri Lanka (1948\u2013present)\n\nSee also: Sri Lankan independence movement and Sri Lankan Civil War\n\n![](image)The formal ceremony marking the start of self-rule, with the opening of the first parliament at Independence Square\n![](image)J. R. Jayewardene was the most influential political figure of Sri Lanka in the 1970s\nThe Soulbury constitution ushered in dominion status, with independence proclaimed on 4 February 1948.[116] D. S. Senanayake became the first Prime Minister of Ceylon.[117] Prominent Tamil leaders including Ponnambalam and Arunachalam Mahadeva joined his cabinet.[114][118] The British Royal Navy remained stationed at Trincomalee until 1956. A countrywide popular demonstration against withdrawal of the rice rations resulted in the resignation of prime minister Dudley Senanayake.[119]\n\n\nS. W. R. D. Bandaranaike was elected prime minister in 1956. His three-year rule had a profound influence through his self-proclaimed role of \"defender of the besieged Sinhalese culture\".[120] He introduced the controversial Sinhala Only Act, recognising Sinhala as the only official language of the government. Although partially reversed in 1958, the bill posed a grave concern for the Tamil community, which perceived in it a threat to their language and culture.[121][122][123]\n\n\nThe Federal Party (FP) launched a movement of non-violent resistance (satyagraha) against the bill, which prompted Bandaranaike to reach an agreement (Bandaranaike\u2013Chelvanayakam Pact) with S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, leader of the FP, to resolve the looming ethnic conflict.[124] The pact proved ineffective in the face of ongoing protests by opposition and the Buddhist clergy. The bill, together with various government colonisation schemes, contributed much towards the political rancour between Sinhalese and Tamil political leaders.[125] Bandaranaike was assassinated by an extremist Buddhist monk in 1959.[126]\n\n\n\nLeaders in 1960\n![](image)\nElizabeth II  \nQueen of Ceylon\n![](image)\nSirimavo Bandaranaike  \nPrime Minister\n1960 saw the election of Sirimavo Bandaranaike as Ceylon's Prime Minister and the first time in world history that the heads of both state and government in a country were female.\n\nSirimavo Bandaranaike, the widow of Bandaranaike, took office as prime minister in 1960, and withstood an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat in 1962. During her second term as prime minister, the government instituted socialist economic policies, strengthening ties with the Soviet Union and China, while promoting a policy of non-alignment. In 1971, Ceylon experienced a Marxist insurrection, which was quickly suppressed. In 1972, the country became a republic named Sri Lanka, repudiating its dominion status. Prolonged minority grievances and the use of communal emotionalism as an election campaign weapon by both Sinhalese and Tamil leaders abetted a fledgling Tamil militancy in the north during the 1970s.[127] The policy of standardisation by the Sirimavo government to rectify disparities created in university enrollment, which was in essence an affirmative action to assist geographically disadvantaged students to obtain tertiary education,[128] resulted in reducing the proportion of Tamil students at university level and acted as the immediate catalyst for the rise of militancy.[129][130] The assassination of Jaffna Mayor Alfred Duraiyappah in 1975 by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) marked a crisis point.[131][132]\n\n\nThe government of J. R. Jayawardene swept to power in 1977, defeating the largely unpopular United Front government.[133] Jayawardene introduced a new constitution, together with a free-market economy and a powerful executive presidency modelled after that of France. It made Sri Lanka the first South Asian country to liberalise its economy.[134] Beginning in 1983, ethnic tensions were manifested in an on-and-off insurgency against the government by the LTTE. An LTTE attack on 13 soldiers resulted in the start of a civil war, and in response anti-Tamil race riots took place, allegedly backed by Sinhalese hard-line ministers, which resulted in more than 150,000 Tamil civilians fleeing the island, seeking asylum in other countries.[135][136]\n\n\nLapses in foreign policy resulted in India strengthening the Tigers by providing arms and training.[137][138][139] In 1987, the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord was signed and the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) was deployed in northern Sri Lanka to stabilise the region by neutralising the LTTE.[140] The same year, the JVP launched its second insurrection in Southern Sri Lanka,[141] necessitating redeployment of the IPKF in 1990.[142] In October 1990, the LTTE expelled Sri Lankan Moors (Muslims by religion) from northern Sri Lanka.[143] In 2002, the Sri Lankan government and LTTE signed a Norwegian-mediated ceasefire agreement.[123]\n\n\nThe 2004 Asian tsunami killed over 30,000 and displaced over 500,000 people in Sri Lanka.[144][145] From 1985 to 2006, the Sri Lankan government and Tamil insurgents held four rounds of peace talks without success. Both LTTE and the government resumed fighting in 2006, and the government officially backed out of the ceasefire in 2008.[123] In 2009, under the Presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Sri Lanka Armed Forces defeated the LTTE, bringing an end to the civil war on 19 May 2009,[146][147][148][149] and re-established control of the entire country by the Sri Lankan Government.[150] Overall, between 60,000 and 100,000 people were killed during the course of the 26 years of conflict.[151][152]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ranil Wickremesinghe has been serving as Prime Minister of Sri Lanka since 2022.\n2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings carried out by the terrorist group National Thowheeth Jama'ath on 21 April 2019 resulted in the death of 261 innocent people.[153] On 26 April 2019 an anti terrorist operation was carried out against the National Thowheeth Jama'ath by the Sri Lanka Army with the operation being successful and National Thowheeth Jama'ath's insurgency ending.[154][155][156]\n\n\nEconomic troubles in Sri Lanka began in 2019, when a severe economic crisis occurred caused by rapidly increasing foreign debt, massive government budget deficits due to tax cuts, falling foreign remittances, a food crisis caused by mandatory organic farming along with a ban on chemical fertilizers, and a multitude of other factors.[157] The Sri Lankan Government officially declared the ongoing crisis to be the worst economic crisis in the country in 73 years.[158] In August 2021, a food emergency was declared.[159] In June 2022, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe declared the collapse of the Sri Lankan economy in parliament.[160] The crisis resulted in Sri Lanka defaulting on its $51 billion sovereign debt for the first time in its history, along with double-digit inflation, a crippling energy crisis that led to approximately 15 hour power cuts, severe fuel shortages leading to the suspension of fuel to all non-essential vehicles, and more such economic disorder.[161][162] Due to the crisis, massive street protests erupted all over the country, with protesters demanding the resignation of the then-incumbent President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The protests culminated with the storming and siege of the President's House on July 9, 2022, and resulted in President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fleeing to Singapore[163] and later emailing his resignation to parliament, formally announcing his resignation and making him the first Sri Lankan president to resign in the middle of his term.[164] On the same day the President's House was stormed, protesters sieged and stormed the private residence of the prime minister and burnt it down.[165]\n\n\nAfter winning the 2022 Sri Lankan presidential election, on 21 July 2022, Ranil Wickremesinghe took oath as the ninth President of Sri Lanka.[166] He implemented various economic reforms in efforts to stabilize Sri Lanka's economy.[167]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Sri Lanka\n\n![A roughly oval island with a mountainous centre](image)Topographic map of Sri Lanka\nSri Lanka, an island in South Asia shaped as a teardrop or a pear/mango,[168] lies on the Indian Plate, a major tectonic plate that was formerly part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[169] It is in the Indian Ocean southwest of the Bay of Bengal, between latitudes 5\u00b0 and 10\u00b0\u00a0N, and longitudes 79\u00b0 and 82\u00b0\u00a0E.[170] Sri Lanka is separated from the mainland portion of the Indian subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Strait. According to Hindu mythology, a land bridge existed between the Indian mainland and Sri Lanka. It now amounts to only a chain of limestone shoals remaining above sea level.[171] Legends claim that it was passable on foot up to 1480 CE, until cyclones deepened the channel.[172][173] Portions are still as shallow as 1 metre (3\u00a0ft), hindering navigation.[174] The island consists mostly of flat to rolling coastal plains, with mountains rising only in the south-central part. The highest point is Pidurutalagala, reaching 2,524 metres (8,281\u00a0ft) above sea level.\n\n\n\n![](image)A view of Sripada from Maskeliya\nSri Lanka has 103 rivers. The longest of these is the Mahaweli River, extending 335 kilometres (208\u00a0mi).[175] These waterways give rise to 51 natural waterfalls of 10 metres (33\u00a0ft) or more. The highest is Bambarakanda Falls, with a height of 263 metres (863\u00a0ft).[176] Sri Lanka's coastline is 1,585\u00a0km (985\u00a0mi) long.[177] Sri Lanka claims an exclusive economic zone extending 200 nautical miles, which is approximately 6.7 times Sri Lanka's land area. The coastline and adjacent waters support highly productive marine ecosystems such as fringing coral reefs and shallow beds of coastal and estuarine seagrasses.[178]\n\n\nSri Lanka has 45 estuaries and 40 lagoons.[177] Sri Lanka's mangrove ecosystem spans over 7,000 hectares and played a vital role in buffering the force of the waves in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.[179] The island is rich in minerals such as ilmenite, feldspar, graphite, silica, kaolin, mica and thorium.[180][181] Existence of petroleum and gas in the Gulf of Mannar has also been confirmed, and the extraction of recoverable quantities is underway.[182]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Forestry in Sri Lanka\n\n![](image)Sri Lanka map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification\nThe climate is tropical and warm because of moderating effects of ocean winds. Mean temperatures range from 17\u00a0\u00b0C (62.6\u00a0\u00b0F) in the central highlands, where frost may occur for several days in the winter, to a maximum of 33\u00a0\u00b0C (91.4\u00a0\u00b0F) in low-altitude areas. Average yearly temperatures range from 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82.4\u00a0\u00b0F) to nearly 31\u00a0\u00b0C (87.8\u00a0\u00b0F). Day and night temperatures may vary by 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57.2\u00a0\u00b0F) to 18\u00a0\u00b0C (64.4\u00a0\u00b0F).[183]\n\n\nThe rainfall pattern is influenced by monsoon winds from the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal. The \"wet zone\" and some of the windward slopes of the central highlands receive up to 2,500 millimetres (98.4\u00a0in) of rain each year, but the leeward slopes in the east and northeast receive little rain. Most of the east, southeast, and northern parts of Sri Lanka constitute the \"dry zone\", which receives between 1,200 and 1,900\u00a0mm (47 and 75\u00a0in) of rain annually.[184]\n\n\nThe arid northwest and southeast coasts receive the least rain at 800 to 1,200\u00a0mm (31 to 47\u00a0in) per year. Periodic squalls occur and sometimes tropical cyclones bring overcast skies and rains to the southwest, northeast, and eastern parts of the island. Humidity is typically higher in the southwest and mountainous areas and depends on the seasonal patterns of rainfall.[185] An increase in average rainfall coupled with heavier rainfall events has resulted in recurrent flooding and related damages to infrastructure, utility supply and the urban economy.[186]\n\n\n\n### Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environment of Sri Lanka and Wildlife of Sri Lanka\n\nSee also: List of mammals of Sri Lanka and List of birds of Sri Lanka\n\n![](image)The Sri Lankan elephant is one of three recognised subspecies of the Asian elephant. The 2011 elephant census estimated a population of 5,879.[187]\nWestern Ghats of India and Sri Lanka were included among the first 18 global biodiversity hotspots due to high levels of species endemism. The number of biodiversity hotspots has now increased to 34.[188] Sri Lanka has the highest biodiversity per unit area among Asian countries for flowering plants and all vertebrate groups except birds.[189] A remarkably high proportion of the species among its flora and fauna, 27% of the 3,210 flowering plants and 22% of the mammals, are endemic.[190] Sri Lanka supports a rich avifauna of that stands at 453 species and this include 240 species of birds that are known to breed in the country. 33 species are accepted by some ornithologists as endemic while some ornithologists consider only 27 are endemic and the remaining six are considered as proposed endemics.[191] Sri Lanka's protected areas are administrated by two government bodies; The Department of Forest Conservation and the Department of Wildlife Conservation. Department of Wildlife Conservation administrates 61 wildlife sanctuaries, 22 national parks, four nature reserves, three strict nature reserves, and one jungle corridor while Department of Forest Conservation oversees 65 conservation forests and one national heritage wilderness area. 26.5% of the country's land area is legally protected. This is a higher percentage of protected areas when compared to the rest of Asia.[192]\n\n\nSri Lanka contains four terrestrial ecoregions: Sri Lanka lowland rain forests, Sri Lanka montane rain forests, Sri Lanka dry-zone dry evergreen forests, and Deccan thorn scrub forests.[193] Flowering acacias flourish on the arid Jaffna Peninsula. Among the trees of the dry-land forests are valuable species such as satinwood, ebony, ironwood, mahogany and teak. The wet zone is a tropical evergreen forest with tall trees, broad foliage, and a dense undergrowth of vines and creepers. Subtropical evergreen forests resembling those of temperate climates flourish in the higher altitudes.[194]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sri Lankan leopard (*Panthera pardus kotiya*) is an endangered subspecies of leopard native to Sri Lanka.\nYala National Park in the southeast protects herds of elephant, deer, and peacocks. The Wilpattu National Park in the northwest, the largest national park, preserves the habitats of many water birds such as storks, pelicans, ibis, and spoonbills. The island has four biosphere reserves: Bundala, Hurulu Forest Reserve, the Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya, and Sinharaja.[195] Sinharaja is home to 26 endemic birds and 20 rainforest species, including the elusive red-faced malkoha, the green-billed coucal and the Sri Lanka blue magpie. The untapped genetic potential of Sinharaja flora is enormous. Of the 211 woody trees and lianas within the reserve, 139 (66%) are endemic. The total vegetation density, including trees, shrubs, herbs, and seedlings, has been estimated at 240,000 individuals per hectare. The Minneriya National Park borders the Minneriya Tank, which is an important source of water for elephants inhabiting the surrounding forests. Dubbed \"The Gathering\", the congregation of elephants can be seen on the tank-bed in the late dry season (August to October) as the surrounding water sources steadily disappear. The park also encompasses a range of micro-habitats which include classic dry zone tropical monsoonal evergreen forest, thick stands of giant bamboo, hilly pastures (patanas), and grasslands (talawas).[196]\n\n\n\n![](image)Maha rath mala (*Rhododendron arboreum* ssp. *zeylanicum*) is a rare sub-species of *Rhododendron arboreum* found in Central Highlands of Sri Lanka.\nDuring the Mahaweli Program of the 1970s and 1980s in northern Sri Lanka, the government set aside four areas of land totalling 1,900\u00a0km2 (730\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) as national parks. Statistics of Sri Lanka's forest cover show rapid deforestation from 1956 to 2010. In 1956, 44.2 percent of the country's land area had forest cover. Forest cover depleted rapidly in recent decades; 29.6 percent in 1999, 28.7 percent in 2010.[197]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion** with: is missing explication of the constitutional socialist nature of the republic that is reflected in the formal name of the country: \"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\".

It now serves as the Presidential Secretariat's headquarters.\nSri Lanka is a democratic republic and a unitary state which is governed by a semi-presidential system.[198] Sri Lanka is the oldest democracy in Asia.[199] Most provisions of the constitution can be amended by a two-thirds majority in parliament. The amendment of certain basic features such as the clauses on language, religion, and reference to Sri Lanka as a unitary state require both a two-thirds majority and approval in a nationwide referendum.\n\n\nIn common with many democracies, the Sri Lankan government has three branches:\n\n\n\n* **Executive**: The President of Sri Lanka is the head of state; the commander in chief of the armed forces; chief executive, and is popularly elected for a five-year term.[200] The president heads the cabinet and appoints ministers from elected members of parliament.[201] The president is immune from legal proceedings while in the office with respect to any acts done or omitted to be done by him or her in either an official or private capacity.[202] Following the passage of the 19th amendment to the constitution in 2015, the president has two terms, which previously stood at no term limit.\n* **Legislative**: The Parliament of Sri Lanka is a unicameral 225-member legislature with 196 members elected from 22 multi-seat constituencies and 29 elected by proportional representation.[203] Members are elected by universal suffrage for a five-year term. The president may summon, suspend, or end a legislative session and dissolve Parliament at any time after four and a half years. The parliament reserves the power to make all laws.[204] The president's deputy and head of government, the prime minister, leads the ruling party in parliament and shares many executive responsibilities, mainly in domestic affairs.\n\n\n![](image)The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, Colombo\n* **Judicial**: Sri Lanka's judiciary consists of a Supreme Court \u2013 the highest and final superior court of record,[204] a Court of Appeal, High Courts and a number of subordinate courts. The highly complex legal system reflects diverse cultural influences.[205] Criminal law is based almost entirely on British law. Basic civil law derives from Roman-Dutch law. Laws pertaining to marriage, divorce, and inheritance are communal.[206] Because of ancient customary practices and religion, the Sinhala customary law (Kandyan law), the Thesavalamai, and Sharia law are followed in special cases.[207] The president appoints judges to the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, and the High Courts. A judicial service commission, composed of the chief justice and two Supreme Court judges, appoints, transfers, and dismisses lower court judges.\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Sri Lanka and Elections in Sri Lanka\n\n\n\n| ![Sri Lanka](image) National symbols of Sri Lanka |\n| --- |\n| Flag | Lion Flag |\n| Emblem | Gold Lion Passant |\n| Anthem | \"Sri Lanka Matha\" |\n| Butterfly | Sri Lankan birdwing |\n| Animal | Grizzled giant squirrel |\n| Bird | Sri Lanka junglefowl |\n| Flower | Blue water lily |\n| Tree | Ceylon ironwood (n\u0101) |\n| Sport | Volleyball |\n| Source: [208][209] |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nThe current political culture in Sri Lanka is a contest between two rival coalitions led by the centre-left and progressive United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA), an offspring of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), and the comparatively right-wing and pro-capitalist United National Party (UNP).[210] Sri Lanka is essentially a multi-party democracy with many smaller Buddhist, socialist, and Tamil nationalist political parties. As of July 2011, the number of registered political parties in the country is 67.[211] Of these, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), established in 1935, is the oldest.[212]\n\n\nThe UNP, established by D. S. Senanayake in 1946, was until recently the largest single political party.[213] It is the only political group which had representation in all parliaments since independence.[213] SLFP was founded by S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike in July 1951.[214] SLFP registered its first victory in 1956, defeating the ruling UNP in the 1956 Parliamentary election.[214] Following the parliamentary election in July 1960, Sirimavo Bandaranaike became the prime minister and the world's first elected female head of government.[215]\n\n\nG. G. Ponnambalam, the Tamil nationalist counterpart of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike,[216] founded the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) in 1944. Objecting to Ponnambalam's cooperation with D. S. Senanayake, a dissident group led by S.J.V. Chelvanayakam broke away in 1949 and formed the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK), also known as the Federal Party, becoming the main Tamil political party in Sri Lanka for next two decades.[217] The Federal Party advocated a more aggressive stance toward the Sinhalese.[218] With the constitutional reforms of 1972, the ACTC and ITAK created the Tamil United Front (later Tamil United Liberation Front). Following a period of turbulence as Tamil militants rose to power in the late 1970s, these Tamil political parties were succeeded in October 2001 by the Tamil National Alliance.[218][219] Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, a Marxist\u2013Leninist political party founded by Rohana Wijeweera in 1965, serves as a third force in the current political context.[220] It endorses leftist policies which are more radical than the traditionalist leftist politics of the LSSP and the Communist Party.[218] Founded in 1981, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress is the largest Muslim political party in Sri Lanka.[221]\n\n\nPresident Mahinda Rajapaksa lost the 2015 presidential elections, ending his ten-year presidency. However, his successor as Sri Lankan President, Maithripala Sirisena, decided not to seek re-election in 2019.[222] The Rajapaksa family regained power in November 2019 presidential elections when Mahinda's younger brother and former wartime defence chief Gotabaya Rajapaksa won the election, and he was later sworn in as the new president of Sri Lanka.[223][224] Their firm grip of power was consolidated in the parliamentary elections in August 2020. The family's political party, Sri Lanka People's Front (known by its Sinhala initials SLPP), obtained a landslide victory and a clear majority in the parliament. Five members of the Rajapaksa family won seats in the new parliament. Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa became the new prime minister.[225]\n\n\nIn 2022, a political crisis started due to the power struggle between President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the Parliament of Sri Lanka. The crisis was fuelled by anti-government protests and demonstrations by the public and also due to the worsening economy of Sri Lanka since 2019. The anti-government sentiment across various parts of Sri Lanka has triggered unprecedented political instability, creating shockwaves in the political arena.[226]\n\n\nOn July 20, 2022, Ranil Wickremesinghe was elected as the ninth President via a parliamentarian election.[227]\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of Sri Lanka\n\nFor administrative purposes, Sri Lanka is divided into nine provinces[228] and twenty-five districts.[229]\n\n\n\n### Provinces[edit]\n\n\nProvinces in Sri Lanka have existed since the 19th century, but they had no legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment of the 1978 constitution established provincial councils after several decades of increasing demand for a decentralisation of the government.[230] Each provincial council is an autonomous body not under the authority of any ministry. Some of its functions had been undertaken by central government ministries, departments, corporations, and statutory authorities,[230] but authority over land and police is not as a rule given to provincial councils.[231][232] Between 1989 and 2006, the Northern and Eastern provinces were temporarily merged to form the North-East Province.[233][234] Prior to 1987, all administrative tasks for the provinces were handled by a district-based civil service which had been in place since colonial times. Now each province is administered by a directly elected provincial council:\n\n\n\n![](image)\n*Bay of Bengal*\n\n*Palk Strait*\n\nNorthern Province\n\n*Gulf of  \nMannar*\n\nNorth Central Province\n\nNorth Western  \nProvince\n\nEastern  \nProvince\n\nCentral  \nProvince\n\nUva Province\n\nWestern  \nProvince\n\nSabaragamuwa  \nProvince\n\nSouthern Province\n\n*Indian Ocean*\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Province | Capital | Area(km2) | Population (2012)[235] | Density(Persons per km2) | Provincial GDP share (%) (2021)[236] | Sri Lanka Prosperity Index (2021)[237] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Central | Kandy | 5,674 | 2,571,557 | 453 | 10.1 | 0.559\n |\n| Eastern | Trincomalee | 9,996 | 1,555,510 | 155 | 5.5 | 0.519\n |\n| North Central | Anuradhapura | 10,714 | 1,266,663 | 118 | 4.9 | 0.521\n |\n| Northern | Jaffna | 8,884 | 1,061,315 | 119 | 4.2 | 0.564\n |\n| North Western | Kurunegala | 7,812 | 2,380,861 | 305 | 11.1 | 0.541\n |\n| Sabaragamuwa | Ratnapura | 4,902 | 1,928,655 | 393 | 7.3 | 0.499\n |\n| Southern | Galle | 5,559 | 2,477,285 | 446 | 9.1 | 0.582\n |\n| Uva | Badulla | 8,488 | 1,266,463 | 149 | 5.2 | 0.468\n |\n| Western | Colombo | 3,709 | 5,851,130 | 1,578 | 42.6 | 0.802\n |\n| Sri Lanka | Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte(Administrative) and Colombo (Mercantile) | 65,610 | 20,359,439 | 310 | 100 | 0.796\n |\n\n |\n\n\n\n### Districts and local authorities[edit]\n\n\nEach district is administered under a district secretariat. The districts are further subdivided into 256 divisional secretariats, and these to approximately 14,008 Grama Niladhari divisions.[238] The districts are known in Sinhala as *disa* and in Tamil as *m\u0101waddam*. Originally, a *disa* (usually rendered into English as Dissavony) was a duchy, notably Matale and Uva.\n\n\nThere are three other types of local authorities: municipal councils (18), urban councils (13) and pradeshiya sabha, also called pradesha sabhai (256).[239] Local authorities were originally based on feudal counties named *korale* and *rata*, and were formerly known as \"D.R.O. divisions\" after the divisional revenue officer.[240] Later, the D.R.O.s became \"assistant government agents,\" and the divisions were known as \"A.G.A. divisions\". These divisional secretariats are currently administered by a divisional secretary.\n\n\n\n## Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Sri Lanka\nSee also: Sri Lanka and the Non-Aligned Movement\n\n![](image)President J. R. Jayewardene gifting Jayathu, a baby elephant to US President Ronald Reagan in 1984\nSri Lanka is a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). While ensuring that it maintains its independence, Sri Lanka has cultivated relations with India.[241] Sri Lanka became a member of the United Nations in 1955. Today, it is also a member of the Commonwealth, the SAARC, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, and the Colombo Plan.\n\n\nThe United National Party has traditionally favoured links with the West, while the Sri Lanka Freedom Party has favoured links with the East.[241] Sri Lankan Finance Minister J. R. Jayewardene, together with then Australian Foreign Minister Sir Percy Spencer, proposed the Colombo Plan at the Commonwealth Foreign Minister's Conference held in Colombo in 1950.[242] At the San Francisco Peace Conference in 1951, while many countries were reluctant, Sri Lanka argued for a free Japan and refused to accept payment of reparations for World War II damage because it believed it would harm Japan's economy.[243] Sri Lanka-China relations started as soon as the People's Republic of China was formed in 1949. The two countries signed an important Rubber-Rice Pact in 1952.[244] Sri Lanka played a vital role at the Asian\u2013African Conference in 1955, which was an important step in the crystallisation of the NAM.[245]\n\n\nThe Bandaranaike government of 1956 significantly changed the pro-western policies set by the previous UNP government. It recognised Cuba under Fidel Castro in 1959. Shortly afterward, Cuba's revolutionary Che Guevara paid a visit to Sri Lanka.[246] The Sirima-Shastri Pact of 1964[247] and Sirima-Gandhi Pact of 1974[248] were signed between Sri Lankan and Indian leaders in an attempt to solve the long-standing dispute over the status of plantation workers of Indian origin. In 1974, Kachchatheevu, a small island in Palk Strait, was formally ceded to Sri Lanka.[249] By this time, Sri Lanka was strongly involved in the NAM, and the fifth NAM summit was held in Colombo in 1976.[250] The relationship between Sri Lanka and India became tense under the government of J. R. Jayawardene.[142][251] As a result, India intervened in the Sri Lankan Civil War and subsequently deployed an Indian Peace Keeping Force in 1987.[252] In the present, Sri Lanka enjoys extensive relations with China,[253] Russia,[254] and Pakistan.[255]\n\n\n\n## Military[edit]\n\n\nThe Sri Lanka Armed Forces, comprising the Sri Lanka Army, the Sri Lanka Navy, and the Sri Lanka Air Force, come under the purview of the Ministry of Defence.[256] The total strength of the three services is around 346,000 personnel, with nearly 36,000 reserves.[257] Sri Lanka has not enforced military conscription.[258] Paramilitary units include the Special Task Force, the Civil Security Force, and the Sri Lanka Coast Guard.[259][260]\n\n\nSince independence in 1948, the primary focus of the armed forces has been internal security, crushing three major insurgencies, two by Marxist militants of the JVP and a 26-year-long conflict with the LTTE. The armed forces have been in a continuous mobilised state for the last 30 years.[261][262] The Sri Lankan Armed Forces have engaged in United Nations peacekeeping operations since the early 1960s, contributing forces to permanent contingents deployed in several UN peacekeeping missions in Chad, Lebanon, and Haiti.[263]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Sri Lanka\n\nSee also: Agriculture in Sri Lanka, Tea production in Sri Lanka, Tourism in Sri Lanka, and Transport in Sri Lanka\n\n![](image)Development of real GDP per capita, 1820 to 2018\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, Sri Lanka's GDP in terms of purchasing power parity is the second highest in the South Asian region in terms of per capita income. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Sri Lanka became a plantation economy famous for its production and export of cinnamon, rubber, and Ceylon tea, which remains a trademark national export.[264] The development of modern ports under British rule raised the strategic importance of the island as a centre of trade.[265] From 1948 to 1977, socialism strongly influenced the government's economic policies. Colonial plantations were dismantled, industries were nationalised, and a welfare state established. In 1977, the free market economy was introduced to the country, incorporating privatisation, deregulation, and the promotion of private enterprise.[134]\n\n\n\n![](image)The World Trade Center in Colombo. Presidential Secretariat, Bank of Ceylon and Galadari Hotel are also visible in the image.\nWhile the production and export of tea, rubber, coffee, sugar, and other commodities remain important, industrialisation has increased the importance of food processing, textiles, telecommunications, and finance. The country's main economic sectors are tourism, tea export, clothing, rice production, and other agricultural products. In addition to these economic sectors, overseas employment, especially in the Middle East, contributes substantially in foreign exchange.[266]\n\n\nAs of 2020[update], the service sector makes up 59.7% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.2%, and the agriculture sector 8.4%.[267] The private sector accounts for 85% of the economy.[268] China, India and the United States are Sri Lanka's largest trading partners.[269] Economic disparities exist between the provinces with the Western Province contributing 45.1% of the GDP and the Southern Province and the Central Province contributing 10.7% and 10%, respectively.[270] With the end of the war, the Northern Province reported a record 22.9% GDP growth in 2010.[271]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sri Lanka's most widely known export, Ceylon tea, which ISO considers the cleanest tea in the world in terms of pesticide residues. Sri Lanka is also the world's 2nd largest exporter of tea.[272]\nThe per capita income of Sri Lanka doubled from 2005 to 2011.[273] During the same period, poverty dropped from 15.2% to 7.6%, unemployment rate dropped from 7.2% to 4.9%, market capitalisation of the Colombo Stock Exchange quadrupled, and the budget deficit doubled.[266] 99% of the households in Sri Lanka are electrified; 93.2% of the population have access to safe drinking water; and 53.1% have access to pipe-borne water.[267] Income inequality has also dropped in recent years, indicated by a Gini coefficient of 0.36 in 2010.[274]\n\n\nThe 2011 Global Competitiveness Report, published by the World Economic Forum, described Sri Lanka's economy as transitioning from the factor-driven stage to the efficiency-driven stage and that it ranked 52nd in global competitiveness.[275] Also, out of the 142 countries surveyed, Sri Lanka ranked 45th in health and primary education, 32nd in business sophistication, 42nd in innovation, and 41st in goods market efficiency. In 2016, Sri Lanka ranked 5th in the World Giving Index, registering high levels of contentment and charitable behaviour in its society.[276] In 2010, *The New York Times* placed Sri Lanka at the top of its list of 31 places to visit.[277] S&P Dow Jones Indices classifies Sri Lanka as a frontier market as of 2018.[278] Sri Lanka ranks well above other South Asian countries in the Human Development Index (HDI) with an index of 0.750.\n\n\nBy 2016, the country's debt soared as it was developing its infrastructure to the point of near bankruptcy which required a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).[279] The IMF had agreed to provide a US$1.5\u00a0billion bailout loan in April 2016 after Sri Lanka provided a set of criteria intended to improve its economy. By the fourth quarter of 2016, the debt was estimated to be $64.9\u00a0billion. Additional debt had been incurred in the past by state-owned organisations and this was said to be at least $9.5\u00a0billion. Since early 2015, domestic debt increased by 12% and external debt by 25%.[280] In November 2016, the IMF reported that the initial disbursement was larger than US$150\u00a0million originally planned, a full US$162.6\u00a0million (SDR 119.894\u00a0million). The agency's evaluation for the first tranche was cautiously optimistic about the future. Under the program, the Sri Lankan government implemented a new Inland Revenue Act and an automatic fuel pricing formula which was noted by the IMF in its fourth review. In 2018 China agreed to bail out Sri Lanka with a loan of $1.25\u00a0billion to deal with foreign debt repayment spikes in 2019 to 2021.[281][282][283]\n\n\nIn September 2021, Sri Lanka declared a major economic crisis.[284] The Chief of its Central Bank has stepped down amid the crisis.[285] The Parliament has declared emergency regulations due to the crisis, seeking to ban \"food hoarding\".[286][287]\n\n\nTourism, which provided the economy with an input of foreign currency, has significantly declined as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.[288]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Sri Lanka\n\nSri Lanka has an extensive road network for inland transportation. With more than 100,000\u00a0km (62,000\u00a0mi) of paved roads,[289] it has one of the highest road densities in the world (1.5\u00a0km or 0.93\u00a0mi of paved roads per every 1\u00a0km2 or 0.39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi of land). The road network consists of 35 A-Grade highways and four controlled-access highways.[290][291] A and B grade roads are national (arterial) highways administered by Road Development Authority.[292] C and D grade roads are provincial roads coming under the purview of the Provincial Road Development Authority of the respective province. The other roads are local roads falling under local government authorities.\n\n\nThe railway network, operated by the state-run National Railway operator Sri Lanka Railways, spans 1,447 kilometres (900\u00a0mi).[293] Sri Lanka also has three deep-water ports at Colombo, Galle, and Trincomalee, in addition to the newest port being built at Hambantota.\n\n\n\n### Transition to biological agriculture[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Sri Lanka imposed a nationwide ban on inorganic fertilisers and pesticides. The program was welcomed by its advisor Vandana Shiva,[294] but ignored critical voices from scientific and farming community who warned about possible collapse of farming,[295][296][297][298][299] including financial crisis due to devaluation of national currency pivoted around tea industry.[295] The situation in the tea industry was described as critical, with farming under the organic program being described as ten times more expensive and producing half of the yield by the farmers.[300] In September 2021 the government declared an economic emergency, as the situation was further aggravated by falling national currency exchange rate, inflation rising as a result of high food prices, and pandemic restrictions in tourism which further decreased country's income.[284]\n\n\nIn November 2021, Sri Lanka abandoned its plan to become the world's first organic farming nation following rising food prices and weeks of protests against the plan.[301] As of December 2021, the damage to agricultural production was already done, with prices having risen substantially for vegetables in Sri Lanka, and time needed to recover from the crisis. The ban on fertiliser has been lifted for certain crops, but the price of urea has risen internationally due to the price for oil and gas.[288] Jeevika Weerahewa, a senior lecturer at the University of Peradeniya, predicted that the ban would reduce the paddy harvest in 2022 by an unprecedented 50%.[302]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Sri Lanka\n\n![](image)Sri Lanka's population, (1871\u20132001)\nSri Lanka has roughly 22,156,000 people and an annual population growth rate of 0.5%. The birth rate is 13.8 births per 1,000\u00a0people, and the death rate is 6.0 deaths per 1,000\u00a0people.[267] Population density is highest in western Sri Lanka, especially in and around the capital. Sinhalese constitute the largest ethnic group in the country, with 74.8% of the total population.[303] Sri Lankan Tamils are the second major ethnic group in the island, with a percentage of 11.2%. Moors comprise 9.2%. There are also small ethnic groups such as the Burghers (of mixed European descent) and Malays from Southeast Asia. Moreover, there is a small population of Vedda people who are believed to be the original indigenous group to inhabit the island.[304]\n\n\n### Largest cities[edit]\n\n\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in Sri Lanka(2012 Department of Census and Statistics enumeration)[305]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank\n | Name | Province | Municipal pop.\n | Rank\n | Name | Province | Municipal pop.\n |\n| ![Colombo](image)Colombo![Kaduwela](image)Kaduwela | 1 | Colombo | Western | 561,314 | 11 | Galle | Southern | 86,333\n |\n| 2 | Kaduwela | Western | 252,041 | 12 | Batticaloa | Eastern | 86,227\n |\n| 3 | Maharagama | Western | 196,423 | 13 | Jaffna | Northern | 80,829\n |\n| 4 | Kesbewa | Western | 185,122 | 14 | Matara | Southern | 74,193\n |\n| 5 | Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia | Western | 184,468 | 15 | Gampaha | Western | 62,335\n |\n| 6 | Moratuwa | Western | 168,280 | 16 | Katunayake | Western | 60,915\n |\n| 7 | Negombo | Western | 142,449 | 17 | Boralesgamuwa | Western | 60,110\n |\n| 8 | Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte | Western | 107,925 | 18 | Kolonnawa | Western | 60,044\n |\n| 9 | Kalmunai | Eastern | 99,893 | 19 | Anuradhapura | North Central | 50,595\n |\n| 10 | Kandy | Central | 98,828 | 20 | Trincomalee | Eastern | 48,351\n |\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Sri Lanka\n\nSinhala and Tamil are the two official languages.[306] The constitution defines English as the link language. English is widely used for education, scientific and commercial purposes. Members of the Burgher community speak variant forms of Portuguese Creole and Dutch with varying proficiency, while members of the Malay community speak a form of Creole Malay that is unique to the island.[307]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Sri Lanka\n\nReligion in Sri Lanka (2012 census)[308][309]\n\n\n\nBuddhism (70.2%)\nHinduism (12.6%)\nIslam (9.7%)\nChristianity (7.4%)\nOthers (0.05%)\n\nBuddhism is the largest and is considered as an \"Official religion\" of Sri Lanka under Chapter II, Article 9, \"The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana\".[310][311]\nBuddhism is practised by 70.2% of the Sri Lankan population with most being predominantly from Theravada school of thought.[312] Most Buddhists are of the Sinhalese ethnic group with minority Tamils. Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka in the 2nd century BCE by Mahinda Maurya.[312] A sapling of the Bodhi Tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment was brought to Sri Lanka during the same time. The P\u0101li Canon (*Thripitakaya*), having previously been preserved as an oral tradition, was first committed to writing in Sri Lanka around 30 BCE.[313] Sri Lanka has the longest continuous history of Buddhism of any predominantly Buddhist nation.[312] During periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contact with Thailand and Burma.[313]\n\n\nAlthough Hindus in Sri Lanka form a religious minority, Hinduism has been present in Sri Lanka at least since the 2nd century BCE.[314] Hinduism was the dominant religion in Sri Lanka before the arrival of Buddhism in the 3rd century BCE. Buddhism was introduced into Sri Lanka by Mahinda, the son of Emperor Ashoka, during the reign of King Devanampiya Tissa;[315] the Sinhalese embraced Buddhism and Tamils remain Hindus in Sri Lanka. However, it was activity from across the Palk Strait that truly set the scene for Hinduism's survival in Sri Lanka. Shaivism (devotional worship of Lord Shiva) was the dominant branch practised by the Tamil peoples, thus most of the traditional Hindu temple architecture and philosophy of Sri Lanka drew heavily from this particular strand of Hinduism. Thirugnanasambanthar mentioned the names of several Sri Lankan Hindu temples in his works.[316]\n\n\nIslam is the third most prevalent religion in the country, having first been brought to the island by Arab traders over the course of many centuries, starting around the mid or late 7th century CE. Most followers on the island today are Sunni who follow the Shafi'i school[317] and are believed to be descendants of Arab traders and the local women whom they married.[318]\n\n\nChristianity reached the country at least as early as the fifth century (and possibly in the first),[319] gaining a wider foothold through Western colonists who began to arrive early in the 16th century.[320] Around 7.4% of the Sri Lankan population are Christians, of whom 82% are Roman Catholics who trace their religious heritage directly to the Portuguese. Tamil Catholics attribute their religious heritage to St. Francis Xavier as well as Portuguese missionaries. The remaining Christians are evenly split between the Anglican Church of Ceylon and other Protestant denominations.[321]\n\n\nThere is also a small population of Zoroastrian immigrants from India (Parsis) who settled in Ceylon during the period of British rule.[322] This community has steadily dwindled in recent years.[323]\n\n\nReligion plays a prominent role in the life and culture of Sri Lankans. The Buddhist majority observe Poya Days each month according to the Lunar calendar, and Hindus and Muslims also observe their own holidays. In a 2008 Gallup poll, Sri Lanka was ranked the third most religious country in the world, with 99% of Sri Lankans saying religion was an important part of their daily life.[324]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Development of life expectancy\nMain article: Health in Sri Lanka\n\nSri Lankans have a life expectancy of 75.5 years at birth, which is 10% higher than the world average.[267][266] The infant mortality rate stands at 8.5 per 1,000 births and the maternal mortality rate at 0.39 per 1,000 births, which is on par with figures from developed countries. The universal \"pro-poor\"[325] health care system adopted by the country has contributed much towards these figures.[326] Sri Lanka ranks first among southeast Asian countries with respect to deaths by suicide, with 33 deaths per 100,000 persons. According to the Department of Census and Statistics, poverty, destructive pastimes, and inability to cope with stressful situations are the main causes behind the high suicide rates.[327]\nOn 8 July 2020, the World Health Organization declared that Sri Lanka had successfully eliminated rubella and measles ahead of their 2023 target.[328]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Sri Lanka\n\n![](image)The Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology is a research institute specialising in the field of nanotechnology.\nWith a literacy rate of 92.9%,[267] Sri Lanka has one of the most literate populations amongst developing nations.[329] Its youth literacy rate stands at 98.8%,[330] computer literacy rate at 35%,[331] and primary school enrollment rate at over 99%.[332] An education system which dictates 9 years of compulsory schooling for every child is in place.\n\n\nThe free education system established in 1945[333] is a result of the initiative of C. W. W. Kannangara and A. Ratnayake.[334][335] It is one of the few countries in the world that provide universal free education from primary to tertiary stage.[336] Kannangara led the establishment of the Madhya Vidyalayas (central schools) in different parts of the country in order to provide education to Sri Lanka's rural children.[331] In 1942, a special education committee proposed extensive reforms to establish an efficient and quality education system for the people. However, in the 1980s changes to this system separated the administration of schools between the central government and the provincial government. Thus the elite national schools are controlled directly by the ministry of education and the provincial schools by the provincial government. Sri Lanka has approximately 10,155 government schools, 120 private schools and 802 pirivenas.[267]\n\n\nSri Lanka has 17 public universities.[337][338] A lack of responsiveness of the education system to labour market requirements, disparities in access to quality education, lack of an effective linkage between secondary and tertiary education remain major challenges for the education sector.[339] A number of private, degree awarding institutions have emerged in recent times to fill in these gaps, yet the participation at tertiary level education remains at 5.1%.[340] Sri Lanka was ranked 90th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[341][342]\n\n\nScience fiction author Arthur C. Clarke served as chancellor of Moratuwa University from 1979 to 2002.[343]\n\n\n\n## Human rights and media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Human rights in Sri Lanka and Media in Sri Lanka\n\nThe Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (formerly Radio Ceylon) is the oldest-running radio station in Asia,[344] established in 1923 by Edward Harper just three years after broadcasting began in Europe.[344] The station broadcasts services in Sinhala, Tamil, English and Hindi. Since the 1980s, many private radio stations have also been introduced. Broadcast television was introduced in 1979 when the Independent Television Network was launched. Initially, all television stations were state-controlled, but private television networks began broadcasting in 1992.[345]\n\n\nAs of 2020[update], 192 newspapers (122 Sinhala, 24 Tamil, 43 English, 3 multilingual) are published and 25 TV stations and 58 radio stations are in operation.[267] In recent years, freedom of the press in Sri Lanka has been alleged by media freedom groups to be amongst the poorest in democratic countries.[346] Alleged abuse of a newspaper editor by a senior government minister[347] achieved international notoriety because of the unsolved murder of the editor's predecessor, Lasantha Wickrematunge,[348] who had been a critic of the government and had presaged his own death in a posthumously published article.[349]\n\n\nOfficially, the constitution of Sri Lanka guarantees human rights as ratified by the United Nations. However, several groups, such as Amnesty International, Freedom from Torture, Human Rights Watch,[350] as well as the British government[351] and the United States Department of State have criticised human rights violations in Sri Lanka.[352] The Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE have both been accused of violating human rights. A report by an advisory panel to the UN secretary-general accused both the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government of war crimes during final stages of the civil war.[353][354] Corruption remains a problem in Sri Lanka, and there is little protection for those who stand up against corruption.[355] The 135-year-old Article 365 of the Sri Lankan Penal Code criminalises gay sex, with a penalty of up to ten years in prison.[356]\n\n\nThe UN Human Rights Council has documented over 12,000 named individuals who have disappeared after detention by security forces in Sri Lanka, the second-highest figure in the world since the Working Group came into being in 1980.[357] The Sri Lankan government confirmed that 6,445 of these died. Allegations of human rights abuses have not ended with the close of the ethnic conflict.[358]\n\n\nUN Human Rights Commissioner Navanethem Pillay visited Sri Lanka in May 2013. After her visit, she said: \"The war may have ended [in Sri Lanka], but in the meantime, democracy has been undermined and the rule of law eroded.\" Pillay spoke about the military's increasing involvement in civilian life and reports of military land grabbing. She also said that, while in Sri Lanka, she had been allowed to go wherever she wanted, but that Sri Lankans who came to meet her were harassed and intimidated by security forces.[359][360]\n\n\nIn 2012, the UK charity Freedom from Torture reported that it had received 233 referrals of torture survivors from Sri Lanka for clinical treatment or other services provided by the charity. In the same year, the group published *Out of the Silence*, which documents evidence of torture in Sri Lanka and demonstrates that the practice has continued long after the end of the civil war in 2009.[361] On 29 July 2020, Human Rights Watch said that the Sri Lanka government has targeted lawyers, human rights defenders, and journalists to suppress criticism against the government.[362]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hindu devotees engaging in *Kavadi* at a temple in Vavuniya\nThe culture of Sri Lanka is influenced primarily by Buddhism and Hinduism.[363] Sri Lanka is the home to two main traditional cultures: the Sinhalese (centred in Kandy and Anuradhapura) and the Tamil (centred in Jaffna). Tamils co-existed with the Sinhalese people since then, and the early mixing rendered the two ethnic groups almost physically indistinguishable.[364] Ancient Sri Lanka is marked for its genius in hydraulic engineering and architecture. The British colonial culture has also influenced the locals. The rich cultural traditions shared by all Sri Lankan cultures is the basis of the country's long life expectancy, advanced health standards and high literacy rate.[365]\n\n\n\n### Food and festivals[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Sri Lankan cuisine and Festivals in Sri Lanka\n\n![](image)Sri Lankan rice and curry\nDishes include rice and curry, pittu, kiribath, wholemeal roti, string hoppers, wattalapam (a rich pudding of Malay origin made with coconut milk, jaggery, cashews, eggs, and spices including cinnamon and nutmeg), kottu, and appam.[366] Jackfruit may sometimes replace rice. Traditionally food is served on a plantain leaf or lotus leaf. Middle Eastern influences and practices are found in traditional Moor dishes, while Dutch and Portuguese influences are found with the island's Burgher community preserving their culture through traditional dishes such as lamprais (rice cooked in stock and baked in a banana leaf), breudher (Dutch holiday biscuit), and Bolo fiado (Portuguese-style layer cake).\n\n\nIn April, Sri Lankans celebrate the Buddhist and Hindu new year festivals.[367] Esala Perahera is a symbolic Buddhist festival consisting of dances and decorated elephants held in Kandy in July and August.[368] Fire dances, whip dances, Kandyan dances and various other cultural dances are integral parts of the festival. Christians celebrate Christmas on 25 December to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ and Easter to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus. Tamils celebrate Thai Pongal and Maha Shivaratri, and Muslims celebrate Hajj and Ramadan.\n\n\n\n### Visual, literary and performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cinema of Sri Lanka, Music of Sri Lanka, Dances of Sri Lanka, Theatre of Sri Lanka, and Sri Lankan literature\n\n![](image)Female dancers in traditional Kandyan dress\n![](image)The Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre was constructed as a major venue for the performing arts\nThe movie *Kadawunu Poronduwa* (*The Broken Promise*), produced by S. M. Nayagam of Chitra Kala Movietone, heralded the coming of Sri Lankan cinema in 1947. *Ranmuthu Duwa* (*Island of Treasures*) marked the transition of cinema from black-and-white to colour. In recent years, movies have featured subjects such as family melodrama, social transformation and the years of conflict between the military and the LTTE.[369] The Sri Lankan cinematic style is similar to Bollywood movies. In 1979, movie attendance rose to an all-time high but has been in a steady decline since then.[370]\n\n\nAn influential filmmaker is Lester James Peiris, who has directed a number of movies which led to global acclaim, including *Rekava* (*Line of Destiny*, 1956), *Gamperaliya* (*The Changing Village*, 1964), *Nidhanaya* (*The Treasure*, 1970) and *Golu Hadawatha* (*Cold Heart*, 1968).[371] Sri Lankan-Canadian poet Rienzi Crusz, is the subject of a documentary on his life in Sri Lanka. His work is published in Sinhala and English. Naturalised Canadian Michael Ondaatje is well known for his English-language novels and three films.\n\n\nThe earliest music in Sri Lanka came from theatrical performances such as *Kolam*, *Sokari* and *Nadagam*.[372] Traditional music instruments such as *B\u00e9ra*, *Thamm\u00e1tama*, *Da\u016dla* and *R\u0103b\u0101n* were performed at these dramas. The first music album, *Nurthi*, recorded in 1903, was released through Radio Ceylon. Songwriters like Mahagama Sekara and Ananda Samarakoon and musicians such as W. D. Amaradeva, Victor Ratnayake, Nanda Malini and Clarence Wijewardene have contributed much towards the progression of Sri Lankan music.[373] Baila originated among Kaffirs or the Afro-Sinhalese community.[374]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Low Country drummer playing the traditional *Yak B\u00e9ra*\nThere are three main styles of Sri Lankan classical dance. They are, the Kandyan dances, low country dances and Sabaragamuwa dances. Of these, the Kandyan style is most prominent. It is a sophisticated form of dance[375] that consists of five sub-categories: *Ves dance*, *Naiyandi dance*, *Udekki dance*, *Pantheru dance* and *18 Vannam*.[376] An elaborate headdress is worn by the male dancers, and a drum called *Geta B\u00e9raya* is used to assist the dancers to keep on rhythm.[377]\n\n\nThe history of Sri Lankan painting and sculpture can be traced as far back as to the 2nd or 3rd century BCE.[378] The earliest mention about the art of painting on Mah\u0101va\u1e43sa, is to the drawing of a palace on cloth using cinnabar in the 2nd century BCE. The chronicles have a description of various paintings in relic chambers of Buddhist stupas and in monastic residences.\n\n\nTheatre came to the country when a Parsi theatre company from Mumbai introduced *Nurti*, a blend of European and Indian theatrical conventions to the Colombo audience in the 19th century.[376] The golden age of Sri Lankan drama and theatre began with the staging of *Maname*, a play written by Ediriweera Sarachchandra in 1956.[379] It was followed by a series of popular dramas like *Sinhab\u0101hu*, *Pab\u0101vat\u012b*, *Mah\u0101s\u0101ra*, *Muudu Puththu* and *Subha saha Yasa*.\n\n\nSri Lankan literature spans at least two millennia and is heir to the Aryan literary tradition as embodied in the hymns of the Rigveda.[380] The P\u0101li Canon, the standard collection of scriptures in the Theravada Buddhist tradition, was written down in Sri Lanka during the Fourth Buddhist council, at the Alulena cave temple, Kegalle, as early as 29 BCE.[381] Chronicles such as the *Mah\u0101va\u1e43sa*, written in the 6th century, provide vivid descriptions of Sri Lankan dynasties. According to the German philosopher Wilhelm Geiger, the chronicles are based on Sinhala Atthakatha (commentary).[380] The oldest surviving prose work is the *Dhampiya-Atuva-Getapadaya*, compiled in the 9th century CE.[380] The greatest literary feats of medieval Sri Lanka include *Sandesha K\u0101vya* (poetic messages) such as *Gir\u0101 Sandeshaya* (parrot message), *Hansa Sandeshaya* (swan message) and *Salalihini Sandeshaya* (myna message). Poetry including *Kavsilumina*, *Kavya-Sekharaya* (*Diadem of Poetry*) and proses such as *Saddharma-Ratn\u0101valiya*, *Am\u0101vatura* (*Flood of Nectar*) and *Puj\u0101valiya* are also notable works of this period, which is considered to be the golden age of Sri Lankan literature.[380] The first modern-day novel, *Meena* by Simon de Silva appeared in 1905[376] and was followed by several revolutionary literary works. Martin Wickramasinghe, the author of *Madol Doova* is considered the iconic figure of Sri Lankan literature.[382]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Sri Lanka\n\n![](image)R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.\nWhile the national sport is volleyball, by far the most popular sport in the country is Cricket.[383] Rugby union also enjoys extensive popularity,[384] as do association football, netball and tennis. Aquatic sports such as boating, surfing, swimming, kitesurfing[385] and scuba diving attract many Sri Lankans and foreign tourists. There are two styles of martial arts native to Sri Lanka: Cheena di and Angampora.[386]\n\n\n\n![Muttiah Muralitharan](image)Muttiah Muralitharan has taken the highest number of wickets in Test cricket.[387]\nThe Sri Lanka national cricket team achieved considerable success beginning in the 1990s, rising from underdog status to winning the 1996 Cricket World Cup, defeating Australia in the final on 17 March 1996.[388] They also won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 played in Bangladesh, beating India in the final. In addition, Sri Lanka became the runners-up of the Cricket World Cup in 2007[389] and 2011,[390] and of the ICC World Twenty20 in 2009 and 2012.[391] Former Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan has been rated as the greatest test match bowler ever by *Wisden Cricketers' Almanack*,[392] and four Sri Lankan cricketers ranked 2nd (Sangakkara), 4th (Jayasuriya), 5th (Jayawardene) and 11th (Dilshan) highest ODI run scorers of all time, which is the second best by a team. As of June 2022, Muttiah Muralitharan has the highest aggregate wickets in Test Cricket with a record 800 wickets, a feat he achieved in a Test Match against India in July 2010 that Sri Lanka had won by 10 Wickets.[393][394] Sri Lanka has won the Asia Cup in 1986,[395] 1997,[396] 2004,[397] 2008,[398] 2014.[399] and 2022.[400] Sri Lanka once held the highest team score in all three formats of cricket.[401] The country co-hosted the Cricket World Cup in 1996 and 2011 and hosted the 2012 ICC World Twenty20.\n\n\nSri Lankans have won two medals at Olympic Games: one silver, by Duncan White at the 1948 London Olympics for men's 400 metres hurdles;[402] and one silver by Susanthika Jayasinghe at the 2000 Sydney Olympics for women's 200 metres.[403] In 1973, Muhammad Lafir won the World Billiards Championship, the highest feat by a Sri Lankan in a Cue sport.[404] Sri Lanka has also won the Carrom World Championship titles twice in 2012, 2016[405] and 2018, the men's team becoming champions and the women's team winning second place. The Sri Lankan National Badminton Championships was annually held between 1953 and 2011.\n\n\nSri Lanka national football team also won the prestigious 1995 South Asian Gold Cup.[406][407][408][409][410]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Sri Lanka portal\n\n\n* Outline of Sri Lanka\n* List of cities in Sri Lanka\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte\". *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica*.

By diverting the attention of policymakers towards pointless nonscientific arguments instead of promoting such integrated management systems and high technological fertilizer production, will be only a time-wasting effort and meanwhile, the global demand for Ceylon Tea will generate diminishing returns. At present, there are about 500,000 direct beneficiaries from the tea industry and about 600 factories are operating around the country. In general, the livelihood of around 3 million people is directly and indirectly woven around the domestic tea industry. The researchers and the experienced growers have predicted that a 50 percent reduction in the yield has to be anticipated with the ban of chemical fertilizer. The negative implication of this yield reduction is such that there is a risk of collapsing the banking sector which is centralized around the tea industry in the major tea growing areas including Ratnapura, Galle, Matara, Kaluthara, and Kegalle.\n296. **^** \"Opinion | Inorganic Fertilizer and Agrochemicals Ban in Sri Lanka and Fallacies of Organic Agriculture\". *Agrigate Global*.

It shares borders with Eritrea to the north, Djibouti to the northeast, Somalia to the east and southeast, Kenya to the south, South Sudan to the west, and Sudan to the northwest.[b][15] Ethiopia covers a land area of 1,112,000 square kilometres (472,000 sq. miles).[16] As of 2023[update], it is home to around 126.5 million inhabitants, making it the 13th-most populous country in the world, the 2nd-most populous in Africa after Nigeria, and the most populated landlocked country on Earth.[17][18] The national capital and largest city, Addis Ababa, lies several kilometres west of the East African Rift that splits the country into the African and Somali tectonic plates.[19]\n\n\nAnatomically modern humans emerged from modern-day Ethiopia and set out for the Near East and elsewhere in the Middle Paleolithic period.[20][21][22][23][24] Southwestern Ethiopia has been proposed as a possible homeland of the Afroasiatic language family.[25] Ethiopia is Africa's oldest independent country and one of the oldest in the world.[26][27] In 980 BC, the Kingdom of D'mt extended its realm over Eritrea and the northern region of Ethiopia, while the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region for 900 years. Christianity was embraced by the kingdom in 330,[28] and Islam arrived by the first Hijra in 615.[29] After the collapse of Aksum in 960, a variety of kingdoms, largely tribal confederations, existed in the land of Ethiopia. The Zagwe dynasty ruled the north-central parts until being overthrown by Yekuno Amlak in 1270, inaugurating the Ethiopian Empire and the Solomonic dynasty, claimed descent from the biblical Solomon and Queen of Sheba under their son Menelik I. By the 14th century, the empire had grown in prestige through territorial expansion and fighting against adjacent territories; most notably, the Ethiopian\u2013Adal War (1529\u20131543) contributed to fragmentation of the empire, which ultimately fell under a decentralization known as *Zemene Mesafint* in the mid-18th century. Emperor Tewodros II ended *Zemene Mesafint* at the beginning of his reign in 1855, marking the reunification and modernization of Ethiopia.[30]\n\n\nFrom 1878 onwards, Emperor Menelik II launched a series of conquests known as Menelik's Expansions, which resulted in the formation of Ethiopia's current border. Externally, during the late 19th century, Ethiopia defended itself against foreign invasions, including from Egypt and Italy; as a result, Ethiopia and Liberia preserved their sovereignty during the Scramble for Africa. In 1935, Ethiopia was occupied by Fascist Italy and annexed with Italian-possessed Eritrea and Somaliland, later forming Italian East Africa. In 1941, during World War II, it was occupied by the British Army, and its full sovereignty was restored in 1944 after a period of military administration. The Derg, a Soviet-backed military junta, took power in 1974 after deposing Emperor Haile Selassie and the Solomonic dynasty, and ruled the country for nearly 17 years amidst the Ethiopian Civil War. Following the dissolution of the Derg in 1991, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) dominated the country with a new constitution and ethnic-based federalism. Since then, Ethiopia has suffered from prolonged and unsolved inter-ethnic clashes and political instability marked by democratic backsliding. From 2018, regional and ethnically based factions carried out armed attacks in multiple ongoing wars throughout Ethiopia.[31]\n\n\nEthiopia is a multi-ethnic state with over 80 different ethnic groups. Christianity is the most widely professed faith in the country, with significant minorities of the adherents of Islam and a small percentage to traditional faiths. This sovereign state is a founding member of the UN, the Group of 24, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of 77, and the Organisation of African Unity. Addis Ababa is the headquarters of the African Union, the Pan African Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the African Standby Force and many of the global non-governmental organizations focused on Africa. Ethiopia has been invited to join BRICS and will become a full member starting January 1, 2024.[32] Ethiopia is one of the least developed countries but is sometimes considered an emerging power,[33][34] having the fastest economic growth in Sub-Saharan African countries because of foreign direct investment in expansion of agricultural and manufacturing industries;[35] agriculture is the country's largest economic sector, accounting for 36% of the gross domestic product as of 2020.[36] However, in terms of per capita income and the Human Development Index,[37] the country is regarded as poor, with high rates of poverty,[38] poor respect for human rights, widespread ethnic discrimination, and a literacy rate of only 49%.[39]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Aethiopia\n\nThe Greek name \u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c0\u03af\u03b1 (from \u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03af\u03bf\u03c8, *Aithiops*, \"an Ethiopian\") is a compound word, later explained as derived from the Greek words \u03b1\u1f34\u03b8\u03c9 and \u1f64\u03c8 (*aith\u014d* \"I burn\" + *\u014dps* \"face\"). According to the Liddell-Scott Jones Greek-English Lexicon, the designation properly translates as *burnt-face* in noun form and *red-brown* in adjectival form.[40] The historian Herodotus used the appellation to denote those parts of Africa south of the Sahara that were then known within the Ecumene (habitable world).[41] The earliest mention of the term is found in the works of Homer, where it is used to refer to two people groups, one in Africa and one in the east from eastern Turkey to India.[42] This Greek name was borrowed into Amharic as \u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb, *\u02be\u012aty\u014d\u1e57\u1e57y\u0101*. More likely \u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c0\u03af\u03b1 was derived from a native word *\u12d5\u1323\u1295* (\u02bf\u0259\u1e6dan, incense), of which Ethiopia was an important source.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn Greco-Roman epigraphs, *Aethiopia* was a specific toponym for ancient Nubia.[43] At least as early as c.\u2009850,[44] the name *Aethiopia* also occurs in many translations of the Old Testament in allusion to Nubia. The ancient Hebrew texts identify Nubia instead as Kush.[45] However, in the New Testament, the Greek term Aithiops does occur, referring to a servant of the Kandake, the queen of Kush.[46]\n\n\nFollowing the Hellenic and biblical traditions, the Monumentum Adulitanum, a 3rd-century inscription belonging to the Aksumite Empire, indicates that Aksum's ruler governed an area that was flanked to the west by the territory of Ethiopia and Sasu. The Aksumite King Ezana eventually conquered Nubia the following century, and the Aksumites thereafter appropriated the designation \"Ethiopians\" for their own kingdom. In the Ge'ez version of the Ezana inscription, A\u1f30\u03b8\u03af\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03c2 is equated with the unvocalized *\u1e24b\u0161t* and *\u1e24b\u015bt* (\u1e24abashat), and denotes for the first time the highland inhabitants of Aksum. This new demonym was subsequently rendered as *\u1e25bs* ('A\u1e25b\u0101sh) in Sabaic and as *\u1e24abasha* in Arabic.[43]\n\n\nIn the 15th-century Ge'ez *Book of Axum*, the name is ascribed to a legendary individual called *Ityopp'is*. He was an extra-biblical son of Cush, son of Ham, said to have founded the city of Axum.[47]\n\n\nIn English, and generally outside of Ethiopia, the country was historically known as Abyssinia. This toponym was derived from the Latinized form of the ancient *Habash*.[48]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Ethiopia\n\nFurther information: Ethiopian historiography\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prehistoric Ethiopia\n\n![](image)A *Homo sapiens idaltu* hominid skull\nSeveral important finds have propelled Ethiopia and the surrounding region to the forefront of\u00a0palaeontology. The oldest hominid discovered to date in Ethiopia is the 4.2\u00a0million-year-old *Ardipithecus ramidus* (Ardi) found by Tim D. White in 1994.[49] The most well-known hominid discovery is *Australopithecus afarensis* (Lucy). Known locally as *Dinkinesh*, the specimen was found in the Awash Valley of Afar Region in 1974 by Donald Johanson, and is one of the most complete and best-preserved adult Australopithecine fossils ever uncovered. Lucy's taxonomic name refers to the region where the discovery was made. This hominid is estimated to have lived 3.2\u00a0million years ago.[50][51][52]\n\n\nEthiopia is also considered one of the earliest sites of the emergence of anatomically modern humans, *Homo sapiens*. The oldest of these local fossil finds, the Omo remains, were excavated in the southwestern Omo Kibish area and have been dated to the Middle Paleolithic, around 200,000 years ago.[53] Additionally, skeletons of *Homo sapiens idaltu* were found at a site in the Middle Awash valley. Dated to approximately 160,000 years ago, they may represent an extinct subspecies of *Homo sapiens*, or the immediate ancestors of anatomically modern humans.[54] Archaic *Homo sapiens* fossils excavated at the Jebel Irhoud site in Morocco have since been dated to an earlier period, about 300,000 years ago,[55] while Omo-Kibish I (Omo I) from southern Ethiopia is the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeleton currently known (196 \u00b1 5 ka).[56]\n\n\nAccording to some linguists, the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations arrived in the region during the ensuing Neolithic era from the family's proposed urheimat (\"original homeland\") in the Nile Valley,[57] or the Near East.[58] The majority of scholars today propose that the Afroasiatic family developed in northeast Africa because of the higher diversity of lineages in that region, a telltale sign of linguistic origin.[59][60][61]\n\n\nIn 2019, archaeologists discovered a 30,000-year-old Middle Stone Age rock shelter at the Fincha Habera site in Bale Mountains at an elevation of 3,469 metres (11,381 feet) above sea level. At this high altitude, humans are susceptible both to hypoxia and to extreme weather. According to a study published in the journal *Science*, this dwelling is proof of the earliest permanent human occupation at high altitude yet discovered. Thousands of animal bones, hundreds of stone tools, and ancient fireplaces were discovered, revealing a diet that featured giant mole rats.[62][63][64][65][66][67][68]\n\n\nEvidence of some of the earliest known stone-tipped projectile weapons (a characteristic tool of *Homo sapiens*), the stone tips of javelins or throwing spears, were discovered in 2013 at the Ethiopian site of Gademotta, which date to around 279,000 years ago.[69] In 2019, additional Middle Stone Age projectile weapons were found at Aduma, dated 100,000\u201380,000 years ago, in the form of points considered likely to belong to darts delivered by spear throwers.[70]\n\n\n\n### Antiquity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: D\u02bfmt and Kingdom of Aksum\n\n![](image)Aksumite currency of the Aksumite king called Endubis, 227\u201335, at the British Museum.[c]\nIn 980 BC, D\u02bfmt was established in present-day Eritrea and the Tigray Region of Ethiopia and is widely believed to be the successor state to Punt. This polity's capital was located at Yeha in what is now northern Ethiopia. Most modern historians consider this civilization to be a native Ethiopian one, although in earlier times many suggested it was Sabaean-influenced because of the latter's hegemony of the Red Sea.[71]\n\n\nOther scholars regard D\u02bfmt as the result of a union of Afroasiatic-speaking cultures of the Cushitic and Semitic branches; namely, local Agaw peoples and Sabaeans from Southern Arabia. However, Ge'ez, the ancient Semitic language of Ethiopia, is thought to have developed independently from the Sabaean language. As early as 2000 BC, other Semitic speakers were living in Ethiopia and Eritrea where Ge'ez developed.[72][73] Sabaean influence is now thought to have been minor, limited to a few localities, and disappearing after a few decades or a century. It may have been a trading or military colony in alliance with the Ethiopian civilization of D\u02bfmt or some other proto-Axumite state.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Empire of Axum at its peak in the 6th century.\nAfter the fall of D\u02bfmt during the 4th century BC, the Ethiopian plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms. In the 1st century AD, the Kingdom of Aksum emerged in what is now Tigray Region and Eritrea. According to the medieval *Book of Axum*, the kingdom's first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush.[47] Aksum would later at times extend its rule into Yemen on the other side of the Red Sea.[74] The Persian prophet Mani listed Axum with Rome, Persia, and China as one of the four great powers of his era, during the 3rd century.[75] It is also believed that there was a connection between Egyptian and Ethiopian churches. There is diminutive evidence that the Aksumites were associated with the Queen of Sheba, via their royal inscription.[76]\n\n\nAround 316 AD, Frumentius and his brother Edesius from Tyre accompanied their uncle on a voyage to Ethiopia. When the vessel stopped at a Red Sea port, the natives killed all the travellers except the two brothers, who were taken to the court as slaves. They were given positions of trust by the monarch, and they converted members of the royal court to Christianity. Frumentius became the first bishop of Aksum.[77] A coin dated to 324 shows that Ethiopia was the second country to officially adopt Christianity (after Armenia did so in 301), although the religion may have been at first confined to court circles; it was the first major power to do so. The Aksumites were accustomed to the Greco-Roman sphere of influence, but embarked on significant cultural ties and trade connections between the Indian subcontinent and the Roman Empire via the Silk Road, primarily exporting ivory, tortoise shell, gold and emeralds, and importing silk and spices.[76][78]\n\n\n\n### Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethiopia in the Middle Ages\n\nThe kingdom adopted the name \"Ethiopia\" during the reign of Ezana in the 4th century. After the conquest of Kingdom of Kush in 330, the Aksumite territory reached its peak between the 5th and 6th centuries.[71] This period was interrupted by several incursions into the South Arabian protectorate, including Jewish Dhu Nuwas of the Himyarite Kingdom and the Aksumite\u2013Persian wars. In 575, the Aksumites besieged and retook Sana'a following the assassination of its governor Sayf ibn Dh\u012b Yazan. The port city of Adulis was plundered by Arab Muslims in the 8th century; along with irrevocable land degradation, claimed climate change and sporadic rainfall precipitation from 730 to 760,[79] the kingdom likely said to decline its power and important trade route, and Red Sea was left to the Rashidun Caliphate in 646.[71][80] Aksum came to an end in 960 when Queen Gudit defeated the last king of Aksum.[81] In response, the remnant of the Aksumite population to shift into the southern region and establish the Zagwe dynasty, changing its capital to Lalibela.[82] Zagwe's rule ended when an Amhara noble man Yekuno Amlak revolted against King Yetbarak and established the Ethiopian Empire (known by exonym \"Abyssinia\").\n\n\n\n![](image)The Ethiopian Empire under Emperor Amda Seyon I\nThe Ethiopian Empire initiated territorial expansion under the leadership of Amda Seyon I. He launched campaigns against his Muslim adversaries to the east, resulting in a significant shift in the balance of power in favor of the Christians for the next two centuries. After Amda Seyon's successful eastern campaigns, most of the Muslim principalities in the Horn of Africa came under the suzerainty of the Ethiopian Empire. Among these Muslim entities was the Sultanate of Ifat. During the reign of Emperor Zara Yaqob, the Ethiopian Empire reached its pinnacle. His rule was marked by the consolidation of territorial acquisitions from earlier rulers, the oversight of the construction of numerous churches and monasteries, the active promotion of literature and art, and the strengthening of central imperial authority.[83][84][85] Ifat's successor, the Adal Sultanate,[86] tried to conquer Ethiopia during the Ethiopian\u2013Adal War, but was ultimately defeated at the 1543 Battle of Wayna Daga.[87]\n\n\nBy the 16th century, an influx of migration by ethnic Oromo into northern parts of the region fragmented the empire's power. Embarking from present-day Guji and Borena Zone, the Oromos were largely motivated by several folkloric conceptions\u2014beginning with *Moggaasaa*[88] and *Liqimssa*\u2014many of whom related to their raids. This persisted until *gada* of Mesl\u00e9.[89][90] According to Abba Bahrey, the earliest expansion occurred under Emperor Dawit II (*luba* Melbah), when they encroached to Bale before invading Adal Sultanate.[91]\n\n\nEthiopia saw major diplomatic contact with Portugal from the 17th century, mainly related to religion. Beginning in 1555,[92] Portuguese Jesuits attempted to develop Roman Catholicism as the state religion. After several failures, they sent several missionaries in 1603, including the most influential, Spanish Jesuit Pedro Paez.[93] Under Emperor Susenyos I, Roman Catholicism became the state religion of the Ethiopian Empire in 1622.[94] This decision caused an uprising by the Orthodox populace.[95]\n\n\n\n### Early modern period (1632\u20131855)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Gondarine period and Zemene Mesafint\n\n![](image)Fasil Ghebbi one of the most important castles of the Gondarine period.\nIn 1632, Emperor Fasilides successfully halted Roman Catholic state administration and restored Orthodox Tewahedo as the state religion.[94] Fasilides' reign sparked solidification of imperial power and moved the capital to Gondar in 1636, commencing a period of transition known as \"Gondarine period\".[96] He expelled Jesuits by reclaiming possessed lands and relegating them to Fremona. During his reign, he built one of the most iconic royal fortress, Fasil Ghebbi, forty-four churches were built[97] and Ethiopian art was revived. He also credited with constructing seven stone bridges over Blue Nile River.[98]\n\n\nGondar's power and reputation decayed following the death of Iyasu I in 1706 because most emperors preferred to enjoy luxurious life rather than spending in politics. After Iyasu II death in 1755, Empress Mentewab brought her brother, Ras Wolde Leul, to Gondar and made him Ras Bitwaded, resulted in regnal conflict between Mentewab's *Quaregnoch* and Wollo group led by Wubit. In 1767, Ras Mikael Sehul, a regent in Tigray Province, seized Gondar and murdered the child Iyoas I in 1769, who was emperor at the time, and installed 70-year-old Yohannes II.[99]\n\n\nBetween 1769 and 1855, Ethiopia experienced a period of isolation referred to as the Zemene Mesafint or \"Age of Princes\". The emperors became figureheads, controlled by regional lords and noblemen like *Ras* Mikael Sehul, Ras Wolde Selassie of Tigray, and by the Yejju Oromo dynasty of the Wara Sheh, such as Ras Gugsa of Yejju. Prior to the Zemene Mesafint, Emperor Iyoas I had introduced the Oromo language (*Afaan Oromo*) at court, instead of Amharic.[100][101]\n\n\n\n### Age of Imperialism (1855\u20131916)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: British expedition to Abyssinia, Menelik's Invasions, Egyptian\u2013Ethiopian War, First Italo-Ethiopian War, and Mahdist War\n\n![](image)Emperor Tewodros II (r.\u20091855\u20131868) brought an end of *Zemene Mesafint*Ethiopian isolationism ended following a British mission that concluded with an alliance between the two nations, but it was not until 1855 that the Amhara kingdoms of northern Ethiopia (Gondar, Gojjam, and Shewa) were briefly united after the power of the emperor was restored beginning with the reign of Tewodros II.[102][103] Tewodros II began a process of consolidation, centralisation, and state-building that would be continued by succeeding emperors. This process reduced the power of regional rulers, restructured the empire's administration, and created a professional army. These changes created the basis for establishing the effective sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Ethiopian state.[104] In 1875 and 1876, Ottoman and Egyptian forces, accompanied by many European and American advisors, twice invaded Abyssinia but were initially defeated.[105] From 1885 to 1889 (under Yohannes IV), Ethiopia joined the Mahdist War allied to Britain, Turkey, and Egypt against the Sudanese Mahdist State. In 1887, Menelik II, king of Shewa, invaded the Emirate of Harar after his victory at the Battle of Chelenqo.[106] On 10 March 1889, Yohannes IV was killed by the Sudanese Khalifah Abdullah's army whilst leading his army in the Battle of Gallabat.[107]\n\n\nEthiopia, in roughly its current form, began under the reign of Menelik II, who was Emperor from 1889 until his death in 1913. From his base in the central province of Shewa, Menelik set out to annex territories to the south, east, and west[108] \u2014 areas inhabited by the Oromo, Sidama, Gurage, Welayta, and other peoples.[109] He achieved this with the help of *Ras* Gobana Dacche's Shewan Oromo militia, which occupied lands that had not been held since Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi's war, as well as other areas that had never been under Ethiopian rule.[110]\n\n\nFor his leadership, despite opposition from more traditional elements of society, Menelik II was heralded as a national hero. He had signed the Treaty of Wuchale with Italy in May 1889, by which Italy would recognize Ethiopia's sovereignty so long as Italy could control an area north of Ethiopia (now part of modern Eritrea). In return, Italy was to provide Menelik with weapons and support him as emperor. The Italians used the time between the signing of the treaty and its ratification by the Italian government to expand their territorial claims. This First Italo\u2013Ethiopian War culminated in the Battle of Adwa on 1 March 1896, in which Italy's colonial forces were defeated by the Ethiopians.[109][111] During this time, about a third of the population died in the Great Ethiopian Famine (1888 to 1892).[112][113]\n\n\n\n### Haile Selassie I era (1916\u20131974)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Italian Ethiopia, Italian East Africa, Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea, and Eritrean War of Independence\n\n![](image)Ethiopian troops sent by the government under the Emperor Haile Selassie I during the Korean War fighting for South Korean independence\n![](image)Emperor Haile Selassie I with U.S President Roosevelt after War World II\nThe early 20th century was marked by the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie *(Ras Tafari)*. He came to power after Lij Iyasu was deposed, and undertook a nationwide modernization campaign from 1916 when he was made a *Ras* and Regent (*Inderase*) for the Empress Regnant Zewditu, and became the *de facto* ruler of the Ethiopian Empire. Following Zewditu's death, on 2 November 1930, he succeeded her as emperor.[114] In 1931, Haile Selassie endowed Ethiopia with its first-ever Constitution in emulation of Imperial Japan's 1890 Constitution.[115]\nThe independence of Ethiopia was interrupted by the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, beginning when it was invaded by Fascist Italy in early October 1935, and by subsequent Italian rule of the country (1936\u20131941) after Italian victory in the war.[116] Following the entry of Italy into World War II, British Empire forces, together with the *Arbegnoch*, liberated Ethiopia in the course of the East African campaign in 1941. The country was placed under British military administration, and then Ethiopia's full sovereignty was restored with the signing of the Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement in December 1944.[117]\n\n\nOn 24 October 1945, Ethiopia became a founding member of the United Nations. In 1952, Haile Selassie orchestrated a federation with Eritrea. He dissolved this in 1962 and annexed Eritrea, resulting in the Eritrean War of Independence.[*citation needed*] Haile Selassie also played a leading role in the formation of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).[118] Opinion within Ethiopia turned against Haile Selassie, owing to the worldwide 1973 oil crisis causing a sharp increase in gasoline prices starting on 13 February 1974, leading to student and worker protests.[119] The feudal oligarchical cabinet of Aklilu Habte-Wold was toppled, and a new government was formed with Endelkachew Makonnen serving as Prime Minister.[120]\n\n\n\n### Derg era (1974\u20131991)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Ethiopian Revolution, Derg, People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, Ethiopian Civil War, Red Terror, and 1983\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Mengistu Haile Mariam was sentenced to death *in absentia* for committing crimes during his rule\nHaile Selassie's rule ended on 12 September 1974, when he was deposed by the Derg, a committee made up of military and police officers.[121] After the execution of 60 former government and military officials,[122] the new Provisional Military Administrative Council abolished the monarchy in March 1975 and established Ethiopia as a Marxist-Leninist state.[123] The abolition of feudalism, increased literacy, nationalization, and sweeping land reform including the resettlement and villagization from the Ethiopian Highlands became priorities.[124]\n\n\nAfter a power struggle in 1977, Mengistu Halie Mariam gained undisputed leadership of the Derg.[125] In 1977, Somalia, which had previously been receiving assistance and arms from the USSR, invaded Ethiopia in the Ogaden War, capturing part of the Ogaden region. Ethiopia recovered it after it began receiving massive military aid from the Soviet bloc countries.[126][127][128]\n\n\nIn 1976\u201378, up to 500,000 were killed as a result of the Red Terror,[129] a violent political repression campaign by the Derg against various opposition groups.[130][131][132] In 1987, the Derg dissolved itself and established the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE) upon the adoption of the 1987 Constitution of Ethiopia.[133] A 1983\u201385 famine affected around 8 million people, resulting in 1 million dead. Insurrections against authoritarian rule sprang up, particularly in the northern regions of Eritrea and Tigray. The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) merged with other ethnically based opposition movements in 1989, to form the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF).[134]\n\n\nThe collapse of Marxism\u2013Leninism during the revolutions of 1989 coincided with the Soviet Union stopping aid to Ethiopia altogether in 1990.[135][136][137] EPRDF forces advanced on Addis Ababa in May 1991, and Mengistu fled the country and was granted asylum in Zimbabwe.[138][139]\n\n\n\n### Federal Democratic Republic (1991\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the federal government of Ethiopia\n\nFurther information: Eritrean\u2013Ethiopian border conflict, Ethiopian civil conflict (2018\u2013present), and Tigray War\nSee also: Eritrean independence referendum, 1993\n\n![](image)Ethiopian civil conflict: territorial control as of September 2023[d]\nIn July 1991, the EPRDF convened a National Conference to establish the Transitional Government of Ethiopia composed of an 87-member Council of Representatives and guided by a national charter that functioned as a transitional constitution.[140] In 1994, a new constitution was written that established a parliamentary republic with a bicameral legislature and a judicial system.[141]\n\n\nIn April 1993, Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia after a national referendum.[142] In May 1998, a border dispute with Eritrea led to the Eritrean\u2013Ethiopian War, which lasted until June 2000 and cost both countries an estimated $1\u00a0million a day.[143] This had a negative effect on Ethiopia's economy, and a border conflict between the two countries would continue until 2018.[144][145] As of 2018, further civil war in Ethiopia continues, mainly due to destabilization of the country.\n\n\nEthnic violence rose during the late 2010s and early 2020s,[146][147] with various clashes and conflicts leading to millions of Ethiopians being displaced.[148][149][150]\n\n\nThe federal government that elections for election in 2020 (later being rescheduled to 2021) be cancelled, due to health and safety concerns about COVID-19.[151] The Tigray Region's TPLF opposed this, and proceeded to hold elections anyway on 9 September 2020.[152][153] Relations between the federal government and Tigray deteriorated rapidly,[154] and in November 2020, Ethiopia began a military offensive in Tigray in response to attacks on army units stationed there, marking the beginning of the Tigray War.[155][156] By March 2022, as many as 500,000 people had died as a result of violence and famine.[157][158][159] After a number of peace and mediation proposals in the intervening years, Ethiopia and the Tigrayan rebel forces agreed to a cessation of hostilities on 2 November 2022.[160]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\n### Government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Ethiopia, Law of Ethiopia, and Judiciary of Ethiopia\n\nSee also: Rulers and Heads of State of Ethiopia\n\n![](image)House of People's Representatives is the lower house of the Ethiopian Federal Parliamentary Assembly\nEthiopia is a federal parliamentary republic, wherein the Prime Minister is the head of government, and the President is the head of state but with largely ceremonial powers. Executive power is exercised by the government and federal legislative power vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament. The House of Federation is the upper chamber of the bicameral legislature with 108 seats, and the lower chamber is the House of Peoples' Representatives (HoPR) with 547 seats. The House of Federation is chosen by the regional councils whereas MPs of the HoPR are elected directly, in turn, they elect the president for a six-year term and the prime minister for a 5-year term.\n\n\nThe Ethiopian judiciary consists of dual system with two court structures: the federal and state courts. The FDRE Constitution vested federal judicial authority to the Federal Supreme Court which can overturn and review decisions of subordinate federal courts; itself has regular division assigned for fundamental errors of law. In addition, the Supreme Court can perform circuit hearings in established five states at any states of federal levels or \"area designated for its jurisdiction\" if deemed \"necessary for the efficient rendering of justice\".[161][162]\n\n\nThe Federal Supreme Proclamation granted three subject matter principles: laws, parties and place to federal court jurisdiction, first \"cases arising under the Constitution, federal laws and international treaties\", second over \"parties specified by federal laws\".[163]\n\n\nOn the basis of Article 78 of the 1994 Ethiopian Constitution, the judiciary is completely independent of the executive and the legislature.[164] To ensure this, the vice-president and President of the Supreme Court appointed by Parliament on the nomination of Prime Minister. Once elected, the executive power has no authority to remove from office. Other judges are nominated by the Federal Judicial Administration Council (FJAC) on the basis of transparent criteria and the Prime Minister's recommendation for appointment in the HoPR. In all cases, judges cannot be removed from their duty unless they retired, violated disciplinary rules, gross incompatibility, or inefficiency to unfit due to ill health. Contrary, the majority vote of HoPR have the right to sanction removal in federal judiciary level or state council in cases of state judges.[165] In 2015, the realities of this provision were questioned in a report prepared by Freedom House.[166]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Ethiopia\n![](image)\nPrime Minister Abiy Ahmed\n![](image)\nPresident Sahle-Work Zewde\n\nPost-1995, Ethiopia's politics has been liberalized which promotes all-encompassing reforms to the country. Today, its economy is based on mixed, market-oriented principles.[165] Ethiopia has eleven semi-autonomous administrative regions that have the power to raise and spend their own revenues.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe first multiparty election took place in May 1995, which was won by the EPRDF.[167] The president of the transitional government, EPRDF leader Meles Zenawi, became the first Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, and Negasso Gidada was elected its president.[168] Meles' government was consistenly re-elected; however, these results were heavily criticized by international observers, and denounced by the opposition as fraudulent.[169]\n\n\nMeles died on 20 August 2012 in Brussels, where he was being treated for an unspecified illness.[170] Deputy Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn was appointed as a new prime minister until the 2015 elections,[171] and remained so afterwards with his party in control of every parliamentary seat.[172] On 15 February 2018, Hailemariam resigned as Prime Minister, following years of protests and a state of emergency.[173][174][175] Abiy Ahmed became prime minister following Hailemariam's resignation. He made a historic visit to Eritrea in 2018, ending the state of conflict between the two countries,[145] and was awarded the Nobel prize for peace in 2019.[176]\n\n\nAccording to the Democracy Index published by the United Kingdom-based Economist Intelligence Unit in late 2010, Ethiopia was an \"authoritarian regime\", ranking as the 118th-most democratic out of 167 countries.[177] Ethiopia had dropped 13 places on the list since 2008, and the 2010 report attributed the drop to the government's crackdown on opposition activities, media, and civil society before the 2010 parliamentary election, which the report argued had made Ethiopia a *de facto* one-party state.[178]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in G8 Group meeting in 2007 File:Israeli PM with Ethiopian Prime Minister Ahmed.jpgEthiopian Prime Minister Ali with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu\nEthiopia was historically a trading nation that exported goods such as gold, ivory, exotic animals, and incense.[179] Many historians[*who?*] have concluded that modern Ethiopian foreign relations began under Emperor Tewodros II, who during his reign sought to re-establish a cohesive Ethiopian state, but was thwarted by the British expedition of 1868.[180] Since then, the country was seen redundant by world powers until the opening of Suez Canal due to an influence of Mahdist War.[181][*clarification needed*]\n\n\nToday, Ethiopia maintains strong relations with China, Israel, Mexico, Turkey and India as well as neighboring countries. Ethiopia is a strategic partner of Global War on Terrorism and African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).[182] US. Former President Barack Obama was the first incumbent US president to visit Ethiopia in July 2015; the speech he gave in African Union during this trip focused on combatting Islamic terrorism.[183][184] Emigration from Ethiopia is primarily directed towards Europe, including Italy, United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden and Australia, while emigration to the Middle East is primarily to Saudi Arabia and Israel. Ethiopia is founding member of the Group of 24 (G-24), the Non-Aligned Movement and the G77. In 1963, the Organization of African Unity, which later renamed itself the African Union, was founded in Addis Ababa, which today hosts the secretariat of the African Union, the African Union Commission. In addition, Ethiopia is also a member of the Pan African Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the African Standby Force and many of global NGOs focused on Africa.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nEthiopia's foreign relations with both Sudan and Egypt are somewhat fraught owing to the effects the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam project, which was escalated in 2020, would have on water rights in the region.[185][186] Despite six upstream countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania) signing the Nile Basin Initiative in 2010, Egypt and Sudan rejected a water sharing treaty, citing the reduction of amount of water to the Nile Basin and the challenge it would pose to their historic connection of water rights.[187][188] In 2020, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed warned that \"No force can stop Ethiopia from building a dam. If there is need to go to war, we could get millions readied.\"[189]\n\n\nEthiopia is one of the African countries that as founding member of League of Nations, which served as the predecessor for the United Nations, since 1923. UN taskforces in Ethiopia deal primarily with humanitarian issues and development. Some of its agencies[*which?*] maintain regional ties with United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and the African Union. The UN prioritizes sustainable development in Ethiopia, including fighting poverty, sustainable economic growth, climate change policy, educational and healthcare provisions, increasing employment, and environmental protection.[190]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(September 2023)*\n |\n\n\nMain articles: Subdivisions of Ethiopia, Regions of Ethiopia, List of zones of Ethiopia, and Districts of Ethiopia\n\nEthiopia is administratively divided into four levels: regions, zones, *woredas* (districts) and *kebele* (wards).[191][192] The country comprises 12 regions and two city administrations under these regions, plenty of zones, woredas and neighbourhood administration: kebeles. The two federal-level city administrations are Addis Ababa and Dire Dava.[193]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of regions and zones of Ethiopia (before August 2023)\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Military history of Ethiopia and Ethiopian National Defense Force\n\n![](image)Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) training under AMISOM, 2021\nThe Ethiopian army's origins and military traditions date back to the earliest history of Ethiopia. Due to Ethiopia's location between the Middle East and Africa, it has long been in the middle of Eastern and Western politics and has been subject to foreign invasions. In 1579, the Ottoman Empire's attempt to expand from a coastal base at Massawa during the Ottoman conquest of Habesh was defeated.[194] The Army of the Ethiopian Empire was also able to defeat the Egyptians in 1876 at Gura, led by Ethiopian Emperor Yohannes IV.[195]\n\n\nThe Ethiopian Army under Kagnew Battalion unit involved in the Korean War from 1950, fought as part of United Nations Command. Some publications stated that Ethiopian troops remained for 15 years, though other stated they left until 1975, as part of the UN Command.[196] The battalion sized 6,037 troops at the time of the war.[197]\n\n\nThe Ethiopian National Defense Force is the military force of Ethiopia. The ENDF consists of two separate branches: the Ethiopian Ground Forces and the Ethiopian Air Force. Since 1996, Ethiopia has lacked a navy as the country is landlocked; however, in 2018 Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed re-established the Ethiopian Navy, which is currently undergoing training with an unknown date of formal formation.[198][199]\n\n\nThe Ethiopian military is often stated to be the strongest in East Africa, and among the top five strongest militaries in the continent of Africa. Per some estimates, it is the 49th most capable military in the world.[200][201]\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law enforcement in Ethiopia and Crime in Ethiopia\n\nSee also: Police brutality in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Ethiopian federal police vehicles driving through Addis Ababa\nThe constitution guarantees law enforcement duty to the Ethiopian Federal Police (EFP). The EFP is responsible for safeguarding and public welfare in federal level. Founded in 1995, the federal police surveyed by Federal Police Commissioner since October 2000; the Federal Police Commissioner then reports task to the Ministry of Peace, however it was overrode after political reforms in 2018, and directed to the parliament. In previous years, the federal police reports the Ministry's tasks directly. In addition, the federal police have ability to disclose regional police commissions, in order for assistance. Independently, the local militias uphold security.[202]\n\n\nBribery is a basic concern, especially observed by traffic police. Police brutality appeared as severe in recent years. On 26 August 2019, a video of handcuffed man beaten by two police officers as an elderly woman intervened the scene in Addis Ababa went viral. Recent police misconduct is said to be a failure of Federal Police Commissioner to abide Article 52 of the constitution, which states investigation of unlawful use of force, and dismissal of those misconducted officer. The African Union's Luanda and Robben Island Guidelines or the United Nations' Declaration on Justice for Victims of Abuse of Power and their Basic Principles on the Use of Force & Firearms are once obligated to the Ethiopian government disciplinary committee to combat police brutality in both individual and systemic level.[203]\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Human rights in Ethiopia\n\nFurther information: War crimes in the Tigray War\n\n![](image)Peaceful demonstrators in Tigray calling for the full implementation of the 2022 Pretoria Agreement; July 2023\nHuman rights violations often often involve ethnic and communal violence in the country.[204] In a 2016 demonstration, 100 peaceful protestors were killed by direct government gunfire in the Oromia and Amhara regions.[205] The UN called for observers on the ground in Ethiopia to investigate this incident, but the Ethiopian government refused this call.[206][207] The protests were about land grabs and a lack of basic human rights, such as the freedom to elect their representatives.[208] Journalists and activists have been threatened or arrested for their coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia.[209] LGBT people are legally persecuted within Ethiopia.[210]\n\n\nMerera Gudina, leader of the Oromo People's Congress, said the East African country was at a \"crossroads\". He added in the interview with Reuters: \"People are demanding their rights\", he said. \"People are fed up with what the regime has been doing for a quarter of a century. They're protesting against land grabs, reparations, stolen elections, the rising cost of living, many things. \"If the government continue to repress while the people are demanding their rights in the millions that (civil war) is one of the likely scenarios.\"[208]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Relief map of Ethiopia\nAt 1,104,300 square kilometres (426,372.61\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[211] Ethiopia is the world's 28th-largest country, comparable in size to Bolivia. It lies between the 3rd parallel north and the 15th parallel north and longitudes 33rd meridian east and 48th meridian east.\n\n\nThe major portion of Ethiopia lies in the Horn of Africa, which is the easternmost part of the African landmass. The territories that have frontiers with Ethiopia are Eritrea to the north and then, moving in a clockwise direction, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan and Sudan. Within Ethiopia is a vast highland complex of mountains and dissected plateaus divided by the Great Rift Valley, which runs generally southwest to northeast and is surrounded by lowlands, steppes, or semi-desert. There is a great diversity of terrain with wide variations in climate, soils, natural vegetation and settlement patterns.\n\n\nEthiopia is an ecologically diverse country, ranging from the deserts along the eastern border to the tropical forests in the south to extensive Afromontane in the northern and southwestern parts. Lake Tana in the north is the source of the Blue Nile. It also has many endemic species, notably the gelada, the walia ibex and the Ethiopian wolf (\"Simien fox\"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.\n\n\nThe nation is a land of geographical contrasts, ranging from the vast fertile west, with its forests and numerous rivers, to the world's hottest settlement of Dallol in its north. The Ethiopian Highlands are the largest continuous mountain ranges in Africa, and the Sof Omar Caves contains the largest cave on the continent. Ethiopia also has the second-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Africa.[212]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Climate of Ethiopia and Climate change in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)K\u00f6ppen climate classification of Ethiopia\nThe predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic-induced variation. The Ethiopian Highlands cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the Equator. Most of the country's major cities are located at elevations of around 2,000\u20132,500\u00a0m (6,562\u20138,202\u00a0ft) above sea level, including historic capitals such as Gondar and Axum. The modern capital, Addis Ababa, is situated on the foothills of Mount Entoto at an elevation of around 2,400 metres (7,900\u00a0ft). It experiences a mild climate year round. With temperatures fairly uniform year round, the seasons in Addis Ababa are largely defined by rainfall: a dry season from October to February, a light rainy season from March to May, and a heavy rainy season from June to September. The average annual rainfall is approximately 1,200 millimetres (47\u00a0in).\n\n\nThere are on average seven hours of sunshine per day. The dry season is the sunniest time of the year, though even at the height of the rainy season in July and August there are still usually several hours per day of bright sunshine. The average annual temperature in Addis Ababa is 16\u00a0\u00b0C (60.8\u00a0\u00b0F), with daily maximum temperatures averaging 20\u201325\u00a0\u00b0C (68.0\u201377.0\u00a0\u00b0F) throughout the year, and overnight lows averaging 5\u201310\u00a0\u00b0C (41.0\u201350.0\u00a0\u00b0F).\n\n\nMost major cities and tourist sites in Ethiopia lie at a similar elevation to Addis Ababa and have a comparable climate. In less elevated regions, particularly the lower lying Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands in the east of Ethiopia, the climate can be significantly hotter and drier. Dallol, in the Danakil Depression in this eastern zone, has the world's highest average annual temperature of 34\u00a0\u00b0C (93.2\u00a0\u00b0F).\n\n\n\n![](image)The Blue Nile falls during winter provides over 86 percent of the Nile river's water coming from melted snow in the Simien mountains below 0.[213][214]\nEthiopia is vulnerable to many of the effects of climate change. These include increases in temperature and changes in precipitation. Climate change in these forms threatens food security and the economy, which is agriculture based.[215] Many Ethiopians have been forced to leave their homes and travel as far as the Gulf, Southern Africa and Europe.[216]\n\n\nSince April 2019, the Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has promoted Beautifying Sheger, a development project that aims to reduce the negative effects of climate change \u2013 among other things \u2013 in the capital city Addis Ababa.[217] In the following May, the government held \"Dine for Sheger\", a fundraising event in order to cover some of the $1\u00a0billion needed through the public.[218] $25\u00a0million was raised through the expensive event, both through the cost of attending and donations.[219] Two Chinese railway companies under the Belt and Road Initiative between China and Ethiopia had supplied funds to develop 12 of the total 56 kilometres.[220]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Ethiopia\nSee also: Environmental issues in Ethiopia and Deforestation in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)A Walia Ibex in Simien Mountains National Park, one of the national symbols of Ethiopia only found in the Northern parts of the country\nEthiopia is a global centre of avian diversity. To date more than 856 bird species have been recorded in Ethiopia, twenty of which are endemic to the country.[221] Sixteen species are endangered or critically endangered. Many of these birds feed on butterflies, like the *Bicyclus anynana*.[222][*full citation needed*]\n\n\nHistorically, throughout the African continent, wildlife populations have been rapidly declining due to logging, civil wars, pollution, poaching, and other human factors.[223] A 17-year-long civil war, along with severe drought, negatively affected Ethiopia's environmental conditions, leading to even greater habitat degradation.[224] Habitat destruction is a factor that leads to endangerment. When changes to a habitat occur rapidly, animals do not have time to adjust. Human impact threatens many species, with greater threats expected as a result of climate change induced by greenhouse gases.[225] With carbon dioxide emissions in 2010 of 6,494,000 tonnes, Ethiopia contributes just 0.02% to the annual human-caused release of greenhouse gases.[226]\n\n\nEthiopia has 31 endemic species of mammals.[227] Ethiopia has many species listed as critically endangered and vulnerable to global extinction. The threatened species in Ethiopia can be broken down into three categories (based on IUCN ratings): critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable.[227]\n\n\nEthiopia is one of the eight fundamental and independent centres of origin for cultivated plants in the world.[228] However, deforestation is a major concern for Ethiopia as studies suggest loss of forest contributes to soil erosion, loss of nutrients in the soil, loss of animal habitats, and reduction in biodiversity. At the beginning of the 20th century, around 420,000\u00a0km2 (or 35%) of Ethiopia's land was covered by trees, but recent research indicates that forest cover is now approximately 11.9% of the area.[229] The country had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.16/10, ranking it 50th globally out of 172 countries.[230]\n\n\nEthiopia loses an estimated 1,410\u00a0km2 of natural forests each year due to firewood collection, conversion to farmland, overgrazing, and use of forest wood for building material. Between 1990 and 2005 the country lost approximately 21,000\u00a0km2 of forests.[231] Current government programs to control deforestation consist of education, promoting reforestation programs, and providing raw materials which are alternatives to timber. In rural areas the government also provides non-timber fuel sources and access to non-forested land to promote agriculture without destroying forest habitat.[232]\n\n\nOrganizations such as SOS and Farm Africa are working with the federal government and local governments to create a system of forest management.[233]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Ethiopia and Industrial sector in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Development of GDP per capita\nEthiopia registered the fastest economic growth under Meles Zenawi's administration.[234]\nAccording to the IMF, Ethiopia was one of the fastest growing economies in the world, registering over 10% economic growth from 2004 through 2009.[235] It was the fastest-growing non-oil-dependent African economy in the years 2007 and 2008.[236] In 2015, the World Bank highlighted that Ethiopia had witnessed rapid economic growth with real domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 10.9% between 2004 and 2014.[237]\n\n\nIn 2008 and 2011, Ethiopia's growth performance and considerable development gains were challenged by high inflation and a difficult balance of payments situation. Inflation surged to 40% in August 2011 because of loose monetary policy, large civil service wage increase in early 2011, and high food prices.[238] For 2011\u201312, end-year inflation was projected to be about 22%, and single digit inflation is projected in 2012\u201313 with the implementation of tight monetary and fiscal policies.[239]\n\n\nIn spite of fast growth in recent years, GDP per capita is one of the lowest in the world, and the economy faces a number of serious structural problems. However, with a focused investment in public infrastructure and industrial parks, Ethiopia's economy is addressing its structural problems to become a hub for light manufacturing in Africa.[240] In 2019 a law was passed allowing expatriate Ethiopians to invest in Ethiopia's financial service industry.[241]\n\n\n\n![](image)An Ethiopian logistics shipping cargo docked at the red sea\nThe Ethiopian constitution specifies that rights to own land belong only to \"the state and the people\", but citizens may lease land for up to 99 years, but are unable to mortgage or sell. Renting out land for a maximum of twenty years is allowed and this is expected to ensure that land goes to the most productive user. Land distribution and administration is considered an area where corruption is institutionalized, and facilitation payments as well as bribes are often demanded when dealing with land-related issues.[242] As there is no land ownership, infrastructural projects are most often simply done without asking the land users, which then end up being displaced and without a home or land. A lot of anger and distrust sometimes results in public protests. In addition, agricultural productivity remains low, and frequent droughts still beset the country, also leading to internal displacement.[243]\n\n\n\n### Energy and hydropower[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Energy in Ethiopia and List of power stations in Ethiopia\n\nEthiopia has 14 major rivers flowing from its highlands, including the Nile. It has the largest water reserves in Africa. As of 2012[update], hydroelectric plants represented around 88.2% of the total installed electricity generating capacity.\n\n\nThe remaining electrical power was generated from fossil fuels (8.3%) and renewable sources (3.6%).\n\n\nThe electrification rate for the total population in 2016 was 42%, with 85% coverage in urban areas and 26% coverage in rural areas. As of 2016[update], total electricity production was 11.15\u00a0TW\u22c5h and consumption was 9.062\u00a0TW\u22c5h. There were 0.166\u00a0TW\u22c5h of electricity exported, 0\u00a0kW\u22c5h imported, and 2.784\u00a0GW of installed generating capacity.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)A factory in Dire Dawa: one of Ethiopia's biggest economic cities\nEthiopia delivers roughly 81% of water volume to the Nile through the river basins of the Blue Nile, Sobat River and Atbara. In 1959, Egypt and Sudan signed a bilateral treaty, the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement, which gave both countries exclusive maritime rights over the Nile waters. Ever since, Egypt has discouraged almost all projects in Ethiopia that sought to use the local Nile tributaries. This had the effect of discouraging external financing of hydropower and irrigation projects in western Ethiopia, thereby impeding water resource-based economic development projects. However, Ethiopia is in the process of constructing a large 6,450 MW hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile river. When completed, this Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is slated to be the largest hydroelectric power station in Africa.[244] The Gibe III hydroelectric project is so far the largest in the country with an installed capacity of 1,870\u00a0MW. For the year 2017\u201318 (2010 E.C) this hydroelectric dam generated 4,900\u00a0GW\u22c5h.[245]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture in Ethiopia\nAgriculture constitutes around 85% of the labour force. However, the service sector represents the largest portion of the GDP.[19] Many other economic activities depend on agriculture, including marketing, processing, and export of agricultural products. Production is overwhelmingly by small-scale farmers and enterprises, and a large part of commodity exports are provided by the small agricultural cash-crop sector. Principal crops include coffee, legumes, oilseeds, cereals, potatoes, sugarcane, and vegetables. Ethiopia is also a Vavilov centre of diversity for domesticated crops, including enset,[246] coffee and teff.\n\n\nExports are almost entirely agricultural commodities (with the exception of Gold exports), and coffee is the largest foreign exchange earner. Ethiopia is Africa's second biggest maize producer.[247] According to UN estimations the per capita GDP of Ethiopia has reached $357 as of 2011[update].[248]\n\n\n\n### Exports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Coffee production in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)\nLight rail train in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia which hosts over 100,000 passengers a day[*citation needed*]\n![](image)\nEthiopia's biggest company Ethiopian Airlines which has an annual revenue of 6.1 billion dollars making it the 14th biggest airlines in revenue: contributes to the country's export business[*citation needed*]\n![](image)\nEthio Telecom is one of the country's biggest companies which generates over a billion dollars annually[*citation needed*]\n\nEthiopia is often considered as the birthplace of coffee since cultivation began in the 9th century.[249] Exports from Ethiopia in the 2009\u20132010 financial year totalled US$1.4\u00a0billion.[250] Ethiopia produces more coffee than any other nation on the continent.[251] \"Coffee provides a livelihood for close to 15 million Ethiopians, 16% of the population. Farmers in the eastern part of the country, where a warming climate is already impacting production, have struggled in recent years, and many are currently reporting largely failed harvests as a result of a prolonged drought\".[252]\n\n\nEthiopia also has the 5th largest inventory of cattle.[253] Other main export commodities are khat, gold, leather products, and oilseeds. Recent development of the floriculture sector means Ethiopia is poised to become one of the top flower and plant exporters in the world.[254]\n\n\nCross-border trade by pastoralists is often informal and beyond state control and regulation. In East Africa, over 95% of cross-border trade is through unofficial channels. The unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep, and goats from Ethiopia sold to Somalia, Djibouti, and Kenya generates an estimated total value of between 250 and US$300\u00a0million annually (100 times more than the official figure).[255]\n\n\nThis trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions, and promote regional integration.[255] However, the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allowing disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, the government of Ethiopia is purportedly unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.[255] Recent initiatives have sought to document and regulate this trade.[255]\n\n\nWith the private sector growing slowly, designer leather products like bags are becoming a big export business, with Taytu becoming the first luxury designer label in the country.[256] Additional small-scale export products include cereals, pulses, cotton, sugarcane, potatoes, and hides. With the construction of various new dams and growing hydroelectric power projects around the country, Ethiopia also plans to export electric power to its neighbours.[257][258]\n\n\nMost regard Ethiopia's large water resources and potential as its \"white oil\" and its coffee resources as \"black gold\".[259][260]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Ethiopia\n\nEthiopia has 926\u00a0km of electrified 1,435\u00a0mm (4\u00a0ft\u00a08+1\u20442\u00a0in) standard gauge railways, 656\u00a0km for the Addis Ababa\u2013Djibouti Railway between Addis Ababa and the Port of Djibouti (via Awash)[261] and 270\u00a0km for the Awash\u2013Hara Gebeya Railway between Addis Ababa and the twin cities of Dessie/Kombolcha[262]\n\n\nEthiopia had 58 airports as of 2012[update],[19] and 61 as of 2016[update].[263] Among these, the Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa and the Aba Tenna Dejazmach Yilma International Airport in Dire Dawa accommodate international flights.\n\n\nEthiopian Airlines, a member of the Star Alliance, is the country's flag carrier, and is wholly owned by the Government of Ethiopia.[264] From its hub at the Bole International Airport, the airline serves a network of 102 international passenger, 20 domestic passenger, and 44 cargo destinations.[265][266] It is also one of the fastest-growing carriers in the industry and continent.[267]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Ethiopia\n\nTourism in Ethiopia accounted for 5.5% of GDP growth in 2006. In 2015, the European Council named Ethiopia \"World's Best Tourism Destination\".[268] In 2020 the country registered 518,000 tourists, ranked 126th in the world.[269] There are nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Ethiopia:[270] Tourist destinations include Ethiopia's collection of national parks (including Semien Mountains National Park), and historic sites, such as the cities of Axum, Lalibela and Gondar, Harar Jugol walled city, Negash Mosque, in Negash and Sof Omar Caves.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Ethiopia\n\nSee also: Ethiopians and List of ethnic groups in Ethiopia\n\n| Ethnic groups in Ethiopia |\n| --- |\n| Ethnic group |  | Population |\n| Oromo |  | 25.4 (34.4%) |\n| Amhara |  | 19.9 (27.0%) |\n| Somali |  | 4.59 (6.2%) |\n| Tigrayans |  | 4.49 (6.1%) |\n| Sidama |  | 2.95 (4.0%) |\n| Gurage |  | 1.86 (2.5%) |\n| Welayta |  | 1.68 (2.3%) |\n| Afar |  | 1.28 (1.7%) |\n| Hadiya |  | 1.27 (1.7%) |\n| Gamo |  | 1.10 (1.5%) |\n| Others |  | 9.30 (12.6%) |\n| Population in millions according to 2007 Census[6] |\n\nEthiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world.[271] Its total population has grown from 38.1\u00a0million in 1983 to 109.5\u00a0million in 2018.[272] According to UN estimations in 2013, life expectancy had improved substantially over time, with male life expectancy reported to be 56 years and for women 60 years.[248]\n\n\nEthiopia's population is highly diverse, containing over 80 different ethnic groups, the four largest of which are the Oromo, Amhara, Somali and Tigrayans. According to the Ethiopian national census of 2007, the Oromo are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, at 34.4% of the nation's population. The Amhara represent 27.0% of the country's inhabitants, while Somalis and Tigrayans represent 6.2% and 6.1% of the population respectively.[6]\n\n\nAfroasiatic-speaking communities make up the majority of the population. Among these, Semitic speakers often collectively refer to themselves as the Habesha people. The Arabic form of this term (*al-\u1e24abasha*) is the etymological basis of \"Abyssinia\", the former name of Ethiopia in English and other European languages.[273]\n\n\nIn 2009, Ethiopia hosted a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering approximately 135,200. The majority of this population came from Somalia (approximately 64,300 persons), Eritrea (41,700) and Sudan (25,900). The Ethiopian government required nearly all refugees to live in refugee camps.[274]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Ethiopia\n\nLanguages of Ethiopia as of 2007[update] Census[6]\n\n\n\nOromo (33.8%)\nAmharic (29.3%)\nSomali (6.2%)\nTigrinya (5.9%)\nSidamo (4.0%)\nWolaytta (2.2%)\nGurage (2.0%)\nAfar (1.7%)\nHadiyya (1.7%)\nGamo (1.5%)\nothers (11.6%)\n\nAccording to Glottolog, there are 109 languages spoken in Ethiopia, while *Ethnologue* lists 90 individual languages spoken in the country.[275][276] Most people in the country speak Afroasiatic languages of the Cushitic or Semitic branches. The former includes the Oromo language, spoken by the Oromo, and Somali, spoken by the Somalis; the latter includes Amharic, spoken by the Amhara, and Tigrinya, spoken by the Tigrayans. Together, these four groups make up about three-quarters of Ethiopia's population. Other Afroasiatic languages with a significant number of speakers include the Cushitic Sidamo, Afar, Hadiyya and Agaw languages, as well as the Semitic Gurage languages, Harari, Silt'e, and Argobba languages.[6] Arabic, which also belongs to the Afroasiatic family, is likewise spoken in some areas.[277]\n\n\nEnglish is the most widely spoken foreign language, the medium of instruction in secondary schools and all tertiary education; federal laws are also published in British English in the Federal Negarit Gazeta including the 1995 constitution.[278]\n\n\nAmharic was the language of primary school instruction, but has been replaced in many areas by regional languages such as Oromo, Somali or Tigrinya.[279] All languages enjoy equal state recognition in the 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia.[141]\n\n\n\n#### Script[edit]\n\n\nEthiopia's principal orthography is the Ge'ez script. Employed as an abugida for several of the country's languages, it first came into usage in the 6th and 5th centuries BC as an abjad to transcribe the Semitic Ge'ez language.[280] Ge'ez now serves as the liturgical language of both the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churches. During the 1980s, the Ethiopic character set was computerized. It is today part of the Unicode standard as Ethiopic, Ethiopic Extended, Ethiopic Supplement and Ethiopic Extended-A.\n\n\nOther writing systems have also been used over the years by different Ethiopian communities. The latter include Bakri Sapalo's script for Oromo.[281]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)The Church of Saint George, Lalibela a pilgrimage site for Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church; the site is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Rock-Hewn Churches, Lalibela\".[282]\nAccording to the 2007 National Census, Christians make up 62.8% of the country's population (43.5% Ethiopian Orthodox, 19.3% other denominations), Muslims 33.9%, practitioners of traditional faiths 2.6%, and other religions 0.6%.[6] The ratio of the Christian to Muslim population has largely remained stable when compared to previous censuses conducted decades ago.[283] Sunnis form the majority of Muslims with non-denominational Muslims being the second largest group of Muslims, and the Shia and Ahmadiyyas are a minority. Sunnis are largely Shafi'is or Salafis, and there are also many Sufi Muslims there.[284]\n\n\nEthiopia has close historical ties with all three of the world's major Abrahamic religions. In the 4th century, the Ethiopian empire was one of the first in the world to officially adopt Christianity as the state religion. As a result of the resolutions of the Council of Chalcedon, in 451 the Miaphysites, which included the vast majority of Christians in Egypt and Ethiopia, were accused of monophysitism and designated as heretics under the common name of Coptic Christianity (see Oriental Orthodoxy).[285]\n\n\nThe Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is part of Oriental Orthodoxy. It is by far the largest Christian denomination, although a number of P'ent'ay (Protestant) churches have recently gained ground. Since 1930, a relatively small Ethiopian Catholic Church has existed in full communion with Rome, with adherents making up less than 1% of the total population.[283][286]\n\n\nIslam in Ethiopia dates back to the founding of the religion in 622 when a group of Muslims were counselled by Muhammad to escape persecution in Mecca. The disciples subsequently migrated to Abyssinia via modern-day Eritrea, which was at the time ruled by Ashama ibn-Abjar, a pious Christian emperor.[287]\n\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of cities and towns in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Sheger Park is the largest park in the country, hosting hundreds of thousands of visitors a year since its opening\nPopulation growth, migration, and urbanization are all straining both governments' and ecosystems' capacity to provide people with basic services.[288] Urbanization has steadily been increasing in Ethiopia, with two periods of significantly rapid growth. First, in 1936\u20131941 during the Italian occupation under Mussolini's fascist government, and then from 1967 to 1975 when the populations of urban areas tripled.[289]\n\n\nIn 1936, Italy annexed Ethiopia, building infrastructure to connect major cities, and a dam providing power and water.[290] This, along with the influx of Italians and labourers, was the major cause of rapid growth during this period. The second period of growth was from 1967 to 1975, when rural populations migrated to towns seeking work and better living conditions.[289]\n\n\nThis pattern slowed due to the 1975 Land Reform program instituted by the government, which provided incentives for people to stay in rural areas. As people moved from rural areas to the cities, there were fewer people to grow food for the population. The Land Reform Act was meant to increase agriculture since food production was not keeping up with population growth over the period of 1970\u20131983. This program encouraged the formation of peasant associations, large villages based on agriculture. The legislation did lead to an increase in food production, although there is debate over the cause; it may be related to weather conditions more than the reform.[291] Urban populations have continued to grow with an 8.1% increase from 1975 to 2000.[292]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or towns in EthiopiaCSA (Urban population projection values of 2016)[293]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank\n | Name | Region | Municipal pop.\n | Rank\n | Name | Region | Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Addis Ababa](image)Addis Ababa![Gondar](image)Gondar | 1 | Addis Ababa | Addis Ababa | 3,352,000 | 11 | Shashamane | Oromia | 154,587\n | ![Mek'ele](image)Mek'ele![Adama](image)Adama |\n| 2 | Gondar | Amhara | 341,991 | 12 | Bishoftu | Oromia | 153,847\n |\n| 3 | Mek'ele | Tigray | 340,858 | 13 | Sodo | SNNPR | 253,322\n |\n| 4 | Adama | Oromia | 338,940 | 14 | Arba Minch | SNNPR | 151,013\n |\n| 5 | Hawassa | SNNPR | 318,618 | 15 | Hosaena | SNNPR | 141,352\n |\n| 6 | Bahir Dar | Amhara | 297,794 | 16 | Harar | Harari | 133,000\n |\n| 7 | Dire Dawa | Dire Dawa | 285,000 | 17 | Dila | SNNPR | 119,276\n |\n| 8 | Dessie | Amhara | 198,428 | 18 | Nekemte | Oromia | 115,741\n |\n| 9 | Jimma | Oromia | 186,148 | 19 | Debre Birhan | Amhara | 107,827\n |\n| 10 | Jijiga | Somali | 164,321 | 20 | Asella | Oromia | 103,522\n |\n\n#### Rural and urban life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rural flight in Ethiopia\n\nMigration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives. In peasant associations daily life is a struggle to survive. About 16% of the population in Ethiopia lives on less than one dollar per day (2008). Only 65% of rural households in Ethiopia consume the World Health Organization's (WHO's) minimum standard of food per day (2,200 kilocalories), with 42% of children under 5 years old being underweight.[294]\n\n\n\n![](image)Addis Ababa seen at nighttime, the financial epicenter of the country\nMost poor families (75%) share their sleeping quarters with livestock, and 40% of children sleep on the floor, where nighttime temperatures average 5 degrees Celsius in the cold season.[294] The average family size is six or seven, living in a 30 square metre mud and thatch hut, with less than two hectares of land to cultivate.[294]\n\n\nThe peasant associations face a cycle of poverty. Since the landholdings are so small, farmers cannot allow the land to lie fallow, which reduces soil fertility.[294] This land degradation reduces the production of fodder for livestock, which causes low milk yields.[294] Since the community burns livestock manure as fuel, rather than plowing the nutrients back into the land, the crop production is reduced.[294] The low productivity of agriculture leads to inadequate incomes for farmers, hunger, malnutrition and disease. These unhealthy farmers have difficulty working the land and the productivity drops further.[294]\n\n\nAlthough conditions are drastically better in cities, all of Ethiopia suffers from poverty and poor sanitation. However, poverty in Ethiopia fell from 44% to 29.6% during 2000\u20132011, according to the World Bank.[295] In the capital city of Addis Ababa, 55% of the population used to live in slums.[290] Now, however, a construction boom in both the private and the public sector has led to a dramatic improvement in living standards in major cities, particularly in Addis Ababa. Notably, government-built condominium housing complexes have sprung up throughout the city, benefiting close to 600,000 individuals.[296] Sanitation is the most pressing need in the city, with most of the population lacking access to waste treatment facilities. This contributes to the spread of illness through unhealthy water.[290]\n\n\nDespite the living conditions in the cities, the people of Addis Ababa are much better off than people living in the peasant associations owing to their educational opportunities. Unlike rural children, 69% of urban children are enrolled in primary school, and 35% of those are eligible to attend secondary school.[*clarification needed*][290] Addis Ababa has its own university as well as many other secondary schools. The literacy rate is 82%.[290]\n\n\nMany NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) are working to solve this problem; however, most are far apart, uncoordinated, and working in isolation.[292] The Sub-Saharan Africa NGO Consortium is attempting to coordinate efforts.[292]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Health in Ethiopia and Healthcare in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Declining child mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa and Ethiopia since 1950\nOnly a minority of Ethiopians are born in hospitals, while most are born in rural households. Those who are expected to give birth at home have elderly women serve as midwives who assist with the delivery.[297] The \"WHO estimates that a majority of maternal fatalities and disabilities could be prevented if deliveries were to take place at well-equipped health centres, with adequately trained staff\".[298] Birth rates, infant mortality rates, and death rates are lower in cities than in rural areas due to better access to education, medicines, and hospitals.[290] Life expectancy is better in cities compared to rural areas, but there have been significant improvements witnessed throughout the country as of 2016, the average Ethiopian living to be 62.2 years old, according to a UNDP report.[299] Despite sanitation being a problem, use of improved water sources is also on the rise; 81% in cities compared to 11% in rural areas.[292]\n\n\nEthiopia's main health problems are said to be communicable (contagious) diseases worsened by poor sanitation and malnutrition. Over 58\u00a0million people (nearly half the population) do not have access to clean water as of 2023.[300] These problems are exacerbated by the shortage of trained doctors and nurses and health facilities.[301] The World Health Organization's 2006 World Health Report gives a figure of 1,936 physicians (for 2003), which comes to about 2.6 per 100,000.[302]\n\n\nThe National Mental Health Strategy, published in 2012, introduced the development of policy designed to improve mental health care in Ethiopia. This strategy mandated that mental health be integrated into the primary health care system.[303] However, the success of the National Mental Health Strategy has been limited. For example, the burden of depression is estimated to have increased 34.2% from 2007 to 2017.[304] Furthermore, the prevalence of stigmatizing attitudes, inadequate leadership and co-ordination of efforts, as well as a lack of mental health awareness in the general population, all remain as obstacles to successful mental health care.[305]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Ethiopia\n\nSee also: Higher education in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Entrance of Addis Ababa University\nThe current system follows school expansion schemes which are very similar to the system in the rural areas during the 1980s, with an addition of deeper regionalization, providing rural education in students' own languages starting at the elementary level, and with more budgetary financing allocated to the education sector. Public education is free at primary levels and usually offers between age 7 and 12. The sequence of general education in Ethiopia is six years of primary school, then four years of lower secondary school followed by two years of higher secondary school.[306]\n\n\n\nThe Ethiopian education is governed by Ministry of Education and its cycle consists 4+4+2+2 system; elementary education consists of eight years, divided into two cycles of four years, and four years of secondary education, divided into two stages of two years.[307] National exams are conducted by the National Education Assessment and Examination Agency (NEAEA). Since 2018, there are two national exams: the Ethiopian General Secondary Education Certificate Examination (EGSECE), also known as Grade 10 national exam and Grade 12 national exam.[308]\n\n![](image)The Addis Ababa Science Museum of Art and Science serves as the country's biggest hub which showcases the country's newest innovationsToday, there are 30 public universities. Prior to 1991, Ethiopia did not have tertiary institution, but now there are 61 accredited private HEIs. The overall number of tertiary students in both public and private institutions exploded by more than 2,000 percent, from 34,000 in 1991 to 757,000 in 2014, per UIS data.[268] Access to education in Ethiopia has improved significantly. Approximately three million people were in primary school in 1994\u201395 but by 2008\u201309, primary enrolment had risen to 15.5\u00a0million \u2013 an increase of over 500%.[309] In 2013\u201314, Ethiopia had witnessed a significant boost in gross enrolment across all regions.[310] The national GER was 104.8% for boys, 97.8% for girls and 101.3% across both sexes.[311]\n\n\nThe literacy rate has increased in recent years: according to the 1994 census, the literacy rate in Ethiopia was 23.4%.[276] In 2007 it was estimated to be 39% (male 49.1% and female 28.9%).[312] A report by UNDP in 2011 showed that the literacy rate in Ethiopia was 46.7%. The same report also indicated that the female literacy rate had increased from 27 to 39 per cent from 2004 to 2011, and the male literacy rate had increased from 49 to 59 per cent over the same period for persons 10 years and older.[313] By 2015, the literacy rate had further increased, to 49.1% (57.2% male and 41.1% female).[314]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Cultural performance in Addis Ababa\nEthiopia's rich and diverse culture heavily influenced by the local population, an interaction of Semitic, Cushitic and less populous Nilo-Saharan speaking people, which evolved from first millennium BC. Semitic Tigrayans and Amharas, who dominated the politics in the past, distinguished from other population by hierarchical structure and agrarian life derived partly from South Arabia as a result of back migration, while the southern Cushitic (Oromo and Somali) are strong adherents to egalitarianism and pastoral life. Others including Kaffa, Sidamo, and Afar tradition derived from the latter people.[315]\n\n\nThe most common recognized culture observed in coffee ceremony. Unlike most countries, coffee is served in presence of social gathering, in family, friend or neighborhood level. There are three rounds of coffee drinking: the first one called \"awol\" (Tigrinya: \u12a3\u12ce\u120d), the second \"tona\" (\u1276\u1293) and the third \"baraka\" (\u1263\u122d\u12ab). The tradition of coffee legend goes back to Kaldi, a goat herder from Keffa Zone who noticed his goat was caught up with hysteria after they eat shrub that stimulate them to dance uncontrollably with rampant. After holding berries, he was advised exhibit to priests in nearby monastery. One monk called the generosity of Kaldi \"the Devil work\" and tossed to the fire, generating aromatic odor. The legend told that Kaldi lived in 850 CE, commonly associated with belief of starting coffee cultivation in Ethiopia in the 9th century.[249]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethiopian art\n\n![](image)An Orthodox bible dated at least 1,500 Years, being the oldest illustrating bible in the world, depicts Corinthian pillars\nArts of Ethiopia were largely influenced by Christian iconography throughout much of its history. This consisted of illuminated manuscripts, painting, crosses, icons and other metalwork such as crowns. Most historical arts were commissioned by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the state religion for a millennium. The earlier Aksumite period arts were stone carvings as evidenced in their stelae, though there is no surviving Christian art from this era. As Christianity was introduced, its iconography was partly influenced by Byzantine art. Most remaining arts beyond the early modern period were ruined as a result of invasion of the Adal Sultanate in the Ethiopian Highlands, but were revived by Catholic emissaries. The Western intervention in Ethiopian art began in the 20th century, with also maintaining traditional Ethiopian character.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of Ethiopia\n\n![](image)The Axumite Stella's in the Northern Part of Ethiopia dating well over a thousand year's serve as a remembrance of Ethiopia's past architecture.\nThe \"Bete Medhane Alem\" or \"House of our Saviour\" is one of the 12 churches in Lalibela built under Emperor Lalibela IPerhaps the most impressive architecture in antiquity was founded during D\u02bfmt period. Ashlar masonry was an archetype of South Arabian architecture with most architectural structure similarity.[316]\n\n\nThe Aksumite continued to flourish its architecture around the 4th century CE. Aksumite stelae commonly used single block and rocks. The Tomb of the False Door built for Aksumite emperors used monolithic style.[317] The Lalibela civilization was largely of Aksumite influence, but the layer of stones or wood is quite different for some dwelling.[318]\n\n\nIn Gondarine period, the architecture of Ethiopia was infused by Baroque, Arab, Turkish and Gujarati Indian styles independently taught by Portuguese emissaries in the 16th and 17th centuries. Example includes the imperial fortress Fasil Ghebbi, which is influenced by either of these styles. The medieval architecture also forborne the later 19th- and 20th-century era of designations.[319]\n\n\n\n### Philosophy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethiopian philosophy\n\nEthiopian philosophy has been superlatively prolific since ancient times in Africa, though offset of Greek and Patristic philosophy. The best known philosophical revival was in the early modern period figures such as Zera Yacob (1599\u20131692) and his student Walda Heywat, who wrote *Hatata* (*Inquiry*) in 1667 as an argument for the existence of God.\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethiopian literature\n\n![](image)Giyorgis of Segla, prolific religious author in the Late Middle Ages\nThe Ethiopian literature traced back to the Aksumite period in the 4th century, most of them are merely religious motifs. In royal inscription, they employed both Ge'ez and Greek language, but the latter was dismissed in 350. Unlike most Sub-Saharan African countries, Ethiopia has ancient distinct language, the Ge'ez, which dominated political and educational aspects. In spite of the current political instability in the country instigates endangering cultural heritage of these works, some improvements are made for preservation in recent years.[320]\n\n\nThe Ethiopian literary works mostly consisted of handwritten codex (branna, or \u1265\u122b\u1293 in Amharic). It is prepared by gathering parchment leaves and sewing to stick together. The codex size is considerably varies depending on volumes and preparation. For example, pocket size codex lengthens 45\u00a0cm, which is heavier in weight. Historians speculated that archaic codex is existed in Ethiopia. Today manuscripts resembling primitive codex are still evident for existence where parchment leaves are convenient for writing.[320]\n\n\nAnother notable writing book is protective (or magic) scroll, serving as written amulet. Some of these were intended for magical purpose, for example *ketab* is used for magical defence. Scrolls typically produced by *debtera*, non-ordained clergy expertise on exorcism and healings. About 30\u00a0cm scroll is portable whereas 2\u00a0cm is often unrolled and hanged to the wall of house. Scrolls emulating original medium of Ethiopia literature is highly disputed, where there is overwhelming evidence that Ge'ez language books were written in codex. In lesser, Ethiopia used accordion books (called *sensul*) which was dated to late 15th or 16th century, made up of folded parchment paper, with or without cover. Those book usually contain pictorial representation of life and death of religious figures, or significant texts have also juxtaposed.[320]\n\n\n\n#### Poetry[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsegaye Gebre-Medhin in 1980s one of Ethiopia's renowned writers\nEthiopia is highly popularized in poetry. Most poets recount past events, social unrests, poverty and famine. *Qene* is the most used element of Ethiopian poetry \u2013 regarded as a form of Amharic poetry, though the term generally refers to any poems. True qene requires advanced ingenious mindset. By providing two metaphorical words, i.e. one with obvious clues and the other is too convoluted conundrum, one must answer parallel meanings. Thus, this is called *sem ena work* (gold and wax).[321] The most notable poets are Tsegaye Gebre-Medhin, Kebede Michael and Mengistu Lemma.\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ethiopian calendar and Oromo calendar\nEthiopia has several local calendars. The most widely known is the Ethiopian calendar, also known as the Ge'ez calendar, and written with the ancient Ge'ez script, one of the oldest alphabets still in use in the world.[322] It is based on the older Alexandrian or Coptic calendar, which in turn derives from the Egyptian calendar. Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopian calendar has twelve months of exactly 30 days each plus five or six epagomenal days, which form a thirteenth month. The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Ge'ez[*citation needed*]\n\n\nLike the Julian calendar, the sixth epagomenal day\u2014which in essence is a leap day\u2014is added every four years without exception on 29 August of the Julian calendar, six months before the Julian leap day. Thus, the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1\u00a0M\u00e4sk\u00e4r\u00e4m, for years between 1901 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually 11 September (Gregorian), but falls on 12 September in years before the Gregorian leap year. It is approximately seven years and three months behind the Gregorian calendar because of an alternate calculation in determining the date of the Annunciation of Jesus.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAnother calendrical system was developed around 300\u00a0BC by the Oromo people. A lunar-stellar calendar, this Oromo calendar relies on astronomical observations of the moon in conjunction with seven particular stars or constellations. Oromo months (stars/lunar phases) are *Bittottessa* (Iangulum), *Camsa* (Pleiades), *Bufa* (Aldebarran), *Waxabajjii* (Belletrix), *Obora Gudda* (Central Orion-Saiph), *Obora Dikka* (Sirius), *Birra* (full moon), *Cikawa* (gibbous moon), *Sadasaa* (quarter moon), *Abrasa* (large crescent), *Ammaji* (medium crescent), and *Gurrandala* (small crescent).[323]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethiopian cuisine\n\nSee also: List of Ethiopian dishes and foods\n\n![](image)This meal consisting of *injera* and several kinds of *wat* (stew) is typical of Ethiopian cuisine.\nThe best-known Ethiopian cuisine consists of various types of thick meat stews, known as *wat* in Ethiopian culture, and vegetable side dishes served on top of injera, a large sourdough flatbread made of teff flour. This is not eaten with utensils, but instead the injera is used to scoop up the entr\u00e9es and side dishes. Almost universally in Ethiopia, it is common to eat from the same dish in the middle of the table with a group of people. It is also a common custom to feed others within a group or own hands\u2014a tradition referred to as \"gursha\".[324] Traditional Ethiopian cuisine employs no pork or shellfish of any kind, as both are forbidden in the Ethiopian Orthodox Christian, Islamic and Jewish faiths.\n\n\nChechebsa, Marqa, Chukko, Michirra and Dhanga are the most popular dishes from the Oromo. Kitfo, which originated among the Gurage, is one of the country's most popular delicacies. In addition, *Doro Wot* (\u12f6\u122e \u12c8\u1325 in Amharic) and Tsebehi Derho (\u133d\u1265\u1212 \u12f5\u122d\u1206 in Tigrinya), are other popular dishes, originating from northwestern Ethiopia.[*citation needed*] Tihlo (\u1325\u1215\u120e)\u2014which is a type of dumpling\u2014is prepared from roasted barley flour and originated in the Tigray Region. Tihlo is now very popular in Amhara and spreading further south.[325]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Communications in Ethiopia and Media in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)The Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation former headquarters in Addis Ababa\nThe Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation (EBC), formerly known as ETV, is the state media. Radio broadcasting was commenced earlier in 1935 before the television service began in 1962 with assistance of British firm Thomson and Emperor Haile Selassie.[3] Since 2015, EBC has upgraded its studios with modernized transmission.\n\n\nKana TV is the most popular TV channel in Ethiopia.[326] It is mainly known for dubbing foreign content into Amharic. Over several decades, the state television has served as the major mass media until in the late 2000s, when EBS TV launched as the first private television channel. Moreover, numerous private channels were commenced in 2016, culminating in the growth of privately owned media companies in the country. As an example, Fana TV has been the largest TV network since its launch in 2017.\n\n\nThe most widely circulated newspapers in Ethiopia are Addis Fortune, Capital Ethiopia, Ethiopian Reporter, Addis Zemen[*citation needed*] (*Amharic*) and Ethiopian Herald.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe sole internet service provider is the national telecommunications firm Ethio telecom. A large portion of users in the country access the internet through mobile devices.[327] As of July\u00a02016[update], there are around 4.29\u00a0million people who have internet access at their home as compared to a quarter of a million users a decade before that.[328] The Ethiopian government has at times intentionally shut down internet service in the country or restricted access to certain social media sites during periods of political unrest. In August 2016, following protest and demonstration in the Oromia Region, all access to the internet was shut down for a period of two days.[329] In June 2017, the government shut down access to the internet for mobile users during a period that coincided with the administration of university entrance examination. Although the reason for the restriction was not confirmed by the government,[327] the move was similar to a measure taken during the same period in 2016, after a leak of test questions.[330][331]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Ethiopia\n\nSee also: List of Ethiopian scientists\n\n![](image)\nPathobiologist Aklilu Lemma. In 1964, he discovered an alternative treatment for schistosomiasis, known as snail fever.[332]\n![](image)\nPaleoanthropologist Zeresenay Alemseged in 2013. He was best known for discovering fossilized hominin called *Selam* or \"Lucy's baby\" in December 2000.[333]\n\nScience and technology in Ethiopia emerging as progressive due to lack of organized institutions. Manufacturing and service providers often place themselves in competitive programming in order to advance innovative and technological solutions through in-house arenas. The Ethiopian Space Science and Technology is responsible for conducting multifaceted tasks regarding space and technology. In addition, Ethiopia also launched 70\u00a0kg ET-RSS1 multi-spectral remote sensing satellite in December 2019. The President Sahle-Work Zewde told prior in October 2019 that \"the satellite will provide all the necessary data on changes in climate and weather-related phenomena that would be used for the country's key targets in agriculture, forestry as well as natural resources protection initiatives.\" By January 2020, satellite manufacturing, assembling, integrating and testing began. This would also incremented facility built by French company funded by European Investment Bank (EIB). The main observatory Entoto Observatory and Space Science Research Center (EORC) allocated space programmes. The Ethiopian Biotechnology Institute is a part of Scientific Research & Development Services Industry, responsible for environmental and climate conservation.[334] Numerous profound scientists have contributed degree of honours and reputations. Some are Kitaw Ejigu, Mulugeta Bekele, Aklilu Lemma, Gebisa Ejeta and Melaku Worede.\n\n\nEthiopia is known for use of traditional medicine since millennia. The first epidemic occurred in Ethiopia was in 849, causing the Aksumite Emperor Abba Yohannes evicted from place due to \"God's punishment for misdeeds\". The first traditional medicine was claimed to be derived from this catastrophe, but the exact source is debated. Though differ from ethnic groups, traditional medicine often implements herbs, spiritual healing, bone-setting and minor surgical procedures in treating disease.[335] Others fields include conventional mathematics used to measure astrology, calendar and unit of measurement.\n\n\nEthiopia was ranked 125th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[336]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Ethiopia\n\nSee also: Ethiopian Golden Age of music\n\n![](image)Yared in a piece of 15th century Ethiopian sacred art holding a mequamia (prayer stick)\nThe music of Ethiopia is extremely diverse, with each of the country's 80 ethnic groups being associated with unique sounds. Ethiopian music uses a distinct modal system that is pentatonic, with characteristically long intervals between some notes. As with many other aspects of Ethiopian culture and tradition, tastes in music and lyrics are strongly linked with those in neighbouring Eritrea, Somalia, Djibouti, and Sudan.[337][338] Traditional singing in Ethiopia presents diverse styles of polyphony, (heterophony, drone, imitation, and counterpoint). Traditionally, lyricism in Ethiopian song writing is strongly associated with views of patriotism or national pride, romance, friendship, and a unique type of memoire known as *tizita*.\n\n\nSaint Yared, a 6th-century Aksumite composer, is widely regarded as the forerunner of traditional music of Eritrea and Ethiopia, creating liturgical music of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church. He also composed *Zema*, subdivided into three chants: Ge'ez, Ezel and Araray. Yared life thought to have been \"failure and success\" where his was poor performance in education. Yared then fired from the school and went to his uncle birthplace Murade Qal. There his saw caterpillar endeavours to reach a tree's peak. He epitomized to his real life and returned to the school with good spirit, later became prominent to political sphere. During the remaining of his lifetime, he was a friend of Aksumite Emperor Gebre Meskel and the exiled Nine Saints.[339]\n\n\nModern music traced back to the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie, where 40 Armenian orphans called Arba Lijoch arrived from Jerusalem to Addis Ababa. By 1924, the band was almost established as orchestral; but after World War II, several similar bands emerged such as Imperial Bodyguard Band, Army Band, and Police Band.[340]\n\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, traditional infused modern Ethiopian music was revived in what is known as the \"Golden Age\". Several notable musical artists emerged thereafter, for example, Tilahun Gessesse, Alemayehu Eshete, Bizunesh Bekele, Muluken Melesse and Mahmoud Ahmed. It also employed tradition style called *tizita*. During the Derg regime, these artists were prohibited to perform in the country and often forced into exile in North America and Europe, mixing with jazz and funk influences. For example, Roha Band, Walias Band, and Ethio Stars. By this time, Neway Debebe was critical of the Derg government.[321]\n\n\nModern music became developed shortly in the 1990s and 2000s. In this period, the most popular artists were Aster Aweke, Gigi and Teddy Afro. Ethiopian music further modernized in the next decade, employing electronic type and more popular. DJ Rophnan was renowned for pioneering EDM after releasing his debut album *Reflection* in 2018.[321]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of Ethiopia\n![](image)\nRuth Negga is an Ethiopian-born actress\n\nThe first cinema was introduced in 1898, three years after the first world film was projected. Cinematic artifacts ascribed by Italian minister Federico Ciccodicola\u00a0[it] which then offered to Emperor Menelik II. The early 20th century appearance with spectacle was around 1909 and embraced by documentary or biographical films. *Au de Menilek* was the first film directed by Charles Martel. The first 16mm black-and-white film dedicated to coronation of Emperor Zewditu, then coronation of Emperor Haile Selassie was filmed. The 1990s saw international booming of Ethiopian films. The most influential people in this era were Haile Gerima,\u00a0Salem Mekuria, Yemane Demissie, and\u00a0Teshome Gabriel. Films began modernized in the 2000s and implemented Amharic language. The most internationally grossed films are *Selanchi*, *Difret*, *Lamb*, *Prince of Love* and *Lambadina*. The modern era saw several reoccurring actors including Selam Tesfaye, Fryat Yemane, Hanan Tarik, Mahder Assefa, Amleset Muchie and Ruth Negga.\n\n\nOne of the most prestigious film award is Gumma Film Awards held in Addis Ababa. The award, which was started in 2014, broadcast on live television in some stations.[341] Festivals including Addis International Film Festival and the Ethiopian International Film Festival showcase amateur and professional filmmakers works; the latter being voted by judges. They were established in 2007[342] and 2005 respectively.[343]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Abebe Bikila, Ethiopia's first Olympic gold medalists\nThe main sports in Ethiopia are track and field (particularly long distance running) and football. Ethiopian athletes have won many Olympic gold medals in track and field, most of them in long distance running.[344] Abebe Bikila became the first athlete from a Sub-Saharan country to win an Olympic gold medal when he won the Marathon at the 1960 Rome Olympic Games in a world record time of 2:15:16.[345][346] Haile Gebrselassie, Kenenisa Bekele, and Tirunesh Dibaba are all world-renowned long distance runners, each with multiple Olympic and World Championship gold medals. Letesenbet Gidey holds the world records in both the women's 5,000 metre and 10,000 metre run. Other notable Ethiopian runners are Mamo Wolde, Miruts Yifter, Derartu Tulu, Meseret Defar, Birhane Adere, Tiki Gelana, Genzebe Dibaba, Tariku Bekele, Gelete Burka, and Yomif Kejelcha.\n\n\nAs of 2012[update] and going into 2013, the current national Ethiopian national football team (nicknamed the Walayia Antelopes) made history by qualifying for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations and reached the last 10 African football teams in the last stage of qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Noted players include captain Adane Girma and top scorer Saladin Said.\n\n\nEthiopia has Sub-Saharan Africa's longest basketball tradition as it established a national basketball team in 1949.\n\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Index of Ethiopia-related articles\n* Outline of Ethiopia\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Amharic: \u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb, romanized:\u00a0*\u012aty\u014d\u1e57\u1e57y\u0101* pronounced [i.tjo.p\u2019ja], Oromo: *Itiyoophiyaa*, Somali: *Itoobiya*, Tigrinya: \u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb, romanized:\u00a0*\u00cdtiyop'iya*, Afar: *Itiyoppiya*\n2. **^** It is also bordered to the northeast by the unrecognised state of Somaliland, which is recognised internationally as a *de jure* autonomous region of Somalia.\n3. **^** The inscriptions in Ancient Greek read \"\u0391\u03a7\u03a9\u039c\u0399\u03a4\u03a9 \u0392\u0391\u03a3\u0399\u039b\u0395\u03a5\u03a3\" (\"King of Axum\") and \"\u0395\u039d\u0394\u03a5\u0392\u0399\u03a3 \u0392\u0391\u03a3\u0399\u039b\u0395\u03a5\u03a3\" (\"King Endubis\"); Greek was the *lingua franca* by that time, so its use in coins simplified foreign trade.\n4. **^** \n\n\t* **Pro-federal government troops**\n\t\t+ Ethiopian federal government and regional allies\n\t\t+ Eritrean Defence Forces\n\t\t+ Ethiopian federal government and Eritrean Defence Forces\n\t* **Anti-federal government rebels**\n\t\t+ Oromo Liberation Army\n\t\t+ Fano (Amhara militia)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Ethiopia to Add 4 more Official Languages to Foster Unity\". *Ventures Africa*. 4 March 2020.

It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico.[11] Mexico covers 1,972,550\u00a0km2 (761,610 sq mi),[12] making it the world's 13th-largest country by area; with a population of almost 130 million, it is the 10th-most-populous country and has the most Spanish speakers.[13] Mexico is organized as a federal republic comprising 31 states and Mexico City, its capital.\n\n\nHuman presence in Pre-Columbian Mexico goes back to 8,000 BCE. It became one of the world's six cradles of civilization. The Mesoamerican region was home to many intertwined civilizations, including the Olmec, Maya, Zapotec, Teotihuacan, and Purepecha. The Aztecs dominated the region in the century before European contact. In 1521, the Spanish Empire and its indigenous allies conquered the Aztec Empire from its capital Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City), establishing the colony of New Spain.[14] Over the next three centuries, Spain and the Catholic Church expanded the territory, enforced Christianity and spread the Spanish language.[15] With the discovery of rich deposits of silver in Zacatecas and Guanajuato, New Spain became one of the most important mining centers worldwide. The colonial order came to an end in the early nineteenth century with the Mexican War of Independence.\n\n\nMexico's early history as an independent nation state was marked by political and socioeconomic upheaval, both domestically and in foreign affairs. The United States invaded as a consequence of the Texas Revolt by American settlers, which led to the Mexican\u2013American War and huge territorial losses in 1848.[16] After the introduction of liberal reforms in the Constitution of 1857, conservatives reacted with the War of Reform and prompted France to invade the country and install an Empire, against the Republican resistance led by liberal President Benito Ju\u00e1rez, which emerged victorious. The last decades of the 19th century were dominated by the dictatorship of Porfirio D\u00edaz, who sought to modernize Mexico and restore order.[17] However, the Porfiriato era led to great social unrest and ended with the outbreak in 1910 of the decade-long Mexican Revolution (civil war). This conflict led to profound changes, including the proclamation of the 1917 Constitution, which remains in effect to this day. The remaining war generals ruled as a succession of presidents until the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) emerged in 1929. The PRI governed Mexico for the next 70 years, first under a set of paternalistic developmental policies of considerable economic success. During World War II Mexico also played an important role for the Allied war effort.[18][19] Nonetheless, the PRI regime resorted to repression and electoral fraud to maintain power, and moved the country to a more US-aligned neoliberal economic policy during the late 20th century. This culminated with the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, which caused a major indigenous rebellion in the state of Chiapas. PRI lost the presidency for the first time in 2000, against the conservative party (PAN).\n\n\nMexico has the world's 15th-largest economy by nominal GDP and the 11th-largest by PPP, with the United States being its largest economic partner. As a newly industrialized[20] and developing country ranking 86th, high in the Human Development Index, its large economy and population, cultural influence, and steady democratization make Mexico a regional and middle power[21][22][23] which is also identified as an emerging power by several analysts.[24][25][26][27] Mexico ranks first in the Americas and seventh in the world for the number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[28] It is also one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries, ranking fifth in natural biodiversity.[29] Mexico's rich cultural and biological heritage, as well as varied climate and geography, makes it a major tourist destination: as of 2018, it was the sixth most-visited country in the world, with 39 million international arrivals.[30] However, the country continues to struggle with social inequality, poverty and extensive crime. It ranks poorly on the Global Peace Index,[31] due in large part to ongoing conflict between drug trafficking syndicates. This \"drug war\" has led to over 120,000 deaths since 2006.[32] Mexico is a member of United Nations, the G20, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the Organization of American States, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, and the Organization of Ibero-American States.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Name of Mexico\n\n*M\u0113xihco* is the Nahuatl term for the heartland of the Aztec Empire, namely the Valley of Mexico and surrounding territories, with its people being known as the Mexica. It is generally believed that the toponym for the valley was the origin of the primary ethnonym for the Aztec Triple Alliance, but it may have been the other way around.[33] In the colonial era (1521\u20131821) Mexico was called New Spain. In the eighteenth century, this central region became the Intendency of Mexico, during the reorganization of the empire, the Bourbon Reforms. After New Spain achieved independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821 and became a sovereign state, the territory came to be known as the State of Mexico, with the new country being named after its capital: Mexico City. The official name of the country has changed as the form of government has changed. The declaration of independence signed on 6 November 1813 by the deputies of the Congress of An\u00e1huac called the territory *Am\u00e9rica Septentrional* (Northern America); the 1821 Plan of Iguala also used Am\u00e9rica Septentrional. On two occasions (1821\u20131823 and 1863\u20131867), the country was known as *Imperio Mexicano* (Mexican Empire). All three federal constitutions (1824, 1857 and 1917, the current constitution) used the name *Estados Unidos Mexicanos*[34]\u2014or the variant *Estados-Unidos Mexicanos*,[35] all of which have been translated as \"United Mexican States\". The phrase *Rep\u00fablica Mexicana*, \"Mexican Republic\", was used in the 1836 Constitutional Laws.[36]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Mexico\n\nSee also: History of the Catholic Church in Mexico, Economic history of Mexico, History of democracy in Mexico, History of Mexico City, and Military history of Mexico\n\n### Indigenous civilizations before European contact (pre-1519)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Pre-Columbian Mexico and Mesoamerican chronology\n\n![](image)Teotihuacan, the 6th largest city in the world at its peak (1 AD to 500 AD)\n![](image)Temple of Kukulc\u00e1n (El Castillo) in the Maya city of Chichen Itza\n![](image)Artistic depiction of Mexico-Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital and largest city in the Americas at the time. The city was completely destroyed in the 1521 siege of Tenochtitlan and rebuilt as Mexico City.\nThe earliest human artifacts in Mexico are chips of stone tools found near campfire remains in the Valley of Mexico and radiocarbon-dated to circa 10,000 years ago.[37] Mexico is the site of the domestication of maize, tomato, and beans, which produced an agricultural surplus. This enabled the transition from paleo-Indian hunter-gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around 5000 BCE.[38]\nIn the subsequent formative eras, maize cultivation and cultural traits such as a mythological and religious complex, and a vigesimal (base 20) numeric system, were diffused from the Mexican cultures to the rest of the Mesoamerican culture area.[39] In this period, villages became more dense in terms of population, becoming socially stratified with an artisan class, and developing into chiefdoms. The most powerful rulers had religious and political power, organizing the construction of large ceremonial centers.[40]\n\n\nThe earliest complex civilization in Mexico was the Olmec culture, which flourished on the Gulf Coast from around 1500 BCE. Olmec cultural traits diffused through Mexico into other formative-era cultures in Chiapas, Oaxaca and the Valley of Mexico. The formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions, as well as artistic and architectural complexes.[41] The formative-era of Mesoamerica is considered one of the six independent cradles of civilization. In the subsequent pre-classical period, the Maya and Zapotec civilizations developed complex centers at Calakmul and Monte Alb\u00e1n, respectively. During this period the first true Mesoamerican writing systems were developed in the Epi-Olmec and Zapotec cultures. The Mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the Classic Maya Hieroglyphic script. The earliest written histories date from this era. The tradition of writing was important after the Spanish conquest in 1521, with indigenous scribes learning to write their languages in alphabetic letters, while also continuing to create pictorial texts.[42][43]\n\n\nIn Central Mexico, the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy of Teotihuac\u00e1n, which formed a military and commercial empire. Teotihuacan, with a population of more than 150,000 people, had some of the largest pyramidal structures in the pre-Columbian Americas.[44] After the collapse of Teotihuac\u00e1n around 600 AD, competition ensued between several important political centers in central Mexico such as Xochicalco and Cholula. At this time, during the Epi-Classic, Nahua peoples began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North, and became politically and culturally dominant in central Mexico, as they displaced speakers of Oto-Manguean languages. During the early post-classic era (ca. 1000\u20131519 CE), Central Mexico was dominated by the Toltec culture, Oaxaca by the Mixtec, and the lowland Maya area had important centers at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and Mayap\u00e1n. Toward the end of the post-Classic period, the Mexica established dominance, establishing a political and economic empire based in the city of Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City), extending from central Mexico to the border with Guatemala.[45] Alexander von Humboldt popularized the modern usage of \"Aztec\" as a collective term applied to all the people linked by trade, custom, religion, and language to the Mexica state and \u0112xc\u0101n Tlaht\u014dl\u014dy\u0101n, the Triple Alliance.[46] In 1843, with the publication of the work of William H. Prescott, it was adopted by most of the world. This usage has been the subject of debate since the late 20th century.[47]\n\n\n\n### Spanish conquest and colonial era (1519\u20131821)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Spanish conquest of Mexico and New Spain\n\n![](image)*Storming of the Teocalli by Cortez and his Troops* (painted in 1848)\nAlthough the Spanish Empire had established colonies in the Caribbean starting in 1493, only in the second decade of the sixteenth century did they begin exploring the east coast of Mexico. The Spanish first learned of Mexico during the Juan de Grijalva expedition of 1518. The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire began in February 1519 when Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s founded the Spanish city of Veracruz. The 1521 capture of Tenochtitlan and immediate founding of the Spanish capital Mexico City on its ruins was the beginning of a 300-year-long colonial era during which Mexico was known as *Nueva Espa\u00f1a* (New Spain). Two factors made Mexico a jewel in the Spanish Empire: the existence of large, hierarchically organized Mesoamerican populations that rendered tribute and performed obligatory labor and the discovery of vast silver deposits in northern Mexico.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Guanajuato was one of the richest and most opulent in New Spain\nThe Kingdom of New Spain was created from the remnants of the Aztec empire. The two pillars of Spanish rule were the State and the Roman Catholic Church, both under the authority of the Spanish crown. In 1493 the pope had granted sweeping powers to the Spanish monarchy for its overseas empire, with the proviso that the crown spread Christianity in its new realms. In 1524, King Charles I created the Council of the Indies based in Spain to oversee State power in its overseas territories; in New Spain the crown established a high court in Mexico City, the *Real Audiencia,* and then in 1535 created the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The viceroy was highest official of the State. In the religious sphere, the diocese of Mexico was created in 1530 and elevated to the Archdiocese of Mexico in 1546, with the archbishop as the head of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Castilian Spanish was the language of rulers. The Catholic faith was the only one permitted, with non-Catholics and Catholics (excluding Indians) holding unorthodox views being subject to the Mexican Inquisition, established in 1571.[49]\n\n\n\n![](image)New Spain after the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty of 1819 (not including the island territories of the Pacific Ocean)\nSpanish military forces, sometimes accompanied by native allies, led expeditions to conquer territory or quell rebellions through the colonial era. Notable Amerindian revolts in sporadically populated northern New Spain include the Chichimeca War (1576\u20131606),[50] Tepehu\u00e1n Revolt (1616\u20131620),[51] and the Pueblo Revolt (1680), the Tzeltal Rebellion of 1712 was a regional Maya revolt.[52] Most rebellions were small-scale and local, posing no major threat to the ruling elites.[53] To protect Mexico from the attacks of English, French, and Dutch pirates and protect the Crown's monopoly of revenue, only two ports were open to foreign trade\u2014Veracruz on the Atlantic (Connecting to Spain) and Acapulco on the Pacific (Connecting to the Philippines). Among the best-known pirate attacks are the 1663 Sack of Campeche[54] and 1683 Attack on Veracruz.[55] Of greater concern to the crown was of foreign invasion, especially after Britain seized in 1762 the Spanish ports of Havana, Cuba and Manila in the Seven Years' War. It created a standing military, increased coastal fortifications, and expanded the northern presidios and missions into Alta California. The volatility of the urban poor in Mexico City was evident in the 1692 riot in the Z\u00f3calo. The riot over the price of maize escalated to a full-scale attack on the seats of power, with the viceregal palace and the archbishop's residence attacked by the mob.[56]\n\n\n\n### Independence era (1808\u20131855)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mexican War of Independence, First Mexican Empire, First Mexican Republic, Centralist Republic of Mexico, and Mexican\u2013American War\n\n![](image)Capture of Alh\u00f3ndiga de Granaditas by Hidalgo's army. Guanajuato, 28 September 1810\nThe upheaval in the Spanish Empire that resulted in the independence of most of its New World territories was due to Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of Spain in 1808. In Mexico, elites argued that sovereignty now reverted to \"the people\" and that town councils (*cabildos*) were the most representative bodies.[57] On 16 September 1810, secular priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla declared against \"bad government\" in the small town of Dolores, Guanajuato. This event, known as the Cry of Dolores (Spanish: *Grito de Dolores*) is commemorated each year, on 16 September, as Mexico's independence day.[58] Hidalgo and some of his soldiers were eventually captured, Hidalgo was defrocked, and they were executed by firing squad on 31 July 1811.\n\n\n\n![](image)Cry of Dolores by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, 16 September 1810\n![](image)Entry of the Army of the Three Guarantees to Mexico City on 27 September 1821\nThe first 35 years after Mexico's independence were marked by political instability and the changing of the Mexican state from a transient monarchy to a fragile federated republic.[59] There were military coups d'\u00e9tat, foreign invasions, ideological conflict between Conservatives and Liberals, and economic stagnation. Catholicism remained the only permitted religious faith and the Catholic Church as an institution retained its special privileges, prestige, and property, a bulwark of Conservatism. The army, another Conservative-dominated institution, also retained its privileges. Former Royal Army General Agust\u00edn de Iturbide became regent, as newly independent Mexico sought a constitutional monarch from Europe. When no member of a European royal house desired the position, Iturbide himself was declared Emperor Agust\u00edn I. The young and weak United States was the first country to recognize Mexico's independence, sending an ambassador to the court and sending a message to Europe via the Monroe Doctrine not to intervene in Mexico. The emperor's rule was short (1822\u20131823) and he was overthrown by army officers in the Plan of Casa Mata.[60]\n\n\nAfter the forced abdication of the monarch, Central America and Chiapas left the union to form the Federal Republic of Central America. In 1824, a constitution of a federated republic was promulgated and the First Mexican Republic was established. Former insurgent General Guadalupe Victoria became the first president of the republic \u2014 the first of many army generals to hold the presidency.\n\n\nIn 1829, former insurgent general and fierce Liberal Vicente Guerrero, a signatory of the Plan of Iguala that achieved independence, became president in a disputed election. During his short term in office, April to December 1829, he abolished slavery. As a visibly mixed-race man of modest origins, Guerrero was seen by white political elites as an interloper.[61] His Conservative vice president, former Royalist General Anastasio Bustamante, led a coup against him and Guerrero was judicially murdered.[62] There was constant strife between the Liberals (also known as Federalists), who were supporters of a federal form of decentralized government, and their political rivals, the Conservatives (also known as Centralists), who proposed a hierarchical form of government.\n\n\nMexico's ability to maintain its independence and establish a viable government was in question. Spain attempted to reconquer its former colony during the 1820s, but eventually recognized its independence. France attempted to recoup losses it claimed for its citizens during Mexico's unrest and blockaded the Gulf Coast during the so-called Pastry War of 1838\u20131839.[63] General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna emerged as a national hero because of his role in both these conflicts; Santa Anna came to dominate the politics for the next 25 years, often known as the \"Age of Santa Anna\", until his own overthrow in 1855.[64]\n\n\n\n![](image)Battle of El \u00c1lamo (1836), between the Mexican army led by President Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna and American slavers.\nMexico also contended with indigenous groups which controlled territory that Mexico claimed in the north. For example, the Comanche controlled a huge territory in sparsely populated central and northern Texas.[65] Wanting to stabilize and develop that area \u2014 and as few people from central Mexico had chosen to resettle to this remote and hostile territory \u2014 the Mexican government encouraged Anglo-American immigration into present-day Texas, a region that bordered that United States. Mexico by law was a Catholic country; the Anglo-Americans were primarily Protestant English speakers from the southern United States. Some brought their black slaves, which after 1829 was contrary to Mexican law. In 1835, Santa Anna sought to centralize government rule in Mexico, suspending the 1824 constitution and promulgating the Seven Laws, which placed power in his hands. As a result, civil war spread across the country. Three new governments declared independence: the Republic of Texas, the Republic of the Rio Grande and the Republic of Yucat\u00e1n.[66]:\u200a129\u2013137 The largest blow to Mexico was the U.S. invasion of Mexico in 1846 in the Mexican\u2013American War. Mexico lost much of its sparsely populated northern territory, sealed in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Despite that disastrous loss, Santa Anna returned to the presidency yet again before being ousted and exiled in the Liberal Revolution of Ayutla.\n\n\n\n### Liberal era (1855\u20131911)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Second Mexican Republic, La Reforma, Second Mexican Empire, Restored Republic (Mexico), and Porfiriato\n\n![](image)Portrait of Liberal President Benito Ju\u00e1rez\nThe overthrow of Santa Anna and the establishment of a civilian government by Liberals allowed them to enact laws that they considered vital for Mexico's economic development. The Liberal Reform attempted to modernize Mexico's economy and institutions along liberal principles. They promulgated a new Constitution of 1857, separating Church and State, stripping the Church and the military of their special privileges (*fueros*); mandating the sale of Church-owned property and sale of indigenous community lands, and secularizing education.[67] Conservatives revolted, touching off civil war between rival Liberal and Conservative governments (1858\u20131861).\n\n\nThe Liberals defeated the Conservative army on the battlefield, but Conservatives sought another solution to gain power via foreign intervention by the French. Mexican conservatives asked Emperor Napoleon III to place a European monarch as head of state in Mexico. The French Army defeated the Mexican Army and placed Maximilian Hapsburg on the newly established throne of Mexico, supported by Mexican Conservatives and propped up by the French Army. The Liberal republic under Benito Ju\u00e1rez was basically a government in internal exile, but with the end of the Civil War in the U.S. in April 1865, that government began aiding the Mexican Republic. Two years later, the French Army withdrew its support, but Maximilian remained in Mexico. Republican forces captured him and he was executed. The \"Restored Republic\" saw the return of Ju\u00e1rez, \"the personification of the embattled republic,\"[68] as president.\n\n\nThe Conservatives had been not only defeated militarily, but also discredited politically for their collaboration with the French invaders. Liberalism became synonymous with patriotism.[69] The Mexican Army that had its roots in the colonial royal army and then the army of the early republic was destroyed. New military leaders had emerged from the War of the Reform and the conflict with the French, most notably Porfirio D\u00edaz, a hero of the Cinco de Mayo, who now sought civilian power. Ju\u00e1rez won re-election in 1867, but was challenged by D\u00edaz. D\u00edaz then rebelled, crushed by Ju\u00e1rez. Having won re-election, Ju\u00e1rez died in office in July 1872, and Liberal Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada became president, declaring a \"religion of state\" for rule of law, peace, and order. When Lerdo ran for re-election, D\u00edaz rebelled against the civilian president, issuing the Plan of Tuxtepec. D\u00edaz had more support and waged guerrilla warfare against Lerdo. On the verge of D\u00edaz's victory on the battlefield, Lerdo fled from office into exile.[70]\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Execution of Emperor Maximilian*, 19 June 1867. Gen. Tom\u00e1s Mej\u00eda, left; Maximiian, center; Gen. Miguel Miram\u00f3n, right. Painting by \u00c9douard Manet 1868.\nAfter the turmoil in Mexico from 1810 to 1876, the 35-year rule of Liberal General Porfirio D\u00edaz (r.1876\u20131911) allowed Mexico to rapidly modernize in a period characterized as one of \"order and progress\". The Porfiriato was characterized by economic stability and growth, significant foreign investment and influence, an expansion of the railroad network and telecommunications, and investments in the arts and sciences.[71]\n\n\nD\u00edaz ruled with a group of advisors that became known as the *cient\u00edficos* (\"scientists\").[72] The most influential *cient\u00edfico* was Secretary of Finance Jos\u00e9 Yves Limantour.[73] The Porfirian regime was influenced by positivism.[74] They rejected theology and idealism in favor of scientific methods being applied towards national development. An integral aspect of the liberal project was secular education. The D\u00edaz government led a protracted conflict against the Yaqui that culminated with the forced relocation of thousands of Yaqui to Yucat\u00e1n and Oaxaca. As the centennial of independence approached, D\u00edaz gave an interview where he said he was not going to run in the 1910 elections, when he would be 80. Political opposition had been suppressed and there were few avenues for a new generation of leaders. But his announcement set off a frenzy of political activity, including the unlikely candidacy of the scion of a rich landowning family, Francisco I. Madero. Madero won a surprising amount of political support when D\u00edaz changed his mind and ran in the election, jailing Madero. The September centennial celebration of independence was the last celebration of the Porfiriato. The Mexican Revolution starting in 1910 saw a decade of civil war, the \"wind that swept Mexico.\"[75]\n\n\n\n### Mexican Revolution (1910\u20131920)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mexican Revolution\n\n![](image)Francisco I. Madero, who challenged D\u00edaz in the fraudulent 1910 election and was elected president when D\u00edaz was forced to resign in May 1911\nThe Mexican Revolution was a decade-long transformational conflict.[76] It began with scattered uprisings against President D\u00edaz after the fraudulent 1910 election, his resignation in May 1911, demobilization of rebel forces and an interim presidency of a member of the old guard, and the democratic election of a rich, civilian landowner, Francisco I. Madero in fall 1911. In February 1913, a military coup d'\u00e9tat overthrew Madero's government, with the support of the U.S., resulting in Madero's murder by agents of Federal Army General Victoriano Huerta. A coalition of anti-Huerta forces in the North, the Constitutional Army led by Governor of Coahuila Venustiano Carranza, and a peasant army in the South under Emiliano Zapata defeated the Federal Army.[77]\n\n\nIn 1914, that army was dissolved as an institution, leaving only revolutionary forces. Following the revolutionaries' victory against Huerta, they sought to broker a peaceful political solution, but the coalition splintered, plunging Mexico again into a civil war. Constitutionalist general Pancho Villa, commander of the Division of the North, broke with Carranza and allied with Zapata. Carranza's best general Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n defeated Villa, his former comrade-in-arms in the Battle of Celaya in 1915, and Villa's northern forces melted away. Zapata's forces in the south reverted to guerrilla warfare. Carranza became the de facto head of Mexico, and the U.S. recognized his government.[77]\n\n\nIn 1916, the winners met at a constitutional convention to draft the Constitution of 1917, which was ratified in February 1917. The Constitution empowered the government to expropriate resources including land, gave rights to labor, and strengthened anticlerical provisions of the 1857 Constitution.[77] With amendments, it remains the governing document of Mexico. It is estimated that the war killed 900,000 of the 1910 population of 15 million.[78][79] Although often viewed as an internal conflict, the revolution had significant international elements.[80] During the Revolution, the U.S. Republican administration of Taft supported the Huerta coup against Madero, but when Democrat Woodrow Wilson was inaugurated as president in March 1913, Wilson refused to recognize Huerta's regime and allowed arms sales to the Constitutionalists. Wilson ordered troops to occupy the strategic port of Veracruz in 1914, which was lifted.[81]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tom\u00e1s Urbina, Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata in the National Palace during the Mexican Revolution, 1914\nAfter Pancho Villa was defeated by revolutionary forces in 1915, he led an incursion raid into Columbus, New Mexico, prompting the U.S. to send 10,000 troops led by General John J. Pershing in an unsuccessful attempt to capture Villa. Carranza pushed back against U.S. troops being in northern Mexico. The expeditionary forces withdrew as the U.S. entered World War I.[82] Germany attempted to get Mexico to side with it, sending a coded telegram in 1917 to incite war between the U.S. and Mexico, with Mexico to regain the territory it lost in the Mexican-American War.[83] Mexico remained neutral in the conflict.\n\n\nConsolidating power, President Carranza had peasant-leader Emiliano Zapata assassinated in 1919. Carranza had gained support of the peasantry during the Revolution, but once in power he did little to institute land reform, which had motivated many to fight in the Revolution. Carranza in fact returned some confiscated land to their original owners. President Carranza's best general, Obreg\u00f3n, served briefly in his administration, but returned to his home state of Sonora to position himself to run in the 1920 presidential election. Since Carranza could not run for re-election, he chose a civilian, political and revolutionary no-body to succeed him, intending to remain the power behind the presidency. Obreg\u00f3n and two other Sonoran revolutionary generals drew up the Plan of Agua Prieta, overthrowing Carranza, who died fleeing Mexico City in 1920. General Adolfo de la Huerta became interim president, followed by the election of General \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n.\n\n\n\n### Political consolidation and one-party rule (1920\u20132000)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Institutional Revolutionary Party\n\n![](image)Logo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, that was founded in 1929 and held uninterrupted power in the country for 71 years, from 1929 to 2000\nThe first quarter-century of the post-revolutionary period (1920\u20131946) was characterized by revolutionary generals serving as Presidents of Mexico, including \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n (1920\u201324), Plutarco El\u00edas Calles (1924\u201328), L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas (1934\u201340), and Manuel Avila Camacho (1940\u201346). The post-revolutionary project of the Mexican government sought to bring order to the country, end military intervention in politics, and create organizations of interest groups. Workers, peasants, urban office workers, and even the army for a short period were incorporated as sectors of the single party that dominated Mexican politics from its founding in 1929. Obreg\u00f3n instigated land reform and strengthened the power of organized labor. He gained recognition from the United States and took steps to settle claims with companies and individuals that lost property during the Revolution. He imposed his fellow former Sonoran revolutionary general, Calles, as his successor, prompting an unsuccessful military revolt. As president, Calles provoked a major conflict with the Catholic Church and Catholic guerrilla armies when he strictly enforced anticlerical articles of the 1917 Constitution. The Church-State conflict was mediated and ended with the aid of the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico and ended with an agreement between the parties in conflict. Although the constitution prohibited reelection of the president, Obreg\u00f3n wished to run again and the constitution was amended to allow non-consecutive re-election. Obreg\u00f3n won the 1928 elections, but was assassinated by a Catholic zealot, causing a political crisis of succession. Calles could not become president again, since he had just ended his term. He sought to set up a structure to manage presidential succession, founding the party that was to dominate Mexico until the late twentieth century. Calles declared that the Revolution had moved from *caudillismo* (rule by strongmen) to the *era institucional* (institutional era).[84]\n\n\nDespite not holding the presidency, Calles remained the key political figure during the period known as the Maximato (1929\u20131934). The Maximato ended during the presidency of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, who expelled Calles from the country and implemented many economic and social reforms. This included the Mexican oil expropriation in March 1938, which nationalized the U.S. and Anglo-Dutch oil company known as the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company. This movement would result in the creation of the state-owned Mexican oil company Pemex. This sparked a diplomatic crisis with the countries whose citizens had lost businesses by C\u00e1rdenas's radical measure, but since then the company has played an important role in the economic development of Mexico. C\u00e1rdenas's successor, Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho (1940\u20131946) was more moderate, and relations between the U.S. and Mexico vastly improved during World War II, when Mexico was a significant ally, providing manpower and materiel to aid the war effort. From 1946 the election of Miguel Alem\u00e1n, the first civilian president in the post-revolutionary period, Mexico embarked on an aggressive program of economic development, known as the Mexican miracle, which was characterized by industrialization, urbanization, and the increase of inequality in Mexico between urban and rural areas.[85]\n\n\n\n![](image)Armored cars in the Z\u00f3calo during the protests of 1968\nWith robust economic growth, Mexico sought to showcase it to the world by hosting the 1968 Summer Olympics. The government poured huge resources into building new facilities, prompting political unrest by university students and others. Demonstrations in central Mexico City went on for weeks before the planned opening of the games, with the government of Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz cracking down. The culmination was the Tlatelolco Massacre,[86] which killed around 300 protesters based on conservative estimates and perhaps as many as 800.[87] Although the economy continued to flourish for some, social inequality remained a factor of discontent. PRI rule became increasingly authoritarian and at times oppressive in what is now referred to as the Mexican Dirty War.[88]\n\n\nLuis Echeverr\u00eda was elected president in 1970. His government had to contend with mistrust of Mexicans and increasing economic problems. He instituted electoral reforms.[89][90]\n\n\n\n![](image)NAFTA signing ceremony, October 1992. From left to right: (standing) President Carlos Salinas de Gortari (Mexico), President George H. W. Bush (U.S.), and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney (Canada).\nIn the 1980s the first cracks emerged in the PRI's complete political dominance. In Baja California, the PAN candidate was elected as governor. When De la Madrid chose Carlos Salinas de Gortari as the candidate for the PRI, and therefore a foregone presidential victor, Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas, son of former President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, broke with the PRI and challenged Salinas in the 1988 elections. In 1988 there was massive electoral fraud, with results showing that Salinas had won the election by the narrowest percentage ever. There were massive protests in Mexico City to the stolen election. Salinas took the oath of office on 1 December 1988.[91] In 1990 the PRI was famously described by Mario Vargas Llosa as the \"perfect dictatorship\", but by then there had been major challenges to the PRI's hegemony.[92][93][94]\n\n\nSalinas embarked on a program of neoliberal reforms that fixed the exchange rate of the peso, controlled inflation, opened Mexico to foreign investment, and began talks with the U.S. and Canada to join their free-trade agreement. In order to do that, the Constitution of 1917 was amended in several important ways. Article 27, which had allowed the government to expropriate natural resources and distribute land, was amended to end agrarian reform and to guarantee private owners' property rights. The anti-clerical articles that muzzled religious institutions, especially the Catholic Church, were amended and Mexico reestablished diplomatic relations with the Holy See. Signing on to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) removed Mexico's autonomy over trade policy. The agreement came into effect on 1 January 1994; the same day, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) in Chiapas began armed peasant rebellion against the federal government, which captured a few towns, but brought world attention to the situation in Mexico. The armed conflict was short-lived and has continued as a non-violent opposition movement against neoliberalism and globalization. In 1994, following the assassination of the PRI's presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, Salinas was succeeded by victorious PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo. Salinas left Zedillo's government to deal with the Mexican peso crisis, requiring a $50 billion IMF bailout. Major macroeconomic reforms were started by Zedillo, and the economy rapidly recovered and growth peaked at almost 7% by the end of 1999.[95]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary Mexico[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vicente Fox won the 2000 general election and became the first president not from the PRI since 1929, and the first elected from an opposition party since Francisco I. Madero in 1911.\nIn 2000, after 71 years, the PRI lost a presidential election to Vicente Fox of the opposition conservative National Action Party (PAN). In the 2006 presidential election, Felipe Calder\u00f3n from the PAN was declared the winner, with a very narrow margin (0.58%) over leftist politician Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD).[96] L\u00f3pez Obrador, however, contested the election and pledged to create an \"alternative government\".[97]\n\n\nAfter twelve years, in 2012, the PRI won the presidency again with the election of Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. However, he won with a plurality of about 38%, and did not have a legislative majority.[98]\n\n\nAfter founding the new political party MORENA, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador won the 2018 presidential election with over 50% of the vote. His political coalition, led by his left-wing party founded after the 2012 elections, included parties and politicians from all over the political spectrum. The coalition also won a majority in both the upper and lower congress chambers. His success is attributed to the country's other strong political alternatives exhausting their chances as well as the politician adopting a moderate discourse with a focus on conciliation.[99]\n\n\nMexico has contended with high crime rates, official corruption, narcotrafficking, and a stagnant economy. Many state-owned industrial enterprises were privatized starting in the 1990s, with neoliberal reforms, but Pemex, the state-owned petroleum company is only slowly being privatized, with exploration licenses being issued.[100] In a push against government corruption, the ex-CEO of Pemex has been arrested.[101]\n\n\nAlthough there were fears of electoral fraud in Mexico's 2018 presidential elections,[102] the results gave a mandate to AMLO.[103] Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador won a landslide victory in the July 2018 presidential elections and became the first leftwing president for decades.[104]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Mexico\n\n![](image)Topographic map of Mexico\n![](image)Pico de Orizaba, the highest mountain in Mexico\nMexico is located between latitudes 14\u00b0 and 33\u00b0N, and longitudes 86\u00b0 and 119\u00b0W in the southern portion of North America. Almost all of Mexico lies in the North American Plate, with small parts of the Baja California peninsula on the Pacific and Cocos Plates. Geophysically, some geographers include the territory east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (around 12% of the total) within Central America.[105] Geopolitically, however, Mexico is entirely considered part of North America, along with Canada and the United States.[106]\n\n\nMexico's total area is 1,972,550\u00a0km2 (761,606\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), making it the world's 13th largest country by total area. It has coastlines on the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of California, as well as the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, the latter two forming part of the Atlantic Ocean.[107] Within these seas are about 6,000\u00a0km2 (2,317\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of islands (including the remote Pacific Guadalupe Island and the Revillagigedo Islands). From its farthest land points, Mexico is a little over 2,000\u00a0mi (3,219\u00a0km) in length. Mexico has nine distinct regions: Baja California, the Pacific Coastal Lowlands, the Mexican Plateau, the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Sierra Madre Occidental, the Cordillera Neo-Volc\u00e1nica, the Gulf Coastal Plain, the Southern Highlands, and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.[108] Although Mexico is large, much of its land mass is incompatible with agriculture due to aridity, soil, or terrain. In 2018, an estimated 54.9% of land is agricultural; 11.8% is arable; 1.4% is in permanent crops; 41.7% is permanent pasture; and 33.3% is forest.[109]\n\n\nMexico is crossed from north to south by two mountain ranges known as Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre Occidental, which are the extension of the Rocky Mountains from northern North America. From east to west at the center, the country is crossed by the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt also known as the Sierra Nevada. A fourth mountain range, the Sierra Madre del Sur, runs from Michoac\u00e1n to Oaxaca. As such, the majority of the Mexican central and northern territories are located at high altitudes, and the highest elevations are found at the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt: Pico de Orizaba (5,700\u00a0m or 18,701\u00a0ft), Popocat\u00e9petl (5,462\u00a0m or 17,920\u00a0ft) and Iztaccihuatl (5,286\u00a0m or 17,343\u00a0ft) and the Nevado de Toluca (4,577\u00a0m or 15,016\u00a0ft). Three major urban agglomerations are located in the valleys between these four elevations: Toluca, Greater Mexico City and Puebla.[*citation needed*] An important geologic feature of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula is the Chicxulub crater. The scientific consensus is that the Chicxulub impactor was responsible for the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event. Mexico is subject to a number of natural hazards, including hurricanes on both coasts, tsunamis on the Pacific coast, and volcanism.[110]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Mexico\n\n![](image)Mexico map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification\nThe climate of Mexico is quite varied due to the country's size and topography. Tropic of Cancer effectively divides the country into temperate and tropical zones. Land north of the Tropic of Cancer experiences cooler temperatures during the winter months. South of the Tropic of Cancer, temperatures are fairly constant year-round and vary solely as a function of elevation. This gives Mexico one of the world's most diverse weather systems. Maritime air masses bring seasonal precipitation from May until August. Many parts of Mexico, particularly the north, have a dry climate with only sporadic rainfall, while parts of the tropical lowlands in the south average more than 2,000\u00a0mm (78.7\u00a0in) of annual precipitation. For example, many cities in the north like Monterrey, Hermosillo, and Mexicali experience temperatures of 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) or more in summer. In the Sonoran Desert temperatures reach 50\u00a0\u00b0C (122\u00a0\u00b0F) or more.[111]\n\n\nDescriptors of regions are by temperature, with the *tierra caliente* (hot land) being coastal up to 900 meters; *tierra templada* (temperate land) being from 1,800 meters; *tierra fr\u00eda* (cold land) extending to 3,500 meters. Beyond the cold lands are the *p\u00e1ramos*, alpine pastures, and the *tierra helada* (frozen land) (4,000-4,200 meters) in central Mexico. Areas south of the Tropic of Cancer with elevations up to 1,000\u00a0m (3,281\u00a0ft) (the southern parts of both coastal plains as well as the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula), have a yearly median temperature between 24 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (75.2 to 82.4\u00a0\u00b0F). Temperatures here remain high throughout the year, with only a 5\u00a0\u00b0C (9\u00a0\u00b0F) difference between winter and summer median temperatures. Both Mexican coasts, except for the south coast of the Bay of Campeche and northern Baja California, are also vulnerable to serious hurricanes during the summer and fall. Although low-lying areas north of the Tropic of Cancer are hot and humid during the summer, they generally have lower yearly temperature averages (from 20 to 24\u00a0\u00b0C or 68.0 to 75.2\u00a0\u00b0F) because of more moderate conditions during the winter.[111]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mexican wolf\nMexico ranks fourth[112] in the world in biodiversity and is one of the 17 megadiverse countries. With over 200,000 different species, Mexico is home of 10\u201312% of the world's biodiversity.[113] Mexico ranks first in biodiversity in reptiles with 707 known species, second in mammals with 438 species, fourth in amphibians with 290 species, and fourth in flora, with 26,000 different species.[114] Mexico is also considered the second country in the world in ecosystems and fourth in overall species.[115] About 2,500 species are protected by Mexican legislation.[115] In 2002[update], Mexico had the second fastest rate of deforestation in the world, second only to Brazil.[116] It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.82/10, ranking it 63rd globally out of 172 countries.[117]\n\n\nIn Mexico, 170,000 square kilometers (65,637\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) are considered \"Protected Natural Areas\". These include 34 biosphere reserves (unaltered ecosystems), 67 national parks, 4 natural monuments (protected in perpetuity for their aesthetic, scientific or historical value), 26 areas of protected flora and fauna, 4 areas for natural resource protection (conservation of soil, hydrological basins and forests) and 17 sanctuaries (zones rich in diverse species).[113] Plants indigenous to Mexico are grown in many parts of the world and integrated into their own national cuisines. Some of Mexico's native culinary ingredients include: maize, tomato, beans, squash, chocolate, vanilla, avocado, guava, chayote, epazote, camote, j\u00edcama, nopal, zucchini, tejocote, huitlacoche, sapote, mamey sapote, and a great variety of chiles, such as the habanero and the jalape\u00f1o. Most of these names come from the indigenous language of Nahuatl. Tequila, the distilled alcoholic drink made from cultivated agave cacti is a major industry. Because of its high biodiversity Mexico has also been a frequent site of bioprospecting by international research bodies.[118] The first highly successful instance being the discovery in 1947 of the tuber \"Barbasco\" (*Dioscorea composita*) which has a high content of diosgenin, revolutionizing the production of synthetic hormones in the 1950s and 1960s and eventually leading to the invention of combined oral contraceptive pills.[119]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Mexico and Federal government of Mexico\n\n![](image)The National Palace on the east side of Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n or *Z\u00f3calo*, the main square of Mexico City; it was the residence of viceroys and Presidents of Mexico and now the seat of the Mexican government.\n![](image)Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Congress of Mexico\nThe United Mexican States are a federation whose government is representative, democratic and republican based on a presidential system according to the 1917 Constitution. The constitution establishes three levels of government: the federal Union, the state governments and the municipal governments.\n\n\nThe federal legislature is the bicameral Congress of the Union, composed of the Senate of the Republic and the Chamber of Deputies. The Congress makes federal law, declares war, imposes taxes, approves the national budget and international treaties, and ratifies diplomatic appointments.[120] The federal Congress, as well as the state legislatures, are elected by a system of parallel voting that includes plurality and proportional representation.[121] The Chamber of Deputies has 500 deputies. Of these, 300 are elected by plurality vote in single-member districts (the federal electoral districts) and 200 are elected by proportional representation with closed party lists[122] for which the country is divided into five electoral constituencies.[123] The Senate comprises 128 senators: 64 (two for each state and two for Mexico City) are elected by plurality vote in pairs, 32 are the first minority or first-runner-up (one for each state and one for Mexico City), and 32 are elected by proportional representation from national closed party lists.[122]\n\n\nThe executive is the President of the United Mexican States, who is the head of state and government, as well as the commander-in-chief of the Mexican military forces. The President also appoints the Cabinet and other officers. The President is responsible for executing and enforcing the law, and has the power to veto bills.[124]\n\n\nThe highest organ of the judicial branch of government is the Supreme Court of Justice, the national supreme court, which has eleven judges appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. The Supreme Court of Justice interprets laws and judges cases of federal competency. Other institutions of the judiciary are the Federal Electoral Tribunal, collegiate, unitary and district tribunals, and the Council of the Federal Judiciary.[125]\n\n\nThree parties have historically been the dominant parties in Mexican politics: the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), a catch-all party[126] and member of the Socialist International[127] that was founded in 1929 to unite all the factions of the Mexican Revolution and held an almost hegemonic power in Mexican politics since then; the National Action Party (PAN), a conservative party founded in 1939 and belonging to the Christian Democrat Organization of America;[128] and the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) a left-wing party,[129] founded in 1989 as the successor of the coalition of socialists and liberal parties.\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Mexico\n\n![](image)Headquarters of the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs\nThe foreign relations of Mexico are directed by the President of Mexico[130] and managed through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.[131] The principles of the foreign policy are constitutionally recognized in the Article 89, Section 10, which include: respect for international law and legal equality of states, their sovereignty and independence, trend to non-interventionism in the domestic affairs of other countries, peaceful resolution of conflicts, and promotion of collective security through active participation in international organizations.[130] Since the 1930s, the Estrada Doctrine has served as a crucial complement to these principles.[132]\n\n\nMexico is founding member of several international organizations, most notably the United Nations,[133] the Organization of American States,[134] the Organization of Ibero-American States,[135] the OPANAL[136] and the CELAC.[137] In 2008, Mexico contributed over 40 million dollars to the United Nations regular budget.[138] In addition, it was the only Latin American member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development since it joined in 1994 until Chile gained full membership in 2010.[139][140]\n\n\nMexico is considered a regional power[141][142] hence its presence in major economic groups such as the G8+5 and the G-20. Since the 1990s Mexico has sought a reform of the United Nations Security Council and its working methods[143] with the support of Canada, Italy, Pakistan and other nine countries, which form a group informally called the Coffee Club.[144]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mexican Armed Forces and Military history of Mexico\n\n![](image)Three *Allende*-class frigate in Tuxpan\n![](image)Mexican Air Force F-5 Tiger II\nThe Mexican Armed Forces are administered by the Secretariat of National Defense (*Secretaria de Defensa Nacional*, SEDENA). There are two branches: the Mexican Army (which includes the Mexican Air Force), and the Mexican Navy. The Secretariat of Public Security and Civil Protection has jurisdiction over the National Guard, which was formed in 2019 from the disbanded Federal Police and military police of the Army and Navy. Figures vary on personnel, but as of are approximately 223,000 armed forces personnel (160,000 Army; 8,000 Air Force; 55,000 Navy, including about 20,000 marines); approximately 100,000 National Guard (2021). Government expenditures on the military are a small proportion of GDP: 0.7% of GDP (2021 est.), 0.6% of GDP (2020).[145]\n\n\nThe Mexican Armed Forces maintain significant infrastructure, including facilities for design, research, and testing of weapons, vehicles, aircraft, naval vessels, defense systems and electronics; military industry manufacturing centers for building such systems, and advanced naval dockyards that build heavy military vessels and advanced missile technologies. Since the 1990s, when the military escalated its role in the war on drugs, increasing importance has been placed on acquiring airborne surveillance platforms, aircraft, helicopters, digital war-fighting technologies,[146] urban warfare equipment and rapid troop transport.[147] Mexico has the capabilities to manufacture nuclear weapons, but abandoned this possibility with the Treaty of Tlatelolco in 1968 and pledged to only use its nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.[148] Mexico signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[149]\n\n\nHistorically, Mexico has remained neutral in international conflicts,[150] with the exception of World War II. However, in recent years some political parties have proposed an amendment of the Constitution to allow the Mexican Army, Air Force or Navy to collaborate with the United Nations in peacekeeping missions, or to provide military help to countries that officially ask for it.[151]\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement and human rights[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law enforcement in Mexico and Crime in Mexico\n\nFurther information: Mexican Drug War, Human trafficking in Mexico, and Femicide in Mexico\n\n![](image)Mexican Federal Police celebration\n![](image)Demonstration on 26 September 2015, in the first anniversary of the disappearance of the 43 students in the Mexican town of Iguala\nThe Mexican Federal Police were dissolved in 2019 by a constitutional amendment during the administration of President L\u00f3pez Obrador and the Mexican National Guard established, amalgamating units of the Federal Police, Military Police, and Naval Police.[152] As of 2022, the National Guard is an estimated at 110,000. L\u00f3pez Obrador has increasingly used military forces for domestic law enforcement, particularly against drug cartels.[153] There have been serious abuses of power reported in security operations in the southern part of the country and in indigenous communities and poor urban neighborhoods. The National Human Rights Commission has had little impact in reversing this trend, engaging mostly in documentation but failing to use its powers to issue public condemnations to the officials who ignore its recommendations.[154] Most Mexicans have low confidence in the police or the judicial system, and therefore, few crimes are actually reported by the citizens.[155] There have been public demonstrations of outrage against what is considered a culture of impunity.[156]\n\n\nMexico has fully recognised same-sex marriage since 2022,[157] and anti-discrimination laws regarding sexual orientation have existed in the nation since 2003.[158] However, hate crimes towards the LGBT community remain an issue in Mexico.[159][160] Other crime and human rights violations in Mexico have been criticized, including enforced disappearances (kidnappings), abuses against migrants, extrajudicial killings, gender-based violence, especially femicide, and attacks on journalists and human rights advocates.[161] A 2020 report by the BBC gives statistics on crime in Mexico, with 10.7 million households with at least one victim of crime.[162] \nAs of May 2022, 100,000 people are officially listed as missing, most since 2007 when President Calder\u00f3n attempted to stop the drug cartels.[163] Drug cartels remain a major issue in Mexico, with a proliferation of smaller cartels when larger ones are broken up and increasingly the use of more sophisticated military equipment and tactics.[164][165]\n\n\nMexico's drug war, ongoing since 2006, has left over 120,000 dead and perhaps another 37,000 missing.[32] Mexico's National Geography and Statistics Institute estimated that in 2014, one-fifth of Mexicans were victims of some sort of crime.[166] The mass kidnapping of 43 students in Iguala on 26 September 2014 triggered nationwide protests against the government's weak response to the disappearances and widespread corruption that gives free rein to criminal organizations.[167] More than 100 journalists and media workers have been killed or disappeared since 2000, and most of these crimes remained unsolved, improperly investigated, and with few perpetrators arrested and convicted.[168][169]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of Mexico\n\nFurther information: States of Mexico and Municipalities of Mexico\n\nSee also: List of Mexican state legislatures\n\nThe boundaries and constituent units of Mexico evolved over time from its colonial-era origins. Central America peacefully separated from Mexico after independence in 1821. Yucat\u00e1n was briefly an independent republic. Texas separated in the Texas Revolution and when it was annexed to the U.S. in 1845, it set the stage for the Mexican\u2013American War and major territorial loss to the U.S. The sale of northern territory known in the U.S. as the Gadsden Purchase was the last loss of Mexican territory. The United Mexican States are a federation of 31 free and sovereign states, which form a union that exercises a degree of jurisdiction over Mexico City.[170] Each state has its own constitution, congress, and a judiciary, and its citizens elect by direct voting a governor for a six-year term, and representatives to their respective unicameral state congresses for three-year terms.[171]\n\n\nMexico City is a special political division that belongs to the federation as a whole and not to a particular state.[170] Formerly known as the Federal District, its autonomy was previously limited relative to that of the states.[172] It dropped this designation in 2016 and is in the process of achieving greater political autonomy by becoming a federal entity with its own constitution and congress.[173] The states are divided into municipalities, the smallest administrative political entity in the country, governed by a mayor or municipal president (*presidente municipal*), elected by its residents by plurality.[174]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nGulf of  \nMexico\n\nPacific  \nOcean\n\nCentral  \nAmerica\n\nUnited States of America\n\nMexico City\n\nAG\n\nBaja  \nCalifornia\n\nBaja  \nCalifornia  \nSur\n\nCampeche\n\nChiapas\n\nChihuahua\n\nCoahuila\n\nColima\n\nDurango\n\nGuanajuato\n\nGuerrero\n\nHD\n\nJalisco\n\nEM\n\nMichoac\u00e1n\n\nMO\n\nNayarit\n\nNuevo  \nLe\u00f3n\n\nOaxaca\n\nPuebla\n\nQuer\u00e9taro\n\nQuintana  \nRoo\n\nSan Luis  \nPotos\u00ed\n\nSinaloa\n\nSonora\n\nTabasco\n\nTamaulipas\n\nTL\n\nVeracruz\n\nYucat\u00e1n\n\nZacatecas\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Mexico\n\nSee also: Economic history of Mexico\n\n![](image)Mexican Stock Exchange building, in Mexico City\n![](image)Headquarters of Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil in Mexico City, the largest mobile network operator outside Asia\nAs of April 2018, Mexico has the 15th largest nominal GDP (US$1.15 trillion)[175] and the 11th largest by purchasing power parity (US$2.45 trillion). GDP annual average growth was 2.9% in 2016 and 2% in 2017.[175] Agriculture has comprised 4% of the economy over the last two decades, while industry contributes 33% (mostly automotive, oil, and electronics) and services (notably financial services and tourism) contribute 63%.[175] Mexico's GDP in PPP per capita was US$18,714.05. The World Bank reported in 2009 that the country's gross national income in market exchange rates was the second highest in Latin America, after Brazil at US$1,830.392\u00a0billion,[176] which led to the highest income per capita in the region at $15,311.[177][178]\n\n\nMexico is now firmly established as an upper middle-income country. After the slowdown of 2001 the country has recovered and has grown 4.2, 3.0 and 4.8 percent in 2004, 2005 and 2006,[179] even though it is considered to be well below Mexico's potential growth.[180] The International Monetary Fund predicts growth rates of 2.3% and 2.7% for 2018 and 2019, respectively.[175] By 2050, Mexico could potentially become the world's fifth or seventh largest economy.[181][182]\n\n\nThe electronics industry of Mexico has grown enormously within the last decade. Mexico has the sixth largest electronics industry in the world after China, the United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Mexico is the second-largest exporter of electronics to the United States where it exported $71.4 billion worth of electronics in 2011.[183] The Mexican electronics industry grew 20% between 2010 and 2011, up from its constant growth rate of 17% between 2003 and 2009.[183] Currently electronics represent 30% of Mexico's exports.[183]\n\n\nMexico produces the most automobiles of any North American nation.[184] The industry produces technologically complex components and engages in some research and development activities.[185] The \"Big Three\" (General Motors, Ford and Chrysler) have been operating in Mexico since the 1930s, while Volkswagen and Nissan built their plants in the 1960s.[186] In Puebla alone, 70 industrial part-makers cluster around Volkswagen.[185] In the 2010s expansion of the sector was surging. In September 2016 Kia opened a $1 billion factory in Nuevo Le\u00f3n,[187] with Audi also opening an assembling plant in Puebla the same year.[188] BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Nissan currently have plants in construction.[189] The domestic car industry is represented by DINA S.A., which has built buses and trucks since 1962,[190] and the new Mastretta company that builds the high-performance Mastretta MXT sports car.[191] In 2006, trade with the United States and Canada accounted for almost 50% of Mexico's exports and 45% of its imports.[12]\n\n\nDuring the first three quarters of 2010, the United States had a $46.0 billion trade deficit with Mexico.[192] In August 2010 Mexico surpassed France to become the 9th largest holder of US debt.[193] The commercial and financial dependence on the US is a cause for concern.[194] The remittances from Mexican citizens working in the United States are significant; after dipping during the 2008 Great Recession and again during COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 they are topping other sources of foreign income.[195][196] Remittances are directed to Mexico by direct links from a U.S. government banking program.[197]\n\n\n\nFile:San Pedro ,Nuevo Le\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico.jpgSkyscrapers in San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda, Nuevo Le\u00f3n\nAlthough multiple international organizations coincide and classify Mexico as an upper middle income country, or a middle class country,[198][199] Mexico's National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (CONEVAL), which is the organization in charge to measure the country's poverty reports that a huge percentage of Mexico's population lives in poverty. According to said council, from 2006 to 2010 (year on which the CONEVAL published its first nationwide report of poverty) the portion of Mexicans who live in poverty rose from 18%\u201319%[200] to 46% (52 million people).[201] According to the OECD's own poverty line (defined as the percentage of a country's population who earns 60%[202] or less of the national median income) 20% of Mexico's population lives in a situation of poverty.[203]\n\n\nAmong the OECD countries, Mexico has the second-highest degree of economic disparity between the extremely poor and extremely rich, after Chile\u00a0\u2013 although it has been falling over the last decade, being one of few countries in which this is the case.[204] The bottom ten percent in the income hierarchy disposes of 1.36% of the country's resources, whereas the upper ten percent dispose of almost 36%. The OECD also notes that Mexico's budgeted expenses for poverty alleviation and social development is only about a third of the OECD average.[205] This is also reflected by the fact that infant mortality in Mexico is three times higher than the average among OECD nations whereas its literacy levels are in the median range of OECD nations. Nevertheless, according to a Goldman Sachs report published in 2007, by 2050 Mexico will have the 5th largest economy in the world.[206] According to a 2008 UN report the average income in a typical urbanized area of Mexico was $26,654, while the average income in rural areas just miles away was only $8,403.[207] Daily minimum wages are set annually being set at $102.68 Mexican pesos (US$5.40) in 2019.[208]\n\n\n\n### Communications[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Telecommunications in Mexico\n\n![](image)Telmex Tower, Mexico City\nThe telecommunications industry is mostly dominated by Telmex (*Tel\u00e9fonos de M\u00e9xico*), previously a government monopoly privatized in 1990. By 2006, Telmex had expanded its operations to Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and the United States. Other players in the domestic industry are Axtel, Maxcom, Alestra, Marcatel, AT&T Mexico.[209] Because of Mexican orography, providing a landline telephone service at remote mountainous areas is expensive, and the penetration of line-phones per capita is low compared to other Latin American countries, at 40 percent; however, 82% of Mexicans over the age of 14 own a mobile phone. Mobile telephony has the advantage of reaching all areas at a lower cost, and the total number of mobile lines is almost two times that of landlines, with an estimation of 63 million lines.[210] The telecommunication industry is regulated by the government through Cofetel (*Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Telecomunicaciones*).\n\n\nThe Mexican satellite system is domestic and operates 120 earth stations. There is also extensive microwave radio relay network and considerable use of fiber-optic and coaxial cable.[210] Mexican satellites are operated by *Sat\u00e9lites Mexicanos* (Satmex), a private company, leader in Latin America and servicing both North and South America.[211] It offers broadcast, telephone and telecommunication services to 37 countries in the Americas, from Canada to Argentina. Through business partnerships Satmex provides high-speed connectivity to ISPs and Digital Broadcast Services.[212] Satmex maintains its own satellite fleet with most of the fleet being designed and built in Mexico. Major players in the broadcasting industry are Televisa, the largest Mexican media company in the Spanish-speaking world,[213] TV Azteca and Imagen Televisi\u00f3n.\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Electricity sector in Mexico\n\n![](image)The Central E\u00f3lica Sureste I, Fase II in Oaxaca\nEnergy production in Mexico is managed by the state-owned companies Federal Commission of Electricity and Pemex. Pemex, the public company in charge of exploration, extraction, transportation and marketing of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the refining and distribution of petroleum products and petrochemicals, is one of the largest companies in the world by revenue, making US$86 billion in sales a year.[214][215][216] Mexico is the sixth-largest oil producer in the world, with 3.7 million barrels per day.[217] In 1980 oil exports accounted for 61.6% of total exports; by 2000 it was only 7.3%.[185] The largest hydro plant in Mexico is the 2,400 MW Manuel Moreno Torres Dam in Chicoas\u00e9n, Chiapas, in the Grijalva River. This is the world's fourth most productive hydroelectric plant.[218]\n\n\nMexico is the country with the world's third largest solar potential.[219] The country's gross solar potential is estimated at 5kWh/m2 daily, which corresponds to 50 times national electricity generation.[220] Currently, there is over 1 million square meters of solar thermal panels[221] installed in Mexico, while in 2005, there were 115,000 square meters of solar PV (photo-voltaic). It is expected that in 2012 there will be 1,8 million square meters of installed solar thermal panels.[221] The project named SEGH-CFE 1, located in Puerto Libertad, Sonora, Northwest of Mexico, will have capacity of 46.8 MW from an array of 187,200 solar panels when complete in 2013.[222] All of the electricity will be sold directly to the CFE and absorbed into the utility's transmission system for distribution throughout their existing network. At an installed capacity of 46.8 MWp, when complete in 2013, the project will be the first utility scale project of its kind in Mexico and the largest solar project of any kind in Latin America.\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of science and technology in Mexico\n\n![](image)Large Millimeter Telescope in Puebla\nThe National Autonomous University of Mexico was officially established in 1910,[223] and the university became one of the most important institutes of higher learning in Mexico.[224] UNAM provides world class education in science, medicine, and engineering.[225] Many scientific institutes and new institutes of higher learning, such as National Polytechnic Institute (founded in 1936),[226] were established during the first half of the 20th century. Most of the new research institutes were created within UNAM. Twelve institutes were integrated into UNAM from 1929 to 1973.[227] In 1959, the Mexican Academy of Sciences was created to coordinate scientific efforts between academics.\n\n\nIn 1995, the Mexican chemist Mario J. Molina shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Paul J. Crutzen and F. Sherwood Rowland for their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone.[228] Molina, an alumnus of UNAM, became the first Mexican citizen to win the Nobel Prize in science.[229]\n\n\nIn recent years, the largest scientific project being developed in Mexico was the construction of the Large Millimeter Telescope (Gran Telescopio Milim\u00e9trico, GMT), the world's largest and most sensitive single-aperture telescope in its frequency range.[230] It was designed to observe regions of space obscured by stellar dust. Mexico was ranked 58th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[231][232]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Mexico\n\n![](image)The resort town of Canc\u00fan, May 2008\nAs of 2017, Mexico was the 6th most visited country in the world and had the 15th highest income from tourism in the world which is also the highest in Latin America.[233] The vast majority of tourists come to Mexico from the United States and Canada followed by Europe and Asia. A smaller number also come from other Latin American countries.[234] In the 2017 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report, Mexico was ranked 22nd in the world, which was 3rd in the Americas.[235]\n\n\nThe coastlines of Mexico are rich in sunny beach stretches. According to the Constitution of Mexico Article 27, the entirety of the coastlines is under federal ownership. On the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, one of the most popular beach destinations is the resort town of Canc\u00fan, especially among university students during spring break. To the south of Cancun is the coastal strip called Riviera Maya which includes the beach town of Playa del Carmen and the ecological parks of Xcaret and Xel-H\u00e1. To the south of Canc\u00fan is the town of Tulum, notable for its ruins of Maya civilization. Other notable tourist destination include Acapulco with crowded beaches and multi-story hotels on the shores. At the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is the resort town of Cabo San Lucas, noted for its marlin fishing.[236] Closer to the United States border is the weekend draw of San Felipe, Baja California.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn Mexican cities along the Mexico\u2013United States border the most lucrative hospitality industry is now medical tourism, with remnants of the traditional motivations that drove tourists to Mexico's northern borderlands for nearly a century. Dominant medical tourism for the purpose of tourism planning are the purchase of medication, dentistry, elective surgery, optometry, and chiropractic.[237]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Mexico\n\n![](image)Baluarte Bridge, the highest bridge in the Americas.\nDespite its difficult topography, Mexico's roadway is extensive and most areas in the country are covered. The roadway network in Mexico has an extent of 366,095\u00a0km (227,481\u00a0mi),[238] of which 116,802\u00a0km (72,577\u00a0mi) are paved,[239] making it 9th largest of any country[240] and has the 7th best connectivity index in the world.[241] Of these, 10,474\u00a0km (6,508\u00a0mi) are multi-lane expressways: 9,544\u00a0km (5,930\u00a0mi) are four-lane highways and the rest have 6 or more lanes.[239]\n\n\nStarting in the late nineteenth century, Mexico was one of the first Latin American countries to promote railway development,[155] and the network covers 30,952\u00a0km (19,233\u00a0mi). The Secretary of Communications and Transport of Mexico proposed a high-speed rail link that will transport its passengers from Mexico City to Guadalajara, Jalisco.[242][243] The train, which will travel at 300 kilometers per hour (190 miles per hour),[244] will allow passengers to travel from Mexico City to Guadalajara in just 2\u00a0hours.[244] The whole project was projected to cost 240\u00a0billion pesos, or about 25\u00a0billion US$[242] and is being paid for jointly by the Mexican government and the local private sector including one of the wealthiest men in the world, Mexico's billionaire business tycoon Carlos Slim.[245] The government of the state of Yucat\u00e1n is also funding the construction of a high speed line connecting the cities of Cozumel to M\u00e9rida and Chichen Itza and Canc\u00fan.[246]\n\n\nMexico has 233 airports with paved runways; of these, 35 carry 97% of the passenger traffic.[*citation needed*] The Mexico City International Airport remains the busiest in Latin America and the 36th busiest in the world[247] transporting 45 million passengers a year.[248]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Mexico\n\n![](image)Population density of Mexico\nThroughout the 19th century, the population of Mexico had barely doubled. This trend continued during the first two decades of the 20th century. In 1900, the Mexican population was 13.6\u00a0million.[249] The 1921 census reported a loss of about 1 million inhabitants. The Mexican Revolution (c. 1910\u20131920) greatly impacted population increases. The growth rate increased dramatically between the 1930s and the 1980s, when the country registered growth rates of over 3% (1950\u20131980). The Mexican population doubled in twenty years, and at that rate it was expected that by 2000 there would be 120 million people living in Mexico. Mexico's population grew from 70\u00a0million in 1982 to 120\u00a0million in 2015.[250]\n\n\nLife expectancy increased from 36 years (in 1895) to 72 years (in 2000). According to estimations made by Mexico's National Geography and Statistics Institute, is estimated in 2022 to be 129,150,971[251] as of 2017 Mexico had 123.5 million inhabitants[252] making it the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world.[253]\n\n\n\n### Ethnicity and race[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mexicans\n\nMexico's population is highly diverse, but research on Mexican ethnicity has felt the impact of nationalist discourses on identity.[254][255][256] Since the 1930s, the Mexican government has promoted the view that all Mexicans are part of the Mestizo community, within which they are distinguished only by residence in or outside of an indigenous community, degree of fluency in an indigenous language, and degree of adherence to indigenous customs.[257][258]\n\n\nIt is not until very recently that the Mexican government began conducting surveys that consider other ethnic groups that live in the country, such as Afro-Mexicans (who comprised 2% of Mexico's population in 2020)[13] or White Mexicans (47%).[259][260] Less numerous groups in Mexico such as Asians and Middle Easterners are also accounted for, with numbers of around 1% each. While Mestizos are a prominent ethnic group in contemporary Mexico, the subjective and ever-changing definition of this category have led to its estimations being imprecise, having been observed that many Mexicans do not identify as Mestizos,[261][262] favoring instead ethnoracial labels such as White or Indigenous due to having more consistent and \"static\" definitions.[263]\n\n\n\n![](image)Regional variation of ancestry according to a study made by Ruiz-Linares in 2014; each dot represents a volunteer, with most coming from south Mexico and Mexico City.[264]\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Mexico\n\nSpanish is the *de facto* national language spoken by the vast majority of the population, making Mexico the world's most populous Hispanophone country.[265][253] Mexican Spanish refers to the varieties of the language spoken in the country, which differ from one region to another in sound, structure, and vocabulary.[266]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map for the year 2000 of the indigenous languages of Mexico having more than 100,000 speakers\nThe federal government officially recognizes sixty-eight linguistic groups and 364 varieties of indigenous languages.[267] It is estimated that around 8.3 million citizens speak these languages,[268] with Nahuatl being the most widely spoken by more than 1.7\u00a0million, followed by Yucatec Maya used daily by nearly 850,000 people. Tzeltal and Tzotzil, two other Mayan languages, are spoken by around half a million people each, primarily in the southern state of Chiapas.[268] Mixtec and Zapotec, with an estimated 500,000 native speakers each, are two other prominent language groups.[268] Since its creation in March 2003, the National Indigenous Languages Institute has been in charge of promoting and protecting the use of the country's indigenous languages, through the General Law of Indigenous Peoples' Linguistic Rights, which recognizes them *de jure* as \"national languages\" with status equal to that of Spanish.[269] That notwithstanding, in practice, indigenous peoples often face discrimination and do not have full access to public services such as education and healthcare, or to the justice system, as Spanish is the prevailing language.[270]\n\n\nAside from indigenous languages, there are several minority languages spoken in Mexico due to international migration such as Low German by the 80,000-strong Mennonite population, primarily settled in the northern states, fueled by the tolerance of the federal government towards this community by allowing them to set their own educational system compatible with their customs and traditions.[271] The Chipilo dialect, a variance of the Venetian language, is spoken in the town of Chipilo, located in the central state of Puebla, by around 2,500 people, mainly descendants of Venetians that migrated to the area in the late 19th century.[272] Furthermore, English is the most commonly taught foreign language in Mexico. It is estimated that nearly 24 million, or around a fifth of the population, study the language through public schools, private institutions or self-access channels.[273] However, a high level of English proficiency is limited to only 5% of the population.[274] Moreover, French is the second most widely taught foreign language, as every year between 200,000 and 250,000 Mexican students enroll in language courses.[275][276][277]\n\n\n\n### Emigration and immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Emigration from Mexico and Immigration to Mexico\n\n![](image)Mexico\u2013United States barrier between San Diego's border patrol offices in California, US (left) and Tijuana, Mexico (right)\nIn the early 1960s, around 600,000 Mexicans lived abroad, which increased sevenfold by the 1990s to 4.4 million.[278] At the turn of the 21st century, this figure more than doubled to 9.5 million.[278] As of 2017, it is estimated that 12.9 million Mexicans live abroad, primarily in the United States, which concentrates nearly 98% of the expatriate population.[278]\n\n\nThe majority of Mexicans have settled in states such as California, Texas and Illinois, particularly around the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Dallas\u2013Fort Worth.[279] As a result of these major migration flows in recent decades, around 36 million U.S. residents, or 11.2% of the country's population, identified as being of full or partial Mexican ancestry.[280]\n\n\nThe remaining 2% of expatriates have settled in Canada (86,000), primarily in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec,[281] followed by Spain (49,000) and Germany (18,000), both European destinations represent almost two-thirds of the Mexican population living in the continent.[278] As for Latin America, it is estimated that 69,000 Mexicans live in the region, Guatemala (18,000) being the top destination for expatriates, followed by Bolivia (10,000) and Panama (5,000).[278]\n\n\nAs of 2017[update], it is estimated that 1.2 million foreigners have settled in Mexico,[282] up from nearly 1 million in 2010.[283] The vast majority of migrants come from the United States (900,000), making Mexico the top destination for U.S. citizens abroad.[284] The second largest group comes from neighboring Guatemala (54,500), followed by Spain (27,600).[282] Other major sources of migration are fellow Latin American countries, which include Colombia (20,600), Argentina (19,200) and Cuba (18,100).[282] Historically, the Lebanese diaspora and the German-born Mennonite migration have left a marked impact in the country's culture, particularly in its cuisine and traditional music.[285][286] At the turn of the 21st century, several trends have increased the number of foreigners residing in the country such as the 2008\u20132014 Spanish financial crisis,[287] increasing gang-related violence in the Northern Triangle of Central America,[288] the ongoing political and economic crisis in Venezuela,[289][290] and the automotive industry boom led by Japanese and South Korean investment.[291][292]\n\n\n\n### Urban areas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Metropolitan areas of Mexico\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in

Mexico\n\nReligion in Mexico (2020 census)[294][295]\n\n\n\nRoman Catholic (72.1%)\nEvangelist (unspecified) (2.5%)\nJehovah's Witness (1.7%)\nPentecostal (1.3%)\nBaptists (0.8%)\nAdventists (0.4%)\nMormons (0.2%)\nIrreligion (15.3%)\nAtheist (0.9%)\nAgnostics (0.1%)\nNo answer/Don't know (2.7%)\nOther (1.4%)\n\nAlthough the Constitutions of 1857 and 1917 put limits on the role of the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico, Roman Catholicism remains the country's dominant religious affiliation. The 2020 census by the *Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda* (National Institute of Statistics and Geography) gives Roman Catholicism as the main religion, with 77.7% (97,864,218) of the population, while 11.2% (14,095,307) belong to Protestant/Evangelical Christian denominations\u2014including Other Christians (6,778,435), Evangelicals (2,387,133), Pentecostals (1,179,415), Jehovah's Witnesses (1,530,909), Seventh-day Adventists (791,109), and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (337,998)\u2014; 8.1% (9,488,671) declared having no religion; .4% (491,814) were unspecified.[13][296]\n\n\nThe 97,864,218[13] Catholics of Mexico constitute in absolute terms the second largest Catholic community in the world, after Brazil's.[297] 47% percent of them attend church services weekly.[298] The feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, is celebrated on 12 December and is regarded by many Mexicans as the most important religious holiday of their country.[299] The denominations Pentecostal also have an important presence, especially in the cities of the border and in the indigenous communities. As of 2010, Pentecostal churches together have more than 1.3 million adherents, which in net numbers place them as the second Christian creed in Mexico. The situation changes when the different Pentecostal denominations are considered as separate entities. Migratory phenomena have led to the spread of different aspects of Christianity, including branches Protestants, Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodox Church.[300]\n\n\nThe presence of Jews in Mexico dates back to 1521, when Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s conquered the Aztecs, accompanied by several Conversos.[301] According to the 2020 census, there are 58,876 Jews in Mexico.[13] Islam in Mexico (with 7,982 members) is practiced mostly by Arab Mexicans.[13] In the 2010 census 36,764 Mexicans reported belonging to a spiritualist religion,[13] a category which includes a tiny Buddhist population.\n\n\nAccording to Jacobo Grinberg, the survival of magic-religious rituals of the old indigenous groups is remarkable. There is often a syncretism between shamanism and Catholic traditions. Another religion of popular syncretism in Mexico (especially in recent years) is the Santer\u00eda. This is mainly due to the large number of Cubans who settled in the territory after the Cuban Revolution. Even though Mexico was also a recipient of black slaves from Africa in the 16th century, the apogee of these cults is relatively new.[302] In general, popular religiosity is viewed with bad eyes by institutionally structured religions. One of the most exemplary cases of popular religiosity is the cult of Holy Dead (Santa Muerte). The Catholic hierarchy insists on describing it as a satanic cult. However, most of the people who profess this cult declare themselves to be Catholic believers. Other examples are the representations of the Passion of Christ and the celebration of Day of the Dead, which take place within the framework of the Catholic Christian imaginary, but under a very particular reinterpretation.[303]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Mexico\n\n![](image)Secretariat of Health, Mexico City, Mexico\nIn the 1930s, Mexico made a commitment to rural health care, mandating that mostly urban medical students receive training in it and to make them agents of the state to assess marginal areas.[304] Since the early 1990s, Mexico entered a transitional stage in the health of its population and some indicators such as mortality patterns are identical to those found in highly developed countries like Germany or Japan.[305] Mexico's medical infrastructure is highly rated for the most part and is usually excellent in major cities,[306][307] but rural communities still lack equipment for advanced medical procedures, forcing patients in those locations to travel to the closest urban areas to get specialized medical care.[155] Social determinants of health can be used to evaluate the state of health in Mexico.\n\n\nState-funded institutions such as Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) and the Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers (ISSSTE) play a major role in health and social security. Private health services are also very important and account for 13% of all medical units in the country.[308] Medical training is done mostly at public universities with much specializations done in vocational or internship settings. Some public universities in Mexico, such as the University of Guadalajara, have signed agreements with the U.S. to receive and train American students in medicine. Health care costs in private institutions and prescription drugs in Mexico are on average lower than that of its North American economic partners.[306]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Mexico\n\n![](image)Central Library of the National Autonomous University of Mexico\nAs of 2018, the literacy rate in Mexico is 94.86%, up from 82.99% in 1980,[309] with numbers for males and females being relatively equal.\n\n\nAccording to most rankings, the publicly funded National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) is the best university in the country. Other prominent public universities include The National Polythechnic Institute, the Metropolitan Autonomous University, the University of Guadalajara and the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n and El Colegio de M\u00e9xico.[310][311][312][313] According to most rankings, the best Mexican private university is the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education. Other prominent private universities include Universidad Iberoamericana, Universidad Panamericana, ITAM and Universidad An\u00e1huac.[310][311][312]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Mexico\n\nMexican culture reflects the complexity of the country's history through the blending of indigenous cultures and the culture of Spain during Spain's 300-year colonial rule of Mexico. The Porfirian era (*el Porfiriato*) (1876\u20131911), was marked by economic progress and peace. After four decades of civil unrest and war, Mexico saw the development of philosophy and the arts, promoted by President Porfirio D\u00edaz himself. Since that time, as accentuated during the Mexican Revolution, cultural identity has had its foundation in *mestizaje*: the blending of different races and cultures, of which the indigenous (i.e. Amerindian) element is the core.[*dubious \u2013 discuss*] In light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people, Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos in *La Raza C\u00f3smica* (The Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico and Latin America to be the melting pot of all races (thus extending the definition of the *mestizo*) not only biologically but culturally as well.[314] Other Mexican intellectuals grappled with the idea of *Lo Mexicano*, which seeks \"to discover the national ethos of Mexican culture.\"[315] Nobel laureate Octavio Paz explores the notion of a Mexican national character in *The Labyrinth of Solitude*.\n\n\n\n### Art[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mexican art\n\n![](image)Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, two of the most famous Mexican artists\nPainting is one of the oldest arts in Mexico. Cave painting in Mexican territory is about 7500 years old and has been found in the caves of the Baja California Peninsula. Pre-Columbian Mexico is present in buildings and caves, in Aztec codices, in ceramics, in garments, etc.; examples of this are the Maya mural paintings of Bonampak, or those of Teotihuac\u00e1n, those of Cacaxtla and those of Monte Alb\u00e1n.\nMural painting with Christian religious themes had an important flowering during the 16th century, early colonial era in newly constructed churches and monasteries. Examples can be found in Acolman, Actopan, Huejotzingo, Tecamachalco and Zinacantepec.\n\n\nAs with most art during the early modern era in the West, colonial-era Mexican art was religious during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Starting in the late seventeenth century, and, most prominently in the eighteenth century, secular portraits and images of racial types, so-called casta painting appeared.[316] Important painters of the late colonial period were Juan Correa, Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando and Miguel Cabrera. In early post-independence Mexico, nineteenth-century painting had a marked romantic influence; landscapes and portraits were the greatest expressions of this era. Hermenegildo Bustos is one of the most appreciated painters of the historiography of Mexican art. Other painters include Santiago Rebull, F\u00e9lix Parra, Eugenio Landesio, and his noted pupil, the landscape artist Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco.[317]\n\n\nIn the 20th century has achieved world renown with painters such as Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco, the so-called \"Big Three\" of Mexican muralism. They were commissioned by the Mexican government to paint large-scale historical murals on the walls of public buildings, which helped shape popular perceptions of the Mexican Revolution and Mexican cultural identity.[318] Frida Kahlo's largely personal portraiture has gained enormous popularity.[319]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of Mexico\n\n![](image)Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts), with murals, other artwork, and a major performance space\nIn the 19th century the neoclassical movement arose as a response to the objectives of the republican nation, one of its examples are the Hospicio Caba\u00f1as where the strict plastic of the classical orders are represented in their architectural elements, new religious buildings also arise, civilian and military that demonstrate the presence of neoclassicism. Romanticists from a past seen through archeology show images of medieval Europe, Islamic and pre-Columbian Mexico in the form of architectural elements in the construction of international exhibition pavilions looking for an identity typical of the national culture. The *art nouveau*, and the *art deco* were styles introduced into the design of the Palacio de Bellas Artes to mark the identity of the Mexican nation with Greek-Roman and pre-Columbian symbols.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe emergence of the new Mexican architecture was born as a formal order of the policies of a nationalist state that sought modernity and the differentiation of other nations. The development of a Mexican modernist architecture was perhaps mostly fully manifested in the mid-1950s construction of the Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico City, the main campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Designed by the most prestigious architects of the era, including Mario Pani, Eugenio Peschard, and Enrique del Moral, the buildings feature murals by artists Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Jos\u00e9 Ch\u00e1vez Morado. It has since been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[320]\n\n\nJuan O'Gorman was one of the first environmental architects in Mexico, developing the \"organic\" theory, trying to integrate the building with the landscape within the same approaches of Frank Lloyd Wright.[321] In the search for a new architecture that does not resemble the styles of the past, it achieves a joint manifestation with the mural painting and the landscaping. Luis Barrag\u00e1n combined the shape of the space with forms of rural vernacular architecture of Mexico and Mediterranean countries (Spain-Morocco), integrating color that handles light and shade in different tones and opens a look at the international minimalism. He won the 1980 Pritzker Prize, the highest award in architecture.[322]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mexican cuisine\nSee also: Mexican wine\n\n![](image)*Mole sauce*, which has dozens of varieties across the Republic, is seen as a symbol of *Mexicanidad*[323] and is considered Mexico's national dish.[323]\nThe origin of the current Mexican cuisine was established during the Spanish colonial era, a mixture of the foods of Spain with native indigenous ingredients.[324] Foods indigenous to Mexico include corn, pepper vegetables, calabazas, avocados, sweet potato, turkey, many beans, and other fruits and spices. Similarly, some cooking techniques used today are inherited from pre-Columbian peoples, such as the nixtamalization of corn, the cooking of food in ovens at ground level, grinding in molcajete and metate. With the Spaniards came the pork, beef and chicken meats; peppercorn, sugar, milk and all its derivatives, wheat and rice, citrus fruits and another constellation of ingredients that are part of the daily diet of Mexicans.\n\n\nFrom this meeting of millennia old two culinary traditions, were born pozole, mole sauce, barbacoa and tamale in its current forms, chocolate, a large range of breads, tacos, and the broad repertoire of Mexican street foods. Beverages such as atole, champurrado, milk chocolate and aguas frescas were born; desserts such as acitr\u00f3n and the full range of crystallized sweets, rompope, cajeta, jericaya and the wide repertoire of delights created in the convents of nuns in all parts of the country.\n\n\nIn 2005, Mexico presented the candidature of its gastronomy for World Heritage Site of UNESCO, the first time a country had presented its gastronomic tradition for this purpose.[325] The result was negative, because the committee did not place the proper emphasis on the importance of corn in Mexican cuisine.[326] On 16 November 2010 Mexican gastronomy was recognized as Intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO.[327] In addition, Daniela Soto-Innes was named the best female chef in the world by *The World's Best 50 Restaurants* in April 2019.[328]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mexican literature\n\n![](image)Octavio Paz, the only Mexican awarded with the Nobel Prize in Literature\nMexican literature has its antecedents in the literature of the indigenous settlements of Mesoamerica. Poetry had a rich cultural tradition in pre-Columbian Mexico, being divided into two broad categories\u2014secular and religious. Aztec poetry was sung, chanted, or spoken, often to the accompaniment of a drum or a harp. While Tenochtitlan was the political capital, Texcoco was the cultural center; the Texcocan language was considered the most melodious and refined. The best well-known pre-Columbian poet is Nezahualcoyotl.[329]\n\n\nThere are historical chronicles of the conquest of Mexico by participants, and, later, by historians. Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo's *True History of the Conquest of the New Spain* is still widely read today. Spanish-born poet Bernardo de Balbuena extolled the virtues of Mexico in *Grandeza mexicana* (Mexican grandeur) (1604). Baroque literature flourished in the 17th century; the most notable writers of this period were Juan Ruiz de Alarc\u00f3n and Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz. Sor Juana was famous in her own time, called the \"Ten Muse.\"[330]\n\n\nThe late colonial-era novel by Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez de Lizardi, whose *The Mangy Parrot* (\"El Periquillo Sarniento\"), is said to be the first Latin American novel.[330] Nineteenth-century liberal of Nahua origin Ignacio Manuel Altamirano is an important writer of the era, along with Vicente Riva Palacio, the grandson of Mexican hero of independence Vicente Guerrero, who authored a series of historical novels as well as poetry. In the modern era, the novel of the Mexican Revolution by Mariano Azuela (*Los de abajo*, translated to English as *The Underdogs*) is noteworthy. Poet and Nobel Laureate Octavio Paz, novelist Carlos Fuentes, Alfonso Reyes, Renato Leduc, essayist Carlos Monsiv\u00e1is, journalist and public intellectual Elena Poniatowska, and Juan Rulfo (*Pedro P\u00e1ramo*), Mart\u00edn Luis Guzm\u00e1n, Nellie Campobello, (*Cartucho*).\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of Mexico\n\n![](image)Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, the first Mexican filmmaker to win the Academy Award for Best Director\nMexican films from the *Golden Age* in the 1940s and 1950s are the greatest examples of Latin American cinema, with a huge industry comparable to the Hollywood of those years. Mexican films were exported and exhibited in all of Latin America and Europe. *Mar\u00eda Candelaria* (1943) by Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez, was one of the first films awarded a Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1946, the first time the event was held after World War II. The famous Spanish-born director Luis Bu\u00f1uel realized in Mexico between 1947 and 1965 some of his masterpieces like *Los Olvidados* (1949) and *Viridiana* (1961). Famous actors and actresses from this period include Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix, Pedro Infante, Dolores del R\u00edo, Jorge Negrete and the comedian Cantinflas.\n\n\nMore recently, films such as *Como agua para chocolate* (1992), *Sex, Shame, and Tears* (1999), *Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n* (2001), and *The Crime of Father Amaro* (2002) have been successful in creating universal stories about contemporary subjects, and were internationally recognized. Mexican directors Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (*Babel*, *Birdman*, *The Revenant*, *Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths*), Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (*A Little Princess*, *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, *Gravity*, *Roma*), Guillermo del Toro (*Pan's Labyrinth*, *Crimson Peak*, *The Shape of Water*, *Nightmare Alley*), screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga and photographer Emmanuel Lubezki are some of the most known present-day film makers.\n\n\n\n### Music and dance[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of Mexico and Folk dance of Mexico\n\n![A black and white portrait of a middle aged man wearing a dark suit, glasses and looking down.](image)Pedro Infante was one of the best ranchera singers.\nMexico has a long tradition of music from the prehispanic era to the present. Much of the music from the colonial era was composed for religious purposes.[331][332]\n\n\nAlthough the traditions of European opera and especially Italian opera had initially dominated the Mexican music conservatories and strongly influenced native opera composers (in both style and subject matter), elements of Mexican nationalism had already appeared by the latter part of the 19th century with operas such as Aniceto Ortega del Villar's 1871 *Guatimotzin*, a romanticized account of the defense of Mexico by its last Aztec ruler, Cuauht\u00e9moc. The most well-known Mexican composer of the twentieth century is Carlos Ch\u00e1vez (1899\u20131978), who composed six symphonies with indigenous themes, and rejuvenated Mexican music, founding the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica Nacional.[333]\n\n\nTraditional Mexican music includes mariachi, banda, norte\u00f1o, ranchera, and corridos. Corridos were particularly popular during the Mexican Revolution (1910\u201320) and in the present era include narcocorridos. The embrace of rock and roll by young Mexicans in the 1960s and 1970s brought Mexico into the transnational, counterculture movement of the era. In Mexico, the native rock culture merged into the larger countercultural and political movement of the late 1960s, culminating in the 1968 protests and redirected into counterculture rebellion, *La Onda* (the wave).[334][335]\n\n\nOn an everyday basis most Mexicans listen to contemporary music such as pop, rock, and others in both English and Spanish. Folk dance of Mexico along with its music is both deeply regional and traditional. Founded in 1952, the Ballet Folkl\u00f3rico de M\u00e9xico performs music and dance of the prehispanic period through the Mexican Revolution in regional attire in the Palacio de Bellas Artes.[336]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mexican television, List of newspapers in Mexico, and List of Mexican magazines\n\n![](image)Televisa headquarters in Mexico City\nThere was a major reform of the telecommunications industry in 2013, with the creation of new broadcast television channels. There had been a longstanding limitation on the number of networks, with Televisa, with a virtual monopoly; TV Azteca, and Imagen Television. New technology has allowed the entry of foreign satellite and cable companies. Mexico became the first Latin American country to transition from analog to all digital transmissions.[337]\n\n\n*Telenovelas*, or soap operas are very traditional in Mexico and are translated to many languages and seen all over the world. Mexico was a pioneer in edutainment, with TV producer Miguel Sabido creating in 1970s \"soap operas for social change\". The \"Sabido method\" has been adopted in many other countries subsequently, including India, Peru, Kenya, and China.[338] The Mexican government successfully used a telenovela to promote family planning in the 1970s to curb the country's high birth rate.[339]\n\n\nBilingual government radio stations broadcasting in Spanish and indigenous languages were a tool for indigenous education (1958\u201365) and since 1979 the Instituto Nacional Indigenista has established a national network of bilingual radio stations.[340]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Mexico\n\n![](image)Azteca Stadium, Mexico City\nOrganized sport in Mexico largely dates from the late nineteenth century, with only bullfighting having a long history dating to the early colonial era. Once the political turmoil of the early republic was replaced by the stability of the Porfiriato did organized sport become public diversions, with structured and ordered play governed by rules and authorities. Baseball was introduced from the United States and also via Cuba in the 1880s and organized teams were created. After the Mexican Revolution, the government sponsored sports to counter the international image of political turmoil and violence.[341]\n\n\nThe bid to host the 1968 Summer Olympics was to burnish Mexico's stature internationally, with is being the first Latin American country to host the games. The government spent abundantly on sporting facilities and other infrastructure to make the games a success, but those expenditures helped fuel public discontent with the government's lack of spending on social programs.[341] Mexico City hosted the XIX Olympic Games in 1968, making it the first Latin American city to do so.[342] The country has also hosted the FIFA World Cup twice, in 1970 and 1986.[343] Mexico's most popular sport is association football. \n\n\n\n![](image)El Santo, one of the most iconic Mexican *luchadores*\nThe Mexican professional baseball league is named the Liga Mexicana de Beisbol. While usually not as strong as the United States, the Caribbean countries and Japan, Mexico has nonetheless achieved several international baseball titles.[344][345]\n\n\nOther sporting activities include Bullfighting, boxing, and *Lucha Libre* (freestyle professional wrestling). Bullfighting (Spanish: *corrida de toros*) came to Mexico 500 years ago with the arrival of the Spanish. Despite efforts by animal rights activists to outlaw it, bullfighting remains a popular sport in the country, and almost all large cities have bullrings. Plaza M\u00e9xico in Mexico City, which seats 45,000 people, is the largest bullring in the world.[346] Freestyle professional wrestling is a major crowd draw with national promotions such as AAA, CMLL and others.[347]\n\n\nMexico is an international power in professional boxing.[347] Thirteen Olympic boxing medals have been won by Mexico.[348]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Mexico portal\n\n\n* Index of Mexico-related articles\n* Outline of Mexico\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** or Spanish: *M\u00e9jico*, both pronounced [\u02c8mexiko] \u24d8; Nahuatl languages: *M\u0113xihco*, Yucatec Maya: *Meejikoo*\n2. **^** Usually, in Spanish, the name of the county is spelled *M\u00e9xico*; however, in Peninsular (European) Spanish, the variant *M\u00e9jico* is used alongside the usual version.

It is the world's third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] It shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations.[j] With a population of over 333 million,[k] it is the most populous country in the Americas and the third-most populous in the world. The national capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., and its most populous city and principal financial center is New York City.\n\n\nIndigenous peoples have inhabited the Americas for thousands of years. Beginning in 1607, British colonization led to the establishment of the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern United States. They clashed with the British Crown over taxation and political representation, which led to the American Revolution and the ensuing Revolutionary War. The United States declared independence on July 4, 1776, becoming the first nation-state founded on Enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and liberal democracy. The country began expanding across North America, spanning the continent by 1848. Sectional division over slavery (primarily of Africans) led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the American Civil War (1861\u20131865). With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. However, racial discrimination and inequality continued into subsequent centuries. By 1900, the United States had established itself as a great power, becoming the world's largest economy. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the side of the Allies. The aftermath of the war left the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence but avoided direct military conflict. During the Space Race, the United States landed the first humans on the Moon, notably with the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War, the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower.\n\n\nThe United States government is a federal presidential constitutional republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level, with widely differing laws by jurisdiction which may not conflict with the Constitution.[26][27] The U.S. ranks very highly in international measures of quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness, human rights, innovation, and education; it has low levels of perceived corruption. It has higher levels of incarceration and inequality than most other liberal democracies and is the only liberal democracy without universal healthcare. As a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, the U.S. has been extensively shaped by the world's largest immigrant population.\n\n\nHighly developed, the U.S. has by far the largest amount of wealth of any country. The American economy accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP and is the world's largest by nominal GDP. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter, as well as the largest consumer market. It is a founding member of the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, NATO and WHO, and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is the world's foremost political, cultural, economic, military, and scientific power.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of the United States and Demonyms for the United States\n\nThe first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp. Moylan expressed his desire to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[28][29][30] The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in *The Virginia Gazette* newspaper in Williamsburg, on April\u00a06, 1776.[31]\n\n\nBy June 1776, the name \"United States of America\" appeared in drafts of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, authored by John Dickinson, a Founding Father from the Province of Pennsylvania,[32][33] and in the Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, on July 4, 1776.[32]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States\n\nFor a topical guide, see Outline of United States history.\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Native Americans in the United States and Pre-Columbian era\n\n![](image)Cliff Palace, located in present-day Colorado, was built by Ancestral Puebloans.\nThe first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia across the Bering land bridge at least 12,000 years ago; some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival.[34][35][36] The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000BC, is believed to represent the first widespread culture in the Americas.[37][38] The Clovis culture was replaced by several more localized regional societies from the Younger Dryas cold-climate period onward.[39]\n\n\nOver time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[40] The city-state of Cahokia was the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in present-day United States.[41] In the Four Corners region in present-day Southwestern United States, the culture of Ancestral Puebloans developed over centuries of agricultural experimentation.[42] The Algonquian were historically prominent along the Atlantic Coast and in the Saint Lawrence River and Great Lakes regions. Before European immigrants made contact, most of the Algonquian relied on hunting and fishing, and many supplemented their diet by cultivating corn, beans, and squash, known as the \"Three Sisters\". By the time of European contact in the 17th century, they practiced slash and burn agriculture, using controlled fire to extend farmlands' productivity and manage land.[43][44][45][46][47][48] The Ojibwe cultivated wild rice.[49] The Iroquois confederation Haudenosaunee, located in the southern Great Lakes region, was established between the 12th and 15th centuries.[50] Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants[51][52] range from around 500,000[53][51] to nearly 10 million.[51][52]\n\n\n\n### Colonization (1492\u20131763)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colonial history of the United States\n\n![](image)British North America in 1775 with the 13 colonies shown in red\nChristopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean in 1492, and Spain soon established Spanish Florida on the mainland.[54][55] \nThe Spanish Empire set up their first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, including in Saint Augustine (1565), which is often considered the nation's oldest city,[56] and Santa Fe (1598). The Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, sent by France to the New World in 1525, encountered Native American inhabitants in the present-day New York Bay region.[57] The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico, including in New Orleans (1718) and Mobile (1702).[58]\nBritish colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and Plymouth Colony (1620).[59][60] Many English settlers were dissenting Christians who fled England seeking religious freedom.[61] The Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[62][63]\n\n\nDuring 17th-century European colonization, settlers experienced food shortages, disease, and conflicts with Native Americans, particularly in King Philip's War, but often came to develop a mutual dependency. Settlers traded guns, tools, and European goods for food and animal pelts.[64] Native Americans taught settlers to cultivate local foods. Colonial authorities often pursued policies to to \"civilize\" the Native Americans and urge or force them to adopt European lifestyles.[65][66] The native population of America declined after European arrival,[67][68][69] primarily as a result of infectious diseases brought from Europe such as smallpox and measles,[70][71] and native peoples were displaced by European expansion.[72]\n\n\nEuropean settlers trafficked African slaves into the colonial United States via the transatlantic slave trade.[73] By the turn of the 18th century, slavery supplanted indentured servitude as the main source of agricultural labor for the cash crops in the Southern Colonies.[74] Southern tobacco colonies passed laws designed to keep African Americans subservient.[75][76][77]\n\n\nThe original Thirteen Colonies[l] were administered by Great Britain.[78] All colonies had local governments with elections open to white male property owners except Jews and, in some areas, Catholics.[79][80] With very high birth rates, low death rates, and steadily growing settlements, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations.[81] By the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[82] The colonies' distance from Britain allowed for the development of self-governance, [83] and the First Great Awakening\u2014a series of Christian revivals\u2014fueled colonial interest in religious liberty.[84]\n\n\n\n### Revolution and the new nation (1763\u20131789)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1776\u20131789)\n\nFurther information: American Enlightenment\n\n![See caption](image)*Declaration of Independence*, a portrait by John Trumbull depicting the Committee of Five presenting the draft of the Declaration to the Continental Congress on June 28, 1776, in Philadelphia\nAfter the British victory in the French and Indian War, won largely through the support from the colonies, the British began to assert greater control in local colonial affairs, fomenting colonial political resistance. In 1774, to demonstrate colonial dissatisfaction with the lack of representation in the British government that extracted taxes from them, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia and passed the Continental Association, which mandated a colonies-wide boycott of British goods. The British attempted to disarm the Americans, resulting in the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and charged a committee led by Thomas Jefferson with writing a Declaration of Independence.[85]\n\n\nOn July\u00a04, 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, which famously stated: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" The adoption of the Declaration of Independence is celebrated annually on July 4 in the United States as Independence Day.[86] After the surrender of a second British Army at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty. American sovereignty gained international recognition, and the new nation took possession of substantial territory east of the Mississippi River, from what is present-day Canada in the north to Florida in the south.[87] Washington resigned his commission, returned to private life, and the Continental Army was disbanded. \n\n\n\n![](image)*The Old Plantation*, a c.\u20091790 painting of a plantation by a South Carolina slaveholder\nRatified by the states in 1781 and based on the concept of \"consent of the governed\", the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[86] Considered one of the most important legislative acts of the Confederation Congress,[88] the Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the national government would be sovereign and expand westward with the admission of new states, rather than with the expansion of existing states.[89] The prohibition of slavery in the Northwest Territory had the practical effect of establishing the Ohio River as an extension of the Mason\u2013Dixon line, the geographic and political divide between slave states and free states.[90][91]\n\n\nAs it became increasingly apparent that the Confederation was insufficient to govern the new country, nationalists advocated for and led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, where the United States Constitution was drafted. The U.S. Constitution is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force today.[92] Ratified by the states, it went into effect in 1789, reorganizing the government into a federation administered by three branches (executive, judicial, and legislative), on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. George Washington was elected the nation's first President under the new constitution and returned to public life. The Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay concerns by sceptics of the more centralized national government.[93][94]\n\n\n\n### Expansion (1789\u20131860)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1789\u20131849)\n ![](image)Animated map of the territorial evolution of the United States (click to view full size image)\nDuring the colonial period, slavery was legal in the American colonies. However, during the American Revolution, many began to question the practice.[95] Founding Fathers in the northern United States advocated for the abolition of slavery, and slavery was abolished in Northern states.[96] The increased profitability for southern elites after the cotton gin lowered production costs entrenched support for slavery in the southern United States.[97][98][99]\n\n\nIn the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward, with a sense of manifest destiny.[100] The Louisiana Purchase (1803) nearly doubled the territory of the United States, and effectively ended French opposition to America's westward expansion.[101] Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a virtual draw but established the United States as capable of defending itself.[102] Spain ceded Florida and their Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[103] The Missouri Compromise (1820) admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, dividing the country into free states, which forbade slavery, and slave states, which protected the institution.[104] [105]\n\n\nAs Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[106][107] The displacement prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River.[108][109] The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845,[105] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[110] Victory in the Mexican\u2013American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest, resulting in the U.S. stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans.[100][111]\n\n\n\n### Civil War and Reconstruction (1860\u20131876)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1849\u20131865) and 1865\u20131918\n\n![](image)Division of the states during the American Civil War\n * Union states\n* Border states\n* Confederate states\n* Territories\nSectional conflict regarding slavery[112] culminated in the American Civil War.[113] Eleven slave states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, while the remaining states (the Union) maintained that secession was unconstitutional and illegitimate.[114] On April 12, 1861, the Confederacy bombarded Fort Sumter, a federal garrison in Charleston, South Carolina. The ensuing Civil War (1861\u20131865) became the deadliest military conflict in American history.[115] In 1863, the Civil War began to turn in the Union's favor following the Siege of Vicksburg led by General Ulysses S. Grant, which gave them control of the Mississippi River, and the Battle of Gettysburg, where the Union Army halted Confederate Army general Robert E. Lee's invasion of the North. In April 1865, following the Union Army's victory at the Battle of Appomattox Court House, the Confederacy surrendered.[116]\n\n\n![](image)Sketch of Chinese railroad workers on the Central Pacific Railroad, 1870\nThe Reconstruction era followed the war. After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Radical Republicans passed the Reconstruction Amendments to ensure the rights of African Americans. The biracial Southern governments were opposed by terrorist and paramilitary organizations. To encourage additional westward settlement the Homestead Acts allowed an applicant to acquire ownership of government land, by residing there. More than 160\u00a0million acres (650\u00a0thousand\u00a0km2; 250\u00a0thousand\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\u2014nearly 10\u00a0percent of the total area of the United States\u2014were given away free to 1.6\u00a0million homesteaders. The Southern Homestead Act of 1866 was enacted to break a cycle of debt during Reconstruction. This act attempted to sell land at low prices so marginalized Southerners could buy it, but many were still too poor to afford the lower prices.[117] National infrastructure, including telegraph and transcontinental railroads, spurred growth in the American Old West. New transcontinental railways made relocation easier, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[118]\n\n\n\n### Development of the modern United States (1876\u20131914)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1865\u20131918)\n\n![](image)An October 24th, 1874 Harper's Magazine editorial cartoon by Thomas Nast denouncing Ku Klux Klan and White League murders of African Americans\nThe Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction and white supremacists took local control of Southern politics.[119][120] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations.[121] From 1890 to 1910, the Southern States established Jim Crow laws, disenfranchising almost all African Americans. Racial segregation was prevalent nationwide and discrimination was codified, especially in the South,[122] while well into the 20th century lynching and other forms of unjustified vigilante violence often went unprosecuted.[123][124]\n\n\nTerritorial expansion continued apace. Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.[125] Pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy; the islands were annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain following the Spanish\u2013American War.[126] Puerto Ricans did not gain citizenship either through the Foraker Act (1900) or the Insular Cases (1901), but through the Jones\u2013Shafroth Act in 1917,[127] allowing for the conscription of 20,000 Puerto Ricans, which began two months later.[128] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the Second Samoan Civil War.[129] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[130]\n\n\n\nAn Edison Studios film showing immigrants arriving at Ellis Island in New York Harbor, a major point of entry for European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries[131][132]\nFrom 1865 through 1918 an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe including Great Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, Russia, and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.[133] Most came through the port of New York City, and from 1892 specifically through the now iconic Ellis Island. New York and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[134] During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North.[135]\n\n\nRapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition.[136] Tycoons led the nation's expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, and the United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry.[137] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest, which prompted the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[138][139][140] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms.[141]\n\n\n\n### World Wars period (1914\u20131945)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1918\u20131945)\n\n![](image)The Trinity nuclear test in the Jornada del Muerto desert on July 16, 1945, part of the Manhattan Project and the first detonation of a nuclear weapon\nThe early 20th century was a time of industrial expansion and social change in the United States.[142][143] The United States entered World War I alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers.[144] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's suffrage.[145] During the 1920s and 1930s, radio for mass communication and ultimately the invention of early television transformed communications in the United States.[146] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression, which President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to with New Deal social and economic policies.[147][148]\n\n\nAt first neutral during World War II, the U.S. began supplying war materiel to the Allies of World War II in March 1941 and entered the war after the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.[149][150] The U.S. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them again the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending the war.[151][152] The United States was one of the \"Four Policemen\" who met to plan the postwar world, alongside the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China.[153][154] The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic and military influence.[155]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary United States (1945\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1945\u20131964), 1964\u20131980, 1980\u20131991, and 1991\u20132008\n\n![See caption](image)Martin Luther King Jr. delivers his \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963.\nAfter World War II, the United States entered the Cold War, where geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union led the two countries to dominate the affairs of other countries.[156] The U.S. engaged in regime change against governments perceived to be aligned with the Soviet Union, and competed in the Space Race, culminating in the first crewed Moon landing in 1969.[157][158][159][160][161] Domestically, the U.S. experienced economic growth, urbanization, and population growth following World War II.[162]\n\n\nThe civil rights movement emerged, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s.[163] The counterculture movement in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes towards what substances are acceptable for recreational drug use, sexuality[164][165] and the beginning of the modern gay rights movement as well as open defiance of the military draft and opposition to intervention in Vietnam.[166] The presidency of Richard Nixon saw the American withdrawal from Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, which led to a decline in public trust in government.[167]\n\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s saw economic stagflation and President Ronald Reagan responded with neoliberal reforms and a rollback strategy towards the Soviet Union.[168][169][170][171] By 1985, the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[172] The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War and solidified the U.S. as the world's sole superpower.[173][174][175][176]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Twin Towers in New York City during the September 11 attacks, 2001\nIn the first decades of the 21st century, the U.S. faced challenges from terrorism, with the September 11 attacks in 2001 leading to the war on terror and military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.[177][178] The U.S. housing bubble in 2006 culminated in the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis and the Great Recession, the largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.[179] Amid the financial crisis, Barack Obama, the first multiracial president, was elected in 2008.[180][181]\n\n\nPolitical polarization increased as sociopolitical debates on cultural issues dominated political discussion.[182] The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in over 100 million confirmed cases and 1 million deaths,[183] making it the most deadly pandemic in U.S. history.[184] Attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election culminated in the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol that attempted to prevent the peaceful transition of power.[185]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of the United States\n\n![](image)A topographic map of the United States\nThe United States is the world's third-largest nation by land and total area behind Russia and Canada.[c][186][187] The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470\u00a0km2).[188][189] The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way to inland forests and rolling hills in the Piedmont plateau region.[190]\n\n\nThe Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack massif separate the East Coast from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[191] The Mississippi River System\u2014the world's fourth longest river system\u2014runs mainly north\u2013south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[191]\n\n\nThe Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300\u00a0m) in Colorado.[192] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and Chihuahua, Sonoran, and Mojave deserts.[193] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast. The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[194] about 84 miles (135\u00a0km) apart.[195] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5\u00a0m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and continent.[196] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[197]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The K\u00f6ppen climate types of the United States\nMain articles: Climate of the United States and Climate change in the United States\n\nWith its large size and geographic variety, the United States includes most climate types. East of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[198] The western Great Plains are semi-arid. Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon, Washington, and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[199]\n\n\nStates bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley.[200] Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country.[201] Extreme weather became more frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s. In the American Southwest, droughts became more persistent and more severe.[202]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States\n\n![A bald eagle](image)The bald eagle, the national bird of the United States since 1782[203]\nThe U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[204] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, 295 amphibians,[205] and 91,000 insect species.[206]\n\n\nThere are 63 national parks, and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas, managed by the National Park Service and other agencies.[207] About 28% of the country's land is publicly owned and federally managed,[208] primarily in the western states.[209] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for industrial use, and less than one percent is used for military purposes.[210][211]\n\n\nEnvironmental issues in the United States include debates on non-renewable resources and nuclear energy, air and water pollution, biological diversity, logging and deforestation,[212][213] and climate change.[214][215] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency charged with addressing most environmental-related issues.[216] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[217] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides a way to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service implements and enforces the Act.[218] As of 2020, the U.S. ranked 24th among 180 nations in the Environmental Performance Index.[219] The country joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016 and has many other environmental commitments.[220]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Constitution of the United States, Politics of the United States, and Government of the United States\n\nFurther information: Political parties in the United States, Elections in the United States, Political ideologies in the United States, American patriotism, and American civil religion\n\n![](image)The Capitol and its two legislative chambers, the Senate (left) and the House of Representatives (right)\n![](image)The White House, the residence and workplace of the U.S. President and the offices of the presidential staff\n![](image)The Supreme Court Building, which houses the nation's highest court\nThe United States was founded on the principles of the American Enlightenment. It is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and several uninhabited island possessions.[221][222] It is the world's oldest surviving federation, and, according to the World Economic Forum, the oldest democracy as well.[223] It is a liberal representative democracy \"in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law.\"[224] The U.S. Constitution serves as the country's supreme legal document, establishing the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states.[225]\n\n\nThe federal government comprises three branches, which are headquartered in Washington, D.C. and regulated by a system of checks and balances.[226]\n\n\n\n* The U.S. Congress, a bicameral legislature, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse,[227] and has the power of impeachment.[228] The Senate has 100 members (2 from each state), elected for a six-year term. The House of Representatives has 435 members from single member congressional districts allocated to each state on the basis of population, elected for a two-year term.\n* The U.S. President is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies through their respective agencies.[229] The president and the vice president are elected together in a presidential election.[230] It is an indirect election, with the winner being determined by votes cast by electors of the Electoral College. The President and Vice President serve a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice.\n* The U.S. federal judiciary, whose judges are all appointed for life by the President with Senate approval, consists primarily of the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Courts of Appeals, and the U.S. District Courts. The U.S. Supreme Court interprets laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[231] The Supreme Court is led by the chief justice of the United States. It has nine members who serve for life. The members are appointed by the sitting president when a vacancy becomes available.[232]\n\n\n### Political subdivisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Political divisions of the United States, State government in the United States, Local government in the United States, and U.S. state\n\nFurther information: List of states and territories of the United States, Indian reservation, and Territories of the United States\n\nSee also: Territorial evolution of the United States\n\nIn the American federal system, sovereignty is shared between two levels of government: federal and state. Each of the 50 states has territory where it shares sovereignty with the federal government. People in the states are also represented by local elected governments, which are administrative divisions of the states. States are subdivided into counties or county equivalents, and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, the city of Washington.[233] The territories and the District of Columbia are administrative divisions of the federal government.[234]\n\n![](image)\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign policy of the United States\n\n![see caption](image)The United Nations headquarters has been situated along the East River in Midtown Manhattan since 1952; in 1945, the United States was a founding member of the UN.\nThe United States has an established structure of foreign relations, and it had the world's second-largest diplomatic corps in 2019.[235] It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,[236] and home to the United Nations headquarters.[237] The United States is a member of the G7,[238] G20,[239] and OECD intergovernmental organizations.[240] Almost all countries have embassies and many have consulates (official representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host formal diplomatic missions with the United States, except Iran,[241] North Korea,[242] and Bhutan.[243] Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close unofficial relations.[244] The United States regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression.[245]\n\n\nThe United States has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United Kingdom[246] and strong ties with Canada,[247] Australia,[248] New Zealand,[249] the Philippines,[250] Japan,[251] South Korea,[252] Israel,[253] and several European Union countries (France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Poland).[254] The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national security issues, and with nations in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Free Trade Agreement. In South America, Colombia is traditionally considered to be the closest ally of the United States.[255] The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau through the Compact of Free Association.[256] It has increasingly conducted strategic cooperation with India,[257] and its ties with China have steadily deteriorated.[258][259] Since 2014, the U.S. has become a key ally of Ukraine.[260][261]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States Armed Forces and Military history of the United States\n\n![](image)The Pentagon, the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense\nThe President is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (2.8 million), Tagalog (1.6 million), Vietnamese (1.4 million), French (1.3 million), Korean (1.1 million), and German (1 million).[366]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to the United States\n\nAmerica's immigrant population, numbering more than 50 million, is by far the world's largest in absolute terms.[367][368] In 2022, there were 87.7 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for nearly 27% of the overall U.S. population.[369] In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7\u00a0million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3\u00a0million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2\u00a0million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5\u00a0million) were unauthorized immigrants.[370] In 2019, the top countries of origin for immigrants were Mexico (24% of immigrants), India (6%), China (5%), the Philippines (4.5%), and El Salvador (3%).[371] The United States has led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.[372]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligious affiliation in USA, per Gallup, Inc. (2022)[373]\n\n\n\nProtestantism (34%)\nCatholicism (23%)\nNon-specific Christian (11%)\nMormonism (2%)\nJudaism (2%)\nOther religions (6%)\nUnaffiliated (21%)\nNo answer (1%)\n\nMain articles: Religion in the United States and Irreligion in the United States\n\nSee also: List of religious movements that began in the United States\n\nThe First Amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment.[374][375] Religious practice is widespread, among the most diverse in the world,[376] and vibrant, with the country being far more religious than other wealthy Western nations.[377] An overwhelming majority of Americans believe in a higher power,[378] engage in spiritual practices such as prayer,[379] and consider themselves religious or spiritual.[380][381] The country has the world's largest Christian population.[382] A majority of the global Jewish population lives in the United States, as measured by the Law of Return.[383]\n\n\nA 2022 *Gallup* poll found that 31% reported \"attending a church, synagogue, mosque or temple weekly or nearly weekly\".[384] Religious practice varies significantly by region.[385] In the \"Bible Belt\", located within the Southern United States, evangelical Protestantism plays a significant role culturally. New England and the Western United States tend to be less religious,[385] although Mormonism\u2014a Restorationist Christian movement started in New York in the 19th century\u2014is the predominant religious affiliation in Utah.[386]\n\n\nAround 6% of Americans claim a non-Christian faith.[387] the largest of which are Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism.[388] \"Ceremonial deism\" is common in American culture.[389] Religious belief and interest has remained relatively stable in recent years; organizational participation, in contrast, has decreased.[390] Other notable faiths include Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, many New Age movements, and a large variety of Native American religions.[391]\n\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Urbanization in the United States and List of United States cities by population\n\nAbout 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs;[186] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[392] In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston) had populations exceeding two million.[393] Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.[394]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in the United States2023 MSA population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau[395]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Region | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Region | Pop. |  |\n| ![New York](image)New York![Los Angeles](image)Los Angeles | 1 | New York | Northeast | 19,498,249 | 11 | Boston | Northeast | 4,919,179\n | ![Chicago](image)Chicago![Dallas\u2013Fort Worth](image)Dallas\u2013Fort Worth |\n| 2 | Los Angeles | West | 12,799,100 | 12 | Riverside\u2013San Bernardino | West | 4,688,053\n |\n| 3 | Chicago | Midwest | 9,262,825 | 13 | San Francisco | West | 4,566,961\n |\n| 4 | Dallas\u2013Fort Worth | South | 8,100,037 | 14 | Detroit | Midwest | 4,342,304\n |\n| 5 | Houston | South | 7,510,253 | 15 | Seattle | West | 4,044,837\n |\n| 6 | Atlanta | South | 6,307,261 | 16 | Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul | Midwest | 3,712,020\n |\n| 7 | Washington, D.C. | South | 6,304,975 | 17 | Tampa\u2013St. Petersburg | South | 3,342,963\n |\n| 8 | Philadelphia | Northeast | 6,246,160 | 18 | San Diego | West | 3,269,973\n |\n| 9 | Miami | South | 6,183,199 | 19 | Denver | West | 3,005,131\n |\n| 10 | Phoenix | West | 5,070,110 | 20 | Baltimore | South | 2,834,316\n |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Healthcare in the United States, Healthcare reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States\n\n![The Texas Medical Center, a cluster of contemporary skyscrapers, at night](image)Texas Medical Center in Houston is the largest medical complex in the world, employing 106,000 people and treating 10 million patients annually as of 2016.[396]\nIn a preliminary report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that U.S. life expectancy at birth was 76.4 years in 2021 (73.2 years for men and 79.1 years for women), down 0.9 years from 2020. The chief causes listed were the COVID-19 pandemic, accidents, drug overdoses, heart and liver disease, and suicides.[397][398] Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among Black and American Indian\u2013Alaskan Native (AIAN) peoples.[399][400] Starting in 1998, the life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' \"health disadvantage\" gap has been increasing ever since.[401] The U.S. has one of the highest suicide rates among high-income countries.[402] Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another third is overweight.[403] Poverty is the 4th leading risk factor for premature death in the United States annually, according to a 2023 study published in *JAMA*.[404][405]\n\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system far outspends that of any other nation, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP, but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer nations.[406] The United States is the only developed nation without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance.[407]\n\n\nGovernment-funded healthcare coverage for the poor (Medicaid) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. In 2010, former President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA,[o][408] with the law roughly halving the uninsured share of the population according to the CDC.[409] Its legacy remains controversial.[410]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in the United States and Higher education in the United States\n\n![Photograph of the University of Virginia](image)The University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of many public colleges and universities in the United States.\nAmerican public education is operated by state and local governments and regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of five or six (beginning with kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[411] Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[412] The basic literacy rate is near-universal.[186][413] The country has the most Nobel Prize winners in history, with 403 (having won 406 awards).[414][415]\n\n\nThe United States has many private and public institutions of higher education including many of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25.[416][417][418] There are local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.[419] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world,[420] spending an average of $12,794 per year on public elementary and secondary school students in the 2016\u20132017 school year.[421]\n\n\nAs for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[422] Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place,[423] student loan debt has increased by 102% in the last decade,[424] and exceeded 1.7\u00a0trillion dollars as of 2022.[425]\n\n\n\n## Culture and society[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of the United States and Society of the United States\n\n![The Statue of Liberty, a large teal bronze sculpture on a stone pedestal](image)The Statue of Liberty (*Liberty Enlightening the World*) on Liberty Island in New York Harbor was an 1866 gift from France that has become an iconic symbol of the American Dream.[426]\nAmericans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying political belief in an \"American creed\" emphasizing liberty, equality under the law, democracy, social equality, property rights, and a preference for limited government.[427][428] Culturally, the country has been described as having the values of individualism and personal autonomy,[429][430] having a strong work ethic,[431] competitiveness,[432] and voluntary altruism towards others.[433][434][435] According to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity, the highest in the world by a large margin.[436] Part of both the Anglosphere and Western World, the United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values,[437][438] and exerts major cultural influence on a global scale,[439][440] with the phenomenon being termed *Americanization*.[441] As such, the U.S. is considered a cultural superpower.[442]\n\n\nNearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from Eurafrasia (\"the Old World\") within the past five centuries.[443] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[437][444] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture.[437] The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[445] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[446][447][448][449] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[450] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[451] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well.[452]\n\n\nThe United States is considered to have the strongest protections of free speech of any country under the First Amendment,[453] which protects flag desecration, hate speech, blasphemy, and lese-majesty as forms of protected expression.[454][455][456] A 2016 Pew Research Center poll found that Americans were the most supportive of free expression of any polity measured.[457] They are the \"most supportive of freedom of the press and the right to use the Internet without government censorship.\"[458] It is a socially progressive country[459] with permissive attitudes surrounding human sexuality.[460] LGBT rights in the United States are among the most advanced in the world.[460][461][462]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: American literature and American philosophy\n\n![Photograph of Mark Twain](image)Mark Twain, who William Faulkner called \"the father of American literature\"[463]\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of their cues from Europe. Writers such as Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is recognized as an essential American poet.[464]\n\n\nAlmost until the 20th century pervasive anti-literacy laws prevented most people of color from learning to read or write.[465][466] In the 1920s, the New Negro Movement coalesced in Harlem, where many writers had migrated from the Southern United States and West Indies. Its pan-African perspective was a significant cultural export during the Jazz Age in Paris and as such was a key early influence on the *n\u00e9gritude* philosophy.[467]\n\n\nSince its first use in the 19th century, the term \"Great American Novel\" has been applied to many books, including Herman Melville's *Moby-Dick* (1851), Harriet Beecher Stowe's *Uncle Tom's Cabin* (1852), Twain's *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby* (1925), John Steinbeck's *The Grapes of Wrath* (1939), Harper Lee's *To Kill a Mockingbird* (1960), Toni Morrison's *Beloved* (1987), and David Foster Wallace's *Infinite Jest* (1996).[468][469][470]\n\n\nThirteen U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Louise Gl\u00fcck, Bob Dylan, and Toni Morrison.[471] Earlier laureates William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck have been recognized as influential 20th century writers.[472]\n\n\n\n### Mass media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mass media in the United States\n\nSee also: Newspapers in the United States, Television in the United States, Internet in the United States, Radio in the United States, and Video games in the United States\n\n![](image)Comcast Center in Philadelphia, headquarters of Comcast, the world's largest telecommunications and media conglomerate\nThe four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[473] As of 2021[update], about 83% of Americans over age 12 listen to broadcast radio, while about 41% listen to podcasts.[474] As of September\u00a030, 2014[update], there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[475] Much of the public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR, incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.[476]\n\n\nGlobally-recognized newspapers in the United States include *The Wall Street Journal*, *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, and *USA Today*.[477] More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.[478][479] With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as *The Village Voice* in New York City and *LA Weekly* in Los Angeles. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are Google, YouTube, Amazon, Yahoo, and Facebook, with all of them being American companies.[480]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the video game market of the United States is the world's largest by revenue.[481] Major video game publishers and developers headquartered in the United States are Sony Interactive Entertainment, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda Softworks, Epic Games, Valve, Warner Bros., Riot Games, and others.[482][483] There are 444 publishers, developers, and hardware companies in California alone.[484]\n\n\n\n### Theater[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Theater in the United States\n\n![](image)Broadway theatres in Theater District, Manhattan, New York City\nThe United States is well known for its cinema and theater. Mainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the British theater.[485] In the 19th century, America had created new dramatic forms in the Tom Shows, the showboat theater and the minstrel show.[486]\n\n\nThe central hub of the American theater scene is Manhattan, with its divisions of Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway.[487] Many movie and television stars have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater has an active community theater culture.[488]\n\n\nAlthough earlier styles of theater such as minstrel shows and Vaudeville acts have disappeared from the landscape,[489] theater still remains a popular contemporary American art form. Broadway productions still entertain millions of theatergoers even as productions have become more elaborate and expensive.[490] The Theater District is an internationally prominent tourist attraction in New York City. According to The Broadway League, for the 2018\u201319 season total attendance was 14,768,254 and $1,829,312,140 in grosses.[491]\n\n\nThe Tony Awards recognizes excellence in live Broadway theatre and are presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League[492] at an annual ceremony in Manhattan. The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for regional theatre. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award.[493]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of the United States\n\n![](image)The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee\nAmerican folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles, Mainland Europe, or Africa.[494]\n\n\nThe rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have significantly influenced American music at large. The Smithsonian Institution states, \"African-American influences are so fundamental to American music that there would be no American music without them.\"[495] One instrument first mass-produced in the United States was the banjo, which had originally been crafted from gourds covered by animal skins by African slaves.[496][497] Banjos became widely popular in the 19th century due to their use in minstrel shows.[496] Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century.[498]\n\n\nThe United States has the world's largest music market with a total retail value of $4.9 billion in 2014.[499] Most of the world's major record companies are based in the U.S.; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[500] Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the pioneers of rock and roll in the mid-1950s. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing musical acts in worldwide sales.[501][502][503] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of the country's most celebrated songwriters.[504] Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra,[505] and Elvis Presley became global celebrities,[498] as have artists of the late 20th century, such as Prince, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey,[506][507] and of the early 21th century, such as Beyonc\u00e9, Taylor Swift, and Lady Gaga.[508] The musical forms of punk and hip hop both originated in the United States.[509] American professional opera singers have reached the highest level of success in that form, including Ren\u00e9e Fleming, Leontyne Price, Beverly Sills, Nelson Eddy, and many others.[510]\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Visual art of the United States and Architecture of the United States\n\n![](image)*Nighthawks* (1942) by Edward Hopper is one of his best-known works, Art Institute of Chicago.\nIn the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[511] Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles, which would become known as American modernism. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, James Van Der Zee, Ansel Adams, and Gordon Parks.[512]\n\n\nThe uniquely American \"Chicago School\" refers to two architectural styles derived from the architecture of Chicago. In the history of architecture, the first Chicago School was a school of architects active in Chicago in the late 19th, and at the turn of the 20th century. They were among the first to promote the new technologies of steel-frame construction in commercial buildings, and developed a spatial aesthetic which co-evolved with, and then came to influence, parallel developments in European modernism. Much of its early work is known as \"Commercial Style\".[513] A \"Second Chicago School\" with a modernist aesthetic emerged in the 1940s through 1970s, which pioneered new building technologies and structural systems, such as the tube-frame structure.[514] The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[515]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of the United States\n\n![](image)The iconic Hollywood Sign, in the Hollywood Hills, often regarded as the symbol of the American film industry\nThe U.S. film industry has a worldwide influence and following. Hollywood, a district in northern Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, is the leader in motion picture production and the most recognizable movie industry in the world.[516][517][518] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket-selling movies in the world.[519][520] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[521] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[522] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[523]\n\n\nDirector D. W. Griffith's film adaptation of *The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan* was the first American blockbuster, earning the equivalent of $1.8 billion in current dollars. The technical achievements of the film revolutionized film grammar, while its subject matter caused both strident protest and a revitalization of the Klan.[524] Producer and entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[525] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[526] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[527][528] In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\"[529] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[530] The 21st century has been marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, and Apple TV+, which came to rival traditional cinema.[531][532]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American cuisine\n\nFurther information: List of American regional and fusion cuisines\n\n![](image)A bacon cheeseburger served with french fries, fried onions and ketchup\nEarly settlers were introduced by Native Americans to such indigenous, non-European foods as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash. Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they had known, such as wheat flour,[533] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[534][535] New World crops, especially corn and potatoes, and the native turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when many Americans make or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[536]\n\n\nCharacteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[537][538][539][540] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.[541]\n\n\nThe American fast food industry, the world's first and largest, pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s[542] and is often viewed as being a symbol of U.S. marketing dominance. Companies such as McDonald's,[543] Burger King, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Domino's Pizza, among others, have numerous outlets around the world,[544]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in the United States\n\nSee also: Professional sports leagues in the United States, National Collegiate Athletic Association, and United States at the Olympics\n\n![](image)American football is the most popular sport in the United States; in this September 2022 National Football League game, the Jacksonville Jaguars play the Washington Commanders at FedExField.\nThe most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey, according to a 2017 *Gallup* poll.[545] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide.[546] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[547] The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69\u00a0billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[548]\n\n\nAmerican football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[549] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[550] Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball being the top league. Basketball, soccer and ice hockey are the country's next three most popular professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League, which are the premier leagues worldwide for these sports. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[551][552]\n\n\nOn the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[553] and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA Final Four is one of the most watched national sporting events.[554] In many respects, the intercollegiate sports level serves as a feeder system to the professional level, as the elite college athletes are chosen to compete at the next level. This system differs greatly from nearly all other countries in the world, which generally have government-funded sports organizations that serve as a feeder system for professional competition.[555]\n\n\nEight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[556] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,959 medals (1,173 gold) at the Olympic Games, by far the most of any country.[557][558][559]\n\n\nIn international soccer, the men's national soccer team qualified for eleven World Cups, and the women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each.[560] The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[561]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lists of U.S. state topics\n* Outline of the United States\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 30 of 50 states recognize only English as an official language.

By total area (land and water), it is the third-largest behind Russia and Canada, if its coastal and territorial water areas are included. However, if only its internal waters are included (bays, sounds, rivers, lakes, and the Great Lakes), the U.S. is the fourth-largest, after Russia, Canada, and China.\n  \n\n  \n\nCoastal/territorial waters included: 3,796,742\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (9,833,517\u00a0km2)[18]\n  \n\nOnly internal waters included: 3,696,100\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (9,572,900\u00a0km2)[19]\n4. **^**  Excludes Puerto Rico and the other unincorporated islands because they are counted separately in U.S. census statistics.\n5. **^** After adjustment for taxes and transfers\n6. **^**  See Time in the United States for details about laws governing time zones in the United States.\n7. **^** See Date and time notation in the United States.\n8. **^**  A single jurisdiction, the U.S. Virgin Islands, uses left-hand traffic.\n9. **^** The five major territories are American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands.

Such occurrences have been reported in many countries throughout history.[1] One hypothesis is that tornadic waterspouts sometimes pick up creatures such as fish or frogs, and carry them for up to several miles.[1][2] However, this aspect of the phenomenon has never been witnessed by scientists.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nRain of flightless animals and things has been reported throughout history.[1] In the first century AD, Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder documented storms of frogs and fish.[4] In 1794, French soldiers saw toads fall from the sky during heavy rain at Lalain, near the French city of Lille.[5] Rural inhabitants in Yoro, Honduras claim \"fish rain\" happens there every summer, a phenomenon they call Lluvia de Peces.[6]\n\n\n\n## Explanations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tornadoes and waterspouts may lift up animals into the air and deposit them miles away\nFrench physicist Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re (1775\u20131836) was among the first scientists to take seriously accounts of raining animals. Addressing the Society of Natural Science, Amp\u00e8re suggested that at times frogs and toads roam the countryside in large numbers, and that violent winds could pick them up and carry them great distances.[3]\n\n\nAfter a reported rain of fish in Singapore in 1861, French naturalist Francis de Laporte de Castelnau speculated that a migration of walking catfish had taken place, dragging themselves over land from one puddle to another, following the rain.[7]\n\n\nThe likeliest explanation for many of the supposed cases is that there is no falling happening at all and the animals are driven along by winds or a deluge of some sort.[8] This explanation also accounts for the prevalence of reports that only a single species or type of animal is ever reported raining from the sky.\n\n\nA current scientific hypothesis involves tornadic waterspouts: a tornado that forms over the water.[1][9][10][11] Under this hypothesis, a tornadic waterspout transports animals to relatively high altitudes, carrying them over large distances. This hypothesis appears supported by the type of animals in these rains: small and light, usually aquatic,[12] and by the suggestion that the rain of animals is often preceded by a storm. However, the theory does not account for how all the animals involved in each individual incident would be from only one species, and not a group of similarly sized animals from a single area.[13] Further, the theory also does not account for a genuine tornadic waterspout not actually sucking objects up and carrying them rather than flinging objects out to the sides.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Doppler Image from Texas showing the collision of a thunderstorm with a group of bats in flight. The color red indicates the animals flying into the storm.\nIn the case of birds, storms may overcome a flock in flight, especially in times of migration. The Doppler image to the right shows an example wherein a group of bats is overtaken by a thunderstorm.[15] In the image, the bats are in the red zone, which corresponds to winds moving away from the radar station, and enter into a mesocyclone associated with a tornado (in green). These events may occur easily with birds, which can get killed in flight, or stunned and then fall (unlike flightless creatures, which first have to be lifted into the air by an outside force). Sometimes this happens in large groups, for instance, the blackbirds falling from the sky in Beebe, Arkansas, United States on December 31, 2010.[16] It is common for birds to become disoriented (for example, because of bad weather or fireworks) and collide with objects such as trees or buildings, killing them or stunning them into falling to their death. The number of blackbirds killed in Beebe is not spectacular considering the size of their congregations, which can be in the millions.[17] The event in Beebe, however, captured the imagination and led to more reports in the media of birds falling from the sky across the globe, such as in Sweden and Italy,[18] though many scientists claim such mass deaths are common occurrences but usually go unnoticed.[19] In contrast, it is harder to find a plausible explanation for rains of terrestrial animals.\n\n\nSome cases are thought to be caused by birds dropping fish. With regard to a documented rain of fish that occurred on December 29, 2021 in Texarkana, Texas, independent researchers Sharon A. Hill and Paul Cropper proposed that the fish had been dropped or possibly regurgitated by passing birds.[20] The theory found some favor with airport workers who had cleaned up the fish; they noted that there were birds in the area around the same time, and the fish \"were kind of chewed up\". In June 2022 around the San Francisco coast, a boom of anchovies is likely to be the cause of fair weather falling of fish from birds' mouths, such as pelicans.[21]\n\n\n\n## Occurrences[edit]\n\n\nThe following list is a selection of examples.\n\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1555 engraving of rain of fish\n* Singapore, February 22, 1861[22]\n* Tarai, Nepal, May 15, 1900[23]\n* Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada, July 1, 1903[24]\n* Marksville, Louisiana, October 23, 1947[25]\n* Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria, May 19, 1993\n* Knighton, Powys, Wales, 18 August 2004[26]\n* Kerala State, India, February 12, 2008[27]\n* Bhanwad, Jamnagar, India, October 24, 2009[28]\n* Lajamanu, Northern Territory, Australia, February 25 and 26, 2010[29]\n* Loreto, Agusan del Sur, Philippines, January 13, 2012[30][31]\n* IIT Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India September 12, 2013[32]\n* The annual Lluvia de Peces in Yoro, Honduras\n* Chilaw, Sri Lanka, 6 May 2014[33]\n* Nandigama, Andhra Pradesh India, 19 June 2015,[34]\n* Guntur, Andhra Pradesh India, 16 August 2015[35]\n* Dire Dawa, Ethiopia, 20 January 2016[36]\n* Pathapatnam, Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh, 19 May 2016[37]\n* Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 9 September 2016[38]\n* Mexico, Tamaulipas, Tampico, 26 September 2017[39]\n* Oroville, California, 16 May 2017[40]\n* Jaffna, Sri Lanka, 7 November 2017[41]\n* Texarkana, Texas, 30 December 2021[42]\n\n\n### Spiders[edit]\n\n\n* Albury, Australia, 1974[43]\n* Santo Ant\u00f4nio da Platina, Brazil, February 3, 2013[44]\n* Goulburn, Australia, 15 May 2015[43]\n\n\n### Frogs and toads[edit]\n\n\n* Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan, June 2009 (occurrences reported throughout the month)[45]\n* R\u00e1k\u00f3czifalva, Hungary, 18\u201320 June 2010 (twice)[46]\n* Cabo Polonio, Uruguay, Since 2011 (twice)[47]\n\n\n### Others[edit]\n\n\n* Jellyfish: Bath, England, 1894[48]\n* Worms: Jennings, Louisiana, July 11, 2007[49]\n* Various marine animals, including octopuses, seashells and starfish: Qingdao, Shandong Province, China, June 13, 2018[50]\n\n\n## Examples in popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* *Magnolia*\n* *Sharknado (film series)*\n* *Watchmen (TV series)*\n* *Good Omens (book and in the title sequence of Amazon Prime video series)*\n* *Fuego gris* (also here: at the article's Spanish version).\n* *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 6: Stone Ocean (manga/anime series)*\n* *The Sarah Jane Adventures, series 5, episode 2, The Curse of Clyde Langer*\n* Fargo (TV series)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Blood rain\n* Flying fish\n* Kentucky meat shower\n* Lluvia de Peces, (Honduras, \"Fish rain\")\n* Raining cats and dogs\n* Red rain in Kerala\n* Star jelly\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Can it rain frogs, fish or other objects\". *Library of Congress*. 26 August 2010.\n2. **^** How can it rain fish?

The country is secular and the freedom of religion is enshrined in the nation's constitution.\n\n\nThe pre-Hispanic peoples that lived in actual Honduras were primarily polytheistic Maya and other native groups. In the 16th century, Roman Catholicism was introduced by the Spanish Empire and still holds a 46% share of the population. Protestantism accounts for 41% of the country's population.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Ancient religion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mayan God Chaac in Copan sculpture museum\nThe Maya religion was the ancient one. It was practiced a lot in the timeline of the 4th and 7th century, AD. It was practiced in some parts of Central and South America, and it was based on polytheistic beliefs and had to do with a big number of rituals with occasional animals and maybe even human sacrifices. [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Post-colonial religion[edit]\n\n\nThe second Roman Catholic Mass celebrated in the continental New World was on August 13, 1502, in Punta Caxinas, two weeks after the so-called \"discovery\" of Honduras by Christopher Columbus.[2][3] Thereafter, the Spanish began a process of converting and baptizing Honduran natives to the Catholic faith.\n\n\nHonduras holds a small part of the former Mosquito Coast which came under British influence\u2014now in the extreme southeast of the state. Protestant churches gained following in that sparsely populated area on the Caribbean coast, especially Anglicanism and the Moravian Church.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cathedral of Saint Michael the Archangel\nIn recent years, the principal religious groups are Roman Catholic, Episcopal, Lutheran, Jehovah's Witness, Mennonite, approximately 300 evangelical Protestant groups, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and well as communities of Muslims, Jews and Baha'is.[4]\n\n\nThe Catholic Church in Honduras is composed of eight dioceses: Tegucigalpa, Comayagua, Choluteca, Olancho, Yoro, San Pedro Sula, Trujillo and Cop\u00e1n which are a part of the Conference Episcopal of Honduras.\n\n\nThe Protestant churches are structured by three confederacies: The Pastors' Association of Honduras, the Evangelical Brotherhood of Honduras and the Apostolic Network of Honduras.\n\n\nBoth the Roman Catholic Church as well as the Protestant churches, especially the Pentecostal denominations, have experienced growth thanks in large part to modern forms of mass communication in recent decades.\n\n\nThe LDS Church built a temple in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, making it one of the six LDS temples in Central America.\n\n\nThe most prominent evangelical churches in the country include the \"Abundant Life\", the \"Living Love\", and the Great Commission Churches.[4] A growing number of evangelical churches have no denominational affiliation.[4] The National Association of Evangelical Pastors represents the evangelical leadership.[5] San Pedro Sula has a mosque and a synagogue, and Tegucigalpa has a synagogue.[5]\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2020 survey, CID-Gallup reported that 48% of the population identifies as evangelical Protestant and 34% as Roman Catholic; Catholic Church officials, however, state that 75% of the population is Catholic.[4]\n\n\nLocal religious leaders state that there are approximately 7000 Muslims (mostly Sunni), 1000 Baha\u2019is and 150 Jews.[4]\n\n\n\n## Religious freedom[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Colonial Roman Catholic church in Duyure, Honduras\n![](image)Roman catholic church of San Juan in Ojojona, Honduras\nThe constitution of Honduras establishes the freedom of religion. The National Congress of Honduras has the power to legally recognize religious groups, which confers to them tax-exempt status and other privileges. The Catholic Church is the only organization legally recognized as a religious group, although other religious groups can register with the government as NGOs. Some religious groups have criticized this as constituting preferential treatment for the Catholic Church at the expense of other groups.[6]\n\n\nThe constitution prohibits religious leaders from holding elected office or publicly making political statements. Despite this, some Protestant pastors have been elected to government positions and serve on government advisory bodies. The government also frequently includes Catholic or Protestant prayers as part of official events and ceremonies, which has been criticized by representatives of other religious groups.[6]\n\n\nClergy are provided exemptions from being required to testify in court about information acquired from religious confessions. Vicars, bishops, and archbishops of the Catholic Church, as well as similarly high-ranking members of other religions, are not required to appear in court if subpoenaed, although they are required to make a statement for the court.[4]\n\n\nPublic schools do not teach religion but, private schools may include religion on their curricula if they wish.[4]\n\n\nForeign missionaries must register with the government. Some religious groups have reached agreements with the government to expedite this process;[4] however, some groups have noted difficulties in obtaining visas for longer than six months. \n\n\nConscientious objection to military service is protected by law, including objection on religious grounds.[6]\n\n\nSome politicians, generally from opposition parties, have regularly used antisemitism rhetoric in their political statements.[6][*dead link*]\n\n\nIn 2023, the country was scored 4 out of 4 for religious freedom according to Freedom House.[7]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Islam in Honduras\n* Roman Catholicism in Honduras\n* Virgin of Suyapa, perhaps Honduras' most popular religious image.\n* Religion in Latin America\n* ![flag](image) Honduras portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Catholic Apathy Leads To Growth Of Evangelical Christian Churches In Latin America\". *Ken on Threats*. 2022-11-16.

Divisions, according to 2012 census.\nSri Lanka is officially a Buddhist country, while Sri Lankans practice a variety of religions. As of the 2012 census, 70.2% of Sri Lankans were Buddhists, 12.6% were Hindus, 9.7% were Muslims (mainly Sunni), 7.4% were Christians (mostly Catholics).[1][2] Buddhism is declared as the State religion of Sri Lanka and has been given special privileges in the Sri Lankan constitution such as the government is bound for protection and fostering of Buddhist Dharma throughout the nation.[3][4] However, the constitution also provides for freedom of religion and right to equality among all its citizens. In 2008 Sri Lanka was the third most religious country in the world according to a Gallup poll, with 99% of Sri Lankans saying religion is an important part of their daily life.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Distribution of religious groups[edit]\n\n\nThe census 2001 covered 18 districts only. The district percentages shown are from 2001 census except where the numbers are italic, which are from 1981 census. Population movements have occurred after 1981, and accurate statistics did not exist for districts which were not covered in 2001 census until the 2011 census.[6]\n\n\n\n* Data from the 2011 census\n* ![Buddhists](image)\n\nBuddhists\n* ![Hindus](image)\n\nHindus\n* ![Muslims](image)\n\nMuslims\n* ![Christians](image)\n\nChristians\n\n\n\n### Religion by Province[edit]\n\n\n\n\nReligion by Province in Sri Lanka [1]\n| Province\n | Buddhism | %\n | Hinduism | %\n | Islam | %\n | Christianity | %\n | Others\n | %\n | Total\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Central Province | 1,672,625\n | 65.05%\n | 540,339\n | 21.01%\n | 263,874\n | 10.26%\n | 94,402\n | 3.67%\n | 317\n | 0.01%\n | 2,571,557\n | 100%\n |\n| Eastern Province | 354,772\n | 22.87%\n | 539,570\n | 34.78%\n | 575,936\n | 37.12%\n | 80,801\n | 5.21%\n | 302\n | 0.02%\n | 1,551,381\n | 100%\n |\n| North Central Province | 1,139,595\n | 90%\n | 10,117\n | 0.79%\n | 101,958\n | 8.03%\n | 14,875\n | 1.17%\n | 188\n | 0.01%\n | 1,266,663\n | 100%\n |\n| Northern Province | 30,387\n | 2.87%\n | 789,362\n | 74.56%\n | 34,040\n | 3.22%\n | 204,005\n | 19.27%\n | 968\n | 0.09%\n | 1,058,762\n | 100%\n |\n| North Western Province | 1,761,337\n | 73.98%\n | 43,532\n | 1.83%\n | 268,709\n | 11.28%\n | 305,951\n | 12.85%\n | 1,332\n | 0.06%\n | 2,380,861\n | 100%\n |\n| Sabaragamuwa Province | 1,653,381\n | 85.73%\n | 156,312\n | 8.1%\n | 85,610\n | 4.44%\n | 33,219\n | 1.72%\n | 133\n | 0.006%\n | 1,928,655\n | 100%\n |\n| Southern Province | 2,345,314\n | 94.68%\n | 33,227\n | 1.34%\n | 80,085\n | 3.23%\n | 18,201\n | 0.73%\n | 458\n | 0.02%\n | 2,477,285\n | 100%\n |\n| Uva Province | 1,018,561\n | 80.43%\n | 169,605\n | 13.39%\n | 57,001\n | 4.5%\n | 21,095\n | 1.66%\n | 201\n | 0.02%\n | 1,266,463\n | 100%\n |\n| Western Province | 4,088,797\n | 70.67%\n | 274,336\n | 4.71%\n | 709,992\n | 10.81%\n | 752,993\n | 12.93%\n | 4,592\n | 0.08%\n | 5,830,710\n | 100%\n |\n\n\n## Buddhism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Buddhism in Sri Lanka\n\n![](image)Exterior of the sacred temple of the Tooth in Kandy.\nTheravada Buddhism is the official religion of Sri Lanka, with about 70.2% of the country's population as followers. Arahath Mahinda, son of Indian Buddhist emperor Ashoka, led the mission to Sri Lanka in 246 BCE when he converted the Sri Lankan king, Devanampiya Tissa, to Buddhism. Arahath Sanghamitra, daughter of King Ashoka, brought a sapling of the Bodhi tree in Buddha Gaya to Sri Lanka. She also established the Order of Nuns in Sri Lanka. The Sapling of the Bodhi tree, known as Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi was planted in the Mahameghavana Park in Anuradhapura by the King Devanampiya Tissa.\n\n\nFrom then on, the royal families had helped to encourage the spread of Buddhism, aiding Buddhist missionaries and building monasteries. Around 200 BCE, Buddhism became the official religion of Sri Lanka. The Sacred Tooth Relic was brought to Sri Lanka in 4th century by Prince Danta and Princess Hemamala. Sri Lanka has the longest continuous history of Buddhism of any Buddhist nation. During the periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contacts with Myanmar and Thailand. Later on, however, Hindu invasions and European colonial influences contributed to the decline of Buddhism in Sri Lanka.\n\n\nBut during the last period of the European colonial period and the post-colonial period, Buddhism has gained a growth in Sri Lanka. Buddhism was 61.57% in 1881 in Sri Lanka. Buddhism has increased to 70.2% in Sri Lanka when it's 2012.[7]\n\n\nIn the mid 18th century the higher ordination of Buddhist monks known as Upasampada, which was defunct at the time, was revived with the help of Siamese Buddhist monks on the initiatives taken by Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero during the reign of king Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy. By the mid-19th century, Buddhist leaders such as Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera, Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera, Colonel Henry Steel Olcott and Anagarika Dharmapala started a successful national Buddhist movement for the revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuddhism in Sri Lanka 1881-2012[8][1]\n| Year\n | Buddhism | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1881 census[9] | 1,698,100\n | 61.57%\n |\n| 1891 census[10] | 1,877,000\n | 62.40%\n |\n| 1901 census[11] | 2,141,400\n | 60.06%\n |\n| 1911 census[12] | 2,474,200\n | 60.25%\n |\n| 1921 census[13] | 2,769,800\n | 61.57%\n |\n| 1931 census[14] | 3,266,600\n | 61.55%\n |\n| 1946 Estimation[15] | 4,294,900\n | 64.51%\n |\n| 1953 census[16] | 5,209,400\n | 64.33%\n |\n| 1963 census[17] | 7,003,300\n | 66.18%\n |\n| 1971 census[18] | 8,536,868\n | 67.27%\n |\n| 1981 census[19] | 10,288,325\n | 69.30%\n |\n| 2012 census[1][19] | 14,272,056\n | 70.20%\n |\n\n\n## Hinduism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Ravana at Koneswaram Temple.\nMain article: Hinduism in Sri Lanka\n\nHindus make up 12.6% of Sri Lanka's population.[2] Hinduism was practiced by Native Kings before their conversion to Buddhism. The origins of the religion are linked to early Tamil immigration into the island since the Chola conquests in the 10th century or even earlier with the Saivite devotional movement that swept South India.\n\n\nHinduism in Sri Lanka is largely identified with the Tamil population and is concentrated in the Northern, Eastern and Central Provinces. The population declined since the 1981 census on account of Sri Lankan Tamil emigration overseas and the repatriation of 'Indian' Tamils.\n\n\nA significant Hindu religious figure in Sri Lankan modern history is Satguru Siva Yogaswami of Jaffna. One of the mystics of the 20th century, Yogaswami was the official satguru and counseling sage of Lanka's several million Tamil Hindu population. The Ramakrishna Mission is somewhat active in the Amparai and Batticaloa districts while the Shaiva Siddhanta school of philosophy of Shaivism sect of Hinduism is prevalent in the North of Sri Lanka. Yogaswami belonged to the Shaiva Siddhanta and he was 161st head of the Nandinatha Sampradaya. The next person in the line of succession after Yogaswami was Sivaya Subramuniyaswami.[20]\n\n\n\n## Islam[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Meeran Mosque in Galle.\nMain article: Islam in Sri Lanka\n\nBy the 7th century, Arab traders had controlled much of the trade on the Indian Ocean, including that of Sri Lanka's. Many of these traders settled down in Sri Lanka, encouraging the spread of Islam. However, when the Portuguese arrived at Sri Lanka during the 16th century, many of the Arabs' Muslim descendants were persecuted, thus forcing them to migrate to the Central Highlands and to the east coast.\n\n\nIn modern times, Muslims in Sri Lanka have the Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs Department, which was established in the 1980s to prevent the continual isolation of the Muslim community from the rest of Sri Lanka. Today, about 9.7% of Sri Lankans adhere to Islam;[2] mostly from the Moor and Malay ethnic communities on the island.\n\n\n\n## Christianity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)St. Sebastian's Church in Negombo.\nMain article: Christianity in Sri Lanka\n\nAccording to a Christian tradition, Christianity was introduced by Thomas the Apostle in Sri Lanka (as well as India) during the 1st century. The first evidence of Christianity in Sri Lanka is the account in the 6th-century *Christian Topography*, which says a community of Persian Nestorians lived on the island. The Anuradhapura cross, discovered in 1912, is probably a relic of this community. However, the population of Christians in Sri Lanka didn't dramatically increase until the arrival of Portuguese missionaries during the 15th century. In the 17th century, the Dutch took over Sri Lanka and Dutch missionaries were able to convert 21% of Sri Lanka's population to Christianity by 1622.\n\n\nIn 1796 the Dutch were displaced by the British and in 1802 Ceylon became a Crown colony. Anglican and other Protestant missionaries arrived at Sri Lanka during the early 19th century, when the British took control of Sri Lanka from the Dutch. Under British rule missionary work was undertaken by English societies: Baptist, Wesleyan Methodist, the CMS and SPG.[21] The Salvation Army and Jehovah's Witnesses are also present in Sri Lanka.\n\n\nThe percentage of Christians has slowly declined from the height of 13% in 1891 they were 12.6% and numbered were 302,000. In 2012 they 7.4%. By the 1980s, the population of Christians was mostly concentrated in the northwest of Sri Lanka and in the capital where they are 10% of the population. Of these Christians, over 80% are Roman Catholics while the rest are predominantly Anglicans, Methodists and other Protestants.\n\n\n\n## Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith[edit]\n\n\nAdherents of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith have been present in Sri Lanka since 1949. The first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed resident in Colombo was a physician from India, M.E. Lukmani. Its population grew in the 1950s and by 1962, its first administrative body for the national level (the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds of Sri Lanka) was elected.[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)Distribution of languages and religious groups of Sri Lanka by D.S. divisions and sector level, according to the 1981 census.\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* History of Sri Lanka\n* Freedom of religion in Sri Lanka\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"A3\u00a0: Population by religion according to districts, 2012\". *Census of Population & Housing, 2011*.

In the 2021 national census, 43.9% of Australians identified with Christianity and 38.9% declared \"no religion\".\n\n\nAustralia has no official religion. Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia states: \"The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.\"\n\n\nThe Christian festivals of Easter and Christmas are public holidays.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe Aboriginal peoples of Australia traditionally followed a set of beliefs known as The Dreaming; some of the earliest evidence on earth for religious practices among humans has been found in the archaeological record of their ancestors.[*citation needed*] Torres Strait Islander religion bore similarities to broader Melanesian spirituality.\n\n\nChristianity came to Australia in 1788 with British colonial settlement.[4] Of the convicts and free settlers, most were members of the established Church of England with lesser numbers of Nonconformist Protestants, Catholics and other faiths. The first religious census in 1828 divided the early colony into four groups: Protestants, Catholics, Jews and Pagans.[5]\n\n\nOther smaller groups also arrived and established their churches. Jews started arriving in the early 19th century. The Australian gold rushes brought in workers from China and the Pacific islands, as well as specialised workers from British India, such as the mainly Muslim \"Afghan Cameleers\".\n\n\n\n### Indigenous Australian religion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Stolen Generations\n\n![](image)Kolaia man wearing a headdress worn in a fire ceremony, Forrest River, Western Australia\nDreaming (spirituality) has been practised for tens of thousands of years. It is at once a collection of stories of an ancient view of creation and present day spirituality. It places significant emphasis on belonging to the land. It shaped and continues to shape Aboriginal law and customs; and Aboriginal art, story and dance continue to draw on these spiritual traditions.\n\n\nThere is evidence of contact between indigenous Australians with colonisers, fishermen, and survivors of numerous shipwrecks from peoples of various non-Indigenous cultures and faiths prior to British colonisation. Indigenous Australians of (Arnhem Land) (in Northern Australia) retain stories, songs and paintings of trade and cultural interaction with sea-faring peoples from the north, generally regarded as being from the east Indonesian archipelago.[6] There is some evidence of Islamic terms and concepts entering northern Aboriginal cultures via these interactions.[7][8] (See: Macassan contact with Australia.)\n\n\n\n![](image)Hermannsburg Aboriginal Mission, Northern Territory\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Richard Johnson, Anglican priest and chaplain to the First Fleet\nWhile the Church of England originally held a position of privilege in early colonial Australia, a legal framework guaranteeing religious equality evolved within a few decades,[9] especially when the Church of England was disestablished in the colony of New South Wales by the *Church Act of 1836*. Drafted by the reformist attorney-general John Plunkett,[10] the act established legal equality for Anglicans, Catholics and Presbyterians, and was later extended to Methodists. British Nonconformist Methodist, Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Baptists set up their own churches in the 19th century, as did Lutherans from Germany.[11][12]\n\n\nLarge numbers of Irish Catholics were transported to Australia through the British criminal justice system.[13] Religious tensions, largely fuelled by historical grievances between Catholics and other Christians, continued into the 20th century.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scot's Church, Melbourne, c.\u20091880\nThe gold rush of the 1850s led to significantly increased immigration and diversity of religious traditions, such as Irish Catholicism, Scottish Presbyterianism, and more English Anglicanism, among other religious traditions.\n\n\nAustralian Aboriginal peoples suffered a decline during this period as they were dispossessed of their lands; and diseases spread among their populations. Christian churches organised missions during this period, intended to \"civilise\" Aboriginal communities and spread Christianity. The overall consequences of this activity contributed to the decline of indigenous languages and beliefs, the extent to which are still being determined and recorded.\n\n\nBy 1901, apart from the indigenous population and descendants of gold rush migrants, Australian society was predominantly Anglo-Celtic, with 40% of the population being Anglican, 23% Catholic, 34% other Christian and about 1% professing non-Christian religions.[15] There was a Lutheran population of German descent in South Australia.\n\n\nFreedom of Religion was enshrined in Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia of 1901.\n\n\n\n### Other religions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Perth Shiva Temple, Perth, Western Australia\n![](image)19th century mosque, Bourke, New South Wales\n![](image)Phap Hoa Vietnamese Buddhist temple, Adelaide, South Australia\nThere were at least 15 Jews in the First Fleet, 14 convicts and one \"free\" child.[16]\n\n\nThe Tolpuddle Martyrs were sentenced to penal transportation to Australia because friendly societies had strong elements of what are now considered to be the predominant role of trade unions.[17]\n\n\nAs noted above, the Australian gold rushes brought in workers from China and the Pacific islands, as well as specialised workers from British India such as, from the 1860s onwards, the mainly Muslim \"Afghan Cameleers\". From the 1870s Malay divers were recruited (with most subsequently repatriated). Before 1901, some Muslim sailors and prisoners came to Australia on convict ships. \n\n\nIn 1901, the government passed an act limiting immigration to those of European descent in what came to be known as the White Australia Policy. By effectively limiting the immigration of practitioners of different faiths, this policy ensured that Christianity remained the religion of the overwhelming majority of Australians for the foreseeable future and, indeed, to the present day. The first census in 1911 showed 96% identified themselves as Christian.[18] Sectarian tensions continued into the 1960s; e.g. job vacancy advertisements sometimes stated \"Protestant preferred\" or that \"Catholics need not apply\".[4] Nevertheless, Australia elected its first Catholic prime minister, James Scullin, in 1929, and in 1930 Sir Isaac Isaacs, an Australian-born Jew, was appointed Governor-General.[19][20]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Demography of Australia\n\nA question on religion has been asked in every census taken in Australia, with the voluntary nature of this question having been specifically stated since 1933. In 1971, the instruction \"if no religion, write none\" was introduced. This saw a sevenfold increase from the previous census year in the percentage of Australians stating they had no religion. Since 1971, this percentage has progressively increased to 38.9% in 2021.\n\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2006 Census Dictionary statement on religious affiliation states the purpose for gathering such information:\n\n\n\n\n> Data on religious affiliation are used for such purposes as planning educational facilities, aged persons' care and other social services provided by religion-based organisations; the location of church buildings; the assigning of chaplains to hospitals, prisons, armed services and universities; the allocation of time on public radio and other media; and sociological research.\n> \n> \n\n\nThe census question about religion is optional, and asks \"What is the person's religion?\", giving respondents a choice of nine religions, \"Other\" and \"No religion\".[21] At the 2016 census 9.6% of people declined to answer, or they did not give a response adequate for interpretation.[22] This figure dropped to 7.2% in 2021.\n\n\nThe 2021 Australian census data showed that 43.9% of Australians classify themselves Christian, 8.2% less in real terms than five years prior,[23] The second-largest classification was the 38.9% who identified as \"no religion\".\n\n\nAs in many Western countries, the level of active participation in church worship is much lower than this; weekly attendance at church services is likely to be under 1 million, about 4% of the population.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe fastest growing religious classifications over the fifteen years between 2006 and 2021 were:\n\n\n\n* No religion \u2013 up from 18.7% to 38.9%\n* Islam \u2013 up from 1.7% to 3.2%\n* Hinduism \u2013 up from 0.7% to 2.7%\n* Sikhism \u2013 up from 0.1% to 0.8%\n* Buddhism - from 2.1% to 2.4%\n\n\nMeanwhile, all Christian denominations combined decreased from 63.9% to 43.9%.\n\n\n\n### Census data[edit]\n\n\n\n\nReligious declarations of Australians according to the censuses of 1986 to 2021[24][25][26][22][27][1]\n| Affiliation\n | 1986\n | 1996\n | 2006\n | 2011\n | 2016\n | 2021\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Count ('000) | %\n | Count ('000) | %\n | Count ('000) | %\n | Count ('000) | %\n | Count ('000) | %\n | Count ('000) | %\n |\n| 10 Anglican | 3,723.4\n | 23.9\n | 3,903.3\n | 22.0\n | 3,718.3\n | 18.7\n | 3,680.0\n | 17.1\n | 3,101.2\n | 13.3\n | 2,496.3\n | 9.8\n |\n| 10 Baptist | 196.8\n | 1.3\n | 295.2\n | 1.7\n | 316.7\n | 1.6\n | 352.5\n | 1.6\n | 345.1\n | 1.5\n | 347.3\n | 1.4\n |\n| 10 Catholic Catholic | 4,064.4\n | 26.1\n | 4,799.0\n | 27.0\n | 5,126.9\n | 25.8\n | 5,439.2\n | 25.3\n | 5,291.8\n | 22.6\n | 5,075.9\n | 20.0\n |\n| 10 Churches of Christ | 88.5\n | 0.6\n | 75.0\n | 0.4\n | 54.8\n | 0.3\n | 49.7\n | 0.2\n | 39.6\n | 0.2\n | 35.9\n | 0.1\n |\n| 10 Jehovah's Witnesses | 66.5\n | 0.4\n | 83.4\n | 0.5\n | 80.9\n | 0.4\n | 85.6\n | 0.4\n | 82.5\n | 0.4\n | 84.4\n | 0.3\n |\n| 10 Latter Day Saints | 35.5\n | 0.2\n | 45.2\n | 0.3\n | 53.1\n | 0.3\n | 59.8\n | 0.3\n | 61.6\n | 0.3\n | 57.9\n | 0.2\n |\n| 10 Lutheran | 208.3\n | 1.3\n | 250.0\n | 1.4\n | 251.1\n | 1.3\n | 251.9\n | 1.2\n | 174\n | 0.7\n | 145.9\n | 0.6\n |\n| 10 Eastern Orthodox | 427.4\n | 2.5\n | 497.3\n | 2.5\n | 544.3\n | 2.6\n | 563.1\n | 2.6\n | 582.8\n | 2.6\n | 535.5\n | 2.1\n |\n| 10 Pentecostal | 107.0\n | 0.7\n | 174.6\n | 1.0\n | 219.6\n | 1.1\n | 238.0\n | 1.1\n | 260.6\n | 1.1\n | 259.8\n | 1.1\n |\n| 10 Presbyterian & Reformed | 560.0\n | 3.6\n | 675.5\n | 3.8\n | 596.7\n | 3.0\n | 599.5\n | 2.8\n | 526.7\n | 2.3\n | 414.9\n | 1.6\n |\n| 10 Salvation Army | 77.8\n | 0.5\n | 74.1\n | 0.4\n | 64.2\n | 0.3\n | 60.2\n | 0.3\n | 48.9\n | 0.2\n | 35.4\n | 0.1\n |\n| 10 Seventh-day Adventist | 48.0\n | 0.3\n | 52.7\n | 0.3\n | 55.3\n | 0.3\n | 63.0\n | 0.3\n | 62.9\n | 0.3\n | 63.7\n | 0.3\n |\n| 10 Uniting Church | 1,182.3\n | 7.6\n | 1,334.9\n | 7.5\n | 1,135.4\n | 5.7\n | 1,065.8\n | 5.0\n | 870.2\n | 3.7\n | 673.3\n | 2.7\n |\n| 12 Other Christian\n | 596.0\n | 3.8\n | 322.7\n | 1.8\n | 468.6\n | 2.4\n | 642.4\n | 3.0\n | 833.5\n | 3.6\n | 926.8\n | 3.7\n |\n| 15 **Christian total** | **11,381.9** | **73.0** | **12,582.9** | **70.9** | **12,685.9** | **63.9** | **13,150.6** | **61.1** | **12,201.6** | **52.1** | **11,148.8** | **43.9** |\n| 20 Buddhism | 80.4\n | 0.5\n | 199.8\n | 1.1\n | 418.8\n | 2.1\n | 529.0\n | 2.5\n | 563.7\n | 2.4\n | 615.8\n | 2.4\n |\n| 20 Hinduism | 21.5\n | 0.1\n | 67.3\n | 0.4\n | 148.1\n | 0.7\n | 275.5\n | 1.3\n | 440.3\n | 1.9\n | 684.0\n | 2.7\n |\n| 20 Sikhism |  |  | 12.0\n | <0.1\n | 26.4\n | 0.1\n | 72.3\n | 0.4\n | 125.9\n | 0.5\n | 210.4\n | 0.8\n |\n| 20 Islam | 109.5\n | 0.7\n | 200.9\n | 1.1\n | 340.4\n | 1.7\n | 476.3\n | 2.2\n | 604.2\n | 2.6\n | 813.4\n | 3.2\n |\n| 20 Judaism | 69.1\n | 0.4\n | 79.8\n | 0.4\n | 88.8\n | 0.4\n | 97.3\n | 0.5\n | 91\n | 0.4\n | 100.0\n | 0.4\n |\n| 20 Other non-Christian\n | 35.7\n | 0.2\n | 56.6\n | 0.3\n | 82.6\n | 0.4\n | 95.9\n | 0.4\n | 95.7\n | 0.4\n | 115.0\n | 0.5\n |\n| 25 **Non-Christian total** | **316.2** | **2.0** | **616.4** | **3.5** | **1,105.1** | **5.6** | **1,546.3** | **7.2** | **1,920.8** | **8.2** | **2,538.6** | **10.0** |\n| **30** **No religion1** | **1,977.5** | **12.7** | **2,948.9** | **16.6** | **3,706.5** | **18.7** | **4,796.8** | **22.3** | **7,040.7** | **30.1** | **9,887.0** | **38.9** |\n| **40** Not stated**2** | 1,926.6\n | 12.3\n | 1,604.8\n | 9.0\n | 2,357.8\n | 11.9\n | 2,014.0\n | 9.4\n | 2,345.5\n | 10\n | 1,751.4\n | 7.3\n |\n| **Totals3** | **15,602.1** | **100.0** | **17,753.0** | **100.0** | **19,855.3** | **100.0** | **21,507.7** | **100.0** | **23,401.4** | **100.0** | **25,422.8** | **100.0** |\n\n\n1: Includes relatively small numbers declaring \"secular beliefs\", such as atheism, agnosticism, humanism and rationalism, and spiritual beliefs such as New Age, \"own spiritual beliefs\", theism(!), etc. See 7[28]\n\n\n2: Includes \"inadequately described\"\n\n\n3: Due to rounding, figures may not add up to the totals shown.\n\n\n\n### Line and bar charts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Religious affiliation in Australia, 1971-2021\n\"Over the past 50 years, there has been a steady decline in the proportion of Australians who reported an affiliation with Christianity. The same period has seen a consistent rise in Other religions and No religion, particularly in the last 20 years\".[29]\n\n\n\n### Total fertility rates[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2016[update], Buddhists (1.68), Hindus (1.81) and the non-religious (1.84) had the lowest fertility rates. Christians (2.11) and Jews (2.17) had moderate fertility rates, and Muslims had the highest rate at 3.03.[30]\n\n\n\n## Indigenous Australian traditions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indigenous Australians, Australian Aboriginal mythology, and Dreaming (spirituality)\n\n![](image)Illustration of an Aboriginal corroboree ceremony by William Barak c.1898\nDreaming (spirituality)\u2014the Dreaming or Dreaming\u2014places significant emphasis on belonging to the land. It is at once a collection of stories of an ancient view of creation and present day Dreaming (spirituality). It shaped and continues to shape Aboriginal law and customs; and Aboriginal art, story and dance continue to draw on these spiritual traditions. \n\n\nThere were a great many different nations, each with their own individual culture, belief structure, and language. The Rainbow Serpent is a major dream spirit for Aboriginal people across Australia. The Yowie and Bunyip are other well known dream spirits. At the time of the British settlement, traditional religions were animist and tended to have elements of ancestor worship.\n\n\nAboriginal beliefs and spirituality, even among those Aboriginal peoples who identify themselves as members of a traditional organised religion, are intrinsically linked to the land generally and to certain sites of significance in particular. As Mircea Eliade put it, \"There is a general belief among the [indigenous] Australians that the world, man, and the various animals and plants were created by certain Supernatural beings who afterwards disappeared, either ascending to the sky or entering the earth.\"[31] There were and still are ritual systems, with an emphasis on life transitions such as adulthood and death.[32]\n\n\nThe spirituality and customs of Torres Strait Islanders, who inhabit the islands between Australia and New Guinea, reflected their Melanesian origins and dependence on the sea.[33]\n\n\n\n### Since British settlement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Christian pastor, Aboriginal activist and former Governor of South Australia, Sir Douglas Nicholls\nEuropean culture and Christianity have had a significant impact on Indigenous Australians. As in many colonial situations the churches both facilitated the loss of Indigenous Australian culture and religion and also facilitated its maintenance. The involvement of Christians in Aboriginal affairs has evolved significantly since 1788. Around the year 2000, many churches and church organisations officially apologised for past failures to adequately respect indigenous cultures and address the injustices of the dispossession of indigenous people.[34][35][36]\n\n\nIn the Torres Strait Islands, the Coming of the Light Festival marks the day the Christian missionaries first arrived on the islands on 1 July 1871 and introduced Christianity to the region. This is a significant festival for Torres Strait Islanders, who are predominantly Christian. Religious and cultural ceremonies are held across Torres Strait and mainland Australia.[37]\n\n\nProminent Aboriginal activist Noel Pearson, himself raised at a Lutheran mission in Cape York, has written that missions throughout Australia's colonial history \"provided a haven from the hell of life on the Australian frontier while at the same time facilitating colonisation\".[38] Prominent Aboriginal Christians have included Pastor David Unaipon, the first Aboriginal author; Pastor Sir Douglas Nicholls, athlete, activist and former Governor of South Australia; Mum (Shirl) Smith, a celebrated Redfern community worker who, assisted by the Sisters of Charity, work to assist Aboriginal peoples.;[39] and former Senator Aden Ridgeway, the first Chairman of the Aboriginal Catholic Ministry.[39] In recent times, Christians such as Fr Ted Kennedy of Redfern,[40] Jesuit human rights lawyer Fr Frank Brennan[41] and the Josephite Sisters have been prominent in working for Aboriginal rights and improvements to standards of living.[42]\n\n\n\n## Abrahamic religions[edit]\n\n\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Christianity in Australia\n\nAfter the arrival of the first Christian settlers on the First Fleet of British ships in 1788, Christianity quickly became the major religion in Australia. Consequently, the Christian festivals of Christmas and Easter are public holidays, the skylines of Australian cities and towns are marked by church and cathedral spires. Christian churches played a significant role in the development of early education, health and welfare services in Australia.\n\n\nThe churches with the largest number of members are the Catholic Church, the Anglican Church of Australia and the Uniting Church in Australia. The National Council of Churches in Australia has been the main Christian ecumenical body.\n\n\n\n![](image)St. Andrew's Anglican Cathedral in Sydney, New South Wales\nThe Christian churches played an integral role in the development and provision of welfare services in Australia. The first chaplain, Richard Johnson, a Church of England cleric, was charged by Governor Arthur Phillip with improving \"public morality\" in the colony, and he was also heavily involved in health and education.[43]\n\n\nFor much of Australian history, the Church of England in Australia, now known as the Anglican Church of Australia, was the largest religious affiliation. However its relative position has declined, with the Catholic Church, benefiting from post-war Australia multicultural immigration, among other factors, to become the largest single religious group. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia and other congregations associated with non-British cultures have also expanded.\n\n\nToday, the Catholic education system is the second biggest sector after government schools, with more than 750,000 students in 2018 (and around 21 per cent of all secondary school enrolments).[44] The Anglican Church educates around 105,000 students and the Uniting Church has around 48 schools.[45] Smaller denominations, including the Lutheran Church also have a number of schools in Australia. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia also has 8 schools across the country. There are two Catholic universities in Australia: the Australian Catholic University which opened in 1991 following the amalgamation of four Catholic tertiary institutions in eastern Australia, and the University of Notre Dame Australia based in Perth.\n\n\nCatholic Social Services Australia's 63 member organisations help more than a million Australians every year. Anglican organisations work in health, missionary work, social welfare and communications; and the Uniting Church does extensive community work, in aged care, hospitals, nursing, family support services, youth services and with the homeless, and especially throughout inland Australia.[45] Christian charities such as the Saint Vincent de Paul Society, the Salvation Army, Anglicare, and Youth Off the Streets receive considerable national support. Religious orders founded many of Australia's hospitals, such as St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, which was opened as a free hospital in 1857 by the Sisters of Charity and is now Australia's largest not-for-profit health provider and has trained prominent Australian surgeons such as Victor Chang.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mary MacKillop became the first Australian to be canonised as a saint of the Catholic Church in 2010\nNotable Australian Christians[47] have included: Mary MacKillop \u2013 educator, founder of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart and the first Australian to be recognised as a saint by the Catholic Church;[48] David Unaipon \u2013 an Aboriginal writer, inventor and Christian preacher currently featured on the Australian $50 note;[49] Archbishop Daniel Mannix of Melbourne \u2013 a controversial voice against Conscription during World War I and against British policy in Ireland;[50] the Reverend John Flynn \u2013 founder of the Royal Flying Doctor Service, currently featured on the Australian $20 note;[51] Sir Douglas Nicholls \u2013 Aboriginal rights activist, athlete, pastor and former Governor of South Australia;[52] Archbishop Stylianos Harkianakis \u2013 Archbishop and primate of the Greek Orthodox church in Australia from 1975 to 2019\n\n\nSectarianism in Australia tended to reflect the political inheritance of Britain and Ireland. Until 1945, the vast majority of Catholics in Australia were of Irish descent, causing the British majority to question their loyalty to the British Empire. The first Catholic priests arrived in Australia as convicts in 1800, but the Castle Hill Rebellion of 1804 alarmed the British authorities and no further priests were allowed in the colony until 1820, when London sent John Joseph Therry and Philip Connolly.[53] In 1901, the Australian Constitution guaranteed Separation of Church and State. A notable period of sectarianism re-emerged during the First World War and the 1916 Easter Uprising in Ireland,[50] but sectarian division declined after World War II. There was a diversification of Christian churches (especially with the growth of Greek, Macedonian, Serbian and Russian Orthodox churches), together with an increase in ecumenism among Christians through organisations such as the National Council of Churches in Australia,[54] as well as an increase in non-religious adherence.\n\n\n\n![](image)St John's Anglican Church, the oldest church in Australia's capital city, Canberra, was consecrated in 1845\nOne of the most visible signs of the historical importance of Christianity to Australia is the prominence of churches in most Australian towns and cities. Among Australia's oldest are Ebenezer Chapel and the Anglican St Matthew's, Windsor, St Luke's, Liverpool, St Peter's, Campbelltown and St James Church, Sydney, built between 1819 and 1824 by Governor Macquarie's architect, Francis Greenway.[55] St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, was built to a design by William Wardell from a foundation stone laid in 1868; the spires of the cathedral were not finally added until the year 2000. Wardell also worked on the design of St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne \u2013 among the finest examples of ecclesiastical architecture in Australia.[56] The Anglican St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne, in the iconic hub of the city opposite Flinders Street station. Adelaide is known as the \"City of Churches\", but churches extend far into the Australian Outback, as at the historic Lutheran Mission Chapel at Hermannsburg, Northern Territory. Along with community attitudes to religion, church architecture changed significantly during the 20th century. Urban churches, such as the Wayside Chapel (1964) in Sydney, differed markedly from traditional ecclesiastical designs. In the later 20th century, distinctly Australian approaches were applied at places such as Jambaroo Benedictine Abbey, where natural materials were chosen to \"harmonise with the local environment\" and the chapel sanctuary is of glass overlooking rainforest.[57] Similar design principles were applied at Thredbo Ecumenical Chapel built in the Snowy Mountains in 1996.[58]\n\n\nThe Christian festivals of Christmas and Easter are national public holidays in Australia. Christmas, which recalls the birth of Jesus Christ, is celebrated on 25 December during the Australian summer (although on 7 January by some Eastern Orthodox) and is an important cultural festival even for many non-religious Australians. The European traditions of Christmas trees, roast dinners, carols and gift giving are all continued in Australia, but they might be conducted between visits to the beach.[59]\n\n\nHere are some Christian denominations with Australian articles:\n\n\n\n* Anglican Church of Australia (formerly the Church of England in Australia)\n* Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia\n* Australian Christian Churches (formerly the Assemblies of God in Australia)\n* Australian Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists\n* Baptist Union of Australia\n* Christian City Churches, started in Australia\n* Churches of Christ in Australia\n* The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Australia\n* Fellowship of Congregational Churches, Australian only\n* Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia\n* CRC Churches International\n* Lutheran Church of Australia\n* Presbyterian Church of Australia\n* Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia\n* Presbyterian Reformed Church (Australia)\n* Catholic Church in Australia\n* Uniting Church in Australia\n* Two by Twos\n\n\nA 2023 IPSOS survey found that 22% of the population was Protestant or Evangelical while 18% was Catholic.[60]\n\n\n\n### Islam[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Islam in Australia\n\n![](image)Grave of Afghan camel driver Zeriph Khan (1871\u20131903) at Bourke Cemetery, New South Wales Australia. Muslims from British India formed some of Australia's earliest Islamic communities.\n![](image)Auburn Gallipoli Mosque was built in the classical Ottoman style by Sydney's Turkish Muslim community.\n![](image)Rugby League player Hazem El Masri is a member of Australia's large Lebanese-Australian Muslim community.\nThe first contacts that Islam had with Australia was when Muslim fishermen native to Makassar, which is today a part of Indonesia, visited North-Western Australia long before British settlement in 1788. This contact of South East Asian ethnic groups of Islamic faith can be identified from the graves they dug for their comrades who died on the journey, being that they face Mecca (in Arabia), in accordance with Islamic regulations concerning burial, as well as evidence from Aboriginal cave paintings and religious ceremonies which depict and incorporate the adoption of Makassan canoe designs and words.[61][62]\n\n\nIn later history, throughout the 19th century following British settlement, other Muslims came to Australia including the Muslim 'Afghan' cameleers, who used their camels to transport goods and people through the otherwise unnavigable desert and pioneered a network of camel tracks that later became roads across the Outback. Australia's first mosque was built for them at Marree, South Australia in 1861.[45] Between the 1860s and 1920s around 2000 cameleers were brought from Afghanistan and the north west of British India (now Pakistan) and perhaps 100 families remained in Australia. Other outback mosques were established at places like Coolgardie, Cloncurry, and Broken Hill \u2013 and more permanent mosques in Adelaide, Perth and later Brisbane. A legacy of this pioneer era is the presence of wild camels in Outback and the oldest Islamic structure in the southern hemisphere, at Central Adelaide Mosque. Nonetheless, despite their significant role in Australia prior to the establishment of rail and road networks, the formulation of the White Australia policy at the time of Federation made immigration difficult for the 'Afghans' and their memory slowly faded during the 20th century, until a revival of interest began in the 1980s.[63]\n\n\nSuccessive Australian governments dismantled the White Australia Policy in the Post-WW2 period. From the 1970s onwards, under the leadership of Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser, Australia began to pursue multiculturalism.[64] Australia in the later 20th century became a refuge for many Muslims fleeing conflicts including those in Lebanon, Bosnia, Iraq, Iran, Sudan and Afghanistan.[65] General immigration, combined with religious conversion to Islam by Christians and other Australians, as well as Australia's participation in UN refugee efforts has increased the overall Muslim population. Around 36% of Muslims are Australian born. Overseas born Muslims come from a great variety of nations and ethnic groups \u2013 with large Lebanese and Turkish communities.\n\n\nFollowing the 11 September attacks in the USA, attempts to associate the ideology/ies of Osama bin Laden and the religion of Islam stirred some debate in some quarters in Australia about Islam's relationship with the wider community. The deaths of Australians in bombings by militant Islamic fundamentalists in New York in 2001, Bali in 2002\u20135 and London in 2005; as well as the sending of Australian troops to East Timor in 1999, Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003; the arrest of bomb plotters in Australia; and concerns about certain cultural practices such as the wearing of the Burkha all contributed to a degree of tension.[66][67] A series of comments by a senior Sydney cleric, Sheikh Taj El-Din Hilaly also stirred controversy, particularly his remarks regarding \"female modesty\" following an incident of gang rape in Sydney.[68][69] Australians were among the targets of Islamic Fundamentalists in the Bali bombings in Indonesia and an attack on the Australian Embassy in Jakarta; and the South East Asian militant group Jemaah Islamiyah has been of particular concern to Australians.[70]\n\n\nThe Australian government's mandatory detention processing system for asylum seekers became increasingly controversial after the 11 September attacks. A significant proportion of recent Asylum seekers arriving by boat have been Muslims fleeing the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere. Some Islamic leaders and social commentators claim that Islam has suffered from unfair stereotyping[71][72][73] Violence and intimidation was directed against Muslims and people of Middle Eastern appearance during southern Sydney's Cronulla riots in 2005. In 2005, the Howard government established the Muslim Community Reference Group to advise on Muslim community issues for one year, chaired by Ameer Ali.[74] Inter-faith dialogues were also established by Christian and Muslim groups such as The Australian Federation of Islamic Councils and the National Council of Churches in Australia.[75] Australia and Indonesia co-operated closely following the Bali-bombings, not only in law-enforcement but in improving education and cross-cultural understanding, leading to a marked improvement in relations.[76] After a series of controversies, Sheikh Taj El-Din Hilaly retired as Grand mufti of Australia in 2007 and was replaced by Fehmi Naji El-Imam AM.[69]\n\n\nToday, over 604,000 people in Australia identify as Muslim, with diverse communities concentrated mainly in Sydney and Melbourne. More than half are non-practising[77] [*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]cultural Muslims. Since the 1970s Islamic schools have been established as well as more than 100 mosques and prayer centres.[45] Many notable Muslim places of worship are to be found in large Australian cities, including the Central Adelaide Mosque, which was constructed during the 1880s; and Sydney's Classical Ottoman style Auburn Gallipoli Mosque, which was largely funded by the Turkish community and the name of which recalls the shared heritage of the foundation of modern Turkey and the story of the ANZACs.[78] 1,140 people identified as Aboriginal Muslims in the 2011 census, almost double the number recorded in the 2001 census.[79][80] Notable Australian Muslims include boxer Anthony Mundine; community worker and rugby league star Hazem El Masri; cricketer Usman Khawaja and academic Waleed Aly. In 2013, Labor MP Ed Husic became Australia's first Muslim member of Cabinet, briefly serving as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and for Broadband in the short lived Second Rudd government.[81]\n\n\n\n### Judaism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Judaism in Australia and History of the Jews in Australia\n\n![](image)The Great Synagogue, Sydney\n![](image)Sir Isaac Isaacs was the first Australian born Governor General of Australia and was the first Jewish vice-regal representative in the British Empire.\nAt least eight Jewish convicts are believed to have been transported to Sydney aboard the First Fleet in 1788, when the first British settlement was established on the continent. An estimated 110,000 Jews currently live in Australia,[82] the majority being Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern European descent, with many being refugees and Holocaust survivors who arrived during and after World War II.\n\n\nThe Jewish population has increased slightly in recent times[83] due to immigration from South Africa and the former Soviet Union. The largest Jewish community in Australia is in Melbourne, with about 60,000, followed by Sydney with about 45,000 members. Smaller communities are dispersed among the other state capitals.\n\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the British colonial period, Jews have enjoyed formal equality before the law in Australia and have not been subject to civil disabilities or other forms of state-sponsored anti-Semitism which exclude them from full participation in public life.\n\n\nSydney's gothic design Great Synagogue, consecrated in 1878, is a notable place of Jewish worship in Australia. Notable Australian Jews have included the Sir John Monash, the notable World War I general who opened the Maccabean Hall in Sydney in 1923 to commemorate Jews who fought and died in the First World War and who is currently featured on the Australian $100 note;[84] and Sir Isaac Isaacs who became the first Australian born governor general in 1930.[20] Sir Zelman Cowen also served as Governor-General, between 1977 and 1982. The Sydney Jewish Museum opened in 1992 to commemorate The Holocaust \"challenge visitors' perceptions of democracy, morality, social justice and human rights\".[85]\n\n\nUntil the 1930s, all synagogues in Australia were nominally Orthodox, with most acknowledging leadership of the Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom. To this day the vast majority of synagogues in Australia are Orthodox. However, there is a wide range of Orthodox congregations, including Mizrachi, Chabad and Adass Israel congregations. There are also Sephardi congregations.\n\n\nThere had been short-lived efforts to establish Reform congregations as early as the 1890s. However, under the leadership of Ada Phillips, a sustained liberal congregation, Temple Beth Israel, was established in Melbourne. Subsequently, another synagogue linked to the United States Reform Movement, Temple Emanuel, was established in Sydney. Following these two congregations, a number of other Liberal synagogues have been founded in other cities.[86]\n\n\nSince 1992 Conservative (Masorti) services have been held as an alternative service usually in the Neuweg, the smaller second synagogue within Temple Emanuel, Woollahra, Sydney. In 1999, Kehilat Nitzan, Melbourne's first Conservative (Masorti) congregation was established, with foundation president John Rosenberg. The congregation appointed its first rabbi, Ehud Bandel in 2006. In 2010 Beit Knesset Shalom became Brisbane's first Conservative (Masorti) synagogue.\n\n\nIn 2012, the first humanistic Jewish congregation, known as Kehilat Kolenu, was established in Melbourne with links to the cultural Jewish youth movement Habonim Dror. Later in 2012, a similar congregation was established in Sydney, known as Ayelet HaShachar. The services are loosely based on the Humanistic Jewish movement in the United States and the musical-prayer group Nava Tehila in Israel.\n\n\n\n### Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sydney Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Temple\nMain article: Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in Australia\n\nThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith first arrived in Australia in 1922, and at less than 0.1% of the total population,[87] is one of the smaller religious minorities. The Sydney Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Temple is situated in Ingleside, a northern suburb of Sydney.[88] According to Jennifer Taylor, a historian at Sydney University, it is among Sydney's four most significant religious buildings constructed in the twentieth century.[89] Dedicated in 1961, it was also the world's fourth Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed House of Worship to be completed.[88]\n\n\nThe 1996 Australian Census lists Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed membership at just under 9,000.[90] In 2001, the second edition of *A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity for Operational Police and Emergency Services* added the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith to its coverage of religions in Australia and noted that the community had grown to over 11,000.[90] The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on *World Christian Encyclopedia*) estimated some 17,700 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in 2005,[91] and over 19,300 in 2010.[92] However, census data from 2016 reported a much lower population of only 13,988.[87]\n\n\n\n## Indian/Dharmic religions[edit]\n\n\n### Hinduism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hinduism in Australia\n\n![](image)Shiva Vishnu Temple in Melbourne\nHindus numbered 684,000 in the 2021 census, making Hinduism the fourth largest religious or non-religious affiliation. It is one of the fastest growing religions in Australia (12.0% per year since 2011).[2] In the 19th century, Hindus first came to Australia to work on cotton and sugar plantations. Many who remained worked in small business, as camel drivers, merchants and hawkers, selling goods between small rural communities. Their population increased dramatically from the 1960s and 1970s and more than doubled between the 1996 and 2006 census to around 148,000 people. Most were migrants from countries such as Fiji, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore and South Africa. At present many Hindus are well-educated professionals in fields such as medicine, engineering, commerce and information technology. Among Australia's best-known Hindus is the singer Kamahl. There are around forty-three Hindu temples in Australia,[93] the Sri Mandir Temple in Auburn, Sydney being the first established in 1977.[94]\n\n\n\n### Buddhism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Buddhism in Australia\n\n![](image)Nan Tien Temple of Fo Guang Shan Chinese Buddhism, in Wollongong\nBuddhists began arriving in Australia in significant numbers during the goldrush of the 1850s with an influx of Chinese miners. However, the population remained low until the 1960s. Buddhism is now one of the fastest growing religions in Australia. Immigration from Asia has contributed to this, but some people of non-Asian origin have also converted. The three main traditions of Buddhism\u2014Theravada, East Asian and Tibetan\u2014are now represented in Australia.[45] According to the 2021 census, Buddhism has 615,800 adherents: 2.4% of the total population.\n\n\nBuddhist temples can be very active. Quang Minh Temple in Braybrook, Melbourne, Victoria gets about 2,000 people through every Sunday and gives a free vegetarian meal to about 600 people. For important events, more than 20,000 people come. Even more come to the Nan Tien Temple, or \"Southern Paradise Temple\", in Wollongong, New South Wales, began construction in the early 1990s, adopting the Chinese palace building style and is now the largest Buddhist temple in the Southern Hemisphere.[95] This temple follows the Venerable Master Hsing Yun of the Fo Guang Shan Buddhist order. Bodhinyana Monastery is a Theravadin Buddhist monastery in the Thai Forest Tradition located in Serpentine, Western Australia.\n\n\n\n### Sikhism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sri Guru Singh Sabha Gurudwara (Temple), Glenwood, New South Wales\nMain article: Sikhism in Australia\n\nSikhism has been one of the fastest growing religions in Australia in recent years. According to census data, Australia's Sikh population grew from 72,000 to 210,400 between 2011 and 2021, an average growth rate of 14.8% per year.[96] Around 42% of Australia's Sikhs live in the state of Victoria.[97]\n\n\n\n### Jainism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jainism in Australia\n\nJainism is currently the fourth fastest growing religion in Australia, recording 4,050 adherents in 2016 and growing an average of 7.7% per year. The overwhelming majority (94.7%) of Jains live inside the state capitals, primarily Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.[98]\n\n\n\n## Irreligion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Irreligion in Australia\n\n### Non-religious[edit]\n\n\nAustralia is one of the least religious nations in the developed world, with religion not described as a central part in many people's lives.[99] This view is prominent among Australia's youth, who were ranked as the least religious worldwide in a 2008 survey conducted by *The Christian Science Monitor*.[100] In the 2021 census, the ABS categorised ~9,887,000 Australians (38.9%) as having no religion, up 16.6% in real terms from 4,796,800 (22.3%) in 2011.[22] This category includes agnosticism, atheism, humanism, rationalism, and people who are unaffiliated with any particular religion.\n\n\n\n### Atheism[edit]\n\n\nWhile people with no religion are more than 30% of the Australian population,[22] the Australian Bureau of Statistics does not provide information in the annual \"1301.0 \u2013 Year Book Australia\" on religious affiliation as to how many people fall into each sub-category.[101] Data on religious affiliation is only collected by the ABS at the five yearly population census. Atheist interests in Australia are represented[*how?*] nationally by the Atheist Foundation of Australia.[*citation needed*] Humanist interests in Australia are represented[*how?*] nationally by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies.[*citation needed*] Rationalist interests in Australia are represented[*how?*] nationally by the Rationalist Society of Australia.[*citation needed*] The Global Atheist Convention, a prominent atheist event, has been held in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n## Other religions[edit]\n\n\nThe 2006 census[102] shows 53 listed groups down to 5000 members, most of them Christian denominations, many of them national versions such as Greek, Serbian Orthodox and Assyrian Orthodox. Of the smaller religions, Pagan religions 29,328, the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith at 12,000, Humanism about 7000. Between 1000 and 5000 are: Taoism, Druse, Satanism, Zoroastrian, Rationalism, Creativity, Theosophy, Jainism. There are also adherents of Tenrikyo, Shinto, Unitarian Universalism, Eckankar, Cao Dai, Rastafari, Pantheism, Scientology and Raelianism.[103][104]\n\n\nIn general, non-Christian religions and those with no religion have been growing in proportion to the overall population.[105] With fewer classifications, data from 1996 and 2001 showed Aboriginal religion decreasing from 7000 to 5000 while Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed grew from just under 9,000 to over 11,000 and the rest of the \"Other\" category growing from about 69,000 to about 92,000.[90]\n\n\n\n### Paganism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Paganism in Australia\n\nAlexandrian Wiccans and Gardnerian Wiccans arrived in Australia from England and the United States around the late 1960s.[106]\n\n\nIn the 2011 census, 32,083 Australians identified their religion as a Pagan religion including 8,413 people who identified their religion as Wicca or Neopagan witchcraft.[107]\n\n\n\n## Religion and the law[edit]\n\n\n### Constitutional status[edit]\n\n\nSection 116 of the Constitution of Australia provides that:\n\n\n\n\n> The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.\n> \n> \n\n\nTechnically, this does not affect the states' authority to legislate on religion. Nor would it block federal legislation on religion, aside from that establishing an official religion of Australia. In practice, though, federal governments have respected Section 116 and generally allowed the free practice of religions. Australia does not have explicit \"separation of church and state\"\u2014the essence of a \"secular state\"\u2014in the sense that countries like the USA do. In view of Section 116 of Australia's constitution (\"The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance ...\"), it is commonly believed that Australia is already a \"secular state\". This is a misconception: in 1981, the High Court determined that there is in fact no constitutional separation of church and state in Australia. However, there is no general \"mood\" to legislate establishment of religions.[108]\n\n\n\n### Other interactions[edit]\n\n\nIn 1983, the High Court of Australia defined religion as \"a complex of beliefs and practices which point to a set of values and an understanding of the meaning of existence\". The *Australian Bureau of Statistics 2001 Census Dictionary* defines \"no religion\" as a category of religion which includes subcategories such as agnosticism, atheism, Humanism and rationalism (but the ABS also categorises these as \"secular beliefs\").\n\n\nThe Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) is able to inquire into allegations of discrimination on religious grounds.\n\n\nIn 1998 the HREOC addressed the right to freedom of religion and belief in Australia against article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, stating that \"despite the legal protections that apply in different jurisdictions, many Australians suffer discrimination on the basis of religious belief or non-belief, including members of both mainstream and non-mainstream religions, and those of no religious persuasion.\"[109] An example of an HREOC response to such views is the IsmaU project, which examines possible prejudice against Muslims in Australia since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US and the Bali bombings.[110]\n\n\n\n## Interfaith efforts[edit]\n\n\nInterfaith efforts between various religious institutions occur. Since the early 2000s, the Abraham Conference convenes as an annual interfaith event between Christians, Muslims, and Jews.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Australia portal\n* ![icon](image)Religion portal\n\n\n* *A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity for Operational Police and Emergency Services*\n* Australian Association for Jewish Studies\n* Broken Rites & Catholic Church sexual abuse cases in Australia\n* Freedom of religion in Australia\n* National Church Life Survey\n* Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse\n* Separation of church and state in Australia\n* Stolen Generations\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Australian Bureau of Statistics\u00a0: 2021 Census of Population and Housing\u00a0: General Community Profile\" (XLSX). *Abs.gov.au*.
