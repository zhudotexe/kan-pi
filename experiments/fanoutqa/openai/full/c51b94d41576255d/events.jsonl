Its area is 507,451 km2 (195,928 sq mi) with a population density of 0.03/km²; the population was 13,039 according to the 2021 Canadian census;[2] and it is located at 68°N 70°W﻿ / ﻿68°N 70°W﻿ / 68; -70﻿ (Baffin Island)[1]. It also contains the city of Iqaluit (with a population of around 7,000), which is the capital of Nunavut.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe Inuktitut name for the island is *Qikiqtaaluk*,[6] which means \"very big island\" (*qikiqtaq* \"island\" + *-aluk* \"very big\") and in Inuktitut syllabics is written as ᕿᑭᖅᑖᓗᒃ. This name is used for the administrative region the island is part of (Qikiqtaaluk Region), as well as in multiple places in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories,[7] such as some smaller islands: Qikiqtaaluk in Baffin Bay and Qikiqtaaluk in Foxe Basin. Norse explorers referred to it as *Helluland* (\"stone land\").[8] In 1576, English seaman Martin Frobisher made landfall on the island, naming it \"Queen Elizabeth's Foreland\" and Frobisher Bay is named after him.[9] The island is named after English explorer William Baffin, who, in 1616,[10] came across the island while trying to discover the Northwest Passage.[11] It was also formerly known as **James Island**.[12]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Topography of Baffin Island\n![](image)Coast of the Remote Peninsula in Sam Ford Fjord, northeast Baffin Island\n![](image)Southern tip of Baffin Island.\n![](image)Mount Thor, a large cliff on Baffin Island\n![](image)Map of Thule expansion in Canada and Greenland\n![](image)Pangnirtung\nIqaluit, the capital of Nunavut, is located on the southeastern coast. Until 1987, the town was called Frobisher Bay, after the English name for Frobisher Bay on which it is located, named for Martin Frobisher. That year the community voted to restore the Inuktitut name.[13]\n\n\nTo the south lies Hudson Strait, separating Baffin Island from mainland Quebec.[14] South of the western end of the island is the Fury and Hecla Strait,[15] which separates the island from the Melville Peninsula[16] on the mainland. To the east are Davis Strait[17] and Baffin Bay,[18] with Greenland beyond.[14] The Foxe Basin,[19] the Gulf of Boothia[20] and Lancaster Sound[21] separate Baffin Island from the rest of the Arctic Archipelago to the west and north.\n\n\nThe Baffin Mountains run along the northeastern coast of the island and are a part of the Arctic Cordillera. The highest peak is Mount Odin, with an elevation of at least 2,143 m (7,031 ft), although some sources say 2,147 m (7,044 ft).[22][23] Another peak of note is Mount Asgard, located in Auyuittuq National Park, with an elevation of 2,011 m (6,598 ft). Mount Thor, with an elevation of 1,675 m (5,495 ft), is said to have the greatest purely vertical drop (a sheer cliff face) of any mountain on Earth, at 1,250 m (4,100 ft).[24] Mount Sharat,[25] with an elevation of 422 m (1,385 ft) and a prominence of 67 m (220 ft) is located on Baffin Island. The mountain is named after geologist Sharat Kumar Roy, the chief geology curator in the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago. Roy, a native of India, studied in India, London, and earned his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago. Shortly after he started at the Field Museum he joined the 1927–1928 Rawson-Macmillan Expedition to Baffin Island and Labrador. This 15-month expedition began in June 1927.\n\n\nThe two largest lakes on the island lie in the south-central part of the island: Nettilling Lake (5,542 km2 [2,140 sq mi]) and Amadjuak Lake (3,115 km2 [1,203 sq mi]) further south.[26][27][28]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nBaffin Island has been inhabited for over 3,000 years, first by the pre-Dorset, followed by the Dorset, and then by the Thule people, ancestors of the Inuit, who have lived on the island for the last thousand years.[29][30] In about 986, Erik Thorvaldsson, known as Erik the Red,[31] formed three settlements near the southwestern tip of Greenland.[32] In late 985 or 986, Bjarni Herjólfsson, sailing from Iceland to Greenland, was blown off course and sighted land southwest of Greenland. Bjarni appears to be the first European to see Baffin Island, and the first European to see North America beyond Greenland.[31] It was about 15 years later that the Norse Greenlanders, led by Leif Erikson, a son of Erik the Red, started exploring new areas around the year 1000.[31] Baffin Island is thought to be Helluland, and the archaeological site at Tanfield Valley is thought to have been a trading post.[33][34] The Saga of Erik the Red, 1880 translation into English by J. Sephton from the original Icelandic 'Eiríks saga rauða':\n\n\n\n\n> They sailed away from land; then to the Vestribygd and to Bjarneyjar (the Bear Islands). Thence they sailed away from Bjarneyjar with northerly winds. They were out at sea two half-days. Then they came to land, and rowed along it in boats, and explored it, and found there flat stones, many and so great that two men might well lie on them stretched on their backs with heel to heel. Polar-foxes were there in abundance. This land they gave name to, and called it Helluland (stone-land).[33]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn September 2008, the *Nunatsiaq News*, a weekly newspaper, reported that Patricia Sutherland, who worked at the Canadian Museum of Civilization, had found archaeological remains of yarn and cordage [string], rat droppings, tally sticks, a carved wooden Dorset culture face mask depicting Caucasian features, and possible architectural remains, which indicated that European traders and possibly settlers had been on Baffin Island not later than 1000 CE.[8] What the source of this Old World contact may have been is unclear and controversial;[30][35][36][37][38] the newspaper article states:\n\n\n\n\n> Dating of some yarn and other artifacts, presumed to be left by Vikings on Baffin Island, have produced an age that predates the Vikings by several hundred years.\n> So, as Sutherland said, if you believe that spinning was not an indigenous technique that was used in Arctic North America, then you have to consider the possibility that as \"remote as it may seem,\" these finds may represent evidence of contact with Europeans prior to the Vikings' arrival in Greenland.[8]\n> \n> \n\n\nSutherland's research eventually led to a 2012 announcement that whetstones had been found with remnants of alloys indicative of Viking presence.[39] In 2018, Michele Hayeur Smith of Brown University, who specialises in the study of ancient textiles, wrote that she does not think the ancient Arctic people, the Dorset and Thule, needed to be taught how to spin yarn: \"It's a pretty intuitive thing to do.\"[30]\n\n\n\n\n> ...the date received on Sample 4440b from Nanook clearly indicates that sinew was being spun and plied at least as early, if not earlier, than yarn at this site. We feel that the most parsimonious explanation of this data is that the practice of spinning hair and wool into plied yarn most likely developed naturally within this context of complex, indigenous, Arctic fiber technologies, and not through contact with European textile producers. [...] Our investigations indicate that Paleoeskimo (Dorset) communities on Baffin Island spun threads from the hair and also from the sinews of native terrestrial grazing animals, most likely musk ox and arctic hare, throughout the Middle Dorset period and for at least a millennium before there is any reasonable evidence of European activity in the islands of the North Atlantic or in the North American Arctic.\n> \n> — Journal of Archaeological Science, August 2018[37]\n> \n\n\n\n> A long-running debate disputes whether the Vikings taught indigenous peoples in the Canadian Arctic how to spin yarn when the invaders arrived in the region around 1,000 years ago. The team found that some of the spun yarn dates back at least 2,000 years, long before the Vikings arrived in the area. This shows that the indigenous peoples in the Canadian Arctic developed yarn-spinning technologies without any help from the Vikings, the scientists said.\n> \n> — Live Science, October 16, 2018[38]\n> \n\n\nWilliam W. Fitzhugh, Director of the Arctic Studies Center at the Smithsonian Institution, and a Senior Scientist at the National Museum of Natural History, wrote that there is insufficient published evidence to support Sutherland's claims, and that the Dorset were using spun cordage by the 6th century.[40] In 1992, Elizabeth Wayland Barber wrote that a piece of three-ply yarn that dates to the Paleolithic era, that ended about 10,000 BP, was found at the Lascaux caves in France. This yarn consisted of three s-twist strands that were z-plied, much like the way a three-ply yarn is made now, the Baffin Island yarn was a simple two-ply yarn.[36] The eight sod buildings and artifacts found in the 1960s at L'Anse aux Meadows, located on the northern tip of Newfoundland Island, remains the only confirmed Norse site in North America outside of those found in Greenland.[41]\n\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\nBaffin Island is part of the Qikiqtaaluk Region.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![Baffin Island is located in Qikiqtaaluk Region](image)![Arctic Bay[42]](image)\nArctic Bay[42]\n![Clyde River[43]](image)\nClyde River[43]\n![Iqaluit[44]](image)\n*Iqaluit*[44]\n![Kimmirut[45]](image)\nKimmirut[45]\n![Pangnirtung[46]](image)\nPangnirtung[46]\n![Pond Inlet[47]](image)\nPond Inlet[47]\n![Nanisivik[48]](image)\nNanisivik[48]\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of communities on Baffin Island\n\nThe population of Baffin Island at the 2021 Canadian census was 13,039[2] giving a population density of 0.03/km2 (0.07/sq mi). The population accounts for 67.37 per cent of the 19,355 people in the Qikiqtaaluk Region, 56.51 per cent of the population of the Arctic Archipelago, and 35.38 per cent of the population of Nunavut.[2][49][50]\n\n\nAs of the 2016 Canadian census the majority, 74.06 per cent, were Indigenous peoples and 25.83 per cent were non-Indigenous. This compares to 88.85 per cent and 14.12 per cent Indigenous and non-Indigenous people for Nunavut as a whole. This lower percentage of Indigenous peoples on Baffin Island results from Iqaluit being 59.29 per cent Indigenous and 40.65 per cent non-Indigenous. Of the total population 72.17 per cent are Inuit, 0.92 per cent are First Nations, and 0.73 per cent are Métis. Except for a few First Nations people in Arctic Bay all non-Inuit Indigenous peoples live in Iqaluit.[51][52][53][54][55][56][57]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sea ice off Baffin Island\n\n\nPopulation figures\n| City or hamlet | 2021[2] | 2016[58] | 2011[58] | 2006[59] | 2001[59] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Arctic Bay | 944 | 868 | 823 | 690 | 646\n |\n| Clyde River | 1,181 | 1,053 | 934 | 820 | 785\n |\n| Iqaluit | 7,429 | 7,740 | 6,699 | 6,184 | 5,236\n |\n| Kimmirut | 426 | 389 | 455 | 411 | 433\n |\n| Nanisivik | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 77\n |\n| Pangnirtung | 1,504 | 1,481 | 1,425 | 1,325 | 1,276\n |\n| Pond Inlet | 1,555 | 1,617 | 1,549 | 1,315 | 1,220\n |\n\n\nThe hamlets of Kinngait (population: 1,396[2]) and Qikiqtarjuaq (population: 593[2]) do not lie on Baffin Island proper. Kinngait is situated on Dorset Island, which is located a few kilometres from the south eastern tip of the Foxe Peninsula. Similarly, Qikiqtarjuaq is situated on Broughton Island, which is located near the northern coast of the Cumberland Peninsula.\n\n\nThe Mary River Mine, an iron ore mine with an estimated 21-year life, at Mary River, may include building a railway and a port to transport the ore.[60] This may create a temporary mining community there.\n\n\n\n## Wildlife[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Baffin Island red fox\nBaffin Island is home to the Dewey Soper Migratory Bird Sanctuary and the Bowman Bay Wildlife Sanctuary.\n\n\nThe Dewey Soper Migratory Bird Sanctuary, named for J. Dewey Soper, is located on the western side of Baffin Island from Bowman Bay to the Koukdjuak River. It is an 8,159 km2 (3,150 sq mi) area that was classified a wetland of international importance via the Ramsar Convention on May 24, 1982. It is home of the world's largest goose colony and supports a large number of barren-ground caribou.[61]\n\n\nThe Bowman Bay Wildlife Sanctuary is also located on the western side of Baffin Island near Bowman Bay in the Great Plain of the Koukdjuak. It is 1,079 km2 (417 sq mi) and is classified as Category IV (Habitat/Species Management Area) under the International Union for Conservation of Nature.[62][63]\n\n\nBaffin Island has both year-round and summer visitor wildlife. On land, examples of year-round wildlife are barren-ground caribou,[64] polar bear,[65] Arctic fox, red fox, Arctic hare, lemming, and Baffin Island wolf.[66]\n\n\nBarren-ground caribou herds migrate in a limited range from northern Baffin Island down to the southern part in winter, even to the Frobisher Bay peninsula, next to Resolution Island, then migrating back north in the summer.[64] In 2012, a survey of caribou herds found that the local population was only about 5,000, a decrease of as much as 95% from the 1990s.[67]\n\n\nArctic hares are found throughout Baffin Island. Their fur is pure white in winter and moults to a scruffy dark grey in summer. Arctic hares and lemmings are an important food source for Arctic and red foxes and Arctic wolves.[68][69][70]\n\n\nLemmings are also found throughout the island and are a major food source for foxes, wolves and the snowy owl. In the winter, lemmings dig complicated tunnel systems through the snow drifts to get to their food supply of dry grasses and lichens.[71]\n\n\n\n### Predators[edit]\n\n\nPolar bears can be found all along the coast of Baffin Island but are most prevalent where the sea ice takes the form of pack ice, where their major food sources—ringed seals (jar seal) and bearded seals—live. Polar bears mate approximately every year, bearing one to three cubs around March. Female polar bears may travel 10–20 km (6.2–12.4 mi) inland to find a large snow bank where they dig a den in which to spend the winter and later give birth. The polar bear population here is one of 19 genetically distinct demes of the circumpolar region.[72]\n\n\nRed foxes can be found predominantly in the southernmost areas of Baffin Island, away from the harshest of winter weather, though some individuals may forage and explore elsewhere. The Arctic foxes can usually be found where polar bears venture on the fast ice close to land in their search for seals. Arctic foxes are scavengers and often follow polar bears to get their leavings. They also are known to take ground-nesting birds and their eggs and chicks, such as ducks, geese, ptarmigan, seagulls, shorebirds and even snowy owls, on occasion. On Baffin Island, Arctic foxes are sometimes trapped by Inuit, but there is no longer a robust fur industry.[73]\n\n\nThe Arctic wolf and the Baffin Island wolf, a grey wolf subspecies, are also year-round residents of Baffin Island. Unlike the grey wolf in southern climes, Arctic wolves often have smaller social networks, due to the barren landscape and minimal resources, thus resulting in unique hierarchies when compared with wolves found further south. For example, Arctic wolves often do not hunt in packs, although a male-female pair may hunt together. \n\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Baffin Island\n![](image)An ice-covered fjord on Baffin Island, with Davis Strait in the background\n### Birds[edit]\n\n\nNesting birds are summer land visitors to Baffin Island. Baffin Island is one of the major nesting destinations from the Eastern and Mid-West flyways for many species of migrating birds. Waterfowl include eiders, Canada goose, snow goose, cackling goose, and brant goose (brent goose). Shore birds include the phalarope, various waders (commonly called sandpipers), murres including Brünnich's guillemot, and plovers. Gull species also nest on Baffin Island and they include Sabine's gull,[74] glaucous gull, herring gull and ivory gull.[75][76]\n\n\nLong-range travellers include the Arctic tern, which migrates from Antarctica every spring. The varieties of water birds that nest here include coots, loons, mallards, and many other duck species.[76]\n\n\n\n### Marine mammals[edit]\n\n\nIn the water (and under the ice), the main year-round species is the ringed seal subspecies, the Arctic ringed seal. It lives offshore within 8 km (5.0 mi) of land. In winter, it makes a number of breathing holes in the ice, up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) thick. It visits each one often to keep the hole open and free from ice. In March, when a female is ready to whelp, she will enlarge one of the breathing holes that has snow over it, creating a small \"igloo\" where she whelps one or two pups. Within three weeks the pups are in the water and swimming. In summer, some ringed seals keep to a narrow territory about 3 km (1.9 mi) along the shoreline but may move out into the open water. In the spring they spend more time on the surface of the ice.[77]\n\n\n\n#### Summer visitors[edit]\n\n\nWater species that visit Baffin Island in the summer are:\n\n\nHarp seals (or saddle-backed seals), which migrate from major breeding grounds off the coast of Labrador and the southeast coast of Greenland to Baffin Island for the summer.[78] Migrating at speeds of 15–20 km/h (9.3–12.4 mph), they all come up to breathe at the same time, then dive and swim up to 1–2 km (0.62–1.24 mi) before surfacing again. They migrate in large pods consisting of a hundred or more seals to within 1–8 km (0.62–4.97 mi) of the shoreline, which they then follow, feeding on crustaceans and fish.[79]\n\n\nWalruses, which do not migrate far off land in the winter. They merely follow the fast ice, or ice that is solidly attached to land, and stay ahead of it as the ice hardens further and further out to sea. As winter progresses, they will always remain where there is open water free of ice. When the ice melts, they move in to land and can be found basking on rocks close to shore. One of the largest walrus herds can be found in the Foxe Basin on the western side of Baffin Island.[80]\n\n\nBeluga or white whales migrate along the coast of Baffin Island; some head north to the feeding grounds in the Davis Strait between Greenland and Baffin Island, or into the Hudson Strait or any of the bays and estuaries in between. Usually travelling in pods of two or more, they can often be found very close to shore (100 m [330 ft] or less). They come up to breathe every 30 seconds or so as they make their way along the coastline eating crustaceans.\n\n\nNarwhals, which are known for the males' long, spiralling single tusk, can also be found along the coast of Baffin Island in the summer. Much like their beluga cousins, they may be found in pairs or even in a large pod of ten or more males, females and newborns. They also can be often found close to the shoreline, gracefully pointing their tusks skyward as they come up for air.\n\n\nThe largest summer visitor to Baffin Island is the bowhead whale. Found throughout the Arctic range, one group of bowhead whales is known to migrate to the Foxe Basin, a bay on the western side of Baffin Island.\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Air view - Kimmirut to Pangnirtung\nBaffin Island lies in the path of a generally northerly airflow all year round, so, like much of northeastern Canada, it has an extremely cold climate. This brings very long, cold winters and foggy, cloudy summers, which have helped to add to the remoteness of the island. Spring thaw arrives much later than normal for a position straddling the Arctic Circle: around early June at Iqaluit in the south-east but around early- to mid-July on the north coast where glaciers run right down to sea level. Snow, even heavy snow, can occur at any time of the year, although it is least likely in July and early August. Average annual temperatures at Iqaluit are around −9.5 °C (14.9 °F), compared with around 5 °C (41 °F) in Reykjavík,[maps 1] which is at a similar latitude.[81]\n\n\nSea ice surrounds the island for most of the year and only disappears completely from the north coast for short, unpredictable periods from mid- to late June until the end of September.[82]\n\n\nMost of Baffin Island lies north of the Arctic Circle—all communities from Pangnirtung northwards have polar night in winter and midnight sun in summer. The eastern community of Clyde River has twilight instead of night from April 26 until May 13, continuous sunlight for 21⁄2 months from May 14 to July 28, then twilight instead of night from July 29 until August 16. This gives the community just over 31⁄2 months without true night. In the winter, the sun sets on November 22 and does not rise again until January 19 of the next year. Pond Inlet has civil twilight from December 16 to December 26. However, there is twilight for at least 4 hours per day, unlike places such as Eureka.[83]\n\n\nLike most of Nunavut and the Canadian Arctic, Baffin Island has a tundra climate (Köppen climate classification *ET*), although the highest ice caps have an ice cap climate (*EF*). The sea is frozen for most of the year, and only a few months are above freezing. There can be seasonal lag in spring.\n\n\nThe Barnes Ice Cap, in the middle of the island, has been retreating since at least the early 1960s, when the Geographical Branch of the then Department of Mines and Technical Surveys sent a three-man survey team to the area to measure isostatic rebound and cross-valley features of the Isortoq River.[84] Although in the 1970s parts of Baffin Island failed to have the usual ice-free period in the summer.[85]\n\n\nClimate tables from south to north\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Iqaluit (Iqaluit Airport)WMO ID: 71909;

However, the date received on Sample 4440b from Nanook clearly indicates that sinew was being spun and plied at least as early, if not earlier, than yarn at this site. We feel that the most parsimonious explanation of this data is that the practice of spinning hair and wool into plied yarn most likely developed naturally within this context of complex, indigenous, Arctic fiber technologies, and not through contact with European textile producers.\n38. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Jarus, Owen (October 16, 2018). \"Do Canadian Carvings Depict Vikings?

The island separates the Sea of Japan, which lies to its north and west, from the North Pacific Ocean to the south and east. It is the seventh-largest island in the world, and the second-most populous after the Indonesian island of Java.[8][9][10]\n\n\nHonshu had a population of 104 million as of 2017[update], constituting 81.3% of the entire population of Japan,[11] and mostly concentrated in the coastal areas and plains. Approximately 30% of the total population resides in the Greater Tokyo Area on the Kantō Plain. As the historical center of Japanese cultural and political power,[12] the island includes several past Japanese capitals, including Kyōto, Nara, and Kamakura. Much of the island's southern shore forms part of the Taiheiyō Belt, a megalopolis that spans several of the Japanese islands.[12] Honshu contains Japan's highest mountain, Mount Fuji, and its largest lake, Lake Biwa.[13]\n\n\nMost of Japan's industry is located in a belt running along Honshu's southern coast, from Tokyo to Nagoya, Kyōto, Osaka, Kobe, and Hiroshima;[12] by contrast, the economy along the northwestern Sea of Japan coast is largely based on fishing and agriculture.[14] The island is linked to the other three major Japanese islands by a number of bridges and tunnels. The island primarily shares two climates, with Northern Honshu having a mainly humid continental climate while the south has a humid subtropical climate.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe name of the island, Honshū (本州), directly translates to \"main province\" in English.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nHumans first arrived in Honshu about 60,000 years ago. [16]\n\n\n\n### Meiji Restoration[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(February 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nHonshu was the target of devastating air raids during the Pacific War of World War II. The first air raid to strike Honshu and the other home islands was the Doolittle Raid. With the introduction of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the firebombing of Tokyo culminated in Operation Meetinghouse, the most destructive air raid in human history, which destroyed 16 square miles (41 km2; 10,000 acres) of central Tokyo, leaving an estimated 100,000 civilians dead, and over one million homeless.[17] The war ended with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki shortly before Japan's surrender and signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on September 2, 1945, on board the USS *Missouri* (BB-63) in Tokyo Bay.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Japan as seen from a satellite. Honshu is the largest, middle island.\nThe island is roughly 1,300 km (810 mi) long and ranges from 50 to 230 km (31 to 143 mi) wide, and its total area is 227,960 km2 (88,020 sq mi),[1] making it slightly larger than the island of Great Britain 209,331 km2 (80,823 sq mi).[10] Its land area has been increasing with land reclamation and coastal uplift in the north due to plate tectonics with a convergent boundary. Honshu has 10,084 kilometres (6,266 mi) of coastline.[7]\n\n\nMountainous and volcanic, Honshu experiences frequent earthquakes (the Great Kantō earthquake heavily damaged Tokyo in September 1923, and the earthquake of March 2011 moved the northeastern part of the island by varying amounts of as much as 5.3 m (17 ft)[18][19] while causing devastating tsunamis). The highest peak is the active volcano Mount Fuji at 3,776 m (12,388 ft), which makes Honshu the world's 7th highest island. There are many rivers, including the Shinano River, Japan's longest. The Japanese Alps span the width of Honshu, from the 'Sea of Japan' coast to the Pacific shore. The climate is generally humid subtropical in western Japan and humid continental in the north.\n\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\nHonshu has a total population of 104 million people, according to a 2017 estimate, 81.3% of the entire population of Japan.[11] The largest city is Tokyo (population: 13,988,129),[20] the capital of Japan and part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the most populous metropolitan area in the world.\n\n\n\n### Extreme points[edit]\n\n\n#### Bridges and tunnels[edit]\n\n\nHonshu is connected to the islands of Hokkaidō, Kyūshū and Shikoku by tunnels and bridges. Three bridge systems have been built across the islands of the Inland Sea between Honshu and Shikoku (Akashi Kaikyo Bridge and the Ōnaruto Bridge; Shin-Onomichi Bridge, Innoshima Bridge, Ikuchi Bridge, Tatara Bridge, Ōmishima Bridge, Hakata–Ōshima Bridge, and the Kurushima Kaikyō Bridge; Shimotsui-Seto Bridge, Hitsuishijima Bridge, Iwakurojima Bridge, Yoshima Bridge, Kita Bisan-Seto Bridge, and the Minami Bisan-Seto Bridge), the Seikan Tunnel connects Honshu with Hokkaidō, and the Kanmonkyo Bridge and Kanmon Tunnel connects Honshu with Kyūshū.\n\n\n\n### Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nThese are notable flora and fauna of Honshu.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable flora and fauna[21]\n| Name | Type\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Japanese black bear | Fauna\n | A subspecies of the Asian black bear.

It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan, and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900.[22][23][24] The tsunami subsequently led to the meltdown of 3 nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, leading to the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\n\n\n\n### Parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mount Fuji seen from Lake Motosu in Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park\n\n\nNational parks (国立公園)\n| Minami Alps National Park | 南アルプス\n |\n| Chūbu-Sangaku National Park | 中部山岳\n |\n| Hakusan National Park | 白山\n |\n| Myōkō-Togakushi Renzan National Park | 妙高戸隠連山\n |\n| Daisen-Oki National Park | 大山隠岐\n |\n| Chichibu Tama Kai National Park | 秩父多摩甲斐\n |\n| Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park | 富士箱根伊豆\n |\n| Jōshin'etsu-kōgen National Park | 上信越高原\n |\n| Nikkō National Park | 日光国立公園\n |\n| Ogasawara National Park | 小笠原\n |\n| Ise-Shima National Park | 伊勢志摩\n |\n| Sanin Kaigan National Park | 山陰海岸\n |\n| Yoshino-Kumano National Park | 吉野熊野\n |\n| Setonaikai National Park | 瀬戸内海\n |\n| Bandai-Asahi National Park | 磐梯朝日\n |\n| Sanriku Fukkō National Park | 三陸復興\n |\n| Towada-Hachimantai National Park | 十和田八幡平\n |\n| Oze National Park | 尾瀬\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Region | List of Quasi-National Parks\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Tōhoku | Shimokita Hantō, Tsugaru, Hayachine, Kurikoma, Minami Sanriku Kinkasan, Zaō, Oga, Chōkai |\n| Kantō | Suigō-Tsukuba, Minami Bōsō, Meiji no Mori Takao, Tanzawa-Ōyama |\n| Chūbu | Echigo Sanzan-Tadami, Myōgi-Arafune-Saku Kōgen, Sado-Yahiko-Yoneyama, Noto Hantō, Echizen-Kaga Kaigan, Yatsugatake-Chūshin Kōgen, Tenryū-Okumikawa, Chūō Alps, Ibi-Sekigahara-Yōrō, Hida-Kisogawa, Aichi Kōgen, Mikawa-wan |\n| Kansai | Suzuka, Wakasa Wan, Tango-Amanohashidate-Ōeyama, Biwako, Murō-Akame-Aoyama, Kongō-Ikoma-Kisen, Yamato-Aogaki, Kōya-Ryūjin, Meiji no Mori Minō, Kyoto Tamba Kogen |\n| Chūgoku | Hyōnosen-Ushiroyama-Nagisan, Hiba-Dōgo-Taishaku, Nishi-Chūgoku Sanchi, Kita-Nagato Kaigan, Akiyoshidai |\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nHonshu island generates around US$3.5 trillion or more than 80% of Japan's GDP.[25]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nFruit, vegetables, grains, rice and cotton make up the main produce grown in Honshu.[26] The Tohoku region, spanning the north-eastern part of the island, is notable for its rice production, with 65% of cultivated land being rice paddy fields – almost a quarter of all paddy fields in Japan.[27] Chiba Prefecture is famous for its peanuts, also being the largest producer in Japan.[28] Rare species of the lichen genus Menegazzia are found only in Honshu.[29]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nMost of Japan's tea and silk is from Honshu.[26] Japan's three largest industrial regions are all located on Honshu: the Keihin region, the Hanshin Industrial Region, and the Chūkyō Industrial Area.\n\n\n\n### Minerals and fuels[edit]\n\n\nHonshu is home to a large portion[30] of Japan's minimal mineral reserves,[31] including small oil and coal deposits. Several coal deposits are located in the northern part of the island,[32] concentrated in Fukushima Prefecture and Niigata Prefecture, though Honshu's coal production is negligible in comparison to Hokkaido and Kyushu.[33] Most of Japan's oil reserves are also located in northern Honshu, along the west coast, spanning Niigata, Yamagata, and Akita Prefectures.[34]\n\n\nMost of Japan's copper, lead, zinc and chromite is located on Honshu, along with smaller, scattered deposits of gold, silver, arsenic, sulfur and pyrite.[35]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nThe Tokaido Shinkansen, opened in 1964 between Tokyo and Shin-Ōsaka, is Japan's first high-speed rail line.[36] It is the world's oldest high-speed rail line and one of the most heavily used.[37][38] The San'yō Shinkansen, connects the two largest cities in western Japan, Shin-Osaka in Osaka with Hakata Station in Fukuoka. Both the Tokaido Shinkansen and the Sanyo Shinkansen help form a continuous high-speed railway through the Taiheiyō Belt megalopolis.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mt. Fuji and the Tokaido Shinkansen\n## Administrative regions and prefectures[edit]\n\n\nThe island is divided into five nominal regions and contains 34 prefectures, including metropolitan Tokyo. Administratively, some smaller islands are included within these prefectures, notably including the Ogasawara Islands, Sado Island, Izu Ōshima, and Awaji Island.\n\n\nThe regions and their prefectures are:\n\n\n\n* **Tōhoku region** consists of six prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image) Akita Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Aomori Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Fukushima Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Iwate Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Miyagi Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Yamagata Prefecture\n* **Kantō region** consists of seven prefectures, including the capital of Japan which is the Tokyo Metropolis.\n\t+ ![](image) Chiba Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Gunma Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Ibaraki Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Kanagawa Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Saitama Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Tochigi Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Tokyo\n* **Chūbu region** consists of nine prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image) Aichi Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Fukui Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Gifu Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Ishikawa Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Nagano Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Niigata Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Shizuoka Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Toyama Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Yamanashi Prefecture\n* **Kansai region** consists of seven prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image) Hyōgo Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Kyoto Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Mie Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Nara Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Osaka Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Shiga Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Wakayama Prefecture\n* **Chūgoku region** consists of five prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image) Hiroshima Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Okayama Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Shimane Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Tottori Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Yamaguchi Prefecture\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n* ![icon](image)Islands portal\n\n\n* Geography of Japan\n* Hokkaido\n* Japanese archipelago\n* Kyushu\n* Okinawa\n* Shikoku\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Farjon, Aljos; Filer, Denis (2013). *An Atlas of the World's Conifers: An Analysis of their Distribution, Biogeography, Diversity and Conservation Status*.

Located in Melanesia in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, the island is separated from Australia by the 150-kilometre (81-nautical-mile; 93-mile) wide Torres Strait, though both landmasses lie on the same continental shelf. Numerous smaller islands are located to the west and east. The name \"New Guinea\" was given by Spanish explorer Yñigo Ortiz de Retez during his maritime expedition of 1545 due to the resemblance of the indigenous peoples of the island to those in the African region of Guinea.[1]\n\n\nThe eastern half of the island is the major land mass of the independent state of Papua New Guinea. The western half, known as Western New Guinea,[2] forms a part of Indonesia and is organized as the provinces of Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, South Papua, Southwest Papua, and West Papua. The largest cities on the island are Jayapura (capital of Papua, Indonesia) and Port Moresby (capital of Papua New Guinea).\n\n\n\n\n## Names[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1644 map of New Guinea and the surrounding area\nThe island has been known by various names:\n\n\nThe name *Papua* was used to refer to parts of the island before contact with the West.[3] Its etymology is unclear;[3] one theory states that it derived from Tidore, the language used by the Sultanate of Tidore.[1] An expedition by the Sultan of Tidore, together with Sahmardan, the *Sangaji* of Patani, and the Papuan Gurabesi, managed to conquer some areas in New Guinea, which was then reorganised to form *Korano Ngaruha* (\"Four Kings\") or Raja Ampat, *Papoua Gam Sio* (lit. \"The Papua Nine *Negeri*\"), and *Mafor Soa Raha* (lit. The Mafor \"Four *Soa*\"). The name comes from the words *papo* (\"to unite\") and *ua* (negation), which means \"not united\", i.e. an outlying possession of Tidore.[1][4][5]\n\n\nAnton Ploeg reports that the word *papua* is often said to be derived from the Malay word *papua* or *pua-pua*, meaning \"frizzly-haired\", referring to the very curly hair of the island's inhabitants.[6] However Sollewijn Gelpke in 1993 considered this unlikely as it had been used earlier, and he instead derived it from the Biak phrase *sup i babwa*, which means \"the land below [the sunset]\", and refers to the Raja Ampat Islands. \n\n\nWhen Portuguese and Spanish explorers arrived via the Spice Islands, they also used the name *Papua*.[1][7] However, Westerners, beginning with Spanish explorer Yñigo Ortiz de Retez in 1545, used the name *New Guinea*, due to the resemblance between the indigenous peoples of the island and Africans of the Guinea region.[1] The name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning \"land of the blacks\" or similar meanings.\n\n\nThe Dutch, who arrived later under Jacob Le Maire and Willem Schouten, called it *Schouten island*. They later used this name only to refer to islands off the north coast of Papua proper, the Schouten Islands or Biak Island. When the Dutch colonized the main island as part of the Dutch East Indies, they called it *Nieuw Guinea*.[1]\n\n\nThe name *Irian* was used in the Indonesian language to refer to the island and Indonesian province, as *Irian Barat* (West Irian) Province and later *Irian Jaya* Province. The name Irian was suggested during a tribal committee meeting in Tobati, Jayapura, formed by Soegoro Atmoprasodjo under governor JP van Eechoed, to decide on a new name because of the negative association of *Papua*. Frans Kaisiepo, the committee leader, suggested the name from Mansren Koreri myths, *Iri-an* from the Biak language of Biak Island, meaning \"hot land\" (referring to the climate), but also from *Iryan* which means heated process as a metaphor for a land that is entering a new era. In Serui *Iri-an* (lit. \"land-nation\") means \"pillar of nation\", while in Merauke *Iri-an* (lit. \"placed higher-nation\") means \"rising spirit\" or \"to rise\".[5][8] The name was promoted in 1945 by Marcus Kaisiepo, brother of Frans Kaisiepo.[3] The name was politicized later by Corinus Krey,[9] Marthen Indey, Silas Papare, and others with the Indonesian backronym *Ikut Republik Indonesia Anti Nederland* (\"Join the Republic of Indonesia Oppose the Netherlands\").[10][5] *Irian* was used somewhat in 1972.[11] The name was used until 2001, when *Papua* was again used for the island and the province. The name *Irian*, which was originally favored by natives, is now considered to be a name imposed by the authority of Jakarta.[3]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Regions of Oceania: Australasia, Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia. Physiographically, Australasia includes the Australian landmass (including Tasmania), New Zealand, and New Guinea\n![](image)New Guinea located in relation to Melanesia\n![](image)New Guinea map of Köppen climate classificationSee also: List of highest mountains of New Guinea\n\nNew Guinea is an island to the north of the Australian mainland, south of the equator. It is isolated by the Arafura Sea to the west, and the Torres Strait and Coral Sea to the east. Sometimes considered to be the easternmost island of the Indonesian archipelago, it lies north of Australia's Top End, the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cape York Peninsula, and west of the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon Islands archipelago.\n\n\nPolitically, the western half of the island comprises six provinces of Indonesia: Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, South Papua, West Papua and Southwest Papua. The eastern half forms the mainland of the country of Papua New Guinea.\n\n\n\n![](image)Topographical map of New Guinea The shape of New Guinea is often compared to that of a bird-of-paradise (indigenous to the island), and this results in the usual names for the two extremes of the island: the Bird's Head Peninsula in the northwest (*Vogelkop* in Dutch, *Kepala Burung* in Indonesian; also known as the Doberai Peninsula), and the Bird's Tail Peninsula in the southeast (also known as the Papuan Peninsula).\n\n\nA spine of east–west mountains, the New Guinea Highlands, dominates the geography of New Guinea, stretching over 1,600 km (1,000 mi) across the island, with many mountains over 4,000 m (13,100 ft). The western half of the island contains the highest mountains in Oceania, with its highest point, Puncak Jaya, reaching an elevation of 4,884 m (16,023 ft). The tree line is around 4,000 m (13,100 ft) elevation, and the tallest peaks contain equatorial glaciers—which have been retreating since at least 1936.[12][13][14] Various other smaller mountain ranges occur both north and west of the central ranges. Except in high elevations, most areas possess a warm humid climate throughout the year, with some seasonal variation associated with the northeast monsoon season.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mount Bosavi\nAnother major habitat feature is the vast southern and northern lowlands. Stretching for hundreds of kilometres, these include lowland rainforests, extensive wetlands, savanna grasslands, and some of the largest expanses of mangrove forest in the world. The southern lowlands are the site of Lorentz National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The northern lowlands are drained principally by the Mamberamo River and its tributaries on the western side, and by the Sepik on the eastern side. The more extensive southern lowlands are drained by a larger number of rivers, principally the Digul in the west and the Fly in the east. The largest island offshore, Dolak, lies near the Digul estuary, separated by a strait so narrow it has been named a \"creek\".\n\n\nNew Guinea contains many of the world's ecosystem types: glacial, alpine tundra, savanna, montane and lowland rainforest, mangroves, wetlands, lake and river ecosystems, seagrasses, and some of the richest coral reefs on the planet.\n\n\nThe entire length of the New Guinea Highlands system passes through New Guinea as a vast watershed. The northern rivers flow into the Pacific Ocean, the southern rivers into the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Papua. On the north side, the largest rivers are the Mamberamo, Sepik and Ramu.\nMamberamo was born from the confluence of two large inland rivers. Tariku comes from the west to the east and Taritatu from the east. These rivers meander through swamps with huge internal descents and then merge. The Mamberamo thus formed reaches the ocean by breaking through the Coastal Mountains. Mamberamo River is navigable to Marine Falls. The Sepik is a much more important river. Similarly, it collects water from a spacious pool. It is 1,100 kilometers from the Victor Emanuel Range to the estuary, making it the longest river in New Guinea. The winding, muddy, sluggish river can be navigated for 500 km. Ramu is a 650 km long river. Its lower section is navigable, but its upper flow is high-falling, fast-flowing. The energy of the river is used by a power plant near the city of Kainantu.\n\n\nOn the south side, the most significant rivers are Pulau, Digul, Fly, Kikori and Purari. The largest river in the western part of the island is Digul. It originates from the Star Mountains, which rise to an altitude of 4,700 m. The coastal plain is bordered by a swamp world hundreds of kilometers wide. Digul is the main transport route to the fertile hills and mountains within the island. The river Fly is born near the eastern branches of the Digul. It is named after one of the ships of the English Royal Fleet, which first sailed into the mouth of the river in 1845. The total length of the river is 1,050 km. Smaller boats can sail 900 km on the river. The estuary section, which decomposes into islands, is 70 km wide. The tide of the sea can have an effect of up to 300 kilometers. Strickland, a tributary of the Fly, reaches the Papuan Plain through wild gorges. Fly and Strickland together form the largest river in New Guinea. The many rivers flowing into the Gulf of Papua form a single delta complex. The rivers of the island are extremely rich in water due to the annual rainfall of 2,000–10,000 mm. According to a modest calculation, the New Guinea River carries about 1,500 km3/a (48,000 m3/s) of water into the sea. Fly alone carries more water 238 km3/a (7,500 m3/s) than all the rivers in Australia combined.[15]\n\n\n\n## Relation to surroundings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Highlands of Papua New Guinea\nThe island of New Guinea lies to the east of the Malay Archipelago, with which it is sometimes included as part of a greater Indo-Australian Archipelago.[16] Geologically it is a part of the same tectonic plate as Australia. When world sea levels were low, the two shared shorelines (which now lie 100 to 140 metres below sea level),[17] and combined with lands now inundated into the tectonic continent of Sahul,[18][19] also known as Greater Australia.[20] The two landmasses became separated when the area now known as the Torres Strait flooded after the end of the last glacial period.\n\n\nAnthropologically, New Guinea is considered part of Melanesia.[21]\n\n\nNew Guinea is differentiated from its drier, flatter,[22] and less fertile[23][24] southern counterpart, Australia, by its much higher rainfall and its active volcanic geology. Yet the two land masses share a similar animal fauna, with marsupials, including wallabies and possums, and the egg-laying monotreme, the echidna. Other than bats and some two dozen indigenous rodent genera,[25] there are no pre-human indigenous placental mammals. Pigs, several additional species of rats, and the ancestor of the New Guinea singing dog were introduced with human colonization.\n\n\nPrior to the 1970s, archaeologists called the single Pleistocene landmass by the name *Australasia*,[18] although this word is most often used for a wider region that includes lands, such as New Zealand, which are not on the same continental shelf. In the early 1970s, they introduced the term *Greater Australia* for the Pleistocene continent.[18] Then, at a 1975 conference and consequent publication,[19] they extended the name *Sahul* from its previous use for just the Sahul Shelf to cover the continent.[18]\n\n\n\n## Political divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Political divisions of New Guinea\n![](image)Papua province\n Highland Papua province\n Central Papua province\n South Papua province\n West Papua province, which was divided in December 2022[26]\n\nThe island of New Guinea is divided politically into roughly equal halves across a north–south line:\n\n\n\n* The western portion of the island located west of 141°E longitude (except for a small section of territory to the east of the Fly River which belongs to Papua New Guinea) was formerly a Dutch colony, part of the Dutch East Indies. After the West New Guinea dispute it is now six Indonesian provinces:\n\t+ West Papua with Manokwari as its capital.\n\t+ Papua with the city of Jayapura as its capital.\n\t+ Highland Papua with Jayawijaya Regency as its capital.\n\t+ Central Papua with Nabire Regency as its capital.\n\t+ South Papua with Merauke Regency as its capital.\n\t+ Southwest Papua with Sorong as its capital\n* The eastern part forms the mainland of Papua New Guinea, which has been an independent country since 1975. It was formerly the Territory of Papua and New Guinea governed by Australia, consisting of the Trust Territory of New Guinea (northeastern quarter, formerly German New Guinea), and the Territory of Papua (southeastern quarter). Three of Papua New Guinea's four regions are parts of New Guinea island:\n\t+ Southern, consisting of Western, Gulf, Central, Oro (Northern) and Milne Bay provinces.\n\t+ Highlands, consisting of Southern Highlands, Hela Province, Jiwaka Province, Enga Province, Western Highlands, Simbu and Eastern Highlands provinces.\n\t+ Momase, consisting of Morobe, Madang, East Sepik and Sandaun (West Sepik) provinces.\n\n\n## People[edit]\n\n\nSee also: People of New Guinea\n\n![](image)Yali tribesman in the Baliem Valley\nThe current population of the island of New Guinea is about fifteen million. Archaeological evidence indicates that humans may have inhabited the island continuously since 50,000 BCE,[27][28] and first settlement possibly dating back to 60,000 years ago has been proposed. The island is presently populated by almost a thousand different tribal groups and a near-equivalent number of separate languages, which makes New Guinea the most linguistically diverse area in the world. Ethnologue's 14th edition lists 826 languages of Papua New Guinea and 257 languages of Western New Guinea, total 1073 languages, with 12 languages overlapping.[*clarification needed*] They can be divided into two groups, the Austronesian languages, and all the others placed in the catch-all category of Papuan languages, most of which are unrelated.[29]\n\n\nThe separation is not merely linguistic; warfare among societies was a factor in the evolution of the *men's house*: separate housing for groups of adult men, away from the single-family houses of women and children.[*citation needed*] Pig-based trade between groups and pig-based feasts form a common tradition with the other peoples of southeast Asia and Oceania. Most Papuan societies practice agriculture, supplemented by hunting and gathering.\n\n\n\n![](image)Yali Mabel, Kurulu Village War Chief at Baliem Valley\nCurrent evidence indicates that the Papuans (who constitute the majority of the island's peoples) are descended from the earliest human inhabitants of New Guinea. These original inhabitants first arrived in New Guinea at a time around the Last Glacial Maximum (c. 21,000 years ago) when the island was connected to the Australian continent via a land bridge, forming the landmass of Sahul. These peoples had made the (shortened) sea-crossing from the islands of Wallacea and Sundaland (the present Malay Archipelago) by at least 40,000 years ago.\n\n\n\n![](image)Korowai tribesman\nThe ancestral Austronesian peoples are believed to have arrived considerably later, approximately 3,500 years ago, as part of a gradual seafaring migration from Southeast Asia, possibly originating in Taiwan. Austronesian-speaking peoples colonized many of the offshore islands to the north and east of New Guinea, such as New Ireland and New Britain, with settlements also on the coastal fringes of the main island in places. Human habitation of New Guinea over tens of thousands of years has led to a great deal of diversity, which was further increased by the later arrival of the Austronesians and the more recent history of European and Asian settlement through events like transmigration. \n\n\nLarge areas of New Guinea are yet to be explored by scientists and anthropologists. The Indonesian province of West Papua is home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups.[30]\n\n\n\n## Biodiversity and ecology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fauna of New Guinea\n\nWith some 786,000 km2 of tropical land—less than one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the Earth's surface—New Guinea has an immense biodiversity, containing between 5 and 10 percent of the total species on the planet. This percentage is about the same amount as that found in the United States or Australia. A high percentage of New Guinea's species are endemic, and thousands are still unknown to science: probably well over 200,000 species of insect, between 11,000 and 20,000 plant species, and over 650 resident bird species. Most of these species are shared, at least in their origin, with the continent of Australia, which was until fairly recent geological times part of the same landmass (see Australia-New Guinea for an overview). The island is so large that it is considered 'nearly a continent' in terms of its biological distinctiveness.\n\n\nIn the period from 1998 to 2008, conservationists identified 1,060 new species in New Guinea, including 218 plants, 43 reptiles, 12 mammals, 580 invertebrates, 134 amphibians, 2 birds and 71 fish.[31] Between 2011 and 2017, researchers described 465 previously undocumented plant species in New Guinea.[32] As of 2019, the Indonesian portion of New Guinea and the Maluku Islands is estimated to have 9,518 species of vascular plants, of which 4,380 are endemic. In 2020, an international study conducted by a team of 99 experts cataloged 13,634 species representing 1,742 genera and 264 families of vascular plants for New Guinea and its associated islands (Aru Islands, Bismarck Archipelago, D'Entrecasteaux Islands, Louisiade Archipelago), making it the world's most floristically diverse island, surpassing Madagascar (11,488), Borneo (11,165), Java (4,598), and the Philippines (9,432).[33]\n\n\n\n![](image)The raggiana bird-of-paradise is native to New Guinea.\n![](image)The floristic region of Malesia\nBiogeographically, New Guinea is part of Australasia rather than the Indomalayan realm, although New Guinea's flora has many more affinities with Asia than its fauna, which is overwhelmingly Australian. Botanically, New Guinea is considered part of Malesia, a floristic region that extends from the Malay Peninsula across Indonesia to New Guinea and the East Melanesian Islands. The flora of New Guinea is a mixture of many tropical rainforest species with origins in Asia, together with typically Australasian flora. Typical Southern Hemisphere flora include the conifers *Podocarpus* and the rainforest emergents *Araucaria* and *Agathis,* as well as tree ferns and several species of *Eucalyptus*.\n\n\nNew Guinea has 284 species and six orders of mammals: monotremes, three orders of marsupials, rodents and bats; 195 of the mammal species (69%) are endemic. New Guinea has 578 species of breeding birds, of which 324 species are endemic. The island's frogs are one of the most poorly known vertebrate groups, totalling 282 species, but this number is expected to double or even triple when all species have been documented. New Guinea has a rich diversity of coral life and 1,200 species of fish have been found. Also about 600 species of reef-building coral—the latter equal to 75 percent of the world's known total. The entire coral area covers 18 million hectares off a peninsula in northwest New Guinea.\n\n\n\n![](image)New Guinea crocodile\nAs of 2020, the Western portion of New Guinea, Papua and West Papua, accounts for 54% of the island's primary forest and about 51% of the island's total tree cover, according to satellite data.[34]\n\n\n\n### Ecoregions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ecoregions of New Guinea\n\n#### Terrestrial[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the WWF, New Guinea can be divided into twelve terrestrial ecoregions:[35]\n\n\n\n* Central Range montane rain forests\n* Central Range sub-alpine grasslands\n* Huon Peninsula montane rain forests\n* New Guinea mangroves\n* Northern New Guinea lowland rain and freshwater swamp forests\n* Northern New Guinea montane rain forests\n* Southeastern Papuan rain forests\n* Southern New Guinea freshwater swamp forests\n* Southern New Guinea lowland rain forests\n* Trans-Fly savanna and grasslands\n* Vogelkop montane rain forests\n* Vogelkop-Aru lowland rain forests\n\n\n![](image)Coral reefs in Papua New Guinea\n#### Freshwater[edit]\n\n\nThe WWF and Nature Conservancy divide New Guinea into five freshwater ecoregions:[36]\n\n\n\n* Vogelkop–Bomberai\n* New Guinea North Coast\n* New Guinea Central Mountains\n* Southwest New Guinea–Trans-Fly Lowland\n* Papuan Peninsula\n\n\n#### Marine[edit]\n\n\nThe WWF and Nature Conservancy identify several marine ecoregions in the seas bordering New Guinea:[37]\n\n\n\n* Papua\n* Bismarck Sea\n* Solomon Sea\n* Southeast Papua New Guinea\n* Gulf of Papua\n* Arafura Sea\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Papua New Guinea and History of Western New Guinea\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The continent of Sahul before the rising ocean sundered Australia and New Guinea after the last ice age\nThe first inhabitants Indigenous people of New Guinea, from whom the Papuan people are probably descended, adapted to the range of ecologies and, in time, developed one of the earliest known agricultures. Remains of this agricultural system, in the form of ancient irrigation systems in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, are being studied by archaeologists. Research indicates that the highlands were an early and independent center of agriculture, with evidence of irrigation going back at least 10,000 years.[38] Sugarcane was cultivated in New Guinea around 6000 BCE.[39]\n\n\nThe gardens of the New Guinea Highlands are ancient, intensive permacultures, adapted to high population densities, very high rainfalls (as high as 10,000 mm per year (400 in/yr)), earthquakes, hilly land, and occasional frost. Complex mulches, crop rotations and tillages are used in rotation on terraces with complex irrigation systems. Western agronomists still do not understand all of the practices, and it has been noted that native gardeners are as, or even more, successful than most scientific farmers in raising certain crops.[40] There is evidence that New Guinea gardeners invented crop rotation well before western Europeans.[41] A unique feature of New Guinea permaculture is the silviculture of *Casuarina oligodon*, a tall, sturdy native ironwood tree, suited to use for timber and fuel, with root nodules that fix nitrogen. Pollen studies show that it was adopted during an ancient period of extreme deforestation.\n\n\nIn more recent millennia, another wave of people arrived on the shores of New Guinea. These were the Austronesian people, who had spread down from Taiwan, through the South-east Asian archipelago, colonising many of the islands on the way. The Austronesian people had technology and skills extremely well adapted to ocean voyaging and Austronesian language speaking people are present along much of the coastal areas and islands of New Guinea. They also introduced pigs and dogs. These Austronesian migrants are considered the ancestors of most people in insular Southeast Asia, from Sumatra and Java to Borneo and Sulawesi, as well as coastal new Guinea.[42]\n\n\n\n### Precolonial history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Group of natives at Mairy Pass. Mainland of British New Guinea in 1885.\n![](image)Papuans on the Lorentz River, photographed during the third South New Guinea expedition in 1912–13\nThe western part of the island was in contact with kingdoms in other parts of modern-day Indonesia. The *Negarakertagama* mentioned the region of Wanin and Sran, in eastern Nusantara as part of Majapahit's tributary. This 'Wanin' has been identified with the Onin Peninsula, part of the Bomberai Peninsula near the city of Fakfak.[43][44], while 'Sran' had been identified as region of Kowiai, just south of Onin peninsula.[5] The sultans of Tidore, in the Maluku Islands, claimed sovereignty over various coastal parts of the island.[45] During Tidore's rule, the main exports of the island during this period were resins, spices, slaves and the highly priced feathers of the bird-of-paradise. In a period of constant conflict called 'hongi wars', in which rival villages or kingdoms would invoke the name of Tidore Sultan, rightly, for punitive expeditions for not fulfilling their tributary obligations, or opportunitively for competitions over resources and prestige.[45] Sultan Nuku, one of the most famous Tidore sultans who rebelled against Dutch colonization, called himself \"Sultan of Tidore and Papua\",[46] during his revolt in 1780s. He commanded loyalty from both Moluccan and Papuan chiefs, especially those of Raja Ampat Islands, from his base in Gebe. Following Tidore's subjugation as Dutch tributary, much of the territory it claimed in western part of New Guinea came under Dutch rule as part of Dutch East Indies.[46]\n\n\n\n### European contact[edit]\n\n\nThe first European contact with New Guinea was by Portuguese and Spanish sailors in the 16th century. In 1526–27, Portuguese explorer Jorge de Meneses saw the western tip of New Guinea and named it *ilhas dos Papuas*. In 1528, the Spanish navigator Álvaro de Saavedra also recorded its sighting when trying to return from Tidore to New Spain. In 1545, Spaniard Íñigo Ortíz de Retes sailed along the north coast of New Guinea as far as the Mamberamo River, near which he landed on 20 June, naming the island 'Nueva Guinea'.[47] The first map showing the whole island (as an island) was published in 1600[*citation needed*] and shows it as 'Nova Guinea'. In 1606, Luís Vaz de Torres explored the southern coast of New Guinea from Milne Bay to the Gulf of Papua including Orangerie Bay, which he named *Bahía de San Lorenzo*. His expedition also discovered Basilaki Island naming it *Tierra de San Buenaventura*, which he claimed for Spain in July 1606.[48] On 18 October, his expedition reached the western part of the island in present-day Indonesia, and also claimed the territory for the King of Spain.\n\n\n\n![](image)New Guinea from 1884 to 1919. The Netherlands controlled the western half of New Guinea, Germany the north-eastern part, and Britain the south-eastern part.\nA successive European claim occurred in 1828, when the Netherlands formally claimed the western half of the island as Netherlands New Guinea. Dutch colonial authority built Fort Du Bus an administrative and trading post established near Lobo, Triton Bay, but by 1835 had been abandoned.[49] Considering that New Guinea had little economic value for them, the Dutch promoted Tidore as suzerain of Papua. By 1849, Tidore's borders had been extended to the proximity of the current international border between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, as it formed extensive trade pact and custom of *Uli-Siwa* ( federation of nine ).[50]\n\n\nIn 1883, following a short-lived French annexation of New Ireland, the British colony of Queensland annexed south-eastern New Guinea. However, the Queensland government's superiors in the United Kingdom revoked the claim, and (formally) assumed direct responsibility in 1884, when Germany claimed north-eastern New Guinea as the protectorate of German New Guinea (also called Kaiser-Wilhelmsland).\n\n\nThe first Dutch government posts were established in 1898 and in 1902: Manokwari on the north coast, Fak-Fak in the west and Merauke in the south at the border with British New Guinea. The German, Dutch and British colonial administrators each attempted to suppress the still-widespread practices of inter-village warfare and headhunting within their respective territories.[51]\n\n\nIn 1905, the British government transferred some administrative responsibility over southeast New Guinea to Australia (which renamed the area \"Territory of Papua\"); and, in 1906, transferred all remaining responsibility to Australia. During World War I, Australian forces seized German New Guinea, which in 1920 became the Territory of New Guinea, to be administered by Australia under a League of Nations mandate. The territories under Australian administration became collectively known as The Territories of Papua and New Guinea (until February 1942).\n\n\nBefore about 1930, European maps showed the highlands as uninhabited forests.[52] When first flown over by aircraft, numerous settlements with agricultural terraces and stockades were observed. The most startling discovery took place on 4 August 1938, when Richard Archbold discovered the Grand Valley of the Baliem River, which had 50,000 yet-undiscovered Stone Age farmers living in orderly villages. The people, known as the Dani, were the last society of its size to make first contact with the rest of the world.[53] A 1930 expedition led by the prospector Michael Lehay also encountered an indigenous group in the highlands. The inhabitants, believing themselves to be the only people in the world and, having never seen Europeans before, initially believed the explorers to be spirits of the dead due to the local belief that a person's skin turned white when they died and crossed into the land of the dead.[54]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Japanese military map of New Guinea from 1943\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Guinea campaign\n\n![](image)Australian soldiers resting in the Finisterre Ranges of New Guinea while en route to the front line\nNetherlands New Guinea and the Australian territories (the eastern half ) were invaded in 1942 by the Japanese. The Netherlands were defeated by that stage and did not put up a fight, and the western section was not of any strategic value to either side, they did not battle there. The Japanese invaded the north shore of the Australia territories and were aiming to move south and take the southern shore too. The highlands, northern and eastern parts of the island became key battlefields in the South West Pacific Theatre of World War II. Notable battles were for Port Moresby ( the naval battle is known as the Battle of the Coral Sea), Milne Bay and for the Kakoda track. Papuans often gave vital assistance to the Allies, fighting alongside Australian troops, and carrying equipment and injured men across New Guinea. Approximately 216,000 Japanese, Australian and U.S. soldiers, sailors and airmen died during the New Guinea Campaign.[55]\n\n\n\n### Since World War II[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Papua conflict\n\nFollowing the return to civil administration after World War II, the Australian section was known as the Territory of Papua-New Guinea from 1945 to 1949 and then as Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Although the rest of the Dutch East Indies achieved independence as Indonesia on 27 December 1949, the Netherlands regained control of western New Guinea.\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of New Guinea, with place names as used in English in the 1940s\nDuring the 1950s, the Dutch government began to prepare Netherlands New Guinea for full independence and allowed elections in 1959; the partial elected New Guinea Council took office on 5 April 1961. The Council decided on the name of West Papua (*Papua Barat*) for the territory, along with an emblem, flag, and anthem to complement those of the Netherlands. On 1 October 1962, after some military interventions and negotiations, the Dutch handed over the territory to the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority, until 1 May 1963, when Indonesia took control. The territory was renamed West Irian (*Irian Barat*) and then Irian Jaya. In 1969, Indonesia, under the 1962 New York Agreement, organised a referendum named the Act of Free Choice, in which the military hand picked Papuan tribal elders to vote for integration with Indonesia.[56][57]\n\n\nThere has been significant reported resistance to Indonesian integration and occupation,[58] both through civil disobedience (such as publicly raising the Morning Star flag) and via the formation of the Organisasi Papua Merdeka (OPM, or Free Papua Movement) in 1965.[59] Amnesty International has estimated more than 100,000 Papuans, one-sixth of the population, have died as a result of government-sponsored violence against West Papuans.[60] Reports published by TRT World and De Gruyter Oldenbourg have put the number of killed Papuans since the start of the conflict at roughly 500,000.[61][62]\n\n\n\n![](image)Western New Guinea was formally annexed by Indonesia in 1969.\nFrom 1971, the name Papua New Guinea was used for the Australian territory. On 16 September 1975, Australia granted full independence to Papua New Guinea. In 2000, Irian Jaya was formally renamed \"The Province of Papua\" and a Law on Special Autonomy was passed in 2001. The Law established a Papuan People's Assembly (MRP) with representatives of the different indigenous cultures of Papua. The MRP was empowered to protect the rights of Papuans, raise the status of women in Papua, and to ease religious tensions in Papua; block grants were given for the implementation of the Law as much as $266 million in 2004.[63] The Indonesian courts' enforcement of the Law on Special Autonomy blocked further creation of subdivisions of Papua: although President Megawati Sukarnoputri was able to create a separate West Papua province in 2003 as a fait accompli, plans for a third province on western New Guinea were blocked by the courts.[64] Critics argue that the Indonesian government has been reluctant to establish or issue various government implementing regulations so that the legal provisions of special autonomy could be put into practice, and as a result special autonomy in Papua has \"failed\".[65][66]\n\n\nIn 2022, the Indonesian Government split Papuan Province into four provinces. In addition to Papua Province proper (capital Jayapura), the three new provinces are South Papua (capital Merauke), Central Papua (capital Nabire) and Highland Papua (capital Wamena).[67]\n\n\nThe culture of inter-tribal warfare and animosity between the neighboring tribes are still present in New Guinea.[68]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The alternative name *Nugini* is generally only used as part of the country name of Papua New Guinea, *Papua Nugini*, and of the names of the historical territories of Dutch New Guinea (*Nugini Belanda*), German New Guinea (*Nugini Jerman*), and Territory of New Guinea (*Teritori Nugini*). Thus, *Nugini* is effectively a fossil word.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Bilveer Singh (2008). *Papua: geopolitics and the quest for nationhood*.

It is the world's fourth largest island, the second-largest island country and the 44th largest country in the world.[13] Its capital and largest city is Antananarivo.\n\n\nMadagascar consists of the island of Madagascar and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from Africa during the Early Jurassic, around 180 million years ago, and split from the Indian subcontinent around 90 million years ago,[14] allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation; consequently, it is a biodiversity hotspot and one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries, with over 90% of wildlife being endemic. The island has a subtropical to tropical maritime climate.\n\n\nMadagascar was first settled during or before the mid first millennium AD by Austronesian peoples,[15] presumably arriving on outrigger canoes from present-day Indonesia.[16][17][18] These were joined around the ninth century AD by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique Channel from East Africa.[19] Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time, each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life. Subsequently, the Malagasy ethnic group is often divided into 18 or more subgroups, of which the largest are the Merina of the central highlands.\n\n\nUntil the late 18th century, the island of Madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting sociopolitical alliances. Beginning in the early 19th century, most of it was united and ruled as the Kingdom of Madagascar by a series of Merina nobles. The monarchy was ended in 1897 by the annexation by France, from which Madagascar gained independence in 1960. The country has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed republics, and has been governed as a constitutional democracy since 1992. Following a political crisis and military coup in 2009, Madagascar underwent a protracted transition towards its fourth and current republic, with constitutional governance being restored in January 2014.\n\n\nMadagascar is a member of the United Nations (UN), the African Union (AU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie. Malagasy and French are both official languages of the state. Christianity is the country's predominant religion, with a significant minority still practicing traditional faiths. Madagascar is classified as a least developed country by the UN.[20] Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health and private enterprise, are key elements of its development strategy. Despite substantial economic growth since the early 2000s, income disparities have widened, and quality of life remains low for the majority of the population. Madagascar is experiencing an ongoing famine, which experts argue is the first to be caused entirely by climate change.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nIn the Malagasy language, the island of Madagascar is called *Madagasikara* (Malagasy pronunciation: [madaɡasʲˈkʲarə̥]) and its people are referred to as *Malagasy*.[22][23] The origin of the name is uncertain,[24] and is likely foreign, having been propagated in the Middle Ages by Europeans.[25] If this is the case, it is unknown when the name was adopted by the inhabitants of the island. No single Malagasy-language name predating *Madagasikara* appears to have been used by the local population to refer to the island, although some communities had their own name for part or all of the land they inhabited.[26]\n\n\nOne hypothesis relates *Madagascar* to the word *Malay*, referring to the Austronesian origin of the Malagasy people in modern-day Indonesia. In a map by Muhammad al-Idrisi dating from the year 1154, the island is named *Gesira Malai*, or \"Malay island\" in Arabic. The inversion of this name to *Malai Gesira*, as it was known by the Greeks, is thought to be the precursor of the modern name of the island.[27] The name \"Malay island\" was later rendered in Latin as *Malichu*, an abbreviated form of *Malai Insula*, in the medieval Hereford Mappa Mundi as the name of Madagascar.[28][27]\n\n\nAnother hypothesis is that *Madagascar* is a corrupted transliteration of Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia and an important medieval Indian Ocean port. This would have resulted from 13th-century Venetian explorer Marco Polo confusing the two locations in his memoirs, in which he mentions the land of *Madageiscar* to the south of Socotra. This name would then have been popularized on Renaissance maps by Europeans.[25][26]\n\n\nThe name *Malagasikara*, or **Malagascar**, is also historically attested. A British state paper in 1699 records the arrival of eighty to ninety passengers from \"Malagaskar\" to New York City.[29] An 1882 edition of the British newspaper The Graphic referred to \"Malagascar\" as the name of the island, stating that it is etymologically a word of Malay origin, and may be related to the name of Malacca.[30] In 1891, Saleh bin Osman, a Zanzibari traveler, refers to the island as \"Malagaskar\" when recounting his journeys, including as part of the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition.[31] In 1905, Charles Basset wrote in his doctoral thesis that *Malagasikara* was the way the island is referred to by its natives, who emphasized that they were *Malagasy*, and not *Madagasy*.[32]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Madagascar\n\n### Early period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malagasy ancestry reflects a blend of Southeast Asian, Oceanian and Bantu (Southeast African) roots.\nTraditionally, archaeologists have estimated that the earliest settlers arrived in successive waves in outrigger canoes from South Borneo, possibly throughout the period between 350 BCE and 550 CE, while others are cautious about dates earlier than 250 CE. In either case, these dates make Madagascar one of the latest major landmasses on Earth to be settled by humans, predating the settlement of Iceland and New Zealand.[33] It is proposed that Ma'anyan people were brought as laborers and slaves by Javanese and Sumatran-Malays in their trading fleets to Madagascar.[34][35][36][37] Dates earlier than the mid-first millennium AD are not strongly supported.[15]\n\n\nUpon arrival, early settlers practiced slash-and-burn agriculture to clear the coastal rainforests for cultivation. The first settlers encountered Madagascar's abundance of megafauna,[38] including 17 species of giant lemurs, the large flightless elephant birds (including possibly the largest bird to ever exist, *Aepyornis maximus*), the giant fossa, and several species of Malagasy hippopotamus, which have since become extinct because of hunting and habitat destruction.[39] By 600 CE, groups of these early settlers had begun clearing the forests of the central highlands.[40]\n\n\nArab traders first reached the island between the 7th and 9th centuries.[41] A wave of Bantu-speaking migrants from southeastern Africa arrived around 1000 CE.[42] South Indian Tamil merchants arrived around 11th century. They introduced the zebu, a type of long-horned humped cattle, which they kept in large herds.[43] Irrigated paddy fields were developed in the central highland Betsileo Kingdom and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina a century later.[40] The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century.[43]\n\n\nThe oral histories of the Merina people, who may have arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1,000 years ago, describe encountering an established population they called the Vazimba. Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave, the Vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the Merina kings Andriamanelo, Ralambo, and Andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries.[44] Today, the spirits of the Vazimba are revered as *tompontany* (ancestral masters of the land) by many traditional Malagasy communities.[45]\n\n\n\n### Arab and European contacts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)European contact began in 1500 when Portuguese explorer Diogo Dias recorded the island while participating in the 2nd Portuguese India Armadas.\nThe written history of Madagascar began with the Arabs, who established trading posts along the northwest coast by at least the 10th century and introduced Islam, the Arabic script (used to transcribe the Malagasy language in a form of writing known as *sorabe*), Arab astrology, and other cultural elements.[46]\n\n\nEuropean contact began in 1500, when the Portuguese sea captain Diogo Dias sighted the island, while participating in the 2nd Armada of the Portuguese India Armadas.[47]\n\n\nMatatana was the first Portuguese settlement on the south coast, 10 km west of Fort Dauphin. In 1508, settlers there built a tower, a small village, and a stone column. This settlement was established in 1513 at the behest of the viceroy of Portuguese India, Jeronimo de Azevedo.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Matatana, represented in a picture of 1613, regarding a settlement of the beginning of the 16th century, in the Book of Humberto Leitão\"\nContacts continued from the 1550s. Several colonization and conversion missions were ordered by King João III and by the Viceroy of India, including one in 1553 by Baltazar Lobo de Sousa. In that mission, according to detailed descriptions by chroniclers Diogo do Couto and João de Barros, emissaries reached the inland via rivers and bays, exchanging goods and even converting one of the local kings.[49]\n\n\nThe French established trading posts along the east coast in the late 17th century.[46] From about 1774 to 1824, Madagascar gained prominence among pirates and European traders, particularly those involved in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The small island of Nosy Boroha off the northeastern coast of Madagascar has been proposed by some historians as the site of the legendary pirate utopia of Libertalia.[50] Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island, among them Robert Drury, whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century.[51]\n\n\nThe wealth generated by maritime trade spurred the rise of organized kingdoms on the island, some of which had grown quite powerful by the 17th century.[52] Among these were the Betsimisaraka alliance of the eastern coast and the Sakalava chiefdoms of Menabe and Boina on the west coast. The Kingdom of Imerina, located in the central highlands with its capital at the royal palace of Antananarivo, emerged at around the same time under the leadership of King Andriamanelo.[53]\n\n\n\n### Kingdom of Madagascar[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Merina Kingdom\n\n![](image)King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810)\nUpon its emergence in the early 17th century, the highland kingdom of Imerina was initially a minor power relative to the larger coastal kingdoms[53] and grew even weaker in the early 18th century when King Andriamasinavalona divided it among his four sons. Following almost a century of warring and famine, Imerina was reunited in 1793 by King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810).[54] From his initial capital Ambohimanga,[55] and later from the Rova of Antananarivo, this Merina king rapidly expanded his rule over neighboring principalities. His ambition to bring the entire island under his control was largely achieved by his son and successor, King Radama I (1810–28), who was recognized by the British government as King of Madagascar. Radama concluded a treaty in 1817 with the British governor of Mauritius to abolish the lucrative slave trade in return for British military and financial assistance. Artisan missionary envoys from the London Missionary Society began arriving in 1818 and included such key figures as James Cameron, David Jones and David Griffiths, who established schools, transcribed the Malagasy language using the Roman alphabet, translated the Bible, and introduced a variety of new technologies to the island.[56]\n\n\nRadama's successor, Queen Ranavalona I (1828–61), responded to increasing political and cultural encroachment on the part of Britain and France by issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of Christianity in Madagascar and pressuring most foreigners to leave the territory. William Ellis of the London Missionary Society described his visits made during her reign in his book *Three Visits to Madagascar during the years 1853, 1854, and 1856*. The Queen made heavy use of the traditional practice of *fanompoana* (forced labor as tax payment) to complete public works projects and develop a standing army of between 20,000 and 30,000 Merina soldiers, whom she deployed to pacify outlying regions of the island and further expand the Kingdom of Merina to encompass most of Madagascar. Residents of Madagascar could accuse one another of various crimes, including theft, Christianity and especially witchcraft, for which the ordeal of *tangena* was routinely obligatory. Between 1828 and 1861, the *tangena* ordeal caused about 3,000 deaths annually. In 1838, it was estimated that as many as 100,000 people in Imerina died as a result of the tangena ordeal, constituting roughly 20 percent of the population.[57] The combination of regular warfare, disease, difficult forced labor, and harsh measures of justice resulted in a high mortality rate among soldiers and civilians alike during her 33-year reign; the population of Madagascar is estimated to have declined from around 5 million to 2.5 million between 1833 and 1839.[58]\n\n\nAmong those who continued to reside in Imerina were Jean Laborde, an entrepreneur who developed munitions and other industries on behalf of the monarchy, and Joseph-François Lambert, a French adventurer and slave trader, with whom then-Prince Radama II signed a controversial trade agreement termed the Lambert Charter. Succeeding his mother, Radama II attempted to relax the queen's stringent policies, but was overthrown two years later by Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony and an alliance of *Andriana* (noble) and *Hova* (commoner) courtiers, who sought to end the absolute power of the monarch.[46]\n\n\nFollowing the coup, the courtiers offered Radama's queen, Rasoherina, the opportunity to rule, if she would accept a power sharing arrangement with the Prime Minister: a new social contract that would be sealed by a political marriage between them.[59] Queen Rasoherina accepted, first marrying Rainivoninahitriniony, then later deposing him and marrying his brother, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony, who would go on to marry Queen Ranavalona II and Queen Ranavalona III in succession.[60] Over the course of Rainilaiarivony's 31-year tenure as prime minister, numerous policies were adopted to modernize and consolidate the power of the central government.[61] Schools were constructed throughout the island and attendance was made mandatory. Army organization was improved and British consultants were employed to train and professionalize soldiers.[62] Polygamy was outlawed and Christianity, declared the official religion of the court in 1869, was adopted alongside traditional beliefs among a growing portion of the populace.[61] Legal codes were reformed on the basis of British common law and three European-style courts were established in the capital city.[62] In his joint role as Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony also successfully ensured the defense of Madagascar against several French colonial incursions.[62]\n\n\n\n### French colonization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Malagasy Protectorate and French Madagascar\n See also: Madagascar in World War II\n\n![](image)A French poster about the Franco-Hova War\nPrimarily on the basis that the Lambert Charter had not been respected, France invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the first Franco-Hova War.[63] At the end of the war, Madagascar ceded the northern port town of Antsiranana (Diego Suarez) to France and paid 560,000 francs to Lambert's heirs.[64] In 1890, the British accepted the full formal imposition of a French protectorate on the island, but French authority was not acknowledged by the government of Madagascar. To force capitulation, the French bombarded and occupied the harbor of Toamasina on the east coast, and Mahajanga on the west coast, in December 1894 and January 1895 respectively.[65]\n\n\nA French military flying column then marched toward Antananarivo, losing many men to malaria and other diseases. Reinforcements came from Algeria and Sub-Saharan Africa. Upon reaching the city in September 1895, the column bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, causing heavy casualties and leading Queen Ranavalona III to surrender.[66] France annexed Madagascar in 1896 and declared the island a colony the following year, dissolving the Merina monarchy and sending the royal family into exile on Réunion Island and to Algeria. A two-year resistance movement organized in response to the French capture of the royal palace was effectively put down at the end of 1897.[67]\n\n\nThe conquest was followed by ten years of civil war, due to the Menalamba insurrection. The \"pacification\" carried out by the French administration lasted more than fifteen years, in response to the rural guerrillas scattered throughout the country. In total, the repression of this resistance to colonial conquest caused several tens of thousands of Malagasy victims.[68]\n\n\nUnder colonial rule, plantations were established for the production of a variety of export crops.[69] Slavery was abolished in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed; many remained in their former masters' homes as servants[70] or as sharecroppers; in many parts of the island strong discriminatory views against slave descendants are still held today.[71] Wide paved boulevards and gathering places were constructed in the capital city of Antananarivo[72] and the Rova palace compound was turned into a museum.[73] Additional schools were built, particularly in rural and coastal areas where the schools of the Merina had not reached. Education became mandatory between the ages of 6 and 13 and focused primarily on French language and practical skills.[74]\n\n\n\n![](image)National monument in Moramanga commemorating the beginning of the Malagasy Uprising on 29 March 1947. Between 11,000 and 90,000 Malagasy died during the uprising which lasted nearly two years.[75]\nHuge mining and forestry concessions were granted to large companies. Native chiefs loyal to the French administration were also granted part of the land. Forced labor was introduced in favor of the French companies and peasants were encouraged, through taxation, to work for wages (especially in the colonial concessions) to the detriment of small individual farms. However, the colonial period was accompanied by movements fighting for independence: the Menalamba, the Vy Vato Sakelika, the Democratic Movement for Malagasy Renovation (MDRM). In 1927, major demonstrations were organized in Antananarivo, notably on the initiative of the communist activist François Vittori, who was imprisoned as a result. The 1930s saw the Malagasy anti-colonial movement gain further momentum. Malagasy trade unionism began to appear underground and the Communist Party of the Madagascar region was formed. But in 1939, all the organizations were dissolved by the administration of the colony, which opted for the Vichy regime. The MDRM was accused by the colonial regime of being at the origin of the 1947 insurrection and was pursued by violent repression.[76]\n\n\nThe Merina royal tradition of taxes paid in the form of labor was continued under the French and used to construct a railway and roads linking key coastal cities to Antananarivo.[77] Malagasy troops fought for France in World War I.[47] In the 1930s, Nazi political thinkers developed the Madagascar Plan that had identified the island as a potential site for the deportation of Europe's Jews.[78] During the Second World War, the island was the site of the Battle of Madagascar between the Vichy French and an Allied expeditionary force.[79]\n\n\nThe occupation of France during the Second World War tarnished the prestige of the colonial administration in Madagascar and galvanized the growing independence movement, leading to the Malagasy Uprising of 1947.[80] This movement led the French to establish reformed institutions in 1956 under the *Loi Cadre* (Overseas Reform Act), and Madagascar moved peacefully towards independence.[81] The Malagasy Republic was proclaimed on 14 October 1958, as an autonomous state within the French Community. A period of provisional government ended with the adoption of a constitution in 1959 and full independence on 26 June 1960.[82]\n\n\n\n### Independent state[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Malagasy Republic, Democratic Republic of Madagascar, and Third Republic of Madagascar\n\n![](image)Philibert Tsiranana, the first president of Madagascar (1960–1972)\nSince regaining independence, Madagascar has transitioned through four republics with corresponding revisions to its constitution. The First Republic (1960–72), under the leadership of French-appointed President Philibert Tsiranana, was characterized by a continuation of strong economic and political ties to France. Many high-level technical positions were filled by French expatriates, and French teachers, textbooks and curricula continued to be used in schools around the country. Popular resentment over Tsiranana's tolerance for this \"neo-colonial\" arrangement inspired a series of farmer and student protests that overturned his administration in 1972.[46]\n\n\nGabriel Ramanantsoa, a major general in the army, was appointed interim president and prime minister that same year, but low public approval forced him to step down in 1975. Colonel Richard Ratsimandrava, appointed to succeed him, was assassinated six days into his tenure. General Gilles Andriamahazo ruled after Ratsimandrava for four months before being replaced by another military appointee: Vice Admiral Didier Ratsiraka, who ushered in the Marxist–Leninist Second Republic that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993.[83]\n\n\nThis period saw a political alignment with the Eastern Bloc countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures stemming from the 1973 oil crisis, resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and a sharp decline in living standards,[46] and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and various bilateral donors in exchange for their bailout of the nation's broken economy.[84]\n\n\nRatsiraka's dwindling popularity in the late 1980s reached a critical point in 1991 when presidential guards opened fire on unarmed protesters during a rally. Within two months, a transitional government had been established under the leadership of Albert Zafy (1993–96), who went on to win the 1992 presidential elections and inaugurate the Third Republic (1992–2010).[85] The new Madagascar constitution established a multi-party democracy and a separation of powers that placed significant control in the hands of the National Assembly. The new constitution also emphasized human rights, social and political freedoms, and free trade.[46] Zafy's term, however, was marred by economic decline, allegations of corruption, and his introduction of legislation to give himself greater powers. He was consequently impeached in 1996, and an interim president, Norbert Ratsirahonana, was appointed for the three months prior to the next presidential election. Ratsiraka was then voted back into power on a platform of decentralization and economic reforms for a second term which lasted from 1996 to 2001.[84]\n\n\nThe contested 2001 presidential elections in which then-mayor of Antananarivo, Marc Ravalomanana, eventually emerged victorious, caused a seven-month standoff in 2002 between supporters of Ravalomanana and Ratsiraka. The negative economic impact of the political crisis was gradually overcome by Ravalomanana's progressive economic and political policies, which encouraged investments in education and ecotourism, facilitated foreign direct investment, and cultivated trading partnerships both regionally and internationally. National GDP grew at an average rate of 7 percent per year under his administration. In the latter half of his second term, Ravalomanana was criticised by domestic and international observers who accused him of increasing authoritarianism and corruption.[84]\n\n\nOpposition leader and then-mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, led a movement in early 2009 in which Ravalomanana was pushed from power in an unconstitutional process widely condemned as a *coup d'état*.[86] In March 2009, Rajoelina was declared by the Supreme Court as the President of the High Transitional Authority, an interim governing body responsible for moving the country toward presidential elections. In 2010, a new constitution was adopted by referendum, establishing a Fourth Republic, which sustained the democratic, multi-party structure established in the previous constitution.[85] Hery Rajaonarimampianina was declared the winner of the 2013 presidential election, which the international community deemed fair and transparent.[87]\n\n\nIn 2018 the first round of the presidential election was held on 7 November and the second round was held on 10 December. Three former presidents and the most recent president were the main candidates of the elections. Former president Andry Rajoelina won the second round of the elections. He was previously president from 2009 to 2014. Former president Marc Ravalomana lost the second round and he did not accept the results because of allegations of fraud. Ravalomana was president from 2002 to 2009. The most recent president Hery Rajaonarimampianina received very modest support in the first round. In January 2019 the High Constitutional Court declared Rajoelina as the winner of the elections and the new president.[88][89][90]\nIn June 2019 parliamentary elections the party of president Andry Rajoelina won absolute majority of the seats of the National Assembly. It received 84 seats and the supporters of former president Ravalomana got only 16 seats of 151 seats of the National Assembly. 51 seats of deputies were independent or represented small parties. President Rajoelina could rule as a strongman.[91]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Madagascar and Geology of Madagascar\n\n![](image)Land coverage (left) and topographical (right) maps of Madagascar\nAt 592,800 square kilometres (228,900 sq mi),[47] Madagascar is the world's 46th largest country,[92] the second-largest island country[13] and the fourth-largest island.[47] The country lies mostly between latitudes 12°S and 26°S, and longitudes 43°E and 51°E.[93] Neighboring islands include the French territory of Réunion and the country of Mauritius to the east, as well as the state of Comoros and the French territory of Mayotte to the north west. The nearest mainland state is Mozambique, located to the west.\n\n\nThe prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana resulted in the separation of East Gondwana (comprising Madagascar, Antarctica, Australia and the Indian subcontinent) and West Gondwana (Africa–South America) during the Jurassic period, around 185 million years ago. The Indo-Madagascar landmass separated from Antarctica and Australia around 125 million years ago[94] and Madagascar separated from the Indian landmass about 84–92 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous.[95] This long history of separation from other continents has allowed plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation. Along the length of the eastern coast runs a narrow and steep escarpment containing much of the island's remaining tropical lowland forest. To the west of this ridge lies a plateau in the center of the island ranging in altitude from 750 to 1,500 m (2,460 to 4,920 ft) above sea level. These central highlands, traditionally the homeland of the Merina people and the location of their historic capital at Antananarivo, are the most densely populated part of the island and are characterized by terraced, rice-growing valleys lying between grassy hills and patches of the subhumid forests that formerly covered the highland region. To the west of the highlands, the increasingly arid terrain gradually slopes down to the Mozambique Channel and mangrove swamps along the coast.[96]\n\n\nMadagascar's highest peaks rise from three prominent highland massifs: Maromokotro 2,876 m (9,436 ft) in the Tsaratanana Massif is the island's highest point, followed by Boby Peak 2,658 m (8,720 ft) in the Andringitra Massif, and Tsiafajavona 2,643 m (8,671 ft) in the Ankaratra Massif. To the east, the *Canal des Pangalanes* is a chain of human-made and natural lakes connected by canals built by the French just inland from the east coast and running parallel to it for some 600 km (370 mi).[97]\n\n\nThe western and southern sides, which lie in the rain shadow of the central highlands, are home to dry deciduous forests, spiny forests, and deserts and xeric shrublands. Due to their lower population densities, Madagascar's dry deciduous forests have been better preserved than the eastern rain forests or the original woodlands of the central plateau. The western coast features many protected harbors, but silting is a major problem caused by sediment from the high levels of inland erosion carried by rivers crossing the broad western plains.[97]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Köppen climate classification map of Madagascar\nSee also: Geography of Madagascar § Climate\n\nThe combination of southeastern trade winds and northwestern monsoons produces a hot rainy season (November–April) with frequently destructive cyclones, and a relatively cooler dry season (May–October). Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge much of their moisture over the island's eastern coast; the heavy precipitation supports the area's rainforest ecosystem. The central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still, and a semi-arid climate prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island.[96]\n\n\nTropical cyclones cause damage to infrastructure and local economies as well as loss of life.[46] In 2004, Cyclone Gafilo became the strongest cyclone ever recorded to hit Madagascar. The storm killed 172 people, left 214,260 homeless[98] and caused more than US$250 million in damage.[99] In February 2022, Cyclone Batsirai killed at least 10 people weeks after Cyclone Ana killed 55 and displaced 130,000 people on the island.[100]\n\n\n\n### Ecology[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Wildlife of Madagascar, Flora of Madagascar, Fauna of Madagascar, Agriculture in Madagascar, Ecoregions of Madagascar, and List of World Heritage Sites in Madagascar\n\n![](image)Comet orchid (*Angraecum sesquipedale*), the flowers of this orchid have a very long spur and are pollinated by a species of hawkmoth with a proboscis of matching length.\nAs a result of the island's long isolation from neighboring continents, Madagascar is home to various endemic plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth.[101][102] Approximately 90% of all plant and animal species found in Madagascar are endemic.[103] This distinctive ecology has led some ecologists to refer to Madagascar as the \"eighth continent\",[104] and the island has been classified by Conservation International as a biodiversity hotspot.[101] Madagascar is classed as one of 17 megadiverse countries. The country is home to seven terrestrial ecoregions: Madagascar lowland forests, Madagascar subhumid forests, Madagascar dry deciduous forests, Madagascar ericoid thickets, Madagascar spiny forests, Madagascar succulent woodlands, and Madagascar mangroves.[105]\n\n\nMore than 80 percent of Madagascar's 14,883 plant species are found nowhere else in the world, including five plant families.[106] The family *Didiereaceae*, composed of four genera and 11 species, is limited to the spiny forests of southwestern Madagascar.[96] Four-fifths of the world's *Pachypodium* species are endemic to the island.[107] Three-fourths[108] of Madagascar's 860[106] orchid species are found here alone, as are six of the world's nine baobab species.[109] The island is home to around 170 palm species, three times as many as on all of mainland Africa; 165 of them are endemic.[108] Many native plant species are used as herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions. The drugs vinblastine[110][111] and vincristine[110][112] are *vinca* alkaloids,[113][114] used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma,[115] leukemia,[116] and other cancers,[117] were derived from the Madagascar periwinkle.[118][119] The traveler's palm, known locally as *ravinala*[120] and endemic to the eastern rain forests,[121] is highly iconic of Madagascar and is featured in the national emblem as well as the Air Madagascar logo.[122]\n\n\n\n![Two ring-tailed lemurs curled up together](image)The ring-tailed lemur is one of over 100 known species and subspecies of lemur found only in Madagascar.[123]\nLike its flora, Madagascar's fauna is diverse and exhibits a high rate of endemism. Lemurs have been characterized as \"Madagascar's flagship mammal species\" by Conservation International.[101] In the absence of monkeys and other competitors, these primates have adapted to a wide range of habitats and diversified into numerous species. As of 2012[update], there were officially 103 species and subspecies of lemur,[124] 39 of which were described by zoologists between 2000 and 2008.[125] They are almost all classified as rare, vulnerable, or endangered. At least 17 species of lemur have become extinct since humans arrived on Madagascar, all of which were larger than the surviving lemur species.[126]\n\n\nA number of other mammals, including the catlike fossa, are endemic to Madagascar. Over 300 species of birds have been recorded on the island, of which over 60 percent (including four families and 42 genera) are endemic.[101] The few families and genera of reptiles that have reached Madagascar have diversified into more than 260 species, with over 90 percent of these being endemic[127] (including one endemic family).[101] The island is home to two-thirds of the world's chameleon species,[127] including the smallest known.[128]\n\n\nEndemic fish of Madagascar include two families, 15 genera and over 100 species, primarily inhabiting the island's freshwater lakes and rivers. Although invertebrates remain poorly studied in Madagascar, researchers have found high rates of endemism among the known species. All 651 species of terrestrial snail are endemic, as are a majority of the island's butterflies, scarab beetles, lacewings, spiders, and dragonflies.[101]\n\n\n\n### Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Deforestation in Madagascar, Illegal logging in Madagascar, and Climate change in Madagascar\n\n![Burning Malagasy rainforest](image)\n![A vast, red soil gully caused by erosion](image)\nTavy (slash-and-burn) destruction of native forest habitat is widespread (top), causing massive erosion (bottom).\n\nMadagascar's varied fauna and flora are endangered by human activity.[129] Since the arrival of humans around 2,350 years ago, Madagascar has lost more than 90 percent of its original forest.[130] This forest loss is largely fueled by *tavy* (\"fat\"), a traditional slash-and-burn agricultural practice imported to Madagascar by the earliest settlers.[43] Malagasy farmers embrace and perpetuate the practice not only for its practical benefits as an agricultural technique, but for its cultural associations with prosperity, health and venerated ancestral custom (*fomba malagasy*).[131] As human population density rose on the island, deforestation accelerated beginning around 1,400 years ago.[132] By the 16th century, the central highlands had been largely cleared of their original forests.[43] More recent contributors to the loss of forest cover include the growth in cattle herd size since their introduction around 1,000 years ago, a continued reliance on charcoal as a fuel for cooking, and the increased prominence of coffee as a cash crop over the past century.[133] Madagascar had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.63/10, ranking it 119th globally out of 172 countries.[134]\n\n\nAccording to a conservative estimate, about 40 percent of the island's original forest cover was lost from the 1950s to 2000, with a thinning of remaining forest areas by 80 percent.[135] In addition to traditional agricultural practice, wildlife conservation is challenged by the illicit harvesting of protected forests, as well as the state-sanctioned harvesting of precious woods within national parks. Although banned by then-President Marc Ravalomanana from 2000 to 2009, the collection of small quantities of precious timber from national parks was re-authorized in January 2009 and dramatically intensified under the administration of Andry Rajoelina as a key source of state revenues to offset cuts in donor support following Ravalomanana's ousting.[136]\n\n\nInvasive species have likewise been introduced by human populations. Following the 2014 discovery in Madagascar of the Asian common toad, a relative of a toad species that has severely harmed wildlife in Australia since the 1930s, researchers warned the toad could \"wreak havoc on the country's unique fauna.\"[137] Habitat destruction and hunting have threatened many of Madagascar's endemic species or driven them to extinction. The island's elephant birds, a family of endemic giant ratites, became extinct in the 17th century or earlier, most probably because of human hunting of adult birds and poaching of their large eggs for food.[138] Numerous giant lemur species vanished with the arrival of human settlers to the island, while others became extinct over the course of the centuries as a growing human population put greater pressures on lemur habitats and, among some populations, increased the rate of lemur hunting for food.[139] A July 2012 assessment found that the exploitation of natural resources since 2009 has had dire consequences for the island's wildlife: 90 percent of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction, the highest proportion of any mammalian group. Of these, 23 species were classified as critically endangered. A 2023 study published in *Nature Communications* found that 120 of the 219 mammal species only found on Madagascar are threatened with extinction.[140]\n\n\nIn 2003, Ravalomanana announced the Durban Vision, an initiative to more than triple the island's protected natural areas to over 60,000 km2 (23,000 sq mi) or 10 percent of Madagascar's land surface. As of 2011[update], areas protected by the state included five Strict Nature Reserves (*Réserves Naturelles Intégrales*), 21 Wildlife Reserves (*Réserves Spéciales*) and 21 National Parks (*Parcs Nationaux*).[141] In 2007 six of the national parks were declared a joint World Heritage Site under the name Rainforests of the Atsinanana. These parks are Marojejy, Masoala, Ranomafana, Zahamena, Andohahela and Andringitra.[142] Local timber merchants are harvesting scarce species of rosewood trees from protected rainforests within Marojejy National Park and exporting the wood to China for the production of luxury furniture and musical instruments.[143]\n\n\nMid-2021 marked the beginning of the 2021–2022 Madagascar famine which, due to a severe drought, caused hundreds of thousands of people to face food insecurity and over one million people were on the verge of a famine.[144]\n\n\nA 2022 analysis found that the expected costs for Madagascar, to adapt to and avert the environmental consequences of climate change, are going to be high.[145]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Madagascar and Cabinet of Madagascar\n\n![](image)Antananarivo is the political and economic capital of Madagascar.\nMadagascar is a semi-presidential representative democratic multi-party republic, wherein the popularly elected president is the head of state and selects a prime minister, who recommends candidates to the president to form his cabinet of ministers. According to the constitution, executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the ministerial cabinet,[146] the Senate and the National Assembly, although in reality these two latter bodies have very little power or legislative role. The constitution establishes independent executive, legislative and judicial branches and mandates a popularly elected president limited to three five-year terms.[47]\n\n\nThe public directly elects the president and the 127 members of the National Assembly to five-year terms. All 33 members of the Senate serve six-year terms, with 22 senators elected by local officials and 11 appointed by the president. The last National Assembly election was held on 20 December 2013[47] and the last Senate election was held on 30 December 2015.[147]\n\n\nAt the local level, the island's 22 provinces are administered by a governor and provincial council. Provinces are further subdivided into regions and communes. The judiciary is modeled on the French system, with a High Constitutional Court, High Court of Justice, Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, criminal tribunals, and tribunals of first instance.[148] The courts, which adhere to civil law, lack the capacity to quickly and transparently try the cases in the judicial system, often forcing defendants to pass lengthy pretrial detentions in unsanitary and overcrowded prisons.[149]\n\n\nAntananarivo is the administrative capital and largest city of Madagascar.[47] It is located in the highlands region, near the geographic center of the island. King Andrianjaka founded Antananarivo as the capital of his Imerina Kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured Vazimba capital on the hilltop of Analamanga.[44] As Merina dominance expanded over neighboring Malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the Kingdom of Madagascar, Antananarivo became the center of administration for virtually the entire island. In 1896 the French colonizers of Madagascar adopted the Merina capital as their center of colonial administration. The city remained the capital of Madagascar after regaining independence in 1960. In 2017, the capital's population was estimated at 1,391,433 inhabitants.[150] The next largest cities are Antsirabe (500,000), Toamasina (450,000) and Mahajanga (400,000).[47]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Madagascar, Foreign relations of Madagascar, and Human rights in Madagascar\n\n![](image)Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina\nSince Madagascar gained independence from France in 1960, the island's political transitions have been marked by numerous popular protests, several disputed elections, an impeachment, two military coups and one assassination. The island's recurrent political crises are often prolonged, with detrimental effects on the local economy, international relations and Malagasy living standards. The eight-month standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana following the 2001 presidential elections cost Madagascar millions of dollars in lost tourism and trade revenue as well as damage to infrastructure, such as bombed bridges and buildings damaged by arson.[151] A series of protests led by Andry Rajoelina against Ravalomanana in early 2009 became violent, with more than 170 people killed.[152] Modern politics in Madagascar are colored by the history of Merina subjugation of coastal communities under their rule in the 19th century. The consequent tension between the highland and coastal populations has periodically flared up into isolated events of violence.[153]\n\n\nMadagascar has historically been perceived as being on the margin of mainstream African affairs despite being a founding member of the Organisation of African Unity, which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to be replaced by the African Union. Madagascar was not permitted to attend the first African Union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election, but rejoined the African Union in July 2003 after a 14-month hiatus. Madagascar was again suspended by the African Union in March 2009 following the unconstitutional transfer of executive power to Rajoelina.[154] Madagascar is a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States military.[47] Eleven countries have established embassies in Madagascar, including France, the United Kingdom, the United States, China and India,[155] while Madagascar has embassies in sixteen other countries.\n\n\nHuman rights in Madagascar are protected under the constitution and the state is a signatory to numerous international agreements including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.[156] Religious, ethnic and sexual minorities are protected under the law. Freedom of association and assembly are also guaranteed under the law, although in practice the denial of permits for public assembly has occasionally been used to impede political demonstrations.[136][156] Torture by security forces is rare and state repression is low relative to other countries with comparably few legal safeguards, although arbitrary arrests and the corruption of military and police officers remain problems. Ravalomanana's 2004 creation of BIANCO, an anti-corruption bureau, resulted in reduced corruption among Antananarivo's lower-level bureaucrats in particular, although high-level officials have not been prosecuted by the bureau.[136] Accusations of media censorship have risen due to the alleged restrictions on the coverage of government opposition.[157] Some journalists have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news.[158]\n\n\n\n### Military and law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Military of Madagascar and Law enforcement in Madagascar\n\nThe rise of centralized kingdoms among the Sakalava, Merina and other ethnic groups produced the island's first standing armies by the 16th century, initially equipped with spears but later with muskets, cannons and other firearms.[159] By the early 19th century, the Merina sovereigns of the Kingdom of Madagascar had brought much of the island under their control by mobilizing an army of trained and armed soldiers numbering as high as 30,000.[160] French attacks on coastal towns in the later part of the century prompted then-Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony to solicit British assistance to provide training to the Merina monarchy's army. Despite the training and leadership provided by British military advisers, the Malagasy army was unable to withstand French weaponry and was forced to surrender following an attack on the royal palace at Antananarivo. Madagascar was declared a colony of France in 1897.[161]\n\n\nThe political independence and sovereignty of the Malagasy armed forces, which comprises an army, navy and air force, was restored with independence from France in 1960.[162] Since this time the Malagasy military has never engaged in armed conflict with another state or within its own borders, but has occasionally intervened to restore order during periods of political unrest. Under the socialist Second Republic, Admiral Didier Ratsiraka instated mandatory national armed or civil service for all young citizens regardless of sex, a policy that remained in effect from 1976 to 1991.[163][164] The armed forces are under the direction of the Minister of Defense and have remained largely neutral during times of political crisis, as during the protracted standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana in the disputed 2001 presidential elections, when the military refused to intervene in favor of either candidate. This tradition was broken in 2009, when a segment of the army defected to the side of Andry Rajoelina, then-mayor of Antananarivo, in support of his attempt to force President Ravalomanana from power.[136]\n\n\nThe Minister of Interior is responsible for the national police force, paramilitary force (*gendarmerie*) and the secret police.[148] The police and gendarmerie are stationed and administered at the local level. However, in 2009 fewer than a third of all communes had access to the services of these security forces, with most lacking local-level headquarters for either corps.[165] Traditional community tribunals, called *dina*, are presided over by elders and other respected figures and remain a key means by which justice is served in rural areas where state presence is weak. Historically, security has been relatively high across the island.[136] Violent crime rates are low, and criminal activities are predominantly crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and petty theft, although child prostitution, human trafficking and the production and sale of marijuana and other illegal drugs are increasing.[148] Budget cuts since 2009 have severely impacted the national police force, producing a steep increase in criminal activity in recent years.[136]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Regions of Madagascar and Districts of Madagascar\n\nMadagascar is subdivided into 22 regions (*faritra*).[47] The regions are further subdivided into 119 districts, 1,579 communes, and 17,485 *fokontany*.[165]\n\n\n\n![](image)A map of Madagascar's regions\n\n\n**Regions and former provinces**[166]\n| New regions | Formerprovinces | Area inkm2 | Population2018[167] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Diana | Antsiranana | 19,993 | 889,962\n |\n| Sava | Antsiranana | 23,794 | 1,123,772\n |\n| Itasy | Antananarivo | 6,579 | 898,549\n |\n| Analamanga | Antananarivo | 17,346 | 3,623,925\n |\n| Vakinankaratra | Antananarivo | 17,884 | 2,079,659\n |\n| Bongolava | Antananarivo | 18,096 | 670,993\n |\n| Sofia (7) | Mahajanga | 50,973 | 1,507,591\n |\n| Boeny | Mahajanga | 31,250 | 929,312\n |\n| Betsiboka | Mahajanga | 28,964 | 393,278\n |\n| Melaky | Mahajanga | 40,863 | 308,944\n |\n| Alaotra Mangoro | Toamasina | 27,846 | 1,249,931\n |\n| Atsinanana | Toamasina | 22,031 | 1,478,472\n |\n| Analanjirofo | Toamasina | 21,666 | 1,150,089\n |\n| Amoron'i Mania | Fianarantsoa | 16,480 | 837,116\n |\n| Haute-Matsiatra | Fianarantsoa | 20,820 | 1,444,587\n |\n| Vatovavy-Fitovinany | Fianarantsoa | 20,740 | 1,440,657\n |\n| Atsimo-Atsinanana | Fianarantsoa | 16,632 | 1,030,404\n |\n| Ihorombe | Fianarantsoa | 26,046 | 418,520\n |\n| Menabe | Toliara | 48,814 | 692,463\n |\n| Atsimo-Andrefana | Toliara | 66,627 | 1,797,894\n |\n| Androy | Toliara | 18,949 | 900,235\n |\n| Anosy | Toliara | 29,505 | 809,051\n |\n| ***Totals*** |  | 591,896 | 25,674,196\n |\n\n\n### United Nations involvement[edit]\n\n\nMadagascar became a member state of the United Nations on 20 September 1960, shortly after gaining its independence on 26 June 1960.[168] As of January 2017, 34 police officers from Madagascar are deployed in Haiti as part of the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti.[169] Starting in 2015, under the direction of and with assistance from the UN, the World Food Programme started the Madagascar Country Programme with the two main goals of long-term development and reconstruction efforts, and addressing the food insecurity issues in the southern regions of Madagascar.[170] These goals plan to be accomplished by providing meals for specific schools in rural and urban priority areas and by developing national school feeding policies to increase consistency of nourishment throughout the country. Small and local farmers have also been assisted in increasing both the quantity and quality of their production, as well as improving their crop yield in unfavorable weather conditions.[170] In 2017, Madagascar signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[171]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Madagascar and Tourism in Madagascar\n\n![](image)Historical change in per capita GDP of Madagascar since 1950\n![](image)Nosy Iranja is one of the international tourism destinations in Madagascar\nMadagascar's GDP in 2015 was estimated at US$9.98 billion, with a per capita GDP of $411.82.[172][173] Approximately 69 percent of the population lives below the national poverty line threshold of one dollar per day.[174] During 2011–15, the average growth rate was 2.6% but was expected to have reached 4.1% in 2016, due to public works programs and a growth of the service sector.[175] The agriculture sector constituted 29 percent of Malagasy GDP in 2011, while manufacturing formed 15 percent of GDP. Madagascar's other sources of growth are tourism, agriculture and the extractive industries.[176] Tourism focuses on the niche eco-tourism market, capitalizing on Madagascar's unique biodiversity, unspoiled natural habitats, national parks and lemur species.[177] An estimated 365,000 tourists visited Madagascar in 2008, but the sector declined during the political crisis with 180,000 tourists visiting in 2010.[176] However, the sector has been growing steadily for a few years; In 2016, 293,000 tourists landed in the African island with an increase of 20% compared to 2015; For 2017 the country has the goal of reaching 366,000 visitors, while for 2018 government estimates are expected to reach 500,000 annual tourists.[178]\n\n\nThe island is still a very poor country in 2018; structural brakes remain in the development of the economy: corruption and the shackles of the public administration, lack of legal certainty, and backwardness of land legislation. The economy, however, has been growing since 2011, with GDP growth exceeding 4% per year;[179][180] almost all economic indicators are growing, the GDP per capita was around $1600 (PPP) for 2017,[181] one of the lowest in the world, although growing since 2012; unemployment was also cut, which in 2016 was equal to 2.1%[182] with a work force of 13.4 million as of 2017.[183] The main economic resources of Madagascar are tourism, textiles, agriculture, and mining.\n\n\nPoverty affects 92% of the population in 2017. The country ranks fourth in the world in terms of chronic malnutrition. Nearly one in two children under the age of five is stunted. In addition, Madagascar is among the five countries where access to water is the most difficult for the population. Twelve million people do not have access to clean water, according to the NGO WaterAid.[184]\n\n\n\n### Natural resources and trade[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toy animals made from raffia, a native palm[185]\nMadagascar's natural resources include a variety of agricultural and mineral products. Agriculture (including the growing of raffia), mining, fishing and forestry are mainstays of the economy. In 2017 the top exports were vanilla (US$894M), nickel metal (US$414M), cloves (US$288M), knitted sweaters (US$184M) and cobalt (US$143M).[186]\n\n\nMadagascar is the world's principal supplier of vanilla, cloves[187] and ylang-ylang.[98] The island supplies 80% of the world's natural vanilla.[188] Other key agricultural resources include coffee, lychees and shrimp. Key mineral resources include various types of precious and semi-precious stones, and it currently provides half of the world's supply of sapphires, which were discovered near Ilakaka in the late 1990s.[189]\n\n\nMadagascar has one of the world's largest reserves of ilmenite (titanium ore), as well as important reserves of chromite, coal, iron, cobalt, copper and nickel.[97] Several major projects are underway in the mining, oil and gas sectors that are anticipated to give a significant boost to the Malagasy economy. These include such projects as ilmenite and zircon mining at the Mandena mine by Rio Tinto,[190] extraction of nickel by the Ambatovy mine near Moramanga and its processing near Toamasina by Sherritt International,[191] and the development of the giant onshore heavy oil deposits at Tsimiroro and Bemolanga by Madagascar Oil.[192]\n\n\nExports formed 28 percent of GDP in 2009.[47] Most of the country's export revenue is derived from the textiles industry, fish and shellfish, vanilla, cloves and other foodstuffs.[176] France is the nation's main trading partner, although the United States, Japan and Germany also have strong economic ties.[97] The Madagascar-U.S. Business Council was formed in May 2003, as a collaboration between USAID and Malagasy artisan producers to support the export of local handicrafts to foreign markets.[193] Imports of such items as foodstuffs, fuel, capital goods, vehicles, consumer goods and electronics consume an estimated 52 percent of GDP. The main sources of Madagascar's imports include China,[194] France, Iran, Mauritius and Hong Kong.[47]\n\n\n\n### Infrastructure and media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in Madagascar, Telecommunications in Madagascar, and List of newspapers in Madagascar\n\n![](image)A news stand in Antananarivo\n![](image)In many places oxcarts are an important medium of transport, like in Ambatolampy\nIn 2010, Madagascar had approximately 7,617 km (4,730 mi) of paved roads, 854 km (530 mi) of railways and 432 km (270 mi) of navigable waterways.[12] The majority of roads in Madagascar are unpaved, with many becoming impassable in the rainy season. Largely paved national routes connect the six largest regional towns to Antananarivo, with minor paved and unpaved routes providing access to other population centers in each district.[46] Construction of the Antananarivo–Toamasina toll highway, the country's first toll highway, began in December 2022. The approximately US$1,000,000,000 infrastructure project, which will connect Madagascar's capital to its largest seaport, is expected to take four years to complete.[195] Another project meant to create 348 kilometers of roads and create better connections costs €235.5 million. This includes a €116 million grant from the European Union, a €110 million loan from the European Investment Bank, and €4.8 million in finance from the Republic of Madagascar.**[196]** Since 2016, €100.4 million has been paid to the Republic of Madagascar through this project.**[196]**[197]\n\n\nThere are several rail lines in Madagascar. Antananarivo is connected to Toamasina, Ambatondrazaka and Antsirabe by rail, and another rail line connects Fianarantsoa to Manakara. The most important seaport in Madagascar is located on the east coast at Toamasina. Ports at Mahajanga and Antsiranana are significantly less used because of their remoteness.[46] Madagascar's government hopes to expand the ports of Antsiranana in the north and Taolagnaro in the south, connecting them to improved road networks, since many imports are every day necessities and Madagascar also relies on export money.**[196]**[198][199] The island's newest port at Ehoala, constructed in 2008 and privately managed by Rio Tinto, will come under state control upon completion of the company's mining project near Tôlanaro around 2038.[190] Air Madagascar services the island's many small regional airports, which offer the only practical means of access to many of the more remote regions during rainy season road washouts.[46]\n\n\nRunning water and electricity are supplied at the national level by a government service provider, Jirama, which is unable to service the entire population. As of 2009[update], only 6.8 percent of Madagascar's *fokontany* had access to water provided by Jirama, while 9.5 percent had access to its electricity services.[165] Fifty-six percent of Madagascar's power is provided by hydroelectric power plants, with the remaining 44% provided by diesel engine generators.[200] Mobile telephone and internet access are widespread in urban areas but remain limited in rural parts of the island. Approximately 30% of the districts are able to access the nations' several private telecommunications networks via mobile telephones or land lines.[165] The World Bank estimates that 17 million people in Madagascar's rural areas live more than two kilometres away from an all-season road.[201] In Madagascar, 11% of the rural population has access to power.**[196]**[202]\n\n\nRadio broadcasts remain the principal means by which the Malagasy population access international, national, and local news. Only state radio broadcasts are transmitted across the entire island. Hundreds of public and private stations with local or regional range provide alternatives to state broadcasting.[149] In addition to the state television channel, a variety of privately owned television stations broadcast local and international programming throughout Madagascar. Several media outlets are owned by political partisans or politicians themselves, including the media groups MBS (owned by Ravalomanana) and Viva (owned by Rajoelina),[136] contributing to political polarization in reporting.\n\n\nThe media have historically come under varying degrees of pressure to censor their criticism of the government. Reporters are occasionally threatened or harassed, and media outlets are periodically forced to close.[149] Accusations of media censorship have increased since 2009 because of the alleged intensification of restrictions on political criticism.[156] Access to the internet has grown dramatically over the past decade, with an estimated 352,000 residents of Madagascar accessing the internet from home or in one of the nation's many internet cafés in December 2011.[149]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Madagascar and List of cities in Madagascar\n\n![map of Madagascar showing distribution of Malagasy ethnic subgroups](image)The regional distribution of Malagasy ethnic subgroups\nAgriculture has long influenced settlement on the island. Only 15% of the nation's 24,894,551 population live in the 10 largest cities.\n\n\nIn 2021, the population of Madagascar was estimated at 29 million, up from 2.2 million in 1900.[203][204][46] The annual population growth rate in Madagascar was approximately 2.9 percent in 2009.[47]\n\n\nApproximately 42.5 percent of the population is younger than 15 years of age, while 54.5 percent are between the ages of 15 and 64. Those aged 65 and older form 3 percent of the total population.[176] Only two general censuses, in 1975 and 1993, have been carried out after independence. The most densely populated regions of the island are the eastern highlands and the eastern coast, contrasting most dramatically with the sparsely populated western plains.[46]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups of Madagascar\n\nThe Malagasy ethnic group forms over 90 percent of Madagascar's population and is typically divided into 18 ethnic subgroups.[47] Recent DNA research revealed that the genetic makeup of the average Malagasy person constitutes an approximately equal blend of Southeast Asian, Oceanian and East African genes,[205][206][207] although the genetics of some communities show a predominance of Southeast Asian or East African origins or some Arab, Indian, or European ancestry.[208]\n\n\nSoutheast Asian features – specifically from the southern part of Borneo – are most predominant among the Merina of the central highlands,[153] who form the largest Malagasy ethnic subgroup at approximately 26 percent of the population, while certain communities among the western coastal peoples (collectively called *côtiers*) have relatively stronger East African features. The largest coastal ethnic subgroups are the Betsimisaraka (14.9 percent) and the Tsimihety and Sakalava (6 percent each).[46] Peoples along the east and southeastern coasts often have a roughly equal blend of Austronesian and Bantu ancestry; coastal peoples also usually show the largest genetic influence from the centuries of Arab, Somali, Gujarati, and Tamil traders and merchants of the area, compared to the inland highlander peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Malagasy ethnic subgroups | Regional concentration\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Antankarana, Sakalava, Tsimihety | Former Antsiranana Province; north and northwestern coasts\n |\n| Sakalava, Vezo | Former Mahajanga Province; western coast\n |\n| Betsimisaraka, Sihanaka, Bezanozano | Former Toamasina Province; eastern coast\n |\n| Merina | Former Antananarivo Province; central highlands\n |\n| Betsileo, Antaifasy, Antambahoaka, Antaimoro, Antaisaka, Tanala | Former Fianarantsoa Province; southeastern coast\n |\n| Mahafaly, Antandroy, Antanosy people, Bara, Vezo | Former Toliara Province; southern inland regions and coast\n |\n\n\nChinese, Indian and Comoran minorities are present in Madagascar, as well as a small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga.[46] By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples.[97] The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958[81] to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000 Comorans, 18,000 Indians, and 9,000 Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.[46]\n\n\n\n### Largest cities[edit]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or towns in MadagascarAccording to the 2018 Census[209]\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank\n | Name | Region | Municipal pop.\n |\n| 1 | Antananarivo | Analamanga | 1,275,207\n |\n| 2 | Toamasina | Atsinanana | 326,286\n |\n| 3 | Antsirabe | Vakinankaratra | 245,592\n |\n| 4 | Mahajanga | Boeny | 244,722\n |\n| 5 | Fianarantsoa | Haute Matsiatra | 189,879\n |\n| 6 | Toliara | Atsimo-Andrefana | 169,760\n |\n| 7 | Antsiranana | Diana | 131,165\n |\n| 8 | Hell-Ville | Diana | 109,365\n |\n| 9 | Sambava | Sava | 85,659\n |\n| 10 | Taolagnaro | Anosy | 67,188\n |\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Malagasy child\nMain articles: Malagasy language and Languages of Madagascar\n\nThe Malagasy language is of Malayo-Polynesian origin and is generally spoken throughout the island. The numerous dialects of Malagasy, which are generally mutually intelligible,[210] can be clustered under one of two subgroups: eastern Malagasy, spoken along the eastern forests and highlands including the Merina dialect of Antananarivo, and western Malagasy, spoken across the western coastal plains. The Malagasy language derives from the Southeast Barito languages, with the Ma'anyan language being its closest relative, incorporating numerous Malay and Javanese loanwords.[211][212]\n\n\nFrench became the official language during the colonial period, when Madagascar came under the authority of France. In the first national Constitution of 1958, Malagasy and French were named the official languages of the Malagasy Republic. Madagascar is a francophone country, and French is mostly spoken as a second language among the educated population and used for international communication.[46]\n\n\nNo official languages were mentioned in the Constitution of 1992, although Malagasy was identified as the national language. Nonetheless, many sources still claimed that Malagasy and French were official languages, eventually leading a citizen to initiate a legal case against the state in April 2000, on the grounds that the publication of official documents only in the French language was unconstitutional. The High Constitutional Court observed in its decision that, in the absence of a language law, French still had the character of an official language.[213]\n\n\nThe Constitution of 2007 recognised three official languages, Malagasy, French, and English.[214] A fourth Constitution, adopted in 2010 following a referendum,[1] recognised only Malagasy and French.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Madagascar\n\n![](image)Our Lady of La Salette Cathedral in Antsirabe\n![](image)Faravohitra Catholic Church in Antananarivo\nChristianity is the most widely professed religion in Madagascar. According to the most recent national census completed in 1993, a majority of the population (52 percent) adhered to indigenous beliefs, with Christianity being the largest single religion at 41 percent, followed by Islam at 7 percent. However, according to the Pew Research Center in 2020, 85% of the population identified as Christian, while just 4.5% practiced folk religions; Protestants comprise a plurality of Christians, followed by Roman Catholics.[215] In contrast, a 2020 study conducted by the Association of Religion Data Archives found 58.1% of the population was Christian, 2.1% Muslim, 39.2% practiced traditional faiths, and 0.6% was nonreligious or adhered to other faiths.[216][47]\n\n\nThe inconsistency in religious data reflects the common practice of alternating between religious identities or syncretizing different faith traditions. Christians integrate and combine their religious beliefs with the deeply rooted practice of honoring ancestors. For instance, they may bless their dead at church before proceeding with traditional burial rites or invite a Christian minister to consecrate a *famadihana* reburial.[217] Christianity is predominant in the highlands.[218] The Malagasy Council of Churches comprises the four oldest and most prominent Christian denominations of Madagascar (Roman Catholic, Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar, Lutheran, and Anglican) and has been influential in Malagasy politics.[219]\n\n\nThe veneration of ancestors has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building, as well as the highlands practice of the *famadihana*, whereby a deceased family member's remains are exhumed and re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds, before being replaced in the tomb. The *famadihana* is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor's memory, reunite with family and community, and enjoy a festive atmosphere. Residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party, where food and rum are typically served, and a *hiragasy* troupe or other musical entertainment is commonly present.[217] Consideration for ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to *fady*, taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them. It is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways, they may intervene on behalf of the living. Conversely, misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected. The sacrifice of zebu is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors. In addition, the Malagasy traditionally believe in a creator god, called Zanahary or Andriamanitra.[220]\n\n\nIslam was first brought to Madagascar in the Middle Ages by Arab and Somali Muslim traders, who established several Islamic schools along the eastern coast. While the use of Arabic script and loan words, and the adoption of Islamic astrology, would spread across the island, Islam took hold in only a handful of southeastern coastal communities. In 2020, Muslims constituted 2% of the population of Madagascar.[216][47] They are largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of Mahajanga and Antsiranana. Muslims are divided between ethnic Malagasy and Indians, Pakistanis and Comorans.\n\n\nHinduism was introduced to Madagascar through Gujarati people immigrating from the Saurashtra region of India in the late 19th century. Most Hindus in Madagascar speak Gujarati or Hindi at home, reflecting the faiths concentration among those of Indian ancestry.[221]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Madagascar\n\nMedical centers, dispensaries, and hospitals are found throughout the island, although they are concentrated in urban areas and particularly in Antananarivo. Access to medical care remains beyond the reach of many Malagasy, especially in the rural areas, and many recourse to traditional healers.[222] In addition to the high expense of medical care relative to the average Malagasy income, the prevalence of trained medical professionals remains extremely low. In 2010, Madagascar had an average of three hospital beds per 10,000 people and a total of 3,150 doctors, 5,661 nurses, 385 community health workers, 175 pharmacists, and 57 dentists for a population of 22 million. Fifteen percent of government spending in 2008 was directed toward the health sector. Approximately 70 percent of spending on health was contributed by the government, while 30 percent originated with international donors and other private sources.[223] The government provides at least one basic health center per commune. Private health centers are concentrated within urban areas and particularly those of the central highlands.[165]\n\n\nDespite these barriers to access, health services have shown a trend toward improvement over the past twenty years. Child immunizations against such diseases as hepatitis B, diphtheria, and measles increased an average of 60 percent in this period, indicating low but increasing availability of basic medical services and treatments. The Malagasy fertility rate in 2009 was 4.6 children per woman, declining from 6.3 in 1990. Teen pregnancy rates of 14.8 percent in 2011, much higher than the African average, are a contributing factor to rapid population growth.[223] In 2010, the maternal mortality rate was 440 per 100,000 births, compared to 373.1 in 2008 and 484.4 in 1990, indicating a decline in perinatal care following the 2009 coup. The infant mortality rate in 2011 was 41 per 1,000 births,[47] with an under-five mortality rate at 61 per 1,000 births.[224] Schistosomiasis, malaria, and sexually transmitted diseases are common in Madagascar, although infection rates of AIDS remain low relative to many countries in mainland Africa, at 0.2 percent of the adult population. The malaria mortality rate is also among the lowest in Africa at 8.5 deaths per 100,000 people, in part because of the highest frequency use of insecticide treated nets in Africa.[223] Adult life expectancy in 2009 was 63 years for men and 67 years for women.[223]\n\n\nMadagascar had outbreaks of the bubonic plague and pneumonic plague in 2017 (2575 cases, 221 deaths) and 2014 (263 confirmed cases, 71 deaths).[225] In 2019, Madagascar had a measles outbreak, resulting in 118,000 cases and 1,688 deaths. In 2020, Madagascar was also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Undernourishment and hunger rates were at 42% in 2018.[226] According to the United Nations, more than one million people in southern Madagascar are struggling to get enough to eat,[227] due to what could become the first famine caused by climate change.[228]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Madagascar\n\n![Students working in groups in classroom as teacher observes](image)Education access and quality were prioritized under Ravalomanana.\nPrior to the 19th century, all education in Madagascar was informal and typically served to teach practical skills as well as social and cultural values, including respect for ancestors and elders.[46] The first formal European-style school was established in 1818 at Toamasina by members of the London Missionary Society (LMS). The LMS was invited by King Radama I to expand its schools throughout Imerina to teach basic literacy and numeracy to aristocratic children. The schools were closed by Ranavalona I in 1835,[229] but reopened and expanded in the decades after her death.\n\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Madagascar had the most developed and modern school system in pre-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa. Access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas during the colonial period, with French language and basic work skills becoming the focus of the curriculum. During the post-colonial First Republic, a continued reliance on French nationals as teachers, and French as the language of instruction, displeased those desiring a complete separation from the former colonial power.[46] Consequently, under the socialist Second Republic, French instructors and other nationals were expelled, Malagasy was declared the language of instruction, and a large cadre of young Malagasy were rapidly trained to teach at remote rural schools under the mandatory two-year national service policy.[230]\n\n\nThis policy, known as *malgachization*, coincided with a severe economic downturn and a dramatic decline in the quality of education. Those schooled during this period generally failed to master the French language or many other subjects and struggled to find employment, forcing many to take low-paying jobs in the informal or black market that mired them in deepening poverty. Excepting the brief presidency of Albert Zafy, from 1992 to 1996, Ratsiraka remained in power from 1975 to 2001 and failed to achieve significant improvements in education throughout his tenure.[231]\n\n\nEducation was prioritized under the Ravalomanana administration (2002–09), and is currently free and compulsory from ages 6 to 13.[232] The primary schooling cycle is five years, followed by four years at the lower secondary level and three years at the upper secondary level.[46] During Ravalomanana's first term, thousands of new primary schools and additional classrooms were constructed, older buildings were renovated, and tens of thousands of new primary teachers were recruited and trained. Primary school fees were eliminated, and kits containing basic school supplies were distributed to primary students.[232]\n\n\nGovernment school construction initiatives have ensured at least one primary school per *fokontany* and one lower secondary school within each commune. At least one upper secondary school is located in each of the larger urban centers.[165] The three branches of the national public university are located at Antananarivo, Mahajanga, and Fianarantsoa. These are complemented by public teacher-training colleges and several private universities and technical colleges.[46]\n\n\nAs a result of increased educational access, enrollment rates more than doubled between 1996 and 2006. However, education quality is weak, producing high rates of grade repetition and dropout.[232] Education policy in Ravalomanana's second term focused on quality issues, including an increase in minimum education standards for the recruitment of primary teachers from a middle school leaving certificate (BEPC) to a high school leaving certificate (BAC), and a reformed teacher training program to support the transition from traditional didactic instruction to student-centered teaching methods to boost student learning and participation in the classroom.[233] Public expenditure on education was 2.8 percent of GDP in 2014. The literacy rate is estimated at 64.7%.[92]\n\n\nMadagascar was ranked 107th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[234]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Madagascar\n\nEach of the many ethnic subgroups in Madagascar adhere to their own set of beliefs, practices and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities. However, there are a number of core cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity. In addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize *fihavanana* (solidarity), *vintana* (destiny), *tody* (karma), and *hasina*, a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family. Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.[46][220]\n\n\nAlthough social castes are no longer legally recognized, ancestral caste affiliation often continues to affect social status, economic opportunity, and roles within the community.[235] Malagasy people traditionally consult *Mpanandro* (\"Makers of the Days\") to identify the most auspicious days for important events such as weddings or *famadihana*, according to a traditional astrological system introduced by Arabs. Similarly, the nobles of many Malagasy communities in the pre-colonial period would commonly employ advisers known as the *ombiasy* (from *olona-be-hasina*, \"man of much virtue\") of the southeastern Antemoro ethnic group, who trace their ancestry back to early Somali settlers.[236]\n\n\nThe diverse origins of Malagasy culture are evident in its tangible expressions. The most emblematic instrument of Madagascar, the *valiha*, is a bamboo tube zither carried to Madagascar by early settlers from southern Borneo, and is very similar in form to those found in Indonesia and the Philippines today.[237] Traditional houses in Madagascar are likewise similar to those of southern Borneo in terms of symbolism and construction, featuring a rectangular layout with a peaked roof and central support pillar.[238] Reflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors, tombs are culturally significant in many regions and tend to be built of more durable material, typically stone, and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living.[239] The production and weaving of silk can be traced back to the island's earliest settlers, and Madagascar's national dress, the woven *lamba*, has evolved into a varied and refined art.[240]\n\n\nThe Southeast Asian cultural influence is also evident in Malagasy cuisine, in which rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied by one of a variety of flavorful vegetable or meat dishes.[241] African influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner's wealth, traditions originating on the African mainland. Cattle rustling, originally a rite of passage for young men in the plains areas of Madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept, has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend their cattle with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers.[40]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Madagascar\n\n![](image)A Hiragasy dancer.\nA wide variety of oral and written literature has developed in Madagascar. One of the island's foremost artistic traditions is its oratory, as expressed in the forms of *hainteny* (poetry), *kabary* (public discourse) and *ohabolana* (proverbs).[242][243] An epic poem exemplifying these traditions, the *Ibonia*, has been handed down over the centuries in several different forms across the island, and offers insight into the diverse mythologies and beliefs of traditional Malagasy communities.[244] This tradition was continued in the 20th century by such artists as Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo, who is considered Africa's first modern poet,[245] and Elie Rajaonarison, an exemplar of the new wave of Malagasy poetry.[246] Madagascar has also developed a rich musical heritage, embodied in dozens of regional musical genres such as the coastal *salegy* or highland *hiragasy* that enliven village gatherings, local dance floors and national airwaves.[247] Madagascar also has a growing culture of classical music fostered through youth academies, organizations and orchestras that promote youth involvement in classical music.\n\n\nThe plastic arts are also widespread throughout the island. In addition to the tradition of silk weaving and lamba production, the weaving of raffia and other local plant materials has been used to create a wide array of practical items such as floor mats, baskets, purses and hats.[193] Wood carving is a highly developed art form, with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements. Sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods, *aloalo* funerary posts, and wooden sculptures, many of which are produced for the tourist market.[248] The decorative and functional woodworking traditions of the Zafimaniry people of the central highlands was inscribed on UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008.[249]\n\n\nAmong the Antaimoro people, the production of paper embedded with flowers and other decorative natural materials is a long-established tradition that the community has begun to market to eco-tourists.[248] Embroidery and drawn thread work are done by hand to produce clothing, as well as tablecloths and other home textiles for sale in local crafts markets.[193] Malagasy artists such as Madame Zo have incorporated textile traditions of Madagascar directly into their work.[250] A small but growing number of fine art galleries in Antananarivo, and several other urban areas, offer paintings by local artists, and annual art events, such as the Hosotra open-air exhibition in the capital, contribute to the continuing development of fine arts in Madagascar.[251]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Moraingy* is a traditional martial art of Madagascar.\nA number of traditional pastimes have emerged in Madagascar. *Moraingy*, a type of hand-to-hand combat, is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate.[252] The wrestling of zebu cattle, which is named savika or *tolon-omby*, is also practiced in many regions.[253] In addition to sports, a wide variety of games are played. Among the most emblematic is *fanorona*, a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King Andrianjaka after his father Ralambo was partially the result of the obsession that Andrianjaka's older brother may have had with playing *fanorona* to the detriment of his other responsibilities.[254]\n\n\nWestern recreational activities were introduced to Madagascar over the past two centuries. Rugby union is considered the national sport of Madagascar.[255] Soccer is also popular. Madagascar has produced a world champion in pétanque, a French game similar to lawn bowling, which is widely played in urban areas and throughout the Highlands.[256] School athletics programs typically include soccer, track and field, judo, boxing, women's basketball and women's tennis. Madagascar sent its first competitors to the Olympic Games in 1964, and has also competed in the African Games.[97] Scouting is represented in Madagascar by its own local federation of three scouting clubs. Membership in 2011 was estimated at 14,905.[257]\n\n\nBecause of its advanced sports facilities, Antananarivo gained the hosting rights for several of Africa's top international basketball events, including the 2011 FIBA Africa Championship,[258] the 2009 FIBA Africa Championship for Women,[259] the 2014 FIBA Africa Under-18 Championship,[260] the 2013 FIBA Africa Under-16 Championship,[261] and the 2015 FIBA Africa Under-16 Championship for Women.[262] Madagascar's national 3x3 basketball team won the gold medal at the 2019 African Games.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Malagasy cuisine\n\nMalagasy cuisine reflects the diverse influences of Southeast Asian, African, Oceania, Indian, Chinese, and European culinary traditions. The complexity of Malagasy meals can range from the simple, traditional preparations introduced by the earliest settlers, to the refined festival dishes prepared for the island's 19th-century monarchs. Throughout almost the entire island, the contemporary cuisine of Madagascar typically consists of a base of rice (*vary*) served with an accompaniment (*laoka*). The many varieties of *laoka* may be vegetarian or include animal proteins, and typically feature a sauce flavored with such ingredients as ginger, onion, garlic, tomato, vanilla, coconut milk, salt, curry powder, green peppercorns or, less commonly, other spices or herbs. In parts of the arid south and west, pastoral families may replace rice with maize, cassava, or curds made from fermented zebu milk. A wide variety of sweet and savory fritters as well as other street foods are available across the island, as are diverse tropical and temperate-climate fruits. Locally produced beverages include fruit juices, coffee, herbal teas and teas, and alcoholic drinks such as rum, wine, and beer.[241] Three Horses Beer is the most popular beer on the island[263] and is considered emblematic of Madagascar.[264]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Madagascar portal\n\n\n* Index of Madagascar-related articles\n* Outline of Madagascar\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^**  (/ˌmædəˈɡæskər, -kɑːr/; Malagasy: *Madagasikara*, pronounced [ma.da.ɡa.si.kʲa.ra]) (Malagasy: *Repoblikan'i Madagasikara*, Malagasy pronunciation: [repuˈblikʲanʲ madaɡasʲˈkʲarə̥]; French: *République de Madagascar*)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Le Comité Consultatif Constitutionnel (1 October 2010). \"*Projet de Constitution de la Quatrième République de Madagascar*\" (PDF) (in French).

As Greenland is one of the Overseas Countries and Territories of the European Union, citizens of Greenland are also granted European Union citizenship.[14] The capital and largest city of Greenland is Nuuk.[14] Greenland lies between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. It is the world's largest island,[d] as well as the northernmost area of the world – Kaffeklubben Island off the northern coast is the world's northernmost undisputed point of land, and Cape Morris Jesup on the mainland was thought to be so until the 1960s.\n\n\nThough a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers) for more than a millennium, beginning in 986.[16] Greenland has been inhabited at intervals over at least the last 4,500 years by Arctic peoples whose forebears migrated there from what is now Canada.[17][18] Norsemen settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century, having previously settled Iceland. Inuit arrived in the 13th century. Though under continuous influence of Norway and Norwegians, Greenland was not formally under the Norwegian crown until 1261. The Norse colonies disappeared in the late 15th century, after Norway was hit by the Black Death and entered a severe decline.\n\n\nIn the early 17th century, Dano-Norwegian explorers reached Greenland again. When Denmark and Norway separated Greenland became Danish in 1814 and was fully integrated in the Danish state in 1953 under the Constitution of Denmark, which made the people in Greenland citizens of Denmark. In 1979, Denmark granted home rule to Greenland; in 2008, Greenlanders voted for the Self-Government Act, which transferred more power from the Danish government to the local Greenlandic government.[19] Under the new structure, Greenland has gradually assumed responsibility for a number of governmental services and areas of competence. The Danish government retains control of citizenship, monetary policy, and foreign affairs, including defence. Most residents of Greenland are Inuit.[20] The population is concentrated mainly on the southwest coast, and the rest of the island is sparsely populated. Three-quarters of Greenland is covered by the only permanent ice sheet outside Antarctica. With a population of 56,583 (2022),[21] Greenland is the least densely populated region in the world.[22] 67% of its electricity production comes from renewable energy, mostly from hydropower.[23]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Greenland visible from space. Arctic sea ice is not shown.\nThe early Norse settlers named the island *Greenland*. In the Icelandic sagas, the Norwegian-born Icelander Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter. With his extended family and his thralls (slaves or serfs), he set out in ships to explore an icy land known to lie to the northwest. After finding a habitable area and settling there, he named it *Grœnland* (translated as \"Greenland\"), supposedly in the hope that the pleasant name would attract settlers.[24][25][26] The *Saga of Erik the Red* states: \"In the summer, Erik left to settle in the country he had found, which he called Greenland, as he said people would be attracted there if it had a favorable name.\"[27]\n\n\nThe name of the country in the Greenlandic language is *Kalaallit Nunaat* 'land of the Kalaallit'.[28] The Kalaallit are the Greenlandic Inuit who inhabit the country's western region.\n\n\nIn World War II, the United States military used *Bluie* as a code name for Greenland, where they kept several bases named \"Bluie (East or West) (sequential numeral)\".[29]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Greenland\n\nSee also: Timeline of Greenland\n\n### Early Paleo-Inuit cultures[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Areas of Independence I and Independence II cultures around Independence Fjord\nIn prehistoric times, Greenland was home to several successive Paleo-Inuit cultures known today primarily through archaeological finds. The earliest entry of the Paleo-Inuit into Greenland is thought to have occurred about 2500 BC. From about 2500 BC to 800 BC, southern and western Greenland was inhabited by the Saqqaq culture. Most finds of remains from that period have been around Disko Bay, including the site of Saqqaq, for which the culture is named.[30][31]\n\n\nFrom 2400 BC to 1300 BC, the Independence I culture existed in northern Greenland. It was a part of the Arctic small-tool tradition.[32][33][34] Towns, including Deltaterrasserne, appeared. About 800 BC, the Saqqaq culture disappeared and the Early Dorset culture emerged in western Greenland and the Independence II culture in northern Greenland.[35] The Dorset culture was the first culture to extend throughout the Greenlandic coastal areas, in the west and the east. It lasted until the total onset of the Thule culture, in AD 1500. The people of the Dorset culture lived mainly by hunting whales and reindeer.[36][37][38][39]\n\n\n\n### Norse settlement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Kingittorsuaq Runestone from Kingittorsuaq Island (Middle Ages)\nFrom 986, the west coast was settled by Icelanders and Norwegians, through a contingent of 14 boats led by Erik the Red. They formed three settlements—the Eastern Settlement, the Western Settlement, and the Middle Settlement—on fjords near the southwestern tip of the island.[16][40] They shared the island with the late Dorset culture inhabitants, who occupied the northern and western parts, and later with those of the Thule culture, who entered from the north. Norse Greenlanders submitted to Norwegian rule in 1261 under the Kingdom of Norway. The Kingdom of Norway entered a personal union with Denmark in 1380, and from 1397 was a part of the Kalmar Union.[41]\n\n\nThe Norse settlements, such as Brattahlíð, thrived for centuries, before disappearing in the 15th century, perhaps at the onset of the Little Ice Age.[42] Except some runic inscriptions, the only contemporary records or historiography that survives from the Norse settlements is of their contact with Iceland or Norway. Medieval Norwegian sagas and historical works mention Greenland's economy, the bishops of Gardar, and the collection of tithes. A chapter in the *Konungs skuggsjá* (*The King's Mirror*) describes Norse Greenland's exports, imports, and grain cultivation.\n\n\n\n![](image)One of the last contemporary written mentions of the Norse Greenlanders records a marriage that took place in 1408 in the church of Hvalsey, now the best-preserved Nordic ruins in Greenland. The married couple then travelled to Iceland, which is why the account has been preserved.\nIcelandic saga accounts of life in Greenland were composed in the 13th century and later, and are not primary sources for the history of early Norse Greenland.[26] Those accounts are closer to primary for more contemporaneous accounts of late Norse Greenland. Modern understanding therefore mostly depends on the physical data from archeological sites. Interpretation of ice-core and clam-shell data suggests that between AD 800 and 1300 the regions around the fjords of southern Greenland had a relatively mild climate, several degrees Celsius warmer than usual in the North Atlantic[43] with trees and herbaceous plants growing and livestock being farmed. Barley was grown as a crop up to the 70th parallel.[44] The ice cores show that Greenland has had dramatic temperature shifts many times in the past 100,000 years.[45] Similarly the Icelandic Book of Settlements records famines during the winters, in which \"the old and helpless were killed and thrown over cliffs\".[43]\n\n\nThese Icelandic settlements vanished during the 14th and early 15th centuries.[46] The demise of the Western Settlement coincides with a decrease in summer and winter temperatures. A study of North Atlantic seasonal temperature variability during the Little Ice Age showed a significant decrease in maximum summer temperatures beginning about the turn of the 14th century—as much as 6 to 8 °C (11 to 14 °F) lower than modern summer temperatures.[47] The study also found that the lowest winter temperatures of the last 2,000 years occurred in the late 14th century and early 15th century. The Eastern Settlement was probably abandoned in the early to mid-15th century, during this cold period.\n\n\n\n![](image)Extent of the Dano-Norwegian possessions (1536–1814)\n![](image)Estimated extent of Arctic cultures in Greenland from 900 AD to 1500 AD. Colored areas on each map indicate the extent and migration patterns over time of the Dorset, Thule, and Norse cultures.\nTheories drawn from archeological excavations at Herjolfsnes in the 1920s suggest that the condition of human bones from this period indicates that the Norse population was malnourished, possibly because of soil erosion resulting from the Norsemen's destruction of natural vegetation in the course of farming, turf-cutting, and wood-cutting. Malnutrition may also have resulted from widespread deaths from pandemic plague;[48] the decline in temperatures during the Little Ice Age; and armed conflicts with the *Skrælings* (Norse word for Inuit, meaning \"wretches\"[42]). Recent archeological studies somewhat challenge the general assumption that the Norse colonization had a dramatic negative environmental effect on the vegetation. Data support traces of a possible Norse soil amendment strategy.[49] More recent evidence suggests that the Norse, who never numbered more than about 2,500, gradually abandoned the Greenland settlements over the 15th century as walrus ivory,[50] the most valuable export from Greenland, decreased in price because of competition with other sources of higher-quality ivory, and that there was actually little evidence of starvation or difficulties.[51]\n\n\nOther explanations of the disappearance of the Norse settlements have been proposed:\n\n\n\n1. Lack of support from the homeland.[48]\n2. Ship-borne marauders (such as Basque, English, or German pirates) rather than *Skrælings*, could have plundered and displaced the Greenlanders.[52]\n3. They were \"the victims of hidebound thinking and of a hierarchical society dominated by the Church and the biggest land owners. In their reluctance to see themselves as anything but Europeans, the Greenlanders failed to adopt the kind of apparel that the Inuit employed as protection against the cold and damp or to borrow any of the Inuit hunting gear.\"[16][42]\n4. That portion of the Greenlander population willing to adopt Inuit ways and means intermarried with and assimilated into the Inuit community.[53] Much of the Greenland population today is mixed Inuit and European ancestry. It was impossible in 1938 when Stefansson wrote his book to distinguish between intermarriage before the European loss of contact and after the contact was restored.\n5. \"Norse society's structure created a conflict between the short-term interests of those in power, and the long-term interests of the society as a whole.\"[42]\n\n\n### Thule culture (1300–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pictures of Greenland, c. 1863\nThe Thule people are the ancestors of the current Greenlandic population. No genes from the Paleo-Inuit have been found in the present population of Greenland.[54] The Thule culture migrated eastward from what is now known as Alaska around 1000 AD, reaching Greenland around 1300. The Thule culture was the first to introduce to Greenland such technological innovations as dog sleds and toggling harpoons.\n\n\nThere is an account of contact and conflict with the Norse population, as told by the Inuit. It is republished in *The Norse Atlantic Sagas*, by Gwyn Jones. Jones reports that there is also an account of perhaps the same incident, of more doubtful provenance, told by the Norse side.\n\n\n\n### 1500–1814[edit]\n\n\nIn 1500 King Manuel I of Portugal sent Gaspar Corte-Real to Greenland in search of a Northwest Passage to Asia which, according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, was part of Portugal's sphere of influence. In 1501 Corte-Real returned with his brother, Miguel Corte-Real. Finding the sea frozen, they headed south and arrived in Labrador and Newfoundland. Upon the brothers' return to Portugal, the cartographic information supplied by Corte-Real was incorporated into a new map of the world which was presented to Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, by Alberto Cantino in 1502. The *Cantino* planisphere, made in Lisbon, accurately depicts the southern coastline of Greenland.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)An English map of 1747, based on Hans Egede's descriptions and misconceptions, by Emanuel Bowen\nIn 1605–1607 King Christian IV of Denmark and Norway sent a series of expeditions to Greenland and Arctic waterways to locate the lost eastern Norse settlement and assert Danish-Norwegian sovereignty over Greenland. The expeditions were mostly unsuccessful, partly due to leaders who lacked experience with the difficult Arctic ice and weather conditions, and partly because the expedition leaders were given instructions to search for the Eastern Settlement on the east coast of Greenland just north of Cape Farewell, which is almost inaccessible due to southward drifting ice. The pilot on all three trips was English explorer James Hall.\n\n\n\n![](image)Godthåb in Greenland, c. 1878\nAfter the Norse settlements died off, Greenland came under the de facto control of various Inuit groups, but the Dano-Norwegian government never forgot or relinquished the claims to Greenland that it had inherited from the Norse. When it re-established contact with Greenland in the early 17th century, Denmark-Norway asserted its sovereignty over the island. In 1721 a joint mercantile and clerical expedition led by Dano-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede was sent to Greenland, not knowing whether a Norse civilization remained there. This expedition is part of the Dano-Norwegian colonization of the Americas. After 15 years in Greenland, Hans Egede left his son Paul Egede in charge of the mission there and returned to Denmark, where he established a Greenland Seminary. This new colony was centred at Godthåb (\"Good Hope\") on the southwest coast. Gradually, Greenland was opened up to Danish merchants, but closed to those from other countries.\n\n\n\n### Treaty of Kiel to World War II (1814–1945)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Greenland in World War II\n\n![](image)1869 photograph of Greenlandic Inuit.\nWhen the union between the crowns of Denmark and Norway was dissolved in 1814, the Treaty of Kiel severed Norway's former colonies and left them under the control of the Danish monarch. Norway occupied then-uninhabited eastern Greenland as Erik the Red's Land in July 1931, claiming that it constituted *terra nullius*. Norway and Denmark agreed to submit the matter in 1933 to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which decided against Norway.[56]\n\n\nGreenland's connection to Denmark was severed on 9 April 1940, early in World War II, after Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany. On 8 April 1941, the United States occupied Greenland to defend it against a possible invasion by Germany.[57] The United States occupation of Greenland continued until 1945. Greenland was able to buy goods from the United States and Canada by selling cryolite from the mine at Ivittuut. The major air bases were Bluie West-1 at Narsarsuaq and Bluie West-8 at Søndre Strømfjord (Kangerlussuaq), both of which are still used as Greenland's major international airports.\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of Eirik Raudes Land\nDuring this war, the system of government changed: Governor Eske Brun ruled the island under a law of 1925 that allowed governors to take control under extreme circumstances; Governor Aksel Svane was transferred to the United States to lead the commission to supply Greenland. The Danish Sirius Patrol guarded the northeastern shores of Greenland in 1942 using dog sleds. They detected several German weather stations and alerted American troops, who destroyed the facilities. After the collapse of the Third Reich, Albert Speer briefly considered escaping in a small aeroplane to hide out in Greenland, but changed his mind and decided to surrender to the United States Armed Forces.[58]\n\n\nGreenland had been a protected and very isolated society until 1940. The Danish government had maintained a strict monopoly of Greenlandic trade, allowing no more than small scale barter trading with British whalers. In wartime Greenland developed a sense of self-reliance through self-government and independent communication with the outside world. Despite this change, in 1946 a commission including the highest Greenlandic council, the *Landsrådene*, recommended patience and no radical reform of the system. Two years later, the first step towards a change of government was initiated when a grand commission was established. A final report (G-50) was presented in 1950, which recommended the introduction of a modern welfare state with Denmark's development as sponsor and model. In 1953, Greenland was made an equal part of the Danish Kingdom. Home rule was granted in 1979.\n\n\n\n### Home rule and self-rule[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Greenlandic independence\n\n![](image)The orthography and vocabulary of the Greenlandic language is governed by *Oqaasileriffik* [kl], the Greenlandic language secretariat, located in the *Ilimmarfik* University of Greenland, Nuuk.\nIn 1867, United States Secretary of State William H. Seward worked with former senator Robert J. Walker to explore the possibility of buying Greenland and, perhaps, Iceland. Opposition in Congress ended this project.[59] Following World War II, the United States developed a geopolitical interest in Greenland, and in 1946 the United States offered to buy the island from Denmark for $100,000,000. Denmark refused to sell it.[60][61] In the 21st century, the United States remains interested in investing in the resource base of Greenland and in tapping hydrocarbons off the Greenlandic coast.[62][63] In August 2019, the US again proposed to buy the country, prompting premier Kim Kielsen to issue the statement, \"Greenland is not for sale and cannot be sold, but Greenland is open for trade and cooperation with other countries—including the United States.\"[64]\n\n\n\n![](image)The United States has operated Thule Air Base, now Pituffik Space Base, since the 1950s.\nIn 1950, Denmark agreed to allow the US to regain the use of Thule Air Base; it was greatly expanded between 1951 and 1953 as part of a unified NATO Cold War defence strategy. The local population of three nearby villages was moved more than 100 km (62 miles) away in the winter. The United States tried to construct a subterranean network of secret nuclear missile launch sites in the Greenlandic ice cap, named Project Iceworm. According to documents declassified in 1996,[65] this project was managed from Camp Century from 1960 to 1966 before abandonment as unworkable.[66] The missiles were never fielded, and necessary consent from the Danish Government to do so was never sought. The Danish government did not become aware of the programme's mission until 1997, when they discovered it while looking, in the declassified documents, for records related to the crash of a nuclear equipped B-52 bomber at Thule in 1968.[67]\n\n\nWith the 1953 Danish constitution, Greenland's colonial status ended as the island was incorporated into the Danish realm as an amt (county). Danish citizenship was extended to Greenlanders. Danish policies toward Greenland consisted of a strategy of cultural assimilation — or de-Greenlandification. During this period, the Danish government promoted the exclusive use of the Danish language in official matters, and required Greenlanders to go to Denmark for their post-secondary education. Many Greenlandic children grew up in boarding schools in southern Denmark, and a number lost their cultural ties to Greenland. While the policies \"succeeded\" in the sense of shifting Greenlanders from being primarily subsistence hunters into being urbanized wage earners, the Greenlandic elite began to reassert a Greenlandic cultural identity. A movement developed in favour of independence, reaching its peak in the 1970s.[68] As a consequence of political complications in relation to Denmark's entry into the European Common Market in 1972, Denmark began to seek a different status for Greenland, resulting in the Home Rule Act of 1979.\n\n\n\n![](image)Sermiligaaq. Greenland has more than 60 settlements.\nThis gave Greenland limited autonomy with its own legislature taking control of some internal policies, while the Parliament of Denmark maintained full control of external policies, security, and natural resources. The law came into effect on 1 May 1979. The Queen of Denmark, Margrethe II, remains Greenland's head of state. In 1985, Greenland left the European Economic Community (EEC) upon achieving self-rule, as it did not agree with the EEC's commercial fishing regulations and an EEC ban on seal skin products.[69] Greenland voters approved a referendum on greater autonomy on 25 November 2008.[70][71] According to one study, the 2008 vote created what \"can be seen as a system between home rule and full independence\".[72]\n\n\nOn 21 June 2009, Greenland gained self-rule with provisions for assuming responsibility for self-government of judicial affairs, policing, and natural resources. Also, Greenlanders were recognized as a separate people under international law.[73] Denmark maintains control of foreign affairs and defence matters. Denmark upholds the annual block grant of 3.2 billion Danish kroner, but as Greenland begins to collect revenues of its natural resources, the grant will gradually be diminished. This is generally considered to be a step toward eventual full independence from Denmark.[74] Greenlandic was declared the sole official language of Greenland at the historic ceremony.[2][4][75][76][77]\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Greenland\n\nTourism increased significantly between 2015 and 2019, with the number of visitors increasing from 77,000 per year to 105,000.[78] One source estimated that in 2019 the revenue from this aspect of the economy was about 450 million kroner (US$67 million). Like many aspects of the economy, this slowed dramatically in 2020, and into 2021, due to restrictions required as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;[79] one source describes it as being the \"biggest economic victim of the coronavirus\" (the overall economy did not suffer too severely as of mid-2020, thanks to the fisheries \"and a hefty subsidy from Copenhagen\").[80] Greenland's goal for returning tourism is to develop it \"right\" and to \"build a more sustainable tourism for the long run\".[81]\n\n\n\n## Geography and climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Greenland\n\nSee also: Climate of the Arctic § Greenland, Administrative divisions of Greenland, and Territorial claims in the Arctic\n\n![](image)Map of Greenland\nGreenland is the world's largest non-continental island[82] and the third largest area in North America after Canada and the United States.[83] It is between latitudes 59° and 83°N, and longitudes 11° and 74°W. Greenland is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Greenland Sea to the east, the North Atlantic Ocean to the southeast, the Davis Strait to the southwest, Baffin Bay to the west, the Nares Strait and Lincoln Sea to the northwest. The nearest countries to Greenland are Canada, with which it shares a maritime border, to the west and southwest across Nares Strait and Baffin Bay, as well as a shared land border on Hans Island;[84] and Iceland, southeast of Greenland in the Atlantic Ocean. Greenland also contains the world's largest national park, and it is the largest dependent territory by area in the world, as well as the fourth largest country subdivision in the world, after Sakha Republic in Russia, Australia's state of Western Australia, and Russia's Krasnoyarsk Krai, and the largest in North America.\n\n\nThe lowest temperature ever recorded in the Northern Hemisphere was recorded in Greenland, near the topographic summit of the Greenland Ice Sheet, on 22 December 1991, when the temperature reached −69.6 °C (−93.3 °F).[85] In Nuuk, the average daily temperature varies over the seasons from −5.1 to 9.9 °C (22.8 to 49.8 °F).[86] The total area of Greenland is 2,166,086 km2 (836,330 sq mi) (including other offshore minor islands), of which the Greenland ice sheet covers 1,755,637 km2 (677,855 sq mi) (81%) and has a volume of approximately 2,850,000 km3 (680,000 cu mi).[87] The highest point on Greenland is Gunnbjørn Fjeld at 3,700 m (12,100 ft) of the Watkins Range (East Greenland mountain range). The majority of Greenland, however, is less than 1,500 m (4,900 ft) in elevation.\n\n\n\n![Topographic map of Greenland](image)Greenland bedrock, at current elevation above sea level\nThe weight of the ice sheet has depressed the central land area to form a basin lying more than 300 m (980 ft) below sea level,[88][89] while elevations rise suddenly and steeply near the coast.[90]\n\n\nThe ice flows generally to the coast from the centre of the island. A survey led by French scientist Paul-Emile Victor in 1951 concluded that, under the ice sheet, Greenland is composed of three large islands.[91] This is disputed, but if it is so, they would be separated by narrow straits, reaching the sea at Ilulissat Icefjord, at Greenland's Grand Canyon and south of Nordostrundingen.\n\n\nAll towns and settlements of Greenland are situated along the ice-free coast, with the population being concentrated along the west coast. The northeastern part of Greenland is not part of any municipality, but it is the site of the world's largest national park, Northeast Greenland National Park.[92]\n\n\nAt least four scientific expedition stations and camps had been established on the ice sheet in the ice-covered central part of Greenland (indicated as pale blue in the adjacent map): Eismitte, North Ice, North GRIP Camp and The Raven Skiway. There is a year-round station Summit Camp on the ice sheet, established in 1989. The radio station Jørgen Brønlund Fjord was, until 1950, the northernmost permanent outpost in the world.\n\n\nThe extreme north of Greenland, Peary Land, is not covered by an ice sheet, because the air there is too dry to produce snow, which is essential in the production and maintenance of an ice sheet. If the Greenland ice sheet were to melt away completely, the world's sea level would rise by more than 7 m (23 ft).[93]\n\n\nIn 2003, a small island, 35 m × 15 m (115 ft × 49 ft) in length and width, was discovered by arctic explorer Dennis Schmitt and his team at the coordinates of 83-42. Whether this island is permanent is not yet confirmed. If it is, it is the northernmost permanent known land on Earth.\n\n\nIn 2007, the existence of a new island was announced. Named \"Uunartoq Qeqertaq\" (English: *Warming Island*), this island has always been present off the coast of Greenland, but was covered by a glacier. This glacier was discovered in 2002 to be shrinking rapidly, and by 2007 had completely melted away, leaving the exposed island.[94] The island was named Place of the Year by the Oxford Atlas of the World in 2007.[95] Ben Keene, the atlas's editor, commented: \n\n\n\n\n> \"In the last two or three decades, global warming has reduced the size of glaciers throughout the Arctic and earlier this year, news sources confirmed what climate scientists already knew: water, not rock, lay beneath this ice bridge on the east coast of Greenland. More islets are likely to appear as the sheet of frozen water covering the world's largest island continues to melt.\"[96]\n> \n> \n\n Some controversy surrounds the history of the island, specifically over whether the island might have been revealed during a brief warm period in Greenland during the mid-20th century.[97]\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Climate change in the Arctic, Retreat of glaciers since 1850 § Greenland, and Greenland's Grand Canyon\n\nBetween 1989 and 1993, U.S. and European climate researchers drilled into the summit of Greenland's ice sheet, obtaining a pair of 3 km (1.9 mi) long ice cores. Analysis of the layering and chemical composition of the cores has provided a revolutionary new record of climate change in the Northern Hemisphere going back about 100,000 years and illustrated that the world's weather and temperature have often shifted rapidly from one seemingly stable state to another, with worldwide consequences.[98] The glaciers of Greenland are also contributing to a rise in the global sea level faster than was previously believed.[99] Between 1991 and 2004, monitoring of the weather at one location (Swiss Camp) showed that the average winter temperature had risen almost 6 °C (11 °F).[100] Other research has shown that higher snowfalls from the North Atlantic oscillation caused the interior of the ice cap to thicken by an average of 6 cm (2.4 in) each year between 1994 and 2005.[101]\n\n\nIn July 2021, Greenland banned all new oil and gas exploration in its territory, with government officials stating that the environmental \"price of oil extraction is too high\".[102]\n\n\nIn August 2021, rain fell on the summit of Greenland's ice cap for the first time in recorded history, which scientists attributed to the effects of climate change.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe island was part of the very ancient Precambrian continent of Laurentia, the eastern core of which forms the Greenland Shield, while the less exposed coastal strips become a plateau. On these ice-free coastal strips are sediments formed in the Precambrian, overprinted by metamorphism and now formed by glaciers, which continue into the Cenozoic and Mesozoic in parts of the island.\n\n\nIn the east and west of Greenland there are remnants of flood basalts and igneous intrusions, such as the Skaergaard intrusion. Notable rock provinces (metamorphic igneous rocks, ultramafics, and anorthosites) are found on the southwest coast at Qeqertarsuatsiaat. East of Nuuk, the banded iron ore region of Isukasia, over three billion years old, contains the world's oldest rocks, such as greenlandite (a rock composed predominantly of hornblende and hyperthene), formed 3.8 billion years ago,[105] and nuummite. In southern Greenland, the Illimaussaq alkaline complex consists of pegmatites such as nepheline, syenites (especially kakortokite or naujaite) and sodalite (sodalite-foya). In Ivittuut, where cryolite was formerly mined, there are fluoride-bearing pegmatites. To the north of Igaliku, there are the Gardar alkaline pegmatitic intrusions of augite syenite, gabbro, etc.\n\n\nTo the west and southwest are Palaeozoic carbonatite complexes at Kangerlussuaq (Gardiner complex) and Safartoq, and basic and ultrabasic igneous rocks at Uiffaq on Disko Island, where there are masses of heavy native iron up to 25 t (28 short tons) in the basalts.[106]\n\n\nThe paleontology of East Greenland is specially rich, with some of the early tetrapods[107] such as the Devonian Acanthostega and Ichthyostega, and unique triassic animals such as the phytosaur Mystriosuchus alleroq[108] and the dinosaurs Issi saaneq[109] and tracks.[110]\n\n\n\n## Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Flora and fauna of Greenland, Reindeer hunting in Greenland, Fishing industry in Greenland, and Whaling § Greenland\n\n![](image)Muskoxen in Greenland\nGreenland is home to two ecoregions: Kalaallit Nunaat high arctic tundra and Kalaallit Nunaat low arctic tundra.[111] There are approximately 700 known species of insects in Greenland, which is low compared with other countries (over one million species have been described worldwide). The sea is rich in fish and invertebrates, especially in the milder West Greenland Current; a large part of the Greenland fauna is associated with marine-based food chains, including large colonies of seabirds. The few native land mammals in Greenland include the polar bear, reindeer (introduced by Europeans), arctic fox, arctic hare, musk ox, collared lemming, ermine, and arctic wolf. The last four are found naturally only in East Greenland, having immigrated from Ellesmere Island. There are dozens of species of seals and whales along the coast. Land fauna consists predominantly of animals which have spread from North America or, in the case of many birds and insects, from Europe. There are no native or free-living reptiles or amphibians on the island.[112]\n\n\nPhytogeographically, Greenland belongs to the Arctic province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. The island is sparsely populated in vegetation; plant life consists mainly of grassland and small shrubs, which are regularly grazed by livestock. The most common tree native to Greenland is the European white birch (*Betula pubescens*) along with gray-leaf willow (*Salix glauca*), rowan (*Sorbus aucuparia*), common juniper (*Juniperus communis*) and other smaller trees, mainly willows.\n\n\nGreenland's flora consists of about 500 species of \"higher\" plants, i.e. flowering plants, ferns, horsetails and lycopodiophyta. Of the other groups, the lichens are the most diverse, with about 950 species; there are 600–700 species of fungi; mosses and bryophytes are also found. Most of Greenland's higher plants have circumpolar or circumboreal distributions; only a dozen species of saxifrage and hawkweed are endemic. A few plant species were introduced by the Norsemen, such as cow vetch.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Greenland Dog was brought from Siberia 1,000 years ago.\nThe terrestrial vertebrates of Greenland include the Greenland dog, which was introduced by the Inuit, as well as European-introduced species such as Greenlandic sheep, goats, cattle, reindeer, horse, chicken and sheepdog, all descendants of animals imported by Europeans.[*citation needed*] Marine mammals include the hooded seal (*Cystophora cristata*) as well as the grey seal (*Halichoerus grypus*).[113] Whales frequently pass very close to Greenland's shores in the late summer and early autumn. Whale species include the beluga whale, blue whale, Greenland whale, fin whale, humpback whale, minke whale, narwhal, pilot whale, sperm whale.[114]\n\n\n\n![](image)Humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, in Disko Bay near Ilulissat\nAs of 2009, 269 species of fish from over 80 different families are known from the waters surrounding Greenland. Almost all are marine species with only a few in freshwater, notably Atlantic salmon and charr.[115] The fishing industry is the primary industry of Greenland's economy, accounting for the majority of the country's total exports.[116]\n\n\nBirds, particularly seabirds, are an important part of Greenland's animal life; they consist of both Palearctic and Nearctic species, breeding populations of auks, puffins, skuas, and kittiwakes are found on steep mountainsides.[117][118][119][120] Greenland's ducks and geese include common eider, long-tailed duck, king eider, white-fronted goose, pink-footed goose and barnacle goose. Breeding migratory birds include the snow bunting, lapland bunting, ringed plover, red-throated loon and red-necked phalarope. Non-migratory land birds include the arctic redpoll, ptarmigan, short-eared owl, snowy owl, gyrfalcon and white-tailed eagle.[112]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Greenland\n\nSee also: 2021 Greenlandic general election, Greenland and the European Union, and Politics of Denmark\n\n![](image)\nMargrethe II, Queen of Denmark\n![](image)\nPrime Minister Mette Frederiksen\n![](image)\nPremier  \n Múte Bourup Egede\n\n![](image)The special territories of the European Union (pre 31 January 2020)\n![](image)Nuuk is Greenland's capital and the seat of the government.\nThe Greenlandic government holds executive power in local government affairs. The head of the government is called *Naalakkersuisut Siulittaasuat* (\"Premier\") and serves as head of Greenlandic Government. Any other member of the cabinet is called a *Naalakkersuisoq* (\"Minister\"). The Greenlandic parliament is called *Inatsisartut* (\"Legislators\"). The parliament currently has 31 members.[121]\n\n\nIn contemporary times, elections are held at municipal, national (*Inatsisartut*), and kingdom (*Folketing*) levels.\n\n\nGreenland is a self-governing entity within the constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Denmark, in which Queen Margrethe II is the head of state. The monarch officially retains executive power and presides over the Council of State (privy council).[122][123] However, following the introduction of a parliamentary system of government, the duties of the monarch have since become strictly representative and ceremonial,[124] such as the formal appointment and dismissal of the prime minister and other ministers in the executive government. The monarch is not answerable for his or her actions, and the monarch's person is sacrosanct.[125]\n\n\n\n### Political system[edit]\n\n\nThe party system was dominated by the social-democratic Forward Party, and the democratic socialist Inuit Community Party, both of which broadly argue for greater independence from Denmark. While the 2009 election saw the unionist Democrat Party (two MPs) decline greatly, the 2013 election consolidated the power of the two main parties at the expense of the smaller groups, and saw the eco-socialist Inuit Party elected to the Parliament for the first time. The dominance of the Forward and Inuit Community parties began to wane after the snap 2014 and 2018 elections.\n\n\nThe non-binding 2008 referendum on self-governance favouring increased self-governance and autonomy was passed winning 76.22% of the vote.\n\n\nIn 1985, Greenland left the European Economic Community (EEC), unlike Denmark, which remains a member. The EEC later became the European Union (EU, renamed and expanded in scope in 1992). Greenland retains some ties through its associated relationship with the EU. However, EU law largely does not apply to Greenland except in the area of trade. Greenland is designated as a member of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) and is thus officially not a part of the European Union, though Greenland can and does receive support from the European Development Fund, Multiannual Financial Framework, European Investment Bank and EU Programmes.[126][127]\n\n\n\n### Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Greenland\n\n![](image)Municipalities of Greenland\nGreenland's head of state is Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. The Queen's government in Denmark appoints a high commissioner (*Rigsombudsmand*) to represent it on the island. The commissioner is Julie Præst Wilche.\n\n\nThe Greenland constituency elect two MP representatives to the Kingdom Parliament (*Folketinget*) in Denmark, out of a total of 179. The current representatives are Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam of the Siumut Party and Aaja Chemnitz Larsen of the Inuit Community Party.[128]\n\n\nGreenland has national Parliament that consists of 31 representatives. The government is the Naalakkersuisut whose members are appointed by the premier. The head of government is the premier, usually the leader of the majority party in Parliament. The premier is Múte Bourup Egede of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party.[129]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Military of Greenland\n\nSeveral American and Danish military bases are located in Greenland, including Pituffik Space Base (previously Thule Air Base), which is home to the United States Space Force's global network of sensors providing missile warning, space surveillance and space control to North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). Elements of the sensor systems are commanded and controlled variously by Space Delta's 2, 4, and 6.[130]\n\n\nIn 1995, a political scandal in Denmark occurred after a report revealed the government had given tacit permission for nuclear weapons to be located in Greenland, in contravention of Denmark's 1957 nuclear-free zone policy.[131][67] The United States built a secret nuclear powered base, called Camp Century, in the Greenland ice sheet.[132] On 21 January 1968, a B-52G, with four nuclear bombs aboard as part of Operation Chrome Dome, crashed on the ice of the North Star Bay while attempting an emergency landing at Thule Air Base.[133] The resulting fire caused extensive radioactive contamination.[134] One of the H-bombs remains lost.[135][136]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of Greenland\n\nFormerly consisting of three counties comprising a total of 18 municipalities, Greenland abolished these in 2009 and has since been divided into large territories known as \"municipalities\" (Greenlandic: *kommuneqarfiit*, Danish: *kommuner*): *Sermersooq* (\"Much Ice\") around the capital Nuuk and also including all East Coast communities; *Kujalleq* (\"South\") around Cape Farewell; *Qeqqata* (\"Centre\") north of the capital along the Davis Strait; *Qeqertalik* (\"The one with islands\") surrounding Disko Bay; and *Avannaata* (\"Northern\") in the northwest; the latter two having come into being as a result of the Qaasuitsup municipality, one of the original four, being partitioned in 2018. The northeast of the island composes the unincorporated Northeast Greenland National Park. Pituffik Space Base is also unincorporated, an enclave within Avannaata municipality administered by the United States Space Force. During its construction, there were as many as 12,000 American residents but in recent years the number has been below 1,000.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Greenland\n\nThe Greenlandic economy is highly dependent on fishing. Fishing accounts for more than 90% of Greenland's exports.[137] The shrimp and fish industry is by far the largest income earner.[138]\n\n\nGreenland is abundant in minerals.[137] Mining of ruby deposits began in 2007. Other mineral prospects are improving as prices are increasing. These include iron, uranium, aluminium, nickel, platinum, tungsten, titanium, and copper. Despite resumption[*when?*] of several hydrocarbon and mineral exploration activities, it will take several years before hydrocarbon production can materialize. The state oil company Nunaoil was created to help develop the hydrocarbon industry in Greenland. The state company Nunamineral has been launched on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange to raise more capital to increase the production of gold, started in 2007.\n\n\nElectricity has traditionally been generated by oil or diesel power plants, even if there is a large surplus of potential hydropower. There is a programme to build hydropower plants. The first, and still the largest, is Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant.\n\n\nThere are also plans to build a large aluminium smelter, using hydropower to create an exportable product. It is expected that much of the labour needed will be imported.[139]\n\n\nThe European Union has urged Greenland to restrict the People's Republic of China development of rare-earth mineral projects, as China accounts for 95% of the world's current supply. However, in early 2013 the government of Greenland said that it had no plans to impose such restrictions.[140]\n\n\nThe public sector, including publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays a dominant role in Greenland's economy. About half the government revenues come from grants from the Danish government, an important supplement to the gross domestic product (GDP). Gross domestic product per capita is equivalent to that of the average economies of Europe.\n\n\nGreenland suffered an economic contraction in the early 1990s. But, since 1993, the economy has improved. The Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a tight fiscal policy since the late 1980s, which has helped create surpluses in the public budget and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign-trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining lead and zinc mine that year. In 2017, new sources of ruby in Greenland have been discovered, promising to bring new industry and a new export from the country[141] (see Gemstone industry in Greenland).\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in Greenland and List of airports in Greenland\n\nThere is air transport both within Greenland and between the island and other nations. There is also scheduled boat traffic, but the long distances lead to long travel times and low frequency. There are virtually no roads between cities because the coast has many fjords that would require ferry service to connect a road network. The only exception is a gravel road of 4.8 km (3 mi) length between Kangilinnguit and the now abandoned former cryolite mining town of Ivittuut.[142] In addition, the lack of agriculture, forestry and similar countryside activities has meant that very few country roads have been built. Greenland has no passenger railways.\n\n\nKangerlussuaq Airport (SFJ)[143] is the largest airport and the main aviation hub for international passenger transport. It serves international and domestic airline operated flight.[144] SFJ is far from the vicinity of the larger metropolitan capital areas, 317 km (197 mi) to the capital Nuuk, and airline passenger services are available.[145]\n\n\nNuuk Airport (GOH)[146] is the second-largest airport, located just 6.0 km (3.7 mi) from the centre of the capital. GOH serves general aviation traffic and has daily or regular domestic flights within Greenland. GOH also serves international flights to Iceland, business, and private airplanes.\n\n\nIlulissat Airport (JAV)[147] is a domestic airport that also serves international flights to Iceland.\n\n\nThere are a total of 13 registered civil airports and 47 helipads in Greenland; most of them are unpaved and located in rural areas. The second-longest runway is at Narsarsuaq Airport, a domestic airport with limited international service in south Greenland. All civil aviation matters are handled by the Danish Transport Authority. Most airports, including Nuuk Airport, have short runways and can only be served by special fairly small aircraft on fairly short flights. Kangerlussuaq Airport, which is around 100 km (62 mi) inland from the west coast, is the major airport of Greenland and the hub for domestic flights. Intercontinental flights connect mainly to Copenhagen. Travel between international destinations (except Iceland) and any city in Greenland requires a plane change.\n\n\nIcelandair operates flights from Reykjavík to a number of airports in Greenland, and the company promotes the service as a day-trip option from Iceland for tourists.[148]\n\n\nThere are no direct flights to the United States or Canada, although there have been flights Kangerlussuaq – Baltimore,[149] and Nuuk – Iqaluit,[150] which were cancelled because of too few passengers and financial losses.[151] An alternative between Greenland and the United States/Canada is Icelandair with a plane change in Iceland.[152]\n\n\nSea passenger transport is served by several coastal ferries. Arctic Umiaq Line makes a single round trip per week, taking 80 hours each direction.[153]\n\n\nCargo freight by sea is handled by the shipping company Royal Arctic Line from, to and across Greenland. It provides trade and transport opportunities between Greenland, Europe and North America.\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nFor statistics on demographics, see Demographics of Greenland.\n\nSee also: List of Greenlanders, Greenlandic Inuit, and Danish people in Greenland\n\n![](image)Tunumiit Inuit couple from Kulusuk\nAs of 2021, Greenland has a population of 56,421.[154] That same year, 18,800 people resided in the capital city Nuuk. Nearly all Greenlanders live along the fjords in the south-west of the main island, which has a relatively mild climate.[155] Whereas the majority of the population lives north of 64°N in colder coastal climates, Greenland's warmest climates such as the vegetated area around Narsarsuaq are sparsely populated.\n\n\nThe majority of the population is Lutheran. The historically important Moravian Brothers (*Herrnhuters*) were a congregation of faith, in a Danish context based in Christiansfeld in South Jutland, and partially of German origin, but their name does not signify they were ethnic Moravians (Czechs).\n\n\nIn terms of country of birth, the population is estimated to be of 89.7% Greenlandic multiethnic European-Inuit origin, 7.8% Danish, 1.1% other Nordic and 1.4% other. The multi-ethnic population of European-Inuit represent people of Danish, Norwegian and to a lesser degree of Faroese, Icelandic, Dutch (whalers), German[6] and American descent.\n\n\nA 2015 wide genetic study of Greenlanders found modern-day Inuit in Greenland are direct descendants of the first Inuit pioneers of the Thule culture who arrived in the 13th century, with approximately 25% admixture of the European colonizers from the 16th century. Despite previous speculations, no evidence of Viking settlers predecessors has been found.[156]\n\n\nGreenland is the only country in the Americas where natives make up a majority of the population.\n\n\n\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in Greenland2020 estimate[157]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank\n | Name | Municipality | Municipal pop.\n | Rank\n | Name | Municipality | Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Nuuk](image)Nuuk![Sisimiut](image)Sisimiut | 1 | Nuuk | Sermersooq | 18,326 | 11 | Nanortalik | Kujalleq | 1,185\n | ![Ilulissat](image)Ilulissat![Aasiaat](image)Aasiaat |\n| 2 | Sisimiut | Qeqqata | 5,582 | 12 | Upernavik | Avannaata | 1,092\n |\n| 3 | Ilulissat | Avannaata | 4,670 | 13 | Qasigiannguit | Qeqertalik | 1,081\n |\n| 4 | Aasiaat | Qeqertalik | 3,069 | 14 | Qeqertarsuaq | Qeqertalik | 839\n |\n| 5 | Qaqortoq | Kujalleq | 3,050 | 15 | Qaanaaq | Avannaata | 646\n |\n| 6 | Maniitsoq | Qeqqata | 2,534 | 16 | Kangaatsiaq | Qeqertalik | 520\n |\n| 7 | Tasiilaq | Sermersooq | 2,063 | 17 | Kangerlussuaq | Qeqqata | 508\n |\n| 8 | Uummannaq | Avannaata | 1,407 | 18 | Kullorsuaq | Avannaata | 453\n |\n| 9 | Narsaq | Kujalleq | 1,346 | 19 | Ittoqqortoormiit | Sermersooq | 345\n |\n| 10 | Paamiut | Sermersooq | 1,308 | 20 | Kangaamiut | Qeqqata | 293\n |\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A bilingual sign in Nuuk, displaying the Danish and Kalaallisut for \"Parking forbidden for all vehicles\"\nGreenlandic (effectively West Greenlandic), spoken by nearly 50'000 people, became the official sole language in 2009.[158] The majority of the population speak both Danish and West Greenlandic Kalaallisut (the most populous Eskaleut language). They have been used in public affairs since the establishment of home rule in 1979. In practice, Danish is still widely used in administration, academics, and skilled trades and other professions. The orthography of Greenlandic, established in 1851,[159] was revised in 1973. The literacy rate is 100%.[138]\n\n\nA majority of the Greenland population speak West Greenlandic (Kalaallisut) bi- and some tri-lingually which is more than all other languages combined. About 12% of the population speak Danish as a first or sole language. These primarily are Danish immigrants, many of whom remain the first and only language for those in Nuuk and other larger towns. Debate about the roles of Greenlandic and Danish in the country's future is evolving. While Greenlandic was dominant in all smaller settlements, most of the multi ethnic Inuit ancestors spoke Danish as a second language. In larger towns, especially Nuuk, this Danish group was more important for social matters. English is another important language for Greenland now taught from the first school year.[160]\n\n\nWest Greenland has long been the most populous area of the island and home to its de facto status as the official Greenlandic language. Although around 3'000 people speak East Greenlandic (Tunumiisut) and nearly 1'000 around northern Qaanaaq speak Inuktun. North Greenlandic is closer to the Inuit languages of Canada than it is to other Greenlandic.[161] Each of these varieties is nearly unintelligible to the speakers of the others and some linguists consider Tunumiit to be a separate language all together.[162] A UNESCO report labelled the other varieties as endangered, and measures are now considered to protect the East Greenlandic dialect.[163]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nEducation is organized in a similar way to Denmark. There is ten year mandatory primary school. There is also a secondary school, with either work education or preparatory for university education. There is one university, the University of Greenland (Greenlandic: *Ilisimatusarfik*) in Nuuk. Many Greenlanders attend universities in Denmark or elsewhere.\n\n\nThe public school system in Greenland is, as in Denmark, under the jurisdiction of the municipalities: they are therefore municipal schools. The legislature specifies the standards allowed for the content in schools, but the municipal governments decide how the schools under their responsibility are run. Education is free and compulsory for children aged seven to 16. The financial effort devoted to education is now very important (11.3% of GDP). Section 1 of the Government Ordinance on Public Schools (as amended on 6 June 1997) requires Greenlandic as the language of instruction.\n\n\n\nEducation is governed by Regulation No. 10 of 25 October 1990 on primary and lower secondary education. This regulation was amended by Regulation No. 8 of 13 May 1993 and Regulation No. 1 of 1 March 1994. Under Regulation No. 10 of 25 October 1990, linguistic integration in primary and lower secondary schools became compulsory for all students. The aim is to place Greenlandic-speaking and Danish-speaking pupils in the same classes, whereas previously they were placed in separate classes according to their mother tongue. At the same time, the government guarantees that Danish speakers can learn Greenlandic. In this way, the Greenlandic government wants to give the same linguistic, cultural and social education to all students, both those of Greenlandic and Danish origin. A study, which was carried out during a three-year trial period, concluded that this policy had achieved positive results. This bilingualism policy has been in force since 1994.\n\n![](image)*Ilimmarfik* university Campus in NuukAbout 100 schools have been established. Greenlandic and Danish are taught there. Normally, Greenlandic is taught from kindergarten to the end of secondary school, but Danish is compulsory from the first cycle of primary school as a second language. As in Denmark with Danish, the school system provides for \"Greenlandic 1\" and \"Greenlandic 2\" courses. Language tests allow students to move from one level to the other. Based on the teachers' evaluation of their students, a third level of courses has been added: \"Greenlandic 3\". Secondary education in Greenland is generally vocational and technical. The system is governed by Regulation No. 16 of 28 October 1993 on Vocational and Technical Education, Scholarships and Career Guidance. Danish remains the main language of instruction. The capital, Nuuk, has a (bilingual) teacher training college and a (bilingual) university. At the end of their studies, all students must pass a test in the Greenlandic language.\n\n\nHigher education is offered in Greenland: \"university education\" (regulation no. 3 of 9 May 1989); training of journalists, training of primary and lower secondary school teachers, training of social workers, training of social educators (regulation no. 1 of 16 May 1989); and training of nurses and nursing assistants (regulation no. 9 of 13 May 1990). Greenlandic students can continue their education in Denmark, if they wish and have the financial means to do so. For admission to Danish educational institutions, Greenlandic applicants are placed on an equal footing with Danish applicants. Scholarships are granted to Greenlandic students who are admitted to Danish educational institutions. To be eligible for these scholarships, the applicant must be a Danish citizen and have had permanent residence in Greenland for at least five years. The total period of residence outside Greenland may not exceed three years.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Greenland\n\nReligion in Greenland (2010):[164][165]\n\n\n\nProtestantism (95.5%)\nRoman Catholicism (0.2%)\nOther Christian (0.4%)\nInuit spiritual beliefs (0.8%)\nAgnostic (2.3%)\nAtheist (0.2%)\nOther Religion (0.6%)\n\n![](image)Most Greenlandic villages, including Nanortalik, have their own church.\nThe nomadic Inuit were traditionally shamanistic, with a well-developed religion primarily concerned with appeasing a vengeful and fingerless sea goddess called Sedna who controlled the success of the seal and whale hunts.[166]\n\n\nThe first Norse colonists worshipped the Norse gods, but Erik the Red's son Leif was converted to Christianity by King Olaf Trygvesson on a trip to Norway in 999 and sent missionaries back to Greenland. These swiftly established sixteen parishes, some monasteries, and a bishopric at Garðar.\n\n\nRediscovering these colonists and spreading ideas of the Protestant Reformation among them was one of the primary reasons for the Danish recolonization in the 18th century. Under the patronage of the Royal Mission College in Copenhagen, Norwegian and Danish Lutherans and German Moravian missionaries searched for the missing Norse settlements, but no Norse were found, and instead they began preaching to the Inuit. The principal figures in the Christianization of Greenland were Hans and Poul Egede and Matthias Stach. The New Testament was translated piecemeal from the time of the very first settlement on Kangeq Island, but the first translation of the whole Bible was not completed until 1900. An improved translation using the modern orthography was completed in 2000.[167][*better source needed*]\n\n\nToday, the major religion is Protestant Christianity, represented mainly by the Church of Denmark, which is Lutheran in orientation. While there are no official census data on religion in Greenland, the Bishop of Greenland Sofie Petersen[168] estimates that 85% of the Greenlandic population are members of her congregation.[169] The Church of Denmark is the established church through the Constitution of Denmark.[170]\n\n\nThe Roman Catholic minority is pastorally served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen. There are still Christian missionaries on the island, but mainly from charismatic movements proselytizing fellow Christians.[171] According to Operation World, just 4.7% of Greenlanders are Evangelical Christian, although the Evangelical population is growing at an annual rate of 8.4%.[172]\n\n\n\n### Social issues[edit]\n\n\nThe rate of suicide in Greenland is very high. According to a 2010 census, Greenland holds the highest suicide rate in the world.[173][174] Another significant social issue faced by Greenland is a high rate of alcoholism.[175] Alcohol consumption rates in Greenland reached their height in the 1980s, when it was twice as high as in Denmark, and had by 2010 fallen slightly below the average level of consumption in Denmark (which at the time were 12th highest in the world, but has since fallen). However, at the same time, alcohol prices are far higher, meaning that consumption has a large social impact.[176][177] Prevalence of HIV/AIDS used to be high in Greenland and peaked in the 1990s when the fatality rate also was relatively high. Through a number of initiatives the prevalence (along with the fatality rate through efficient treatment) has fallen and is now low, c. 0.13%,[178][179] below most other countries. In recent decades, the unemployment rates have generally been somewhat above those in Denmark;[180] in 2017, the rate was 6.8% in Greenland,[181] compared to 5.6% in Denmark.[182]\n\n\n\n#### Fertility control[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spiral case\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, at a time when the population was increasing, 4,500 Greenland Inuit women and girls (roughly half of all fertile females) were fitted with Intrauterine Devices (IUDs) by Danish doctors. Sometimes girls (as young as 12) were taken directly from school to have these devices inserted, without parents' permission being sought. The procedure was also carried out on some Inuit girls at boarding schools in Denmark. On 30 September 2022, the Danish Health Minister, Magnus Heunicke, confirmed that a two-year investigation would try to find out what decisions led to the practice and how it was carried out.[183][184]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of Greenland and Music of Greenland\n\nSee also: Human rights in Denmark § Indigenous rights\n\n![](image)Nive Nielsen, Greenlandic singer and songwriter\n![](image)Panel discussion with Greenlandic movie maker Inuk Silis Høegh at the launch of his movie about groundbreaking Greenlandic band Sumé\nToday Greenlandic culture is a blending of traditional Inuit (Kalaallit, Tunumiit, Inughuit) and Scandinavian culture. Inuit, or Kalaallit, culture has a strong artistic tradition, dating back thousands of years. The Kalaallit are known for an art form of figures called *tupilak* or a \"spirit object\". Traditional art-making practices thrive in the *Ammassalik*.[185] Sperm whale ivory remains a valued medium for carving.[186]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nGreenland also has a successful, albeit small, music culture. Some popular Greenlandic bands and artists include Sumé (classic rock), Chilly Friday (rock), Nanook (rock), Siissisoq (rock), Nuuk Posse (hip hop) and Rasmus Lyberth (folk), who performed in the Danish national final for the 1979 Eurovision Song Contest, performing in Greenlandic. The singer-songwriter Simon Lynge is the first musical artist from Greenland to have an album released across the United Kingdom, and to perform at the UK's Glastonbury Festival. The music culture of Greenland also includes traditional Inuit music, largely revolving around singing and drums.\n\n\nThe drum is the traditional Greenlandic instrument. It was used to perform traditional drum dances. For this purpose, a round drum (qilaat) in the form of a frame made of driftwood or walrus ribs covered with a polar bear bladder, polar bear stomach or walrus stomach was used. The drumming was not done on the membrane, but with a stick from underneath the frame. Simple melodies were sung for this purpose.\n\n\nThe drum dance used to serve two functions: On the one hand, the drum was used to drive away fear on long, dark winter nights. To do this, the drum dancer would make faces and try to make others laugh until all fear was forgotten.\n\n\nDisputes were also settled with the drum. If someone had misbehaved, he was challenged with the drum. People would gather at certain powerful places and take turns beating the drum and singing to it. They tried to ridicule the other person as much as possible. The spectators expressed with their laughter who was the winner and who was therefore the guilty one.\n\n\nThe drum could also be used by shamans for ritual conjurations of spirits.\n\n\nAfter the arrival of missionaries in the 18th century, the drum dance (still popular among Canadian Inuit today) was banned as pagan and shamanistic and replaced by polyphonic singing of secular and church songs. This choral singing is known today for its special sound. Church hymns are partly of German origin due to the influence of the Herrnhuter Brüdergemeinde. Scandinavian, German and Scottish whalers brought the fiddle, accordion and polka (kalattuut) to Greenland, where they are now played in intricate dance steps.\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Greenland\n\nSport is an important part of Greenlandic culture, as the population is generally quite active.[187] Popular sports include association football, track and field, handball and skiing. Handball is often referred to as the national sport,[188] and the men's national team was ranked among the top 20 in the world in 2001.\n\n\nGreenland has excellent conditions for skiing, fishing, snowboarding, ice climbing and rock climbing, although mountain climbing and hiking are preferred by the general public. Although the environment is generally ill-suited for golf, there is a golf course in Nuuk.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pilersuisoq Supermarket in Kangerlussuaq\nMain article: Greenlandic cuisine\n\nThe national dish of Greenland is suaasat, a soup made from seal meat. Meat from marine mammals, game, birds, and fish play a large role in the Greenlandic diet. Due to the glacial landscape, most ingredients come from the ocean.[189] Spices are seldom used besides salt and pepper.[190] Greenlandic coffee is a \"flaming\" dessert coffee (set alight before serving) made with coffee, whiskey, Kahlúa, Grand Marnier, and whipped cream. It is stronger than the familiar Irish dessert coffee.[191]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nKalaallit Nunaata Radioa (KNR) is the public broadcasting company of Greenland. It is an associate member of Eurovision and an associate member of the Nordvision network. Nearly one hundred people are directly employed by this company, which is one of the largest in the territory.[192] The city of Nuuk also has its own radio and television station. The city of Nuuk also has a local television channel, Nanoq Media, which was created on 1 August 2002. It is the largest local television station in Greenland, reaching more than 4,000 households as receiving members, which corresponds to about 75% of all households in the capital.[193]\n\n\nToday only two newspapers are published in Greenland, both of which are distributed nationally. The Greenlandic weekly *Sermitsiaq* is published every Friday, while the online version is updated several times a day. It was distributed only in Nuuk until the 1980s. It is named after the mountain Sermitsiaq, located about 15 km (9.5 mi) northeast of Nuuk. The bi-weekly *Atuagagdliutit*/*Grønlandsposten* (AG) is the other newspaper in Greenland, published every Tuesday and Thursday in Greenlandic as *Atuagagdliutit* and in Danish as *Grønlandsposten*. The articles are all published in both languages.\n\n\n\n### Fine arts[edit]\n\n\nThe Inuit have their own arts and crafts tradition; for example, they carve tupilaks, sculptures of figures of avenging monsters practiced within shaman traditions.[194] This Kalaallisut word means soul or spirit of a deceased person and today describes an artistic figure, usually no more than 20 centimetres (8 in) tall, carved mainly from walrus ivory, with a variety of unusual shapes. This sculpture actually represents a mythical or spiritual being; usually, however, it has become a mere collector's item because of its grotesque appearance for Western visual habits. Modern artisans still use indigenous materials such as musk ox and sheep wool, seal fur, shells, soapstone, reindeer antlers or gemstones.\n\n\nThe history of Greenlandic painting began with Aron von Kangeq, who depicted the old Greenlandic sagas and myths in his drawings and watercolours in the mid-19th century. In the 20th century, landscape and animal painting developed, as well as printmaking and book illustrations with sometimes expressive colouring. It was mainly through their landscape paintings that Kiistat Lund and Buuti Pedersen became known abroad. Anne-Birthe Hove chose themes from Greenlandic social life. There is a museum of fine arts in Nuuk, the Nuuk Art Museum.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Index of Greenland-related articles\n* Outline of Greenland\n* Danish Realm\n\t+ Faroe Islands\n\n\n### Other similar territories[edit]\n\n\n* Åland (Finland)\n* Svalbard (Norway)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** *Nuna asiilasooq* has equal status as a regional anthem but is generally used only in Greenland.[1]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Greenlandic has been the sole official language of Greenland since 2009.[2][4]\n3. **^** As of 2000: 410,449 km2 (158,475 sq mi) ice-free; 1,755,637 km2 (677,855 sq mi) ice-covered.  \nDensity: 0.14/km2 (0.36/sq mi) for ice-free areas.\n4. **^** Afro-Eurasia, the Americas, Australia, and Antarctica are all larger than Greenland; but they are generally considered continents, not islands.[15]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"03EM/01.25.01-50 Spørgsmål til Landsstyret: Hvornår fremsætter Landsstyret beslutning om Grønlands\" [03EM/01.25.01-50 Questions to the Home Rule Government: When does the Home Rule Government make a decision on Greenland].
