Since the creation of the Premier League, the winners of The Football League were no longer English champions as the Premier League is a separate league.\n\n\nFollowing the codification of professional football by the Football Association in 1885,[1] the Football League was established in 1888, after meetings initiated by Aston Villa director William McGregor.[2] At the end of the 1888\u201389 season, Preston North End were the first club to be crowned champions after completing their fixtures unbeaten.[3]\n\n\nThe league's early years were dominated by teams from the North and Midlands, where professionalism had been embraced more readily than in the South of England.[4] Its status as the country's pre-eminent league was strengthened in 1892, when the rival Football Alliance was absorbed into the Football League.[5] Former Alliance clubs comprised the bulk of a new Second Division, from which promotion to the top level could be gained. It was not until 1931 that a Southern club were crowned champions, when Herbert Chapman's Arsenal secured the title.[6]\n\n\nRules stipulating a maximum wage for players were abolished in 1961. This resulted in a shift of power towards bigger clubs.[7] Financial considerations became an even bigger influence from 1992, when the teams then in the First Division defected to form the FA Premier League. This supplanted the Football League First Division as the highest level of football in England,[8] and due to a series of progressively larger television contracts, put unprecedented wealth into the hands of top flight clubs.[9] The first five champions in the Premier League era \u2013 Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United \u2013 had all won the title at least once prior to 1992. Leicester City were champions for the first time in 2016, becoming the first team to win the Premier League without having previously won the First Division. Other than inaugural league champions Preston North End, Ipswich Town remain the only club to win the top flight division at their first ever attempt.[10]\n\n\nAll the clubs which have ever been champions are still in existence today and all take part in the top four tiers of the English football league system. Sheffield Wednesday are the only club who have ever changed their name after winning a league title having been known as The Wednesday for the first three of their four titles.\n\n\nManchester United have won twenty titles,[11] the most of any club.[12] United's rivals Liverpool are second with nineteen. Liverpool dominated during the 1970s and 1980s (winning eleven league titles between 1973 and 1990), while Manchester United dominated in the 1990s and 2000s under manager Sir Alex Ferguson (eleven league titles between 1993\nand 2009). Arsenal are third with thirteen titles, having dominated during the 1930s (five league titles between 1931 and 1938). Everton and Manchester City are joint-fourth with nine titles, of which seven of City's have been won in the 2010s and 2020s. Aston Villa (seven) and Sunderland (six) secured the majority of their titles before the 1920s. Chelsea (six) won the majority of their titles in the 21st century (between 2005 and 2017).\n\n\nHuddersfield Town, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City are the only sides to have won the league title in three consecutive seasons; no team has been crowned champion four seasons in a row.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## List of champions[edit]\n\n\n### Football League

The most recent to join the list were Leicester City (2015\u201316 champions) and before that, Nottingham Forest (1977\u201378) and Derby County (1971\u201372).\n\n\nFive teams have won the league title three seasons in a row: Huddersfield Town (1924\u20131926), Arsenal (1933\u20131935), Liverpool (1982\u20131984), Manchester United twice (1999\u20132001 & 2007\u20132009) and Manchester City (2021\u20132023).\n\n\nSeven teams have at some point held first or joint first place in the number of titles won: Preston North End (1889\u20131895), Sunderland (1893\u20131899 and 1936\u20131953), Aston Villa (1897\u20131953), Arsenal (1948\u20131976), Liverpool (1966\u20131971 and 1973\u20132011), Manchester United (1967\u20131971 and 2009\u2013) and Everton (1970\u20131971).\n\n\nEight teams have finished as runners up without ever finishing top: Bristol City (1906\u201307), Oldham Athletic (1914\u201315), Cardiff City (1923\u201324), Charlton Athletic (1936\u201337), Blackpool (1955\u201356), Queens Park Rangers (1975\u201376), Watford (1982\u201383) and Southampton (1983\u201384). Of these, Cardiff City came closest to winning the league, matching champions Huddersfield Town in points but losing out on goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded), the precursor to goal difference.\n\n\nTeams in **bold** compete in the Premier League as of the 2023\u201324 season.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Club\n | Winners\n | Runners-up | Winning seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The club was founded as Newton Heath LYR F.C. in 1878 and turned professional in 1885, before joining the Football League in 1892. After a brush with bankruptcy in 1901, the club reformed as Manchester United in 1902. Manchester United currently play in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. They have not been out of the top tier since 1975, and they have never been lower than the second tier.[1] They have also been involved in European football ever since they became the first English club to enter the European Cup in 1956.[2]\n\n\nThis list encompasses the major honours won by Manchester United and records set by the club, their managers and their players. The player records section includes details of the club's leading goalscorers and those who have made most appearances in first-team competitions. It also records notable achievements by Manchester United players on the international stage, and the highest transfer fees paid and received by the club. The club's attendance records, both at Old Trafford, their home since 1910, and Maine Road, their temporary home from 1946 to 1949, are also included in the list.\n\n\nThe club currently holds the record for the most Premier League titles with 13, and the highest number of English top-flight titles with 20. The club's record appearance maker is Ryan Giggs, who made 963 appearances between 1991 and 2014, and the club's record goalscorer is Wayne Rooney, who scored 253 goals in 559 appearances between 2004 and 2017.\n\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of three medals sitting on a stand. One medal is gold and two are silver.](image)Winners' and runners-up medals from Manchester United's UEFA Champions League final appearances in 2008, 2009 and 2011\n![](image)Trophy cabinet of United on display in the Old Trafford museum\nManchester United's first trophy was the Manchester Cup, which they won as Newton Heath LYR in 1886.[3] Their first national senior honour came in 1908, when they won the 1907\u201308 Football League First Division title. The club also won the FA Cup for the first time the following year. In terms of the number of trophies won, the 1990s were Manchester United's most successful decade, during which they won five league titles, four FA Cups, one League Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared)[A], one Champions League, one Cup Winners' Cup, one Super Cup and one Intercontinental Cup.\n\n\nThe club currently holds the record for most top-division titles, with 20. They were also the first team to win the Premier League, as well as holding the record for the most Premier League titles (13), and became the first English team to win the European Cup when they won it in 1968. Their most recent trophy came in February 2023, when they won the EFL Cup.[4]\n\n\n\n### Domestic[edit]\n\n\n#### League[edit]\n\n\n* **First Division / Premier League (Level 1)[B]: 20 \u2013 record**\n\t+ 1907\u201308, 1910\u201311, 1951\u201352, 1955\u201356, 1956\u201357, 1964\u201365, 1966\u201367, 1992\u201393, 1993\u201394, 1995\u201396, 1996\u201397, 1998\u201399, 1999\u20132000, 2000\u201301, 2002\u201303, 2006\u201307, 2007\u201308, 2008\u201309, 2010\u201311, 2012\u201313\n* **Second Division (Level 2)[B]: 2**\n\t+ 1935\u201336, 1974\u201375\n\n\n#### Cups[edit]\n\n\n* **FA Cup: 12**\n\t+ 1908\u201309, 1947\u201348, 1962\u201363, 1976\u201377, 1982\u201383, 1984\u201385, 1989\u201390, 1993\u201394, 1995\u201396, 1998\u201399, 2003\u201304, 2015\u201316\n* **League/EFL Cup: 6**\n\t+ 1991\u201392, 2005\u201306, 2008\u201309, 2009\u201310, 2016\u201317, 2022\u201323\n* **FA Charity/Community Shield[A]: 21 (17 outright, 4 shared) \u2013 record**\n\t+ 1908, 1911, 1952, 1956, 1957, 1965\\*, 1967\\*, 1977\\*, 1983, 1990\\*, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016 (\\* joint holders)\n\n\n### European[edit]\n\n\n* **European Cup / UEFA Champions League: 3**\n\t+ 1967\u201368, 1998\u201399, 2007\u201308\n* **European Cup Winners' Cup: 1**\n\t+ 1990\u201391\n* **UEFA Europa League: 1**\n\t+ 2016\u201317\n* **European Super Cup: 1**\n\t+ 1991\n\n\n### Worldwide[edit]\n\n\n* **Intercontinental Cup: 1**\n\t+ 1999\n* **FIFA Club World Cup: 1**\n\t+ 2008\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n* **Laureus World Team of the Year**\n\t+ **Winner:** 2000[5]\n\n\n* **IFFHS World Club Team of the Year**\n\t+ **Winner:** 1999, 2008[6]\n\n\n* **PFA Merit Award**\n\t+ **Winner:** 1993, 2013\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\n![A side-on photograph of a man with red hair.

However, Matt Busby did not want to burden the young player with the \"\u00a330,000-man\" tag, and Barnsley agreed for the fee to be reduced by \u00a31 to \u00a329,999. Busby then took the extra pound from his wallet and gave it to the lady who had been serving the teas.[50]\n\n\nManchester United made their first six-figure signing in August 1962 with the transfer of Denis Law from Torino for \u00a3110,000,[*citation needed*] a new British record.[51] The club broke the British transfer record again in 1981 with the \u00a31.5\u00a0million signing of Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion.[52] When Andy Cole signed for United in January 1995, the club paid \u00a37\u00a0million, almost double their previous record of \u00a33.75\u00a0million, which they paid for Roy Keane 18 months earlier.[*citation needed*] In the summer of 2001, the club broke their transfer record twice in the space of a month, first paying PSV Eindhoven \u00a319\u00a0million for Ruud van Nistelrooy, and then \u00a328.1\u00a0million to Lazio for Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n. Manchester United have broken the British transfer record three times since buying Ver\u00f3n, with the signings of Rio Ferdinand in July 2002,[53] \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda[*citation needed*] in August 2014 and Paul Pogba in August 2016.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n*Transfers in **bold** are also records for fees paid by British clubs*[54][55]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Player | Bought from | Fee[56][57] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January 1900 | ![England](image) Gilbert Godsmark | Ashford | \u00a340[*citation needed*] |\n| January 1903 | ![Scotland](image) Alex Bell | Ayr Parkhouse | \u00a3700[*citation needed*] |\n| July 1910 | ![England](image) Leslie Hofton | Glossop | \u00a31,000[*citation needed*] |\n| March 1914 | ![England](image) George Hunter | Chelsea | \u00a31,300[*citation needed*] |\n| September 1920 | ![Scotland](image) Tom Miller | Liverpool | \u00a32,000[*citation needed*] |\n| November 1921 | ![Scotland](image) Neil McBain | Ayr United | \u00a36,000[*citation needed*] |\n| February 1938 | ![England](image) Jack Smith | Newcastle United | \u00a36,500[*citation needed*] |\n| March 1949 | ![Scotland](image) John Downie | Bradford Park Avenue | \u00a318,000[*citation needed*] |\n| March 1953 | ![England](image) Tommy Taylor | Barnsley | \u00a329,999[*citation needed*] |\n| September 1958 | ![England](image) Albert Quixall | Sheffield Wednesday | \u00a345,000[*citation needed*] |\n| August 1962 | ![Scotland](image) **Denis Law** | Torino | **\u00a3110,000** |\n| August 1968 | ![Scotland](image) Willie Morgan | Burnley | \u00a3117,000\n |\n| February 1972 | ![Scotland](image) Martin Buchan | Aberdeen | \u00a3125,000\n |\n| March 1972 | ![England](image) Ian Storey-Moore | Nottingham Forest | \u00a3200,000\n |\n| January 1978 | ![Scotland](image) Joe Jordan | Leeds United | \u00a3350,000\n |\n| February 1978 | ![Scotland](image) **Gordon McQueen** | Leeds United | **\u00a3495,000** |\n| August 1979 | ![England](image) Ray Wilkins | Chelsea | \u00a3825,000\n |\n| October 1980 | ![England](image) Garry Birtles | Nottingham Forest | \u00a31,250,000\n |\n| October 1981 | ![England](image) **Bryan Robson** | West Bromwich Albion | **\u00a31,500,000** |\n| June 1988 | ![Wales](image) Mark Hughes | Barcelona | \u00a31,800,000\n |\n| August 1989 | ![England](image) Gary Pallister | Middlesbrough | \u00a32,300,000\n |\n| July 1993 | ![Republic of Ireland](image) **Roy Keane** | Nottingham Forest | **\u00a33,750,000** |\n| January 1995 | ![England](image) **Andy Cole** | Newcastle United | **\u00a37,000,000** |\n| July 1998 | ![Netherlands](image) Jaap Stam | PSV Eindhoven | \u00a310,750,000\n |\n| August 1998 | ![Trinidad and Tobago](image) Dwight Yorke | Aston Villa | \u00a312,600,000\n |\n| June 2001 | ![Netherlands](image) **Ruud van Nistelrooy** | PSV Eindhoven | **\u00a319,000,000** |\n| July 2001 | ![Argentina](image) **Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n** | Lazio | **\u00a328,100,000** |\n| July 2002 | ![England](image) **Rio Ferdinand** | Leeds United | **\u00a329,300,000** |\n| September 2008 | ![Bulgaria](image) Dimitar Berbatov | Tottenham Hotspur | \u00a330,750,000\n |\n| January 2014 | ![Spain](image) Juan Mata | Chelsea | \u00a337,100,000\n |\n| August 2014 | ![Argentina](image) **\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda** | Real Madrid | **\u00a359,700,000** |\n| August 2016 | ![France](image) **Paul Pogba** | Juventus | **\u00a389,300,000** |\n\n\n#### Highest transfer fees received[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of a smiling man with a shaven head.

That same month, Manchester City paid five times more for Scottish forward Joe Cassidy. The club's first \u00a31,000 sale came 12 years later with the sale of Harold Halse to Aston Villa.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe club's first British record sale came in March 1949, when Derby County paid \u00a324,500 for Johnny Morris. However, 35 years passed before Manchester United next broke the record for the biggest sale by a British club; the sale of Ray Wilkins to Milan for \u00a31.5\u00a0million in June 1984 was also the club's first million-pound sale. Another British record followed two years later with the sale of Mark Hughes to Barcelona for \u00a32.5\u00a0million. The club's record sale increased fivefold in the space of two transfers over the next 15 years; first with the \u00a37\u00a0million sale of Paul Ince to Internazionale in 1995, and then the 2001 transfer of Jaap Stam to Lazio for \u00a315.25\u00a0million.[*citation needed*] Manchester United broke the world transfer record for the first time in July 2009 with the \u00a380\u00a0million sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid.[58]\n\n\n\n*Transfers in **bold** are also British record transfers*\n\n\n| Date | Player | Sold to | Fee[56] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| April 1900 | ![England](image) William Bryant | Blackburn Rovers | \u00a350[*citation needed*] |\n| April 1900 | ![Scotland](image) Joe Cassidy | Manchester City | \u00a3250[*citation needed*] |\n| October 1909 | ![Scotland](image) Alex Downie | Oldham Athletic | \u00a3600[*citation needed*] |\n| June 1911 | ![England](image) Ted Connor | Sheffield United | \u00a3750[*citation needed*] |\n| July 1912 | ![England](image) Harold Halse | Aston Villa | \u00a31,200[*citation needed*] |\n| August 1913 | ![England](image) Charlie Roberts | Oldham Athletic | \u00a31,750[*citation needed*] |\n| December 1920 | ![England](image) Tommy Meehan | Chelsea | \u00a33,300[*citation needed*] |\n| September 1937 | ![Scotland](image) George Mutch | Preston North End | \u00a35,000[*citation needed*] |\n| March 1948 | ![England](image) Joe Walton | Preston North End | \u00a310,000[*citation needed*] |\n| March 1949 | ![England](image) **Johnny Morris** | Derby County | **\u00a324,500**[*citation needed*] |\n| January 1962 | ![England](image) Dennis Viollet | Stoke City | \u00a325,000[*citation needed*] |\n| March 1962 | ![England](image) Warren Bradley | Bury | \u00a340,000[*citation needed*] |\n| June 1972 | ![Scotland](image) Francis Burns | Southampton | \u00a350,000\n |\n| June 1972 | ![England](image) Alan Gowling | Huddersfield Town | \u00a360,000\n |\n| March 1973 | ![Scotland](image) Ted MacDougall | West Ham United | \u00a3130,000\n |\n| March 1977 | ![Republic of Ireland](image) Gerry Daly | Derby County | \u00a3175,000\n |\n| April 1978 | ![England](image) Gordon Hill | Derby County | \u00a3250,000\n |\n| August 1979 | ![England](image) Brian Greenhoff | Leeds United | \u00a3350,000\n |\n| October 1980 | ![England](image) Andy Ritchie | Brighton & Hove Albion | \u00a3500,000\n |\n| June 1984 | ![England](image) **Ray Wilkins** | Milan | **\u00a31,500,000** |\n| August 1986 | ![Wales](image) **Mark Hughes** | Barcelona | **\u00a32,500,000** |\n| July 1995 | ![England](image) Paul Ince | Internazionale | \u00a37,000,000\n |\n| August 2001 | ![Netherlands](image) Jaap Stam | Lazio | \u00a315,250,000[66] |\n| June 2003 | ![England](image) David Beckham | Real Madrid | \u00a324,500,000[62] |\n| July 2009 | ![Portugal](image) **Cristiano Ronaldo** | Real Madrid | **\u00a380,000,000**[58] |\n\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\n![A wooden board headed with the Manchester United crest and the words \"International Honours Board\", with names in gold writing on eight slate panels, protected by perspex panels.](image)Manchester United's international players are listed in the players' lounge at Old Trafford.\n* First international: Jack Powell and Tom Burke for Wales against England (26 February 1887)[68]\n\t+ All nine of Newton Heath's international players played for Wales.[68] The first non-Welshman to be capped, and the first after the club's change of name to Manchester United, was Charlie Roberts, who was capped for England against Ireland on 25 February 1905.[69]\n* Most international caps (total): **201** \u2013 Cristiano Ronaldo \u2013 Portugal (82 while with the club)[70]\n* Most international caps as a United player: **106** \u2013 Bobby Charlton \u2013 England[69]\n\n\n#### Honours[edit]\n\n\nCurrent Manchester United players **in bold**.

Widely considered one of the best players of his generation, Rooney is the record goalscorer for Manchester United, and was the record goalscorer for the England national team from 2015 to 2023. He has also made more appearances for England than any other outfield player.[4] Rooney spent most of his playing career as a forward, but was also used in various midfield roles.\n\n\nRooney joined the Everton youth team at the age of nine and made his professional debut for the club in 2002 at the age of 16. He spent two seasons at the Merseyside club before moving to Manchester United for \u00a325.6\u00a0million in the 2004 summer transfer window, where he won 16 trophies and became the only English player, alongside teammate Michael Carrick, to win the Premier League, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League, League Cup, UEFA Europa League, and FIFA Club World Cup.[5][6][7] He scored 253 goals for United in all competitions, making him the club's top goalscorer of all time; his 183 Premier League goals for United is the third-most scored by a player in that competition for any single club, behind only Harry Kane (currently 188 goals for Tottenham Hotspur) and Sergio Ag\u00fcero (184 goals for Manchester City). Rooney's 208 Premier League goals make him that competition's third-highest scorer of all time. He also has the third-highest number of assists in the Premier League, with 103.[8]\n\n\nRooney made his senior international debut for England in February 2003, aged 17, and is England's youngest-ever goalscorer.[9] He played at UEFA Euro 2004 and scored four goals, briefly becoming the youngest goalscorer in the history of the European Championship. Rooney later featured at the 2006, 2010 and 2014 World Cups, and was widely regarded as his country's best player.[10][11] He has won the England Player of the Year award four times, in 2008, 2009, 2014, and 2015. With 53 goals in 120 international caps, Rooney is England's second-most-capped player (behind Peter Shilton) and second-top goalscorer.\n\n\nRooney won the PFA Players' Player of the Year and the FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the 2009\u201310 season, and he has won the Premier League Player of the Month award five times throughout his career. He came fifth in the vote for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or, and he was named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI for 2011. He won the Goal of the Season award by the BBC's *Match of the Day* poll on three occasions, and his February 2011 bicycle kick against city rivals Manchester City won the Premier League 20 Seasons Awards Best Goal award.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nWayne Mark Rooney[13] was born in the Croxteth area of Liverpool on 24 October 1985, the son of Jeanette Marie (n\u00e9e Morrey) and Thomas Wayne Rooney.[14] He is of Irish descent through his father,[15][16][17] and was brought up as a Roman Catholic[18][19] with his younger brothers Graham and John.[20] He and his brothers attended Our Lady and St Swithin's Primary School[21] and De La Salle School.[22] John also later became a footballer. Rooney grew up supporting Everton.[23] He admired Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with Rooney stating that \"as an out-and-out forward [Ronaldo] was probably the best\".[24]\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Everton[edit]\n\n\n#### Youth squads[edit]\n\n\nRooney began playing for Liverpool Schoolboys and scored 72 goals in one season, a record which stood until May 2010.[25] At the age of nine, Rooney played for Copplehouse boys' club in the local Walton and Kirkdale junior league and scored 99 goals in his final season before being spotted by Everton scout Bob Pendleton.[26] Rooney joined Everton at age nine,[27] and was the Everton mascot for the Merseyside derby against Liverpool as an 11-year-old.[28] In the 1995\u201396 season, he scored 114 goals in 29 games for Everton's under-10s and 11s,[29] and by the age of 15, he was playing for the under-19s.[30] He scored eight goals in eight games during Everton's run to the FA Youth Cup Final in 2002.[31] This included one goal in the final defeat against Aston Villa and, upon scoring, he revealed a T-shirt that read, \"Once a Blue, always a Blue.\"[27] Rooney was included in Everton's first team squad for their training camp in Austria in the summer of 2002 and scored his first senior goal in a 3\u20131 friendly victory over SC Weiz on 15 July.[30]\n\n\n\n#### First team breakthrough[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"Rooney is the biggest England talent I've seen since I arrived in England. There has certainly not been a player under 20 as good as him since I became a manager here.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nArs\u00e8ne Wenger on Rooney following his last-minute goal against Arsenal in October 2002.[32]\n\nRooney was an unused substitute in Everton's 1\u20130 away win over Southampton on 20 April 2002.[33] He made his senior debut on 17 August in a 2\u20132 home draw against Tottenham Hotspur, starting the match and assisting the first goal by Mark Pembridge.[34] He became the second-youngest first-team player in Everton history behind Joe Royle.[35] In that match, he was booed by the Spurs fans who shouted \"Who are ya?\" whenever he touched the ball.[36] His first senior goals came on 2 October when he scored twice in a 3\u20130 away win over Wrexham in the second round of the League Cup.[37] These goals meant that Rooney was Everton's youngest-ever goalscorer at the time.[38]\n\n\nOn 19 October, five days before his 17th birthday, Rooney scored a last-minute winning goal against Arsenal.[39] The goal ended Arsenal's 30-match unbeaten run,[40] and also made Rooney the youngest goalscorer in Premier League history, a record that has since been surpassed by James Milner and James Vaughan.[41] He scored in a 1\u20130 away win over Leeds United 15 days later.[42]\n\n\nIn December, Rooney was named 2002's BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year.[43] Six days after claiming the award he scored the winning goal against Blackburn Rovers in a 2\u20131 home win.[44] His first career red card came on Boxing Day in a 1\u20131 away draw against Birmingham City for a late challenge on Steve Vickers.[45] In January 2003, Rooney signed his first professional contract, which made him one of world football's highest-paid teenagers.[46] Rooney's first goal of 2003 came on 23 March, netting Everton's only goal in a 2\u20131 loss at Arsenal.[47] In April, he scored a goal in Everton's 2\u20131 home win over Newcastle United,[48] before hitting a last-minute winner against Aston Villa in another 2\u20131 home win.[49] He ended his debut season with eight goals in 37 appearances in all competitions for the Toffees.[50]\n\n\nRooney scored his first goal of the 2003\u201304 season in a 2\u20132 away draw against Charlton Athletic on 26 August 2003.[51] He did not find the net again until December when he scored in a 2\u20131 away win over Portsmouth,[52] and a 3\u20132 home win over Leicester City.[53] His final goal of 2003 came on his 50th league appearance, netting in a 1\u20130 home win over Birmingham City on 28 December.[54] On 21 February 2004, Rooney scored two goals in a Premier League game for the first time in a 3\u20133 away draw against Southampton.[55] He scored the sole goal in a 1\u20130 win over Portsmouth on 13 March,[56] before scoring in a 1\u20131 away draw against Leicester City one week later.[57] He scored his final goal of the season in a 1\u20131 away draw against Leeds United on 13 April.[58]\n\n\n\n### Manchester United[edit]\n\n\n#### 2004\u20132007: Adapting to the Red Devils[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2004, Everton offered Rooney a new five-year contract valued at \u00a350,000 per week,[59] the most lucrative ever offered by the club.[60] Amidst increasing speculation linking Rooney with a transfer, Everton chairman Bill Kenwright admitted the club's financial situation meant a transfer would \"revitalise\" the club.[61] Everton rejected a bid of \u00a320\u00a0million from Newcastle,[62] and Rooney submitted a transfer request on 27 August,[63] with Moyes saying he would not leave unless the club got the right price for him.[64] He ultimately signed for Manchester United at the end of the month after an initial \u00a320\u00a0million deal was reached, with an additional \u00a37\u00a0million in contingency payments, with Rooney signing a five-year contract.[65][66] It was the highest fee ever paid for a player under 20 years old; Rooney was still only 18 when he left Everton.[67] Sir Alex Ferguson, then manager of United, said that \"There were plenty of eyebrows raised\" when he persuaded the club's board of directors to sanction \"a multi-million pound\" move to try to sign Rooney from Everton.[68] In an appearance on United's official podcast in 2020, Rooney revealed Everton had wanted him to sign for Chelsea to ensure a bigger transfer fee,[69] while the mooted transfer to Newcastle would have seen a clause put in place for him to leave after a year to join United.[70]\n\n\n\n> \n> Rooney can do the lot. Eventually he'll have all the United records.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 United legend Denis Law in September 2004.[71]\n\nRooney was given the number 8 shirt upon his arrival at Old Trafford.[72] He made his United debut on 28 September in a 6\u20132 home win over Fenerbah\u00e7e in the UEFA Champions League, scoring a hat-trick and laying on an assist.[73] These goals made Rooney the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the Champions League aged 18 years 335 days.[74] His first season with Manchester United, however, ended without winning a trophy as they could only manage a third-place finish in the league,[75] and failed to progress to the last eight of the Champions League.[76] United had more success in the cup competitions, but were edged out of the League Cup in the semi-finals by a Chelsea side[77] who also won the Premier League title that season.[78] Rooney's second goal in the FA Cup against Middlesbrough on 29 January 2005, a volley hit with the outside of his right foot from the edge of the 18-yard box, was named BBC Goal of the Season.[79] A goalless draw with Arsenal in the FA Cup final was followed by a penalty shoot-out defeat.[80] Rooney was United's top league scorer that season with 11 goals, and was credited with the PFA Young Player of the Year award.[81]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rooney during Manchester United's 3\u20131 Premier League win over Manchester City in the derby, in which he scored the game's first goal, December 2006\nIn September 2005, Rooney was sent off in a goalless Champions League match against Villarreal of Spain for sarcastically clapping the referee, who had booked him for an unintentional foul on an opponent.[82] His first trophy with United came in the 2005\u201306 League Cup,[83] and he was also named man of the match after scoring twice in the final as United won 4\u20130 against Wigan Athletic.[84] His club finished the season as Premier League runners up, with their title hopes ended in late April when they lost 3\u20130 away to champions Chelsea.[85] Rooney sustained a broken metatarsal in that game after a tackle from Paulo Ferreira. Rooney scored a total of 16 goals in 26 Premier League games in the 2005\u201306 season.[86]\n\n\nRooney was sent off in the 2006 Amsterdam Tournament match against Porto on 4 August 2006 after hitting Porto defender Pepe with his elbow.[87] He was punished with a three-match ban by the FA, following their receipt of a 23-page report from referee Ruud Bossen that explained his decision.[88] Rooney threatened to withdraw the FA's permission to use his image if they did not revoke the ban,[89] although the FA had no power to make such a decision.\n\n\nDuring the first half of the 2006\u201307 season, Rooney endured a ten-game scoreless streak before scoring a hat-trick against Bolton Wanderers.[90] He subsequently signed a two-year contract extension the following month that tied him to United until 2012. In April 2007, Rooney scored and provided an assist for Chris Eagles in a crucial 4\u20132 league win for Manchester United at his former club Everton, a game that also became notable for Rooney's response to fans that once cheered him.\n\n\n\n\n> 'Once a Blue, always a Blue'. Wayne Rooney's infamous t-shirt was supposed to declare his love for Everton but later fuelled the feeling of betrayal felt by some Everton supporters after his transfer to Manchester United. The boos rang out as loud as ever when Rooney and co. took on Everton at Goodison Park. On 50 minutes, with Everton 2\u20130 up, it seemed the home fans would have the last laugh. However, United fought back and levelled before Rooney tapped in at the far post with 11 minutes to go \u2013 and promptly kissed the badge of his United shirt.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aSky Sports on Rooney's goal celebration where he kissed the Manchester United badge when scoring against his boyhood club, April 2007.[91]\n> \n\n\nIn the same month, Rooney scored two goals in an 8\u20133 aggregate Champions League quarter-final win over Roma[92] and two more in the same competition at the end of April, in a 3\u20132 semi-final first leg victory over AC Milan.[93] Rooney collected his first Premier League title winner's medal at the end of the 2006\u201307 season.[94] He scored 14 league goals that season.[95]\n\n\n\n#### 2007\u20132010: The number 10 shirt[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rooney during the 2008 UEFA Champions League Group E match between Celtic and Manchester United\nIn June 2007, Rooney was given squad number 10, last worn by Ruud van Nistelrooy.[96][97] Rooney reasoned that he always loved that number.[98] He fractured his left metatarsal in United's opening-day goalless draw against Reading on 12 August,[99] the same injury he had suffered to his right foot in 2004.[100] After being sidelined for six weeks, he returned and scored in United's 1\u20130 Champions League group stage win over Roma on 2 October.[101] Rooney was again injured on 9 November, hurting his ankle during a training session and missing an additional two weeks.[102] His next match after injury was against Fulham on 3 December, in which he played 70 minutes.[103] Rooney missed ten games and finished the 2007\u201308 season with 18 goals (12 of them in the league),[86] as United clinched the Premier League.[104] In the Champions League's first-ever all-English final,[105] United defeated league rivals Chelsea to win another trophy.[106]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rooney takes on Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and Sergio Busquets of Barcelona during the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final.\nRooney played in 2008 UEFA Super Cup where United lost to Zenit Saint Petersburg and was unable to make an impact.[107] On 4 October 2008, in an away win over Blackburn, Rooney became the youngest player to make 200 Premier League appearances.[108] On 18 December, Rooney scored twice in the 5\u20133 semi-final victory over Japanese club Gamba Osaka in the FIFA Club World Cup,[109] and, after scoring the winning goal as United beat LDU Quito 1\u20130 in the final in Yokohama,[110] was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player in the tournament.[111] On 14 January after scoring 54 seconds into the 1\u20130 win over Wigan, Rooney limped off with a hamstring injury in the eighth minute.[112] On 25 April 2009, Rooney scored his final league goals of the season against Tottenham; United scored five goals in the second half to come from 2\u20130 down to win 5\u20132; Rooney scored two goals, set up two and provided the assist that led to the penalty for United's first goal.[113] On 27 May, Rooney played against Barcelona in the 2009 Champions League Final in Rome, with United losing 2\u20130.[114] Rooney ended the season with 20 goals in all competitions. Once again, he managed 12 goals in the league.[86]\n\n\nRooney scored in the 90th minute of the season-opening 2009 Community Shield, although United lost the game to Chelsea on penalties.[115] He then scored the only goal of the first league game of the 2009\u201310 season against Birmingham City, taking his overall United tally to 99.[116] On 22 August, he became the 20th Manchester United player to score 100 goals for the club, when he found the net twice in a 5\u20130 away win at Wigan.[117] On 29 August, United played Arsenal at Old Trafford. Rooney scored a goal from the penalty spot to level the game after Andrey Arshavin had put the Gunners ahead. The game finished 2\u20131 to Manchester United after Abou Diaby scored an own goal.[118] On 28 November 2009, Rooney scored his first hat-trick for three years in a 4\u20131 away victory against Portsmouth, with two of the goals being penalties.[119] On 27 December 2009, he was awarded Man of the Match against Hull City. He was involved in all the goals scored in the game, hitting the opener and then giving away the ball for Hull's equalising penalty. He then forced Andy Dawson into conceding an own goal and then set up Dimitar Berbatov for United's third goal which gave them a 3\u20131 victory.[120] On 30 December 2009, Rooney scored another goal as United beat Wigan 5\u20130 in their final game of the decade.[121]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rooney in a November 2009 Premier League match against Everton\nOn 23 January 2010, Rooney scored all four goals in Manchester United's 4\u20130 win over Hull; three of the goals came in the last ten minutes of the match. This was the first time in his career that he registered four goals in a single match.[122] On 27 January 2010, he continued his scoring run by heading the winner in the second minute of stoppage time against derby rivals Manchester City. This gave United a 4\u20133 aggregate win, taking them into the final; it was his first League Cup goal since netting two in the 2006 final.[123] On 31 January 2010, Rooney scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 3\u20131 win over Arsenal for the first time in the league at Emirates Stadium, notably his first Premier League goal also came against Arsenal.[124] On 16 February 2010, Rooney hit his first European goals of the season, scoring two headers in the 3\u20132 away win against Milan in Manchester United's first ever win against them at the San Siro.[125] On 28 February 2010, he scored another header against Aston Villa (his fifth consecutive headed goal) which resulted in Manchester United winning the League Cup final 2\u20131.[126] In the second leg of United's European tie against Milan, Rooney scored a brace in a resounding 4\u20130 home victory, taking his tally of goals that season to 30.[127] He then added two more to his tally five days later at Old Trafford, in a 3\u20130 league win over Fulham.[128]\n\n\nOn 30 March, during United's Champions League quarter-final first leg defeat against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, Rooney crumpled when he twisted his ankle in the last minute, hobbling off while Bayern were producing the buildup that led to their second goal.[129] There were fears that he had received serious ligament damage or even a broken ankle, but it was announced that the injury was only slight ligament damage, and that he would be out for two to three weeks,[130] missing United's crunch match with Chelsea and the return leg against Bayern the following week.[130] The team list for second leg yielded a massive surprise when Rooney was given a starting place in the United line-up.[131] Despite a 3\u20130 lead by the 41st minute, Bayern snatched a goal back and United were later forced down to 10 men after Rafael was sent-off. Bayern won the match after netting a second away-goal[131] and Rooney was substituted after re-damaging his ankle. On 25 April, Rooney was named the 2010 PFA Players' Player of the Year.[132]\n\n\n\n#### 2010\u20132011: Ambition dispute[edit]\n\n\nOn 28 August 2010, Rooney scored his first goal of the season as he netted a penalty in a 3\u20130 home win over West Ham United.[133] In October, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson stated at a press conference that Rooney wanted to quit the club.[134] This came after a period of dispute as to the extent of Rooney's ankle injury, where Rooney had refuted Ferguson's claim that the injury was the reason Rooney had been dropped to the bench.[135] Rooney and his representatives released a statement regarding his decision to leave the club, insisting it was not down to money but ambition.[136] Following this statement, Rooney made a dramatic U-turn and agreed a new five-year contract at Manchester United until June 2015.[137]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"It was stunning. Unbelievable. We've had some fantastic goals here but in terms of execution... you'll never see that.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nSir Alex Ferguson on Rooney's bicycle kick match-winner against Manchester City.[138]\n\nRooney made his return to the first team as a substitute against Wigan on 20 November.[139] Four days later, he returned to the starting line-up and scored a penalty in a 1\u20130 away win over Rangers in the Champions League.[140] He missed a penalty in a 1\u20130 home win over Arsenal on 13 December.[141] His first goal of the season from open play came on 1 January 2011 in a 2\u20131 away win over West Bromwich Albion.[142] On 1 February, Rooney scored twice and provided an assist for Nemanja Vidi\u0107 in a 3\u20131 home win over Aston Villa.[143] On 12 February, Rooney scored an overhead bicycle kick in the 78th minute of the Manchester derby, which proved to be the winning goal in a 2\u20131 win over Manchester City.[144] After the match, Rooney said it was the best goal of his career,[145] before Sir Alex Ferguson described the strike as the best goal he had ever witnessed at Old Trafford.[146] The acrobatic strike from 10 yards out would win Rooney his third BBC Goal of the Season award, and it was shortlisted for the FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award for Goal of the Year (ultimately won by Neymar).[147] Two weeks later, he scored the third goal in a 4\u20130 away win over Wigan,[148] before opening the scoring in a 2\u20131 away loss to Chelsea on 1 March.[149] Rooney scored the second goal in a 2\u20130 home win over Arsenal in an FA Cup tie on 12 March.[150]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rooney preparing to take a free kick for Manchester United vs MLS All Stars at the Red Bull Arena in New Jersey, July 2011\nOn 2 April, United came from two goals down as Rooney scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 4\u20132 away win over West Ham.[151] This was his fifth hat-trick for Manchester United, whilst the second goal was his 100th in the Premier League for the club.[152] He became the third Manchester United player to score 100 Premier League goals, joining Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes.[153] During Rooney's celebrations following his third goal, he swore into a pitchside camera and was subsequently charged by the FA for using offensive language.[154] Rooney accepted the charge, but not the automatic two-match ban which was handed to him.[155] He appealed against the length of the suspension, calling it \"excessive\", but failed to overturn the ban, which ruled him out of the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City on 16 April.[156] The following game on 6 April saw Rooney score in a 1\u20130 away win against Chelsea in the Champions League quarter-final first leg.[157] He followed this goal up with another strike in the semi-final first leg against German side Schalke 04 on 26 April, scoring the second of a 2\u20130 away win.[158] This was the first time Rooney had returned to the Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen since his sending off during the 2006 FIFA World Cup against Portugal.[159]\n\n\nOn 14 May 2011, Rooney scored a penalty for United to equalise in a 1\u20131 draw against Blackburn at Ewood Park in the penultimate game of the Premier League season \u2013 enough to secure a record 19th top division title for United, and giving Rooney his fourth Premier League title winner's medal.[160]\n\n\n\n#### 2011\u20132013: Divisional success[edit]\n\n\nRooney started the season with a goal in the first league game at The Hawthorns against West Bromwich Albion. Rooney played a one-two with Ashley Young before a sharp turn and finish from outside the box which found the bottom corner of the goal. He also scored in the second game of the season, at home to Tottenham Hotspur, when he headed in a Ryan Giggs cross.[161] In late August, Rooney scored his 150th goal for United, the first of a hat-trick, helping to beat Arsenal 8\u20132. Rooney won man of the match, scoring two free kicks, a penalty, and also contributing an assist for Nani. On 10 September, Rooney scored another hat-trick in a 5\u20130 away win over Bolton Wanderers on 10 September, becoming only the fourth player in Premier League history to score a hat-trick in consecutive games.[162] These goals brought him level with Bobby Charlton on seven United hat-tricks, joint fourth on the all-time list behind Denis Law, Jack Rowley and Dennis Viollet.[163] After the fallout from his red card against Montenegro on international duty, Rooney was left out of the starting line-up against Liverpool on 15 October 2011.[164] He returned to action on 18 October 2011, where he scored two goals in the Champions League group stage match against O\u021belul Gala\u021bi and surpassed his former teammate Paul Scholes as the highest-scoring Englishman in Champions League history.[165]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rooney lines up a free kick against Sunderland on the final day of the 2011\u201312 Premier League season. Despite Rooney's winner, United lost out on the league title to Sergio Ag\u00fcero's last minute goal for Manchester City.\nOn 10 December, Rooney ended an eight-game goal drought with a brace against Wolverhampton Wanderers in a 4\u20131 win at Old Trafford.[166] On 18 December, Rooney continued his goalscoring form, heading home the opening goal against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road; it was Manchester United's quickest of the season so far, as Rooney turned home Antonio Valencia's cross after just 52 seconds.[167] On 21 December, Rooney scored his 130th Premier League goal in his 300th Premier League appearance against Fulham at Craven Cottage with a long-range effort that crashed in off the inside of the post in a 5\u20130 win.[168]\n\n\nOn 8 January, Rooney scored two goals in the 3\u20132 win over Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium in the FA Cup third round.[169] With these goals, Rooney passed Mark Hughes in United's all-time top goalscorers table, moving up to seventh place overall with 164 goals.[169] On 14 January, Rooney made a big contribution to his team in a 3\u20130 home win against Bolton. Although he missed a penalty, he did create two goals by assisting Paul Scholes for the first goal and Danny Welbeck for the second.[170] On 5 February, Rooney scored twice from the penalty spot as United came back from a 3\u20130 deficit to draw 3\u20133 in a Premier League clash against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.[171] On 11 February 2012, Rooney marked his 500th senior career game by scoring two goals as Manchester United beat rivals Liverpool 2\u20131 at Old Trafford. This was also his 350th game for United in all competitions. On 4 March, Rooney scored the first goal in a 3\u20131 away win against Tottenham at White Hart Lane and passed Joe Spence in Manchester United's all-time top goalscorers table, moving up to sixth place overall with 169 goals. He scored another brace in his next game, against Atletico Bilbao in the UEFA Europa League.[172] On 11 March, Rooney scored the two goals that brought United the victory against West Brom in a 2\u20130 home win.

Their rivals for the Premier League title, Manchester City, were losing 2\u20131 in their game going into injury time, so Rooney's winner looked like it would seal the title. However, Manchester City scored twice in injury time, the clincher a 94th-minute winner from Sergio Ag\u00fcero, to take the trophy.[174]\n\n\nDespite starting the opening game of the 2012\u201313 season against Everton,[175] Rooney was dropped to the bench for the second game against Fulham in favour of new signing Robin van Persie.[176] After coming on for Shinji Kagawa in the 68th minute, Rooney suffered a severe gash to his right leg caused by Fulham's Hugo Rodallega that kept him out for four weeks.[177] He made his comeback on 29 September in a 3\u20132 loss against Tottenham.[178] Rooney scored his first goals of the season in a 4\u20132 league win at home to Stoke City on 20 October, where he reached his 200th club goal.[179] On 7 November, he scored his first Champions League goal of the season, scoring a penalty in a 3\u20131 win against Braga.[180] He scored twice and provided an assist in a 4\u20133 win against Reading on 1 December.[181] He scored a brace in the Manchester derby at the City of Manchester Stadium on 9 December 2012 which United won 3\u20132.[182] On 16 January, he scored a goal against West Ham in the FA Cup.[183] A fortnight later, he scored twice in a 2\u20131 win against Southampton.[184] He continued to score goals in FA Cup consecutive matches against Fulham[185] and Chelsea.[186] On 12 May, Sir Alex Ferguson announced, after United's 2\u20131 win against Swansea City, that Rooney had handed in his transfer request, a match in which Rooney also requested not to play.[187]\n\n\n\n#### 2013\u20132015: Post-Fergie years[edit]\n\n\nOn 5 July 2013, new United manager David Moyes announced that Rooney was not for sale, after speculation that Chelsea, Arsenal, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain were among the clubs looking to sign him.[188][189][190] On 17 July 2013, Chelsea confirmed that they had made a bid for Rooney the previous day, thought to be in the region of \u00a320\u00a0million,[191] however it had been rejected by Manchester United.[192] He suffered a head gash in training on 31 August after a collision with Phil Jones which kept him out of the match against Liverpool.

Replay seemed to have shown that Rooney had not come in contact with the goalkeeper.[213] England manager Roy Hodgson, however, defended Rooney, saying that he was forced to take evasive action.[214] Rooney later apologised for his behaviour, saying, \"that was my chance to get a penalty. I had to use that.\"[215] The penalty was also Rooney's first goal in 2015, ending a goalless run.[216] On 28 February 2015, he scored a brace in a 2\u20130 victory over Sunderland, thus becoming the first player to score more than 10 goals in 11 successive seasons.[217] On 15 March, Rooney scored the third goal in a 3\u20130 win over Tottenham.[218] Rooney was Manchester United's top goalscorer for the 2014\u201315 campaign, but his tally of 14 was the lowest by a leading scorer since 1982. United's goal total of 62 was also its second-worst in the Premier League era.[219]\n\n\n\n#### 2015\u20132017: Final years and exit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rooney playing for Manchester United in a UEFA Champions League match against CSKA Moscow in Russia, 21 October 2015\nOn 26 August 2015, Rooney ended an 878-minute scoreless streak by scoring a hat-trick in a 4\u20130 win (7\u20131 aggregate) over Belgian side Club Brugge in the second leg of their Champions League play-off.

United, Rooney agreed a deal to return to England as a player-coach with EFL Championship side Derby County in January 2020.[263] Rooney was instantly named captain and his debut came on 2 January as he started and assisted the first goal in a 2\u20131 win against Barnsley.[264] Rooney scored six goals in twenty four appearances, including the deciding goals in a 2\u20131 victory against Reading and a 1\u20130 win at Preston North End, as Derby finished the season in 10th.\n\n\nRooney's first goal of the 2020\u201321 season came in the fourth match as his 87th-minute free kick proved the difference in 1\u20130 win away to Norwich City. It was Derby's first win of the season and took the club out of the bottom three after opening the campaign with three successive defeats. Results did not improve however, with manager Phillip Cocu leaving by mutual consent after a 1\u20130 home defeat to Queens Park Rangers. Rooney in particular came under criticism for his performances in the opening stages of the season.[265] It was announced on 26 November that Rooney, who had replaced Cocu as part of a four-man interim management team, would take sole control of the side for the upcoming match against Wycombe Wanderers and had removed himself from the playing squad,[266] admitting that it was \"possible\" he had played his final game.[267] On 15 January 2021, he retired from playing after being appointed permanent manager of Derby.[268]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of international goals scored by Wayne Rooney\n\n![](image)Rooney playing for England in 2006\n### Early international career and Euro 2004[edit]\n\n\nRooney was eligible to represent the Republic of Ireland, through his Irish paternal grandparents.[15][269] In 2015, he confirmed that he had rejected an approach from Ireland at the age of 16, describing himself as \"English through and through\".[270]\n\n\nRooney became the youngest player to play for England when he earned his first cap in a friendly defeat against Australia at the Boleyn Ground on 12 February 2003 at 17 years and 111 days, coming on at half-time as manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson fielded a different team in each half.[271] On 6 September of that year, aged 17 years and 317 days, he became the youngest player to score for England, equalising in a 2\u20131 away victory over Macedonia in a UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying match.[272]\n\n\nHis first tournament action was at UEFA Euro 2004, in which he became the youngest scorer in competition history on 17 June 2004, when he scored twice in England's second group match against Switzerland, which ended in a 3\u20130 victory;[273] however, this record was topped by Swiss midfielder Johan Vonlanthen four days later.[274] Rooney added two more goals in the competition in England's final group match on 21 June, a 4\u20132 win over Croatia,[275] but subsequently suffered an injury in the quarter-final match against hosts Portugal on 24 June, and England were eliminated on penalties.[276] After scoring four goals in four matches, Rooney was named in UEFA's Team of the Tournament.[277]\n\n\n\n### 2006 and 2010 World Cups[edit]\n\n\nFollowing a foot injury in an April 2006 Premier League match, Rooney faced a race to fitness for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.[278] England attempted to hasten his recovery with the use of an oxygen tent,[279] which allowed Rooney to enter a group match against Trinidad and Tobago[280] and start the next match against Sweden.[281] However, he never got back into game shape and went scoreless as England bowed out in the quarter-finals, again on penalty kicks.[282]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rooney training with England in September 2009\nRooney was red-carded in the 62nd minute of the quarter-final for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho as both attempted to gain possession of the ball. Rooney seemed to be pulled back by Carvalho, and then trod on his opponent's groin as the Chelsea defender was on the floor trying to win the ball, an incident that occurred right in front of the Argentine referee Horacio Elizondo.[283][284]\n\n\nPortugal winger (and Rooney's Manchester United teammate) Cristiano Ronaldo protested his actions, and was in turn pushed by Rooney.[284] Elizondo sent Rooney off, after which Ronaldo was seen winking at the Portugal bench.[284] Rooney denied intentionally targeting Carvalho in a statement on 3 July, adding,\n\n\n\n\n> I bear no ill feeling to Cristiano but I'm disappointed that he chose to get involved. I suppose I do, though, have to remember that on that particular occasion we were not teammates.[285]\n> \n> \n\n\nElizondo confirmed the next day that Rooney was dismissed solely for the infraction on Carvalho.[286] Rooney was fined CHF5,000 for the incident.[287]\n\n\nRooney top scored for England in their 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign with nine goals; one behind the UEFA section's overall top goalscorer, Theofanis Gekas of Greece.[288] On 14 November 2009, Rooney captained England for the first time in a pre-tournament friendly with Brazil.[289]\n\n\nRooney was given the England number 10 shirt by manager Fabio Capello ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.[290] During the tournament, England drew 0\u20130 in their second group match against Algeria on 18 June, and the England players were booed off the pitch by their supporters; Rooney was at the centre of controversy when he criticised the England fans for booing the team after the match,[291] and subsequently apologised for his actions.[292] Rooney went scoreless throughout the tournament, and England were eliminated in the second round, following a 4\u20131 defeat to Germany on 27 June.[293]\n\n\n\n### Euro 2012[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rooney taking on the Italian defence at UEFA Euro 2012\nThe Euro 2012 qualification campaign went well for England, as they qualified at the top of their group, winning five and drawing three games. Rooney scored three goals, one against Switzerland and two against Bulgaria. In the last qualifier against Montenegro (2\u20132), Rooney was sent off for a tackle on Miodrag D\u017eudovi\u0107 in the 74th minute.[294] It was anticipated that Rooney would miss at least one match in the opening round of the first phase at UEFA Euro 2012. After the game, Rooney sent a personal letter to UEFA in which he apologised and expressed regret for the tackle on D\u017eudovi\u0107 which earned him the red card.[295]\n\n\nDespite the letter, UEFA punished Rooney with a three-game ban, meaning that he could not play in any of the group stage matches. After UEFA's announcement, D\u017eudovi\u0107 stated that he believed the sentence for Rooney was too severe and that he would defend him if needed. He later asked the UEFA to pardon Rooney. The FA then decided they would appeal to UEFA against the ban. On 8 December 2011, after the FA had appealed the ban, UEFA reduced the sentence to two matches.[296] This meant that Rooney missed the matches against France and Sweden. He was able to play in the final match of the group stage against Ukraine on 19 June 2012, scoring the only goal of the game, allowing England to progress to the quarter-finals.[297] England were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals against Italy, who, after a scoreless 120 minutes, won 4\u20132 on penalties, although Rooney was able to net his spot-kick. After another international tournament in which the English media criticised Rooney's performances, Fabio Capello claimed Rooney \"only plays well in Manchester.\"[298]\n\n\n\n### 2014 World Cup[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rooney (number 10) playing for England against Uruguay at the 2014 FIFA World Cup\nOn 12 October 2012, Rooney became England's fifth-highest goalscorer of all time after scoring his 30th and 31st international goals in a 2014 World Cup qualifier against San Marino.

Rooney said,\n\n\n\n\n> Obviously the manager gives us our game plan, but because we don't spend that much time together as a team we need to know and feel confident in what we're doing as a team together. In the meetings, you're having the players speak up who wouldn't normally speak up when coaches are there.[310]\n> \n> \n\n\nOn 15 November 2014, Rooney won his 100th England cap against Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifying match, scoring a penalty to equalise in a 3\u20131 win.[311] In another qualifier away to the same opponents on 14 June 2015, Rooney scored the winner with four minutes remaining for a 3\u20132 victory, his 48th international goal putting him joint second in England's list alongside Gary Lineker, and one behind Bobby Charlton.[312] In his 106th England appearance, he equalled Charlton's record of 49 goals (also in 106 matches) on 5 September 2015 by scoring a penalty against San Marino.[313] On 8 September 2015, Rooney broke Charlton's England goalscoring record, netting his 50th international goal from a penalty in a Euro 2016 qualifying match against Switzerland, at Wembley, in his 107th appearance for England, also equalling Ashley Cole as his country's fifth-highest capped player;[314] this was also his 300th professional career goal.[315]\n\n\nIn England's opening match of UEFA Euro 2016 against Russia at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome in Marseille on 11 June, Rooney was selected to start in central midfield and was named man of the match by the BBC after a 1\u20131 draw.[316] On 27 June, he scored the opening goal against Iceland in the round of 16 from a penalty in the 4th minute. However England would eventually lose the match 2-1 which subsequently eliminated them from the tournament.[317]\n\n\n\n### 2018 World Cup qualification and retirement[edit]\n\n\nOn 4 September 2016, Rooney earned his 116th appearance for England in 1\u20130 away win over Slovakia in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, making him the nation's most-capped outfield player of all time, and England's second highest appearance maker behind Peter Shilton.[318] A few days earlier, he had confirmed that he would retire from international football after the finals in Russia.[319] In March 2017, Rooney had been left out of the England squad by England boss Gareth Southgate.[320] Following Rooney's return to Everton in July, which saw him put on a string of impressive performances, Southgate wanted to recall Rooney back to the England squad for the upcoming 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.[321] However, Rooney announced his early retirement from international football with immediate effect on 23 August 2017, snubbing Southgate's recall.[320][322]\n\n\nOn 4 November 2018, it was confirmed that Rooney would come out of international retirement to play one final match for the England national football team against the United States at Wembley Stadium on 15 November. This was in order to promote The Wayne Rooney Foundation, a newly formed charity;[323] consequently, the match was called the \"Wayne Rooney Foundation International\".[324] He came on in the 58th minute of England's eventual 3\u20130 home win, ending his international career with 120 appearances.[325]\n\n\n\n## Managerial career[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Rooney was announced as the manager for the England team at Soccer Aid 2020, assisted by Sam Allardyce and goalkeeper coach David Seaman.[326]\n\n\n\n### Derby County[edit]\n\n\nAfter a poor start to the 2020\u201321 season saw Derby County bottom of the Championship table \u2013 their lowest position for 12 years \u2013 Derby boss Phillip Cocu was sacked, and Rooney was appointed as part of a four-man interim coaching staff alongside Liam Rosenior, Shay Given and Justin Walker on 14 November 2020.[327] His debut a week later saw Derby lose 1\u20130 at Bristol City to leave them at the foot of the table and three points from safety, though Rooney said he could guarantee that the side would \"get better (and) get out of the situation we're in and... start winning games.\"[328] Following a \"painful and chastening\" 3\u20130 defeat to Middlesbrough it was announced that Rooney would take sole control of the side for the next match and had removed himself from the playing squad,[266] with Rooney making clear his desire to take the role full time.[267] Rooney started sole charge with The Rams in 24th, six points adrift of safety and on a run of four consecutive defeats; after improving Derby's form enough to get them out of the relegation zone he was appointed as permanent manager on 15 January.[268]\n\n\nBy mid-February 2021, having accrued 31 points from a possible 54 in his 18 games in sole charge, taking Derby up to 18th in the league and eight points clear of the relegation zone, Rooney was feted by the press for \"convincing the doubters\"[329] and found himself as 25/1 outsider for the Celtic job following the resignation of Neil Lennon.[330] Following this, however, form faltered badly with just one win from fourteen leaving Derby firmly in trouble,[331] with Rooney's side being criticised for their poor game management and sloppy defending[332] and suggestion that Rooney came across \"as a manager who\u2019s accepted defeat, who\u2019s surrender [*sic*] himself to whatever results might come his way\" and should be replaced.[331] Others defended Rooney, saying that though he had made mistakes, particularly in making \"too many changes to personnel and shape/tactics\" he had not been helped by injuries and too many players who had \"been inconsistent (and) unable to maintain form both during a game and from game to game.\"[333] However, at the last match of the season, Derby County drew 3\u20133 at home with Sheffield Wednesday to barely avoid relegation.[334]\n\n\nIncurring 21 points of deductions, Derby were relegated to League One at the end of the 2021\u201322 season, having spent almost the entire season in administration. With Derby still in administration going into the League One season, Rooney resigned as manager on 24 June 2022.[335][336]\n\n\n\n### D.C. United[edit]\n\n\nOn 12 July 2022, Rooney was announced as head coach for his former club, MLS side D.C. United.[337] He replaced outgoing manager Hern\u00e1n Losada, on a contract to the end of the 2023 season.[338]\n\n\nRooney won 2\u20131 at home to Orlando City on his debut on 31 July 2022,[339] and picked up 9 points from the 14 last games of the season as his team ranked last in the Eastern Conference.[340][341]\n\n\nAt the end of the 2023 regular season, on 8 October, Rooney and the club agreed to mutually part ways, after United failed to qualify for the playoffs for a second straight season.[342]\n\n\n\n### Birmingham City[edit]\n\n\nOn 11 October 2023, Rooney made his return to English football as he was appointed manager of EFL Championship club Birmingham City of a three-and-a-half year contract.[343] On his debut ten days later, he lost 1\u20130 at Middlesbrough, managed by his former United and England teammate Michael Carrick.[344]\n\n\n\n## Style of play[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rooney pictured with Manchester United in 2016. Highly regarded for his technical ability, link-up play and goalscoring, Rooney was also praised for his teamwork and commitment.\nRegarded as one of the best players of his generation,[345][346] Rooney was a creative, energetic forward who combined technical skill with strength and physicality, while also excelling in the air despite being 5\u00a0feet 9\u00a0inches (1.76\u00a0m) tall.[347][348] He was a versatile attacker, capable of playing anywhere along the front line;[349][350] although his preferred role was as a striker.[351] Rooney was also used as a supporting forward, or even as a winger.[352][353][354] As his pace and movement declined as he entered his thirties, he was deployed in deeper, more creative roles, as an attacking midfielder, as a deep-lying playmaker, or even as a central or box-to-box midfielder, in particular under former manager Louis van Gaal, due to his vision, range of passing, runs forward from midfield, and team-work.[355][356][357] He was also occasionally deployed as a false attacking midfielder,[358] and as a false 9 throughout his career.[359]\n\n\nA prolific goalscorer in his prime at Manchester United, Rooney was a powerful striker of the ball and an accurate finisher, capable of scoring both inside and outside the penalty area, as well as from volleys.[360][361] His ball striking ability saw him score from inside his own half for Manchester United, Everton, and D.C. United.[362] He was praised for his work-rate and stamina by players, managers and the media, and was highly regarded for his dedication and willingness to press opponents when possession had been lost in order to win back the ball and start attacking plays.[360][345] While not known to be particularly prolific from free kicks, he also often took set pieces[363][364][365] and penalties throughout his career,[366][367] although his record from the spot was somewhat inconsistent.[368]\n\n\nDue to his precocious displays as a teenager, Wayne Rooney was given the nicknames \"Wazza\" (a reference to former England international Paul \"Gazza\" Gascoigne, who was also a gifted player troubled by off-field issues),[369] \"The Wonder Boy\", \"the new Pel\u00e9\", and \"the white Pel\u00e9\".[370][371] Rooney was a fast, agile player in his youth;[372] however, several injuries throughout his career, in addition to weight issues, affected his speed and mobility as his career progressed, which led to some in the game accusing him of not quite living up to his full potential.[373][374] He was warned about his fitness on numerous occasions by his manager Alex Ferguson, who said of Rooney, \"He is very stocky, he is going to have to train well all the time.\"[375] Former Manchester United fitness coach Mick Clegg, stated, \"Wayne didn't see the importance of the gym really. He'd say 'I'm here to play football.\"[376] Rooney was criticised for his behaviour and aggression on the pitch at times, which led him to pick up unnecessary bookings.[360][369]\n\n\nFormerly the all-time leading goalscorer for the England national team, Rooney is viewed as one of England's greatest players.[377] In 2017, Gareth Southgate said: \"You've got very good players and then there are top players. In my time in the England setup, Paul Gascoigne, Paul Scholes and Rooney just had that little bit more than all the others. And we are talking high\u2011level people there, players like Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and David Beckham.\"[378]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to Everton, Rooney also supports Celtic.[379] He is also a supporter of the Leeds Rhinos rugby league club.[380] Rooney, originally a boxer, still pursues the sport recreationally for stress relief.[381] A friend of boxer Ricky Hatton, in 2007 he carried one of Hatton's belts into the ring in his world light-welterweight title fight against Jos\u00e9 Luis Castillo in Las Vegas.[382] The decision of Hatton (a Manchester City fan) to have a Manchester United striker carry the belt prompted threats of a boycott among the many Manchester City supporters who made up Hatton's fanbase.[382] Hatton responded, \"Nobody hates United more than me. Just because I don't support his team doesn't mean I can't admire what he has done.\"[382] Rooney has a number of tattoos, including one of a Celtic cross on his arm.[383]\n\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rooney's wife, Coleen, in October 2006\nRooney met his wife, Coleen (n\u00e9e McLoughlin), while both were at secondary school.[384] They married on 12 June 2008 after six years of dating.[385] He has a tattoo of the words \"Just Enough Education to Perform\", the title of an album by his favourite band, the Stereophonics; Coleen arranged for the group to play at their wedding reception.[386] The wedding ran into some controversy with the Catholic Church. The couple held a religious ceremony at the Abbey of Cervara, a converted monastery near Genoa, despite being warned by the local bishop's office against the plan. The bishop's office told the Rooneys that La Cervara is deconsecrated and not suitable for a wedding. It suggested a different church, five miles away. Nevertheless, the couple ignored the advice and Father Edward Quinn, their local Catholic priest from Croxteth, presided over the ceremony.[387] Coleen's favourite pop band Westlife also sang at the wedding reception.[388]\n\n\nThe couple have four sons: Kai Wayne (born 2 November 2009),[389] Klay Anthony (born 21 May 2013),[390] Kit Joseph (born 24 January 2016),[391] and Cass Mac (born 15 February 2018).[392] Kai Rooney signed with Manchester United in 2020, becoming a second-generation player for the Red Devils.[393]\n\n\nIn 2004, Rooney admitted to soliciting prostitutes in Liverpool, while dating his then-girlfriend. \"I was young and stupid. It was at a time when I was very young and immature and before I had settled down with Coleen.\"[394] In April 2006, Rooney was awarded \u00a3100,000 in libel damages from tabloids *The Sun* and *News of the World*, who had claimed that he had assaulted Coleen in a nightclub. Rooney donated the money to charity.[395]\n\n\nRooney's younger brother, John Rooney, is also a professional footballer who plays for Macclesfield. Rooney's cousin, Tommy Rooney, played for Macclesfield Town in 2004.[396] Another cousin, Jake Rooney, is also a professional footballer for Derby County.[397]\n\n\n\n### Commercial interests[edit]\n\n\nRooney has endorsement deals with Nike (he is the face of their T90 Laser IV boots[398]), Nokia,[399] Ford,[400][401] Asda,[402] and Coca-Cola.[403] He appeared on seven consecutive UK-version covers of Electronic Arts' *FIFA* video game series from *FIFA 06* to *FIFA 12*.[404][405][406] His \"knockout\" goal celebration \u2013 a tongue in cheek celebration by Rooney inspired by getting knocked down by a teammate in his home \u2013 appears in *FIFA 18*.[407] He has featured in Nike commercials, including Write the Future directed by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu in 2010 where he is knighted, and a tabloid shows his face carved into the Cliffs of Dover with the headline \"JUST ROO IT!\".[408] In October 2010, Rooney was dropped by Coca-Cola from an advertising campaign following issues surrounding his private life.[409] In 2012, Rooney's reported income of US$32.6\u00a0million listed him as the world's fifth highest-paid footballer, following Lionel Messi, David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Samuel Eto'o.[410]\n\n\nIn July 2011, jerseys with Rooney's name and number (Rooney, 10) were the best-selling sports product under the auspices of the Premier League \u2013 taking over top spot from Liverpool striker Fernando Torres (Torres, 9) and becoming the first United player to top the list since Cristiano Ronaldo's number 7 jersey in 2008.[411] During the 2009\u201310 season, Manchester United sold between 1.2\u00a0million and 1.5\u00a0million shirts and it is estimated that of that, Rooney's name was printed on several hundred thousand. The account is taken from official jerseys sales across the globe, not just in England.[411]\n\n\nOn 9 March 2006, Rooney signed the largest sports book deal in publishing history with HarperCollins,[412] who granted him a \u00a35\u00a0million advance plus royalties for a minimum of five books to be published over a 12-year period. The first, *My Story So Far*, an autobiography ghostwritten by Hunter Davies, was published after the 2006 World Cup.[413] The second publication, *The Official Wayne Rooney Annual*, was aimed at the teenage market and edited by football journalist Chris Hunt.[414] His third book, *My Decade in the Premier League*, was published in September 2012.[415]\n\n\nIn July 2006, Rooney's lawyers went to the United Nations' World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to gain ownership of the Internet domain names waynerooney.com and waynerooney.co.uk, both of which Welsh actor Huw Marshall registered in 2002.[416] Three months later, the WIPO awarded Rooney the rights to *waynerooney.com.*[417]\n\n\n\n### Social media[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2014, Rooney became the first Premier League footballer to reach 10\u00a0million followers on social networking site Twitter. That same month, Rooney was the fifth most-followed footballer (and sixth most-followed sportsperson) globally on Twitter. In terms of top UK Twitter individuals, Rooney ranked at number 9 in October 2014.[418]\n\n\n\n### Paul Stretford controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2002, while Rooney was with Everton, agent Paul Stretford encouraged Rooney and his parents to enter the player into an eight-year contract with Proactive Sports Management. However, Rooney was already with another representation firm at the time, while Stretford's transaction went unreported to the FA, and he was thus charged with improper conduct. Stretford alleged in his October 2004 trial that he had secretly recorded boxing promoter John Hyland and two other men threatening and attempting to blackmail him for an undisclosed percentage of Rooney's earnings.[419]\n\n\nStretford's case collapsed due to evidence that conflicted with his insistence that he had not signed Rooney, and on 9 July 2008, he was found guilty of \"making of false and/or misleading witness statements to police, and giving false and/or misleading testimony\".[419] In addition, the contract to which Stretford had signed Rooney was two years longer than the limit allowed by the FA. Stretford was fined \u00a3300,000 and given an 18-month ban as a football agent, a verdict he appealed.[419]\n\n\nStretford left Proactive in 2008 and took Rooney with him. Proactive later sued Rooney, claiming \u00a34.3\u00a0million in withheld commissions. In July 2010, Proactive was awarded \u00a390,000 as restitution.[420]\n\n\n\n### David Moyes[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 September 2006, then-Everton manager David Moyes sued Rooney for libel after the tabloid newspaper the *Daily Mail* published excerpts from Rooney's 2006 autobiography that accused the manager of leaking Rooney's reasons for leaving the club to the press.[421] The case was settled out of court for \u00a3500,000 on 3 June 2008, and Rooney apologised to Moyes for \"false claims\" he had made in the book regarding the matter.[422]\n\n\n\n### Allegations of infidelity[edit]\n\n\nHelen Wood claims Rooney paid \u00a31,000 for a threesome with her and Jennifer Thompson in a Manchester hotel while his wife was five months pregnant.[423] It was reported his solicitors unsuccessfully tried to fight the allegations when they first surfaced in early August 2010.[424][425]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\n#### Drink-driving conviction[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 September 2017, Rooney was arrested in Wilmslow by Cheshire police after being caught driving over the prescribed alcohol limit.[426][427] He appeared at Stockport Magistrates' Court on 18 September and pleaded guilty to drink driving.[428] Rooney was fined \u00a3170 by the court and banned from driving for two years, and was ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid work as part of a twelve-month community order; Everton fined him two weeks' wages, which was in the region of \u00a3300,000.[428]\n\n\n\n#### Intoxication and profanity arrest[edit]\n\n\nOn 16 December 2018, Rooney was arrested at Washington Dulles International Airport in Loudoun County, Virginia, charged with public intoxication and use of profanity in public.

The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played its home games at Anfield since its formation. \n\n\nDomestically, the club has won 19 league titles, eight FA Cups, a record nine League Cups and 16 FA Community Shields. In international competitions, the club has won six European Cups, three UEFA Cups, four UEFA Super Cups\u2014all English records\u2014and one FIFA Club World Cup. The club established itself as a major force in domestic and European football in the 1970s and 1980s, when Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish, led the club to a combined 11 League titles and four European Cups. Liverpool won two further European Cups in 2005 and 2019 under the management of Rafael Ben\u00edtez and J\u00fcrgen Klopp, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a 19th league title in 2020, the club's first during the Premier League era.\n\n\nLiverpool is one of the most valuable and widely supported clubs in the world. The club has long-standing rivalries with Manchester United and Everton. Under management by Shankly, in 1964 the team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip which has been used ever since. The club's anthem is \"You'll Never Walk Alone\".\n\n\nThe club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies. The Heysel Stadium disaster, where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the 1985 European Cup Final in Brussels, resulted in 39 deaths. Most of these were Italians and Juventus fans. Liverpool were given a six-year ban from European competition, and all other English clubs received a five-year ban. The Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 97 Liverpool supporters died in a crush against perimeter fencing, led to the elimination of fenced standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadiums in the top two tiers of English football. Prolonged campaigning for justice saw further coroners inquests, commissions and independent panels that ultimately exonerated the fans.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 1892\u20131959, 1959\u201385, and 1985\u2013present\n\n![Black and white photograph of elder and bald John Houlding, wearing beard and bow tie.](image)John Houlding, the founder of Liverpool F.C.\nLiverpool F.C. was founded following a dispute between the Everton committee and John Houlding, club president and owner of the land at Anfield. After eight years at the stadium, Everton relocated to Goodison Park in 1892 and Houlding founded Liverpool F.C. to play at Anfield.[3] Originally named \"Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd\" (Everton Athletic for short), the club became Liverpool F.C. in March 1892 and gained official recognition three months later, after The Football Association refused to recognise the club as Everton.[4]\n\n\nLiverpool played their first match on 1 September 1892, a pre-season friendly match against Rotherham Town, which they won 7\u20131. The team Liverpool fielded against Rotherham was composed entirely of Scottish players\u2014the players who came from Scotland to play in England in those days were known as the Scotch Professors. Manager John McKenna had recruited the players after a scouting trip to Scotland\u2014so they became known as the \"team of Macs\".[5] The team won the Lancashire League in its debut season and joined the Football League Second Division at the start of the 1893\u201394 season. After the club was promoted to the First Division in 1896, Tom Watson was appointed manager. He led Liverpool to its first league title in 1901, before winning it again in 1906.[6]\n\n\nLiverpool reached its first FA Cup Final in 1914, losing 1\u20130 to Burnley. It won consecutive League championships in 1922 and 1923, but did not win another trophy until the 1946\u201347 season, when the club won the First Division for a fifth time under the control of ex-West Ham United centre half George Kay.[7] Liverpool suffered its second Cup Final defeat in 1950, playing against Arsenal.[8] The club was relegated to the Second Division in the 1953\u201354 season.[9] Soon after Liverpool lost 2\u20131 to non-league Worcester City in the 1958\u201359 FA Cup, Bill Shankly was appointed manager. Upon his arrival he released 24\u00a0players and converted a boot storage room at Anfield into a room where the coaches could discuss strategy; here, Shankly and other \"Boot Room\" members Joe Fagan, Reuben Bennett, and Bob Paisley began reshaping the team.[10]\n\n\n\n![Statue of a man with his arms held aloft](image)Statue of Bill Shankly outside Anfield. Shankly won promotion to the First Division and the club's first league title since 1947.\nThe club was promoted back into the First Division in 1962 and won it in 1964, for the first time in 17 years. In 1965, the club won its first FA Cup. In 1966, the club won the First Division but lost to Borussia Dortmund in the European Cup Winners' Cup final.[11] Liverpool won both the League and the UEFA Cup during the 1972\u201373 season, and the FA Cup again a year later. Shankly retired soon afterwards and was replaced by his assistant, Bob Paisley.[12] In 1976, Paisley's second season as manager, the club won another League and UEFA Cup double. The following season, the club retained the League title and won the European Cup for the first time, but it lost in the 1977 FA Cup Final. Liverpool retained the European Cup in 1978 and regained the First Division title in 1979.[13] During Paisley's nine seasons as manager Liverpool won 20 trophies, including three European Cups, a UEFA Cup, six League titles and three consecutive League Cups; the only domestic trophy he did not win was the FA Cup.[14]\n\n\nPaisley retired in 1983 and was replaced by his assistant, Joe Fagan.[15] Liverpool won the League, League Cup and European Cup in Fagan's first season, becoming the first English side to win three trophies in a season.[16] Liverpool reached the European Cup final again in 1985, against Juventus at the Heysel Stadium. Before kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence that separated the two groups of supporters and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 fans, mostly Italians. The incident became known as the Heysel Stadium disaster. The match was played in spite of protests by both managers, and Liverpool lost 1\u20130 to Juventus. As a result of the tragedy, English clubs were banned from participating in European competition for five years; Liverpool received a ten-year ban, which was later reduced to six years. Fourteen Liverpool fans received convictions for involuntary manslaughter.[17]\n\n\n\n![3 burgundy tablets with gold engraved writing. Below the tablets are flowers.](image)The Hillsborough memorial, which is engraved with the names of the 97 people who died in the Hillsborough disaster\nFagan had announced his retirement just before the disaster and Kenny Dalglish was appointed as player-manager.[18] During his tenure, the club won another three league titles and two FA Cups, including a League and Cup \"Double\" in the 1985\u201386 season. Liverpool's success was overshadowed by the Hillsborough disaster: in an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989, hundreds of Liverpool fans were crushed against perimeter fencing.[19] Ninety-four fans died that day; the 95th victim died in hospital from his injuries four days later, the 96th died nearly four years later, without regaining consciousness, and the 97th, Andrew Devine, died of injuries sustained in the disaster in 2021.[20][21] After the Hillsborough disaster there was a government review of stadium safety. The resulting Taylor Report paved the way for legislation that required top-division teams to have all-seater stadiums. The report ruled that the main reason for the disaster was overcrowding due to a failure of police control.[22]\n\n\nLiverpool was involved in the closest finish to a league season during the 1988\u201389 season. Liverpool finished equal with Arsenal on both points and goal difference, but lost the title on total goals scored when Arsenal scored the final goal in the last minute of the season.[23]\n\n\nDalglish cited the Hillsborough disaster and its repercussions as the reason for his resignation in 1991; he was replaced by former player Graeme Souness.[24] Under his leadership Liverpool won the 1992 FA Cup Final, but their league performances slumped, with two consecutive sixth-place finishes, eventually resulting in his dismissal in January 1994. Souness was replaced by Roy Evans, and Liverpool went on to win the 1995 Football League Cup Final.[25] While they made some title challenges under Evans, third-place finishes in 1996 and 1998 were the best they could manage, and so G\u00e9rard Houllier was appointed co-manager in the 1998\u201399 season, and became the sole manager in November 1998 after Evans resigned.[26] In 2001, Houllier's second full season in charge, Liverpool won a \"treble\": the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup.[27] Houllier underwent major heart surgery during the 2001\u201302 season and Liverpool finished second in the League, behind Arsenal.[28] They won a further League Cup in 2003, but failed to mount a title challenge in the two seasons that followed.[29][30]\n\n\n\n![A silver trophy with red ribbons on it](image)The European Cup, trophy won by Liverpool for a fifth time in 2005\nHoullier was replaced by Rafael Ben\u00edtez at the end of the 2003\u201304 season. Despite finishing fifth in Ben\u00edtez's first season, Liverpool won the 2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League, beating A.C. Milan 3\u20132 in a penalty shootout after the match ended with a score of 3\u20133.[31] The following season, Liverpool finished third in the Premier League and won the 2006 FA Cup Final, beating West Ham United in a penalty shootout after the match finished 3\u20133.[32] American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks became the owners of the club during the 2006\u201307 season, in a deal which valued the club and its outstanding debts at \u00a3218.9\u00a0million.[33] The club reached the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final against Milan, as it had in 2005, but lost 2\u20131.[34] During the 2008\u201309 season Liverpool achieved 86 points, its then-highest Premier League points total, prior to the record-breaking 2018\u201319 season, and finished as runners up to Manchester United.[35]\n\n\nIn the 2009\u201310 season, Liverpool finished seventh in the Premier League and failed to qualify for the Champions League. Ben\u00edtez subsequently left by mutual consent[36] and was replaced by Fulham manager Roy Hodgson.[37] At the start of the 2010\u201311 season Liverpool was on the verge of bankruptcy and the club's creditors asked the High Court to allow the sale of the club, overruling the wishes of Hicks and Gillett. John W. Henry, owner of the Boston Red Sox and of Fenway Sports Group, bid successfully for the club and took ownership in October 2010.[38] Poor results during the start of that season led to Hodgson leaving the club by mutual consent and former player and manager Kenny Dalglish taking over.[39] In the 2011\u201312 season, Liverpool secured a record 8th League Cup success and reached the FA Cup final, but finished in eighth position, the worst league finish in 18 years; this led to the sacking of Dalglish.[40][41] He was replaced by Brendan Rodgers,[42] whose Liverpool team in the 2013\u201314 season mounted an unexpected title charge to finish second behind champions Manchester City and subsequently return to the Champions League, scoring 101 goals in the process, the most since the 106 scored in the 1895\u201396 season.[43][44] Following a disappointing 2014\u201315 season, where Liverpool finished sixth in the league, and a poor start to the following campaign, Rodgers was sacked in October 2015.[45]\n\n\nRodgers was replaced by J\u00fcrgen Klopp.[46] Liverpool reached the finals of the Football League Cup and UEFA Europa League in Klopp's first season, finishing as runner-up in both competitions.[47] The club finished second in the 2018\u201319 season with 97 points (surpassing the 86 points gained during the 2008\u201309 season), losing only one game: a points record for a non-title winning side.[48] Klopp took Liverpool to successive Champions League finals in 2018 and 2019, with the club defeating Tottenham Hotspur 2\u20130 to win the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final.[49][50] Liverpool beat Flamengo of Brazil in the final 1\u20130 to win the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time.[51] Liverpool then went on to win the 2019\u201320 Premier League, winning their first top-flight league title in thirty years.[52] The club set multiple records in the season, including winning the league with seven games remaining making it the earliest any team has ever won the title,[53] amassing a club record 99 points, and achieving a joint-record 32 wins in a top-flight season.[54]\n\n\n\n## Colours and badge[edit]\n\n\n![A blue and white shirt and white shorts](image)Liverpool's home colours worn from 1892 to 1896[55]\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Liverpool F.C. kits.\n\nFor much of Liverpool's history, its home colours have been all red. When the club was founded in 1892, blue and white quartered shirts were used until the club adopted the city's colour of red in 1896.[3] The city's symbol of the liver bird was adopted as the club's badge (or crest, as it is sometimes known) in 1901, although it was not incorporated into the kit until 1955. Liverpool continued to wear red shirts and white shorts until 1964 when manager Bill Shankly decided to change to an all-red strip.[55] Liverpool played in all red for the first time against Anderlecht, as Ian St John recalled in his autobiography:\n\n\n\n\n> He [Shankly] thought the colour scheme would carry psychological impact \u2013 red for danger, red for power. He came into the dressing room one day and threw a pair of red shorts to Ronnie Yeats. \"Get into those shorts and let's see how you look\", he said. \"Christ, Ronnie, you look awesome, terrifying. You look 7 ft tall.\" \"Why not go the whole hog, boss?\" I suggested. \"Why not wear red socks? Let's go out all in red.\" Shankly approved and an iconic kit was born.[56]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Liverpool away strip has more often than not been all yellow or white shirts and black shorts, but there have been several exceptions. An all grey kit was introduced in 1987, which was used until the 1991\u201392 centenary season when it was replaced by a combination of green shirts and white shorts. After various colour combinations in the 1990s, including gold and navy, bright yellow, black and grey, and ecru, the club alternated between yellow and white away kits until the 2008\u201309 season, when it re-introduced the grey kit. A third kit is designed for European away matches, though it is also worn in domestic away matches on occasions when the current away kit clashes with a team's home kit. Between 2012 and 2015, the kits were designed by Warrior Sports, who became the club's kit providers at the start of the 2012\u201313 season.[57] In February 2015, Warrior's parent company New Balance announced it would be entering the global football market, with teams sponsored by Warrior now being outfitted by New Balance.[58] The only other branded shirts worn by the club were made by Umbro until 1985, when they were replaced by Adidas, who produced the kits until 1996 when Reebok took over. They produced the kits for 10 years before Adidas made the kits from 2006 to 2012.[59] Nike became the club's official kit supplier at the start of the 2020\u201321 season.[60]\n\n\n\n![](image)A version of Liverpool's badge as depicted on the Shankly Gates\nLiverpool was the first English professional club to have a sponsor's logo on its shirts, after agreeing a deal with Hitachi in 1979.[61] Since then the club has been sponsored by Crown Paints, Candy, Carlsberg and Standard Chartered. The contract with Carlsberg, which was signed in 1992, was the longest-lasting agreement in English top-flight football.[62] The association with Carlsberg ended at the start of the 2010\u201311 season, when Standard Chartered Bank became the club's sponsor.[63]\n\n\nThe Liverpool badge is based on the city's liver bird symbol, which in the past had been placed inside a shield. In 1977, a red liver bird standing on a football (blazoned as \"*Statant upon a football a Liver Bird wings elevated and addorsed holding in the beak a piece of seaweed gules*\") was granted as a heraldic badge by the College of Arms to the English Football League intended for use by Liverpool. However, Liverpool never made use of this badge.[64] In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, including a representation of the Shankly Gates. The next year twin flames were added at either side, symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an eternal flame burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster.[65] In 2012, Warrior Sports' first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates, returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for the number who died at Hillsborough.[66]\n\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Period\n | Brand\n | Shirt Sponsor (chest) | Shirt Sponsor (sleeve) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1973\u20131979\n | Umbro | None\n | None\n |\n| 1979\u20131982\n | Hitachi |\n| 1982\u20131985\n | Crown Paints |\n| 1985\u20131988\n | Adidas |\n| 1988\u20131992\n | Candy |\n| 1992\u20131996\n | Carlsberg |\n| 1996\u20132006\n | Reebok |\n| 2006\u20132010\n | Adidas |\n| 2010\u20132012\n | Standard Chartered |\n| 2012\u20132015\n | Warrior |\n| 2015\u20132017\n | New Balance |\n| 2017\u20132020\n | Western Union |\n| 2020\u2013\n | Nike | Expedia |\n\n\n## Stadium[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Anfield\n\nFor information on Liverpool's abandoned proposed new stadium, see Stanley Park Stadium.\n\n![The interior of a stadium.](image)Anfield, home of Liverpool F.C.\nAnfield was built in 1884 on land adjacent to Stanley Park.\nSituated 2 miles (3\u00a0km) from Liverpool city centre, it was originally used by Everton before the club moved to Goodison Park after a dispute over rent with Anfield owner John Houlding.[67] Left with an empty ground, Houlding founded Liverpool in 1892 and the club has played at Anfield ever since. The capacity of the stadium at the time was 20,000, although only 100 spectators attended Liverpool's first match at Anfield.[68]\n\n\nThe Kop was built in 1906 due to the high turnout for matches and was called the Oakfield Road Embankment initially. Its first game was on 1 September 1906 when the home side beat Stoke City 1\u20130.[69] In 1906 the banked stand at one end of the ground was formally renamed the Spion Kop after a hill in KwaZulu-Natal.[70] The hill was the site of the Battle of Spion Kop in the Second Boer War, where over 300 men of the Lancashire Regiment died, many of them from Liverpool.[71] At its peak, the stand could hold 28,000 spectators and was one of the largest single-tier stands in the world. Many stadiums in England had stands named after Spion Kop, but Anfield's was the largest of them at the time; it could hold more supporters than some entire football grounds.[72]\n\n\nAnfield could accommodate more than 60,000 supporters at its peak and had a capacity of 55,000 until the 1990s, when, following recommendations from the *Taylor Report*, all clubs in the Premier League were obliged to convert to all-seater stadiums in time for the 1993\u201394 season, reducing its capacity to 45,276.[73] The findings of the report precipitated the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand, which was rebuilt in 1992, coinciding with the centenary of the club, and was known as the Centenary Stand until 2017 when it was renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand. An extra tier was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998, which further increased the capacity of the ground but gave rise to problems when it was opened. A series of support poles and stanchions were inserted to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand after movement of the tier was reported at the start of the 1999\u20132000 season.[74]\n\n\nBecause of restrictions on expanding the capacity at Anfield, Liverpool announced plans to move to the proposed Stanley Park Stadium in May 2002.[75] Planning permission was granted in July 2004,[76] and in September 2006, Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool a 999-year lease on the proposed site.[77] Following the takeover of the club by George Gillett and Tom Hicks in February 2007, the proposed stadium was redesigned. The new design was approved by the Council in November 2007. The stadium was scheduled to open in August 2011 and would hold 60,000 spectators, with HKS, Inc. contracted to build the stadium.[78] Construction was halted in August 2008, as Gillett and Hicks had difficulty in financing the \u00a3300\u00a0million needed for the development.[79] In October 2012, BBC Sport reported that Fenway Sports Group, the new owners of Liverpool FC, had decided to redevelop their current home at Anfield stadium, rather than building a new stadium in Stanley Park. As part of the redevelopment the capacity of Anfield was to increase from 45,276 to approximately 60,000 and would cost approximately \u00a3150m.[80] When construction was completed on the new Main stand the capacity of Anfield was increased to 54,074. This \u00a3100\u00a0million expansion added a third tier to the stand. This was all part of a \u00a3260\u00a0million project to improve the Anfield area. J\u00fcrgen Klopp the manager at the time described the stand as \"impressive.\"[81]\n\n\nIn June 2021, it was reported that Liverpool Council had given planning permission for the club to renovate and expand the Anfield Road stand, boosting the capacity by around 7,000 and taking the overall capacity at Anfield to 61,000. The expansion, which is estimated to cost \u00a360m, was described as \"a huge milestone\" by managing director Andy Hughes, and would also see rail seating being trialled in the Kop for the 2021\u201322 Premier League season.[82]\n\n\n\n## Support[edit]\n\n\n![A single-tiered stand that contains thousands of people. Several flags are being waved. In front of the stand is a grass pitch with a goal.](image)*Kopites* in The Kop Stand\nLiverpool is one of the best supported clubs in the world.[83][84] The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200\u00a0officially recognised Supporters Clubs in at least 50 countries. Notable groups include Spirit of Shankly.[85] The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours,[86] which has included playing in front of 101,000 in Michigan, U.S., and 95,000 in Melbourne, Australia.[87][88] Liverpool fans often refer to themselves as Kopites, a reference to the fans who once stood, and now sit, on the Kop at Anfield.[89] In 2008 a group of fans decided to form a splinter club, A.F.C. Liverpool, to play matches for fans who had been priced out of watching Premier League football.[90]\n\n\nThe song \"You'll Never Walk Alone\", originally from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical *Carousel* and later recorded by Liverpool musicians Gerry and the Pacemakers, is the club's anthem and has been sung by the Anfield crowd since the early 1960s.[91] It has since gained popularity among fans of other clubs around the world.[92] The song's title adorns the top of the Shankly Gates, which were unveiled on 2 August 1982 in memory of former manager Bill Shankly. The \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" portion of the Shankly Gates is also reproduced on the club's badge.[93]\n\n\n\n![Design of the top of a set of gates, with the sky visible. The inscription on the gates reads \"You'll Never Walk Alone\".](image)The Shankly Gates, erected in honour of former manager Bill Shankly\nThe club's supporters have been involved in two stadium disasters. The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, in which 39 people, mostly Italians and Juventus supporters, were killed. They were confined to a corner by Liverpool fans who had charged in their direction; the weight of the cornered fans caused a wall to collapse. UEFA laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool supporters,[94] and banned all English clubs from European competition for five years. Liverpool was banned for an additional year, preventing it from participating in the 1990\u201391 European Cup, even though it won the League in 1990.[95] Twenty-seven fans were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and were extradited to Belgium in 1987 to face trial.[96] In 1989, after a five-month trial in Belgium, 14\u00a0Liverpool fans were given three-year sentences for involuntary manslaughter;[97] half of the terms were suspended.[98]\n\n\nThe second disaster took place during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on 15 April 1989. Ninety-seven Liverpool fans died as a consequence of overcrowding at the Leppings Lane end, in what became known as the Hillsborough disaster. In the following days, *The Sun*'s coverage of the event spread falsehoods, particularly an article entitled \"The Truth\" that claimed that Liverpool fans had robbed the dead and had urinated on and attacked the police.[99] Subsequent investigations proved the allegations false, leading to a boycott of the newspaper by Liverpool fans across the city and elsewhere; many still refuse to buy *The Sun* 30\u00a0years later.[100] Many support organisations were set up in the wake of the disaster, such as the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, which represents bereaved families, survivors and supporters in their efforts to secure justice.[101]\n\n\n\n### Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Merseyside derby and Liverpool F.C.\u2013Manchester United F.C. rivalry\n\n![](image)Liverpool players (in grey) during their 4\u20131 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 14 March 2009\nLiverpool's longest-established rivalry is with fellow Liverpool team Everton, against whom they contest the Merseyside derby. The rivalry stems from Liverpool's formation and the dispute with Everton officials and the then owners of Anfield.[102] The Merseyside derby is one of the few local derbies which do not enforce fan segregation, and hence has been known as the \"friendly derby\".[103] Since the mid-1980s, the rivalry has intensified both on and off the field and, since the inception of the Premier League in 1992, the Merseyside derby has had more players sent off than any other Premier League game. It has been referred to as \"the most ill-disciplined and explosive fixture in the Premier League\".[104] In terms of support within the city, the number of Liverpool fans outweighs Everton supporters by a ratio of 2:1.[105]\n\n\nLiverpool's rivalry with Manchester United stems from the cities' competition in the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century.[106] Connected by the world's first inter-city railway, by road Liverpool and Manchester are separated by approximately 30 miles (48\u00a0km) along the East Lancs Road.[107] Ranked the two biggest clubs in England by *France Football* magazine, Liverpool and Manchester United are the most successful English teams in both domestic and international competitions, and both clubs have a global fanbase.[108][109] Viewed as one of the biggest rivalries in world football, it is considered the most famous fixture in English football.[110][111][112] The two clubs alternated as champions between 1964 and 1967,[113] and Manchester United became the first English team to win the European Cup in 1968, followed by Liverpool's four European Cup victories.[114] Despite the 39 league titles and nine European Cups between them[113] the two rivals have rarely been successful at the same time\u00a0\u2013 Liverpool's run of titles in the 1970s and 1980s coincided with Manchester United's 26-year title drought, and United's success in the Premier League-era likewise coincided with Liverpool's 30-year title drought,[115] and the two clubs have finished first and second in the league only five times.[113] Such is the rivalry between the clubs they rarely do transfer business with each other. The last player to be transferred between the two clubs was Phil Chisnall, who moved to Liverpool from Manchester United in 1964.[116]\n\n\n\n## Ownership and finances[edit]\n\n\nAs the owner of Anfield and founder of Liverpool, John Houlding was the club's first chairman, a position he held from its founding in 1892 until 1904. John McKenna took over as chairman after Houlding's departure.[117] McKenna subsequently became President of the Football League.[118] The chairmanship changed hands many times before John Smith, whose father was a shareholder of the club, took up the role in 1973. He oversaw the most successful period in Liverpool's history before stepping down in 1990.[119] His successor was Noel White who became chairman in 1990.[120] In August 1991 David Moores, whose family had owned the club for more than 50 years, became chairman. His uncle John Moores was also a shareholder at Liverpool and was chairman of Everton from 1961 to 1973. Moores owned 51\u00a0percent of the club, and in 2004 expressed his willingness to consider a bid for his shares in Liverpool.[121]\n\n\nMoores eventually sold the club to American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks on 6 February 2007. The deal valued the club and its outstanding debts at \u00a3218.9\u00a0million. The pair paid \u00a35,000\u00a0per share, or \u00a3174.1m for the total shareholding and \u00a344.8m to cover the club's debts.[122] Disagreements between Gillett and Hicks, and the fans' lack of support for them, resulted in the pair looking to sell the club.[123] Martin Broughton was appointed chairman of the club on 16 April 2010 to oversee its sale.[124] In May 2010, accounts were released showing the holding company of the club to be \u00a3350m in debt (due to leveraged takeover) with losses of \u00a355m, causing auditor KPMG to qualify its audit opinion.[125] The group's creditors, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, took Gillett and Hicks to court to force them to allow the board to proceed with the sale of the club, the major asset of the holding company. A High Court judge, Mr Justice Floyd, ruled in favour of the creditors and paved the way for the sale of the club to Fenway Sports Group (formerly New England Sports Ventures), although Gillett and Hicks still had the option to appeal.[126] Liverpool was sold to Fenway Sports Group on 15 October 2010 for \u00a3300m.[127]\n\n\nLiverpool has been described as a global brand; a 2010 report valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at \u00a3141m, an increase of \u00a35m on the previous year. Liverpool was given a brand rating of AA (Very Strong).[128] In April 2010 business magazine *Forbes* ranked Liverpool as the sixth most valuable football team in the world, behind Manchester United, Real Madrid, Arsenal, Barcelona and Bayern Munich; they valued the club at $822m\u00a0(\u00a3532m), excluding debt.[129] Accountants Deloitte ranked Liverpool eighth in the Deloitte Football Money League, which ranks the world's football clubs in terms of revenue. Liverpool's income in the 2009\u201310 season was \u20ac225.3m.[130] According to a 2018 report by Deloitte, the club had an annual revenue of \u20ac424.2\u00a0million for the previous year,[131] and *Forbes* valued the club at $1.944\u00a0billion.[132] In 2018, annual revenue increased to \u20ac513.7\u00a0million,[133] and *Forbes* valued the club at $2.183\u00a0billion.[134] In 2019 revenue increased to \u20ac604\u00a0million (\u00a3533\u00a0million) according to Deloitte, with the club breaching the half a billion pounds mark.[135]\n\n\nIn April 2020, the owners of the club came under fire from fans and the media for deciding to furlough all non-playing staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.[136] In response to this, the club made a U-turn on the decision and apologised for their initial decision.[137] In April 2021 *Forbes* valued the club at $4.1\u00a0billion, a two-year increase of 88%, making it the world's fifth-most-valuable football club.[138]\n\n\n\n\n## Liverpool in the media[edit]\n\n\nLiverpool featured in the first edition of BBC's *Match of the Day*, which screened highlights of their match against Arsenal at Anfield on 22 August 1964. The first football match to be televised in colour was between Liverpool and West Ham United, broadcast live in March 1967.[139] Liverpool fans featured in the Pink Floyd song \"Fearless\", in which they sang excerpts from \"You'll Never Walk Alone\".[140] To mark the club's appearance in the 1988 FA Cup Final, Liverpool released the \"Anfield Rap\", a song featuring John Barnes and other members of the squad.[141]\n\n\nA docudrama on the Hillsborough disaster, written by Jimmy McGovern, was screened in 1996. It featured Christopher Eccleston as Trevor Hicks, who lost two teenage daughters in the disaster, went on to campaign for safer stadiums and helped to form the Hillsborough Families Support Group.[142] Liverpool featured in the 2001 film *The 51st State*, in which ex-hitman Felix DeSouza (Robert Carlyle) is a keen supporter of the team and the last scene takes place at a match between Liverpool and Manchester United.[143] The club also featured in the 1984 children's television show *Scully*, about a young boy who tries to gain a trial with Liverpool.[144] In the *Doctor Who* episode \"The Halloween Apocalypse\", aired in October 2021, features The Doctor (played by Jodie Whittaker) exiting the TARDIS outside Anfield as she exclaims: \"Liverpool? Anfield! Klopp era, classic!\".[145]\n\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\n### First-team squad[edit]\n\n\n*As of 1 September 2023*[146]\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Alex Raisbeck, who was club captain from 1899 to 1909, was the longest serving captain before being overtaken by Steven Gerrard who served 12 seasons as Liverpool captain starting from the 2003\u201304 season.[151] The present captain is Virgil van Dijk, who in the 2023\u201324 season replaced Jordan Henderson who moved to Al-Ettifaq.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Name\n | Period\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Scotland](image) Andrew Hannah | 1892\u20131895\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Jimmy Ross | 1895\u20131897\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) John McCartney | 1897\u20131898\n |\n| ![England](image) Harry Storer | 1898\u20131899\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Alex Raisbeck | 1899\u20131909\n |\n| ![England](image) Arthur Goddard | 1909\u20131912\n |\n| ![England](image) Ephraim Longworth | 1912\u20131913\n |\n| ![England](image) Harry Lowe | 1913\u20131915\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Donald McKinlay | 1919\u20131920\n |\n| ![England](image) Ephraim Longworth | 1920\u20131921\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Donald McKinlay | 1921\u20131928\n |\n| ![England](image) Tom Bromilow | 1928\u20131929\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) James Jackson | 1929\u20131930\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Tom Morrison | 1930\u20131931\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Tom Bradshaw | 1931\u20131934\n |\n| ![England](image) Tom Cooper | 1934\u20131939\n |\n\n | \n\n| Name\n | Period\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Scotland](image) Matt Busby | 1939\u20131940\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Willie Fagan | 1945\u20131947\n |\n| ![England](image) Jack Balmer | 1947\u20131950\n |\n| ![England](image) Phil Taylor | 1950\u20131953\n |\n| ![England](image) Bill Jones | 1953\u20131954\n |\n| ![England](image) Laurie Hughes | 1954\u20131955\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Billy Liddell | 1955\u20131958\n |\n| ![England](image) Johnny Wheeler | 1958\u20131959\n |\n| ![England](image) Ronnie Moran | 1959\u20131960\n |\n| ![England](image) Dick White | 1960\u20131961\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Ron Yeats | 1961\u20131970\n |\n| ![England](image) Tommy Smith | 1970\u20131973\n |\n| ![England](image) Emlyn Hughes | 1973\u20131978\n |\n| ![England](image) Phil Thompson | 1978\u20131981\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Graeme Souness | 1982\u20131984\n |\n| ![England](image) Phil Neal | 1984\u20131985\n |\n\n | \n\n| Name\n | Period\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Scotland](image) Alan Hansen | 1985\u20131988\n |\n| ![Republic of Ireland](image) Ronnie Whelan | 1988\u20131989\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Alan Hansen | 1989\u20131990\n |\n| ![Republic of Ireland](image) Ronnie Whelan | 1990\u20131991\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Steve Nicol | 1990\u20131991\n |\n| ![England](image) Mark Wright | 1991\u20131993\n |\n| ![Wales](image) Ian Rush | 1993\u20131996\n |\n| ![England](image) John Barnes | 1996\u20131997\n |\n| ![England](image) Paul Ince | 1997\u20131999\n |\n| ![England](image) Jamie Redknapp | 1999\u20132002\n |\n| ![Finland](image) Sami Hyypi\u00e4 | 2001\u20132003\n |\n| ![England](image) Steven Gerrard | 2003\u20132015\n |\n| ![England](image) Jordan Henderson | 2015\u20132023\n |\n| ![Netherlands](image) Virgil van Dijk | 2023\u2013\n |\n\n |\n\n\n### Player of the season[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Liverpool Player of the Season Awards\n\n## Club officials[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Owner: ![United States](image) Fenway Sports Group\n* Ambassadors: ![Wales](image) Ian Rush, ![England](image) Robbie Fowler, ![England](image) Michael Owen[152]\n\nLiverpool Football Club and Athletic Grounds Limited[edit]* Principal owner: ![United States](image) John W.

The trophies have ribbons on them and there is memorabilia next to them](image)The six European Cups Liverpool won from 1977 to 2019 on display in the club's museum\nLiverpool's first trophy was the Lancashire League, which it won in the club's first season.[5] In 1901, the club won its first League title, while the nineteenth and most recent was in 2020. Its first success in the FA Cup was in 1965. In terms of the number of trophies won, Liverpool's most successful decade was the 1980s, when the club won six League titles, two FA Cups, four League Cups, one Football League Super Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared) and two European Cups.\n\n\nThe club has accumulated more top-flight wins and points than any other English team.[159] Liverpool also has the highest average league finishing position (3.3) for the 50-year period to 2015[160] and second-highest average league finishing position for the period 1900\u20131999 after Arsenal, with an average league placing of 8.7.[161]\n\n\nLiverpool is the most successful British club in international football with fourteen trophies, having won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League, UEFA's premier club competition, six times, an English record and only surpassed by Real Madrid and A.C. Milan.

For a season-by-season statistical breakdown, see List of Arsenal F.C. seasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n![Freddie Ljunberg, wearing gloves and a redcurrant football shirt applauds the crowd. A stand full with people and man wearing a football shirt are visible in the background.](image)Thierry Henry became Arsenal's record goalscorer in October 2005.\nArsenal Football Club is an English professional association football club based in Islington, London. The club was formed in Woolwich in 1886 as Dial Square before being renamed as Royal Arsenal, and then Woolwich Arsenal in 1893.[1] In 1914, the club's name was shortened to Arsenal F.C. after moving to Highbury a year earlier.[2] After spending their first four seasons solely participating in cup tournaments and friendlies, Arsenal became the first southern member admitted into the Football League in 1893.[3] In spite of finishing fifth in the Second Division in 1919, the club was voted to rejoin the First Division at the expense of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur.[4] Since that time, they have not fallen below the first tier of the English football league system and hold the record for the longest uninterrupted period in the top flight.[5] The club remained in the Football League until 1992, when its First Division was superseded as English football's top level by the newly formed Premier League, of which they were an inaugural member.[6]\n\n\nThe list encompasses the honours won by Arsenal at national, regional, county and friendly level, records set by the club, their managers and their players. The player records section itemises the club's leading goalscorers and those who have made most appearances in first-team competitions. It also records notable achievements by Arsenal players on the international stage, and the highest transfer fees paid and received by the club. Attendance records at Highbury, the Emirates Stadium, the club's home ground since 2006, and Wembley Stadium, their temporary home for UEFA Champions League games between 1998 and 1999, are also included.\n\n\nArsenal have won 13 top-flight titles, and hold the record for the most FA Cup wins, with 14. The club's record appearance maker is David O'Leary, who made 722 appearances between 1975 and 1993. Thierry Henry is Arsenal's record goalscorer, scoring 228 goals in total.\n\n\nAll figures are correct as of *26 December 2020*.\n\n\n\n\n## Honours and achievements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Premier League commissioned a unique gold trophy to commemorate Arsenal's unbeaten season of 2003\u201304.\nArsenal's first ever silverware was won as the Royal Arsenal in 1890. The Kent Junior Cup, won by Royal Arsenal's reserves, was the club's first trophy, while the first team's first trophy came three weeks later when they won the Kent Senior Cup.[7][8] Their first national major honour came in 1930, when they won the FA Cup.[9] The club enjoyed further success in the 1930s, winning another FA Cup and five Football League First Division titles.[10][11] Arsenal won their first league and cup double in the 1970\u201371 season and twice repeated the feat, in 1997\u201398 and 2001\u201302, as well as winning a cup double of the FA Cup and League Cup in 1992\u201393.[12] In 2003\u201304, Arsenal recorded an unbeaten top-flight league season, something achieved only once before by Preston North End in 1888\u201389, who only had to play 22 games.[13] To mark the achievement, a special gold version of the Premier League trophy was commissioned and presented to the club the following season.[14] Their most recent success came in 2023, when they defeated Manchester City 4\u20131 on penalties to secure their 17th Community Shield title.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Arsenal F.C. timeline\n |\n| This box: * view\n* talk\n* edit\n |\n|

Chapman remained sober while the Bolton representatives got very drunk, and managed to haggle down the fee to a price he considered a bargain.[96] Jack's transfer to Arsenal was the second time Jack broke the world football transfer record, the first time being his \u00a33,500 move from Plymouth Argyle to Bolton Wanderers in 1920.[97]\n\n\nFor consistency, fees in the record transfer tables below are all sourced from BBC Sport's contemporary reports of each transfer.

They also reached the final of the UEFA Cup in 2000 and the Europa League in 2019, and became the first London team to appear in a UEFA Champions League final in 2006.[162][163] Despite having never won the UEFA Champions League, Arsenal have set numerous records in the competition. Between the 1998\u201399 and 2016\u201317 seasons, they participated in nineteen successive editions, a record only surpassed in Europe by Real Madrid.[164] Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann kept ten consecutive clean sheets in the run-in to Arsenal's first UEFA Champions League final and the defence went 995 minutes until conceding a goal.[165] Arsenal were also the first British side to defeat Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund away from home, and both Milanese teams: Internazionale and Milan at the San Siro. They were also the first British side to win away to Juventus.[166]\n\n\n\n## Global records[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1928, Arsenal, alongside Chelsea, made history by becoming the first football clubs to wear numbered shirts.[167] A year earlier the first ever live radio commentary of a football match took place, between Arsenal and Sheffield United.[168] Arsenal played in the first match broadcast live on television, against their reserve counterparts in 1937 and have since participated in the world's first live 3D and interactive football matches, both with Manchester United.[169][170][171]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Football records and statistics in England\n* Premier League records and statistics\n\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** For a record of all matches participated in by Arsenal, see the AISA Arsenal History Society's line-ups database.[8] For corroboration, multiple other sources exist.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23]\n2. **^** Although not organised by UEFA, it is considered to be a major honor by FIFA and UEFA took over the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1971 and reformed it into the UEFA Cup. As the official precursor to the UEFA Europa League, it is included here under UEFA.\n3. **^** The Sheriff of London Charity Shield was replaced by the FA Charity Shield (now FA Community Shield) in 1908. Although it is the official precursor to the FA Community Shield, it is not included here under The Football Association because Arsenal only won the fundraising matches that followed the Sheriff of London Charity Shield's 1931 revival.\n4. **^** Laurie Scott and George Eastham were called up to England squads (1950, and 1962 and 1966, respectively), but did not play.[83]\n5. **^** George Eastham was retrospectively awarded a medal for being a non-playing member of England's 1966 World Cup-winning side.[87]\n6. **^** Unusually, Arsenal were forced to play two matches on the same day on 12 December 1896; while the first team took on Loughborough in the League, the reserves played Leyton in the FA Cup. The irony is that the reserves won handsomely, 5\u20130, whilst the seniors suffered Arsenal's record league defeat.[145][146] Additionally, Arsenal lost 0\u20139 to Chelsea in a wartime London Combination match on 21 April 1916,[147] but this is not counted as an official first-class match.[148]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n**General**\n\n\n\n* Harris, Jeff (1995).

He is currently the manager of the France national under-21 team. He is considered one of the greatest strikers of all time,[4][5][6][7][8] and one of the greatest players in Premier League history. He has been named by Arsenal as the club's greatest ever player.[9] Henry was runner-up for both the Ballon d'Or in 2003 and the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2003 and 2004. He was named the FWA Footballer of the Year a record three times, the PFA Players' Player of the Year a joint-record two times, and was named in the PFA Team of the Year six consecutive times. He was also included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI once and the UEFA Team of the Year five times. In 2004, Henry was named by Pel\u00e9 in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[10]\n\n\nHenry made his professional debut with Monaco in 1994 before signing for defending Serie A champions Juventus. However, limited playing time, coupled with disagreements with the club's hierarchy, led to him signing for Premier League club Arsenal for \u00a311\u00a0million in 1999. Under long-time mentor and coach Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Henry became a prolific striker and Arsenal's all-time leading scorer with 228 goals in all competitions. He won the Premier League Golden Boot a record four times, won two FA Cups and two Premier League titles with the club, including one during an unbeaten *Invincible* season. Henry spent his final two seasons with Arsenal as club captain, leading them to the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. Henry transferred to Barcelona in 2007 and in the 2008\u201309 season, he was a key part of the club's historic treble when they won La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League. In 2010, he joined Major League Soccer (MLS) club New York Red Bulls and returned to Arsenal on loan for two months in 2012, before retiring in 2014.\n\n\nHenry had success with France, winning the 1998 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2000, and 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. He was named French Player of the Year a record five times, named to the UEFA Euro 2000 Team of the Tournament, awarded both the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and named to the 2006 FIFA World Cup All-Star Team. In October 2007, he became his country's record goalscorer, a record he held until December 2022.[11] After amassing 123 appearances and 51 goals, Henry retired from international football after the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nAfter retiring, Henry transitioned into coaching. He began coaching Arsenal's youth teams in February 2015, in tandem with his work as a pundit for Sky Sports. In 2016, he was appointed as an assistant coach at Belgium, before assuming the role as the head coach at Monaco in 2018. He was relieved of his duties at Monaco in January 2019 and returned to MLS less than a year later to manage Montr\u00e9al Impact. He led Montr\u00e9al to the playoffs in the 2020 season before departing in 2021, returning to his role as an assistant coach for Belgium for a year and a half.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\nHenry is of Antillean heritage:[12] his father, Antoine, is from Guadeloupe (La D\u00e9sirade island), and his mother, Maryse, is from Martinique. He was born and raised in Les Ulis suburb of Paris which, despite sometimes being seen as a tough neighbourhood, provided good footballing facilities.[13][14] As a seven-year-old, Henry showed great potential, prompting Claude Chezelle to recruit him to the local club CO Les Ulis. His father pressured him to attend training, although the youngster was not particularly drawn to football.[2] He joined US Palaiseau in 1989, but after a year his father fell out with the club, so Henry moved to ES Viry-Ch\u00e2tillon and played there for two years.[12] US Palaiseau coach Jean-Marie Panza, Henry's future mentor, followed him there.[13]\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### 1992\u20131999: Beginnings at Monaco and transfer to Juventus[edit]\n\n\nIn 1990, Monaco sent scout Arnold Catalano to watch Henry, then at the age of 13 in a match.[15] Henry scored all six goals as his side won 6\u20130. Catalano asked him to join Monaco without even attending a trial first. Catalano requested that Henry complete a course at the elite INF Clairefontaine academy, and despite the director's reluctance to admit Henry due to his poor school results, he was allowed to complete the course and joined Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's Monaco as a youth player.[2] Subsequently, Henry signed professional forms with Monaco, and made his professional debut on 31 August 1994, in a 2\u20130 loss against Nice.[15] Although Wenger suspected that Henry should be deployed as a striker, he put Henry on the left wing because he believed that his pace, natural ball control and skill would be more effective against full backs than centre-backs.[12]\n\n\nAfter a tentative start to his Monaco career, Henry was named the French Young Footballer of the Year in 1996, and in the 1996\u201397 season, his solid performances helped the club win the Ligue 1 title.[2][16] During the 1997\u201398 season, he was instrumental in leading his club to the UEFA Champions League semi-final, setting a French record by scoring seven goals in the competition.[12][17] By his third season, he had received his first cap for the national team, and was part of the winning team in the 1998 FIFA World Cup.[12] He continued to impress at his tenure with Monaco, and in his five seasons with the club, the young winger scored 20 league goals in 105 appearances.[16]\n\n\nHenry left Monaco in January 1999, one year before his intimate and closest teammate David Trezeguet, and moved to Italian club Juventus for \u00a310.5\u00a0million.[2] He played on the wing,[18] as well as at wing back and wide midfield, but he was ineffective as a goal scorer, struggling against the defensive discipline exhibited by teams in Serie A, registering just three goals in 16 appearances.[19] In 2019, on Jamie Carragher's podcast *The Greatest Game*, Henry attributed disagreements with Juve director Luciano Moggi as his rationale behind departing the club.[20]\n\n\n\n### 1999\u20132007: Move to Arsenal, breakthrough, and success[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Henry was made captain following the departure of fellow Frenchman Patrick Vieira to Juventus in 2005.\nUnsettled in Italy, Henry transferred from Juventus on 3 August 1999 to Arsenal for an estimated fee of \u00a311\u00a0million, reuniting with his former manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger.[21][22] It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class footballer,[23] and although his transfer was not without controversy, Wenger was convinced he was worth the transfer fee.[12] Brought in as a replacement for fellow French forward Nicolas Anelka, Henry was immediately moulded into a striker by Wenger, a move that would pay rich dividends in years to come. However, doubts were raised about his ability to adapt to the quick and physical English game when he failed to score in his first eight games.[13] After several difficult months in England, Henry even conceded that he had to \"be re-taught everything about the art of striking.\"[13] These doubts were dispelled when he ended his first season at Arsenal with an impressive goal tally of 26.[24] Arsenal finished second in the Premier League behind Manchester United, and lost in the UEFA Cup Final against Galatasaray.[12]\n\n\nComing off the back of a victorious UEFA Euro 2000 campaign with the national team, Henry was ready to make an impact in the 2000\u201301 season. Despite recording fewer goals and assists than his first season, Henry's second season with Arsenal proved to be a breakthrough, as he became the club's top goalscorer. His goal tally included a spectacular strike against Manchester United where he flicked the ball up (with his back turned to goal), before he swivelled and volleyed in from 20 yards out.[25] The strike also featured a memorable goal celebration where he recreated the Budweiser \"Whassup?\" advertisement.[26] Armed with one of the league's best attacks, Arsenal finished runner-up to perennial rivals Manchester United in the Premier League. The team also reached the final of the FA Cup, losing 2\u20131 to Liverpool. Henry remained frustrated, however, by the fact that he had yet to help the club win honours, and frequently expressed his desire to establish Arsenal as a powerhouse.[12]\n\n\nSuccess finally arrived during the 2001\u201302 season. Arsenal finished seven points above Liverpool to win the Premier League title, and defeated Chelsea 2\u20130 in the FA Cup Final.[12] Henry became the league's top goalscorer and netted 32 goals in all competitions as he led Arsenal to a double and his first silverware with the club.[2][27] There was much expectation that Henry would replicate his club form for France during the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but the defending champions suffered a shock exit at the group stage.[12]\n\n\n2002\u201303 proved to be another productive season for Henry, as he scored 32 goals in all competitions while contributing 23 assists\u2014remarkable returns for a striker.[27] In doing so, he led Arsenal to another FA Cup triumph (where he was man-of-the-match in the Final),[28] although Arsenal failed to retain their Premier League title.[29] Throughout the season, he competed with Manchester United's Ruud van Nistelrooy for the league scoring title, but the Dutchman edged Henry to the Golden Boot by a single goal.[12] Nonetheless, Henry was named both the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year.[30][31] His rising status as one of the world's best footballers was affirmed when he emerged runner-up for the 2003 FIFA World Player of the Year award.[23] With 24 goals and 20 assists in the league, Henry set a new record for most assists in a single Premier League season,[32] and also became the first player in history to record at least 20 goals and 20 assists in a single season in one of Europe's top\u2013five leagues\u2014this feat has since been matched by Lionel Messi in 2020.[33][34]\n\n\n\n![](image)Henry in a Premier League game against Charlton Athletic at Highbury in March 2006\nEntering the 2003\u201304 season, Arsenal were determined to reclaim the Premier League crown. Henry was again instrumental in Arsenal's exceptionally successful campaign; together with the likes of Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Vieira, Freddie Ljungberg and Robert Pires, Henry ensured that the Gunners became the first team in more than a century to go through the entire domestic league season unbeaten, claiming the league title in the process.[35] Apart from being named for the second year running as the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year,[30][31] Henry emerged once again as the runner-up for 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year award.[23] With 39 goals scored in all competitions, the Frenchman led the league in goals scored and won the European Golden Boot.[2][36] However, as was the case in 2002, Henry was unable to lead the national side to honours during UEFA Euro 2004.[12]\n\n\nThis dip in success was compounded when Arsenal failed again to secure back-to-back league titles when they lost out to Chelsea in the 2004\u201305 season, although Arsenal did win the FA Cup (the Final of which Henry missed through injury).[16] Henry maintained his reputation as one of Europe's most feared strikers as he led the league in scoring,[2] and with 31 goals in all competitions,[37] he was the co-recipient (with Diego Forl\u00e1n) of the European Golden Boot, becoming the first player to officially win the award twice in a row (Ally McCoist had won two Golden Boots in a row, but both were deemed unofficial).[36] The unexpected departure of Arsenal's captain Patrick Vieira in the 2005 close season led to Henry being awarded club captaincy, a role which many felt was not naturally suited for him; the captaincy is more commonly given to defenders or midfielders, who are better-placed on the pitch to read the game.[2] Along with being chief goalscorer, he was responsible for leading a very young team which had yet to gel fully.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)After the retirement of Dennis Bergkamp, Henry regularly partnered Robin van Persie in the Arsenal attack.\nThe 2005\u201306 season proved to be one of remarkable personal achievements for Henry. On 17 October 2005, Henry became the club's top goalscorer of all time;[39] two goals against Sparta Prague in the Champions League meant he broke Ian Wright's record of 185 goals.[40] On 1 February 2006, he scored a goal against West Ham United, bringing his league goal tally up to 151, breaking Arsenal legend Cliff Bastin's league goals record.[41] Henry scored his 100th league goal at Highbury, a feat unparalleled in the history of the club, and a unique achievement in the Premier League.[42] On the final day of the Premier League season, Henry scored a hat-trick against Wigan Athletic in the last match played at Highbury. He completed the season as the league's top goalscorer,[2] was voted the FWA Footballer of the Year for the third time in his career, and was selected in the FIFA World XI.[16][43]\n\n\nNevertheless, Arsenal failed to win the Premier League title again, but hopes of a trophy were revived when Arsenal reached the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. The Gunners eventually lost 2\u20131 to Barcelona, with Henry assisting the team's only goal from a free kick, and Arsenal's inability to win the league title for two consecutive seasons combined with the relative inexperience of the Arsenal squad caused much speculation that Henry would leave for another club. However, he declared his love for the club and accepted a four-year contract, and said he would stay at Arsenal for life.[31][44] Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein later claimed the club had turned down two bids of \u00a350\u00a0million from Spanish clubs for Henry before the signing of the new contract.[45] Had the transfer materialised, it would have surpassed the then-world record \u00a347\u00a0million paid for Zinedine Zidane.[45]\n\n\nHenry's 2006\u201307 season was marred by injuries.[46] Although he scored 10 goals in 17 domestic appearances for Arsenal, Henry's season was cut short in February. Having missed games due to hamstring, foot, and back problems, he was deemed fit enough to come on as a late substitute against PSV in a Champions League match,[47] but began limping shortly after coming on. Scans the next day revealed that he would need at least three months to heal from new groin and stomach injuries, missing the rest of the 2006\u201307 season.[48] Wenger attributed Henry's injuries to a protracted 2005\u201306 campaign, and reiterated that Henry was keen on staying with the Gunners to rebuild for the 2007\u201308 season.[46]\n\n\n\n### 2007\u20132010: Barcelona and a historic treble[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Henry at Barcelona in 2008\nOn 25 June 2007, in an unexpected turn of events, Henry was transferred to Barcelona for \u20ac24\u00a0million. He signed a four-year deal for a reported \u20ac6.8 (\u00a34.6) million per season.[49] It was revealed that the contract included a release clause of \u20ac125 (\u00a384.9) million.[50] Henry cited the departure of Dein and continued uncertainty over Wenger's future as reasons for leaving,[51] and maintained that \"I always said that if I ever left Arsenal it would be to play for Barcelona.\"[52] Despite their captain's departure, Arsenal got off to an impressive start for the 2007\u201308 campaign, and Henry said that his presence in the team might have been more of a hindrance than a help. He stated, \"Because of my seniority, the fact that I was captain and my habit of screaming for the ball, they would sometimes give it to me even when I was not in the best position. So in that sense it was good for the team that I moved on.\"[53] Henry left Arsenal as the club's leading all-time league goalscorer with 174 goals and leading all-time goalscorer in European competitions with 42 goals;[2] in July 2008, Arsenal fans voted him as Arsenal's greatest player ever in Arsenal.com's Gunners' Greatest 50 Players poll.[54]\n\n\nAt Barcelona, Henry was given the number 14 jersey, the same as he had worn at Arsenal. He scored his first goal for his new club on 19 September 2007 in a 3\u20130 Champions League group stage win over Lyon,[55] and he recorded his first hat-trick for Bar\u00e7a in a Primera Divisi\u00f3n match against Levante ten days later.[56] But with Henry mostly deployed on the wing throughout the season, he was unable to reproduce the goal-scoring form he achieved with Arsenal. He expressed dissatisfaction with the move to Barcelona in the initial year, amidst widespread speculation of a return to the Premier League. In an interview with Garth Crooks on BBC's *Football Focus*, Henry described missing life \"back home\" and even \"the English press.\"[57] However, Henry concluded his debut season as the club's top scorer with 19 goals in addition to nine league assists, second behind Lionel Messi's ten.[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)Henry playing for Barcelona in a UEFA Champions League game during the 2008\u201309 season\nHenry went on to surpass this tally in a more integrated 2008\u201309 campaign, with 26 goals and 10 assists from the left wing.[59] He won the first trophy of his Barcelona career on 13 May 2009 when Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final. Barcelona won the Primera Divisi\u00f3n and UEFA Champions League soon after, completing a treble for the Frenchman, who had combined with Messi and Samuel Eto'o to score 100 goals between them that season.[60] The trio was also the most prolific trio in Spanish league history, scoring 72 goals and surpassing the 66 goals of Real Madrid's Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano and Luis del Sol of the 1960\u201361 season (this was later surpassed by Real Madrid trio Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gonzalo Higua\u00edn who scored 89 goals in 2011\u201312).[61] Later in 2009, Henry helped Barcelona win an unprecedented sextuple, consisting of the aforementioned treble, the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, the UEFA Super Cup, and the FIFA Club World Cup.[62]\n\n\nThe following season, the emergence of Pedro meant that Henry only started 15 league games.[27] Before the La Liga season ended, and with a year still left on his contract, club president Joan Laporta stated on 5 May 2010 that Henry \"may go away in the summer transfer window if that's what he wants.\"[63] After Henry returned from the 2010 World Cup, Barcelona confirmed that they had agreed to the sale of Henry to an unnamed club, with the player still to agree terms with the new club.[64]\n\n\n\n### 2010\u20132014: New York Red Bulls and retirement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Henry playing for the New York Red Bulls in 2011\nIn July 2010, Henry signed a multi-year contract with Major League Soccer (MLS) club New York Red Bulls for the 2010 season as its second designated player.[65] He made his full MLS debut on 31 July in a 2\u20132 draw against Houston Dynamo, assisting both goals to Juan Pablo \u00c1ngel. His first MLS goal came on 28 August in a 2\u20130 victory against San Jose Earthquakes. The Red Bulls eventually topped the MLS Eastern Conference by one point over Columbus Crew[66] before losing 3\u20132 on aggregate against San Jose Earthquakes in the quarter-finals of the 2010 MLS Cup Playoffs.[67] The next season, the Red Bulls were 10th overall in the league,[68] and bowed out in the Conference semi-finals of the 2011 MLS Cup Playoffs.[69]\n\n\n\n#### Return to Arsenal (loan)[edit]\n\n\nAfter training with Arsenal during the MLS off-season, Henry re-signed for the club on a two-month loan deal on 6 January 2012. This was to provide cover for Gervinho and Marouane Chamakh, who were unavailable due to their participation in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations.[70] Henry was given the number 12 jersey \u2013 his old Arsenal number 14 jersey, the same number he wore at Barcelona and New York, was unavailable, with Theo Walcott inheriting it following Henry's departure from the club in 2007.[71] Henry made his second Arsenal debut as a substitute against Leeds United in the FA Cup third round and scored the only goal.[72] In his last league game on loan, he scored the winning goal in stoppage time in a 2\u20131 win against Sunderland.[73] His final goals for the club meant he finished his Arsenal career with a record 228 goals; 175 of them came in the Premier League.\n\n\n\n#### Return to New York Red Bulls[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Henry signing autographs in February 2014\nOn 17 February 2012, Henry returned to Red Bulls to prepare for the 2012 season. His base salary of $5\u00a0million ($5.6\u00a0million guaranteed) made him the highest-paid player in MLS\u2014surpassing David Beckham, who had taken a salary cut for his last year with the Los Angeles Galaxy.[74] In 2013, Henry's base salary dropped to $3.75\u00a0million setting him behind Robbie Keane's $4\u00a0million base salary. With bonuses, however, Henry remained the highest-paid player with $4.35\u00a0million compared to Keane's $4.33\u00a0million.[75]\n\n\nOn 31 March 2012, Henry scored his first MLS hat-trick in a 5\u20132 Red Bulls win over the Montreal Impact.[76] He was named MLS Player of the Month that same month. On 27 October 2013, Henry scored once and provided two assists in the last game of the season against the Chicago Fire at Red Bull Arena to help his team win 5\u20132 and become champions of the regular season. It was the club's first major trophy in their 17-year history.[77][78]\n\n\nOn 12 July 2014, Henry provided a goal and three assists in a 4\u20131 Red Bulls win over the Columbus Crew. With that effort he became the all-time assist leader for the New York Red Bulls with 37, surpassing Amado Guevara and Tab Ramos.[79]\n\n\nOn 1 December 2014, it was announced that Henry had left the Red Bulls after four-and-a-half years at the club.[80] On 16 December, he announced his retirement as a player and stated that he would begin working for Sky Sports as a pundit.[81] After working at Sky for over three years, Henry quit his position in July 2018 to focus on his career as a coach.[82]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of international goals scored by Thierry Henry\n\nHenry enjoyed a successful career with the France national team, winning the first of his 123 caps in June 1997, when his good form for Monaco was rewarded with a call-up to the Under-20 French national team, where he played in the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship alongside future teammates William Gallas and David Trezeguet.[2] Within four months, France head coach Aim\u00e9 Jacquet called Henry up to the senior team. The 20-year-old made his senior international debut on 11 October 1997 in a 2\u20131 win against South Africa.[83] Jacquet was so impressed with Henry that he took him to the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Although Henry was a largely unknown quantity at international level, he ended the tournament as France's top scorer with three goals.[84] He was scheduled to appear as a substitute in the final, where France beat Brazil 3\u20130, but Marcel Desailly's sending off forced a defensive change instead. In 1998, he was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour, France's highest decoration.[85]\n\n\nHenry was a member of France's UEFA Euro 2000 squad, again scoring three goals in the tournament, including the equaliser against Portugal in the semi-final, and finishing as the country's top scorer.[86][87] France later won the game in extra time following a converted penalty kick by Zinedine Zidane. France went on to defeat Italy in extra-time in the final, earning Henry his second major international medal.[88] During the tournament, Henry was voted man of the match in three games, including the final against Italy.[89][90]\n\n\n\n![](image)Henry playing for France against Italy during the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final. He wore number 12 for France, the same number as his idol Marco van Basten.[91]\nThe 2002 FIFA World Cup featured a stunning early exit for both Henry and France as the defending champions were eliminated in the group stage after failing to score a goal in all three games.[2] France lost against Senegal in their first group match and Henry was red carded for a dangerous sliding challenge in their next match against Uruguay.[12] In that game, France played to a 0\u20130 draw, but Henry was forced to miss the final group match due to suspension; France lost 2\u20130 to Denmark.[12]\n\n\nHenry returned to form for his country at the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. Despite playing without team stalwarts Zidane and Patrick Vieira, France won, in large part owing to Henry's outstanding play, for which he was named Man of the Match by FIFA's Technical Study Group in three of France's five matches.[2] In the final, he scored the golden goal in extra time to lift the title for the host country after a 1\u20130 victory over Cameroon.[2] Henry was awarded both the Adidas Golden Ball as the outstanding player of the competition and the Adidas Golden Shoe as the tournament's top goalscorer with four goals.[2]\n\n\nIn UEFA Euro 2004, Henry played in all of France's matches and scored two goals.[16] France beat England in the group stage but lost to the eventual winners Greece 1\u20130 in the quarter-finals.[92] During the 2006 FIFA World Cup Henry remained as one of the automatic starters in the squad. He played as a lone striker, but despite an indifferent start to the tournament, became one of the top players of the World Cup. He scored three goals, including the winning goal from Zidane's free kick against defending champions Brazil in the quarter-final.[2] However, France subsequently lost to Italy on penalties (5\u20133) in the final. Henry did not take part in the penalty shoot-out, having been substituted in extra time after his legs had cramped.[93] Henry was one of ten nominees for the Golden Ball award for Player of the Tournament, an award which was ultimately presented to his teammate, Zidane[94] and was named a starting striker on the 2006 FIFPro World XI team.[95]\n\n\n\n![](image)Henry (in blue, fourth from right) enters the field with France in their Euro 2008 game against the Netherlands.\nOn 13 October 2007, Henry scored his 41st goal against the Faroe Islands, joining Michel Platini as the country's top goalscorer of all time.[53] Four days later at the Stade de la Beaujoire, he scored a late double against Lithuania, thereby setting a new record as France's top goalscorer.[96] On 3 June 2008, Henry made his 100th appearance for the national team in a match against Colombia, becoming the sixth French player ever to reach that milestone.[97]\n\n\nHenry missed the opening game of France's short-lived UEFA Euro 2008 campaign, where they were eliminated in the group stages after being drawn in the same group as Italy, the Netherlands and Romania.[98] He scored France's only goal in the competition in a 4\u20131 loss to the Netherlands.[99]\n\n\nThe French team struggled during the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and finished second in their group behind Serbia. During the play-offs against the Republic of Ireland, Henry was involved in a controversy in the second leg of the game at the Stade de France on 18 November 2009. With the aggregate score tied at 1\u20131 and the game in extra time, he used his hand twice to control the ball before delivering a cross to William Gallas who scored the winner.[100] This sparked a barrage of criticism against the Frenchman, while national team coach Raymond Domenech and Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger defended him.[101][102] The Football Association of Ireland lodged a formal complaint with FIFA, seeking a replay of the game, which FIFA declined.[103] Henry said that he contemplated retiring from international football after the reactions to the incident, but maintained that he was not a \"cheat\"; hours after FIFA had ruled out a replay, he stated that \"the fairest solution would be to replay the game\".[104] FIFA President Sepp Blatter described the incident as \"blatant unfair play\" and announced an inquiry into how such incidents could be avoided in future, and added that the incident would be investigated by the Disciplinary Committee.[105] Blatter also said Henry told him that his family had been threatened in the aftermath of the incident.[106] In January 2010, FIFA announced that there was no legal basis to sanction Henry.[107]\n\n\nHenry did not feature in the starting line-up for France at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. France drew in their first game against Uruguay, and lost 2\u20130 in their second against Mexico. The team was thrown into disarray when Nicolas Anelka was expelled from the team, and captain Patrice Evra led a team protest by refusing to train.[108] In the final group game against host-nation South Africa in which Henry came on as a second-half substitute, France lost 2\u20131 and were eliminated from the tournament. He then announced his retirement from international football, having won 123 caps and scored 51 goals for *Les Bleus*, thus finishing his international career as France's all-time top scorer, and second most capped player after Lilian Thuram.[109]\n\n\n\n## Style of play[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Henry attacking for the MLS All Stars in July 2013\nAlthough Henry played up front as a striker during his youth,[13] he spent his time at Monaco and Juventus playing on the wing. When Henry joined Arsenal in 1999, Wenger immediately changed this, switching Henry to his childhood position, often pairing him with Dutch veteran Dennis Bergkamp.[18] During the 2004\u201305 season, Wenger switched Arsenal's formation to 4\u20135\u20131.[110] This change forced Henry to adapt again to fit into the Arsenal team, and he played many games as a lone striker.[18] Still, Henry remained Arsenal's main offensive threat, on many occasions conjuring spectacular goals. Wenger said of his fellow Frenchman: \"Thierry Henry could take the ball in the middle of the park and score a goal that no one else in the world could score\".[111]\n\n\nOne of the reasons cited for Henry's impressive play up front is his ability to calmly score from one-on-ones.[112] According to his father Antoine, Henry learned precision shooting from watching his idol Marco van Basten.[13] He was also influenced by Rom\u00e1rio, Ronaldo and Liberian star George Weah, a new breed of strikers in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal.[113] At his physical peak from the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, Henry's ability to dribble past opponents with exceptional pace, skill and composure, meant that he could get in behind defenders regularly enough to score.[13][114] In 2004, former Arsenal striker Alan Smith commented on Henry: \"I have to say I haven't seen a player like him. He's an athlete with great technical ability and a tremendous desire to be the best.\"[13]\n\n\n\n![](image)Henry taking on Manchester United defender John O'Shea. In his prime, Henry would often drift out to the left wing position and run towards goal.[115]\nWhen up front, Henry is occasionally known to move out wide to the left wing position,[115][116] something which enables him to contribute heavily in assists: between 2002\u201303 and 2004\u201305, the striker managed almost 50 assists in total and this was attributed to his unselfish play and creativity.[39] Ranking Henry the greatest player in Premier League history, in February 2020 *FourFourTwo* magazine stated, \"No one assisted more in a season. No one has terrorised defenders with such a combination of bewitching grace and phenomenal power.\"[117]\n\n\nComing in from the left, Henry's trademark finish saw him place the ball inside the far right corner of the goal.[118] Henry would also drift offside to fool the defence then run back onside before the ball is played and beat the offside trap, although he never provided Arsenal a distinct aerial threat.[119] Given his versatility in being able to operate as both a winger and a striker, the Frenchman is not a prototypical \"out-and-out striker\", but he has emerged consistently as one of Europe's most prolific strikers.[12] In set pieces, Henry was the first-choice penalty and free kick taker for Arsenal, scoring regularly from those situations.[120][121] Henry was also a notable exponent of a no-look pass where he would feint to pass the ball with his right foot, but would make contact with the ball using his standing foot (his left).[122]\n\n\n\n## Managerial career[edit]\n\n\n### Arsenal youth[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Henry as coach of Arsenal under 19s in September 2015\nHenry began coaching Arsenal's youth teams in February 2015, in tandem with his work for Sky Sports.[123] His influence on the team was praised by players such as Alex Iwobi, who dedicated a goal against Bayern Munich in the 2015\u201316 UEFA Youth League to his advice.[124] Having earned a UEFA A Licence, he was offered the job of under-18 coach by Academy head Andries Jonker, but the decision was overruled by Wenger, who wanted a full-time coach for the team.[125]\n\n\n\n### Belgium (assistant)[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2016, Henry became second assistant coach of the Belgium national team, working alongside head coach Roberto Mart\u00ednez and fellow assistant Graeme Jones.[126] In an interview with NBC Sports, Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku praised Henry for his work with him, stating, \"Henry is the best thing that has happened to me because since I came to England aged 18 I have had the best mentors. Thierry for me is the best. Every day whether it is positive and negative I take it in my stride because I know what is expected from the top level.\"[127] At the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Belgium reached the semi-final, but lost to Henry's home nation France 1\u20130.[128] Henry picked up a Bronze medal after Belgium defeated England 2\u20130 in the third-place play-off to secure their best ever World Cup finish.[129]\n\n\nHenry was reportedly offered the position of head coach by Bordeaux in August 2018.[130][131] However, the offer was not accepted by Henry after disagreements with the club's owners.[132][133] Days after turning down the Bordeaux job, and following Jones's departure from the Belgium national team, Henry, who had been the forwards coach, was promoted to Belgium assistant coach.[134] However, his tenure in the role was short-lived, after he accepted the role as head coach at former club Monaco in October.[135]\n\n\n\n### Monaco[edit]\n\n\nOn 11 October 2018, Monaco dismissed Leonardo Jardim as club manager.[136] Jardim's position had become untenable after struggling heavily in domestic competition, with the club 18th at the time of his departure, and disputes over the club's transfer policy.[137] Monaco's search for a new coach coincided with the regulatory mid-season international break, allowing the club sufficient time to search for a replacement, however, they quickly decided on Henry, and he was appointed a mere two days later.[135] He signed a three-year deal, and was unveiled as Monaco manager on 18 October. At his first press conference, he told reporters: \"This club will always have a big place in my heart, so to be able to come here and start again, it is a dream come true. There is a lot of work to do, as you can imagine \u2013 but I am more than happy to be here\".[138]\n\n\nHenry's arrival at Monaco was greeted with mixed reactions by some media outlets, due to his relative inexperience as a top-level coach and the task of overturning Monaco's misfortunes. Despite inheriting a squad of sub-standard quality,[139] Henry expressed a desire of replicating the football he played under Pep Guardiola at Barcelona, as well as instilling the \"professionalism\" taught to him by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger.[140] Henry also adopted a hands-on approach to training sessions, being regularly involved in devising schemes and instructing drills.[141] His first match was a 2\u20131 away defeat against Strasbourg on 20 October.[142] He was unable to secure a win for over a month, enduring a period which included two high-profile defeats against Club Brugge[143] and Paris Saint-Germain,[144] prior to defeating Caen on 1\u20130 on 25 November.[145] He secured two wins in December, defeating Amiens in the league and Lorient in the Coupe de la Ligue, however, this was on the backdrop of three additional Ligue 1 defeats to close 2018 in the relegation zone.[146][147]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Henry entered the winter transfer window, where he signed left-back Fod\u00e9 Ballo-Tour\u00e9, and former Arsenal teammate Cesc F\u00e0bregas from Chelsea. He also sanctioned the loan signing of French defensive midfielder William Vainqueur on 12 January, and experienced defender Naldo. However, these signings would not turn around the club's fate, and on 24 January, Henry was dismissed at Monaco. The club were 19th at the time of his departure, and Henry left with a record of 4 wins, 5 draws, and 11 defeats, from 20 games in charge.[148]\n\n\n\n### Montreal Impact[edit]\n\n\nOn 14 November 2019, Henry became manager of Major League Soccer side Montreal Impact, signing a two-year deal until the end of the 2021 season with an option to extend it by a year until the 2022 season.[149] In his first press conference, Henry stated he had to \"confront\" the relative disappointment of his short stint as manager of Monaco, before undertaking a new job.[150]\n\n\nAfter leading Montreal to their first playoff berth in four seasons, on 25 February 2021, prior to the 2021 season, Henry stepped down as head coach of the renamed CF Montreal to be closer to his children in London. He had not been able to see them in the 2020 season due to travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and with restrictions continuing into the 2021 season, he decided to end the separation.[151][152]\n\n\n\n### Return to Belgium (assistant)[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Henry rejoined the coaching staff of Belgium prior to the UEFA Euro 2020.[153][154] He was also in the team's coaching staff for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. In February 2023, upon the appointment of Domenico Tedesco as Belgium's new head coach, Royal Belgian Football Association CEO Peter Bossaert announced that Henry would not be returning to the national team's coaching staff.[155]\n\n\nHenry was considered as being one of potential replacements for Corinne Diacre who got fired as France women's national football team head coach, but he turned down the possibility of managing them in favor of waiting for United States men's national soccer team permanent head coach position offer.[156]\n\n\n\n### France U21[edit]\n\n\nOn 21 August 2023, Henry was named as the new manager of the France national under-21 team and the France Olympic team who will lead the French during the 2024 Summer Olympics.[157]\n\n\n\n## Media/Broadcasting career[edit]\n\n\nAfter leaving CF Montreal, Henry resumed his punditry career. He joined CBS Sports in their UEFA Champions League coverage as studio analyst on 27 September 2021,[158] as well as being hired by Amazon Prime Video for their Premier League and Ligue 1 programs as consultant.[159]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n> \n> Remember the kid in the playground who was better than everyone else with a football at his feet? That's what Thierry Henry was like in his pomp. The Frenchman had exquisite technique, searing pace, and like the typical schoolboy superstar, he did pretty much everything for his team.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Arsenal.com entry for Henry ranking him #1 in their list of the 50 Greatest Arsenal Players.[160]\n\nHenry has received many plaudits and awards in his football career. He was runner-up for the 2003 and 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year awards;[23] in those two seasons, he also won back-to-back PFA Players' Player of the Year titles.[30] Henry is the only player ever to have won the FWA Footballer of the Year three times (2003, 2004, 2006),[31] and the French Player of the Year on a record four occasions. Henry was voted into the Premier League Overseas Team of the Decade in the 10 Seasons Awards poll in 2003,[161] and in 2004 he was named by football legend Pel\u00e9 on the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[162]\n\n\n\n![](image)Henry statue outside Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. The statue recreates Henry's fabled celebration where he slid to his knees after a goal against Spurs in 2002.[163]\nIn terms of goal-scoring awards, Henry was the European Golden Boot winner in 2004 and 2005 (sharing it with Villarreal's Diego Forl\u00e1n in 2005).[36] Henry was also the top goalscorer in the Premier League for a record four seasons (2002, 2004, 2005, 2006).[2] In 2006, he became the first player to score more than 20 goals in the league for five consecutive seasons (2002 to 2006).[164] With 175, Henry is currently seventh in the list of all-time Premier League goalscorers, behind Alan Shearer, Wayne Rooney, Harry Kane, Andy Cole, Sergio Ag\u00fcero, and Frank Lampard. He held the record for most goals in the competition for one club, until it was broken by Rooney in 2016,[165] and held the record for most goals by a foreign player in the competition until surpassed by Ag\u00fcero in 2020.[166] France's all-time record goalscorer was, in his prime in the mid 2000s, regarded by many coaches, footballers and journalists as one of the best players in the world.[27][167][168][169] In November 2007, he was ranked 33rd on the Association of Football Statisticians' compendium for \"Greatest Ever Footballers\".[170]\n\n\nArsenal fans honoured their former player in 2008, declaring Henry the greatest Arsenal player.[54] In two other 2008 surveys, Henry emerged as the favourite Premier League player of all time among 32,000 people surveyed in the Barclays 2008 Global Fan Report.[171][172] Arsenal fan and The Who lead singer Roger Daltrey mentions Henry in the tribute song \"Highbury Highs\", which he performed at Arsenal's last game at Highbury on 7 May 2006.[173] On 10 December 2011, Arsenal unveiled a bronze statue of Henry at the Emirates Stadium as part of its 125th anniversary celebrations.[174] In 2017, *FourFourTwo* magazine ranked him first in their list of the 30 best strikers in Premier League history.[175] Daniel Girard of *The Toronto Star* described Henry as \"one of the best players of his generation\" in 2010.[176] Henry's former Arsenal manager, Wenger, described him as \"one of the greatest players [he had] ever seen\" in 2014.[177] In 2019, *The Independent* ranked Henry in first place in their list of the \"100 greatest Premier League players\".[178]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Henry in 2007\nHenry married English model Nicole Merry, real name Claire, on 5 July 2003.[13] The ceremony was held at Highclere Castle, and on 27 May 2005 the couple celebrated the birth of their first child.[179] Henry dedicated his first goal following T\u00e9a's birth to her by holding his fingers in a \"T\" shape and kissing them after scoring in a match against Newcastle United.[180] When Henry was still at Arsenal, he also purchased a home in Hampstead, North London.[13]\n\n\nHowever, shortly after his transfer to Barcelona, it was announced that Henry and his wife would divorce; the decree nisi was granted in September 2007,[181] \"on the basis of his behavior.\"[182] Their separation concluded in December 2008 when Henry paid Merry a divorce settlement close to her requested sum of \u00a310\u00a0million.[183]\n\n\nHenry has been with his wife, Andrea Raja\u010di\u0107, since 2011.[184] They have three children together.[185]\n\n\n\n### Interest in basketball[edit]\n\n\nAs a fan of the National Basketball Association (NBA), Henry is often seen with his friend Tony Parker at games when not playing football. Henry stated in an interview that he admires basketball, as it is similar to football in pace and excitement.[186] Having made regular trips to the NBA Finals in the past, he went to watch Parker and the San Antonio Spurs in the 2007 NBA Finals;[187] and in the 2001 NBA Finals, he went to Philadelphia to help with French television coverage of the Finals as well as to watch Allen Iverson, whom he named as one of his favourite players.[186]\n\n\n\n### Appearance on screen[edit]\n\n\nHenry makes a short cameo appearance in the 2015 film *Entourage*. Henry's part sees him walking a dog and having exchange with Ari Gold (character played by Jeremy Piven), who is an over-the-top Hollywood agent.[188] He makes a number of cameo appearances playing himself in the Apple TV+ football comedy series *Ted Lasso*.[189]\n\n\nHenry makes a number of appearances in the Amazon Original sports docuseries *All or Nothing: Arsenal*, which documented the club by spending time with the coaching staff and players behind the scenes both on and off the field throughout their 2021\u201322 season.[190]\n\n\n\n### Social causes[edit]\n\n\nHenry is a member of the UNICEF-FIFA squad, where together with other professional footballers he appeared in a series of TV spots seen by hundreds of millions of fans around the world during the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups. In these spots, the players promote football as a game that must be played on behalf of children.[84]\n\n\n\n![](image)Henry speaking against online bullying at the Web Summit in 2021\nHaving been subjected to racism in the past, Henry is an active spokesperson against racism in football. The most prominent incident of racism against Henry was during a training session with the Spanish national team in 2004,[191][192] when a Spanish TV crew caught coach Luis Aragon\u00e9s referring to Henry as \"black shit\" to Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes, Henry's teammate at Arsenal.[180] The incident caused an uproar in the British media, and there were calls for Aragon\u00e9s to be sacked.[193] Henry and Nike started the Stand Up Speak Up campaign against racism in football as a result of the incident.[194] Subsequently, in 2007, *Time* featured him as one of the \"Heroes & Pioneers\" on the *Time* 100 list of the most influential people in the world.[195]\n\n\nAlong with 45 other football players, Henry took part in FIFA's \"Live for Love United\" in 2002. The single was released in tandem with the 2002 FIFA World Cup and its proceeds went towards AIDS research.[196] Henry also supports the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and Cystic Fibrosis Trust.[197]\n\n\nHenry has also played in charity football games for various causes. In June 2018, he reunited with his France 1998 World Cup winning teammates to play a charity game against an All-Star team which included Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, with proceeds going to the Mecenet Cardiac Charity and the Children of the World fund. In a 3\u20132 win for France, Henry played a trademark no-look one-two pass with Zinedine Zidane before scoring with a 20-yard curling strike.[122]\n\n\n\n### Commercial endorsements[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Henry was valued as the ninth-most commercially marketable footballer in the world, and throughout his career he has signed many endorsements and appeared in commercials.[198]\n\n\n\n#### Sportswear[edit]\n\n\nAt the beginning of his career, Henry signed with sportswear giant Nike. In the buildup to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, Henry featured in Nike's \"Secret Tournament\" advertisement, directed by Terry Gilliam, along with 24 superstar football players.[199][200] In a 2004 advertisement, Henry pits his wits against others footballers in locations such as his bedroom and living room, which was partly inspired by Henry himself, who revealed that he always has a football nearby, even at home.[201] In tandem with the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Henry also featured in Nike's *Joga Bonito* campaign, Portuguese for \"beautiful game\".[202]\n\n\nHenry's deal with Nike ended after the 2006 FIFA World Cup, when he signed a deal with Reebok to appear in their \"I Am What I Am\" campaign.[203] As part of Reebok Entertainment's \"Framed\" series, Henry was the star of a half-hour episode that detailed the making of a commercial about himself directed by Spanish actress Paz Vega.[204] In 2011, Henry switched to Puma boots.[205]\n\n\n\n#### Others[edit]\n\n\nHenry featured in the Renault Clio advertisements in which he popularised the term *va-va-voom*, meaning \"life\" or \"passion\". His romantic interest in the commercial was his then-girlfriend, later his wife (now divorced), Claire Merry. *\"Va-va-voom\"* was subsequently added to the *Concise Oxford English Dictionary*.[206]\n\n\nIn February 2007, Henry was named as one of the three global ambassadors of Gillette's \"Champions Program\", which purported to feature three of the \"best-known, most widely respected and successful athletes competing today\" and also showcased Roger Federer and Tiger Woods in a series of television commercials.[36][207] In reaction to the handball controversy following the France vs Ireland 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier, Gillette faced a boycott and accusations of doctoring French versions of their Champions poster, but subsequently released a statement backing Henry.[208][209]\n\n\nHenry was part of Pepsi's \"Dare For More\" campaign in 2005, alongside the likes of David Beckham and Ronaldinho.[210] He starred in a 2014 advert for Beats headphones with other global football stars including Neymar and Luis Su\u00e1rez, with the theme of \"The Game Before the Game\" and the players pre-game ritual of listening to music.[211]\n\n\nHenry featured on the front cover of the editions of EA Sports' *FIFA* video game series from *FIFA 2001* to *FIFA 2005*.[212][213] He was included as an icon to the Ultimate Team in *FIFA 18*.[214] He was also a cover star for the Konami *Pro Evolution Soccer* video game series, and was featured on the covers of *Pro Evolution Soccer 4* to *Pro Evolution Soccer 6*.[215]\n\n\n\n### Other interests[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Serie B club Como announced Henry was joining them as an investor and minority stakeholder.[216]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Club[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAppearances and goals by

Founded in 1880 as **St. Mark's (West Gorton)**, they became **Ardwick Association Football Club** in 1887 and *Manchester City* in 1894. The club's home ground is the City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, to which they moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. Manchester City adopted their sky blue home shirts in 1894, in the first season with the current name.[4] Over the course of its history, the club has won nine league titles, seven FA Cups, eight League Cups, six FA Community Shields, one UEFA Champions League, one European Cup Winners' Cup, and one UEFA Super Cup.\n\n\nThe club joined the Football League in 1892, and won their first major honour, the FA Cup, in 1904. Manchester City had its first major period of success in the late 1960s and early 1970s, winning the league title, FA Cup, League Cup, and European Cup Winners Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup final, Manchester City went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in their history in 1998. They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001\u201302 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002\u201303.\n\n\nManchester City received considerable financial investment both in playing staff and facilities following its takeover by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan through the Abu Dhabi United Group in August 2008.[5] This started a new era of unprecedented success, with the club winning the FA Cup in 2011 and the Premier League in 2012, both their first since the 1960s, followed by another league title in 2014. Under the management of Pep Guardiola, Manchester City won the Premier League in 2018, becoming the only team in the competition history to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2018\u201319, they won four trophies, completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic titles in England and becoming the first English men's team to win the domestic treble.[6] This was followed by three consecutive Premier League titles in 2020\u201321, 2021\u201322, and 2022\u201323, as well as the club's first-ever Champions League final in 2021, which they lost to Chelsea. The 2022\u201323 season saw Manchester City win their maiden European Cup and complete the continental treble in the process, becoming the second English club to do so.[7] The club is ranked first in the UEFA coefficient standings as of 2023.[8]\n\n\nManchester City topped the Deloitte Football Money League at the end of the 2021\u201322 season, making it the football club with the highest revenue in the world, approximated at \u20ac731\u00a0million.[9] In 2022, *Forbes* estimated the club was the sixth-most valuable in the world, worth $4.250\u00a0billion.[10][11] Manchester City are owned by City Football Group Limited, a holding company valued at \u00a33.73 ($4.8) billion in November 2019 and majority-owned by the Abu Dhabi United Group.[12][13]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Manchester City F.C.\n\n### Early years and first trophies[edit]\n\n\n![Fifteen men posing across three rows. Eleven of the men are wearing a football kit with a Maltese Cross on the breast. The other four are wearing suits and top hats.](image)St. Marks (Gorton) in 1884\u00a0\u2013 the reason for the cross patt\u00e9e on the shirts is now unknown.[14]\nCity gained their first honours by winning the Second Division in 1899; with it came promotion to the highest level in English football, the First Division. They went on to claim their first major honour on 23 April 1904, beating Bolton Wanderers 1\u20130 at Crystal Palace to win the FA Cup; the Blues narrowly missed out on a League and Cup double that season after finishing runners-up in the league campaign, but they still became the first club in Manchester to win a major honour.[15] In the seasons following the FA Cup triumph, the club was dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain Billy Meredith, who subsequently moved across town to Manchester United.[16] A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side.[17]\n\n\n\n![A group of thirteen men, eleven in association football attire typical of the early twentieth century, and two in suits. A trophy sits in front of them.](image)The Manchester City team which won the FA Cup in 1903\u201304.\nIn the 1930s, Manchester City reached two consecutive FA Cup finals, losing to Everton in 1933, before claiming the Cup by beating Portsmouth in 1934.[18] During the 1934 run, the club broke the record for the highest home attendance of any club in English football history, as 84,569 fans packed Maine Road for a sixth-round FA Cup tie against Stoke City \u2013 a record which stood until 2016.[19][20] The club won the First Division title for the first time in 1937, but were relegated the following season, despite scoring more goals than any other team in the division.[21] Twenty years later, a City team inspired by a tactical system known as the Revie Plan reached consecutive FA Cup finals again, in 1955 and 1956; just as in the 1930s, they lost the first one, to Newcastle United, and won the second. The 1956 final, in which the Blues defeated Birmingham City 3\u20131, saw City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann continuing to play on after unknowingly breaking his neck.[22]\n\n\n\n### First golden era and subsequent decline[edit]\n\n\nAfter being relegated to the Second Division in 1963, the future looked bleak with a record low home attendance of 8,015 against Swindon Town in January 1965.[23] In the summer of 1965, the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison was appointed. In the first season under Mercer, Manchester City won the Second Division title and made important signings in Mike Summerbee and Colin Bell.[24] Two seasons later, in 1967\u201368, City claimed the league championship for the second time, beating their close neighbours Manchester United to the title on the final day of the season with a 4\u20133 victory at Newcastle United.[25] Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in 1969 and a year later triumphed in the European Cup Winners' Cup, defeating G\u00f3rnik Zabrze 2\u20131 in the 1970 final. This was the club's only European honour until their triumph in the 2022\u201323 UEFA Champions League.[26] The Blues also won the League Cup that year, becoming the second English team to win a European trophy and a domestic trophy in the same season.\n\n\nThe club continued to challenge for honours throughout the 1970s, finishing one point behind the league champions on two occasions and reaching the final of the 1974 League Cup.[27] One of the matches from this period that is most fondly remembered by supporters of Manchester City is the final match of the 1973\u201374 season against arch-rivals Manchester United, who needed to win to have any hope of avoiding relegation. Former United player Denis Law scored with a backheel to give City a 1\u20130 win at Old Trafford and confirm the relegation of their rivals.[28][29] The final trophy of the club's most successful period of the 20th century was won in 1976, when Newcastle United were beaten 2\u20131 in the League Cup final.\n\n\n\n![](image)Chart of yearly table positions of City in the Football League\nA long period of decline followed the success of the 1960s and 1970s. Malcolm Allison rejoined the club to become manager for the second time in 1979, but squandered large sums of money on several unsuccessful signings, such as Steve Daley.[30] A succession of managers then followed \u2013 seven in the 1980s alone. Under John Bond, City reached the 1981 FA Cup final but lost in a replay to Tottenham Hotspur. The club were twice relegated from the top flight in the 1980s (in 1983 and 1987), but returned to the top flight again in 1989 and finished fifth in 1991 and 1992 under the management of Peter Reid.[31] However, this was only a temporary respite, and following Reid's departure Manchester City's fortunes continued to fade. City were co-founders of the Premier League upon its creation in 1992, but after finishing ninth in its first season they endured three years of struggle before being relegated in 1996. After two seasons in the First Division,[a] City fell to the lowest point in their history, becoming the second ever European trophy winners to be relegated to their country's third-tier league after 1. FC Magdeburg of Germany.\n\n\n\n### Recovery and two takeovers[edit]\n\n\nAfter relegation, the club underwent off-the-field upheaval, with new chairman David Bernstein introducing greater fiscal discipline.[32] Under manager Joe Royle, City were promoted at the first attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in the Second Division play-off final against Gillingham.[33] A second successive promotion saw City return to the top division, but this proved to have been a step too far for the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated once more. Kevin Keegan replaced Royle as manager in the close season, and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the 2001\u201302 First Division championship, breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored in a single season in the process.[34] The 2002\u201303 season was the last at Maine Road and included a 3\u20131 derby victory over rivals Manchester United, ending a 13-year run without a derby win.[35] Additionally, City qualified for European competition for the first time in 25 years via UEFA fair play ranking. In the close 2003\u201304 season, the club moved to the new City of Manchester Stadium. The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in mid-table finishes. Former England manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson became the club's first foreign manager when appointed in 2007.[36] After a bright start, performances faded in the second half of the season, and Eriksson was sacked on 2 June 2008;[37] he was replaced by Mark Hughes two days later.[38]\n\n\nBy 2008, Manchester City were in a financially precarious position. Thaksin Shinawatra had taken control of the club the year before, but his political travails saw his assets frozen.[39] Then, in August 2008, City were purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group. The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid for \u00a332.5\u00a0million.[40] There was not a huge improvement in performance compared to the previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team finishing tenth, although they did well to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an outlay of over \u00a3100\u00a0million on players Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz, Kolo Tour\u00e9, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez, and Joleon Lescott.[41] In December 2009, Mark Hughes \u2013 who had been hired shortly before the change in ownership but was originally retained by the new board \u2013 was replaced as manager by Roberto Mancini.[42] City finished the season in fifth position in the Premier League, narrowly missing out on a place in the Champions League but qualifying for the UEFA Europa League.[43]\n\n\n\n### Second golden era and arrival of Pep Guardiola[edit]\n\n\nContinued investment in players followed in successive seasons, and results began to match the upturn in player quality. City reached the FA Cup final in 2011, their first major final in over 30 years, after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-finals,[44] the first time they had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since 1975. The Blues defeated Stoke City 1\u20130 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup and the club's first major trophy since winning the 1976 League Cup. On the last day of the 2010\u201311 season, City beat out Arsenal for the third place, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)Manchester City supporters invade the pitch following their 2011\u201312 Premier League title victory.\nStrong performances continued to follow in the 2011\u201312 season, including a 5\u20131 victory over Tottenham at White Hart Lane and a record-equalling 6\u20131 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, but a poor run of form in the second half of the season left City in second place, eight points behind United with only six games left to play. At this point, United suffered their own loss of form, dropping eight points in the space of four games, while City began a run of successive wins which saw both teams level on points with two games to go. Despite the Blues only needing a home win against Queens Park Rangers, a team in the relegation zone, they fell 1\u20132 behind by the end of normal time. However, two goals in injury time \u2013 the second by Sergio Ag\u00fcero in the fourth added minute \u2013 settled the title in City's favour, making them the first team to win the Premier League on goal difference alone.[46]\n\n\nThe following season, City were unable to replicate the previous year's success. After finishing second in the league, eleven points behind Manchester United, and losing the FA Cup final 0\u20131 to relegated Wigan Athletic,[47] Mancini was sacked.[48] He was replaced by Chilean manager Manuel Pellegrini.[49] In Pellegrini's first year in charge, City won the League Cup and regained the Premier League title on the last matchday of the season.[50][51] The team's league form then slowly declined over the next couple of years, as the Blues finished second in 2014\u201315 and then dropped to fourth in 2015\u201316, although the 2015\u201316 season would see City win another League Cup title and reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time.[52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Manchester City moved into their new complex at the Etihad Campus adjacent to the City of Manchester Stadium in 2014.\nPep Guardiola, former head coach of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, was confirmed to become Manchester City's new manager on 1 February 2016,[53] with the announcement having been made several months before Manuel Pellegrini left his position. Guardiola's first season in Manchester would end trophyless, with the Blues placing third in the league standings,[54] but the following season proved far more successful, as City won the Premier League title with the highest points total in history and broke numerous other club and English league records along the way.[55]\n\n\nThis would prove to be the start of a period of unprecedented success for Manchester City under Guardiola. Between the 2017\u201318 and 2022\u201323 Premier League seasons, City won five out of possible six league titles, only finishing second behind Liverpool in the 2019\u201320 season.[56] Guardiola also guided the Blues to silverware in domestic cup competitions, highlighted by four consecutive League Cup triumphs in 2018\u20132021.[57] During the 2018\u201319 season, City completed an unprecedented domestic treble of English men's titles.[58] Apart from winning all three of the major English football tournaments, they also won the Community Shield, the first time any team has ever held all four of England's primary football trophies at the same time.[59] On the continental stage, the club achieved breakthrough in 2020\u201321, reaching their first-ever Champions League final.[60] In an all-English affair, City lost 0\u20131 to Chelsea at the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o in Porto.[61]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Manchester City team, with mascots, about to face Southampton in the 2022\u201323 Premier League.

The road to the Champions League victory included wins over European giants Bayern Munich, who were defeated 4\u20131 on aggregate,[62] and Real Madrid, who suffered a 1\u20135 aggregate loss at the hands of City.[63][64][65]\n\n\nManchester City's era of sustained competitive excellence coincided with charges of breaching Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. In 2020, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that sanctions placed on the club by UEFA were not justified, overturning City's two-year European ban.[66] In 2023, the Premier League announced its own investigation of the allegations levied against Manchester City, charging the club with 115 breaches of its FFP rules up to the 2017\u201318 season.[67]\n\n\n\n### League history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * 1892\u20131899 Division 2 (L2)\n* 1899\u20131902 Division 1 (L1)\n* 1902\u20131903 Division 2 (L2)\n* 1903\u20131909 Division 1 (L1)\n* 1909\u20131910 Division 2 (L2)\n | * 1910\u20131926 Division 1 (L1)\n* 1926\u20131928 Division 2 (L2)\n* 1928\u20131938 Division 1 (L1)\n* 1938\u20131947 Division 2 (L2)\n* 1947\u20131950 Division 1 (L1)\n | * 1950\u20131951 Division 2 (L2)\n* 1951\u20131963 Division 1 (L1)\n* 1963\u20131966 Division 2 (L2)\n* 1966\u20131983 Division 1 (L1)\n* 1983\u20131985 Division 2 (L2)\n | * 1985\u20131987 Division 1 (L1)\n* 1987\u20131989 Division 2 (L2)\n* 1989\u20131992 Division 1 (L1)\n* 1992\u20131996 Premier League (L1)\n* 1996\u20131998 Division 1 (L2)\n | * 1998\u20131999 Division 2 (L3)\n* 1999\u20132000 Division 1 (L2)\n* 2000\u20132001 Premier League (L1)\n* 2001\u20132002 Division 1 (L2)\n* 2002\u2013 Premier League (L1)\n |\n\n\nL1 = Level 1 of the football league system; L2 = Level 2 of the football league system; L3 = Level 3 of the football league system.\n\n## Club badge and colours[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Manchester City's stadium and shirt have been sponsored by Etihad Airways since 2009.\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Manchester City F.C. kits.\n\nManchester City's home colours are sky blue and white. Traditional away kit colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, in recent years several colours have been used. The origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but there is evidence that the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled *Famous Football Clubs \u2013 Manchester City* published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side.[68] The infrequent yet recurrent use of red and black away colours comes from former assistant manager Malcolm Allison's belief that adopting the colours of AC Milan would inspire City to glory.[69] Allison's theory seemingly took effect, with City winning the 1969 FA Cup final, 1970 League Cup final, and 1970 Cup Winners' Cup final in red and black stripes as opposed to the club's home kit of sky blue.\n\n\nCity had previously worn three other badges on their shirts, prior to their current badge being implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the present badge (including a ship, based on the City of Manchester coat of arms), inside a circle bearing the name of the club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced the lower half of the shield with the red rose of Lancashire. In 1976, a heraldic badge was granted by the College of Arms to the English Football League for use by City. The badge consisted of the familiar ship above a red rose but on a circular device instead of a shield (blazoned as \"*A roundel per fess azure and argent in chief a three masted ship sails set pennons flying or in base a rose gules barbed and seeded proper*\").[70]\n\n\nOn occasions when Manchester City played in a major cup final, the club wore shirts bearing the City of Manchester coat of arms, as a symbol of pride in representing the city at a major event. This practice originated from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind.[71] The club has since abandoned the practice; for the 2011 FA Cup final, its first in the 21st century, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.[72]\n\n\nA new club badge was adopted in 1997, as a result of the previous badge being ineligible for registration as a trademark. This badge was based on the arms of the city of Manchester, and consisted of a shield in front of a golden eagle. The eagle is an old heraldic symbol of the city of Manchester; a golden eagle was added to the city's badge in 1958 (but had since been removed), representing the growing aviation industry. The shield featured a ship on its upper half representing the Manchester Ship Canal, and three diagonal stripes in the lower half symbolised the city's three rivers \u2013 the Irwell, the Irk and the Medlock. The bottom of the badge bore the motto \"*Superbia in Proelio*\", which translates as \"Pride in Battle\" in Latin. Above the eagle and shield were the three stars, added for decorative purposes.\n\n\nOn 15 October 2015, following years of criticism from the fans over the design of the 1997 badge,[73] the club announced they intended to carry out a fan consultation on whether to discontinue the current badge and institute a new design.[73] After the consultation, the club announced in late November 2015 the badge would be replaced in due course by a new version which would be designed in the style of the older, circular variants.[74] A design purporting to be the new badge was unintentionally leaked two days early prior to the official unveiling on 26 December 2015 by the IPO when the design was trademarked on 22 December.[75] The new badge was officially unveiled at Manchester City's home match against Sunderland on 26 December.[76]\n\n\n\n### Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Period\n | Kit supplier\n | Shirt sponsor (chest)\n | Shirt sponsor (sleeve)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1974\u20131982\n | Umbro | *No sponsor* | *No sponsor* |\n| 1982\u20131984\n | Saab |\n| 1984\u20131987\n | Philips |\n| 1987\u20131997\n | Brother |\n| 1997\u20131999\n | Kappa |\n| 1999\u20132002\n | Le Coq Sportif | Eidos |\n| 2002\u20132003\n | First Advice\n |\n| 2003\u20132004\n | Reebok |\n| 2004\u20132007\n | Thomas Cook |\n| 2007\u20132009\n | Le Coq Sportif |\n| 2009\u20132013\n | Umbro | Etihad Airways |\n| 2013\u20132017\n | Nike |\n| 2017\u20132019\n | Nexen Tire |\n| 2019\u20132023\n | Puma |\n| 2023\u2013present\n | OKX |\n\n\n### Kit deals[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier\n | Period\n | Announcement date\n | Intended contract duration\n | Value\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Le Coq Sportif\n | 2007\u20132009\n | 13 May 2007[77]\n | 2007\u20132011 (4 years)\n | Around \u00a32.5m per year[78] | Replaced by Umbro contract\n |\n| Umbro\n | 2009\u20132013\n | 4 June 2009\n | 2009\u20132019 (10 years)\n | Around \u00a32.5m per year[79] | Umbro contract transferred to parent company Nike in 2013\n |\n| Nike\n | 2013\u20132019\n | 4 May 2012\n | 2013\u20132019 (6 years)\n | Around \u00a320m per year[80] |  |\n| Puma\n | 2019\u20132029\n | 28 February 2019\n | 2019\u20132029 (10 years)\n | Around \u00a365m per year[81] |  |\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Manchester City F.C. players\n\n### First-team squad[edit]\n\n\n*As of 17 November 2023*[82]\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Even in the late 1990s, when City were relegated twice in three seasons and playing in the third tier of English football (then the Second Division, now the EFL League One), home attendances were in the region of 30,000, compared to an average of fewer than 8,000 for the division.[120] Research carried out by Manchester City in 2005 estimated a fanbase of 886,000 in the United Kingdom and a total in excess of 2 million worldwide, although since the purchase of the club by Sheikh Mansour, and City's recent achievements, that figure has since ballooned to many times that size.[121]\n\n\nManchester City's officially recognised supporters club is the Manchester City F.C. Supporters Club (1949), formed by a merger of two existing organisations in 2010: the Official Supporters Club (OSC) and the Centenary Supporters Association (CSA).[122] City fans' song of choice is a rendition of \"Blue Moon\", which despite its melancholic theme is belted out with gusto as though it were a heroic anthem. City supporters tend to believe that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team, and label unexpected results \"typical City\".[123][124] Events that fans regard as \"typical City\" include the club being the only reigning English champions ever to be relegated (in 1938), the only team to score and concede over 100 goals in the same season (1957\u201358),[125] or the more recent example where Manchester City were the only team to beat Chelsea in the latter's record-breaking 2004\u201305 Premier League season, yet in the same season City were knocked out of the FA Cup by Oldham Athletic, a team two divisions lower.\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, City fans started a craze of bringing inflatable objects to matches, primarily oversized bananas. One disputed explanation for the phenomenon is that in a match against West Bromwich Albion, chants from fans calling for the introduction of Imre Varadi as a substitute mutated into \"Imre Banana\". Terraces packed with inflatable-waving supporters became a frequent sight in the 1988\u201389 season, as the craze spread to other clubs (inflatable fish were seen at Grimsby Town), with the craze reaching its peak at City's match at Stoke City on 26 December 1988, a game declared by fanzines as a fancy dress party.[126] In 2010, Manchester City supporters adopted an exuberant dance, dubbed The Pozna\u0144, from fans of Polish club Lech Pozna\u0144 that they played in the Europa League.[127] In 2022, Manchester City proposed the release of the Connected Scarf, that would contain a sensor tracking physiological and emotional data of the wearer, for supporters in 2023.[128]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Manchester derby and Liverpool F.C.\u2013Manchester City F.C. rivalry\n\n![](image)The Manchester derby in the Premier League, 6 November 2021\nManchester City's biggest rivalry is with neighbours Manchester United, against whom they contest the Manchester derby. Before the Second World War, when travel to away games was rare, many Mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves \"supporters\" of only one. This practice continued into the early 1960s but as travel became easier, and the cost of entry to matches rose, watching both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified. A common stereotype is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from elsewhere. A 2002 report by a researcher at Manchester Metropolitan University found that while it was true that a higher proportion of City season ticket holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481). The report noted that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders had risen; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further.[129]\n\n\nOver the last few years, Manchester City has also developed a notable rivalry with Liverpool,[130] currently considered one of the biggest in association football.[131][132] Though the two clubs had been involved in a title race in the 1976\u201377 season, Liverpool and City's modern rivalry began in the 2010s, with the Blues beating Liverpool to the 2013\u201314 title by just two points on the final day of the season.[133] In the final of the 2015\u201316 League Cup, City defeated Liverpool on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw. The two clubs met in European competition for the first time in the 2017\u201318 Champions League quarter-finals, where Liverpool won 5\u20131 on aggregate, ultimately reaching the final and then winning the competition a year later.[134][135] In the 2018\u201319 season, City again won the title on the final day, with the Blues' 98 points and Liverpool's 97 being the third- and fourth-highest Premier League points totals ever.[136] The following season, Liverpool clinched the title, recording 99 points (the second-highest Premier League total ever after Manchester City's 100 in 2017\u201318) to finish 18 points above runners-up City. The Blues then regained the title in 2020\u201321 and outgunned Liverpool in another closely-fought title race in 2021\u201322, to finish with 93 points to Liverpool's 92.\n\n\nThe success of the two teams in the 2010s and 2020s has led to the development of a rivalry between J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola, the managers of Liverpool and Manchester City, with the two previously having been the respective managers of *Der Klassiker* rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga.[137] At the end of the 2018\u201319 season, Guardiola described his relationship with Klopp as a \"beautiful rivalry\" and called Klopp's Liverpool team \"the strongest opponents I have faced in my career as a manager\".[138][139] In September 2019, Klopp hailed Guardiola for being his 'greatest rival ever', after both were nominated for the FIFA Men's Coach of the Year award in 2019, which Klopp ultimately won.[140][141] In a 2019 survey, City fans answered that Liverpool, and not Manchester United, are the club's biggest rivals.[142]\n\n\nManchester City also have long established local rivalries with Bolton Wanderers, Oldham Athletic, and Stockport County, and more recent competitive Premier League rivalries with Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea.[143][144]\n\n\n\n## Ownership and finances[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Manchester City F.C. ownership and finances\n\nThe holding company of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, is a private limited company, with approximately 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed to sell their holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. UKSIL then made a formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousands of small shareholders.\n\n\nPrior to the Thaksin takeover, the club was listed on the specialist independent equity market PLUS (formerly OFEX),[145] where it had been listed since 1995. On 6 July 2007, having acquired 75% of the shares, Thaksin de-listed the club and re-registered it as a private company.[146] By August, UKSIL had acquired over 90% of the shares and exercised its rights under the Companies Act to \"squeeze out\" the remaining shareholders, and acquire the entire shareholding. Thaksin Shinawatra became chairman of the club and two of Thaksin's children, Pintongta and Oak Chinnawat became directors. Former chairman John Wardle stayed on the board for a year, but resigned in July 2008 following Nike executive Garry Cook's appointment as executive chairman in May.[147] The club made a pre-tax loss of \u00a311m in the fiscal year ending 31 May 2007, the final year for which the club published accounts as a public company.[148]\n\n\nThaksin's purchase prompted a period of transfer spending at the club,[149] in total around \u00a330\u00a0million,[150] whereas over the several previous seasons Manchester City's net spending had been among the lowest in the Premier League. A year later, this investment was dwarfed by an influx of money derived from the club's takeover. On 1 September 2008, Abu Dhabi-based Abu Dhabi United Group Investment and Development Limited completed the takeover of Manchester City. The deal, worth a reported \u00a3200\u00a0million, was announced on the morning of 1 September. It sparked various transfer \"deadline-day\" rumours and bids such as the club's attempt to gazump Manchester United's protracted bid to sign Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in excess of \u00a330\u00a0million.[151][152] Minutes before the transfer window closed, the club signed Robinho from Real Madrid for a British record transfer fee of \u00a332.5\u00a0million.[153] The wealth of the new owners meant that, in the summer of 2009, City were able to finance the purchase of experienced international players prior to the new season, spending more than any other club in the Premier League.[154]\n\n\n\n### City Football Group[edit]\n\n\nMain article: City Football Group\n\nCreated in the 2013\u201314 season to manage the global footballing interests of the Abu Dhabi United Group, City Football Group (CFG) is an umbrella corporation owning stakes in a network of global clubs for the purposes of resource sharing, academy networking and marketing.\n\n\n\n#### CFG ownership[edit]\n\n\n\n\nClubs owned by CFGListed in order of acquisition/foundation.\n  \nBold indicates the club was founded by CFG.  \n\\* indicates the club was acquired by CFG.  \n\u00a7 indicates the club is co-owned.\n| 2008 | Manchester City F.C.\\* |\n| 2009\u20132012 |\n| 2013 | **New York City FC**\u00a7 |\n| 2014 | Melbourne City FC\\* |\n| Yokohama F.

It has been the club's home since the end of the 2002\u201303 season, when City moved from **Maine Road**.[169] Before moving to the stadium, the club spent in excess of \u00a330\u00a0million to convert it to football use: the pitch was lowered, adding another tier of seating around it, and a new North Stand was constructed.[170] The inaugural match at the new stadium was a 2\u20131 win over Barcelona in a friendly match.[171] A 7,000-seat third tier on the South Stand was completed in time for the start of the 2015\u201316 football season, increasing the stadium's capacity to 55,097. A North Stand third tier is in development, potentially increasing capacity to around 61,000.[172]\n\n\nAfter playing home matches at five stadiums between 1880 and 1887, the club settled at **Hyde Road Football Stadium**, its home for 36 years.[173] A fire destroyed the Main Stand in 1920, and the club moved to the 84,000 capacity Maine Road three years later. Maine Road, nicknamed the \"Wembley of the North\" by its designers, hosted the largest-ever crowd at an English club ground when 84,569 attended an FA Cup tie against Stoke City on 3 March 1934.[174] Though Maine Road was redeveloped several times over its 80-year lifespan, by 1995 its capacity was restricted to 32,000, prompting the search for a new ground which culminated in the move to the City of Manchester Stadium in 2003; it was renamed the Etihad Stadium in 2011.[175]\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Manchester City F.C. records and statistics \u00a7\u00a0Club honours\n\nBased on trophy count, Manchester City are one of the most successful teams in England \u2013 their thirty-three major domestic and European honours rank them fifth on the list of most decorated sides in England, ahead of Tottenham Hotspur with 26 and behind Chelsea with 34.\n\n\nThe club's first major trophy was the 1904 FA Cup,[176] though they had previously won three regional Manchester Cups before that point.[177] Their first top division league title came in the 1936\u201337 season,[14] with the first Charity Shield won in the following August.[14] City's first League Cup and European trophy both came at the end of the 1969\u201370 season, the two trophies also constituting the team's first double of any kind.[14] In the 2018\u201319 season, City became the first team to claim all of the major English trophies available in a single season, winning not just the Premier League, FA Cup, and League Cup, but also the Community Shield.[178]\n\n\nThe 1970 Cup Winners' Cup victory remained City's only European trophy until their triumph in the 2022\u201323 UEFA Champions League.[179][65] They have reached the semi-finals of the Champions League four times overall, losing in 2016, then winning en route to their first-ever final in 2021, losing in 2022, and winning en route to their maiden European Cup title in 2023.[180][181]\n\n\nManchester City jointly hold the record for most second division titles with Leicester City, both clubs having won the league on seven occasions.[182] Their first victory was in 1898\u201399, and the most recent in 2001\u201302.[14]\n\n\n\n### Domestic[edit]\n\n\n#### Leagues[edit]\n\n\n* **First Division / Premier League** (Level 1)[a]\n\t+ **Winners (9):** 1936\u201337, 1967\u201368, 2011\u201312, 2013\u201314, 2017\u201318, 2018\u201319, 2020\u201321, 2021\u201322, 2022\u201323\n\t+ Runners-up (6): 1903\u201304, 1920\u201321, 1976\u201377, 2012\u201313, 2014\u201315, 2019\u201320\n* **Second Division / First Division / Championship** (Level 2)[a]\n\t+ **Winners (7, shared record):** 1898\u201399, 1902\u201303, 1909\u201310, 1927\u201328, 1946\u201347, 1965\u201366, 2001\u201302\n\t+ Runners-up (4): 1895\u201396, 1950\u201351, 1988\u201389, 1999\u20132000\n\t+ Promoted third place (1): 1984\u201385\n* **Third Division / Second Division / League One** (Level 3)[a]\n\t+ Promoted third place (1): 1998\u201399\n\n\n#### Cups[edit]\n\n\n* **FA Cup**\n\t+ **Winners (7):** 1903\u201304, 1933\u201334, 1955\u201356, 1968\u201369, 2010\u201311, 2018\u201319, 2022\u201323\n\t+ Runners-up (5): 1925\u201326, 1932\u201333, 1954\u201355, 1980\u201381, 2012\u201313\n* **Football League Cup / EFL Cup**\n\t+ **Winners (8):** 1969\u201370, 1975\u201376, 2013\u201314, 2015\u201316, 2017\u201318, 2018\u201319, 2019\u201320, 2020\u201321\n\t+ Runners-up (1): 1973\u201374\n* **Full Members' Cup**\n\t+ Runners-up (1): 1985\u201386\n* **FA Charity Shield / FA Community Shield**\n\t+ **Winners (6):** 1937, 1968, 1972, 2012, 2018, 2019\n\t+ Runners-up (9): 1934, 1956, 1969, 1973, 2011, 2014, 2021, 2022, 2023\n\n\n### European[edit]\n\n\n* **UEFA Champions League**\n\t+ **Winners (1):** 2022\u201323\n\t+ Runners-up (1): 2020\u201321\n* **European Cup Winners' Cup**\n\t+ **Winners (1):** 1969\u201370\n* **UEFA Super Cup**\n\t+ **Winners (1):** 2023\n\n\n### Doubles and Trebles[edit]\n\n\n* **Doubles**\n\t+ **League and UEFA Champions League (1):** 2022\u201323\n\t+ **League and FA Cup (2):** 2018\u201319, 2022\u201323\n\t+ **League and League Cup (4):** 2013\u201314, 2017\u201318, 2018\u201319, 2020\u201321\n\t+ **League Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup (1):** 1969\u201370\n* **Continental treble**\n\t+ **League, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League (1):** 2022\u201323\n* **Domestic treble**\n\t+ **League, FA Cup, and League Cup (1):** 2018\u201319[f]\n\n\n### Three-peats[edit]\n\n\n* **Three-peats**\n\t+ **Premier League:** 2020\u201321, 2021\u201322, 2022\u201323\n\t+ **EFL Cup:** 2017\u201318, 2018\u201319, 2019\u201320, 2020\u201321[g]\n\n\n## Club records[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Manchester City F.C. records and statistics\n\n* **Record league victory** \u2013 11\u20133 vs Lincoln City (23 March 1895, most goals scored);

For a more detailed history see History of Everton F.C.\n\n\nThe 98 full seasons in the 20th century were reduced to 87 deducting the war years. Everton competed in 83 top flight seasons in the 20th century, the highest of any club. Everton averaged a top flight position of 8.15. Everton were founder members of the Football League in 1888 and were champions of it for the first time in 1891. By the time World War II broke out in 1939, they had been league champions five times and had fielded some of the biggest names in English football, including goalkeeper Ted Sagar and forwards Dixie Dean and Tommy Lawton. In Everton's title-winning season of 1927\u201328, Dean scored a record 60 league goals in a single season \u2013 which has not been matched in this country since.\n\n\nEverton originally played at Anfield until a dispute with their landlord in 1892 saw the club exit the ground, which was re-occupied by the newly formed Liverpool, who gradually became Everton's fierce local rivals. Everton, meanwhile, settled into nearby Goodison Park, where they have played ever since, in spite of a series of plans since the late 1990s to relocate the club to a new stadium.\n\n\nEverton hold the record of playing most seasons in the top flight of English football, only ever playing four seasons out since the creation of the Football League in 1888. The club have played at the top level continuously since 1954, with only Arsenal having a longer unbroken run at the highest level.\n\n\nAfter World War II, Everton's first major success came in 1963, when the league title was won under the management of Harry Catterick, who added another league title to Everton's honours list in 1970 as well as the FA Cup in 1966.\n\n\nAnother golden era at Everton prevailed after the appointment of Howard Kendall as manager in 1981. Everton won the FA Cup in 1984 and were league champions in 1985, when they also won their first European trophy in the shape of the European Cup Winners' Cup. Another league title followed in 1987.\n\n\nEverton's only major trophy since 1987 came in 1995 when they won the FA Cup under the management of Joe Royle, who like Kendall had been with the club during his playing career. Since the formation of the FA Premier League in 1992, their highest league finish was fourth place in 2005 and on one occasion (1998) they finished one place above the relegation zone, only avoiding relegation on goal difference.\n\n\nThe appointment of David Moyes as manager in 2002 brought something of a turning point in Everton's recent history, as the Scot re-established the club as a regular feature in the top few places of the English league, although he failed to add any silverware, the club being finalists in the 2009 FA Cup Final. Moyes departed in 2013 after 11 years as Everton manager to take charge of Manchester United, being succeeded by Roberto Martinez, who had a promising first season but was sacked after three seasons to be replaced by Ronald Koeman. Koeman was dismissed in October 2017, with the club lying in 18th position in the initial stage of the 2017\u201318 season. Koeman was replaced by Sam Allardyce with the team eventually finishing 8th in the Premier League. Allardyce had his 18-month contract terminated at the end of the season.\n\n\nOn 31 May 2018, Everton appointed Marco Silva, as their new manager. Silva had originally been approached to become the clubs' manager in October 2017, following the dismissal of Ronald Koeman. However, at that stage he was still manager of Watford and subsequently any proposed deal at that time fell through. Silva was replaced at Watford in January 2018, after a bad run of results in the Premier League. Evertons' pursuit of Silva resurfaced after the club parted company with Sam Allardyce.\n\n\nOn 6 December 2019, Silva was dismissed after a poor run of results left the club in the relegation zone. Silva's team had won 24 and lost 24 of their league games under his tenure. On 21 December 2019, Carlo Ancelotti was appointed the club's new manager on a four and a half year contract. However, he would depart the club on 1 June 2021, returning to coach Real Madrid. On 30 June 2021, Rafael Ben\u00edtez was appointed, becoming only the second ever man to manage both Everton and Liverpool. His reign, however, would last for only six months, as he was sacked on 16 January 2022, making him the shortest-serving permanent manager in Everton's history. Frank Lampard replaced him at the end of the month, but he would be sacked as well, lasting barely a year. A week after Lampard's sacking, Sean Dyche was appointed as the new manager.\n\n\n\n\n## Seasons[edit]\n\n\n### 1887\u20131955[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | League statistics\n | Cup results\n | Top scorer(s)\n | Avg.Attend.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| League\n | Tier\n | Pld\n | W\n | D\n | L\n | GD\n | Pts\n | Pos\n | FA Cup | Charity Shield | League\n | Overall\n |\n| 1887\u201388 | *There was no league football until 1888\u201389.* | R2\n | N/A\n | G.

He is regarded as one of the greatest centre-forwards of all time and was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002.[3]\n\n\nBorn in Birkenhead, he began his career at his hometown club Tranmere Rovers before moving on to Everton, the club he had supported as a child. A prolific goalscorer, he was particularly known for having a penchant for scoring goals with his head, courtesy of his elevation and athleticism, as well as his powerful and accurate heading ability, which has led pundits to describe him as one of the greatest aerial specialists of all time.[3][4][5][6] Dean played the majority of his career at Everton before injuries caught up with him and he moved on to new challenges at Notts County, and eventually Sligo Rovers. He is best known for his exploits during the 1927\u201328 season, which saw him score a record 60 league goals. He also scored 18 goals in 16 appearances for England.\n\n\nA statue of Dean was unveiled outside Goodison Park in May 2001. A year later, he became one of 22 players inducted into the inaugural English Football Hall of Fame. In the 1933 FA Cup Final against Manchester City, Dean became the first ever footballer to wear the number 9 shirt.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\nDean was born at 313 Laird Street in Birkenhead, Cheshire, across the River Mersey from Liverpool. Dean's family on both sides hailed from Chester. He was the grandson of Ralph Brett, a train driver who drove the royal train during the reign of George V. Dean grew up as a supporter of Everton thanks to the efforts of his father, William Sr., who took him to a match during the 1914\u20131915 title-winning season.\n\n\nDean's childhood coincided with the First World War, and between the ages of seven and eleven he delivered cow's milk to local families as part of the war effort: \"Well, it was war time you see, so you were grafting all the time. I used to take milk out. I'd be up at half-past four in the morning and go down and get the ponies and the milk floats, then I'd come out to this place in Upton, between Upton and Arrowe Park, and Burgess' Farm was there. We used to collect the milk in the big urns and take it out to people's houses, serving it out of the ladle. And not only that, you had an allotment, and that was in school time. And there was no such thing as pinching and stealing and all that bloody caper. In those days, you were growing all that stuff and you needed it for the war time.\"[8]\n\n\nDean attended Laird Street School,[9] but felt he received no formal education: \"My only lesson was football\u00a0... I used to give the pens out on Friday afternoons\u00a0... the ink, and the chalks. That was the only job I had in school\u00a0... I never had any lessons.\"[8] When he turned eleven he attended Albert (Memorial) Industrial School, a borstal school in Birkenhead, because of the football facilities on offer. The Dean family home had little room for him due to the family's size; Dean was happy with the arrangement, since he could play on the school's football team.[9] Dean falsely told fellow pupils he had been caught stealing, since he wanted to be \"one of the boys\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHe left school at fourteen and worked for Wirral Railway as an apprentice fitter; his father also worked there, and had been working since he was eleven years old[8] for Great Western Railway. The elder Dean later became a train driver before moving to Birkenhead to work for Wirral Railway, to be closer to his future wife (and William Jr.'s mother) Sarah. Dean's father would later retire with the company.[9]\n\n\nDean took a night job so that he could concentrate on his first love, football: \"The other two apprentice fitters, they didn't like the night job because there were too many bloody rats around there, coming out of the Anglo-Oil company and the Vacuum Oil Company \u00a0... rats as big as whippets. So I took their night job, and of course, I could always have a game of football then.\"[8] Dean would kick the trespassing rats against the wall.\n\n\nThe sons of Dean's manager at Wirral Railway were directors of New Brighton, and they were interested in signing Dean. However, Dean told the club he was not interested in signing and instead played for local team Pensby United in Pensby. It was at Pensby United where Dean attracted the attention of a Tranmere Rovers scout.[8]\n\n\n\n### \"Dixie\" nickname[edit]\n\n\nSome said that Dean and his family disliked his nickname, and preferred people to call him \"Bill\" or \"Billy\". The popular theory regarding how Dean acquired his nickname is that he did so in his youth, perhaps due to his dark complexion and hair (which bore a resemblance to people from the Southern United States).[10] In Dean's obituary in *The Times*, Geoffrey Green suggested that the nickname was taken from a \"Dixie\" song that was popular during Dean's childhood; there was \"something of the Uncle Tom about his features\".[11]\n\n\nAlternatively, Tranmere Rovers club historian Gilbert Upton uncovered evidence, verified by Dean's Godmother, that the name \"Dixie\" was a corruption of his childhood nickname, Digsy (acquired from his approach to the children's game of tag, where Dean would dig his fist into a girl's back\u2014 hence \"Digsy\").[12]\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Tranmere Rovers[edit]\n\n\nHe played football for Laird Street School, Moreton Bible Class, Heswall and Pensby United. He then joined the pro ranks with his local club, Tranmere Rovers in November 1923. He was sixteen at the time.\n\n\nWhilst at Tranmere, he was on the receiving end of a tough challenge which resulted in him losing a testicle in a reserve game against Altrincham.[13][14] Immediately following the challenge, a teammate rubbed the area to ease the pain. Dean shouted \"Don't rub 'em, count 'em!\"[15]\n\n\nIn his sixteen months at Tranmere, spanning seasons 1923/24 and 1924/25, he scored 27 goals in 30 league appearances. All 27 were in the second of those two seasons in which he averaged exactly a goal per game. His exploits attracted the interest of many clubs across England, including Arsenal and Newcastle United.[8] Upon leaving Tranmere Rovers, secretary Bert Cooke reneged on an agreement to pay ten percent of the transfer fee to Dean. Dean was paid one percent of the fee, which he gave to his parents (who donated it to Birkenhead General Hospital).\n\n\n\n### Everton[edit]\n\n\nHis father had taken him to a league game at Goodison Park when he was eight years old. It was a dream come true for Dean when Everton secretary Thomas H. McIntosh arranged to meet him at the Woodside Hotel in 1925. Dean was so excited that he ran the 2.5 miles (4.0\u00a0km) distance from his home in north Birkenhead to the riverside to meet him.[8] He signed for Everton in March 1925 having just turned 18.\n\n\nHe later revealed that he expected a \u00a3300 signing fee to be given to his parents when he transferred to Everton. They received only \u00a330, and Tranmere Rovers manager Bert Cooke told him \"that's all the League will allow\". Dean appealed to John McKenna, chairman of the Football Association, but was told \"I'm afraid you've signed, and that's it.\"[8] Dean signed for Everton in March 1925 for \u00a33,000, then a record fee received for any Third Division player, any 18-year old, and any Tranmere Rovers player.[16] He made his debut away to Arsenal, and scored his first Everton goal later that month, at home to Aston Villa.[16] He scored 32 goals in his first full season, 1925-26, benefiting from a change to the offside law.[16] A motorcycling accident at Holywell in north Wales in summer 1926 left Dean with a fractured skull and jaw, and doctors were unsure whether he would be able to play again.[16] In his next game for Everton he scored using his head, leading Evertonians to joke that the doctor left a metal plate in Dean's head. He rejoined the first team in October 1926, scoring in his first game back, away to Leeds United.[16] Dean finished the 1926-27 season with 21 goals from 27 games as Everton avoided relegation by a single place.[16]\n\n\nDean's greatest point of note is that he is still the only player in English football to score 60 league goals in one season (1927\u201328).[17][18] At that season's end he was 21 years old. Middlesbrough's George Camsell, who holds the highest goals-to-games ratio for England, had scored 59 league goals the previous season, although this was in the Second Division.\n\n\nIn that 1927-28 season Everton won the First Division title. When they were relegated to Second Division in 1930 Dean stayed with them. The club went on to immediately win the Second Division in 1931, followed by the First Division again in 1932. They then immediately won the FA Cup in 1933 (in which he scored in the final) \u2013 a sequence unmatched since.\n\n\nIn December 1933, Dean issued a public appeal to have stolen goods returned to him. *The Times* issued a statement: \"Dixie Dean, the Everton and England forward appeals to the thief who robbed him of an international cap and presentation clock to return them. His house in Caldy Road, Walton, Liverpool was entered in his absence over Christmas, and the thief left behind gold watches and jewelry (sic).\"[19] By then, Dean was captain of the side. However, the harsh physical demands of the game (as it was played then) took their toll and he was dropped from the first team in 1937.\n\n\n\n### Later teams[edit]\n\n\nDean went on to play for Notts County for one season, in which he scored three goals in nine games. At age 32, Dean signed for Irish team Sligo Rovers in January 1939 to help the club in their FAI Cup campaign. On his arrival, the railway station in Sligo was said to be filled with locals trying to catch a glimpse of him. Dean scored ten goals in seven games for the club,[20] including five in a 7\u20131 win over Waterford (which remains a club record for the most goals scored in a single game). He also played in four Cup matches, scoring once (in the 1\u20131 final against Shelbourne, who won the replay 1\u20130). Dean's runner-up medal was later stolen from his hotel room; on a return trip to Ireland to watch Rovers 39 years later in the 1978 FAI Cup final, a package was delivered to his hotel room with the medal inside. He is considered a legend at The Showgrounds and is featured in the club's outdoor museum.\n\n\nDean ended his professional playing days with Hurst (now Ashton United) in the Cheshire County League 1939\u201340 season, managing two games (and one goal) before the outbreak of war truncated his career. He made his debut in a 4\u20130 loss to Stalybridge Celtic; 5,600 people attended the game, paying sixpence, earning the club gate receipts of \u00a3140.[21]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\nDean made his debut for the England national football team against British rivals Wales at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham in February 1927, less than a month after his 20th birthday. His final game for England came in a 1\u20130 victory over Ireland in October 1932 at Blackpool's Bloomfield Road, when Dean was 25 years old.\n\n\nDean was involved in the 1927 and 1929 editions of the British Home Championship. During the 1927 edition, Dean scored four goals in his two games for England and scored twice against Scotland at Hampden Park. Despite the loss, the Scots won the competition overall and applauded Dean (who finished the tournament as top scorer). In the 1929 edition, he scored in his only outing against Ireland at Goodison Park.\n\n\nThe only international competitions outside the British Home Championship during Dean's international career were the 1928 and 1936 Olympic Games and the inaugural FIFA World Cup, which took place in 1930; however, neither Great Britain nor England participated. Dean represented England sixteen times, scoring eighteen goals in nine games (including hat-tricks against Belgium and Luxembourg).\n\n\n\n![Dean. arms folded, in 1928 Wix Cigarettes newspaper advertisement](image)Dean in a 1928 newspaper advertisement for Wix Cigarettes\n## Later life and death[edit]\n\n\nDean became a Freemason in 1931 while playing for Everton and England. He was initiated in Randle Holme Lodge, No. 3261, in Birkenhead on 18 February 1931.[22] After retiring, he went on to run the Dublin Packet pub in Chester (Everton and the Dublin Packet commemorate this with memorabilia) and work at Littlewoods football pools as a porter at their Walton Hall Avenue offices, where he was remembered by fellow workers as a quiet, unassuming man.\n\n\nIn January 1972, Dean was admitted to St Catherine's hospital in Birkenhead suffering from the effects of influenza[23] and was released a month later.[24] In November 1976, he had his right leg amputated due to a blood clot; his health was declining, and he became increasingly housebound. Dean died on 1 March 1980 at age 73 after suffering a heart attack at Everton's home ground Goodison Park whilst watching a match against their closest rivals, Liverpool. It was the first time that he had visited Goodison Park in several years, due to ill health. \"He belongs to the company of the supremely great, like Beethoven, Shakespeare and Rembrandt\", said Bill Shankly.[25] His funeral took place at St James' Church on Laird Street (the street where he was born) in Birkenhead.[26] He was survived by his four children: William, Geoffrey, Ralph and Barbara;[27] he outlived his wife Ethel, who died of a heart attack in 1974 after 43 years of marriage.[28]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![Statue of Dean in football kit with ball](image)Dixie Dean statue outside Goodison Park\nDean was an internationally known figure. Military records show that during the Second World War, an Italian prisoner of war was captured by British troops in the Western Desert and told his captors \"fuck your Winston Churchill and fuck your Dixie Dean\".[29] One of the soldiers present was Liverpool-born Patrick Connelly, who later went into show business using the pseudonym \"Bill Dean\".[29]\n\n\nEverton arranged a testimonial for Dean on 7 April 1964. Over 34,000 people saw teams from Scotland and England (composed of players from Everton and Liverpool) compete;[30] The \"Scots\" (with one Englishman and one Welshman) won, 3\u20131.[31]\n\n\nThe match raised \u00a37,000 for Dean.\n\n\n\n\n\nTestimonial team rosters\n| England\n | Scotland\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Rankin | Lawrence |\n| Byrne | Brown |\n| Moran | Thompson (Eng)\n |\n| Harris | Gabriel |\n| Labone | Yeats |\n| Kay | Stevenson |\n| Callaghan | Scott |\n| Stevens | St. John |\n| Pickering | Young |\n| Temple | Vernon (Wal)\n |\n| Morrissey | Wallace |\n\n\nDean's 1933 FA Cup winners medal sold for \u00a318,213 at auction in March 2001.[32] In May 2001 local sculptor Tom Murphy created a statue of Dean, which was erected outside the Park End of Goodison Park at a cost of \u00a375,000 with the inscription \"Footballer, Gentleman, Evertonian\".[33] In 2002, Dean was an inaugural inductee to the English Football Hall of Fame.[34] There is an annual Dixie Dean award, which is given to the Merseyside player of the year; it has been won by players from his former clubs (Tranmere and Everton) and Liverpool.[35]\n\n\nWhen asked if he thought his record of scoring 60 goals in a season would be broken, Dean said: \"People ask me if that 60-goal record will ever be beaten. I think it will. But there's only one man who'll do it. That's the fellow that walks on the water. I think he's about the only one.\"[27] In total, Dean scored 383 goals for Everton in 433 appearances \u2014 an exceptional strike-rate which includes 37 hat-tricks. He was known as a sporting player, never booked or sent off during his career despite rough treatment and provocation from opponents.[36] Only Arthur Rowley has scored more English-league career goals; however, while Rowley made 619 appearances and scored 433 goals (0.70 goals per game) Dean scored 379 goals in 438 games (0.87 goals per game).\n\n\nIn December 1930 and again in October 1931, Dean became the first Everton player to score two hat-tricks in one month of competitive play. His record stood for nearly ninety years until Dominic Calvert-Lewin equalled it in September 2020.[37]\n\n\n\n## Honours and achievements[edit]\n\n\n**Everton**\n\n\n\n* Football League First
