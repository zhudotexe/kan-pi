Their flowers are usually large, showy, and brightly coloured, generally red, orange, pink, yellow, or white (usually in warm colours). They often have a different coloured blotch at the base of the tepals (petals and sepals, collectively), internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations and a long history of cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the lily family, Liliaceae,[1] along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely related to *Amana*, *Erythronium*, and *Gagea* in the tribe Lilieae. \n\n\nThere are about seventy-five species, and these are divided among four subgenera. The name \"tulip\" is thought to be derived from a Persian word for turban, which it may have been thought to resemble by those who discovered it. Tulips were originally found in a band stretching from Southern Europe to Central Asia, but since the seventeenth century have become widely naturalised and cultivated (*see map*). In their natural state, they are adapted to steppes and mountainous areas with temperate climates. Flowering in the spring, they become dormant in the summer once the flowers and leaves die back, emerging above ground as a shoot from the underground bulb in early spring.\n\n\nGrowing wild over much of the Near East and Central Asia, tulips had probably been cultivated in Persia from the 10th century. By the 15th century, tulips were among the most prized flowers; becoming the symbol of the later Ottomans. Tulips were cultivated in Byzantine Constantinople as early as 1055 but they did not come to the attention of Northern Europeans until the sixteenth century, when Northern European diplomats to the Ottoman court observed and reported on them.[2] They were rapidly introduced into Northern Europe and became a much-sought-after commodity during tulip mania. Tulips were frequently depicted in Dutch Golden Age paintings, and have become associated with the Netherlands, the major producer for world markets, ever since. In the seventeenth-century Netherlands, during the time of the tulip mania, an infection of tulip bulbs by the tulip breaking virus created variegated patterns in the tulip flowers that were much admired and valued. While truly broken tulips are not cultivated anymore, the closest available specimens today are part of the group known as the Rembrandts \u2013 so named because Rembrandt painted some of the most admired breaks of his time.[3]\n\n\nBreeding programmes have produced thousands of hybrid and cultivars in addition to the original species (known in horticulture as botanical tulips). They are popular throughout the world, both as ornamental garden plants and as cut flowers.\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\nTulip morphology\n![Collection of tulip bulbs, some sliced to show interior scales](image)\n**Bulbs**, showing tunic and scales\n![Flower of Tulipa orphanidea, showing cup shape](image)\nCup-shaped flower of *Tulipa orphanidea*\n![Photograph of Tulipa clusiana, showing six identical tepals (petals and sepals)](image)\nStar-shaped flower of *Tulipa clusiana* with three sepals and three petals, forming six identical tepals\n\nTulips are perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes that bloom in spring and die back after flowering to an underground storage bulb. Depending on the species, tulip plants can be between 10 and 70\u00a0cm (4 and 28 inches) high.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTulip stems have few leaves. Larger species tend to have multiple leaves. Plants typically have two to six leaves, some species up to 12. The tulip's leaf is cauline (born on a stem), strap-shaped, with a waxy coating, and the leaves are alternate (alternately arranged on the stem), diminishing in size the further up the stem. These fleshy blades are often bluish-green in colour.[4][5][6] The bulbs are truncated basally and elongated towards the apex. They are covered by a protective tunic (tunicate) which can be glabrous or hairy inside.[7][6]\n\n\n\n### Flowers[edit]\n\n\nThe tulip's flowers are usually large and are actinomorphic (radially symmetric) and hermaphrodite (contain both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics), generally erect, or more rarely pendulous, and are arranged more usually as a single terminal flower, or when pluriflor as two to three (e.g. *Tulipa turkestanica*), but up to four, flowers on the end of a floriferous stem (scape), which is single arising from amongst the basal leaf rosette. In structure, the flower is generally cup or star-shaped. As with other members of Liliaceae the perianth is undifferentiated (perigonium) and biseriate (two whorled), formed from six free (i.e. apotepalous) caducous tepals arranged into two separate whorls of three parts (trimerous) each. The two whorls represent three petals and three sepals, but are termed tepals because they are nearly identical. The tepals are usually petaloid (petal-like), being brightly coloured, but each whorl may be different, or have different coloured blotches at their bases, forming darker colouration on the interior surface. The inner petals have a small, delicate cleft at the top, while the sturdier outer ones form uninterrupted ovals.[3]\n\n\nThe flowers have six distinct, basifixed introrse stamens arranged in two whorls of three, which vary in length and may be glabrous or hairy. The filaments are shorter than the tepals and dilated towards their base.[7] The style is short or absent and each stigma has three distinct lobes, and the ovaries are superior, with three chambers.[7]\n\n\n\n#### Colours[edit]\n\n\nThe \"Semper Augustus\" was the most expensive tulip during the 17th-century tulip mania. \u201cThe colour is white, with Carmine on a blue base, and with an unbroken flame right to the top\u201d \u2013 wrote Nicolas van Wassenaer in 1624 after seeing the tulip in the garden of one Dr Adriaen Pauw, a director of the new East India Company. With limited specimens in existence at the time and most owned by Pauw, his refusal to sell any flowers, despite wildly escalating offers, is believed by some to have sparked the mania.[3]\n\n\nTulip flowers come in a wide variety of colours, except pure blue (several tulips with \"blue\" in the name have a faint violet hue), and have absent nectaries.[4][5][6][7] Tulip flowers are generally bereft of scent and are the coolest of floral characters. The Dutch regarded this lack of scent as a virtue, as it demonstrates the flower's chasteness.[3]\n\n\nWhile tulips can be bred to display a wide variety of colours, black tulips have historically been difficult to achieve. The Queen of the Night tulip is as close to black as a flower gets, though it is, in fact, a dark and glossy maroonish purple - nonetheless, an effect prized by the Dutch.[3] The first truly black tulip was bred in 1986 by a Dutch flower grower in Bovenkarspel, Netherlands. The specimen was created by cross-breeding two deep purple tulips, the Queen of the Night and Wienerwald tulips.[8]\n\n\n\n### Fruit[edit]\n\n\nThe tulip's fruit is a globose or ellipsoid capsule with a leathery covering and an ellipsoid to globe shape. Each capsule contains numerous flat, disc-shaped seeds in two rows per chamber.[9] These light to dark brown seeds have very thin seed coats and endosperm that do not normally fill the entire seed.[10][7]\n\n\n\n### Phytochemistry[edit]\n\n\nTulipanin is an anthocyanin found in tulips. It is the 3-rutinoside of delphinidin. The chemical compounds named tuliposides and tulipalins can also be found in tulips and are responsible for allergies.[11] Tulipalin A, or \u03b1-methylene-\u03b3-butyrolactone, is a common allergen, generated by hydrolysis of the glucoside tuliposide A. It induces a dermatitis that is mostly occupational and affects tulip bulb sorters and florists who cut the stems and leaves.[12] Tulipanin A and B are toxic to horses, cats and dogs.[13] The colour of a tulip is formed from two pigments working in concert; a base colour that is always yellow or white, and a second laid-on anthocyanin colour. The mix of these two hues determines the visible unitary colour. The breaking of flowers occurs when a virus suppresses anthocyanin and the base colour is exposed as a streak.[3]\n\n\n\n### Fragrance[edit]\n\n\nThe great majority of tulips, both species and cultivars, have no discernable scent, but a few of both are scented to a degree, and Anna Pavord describes *T. Hungarica* as \"strongly scented\",[14] and among cultivars, some such as \"Monte Carlo\" and \"Brown Sugar\" are \"scented\", and \"Creme Upstar\" \"fragrant\".[15]\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Taxonomy of Tulipa\n\n*Tulipa* is a genus of the lily family, Liliaceae, once one of the largest families of monocots, but which molecular phylogenetics has reduced to a monophyletic grouping with only 15 genera. Within Liliaceae, *Tulipa* is placed within Lilioideae, one of three subfamilies, with two tribes. Tribe Lilieae includes seven other genera in addition to *Tulipa*.\n\n\n\n### Subdivision[edit]\n\n\nThe genus, which includes about 75 species, is divided into four subgenera.[6]\n\n\n\n* *Clusianae* (4 species)\n* *Orithyia* (4 species)\n* *Tulipa* (52 species)\n* *Eriostemones* (16 species)\n\n\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe word *tulip*, first mentioned in western Europe in or around 1554 and seemingly derived from the \"Turkish Letters\" of diplomat Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, first appeared in English as *tulipa* or *tulipant*, entering the language by way of French: *tulipe* and its obsolete form *tulipan* or by way of Modern Latin *tulipa*, from Ottoman Turkish *t\u00fclbend* (\"muslin\" or \"gauze\"), and may be ultimately derived from the Persian: \u062f\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f *delband* (\"Turban\"), this name being applied because of a perceived resemblance of the shape of a tulip flower to that of a turban.[16] This may have been due to a translation error in early times when it was fashionable in the Ottoman Empire to wear tulips on turbans. The translator possibly confused the flower for the turban.[6]\n\n\nOgier Ghiselin de Busbecq stated that the \"Turks\" used the word *tulipan* to describe the flower. Extensive speculation has tried to understand why he would state this, given that the Turkish word for tulip is *lale*. It is from this speculation that *tulipan* being a translation error referring to turbans is derived. This etymology has been challenged and makes no assumptions about possible errors. At no point does Busbecq state this was the word used in Turkey, he simply states it was used by the \"Turks\". On his way to Constantinople Busbecq states he travelled through Hungary and used Hungarian guides. Until recent times \"Turk\" was a common term when referring to Hungarians. The word *tulipan* is in fact the Hungarian word for tulip. As long as one recognizes \"Turk\" as a reference to Hungarians, no amount of speculation is required to reconcile the word's origin or form. Busbecq may have been simply repeating the word used by his \"Turk/Hungarian\" guides.[17]\n\n\nThe Hungarian word *tulipan* may be adopted from an Indo-Aryan reference to the tulip as a symbol of resurrection, *tala* meaning \"bottom or underworld\" and *pAna* meaning \"defence\".[17] Prior to arriving in Europe the Hungarians, and other Finno-Ugrians, embraced the Indo-Iranian cult of the dead, Yima/Yama, and would have been familiar with all of its symbols including the tulip.[18]\n\n\n\n## Distribution and habitat[edit]\n\n\n![Map from Turkmenistan to Tien-Shan](image)Eastern end of the tulip range from Turkmenistan on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea to the Pamir-Alai and Tien-Shan mountains\nTulips are mainly distributed along a band corresponding to latitude 40\u00b0 north, from southeast of Europe (Greece, Albania, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Southern Serbia, Bulgaria, most part of Romania, Ukraine, Russia) and Turkey in the west, through the Levant (Syria, Israel, Palestinian Territories, Lebanon and Jordan) and the Sinai Peninsula. From there it extends eastwards through Jerevan (Armenia), and Baku (Azerbaijan) and on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea through Turkmenistan, Bukhara, Samarkand and Tashkent (Uzbekistan), to the eastern end of the range in the Pamir-Alai and Tien-Shan mountains in Central Asia, which form the centre of diversity.[19] Further to the east, *Tulipa* is found in the western Himalayas, southern Siberia, Inner Mongolia, and as far as the northwest of China. While authorities have stated that no tulips west of the Balkans are native,[20] subsequent identification of *Tulipa sylvestris* subsp. *australis* as a native of the Iberian peninsula and adjacent North Africa shows that this may be a simplification. In addition to these regions in the west tulips have been identified in Greece, Cyprus and the Balkans. In the south, Iran marks its furthest extent, while the northern limit is Ukraine.[21] Although tulips are also throughout most of the Mediterranean and Europe, these regions do not form part of the natural distribution. Tulips were brought to Europe by travellers and merchants from Anatolia and Central Asia for cultivation, from where they escaped and naturalised (*see map*). For instance, less than half of those species found in Turkey are actually native.[20] These have been referred to as neo-tulipae.[22][23][6]\n\n\nTulips are indigenous to mountainous areas with temperate climates, where they are a common element of steppe and winter-rain Mediterranean vegetation. They thrive in climates with long, cool springs and dry summers. Tulips are most commonly found in meadows, steppes and chaparral, but also introduced in fields, orchards, roadsides and abandoned gardens.[22][6]\n\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Variegation produced by the tulip breaking virus\n*Botrytis tulipae* is a major fungal disease affecting tulips, causing cell death and eventually the rotting of the plant.[24] Other pathogens include anthracnose, bacterial soft rot, blight caused by *Sclerotium rolfsii*, bulb nematodes, other rots including blue molds, black molds and mushy rot.[25]\n\n\nThe fungus *Trichoderma viride* can infect tulips, producing dried leaf tips and reduced growth, although symptoms are usually mild and only present on bulbs growing in glasshouses.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nVariegated tulips admired during the Dutch tulipomania gained their delicately feathered patterns from an infection with the tulip breaking virus, a mosaic virus that was carried by the green peach aphid, *Myzus persicae*. While the virus produces fantastically streaked flowers, it also weakens plants and reduces the number of offsets produced. Dutch growers would go to extraordinary lengths during tulipomania to make tulips break, borrowing alchemists\u2019 techniques and resorting to sprinkling paint powders of the desired hue or pigeon droppings onto flower roots.[3]\n\n\nTulips affected by the mosaic virus are called \"broken\"; while such plants can occasionally revert to a plain or solid colouring, they will remain infected and have to be destroyed. Today the virus is almost eradicated from tulip growers' fields. The multicoloured patterns of modern varieties result from breeding; they normally have solid, un-feathered borders between the colours.\n\n\nTulip growth is also dependent on temperature conditions. Slightly germinated plants show greater growth if subjected to a period of cool dormancy, known as vernalisation. Furthermore, although flower development is induced at warmer temperatures (20\u201325\u00a0\u00b0C or 68\u201377\u00a0\u00b0F), elongation of the flower stalk and proper flowering is dependent on an extended period of low temperature (<\u00a010\u00a0\u00b0C or 50\u00a0\u00b0F).[26] Tulip bulbs imported to warm-winter areas are often planted in autumn to be treated as annuals.\n\n\nThe colour of tulip flowers also varies with growing conditions.[27]\n\n\n\n## Cultivation[edit]\n\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n#### Islamic World[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Tulipa sylvestris* subsp. *australis*[a] with seedpod by Sydenham Edwards (1804)[28]\nCultivation of the tulip began in Iran (Persia), probably in the 10th century.[6] Early cultivars must have emerged from hybridisation in gardens from wild collected plants, which were then favoured, possibly due to flower size or growth vigour. The tulip is not mentioned by any writer from antiquity,[29] therefore it seems probable that tulips were introduced into Anatolia only with the advance of the Seljuks.[29] In the Ottoman Empire, numerous types of tulips were cultivated and bred,[30] and today, 14 species can still be found in Turkey.[29] Tulips are mentioned by Omar Kayam and Jal\u0101l ad-D\u012bn R\u00fbmi.[29] Species of tulips in Turkey typically come in red, less commonly in white or yellow. The Ottoman Turks had discovered that these wild tulips were great changelings, freely hybridizing (though it takes 7 years to show colour) but also subject to mutations that produced spontaneous changes in form and colour.[3]\n\n\nA paper by Arthur Baker[31] reports that in 1574, Sultan Selim II ordered the Kadi of A\u2018az\u0101z in Syria to send him 50,000 tulip bulbs. However, John Harvey[32] points out several problems with this source, and there is also the possibility that tulips and hyacinth (*s\u00fcmb\u00fcll*), originally Indian spikenard (*Nardostachys jatamansi*) have been confused. Sultan Selim also imported 300,000 bulbs of *Kefe Lale* (also known as Cafe-Lale, from the medieval name Kaffa, probably *Tulipa schrenkii*) from Kefe in Crimea, for his gardens in the Topkap\u0131 Saray\u0131 in Istanbul.[33]\n\n\nIt is also reported that shortly after arriving in Constantinople in 1554, Ogier Ghislain de Busbecq, ambassador of the Austrian Habsburgs to the court of Suleyman the Magnificent, claimed to have introduced the tulip to Europe by sending a consignment of bulbs west. The fact that the tulip's first official trip west took it from one court to the other could have contributed to its ascendency.[3]\n\n\nSultan Ahmet III maintained famous tulip gardens in the summer highland pastures (*Yayla*) at Spil Da\u011f\u0131 above the town of Manisa.[34] They seem to have consisted of wild tulips. However, of the 14 tulip species known from Turkey, only four are considered to be of local origin,[35] so wild tulips from Iran and Central Asia may have been brought into Turkey during the Seljuk and especially Ottoman periods. Also, Sultan Ahmet imported domestic tulip bulbs from the Netherlands.\n\n\nThe gardening book *Revnak'\u0131 Bostan* (Beauty of the Garden) by Sahib\u00fcl Reis \u00fclha\u00e7 Ibrahim Ibn \u00fclha\u00e7 Mehmet, written in 1660 does not mention the tulip at all, but contains advice on growing hyacinths and lilies.[36] However, there is considerable confusion of terminology, and tulips may have been subsumed under hyacinth, a mistake several European botanists were to perpetuate. In 1515, the scholar Qasim from Herat in contrast had identified both wild and garden tulips (lale) as anemones (*shaqayq al-nu'man*), but described the crown imperial as *laleh kakli*.[36]\n\n\nIn a Turkic text written before 1495, the Chagatay Husayn Bayqarah mentions tulips (*lale*).[37] Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, also names tulips in the Baburnama.[38] He may actually have introduced them from Afghanistan to the plains of India, as he did with other plants like melons and grapes.[39] The tulip represents the official symbol of Turkey.[40]\n\n\nIn Moorish Andalus, a \"Makedonian bulb\" (*basal al-maqdunis*) or \"bucket-Narcissus\" (*naryis qadusi*) was cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens. It was supposed to have come from Alexandria and may have been Tulipa sylvestris, but the identification is not wholly secure.[41]\n\n\n\n#### Introduction to Western Europe[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tulip cultivation in the Netherlands\n![](image)The Keukenhof in Lisse, Netherlands\nAlthough it is unknown who first brought the tulip to Northwestern Europe, the most widely accepted story is that it was Oghier Ghislain de Busbecq, an ambassador for Emperor Ferdinand I to Suleyman the Magnificent. According to a letter, he saw \"an abundance of flowers everywhere; Narcissus, hyacinths and those in Turkish called Lale, much to our astonishment because it was almost midwinter, a season unfriendly to flowers.\"[42][43] However, in 1559, an account by Conrad Gessner describes tulips flowering in Augsburg, Swabia in the garden of Councillor Heinrich Herwart.[44] In Central and Northern Europe, tulip bulbs are generally removed from the ground in June and must be replanted by September for the winter.[*citation needed*] It is doubtful that Busbecq could have had the tulip bulbs harvested, shipped to Germany and replanted between March 1558 and Gessner's description the following year. Pietro Andrea Mattioli illustrated a tulip in 1565 but identified it as a narcissus.\n\n\nCarolus Clusius is largely responsible for the spread of tulip bulbs in the final years of the 16th century; he planted tulips at the Vienna Imperial Botanical Gardens in 1573. He finished the first major work on tulips in 1592 and made note of the colour variations. After he was appointed the director of the Leiden University's newly established Hortus Botanicus, he planted both a teaching garden and his private garden with tulips in late 1593. Thus, 1594 is considered the date of the tulip's first flowering in the Netherlands, despite reports of the cultivation of tulips in private gardens in Antwerp and Amsterdam two or three decades earlier. These tulips at Leiden would eventually lead to both the tulip mania and the tulip industry in the Netherlands.[45] Over two raids, in 1596 and in 1598, more than one hundred bulbs were stolen from his garden.\n\n\nTulips spread rapidly across Europe, and more opulent varieties such as double tulips were already known in Europe by the early 17th century. These curiosities fitted well in an age when natural oddities were cherished especially in the Netherlands, France, Germany and England, where the spice trade with the East Indies had made many people wealthy. *Nouveaux riches* seeking wealthy displays embraced the exotic plant market, especially in the Low Countries where gardens had become fashionable. A craze for bulbs soon grew in France, where in the early 17th century, entire properties were exchanged as payment for a single tulip bulb. The value of the flower gave it an aura of mystique, and numerous publications describing varieties in lavish garden manuals were published, cashing in on the value of the flower. An export business was built up in France, supplying Dutch, Flemish, German and English buyers. The trade drifted slowly from the French to the Dutch.[46]\n\n\nBetween 1634 and 1637, the enthusiasm for the new flowers in Holland triggered a speculative frenzy now known as the tulip mania that eventually led to the collapse of the market three years later. Tulip bulbs had become so expensive that they were treated as a form of currency, or rather, as futures, forcing the Dutch government to introduce trading restrictions on the bulbs.[46] Around this time, the ceramic tulipiere was devised for the display of cut flowers stem by stem. Vases and bouquets, usually including tulips, often appeared in Dutch still-life painting. To this day, tulips are associated with the Netherlands, and the cultivated forms of the tulip are often called \"Dutch tulips\". The Netherlands has the world's largest permanent display of tulips at the Keukenhof.\n\n\nThe majority of tulip cultivars are classified in the taxon *Tulipa \u00d7gesneriana*. They have usually several species in their direct background, but most have been derived from *Tulipa suaveolens* (today often regarded as a synonym with *Tulipa schrenkii*). *Tulipa \u00d7gesneriana* is in itself an early hybrid of complex origin and is probably not the same taxon as was described by Conrad Gessner in the 16th century.[6]\n\n\nThe UK's National Collection of English florists' tulips and Dutch historic tulips, dating from the early 17th century to c.1960, is held by Polly Nicholson at Blackland House, near Calne in Wiltshire.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Introduction to the United States[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden\nIt is believed the first tulips in the United States were grown near Spring Pond at the Fay Estate in Lynn and Salem, Massachusetts. From 1847 to 1865, Richard Sullivan Fay, Esq., one of Lynn's wealthiest men, settled on 500 acres (2\u00a0km2; 202\u00a0ha) located partly in present-day Lynn and partly in present-day Salem. Mr. Fay imported many different trees and plants from all parts of the world and planted them among the meadows of the Fay Estate.[48]\n\n\n\n### Propagation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nTulip pistil surrounded by stamens\n![](image)\nTulip stamen with pollen grains\nThe reproductive organs of a tulip\n\nThe Netherlands is the world's main producer of commercial tulip plants, producing as many as 3 billion bulbs annually, the majority for export.[49]\n\n\n\"Unlike many flower species, tulips do not produce nectar to entice insect pollination. Instead, tulips rely on wind and land animals to move their pollen between reproductive organs. Because they are self-pollinating, they do not need the pollen to move several feet to another plant but only within their blossoms.\"[50]\n\n\nTulips can be propagated through bulb offsets, seeds or micropropagation.[51] Offsets and tissue culture methods are means of asexual propagation for producing genetic clones of the parent plant, which maintains cultivar genetic integrity. Seeds are most often used to propagate species and subspecies or to create new hybrids. Many tulip species can cross-pollinate with each other, and when wild tulip populations overlap geographically with other tulip species or subspecies, they often hybridise and create mixed populations. Most commercial tulip cultivars are complex hybrids, and often sterile.\n\n\nOffsets require a year or more of growth before plants are large enough to flower. Tulips grown from seeds often need five to eight years before plants are of flowering size. To prevent cross-pollination, increase the growth rate of bulbs and increase the vigour and size of offsets, the flower and stems of a field of commercial tulips are usually topped using large tractor-mounted mowing heads. The same goals can be achieved by a private gardener by clipping the stem and flower of an individual specimen. Commercial growers usually harvest the tulip bulbs in late summer and grade them into sizes; bulbs large enough to flower are sorted and sold, while smaller bulbs are sorted into sizes and replanted for sale in the future.\n\n\nBecause tulip bulbs don't reliably come back every year, tulip varieties that fall out of favour with present aesthetic values have traditionally gone extinct. Unlike other flowers that do not suffer this same limitation, the Tulip's historical forms do not survive alongside their modern incarnations.[3]\n\n\n\n### Horticultural classification[edit]\n\n\n![](image)'Gavota', a division 3 cultivar\n![](image)'Yonina', a division 6 cultivar\n![](image)'Texas Flame', a division 10 cultivar\nIn horticulture, tulips are divided into fifteen groups (Divisions) mostly based on flower morphology and plant size.[52][53]\n\n\n\n* **Div. 1: Single early** \u2013 with cup-shaped single flowers, no larger than 8\u00a0cm (3 inches) across. They bloom early to mid-season. Growing 15 to 45\u00a0cm (6 to 18 inches) tall.\n* **Div. 2: Double early** \u2013 with fully double flowers, bowl shaped to 8\u00a0cm (3 inches) across. Plants typically grow from 30\u201340\u00a0cm (12\u201316 inches) tall.\n* **Div. 3: Triumph** \u2013 single, cup shaped flowers up to 6\u00a0cm (2.5 inches) wide. Plants grow 35\u201360\u00a0cm (14\u201324 inches) tall and bloom mid to late season.\n* **Div. 4: Darwin hybrid** \u2013 single flowers are ovoid in shape and up to 6\u00a0cm (2.5 inches) wide. Plants grow 50\u201370\u00a0cm (20\u201328 inches) tall and bloom mid to late season. This group should not be confused with older Darwin tulips, which belong in the Single Late Group below.\n* **Div. 5: Single late** \u2013 cup or goblet-shaped flowers up to 8\u00a0cm (3 inches) wide, some plants produce multi-flowering stems. Plants grow 45\u201375\u00a0cm (18\u201330 inches) tall and bloom late season.\n* **Div. 6: Lily-flowered** \u2013 the flowers possess a distinct narrow 'waist' with pointed and reflexed petals. Previously included with the old Darwins, only became a group in their own right in 1958.[54]\n* **Div. 7: Fringed (Crispa)** \u2013 cup or goblet-shaped blossoms edged with spiked or crystal-like fringes, sometimes called \u201ctulips for touch\u201d because of the temptation to \u201ctest\u201d the fringes to see if they are real or made of glass. Perennials with a tendency to naturalize in woodland areas, growing 45\u201365\u00a0cm (18\u201326 inches) tall and blooming in late season.\n* **Div. 8: Viridiflora**\n* **Div. 9: Rembrandt**\n* **Div. 10: Parrot**\n* **Div. 11: Double late** \u2013 Large, heavy blooms. They range from 46 to 56\u00a0cm (18 to 22 inches) tall.\n* **Div. 12: Kaufmanniana** \u2013 Waterlily tulip. Medium-large creamy yellow flowers marked red on the outside and yellow at the centre. Stems 15\u00a0cm (6 inches) tall.\n* **Div. 13: Fosteriana (Emperor)**\n* **Div. 14: Greigii** \u2013 Scarlet flowers 15\u00a0cm (6 inches) across, on 15-centimetre (6\u00a0in) stems. Foliage mottled with brown.[55]\n* **Div. 15: Species or Botanical** \u2013 The terms \"species tulips\" and \"botanical tulips\" refer to wild species in contrast to hybridised varieties.[56] As a group they have been described as being less ostentatious but more reliably vigorous as they age.[57][58]\n* **Div. 16: Multiflowering** \u2013 not an official division, these tulips belong in the first 15 divisions but are often listed separately because they have multiple blooms per bulb.\n\n\nThey may also be classified by their flowering season:[59]\n\n\n\n* Early flowering: Single Early Tulips, Double Early Tulips, Greigii Tulips, Kaufmanniana Tulips, Fosteriana Tulips, \u00a7\u00a0Species tulips\n* Mid-season flowering: Darwin Hybrid Tulips, Triumph Tulips, Parrot Tulips\n* Late season flowering: Single Late Tulips, Double Late Tulips, Viridiflora Tulips, Lily-flowering Tulips, Fringed (Crispa) Tulips, Rembrandt Tulips\n\n\n#### Neo-tulipae[edit]\n\n\n![Tulip Bulb Depth](image)Tulip bulb planting depth 15\u00a0cm (6 inches)\nA number of names are based on naturalised garden tulips and are usually referred to as neo-tulipae. These are often difficult to trace back to their original cultivar, and in some cases have been occurring in the wild for many centuries. The history of naturalisation is unknown, but populations are usually associated with agricultural practices and are possibly linked to saffron cultivation[*clarification needed*]. Some neo-tulipae have been brought into cultivation, and are often offered as botanical tulips. These cultivated plants can be classified into two Cultivar Groups: 'Grengiolensis Group', with picotee tepals, and the 'Didieri Group' with unicolourous tepals.\n\n\n\n### Horticulture[edit]\n\n\nTulip bulbs are typically planted around late summer and fall, in well-drained soils. Tulips should be planted 10 to 15\u00a0cm (4 to 6 inches) apart from each other. The recommended hole depth is 10 to 20\u00a0cm (4 to 8 inches) deep and is measured from the top of the bulb to the surface. Therefore, larger tulip bulbs would require deeper holes. Species tulips are normally planted deeper.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Culture and politics[edit]\n\n\n### Iran[edit]\n\n\nThe celebration of Persian New Year, or Nowruz, dating back over 3,000 years, marks the advent of spring, and tulips are used as a decorative feature during the festivities.[60]\n\n\nA sixth-century legend, similar to the tale of *Romeo and Juliet*, tells of tulips sprouting where the blood of the young prince Farhad spilt after he killed himself upon hearing the (deliberately false) story that his true love had died.[60]\n\n\nThe tulip was a topic for Persian poets from the thirteenth century. The poem *Gulistan* by Musharrifu'd-din Saadi, described a visionary garden paradise with \"The murmur of a cool stream / bird song, ripe fruit in plenty / bright multicoloured tulips and fragrant roses...\".[61] In recent times, tulips have featured in the poems of Simin Behbahani.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe tulip is the national symbol for martyrdom in Iran[62] (and Shi'ite Islam generally), and has been used on postage stamps and coins. It was common as a symbol used in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and a red tulip adorns the flag redesigned in 1980. The sword in the centre, with four crescent-shaped petals around it, create the word \"Allah\" as well as symbolising the five pillars of Islam. The tomb of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is decorated with 72 stained glass tulips, representing 72 martyrs who died at the Battle of Karbala in 680CE. It was also used as a symbol on billboards celebrating casualties of the 1980\u20131988 war with Iraq.[60]\n\n\nThe tulip also became a symbol of protest against the Iranian government after the presidential election in June 2009, when millions turned out on the streets to protest the re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. After the protests were harshly suppressed, the Iranian Green Movement adopted the tulip as a symbol of their struggle.[60]\n\n\nThe word for tulip in Persian is \"laleh\" (\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0647), and this has become popular as a girl's name.[62] The name has been used for commercial enterprises, such as the Laleh International Hotel, as well as public facilities, such as Laleh Park[60] and Laleh Hospital,[63] and the tulip motif remains common in Iranian culture.[60]\n\n\n\n* Iranian 20 rial coin\n* ![Obverse with 22 tulips](image)\n\nObverse with 22 tulips\n* ![Reverse with three tulips](image)\n\nReverse with three tulips\n\n\n### In other countries and cultures[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Turkish Airlines uses a grey tulip emblem on its aircraft\nTulips are called *lale* in Turkish (from the Persian: \u0644\u0627\u0644\u0647, romanized:\u00a0*laleh* from \u0644\u0627\u0644 *lal* 'red'[64]). When written in Arabic letters, *lale* has the same letters as *Allah*, which is why the flower became a holy symbol. It was also associated with the House of Osman, resulting in tulips being widely used in decorative motifs on tiles, mosques, fabrics, crockery, etc. in the Ottoman Empire.[6] The tulip was seen as a symbol of abundance and indulgence. The era during which the Ottoman Empire was wealthiest is often called the Tulip era or *Lale Devri* in Turkish.\n\n\nTulips became popular garden plants in the east and west, but, whereas the tulip in Turkish culture was a symbol of paradise on earth and had almost a divine status, in the Netherlands it represented the briefness of life.[6]\n\n\nIn Christianity, tulips symbolise passion, belief and love. White tulips represent forgiveness while purple tulips represent royalty, both important aspects of Easter.[*citation needed*] In Calvinism, the five points of the doctrines of grace have been summarized under the acrostic TULIP.[65][66]\n\n\nBy contrast to other flowers such as the coneflower or lotus flower, tulips have historically been capable of genetically reinventing themselves to suit changes in aesthetic values. In his 1597 herbal, John Gerard says of the tulip that \"nature seems to play more with this flower than with any other that I do know\". When in the Netherlands, beauty was defined by marbled swirls of vivid contrasting colours, the petals of tulips were able to become \"feathered\" and \"flamed\". However, in the 19th century, when the English desired tulips for carpet bedding and massing, the tulips were able to once again accommodate this by evolving into \"paint-filled boxes with the brightest, fattest dabs of pure pigment\". This inherent mutability of the tulip even led the Ottoman Turks to believe that nature cherished this flower above all others.[3]\n\n\n*The Black Tulip* (1850) is a historical romance by Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re. The story takes place in the Dutch city of Haarlem, where a reward is offered to the first grower who can produce a truly black tulip.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe tulip occurs on a number of the Major Arcana cards of occultist Oswald Wirth's deck of Tarot cards, specifically the Magician, Emperor, Temperance and the Fool, described in his 1927 work *Le Tarot, des Imagiers du Moyen \u00c2ge*.[67][68]\n\n\n\n### Tulip festivals[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

There is also a popular festival in Morges, Switzerland. Every spring, there are tulip festivals in North America, including the Tulip Time Festival in Holland, Michigan, the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival in Skagit Valley, Washington, the Tulip Time Festival in Orange City and Pella, Iowa, and the Canadian Tulip Festival in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Tulips are also popular in Australia and several festivals are held in September and October, during the Southern Hemisphere's spring. The Indira Gandhi Memorial Tulip Garden hosts an annual tulip festival which draws huge attention and has an attendance of over 200,000.\n\n\n\n## Consumption[edit]\n\n\nTulip petals are edible. The taste varies by variety and season, and is roughly similar to lettuce or other salad greens. Some people are allergic to tulips.[70][71]\n\n\nTulip bulbs look similar to onions, but should not generally be considered food. The toxicity of bulbs is not well understood, nor is there an agreed-upon method of safely preparing them for human consumption. There have been reports of illness when eaten, depending on quantity.[72] During the Dutch famine of 1944\u201345, tulip bulbs were eaten out of desperation, and Dutch doctors provided recipes.[73][74]\n\n\n\n### Animals[edit]\n\n\nAs with other plants of the lily family, tulips are poisonous to domestic animals including horses, cats and dogs.[13] In cats, ingestion of small amounts of tulips can include vomiting, depression, diarrhoea, hypersalivation, and irritation of the mouth and throat, and larger amounts can cause abdominal pain, tremors, tachycardia, convulsions, tachypnea, difficulty breathing, cardiac arrhythmia, and coma. All parts of the tulip plant are poisonous to cats, while the bulb is especially dangerous. A veterinarian should be contacted immediately if a cat has ingested tulip.[75] In the American East, White-tailed Deer eat tulip flowers ravenously, with no apparent ill effects.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Award of Garden Merit tulips\n* Tulip period\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Illustration of *Tulipa sylvestris* subsp. *australis*, identified as Tulipa breyniana\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"*Tulipa* L\". *Plants of the World Online*.

The genus is native predominantly to the Eastern Mediterranean region and Afrotropical realm, although naturalized more widely.[5]\n\n\nSeveral species of *Brodiaea*, *Scilla*, and other plants that were formerly classified in the Liliaceae family and have flower clusters borne along the stalk also have common names with the word \"hyacinth\" in them. Hyacinths should also not be confused with the genus *Muscari*, which are commonly known as grape hyacinths.\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n*Hyacinthus* grows from bulbs, each producing around four to six narrow untoothed leaves and one to three spikes or racemes of flowers. In the wild species, the flowers are widely spaced, with as few as two per raceme in *H.\u00a0litwinovii* and typically six to eight in *H.\u00a0orientalis* which grows to a height of 15\u201320\u00a0cm (6\u20138\u00a0in). Cultivars of *H.\u00a0orientalis* have much denser flower spikes and are generally more robust.[6]\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nThe genus name *Hyacinthus* was attributed to Joseph Pitton de Tournefort when used by Carl Linnaeus in 1753.[5] It is derived from a Greek name used for a plant by Homer, \u1f51\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (*hy\u00e1kinthos*), the flowers supposedly having grown up from the blood of a youth of this name purposefully killed by the god Zephyr out of jealousy .[7] The original wild plant known as *hyakinthos* to Homer has been identified with *Scilla bifolia*,[8] among other possibilities. Linnaeus defined the genus *Hyacinthus* widely to include species now placed in other genera of the subfamily Scilloideae, such as *Muscari* (e.g. his *Hyacinthus botryoides*)[9] and *Hyacinthoides* (e.g. his *Hyacinthus non-scriptus*).[10]\n\n\n*Hyacinthus* was formerly the type genus of the separate family Hyacinthaceae; prior to that, the genus was placed in the lily family Liliaceae.[11]\n\n\n\n### Species[edit]\n\n\nThree species are placed within the genus *Hyacinthus*:[5]\n\n\n\n* *Hyacinthus litwinovii* \u2013 north-east Iran to southern Turkmenistan\n* *Hyacinthus orientalis* - southern Turkey to Levant[12]\n* *Hyacinthus transcaspicus* \u2013 north-east Iran to southern Turkmenistan\n\n\nSome authorities place *H.\u00a0litwonovii* and *H.\u00a0transcaspicus* in the related genus *Hyacinthella*,[13] which would make *Hyacinthus* a monotypic genus.\n\n\n\n## Distribution[edit]\n\n\nThe genus *Hyacinthus* is considered native to the eastern Mediterranean from southern Turkey to the Levant, and on through Iraq and Iran to Turkmenistan.[5] It is widely naturalized elsewhere, including Europe (Bulgaria, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Sardinia, Sicily and former Yugoslavia), Cyprus, North America (California, Pennsylvania, Texas), central Mexico,the Caribbean (Cuba, Haiti) and Korea.[5]\n\n\n\n## Cultivation[edit]\n\n\nThe Dutch, or common hyacinth, of house and garden culture (*H.\u00a0orientalis*, native to Southwest Asia) was so popular in the 18th century that over 2,000 cultivars were grown in the Netherlands, its chief commercial producer. This hyacinth has a single dense spike of fragrant flowers in shades of red, blue, white, orange, pink, violet or yellow. A form of the common hyacinth is the less hardy and smaller blue- or white-petalled Roman hyacinth of florists. These flowers need indirect sunlight and should be watered moderately.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Toxicity[edit]\n\n\nThe inedible bulbs contain oxalic acid and may cause mild skin irritation. Protective gloves are recommended.[14]\n\n\nSome members of the plant subfamily Scilloideae are commonly called hyacinths but are not members of the genus *Hyacinthus* and are edible; one example is the tassel hyacinth, which forms part of the cuisine of some Mediterranean countries.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nowruz Sonbol (Hyacinth)\nHyacinths are often associated with spring and rebirth.[*citation needed*] The hyacinth flower is used in the Haft-Seen table setting for the Persian New Year celebration, Nowruz, held at the spring equinox. The Persian word for hyacinth is \u0633\u0646\u0628\u0644 (**sonbol**).\n\n\nThe name \u1f51\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (**hyakinthos**) was used in Ancient Greece for at least two distinct plants, which have variously been identified as *Scilla bifolia* or *Orchis quadripunctata* and *Consolida ajacis* (larkspur).[15] Plants known by this name were sacred to Aphrodite.[16]\n\n\nThe hyacinth appears in the first section of T. S. Eliot's *The Waste Land* during a conversation between the narrator and the \"hyacinth girl\" that takes place in the spring.[17]\n\n\n\n\n> You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;  \n> \n> \"They called me the hyacinth girl.\"  \n> \n> \u2014Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,  \n> \n> Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not  \n> \n> Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither  \n> \n> Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,  \n> \n> Looking into the heart of light, the silence.\n> \n\n\nIn Roman Catholic tradition, *H. orientalis* represents prudence, constancy, desire of heaven and peace of mind.[18]\n\n\n\n## Colour[edit]\n\n\nThe colour of the blue flower hyacinth plant varies between 'mid-blue',[19] violet blue and bluish purple. Within this range can be found **Persenche**, which is an American color name (probably from French), for a hyacinth hue.[20]\nThe colour analysis of Persenche is 73% ultramarine, 9% red and 18% white.[21]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Wild-type Hyacinthus orientalis in cultivation](image)\n\nWild-type *Hyacinthus orientalis* in cultivation\n* ![Pink cultivar](image)\n\nPink cultivar\n* ![Hyacinth cultivars in Floriade, Canberra](image)\n\nHyacinth cultivars in Floriade, Canberra\n* ![Hyacinth cultivars in Floriade, Canberra](image)\n\nHyacinth cultivars in Floriade, Canberra\n* ![White and purple hyacinth cultivars in Detroit, Michigan](image)\n\nWhite and purple hyacinth cultivars in Detroit, Michigan\n* ![Young boy picking hyacinths in Normandy in France](image)\n\nYoung boy picking hyacinths in Normandy in France\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Tekhelet - meaning \"bluish violet\" or \"blue\" in Hebrew, was translated as hyakinthos (Greek: \u1f51\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, \"hyacinth\").\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hyacinthus\". *Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary*.\n2. **^** \"Are Hyacinths Perennials?\".\n3. **^** \"Are Hyacinths Perennials?\".\n4. **^** Stevens, P.F. \"Angiosperm Phylogeny Website: Asparagales: Scilloideae\". *Mobot.org*.

They are low growing plants, whose flower stems remain underground, that bear relatively large white, yellow, orange or purple flowers and then become dormant after flowering. Many are cultivated for their flowers, appearing in autumn, winter, or spring. The flowers close at night and in overcast weather conditions. The crocus has been known throughout recorded history, mainly as the source of saffron. Saffron is obtained from the dried stigma of *Crocus sativus*, an autumn-blooming species. It is valued as a spice and dyestuff, and is one of the most expensive spices in the world. Iran is the center of saffron production. Crocuses are native to woodland, scrub, and meadows from sea level to alpine tundra from the Mediterranean, through North Africa, central and southern Europe, the islands of the Aegean, the Middle East and across Central Asia to Xinjiang in western China. Crocuses may be propagated from seed or from daughter cormels formed on the corm, that eventually produce mature plants. They arrived in Europe from Turkey in the 16th century and became valued as an ornamental flowering plant.\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![Illustration of two crocus species from 1891](image)*Crocus sativus* & *C. vernus*, Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Masclef,  \n Atlas des plantes de France, 1891\n![Botanical illustration of crocus sativus including vertical and crosssection of ovary](image)Crocus sativus, with ovary sectioned\nGeneral\n*Crocus* display the general characteristics of family Iridaceae, which include basal cauline (arising from the aerial stem) leaves that sheath the stem base, hermaphrodite flowers that are relatively large and showy, the perianth petaloid with 2 whorls of 3 tepals each and septal nectaries. The flowers have 3 stamens and a gynoecium of 3 united carpels and an inferior ovary, 3 locules and axile placentation with fruit that is a loculicidal capsule.[2]\n\n\n*Crocus* is an acaulescent (lacking a visible lower stem above ground) diminutive seasonal cormous (growing from corms) herbaceous perennial geophytic genus.[3] The corms are symmetrical and globose or oblate (round in shape with flatted tops and bottoms), and are covered with tunic leaves that are fibrous, membranous or coriaceous (leathery). The corms produce fibrous roots, and contractile roots which adjust the corms depth in the soil, which maybe pulled as deep as 20 centimetres (8\u00a0in) into the soil.[4][5]The roots appear randomly from the lower part of the corm, but in a few species, from a basal ridge.[6]\n\n\n\nLeaves\nPlants produce several basal linear bifacial green leaves that arise from the corms. These are adaxially (upper surface facing axis) flat or channelled with pale median stripes, while the opposite (abaxial) surface is strongly keeled, with two grooves on either side. The leaves have a distinctive shape in cross-section, being boat-shaped with two lateral arms with margins recurved inwardly towards the central ridged keel, forming the sides of the \"boat\". The keel may be square or rectangular, but is lacking in *C. carpetanus*. The pale central stripe is caused by parenchymatous cells which lack chloroplasts and may contain air spaces.[7] The leaves are from 5 to 30 millimetres (3\u204416 to 1+3\u204416\u00a0in) wide and 10 to 118 centimetres (4 to 46\u00a0in) long. The leaf-like bracts are membranous, while the smaller bracteoles are either membranous or absent.[4][5] The leaf bases are surrounded by up to 5 membranous sheaths called cataphylls, a specialised leaf. The bases of the cataphylls form the corm tunic, and their number varies from 3 to 6, and enclose the true leaves (euphylls), bracts, bracteoles and flowering stalk.[8][9]\n\n\n\nFlowers\nThe number of peduncles (flower stems) vary from one to several and remain underground, emerging only at the fruiting stage, bearing flowers that are solitary or several, so that a true scape is absent. The flowers are pedicellate (attached to the peduncle by a short subterranean pedicel stalk). The pedicel is sometimes subtended (below pedicel) by a membranous, sheathing prophyll (leaf-like structure).[4][5]\n\n\nThe showy, salver to cup-shaped, single or clustered actinomorphic flowers taper off into a narrow tube; the flowers emerge from the ground, and can be white, yellow, lilac to dark purple, or variegated in cultivars. The flower tube is long, cylindrical and slender, expanding apically. The floral tube is long and narrow with 6 lobes in 2 whorls. The perianth is 3+3 (3 sepals+3petals) and gamophyllous (with fused segments). The tepal whorls are similar, equal or subequal with a smaller inner whorl, and cupped to outspread. The bracts are membranous, but the inner ones are sometimes lacking.[4][5][10]\n\n\nThe 3 stamens are erect and linear and inserted in the throat of the perianth tube, with anthers shorter than the filaments. Pollen grains are inaperturate (apertures absent) but sometimes spiraperturate (spiral shaped).[11] Each flower has a single style which is exserted (projecting beyond the corolla tube) and slender distally with three to many branches. The branches are highly variable, being short or long, and simple, bifurcate (dividing in two) or multifid and sometimes distally flattened. The inferior ovary has 3 carpels with axile placentation. It remains underground, and as the seeds ripen, the pedicel (stem of the flower) grows longer - so the fruit is above the soil surface.[4][5][12]\n\n\n\nFruit and seed\nThe fruit is a small membranous capsule, ellipsoid or oblong-ellipsoid in shape and the many seeds are globose to ellipsoid. The seed surface is highly variable, including papillate (covered in small protuberances), digitiform (finger-like) and other epidermal cell types. In some species the seeds are arillate, with fleshy appendages. Crocus seeds have both inner and outer integuments and in some species the outer epidermis may display long papillae. Embryo-sac development is Polygonum type. Dehiscence (splitting of the capsule to release the seed) is of the loculicidal type in which it splits through the wall of the locules leaving the septa that separate them intact.[13][10][14]\n\n\n\nKaryology\n*Crocus* has extensive aneuploidy (abnormal number of chromosomes), with some uncertainty as to the base number of chromosomes. The chromosome numbers shows extreme variability, ranging from 2n=6 to 2n=70 even within a single species.[15][11]\n\n\n\nPhytochemistry\nThe Iridaceae contain a wide range of phenolic compounds. However, 6-Hydroxyflavones are found only in *Crocus*, which is also characterised by the presence of crocins, water-soluble yellow carotenoids, in the floral tissues. Crocin is a diester of crocetin, responsible for the colour of the styles and stigma of *C. sativus*, and hence saffron.[16][17] A few species contain mangiferin, a glucosylxanthone.[18][19]\n\n\nWhile the flowers may vary dramatically between species, there is little variation in the leaves,[20] but sufficient variability in corm tunics that they may be used as an aid in differentiating taxa.[21]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Crocus* Structures\n![Crocus corms](image)\nCorms with net-like papery tunic\n![Flower with leaves](image)\nClosed flower with leaves\n![Flower of Crocus vernus](image)\nFlower with 3 stamens surrounding central style and stigma\n![3 stamens and style](image)\n3 stamens and style\n![Stigma seen in centre of opening flower](image)\nCentral stigma in opening flower\n![Style and stigma projecting above petals of flower](image)\nExserted style & trifid stigma projecting above corolla\n![Side view of flower showing stamens and style projecting above corolla](image)\nLateral view\n![Crocus seedpods](image)\nCapsules (seedpods) with seeds\n | ![Photograph of whole crocus plant from roots to flower](image) |\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n![Illustration of crocus from illuminated manuscript dated between 1300 and 1330](image)\n*Croci oriental*  \nTractatus de Herbis ca.\u00a01300\u20131330\n![Illustration of crocus from John Gerard's Historie of Plants 1597](image)]\nCrocuses  \nJohn Gerard 1597\n![Crocuses and other flowers from the Hortus Eystettensis of 1613](image)\nCrocuses  \n*Hortus Eystettensis* 1613\n\nThe crocus was well known to the ancients,[22] being described at least as early as Theophrastus (c. 371\u00a0\u2013 c. 287 BC),[a][24] and was introduced into Britain by the Romans, where the saffron crocus was used as a dyestuff. It was reintroduced into Western Europe by the Crusaders. The crocus is mentioned in mediaeval and later herbals, one of the earliest being the 14th century *Tractatus de Herbis.*[25][26] William Turner (1548) states that the crocus is referred to as saffron in English, implying that only *C. sativus* was known at that time.[27] However, by 1597 John Gerard writes of \"sundry sorts\" and uses the term saffron and crocus as interchangeable. He included both spring and autumn flowering crocus, but distinguished Wild Saffron (Crocus) from Meadow Saffron (Colchicum). He described eleven forms. Some of his specimens were obtained from Clusius.[28][29] In the following century, John Parkinson in a more detailed account was more careful to include separate chapters for *Colchicum*, with the common name of meadow saffron, from *Crocus* or saffron. Parkinson (1656) states that there are \"divers sorts of saffrons\" describing 27 spring flowering plants and 4 autumn flowering ones, pointing out that only one of those was the true saffron crocus, which he called *Crocus verus sativus autumnalis*.[30] Similar accounts are found in continental European herbals, including those of l'Obel in Flanders (1576)[31] and Besler's *Hortus Eystettensis* in Bavaria (1613).[32]\n\n\nThe genus *Crocus* was first formally described by Linnaeus in 1753, with three taxa, and two species, *C. sativus* (type species), var. *officinalis* (now treated as a synonym of *C. sativus*) and var. *vernus* (now *C. vernus*) and *C. bulbocodium* (now *Romulea bulbocodium*). Thus Linnaeus recognised two taxa that are accepted as separate species in modern classifications, one vernal and one autumnal crocus, but incorrectly assumed they were only varieties of a single species, while his second species was actually from a closely related genus that was only recognised later (1772).[33] However, a subsequent re-examination of Linnaeus's specimens suggested the presence of several different species that he did not recognise as being separate.[34] Linnaeus' system, based on sexual characteristics, *Crocus* was classified as Triandra Monogynia (Three stamens, Single pistil).[35] Linnaeus's system was supplanted by the \"natural\" system which used a hierarchy of taxonomic ranks based on weighting of the importance of structural characteristics of the plant. Jussieu (1789) placed the genus Crocus in his *Ordo* (family) Irides or *Les iris*, as a member of the class *Stamina epigyna* (stamens inserted above the ovary) as part of the monocotyledons, the first level of the division of the flowering plants.[36]\n\n\n\n![Page from Linnaeus' 1753 work describing Crocus](image)Linnaeus's description of *Crocus* 1753\nOne of the first monographs of the genus appeared in 1809, by Haworth,[37] followed in 1829 by that of Sabine,[38][29] and Herbert in 1847.[39] In 1853, Lindley continued the placement of *Crocus* as one of 53 genera in Iridaceae, which he included in a higher order of monocotyledons, the Narcissales.[40] Baker published a monograph on the genus in 1874, adopting a very different schema to that of Herbert.[41] In 1883, Bentham and Hooker described the Irideae (Iridaceae) as having more than 700 species, and divided it into 3 tribes and further into subtribes. Tribe Sysyrinchieae as having 2 subtribes, including Ixieae. The latter was circumscribed with four genera, *Crocus*, *Syringodea*, *Galaxia* (*Moraea*) and *Romulea*.[42] This circumscription has remained stable since, with the exception of *Moraea* which properly belongs in a separate tribe. The most influential monograph of the nineteenth century was that of Maw (1886), which forms the basis of modern understanding of the genus. Maw built on the work of Herbert, rejecting Baker's classification.[43] The availability of molecular phylogenetic methods in the late twentieth century has shown that the Iridaceae properly belong within the order Asparagales.[44]\n\n\n\n### Botanical illustration[edit]\n\n\nThe scientific study of the genus in the late eighteenth century was accompanied by detailed descriptions with Botanical illustrations, such as those of William Curtis (1787) and Sims (1803),[45] that appeared in Curtis' Botanical Magazine, with illustrations by Sydenham Edwards.[46] Other illustrations are found in monographs such as those of Haworth (1809)[37] and Sabine (1830), illustrated by Charles John Robertson.[38] The largest collection is found in the most comprehensive monograph, that of Maw (1886).[47] Other sources include the portfolios of plates, such as the survey of the plants of France by Masclef (1891). At that time only *C. sativus* and *C. vernus* were included in the Flora of France.[48]\n\n\n\nBotanical Illustration\n![Illustration of a yellow crocus angustifolius from 1787](image)\n*Crocus*  \nCurtis's Botanical Magazine 1787\n![Illustration of yellow Crocus angustifolius from 1803](image)\n*C. angustifolius*  \nCurtis's Botanical Magazine 1803\n![Illustration of yellow Crocus luteus from 1820](image)\n*Crocus luteus*  \nA Haworth 1809\n![Bouquet of 19 different crocus species from 1830](image)\nCrocus bouquet of 19 species  \nSabine 1830\n![Hand painted lithograph of Crocus iridiflorus from 1886](image)\n*C. iridiflorus*  \nMaw 1886\n\n### Phylogeny[edit]\n\n\nThe genus *Crocus* belongs to the monocot family Iridaceae (iris family), specifically the large subfamily Crocoideae. Within that subfamily, crocus is placed on the tribe, Ixieae (synonym Croceae),[b] one of five. The Ixieae are then subdivided into subtribes, with the genera *Crocus*, *Romulea* and *Syringodea* forming subtribe Romuleinae. The Romuleinae have been characterised within the Ixieae by progressively reduced aerial stems.[51] solitary flowers on the stem branches and woody tunics on the corms. They also often have divided style branches. However, *Crocus* corm tunics are fibrous and membranous rather than woody as in *Syringodea.* Also, *Crocus* has a ridged and often keeled abaxial leaf surface, while that of *Syringodea* is rounded, and the midline adaxial translucency of *Crocus* is lacking in *Syringodea*. *Romulea* is principally distinguished from the other two genera by generally having aerial stems or at least an ovary at ground level, compared with the other acaulescent genera, other differences include unifacial rather than bifacial leaves and the pollen structure.[52][51]\n\n\nWithin the Romuleinae, *Crocus* is a sister group to *Syringodea*, the two genera forming a sister group to *Romulea*.[49][53][15]\n\n\n\n### Subdivision[edit]\n\n\nThe genus Crocus consists of about 200 accepted species, which continue to increase, and has undergone a large number of taxonomic classifications.[29] The genus has often been divided into sections, beginning with that of Haworth (1809)[37] who described two sections based on the presence or absence of hairs in the throat of the flower, while Sabine was the first to realise the importance of the presence or absence of a basal spathe (prophyll) in dividing the genus into two sections,[38] a practice followed by Herbert.[39] However, Sabine's practice of using trinomials for varieties such as *C. sulphureus concolor* is no longer accepted, although Herbert somewhat similarly used varieties and subvarieties, e.g. *C. vernus* var.1 *Communis* subvar. 1. *Obovatus*. Herbert also used geographical distribution as a basis of classification.[29] By the late 19th century Maw (1886),[47] following Herbert, subdivided the genus into two divisions, the *Involucrati* and the *Nudiflori*, and then further divided it into six sections and lastly by flowering times (spring or autumn). Although rejecting the concept of subvarieties, he placed even more emphasis on geography.[54][15][55][29]\n\n\nThe most widely accepted system, that proposed by Brian Mathew in 1982[56] was based on Maw's system, but with less emphasis on flowering times. This mainly depended on three character states: \n\n\n\n* the presence or absence of a prophyll (a basal spathe);\n* the aspect of the style;\n* the corm tunic.\n\n\nand included 81 species, however, one of these, *Crocus medius* was later recognized as a synonym of *Crocus nudiflorus*.[15][53]\n\n\nThe genus, as described by Mathew, consisted of two subgenera, *Crocirus* (monotypic for *Crocus banaticus*) and *Crocus* including the remainder of the species, based on whether the anthers were introrse or extrorse (dehiscence directed towards or away from centre of flower) respectively. Subgenus *Crocus* was then divided into two sections, *Crocus* and *Nudiscapus*, based on the presence or absence of the prophyll. Each section was then further divided into six series of *Crocus* and nine of *Nudiscapus*. These series were defined by the division of the style, the corm tunic, flowering time, leaf structure, presence of a bracteole and anther colour. Mathew also introduced the concept of subspecies, including 50 in all, by giving similar but different forms subspecies status if geographically separated, resulting in about 140 distinct taxa.[15] The seven species and ten subspecies discovered since then have been integrated into revisions of this classification, though new species continue to be described,[57][58][59][53] leading to estimates of at least 200 species.[60][29]\n\n\n\n#### Speciation[edit]\n\n\nCrocus populations have extremely high infra-specific variability with a very diverse spectrum of morphological and phenotypical varieties, while many individual specimens from different species may closely resemble each other. Based on such morphological differences between isolated populations many new species have been named, but without a definition of new species based on molecular and/or karyological information, species can not be confirmed, creating difficulties in determining speciation and hence the exact number of species.[61][62] The situation is even more complex once hybridisation (combination of taxa) and introgression (transfer of genetic material) are considered.[63][29]\n\n\n\n#### Molecular phylogeny[edit]\n\n\nThe availability of molecular phylogeny methods revealed problems with the traditional systems based on morphology alone. The first analysis of the complete genus was carried out by Mathew and colleagues in 2008 using nucleotide sequences from plastid regions. In particular, the DNA data suggest there are no grounds for isolating *C. banaticus* in its own subgenus *Crociris*, though it is a unique species in the genus. Because it has a prophyll at the base of the pedicel, it therefore would fall within section *Crocus*, although its exact relationship to the rest of the subgenus remains unclear.[53]\n\n\nOf the 15 series in the Mathew scheme, only seven were monophyletic, and in particular the largest series, *Biflori* and *Reticulati*, which include a third of all species, were non-monophyletic. Another anomalous species, *C. baytopiorum*, should now be placed in a series of its own, series *Baytopi*. *C. gargaricus* subsp. *herbertii* has been raised to species status, as *C. herbertii*. The autumn-flowering *C. longiflorus*, the type species of series *Longiflori* (long regarded by Mathew as \"a disparate assemblage\"), appeared to lie within series *Verni*. In addition, the position of *C. malyi* was currently unclear.[53]\n\n\nDNA analysis and morphological studies suggest further that series *Reticulati*, *Biflori* and *Speciosi* are \"probably inseparable\", *C. adanensis* and *C. caspius* should probably be removed from *Biflori*, *C. adanensis* falls in a clade with *C. paschei* as a sister group to the species of series *Flavi* and *C. caspius* appears to be sister to the species of series *Orientales*.[53][15]\n\n\nThe study showed \"no support for a system of sections as currently defined\", although, despite the many inconsistencies between Mathew's 1982 classification and the current hypothesis, \"the main assignment of species to the sections and series of that system is actually supported\". The authors state, \"further studies are required before any firm decisions about a hierarchical system of classification can be considered\" and conclude \"future re-classification is likely to involve all infrageneric levels, subgenera, sections and series\".[64] A further study, using the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA), together with a chloroplast marker, broadly confirmed these findings.[15]\n\n\n*Crocus* forms a monophyletic clade, with a basal polytomy of four subclades. The first clade (A) corresponding to section *Crocus*, but including *C. sieberi* and several closely related species (originally included in section *Nudiscapus* series *Reticulati*). The remaining three clades (B-D) include all the remaining species of section *Nudiscapus*. Of these, B and C are small, corresponding to series *Orientales* and *Carpetani* respectively, with all remaining series in the large D clade. The exception is *C. caspius*, originally in series *Biflori*, which segregates in clade B. Thus, although division of the genus into two sections is well supported, no single morphological character defines these two groups. The *C. sieberi* group are assumed to have lost their prophyll secondarily. Of the series, eight could be shown to be monophyletic; *Crocus*, *Kotschyani* and *Scardici* (section *Crocus*) and *Aleppici*, *Carpetani*, *Laevigati*, *Orientalis* and *Speciosi* (section *Nudiscapus*). Flowering season did not correspond to molecular groupings and nor did any of the previously used morphological characteristics, indicating a high degree of homoplasy, in which traits are gained or lost independently in different lineages. The remainder of the series could not be supported as natural groupings. Mathew's concept of subspecies status within *C. biflorus* could not be supported, each being considered a separate species, resulting in the genus having at least 150 species.[15]\n\n\nA more detailed molecular and morphological study of series *Verni* (section *Crocus*) allowed it to be better characterised and circumscribed, as well as the closely related series *Longiflori*. Series *Verni* *sensu* Mathew was found to consist of two groups, the first being *C. vernus* *sensu* Mathew and the other consisting of *C. etruscus*, *ilvensis*, *kosaninii* and *longiflorus*. The taxonomic status of *C. vernus* had been uncertain for some time, given the observation that the name was more properly applied to *C. albiflorus*,[34] requiring a new designation of *C. neapolitanus* for those previously known as *C. vernus*. Subsequently *C. vernus* was split into 5 separate species. The incorporation of *C. longiflorus* into series *Verni* resulted in making series *Longiflori* no longer a legitimate taxonomic unit.[60]\n\n\nIn section *Nudiscapus*, series *Reticulati* was polyphyletic with species intermingled with series *Biflori* and *Speciosi*, requiring a recircumscription, confining *Reticulati* to 8 species, to obtain monophyly.[65] Among the thereby displaced species, are a number of very closely related taxa, referred to as the *Crocus sieberi* aggregate, which has been proposed as a new series *Sieberi*.[29] Other new series, such as *Isauri* and *Lyciotauri*, continue to be created out of the *Biflori* series.[66][67]\n\n\nMathew's circumscription of *Crocus* introduced the rank of subspecies, of which the largest number (14) were those of *Crocus biflorus* Miller, the type species of series *Biflori*, a number which continued to grow. Molecular methods identified these as a polyphyletic assemblage rather than closely related subordinate infraspecific taxa. This necessitated a complete taxonomic revision of series *Biflori*, elevating each subspecies to species status.[61] A similar issue occurs with *C. reticulatus* *sensu* Mathew, who created two subspecies, resulting in 9 newly defined species.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Sections and species[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Crocus species\n\nThe classification of Brian Mathew (1982), as amended in 2009 divides the genus into two sections, further divided by series.[64] The number of series, continues to evolve. \n\n\n\n* Section *Crocus* B.Mathew\n\n\nSpecies with a basal prophyll.

It is derived via Latin *crocus* from the Greek \u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 (*krokos*).[76] This, in turn, is probably a loan word from a Semitic language, related to Hebrew \u05db\u05e8\u05db\u05d5\u05dd *kark\u014dm*,[77] Aramaic \u071f\u071f\u0718\u072a\u071f\u071f\u0721\u0721\u0710 *kurkama*, and Arabic \u0643\u0631\u0643\u0645 *kurkum*, meaning saffron (*Crocus sativus*), \"saffron yellow\" or turmeric (see *Curcuma*), another yellow dye.[78] The word ultimately traces back to the Sanskrit *kunkumam* (\u0915\u0941\u0919\u094d\u0915\u0941\u092e\u0902) for \"saffron\". The English name is a learned 16th-century adoption from the Latin, but Old English already had *croh* for saffron, introduced by the Romans.[47][79][80]\n\n\n\n## Distribution and habitat[edit]\n\n\nCrocuses are distributed from the Mediterranean, from the Iberian peninsula and North Africa, through central and southern Europe, the islands of the Aegean, the Middle East and across central and southwest Asia to Xinjiang in western China, but most species are restricted to Turkey and Asia Minor and the Balkans, with the Balkan Peninsula having the largest number of species (at least 31),[59] forming the centre of diversity, however they are widely introduced.[53][1][81][82] The distribution of species is described over five contiguous areas from west to east (*see map*).[15]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nDistribution map of 16 species of genus *Crocus* in Europe and Asia\n\nHabitats range from sea level to as high as subalpine altitudes, and in a wide range of habitats from woodlands to meadows and deserts, often on stony mountain slopes with good drainage.[83][20] The majority of species are native to areas with cold winters and hot summers with little rain, and active growth is typically from fall to mid-spring.[14] The natural habitats of crocus species are threatened by human activities, including urbanization, industrialization, and other land disturbances and recreational uses. They are negatively impacted by uncontrolled gathering and heavy grazing by livestock.[84]\n\n\n\n* ![Crocus alatavicus](image)\n\n*Crocus alatavicus*\n* ![Crocus aleppicus](image)\n\n*Crocus aleppicus*\n* ![Crocus ancyrensis](image)\n\n*Crocus ancyrensis*\n* ![Crocus banaticus](image)\n\n*Crocus banaticus*\n* ![Crocus biflorus](image)\n\n*Crocus biflorus*\n* ![Crocus cancellatus](image)\n\n*Crocus cancellatus*\n* ![Crocus carpetanus](image)\n\n*Crocus carpetanus*\n* ![Crocus cartwrightianus 'Albus'](image)\n\n*Crocus cartwrightianus* 'Albus'\n* ![Crocus caspius](image)\n\n*Crocus caspius*\n* ![Crocus chrysanthus 'Zwanenburg Bronze'](image)\n\n*Crocus chrysanthus*  \n'Zwanenburg Bronze'\n* ![Crocus corsicus](image)\n\n*Crocus corsicus*\n* ![Crocus etruscus 'Zwanenburg'](image)\n\n*Crocus etruscus* 'Zwanenburg'\n* ![Crocus flavus](image)\n\n*Crocus flavus*\n* ![Crocus goulimyi](image)\n\n*Crocus goulimyi*\n* ![Crocus graveolens](image)\n\n*Crocus graveolens*\n* ![Crocus hyemalis](image)\n\n*Crocus hyemalis*\n* ![Crocus imperati 'De Jager'](image)\n\n*Crocus imperati* 'De Jager'\n* ![Crocus kotschyanus](image)\n\n*Crocus kotschyanus*\n* ![Crocus laevigatus 'Fontenayi'](image)\n\n*Crocus laevigatus* 'Fontenayi'\n* ![Crocus longiflorus](image)\n\n*Crocus longiflorus*\n* ![Crocus malyi](image)\n\n*Crocus malyi*\n* ![Crocus minimus](image)\n\n*Crocus minimus*\n* ![Crocus nevadensis](image)\n\n*Crocus nevadensis*\n* ![Crocus nudiflorus](image)\n\n*Crocus nudiflorus*\n* ![Crocus olivieri](image)\n\n*Crocus olivieri*\n* ![Crocus pallasii](image)\n\n*Crocus pallasii*\n* ![Crocus pulchellus](image)\n\n*Crocus pulchellus*\n* ![Crocus serotinus subsp. clusii](image)\n\n*Crocus serotinus* subsp. *clusii*\n* ![Crocus serotinus subsp. salzmannii](image)\n\n*Crocus serotinus* subsp. *salzmannii*\n* ![Crocus scharojanii](image)\n\n*Crocus scharojanii*\n* ![Crocus tournefortii](image)\n\n*Crocus tournefortii*\n* ![Crocus versicolor](image)\n\n*Crocus versicolor*\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\n![Illustrations of germinating crocus seed](image)Successive stages of germination from seed to seedling (G Maw)\nThe life cycle of *Crocus* species begins with the seed, germinating to a seedling, and a mature plant in 3\u20135 years, however seeds may remain dormant in the soil for several years. The germination stages was first described and illustrated by Maw in his 1886 monograph.[47] In its first year, the crocus produces only a single leaf and creates a corm covered by a thin tunic, about 5\u20138\u00a0mm in size, dependent on the species. In the northern hemisphere, the autumnal crocuses flower between September and November. The vernal (spring) crocuses flowering time depends both on climate and habitat, but is usually mid-winter to spring. Leaves may be synanthous (produced during flowering) or hysteranthous (when the flowers wither away).[85] In the summer, with hot and dry conditions the plant becomes dormant, with all the above ground parts dying back. Colder temperatures in winter then activate the corms.[9] Propagation occurs sexually by seed and asexually by small corms, called cormels or cormlets, produced in the axils of the corms (between tunic scales and body of corm).[10] As the fruit capsule ripens, it emerges from the soil at the base of the flowering stem before dehiscing (splitting open) and releasing the seeds.[86] Seed dispersal may be enhanced by ants, at least in species with arillate seeds.[18]\n\n\nAt night and in overcast weather, the perianth closes. The ovary produces nectar which attracts bees (particularly female bumblebees) and Lepidoptera.[10][87]\n\n\n\n### Pests and diseases[edit]\n\n\nCultivated plants may have their corms consumed by mice and other rodents,[88] including voles, squirrels,[89] and chipmunks. They are also attacked by mildew, gray mold, botrytis, and fusarium rot. Root rot may also occur, caused by *Stromatinia gladioli* and *Pythium* species - the nematode *Pratylenchus penetrans* may also cause root rot.[90] Viruses that are known to infect *Crocus* spp include: Potyviruses, especially bean yellow mosaic virus and also tobacco rattle virus, tobaccos necrosis virus, and cucumber mosaic virus.[91] The foliage may experience rot, rust, and scab diseases and be fed upon by aphids, mites, snails, and slugs.[92] The foliage is eaten by hares, rabbits, and deer; the flowers are sometimes removed by birds, including crows, jackdaws, and magpies.[93]\n\n\n\n\n## Cultivation[edit]\n\n\n![Minoan Fresco of Saffron Gatherer](image)Saffron gatherers in Minoan fresco, Santorini c.\u00a01650BC\n![Photograph of field of saffron crocus growing in Iran](image)Saffron fields in Iran\n### Saffron[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Saffron\n\nThe economic importance of the genus is largely dependent on the single species, *Crocus sativus*, now known only in cultivation.[94] *C. sativus* is grown for the production of saffron, an orange-red derivative of its dried stigma, and among the most expensive spices in the world.[53] The estimated worldwide production of *C. sativus* plants is 205 tons.[8] About 180,000 stigmas from 60,000 flowers are required to produce 1 kilogram (2.2\u00a0lb) saffron, which sells for about $10,000US (2018). Modern saffron production is widely cultivated in Kashmir, Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan and the Mediterranean from Spain to Asia Minor.[8] An important center is the eponymous town of Krokos, in the Kozani region of Greece. The saffron product, Krokos Kozanis is a PDO (Protected Designation of Origin).[95][96] production is largely indigenous and Iran accounts for 65% of global production, covering 72,162\u00a0ha.[8]\n\n\nSaffron is thought to have been used in embalming in Ancient Egypt. it is mentioned in the Old testament, in the Song of Songs as a precious spice and has featured as a dye and fragrance throughout written history, with mention in The Iliad.[8]\n\n\nCultivation and harvesting of *C. sativus* for saffron was first documented in the Mediterranean, notably on the island of Crete. Frescos showing them are found there at the Bronze Age Minoan site of Knossos, as well as from the comparably aged Akrotiri site on the Aegean island of Santorini,[97][98] and formed an important part of the Minoan economy and culture and had both a sacred role and use as a psychoactive drug and food additive.[99][100][8] Women still gather crocuses in the Akrotiri region.[101]\n\n\n\n### Horticulture and floriculture[edit]\n\n\nCrocuses were described in Turkish gardens in the early sixteenth century,[102] gathered from the far reaches of the Ottoman Empire,[103] where they were seen by visiting European botanists and explorers, among the first of whom was Pierre Belon who arrived in Constantinople in 1547. The first crocus seen in the Netherlands, where crocus species were not native, were from corms brought to Vienna in 1562 from Constantinople by the Holy Roman Emperor's ambassador to the Sublime Porte, Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq. A few corms were forwarded to Carolus Clusius at the botanical garden in Leiden.[20] These were almost certainly cultivated varieties rather than wild species.[104] European visitors to Turkey continued to bring back specimens for gardens in their own country. Prominent among the latter were the gardens at Middelburg in the Netherlands. Jehan Somer, a Middelburg merchant, brought back crocuses among his other specimens in 1592, where they attracted the attention not only of Clusius but of the early Dutch flower painters, notably Ambrosius Bosschaert.[105][106] By 1620, new garden varieties had been developed, and featured in contemporary illustrations, such as that of Crispijn van de Passe in his *Hortus floridus* of 1614.[105] There are accounts of crocus gardens in the seventeenth century, such as the Saffron Garth of Walter Stonehouse at Darfield, Yorkshire.[107]\n\n\nCrocuses are among the most important ornamental geophytes in the global flower industry,[108] ranking sixth in terms of Dutch bulb production (2003\u20132008) with 463\u2013668\u00a0ha under cultivation.[109] The crocus is one of the most popular flowers found in the garden in the late winter and early spring.[20] About 30 of the species are cultivated, among the most popular being *C. chrysanthus, C. flavus, C. sieberi, C. tommasinianus and C. vernus*, together with hundreds of cultivars derived from them.[20][8] Both fall and spring blooming crocuses are cultivated for their flowers.[110] Among the first flowers to bloom in spring, their flowering time can vary from fall to the late winter blooming *C. tommasinianus*; the earliest fall blooming species, *C. scharojanii*, may flower during the last weeks of July.[111]\n\n\nThe varieties cultivated for decoration in gardens and pots mainly represent six species: *C. vernus*, *C. chrysanthus*, *C. flavus*, *C. sieberi*, *C. speciosus* and *C.\u00a0tommasinianus*. During the horticulture production year 2009/2010, more than 70 cultivars were grown in Holland, covering an area of 366 hectares; the most common ones were 'Flower Record' and 'King of the Stripes' which accounted for 42 hectares, other species grown included *C. chrysanthus*, *C. tommasinianus*, and *C. flavus* - all are spring blooming plants.[112] But the most commonly grown plants are the Dutch hybrids with large flowers in a rich palette of colors.[113]\n\n\nBoth sexual and asexual means are used to increase the number of plants; seeds and multiplication of corms are the most common means of production, but tissue culture can be used,[114] most commonly for saffron crocus. New corms are formed on top of the older corm which withers away, and cormels are produced from axillary buds.[112] The production of new plants begins with harvested corms in late June to early July, after being graded by corm size the corms are stored around 22 Celsius until early October when they are moved to 17 Celsius until planted later in October and November; flowering occurs in March and the flowers are not removed. Crocuses are also forced to produce flowering plants out of season and the most common species used are *C. vernus* and *C. flavus*, and most of the corms used for forcing come from the Netherlands.[115]\n\n\nSpring flowering types are planted in fall, while fall-blooming types in late summer; typically, the corms are placed 3 to 4 inches deep in well-draining soil in areas with full sun exposure. They do not thrive in heavy clay soils or those that are damp, especially during their summer dormancy period.[116] Commercial crops are produced on raised beds and slopes, to ensure adequate drainage, while horticulturalists often plant on sand beds for the same purpose.[117] Spring flowering types also do well in areas with deciduous trees, where they flower and produce leaves before the trees completely leaf-out. Crocuses are grown in USDA winter zones 3\u20138.[118] Not all species are hardy in the upper zones; *C. sativus* is winter hardy in USDA zones 6 through 8, and *C. pulchellus* is hardy in zones 5 through 8.[92]\n\n\nSome are suitable for naturalizing in grass, but mowing off the foliage before it turns yellow produces short lived plants. Some crocuses, especially *C. tommasinianus* and its selected forms and hybrids (such as 'Whitewell Purple' and 'Ruby Giant'), seed prolifically and are ideal for naturalizing. They can, however, become weeds in rock gardens, where they will often appear in the middle of choice, mat-forming alpine plants, and can be difficult to remove. Crocus flowers and leaves are protected from frost by a waxy cuticle; in areas where snow and frost occasionally occur in the early spring, it is not uncommon to see early flowering crocuses blooming through a light late snowfall.[88]\n\n\n\n* ![field of flowering purple crocuses](image)\n\nfield of flowering purple crocuses\n* ![Crocus 'E.A.

In this painting the cream-colored crocus feathered with bronze at the base of the bouquet reflected varieties on the market at that time. Bosschaert, working from a preparatory drawing to paint his composed piece spanning the whole of spring, exaggerated the crocus so that it passes for a tulip, but its narrow, grass-like leaves give it away.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe crocus is used in many contexts to symbolically denote spring and new beginnings. For instance, it was used as the emblem of the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Poland to symbolise the emergence of new talent.[127]\n\n\n\nCrocus in Art\n![Illustration of a woman picking saffron crocuses from around 1400](image)\nWoman picking saffron crocus  \nc.1400  \n(Tacuinum Sanitatis)\n![Flower painting by Ambrosius Bosschaert 1620](image)\n*Composed Bouquet of Spring Flowers*  \nAmbrosius Bosschaert c.1620\n![Saffron crocus from 1614 book](image)\nSaffron crocus  \nCrispijn van de Passe, 1614\n![Painting of crocuses by Grant Wood from 1912 titled Decorative Landscape with Crocuses](image)\nDecorative Landscape with Crocuses  \nGrant Wood, 1912\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As a perfume (\u1f00\u03c1\u03c9\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd) \"\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u00b7 \u03b2\u03ad\u03bb\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u2019 \u1f10\u03bd \u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03af\u03bd\u1fc3 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u039a\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03af\u1fb3 (the saffron-perfume; the crocus which produces this is best in Aegina and Cilicia)\".
