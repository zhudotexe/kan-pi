Its best-known brands include its ThinkPad business line of laptop computers (acquired from IBM), the IdeaPad, Yoga, and Legion consumer lines of laptop computers, and the IdeaCentre and ThinkCentre lines of desktop computers. As of 2021, Lenovo is the world's largest personal computer vendor by unit sales.[8][9]\n\n\nLenovo has operations in over 60 countries and sells its products in around 180+ countries.[*citation needed*] It was incorporated in Hong Kong,[1] with global headquarters in Beijing, and Morrisville, North Carolina, United States.[2][3] It has research centres in Beijing, Chengdu, Yamato (Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan), Singapore, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Morrisville,[4] and also has Lenovo NEC Holdings, a joint venture with NEC that produces personal computers for the Japanese market.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1984\u20131993: Founding and early history[edit]\n\n\nLenovo was founded in Beijing on 1 November 1984 as **Legend** by a team of engineers led by Liu Chuanzhi and Danny Lui. Initially specializing in televisions, the company migrated towards manufacturing and marketing computers.\n\n![](image)In 1984, Lenovo was founded in Beijing by a team of 4 guards in a shack from the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), led by Liu Chuanzhi.[10]\nLiu Chuanzhi and his group of ten experienced engineers, teaming up with Danny Lui,[11] officially founded Lenovo in Beijing on November 1, 1984, with 200,000 yuan.[10][12] The Chinese government approved Lenovo's incorporation on the same day. Jia Xufu (\u8d3e\u7eed\u798f), one of the founders of Lenovo, indicated that the first meeting in preparation for starting the company was held on October 17 the same year. Eleven people, the entirety of the initial staff, attended. Each of the founders was a member of the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The 200,000 yuan used as start-up capital was approved by Zeng Maochao (\u66fe\u8302\u671d). The name for the company agreed upon at this meeting was the Chinese Academy of Sciences Computer Technology Research Institute New Technology Development Company.[10] Lenovo has increasingly diversified from the personal computer market and made a number of corporate acquisitions, with the most notable being acquiring and integrating most of IBM's personal computer business and its x86-based server business as well as creating its own smartphone.[13]\n\n\nThe organizational structure of the company was established in 1985 after the Chinese New Year. It included technology, engineering, administrative, and office departments.[10] The group first attempted to import televisions but failed. It rebuilt itself as a company doing quality checks on computers. It also tried and failed to market a digital watch.[14]\n\n\nIn May 1988, Lenovo placed its first recruitment advertisement on the front page of the *China Youth News*. Such ads were quite rare in China at the time. Out of the 500 respondents, 280 were selected to take a written employment exam. 120 of these candidates were interviewed in person. Although interviewers initially only had the authority to hire 16 people, 58 were given offers. The new staff included 18 people with graduate degrees, 37 with undergraduate degrees, and three students with no university-level education. Yang Yuanqing, the current chairman and CEO of Lenovo, was among that group.[10]\n\n\nLiu Chuanzhi received government permission to form a subsidiary in Hong Kong and to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in Hong Kong along with Lui, furthered his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to Hong Kong in 1988. To save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. To keep up appearances, they rented hotel rooms for meetings.[10]\n\n\nIn 1990, Lenovo started to manufacture and market computers using its own brand name.[14] Some of the company's early successes included the KT8920 mainframe computer.[10] It also developed a circuit board that allowed IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters.[14]\n\n\n\n### 1994\u20131998: IPO, second offerings and bond sales[edit]\n\n\nLenovo (known at the time as Legend) became publicly traded after a 1994 Hong Kong IPO that raised nearly US$30 million[15] at HK$1.33 per share.[16] Prior to the IPO, many analysts were optimistic about Lenovo. On its first day of trading, the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00 suggesting an initial under-valuing of the company. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America and Australia, to expand and improve production and research and development, and to increase working capital.[10]\n\n\nBy 1996, Lenovo was the market leader in China and began selling its own laptop.[15] By 1998 it held 43 per cent of the domestic computer market share in China, selling approximately one million computers.[15]\n\n\nLenovo released its Tianxi (\u5929\u79a7) computer in 1998. Designed to make it easy for inexperienced Chinese consumers to use computers and access the internet, one of its most important features was a button that instantly connected users to the internet and opened the Web browser. It was co-branded with China Telecom and it was bundled with one year of Internet service. The Tianxi was released in 1998. It was the result of two years of research and development. It had a pastel-colored, shell-shaped case and a seven-port USB hub under its screen. As of 2000, the Tianxi was the best-selling computer in Chinese history. It sold more than 1,000,000 units in 2000 alone.[17]\n\n\n\n### 1999\u20132010: IBM purchase and sale of smartphone division[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The ThinkPad logo, as seen on the Lenovo ThinkPad X100e laptop computer. Lenovo purchased the ThinkPad line from IBM in 2005.Further information: Acquisition of the IBM PC business by Lenovo\n\nTo fund its continued growth, Lenovo issued a secondary offering of 50 million shares on the Hong Kong market in March 2000 and raised about US$212 million.[10] It rebranded to the name Lenovo in 2003 and began making acquisitions to expand the company.[15]\n\n\nLenovo acquired IBM's personal computer business in 2005, including the ThinkPad laptop and ThinkCentre desktop lines.[18] Lenovo's acquisition of IBM's personal computer division accelerated access to foreign markets while improving Lenovo's branding and technology.[19] Lenovo paid US$1.25 billion for IBM's computer business and assumed an additional US$500 million of IBM's debt. This acquisition made Lenovo the third-largest computer maker worldwide by volume.[20]\nLenovo's purchase of the Think line from IBM also led to the creation of the IBM/Lenovo partnership, which works together in the creation of Think-line of products sold by Lenovo.\n\n\nOn the purchase of IBM's personal computer division, Chuanzhi said in 2012: \"We benefited in three ways from the IBM acquisition. We got the ThinkPad brand, IBM's more advanced PC manufacturing technology and the company's international resources, such as its global sales channels and operation teams. These three elements have shored up our sales revenue in the past several years.\"[20] The employees of the division, including those who developed ThinkPad laptops and Think Centre desktops, became employees of Lenovo.\n\n\nDespite Lenovo acquiring the \"Think\" brand from IBM, IBM still plays a key indirect, background role in the design and production of the Think line of products. Today, IBM is responsible for overseeing servicing and repair centers, and is considered an authorized distributor and refurbisher of the Think line of products produced by Lenovo.[21]\n\n\nIBM also acquired a 18.9% share of Lenovo in 2005 as part of Lenovo's purchase of IBM's personal computing division.[22] In the years following the deal, IBM sold their stake in Lenovo, with a final sale in 2011 completing their divestment.[23]\n\n\nMary Ma, Lenovo's chief financial officer from 1990 to 2007, was in charge of investor relations. Under her leadership, Lenovo successfully integrated Western-style accountability into its corporate culture. Lenovo's emphasis on transparency earned it a reputation for the best corporate governance among mainland Chinese firms. While Hong Kong-listed firms were only required to issue financial reports twice per year, Lenovo followed the international norm of issuing quarterly reports. Lenovo created an audit committee and a compensation committee with non-management directors. The company started roadshows twice per year to meet institutional investors. Ma organized the first-ever investor relations conference held in mainland China. The conference was held in Beijing in 2002 and televised on China Central Television (CCTV). Liu and Ma co-hosted the conference and both gave speeches on corporate governance.[10]\n\n\nLenovo sold its smartphone and tablet division in 2008 for US$100 million in order to focus on personal computers and then paid US$200 million to buy it back in November 2009.[24] As of 2009[update], the mobile division ranked third in terms of unit share in China's mobile handset market.[25] Lenovo invested CN\u00a5100 million in a fund dedicated to providing seed funding for mobile application development for its LeGarden online app store. As of 2010, LeGarden had more than 1,000 programs available for the LePhone. At the same time, LeGarden counted 2,774 individual developers and 542 developer companies as members.[26]\n\n\n\n### 2011\u20132013: Re-entering smartphone market and other ventures[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Lenovo Vibe X smartphone at a launch event, 2014\nOn January 27, 2011, Lenovo formed a joint venture to produce personal computers with Japanese electronics firm NEC. The companies said in a statement that they would establish a new company called Lenovo NEC Holdings, to be registered in the Netherlands. NEC received US$175 million in Lenovo stock. Lenovo was to own a 51% stake in the joint venture, while NEC would have 49%. Lenovo has a five-year option to expand its stake in the joint venture.[27]\n\n\nThis joint venture was intended to boost Lenovo's worldwide sales by expanding its presence in Japan, a key market for personal computers. NEC spun off its personal computer business into the joint venture. As of 2010, NEC controlled about 20% of Japan's market for personal computers while Lenovo had a 5% share. Lenovo and NEC also agreed to explore cooperating in other areas such as servers and tablet computers.[28]\n\n\nRoderick Lappin, chairman of the Lenovo\u2013NEC joint venture, told the press that the two companies will expand their co-operation to include the development of tablet computers.[29]\n\n\nIn June 2011, Lenovo announced that it planned to acquire control of Medion, a German electronics manufacturing company. Lenovo said the acquisition would double its share of the German computer market, making it the third-largest vendor by sales (after Acer and Hewlett-Packard). The deal, which closed in the third quarter of the same year, was claimed by *The New York Times* as \"the first in which a Chinese company acquired a well-known German company.\"[30]\n\n\nThis acquisition will give Lenovo 14% of the German computer market. Gerd Brachmann, chairman of Medion, agreed to sell two-thirds of his 60 per cent stake in the company. He will be paid in cash for 80 per cent of the shares and will receive 20 per cent in Lenovo stock. That would give him about one per cent of Lenovo.[30]\n\n\nIn September 2012, Lenovo agreed to acquire the Brazil-based electronics company Digibras, which sells products under the brand-name CCE, for a base price of 300 million reales (US$148 million) in a combination of stock and cash. An additional payment of 400 million reales was made dependent upon performance benchmarks.[31][32] Prior to its acquisition of CCE, Lenovo already established a $30 million factory in Brazil, but Lenovo's management had felt that they needed a local partner to maximize regional growth. Lenovo cited their desire to take advantage of increased sales due to the 2014 World Cup that would be hosted by Brazil and the 2016 Summer Olympics and CCE's reputation for quality.[33] Following the acquisition, Lenovo announced that its subsequent acquisitions would be concentrated in software and services.[34]\n\n\n\n![](image)The signing ceremony for the LenovoEMC joint venture, with Yang Yuanqing standing in the middle (fifth from the left) in the back row\nIn September 2012, Lenovo agreed to acquire the United States-based software company Stoneware, in its first software acquisition. The transaction was expected to close by the end of 2012; no financial details have been disclosed.[35][36] Lenovo said that the company was acquired in order to gain access to new technology and that Stoneware is not expected to significantly affect earnings. More specifically, Stoneware was acquired to further Lenovo's efforts to improve and expand its cloud-computing services. For the two years prior to its acquisition, Stoneware partnered with Lenovo to sell its software. During this period Stoneware's sales doubled. Stoneware was founded in 2000. As of September 2012, Stoneware is based in Carmel, Indiana and has 67 employees.[37][38]\n\n\nLenovo re-entered the smartphone market in 2012 and quickly became the largest vendor of smartphones in mainland China.[39] Entry into the smartphone market was paired with a change of strategy from \"the one-size-fits-all\" to a diverse portfolio of devices.[40] These changes were driven by the popularity of Apple's iPhone and Lenovo's desire to increase its market share in mainland China. Lenovo surpassed Apple Inc. to become the No.\u00a02 provider of smartphones in the domestic Chinese market in 2012.[40] However, with approximately 100 smartphone brands sold in China, this only equated to a 10.4% market share.[40]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Lenovo announced an investment of US$793 million in the construction of a mobile phone manufacturing and R&D facility in Wuhan, Hubei.[41]\n\n\nIn 2013, Lenovo created a joint venture with EMC named Iomega.[42] The venture took over Iomega's business and rebranded all of Iomega's products under the LenovoEMC brand, and designed products for small and medium-sized businesses that could not afford enterprise-class data storage.[43][44][45] Lenovo has since retired all of the LenovoEMC products on their product page advising that the products are no longer available for purchase on lenovo.com.[46]\n\n\n\n### 2014\u2013present: Purchase of IBM server lines and other acquisitions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nCorporate logo (1984\u20132003)\n![](image)\nCorporate logo (2003\u20132015)\n![](image)\nCorporate logo (2015\u2013present)\n\nIBM sold its x86-based server lines, including Lenovo System x and Lenovo Blade Center, to Lenovo in 2014.[47] Lenovo says it will gain access to more enterprise customers, improve its profit margins, and develop a closer relationship with Intel, the maker of most server processors, through its acquisition of IBM's x86-based server business.[48] On 1 October 2014, Lenovo closed its acquisition of IBM's server division, with the final price put at $2.1 billion.[49] Lenovo said this acquisition came in at a price lower than the previously announced $2.3 billion partially because of a change in the value of IBM inventories. The deal has been already approved by Europe, China and the United States. The United States Department of Treasury Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) was reportedly the last hurdle for Lenovo, since the United States has the strictest policies. According to Timothy Prickett-Morgan from Enterprise Tech, the deal still awaits \"approval of regulators in China, the European Commission, and Canada\".[50]\n\n\nAfter closing, Lenovo said that its goal was to become the world's largest maker of servers. Lenovo also announced plans to start integrating IBM's workforce.[51] The acquisition added about 6,500 new employees to Lenovo. Lenovo said that it has no immediate intent to cut jobs. Lenovo said that positions in research and development and customer-facing roles such as marketing would be \"100% protected\", but expected \"rationalization\" of its supply chain and procurement.[52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Motorola Moto X\nOn 29 January 2014, Google announced it would sell Motorola Mobility to Lenovo for US$2.91 billion. As of February 2014, Google owned about 5.94% of Lenovo's stock. The deal included smartphone lines like the Moto X, Moto G, Droid Turbo, and the future Motorola Mobility product roadmap, while Google retained the Advanced Technologies & Projects unit and all but 2,000 of the company's patents.[53] Lenovo received royalty free licenses to all the patents retained by Google.[54] Lenovo received approval from the European Union for its acquisition of Motorola in June 2014.[55] The acquisition was completed on 30 October 2014. Motorola Mobility remained headquartered in Chicago, and continued to use the Motorola brand, but Liu Jun, president of Lenovo's mobile device business, became the head of the company.[56][57]\n\n\nIn April 2014, Lenovo purchased a portfolio of patents from NEC related to mobile technology. These included over 3,800 patent families in countries around the world. The purchase included standards-essential patents for 3G and LTE cellular technologies and other patents related to smartphones and tablets.[58]\n\n\nIn May 2015, Lenovo revealed a new logo at Lenovo Tech World in Beijing, with the slogan \"Innovation Never Stands Still\" (Chinese: \u521b\u65b0\u65e0\u6b62\u5883). Lenovo's new logo, created by Saatchi, can be changed by its advertising agencies and sales partners, within restrictions, to fit the context. It has a lounging \"e\" and is surrounded by a box that can be changed to use a relevant scene, solid color, or photograph. Lenovo's Chief Marketing Officer David Roman said, \"When we first started looking at it, it wasn't about just a change in typography or the look of the logo. We asked 'If we really are a net-driven, customer-centric company, what should the logo look like?' We came up with the idea of a digital logo first [...] designed to be used on the internet and adaptable to context.\"[59]\n\n\nIn early June 2015, Lenovo announced plans to sell up to US$650 million in five-year bonds denominated in Chinese yuan. The bonds were sold in Hong Kong with coupon ranging from 4.95% to 5.05%. This is only the second sale of bonds in Lenovo's history. Financial commentators noted that Lenovo was paying a premium to list the bonds in yuan given relatively low costs for borrowing in US dollars.[60]\n\n\nLenovo said that its x86 servers will be available to all its channel partners. Lenovo plans to cut prices on x86 products in order to gain market share.[61] This goes in alliance with IBM's vision of the future around cloud technologies and their own POWER processor architecture.[62]\n\n\nLenovo's acquisition of IBM's businesses is arguably one of the greatest case studies on merging massive international enterprises. Though this acquisition in 2005 ultimately resulted in success, the integration of the businesses had a difficult and challenging beginning. Lenovo had employees from different cultures, different backgrounds, and different languages.[63] These differences caused misunderstandings, hampering trust and the ability to build a new corporate culture. At the end of its first two years, Lenovo Group had met many of its original challenges, including integrating two disparate cultures in the newly formed company, maintaining the Think brand image for quality and innovation, and improving supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies.[64] However, Lenovo had failed to meet a key objective of the merger: leveraging the combined strength of the two companies to grow volume and market share.[64] In order to achieve success, Lenovo embraced diversification at multiple levels- business model, culture, and talent. By 2015, Lenovo grew into the world's number 1 PC maker, number 3 smartphone manufacturer and number 3 in the production of tablet computers.[65]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Lenovo announced it was partnering with Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based software storage virtualization company DataCore to add DataCore's parallel I/O-processing software to Lenovo's storage devices.[66] The servers were reportedly designed to outperform Storage Area Network (SAN) SAN arrays.[66]\n\n\nIn 2017, Lenovo formed a joint venture with Fujitsu and the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ).[67] In the joint venture, Fujitsu would sell Lenovo a 51% stake in **Fujitsu Client Computing Limited**. DBJ would acquire a 5% stake.\n\n\nIn September 2018, Lenovo and NetApp announced about strategic partnership and joint venture in China. As part of strategic partnership Lenovo started two new lines of storage systems: DM-Series and DE-Series. Both storage systems using Lenovo hardware and NetApp software: DM-Series using ONTAP OS and DE-Series SANtricity OS.\n\n\nIn 2018, Lenovo became the world's largest provider for the TOP500 supercomputers.[68]\n\n\nIn 2020, Lenovo became a preferred data center innovation provider for DreamWorks Animation starting with Trolls World Tour.\n\n\nOn 12 January 2021, Lenovo filed an application to issue Chinese depositary receipts, representing newly issued ordinary shares, and to list them on the Science and Technology Innovation Board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange.[69]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Lenovo was reorganized into three divisions: The Intelligent Devices Group for PCs, Smartphones, Smart Collaboration products, Augmented and Virtual Reality solutions and Internet of Things devices, the Infrastructure Solutions Group (formally known as Data Center Group) for smart infrastructure solutions, and the Solutions and Services Group focused on services and industry-specific products.[70] That year, the company hit $60 billion in annual revenues.[71][72]\n\n\nOn 8 October 2021, Lenovo withdrew its application to list on the Shanghai Stock Exchange just days after it had been accepted by the exchange, citing the possibility of the validity of financial information in its prospectus lapsing as the reason. The price of the company's shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped by over 17% following the news, which was its biggest intraday decline in over a decade.[73][74]\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lenovo advertisement at the Consumer Electronics Show, 2012\n\"Lenovo\" is a portmanteau of \"Le-\" (from Legend) and \"novo\", Latin ablative for \"new\". The Chinese name (simplified Chinese: \u8054\u60f3; traditional Chinese: \u806f\u60f3; pinyin: *Li\u00e1nxi\u01ceng\u24d8*) means \"association\" (as in \"association of ideas\"), \"associative thinking\", or \"connected thinking\". It also implies creativity.[75] \"Lianxiang\" was first used to refer to a layout of Chinese typewriters in the 1950s organized into groups of common words and phrases rather than the standard dictionary layout.[76]\n\n\nFor the first 20 years of its existence, the company's English name was \"Legend\". In 2002, Yang Yuanqing decided to abandon the Legend English name to expand beyond the Chinese home market. \"Legend\" was already in use worldwide by many businesses whose products and services may or may not have to do with technology,[77] making it impossible to register in many jurisdictions outside China. In April 2003, the company publicly announced its new English name, \"Lenovo\", with an advertising campaign including huge billboards and primetime television ads. Lenovo spent 18 million RMB on an eight-week television advertising campaign. The billboards showed the Lenovo logo against blue sky with a slogan that read, \"Transcendence depends on how you think.\" By the end of 2003, Lenovo had spent a total of 200 million RMB on rebranding.[10]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\nLenovo is a manufacturer of personal computers, smartphones, televisions, and wearable devices. Some of the company's earliest products included the KT8920 mainframe computer[10] and a circuit board that allowed IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters.[14] One of its first computers was the Tianxi (\u5929\u79a7), released in 1998 in the Chinese market. It became the best selling computer in Chinese history in 2000.[17]\n\n\n\n### Personal and business computing[edit]\n\n\nLenovo markets the ThinkPad, IdeaPad, Yoga, Legion and Xiaoxin (\u5c0f\u65b0; Chinese market only) lines of laptops, as well as the IdeaCentre and ThinkCentre lines of desktops.[78] It expanded significantly in 2005 through its acquisition of IBM's personal computer business, including its ThinkPad and ThinkCentre lines. As of January 2013, shipments of THINK-branded computers have doubled since Lenovo's takeover of the brand, with profit margins thought to be above 5%.[79] Lenovo aggressively expanded the THINK brand away from traditional laptop computers in favor of tablets and hybrid devices such as the ThinkPad Tablet 2, ThinkPad Yoga, ThinkPad 8, ThinkPad Helix, and ThinkPad Twist; the shift came as a response to the growing popularity of mobile devices, and the release of Windows 8 in October 2012. Lenovo achieved significant success with this high-value strategy and in 2013 controlled more than 40% of the market for Windows computers priced above $900 in the United States.[80]\n\n\n\n#### ThinkPad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: ThinkPad\n\n![](image)A Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Series Ultrabook with extensive use of lightweight and durable carbon fibre technology[81][82]\nThe ThinkPad is a line of business-oriented laptop known for their boxy black design, modeled after a traditional Japanese *bento*.[83] The ThinkPad was originally an IBM product developed at the Yamato Facility in Japan by Arimasa Naitoh (\u5185\u85e4\u5728\u6b63, *Nait\u014d Arimasa*);[84] they have since been developed, manufactured and sold by both IBM and Lenovo after early 2005, following its acquisition of IBM's personal computer division. The ThinkPad has been used in space and was the only laptop model certified for use on the International Space Station until 2016.[85][86]\n\n\n\n#### ThinkCentre[edit]\n\n\nMain article: ThinkCentre\n\nThe ThinkCentre is a line of business-oriented desktop computers which was introduced in 2003 by IBM and since has been produced and sold by Lenovo since 2005.[87] ThinkCentre computers typically include mid-range to high-end processors, options for discrete graphics cards, and multi-monitor support. Similar to the ThinkPad line of computers, there have been budget lines of ThinkCentre branded computers in the past. Some examples of this include: M55e series, A50 series, M72 series. These \"budget\" lines are typically \"thin clients\" however, meaning they are not standalone computers, rather, they are access points to a central server.[88]\n\n\n\n#### ThinkServer, followed by ThinkSystem[edit]\n\n\nMain article: ThinkServer\n\nThe ThinkServer product line began with the TS100 from Lenovo.[89] The server was developed under an agreement with IBM, by which Lenovo would produce single-socket and dual-socket servers based on IBM's xSeries technology.[89] An additional feature of the server design was a support package aimed at small businesses.[89] The focus of this support package was to provide small businesses with software tools to ease the process of server management and reduce dependence on IT support.[90]\n\n\nOn June 20, 2017, Lenovo's Data Center Group relaunched the ThinkServer product line as ThinkSystem,[91] which consisted of 17 new machine type models, in the catalog formate containing form factors such as Tower, 1U/2U, Blades, Dense and 4U Mission Critical Intel-based servers. Also within this relaunch contained a portfolio of Storage Arrays and of Fibre Channel SAN Switches and Directors. To further incorporate industry-leading partnerships into its portfolio, Lenovo struck an agreement with the processor company, AMD, to be able to supply customers with a choice of options between both Intel and AMD powered appliances. In August, 2019, the first two ThinkSystem platforms were introduced to the market containing a single AMD EPYC processor, the SR635 (1U) and the SR655 (2U).[92] Again, in May 2020, Lenovo DCG further expanded its AMD offerings to incorporate 2-proc systems, the SR645 and the SR665,[93] continuing tio exemplify its approach to being the Most Trusted Data Center Advisor in the market.[94]\n\n\n\n#### ThinkStation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: ThinkStation\n\nLenovo ThinkStations are workstations designed for high-end computing. In 2008, IBM/Lenovo expanded the focus of its THINK brand to include workstations, with the ThinkStation S10 being the first model released.\n\n\n\n#### ThinkVision[edit]\n\n\nMain article: ThinkVision\n\nHigh-end monitors are marketed under the ThinkVision name. ThinkVision displays share a common design language with other THINK devices such as the ThinkPad line of laptop computers and ThinkCentre line of desktop computers. At the 2014 International CES, Lenovo announced the ThinkVision Pro2840m, a 28-inch 4K display aimed at professionals. Lenovo also announced another 28-inch 4K touch-enabled device running Android that can function as an all-in-one PC or an external display for other devices.[95]\n\n\nAt the 2016 International CES, Lenovo announced two displays with both USB-C and DisplayPort connectivity. The ThinkVision X24 Pro monitor is a 24-inch 1920 by 1080 pixel thin-bezel display that uses an IPS LCD panel. The ThinkVision X1 is a 27-inch 3840 by 2160 pixel thin-bezel display that uses a 10-bit panel with 99% coverage of the sRGB color gamut. The X24 includes a wireless charging base for mobile phones. The X1 is the first monitor to receive the TUV Eye-Comfort certification. Both monitors have HDMI 2.0 ports, support charging laptops, mobile phones, and other devices, and have Intel RealSense 3D cameras in order to support facial recognition. Both displays have dual-array microphones and 3-watt stereo speakers.[96]\n\n\n\n#### IdeaPad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: IdeaPad\n\n![](image)A Lenovo IdeaPad U350 at a launch event in Japan, 2009\nThe IdeaPad line of consumer-oriented laptops was introduced in January 2008. The IdeaPad is the result of Lenovo's own research and development; Unlike the ThinkPad line, its design and branding were not inherited from IBM nor are they designed/developed by IBM.\n\n\nThe IdeaPad's design language differs markedly from the ThinkPad and has a more consumer-focused look and feel.[97][98]\n\n\nOn September 21, 2016, Lenovo confirmed that their Yoga series is not meant to be compatible with Linux operating systems, that they know it is impossible to install Linux on some models, and that it is not supported.[99] This came in the wake of media coverage of problems that users were having while trying to install Ubuntu on several Yoga models, including the 900 ISK2, 900 ISK For Business, 900S, and 710, which were traced back to Lenovo disabling and removing support for the AHCI storage mode for the device's Solid State Drive in the computer's BIOS, in favor of a RAID mode that is only supported by Windows 10 drivers that come with the system.[100][101][102][103] Lenovo has since released an alternative firmware that has restored the AHCI mode to the drive controller to allow installation of Linux operating systems.[104][105]\n\n\n\n#### IdeaCentre[edit]\n\n\nMain article: IdeaCentre\n\nAll IdeaCentres are all-in-one machines, combining processor and monitor into a single unit.[106] The desktops were described by HotHardware as being \"uniquely designed\".[106] The first IdeaCentre desktop, the IdeaCentre K210, was announced by Lenovo on 30 June 2008.[107] While the IdeaCentre line consists only of desktops, it shares design elements and features with the IdeaPad line.[107] One such feature was Veriface facial recognition technology.[107]\n\n\nAt CES 2011, Lenovo announced the launch of four IdeaCentre desktops: the A320, B520, B320, and C205.[106] In the autumn of 2012, the firm introduced the more powerful IdeaCentre A720, with a 27-inch touchscreen display and running Windows 8.[108] With a TV tuner and HDMI in, the A720 can also serve as a multimedia hub or home theater PC.[109]\n\n\nIn 2013, Lenovo added a table computer to the IdeaCentre line. The Lenovo IdeaCentre Horizon, introduced at the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show is a 27-inch touchscreen computer designed to lay flat for simultaneous use by multiple people. Thanks to its use of Windows 8, the Horizon can also serve as a desktop computer when set upright.[110]\n\n\n\n#### Legion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lenovo Legion\n\nLegion is a series of laptops and tablets from Lenovo targeting gaming performance. The first Legion brand laptops was revealed at CES 2017, the Legion Y520 and the Legion Y720.[111] On June 6, 2017, a high-performance model, the Legion Y920, equipped with Intel's seventh-generation quad-core i7-7820HK and Nvidia GTX 1070 discrete graphics, was launched.[112][113]\n\n\nAt E3 2018, Lenovo announced three new laptops with new redesigned chassis, Y530, Y730 and Y7000.[114]\n\n\nIn 2020, Lenovo launched Legion 3, 5, and 7, where Legion 7 is the highest specification of the series.\n\n\nIn 2021, Lenovo launched Legion 5 pro with AMD 5th series CPU and Nvidia 30,s GPU.[115]\n\n\n\n### Smartphones[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lenovo smartphones\n\n![](image)The Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 from front and back\nAs of January 2013, Lenovo only manufactured phones that use the Android operating system from Google. Numerous press reports indicated that Lenovo planned to release a phone running Windows Phone 8, According to J.\u00a0D. Howard, a vice president at Lenovo's mobile division, the company would release a Windows Phone product if there is market demand.[116]\n\n\nLenovo has implemented an aggressive strategy to replace Samsung Electronics as Mainland China market's top smartphone vendor. It has spent $793.5 million in Wuhan in order to build a plant that can produce 30 to 40 million phones per year. Data from Analysys International shows that Lenovo experienced considerable growth in smartphone sales in China during 2012. Specifically, it saw its market share increase to 14.2% during 2012's third quarter, representing an increase when compared to 4.8% in the same quarter of 2011. IDC analysts said that Lenovo's success is due to its \"aggressive ramping-up and improvements in channel partnerships\". Analysys International analyst Wang Ying wrote, \"Lenovo possesses an obvious advantage over rivals in terms of sales channels.\" The company's CEO, Yang Yuanqing, said, \"Lenovo does not want to be the second player ... we want to be the best. Lenovo has the confidence to outperform Samsung and Apple, at least in the Chinese market.\"[117]\n\n\nAccording to IHS iSuppli, Lenovo was a top-three smartphone maker in China with a 16.5% market share in the first quarter of 2012. According to a May report released by IDC Lenovo ranks fourth in the global tablet market by volume.[118] As of November 2012, Lenovo was the second largest seller of mobile phones in China when measured by volume.[39]\n\n\nIn May 2013, Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing indicated that the company had aimed to release smartphones in the United States within the next year. Later in October, Lenovo expressed interest in acquiring the Canadian smartphone maker BlackBerry Limited. However, its attempt was reportedly blocked by the Government of Canada, citing security concerns due to the use of BlackBerry devices by prominent members of the government. An official stated that \"we have been pretty consistent that the message is Canada is open to foreign investment and investment from China in particular but not at the cost of compromising national security\".[119][120]\n\n\nIn January 2014, Lenovo announced a proposed deal to acquire Motorola Mobility to bolster its plans for the U.S. market.[121] Microsoft officially announced that Lenovo had become the hardware partner of Windows Phone platform at the Mobile World Congress 2014.[122] In January 2016, Lenovo announced at CES that the company would be producing the first Tango phone.[123]\n\n\nLenovo plus Motorola was the 3rd largest producer of smartphones by volume in the world between 2011 and 2014.[124] Since Lenovo's acquisition of Motorola Mobility, the combined global market share of Lenovo plus Motorola has fallen from 7.2% in 2014 to 3.9% in the third quarter of 2016.[125][126] A number of factors have been cited as the cause of this reduced demand, including the fact that Lenovo relied heavily on carriers to sell its phones, its phones lacked strong branding and unique features to distinguish them in the competitive Chinese market where a weak economy and saturated market is slowing demand[127][128] and the culture clash between a more hierarchical PC company and the need to be nimble to sell rapidly-evolving smartphones.[129] In response to the weak sales, Lenovo announced in August 2015 that it would lay off 3,200 employees, mostly in its Motorola smartphone business.[130]\n\n\nIn the reorganization which followed, Lenovo was uncertain how to brand its Motorola smartphones. In November 2015, members of Lenovo management made statements that Lenovo would use the Motorola brand for all its smartphones.[131] Then, in January 2016, Lenovo announced that it would be eliminating the Motorola brand in favor of \"Moto by Lenovo\". The company reversed course in March 2017 and announced that the Motorola brand name would be used in all regions in future products. \"In 2016, we just finished transforming ourselves,\" Motorola Chairman and President Aymar de Lencquesaing said in an interview, \"We have clarity on how we present ourselves.\"[132]\n\n\n\n### Smart televisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lenovo LeTV\n\n![](image)A Lenovo A30 TV set-top box\nIn November 2011, Lenovo said it would soon unveil a Smart TV product called LeTV, expected for release in the first quarter of 2012. \"The PC, communications and TV industries are currently undergoing a \"smart\" transformation. In the future, users will have many smart devices and will desire an integrated experience of hardware, software and cloud services.\" Liu Jun, president of Lenovo's mobile-Internet and digital-home-business division.[133] In June 2013 Lenovo announced a partnership with Sharp to produce smart televisions. In March 2014, Lenovo announced that it projected smart television sales surpassing one million units for 2014. The same month Lenovo released its flagship S9 Smart TV.[134]\n\n\n\n### Wearables[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Lenovo Smartwatch on display at the 2015 Mobile World Congress\nRumors that Lenovo was developing a wearable device were confirmed in October 2014 after the company submitted a regulatory finding to the Federal Communications Commission. The device, branded a \"Smartband\", has a battery life of seven days. It has an optical heart-rate monitor and can be used to track distance and time spent running and calories burned. It can also notify the user of incoming calls and texts.[135] It can also unlock computers without the use of a password. The Smartband went on sale in October 2014. Lenovo started offering the device for sale on its website without a formal product announcement.[136]\n\n\n\n### IoT / Smart Home[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015 Lenovo launched a strategic cooperation with IngDan (\u786c\u86cb), a subsidiary of Chinese electronics e-commerce company Cogobuy Group, to penetrate into the intelligent hardware sector.[137] \u00a0Lenovo wanted to procure High-Tech hardware in the then newly emerging Internet of Things (IoT) economy[138] and formed a strategic partnership with Cogobuy in which it previously primarily bought IC components from.[139] Cogobuy's supply chain was utilised by Lenovo to procure consumer devices and bridge gaps in their proprietary hardware and software development.[140] At the IFA 2018, Lenovo launched several Home automation products.[141]\n\n\n\n### Lenovo Connect[edit]\n\n\nAt the Mobile World Congress in 2016, Lenovo introduced Lenovo Connect, a wireless roaming service. This service works across devices, networks, and borders for customers in China and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa). Lenovo Connect eliminates the need to buy new SIM cards when crossing borders. Lenovo Connect started service for phones and select ThinkPad laptops in China in February 2016.[142]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nLenovo's principal facilities are in Beijing, Singapore, and Morrisville, North Carolina, United States, with research centres in Beijing, Singapore, Morrisville, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu, Nanjing,[143] Wuhan[144] and Yamato (Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan).[145] Lenovo operates manufacturing facilities in Chengdu and Hefei in China, and in Japan. A 700-square-metre (7,500\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) global flagship opened in Beijing in February 2013.[40]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Lenovo R&D center in Shenzhen, Guangdong\nLenovo's manufacturing operations are a departure from the usual industry practice of outsourcing to contract manufacturers. Lenovo instead focuses on vertical integration in order to avoid excessive reliance on original equipment manufacturers and to keep down costs.[146] Speaking on this topic, Yang Yuanqing said, \"Selling PCs is like selling fresh fruit. The speed of innovation is very fast, so you must know how to keep up with the pace, control inventory, to match supply with demand and handle very fast turnover.\" Lenovo benefited from its vertical integration after flooding affected hard-drive manufacturers in Thailand in 2011, as the company could continue manufacturing operations by shifting production towards products for which hard drives were still available.[147][148]\n\n\nLenovo began to emphasize vertical integration after a meeting in 2009 in which CEO Yang Yuanqing, and the head of Lenovo's supply chain, analyzed the costs versus the benefits of in-house manufacturing, and decided to make at least 50% of Lenovo's manufacturing in-house. Lenovo Chief Technology Officer George He said that vertical integration is having an important role in product development. He stated, \"If you look at the industry trends, most innovations for\" PCs, smartphones, tablets and smart TVs are related to innovation of key components\u2014display, battery and storage. Differentiation of key parts is so important. So we started investing more ... and working very closely with key parts suppliers.\"[148] Previously, lack of integration due to numerous foreign acquisitions and an excessive number of \"key performance indicators\" (KPIs) was making Lenovo's expansion expensive and creating unacceptably slow delivery times to end-customers. Lenovo responded by reducing the number of KPIs from 150 to 5, offering intensive training to managers, and working to create a global Lenovo culture. Lenovo also doubled-down on vertical integration and manufacturing near target markets in order to cut costs at time when its competitors were making increased use of outsourcing off-shoring. By 2013, Lenovo ranked 20th on Gartner's list of top 50 supply chains, whereas in 2010 the company was unranked.[149]\n\n\nIn 2012, Lenovo partially moved production of its ThinkPad line of computers to Japan. ThinkPads will be produced by NEC in Yamagata Prefecture. Akemi Watanabe (\u6e21\u8fba\u6731\u7f8e, *Watanabe Akemi*), president of Lenovo Japan, said, \"As a Japanese, I am glad to see the return to domestic production and the goal is to realize full-scale production as this will improve our image and make the products more acceptable to Japanese customers.\"[148][150]\n\n\nIn October 2012, Lenovo announced that it would start assembling computers in Whitsett, North Carolina. Production of desktop and laptop computers, including the ThinkPad Helix began in January 2013. As of July 2013[update], 115 workers were employed at this facility. Lenovo has been in Whitsett since 2008, where it also has centers for logistics, customer service, and return processing.[151][152]\n\n\nIn 2015, Lenovo and Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited, a government-sponsored business park for technology firms, reached a deal to \"jointly build a cloud service and product research and development center\".[153] Lenovo's Asia Pacific data center will also be housed in Cyperport.[153]\n\n\nLenovo assembles smartphones in Chennai, India through a contract manufacturing agreement with Flex.[154][155] In November 2015, Lenovo announced that it would start manufacturing computers in Pondicherry.[156]\n\n\n\n### Accusations of slave labor by supplier[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2020, *The Intercept* reported that Lenovo imported about 258,000 laptops from the Chinese manufacturer Hefei Bitland Information Technology, a company, among others, accused by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute of using Uyghur forced labor. In July 2020, the United States Commerce Department added 11 companies, including Hefei Bitland, implicated in human rights abuses on the Entity List. Lenovo took some shipments out of the distribution, but other shipments were distributed to consumers.[157][158][159]\n\n\nIn late July, Lenovo informed its customers it had stopped manufacturing with Bitland and was moving production of related devices to other suppliers.[160]\n\n\n\n### Response to 2022 sanctions against Russia[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lenovo reportedly suspended shipping to Russia on or before February 25, 2022, and, although it didn't confirm the suspension, faced a domestic backlash from Internet users in China.[161][162]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lenovo's registered office is in Taikoo Place, Hong Kong\nAlongside Beijing, the company has operational centres in Lorong Chuan, Singapore, and Morrisville, North Carolina[163][164] (near Raleigh in the Research Triangle metropolitan area)[165] in the United States.[166] As of October 2012, the Morrisville facility has about 2,000 employees.[167] Lenovo identifies its facilities in Beijing, Singapore, and Morrisville as its \"key location addresses\",[168] where its principal operations occur.[163] The company's registered office is on the 23rd floor of the Lincoln House building of the Taikoo Place in Quarry Bay, Hong Kong.[169]\n\n\nPreviously the company's U.S. headquarters were in Purchase, Harrison, New York. About 70 people worked there. In 2006, Lenovo announced that it was consolidating its U.S. headquarters, a logistics facility in Boulder, Colorado, and a call center in Atlanta, to a new facility in Morrisville. The company received offers of over $11 million in incentive funds from the local Morrisville, North Carolina, area and from the State of North Carolina on the condition that the company employs about 2,200 people.[170] \nIn early 2016, Lenovo carried out a comprehensive restructuring of its business units.[171]\n\n\n\n### Financials and market share[edit]\n\n\nIn the third quarter of 2020, Lenovo commands a leading market share of 25.7 per cent of all PCs sold in the world.[172]\n\n\nIn March 2013, Lenovo was included as a constituent stock in the Hang Seng Index. Lenovo replaced the unprofitable Aluminum Corporation of China Limited, a state-owned enterprise, on the list of 50 key companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange that constitute the Hang Seng Index.[173] The inclusion of Lenovo and Tencent, China's largest internet firm, significantly increased the weight of the technology sector on the index. Being added to the Hang Seng Index was a significant boon for Lenovo and its shareholders as it widened the pool of investors willing to purchase Lenovo's stock. For instance, index funds pegged to the Hang Seng and pension funds that consider index inclusion now have the opportunity to invest in Lenovo.[174] In November 2013 Lenovo reported that they had achieved double-digit market share in the United States for the first time.[175]\n\n\n\n### Ownership[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, China Oceanwide Holdings Group, a private Investment company based in Beijing, bought 29% of Legend Holdings, the parent company of Lenovo, for \u00a52.76 billion.[176] As of 31\u00a0March\u00a02018[update], 65% of Lenovo stock was held by the general public, 29% by Legend Holdings, 5.8% by Yang Yuanqing, and 0.2% by other directors.[177]\n\n\nResponding to claims that Lenovo is a state-owned enterprise, CEO Yang Yuanqing said, \"Our company is a 100% market oriented company. Some people have said we are a state-owned enterprise. It's 100% not true. In 1984 the Chinese Academy of Sciences only invested $25,000 in our company. The purpose of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to invest in this company was that they wanted to commercialize their research results. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is a pure research entity in China, owned by the government. From this point, you could say we're different from state-owned enterprises. Secondly, after this investment, this company is run totally by the founders and management team. The government has never been involved in our daily operation, in important decisions, strategic direction, nomination of the CEO and top executives and financial management. Everything is done by our management team.\"[178]\n\n\nAs of 2014, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, owns 11.7% of Lenovo and IBM owns 37.8%.[179]\n\n\nIn early 2006, the U.S. State Department was harshly criticized for purchasing 16,000 computers from Lenovo. Critics argued that Lenovo was controlled by the Chinese government and a potential vehicle for espionage against the United States. Yang spoke out forcefully and publicly to defend Lenovo. He said, \"We are not a government-controlled company.\" He pointed out that Lenovo pioneered China's transition to a market economy and that in the early 1990s had fought and beaten four state-owned enterprises that dominated the Chinese computer market. Those firms had the full backing of the state while Lenovo received no special treatment.[180] The State Department deal went through. Yang worried that fears about Lenovo's supposed connections to the Chinese government would be an ongoing issue in the United States. Yang worked to ease worries by communicating directly with Congress.\n\n\nYang dramatically increased his ownership stake by acquiring 797 million shares in 2011. As of June 2011, Yang owned an 8 per cent stake in Lenovo. He previously owned only 70 million shares. In a statement, Yang said, \"While the transaction is a personal financial matter, I want to be very clear that my decision to make this investment is based on my strong belief in the company's very bright future. Our culture is built on commitment and ownership\u00a0\u2013 we do what we say, and we own what we do. My decision to increase my holdings represents my steadfast belief in these principles.\"[181]\n\n\n\n### Corporate culture[edit]\n\n\nLenovo's senior executives rotate between the three head offices at Beijing, Singapore, and Morrisville, as well as Lenovo's research and development centre in Yamato, Japan.[79]\n\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\n#### Yang Yuanqing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yang Yuanqing\n\n![](image)Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo's Chairman and CEO\nYang Yuanqing is the chairman and chief executive officer of Lenovo. One of his major achievements was leading Lenovo to become the best-selling personal computer brand in China since 1997. In 2001, *Bloomberg Businessweek* named him one of Asia's rising stars in business.[182] Yang was president and CEO of Lenovo until 2004, when Lenovo closed its acquisition of IBM's PC division, after which Yang was succeeded as Lenovo CEO by IBM's Stephen M. Ward Jr. Ward was succeeded by William Amelio on 20 December 2005. In February 2009, Yang replaced Amelio as CEO and has served in that capacity ever since. Yang was chairman of Lenovo's board from 2004 to 2008, and returned as chairman in 2012 alongside his role as CEO.\n\n\nIn 2012, Yang received a $3 million bonus as a reward for record profits, which he in turn redistributed to about 10,000 of Lenovo's employees. According to Lenovo spokesman, Jeffrey Shafer, Yang felt that it would be the right thing to, \"redirect [the money] to the employees as a real tangible gesture for what they done.\" Shafer also said that Yang, who owns about eight per cent of Lenovo's stock, \"felt that he was rewarded well simply as the owner of the company\".[183] The bonuses were mostly distributed among staff working in positions such as production and reception who received an average of CN\u00a52,000 or about US$314. This was almost equivalent to a monthly salary of an average worker in China.[184] Yang made a similar gift of US$3.25 million again in 2013.[185]\n\n\nAccording to Lenovo's annual report, Yang earned US$14 million, including US$5.2 million in bonuses, during the fiscal year that ended in March 2012.[186]\n\n\nIn 2013, *Barron's* named Yang one of the \"World's Best CEOs\".[187]\n\n\n\n#### Liu Chuanzhi[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Liu Chuanzhi\n\nLiu Chuanzhi is the founder and former chairman of Lenovo. Liu was trained as an engineer at a military college and later went on to work at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Like many young people during the Cultural Revolution, Liu was denounced and sent to the countryside where he worked as a laborer on a rice farm. Liu claims Hewlett-Packard as a key source of inspiration. In an interview with *The Economist* he stated that \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, Lenovo was Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.[188] In reference to Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.\"[14]\n\n\n\n#### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nIn early 2013, Lenovo announced the addition of Yahoo! founder Jerry Yang to its board.[189] Lenovo's CEO Yang Yuanqing said, \"Jerry's appointment as an observer to our board furthers Lenovo's reputation as a transparent international company.\" Just prior to the appointment of Jerry Yang, Tudor Brown, the founder of British semiconductor design firm ARM, was also appointed to Lenovo's board. Speaking of both men Yang Yuanqing said, \"We believe that they will add a great deal to our strategic thinking, long-term direction and, ultimately, our ability to achieve our aspirations in the PC plus era.\"\n\n\n\n## Marketing and sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Lenovo became the first personal computer manufacturer to divide countries into emerging markets and mature markets. Lenovo then developed a different set of strategies for each category. Lenovo's competitors have widely adopted the same approach[20] In 2012, Lenovo made a major effort to expand its market share in developing economies such as Brazil and India through acquisitions and increased budgets for marketing and advertising.[79]\n\n\n\n### Celebrity sponsorships and endorsements[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2013, Lenovo announced that it had hired American actor Ashton Kutcher as a product engineer and spokesman. David Roman, Lenovo's chief marketing officer, said, \"His partnership goes beyond traditional bounds by deeply integrating him into our organization as a product engineer. Ashton will help us break new ground by challenging assumptions, bringing a new perspective and contributing his technical expertise to Yoga Tablet and other devices.\"[190] Kobe Bryant became an official ambassador for Lenovo smartphones in China and Southeast Asia in early 2013.[191] Bryant appeared in a social campaign titled \"The Everyday Kobe Challenge\" for the launch of Lenovo IdeaPhone K900 in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines in the same year.[192][193]\n\n\n\n### Sporting sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 2008 Summer Olympics Torch was designed by Lenovo\nLenovo was an official computer sponsor of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. When asked about Lenovo's brand Yang Yuanqing said, \"The Beijing Olympics were very good for brand awareness in countries like the US and Argentina, but not good enough.\"[194] The NFL has been a Lenovo customer since 2007. In July 2012, Lenovo and the National Football League (NFL) announced that Lenovo had become the NFL's \"Official Laptop, Desktop and Workstation Sponsor.\" Lenovo said that this was its largest sponsorship deal ever in the United States. NFL stars Jerry Rice, DeAngelo Williams, and Torry Holt were on hand for the announcement and a celebration with 1,500 Lenovo employees. Lenovo's sponsorship will last at least three years.[195]\n\n\nLenovo also become technology partner for Ducati Corse in Grand Prix motorcycle racing since 2018. And for the 2021 MotoGP it will become main sponsor for the Bolognese.[196]\n\n\nLenovo is also an official partner of the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes who play in nearby Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\n\nLenovo and FC Internazionale, in 2019, have signed a multi-year sponsorship agreement that makes Lenovo the Global Technology Partner of the Nerazzurri company.[197] In May 2021, Lenovo and Motorola Mobility decided to celebrate with a limited edition of Motorola Razr totally customized and produced in 2021 numbered pieces, to honor Inter who won their 19th Scudetto.[198] In July 2021 there was the launch of the new Inter Home shirt for the 2021\u201322 season, they unveiled the introduction of Lenovo as a sponsor on the back of the shirt.[199]\n\n\n\n### Television, internet, and other media[edit]\n\n\nLenovo used a short-film entitled *The Pursuit* in its \"For Those Who Do\" campaign launched in 2011. The film depicted a mysterious young woman using the IdeaPad Yoga 13 to stay one-step-ahead of her evil pursuers. Martin Campbell, who previously worked on action movies and James Bond films such as GoldenEye and the remake of Casino Royale, shot this film. Lenovo was the first Chinese company to make use of such marketing techniques.[149]\n\n\nIn May 2015, Lenovo hosted its first ever \"Tech World\" conference in Beijing.[200] ZUK Mobile, a separate company formed by Lenovo in 2014, announced several products at Tech World, These included slim power banks, 3D printers that can print food such as chocolate, an outdoor sound box, and a Wi-Fi based control system for home automation.[200]\n\n\n\n### China[edit]\n\n\nIn its home market China, Lenovo has a vast distribution network designed to make sure that there is at least one shop selling Lenovo computers within 50 kilometers of nearly all consumers. Lenovo has also developed close relationships with its Chinese distributors, who are granted exclusive territories and only carry Lenovo products.[79]\n\n\nAs of July 2013, Lenovo believes that urbanization initiatives being pushed by Premier Li Keqiang will allow it to sustain sales growth in China for the foreseeable future. Speaking at Lenovo's annual general meeting in Hong Kong in 2013, Yang Yuanqing said: \"I believe urbanisation will help us further increase the overall [domestic] PC market.\" Yang also stressed the opportunity presented by the China's relatively low penetration rate of personal computers. Lenovo previously benefited from the Chinese government's rural subsidies, part of a wider economic stimulus initiative, designed to increase purchases of appliances and electronics. That program, which Lenovo joined in 2004, ended in 2011. Lenovo enjoys consistent price premiums over its traditional competitors in rural markets and a stronger local sales and service presence.[201]\n\n\n\n### India[edit]\n\n\nLenovo has gained significant market share in India through bulk orders to large companies and government agencies. For example, the government of Tamil Nadu ordered a million ThinkPads from IBM/Lenovo in 2012 and single-handedly made the firm a market leader. Lenovo distributes most of the personal computers it sells in India through five national distributors such as Ingram Micro and Redington.[202]\n\n\nGiven that most smartphones and tablets are sold to individuals Lenovo is pursuing a different strategy making use of many small state-centric distributors. Amar Babu, Lenovo's managing director for India, said, \"To reach out to small towns and the hinterland, we have tied up with 40 regional distributors. We want our distributors to be exclusive to us. We will, in turn, ensure they have exclusive rights to distribute Lenovo products in their catchment area.\"[202] As of 2013, Lenovo had about 6,000 retailers selling smartphones and tablets in India. In February 2013, Lenovo established a relationship with Reliance Communications to sell smartphones. The smartphones carried by Reliance have dual-SIM capability and support both GSM and CDMA. Babu claims that the relative under penetration of smartphones in India represents an opportunity for Lenovo.[202]\n\n\nLenovo has assembled a team of senior managers familiar with the Indian market, launched mobile phones at all price points there, and worked on branding to build market share. As of February 2014, Lenovo claims that its sales of smartphones in India have been increasing 100% per quarter while the market is only growing 15\u201320% over the same period. Lenovo did marketing tests of its smartphones in November 2012 in Gujarat and some southern cities, where Lenovo already had a strong presence. Lenovo's strategy has been to create awareness, maintain a broad selection of phones at all price points, and develop distribution networks. Lenovo partnered with two national distributors and over 100 local distributors. As of February 2014, more than 7,000 retail outlets in India sold Lenovo smartphones. Lenovo has also partnered with HCL in order to set up 250 service centres in 110 cities.[203]\n\n\nIn India, Lenovo grants distributors exclusive territories but allows them to sell computers from other companies. Lenovo uses its close relationships with distributors to gain market intelligence and speed up product development.\n\n\nLenovo reported a year-on-year increase of about 951% in tablet sales in India for the first quarter of 2014. Canalys, a market research firm, said Lenovo took market share away from Apple and Samsung in the country.[204]\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\nLenovo first started doing business in South Africa, establishing a sales office, and then expanded to East African markets such as Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Rwanda. West Africa followed when Lenovo set-up a Nigerian legal office and then expanded to Ghana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Botswana.\n\n\nAccording to Lenovo's general manager for Africa, Graham Braum, Lenovo's strategy is to put \"great emphasis on products that sell well in Africa\" and roll out \"products alongside different African governments' rolling out of wireless technology\". Products such as the Lenovo Yoga series are popular in Africa because of their long battery life, as many areas have unreliable electrical supply. Other popular products include the Lenovo netbooks, which were introduced in 2008.[205]\n\n\nLenovo picked Nigeria in 2013 to release its smartphone because unlike South Africa and other African countries, there is no requirement to partner with a local telecom firm to sell its phones.[206]\n\n\nIn the long term, according to Braum, \"Lenovo in Africa will focus on continuing to consistently supply personal computer products and allow this market to grow, while moving into new territory such as mobile and enterprise.\"[205]\n\n\n\n### Singapore[edit]\n\n\nLenovo has had a presence in Singapore as early as its foundation, and with a focus on the Southeast Asia region, it is the location of one of Lenovo's three head offices.[207] Registered as Lenovo[208] (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., it is located at the New Tech Park in the Lorong Chuan district of the North-East Region of Singapore.[207][209]\n\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, Lenovo began the \"For Those Who Do\" marketing campaign in 2010, created by the ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi. It was part of Lenovo's first-ever global branding campaign, beyond its domestic market in China.[210] \"For Those Who Do\" was designed to appeal to young consumers in the 18- to 25-year-old demographic by stressing its utility to creative individuals that Lenovo's advertising refers to as \"doers\".[211] One of Lenovo's operational centers is located in North Carolina, United States. Lenovo also started manufacturing products in the United States in 2012.[212]\n\n\n\n### Goodweird[edit]\n\n\nLenovo launched a multi-year advertising campaign called \"Goodweird\" in the last half of 2015. Goodweird is designed to convey the idea that designs that seem strange initially often become familiar and widely accepted. The Goodweird campaign includes a video with famous images of early attempts to fly with the aid of homemade wings and a bicycle that transitions to a modern-day shot of a man soaring across mountains in a wingsuit before transitioning again to a shot of the Stealth Bomber. Lenovo worked with three agencies on Goodweird: London-based DLKW Low, We Are Social, and Blast Radius. Goodweird is part of Lenovo's wider strategy to appeal to millennials with an emphasis on design trendsetters. A portion of the funding for Goodweird is being directed to prominent YouTubers and Viners. BuzzFeed has been engaged to create relevant content.[213]\n\n\n\n## Security and privacy incidents[edit]\n\n\n### Superfish[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2015, Lenovo became the subject of controversy for having bundled software identified as malware on some of its laptops. The software, Superfish Visual Discovery, is a web browser add-on that injects Pricing advertising into search engine results pages. To intercept HTTPS-encrypted communications, the software also installed a self-signed public key certificate.[214][215] When the Superfish public-key cryptography was compromised, it was also discovered that the same private key was used across all installations of the software, leaving users vulnerable to security exploits utilizing the key.[216][217] Lenovo made between US$200,000 to 250,000 on its deal with Superfish.[218] In 2017 Lenovo agreed to pay US$3.5 million as part of a settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission.[219] and announced an apology to its customers and stock holders.\n\n\nThe head of Superfish responded to security concerns by saying the vulnerability was \"inadvertently\" introduced by Komodia, which built the application.[220] In response to the criticism, Lenovo detailed that it would cease further distribution and use of the Superfish software, and offered affected customers free six-month subscriptions to the McAfee LiveSafe software.[221] Lenovo issued a promise to reduce the amount of \"Software bloat\" it bundles with its Windows 10 devices, promising to only include Lenovo software, security software, drivers, and \"certain applications customarily expected by users\".[222] *Salon* tech writer David Auerbach compared the Superfish incident to the Sony DRM rootkit scandal, and argued that \"installing Superfish is one of the most irresponsible mistakes an established tech company has ever made.\"[223]\n\n\n\n### Lenovo Service Engine[edit]\n\n\nFrom October 2014 through June 2015, the UEFI firmware on certain Lenovo models had contained software known as \"Lenovo Service Engine\", which Lenovo says automatically sent non-identifiable system information to Lenovo the first time Windows is connected to the internet, and on laptops, automatically installs the Lenovo OneKey Optimizer program (software considered to be Software bloat) as well. This process occurs even on clean installations of Windows. It was found that this program had been automatically installed using a new feature in Windows 8, Windows Platform Binary Table, which allows executable files to be stored within UEFI firmware for execution on startup, and is meant to \"allow critical software to persist even when the operating system has changed or been reinstalled in a \"clean\" configuration\"; specifically, anti-theft security software. The software was discontinued after it was found that aspects of the software had security vulnerabilities, and did not comply with revised guidelines for appropriate usage of WPBT. On 31 July 2015, Lenovo released instructions and UEFI firmware updates meant to remove Lenovo Service Engine.[224][225][226]\n\n\n\n### Lenovo Customer Feedback program[edit]\n\n\nAt a third time in 2015, criticism arose that Lenovo might have installed software that looked suspicious on their commercial Think-PC lines. This was discovered by Computerworld writer Michael Horowitz, who had purchased several Think systems with the Customer Feedback program installed, which seemed to log usage data and metrics.[227] Further analysis by Horowitz revealed however that this was mostly harmless, as it was only logging the usage of some pre-installed Lenovo programs, and not the usage in general, and only if the user allowed the data to be collected. Horowitz also criticized other media for quoting his original article and saying that Lenovo preinstalled spyware, as he himself never used that term in this case and he also said that he does not consider the software he found to be spyware.[228]\n\n\n\n### Lenovo Accelerator[edit]\n\n\nAs of June 2016, a Duo Labs report stated that Lenovo was still installing bloatware, some of which leads to security vulnerabilities as soon as the user turns on their new PC.[229][230] Lenovo advised users to remove the offending app, \"Lenovo Accelerator\".[231] According to Lenovo, the app, designed to \"speed up the loading\" of Lenovo applications, created a man-in-the-middle security vulnerability.\n\n\n\n### U.S. Marine network security breach[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2021, *Bloomberg Business* reported that U.S. investigators found in 2008 that military units in Iraq were using Lenovo laptops in which the hardware had been altered. According to a testimony from the case in 2010, \"A large amount of Lenovo laptops were sold to the U.S. military that had a chip encrypted on the motherboard that would record all the data that was being inputted into that laptop and send it back to China\". Lenovo was unaware of the testimony. The U.S. military did not inform the company of any security concerns. Spokeswoman Charlotte West stated, \"As there have been no reports of any problems, we have no way to assess the allegations you cite or whether security concerns may have been triggered by third-party interference.\"[232]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![icon](image)Electronics portal\n* ![icon](image)Technology portal\n\n\n* List of computer system manufacturers\n* List of companies of China\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Locations | Lenovo US\". *www.lenovo.com*.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Lenovo\". *Forbes*.

Over the years, its focus on the Southeast Asia region has led to the establishment of one of Lenovo's three head offices in Singapore. Previously known as Lenovo (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., the company operated from the New Tech Park in the Lorong Chuan district, situated in the North-East Region of Singapore.\n\nHowever, in the present, Lenovo continues to thrive and evolve in Singapore. The company remains committed to the Southeast Asia market and has expanded its operations and engagement in the region. The office, still registered as Lenovo (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., remains strategically located at the New Tech Park in the Lorong Chuan district. This location provides numerous advantages, such as access to key markets and a flourishing business environment in Singapore, which supports Lenovo's growth and success in the region.\n\nThroughout the years, Lenovo's presence in Singapore has transitioned from its early establishment to a dynamic and forward-looking operation.

HP developed and provided a wide variety of hardware components, as well as software and related services to consumers, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health, and education sectors. The company was founded in a one-car garage in Palo Alto by Bill Hewlett and David Packard in 1939, and initially produced a line of electronic test and measurement equipment. The HP Garage at 367 Addison Avenue is now designated an official California Historical Landmark, and is marked with a plaque calling it the \"Birthplace of 'Silicon Valley'\".\n\n\nThe company won its first big contract in 1938 to provide the HP 200A, a low distortion frequency oscillator[1] for Walt Disney's production of the animated film *Fantasia*, which allowed Hewlett and Packard to formally establish the Hewlett-Packard Company on July 2, 1939.[2] The company grew into a multinational corporation widely respected for its products. HP was the world's leading PC manufacturer from 2007 until the second quarter of 2013, when Lenovo moved ahead of HP.[3][4][5] HP specialized in developing and manufacturing computing, data storage, and networking hardware; designing software; and delivering services. Major product lines included personal computing devices, enterprise and industry standard servers, related storage devices, networking products, software, and a range of printers and other imaging products. The company directly marketed its products to households; small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises, as well as via online distribution; consumer-electronics and office-supply retailers; software partners; and major technology vendors. It also offered services and a consulting business for its products and partner products.\n\n\nIn 1999, HP spun off its electronic and bio-analytical test and measurement instruments business into Agilent Technologies; HP retained focus on its later products, including computers and printers. It merged with Compaq in 2002, and acquired Electronic Data Systems in 2008, which led to combined revenues of $118.4\u00a0billion that year and a Fortune 500 ranking of 9 in 2009. In November 2009, HP announced its acquisition of 3Com,[6] and closed the deal on April 12, 2010.[7] On April 28, 2010, HP announced its buyout of Palm, Inc. for $1.2\u00a0billion.[8] On September 2, 2010, HP won its bidding war for 3PAR with a $33 a share offer ($2.07\u00a0billion), which Dell declined to match.[9]\n\n\nOn November 1, 2015, Hewlett-Packard was split into two separate companies; its enterprise products and services business were spun-off to form Hewlett Packard Enterprise, while its personal computer and printer businesses became HP Inc.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The garage in Palo Alto, where Hewlett and Packard began the company\n\n![Logo used from 1941 to 1964](image)Logo used from 1941 to 1964\n\nBill Hewlett and David Packard graduated with degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1935. The company started in a garage in Palo Alto during a fellowship they had with past professor Frederick Terman at Stanford during the Great Depression, whom they considered a mentor in forming the company.[11] In 1938, Packard and Hewlett began part-time work in a rented garage with an initial capital investment of US$538 (equivalent to $11,645 in 2023). In 1939, Hewlett and Packard decided to formalize their partnership. They tossed a coin to decide whether the company they founded would be called Hewlett-Packard (HP) or Packard-Hewlett.[12]\n\n\nHewlett and Packard's first financially successful product was a precision audio oscillator known as the HP 200A, which used a small incandescent light bulb (known as a \"pilot light\") as a temperature dependent resistor in a critical portion of the circuit, and a negative feedback loop to stabilize the amplitude of the output sinusoidal waveform. This allowed the HP 200A to be sold for $89.40 when competitors were selling less stable oscillators for over $200. The 200 series of generators continued production until at least 1972 as the 200AB, still tube-based but improved in design through the years.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOne of the company's earliest customers was Bud Hawkins, chief sound engineer for Walt Disney Studios, who bought eight HP 200B audio oscillators (at $71.50 each) to be used in the animated film *Fantasia*. HP's profit at the end of 1939, its first full year of business, was $1,563 (equivalent to $34,236 in 2023) on revenues of $5,369.[13]\n\n\nIn 1942, they built their first building at 395 Page Mill Road and were awarded the Army-Navy \"E\" Award in 1943. HP employed 200 people and produced the audio oscillator, a wave analyzer, distortion analyzers, an audio-signal generator, and the Model 400A vacuum-tube voltmeter during the war.[13]:\u200a54\u201360,\u200a195\n\n\nHewlett and Packard worked on counter-radar technology and artillery shell proximity fuzes during World War II; the work exempted Packard from the draft,[14] but Hewlett had to serve as an officer in the Army Signal Corps after being called to active duty.\n\n\nHP was incorporated on August 18, 1947, with Packard as president. Sales reached $5.5 million in 1951 with 215 employees. The company went public on November 6, 1957.[13]:\u200a35,\u200a40,\u200a64,\u200a70,\u200a196 In 1959, a manufacturing plant was established in B\u00f6blingen and a marketing organization in Geneva.[13]:\u200a196 Packard handed the presidency over to Hewlett when he became chairman in 1964, but remained CEO of the company.\n\n\n\n### 1960s[edit]\n\n\n\n![Logo used from 1964[15] to 1979](image)Logo used from 1964[15] to 1979\n\n![](image)The HP200A, a precision audio oscillator, was the company's very first financially successful product.\nHP is recognized as the symbolic founder of Silicon Valley, though it did not actively investigate semiconductor devices until a few years after the \"traitorous eight\" abandoned William Shockley to create Fairchild Semiconductor in 1957. Hewlett-Packard's HP Associates division, established around 1960, developed semiconductor devices primarily for internal use. HP Associates was co-founded by another former Bell Labs researcher, MOSFET inventor Mohamed Atalla,[16] who served as Director of Semiconductor Research.[17] Instruments and calculators were some of the products using semiconductor devices from HP Associates.\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, HP partnered with Sony and Yokogawa Electric in Japan to develop several high-quality products. The products were not a huge success, as there were high costs involved in building HP-looking products in Japan. In 1963, HP and Yokogawa formed the joint venture Yokogawa-Hewlett-Packard to market HP products in Japan.[18] HP bought Yokogawa Electric's share of Hewlett-Packard Japan in 1999.[19]\n\n\nHP spun off the small company Dynac to specialize in digital equipment. The name was picked so that the HP logo could be turned upside down to be a reflected image of the logo of the new company. Dynac was eventually renamed Dymec and folded back into HP in 1959.[20] HP experimented with using Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) minicomputers with its instruments, but entered the computer market in 1966 with the HP 2100 / HP 1000 series of minicomputers after it decided that it would be easier to build another small design team than deal with DEC. The minicomputers had a simple accumulator-based design with two accumulator registers and, in the HP 1000 models, two index registers. The series was produced for 20 years in spite of several attempts to replace it, and was a forerunner of the HP 9800 and HP 250 series of desktop and business computers.\n\n\nAt the end of 1968, Packard handed over the duties of CEO to Hewlett to become United States Deputy Secretary of Defense in the incoming Nixon administration. He resumed the chairmanship in 1972 and served until 1993, but Hewlett remained the CEO.\n\n\n\n### 1970s[edit]\n\n\nThe HP 3000 was an advanced stack-based design for a business computing server, later redesigned with RISC technology. The HP 2640 series of smart and intelligent terminals introduced forms-based interfaces to ASCII terminals, and also introduced screen labeled function keys, now commonly used on gas pumps and bank ATMs. The HP 2640 series included one of the first bit mapped graphics displays that, when combined with the HP 2100 21MX F-Series microcoded Scientific Instruction Set,[21] enabled the first commercial WYSIWYG presentation program, BRUNO, that later became the program HP-Draw on the HP 3000. Although scoffed at in the formative days of computing, HP surpassed IBM as the world's largest technology vendor in terms of sales.[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)Introduced in 1968, \"The new Hewlett-Packard 9100A personal computer is ready, willing, and able\u00a0... to relieve you of waiting to get on the big computer.\"\nHP was identified by *Wired* magazine as the producer of the world's first device to be called a personal computer: the Hewlett-Packard 9100A, introduced in 1968.[23] HP called it a desktop calculator because, as Hewlett said: \"If we had called it a computer, it would have been rejected by our customers' computer gurus because it didn't look like an IBM. We therefore decided to call it a calculator, and all such nonsense disappeared.\" An engineering triumph at the time, the logic circuit was produced without any integrated circuits, and the CPU assembly was entirely executed in discrete components. With CRT display, magnetic-card storage, and printer, the price was around $5,000. The machine's keyboard was a cross between the keyboard of a scientific calculator and the keyboard of an adding machine. There was no alphabetic keyboard.\n\n\nApple co-founder Steve Wozniak originally designed the Apple I computer while working at HP and offered it to them under their right of first refusal to his work; they did not take it up as the company wanted to stay in scientific, business, and industrial markets. Wozniak said that HP \"turned him down five times\", but that his loyalty to HP made him hesitant to start Apple with Steve Jobs.[24]\n\n\nThe company earned global respect for a variety of products. They introduced the world's first handheld scientific electronic calculator in 1972 (the HP-35), the first handheld programmable in 1974 (the HP-65), the first alphanumeric, programmable, expandable in 1979 (the HP-41C), and the first symbolic and graphing calculator, the HP-28C. \n\n\nLike their scientific and business calculators, HP oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and other measurement instruments had a reputation for sturdiness and usability. HP introduced the Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus (HPIB) computer peripheral interface (later cloned by National Instruments as GPIB and standardized by the IEEE as IEEE-488) on their relay actuator products in 1973; HPIB was later integrated into most high end test & measurement equipment it produced from 1980 onward. As early as 1977 HP began production of the HP856x spectrum analyzers to complement its RF power meters and sensors capable of measuring signals in excess of 20 GHz. HP also produced configurable chassis based sweep generators capable of generating signals to 20GHz. Other T&M products of the time included lab grade multimeters, microwave frequency counters, RF amplifiers, high accuracy microwave detectors, lab grade power supplies and more. These products were succeeded by modernized versions as well as the introduction of the scalar and vector network analyzer product lines prior to the business being spun off into Agilent Technologies.\n\n\nThe HP 9800 series of technical desktop computers started in 1971 with the 9810A. The HP series 80 started in 1979 with the 85.[25] Some of these machines used a version of the BASIC programming language, which was available immediately after they were switched on, and used a proprietary magnetic tape for storage. HP computers were similar in capabilities to the much later IBM Personal Computer, though the limitations of available technology forced prices to be high.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1978, Hewlett stepped down as CEO and was succeeded by John A. Young.\n\n\n\n### 1980s[edit]\n\n\n\n![Logo used from 1979 to 2008](image)Logo used from 1979 to 2008\n\nHP expanded into South Africa in the 1980s. Activists supporting divestment from South Africa accused HP of \"automating apartheid\".[26]\n\n\nSales reached $6.5 billion in 1985 with 85,000 employees.[13]:\u200a198\n\n\nIn 1984, HP introduced both inkjet and laser printers for the desktop. Along with its scanner product line, the printers have later been developed into successful multifunction products, the most significant being single-unit printer/scanner/copier/fax machines. The print mechanisms in HP's LaserJet line of laser printers depend almost entirely on Canon Inc.'s components (print engines), which in turn use technology developed by Xerox. HP developed the hardware, firmware, and software to convert data into dots for printing.[27]\n\n\nOn March 3, 1986, HP registered the HP.com domain name, making it the ninth Internet .com domain to be registered.[28]\n\n\nIn 1987, the Palo Alto garage where Hewlett and Packard started their business was designated as a California Historical Landmark.\n\n\n\n### 1990s[edit]\n\n\n\n![Logo with \"Invent\" tagline introduced in 1999[29]](image)Logo with \"Invent\" tagline introduced in 1999[29]\n\nIn the 1990s, HP expanded their computer product line, which initially had been targeted at university, research, and business users, to reach consumers. HP also grew through acquisitions: it bought Apollo Computer in 1989 and Convex Computer in 1995.\n\n\nIn 1992, Young was succeeded by Lewis E. Platt, and in 1993 and Hewlett and Packard stepped down from the board with Platt succeeding Packard as chairman.\n\n\nIn 1993, HP acquired Advanced Design System from Pathwave. The ADS suite of RF simulation tools was spun off into Agilent in 1999 along with related T&M business units, all of which were carried forward into the spinoff of Agilent into Keysight.\n\n\nLater in the decade, HP opened hpshopping.com as an independent subsidiary to sell online, direct to consumers; in 2005, the store was renamed \"HP Home & Home Office Store\".\n\n\nFrom 1995 to 1998, Hewlett-Packard were sponsors of the English football team Tottenham Hotspur.\n\n\nIn 1999, all of the businesses not related to computers, storage, and imaging were spun off from HP to form Agilent Technologies. Agilent's spin-off was the largest initial public offering in the history of Silicon Valley,[30] and it created an $8 billion company with about 30,000 employees, manufacturing scientific instruments, semiconductors, optical networking devices, and electronic test equipment for telecom and wireless, research and development, and production.\n\n\nIn July 1999, HP appointed Carly Fiorina as the first female CEO of a Fortune-20 company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[31] Fiorina received a larger signing offer than any of her predecessors.[32] The same year, Fiorina articulated a set of \"rules of the garage\", an attempt to capture the spirit of the company's founders.[33]\n\n\n\n#### Sales to Iran despite sanctions[edit]\n\n\nIn 1997, HP started selling its products in Iran through a European subsidiary and a Dubai-based Middle Eastern distributor, despite U.S. export sanctions prohibiting such deals imposed by Bill Clinton's 1995 executive orders.[34][35][36] The story was initially reported by *The Boston Globe*,[37] and it triggered an inquiry by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). HP responded that products worth US$120 million were sold in fiscal year 2008[38] for distribution via Redington Gulf, a company based in the Netherlands, and that as these sales took place through a foreign subsidiary, HP had not violated sanctions.[34]\n\n\nHP named Redington Gulf \"Wholesaler of the Year\" in 2003, which in turn published a press release stating that \"[t]he seeds of the Redington-Hewlett-Packard relationship were sowed six years ago for one market\u00a0\u2014 Iran.\"[34] At the time, Redington Gulf had only three employees whose sole purpose was to sell HP products to the Iran market.[37] According to former officials who worked on sanctions, HP used a loophole by routing their sales through a foreign subsidiary.[34] HP ended its relationship with Redington Gulf after the SEC inquiry.[34]\n\n\n\n### 2000\u20132005[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hewlett-Packard Deskjet 3845 printer\nOn September 3, 2001, HP announced that an agreement had been reached with Compaq to merge the two companies.[39] In May 2002, after passing a shareholder vote, HP officially merged with Compaq. Prior to this, plans had been in place to consolidate the companies' product teams and product lines.[40]\n\n\nAs Compaq took over Tandem Computers in 1997 and Digital Equipment Corporation in 1998, HP offers support for the former Tandem NonStop family and Digital Equipment products PDP-11, VAX and AlphaServer.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nThe merger occurred after a proxy fight with Bill Hewlett's son Walter, who objected to the merger. HP became a major producer in desktop computers, laptops, and servers for many different markets. After the merger with Compaq, the new ticker symbol became \"HPQ\", a combination of the two previous symbols, \"HWP\" and \"CPQ\", to show the significance of the alliance and also key letters from the two companies **H**ewlett-**P**ackard and Compa**q** (the latter company being famous for its \"Q\" logo on all of its products).\n\n\nMscape was a mobile media gaming platform that could be used to create location-based games originating in 2002.\n\n\nIn 2004, HP released the DV 1000 Series, including the HP Pavilion dv 1658 and 1040. In May 2006, HP began its campaign, \"The Computer is Personal Again\"; the campaign was designed to bring back the personal computer as a personal product. The campaign utilized viral marketing, sophisticated visuals, and its own website. Some of the ads featured Pharrell,[41] Petra Nemcova, Mark Burnett, Mark Cuban, Alicia Keys,[42] Jay-Z,[43] Gwen Stefani, and Shaun White.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn January 2005, following years of underperformance, which included HP's Compaq merger that fell short[44] and disappointing earning reports,[45] the board asked Fiorina to resign as chair and chief executive officer of the company, and she did on February 9, 2005.[46] After her departure, HP's stock jumped 6.9 percent.[47] Robert Wayman, chief financial officer of HP, served as interim CEO while the board undertook a formal search for a replacement.[48]\n\n\nMark Hurd of NCR Corporation was hired to take over as CEO and president, effective April 1, 2005. Hurd was the board's top choice given the revival of NCR that took place under his leadership.[44]\n\n\n\n### 2006\u20132009[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A sign marking the entrance to the HP corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 2006\n![](image)iPAQ 112 Pocket PC from 2008\nIn 2006, HP unveiled several new products including desktops, enhanced notebooks, a workstation, and software to manage them\u2014OpenView Client Configuration Manager 2.0.[49] In the same year, HP's share price skyrocketed due to consistent results in the last couple quarters of the year with Hurd's plan to cut back HP's workforce and lower costs.[50]\n\n\nIn July 2007, HP signed a definitive agreement to acquire Opsware in a cash tender deal that values the company at $14.25 per share, which combined Opsware software with the Oracle enterprise IT management software.[51]\n\n\nIn the first few years of Hurd's tenure as CEO, HP's stock price more than doubled. By the end of the 2007 fiscal year, HP reached the $100 billion mark for the first time. The company's annual revenue reached $104 billion, allowing HP to overtake competitor IBM.[52]\n\n\nOn May 13, 2008, HP and Electronic Data Systems (EDS) announced[53] that they had signed a definitive agreement under which HP would purchase EDS. On June 30, HP announced[54] that the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 had expired. \"The transaction still requires EDS stockholder approval and regulatory clearance from the European Commission and other non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the other closing conditions specified in the merger agreement.\" The agreement was finalized on August 26, 2008, at $13 billion, and it was publicly announced that EDS would be re-branded. The first targeted layoff of 24,600 former EDS workers was announced on September 15, 2008.[55] (The company's 2008 annual report gave the number as 24,700, to be completed by end of 2009.[56]) This round was factored into purchase price as a $19.5 billion liability against goodwill. As of September 23, 2009, EDS was known as HP Enterprise Services (now known as DXC Technology).\n\n\nOn November 11, 2009, 3Com and Hewlett-Packard announced that the latter would be acquiring 3Com for $2.7 billion in cash.[57] The acquisition was one of the biggest in size among a series of takeovers and acquisitions by technology giants to push their way to become one-stop shops. Since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007, tech giants have constantly felt the pressure to expand beyond their current market niches. Dell purchased Perot Systems recently to invade into the technology consulting business area previously dominated by IBM. Hewlett-Packard's latest move marked its incursion into enterprise networking gear market dominated by Cisco.\n\n\n\n### 2010\u20132012[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Hewlett-Packard Mini 1000 netbook computer, a type of notebook computer\nOn April 28, 2010, Palm, Inc. and HP announced that the latter would buy the former for $1.2 billion in cash and debt.[58] Adding Palm handsets to the HP product line created some overlap with the iPAQ series of mobile devices, but was thought to significantly improve HP's mobile presence as iPAQ devices had not been selling well. Buying Palm, Inc. gave HP a library of valuable patents and the mobile operating platform, webOS. On July 1, 2010, the acquisition of Palm, Inc. was finalized.[59] Purchasing its webOS was a big gamble to build HP's own ecosystem.[60] On July 1, 2011, HP launched its first tablet, HP TouchPad, which brought webOS to tablet devices. On September 2, 2010, HP won the bidding war for 3PAR with a $33 a share offer ($2.07 billion) that Dell declined to match. After HP acquired Palm Inc., it phased out the Compaq brand.\n\n\nOn August 6, 2010, Hurd resigned amid controversy and CFO Cathie Lesjak assumed the role of interim CEO. Hurd had turned HP around and was widely regarded as one of Silicon Valley's star CEOs, and under his leadership, HP became the largest computer company in the world when measured by total revenue.[61] He was accused of sexual harassment against a colleague, though the allegations were deemed baseless. The investigation led to questions concerning some of his private expenses and the lack of disclosure related to the friendship.[62][63] Some observers have argued that Hurd was innocent, but the board asked for his resignation to avoid negative public relations.[64] Public analysis was divided between those who saw it as a commendable tough action by HP in handling expenses irregularities, and those who saw it as an ill-advised, hasty, and expensive reaction in ousting a remarkably capable leader who had turned the business around.[62][63][65] At HP, Hurd oversaw a series of acquisitions worth over $20 billion, which allowed the company to expand into services of networking equipment and smartphones.[66] HP shares dropped by 8.4% in after-hours trading, hitting a 52-week low with $9 billion in market capitalization shaved off.[67] Larry Ellison publicly attacked HP's board for Hurd's ousting, stating that the HP board had \"made the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago\".[68]\n\n\nOn September 30, 2010, L\u00e9o Apotheker was named HP's new CEO and president.[69] His appointment sparked a strong reaction from Ellison,[70] who complained that Apotheker had been in charge of SAP when one of its subsidiaries was systematically stealing software from Oracle. SAP accepted that its subsidiary, which has now closed, illegally accessed Oracle intellectual property.[71] Following Hurd's departure, HP was seen to be problematic by the market, with margins falling and having failed to redirect and establish itself in major new markets such as cloud and mobile services.[*citation needed*] Apotheker's strategy was to broadly aim at disposing hardware and moving into the more profitable software services sector. On August 18, 2011, HP announced that it would strategically exit the smartphone and tablet computer business, and focus on higher-margin \"strategic priorities of Cloud, solutions and software with an emphasis on enterprise, commercial and government markets\".[72] It also contemplated selling off its personal computer division or spinning it off into a separate company,[73] and quitting PC development while continuing to sell servers and other equipment to business customers, which was a strategy undertaken by IBM in 2005.[74]\n\n\nHP's stock dropped by about a further 40% after the company abruptly announced a number of decisions: to discontinue its webOS device business (mobile phones and tablet computers), the intent to sell its personal computer division (at the time HP was the largest personal computer manufacturer in the world), and to acquire British big data software firm Autonomy for a 79% premium, seen externally as an \"absurdly high\" price[75] for a business with known concerns over its accounts.[76] Media analysts described HP's actions as a \"botched strategy shift\" and a \"chaotic\" attempt to rapidly reposition HP and enhance earnings.[75][77][78] The Autonomy acquisition was objected to by HP's own CFO.[79][80]:\u200a3\u20136\n\n\nHP lost more than $30 billion in market capitalization during Apotheker's tenure, and on September 22, 2011, the HP Board of Directors fired him as chief executive and replaced him with fellow board member and former eBay chief Meg Whitman,[81] with Raymond J. Lane as executive chairman. Although Apotheker served barely ten months, he received over $13 million in compensation.[82] Weeks later, HP announced that a review had concluded their PC division was too integrated and critical to business operations, and the company reaffirmed their commitment to the Personal Systems Group.[83] In November 2012, HP wrote off almost $9 billion related to the Autonomy acquisition, which became the subject of intense litigation, as HP accused Autonomy's previous management of fraudulently exaggerating Autonomy's financial position and called in law enforcement and regulators in both countries, while Autonomy's previous management accused HP of \"textbook\" obfuscation and finger pointing to protect HP's executives from criticism and conceal HP culpability, their prior knowledge of Autonomy's financial position, and gross mismanagement of Autonomy after acquisition.[80]:\u200a6\n\n\nOn March 21, 2012, HP said its printing and PC divisions would become one unit headed by Todd Bradley from the PC division, and printing chief Vyomesh Joshi left the company.[84]\n\n\nOn May 23, 2012, HP announced plans to lay off approximately 27,000 employees, after posting a profit decline of 31% in the second quarter of 2012.[85] Profits declined because of the growing popularity of smart phones, tablets, and other mobile devices, which slowed down personal computer sales.[86]\n\n\nOn May 30, 2012, HP unveiled its first net zero energy data center, which used solar energy and other renewable sources instead of traditional power grids.[87]\n\n\nOn July 10, 2012, HP's Server Monitoring Software was discovered to have a previously unknown security vulnerability.[88] A security warning was given to customers about two vulnerabilities, and a patch addressing the issues was released.[89] One month later, HP's official training center was hacked and defaced by a Pakistani hacker known as Hitcher to demonstrate a Web vulnerability.[90]\n\n\nOn September 10, 2012, HP revised their restructuring figures and started cutting 29,000 jobs.[91]\n\n\n\n### 2013\u20132015[edit]\n\n\nOn December 31, 2013, HP revised the number of jobs cut from 29,000 to 34,000 up to October 2014. The number of jobs cut until the end of 2013 was 24,600.[92][93][94] At the end of 2013 the company had 317,500 employees. On May 22, 2014, HP announced it would cut a further 11,000 to 16,000 jobs, in addition to the 34,000 announced in 2013. Whitman said: \"We are gradually shaping HP into a more nimble, lower-cost, more customer and partner-centric company that can successfully compete across a rapidly changing IT landscape.\"[95]\n\n\n During the June 2014 HP Discover customer event in Las Vegas, Whitman and Martin Fink announced a project for a radically new computer architecture called The Machine. Based on memristors and silicon photonics, it was supposed to come into commercialization before the end of the decade, and represented 75% of the research activity in HP Labs at the time.[96]\n\n\nOn October 6, 2014, HP announced it was going to split into two separate companies to separate its personal computer and printer businesses from its technology services. The split, which was first reported by *The Wall Street Journal* and confirmed by other media, resulted in two publicly traded companies on November 1, 2015: Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. The split was structured so that Hewlett-Packard changed its name to HP Inc. and spun off Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a new publicly traded company.[97][98] Whitman became chairman of HP Inc. and CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Patricia Russo became chairman of the enterprise business, and Dion Weisler became CEO of HP, Inc.[99][100][101]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2014, Hewlett-Packard announced their new Sprout personal computer.[102]\n\n\nIn May 2015, the company announced it would be selling its controlling 51 percent stake in its Chinese data-networking business to Tsinghua Unigroup for a fee of at least $2.4 billion.[103]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The research center of Hewlett-Packard in the Paris-Saclay cluster, France\nHP's global operations were directed from its headquarters in Palo Alto, California. Its US operations were directed from its facility in an unincorporated area of Harris County, Texas, near Houston. Its Latin America offices were in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, Florida. Its European offices were in Meyrin, close to Geneva, Switzerland,[104] but it also had a research center in the Paris-Saclay cluster 20\u00a0km south of Paris, France. Its Asia-Pacific offices were in Singapore.[105][106][107]\n\n\nIt also had large operations in Leixlip, Ireland;[108] Austin, Texas; Boise, Idaho; Corvallis, Oregon; Fort Collins, Colorado; Roseville, California; Saint Petersburg, Florida; San Diego, California; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Vancouver, Washington; Conway, Arkansas; and Plano, Texas. In the UK, HP was based at a large site in Bracknell, Berkshire, with offices in various UK locations, including a landmark office tower in London, 88 Wood Street. Its acquisition of 3Com expanded its employee base to Marlborough, Massachusetts, where it has been manufacturing its convertible laptop series since late 2019.[6] The company also had a large workforce and numerous offices in Bucharest, Romania, and at Bangalore, India, to address their back end and IT operations. Mphasis, which is headquartered at Bangalore, also enabled HP to increase their footprint in the city as it was a subsidiary of EDS which the company acquired.\n\n\n\n## Products and organizational structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)HP office in Japan\nHP produced lines of printers, scanners, digital cameras, calculators, personal digital assistants, servers, workstation computers, and computers for home and small-business use; many of the computers came from the 2002 merger with Compaq. HP as of 2001[update] promoted itself as supplying not just hardware and software, but also a full range of services to design, implement, and support IT infrastructure.\n\n\nHP's Imaging and Printing Group (IPG) was described by the company in 2005 as \"the leading imaging and printing systems provider in the world for printer hardware, printing supplies and scanning devices, providing solutions across customer segments from individual consumers to small and medium businesses to large enterprises\".[109]\n\n\n\nProducts and technology associated with IPG included the Inkjet and LaserJet printers, the Officejet all-in-one multifunction printer/scanner/faxes, Indigo Digital Press, the HP Photosmart digital cameras and photo printers, and the photo sharing service Snapfish.\n\n![](image)Hewlett-Packard 2014's desktop, monitor and laptop\n![](image)iPAQ h4150 Pocket PC from 2003\nOn December 23, 2008, HP released iPrint Photo for the iPhone.[110]\n\n\nHP's Personal Systems Group (PSG) was claimed by HP in 2005 to be \"one of the leading vendors of personal computers (\"PCs\") in the world based on unit volume shipped and annual revenue\".[109] PSG dealt with business and consumer PCs and accessories (such as e.g., HP Pavilion, Compaq Presario, and VoodooPC), handheld computing (e.g., iPAQ Pocket PC), digital \"connected\" entertainment (e.g., HP MediaSmart TVs, HP MediaSmart Servers, HP MediaVaults, DVD+RW drives) and Apple's iPod (until November 2005).[109]\n\n\nHP Enterprise Business (EB) incorporated HP Technology Services and Enterprise Services (an amalgamation of the former EDS, and what was known as HP Services). HP Enterprise Security Services oversaw professional services such as network security, information security and information assurance/compliancy, HP Software Division, and Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking Group (ESSN). The Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking Group (ESSN) oversaw \"back end\" products like storage and servers. HP Networking (former ProCurve) was responsible for the NW family of products.\n\n\n\n![](image)An HP camera with an SDIO interface, designed for use in conjunction with a Pocket PC\nHP Software Division was the company's enterprise software unit, which produced and marketed its brand of enterprise-management software, HP OpenView. From September 2005 HP purchased several software companies as part of a publicized, deliberate strategy to augment its software offerings for large business customers.[111] HP Software sold several categories of software, which included business service management software, application lifecycle management software, mobile apps, and enterprise security software (the latter of which included, ArcSight, Fortify Software, Atalla and TippingPoint). HP Software also provided software as a service (SaaS), cloud computing solutions, and software services, including consulting, education, professional services, and support.\n\n\nHP's Office of Strategy and Technology[112] had four main functions: To steer the company's $3.6\u00a0billion research and development investment; foster the development of the company's global technical community; lead the company's strategy and corporate development efforts,[113] and perform worldwide corporate marketing activities.\n\n\nHP Labs served as the research arm of HP.\n\n\nHP also offered managed services by which they provide complete IT-support solutions for other companies and organizations. One example of these was offering \"Professional Support\" and desktop \"Premier Support\" for Microsoft in the EMEA marketplace. This was done from the Leixlip campus near Dublin, Sofia and Israel. Support was offered for Microsoft Windows, Exchange, SharePoint, and some office applications.[114]\n\n\n\n## Staff and culture[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Hewlett-Packard executive leadership\n\n### Notable people[edit]\n\n\n* Michael Capellas (Compaq CEO/Chairman \u2013 HP President)[115]\n* Barney Oliver, founder and director of HP Labs\n* Steve Wozniak[116]\n* Tom Perkins\n* Carly Fiorina, 2016 Republican presidential candidate\n* Matt Shaheen, management consultant executive at HP Enterprise Services in Plano, Texas; Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives\n* Enrique Lores, CEO HP Inc.\n\n\n## Corporate social responsibility[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2007, the company announced that it had met its 2004 target to recycle one billion pounds of electronics, toner, and ink cartridges.[117] It set a new goal of recycling a further two billion pounds of hardware by the end of 2010. In 2006, the company recovered 187 million pounds of electronics.[118]\n\n\nIn 2008, HP released its supply chain emissions data.[119]\n\n\nIn September 2009, *Newsweek* ranked HP No. 1 on its 2009 Green Rankings of America's 500 largest corporations.[120] According to Environmental Leader (now Environment + Energy Leader), \"Hewlett-Packard earned its number one position due to its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction programs, and was the first major IT company to report GHG emissions associated with its supply chain, according to the ranking. In addition, HP has made an effort to remove toxic substances from its products, though Greenpeace has targeted the company for not doing better.\"[121]\n\n\nHP took the top spot on *Corporate Responsibility Magazine*'s 100 Best Corporate Citizens List for 2010.[122] HP beat out other Russell 1000 Index companies because of its leadership in seven categories including environment, climate changes and corporate philanthropy. In 2009, HP was ranked fifth.[123]\n\n\n*Fortune* magazine named HP one of the World's Most Admired Companies in 2010, placing it No. 2 in the computer industry and No. 32 overall in its list of the top 50. This year in the computer industry HP was ranked No. 1 in social responsibility, long-term investment, global competitiveness, and use of corporate assets.[124]\n\n\nIn May 2011, HP released a Global Responsibility report covering accomplishments in 2010.[125] It provides a comprehensive view of HP's global citizenship programs, performance, and goals and describes how HP used its technology, influence, and expertise to make a positive impact on the world. The company's 2009 report won best corporate responsibility report of the year,[126] and claims HP decreased its total energy use by 9 percent when compared with 2008. HP recovered a total of 118,000 tonnes of electronic products and supplies for recycling in 2009, including 61 million print cartridges.[127][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nIn an April 2010 *San Francisco Chronicle* article, HP was one of 12 companies commended for \"designing products to be safe from the start, following the principles of green chemistry\". The commendations came from Environment California, an environmental advocacy group, who praised select companies in the Golden State and the Bay Area for their conservational efforts.[128]\n\n\nIn May 2010, HP was named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Institute. It was one of 100 companies to earn the distinction of top winner and was the only computer hardware vendor to be recognized.[129]\n\n\nHP was listed in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks electronics manufacturers according to their policies on sustainability, energy and climate, and green products. In November 2011, HP secured first place (out of 15) in this ranking with a score of 5.9. It scored the most points on the new Sustainable Operations criteria, having the best program for measuring and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases from its suppliers and scoring maximum points for its thorough paper procurement policy.[130] In the November 2012 report, HP was ranked second with a score of 5.7.[131]\n\n\nHP earned recognition of its work in data privacy and security.[132] In 2010 the company ranked No. 4 in the Ponemon Institute's annual study of the most trusted companies for privacy.[133] Since 2006, HP has worked directly with the U.S. Congress, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the Department of Commerce to establish a new strategy for federal legislation.[134] HP played a key role in work toward the December 2010 FTC report \"Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change\".[135]\n\n\nAfter winning nine straight annual \"Most Respected Company in China\" awards from the Economic Observer and Peking University, HP China added the \"10 Year Contribution\" award to its list of accolades.[136]\n\n\nIn its 2012 rankings of consumer electronics companies on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated HP second out of 24 companies.[137]\n\n\n\n## Brand[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Hewlett-Packard sponsored Porsche 997 GT3 Cup\n![](image)The company sponsored the HP Pavilion at San Jose (now SAP Center at San Jose), home to the NHL's San Jose Sharks.\nAccording to a 2009 BusinessWeek study, HP was the world's 11th most valuable brand.[138]\n\n\nHP had many sponsorships, such as Mission: SPACE in Epcot at the Walt Disney World Resort.[139] From 1995 to 1999, and again from 2013, HP had been the shirt sponsor of Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur F.C.[140] From 1997 to 1999 they sponsored Australian Football League club North Melbourne Football Club.[*citation needed*] They also sponsored the Jordan Grand Prix from 1999 to 2001, Stewart Grand Prix in 1999, Jaguar Racing from 2000 to 2002, BMW Williams Formula 1 team until 2005 (a sponsorship formerly held by Compaq), and since 2010 sponsored Renault F1.[141] HP also had the naming rights arrangement for the HP Pavilion at San Jose, whose naming rights were acquired by SAP AG and consequently renamed SAP Center at San Jose.[142] HP also maintained a number of corporate sponsorships in the business sector, including sponsorships of trade organisations including Fespa (print trade exhibitions), and O'Reilly Media's Velocity (web development) conference.\n\n\nAfter the acquisition of Compaq in 2002, HP maintained the Compaq Presario brand on low-end home desktops and laptops, the HP Compaq brand on business desktops and laptops, and the HP ProLiant brand on Intel-architecture servers. The HP Pavilion brand was used on home entertainment laptops and all home desktops.[143]\n\n\nTandem's \"NonStop\" servers were rebranded as \"HP Integrity NonStop\".[144]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nThis article is about the company that existed from 1939 to 2015. For information about controversies concerning the successor company, see HP Inc. \u00a7\u00a0Controversies.\n\n### Restatement[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2003, HP restated its first-quarter cash flow from operations, reducing it by 18 percent because of an accounting error. The actual cash flow from operations was $647 million, and not $791 million as reported; HP shifted $144 million to net cash used in investing activities.[145]\n\n\n\n### Spying scandal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hewlett-Packard spying scandal\n\nOn September 5, 2006, Shawn Cabalfin and David O'Neil of *Newsweek* wrote that HP's general counsel, at the behest of chairwoman Patricia Dunn, contracted a team of independent security experts to investigate board members and several journalists to identify the source of an information leak.[146] In turn, those security experts recruited private investigators who used pretexting,[147] which involved investigators impersonating HP board members and nine journalists (including reporters for CNET, *The New York Times* and *The Wall Street Journal*) in order to obtain their phone records. The information leaked related to HP's long-term strategy and was published as part of a CNET article[148] in January 2006. Most HP employees accused of criminal acts have since been acquitted.[149]\n\n\n\n### Hardware[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2007, HP released a BIOS update covering a wide range of laptops with the intent to speed up the computer fan and have it run constantly while the computer was on or off[150] to prevent the overheating of defective Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) that had been shipped to many of the original equipment manufacturers, including HP, Dell, and Apple.[151] The defect concerned the new packaging material used by Nvidia from 2007 onwards in joining the graphics chip onto the motherboard, which did not perform well under thermal cycling and was prone to develop stress cracks \u2013 effectively severing the connection between the GPU and the motherboard that led to a blank screen.[152] In July 2008, HP issued an extension to the initial one-year warranty to replace the motherboards of selected models.[153] However this option was not extended to all models with the defective Nvidia chipsets, despite research showing that these computers were also affected by the fault.[154] Furthermore, the replacement of the motherboard was a temporary fix, since the fault was inherent in all units of the affected models from the point of manufacture, including the replacement motherboards offered by HP as a free \"repair\".[155][156] Since then, several websites have been documenting the issue.[157] There have been several small-claims lawsuits filed in several states, as well as suits filed in other countries. HP also faced a class-action lawsuit in 2009 over its i7 processor computers: the complainants stated that their systems consistently locked up within 30 minutes of powering on. Even after being replaced with newer i7 systems, the lockups continued.[158]\n\n\n\n### Lawsuit against Oracle[edit]\n\n\nHP filed a lawsuit in California Superior Court in Santa Clara, claiming that Oracle had breached an agreement to support the Itanium microprocessor used in HP's high-end enterprise servers.[159] On June 15, 2011, HP sent a \"formal legal demand\" letter to Oracle in an attempt to force them to reverse its decision to discontinue software development on Intel Itanium microprocessors[160] and build its own servers.[161] HP won the lawsuit in 2012, which required Oracle to continue producing software compatible with the Itanium processor.[162] HP was awarded $3 billion in damages against Oracle on June 30, 2016,[161][163] arguing that Oracle canceling support damaged HP's Itanium server brand. Oracle said it would appeal both the decision and damages.\n\n\n\n### HP wage and hour lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nSeveral class action firms filed a class action lawsuit on January 12, 2012, against HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (\u201cHP\u201d), entitled \"Jeffrey Wall, etc. v. HP, Inc.\" (formerly known as Hewlett-Packard Company, et al.), Case No. 30-2012-00537897, pending in the Superior Court of California, County of Orange. According to the lawsuit, HP allegedly failed to pay commission payments and incentive compensation that its California sales employees were owed within the timeframes proscribed by California law (Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 201, 202 and 204).[164] In 2017, FDAzar obtained a settlement of $25 million for class participants and changed the way HP pays incentive compensation and commission payments.[165]\n\n\n\n### Takeover of Autonomy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Autonomy Corporation \u00a7\u00a0Hewlett-Packard\n\nIn November 2012, HP recorded a write-down of around $8.8 billion related to its acquisition a year earlier of the UK-based Autonomy Corporation PLC. HP accused Autonomy of deliberately inflating the value of the company prior to its takeover, which the former management team of Autonomy denied.\n\n\nAt that time, HP had fired its previous CEO for expenses irregularities a year before, and appointed Apotheker as CEO and president. HP was seen as problematic by the market, with margins falling and having failed to redirect and establish itself in major new markets such as cloud and mobile services.\n\n\nAs part of Apotheker's strategy, Autonomy was acquired by HP in October 2011. HP paid $10.3 billion for 87.3% of the shares, valuing Autonomy at around $11.7 billion (\u00a37.4 billion) overall, a premium of around 79% over market price. The deal was widely criticized as \"absurdly high\", a \"botched strategy shift\" and a \"chaotic\" attempt to rapidly reposition HP and enhance earnings,[75][77][78] and had been objected to even by HP's own CFO.[79][80]:\u200a3\u20136 Within a year, Apotheker was fired, major culture clashes became apparent, and HP wrote off $8.8 billion of Autonomy's value.[79]\n\n\nHP claimed that this resulted from \"accounting improprieties, misrepresentations and disclosure failures\" by the previous management, who in turn accused HP of a \"textbook example of defensive stalling\"[80]:\u200a6 to conceal evidence of its own prior knowledge, gross mismanagement, and undermining of the company, noting public awareness since 2009 of its financial reporting issues[80]:\u200a3 and that even HP's CFO disagreed with the price paid.[79][80]:\u200a3\u20136 External observers generally stated that only a small part of the write-off appears to be due to accounting mis-statements, and that HP had previously overpaid for businesses.[79][166]\n\n\nThe Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and the SEC joined the FBI in investigating the potential anomalies. HP incurred damage with its stock falling to its lowest in decades.[167][168][169] Three lawsuits were brought by shareholders against HP for the fall in value of HP shares. In August 2014, a United States district court judge threw out a proposed settlement, which Autonomy's previous management had argued would be collusive and intended to divert scrutiny of HP's own responsibility and knowledge. It essentially engaged the plaintiff's attorneys from the existing cases and redirected them against the previous Autonomy vendors and management for a fee of up to $48 million, with plaintiffs agreeing to end any claims against HP's management and similarly redirect those claims against the previous Autonomy vendors and management.[170][171] In January 2015 the SFO closed its investigation as the likelihood of a successful prosecution was low.[172] The dispute continued in the US, and is being investigated by the UK and Ireland Financial Reporting Council. On June 9, 2015, HP agreed to pay $100 million to investors who bought HP shares between August 19, 2011 and November 20, 2012, to settle the lawsuits over the Autonomy purchase.[173]\n\n\nAnother term of the shareholder settlement was to sue Autonomy management, which occurred in London in 2019. HP \"failed to produce a smoking gun for the fraud it alleges\",[174] and its accountants admitted that they \"never formally prepared anything to attribute the irregularities to the amount of the fraud\".[174]\n\n\n\n### Israeli settlements[edit]\n\n\nOn October 25, 2012, Richard Falk, the United Nations Human Rights Council's Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, called to boycott HP and other businesses that profit from Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian lands until they brought their operations in line with international human rights and humanitarian law.[175][176] In 2014, the Presbyterian Church voted to move forward with divestment from HP to pressure Israel in regards to their policies toward Palestinians.[177] In 2015, the Human Rights Commission of Portland, Oregon, requested to place Caterpillar, G4S, HP, and Motorola Solutions on the city's \"Do Not Buy\" list.[178]\n\n\n\n### Bribery[edit]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2014, an administrative proceeding before the SEC was settled by HP consenting to an order acknowledging that HP had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when HP subsidiaries in Russia, Poland, and Mexico made improper payments to government officials to obtain or retain lucrative public contracts.[179]\n\n\nThe SEC's order found that HP's subsidiary in Russia paid more than $2 million through agents and various shell companies to a Russian government official to retain a multimillion-dollar contract with the federal prosecutor's office; in Poland, HP's subsidiary provided gifts and cash bribes worth more than $600,000 to a Polish government official to obtain contracts with the national police agency; and to win a software sale to Mexico's state-owned petroleum company, HP's subsidiary in Mexico paid more than $1 million in inflated commissions to a consultant with close ties to company officials, one of whom was funneled money. HP agreed to pay $108 million to settle the SEC charges and a parallel criminal case.[180][179][181]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)San Francisco Bay Area portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* ArcSight\n* Fortify\n* HP calculators\n* HP Linux Imaging and Printing\n* HP Software & Solutions\n* HP User Group\n* List of acquisitions by Hewlett-Packard\n* List of computer system manufacturers\n* List of Hewlett-Packard products\n* TippingPoint\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"History and Facts: The beginning\". *www.hpmemoryproject.org*.

It develops, sells, repairs, and supports computers and related products and services. Dell is owned by its parent company, Dell Technologies.[4][5]\n\n\nDell sells personal computers (PCs), servers, data storage devices, network switches, software, computer peripherals, HDTVs, cameras, printers, and electronics built by other manufacturers. The company is known for how it manages its supply chain and electronic commerce. This includes Dell selling directly to customers and delivering PCs that the customer wants.[6][5] Dell was a pure hardware vendor until 2009 when it acquired Perot Systems. Dell then entered the market for IT services. The company has expanded storage and networking systems. It is now expanding from offering computers only to delivering a range of technology for enterprise customers.[7][8]\n\n\nDell is a subsidiary of Dell Technologies, Inc., a publicly traded company (Nasdaq:\u00a0DELL), as well as a component of the NASDAQ-100 and S&P 500. It is the third-largest personal computer vendor as of January 2021.[9][10] Dell is ranked 31st on the Fortune 500 list in 2022,[11] up from 76th in 2021.[12] It is also the sixth-largest company in Texas by total revenue, according to *Fortune* magazine. It is the second-largest non-oil company in Texas.[13][14]\n\n\nIn 2015, Dell acquired the enterprise technology firm EMC Corporation. Dell and EMC became divisions of Dell Technologies. Dell EMC sells data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, and cloud computing.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michael Dell (founder)\n![Dell's first logo from 1987 to 1989](image)\nDell's first logo from 1987 to 1989\n![Dell's former logo, used from 1989 to 2010](image)\nDell's former logo, used from 1989 to 2010\n![Dell's logo, used before the acquisition of EMC, used from 2010 to 2016](image)\nDell's logo used before the acquisition of EMC, used from 2010 to 2016, continued to be used on some products until early 2018\n\n### Founding and start-up[edit]\n\n\nMichael Dell founded Dell Computer Corporation, doing business as *PC's Limited* in 1984 while a student at the University of Texas at Austin,[16] operating from Michael Dell's off-campus dormitory room at Dobie Center.[17] The start-up aimed to sell IBM PC compatible computers built from stock components. Michael Dell started trading in the belief that, by selling personal computer systems directly to customers, PC's Limited could better understand customers' needs and provide the most effective computing solutions to meet those needs.[18] Dell dropped out of college upon completion of his freshman year at the University of Texas in order to focus full-time on his fledgling business, after getting about $1,000 in expansion-capital from his family.[19] As of April 2021, Dell's net worth was estimated to be over $50 billion (equivalent to $55,470,000,000 in 2023).[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)PC's Limited Turbo PC, circa 1985In 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the \"Turbo PC\", selling for US$795 (equivalent to $1,913 in 2023)[21] and containing an Intel 8088-compatible processor capable of running at a maximum speed of 8\u00a0MHz.[22] PC's Limited advertised the systems in national computer magazines for sale directly to consumers, and custom assembled each ordered unit according to a selection of options. This offered buyers prices lower than those of retail brands, but with greater convenience than assembling the components themselves. Pc's Limited was not the first company to use this business model, but they became one of the first to succeed with it. The company grossed more than $73 million in its first year of trading.\n\n\nThe company dropped the *PC's Limited* name in 1987 to become Dell Computer Corporation and began expanding globally. The reasoning was that this new company name better reflected its presence in the business market, and also resolved issues with the use of \"Limited\" in a company name in certain countries.[23] The company set up its first international operations in Britain; 11 more followed within the next four years. In June 1988, Dell Computer's market capitalization grew by $30 million to $80 million (equivalent to $177,850,000 in 2023) from its June 22 initial public offering of 3.5 million shares at $8.50 a share.[24] In 1989, Dell Computer set up its first on-site service programs in order to compensate for the lack of local retailers prepared to act as service centers.\n\n\n\n### Growth in the 1990s and early 2000s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dell Latitude CPx laptop\nIn 1990, Dell Computer tried selling its products indirectly through warehouse clubs and computer superstores, but met with little success, and the company re-focused on its more successful direct-to-consumer sales model. In 1992, *Fortune* included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's 500 largest companies, making Michael Dell the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company at that time.\n\n\nIn 1993, to complement its own direct sales channel, Dell planned to sell PCs at big-box retail outlets such as Wal-Mart, which would have brought in an additional $125 million (equivalent to $238,100,000 in 2023) in annual revenue. Bain consultant Kevin Rollins persuaded Michael Dell to pull out of these deals, believing they would be money losers in the long run.[25] Margins at retail were thin at best and Dell left the reseller channel in 1994.[26] Rollins would soon join Dell full-time and eventually become the company president and CEO.\n\n\nOriginally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed when the company's Internet site took off in 1996 and 1997.[19] While the industry's average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.[26]\n\n\nFrom 1997 to 2004, Dell steadily grew and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps. During the same period, rival PC vendors such as Compaq, Gateway, IBM, Packard Bell, and AST Research struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out.[27] Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999. Operating costs made up only 10 percent of Dell's $35 billion in revenue in 2002 (equivalent to $56,680,000,000 in 2023), compared with 21 percent of revenue at Hewlett-Packard, 25 percent at Gateway, and 46 percent at Cisco.[28] In 2002, when Compaq merged with Hewlett-Packard (the fourth-place PC maker), the newly combined Hewlett-Packard took the top spot for a time but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead. Dell grew the fastest in the early 2000s.[6]\n\n\nIn 2002, Dell expanded its product line to include televisions, handhelds, digital audio players, and printers. Chairman and CEO Michael Dell had repeatedly blocked President and COO Kevin Rollins's attempt to lessen the company's heavy dependency on PCs, which Rollins wanted to fix by acquiring EMC Corporation; a move that would eventually occur over 12 years later.[29]\n\n\nIn 2003, at the annual company meeting, the stockholders approved changing the company name to \"Dell Inc.\" to recognize the company's expansion beyond computers.[30]\n\n\nIn 2004, the company announced that it would build a new assembly-plant near Winston-Salem, North Carolina; the city and county provided Dell with $37.2 million in incentive packages; the state provided approximately $250 million (equivalent to $386,600,000 in 2023) in incentives and tax breaks. In July, Michael Dell stepped aside as chief executive officer while retaining his position as chairman of the board.[31] Kevin Rollins, who had held a number of executive posts at Dell, became the new CEO. Despite no longer holding the CEO title, Dell essentially acted as a de facto co-CEO with Rollins.[29]\n\n\nUnder Rollins, Dell purchased the computer hardware manufacturer Alienware in 2006. Dell Inc.'s plan anticipated Alienware continuing to operate independently under its existing management. Alienware expected to benefit from Dell's efficient manufacturing system.[32]\n\n\n\n### Key events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dell Axim X51v\nIn 2005, while earnings and sales continued to rise, sales growth slowed considerably, and the company stock lost 25% of its value that year.[33] By June 2006, the stock traded around US$25 which was 40% down from July 2005\u2014the high-water mark of the company in the post-dotcom era.[34][35] By June 2021, the stock had reached an all-time high of over US$100 per share, reflecting the company's successful transition to a technology solutions provider that helps customers navigate digital transformation.[36]\n\n\nThe slowing sales growth has been attributed to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell's sales, and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC business segments such as storage, services, and servers. Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs,[37] but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation.[38] Throughout the entire PC industry, declines in prices along with commensurate increases in performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to upsell to their customers. As a result, the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins.[27] The laptop segment had become the fastest-growing of the PC market, but Dell produced low-cost notebooks in China like other PC manufacturers which eliminated Dell's manufacturing cost advantages, plus Dell's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing notebook sales in big box stores.[34] *CNET* has suggested that Dell was getting trapped in the increasing commoditization of high volume low margin computers, which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded.[37]\n\n\nDespite plans of expanding into other global regions and product segments, Dell was heavily dependent on US corporate PC market, as desktop PCs sold to both commercial and corporate customers accounted for 32 percent of its revenue, 85 percent of its revenue comes from businesses, and 64 percent of its revenue comes from North and South America, according to its 2006 third-quarter results. US shipments of desktop PCs were shrinking, and the corporate PC market, which purchases PCs in upgrade cycles, had largely decided to take a break from buying new systems. The last cycle started around 2002, three or so years after companies started buying PCs ahead of the perceived Y2K problems, and corporate clients were not expected to upgrade again until extensive testing of Microsoft's Windows Vista (expected in early 2007), putting the next upgrade cycle around 2008.[39][40] Heavily dependent on PCs, Dell had to slash prices to boost sales volumes, while demanding deep cuts from suppliers.[29]\n\n\nDell had long stuck by its direct sales model. Consumers had become the main drivers of PC sales in recent years,[40] yet there had a decline in consumers purchasing PCs through the Web or on the phone, as increasing numbers were visiting consumer electronics retail stores to try out the devices first. Dell's rivals in the PC industry, HP, Gateway and Acer, had a long retail presence and so were well poised to take advantage of the consumer shift.[41] The lack of a retail presence stymied Dell's attempts to offer consumer electronics such as flat-panel TVs and MP3 players.[37] Dell responded by experimenting with mall kiosks, plus quasi-retail stores in Texas and New York.[39]\n\n\nDell had a reputation as a company that relied upon supply chain efficiencies to sell established technologies at low prices, instead of being an innovator.[29][41][42] By the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector. Dell's low spending on R&D relative to its revenue (compared to IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Apple Inc.)\u2014which worked well in the commoditized PC market\u2014prevented it from making inroads into more lucrative segments, such as MP3 players and later mobile devices.[33] Increasing spending on R&D would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized.[6] Dell had done well with a horizontal organization that focused on PCs when the computing industry moved to horizontal mix-and-match layers in the 1980s, but by the mid-2000 the industry shifted to vertically integrated stacks to deliver an end-to-end IT product, and Dell lagged far behind competitors like Hewlett-Packard and Oracle.[38]\n\n\nDell's reputation for poor customer service, which was exacerbated as it moved call centers offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure, came under increasing scrutiny on the Web. The original Dell model was known for high customer satisfaction when PCs sold for thousands of dollars but by the 2000s, the company could not justify that level of service when computers in the same line-up sold for hundreds of dollars.[*citation needed*] Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from the head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting \"got in the way,\" aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve on this and rolled out *DellConnect* to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional \"bloatware\" on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the \"Dell Hell\" prominent on Internet search engines.[34][43]\n\n\nThere was also criticism that Dell used faulty components for its PCs, particularly the 11.8 million OptiPlex desktop computers sold to businesses and governments from May 2003 to July 2005 that suffered from faulty capacitors.[44] A battery recall in August 2006, as a result of a Dell laptop catching fire, caused much negative attention for the company though later, Sony was found responsible for the manufacturing of the batteries, however a Sony spokesman said the problem concerned the combination of the battery with a charger, which was specific to Dell.[45]\n\n\n2006 marked the first year that Dell's growth was slower than the PC industry as a whole. By the fourth quarter of 2006, Dell lost its title of the largest PC manufacturer to Hewlett Packard whose Personal Systems Group was invigorated thanks to a restructuring initiated by their CEO Mark Hurd.[33][46][47]\n\n\n\n#### SEC investigation[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2005, Dell became the subject of an informal investigation by the United States SEC.[48] In 2006, the company disclosed that the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York had subpoenaed documents related to the company's financial reporting dating back to 2002.[49] The company delayed filing financial reports for the third and fourth fiscal quarter of 2006, and several class-action lawsuits were filed.[50] Dell Inc's failure to file its quarterly earnings report could have subjected the company to de-listing from the NASDAQ,[51] but the exchange granted Dell a waiver, allowing the stock to trade normally.[52] In August 2007, the Company announced that it would restate its earnings for fiscal years 2003 through 2006 and the first quarter of 2007 after an internal audit found that certain employees had changed corporate account balances to meet quarterly financial targets.[53] In July 2010, the SEC announced charges against several senior Dell executives, including Dell Chairman and CEO Michael Dell, former CEO Kevin Rollins, and former CFO James Schneider, \"with failing to disclose material information to investors and using fraudulent accounting to make it falsely appear that the company was consistently meeting Wall Street earnings targets and reducing its operating expenses.\" Dell, inc. was fined $100 million, with Michael Dell personally fined $4 million.[54]\n\n\n\n#### Michael Dell resumes CEO role[edit]\n\n\nAfter four out of five quarterly earnings reports were below expectations, Rollins resigned as president and CEO on January 31, 2007, and founder Michael Dell assumed the role of CEO again.[55]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2007, the company issued a preliminary quarterly earnings report showing gross sales of $14.4 billion, down 5% year-over-year, and net income of $687 million (30 cents per share), down 33%. Net earnings would have declined even more if not for the effects of eliminated employee bonuses, which accounted for six cents per share. NASDAQ extended the company's deadline for filing financials to May 4.[56]\n\n\n\n### Dell 2.0 and downsizing[edit]\n\n\nDell announced a change campaign called \"Dell 2.0,\" reducing the number of employees and diversifying the company's products.[41][57] While chairman of the board after relinquishing his CEO position, Michael Dell still had significant input in the company during Rollins' years as CEO. With the return of Michael Dell as CEO, the company saw changes in operations, the exodus of many senior vice-presidents and new personnel brought in from outside the company.[39] Michael Dell announced a number of initiatives and plans (part of the \"Dell 2.0\" initiative) to improve the company's financial performance. These include elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards, reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to Michael Dell from 20 to 12, and reduction of \"bureaucracy\". Jim Schneider retired as CFO and was replaced by Donald Carty, as the company came under an SEC probe for its accounting practices.[58]\n\n\nOn April 23, 2008, Dell announced the closure of one of its biggest Canadian call-centers in Kanata, Ontario, terminating approximately 1100 employees, with 500 of those redundancies effective on the spot, and with the official closure of the center scheduled for the summer. The call-center had opened in 2006 after the city of Ottawa won a bid to host it. Less than a year later, Dell planned to double its workforce to nearly 3,000 workers add a new building. These plans were reversed, due to a high Canadian dollar that made the Ottawa staff relatively expensive, and also as part of Dell's turnaround, which involved moving these call-center jobs offshore to cut costs.\n[59] \nThe company had also announced the shutdown of its Edmonton, Alberta, office, losing 900 jobs. In total, Dell announced the ending of about 8,800 jobs in 2007\u20132008\u00a0\u2014 10% of its workforce.[60]\n\n\nBy the late 2000s, Dell's \"configure to order\" approach of manufacturing\u2014delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications from its US facilities was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers as PCs became powerful low-cost commodities.[5][61] Dell closed plants that produced desktop computers for the North American market, including the Mort Topfer Manufacturing Center in Austin, Texas (original location)[62][63] and Lebanon, Tennessee (opened in 1999) in 2008 and early 2009, respectively. The desktop production plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, received US$280 million in incentives from the state and opened in 2005 (equivalent to $419,900,000 in 2023), but ceased operations in November 2010. Dell's contract with the state required them to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions, and they sold the North Carolina plant to Herbalife.[64][65][66] Much work was transferred to manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's own factories overseas.[61] On January 8, 2009, Dell announced the closure of its manufacturing plant in Limerick, Ireland, with the loss of 1,900 jobs and the transfer of production to its plant in \u0141od\u017a in Poland.[67]\n\n\n\n### Attempts at diversification[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dell Streak smartphone\nThe release of Apple's iPad tablet computer had a negative impact on Dell and other major PC vendors, as consumers switched away from desktop and laptop PCs. Dell's own mobility division has not managed success with developing smartphones or tablets, whether running Windows or Google Android.[68][69] The Dell Streak was a failure commercially and critically due to its outdated OS, numerous bugs, and low resolution screen. *InfoWorld* suggested that Dell and other OEMs saw tablets as a short-term, low-investment opportunity running Google Android, an approach that neglected user interface and failed to gain long term market traction with consumers.[70][71] Dell has responded by pushing higher-end PCs, such as the XPS line of notebooks, which do not compete with the Apple iPad and Kindle Fire tablets.[72] The growing popularity of smartphones and tablet computers instead of PCs drove Dell's consumer segment to an operating loss in Q3 2012. In December 2012, Dell suffered its first decline in holiday sales in five years, despite the introduction of Windows 8.[73]\n\n\nIn the shrinking PC industry, Dell continued to lose market share, as it dropped below Lenovo in 2011 to fall to number three in the world. Dell and fellow American contemporary Hewlett Packard came under pressure from Asian PC manufacturers Lenovo, Asus, and Acer, all of which had lower production costs and were willing to accept lower profit margins. In addition, while the Asian PC vendors had been improving their quality and design\u2014for instance, Lenovo's ThinkPad series was winning corporate customers away from Dell's laptops\u2014Dell's customer service and reputation had been slipping.[74][75] Dell remained the second-most profitable PC vendor, as it took 13 percent of operating profits in the PC industry during Q4 2012, behind Apple's Mac that took 45 percent, seven percent at Hewlett Packard, six percent at Lenovo and Asus, and one percent for Acer.[76]\n\n\nDell attempted to offset its declining PC business, which still accounted for half of its revenue and generates steady cash flow,[77] by expanding into the enterprise market with servers, networking, software, and services.[78] It avoided many of the acquisition write-downs and management turnover that plagued its chief rival Hewlett Packard.[69][79] Despite spending $13 billion on acquisitions to diversify its portfolio beyond hardware,[8] the company was unable to convince the market that it could thrive or made the transformation in the post-PC world,[79] as it suffered continued declines in revenue and share price.[80][81][82][83] Dell's market share in the corporate segment was previously a \"moat\" against rivals but this has no longer been the case as sales and profits have fallen precipitously.[84]\n\n\n\n### 2013 buyout[edit]\n\n\nAfter several weeks of rumors, which started around January 11, 2013, Dell announced on February 5, 2013, that it had struck a $24.4 billion (equivalent to $31,470,000,000 in 2023) leveraged buyout deal, that would have delisted its shares from the NASDAQ and Hong Kong Stock Exchange and taken it private.[85][86][87] Reuters reported that Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners, aided by a $2 billion loan from Microsoft, would acquire the public shares at $13.65 apiece.[88] The $24.4 billion buyout was projected to be the largest leveraged buyout backed by private equity since the 2007 financial crisis (equivalent to $34,550,000,000 in 2023).[89] It is also the largest technology buyout ever, surpassing the 2006 buyout of Freescale Semiconductor for $17.5 billion (equivalent to $25,450,000,000 in 2023).[89]\n\n\nMichael Dell said of the February offer \"I believe this transaction will open an exciting new chapter for Dell, our customers and team members\".[90] Dell rival Lenovo responded to the buyout, saying, \"the financial actions of some of our traditional competitors will not substantially change our outlook.\"[90]\n\n\nIn March 2013, the Blackstone Group and Carl Icahn expressed interest in purchasing Dell.[91] In April 2013, Blackstone withdrew their offer, citing deteriorating business.[92][93] Other private equity firms such as KKR & Co. and TPG Capital declined to submit alternative bids for Dell, citing the uncertain market for personal computers and competitive pressures, so the \"wide-open bidding war\" never materialized.[8] Analysts said that the biggest challenge facing Silver Lake would be to find an \"exit strategy\" to profit from its investment, which would be when the company would hold an IPO to go public again, and one warned \"But even if you can get a $25bn enterprise value for Dell, it will take years to get out.\"[94]\n\n\nIn May 2013, Michael Dell joined his board in voting for the offer.[95] The following August he reached a deal with the special committee on the board for $13.88 per share, a raised price of $13.75 plus a special dividend of 13 cents, as well as a change to the voting rules.[96] The $13.88 cash offer (plus a $.08 per share dividend for the third fiscal quarter) was accepted on September 12[97] and closed on October 30, 2013, ending Dell's 25-year run as a publicly-traded company.\n\n\nAfter the buyout, the newly private Dell offered a Voluntary Separation Program that they expected to reduce their workforce by up to seven percent. The reception to the program so exceeded the expectations that Dell may be forced to hire new staff to make up for the losses.[98]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\nOn November 19, 2015, Dell, alongside ARM Holdings, Cisco Systems, Intel, Microsoft, and Princeton University, founded the OpenFog Consortium, to promote interests and development in fog computing.[99]\n\n\n\n#### Acquisition of EMC[edit]\n\n\nOn October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire EMC Corporation in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $67 billion (equivalent to $84,210,000,000 in 2023), which has been considered the largest-ever acquisition in the technology sector.[100][101] As part of the acquisition, Dell would take over EMC's 81% stake in the cloud-computing and virtualization company VMWare.[102] This would combine Dell's enterprise server, personal computer, and mobile businesses with EMC's enterprise storage business in a significant Vertical merger of IT giants. Dell would pay $24.05 per share of EMC, and $9.05 per share of tracking stock in VMware.[103][104][101]\n\n\nThe announcement came two years after Dell Inc. returned to private ownership, claiming that it faced bleak prospects and would need several years out of the public eye to rebuild its business.[105] It was thought that the company's value had roughly doubled since then.[106] EMC was being pressured by Elliott Management, a hedge fund holding 2.2% of EMC's stock, to reorganize their unusual \"Federation\" structure, in which EMC's divisions were effectively being run as independent companies. Elliott argued[107] this structure deeply undervalued EMC's core \"EMC II\" data storage business, and that increasing competition between EMC II and VMware products was confusing the market and hindering both companies. *The Wall Street Journal* estimated that in 2014 Dell had revenue of $27.3 billion (equivalent to $34,610,000,000 in 2023) from personal computers and $8.9 billion from servers, while EMC had $16.5 billion from EMC II, $1 billion from RSA Security, $6 billion from VMware, and $230 million from Pivotal Software.[108] EMC owns around 80 percent of the stock of VMware.[109] The proposed acquisition will maintain VMware as a separate company, held via a new tracking stock, while the other parts of EMC will be rolled into Dell.[110] Once the acquisition closes Dell will again publish quarterly financial results, having ceased these on going private in 2013.[111]\n\n\nThe combined business was expected to address the markets for scale-out architecture, converged infrastructure and private cloud computing, playing to the strengths of both EMC and Dell.[108][112] Commentators have questioned the deal, with FBR Capital Markets saying that though it makes a \"ton of sense\" for Dell, it's a \"nightmare scenario that would lack strategic synergies\" for EMC.[113] *Fortune* said there was a lot for Dell to like in EMC's portfolio, but \"does it all add up enough to justify tens of billions of dollars for the entire package? Probably not.\"[114] *The Register* reported the view of William Blair & Company that the merger would \"blow up the current IT chess board\", forcing other IT infrastructure vendors to restructure to achieve scale and vertical integration.[115] The value of VMware stock fell 10% after the announcement, valuing the deal at around $63\u201364bn rather than the $67bn originally reported.[116] Key investors backing the deal besides Dell were Singapore's Temasek Holdings and Silver Lake Partners.[117]\n\n\nOn September 7, 2016, Dell completed the merger with EMC, which involved the issuance of $45.9 billion (equivalent to $57,140,000,000 in 2023) in debt and $4.4 billion (equivalent to $5,478,000,000 in 2023) of common stock.[118][119] At the time, some analysts claimed that Dell's acquisition of the former Iomega could harm the LenovoEMC partnership.[120]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Dell announced intentions to become a publicly traded company again by paying $21.7 billion (equivalent to $25,940,000,000 in 2023) in both cash and stock to buy back shares from its stake in VMware, offering shareholders roughly 60 cents on the dollar as part of the deal.[121][102] In November, Carl Icahn (9.3% owner of Dell) sued the company over plans to go public.[122] As a result of pressure from Icahn and other activist investors, Dell renegotiated the deal, ultimately offering shareholders about 80% of market value. As part of this deal, Dell once again became a public company, with the original Dell computer business and Dell EMC operating under the newly created parent, **Dell Technologies**.[102]\n\n\nPost-acquisition, Dell was re-organized with a new parent company, Dell Technologies; Dell's consumer and workstation businesses are internally referred to as the Dell Client Solutions Group, and is one of the company's three main business divisions alongside Dell EMC and VMware.[123][124][125]\n\n\nIn January 2021 (equivalent to $14,420,000,000 in 2023), Dell reported $94 billion (equivalent to $104,280,000,000 in 2023) in sales and $13 billion operating cash flow during 2020.[102]\n\n\n\n### Dell and AMD[edit]\n\n\nWhen Dell acquired Alienware early in 2006, some Alienware systems had AMD chips. On August 17, 2006, a Dell press release[126] stated that starting in September, Dell Dimension desktop computers would have AMD processors and that later in the year Dell would release a two-socket, quad-processor server using AMD Opteron chips, moving away from Dell's tradition of only offering Intel processors in Dell PCs.\n\n\nCNet's News.com on August 17, 2006, cited Dell's CEO Kevin Rollins as attributing the move to AMD processors to lower costs and to AMD technology.[127] AMD's senior VP in commercial business, Marty Seyer, stated: \"Dell's wider embrace of AMD processor-based offerings is a win for Dell, for the industry and most importantly for Dell customers.\"\n\n\nOn October 23, 2006, Dell announced new AMD-based servers\u00a0\u2014 the PowerEdge 6950 and the PowerEdge SC1435.\n\n\nOn November 1, 2006, Dell's website began offering notebooks based on AMD processors (the Inspiron 1501 with a 15.4-inch (390\u00a0mm) display) with the choice of a single-core MK-36 processor, dual-core Turion X2 chips or Mobile Sempron.[128]\n\n\nIn 2017, Dell released the AlienWare 17. The model was primarily based on NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 systems.[129]\n\n\n\n### Dell and desktop Linux[edit]\n\n\nIn 1998, Ralph Nader asked Dell (and five other major OEMs) to offer alternate operating systems to Microsoft Windows, specifically including Linux, for which \"there is clearly a growing interest\".[130][131] Possibly coincidentally, Dell started offering Linux notebook systems that \"cost no more than their Windows 98 counterparts\" in 2000,[132] and soon expanded, with Dell becoming \"the first major manufacturer to offer Linux across its full product line\".[133] However, by early 2001 Dell had \"disbanded its Linux business unit.\"[134]\n\n\nOn February 26, 2007, Dell announced that it had commenced a program to sell and distribute a range of computers with pre-installed Linux distributions as an alternative to Microsoft Windows. Dell indicated that Novell's SUSE Linux would appear first.[135] However, the next day, Dell announced that its previous announcement related to certifying the hardware as ready to work with Novell SUSE Linux and that it (Dell) had no plans to sell systems pre-installed with Linux in the near future.[136] On March 28, 2007, Dell announced that it would begin shipping some desktops and laptops with Linux pre-installed, although it did not specify which distribution of Linux or which hardware would lead.[137] On April 18, a report appeared suggesting that Michael Dell used Ubuntu on one of his home systems.[138] On May 1, 2007, Dell announced it would ship the Ubuntu Linux distribution.[139] On May 24, 2007, Dell started selling models with Ubuntu Linux 7.04 pre-installed: a laptop, a budget computer, and a high-end PC.[140]\n\n\nOn June 27, 2007, Dell announced on its Direct2Dell blog that it planned to offer more pre-loaded systems (the new Dell Inspiron desktops and laptops). After the IdeaStorm site supported extending the bundles beyond the US market, Dell later announced more international marketing.[141] On August 7, 2007, Dell officially announced that it would offer one notebook and one desktop in the UK, France and Germany with Ubuntu \"pre-installed\". At LinuxWorld 2007 Dell announced plans to provide Novell's SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop on selected models in China, \"factory-installed\".[142] On November 30, 2007, Dell reported shipping 40,000 Ubuntu PCs.[143] On January 24, 2008, Dell in Germany, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom launched a second laptop, an XPS M1330 with Ubuntu 7.10, for 849 euro or GBP 599 upwards.[144] On February 18, 2008, Dell announced that the Inspiron 1525 would have Ubuntu as an optional operating system.[145] On February 22, 2008, Dell announced plans to sell Ubuntu in Canada and in Latin America[146] From September 16, 2008, Dell has shipped both Dell Ubuntu Netbook Remix and Windows XP Home versions of the Inspiron Mini 9 and the Inspiron Mini 12. As of November 2009[update] Dell shipped the Inspiron Mini laptops with Ubuntu version 8.04.[147]\n\n\nAs of 2021, Dell continues to offer select laptops and workstations with Ubuntu Linux pre-installed, under the \"Developer Edition\" moniker.[148]\n\n\n\n## List of Dell marketing slogans[edit]\n\n\n* **Be direct** (1998-2001)\n* **Easy as Dell** (2001-2004)\n* **Get more out of now** (2004\u20132005)\n* **It's a Dell** (2005-2006)\n* **Dell.

The top floor continued to hold Dell's board room, demonstration center, and visitor meeting room. Less than one month prior to August 29, 1994, Dell moved 1,100 customer support and telephone sales employees to Round Rock.[187] Dell's lease in the Arboretum had been scheduled to expire in 1994.[188]\n\n\n\n![](image)The company sponsors Dell Diamond, the home stadium of the Round Rock Express, the AAA minor league baseball affiliate of the Texas Rangers major league baseball team.\nBy 1996, Dell was moving its headquarters to Round Rock.[189] As of January 1996, 3,500 people still worked at the current Dell headquarters. One building of the Round Rock headquarters, Round Rock 3, had space for 6,400 employees and was scheduled to be completed in November 1996.[190] In 1998 Dell announced that it was going to add two buildings to its Round Rock complex, adding 1,600,000 square feet (150,000\u00a0m2) of office space to the complex.[191]\n\n\nIn 2000, Dell announced that it would lease 80,000 square feet (7,400\u00a0m2) of space in the Las Cimas office complex in unincorporated Travis County, Texas, between Austin and West Lake Hills, to house the company's executive offices and corporate headquarters. 100 senior executives were scheduled to work in the building by the end of 2000.[192] In January 2001, the company leased the space in Las Cimas 2, located along Loop 360. Las Cimas 2 housed Dell's executives, the investment operations, and some corporate functions. Dell also had an option for 138,000 square feet (12,800\u00a0m2) of space in Las Cimas 3.[193] After a slowdown in business required reducing employees and production capacity, Dell decided to sublease its offices in two buildings in the Las Cimas office complex.[194] In 2002 Dell announced that it planned to sublease its space to another tenant; the company planned to move its headquarters back to Round Rock once a tenant was secured.[193] By 2003, Dell moved its headquarters back to Round Rock. It leased all of Las Cimas I and II, with a total of 312,000 square feet (29,000\u00a0m2), for about a seven-year period after 2003. By that year roughly 100,000 square feet (9,300\u00a0m2) of that space was absorbed by new subtenants.[195]\n\n\nIn 2008, Dell switched the power sources of the Round Rock headquarters to more environmentally friendly ones, with 60% of the total power coming from TXU Energy wind farms and 40% coming from the Austin Community Landfill gas-to-energy plant operated by Waste Management, Inc.[181]\n\n\nDell facilities in the United States are located in Austin, Texas; Nashua, New Hampshire; Nashville, Tennessee; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Peoria, Illinois; Hillsboro, Oregon (Portland area); Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Eden Prairie, Minnesota (Dell Compellent); Bowling Green, Kentucky; Lincoln, Nebraska; and Miami, Florida. Facilities located abroad include Penang, Malaysia; Xiamen, China; Bracknell, UK; Manila, Philippines[196] Chennai, India;[197] Hyderabad, India; Noida, India; Hortol\u00e2ndia and Porto Alegre, Brazil; Bratislava, Slovakia; \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland;[198] Panama City, Panama; Dublin and Limerick, Ireland; Casablanca, Morocco and Montpellier, France.\n\n\nThe US and India are the only countries that have all Dell's business functions and provide support globally: research and development, manufacturing, finance, analysis, and customer care.[199]\n\n\n\n### Manufacturing[edit]\n\n\nFrom its early beginnings, Dell operated as a pioneer in the \"configure to order\" approach to manufacturing\u2014delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications. In contrast, most PC manufacturers in those times delivered large orders to intermediaries on a quarterly basis.[200]\n\n\nTo minimize the delay between purchase and delivery, Dell has a general policy of manufacturing its products close to its customers. This also allows for implementing a just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing approach, which minimizes inventory costs. Low inventory is another signature of the Dell business model\u2014a critical consideration in an industry where components depreciate very rapidly.[201]\n\n\nDell's manufacturing process covers assembly, software installation, functional testing (including \"burn-in\"), and quality control. Throughout most of the company's history, Dell manufactured desktop machines in-house and contracted out the manufacturing of base notebooks for configuration in-house.[202] The company's approach has changed, as cited in the 2006 Annual Report, which states, \"We are continuing to expand our use of original design manufacturing partnerships and manufacturing outsourcing relationships.\" *The Wall Street Journal* reported in September 2008 that \"Dell has approached contract computer manufacturers with offers to sell\" their plants.[203] By the late 2000s, Dell's \"configure to order\" approach of manufacturing\u2014delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications from its US facilities was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers as PCs became powerful low-cost commodities.[61]\n\n\nAssembly of desktop computers for the North American market formerly took place at Dell plants in Austin, Texas, (original location) and Lebanon, Tennessee, (opened in 1999), which were closed in 2008 and early 2009, respectively. The plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, opened in 2005 but ceased operations in November 2010.[65][66] Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's US plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's own factories overseas. The Miami, Florida, facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation, while Dell continues to produce its servers (its most profitable products) in Austin, Texas.[61]\n\n\nDell assembled computers for the EMEA market at the Limerick facility in the Republic of Ireland, and once employed about 4,500 people in that country. Dell began manufacturing in Limerick in 1991 and went on to become Ireland's largest exporter of goods and its second-largest company and foreign investor. On January 8, 2009, Dell announced that it would move all Dell manufacturing in Limerick to Dell's new plant in the Polish city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a by January 2010.[204] European Union officials said they would investigate a \u20ac52.7million aid package the Polish government used to attract Dell away from Ireland.[205] European Manufacturing Facility 1 (EMF1, opened in 1990) and EMF3 form part of the Raheen Industrial Estate near Limerick. EMF2 (previously a Wang facility, later occupied by Flextronics, situated in Castletroy) closed in 2002,[*citation needed*] and Dell Inc. has consolidated production into EMF3 (EMF1 now[*when?*] contains only offices).[206] Subsidies from the Polish government did keep Dell for a long time.[207] After ending assembly in the Limerick plant the Cherrywood Technology Campus in Dublin was the largest Dell office in the republic with over 1200 people in sales (mainly UK & Ireland), support (enterprise support for EMEA) and research and development for cloud computing, but no more manufacturing except[208] Dell's Alienware subsidiary, which manufactures PCs in an Athlone, Ireland, plant. Whether this facility will remain in Ireland is not certain.[209] Dell started production at EMF4 in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland, in late 2007.[210]\n\n\nDell moved desktop, notebook and PowerEdge server manufacturing for the South American market from the Eldorado do Sul plant opened in 1999, to a new plant in Hortol\u00e2ndia, Brazil, in 2007.[211]\n\n\n\n## Products[edit]\n\n\n### Scope and brands[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dell's tagline \"Yours is Here\", as seen at their Mall of Asia branch in Pasay, Philippines\nThe corporation markets specific brand names to different market segments.\n\n\nIts Business/Corporate class includes:\n\n\n\n* OptiPlex (office desktop computer systems)\n* Dimension (home desktop computer systems)\n* Vostro (office/small business desktop and notebook systems)\n* n Series (desktop and notebook computers shipped with Linux or FreeDOS installed)\n* Latitude (business-focused notebooks)\n* Precision (workstation systems and high-performance \"Mobile Workstation\" notebooks),[212]\n* PowerEdge (business servers)\n* PowerVault (direct-attach and network-attached storage)\n* Force10 (network switches)\n* PowerConnect (network switches)\n* Dell Compellent (storage area networks)\n* EqualLogic (enterprise class iSCSI SANs)\n* Dell EMR (electronic medical records)\n\n\nDell's Home Office/Consumer class includes:\n\n\n\n* Inspiron (budget desktop and notebook computers)\n* XPS (high-end desktop and notebook computers)\n* G Series (high/medium-performance gaming laptops)\n* Alienware (high-performance gaming systems)\n* Venue (Tablets Android / Windows)\n\n\nDell's Peripherals class includes USB keydrives, LCD televisions, and printers; Dell monitors includes LCD TVs, plasma TVs and projectors for HDTV and monitors. Dell UltraSharp is further a high-end brand of monitors.\n\n\nDell service and support brands include the *Dell Solution Station* (extended domestic support services, previously \"Dell on Call\"), *Dell Support Center* (extended support services abroad), *Dell Business Support* (a commercial service-contract that provides an industry-certified technician with a lower call-volume than in normal queues), *Dell Everdream Desktop Management* (\"Software as a Service\" remote-desktop management, originally a SaaS company founded by Elon Musk's cousin, Lyndon Rive, which Dell bought in 2007[213]), and *Your Tech Team* (a support-queue available to home users who purchased their systems either through Dell's website or through Dell phone-centers).\n\n\nDiscontinued products and brands include Axim (PDA; discontinued April 9, 2007),[214] Dimension (home and small office desktop computers; discontinued July 2007), Dell Digital Jukebox (MP3 player; discontinued August 2006), Dell PowerApp (application-based servers), Dell Optiplex (desktop and tower computers previously supported to run server and desktop operating systems), Dell Unix (an SVR4-based Unix operating system for its Dell-branded PCs and workstations; discontinued in 1993) and Dell Mobile Connect\uff08Windows Mobile application; discontinued July 31st, 2022).[215]\n\n\n\n## Security[edit]\n\n\n### Self-signed root certificate[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2015, it emerged that several Dell computers had shipped with an identical pre-installed root certificate known as \"eDellRoot\".[216] This raised such security risks as attackers impersonating HTTPS-protected websites such as Google and Bank of America and malware being signed with the certificate to bypass Microsoft software filtering.[216] Dell apologized and offered a removal tool.[217]\n\n\n\n### Dell Foundation Services[edit]\n\n\nAlso in November 2015, a researcher discovered that customers with diagnostic program Dell Foundation Services could be digitally tracked using the unique service tag number assigned to them by the program.[218] This was possible even if a customer enabled private browsing and deleted their browser cookies.[218] *Ars Technica* recommended that Dell customers uninstall the program until the issue was addressed.[218]\n\n\n\n## Commercial aspects[edit]\n\n\n### Organization[edit]\n\n\nThe board consists of nine directors. Michael Dell, the founder of the company, serves as chairman of the board and chief executive officer. Other board members include Don Carty, Judy Lewent, Klaus Luft, Alex Mandl, and Sam Nunn. Shareholders elect the nine board members at meetings, and those board members who do not get a majority of votes must submit a resignation to the board, which will subsequently choose whether or not to accept the resignation. The board of directors usually sets up five committees having oversight over specific matters. These committees include the Audit Committee, which handles accounting issues, including auditing and reporting; the Compensation Committee, which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the Finance Committee, which handles financial matters such as proposed mergers and acquisitions; the Governance and Nominating Committee, which handles various corporate matters (including the nomination of the board); and the Antitrust Compliance Committee, which attempts to prevent company practices from violating antitrust laws. [*citation needed*]\n\n\nDay-to-day operations of the company are run by the Global Executive Management Committee, which sets strategic direction. Dell has regional senior vice-presidents for countries other than the United States.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\nDell advertisements have appeared in several types of media including television, the Internet, magazines, catalogs, and newspapers. Some of Dell Inc's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, free bonus products (such as Dell printers), and free shipping to encourage more sales and stave off competitors. In 2006, Dell cut its prices in an effort to maintain its 19.2% market share. This also cut profit margins by more than half, from 8.7 to 4.3 percent. To maintain its low prices, Dell continues to accept most purchases of its products via the Internet and through the telephone network, and to move its customer-care division to India and El Salvador.[219]\n\n\nA popular United States television and print ad campaign in the early 2000s featured the actor Ben Curtis playing the part of \"Steven\", a lightly mischievous blond-haired youth who came to the assistance of bereft computer purchasers. Each television advertisement usually ended with Steven's catch-phrase: \"Dude, you're gettin' a Dell!\"[220]\n\n\nA subsequent advertising campaign featured interns at Dell headquarters (with Curtis' character appearing in a small cameo at the end of one of the first commercials in this particular campaign).\n\n\nIn 2007, Dell switched advertising agencies in the US from BBDO to Working Mother Media. In July 2007, Dell released new advertising created by Working Mother to support the Inspiron and XPS lines. The ads featured music from the Flaming Lips and Devo who re-formed especially to record the song in the ad \"Work it Out\". Also in 2007, Dell began using the slogan \"Yours is here\" to say that it customizes computers to fit customers' requirements.[221]\n\n\nBeginning in 2011, Dell began hosting a conference in Austin, Texas, at the Austin Convention Center titled \"Dell World\". The event featured new technology and services provided by Dell and Dell's partners. In 2011, the event was held October 12\u201314.[222] In 2012, the event was held December 11\u201313.[223] In 2013, the event was held December 11\u201313.[224] In 2014, the event was held November 4\u20136.[225]\n\n\n\n#### Dell partner program[edit]\n\n\nIn late 2007, Dell Inc. announced that it planned to expand its program to value-added resellers (VARs), giving it the official name of \"Dell Partner Direct\" and a new Website.[226]\n\n\nDell India has started Online Ecommerce website[227] with its Dell Partner www.compuindia.com GNG Electronics Pvt Ltd[228] termed as Dell Express Ship Affiliate(DESA).\nThe main objective was to reduce the delivery time. Customers who visit Dell India official site are given the option to buy online which then will be redirected to Dell affiliate website compuindia.com.[199]\n\n\n\n#### Global analytics[edit]\n\n\nDell also operates a captive analytics division which supports pricing, web analytics, and supply chain operations. DGA operates as a single, centralized entity with a global view of Dell's business activities. The firm supports over 500 internal customers worldwide and has created a quantified impact of over $500 million.[*citation needed*][229]\n\n\n\n#### Criticisms of marketing of laptop security[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Dell received press coverage over its claim of having the world's most secure laptops, specifically, its Latitude D630 and Latitude D830.[230] At Lenovo's request, the (US) National Advertising Division (NAD) evaluated the claim, and reported that Dell did not have enough evidence to support it.[231]\n\n\n\n### Retail[edit]\n\n\nDell first opened their retail stores in India.[199]\n\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Dell sold its products through Best Buy, Costco and Sam's Club stores in the United States. Dell stopped this practice in 1994, citing low profit margins on the business, exclusively distributing through a direct-sales model for the next decade. In 2003, Dell briefly sold products in Sears stores in the US. In 2007, Dell started shipping its products to major retailers in the US once again, starting with Sam's Club and Wal-Mart. Staples, the largest office-supply retailer in the US, and Best Buy, the largest electronics retailer in the US, became Dell retail partners later that same year.\n\n\n\n##### Kiosks[edit]\n\n\nStarting in 2002, Dell opened kiosk locations in the United States to allow customers to examine products before buying them directly from the company. Starting in 2005, Dell expanded kiosk locations to include shopping malls across Australia, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong. On January 30, 2008, Dell announced it would shut down all 140 kiosks in the US due to expansion into retail stores.[232] By June 3, 2010, Dell had also shut down all of its mall kiosks in Australia.[233]\n\n\n\n#### Retail stores[edit]\n\n\nAs of the end of February 2008[update], Dell products shipped to one of the largest office supply retailers in Canada, Staples Business Depot. In April 2008, Future Shop and Best Buy began carrying a subset of Dell products, such as certain desktops, laptops, printers, and monitors.\n\n\nSince some shoppers in certain markets show reluctance to purchase technological products through the phone or the Internet, Dell has looked into opening retail operations in some countries in Central Europe and Russia. In April 2007, Dell opened a retail store in Budapest. In October of the same year, Dell opened a retail store in Moscow.\n\n\nIn the UK, HMV's flagship Trocadero store has sold Dell XPS PCs since December 2007. From January 2008 the UK stores of DSGi have sold Dell products (in particular, through Currys and PC World stores). As of 2008, the large supermarket chain Tesco has sold Dell laptops and desktops in outlets throughout the UK.\n\n\nIn May 2008, Dell reached an agreement with the office supply chain, Officeworks (part of Coles Group), to stock a few modified models in the Inspiron desktop and notebook range. These models have slightly different model numbers, but almost replicate the ones available from the Dell Store. Dell continued its retail push in the Australian market with its partnership with Harris Technology (another part of Coles Group) in November of the same year. In addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with the discount electrical retailer, The Good Guys, known for \"Slashing Prices\". Dell agreed to distribute a variety of makes of both desktops and notebooks, including Studio and XPS systems in late 2008. Dell and Dick Smith Electronics (owned by Woolworths Limited) reached an agreement to expand within Dick Smith's 400 stores throughout Australia and New Zealand in May 2009 (1 year since Officeworks\u2014owned by Coles Group\u2014reached a deal). The retailer has agreed to distribute a variety of Inspiron and Studio notebooks, with minimal Studio desktops from the Dell range. As of 2009[update], Dell continues to run and operate its various kiosks in 18 shopping centers throughout Australia. On March 31, 2010, Dell announced to Australian Kiosk employees that they were shutting down the Australian/New Zealand Dell kiosk program.\n\n\nIn Germany, Dell is selling selected smartphones and notebooks via Media Markt and Saturn, as well as some shopping websites.[234]\n\n\n\n### Competition[edit]\n\n\nDell's major competitors include Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard (HP), Hasee, Acer, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Gateway, Sony, Asus, MSI, Panasonic, Samsung and Apple. Dell and its subsidiary, Alienware, compete in the enthusiast market against AVADirect, Falcon Northwest, VoodooPC (a subsidiary of HP), and other manufacturers. In the second quarter of 2006, Dell had between 18% and 19% share of the worldwide personal computer market, compared to HP with roughly 15%.\n\n\nIn late 2006[update], Dell lost its lead in the PC business to Hewlett-Packard. Both Gartner and IDC estimated that in the third quarter of 2006, HP shipped more units[235] worldwide than Dell did. Dell's 3.6% growth paled in comparison to HP's 15% growth during the same period. The problem got worse in the fourth quarter, when Gartner estimated[236] that Dell PC shipments declined 8.9% (versus HP's 23.9% growth). As a result, at the end of 2006 Dell's overall PC market share stood at 13.9% (versus HP's 17.4%).\n\n\nIDC reported that Dell lost more server market share than any of the top four competitors in that arena. IDC's Q4 2006 estimates show Dell's share of the server market at 8.1%, down from 9.5% in the previous year. This represents an 8.8% loss year-over-year, primarily to competitors EMC and IBM. As of 2021, Dell is the third-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo and HP.[237]\n\n\n\n### Partnership with EMC[edit]\n\n\nIn 2001, Dell and EMC entered into a partnership whereby both companies jointly design products, and Dell provided support for certain EMC products including midrange storage systems, such as fibre channel and iSCSI storage area networks. The relationship also promotes and sells OEM versions of backup, recovery, replication and archiving software.[238] On December 9, 2008, Dell and EMC announced the multi-year extension, through 2013, of the strategic partnership with EMC. In addition, Dell expanded its product lineup by adding the EMC Celerra NX4 storage system to the portfolio of Dell/EMC family of networked storage systems and partnered on a new line of data deduplication products as part of its TierDisk family of data storage devices.[239]\n\n\nOn October 17, 2011, Dell discontinued reselling all EMC storage products, ending the partnership 2 years early.[240][241] Later Dell would acquire and merge with EMC in the largest tech merger to date.\n\n\n\n## Environmental record[edit]\n\n\nDell committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from its global activities by 40% by 2015, with the 2008 fiscal year as the baseline year.[242] It is listed in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics that scores leading electronics manufacturers according to their policies on sustainability, climate and energy and how green their products are. In November 2011, Dell ranked 2nd out of 15 listed electronics makers (increasing its score to 5.1 from 4.9, which it gained in the previous ranking from October 2010).[243]\n\n\nDell was the first company to publicly state a timeline for the elimination of toxic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs), which it planned to phase out by the end of 2009. It revised this commitment and now aims to remove toxics by the end of 2011 but only in its computing products.[244]\nIn March 2010, Greenpeace activists protested at Dell offices in Bangalore, Amsterdam and Copenhagen calling for Dell's founder and CEO Michael Dell to \"drop the toxics\" and claiming that Dell's aspiration to be 'the greenest technology company on the planet'[245] was \"hypocritical\".[246] Dell has launched its first products completely free of PVC and BFRs with the G-Series monitors (G2210 and G2410) in 2009.[247]\n\n\nIn its 2012 report on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated Dell the eighth-highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.[248]\n\n\n\n### Green initiatives[edit]\n\n\nDell became the first company in the information technology industry to establish a product-recycling goal (in 2004) and completed the implementation of its global consumer recycling-program in 2006.[249]\nOn February 6, 2007, the National Recycling Coalition awarded Dell its \"Recycling Works\" award for efforts to promote producer responsibility.[250]\nOn July 19, 2007, Dell announced that it had exceeded targets in working to achieve a multi-year goal of recovering 275 million pounds of computer equipment by 2009. The company reported the recovery of 78 million pounds (nearly 40,000 tons) of IT equipment from customers in 2006, a 93-percent increase over 2005; and 12.4% of the equipment Dell sold seven years earlier.[251]\n\n\nOn June 5, 2007, Dell set a goal of becoming the greenest technology company on Earth for the long term.[252] The company launched a zero-carbon initiative that includes:\n\n\n\n1. reducing Dell's carbon intensity by 15 percent by 2012\n2. requiring primary suppliers to report carbon emissions data during quarterly business reviews\n3. partnering with customers to build the \"greenest PC on the planet\"\n4. expanding the company's carbon-offsetting program, \"Plant a Tree for Me\"\n\n\nDell reports its environmental performance in an annual Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report that follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) protocol. Dell's 2008 CSR report ranked as \"Application Level B\" as \"checked by GRI\".[253]\n\n\nThe company aims to reduce its external environmental impact through an energy-efficient evolution of products, and also reduce its direct operational impact through energy-efficiency programs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lawsuits involving Dell Inc.\n\nIn the 1990s, Dell switched from using primarily ATX motherboards and PSU to using boards and power supplies with mechanically identical but differently wired connectors. This meant customers wishing to upgrade their hardware would have to replace parts with scarce Dell-compatible parts instead of commonly available parts. While motherboard power connections reverted to the industry standard in 2003, Dell remains secretive about their motherboard pin-outs for peripherals (such as MMC readers and power on/off switches and LEDs).[254][255]\n\n\nIn 2005, complaints about Dell more than doubled to 1,533, after earnings grew 52% that year.[256]\n\n\nIn 2006, Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer service. Issues included call transfers[257]\nof more than 45% of calls and long wait times. Dell's blog detailed the response: \"We're spending more than a $100\u00a0million\u2014and a lot of blood, sweat, and tears of talented people\u2014to fix this.\"[258] Later in the year, the company increased its spending on customer service to $150\u00a0million.[259] Since 2018, Dell has seen significant increase in consumer satisfaction. Moreover, their customer service has been praised for its prompt and accurate answers to most questions, especially those directed to their social media support.[260][261]\n\n\nOn August 17, 2007, Dell Inc. announced that after an internal investigation into its accounting practices it would restate and reduce earnings from 2003 through to the first quarter of 2007 by a total amount of between $50\u00a0million and $150\u00a0million, or 2 cents to 7 cents per share.[262] The investigation, begun in November 2006, resulted from concerns raised by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted.[263] It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer AMD. In 2010 Dell finally paid $100\u00a0million (equivalent to $136,400,000 in 2023) to settle the SEC's charges of fraud. Michael Dell and other executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions, without admitting or denying the charges.[264]\n\n\nIn July 2009, Dell apologized after drawing the ire of the Taiwanese Consumer Protection Commission for twice refusing to honor a flood of orders against unusually low prices offered on its Taiwanese website. In the first instance, Dell offered a 19\" LCD panel for $15. In the second instance, Dell offered its Latitude E4300 notebook at NT$18,558 (US$580), 70% lower than the usual price of NT$60,900 (US$1900). Concerning the E4300, rather than honor the discount taking a significant loss, the firm withdrew orders and offered a voucher of up to NT$20,000 (US$625) a customer in compensation. The consumer rights authorities in Taiwan fined Dell NT$1\u00a0million (US$31250) for customer rights infringements. Many consumers sued the firm for unfair compensation. A court in southern Taiwan ordered the firm to deliver 18 laptops and 76 flat-panel monitors to 31 consumers for NT$490,000 (US$15,120), less than a third of the normal price.[265] The court said the event could hardly be regarded as mistakes, as the prestigious firm said the company mispriced its products twice in Taiwanese website within 3 weeks.[266]\n\n\nAfter Michael Dell made a $24.4 billion buyout bid in August 2013 (equivalent to $31,470,000,000 in 2023), activist shareholder Carl Icahn sued the company and its board in an attempt to derail the bid and promote his own forthcoming offer.[267]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute accused at least 82 major brands, including BYD, of being connected to forced Uyghur labor in Xinjiang.[268]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* List of computer system manufacturers\n* List of Dell ownership activities\n* Configurator\n* Mass customization\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Dell Company Profile\".

As of March\u00a02023[update], Apple is the world's biggest company by market capitalization,[6] and with US$394.3 billion the largest technology company by 2022 revenue.[7] As of June 2022[update], Apple is the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales; the largest manufacturing company by revenue; and the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world. It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\n\nApple was founded as **Apple Computer Company** on April 1, 1976, by Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as **Apple Computer, Inc.** in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called \"1984\". By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\n\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as \"Wintel\"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\n\n\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1\u00a0trillion in August 2018, then at $2\u00a0trillion in August 2020, and at $3\u00a0trillion in January 2022. In June 2023, it was valued at just over $3\u00a0trillion.[8] The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty. It has also been consistently ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Apple Inc.\n\n### 1976\u20131980: Founding and incorporation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Apple Inc. \u00a7\u00a01971\u20131985: Jobs and Wozniak\n\n![](image)In 1976, Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in his parents' home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California.[9] Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak called the popular belief that the company was founded in the garage \"a bit of a myth\".[10] They moved some operations to the garage when the bedroom became too crowded.[11]\n![](image)The Apple I is Apple's first product, designed by Steve Wozniak and sold as an assembled circuit board without basic features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case. This unit received an aftermarket keyboard and a wooden case.\n![](image)The Apple II Plus was introduced in 1979, designed primarily by Wozniak.\nApple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership.[9][12] The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[13] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator.[14]:\u200a57 Neither received the full selling price but in total earned $1,300 (equivalent to $7,000 in 2023). Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.[15] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips\u2014a base kit concept which would not yet be marketed as a complete personal computer.[16] It went on sale soon after debut for $666.66 (equivalent to $3,600 in 2023).[17][18]:\u200a180 Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked \"repeating digits\".[19]\n\n\nApple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,[20][21] without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded it.[22] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 (equivalent to $1,257,000 in 2023) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.[23] During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.[24]\n\n\nThe Apple II, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire.[25] It differed from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture. While the Apple I and early Apple II models used ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5+1\u20444-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978.[26][27]\n\n\nThe Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first \"killer application\" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program released in 1979.[26] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office,[26] but Apple II market share remained behind home computers made by competitors such as Atari, Commodore, and Tandy.[28][29]\n\n\nOn December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol \"AAPL\") went public selling 4.6\u00a0million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September\u00a03, 2022[update]),[21] generating over $100\u00a0million, which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956.[30] By the end of the day, 300\u00a0millionaires were created, from a stock price of $29 per share[31] and a market cap of $1.778\u00a0billion.[30][31]\n\n\n\n### 1980\u20131990: Success with Macintosh[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Mac models and Timeline of the Apple II family\n\n![](image)The Macintosh, released in 1984, is the first mass-market personal computer to feature an integral graphical user interface and mouse.\nA critical moment in the company's history came in December 1979 when Jobs and several Apple employees, including human\u2013computer interface expert Jef Raskin, visited Xerox PARC in to see a demonstration of the Xerox Alto, a computer using a graphical user interface. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000[32] shares (22.4\u00a0million split-adjusted shares as of September\u00a03, 2022[update])[21] of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.[33] After the demonstration, Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface, and development of a GUI began for the Apple Lisa, named after Jobs's daughter.[34]\n\n\nThe Lisa division was plagued by infighting, and in 1982, Jobs was pushed off the project. The Lisa launched in 1983 and became the first mass marketed personal computer with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price and limited software library.[35]\n\n\nJobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's Macintosh division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low-cost computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division.[36] Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division, which at the time, generated most of the company's revenue.[37]\n\n\nIn 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer without a bundled programming language.[38] Its debut was signified by \"1984\", a $1.5 million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984.[39] This was hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success[40] and was called a \"masterpiece\" by CNN[41] and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by *TV Guide*.[42]\n\n\nThe advertisement created great interest in Macintosh, and sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in. Jobs had required 128 kilobytes of RAM, which limited its speed and software in favor of aspiring for a projected price point of $1,000 (equivalent to $2,900 in 2023). The Macintosh shipped for $2,495 (equivalent to $7,300 in 2023), a price panned by critics due to its slow performance.[43]:\u200a195 In early 1985, this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired away from Pepsi two years earlier by Jobs[44] saying, \"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?\"[45] Sculley removed Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division, with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.[46]\n\n\nThe board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from leadership.[47] Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e informed Sculley that Jobs had been attempting to organize a boardroom coup and called an emergency meeting at which Apple's executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties.[47] Jobs resigned from Apple in September 1985 and took several Apple employees with him to found NeXT.[48] Wozniak had also quit his active employment at Apple earlier in 1985 to pursue other ventures, expressing his frustration with Apple's treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had \"been going in the wrong direction for the last five years\".[37][49][50] Wozniak remained employed by Apple as a representative,[49] receiving a stipend estimated to be $120,000 per year.[18] Jobs and Wozniak remained Apple shareholders after their departures.[51]\n\n\nAfter the departures of Jobs and Wozniak in 1985, Sculley launched the Macintosh 512K that year with quadruple the RAM, and introduced the LaserWriter, the first reasonably priced PostScript laser printer. PageMaker, an early desktop publishing application taking advantage of the PostScript language, was also released by Aldus Corporation in July 1985.[52] It has been suggested that the combination of Macintosh, LaserWriter, and PageMaker was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.[53]\n\n\nThis dominant position in the desktop publishing market[54] allowed the company to focus on higher price points, the so-called \"high-right policy\" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin, and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in speed. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, due to Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e's slogan of \"fifty-five or die\", referring to the 55% profit margins of the Macintosh II.[55]:\u200a79\u201380\n\n\nThis policy began to backfire late in the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on IBM PC compatibles that offered some of the same functionality of the Macintosh at far lower price points. The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.[55]:\u200a117\u2013129 During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gass\u00e9e deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gass\u00e9e in January 1990 by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer.[56] Gass\u00e9e left the company later that year.[57]\n\n\n\n### 1990\u20131997: Decline and restructuring[edit]\n\n\nThe company pivoted strategy and in October 1990 introduced three lower-cost models, the Macintosh Classic, the Macintosh LC, and the Macintosh IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand.[58] In 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system, adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.\n\n\n\nThe success of the lower-cost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue.[59] For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine *MacAddict* named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the \"first golden age\" of the Macintosh.[60]\n\n![](image)The PenLite is Apple's first tablet computer prototype, created in 1992 to bring the Mac OS to a tablet. It was canceled in favor of the Newton.[61]\nThe success of Apple's lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to the cannibalization of higher-priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points, aimed at different markets: the high-end Quadra series, the mid-range Centris series, and the consumer-marketed Performa series. This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between so many models.[62]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Apple II series was discontinued, which was expensive to produce, and the company decided was still taking sales away from lower-cost Macintosh models. After the launch of the LC, Apple began encouraging developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorized salespersons to direct consumers away from Apple II and toward Macintosh.[63] The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993.[64]\n\n\nApple also experimented with several other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including digital cameras, portable CD audio players, speakers, video game consoles, the eWorld online service, and TV appliances. Enormous resources were invested in the problem-plagued Newton tablet division, based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.[65]\n\n\nThroughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.[66] Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; instead, they sued Microsoft for using a GUI similar to the Apple Lisa in *Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.*[67] The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed.\n\n\nThe major product flops and the rapid loss of market share to Windows sullied Apple's reputation, and in 1993 Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler.[68]\n\n\nWith Spindler at the helm, Apple, IBM, and Motorola formed the AIM alliance in 1994 with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the PowerPC Reference Platform; PReP), which used IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows. That year, Apple introduced the Power Macintosh, the first of many computers with Motorola's PowerPC processor.[69]\n\n\nIn the wake of the alliance, Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build Macintosh clones. Over the next two years, 75 distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced. However, by 1996, Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of their own high-end computers, where profit margins were highest.[70]\n\n\nIn 1996, Spindler was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO. Hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator, Amelio made deep changes, including extensive layoffs and cost-cutting.[71]\n\n\nThis period was also marked by numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system (MacOS). The original Macintosh operating system (System 1) was not built for multitasking (running several applications at once). The company attempted to correct this with by introducing cooperative multitasking in System 5, but the company still felt it needed a more modern approach.[72] This led to the Pink project in 1988, A/UX that same year, Copland in 1994, and the attempted purchase of BeOS in 1996. Talks with Be stalled when the CEO, former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e, demanded $300 million instead of the $125 million Apple wanted to pay.[73]\n\n\nOnly weeks away from bankruptcy,[74] Apple's board decided NeXTSTEP was a better choice for its next operating system and purchased NeXT in late 1996 for $400 million, bringing back Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.[75]\n\n\n\n### 1997\u20132007: Return to profitability[edit]\n\n\nThe NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9, 1997,[76] and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio's resignation after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses.\n\n\nThe board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately began a review of the company's products. Jobs would order 70% of the company's products to be cancelled, resulting in the loss of 3,000 jobs, and taking Apple back to the core of its computer offerings.[77] The next month, in August 1997, Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a $150\u00a0million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing software for the Mac.[78] The investment was seen as an \"antitrust insurance policy\" for Microsoft who had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti-competitive practices.[79] Jobs also ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997, purchased the largest clone maker, Power Computing.[80] On November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the Apple Store website, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing that had been successfully used by PC manufacturer Dell.[81]\n\n\nThe moves paid off for Jobs; at the end of his first year as CEO, the company turned a $309 million profit.[77]\n\n\n\n![](image)\niMac\n![](image)\niBook\n![](image)\nPower Macintosh G3\n![](image)\nPowerBook G3\n\nOn May 6, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh: the iMac. The iMac was a huge success for Apple selling 800,000 units in its first five months[82] and ushered in major shifts in the industry by abandoning legacy technologies like the 3+1\u20442-inch diskette, being an early adopter of the USB connector, and coming pre-installed with internet connectivity (the \"i\" in iMac)[83] via Ethernet and a dial-up modem. The device also had a striking teardrop shape and translucent materials, designed by Jonathan Ive, who although hired by Amelio, would go on to work collaboratively with Jobs for the next decade to chart a new course the design of Apple's products.[84][85]\n\n\nA little more than a year later on July 21, 1999, Apple introduced the iBook, a laptop for consumers. It was the culmination of a strategy established by Jobs to produce only four products: refined versions of the Power Macintosh G3 desktop and PowerBook G3 laptop for professionals, along with the iMac desktop and iBook laptop for consumers. Jobs felt the small product line allowed for a greater focus on quality and innovation.[86]\n\n\nAt around the same time, Apple also completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital media production software for both professionals and consumers. Apple acquired of Macromedia's Key Grip digital video editing software project which was renamed Final Cut Pro when it was launched on the retail market in April 1999.[87] The development of Key Grip also led to Apple's release of the consumer video-editing product iMovie in October 1999.[88] Next, Apple successfully acquired the German company Astarte in April 2000, which had developed the DVD authoring software DVDirector, which Apple would sell as the professional-oriented DVD Studio Pro software product, and used the same technology to create iDVD for the consumer market.[88] In 2000, Apple purchased the SoundJam MP audio player software from Casady & Greene. Apple renamed the program iTunes, while simplifying the user interface and adding the ability to burn CDs.[89]\n\n\n2001 would be a pivotal year for the Apple with the company making three announcements that would change the course of the company.\n\n\nThe first announcement came on March 24, 2001, that Apple was nearly ready to release a new modern operating system, Mac OS X. The announcement came after numerous failed attempts in the early 1990s, and several years of development. Mac OS X was based on NeXTSTEP, OPENSTEP, and BSD Unix, with Apple aiming to combine the stability, reliability, and security of Unix with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface, heavily influenced by NeXTSTEP. To aid users in migrating from Mac OS 9, the new operating system allowed the use of OS 9 applications within Mac OS X via the Classic Environment.[90]\n\n\nIn May 2001, the company opened its first two Apple Store retail locations in Virginia and California,[91][92] offering an improved presentation of the company's products.[93] At the time, many speculated that the stores would fail,[94] but they went on to become highly successful, and the first of more than 500 stores around the world.[95]\n\n\nOn October 23, 2001, Apple debuted the iPod portable digital audio player. The product, which was first sold on November 10, 2001, was phenomenally successful with over 100\u00a0million units sold within six years.[96]\n\n\nIn 2003, Apple's iTunes Store was introduced. The service offered music downloads for 99\u00a2 a song and integration with the iPod. The iTunes Store quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over five billion downloads by June 19, 2008.[97] Two years later, the iTunes Store was the world's largest music retailer.[98]\n\n\nIn 2002, Apple purchased Nothing Real for their advanced digital compositing application Shake,[99] as well as Emagic for the music productivity application Logic. The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company. The acquisition was followed by the development of Apple's consumer-level GarageBand application.[100] The release of iPhoto that year completed the iLife suite.[101]\n\n\n\n![](image)The MacBook Pro is Apple's first laptop with an Intel microprocessor, introduced in 2006.\nAt the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would move away from PowerPC processors, and the Mac would transition to Intel processors in 2006.[102] On January 10, 2006, the new MacBook Pro and iMac became the first Apple computers to use Intel's Core Duo CPU. By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line\u2014over one year sooner than announced.[102] The Power Mac, iBook, and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the Mac Pro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro became their respective successors.[103] On April 29, 2009, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple was building its own team of engineers to design microchips.[104] Apple also introduced Boot Camp in 2006 to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.[105]\n\n\nApple's success during this period was evident in its stock price. Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple's stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80.[106] When Apple surpassed Dell's market cap in January 2006,[107] Jobs sent an email to Apple employees saying Dell's CEO Michael Dell should eat his words.[108] Nine years prior, Dell had said that if he ran Apple he would \"shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders\".[109]\n\n\n\n### 2007\u20132011: Success with mobile devices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The newly announced iPhone was on display at the 2007 MacWorld Expo.\nDuring his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced the renaming of Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple Inc., because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics.[110] This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone[111] and the Apple TV.[112] The company sold 270,000 iPhone units during the first 30 hours of sales,[113] and the device was called \"a game changer for the industry\".[114]\n\n\nIn an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without digital rights management (DRM), thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players if record labels would agree to drop the technology.[115] On April 2, 2007, Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.[116] Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce that all songs on the iTunes Store are available without their FairPlay DRM.[117]\n\n\nIn July 2008, Apple launched the App Store to sell third-party applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch.[118] Within a month, the store sold 60\u00a0million applications and registered an average daily revenue of $1\u00a0million, with Jobs speculating in August 2008 that the App Store could become a billion-dollar business for Apple.[119] By October 2008, Apple was the third-largest mobile handset supplier in the world due to the popularity of the iPhone.[120]\n\n\nOn January 14, 2009, Jobs announced in an internal memo that he would be taking a six-month medical leave of absence from Apple until the end of June 2009 and would spend the time focusing on his health. In the email, Jobs stated that \"the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well\", and explained that the break would allow the company \"to focus on delivering extraordinary products\".[121] Though Jobs was absent, Apple recorded its best non-holiday quarter (Q1 FY 2009) during the recession with revenue of $8.16\u00a0billion and profit of $1.21\u00a0billion.[122]\n\n\nAfter years of speculation and multiple rumored \"leaks\", Apple unveiled a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the iPad on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and all iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, though having very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the U.S. It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week.[123] In May of the same year, Apple's market cap exceeded that of competitor Microsoft for the first time since 1989.[124]\n\n\nIn June 2010, Apple released the iPhone 4,[125] which introduced video calling using FaceTime, multitasking, and a new uninsulated stainless steel design that acted as the phone's antenna. Later that year, Apple again refreshed its iPod line of MP3 players by introducing a multi-touch iPod Nano, an iPod Touch with FaceTime, and an iPod Shuffle that brought back the clickwheel buttons of earlier generations.[126] It also introduced the smaller, cheaper second generation Apple TV which allowed renting of movies and shows.[127]\n\n\nOn January 17, 2011, Jobs announced in an internal Apple memo that he would take another medical leave of absence for an indefinite period to allow him to focus on his health. Chief operating officer Tim Cook assumed Jobs's day-to-day operations at Apple, although Jobs would still remain \"involved in major strategic decisions\".[128] Apple became the most valuable consumer-facing brand in the world.[129] In June 2011, Jobs surprisingly took the stage and unveiled iCloud, an online storage and syncing service for music, photos, files, and software which replaced MobileMe, Apple's previous attempt at content syncing.[130] This would be the last product launch Jobs would attend before his death.\n\n\nOn August 24, 2011, Jobs resigned his position as CEO of Apple.[131] He was replaced by Cook and Jobs became Apple's chairman. Apple did not have a chairman at the time[132] and instead had two co-lead directors, Andrea Jung and Arthur D. Levinson,[133] who continued with those titles until Levinson replaced Jobs as chairman of the board in November after Jobs' death.[134]\n\n\n\n### 2011\u2013present: Post-Jobs era, Tim Cook[edit]\n\n\nOn October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs died, marking the end of an era for Apple.[135] The next major product announcement by Apple was on January 19, 2012, when Apple's Phil Schiller introduced iBook's Textbooks for iOS and iBook Author for Mac OS X in New York City.[136] Jobs stated in the biography \"Steve Jobs\" that he wanted to reinvent the textbook industry and education.[137]\n\n\nFrom 2011 to 2012, Apple released the iPhone 4S[138] and iPhone 5,[139] which featured improved cameras, an intelligent software assistant named Siri, and cloud-synced data with iCloud; the third- and fourth-generation iPads, which featured Retina displays;[140][141] and the iPad Mini, which featured a 7.9-inch screen in contrast to the iPad's 9.7-inch screen.[142] These launches were successful, with the iPhone 5 (released September 21, 2012) becoming Apple's biggest iPhone launch with over two million pre-orders[143] and sales of three million iPads in three days following the launch of the iPad Mini and fourth-generation iPad (released November 3, 2012).[144] Apple also released a third-generation 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display and new iMac and Mac Mini computers.[141][142][145]\n\n\nOn August 20, 2012, Apple's rising stock price increased the company's market capitalization to a then-record $624\u00a0billion. This beat the non-inflation-adjusted record for market capitalization previously set by Microsoft in 1999.[146] On August 24, 2012, a US jury ruled that Samsung should pay Apple $1.05\u00a0billion (\u00a3665m) in damages in an intellectual property lawsuit.[147] Samsung appealed the damages award, which was reduced by $450\u00a0million[148] and further granted Samsung's request for a new trial.[148] On November 10, 2012, Apple confirmed a global settlement that dismissed all existing lawsuits between Apple and HTC up to that date, in favor of a ten-year license agreement for current and future patents between the two companies.[149] It is predicted that Apple will make $280 million per year from this deal with HTC.[150]\n\n\nIn May 2014, the company confirmed its intent to acquire Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine's audio company Beats Electronics\u2014producer of the \"Beats by Dr. Dre\" line of headphones and speaker products, and operator of the music streaming service Beats Music\u2014for $3 billion, and to sell their products through Apple's retail outlets and resellers. Iovine believed that Beats had always \"belonged\" with Apple, as the company modeled itself after Apple's \"unmatched ability to marry culture and technology.\" The acquisition was the largest purchase in Apple's history.[151]\n\n\n\n![](image)Apple Watch first generation (2015)\nDuring a press event on September 9, 2014, Apple introduced a smartwatch, the Apple Watch.[152] Initially, Apple marketed the device as a fashion accessory[153] and a complement to the iPhone, that would allow people to look at their smartphones less.[154] Over time, the company has focused on developing health and fitness-oriented features on the watch, in an effort to compete with dedicated activity trackers.\n\n\nIn January 2016, it was announced that one billion Apple devices were in active use worldwide.[155]\n\n\nOn June 6, 2016, *Fortune* released Fortune 500, its list of companies ranked on revenue generation. In the trailing fiscal year of 2015, Apple was listed as the top tech company.[156] It ranked third, overall, with $233 billion in revenue.[156] This represents a movement upward of two spots from the previous year's list.[156]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Apple announced the HomePod, its smart speaker aimed to compete against Sonos, Google Home, and Amazon Echo.[157] Towards the end of the year, *TechCrunch* reported that Apple was acquiring Shazam, a company that introduced its products at WWDC and specializing in music, TV, film and advertising recognition.[158] The acquisition was confirmed a few days later, reportedly costing Apple $400 million, with media reports that the purchase looked like a move to acquire data and tools bolstering the Apple Music streaming service.[159] The purchase was approved by the European Union in September 2018.[160]\n\n\nAlso in June 2017, Apple appointed Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg to head the newly formed worldwide video unit. In November 2017, Apple announced it was branching out into original scripted programming: a drama series starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, and a reboot of the anthology series Amazing Stories with Steven Spielberg.[161] In June 2018, Apple signed the Writers Guild of America's minimum basic agreement and Oprah Winfrey to a multi-year content partnership.[162] Additional partnerships for original series include Sesame Workshop and DHX Media and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide, as well as a partnership with A24 to create original films.[163]\n\n\nDuring the Apple Special Event in September 2017, the AirPower wireless charger was announced alongside the iPhone X, 8 and Watch Series 3. The AirPower was intended to wirelessly charge multiple devices, simultaneously. Though initially set to release in early 2018, the AirPower would be canceled in March 2019, marking the first cancellation of a device under Cook's leadership.[164]\n\n\nOn August 19, 2020, Apple's share price briefly topped $467.77, making it the first US company with a market capitalization of $2 trillion.[165]\n\n\n\n![](image)MacBook Air M1 (2020)\nDuring its annual WWDC keynote speech on June 22, 2020, Apple announced it would move away from Intel processors, and the Mac would transition to processors developed in-house.[166] The announcement was expected by industry analysts, and it has been noted that Macs featuring Apple's processors would allow for big increases in performance over current Intel-based models.[167] On November 10, 2020, the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and the Mac Mini became the first Mac devices powered by an Apple-designed processor, the Apple M1.[168]\n\n\nIn April 2022, it was reported that Samsung Electro-Mechanics would be collaborating with Apple on its M2 chip instead of LG Innotek.[169] Developer logs showed that at least nine Mac models with four different M2 chips were being tested.[170]\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that an effort to develop its own chips left Apple better prepared to deal with the semiconductor shortage that emerged during the pandemic era and led to increased profitability, with sales of Mac computers that included M1 chips rising sharply in 2020 and 2021. It also inspired other companies like Tesla, Amazon, and Meta Platforms to pursue a similar path.[171]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Apple opened an online store that allowed anyone in the US to view repair manuals and order replacement parts for specific recent iPhones, although the difference in cost between this method and official repair is anticipated to be minimal.[172]\n\n\nIn May 2022, a trademark was filed for RealityOS, an operating system reportedly intended for virtual and augmented reality headsets, first mentioned in 2017. According to Bloomberg, the headset may come out in 2023.[173] Further insider reports state that the device uses iris scanning for payment confirmation and signing into accounts.[174]\n\n\nOn June 18, 2022, the Apple Store in Towson, Maryland became the first to unionize in the U.S., with the employees voting to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.[175]\n\n\nOn July 7, 2022, Apple added Lockdown Mode to macOS 13 and iOS 16, as a response to the earlier Pegasus revelations; the mode increases security protections for high-risk users against targeted zero-day malware.[176]\n\n\nApple launched a buy now, pay later service called 'Apple Pay Later' for its Apple Wallet users in March 2023. The program allows its users to apply for loans between $50 and $1,000 to make online or in-app purchases and then repaying them through four installments spread over six weeks without any interest or fees.[177][178]\n\n\n\n## Products[edit]\n\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Apple Inc. products.\n\n### Mac[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac (computer)\n![A MacBook Air, in midnight color, on a wooden desk.](image)\nMacBook Air with M2 chip\n![An thin iMac in blue color on a desk.](image)\niMac with M1 chip\n\nThe Mac is Apple's family of personal computers. Macs are known for their ease of use[179] and distinctive aluminium, minimalist designs. Macs have been popular among students, creative professionals, and software engineers. The current lineup consists of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops, and the iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio and Mac Pro desktop computers.\n\n\nOften described as a walled garden, Macs use Apple silicon chips, run the macOS operating system, and include Apple software like the Safari web browser, iMovie for home movie editing, GarageBand for music creation, and the iWork productivity suite. Apple also sells pro apps: Final Cut Pro for video production, Logic Pro for musicians and producers, and Xcode for software developers.\n\n\nApple also sells a variety of accessories for Macs, including the Pro Display XDR, Apple Studio Display, Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard.\n\n\n\n### iPhone[edit]\n\n\nMain article: iPhone\n\n![An iPhone 14 Pro with Chinese user interface, held by a customer, screen facing the camera](image)iPhone 14 Pro\nThe iPhone is Apple's line of smartphones, which run the iOS operating system. The first iPhone was unveiled by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, new models have been released annually. When it was introduced, its multi-touch screen was described as \"revolutionary\" and a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry. The device has been credited with creating the app economy.\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the iPhone has 15% market share, yet represents 50% of global smartphone revenues, with Android phones accounting for the rest.[180][181] The iPhone has generated large profits for the company, and is credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies.[182]\n\n\n\n### iPad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: iPad\n\nThe iPad is Apple's line of tablets which run iPadOS. The first-generation iPad was announced on January 27, 2010. The iPad is mainly marketed for consuming multimedia, creating art, working on documents, videoconferencing, and playing games. The iPad lineup consists of several base iPad models, and the smaller iPad Mini, upgraded iPad Air, and high-end iPad Pro. Apple has consistently improved the iPad's performance, with the iPad Pro adopting the same M1 and M2 chips as the Mac; but the iPad still receives criticism for its limited OS.[183][184]\n\n\nAs of September\u00a02020,[update] Apple has sold more than 500\u00a0million iPads, though sales peaked in 2013.[185] The iPad still remains the most popular tablet computer by sales as of the second quarter of 2020[update],[186] and accounted for nine percent of the company's revenue as of the end of 2021[update].[1]\n\n\nApple sells several iPad accessories, including the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, Smart Keyboard Folio, Magic Keyboard, and several adapters.\n\n\n\n### Other products[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nAirPods Max\n![](image)\nApple Watch Ultra\n\nApple makes several other products that it categorizes as \"Wearables, Home and Accessories\".[187] These products include the AirPods line of wireless headphones, Apple TV digital media players, Apple Watch smartwatches, Beats headphones and HomePod Mini smart speakers.\n\n\nAs of the end of 2021[update], this broad line of products comprises about 11% of the company's revenues.[1]\n\n\nAt WWDC 2023, Apple introduced its new VR headset, Vision Pro, along with visionOS.[188] Apple announced that it will be partnering with Unity to bring existing 3D apps to Vision Pro using Unity's PolySpatial technology.[189][190][191][192]\n\n\n\n### Services[edit]\n\n\nApple offers a broad line of services, including advertising in the App Store and Apple News app, the AppleCare+ extended warranty plan, the iCloud+ cloud-based data storage service, payment services through the Apple Card credit card and the Apple Pay processing platform, digital content services including Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+, and the iTunes Store.\n\n\nAs of the end of 2021[update], services comprise about 19% of the company's revenue.[1] Many of the services have been launched as of 2019[update] when Apple announced it would be making a concerted effort to expand its service revenues.[193]\n\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Marketing of Apple Inc.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Marketing of Apple Inc..** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Branding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first official logo of Apple Inc. was used from 1977 to 1998.[194]\nAccording to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet. Jobs thought the name \"Apple\" was \"fun, spirited and not intimidating\".[195] Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were fans of the Beatles,[196] but Apple Inc. had name and logo trademark issues with Apple Corps Ltd., a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1968. This resulted in a series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies. These issues ended with the settling of their lawsuit in 2007.[197]\n\n\nApple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's \"rainbow Apple\", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it.[198] On August 27, 1999,[199] Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation.[200]\n\n\nApple evangelists were actively engaged by the company at one time, but this was after the phenomenon had already been firmly established. Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism \"something that was stumbled upon,\"[201] while Ive claimed in 2014 that \"people have an incredibly personal relationship\" with Apple's products.[84]\n\n\n*Fortune* magazine named Apple the most admired company in the United States in 2008, and in the world from 2008 to 2012.[202] On September 30, 2013, Apple surpassed Coca-Cola to become the world's most valuable brand in the Omnicom Group's \"Best Global Brands\" report.[203] Boston Consulting Group has ranked Apple as the world's most innovative brand every year as of 2005[update].[204]\n\n\nAs of January\u00a02021,[update] 1.65 billion Apple products were in active use.[205][206] In February 2023 that number exceeded 2 billion devices.[207][208]\n\n\n\n### Advertising[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple Inc. advertising\n\nApple's first slogan, \"Byte into an Apple\", was coined in the late 1970s.[209] From 1997 to 2002, the slogan \"Think different\" was used in advertising campaigns, and is still closely associated with Apple.[210] Apple also has slogans for specific product lines\u2014for example, \"iThink, therefore iMac\" was used in 1998 to promote the iMac,[211] and \"Say hello to iPhone\" has been used in iPhone advertisements.[212] \"Hello\" was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, Newton, iMac (\"hello (again)\"), and iPod.[213]\n\n\nFrom the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, with the 1984 Super Bowl advertisement to the more modern Get a Mac adverts, Apple has been recognized for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products. However, claims made by later campaigns were criticized,[214] particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads.[215] Apple's product advertisements gained significant attention as a result of their eye-popping graphics and catchy tunes.[216] Musicians who benefited from an improved profile as a result of their songs being included on Apple advertisements include Canadian singer Feist with the song \"1234\" and Yael Na\u00efm with the song \"New Soul\".[216]\n\n\n\n### Stores[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple Store\n\n![](image)Apple Fifth Avenue is the flagship store in New York City.\n![](image)A Genius Bar is at Apple's Regent Street store in London.\nThe first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs,[91] after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts.[93] Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers, and hired Ron Johnson in 2000.[93] Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997,[217] and opened the first two physical stores in 2001.[91] The media initially speculated that Apple would fail,[94] but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so.[94]\n\n\nOver the years, Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage, with 499 stores across 22 countries worldwide as of December\u00a02017[update].[95] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.[218] Apple Stores underwent a period of significant redesign, beginning in May 2016. This redesign included physical changes to the Apple Stores, such as open spaces and re-branded rooms, as well as changes in function to facilitate interaction between consumers and professionals.[219]\n\n\nMany Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has built several stand-alone \"flagship\" stores in high-profile locations.[93] It has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores' designs and construction, specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes.[220] The success of Apple Stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers, who have lost traffic, control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores.[221] Due to the popularity of the brand, Apple receives a large number of job applications, many of which come from young workers.[218] Although Apple Store employees receive above-average pay, are offered money toward education and health care, and receive product discounts,[218] there are limited or no paths of career advancement.[218]\n\n\n\n### Market power[edit]\n\n\nOn March 16, 2020, France fined Apple \u20ac1.1 billion for colluding with two wholesalers to stifle competition and keep prices high by handicapping independent resellers. The arrangement created aligned prices for Apple products such as iPads and personal computers for about half the French retail market. According to the French regulators, the abuses occurred between 2005 and 2017 but were first discovered after a complaint by an independent reseller, eBizcuss, in 2012.[222]\n\n\nOn August 13, 2020, Epic Games, the maker of the popular game *Fortnite*, sued Apple and Google after its hugely popular video game was removed from Apple and Google's App Store. The suits came after both Apple and Google blocked the game after it introduced a direct payment system, effectively shutting out the tech titans from collecting fees.[223] In September 2020, Epic Games founded the Coalition for App Fairness together with thirteen other companies, which aims for better conditions for the inclusion of apps in the app stores.[224] Later, in December 2020, Facebook agreed to assist Epic in their legal game against Apple, planning to support the company by providing materials and documents to Epic. Facebook had, however, stated that the company would not participate directly with the lawsuit, although did commit to helping with the discovery of evidence relating to the trial of 2021. In the months prior to their agreement, Facebook had been dealing with feuds against Apple relating to the prices of paid apps as well as privacy rule changes.[225] Head of ad products for Facebook Dan Levy commented, saying that \"this is not really about privacy for them, this is about an attack on personalized ads and the consequences it's going to have on small-business owners,\" commenting on the full-page ads placed by Facebook in various newspapers in December 2020.[226]\n\n\n\n### Customer privacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)PRISM: a clandestine surveillance program under which the NSA collects user data from companies like Facebook and Apple[227]\nApple has a pro-privacy stance, actively making privacy-conscious features and settings part of its conferences, promotional campaigns, and public image.[228] With its iOS 8 mobile operating system in 2014, the company started encrypting all contents of iOS devices through users' passcodes, making it impossible at the time for the company to provide customer data to law enforcement requests seeking such information.[229] With the popularity rise of cloud storage solutions, Apple began a technique in 2016 to do deep learning scans for facial data in photos on the user's local device and encrypting the content before uploading it to Apple's iCloud storage system.[230] It also introduced \"differential privacy\", a way to collect crowdsourced data from many users, while keeping individual users anonymous, in a system that *Wired* described as \"trying to learn as much as possible about a group while learning as little as possible about any individual in it\".[231] Users are explicitly asked if they want to participate, and can actively opt-in or opt-out.[232]\n\n\nWith Apple's release of an update to iOS 14, Apple required all developers of iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch applications to directly ask iPhone users permission to track them. The feature, titled \"App Tracking Transparency\", received heavy criticism from Facebook, whose primary business model revolves around the tracking of users' data and sharing such data with advertisers so users can see more relevant ads, a technique commonly known as targeted advertising. Despite Facebook's measures, including purchasing full-page newspaper advertisements protesting App Tracking Transparency, Apple released the update in mid-spring 2021. A study by Verizon subsidiary Flurry Analytics reported only 4% of iOS users in the United States and 12% worldwide have opted into tracking.[233]\n\n\nHowever, Apple aids law enforcement in criminal investigations by providing iCloud backups of users' devices,[234] and the company's commitment to privacy has been questioned by its efforts to promote biometric authentication technology in its newer iPhone models, which do not have the same level of constitutional privacy as a passcode in the United States.[235]\n\n\nPrior to the release of iOS 15, Apple announced new efforts at combating child sexual abuse material on iOS and Mac platforms. Parents of minor iMessage users can now be alerted if their child sends or receives nude photographs. Additionally, on-device hashing would take place on media destined for upload to iCloud, and hashes would be compared to a list of known abusive images provided by law enforcement; if enough matches were found, Apple would be alerted and authorities informed. The new features received praise from law enforcement and victims rights advocates, however privacy advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, condemned the new features as invasive and highly prone to abuse by authoritarian governments.[236]\n\n\nIreland's Data Protection Commission launched a privacy investigation to examine whether Apple complied with the EU's GDPR law following an investigation into how the company processes personal data with targeted ads on its platform.[237]\n\n\nIn December 2019, a report found that the iPhone 11 Pro continues tracking location and collecting user data even after users have disabled location services. In response, an Apple engineer said the Location Services icon \"appears for system services that do not have a switch in settings.\"[238]\n\n\nAccording to published reports by Bloomberg News on March 30, 2022, Apple turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, an Apple representative referred the reporter to a section of the company policy for law enforcement guidelines, which stated, \"We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.\"[239]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple, Braeburn Capital, and FileMaker\n\n### Business trends[edit]\n\n\nThe key trends for Apple are (as of the financial year ending September 24):[240][241]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | 2011\n | 2012\n | 2013\n | 2014\n | 2015\n | 2016\n | 2017\n | 2018\n | 2019\n | 2020\n | 2021\n | 2022\n | 2023\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue figures\n |\n| Total revenue (US$ b)[242] | 108\n | 156\n | 170\n | 182\n | 233\n | 215\n | 229\n | 265\n | 260\n | 274\n | 365\n | 394\n | 383\n |\n| - iPhone revenue (US$ b)\n | 45.9\n | 78.6\n | 91.2\n | 101\n | 155\n | 136\n | 139\n | 164\n | 142\n | 137\n | 191\n | 205\n | 200\n |\n| - Mac revenue (US$ b)\n | 21.7\n | 23.2\n | 21.4\n | 24.0\n | 25.4\n | 22.8\n | 25.5\n | 25.1\n | 25.7\n | 28.6\n | 35.1\n | 40.1\n | 29.3\n |\n| - iPad revenue (US$ b)\n | 19.1\n | 30.9\n | 31.9\n | 30.2\n | 23.2\n | 20.6\n | 18.8\n | 18.3\n | 21.2\n | 23.7\n | 31.8\n | 29.2\n | 28.3\n |\n| - Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue (US$ b)\n | 11.9\n | 10.7\n | 10.1\n | 8.3\n | 10.0\n | 11.1\n | 12.8\n | 17.3\n | 24.4\n | 30.6\n | 38.3\n | 41.2\n | 39.8\n |\n| - Services revenue (US$ b)\n | 9.3\n | 12.8\n | 16.0\n | 18.0\n | 19.9\n | 24.3\n | 32.7\n | 39.7\n | 46.2\n | 53.7\n | 68.4\n | 78.1\n | 85.2\n |\n| Non-revenue figures\n |\n| Net profit (US$ b)[243] | 25.9\n | 41.7\n | 37.0\n | 39.5\n | 53.3\n | 45.6\n | 48.3\n | 59.3\n | 55.2\n | 57.4\n | 94.6\n | 99.8\n | 96.9\n |\n| Number of employees (k, FTE)\n | 60.4\n | 72.8\n | 80.3\n | 92.6\n | 110\n | 116\n | 123\n | 132\n | 137\n | 147\n | 154\n | 164\n | 161\n |\n| References | [244] | [245] | [246] | [247] | [248] | [249] | [250] | [251] | [252] | [253] | [254] | [255] | [256] |\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\n#### Senior management[edit]\n\n\nAs of March\u00a016, 2021[update], the management of Apple Inc. includes:[257]\n\n\n\n* Tim Cook (chief executive officer)\n* Jeff Williams (chief operating officer)\n* Luca Maestri (senior vice president and chief financial officer)\n* Katherine L.

Steve Jobs (1997\u20132011)\n\n\n### Corporate culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Co-founder Steve Wozniak and engineer Andy Hertzfeld attended the Apple User Group Connection club in 1985.\n![](image)Universities with the most alumni at Apple\nApple is one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture. Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[258] According to a 2011 report in *Fortune*, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[259] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching *Star Trek* and attending *Star Trek* conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[260]\n\n\nAs the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often took longer than others.[261]\n\n\nThe Apple Fellows program awards employees for extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing. Recipients include Bill Atkinson,[262] Steve Capps,[263] Rod Holt,[262] Alan Kay,[264][265] Guy Kawasaki,[264][266] Al Alcorn,[267] Don Norman,[264] Rich Page,[262] Steve Wozniak,[262] and Phil Schiller.[268]\n\n\nAt Apple, employees are intended to be specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise.[*needs update*] Jobs saw this as a means of having \"best-in-class\" employees in every role. For instance, Ron Johnson\u2014Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011\u2014was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores. This was done by Tim Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management.[269] Apple is known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a \"directly responsible individual\" or \"DRI\" in Apple jargon.[259][270] As an example, when iOS senior vice president Scott Forstall refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned Maps app, he was forced to resign.[271] Unlike other major U.S. companies, Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.[272]\n\n\nIn 2015, Apple had 110,000\u00a0full-time employees. This increased to 116,000\u00a0full-time employees the next year, a notable hiring decrease, largely due to its first revenue decline. Apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail, though its 2014 SEC filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base.[273] In September 2017, Apple announced that it had over 123,000 full-time employees.[274]\n\n\nApple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy, and has an anti-leak Global Security team that recruits from the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Secret Service.[275]\n\n\nIn December 2017, Glassdoor said Apple was the 48th best place to work, having originally entered at rank 19 in 2009, peaking at rank 10 in 2012, and falling down the ranks in subsequent years.[276]\n\n\nIn 2023, *Bloomberg*'s Mark Gurman revealed the existence of Apple's Exploratory Design Group (XDG), which was working to add glucose monitoring to the Apple Watch. Gurman compared XDG to Alphabet's X \"moonshot factory\".[277]\n\n\n\n### Offices[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Apple Park and Apple Campus\n\n![](image)Apple Park is the main headquarters in Cupertino.\nApple Inc.'s world corporate headquarters are located in Cupertino, in the middle of California's Silicon Valley, at Apple Park, a massive circular groundscraper building with a circumference of one mile (1.6\u00a0km). The building opened in April 2017 and houses more than 12,000 employees. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs wanted Apple Park to look less like a business park and more like a nature refuge, and personally appeared before the Cupertino City Council in June 2011 to make the proposal, in his final public appearance before his death.\n\n\n\n![](image)The original Apple Campus has the street address 1 Infinite Loop, Sunnyvale, California.\nApple also operates from the Apple Campus (also known by its address, 1 Infinite Loop), a grouping of six buildings in Cupertino that total 850,000 square feet (79,000\u00a0m2) located about 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) to the west of Apple Park.[278] The Apple Campus was the company's headquarters from its opening in 1993, until the opening of Apple Park in 2017. The buildings, located at 1\u20136 Infinite Loop, are arranged in a circular pattern around a central green space, in a design that has been compared to that of a university.\n\n\nIn addition to Apple Park and the Apple Campus, Apple occupies an additional thirty office buildings scattered throughout the city of Cupertino, including three buildings as prior headquarters: Stephens Creek Three from 1977 to 1978, Bandley One from 1978 to 1982, and Mariani One from 1982 to 1993.[279] In total, Apple occupies almost 40% of the available office space in the city.[280]\n\n\nApple's headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are located in Cork in the south of Ireland, called the Hollyhill campus.[281] The facility, which opened in 1980, houses 5,500 people and was Apple's first location outside of the United States.[282] Apple's international sales and distribution arms operate out of the campus in Cork.[283]\n\n\nApple has two campuses near Austin, Texas: a 216,000-square-foot (20,100\u00a0m2) campus opened in 2014 houses 500 engineers who work on Apple silicon[284] and a 1.1-million-square-foot (100,000\u00a0m2) campus opened in 2021 where 6,000 people work in technical support, supply chain management, online store curation, and Apple Maps data management.\n\n\nThe company also has several other locations in Boulder, Colorado, Culver City, California, Herzliya (Israel), London, New York, Pittsburgh, San Diego, and Seattle that each employ hundreds of people.[285]\n\n\n\n### Litigation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Litigation involving Apple Inc.\n\nApple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.[286] In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include *Apple v. Samsung*, *Apple v. Microsoft*, *Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc.*, and *Apple Corps v. Apple Computer*. Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights. Most have been dismissed in the courts as shell companies known as patent trolls, with no evidence of actual use of patents in question.[287] On December 21, 2016, Nokia announced that in the U.S. and Germany, it has filed a suit against Apple, claiming that the latter's products infringe on Nokia's patents.[288] Most recently, in November 2017, the United States International Trade Commission announced an investigation into allegations of patent infringement in regards to Apple's remote desktop technology; Aqua Connect, a company that builds remote desktop software, has claimed that Apple infringed on two of its patents.[289] In January 2022, Ericsson sued Apple over payment of royalty of 5G technology.[290]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple\n\nApple is the world's largest technology company by revenue, the world's largest technology company by total assets,[291] and the world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer after Samsung.[292]\n\n\nIn its fiscal year ending in September 2011, Apple Inc. reported a total of $108\u00a0billion in annual revenues\u2014a significant increase from its 2010 revenues of $65\u00a0billion\u2014and nearly $82\u00a0billion in cash reserves.[293] On March 19, 2012, Apple announced plans for a $2.65-per-share dividend beginning in fourth quarter of 2012, per approval by their board of directors.[294]\n\n\nThe company's worldwide annual revenue in 2013 totaled $170\u00a0billion.[295] In May 2013, Apple entered the top ten of the *Fortune* 500 list of companies for the first time, rising 11 places above its 2012 ranking to take the sixth position.[296] As of 2016[update], Apple has around US$234\u00a0billion of cash and marketable securities, of which 90% is located outside the United States for tax purposes.[297]\n\n\nApple amassed 65% of all profits made by the eight largest worldwide smartphone manufacturers in quarter one of 2014, according to a report by Canaccord Genuity. In the first quarter of 2015, the company garnered 92% of all earnings.[298]\n\n\nOn April 30, 2017, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple had cash reserves of $250\u00a0billion,[299] officially confirmed by Apple as specifically $256.8\u00a0billion a few days later.[300]\n\n\nAs of August\u00a03, 2018[update], Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization. On August 2, 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to reach a $1\u00a0trillion market value.[301][302] Apple was ranked No. 4 on the 2018 *Fortune* 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[303]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Apple reported an 11% decline in Q3 profits compared to 2021. Its revenue in the same period rose 2% year-on-year to $83 billion, though this figure was also lower than in 2021, where the increase was at 36%. The general downturn is reportedly caused by the slowing global economy and supply chain disruptions in China.[304]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Apple reported a decline in its sales for the first quarter of 2023. Compared to that of 2022, revenue for 2023 fell by 3%. This is Apple's second consecutive quarter of sales decline. This fall is attributed to the slowing economy and consumers putting off purchases of iPads and computers due to increased pricing. However, iPhone sales held up with a year-on-year increase of 1.5%. According to Apple, demands for such devices were strong, particularly in Latin America and South Asia.[305]\n\n\n\n### Taxes[edit]\n\n\nApple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the British Virgin Islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to *The New York Times*, in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the \"Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich\", which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.[306][307]\n\n\nBritish Conservative Party Member of Parliament Charlie Elphicke published research on October 30, 2012,[308] which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard corporate tax rates. He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals, which also included Google and The Coca-Cola Company, to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.[309]\n\n\nAccording to a US Senate report on the company's offshore tax structure concluded in May 2013, Apple has held billions of dollars in profits in Irish subsidiaries to pay little or no taxes to any government by using an unusual global tax structure.[310] The main subsidiary, a holding company that includes Apple's retail stores throughout Europe, has not paid any corporate income tax in the last five years. \"Apple has exploited a difference between Irish and U.S. tax residency rules\", the report said.[311]\n\n\nOn May 21, 2013, Apple CEO Tim Cook defended his company's tax tactics at a Senate hearing.[312]\n\n\nApple says that it is the single largest taxpayer in the U.S., with an effective tax rate of approximately of 26% as of Q2 FY2016.[313] In an interview with the German newspaper *FAZ* in October 2017, Tim Cook stated that Apple was the biggest taxpayer worldwide.[314]\n\n\nIn 2016, after a two-year investigation, the European Commission claimed that Apple's use of a hybrid Double Irish tax arrangement constituted \"illegal state aid\" from Ireland, and ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in unpaid taxes, the largest corporate tax fine in history. This was later annulled, after the European General Court ruled that the Commission had provided insufficient evidence.[315][316] In 2018, Apple repatriated $285 billion to America, resulting in a $38 billion tax payment spread over the following 8 years.[317]\n\n\n\n### Charity[edit]\n\n\nApple is a partner of (PRODUCT)RED, a fundraising campaign for AIDS charity. In November 2014, Apple arranged for all App Store revenue in a two-week period to go to the fundraiser,[318] generating more than US$20\u00a0million,[319] and in March 2017, it released an iPhone 7 with a red color finish.[320]\n\n\nApple contributes financially to fundraisers in times of natural disasters. In November 2012, it donated $2.5\u00a0million to the American Red Cross to aid relief efforts after Hurricane Sandy,[321] and in 2017 it donated $5\u00a0million to relief efforts for both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey,[322] as well as for the 2017 Central Mexico earthquake.[323] The company has also used its iTunes platform to encourage donations in the wake of environmental disasters and humanitarian crises, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake,[324] the 2011 Japan earthquake,[325] Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in November 2013,[326] and the 2015 European migrant crisis.[327] Apple emphasizes that it does not incur any processing or other fees for iTunes donations, sending 100% of the payments directly to relief efforts, though it also acknowledges that the Red Cross does not receive any personal information on the users donating and that the payments may not be tax deductible.[328]\n\n\nOn April 14, 2016, Apple and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) announced that they have engaged in a partnership to, \"help protect life on our planet.\" Apple released a special page in the iTunes App Store, Apps for Earth. In the arrangement, Apple has committed that through April 24, WWF will receive 100% of the proceeds from the applications participating in the App Store via both the purchases of any paid apps and the In-App Purchases. Apple and WWF's Apps for Earth campaign raised more than $8\u00a0million in total proceeds to support WWF's conservation work. WWF announced the results at WWDC 2016 in San Francisco.[329]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Apple's CEO Cook announced that the company will be donating \"millions\" of masks to health workers in the United States and Europe.[330]\n\n\nOn January 13, 2021, Apple announced a $100 million \"Racial Equity and Justice Initiative\" to help combat institutional racism worldwide.[331][332]\n\n\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environmental impact of Apple\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Environmental impact of Apple.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Apple Energy[edit]\n\n\nApple Energy, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple Inc. that sells solar energy. As of June\u00a06, 2016[update], Apple's solar farms in California and Nevada have been declared to provide 217.9 megawatts of solar generation capacity.[333] In addition to the company's solar energy production, Apple has received regulatory approval to construct a landfill gas energy plant in North Carolina. Apple will use the methane emissions to generate electricity.[334] Apple's North Carolina data center is already powered entirely with energy from renewable sources.[335]\n\n\n\n### Energy and resources[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, Climate Counts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category \"Striding\".[336] This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a \"stuck icon\", adding that Apple at the time was \"a choice to avoid for the climate-conscious consumer\".[337]\n\n\nFollowing a Greenpeace protest, Apple released a statement on April 17, 2012, committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to 100% renewable clean energy.[338][339] By 2013, Apple was using 100% renewable energy to power their data centers. Overall, 75% of the company's power came from clean renewable sources.[340]\n\n\nIn May 2015, Greenpeace evaluated the state of the Green Internet and commended Apple on their environmental practices saying, \"Apple's commitment to renewable energy has helped set a new bar for the industry, illustrating in very concrete terms that a 100% renewable Internet is within its reach, and providing several models of intervention for other companies that want to build a sustainable Internet.\"[341]\n\n\nAs of 2016[update], Apple states that 100% of its U.S. operations run on renewable energy, 100% of Apple's data centers run on renewable energy and 93% of Apple's global operations run on renewable energy.[342] However, the facilities are connected to the local grid which usually contains a mix of fossil and renewable sources, so Apple carbon offsets its electricity use.[343] The Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) allows consumers to see the effect a product has on the environment. Each product receives a Gold, Silver, or Bronze rank depending on its efficiency and sustainability. Every Apple tablet, notebook, desktop computer, and display that EPEAT ranks achieves a Gold rating, the highest possible. Although Apple's data centers recycle water 35 times,[344] the increased activity in retail, corporate and data centers also increase the amount of water use to 573\u00a0million\u00a0US\u00a0gal (2.2\u00a0million\u00a0m3) in 2015.[345]\n\n\nDuring an event on March 21, 2016, Apple provided a status update on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable in all of its worldwide operations. Lisa P. Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March\u00a02016[update], 93% of Apple's worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from post-consumer recycled paper or sustainably managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products.[346] Apple working in partnership with Conservation Fund, have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in Maine and North Carolina. Another partnership announced is with the World Wildlife Fund to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres (4,000\u00a0km2) of forests in China. Featured was the company's installation of a 40 MW solar power plant in the Sichuan province of China that was tailor-made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple's Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company's energy carbon footprint in the country. In Singapore, Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple's Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy. Liam was introduced to the world, an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter designed by Apple Engineers in California specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones. Reuses and recycles parts from traded in products.[347]\n\n\nApple announced on August 16, 2016, that Lens Technology, one of its major suppliers in China, has committed to power all its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by 2018. The commitment is a large step in Apple's efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint in China.[348] Apple also announced that all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL's Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The standard, which started in January 2015, certifies that all manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or converted into energy (when necessary). Since the program began, nearly 140,000 metric tons of waste have been diverted from landfills.[349]\n\n\nOn July 21, 2020, Apple announced its plan to become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. In the next 10 years, Apple will try to lower emissions with a series of innovative actions, including: low carbon product design, expanding energy efficiency, renewable energy, process and material innovations, and carbon removal.[350]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Apple said that it had started a $200 million fund in order to combat climate change by removing 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year.[351]\n\n\nIn February 2022, the NewClimate Institute, a German environmental policy think tank, published a survey evaluating the transparency and progress of the climate strategies and carbon neutrality pledges announced by 25 major companies in the United States that found that Apple's carbon neutrality pledge and climate strategy was unsubstantiated and misleading.[352][353]\n\n\n\n### Toxins[edit]\n\n\nFollowing further campaigns by Greenpeace,[354] in 2008, Apple became the first electronics manufacturer to eliminate all polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in its complete product line.[355] In June 2007, Apple began replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit LCD displays in its computers with mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass, starting with the upgraded MacBook Pro.[356][357][358][359] Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the CO2e, emissions, materials, and electrical usage concerning every product they currently produce or have sold in the past (and which they have enough data needed to produce the report), in their portfolio on their homepage. Allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions on the products they offer for sale.[360] In June 2009, Apple's iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, and BFRs.[356][361] All Apple products now have mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays, arsenic-free glass, and non-PVC cables. All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product's respective regulatory category.[356][362]\n\n\nIn November 2011, Apple was featured in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy policy, and how \"green\" their products are. The company ranked fourth of fifteen electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10.[363] Greenpeace praised Apple's sustainability, noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. Apple continues to score well on product ratings, with all of their products now being free of PVC plastic and BFRs. However, the guide criticized Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data, and for not setting any targets to reduce emissions.[364] In January 2012, Apple requested that its cable maker, Volex, begin producing halogen-free USB and power cables.[365]\n\n\n\n### Green bonds[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2016, Apple issued a $1.5 billion green bond (climate bond), the first ever of its kind by a U.S. tech company. The green bond proceeds are dedicated to the financing of environmental projects.[366]\n\n\n\n## Supply chain[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple supply chain\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Apple supply chain.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\nApple products were made in America in Apple-owned factories until the late 1990s; however, as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by *The New York Times*, Apple insiders \"believe the vast scale of overseas factories, as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers, have so outpaced their American counterparts that \"Made in the USA\" is no longer a viable option for most Apple products\".[367]\n\n\nThe company's manufacturing, procurement, and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: \"Nobody wants to buy sour milk.\"[368][369]\n\n\nIn May 2017, the company announced a $1 billion funding project for \"advanced manufacturing\" in the United States,[370] and subsequently invested $200\u00a0million in Corning Inc., a manufacturer of toughened Gorilla Glass technology used in its iPhone devices.[371] The following December, Apple's chief operating officer, Jeff Williams, told *CNBC* that the \"$1 billion\" amount was \"absolutely not\" the final limit on its spending, elaborating that \"We're not thinking in terms of a fund limit... We're thinking about, where are the opportunities across the U.S. to help nurture companies that are making the advanced technology\u2014 and the advanced manufacturing that goes with that\u2014 that quite frankly is essential to our innovation.\"[372]\n\n\nAs of 2021[update], Apple uses components from 43 countries.[373] The majority of assembling is done by Taiwanese original design manufacturer firms Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Compal Electronics with factories mostly located inside China,[374] but also Brazil,[375] and India.[376]\n\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., (TSMC) is a pure-play semiconductor manufacturing company. They make the majority of Apple's smartphone SoCs, with Samsung Semiconductor, playing a minority role.[377] Apple, alone accounted for over 25% of TSMC's total income in 2021.[378] Apple's Bionic lineup of smartphone SoCs, are currently made exclusively by TSMC[379] from the A7 bionic onwards, previously manufacturing was shared with Samsung. The M series of Apple SoC for consumer computers and tablets is made by TSMC as well.[380]\n\n\nDuring the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.[381] This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the PCI bus in the 7500/8500/9500 Power Macs. Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as USB, AGP, HyperTransport, Wi-Fi, NVMe, PCIe and others in its products. FireWire is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as IEEE 1394 and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States.[382]\n\n\nApple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market. In July 2012, during a conference call with investors, CEO Tim Cook said that he \"[loves] India\", but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region.[383] India's requirement that 30% of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as \"really adds cost to getting product to market\".[384] In May 2016, Apple opened an iOS app development center in Bangalore and a maps development office for 4,000 staff in Hyderabad.[385] In March, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple would begin manufacturing iPhone models in India \"over the next two months\",[386] and in May, the *Journal* wrote that an Apple manufacturer had begun production of iPhone SE in the country,[387] while Apple told *CNBC* that the manufacturing was for a \"small number\" of units.[388] In April 2019, Apple initiated manufacturing of iPhone 7 at its Bengaluru facility, keeping in mind demand from local customers even as they seek more incentives from the government of India.[389] At the beginning of 2020, Tim Cook announced that Apple schedules the opening of its first physical outlet in India for 2021, while an online store is to be launched by the end of the year.[390]\n\n\nDuring the 2022 COVID-19 protests in China, Chinese state-owned company Wingtech was reported by *The Wall Street Journal* to gain an additional foothold in Apple's supply chain following protests at a Foxconn factory in the Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone.[391]\n\n\n\n### Worker organizations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple and unions\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Apple and unions.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\nIn 2006, one complex of factories in Shenzhen, China that assembled the iPod and other items had over 200,000 workers living and working within it. Employees regularly worked more than 60 hours per week and made around $100 per month. A little over half of the workers' earnings was required to pay for rent and food from the company.[392][393]\n\n\nApple immediately launched an investigation after the 2006 media report, and worked with their manufacturers to ensure acceptable working conditions.[394] In 2007, Apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding worker's rights, slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply. Yearly progress reports have been published as of 2008[update].[395] In 2011, Apple admitted that its suppliers' child labor practices in China had worsened.[396]\n\n\nThe Foxconn suicides occurred between January and November 2010, when 18 Foxconn (Chinese: \u5bcc\u58eb\u5eb7) employees attempted suicide,[397] resulting in 14 deaths\u2014the company was the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, for clients including Apple, at the time.[397][398][399] The suicides drew media attention, and employment practices at Foxconn were investigated by Apple.[400] Apple issued a public statement about the suicides, and company spokesperson Steven Dowling said:\n\n\n\n\n> [Apple is] saddened and upset by the recent suicides at Foxconn ... A team from Apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made.[401]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe statement was released after the results from the company's probe into its suppliers' labor practices were published in early 2010. Foxconn was not specifically named in the report, but Apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws, including Apple's own rules, and some child labor existed in a number of factories.[401] Apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides.[402]\n\n\nAlso in 2010, workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens. One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses.[403] After a high suicide rate in a Foxconn facility in China making iPads and iPhones, albeit a lower rate than that of China as a whole,[404] workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves.[405] Workers in factories producing Apple products have also been exposed to hexane, a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products.[406]\n\n\nA 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, despite Apple's promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was once again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. While the BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing as of 2010[update], Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: \"We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions\".[402]\n\n\nIn December 2014, the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple's iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65-hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in \"primitive, dark and filthy dorms\" where they sleep \"on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room.\" Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers.[407]\n\n\nIn 2019, there were reports stating that some of Foxconn's managers had used rejected parts to build iPhones and that Apple was investigating the issue.[408]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Apple Inc. media events\n* Pixar\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Apple 10-K Report FY2021\" (PDF).

Its products include desktop computers, laptops, netbooks, mobile phones, networking equipment, monitors, wi-fi routers, projectors, motherboards, graphics cards, optical storage, multimedia products, peripherals, wearables, servers, workstations and tablet PCs. The company is also an original equipment manufacturer (OEM).\n\n\nAsus is the world's 5th-largest PC vendor by unit sales as of January 2023.[8] Asus appears in *BusinessWeek*'s \"InfoTech 100\" and \"Asia's Top 10 IT Companies\" rankings, and it ranked first in the IT Hardware category of the 2008 Taiwan Top 10 Global Brands survey with a total brand value of US$1.3 billion.[9]\n\n\nAsus has a primary listing on the Taiwan Stock Exchange under the ticker code *2357* and formerly had a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker code *ASKD*.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe company is usually referred to as *ASUS* or *Hu\u00e1shu\u00f2* in Chinese (traditional Chinese: \u83ef\u78a9; simplified Chinese: \u534e\u7855, literally \"Eminence by the Chinese\"[10]). According to the company website, the name *ASUS* originates from Pegasus, the winged horse of Greek mythology.[11] Only the last four letters of the word were used to give the name a high position in alphabetical listings.[12]\nAs its marketing taglines, ASUS has used *Rock Solid. Heart Touching* (2003\u20132009) and subsequently *Inspiring Innovation Persistent Perfection* (2009\u20132013). Since 2013, the company's tagline has been *In Search of Incredible.*[13]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nAsus was founded in Taipei in 1989[14] by T.H. Tung, Ted Hsu, Wayne Hsieh and M.T. Liao,[15] all four having previously worked at Acer as hardware engineers. At this time, Taiwan had yet to establish a leading position in the computer hardware business. Intel Corporation would supply any new processors to more established companies like IBM first, and Taiwanese companies would have to wait for approximately six months after IBM received their engineering prototypes. According to company history, Asus created a motherboard prototype for using an Intel 486, but it had to do so without access to the actual processor. When Asus approached Intel to request a processor to test it, Intel itself had a problem with its own 486 motherboard. Asus solved Intel's problem and it turned out that Asus' motherboard worked correctly without the need for further modification. Since then, Asus was receiving Intel engineering samples ahead of its competitors.[16][17]\n\n\nIn September 2005, Asus released the first PhysX accelerator card.[18] In December 2005, Asus entered the LCD TV market with the TLW32001 model.[19] In January 2006, Asus announced that it would cooperate with Lamborghini to develop the VX laptop series.[20]\n\n\nOn 9 March 2006, Asus was confirmed as one of the manufacturers of the first Microsoft Origami models, together with Samsung and Founder Technology.[21] On 8 August 2006, Asus announced a joint venture with Gigabyte Technology.[22] On 5 June 2007, Asus announced the launch of the Eee PC at COMPUTEX Taipei. On 9 September 2007, Asus indicated support for Blu-ray, announcing the release of a BD-ROM/DVD writer PC drive, BC-1205PT.[23] ASUS subsequently released several Blu-ray based notebooks.\n\n\nIn January 2008, Asus began a major restructuring of its operations, splitting into three independent companies: Asus (focused on applied first-party branded computers and electronics); Pegatron (focused on OEM manufacturing of motherboards and components); and Unihan Corporation (focused on non-PC manufacturing such as cases and molding).[24][25] In the process of the restructuring, a highly criticized pension-plan restructuring effectively zeroed out the existing pension balances. The company paid out all contributions previously made by employees.[26]\n\n\nOn 9 December 2008, the Open Handset Alliance announced that Asus had become one of 14 new members of the organization. These \"new members will either deploy compatible Android devices, contribute significant code to the Android Open-Source Project, or support the ecosystem through products and services that will accelerate the availability of Android-based devices.\"[27]\n\n\nOn 1 June 2010, Asus spun off Pegatron Corp.[28]\n\n\nIn October 2010, Asus and Garmin announced that they would be ending their smartphone partnership as a result of Garmin deciding to exit the product category.[29] The two companies had produced six Garmin-ASUS branded smartphones over the prior two years.[29]\n\n\nIn December 2010, Asus launched the world's thinnest notebook, the Asus U36, with Intel processor voltage standard (not low voltage) Intel Core i3 or i5 with a thickness of only 19\u00a0mm.[30]\n\n\nIn January 2013, Asus officially ended production of its Eee PC series due to declining sales caused by consumers increasingly switching to tablets and Ultrabooks.[31][32] In April 2022, the company unveiled its new logo.[33][34]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Asus US headquarters in Fremont, California\n![](image)An Asus shop in Hong Kong\nAsus has its headquarters in Beitou District, Taipei, Taiwan.[35]\n\n\nAs of 2009[update], Asus had manufacturing facilities in Taiwan (Taipei, Luzhu, Nangang, Guishan), mainland China (Suzhou, Chongqing), Mexico (Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez) and the Czech Republic (Ostrava). The Asus Hi-Tech Park, located in Suzhou, covers 540,000\u00a0m2 (5,800,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft).[36]\n\n\nAsus operates around 50 service sites across 32 countries and has over 400 service partners worldwide.[37]\n\n\n\n## Products[edit]\n\n\nAsus' products include 2-in-1s, laptops, tablet computers, desktop computers, smartphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), servers, computer monitors, motherboards, graphics cards, sound cards, DVD drives, computer networking devices, computer cases, computer components and computer cooling systems.\n\n\nOne of Asus main lineup is the Vivo lineup consisting of laptops (VivoBooks), All-in-Ones (Vivo AiO), desktops (VivoPC), Stick PCs (VivoStick), Mini PCs (VivoMini), smartwatches (VivoWatch), computer mouse (VivoMouse) and tablets (VivoTab).[38]\n\n\n\n* ![ASUS ZenFone](image)\n\nASUS ZenFone\n* ![An Asus Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card](image)\n\nAn Asus Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card\n* ![An Asus x21 ultrabook](image)\n\nAn Asus x21 ultrabook\n* ![An Asus motherboard](image)\n\nAn Asus motherboard\n\n\n### Smartphones[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Asus ZenFone\n\nAsus also launched many Android-based smartphones, predominantly with Intel rather than ARM processors and often with two sim slots. Asus is currently very influential in big mobile markets like India, China, and other Asian countries. It is known as the ZenFone series.

As of December\u00a02011[update] the line consisted of the CG Series (designed for gaming), the CM series (for entertainment and home use) and the CS and CP slimline series.[50]\n\n\n\n### Digital media receivers[edit]\n\n\nAsus sells digital media receivers under the name ASUS O!Play.[51]\n\n\n\n### GPS devices[edit]\n\n\nAsus produces the R700T GPS device, which incorporates Traffic Message Channel.[52]\n\n\n\n### Republic of Gamers (ROG) [edit]\n\n\n![](image)Republic of Gamers (old logo)\nFile:Republic of Gamers (ROG).pngRepublic of Gamers (new logo)\n![](image)ASUS promotional model and ROG products\n**Republic of Gamers** (**ROG**) is a brand used by ASUS since 2006, encompassing a range of computer hardware, personal computers, peripherals, and accessories. \n\n\nAMD graphics cards were marketed under the *Arez* brand due to the Nvidia's GeForce Partner Program.[53]\n\n\nIn 2013 ASUS launched the RAIDR Express, a PCI express-based RAID 0 SSD subsystem with two SSDs on one PCB.[54]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Asus announced the ROG Flow Z13 during ROG's CES 2022 launch event. Equipped with the high-performance Intel's Core i9 processor and Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3050 Ti graphic performance, making the biggest innovation breakthroughs in tablet markets. It is the world's first RTX 30 series computer in tablet form factor.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Asus ROG Ally handheld gaming computer\nIn June 2023, Asus released the ROG Ally, a handheld device designed to compete with the Steam Deck. The Ally possesses a 7-inch (diagonal), 1080p touchscreen display with a 120\u00a0Hz refresh rate capability and a 16:9 aspect ratio, versus the Steam Deck's panel that only manages 800p and 60\u00a0Hz with a 16:10 aspect ratio.[56]\n\n\n\n### The Ultimate Force (TUF)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ASUS TUF Gaming X3\n**The Ultimate Force** (**TUF**) is a brand used by ASUS since about 2010.[57] The brand is for ASUS affordable, mid-range gaming products.\n\n\n\n### Sound cards[edit]\n\n\nAsus released its first sound card, the Xonar DX, in February 2008. The Xonar DX was able to emulate the EAX 5.0 effects through the ASUS GX software while also supporting Open AL and DTS-connect.[58] In July 2008 ASUS launched the Xonar D1, which offered largely similar features to the Xonar DX but connected to the motherboard through the PCI interface instead of the PCI-E \u00d71 connection of the Xonar DX.[59] ASUS then released the Xonar HDAV 1.3, which was the first solution enabling loss-less HD audio bit streaming to AV receivers.[60]\n\n\nIn May 2009, Asus launched the Essence ST sound card, targeted at high-end audiophiles, and featuring 124\u00a0dB SNR rating and precision audio clock tuning.[61] In the same month, Asus refreshed the HDAV family by releasing the HDAV 1.3 slim, a card targeted for HTPC users offering similar functionality to HDAV 1.3 but in a smaller form.[62] During Computex 2010, ASUS introduced its Xonar Xense, an audio bundle composed of the Xense sound card and a special edition of the Sennheiser PC350 headset.[63][64] In August 2010, ASUS released the Xonar DG sound card targeted at budget buyers and offering 5.1 surround sound support, 105\u00a0dB SNR rating, support for Dolby headphone and GX 2.5 support for emulating EAX 5.0 technology.[65][66]\n\n\n\n### ASUS VivoPC line[edit]\n\n\nAsus entered the box-PC market with the Vivo PC line in November 2013.[67] ASUS VivoPCs come without a pre-installed Windows operating system.\n\n\nOn 23 October 2013, ASUS launched two models of VivoPCs in India.[68] VivoPC was initially announced with Intel Celeron processor equipped VM40B model. But in India, the company released VivoPC along with a new model called VC60 which is equipped with Intel Core series processors.[69]\n\n\n\n### Portable monitors[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Asus released the MB168B, a USB 3.0-powered, portable external monitor. The base model shipped with a resolution of 1366\u2009\u00d7\u2009768, while the MB168B+ had a resolution of 1920\u2009\u00d7\u20091080.[70] At the time of its release, the MB168B+ was the only 1080p portable monitor. According to Asus, it is the \"world's slimmest and lightest USB monitor\".[70]\n\n\n\n### Desktop monitors[edit]\n\n\n* ROG Swift OLED PG27AQDM\n* ROG Swift OLED PG42UQ\n* ROG Swift OLED PG48UQ\n* ROG Swift PG279QM (2560x1440, 240Hz, IPS)\n* ROG Swift PG27AQN (2560x1440, 360Hz, IPS)\n* ROG Swift PG279Q[71]\n* ROG Swift PG348Q\n* ROG Swift PG35VQ[72]\n* ROG Swift PB27UQ\n* ROG Strix XG27AQ\n* ROG Strix XG27AQM\n* ROG Strix XG27AQMR\n* ROG Strix XG27AQV\n* MX34VQ\n* VZ279Q\n\n\n### Motherboards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Q-Connector\nAsus motherboards sometimes include a **Q-Connector** which sits in between the motherboard front panel connectors and the front panel cables. The Q-Connector is marked with bigger text than the front panel connectors on the motherboard, as well as protruding from the motherboard, limiting obstruction from heatsinks and other connectors.[73][74]\n\n\nThe Q-connector allows the many front-panel connections to be removed as a single unit for maintenance. This greatly reduces the risk of incorrect connections when reassembling.[75]\n\n\n\n## Other initiatives[edit]\n\n\n### Esports[edit]\n\n\nAsus ROG has been an active advocate for esports, having established some of their very own professional gaming teams.[76]\n\n\nIn January 2021, ROG announced the establishment of a new esports academy in India, with plans to scout and train professional gamers for the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) PC game.[77] The initiative will provide shortlisted gamers with coaching, gaming equipment, and stipends to prepare them for competitive esports tournaments on both the national and international levels.[78]\n\n\n\n## Environmental record[edit]\n\n\n### Green ASUS[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, Asus launched Green ASUS,[79] a company-wide sustainable computing initiative overseen by a steering committee led by Jonney Shih, the Chairman of Asus. According to the company, Asus pursues green policies in \"Design, Procurement, Manufacturing, and Marketing.\"[80]\n\n\n\n### Recognition[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Asus obtained IECQ (IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components) and HSPM (Hazardous Substance Process Management) certification for its headquarters and all of its manufacturing sites.[81]\n\n\nIn 2007, Oekom Research, an independent research institute specializing in corporate responsibility assessment, recognized Asus as a \"highly environmental friendly company\" in the \"Computers, Peripherals and Office Electronics Industry\".[82]\n\n\nIn October 2008, Asus received 11 Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) Gold Awards for its products,[83] including four of its N-Series notebooks, namely the N10, N20, N50, and N80. In the following month, it received EU Flower certification for the same N-Series notebooks at an award ceremony held in Prague.[82] In December 2008, Det Norske Veritas conferred the world's first EuP (Energy-using Product) certification for portable notebooks on these machines.[82]\n\n\n\n### Recycling campaign[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2008, Asus launched its \"PC Recycling for a Brighter Future\"[84][85]\nprogram in collaboration with Intel and with Tsann Kuen Enterprise Co. The program collected more than 1,200 desktop computers, notebooks and CRT/LCD monitors, refurbished them and donated them to 122 elementary and junior high schools, five aboriginal communities and the Tzu Chi Stem Cell Center.\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2008, *PC Pro* discovered through a reader that Asus had accidentally shipped laptops that contained cracked and unlicensed software.[86] Both physical machines and recovery CDs contained confidential documents from Microsoft and other organizations, internal Asus documents, and sensitive personal information including CVs. At the time, an Asus spokesperson promised an investigation at \"quite a high level\", but declined to comment on how the files got on the machines and recovery media.[87] It was demonstrated that an unattended installation of Windows Vista could accidentally copy material from a flash drive with a parameter in the \"unattend.xml\" file on the personal flash drive being used to script the installation.[88][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nIn February 2014, a security vulnerability in the AiCloud functions on a number of Asus routers was compromised to distribute a text file warning of a vulnerability, disclosed in June 2013, allowing the ability to \"traverse to any external storage plugged in through the USB ports on the back of the router\" via the open internet. Before making the vulnerability public, the researcher was told by Asus that the behavior was \"not an issue\", but the vulnerability was reportedly patched shortly before the breach.[89] The IP addresses of 12,937 routers, and 3,131 AiCloud accounts were also leaked by the hackers.[90] The U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint about the breach for the company's \"failure to employ reasonable security practices has subjected consumers to substantial injury\", alleging that Asus had also failed to perform basic penetration tests, allowed users to maintain a default admin password for the AiDisk feature and failed to notify users of security updates in a timely fashion. As a result, it was also deemed that Asus had misled consumers over the security and protection that its routers provided. In February 2016, Asus settled the complaint, agreeing to implement a \"comprehensive security program\", including independent audits every two years for the next 20 years.[91][90]\n\n\n\nIn March 2019, Kaspersky Lab researchers disclosed a supply chain attack that affected the Asus Live Update software bundled on its laptops, dubbed **ShadowHammer**. Kaspersky stated that between June and November 2018, Asus servers had been compromised to distribute a modified version of Live Update, signed with an Asus signature, that contained a backdoor. It deployed a further payload if the device's network adapter matched an entry on an internal target list of around 600 MAC addresses. In response to ShadowHammer, Asus released a patched version of Live Update with improved security measures. Kaspersky and Symantec estimated that between 500,000 and 1 million devices were infected with the backdoor, although Asus attempted to downplay the severity of the breach by noting the extremely targeted nature of the attack. The breach did not affect the similar, identically named software associated with its motherboards.[92][93][94]\n\n\n\nIn April 2019, ESET disclosed that a group known as BlackTech had performed targeted attacks with malware known as Plead, distributed via the updater for the Asus WebStorage service. ESET stated that the group was likely using a man-in-the-middle attack via a vulnerability in routers, in combination with the updater using an unencrypted HTTP connection.[95]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Asus recalled some of its Z690 Maximus Hero motherboards due to a manufacturing flaw, where a RAM capacitor was installed backward\u2014causing them to burn out associated MOSFETs and prevent the motherboard from detecting memory.[96]\n\n\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, ASUS initially refused to join a widespread withdrawal of businesses from the Russian market. In mid-March, the company did announce it was halting its operations in Russia, following a social media boycott and government pressure.[97][98]\n\n\nIn April 2023, a post on the PCMasterRace subreddit began gaining popularity regarding the user's AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU, which had visible burning, along with the socket of the Asus motherboard.[99] This sparked the attention of both people interested in PCs, who initially thought it was an issue with the 3D V-Cache Technology (as there had been previous user reports similar to this incident),[99] as well as enthusiast YouTube channels such as Gamers Nexus, who ran tests to successfully recreate the burning of their CPU.[100] They realised that the cause of the burning was due to a voltage error in the BIOS. In May, Asus responded to the incidents by releasing a Beta BIOS, which was supposed to fix the error. However, not only did the new BIOS not fix the issue; by installing it, the user voided their warranty as it was a Beta BIOS, which Asus clearly stated in the BIOS's description.[100][101][102] Later that month, Asus responded to the public backlash by reversing course, releasing a statement informing users that they will continue to honor warranty on motherboards that have been updated to beta BIOS versions, as well as extend motherboard warranty coverage to uses of AMD EXPO, Intel XMP, and DOCP memory overclocking technologies.[103][104]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Taiwan portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* ASRock\n* Biostar\n* DFI\n* Elitegroup Computer Systems\n* EVGA Corporation\n* Fastra II\n* Gigabyte Technology\n* Micro-Star International\n* List of companies of Taiwan\n* List of wireless router firmware projects\n* Tomato (firmware)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"ASUSTek Computer Inc.
