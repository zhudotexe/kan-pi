He is arguably the tallest player to have ever played in the NBA, at 7\u00a0feet 7\u00a0inches (2.31\u00a0m).[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an was born in Tritenii de Jos,[4][5] Cluj County, Romania. Although his parents' heights were relatively typical, he grew to his remarkable height due to a pituitary gland disorder called acromegaly.[6]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### CS Universitatea Cluj-Napoca (1991\u20131992)[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an played competitive basketball at Universitatea Cluj, becoming national champion in 1992.[7][8]\n\n\n\n### \u00c9lan B\u00e9arnais Pau-Orthez (1992\u20131993)[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an played professionally in the French league with Pau-Orthez during the 1992\u201393 season and was an instant hit with fans, also managing to win the French League Cup.[7]\n\n\n\n### Washington Bullets / Wizards (1993\u20131998)[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an was selected by the NBA's Washington Bullets in the 1993 NBA draft.[9] He played in the NBA from 1993 to 2000 showing signs of a promising career that was derailed by injuries. His best season came in the 1995\u20131996 campaign, when he averaged 14.5 points per game.\n\n\nMure\u0219an was named the NBA's Most Improved Player for the 1995\u201396 season after averaging 14.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, 2.26 blocks per game while making a league-leading 58.4 percent of his field goals. He led in field goal percentage again the following season, with a 60.4% average. Overall, he holds career averages of 9.8 points, 6.4 rebounds, 0.5 assists, 1.48 blocks per game and a .573 field goal percentage.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### New Jersey Nets (1999\u20132000)[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an joined the New Jersey Nets for the final 31 games of his NBA career.\n\n\n\n### Return to Pau-Orthez (2000\u20132001)[edit]\n\n\nAfter ending his NBA career, Mure\u0219an had another stint at Pau-Orthez where he won the French league before returning to the United States with his family.[7] He normally wore number 77, in reference to his height.\n\n\nOn 11 March 2007, Mure\u0219an played a game for the Maryland Nighthawks as part of the tallest lineup in the history of basketball.[10] This was the only basketball game Mure\u0219an played where he was not the tallest person on the court, as Sun Mingming is 7\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in (2.36\u00a0m).\n\n\n\n## Other work[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mure\u0219an meeting with Nicholas F. Taubman, the U.S. Ambassador to Romania\nIn 2004, Mure\u0219an founded the Giant Basketball Academy (GBA), a program dedicated to teaching the proper fundamentals of basketball to boys and girls of all ages.[11][6] The Academy is located in Ashburn, Virginia.[12]\n\n\nMure\u0219an is also part of the Washington Wizards marketing and public relations team,[6] serving as an \"ambassador\" for the team.[13]\n\n\nOutside basketball, Mure\u0219an has dabbled in acting, playing the title character in 1998 feature film *My Giant* starring comedian Billy Crystal.[14] He appeared as a ventriloquist in the music video for Eminem's breakthrough single \"My Name Is.\" He has appeared in commercials for Snickers candy bars, and sports television network ESPN. Most recently, Mure\u0219an co-authored two young adult fitness and health books: *The Boy's Fitness Guide* and *The Girl's Fitness Guide*.[15]\n\n\nIn 2013, Mure\u0219an participated in the first annual 3v3 UMTTR (You Matter) Basketball Tournament to increase awareness, prevention and research of teen suicide, the leading cause of death among adults and children between the ages of 15 and 24.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an and his wife Liliana and sons George and Victor have resided in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey,[16] but they relocated to the suburbs of Washington, D.C.[17] Since the 2016\u20132017 season, his oldest son, George, has played for the Georgetown University Hoyas as a walk-on forward. His younger son Victor joined the Hoyas as a walk-on in the 2020\u20132021 season. Victor is 6'10\" and 190 pounds.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n | \u00a0\u00a0GS\u00a0\n | Games started\n | \u00a0MPG\u00a0\n | Minutes per game\n |\n| \u00a0FG%\u00a0\n | Field goal percentage\n | \u00a03P%\u00a0\n | 3-point field goal percentage\n | \u00a0FT%\u00a0\n | Free throw percentage\n |\n| \u00a0RPG\u00a0\n | Rebounds per game\n | \u00a0APG\u00a0\n | Assists per game\n | \u00a0SPG\u00a0\n | Steals per game\n |\n| \u00a0BPG\u00a0\n | Blocks per game\n | \u00a0PPG\u00a0\n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n| \u00a0\\*\u00a0\n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### NBA[edit]\n\n\n#### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1993\u201394 | Washington | 54 | 2 | 12.0 | .545 | .000 | .676 | 3.6 | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.9 | 5.6\n |\n| 1994\u201395 | Washington | 73 | 58 | 23.6 | .560 | .000 | **.709** | 6.7 | 0.5 | 0.7 | 1.7 | 10.0\n |\n| 1995\u201396 | Washington | **76** | **76** | **29.5** | .584\\* | .000 | .619 | **9.6** | **0.7** | **0.7** | **2.3** | **14.5** |\n| 1996\u201397 | Washington | 73 | 69 | 25.3 | **.604\\*** | .000 | .618 | 6.6 | 0.4 | 0.6 | 1.3 | 10.6\n |\n| 1998\u201399 | New Jersey | 1 | 0 | 1.0 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\n |\n| 1999\u201300 | New Jersey | 30 | 2 | 8.9 | .456 | .000 | .605 | 2.3 | 0.3 | 0.0 | 0.4 | 3.5\n |\n| **Career** | 307 | 207 | 21.9 | .573 | .000 | .644 | 6.4 | 0.5 | 0.6 | 1.5 | 9.8\n |\n\n\n#### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1997 | Washington | 3 | 3 | 23.3 | .444 | \u2013 | .875 | 6.0 | .0 | .0 | 1.3 | 5.0\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n\n\n* List of tallest players in National Basketball Association history\n* List of tallest people\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Gheorghe Mure\u0219an\".

Listed at 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m)[1] or 7\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in (2.31\u00a0m)[2] tall, Bol was one of the tallest players in the history of the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\n\nAfter he played college basketball for the Bridgeport Purple Knights, Bol was selected by the Washington Bullets in the 1985 NBA draft. Bol played for the Bullets and three other teams over the course of his NBA career, which lasted from 1985 to 1995. A center, Bol is considered among the best shot-blockers in the history of the sport and is the only NBA player to retire with more career blocked shots than points scored. As of December 2022[update], he ranked second in NBA history in blocked shots per game and 16th in total blocked shots.\n\n\nBol was notable for his efforts to promote human rights in his native Sudan and aid for Sudanese refugees.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nManute Bol was born to Madute and Okwok Bol in Turalei, Sudan (now South Sudan), and raised near Gogrial. Bol's father, a Dinka tribal elder, gave him the name Manute, which means \"special blessing\".[4] Bol had no formal record of his birthdate.[5][6][7]\n\n\nBol came from a family of extraordinarily tall men and women. He said: \"My mother was 6\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (2.08\u00a0m), my father 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m), and my sister is 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m). And my great-grandfather was even taller\u20147\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (2.39\u00a0m).\" His ethnic group, the Dinka, and the Nilotic people[8] of which they are a part, are among the tallest populations in the world. Bol's hometown, Turalei, is the origin of other exceptionally tall people, including 7 foot 3\u00bd inches tall (2.22 meters) basketball player Ring Ayuel.[9] \"I was born in a village where you cannot measure yourself,\" Bol reflected. \"I learned I was 7 foot 7 in 1979, when I was grown. I was about 18 or 19.\"[10]\n\n\nBol started playing soccer in 1972 but abandoned the game because he was too tall.[11] During his later teens, Bol started playing basketball in Sudan, for several years with teams in Wau and Khartoum, where he experienced prejudice from the northern Sudanese majority.[12]\n\n\n\n## Early basketball career[edit]\n\n\nCoach Don Feeley, formerly the basketball coach at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, traveled to Sudan to coach and held clinics for the Sudanese national team in 1982. Feeley convinced Bol to go to the United States and play basketball.[13][14]\n\n\nWith Feeley's input, Bol first landed in Cleveland. According to Cleveland State University basketball coach Kevin Mackey, Bol could not provide a record of his birth date. Mackey listed it as October 16, 1962, on Cleveland State documents, but believed Bol was actually much older.[5][6][7] Bol did not speak or write English at the time of his arrival in Cleveland. He improved his English skills after months of classes at ESL Language Centers at Case Western Reserve University, but not enough to qualify for enrollment at Cleveland State. Bol never played a game for Cleveland State. Five years later, Cleveland State was placed on two years' probation for providing improper financial assistance to Bol and two other African players.[15][16]\n\n\nAgain with Feeley's influence, Bol declared his intention to play professionally in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The San Diego Clippers drafted him in the 1983 NBA draft as the 97th overall pick. Clippers head coach Jim Lynam received a call about Bol from Feeley, whom he knew from coaching circles. \"So, I said, 'Have you told anyone else about this?'\" Lynam recalled. \"Feeley said the only one in the NBA he had called was Frank Layden at Utah. He said Frank said he couldn't take another big guy like this. He already had Mark Eaton. I was the second guy Feeley had called. I told him he didn't have to call anyone else.\"[17]\n\n\nAfter the June 1983 draft, Lynam traveled to Cleveland and watched Bol play pickup games. In speaking with Bol, through a fellow Sudanese player, Lynam learned that he had become hesitant about playing professionally because he did not know the language well enough to understand coaches.[17] Lynam said, \"One of the things everyone was looking at was his passport. His passport said he was 19 years old. His passport also said he was five feet two.\" When Lynam asked Bol about the discrepancy between his real height and his passport height, Bol said he had been sitting down when measured by Sudan officials.[17]\n\n\nLanguage and passport concerns were set aside when the NBA ruled that Bol had not been eligible for the draft as he had not declared 45 days before the draft as required and declared the pick invalid.[18][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nWith the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) questioning his eligibility for NCAA Division I basketball, Bol enrolled at the University of Bridgeport, an NCAA Division II school with an English program for foreign students. He played for the Purple Knights in the 1984\u201385 season. His coach was Bruce Webster, a friend of Feeley. Bol averaged 22.5 points, 13.5 rebounds, and 7.1 blocks per game for the Purple Knights. The team, which previously drew 500\u2013600 spectators, routinely sold out the 1,800-seat gym.[18] With Bol, Bridgeport qualified for the 1985 NCAA Division II men's basketball tournament.[16]\n\n\n\n## Professional basketball career[edit]\n\n\nBol turned professional in May 1985, signing with the Rhode Island Gulls of the spring United States Basketball League.[19][20][21] Going into the 1985 NBA draft, scouts believed that Bol needed another year or two of college, but Bol opted for the draft because he felt it was the only way to earn enough money to get his sister out of Sudan, which was in a state of political unrest at the time.[18]\n\n\n\n### Washington Bullets (1985\u20131988)[edit]\n\n\nThe Washington Bullets drafted Bol in the second round as the 31st overall in the draft.[22] Bol's first tenure with the Bullets lasted three seasons, from 1985 to 1988. In his rookie season (1985\u20131986), he appeared in 80 games and recorded a career-high 5.0 blocks per game. That year, during his first career start on December 12, Bol set a Washington franchise record with 12 blocks and scored a career high 18 points in a 110\u2013108 overtime victory against the Milwaukee Bucks.[23] His total of 397 blocks set the NBA rookie record and remains the second-highest single-season total in league history, behind Mark Eaton's 456 in 1984\u201385.[22][24][25]\n\n\nWhen he arrived in the United States, Bol weighed 180 pounds (82\u00a0kg)[26] and had gained just under 20 pounds (9.1\u00a0kg) by the time he entered the NBA. The Bullets sent Bol to strength training with University of Maryland coach Frank Costello, where he could initially lift only 44 pounds (20\u00a0kg) on 10-repetition bench press and 55 pounds (25\u00a0kg) on 10-repetition squat[27] (his body mass index was 15.3 and he initially had a 31\" (80\u00a0cm) waist).[28] In 1987, the Bullets drafted the 5\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in (1.60\u00a0m) point guard Muggsy Bogues, pairing the tallest and shortest players in the league on the court for one season.[29][22][30]\n\n\n\n### Golden State Warriors (1988\u20131990)[edit]\n\n\nOn June 8, 1988, Bol was traded by the Bullets to the Golden State Warriors for Dave Feitl and a 1989 second round draft pick (Doug Roth was later selected).[22]\n\n\nBol's first tenure with the Warriors lasted two seasons, from 1988 to 1990. In his first season with Golden State, he attempted three-point shots with regularity. In that season he attempted a career-high 91 three-pointers and made 20 of them. During this time, he may have helped to popularize the expression \"my bad\", although a 2005 suggestion that he coined the phrase has been discounted.[31][32]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia 76ers (1990\u20131993)[edit]\n\n\nOn August 1, 1990, Golden State traded Bol to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 1991 first round draft pick (Chris Gatling was later selected).[22]\n\n\nBol's first tenure with the Philadelphia 76ers lasted three seasons, from 1990 to 1993. He played a career-high 82 games in his first season as a 76er, but his production began to decline afterward (in both games played and per-game statistics). After playing in all 82 games in 1990\u201391, he played in 71 games the next season, and in 58 (a career low at the time) games the following season. During his last season in Philadelphia, he had a memorable night playing against former teammate Charles Barkley and the Phoenix Suns, hitting 6 of 12 three-pointers, all in the second half in a losing effort.[33] Fans were known to yell \"shoot\" as soon as Bol received the ball far from the basket.[34]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (1993)[edit]\n\n\nReleased by Philadelphia, Bol played in eight games in the 1993\u201394 season with the Miami Heat, the only team that did not use him as a starter. He scored only one two-point field goal with the team and blocked six shots in 61 total minutes.[35]\n\n\n\n### Washington Bullets (1993)[edit]\n\n\nReleased by Miami, Bol's second stint with the Bullets lasted only two games in 1993\u201394. After that, he helped develop 7\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in (2.31\u00a0m) teammate Gheorghe Mure\u0219an.[35]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia 76ers (1994)[edit]\n\n\nAfter his release by Miami, Bol's second stint with the 76ers lasted four games, near the end of the 1993\u201394 season, helping to mentor 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m) teammate Shawn Bradley. In only 49 minutes, he played more aggressively than he did earlier in the season with Miami and Washington. He scored six points, grabbed six rebounds and blocked nine shots.[35]\n\n\n\n### Return to Golden State Warriors (1994)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1994\u201395 NBA season Bol returned to the Warriors. He made the season-opening roster and played his last five NBA games. On a memorable mid-November night Bol finally made his home debut, coming off of the bench to play 29 minutes against the Minnesota Timberwolves. He attempted three three-pointers in the fourth quarter and made them all.[36] Seven nights later in Charlotte, in a game nationally televised by TNT, he was in the starting lineup again. By this time, two weeks into the season, his career seemed rejuvenated under Warrior head coach Don Nelson; he was again a defensive force, making threes and contributing as a starter to create matchup problems. After playing only ten minutes against the Hornets on November 22, 1994, he suffered a season-ending knee injury. Before he left the game, he recorded one block and two points and attempted a three-pointer in ten minutes of play.[36]\n\n\nBol was waived by Golden State on February 15, 1995.[35]\n\n\nOverall in his NBA career, Bol averaged 2.6 points, 4.2 rebounds, 0.3 assists, and 3.3 blocks per game, playing an average of 18.7 minutes. He finished his career with 1,599 points, 2,647 rebounds, and 2,086 blocks. He appeared in 624 games over 10 seasons.[37]\n\n\n\n### Florida Beach Dogs (1995\u20131996)[edit]\n\n\nBol played 22 games for the Florida Beach Dogs of the Continental Basketball Association during the 1995\u201396 season under Coach Eric Musselman. The Beach Dogs' games against the Sioux Falls Skyforce that season were broadcast by ESPN, as the Skyforce also featured a former NBA player, Darryl Dawkins.[38]\n\n\nIn 1996, the Portland Mountain Cats of the United States Basketball League announced that Bol would be playing with the team, but he never appeared in uniform.[38][39]\n\n\n\n### Fulgor Libertas Forl\u00ec (1996\u20131997)[edit]\n\n\nBol played professionally in Italy in 1997 and Qatar in 1998 before rheumatism forced him to retire permanently.[38]\n\n\n\n## Player profile and accomplishments[edit]\n\n\nBol and Gheorghe Mure\u0219an are the two tallest players in the history of the National Basketball Association.[40] Official NBA publications have listed Bol at either 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m)[1] or 7\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in (2.31\u00a0m)[2] tall. He was measured by the Guinness Book of World Records at 7\u00a0ft 6 3\u20444\u00a0in tall.[41] Complementing his great height, Bol had exceptionally long limbs (inseam 49 inches (120\u00a0cm)) and large hands and feet (size 16 1/2). His arm span, at 8\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (2.59\u00a0m), is (as of 2023[update]) the longest in NBA history, and his upward reach was 10\u00a0feet 5\u00a0inches (3.18\u00a0m).[42][43] He was extremely slender, limiting his offensive capability.\n\n\nWith his great height and very long limbs, Bol was one of the NBA's most imposing defensive presences. Along with setting the rookie shot-blocking record in 1985\u201386, Bol later tied the NBA record for most blocked shots in one half (11) and in one quarter (eight, twice).[44] On January 31, 1992, in a game against the Orlando Magic, he blocked four consecutive shots in a single possession.[45] On average, he blocked one shot per every 5.6 minutes of playing time.[38]\nBol's other basketball skills, however, were very limited. His rail-thin physique made it difficult for him to establish position against the league's bulkier centers and power forwards, and he also suffered from a claw hand on his right hand (his natural hand), which severely affected his shooting and ball-handling abilities. To compensate for this inherited deformity on his right hand, Bol learned to dribble, block shots and rebound with his (non-dominant) left hand.[46]\n\n\nOff the court, Bol established a reputation as a practical joker; Charles Barkley, a frequent victim of his pranks, has attested to Bol's sense of humor.[47] Bol's one-time assistant coach Garry St. Jean recounted that Bol was fond of branding his teammates with humorous nicknames, such as \"Chalk\" for his Warriors teammate Chris Mullin (as a nod to Mullin's pale complexion). Bol developed a close friendship with Mullin and named one of his sons after him.\n\n\nNevertheless, Bol was reportedly short-tempered and sensitive to the frequent remarks or questions about his extreme height; on one occasion, when an elderly woman in an airport approached the towering Bol and asked \"how tall are you?\", Bol angrily retorted \"I didn't ask *you* how fat you are!\"[48]\n\n\nAs of 2023[update], Bol remains:\n\n\n\n* First in career blocks per 48 minutes (8.6), almost 50% beyond second-place Mark Eaton (5.8).[49]\n* Second in career blocks-per-game average (3.34).[50]\n* Eighteenth in total blocked shots (2,086).[51]\n* The only player in NBA history to have more blocked shots than points scored.[52][53]\n\n\n## Humanitarian efforts and activism[edit]\n\n\nBol was active in charitable causes during and after his basketball career. He said he spent much of the money he made during his NBA career supporting various causes related to the war-ravaged nation of his birth, Sudan.[54]\n\n\nBol frequently visited Sudanese refugee camps, where he was treated like royalty. In 2001 the Sudanese government offered him the post of minister of sport. Bol, a Christian,[55] refused because one of the conditions was converting to Islam.[56]\n\n\nLater, the Sudanese government hindered Bol from leaving the country, accusing him of supporting the Dinka-led Christian rebels, the Sudan People's Liberation Army. It refused to grant him an exit visa unless he came back with more money. Assistance from supporters in the United States, including Senator Joseph Lieberman, raised money to provide Bol with plane tickets to Cairo, Egypt. After six months of negotiations with U.S. consulate officials regarding refugee status, Bol and his family were finally able to leave Egypt and return to the United States.[56] He was admitted to the United States as a religious refugee in 2002 and settled in West Hartford, Connecticut.[42]\n\n\nBol established the Ring True Foundation to continue fund-raising for Sudanese refugees. He gave most of his earnings (an estimated $3.5 million) to their cause. In 2002 Fox TV agreed to broadcast the foundation's phone number in exchange for Bol's agreement to appear on their *Celebrity Boxing* show. After the referee goaded, \"If you guys don't box, you won't get paid\", he scored a third-round victory over former football player William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry.\n\n\nIn the fall of 2002, Bol signed a one-day contract with the Indianapolis Ice of the Central Hockey League. Though he could not skate, the publicity generated by his single-game appearance helped raise money to assist children in Sudan.[57] Bol once suited up as a horse jockey for similar reasons.\n\n\nBol was involved in the April 2006 Sudan Freedom Walk, a three-week march from the United Nations building in New York City to the United States Capitol in Washington, DC. The event was organized by Simon Deng, a former Sudanese swimming champion who was a longtime friend of Bol's. Deng, who was enslaved from age 9 to 12, is from another tribe in Southern Sudan. His Sudan Freedom Walk focused on finding a solution to the genocide in Darfur (western Sudan) but also sought to raise awareness of the modern-day slavery and human-rights abuses throughout Sudan. Bol spoke in New York City at the start of the walk, and in Philadelphia at a rally organized by former hunger striker Nathan Kleinman.\n\n\nBol was also an advocate for reconciliation efforts, and worked to improve education in South Sudan. A Nicholas Kristof article[58] in *The New York Times* highlighted Bol's work for reconciliation and education with an organization called Sudan Sunrise. Bol first began working with Sudan Sunrise to raise awareness on issues of reconciliation in 2005. This included speaking at the United States Capitol and subsequently partnering with Sudan Sunrise to build schools across South Sudan that, in the spirit of reconciliation, would enroll students regardless of tribe or religion.[59]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBol had six children with his first wife, Atong, and four with his second wife, Ajok.[60] Bol's son Madut (born December 19, 1989) played college basketball at Southern University and graduated in 2013.[61] Another son, Bol Bol (born November 16, 1999), played for the Oregon Ducks in 2018\u201319. Bol Bol was taken 44th overall in the 2019 NBA draft by the Miami Heat and was subsequently traded to the Denver Nuggets. He currently plays for the Phoenix Suns.\n\n\nBol spoke Dinka and Arabic before learning English.[62]\n\n\nDespite initially knowing little English or Western culture upon arriving in the United States, Bol adjusted and was widely regarded as well-rounded, inquisitive, and well-read. He developed a strong friendship with Charles Barkley, who remarked, \"If everyone in the world was a Manute Bol, it's a world I'd want to live in. He's smart. He reads *The New York Times*. He knows what's going on in a lot of subjects. He's not one of these just-basketball guys\".[63] Bol was a Catholic.[64]\n\n\nDuring his time in Egypt, Bol ran a basketball school in Cairo. One of his pupils was a fellow Sudanese refugee, former NBA player Luol Deng, the son of a former Sudanese cabinet minister. Deng later moved to the United States to further his basketball career, maintaining a close relationship with Bol.[65]\n\n\nIn July 2004, Bol was seriously injured in a car accident in Colchester, Connecticut; he was ejected from a taxi that hit a guardrail and overturned, resulting in a broken neck.[66] The driver was under the influence, with a suspended license.[67] Because his fortunes were mostly donated to Sudan, he was financially ruined because he had no health insurance.[45] When he recovered from his injuries, he moved to Olathe, Kansas.[42]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\nOn June 19, 2010, Bol died from acute kidney failure and complications from Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome at the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville, Virginia. He was 47.[42][68] He is buried in South Sudan.[69]\n\n\n\n### Funeral service and tributes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bol's memorial service at the Washington National Cathedral\nBol's memorial service was held on June 29, 2010, at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, DC. His body lay in an eight-foot-long, specially-built casket.[70]\n\n\nAfter his death, tributes to Bol's career and charitable works came from around the United States and the world.[71][72][73] His former teams, and the NBA, issued statements in recognition of his impact on the sport of basketball and on Sudan.[74][75][76] U.S. Senator Sam Brownback paid tribute to Bol on the floor of the United States Senate.[77]\n\n\nBol was also given tributes by former National Security Advisor Robert McFarlane, Sudan's Ambassador to the United States Akec Khoc Acieu, and vice president of the National Basketball Players Association Rory Sparrow.[70] Sparrow called Bol \"a giant off the court\" who should be remembered for humanitarian work and his basketball career.[70] Brownback recalled, \"He literally gave his life for his people. He went over [to Sudan], he was sick. He stayed longer than he should have. He probably contracted this ailment that took his life while in Sudan, and he didn't have to do that. He was an NBA basketball player. He could have stayed here and had an easy life. I've never seen anybody use his celebrity status more nor give his life more completely to a group of people than Manute Bol did. It makes me look at efforts that I do as not enough.\"\n\n\nAmbassador Khoc said, \"Manute had a very great heart for his country and people. He did everything to support anybody in need of shoes, blankets, health service, food, and people who were struggling. He went to see them and to encourage them to continue their struggle for their rights, for their freedoms. Manute embodied everything we can think of in Sudan. Reconciling warring groups between the north and south, in Darfur he was working for reconciliation between Darfur and the south and between Darfur and the rest of Sudan. So Manute was a voice for hope.\"\n\n\nSudan Sunrise founder Tom Prichard said that Bol's work to reconcile former enemies lives on. \"Manute's legacy and vision of education and reconciliation, his determination to grow grassroots reconciliation\u2014whether that reconciliation is expressed in a country that divides or holds together, wherever the boundary lines are drawn. Manute stood for grassroots reconciliation.\"[78] He added, \"There's no question Manute gave his life for his country.\"[79]\n\n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\n* Bol was inducted into the University of Bridgeport Athletics Hall of Fame, Class of 2010.[80]\n* On January 27, 2015, the Golden State Warriors honored Bol with a Manute Bol bobble head giveaway. The team sponsored a giveaway of 10,000 of the tallest bobble heads in franchise history, at 10 inches.[81][82]\n* The \"Manute Bol Court\" was built and constructed in South Sudan by the Luol Deng Foundation in 2015.[83][84]\n* The Manute Bol Peace Builders Basketball Tournament is held annually throughout Sudan.[85]\n* In 2016, Bol was inducted into the Fairfield County Sports Hall of Fame.[86][87]\n\n\n## Influence[edit]\n\n\nAt the peak of his career, Bol was so widely recognizable in pop culture as to become the object of teasing in a 1993 episode of MTV's *Beavis and Butthead* entitled \"True Crime'\". While watching a music video of the song \"Demolition Man\" by Grace Jones, Butthead mistakes the tall, androgynous Jones for Bol and asks, \"Is this Manute Bol?\" Beavis responds, \"Yeah.

He moved to the United States at age 16 and later played college basketball for the University of Central Florida (UCF). Fall went undrafted in the 2019 NBA draft, but later signed with the Boston Celtics. During his two seasons in Boston, he became a fan favorite.[1] He signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers as a free agent in 2021.[2]\n\n\nAt 7\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (2.29 metres), Fall was one of the tallest NBA players and is one of the tallest living humans.[3][4] At the 2019 NBA Draft Combine, his measurements set all-time NBA records for tallest height in shoes (7\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in; 2.31\u00a0m), longest wingspan (8\u00a0ft 2.25\u00a0in; 250\u00a0cm), and highest standing reach (10\u00a0ft 2.5\u00a0in; 3.11\u00a0m).[5] The NBA now lists players' heights without shoes, so Fall is listed at 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m).[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nFall was born and raised in Dakar, Senegal. In 2011, Senegalese basketball coach Ibrahima N'Diaye, the brother of former NBA player Mamadou N'Diaye, heard from a friend about an exceptionally tall teenager he had seen playing with friends in a local street.[8] After identifying him, they visited the 15-year-old Fall\u2014who already stood 7\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in (2.21\u00a0m) tall\u2014at his home and persuaded Fall's mother, Marianne Diop Sene, to allow Fall to start attending N'Diaye's basketball academy.[8] Fall moved to the United States at age 16. He first played organized basketball in Houston, Texas, and trained with NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon.[9]\n\n\nHe was listed as 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m) and was purportedly still growing around his senior year, making him the tallest high school basketball player in the country while he played for Jamie's House Charter and Liberty Christian Prep.[10]\n\n\nDue to his height and reach, Fall was one of the most highly scouted high school basketball centers in the nation.[*citation needed*] Fall first played for Jamie's House Charter School in Houston, where his team won the state championship. Fall played with ISTI all-stars summer travel team & for Each 1 Teach 1 on the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League (EYBL) circuit where he played alongside fellow class of 2015 recruits Antonio Blakeney and Ben Simmons.[11] He also played in several NCAA certified events, including the NBPA Top 100 Camp in Virginia.[12] Fall then attended Liberty Christian Preparatory School in Tavares, Florida. As a senior in 2015, Fall averaged 20 points, 15 rebounds, and 5.1 blocks per game. Rated as a four-star and three-star recruit in the 2015 high school class[13][14][15] and nearly forty different schools expressing interest in him,[10] Fall committed to the University of Central Florida in Orlando, who officially signed him on October 28, 2014. He played with the UCF Knights under head coach Donnie Jones.[16]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fall at UCF in 2017\nFall played college basketball at University of Central Florida for Knights as a center. He faced fellow giant Senegalese center Mamadou N'Diaye (unrelated to the former NBA player of the same name), who stands at 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m), in the tallest tip-off and match-up in US college basketball history in a game against University of California Irvine. Both men come from the same city, Dakar. By his sophomore year, after N'Diaye declared for the 2016 NBA draft, Fall became the tallest player in college basketball. During his sophomore season, Fall would make considerable improvements in his playing style.[*citation needed*] In 2017, Fall was named American Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year.[17]\n\n\nFall grew to be an efficient player, ranking second nationally in field goal percentage as of January 2017.[18] On April 5, 2017, Fall declared for the 2017 NBA draft, with the possibility of returning to Central Florida still available to him before the end of the draft lottery that year.[19][20] On May 24, 2017, Fall withdrew his name from consideration for the NBA draft, to return to UCF for his junior year.[21] During his junior year, Fall injured his shoulder,[22] causing him to only play in 16 games, totaling 351 minutes.[23] Coming into his senior season, Fall was named to the Preseason Second Team All-AAC. During his senior season, Fall helped lead the Knights to the 2019 NCAA tournament and secured their first victory in program history with a win over Virginia Commonwealth University.[24] In his final game, Fall recorded 15 points and six rebounds in a losing effort against Duke University 77\u201376.[25]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\nAfter the conclusion of his senior year, Fall was named one of 80 participants (40 representing the NBA draft hopefuls) for the NBA G League Elite Camp on May 12\u201314.[26] By the end of the event, Fall later got transferred into the NBA Draft Combine as one of an additional 11 participants there.[27] During the combine, he put up new records at the event, including height (which received comparisons to former NBA player Manute Bol),[28] wingspan, and standing reach.[29]\n\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (2019\u20132021)[edit]\n\n\nDespite going undrafted in the 2019 NBA draft, Fall was signed to an Exhibit 10 Contract on June 21, 2019, by the Boston Celtics.[30][31] Fall played for the Celtics during the 2019 NBA Summer League season,[32] scoring six points in his first game alongside four rebounds; in his second game he tallied twelve points for his first double-digit scoring game, alongside another rebound. He had one blocked shot in each of his first two games.[33] Fall concluded his 2019 Summer League run participating in all five games with the Celtics and averaging 7.2 points, 4.0 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, and shooting a team-high 77 percent from the field.[34]\n\n\nOn July 25, 2019, the Celtics officially announced that they had signed Fall.[35] On October 13, 2019, the Celtics officially announced that they had signed Fall to a two-way contract, splitting time between the Celtics and Maine Red Claws.[36] Fall made his debut for the Celtics on October 26 during a game against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. He played for four minutes, scoring four points and grabbing three rebounds, with his first points coming from a standing dunk.[37] On December 20, Fall recorded a season-high five points, along with two rebounds and one block, in a 114\u201393 win over the Detroit Pistons.[38] On August 13, 2020, he logged season-highs of four rebounds and two blocks in a 90\u201396 loss to the Washington Wizards.[39] Fall led the Celtics in field goal percentage during the 2019\u201320 season.\n\n\nIn the G League for the Red Claws, Fall averaged a double-double of 12.9 points and 11.1 rebounds per game. He earned All-Defensive Team honors, with averages of nearly three blocks per game.[40][41]\n\n\nOn November 23, 2020, Fall re-signed with the Boston Celtics on a two-way contract, allowing him to play for the Celtics and Maine Red Claws in the 2020\u201321 season.[42][43] On December 30, he made his season debut for the Celtics, recording two points, one rebound and two blocks in a 126\u2013107 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.[44] On January 15, 2021, Fall logged a season-high six points, along with five rebounds and one block, in a 124\u201397 blowout win over the Orlando Magic.[45] On May 5, he recorded a season-high four blocks in a 132\u201396 blowout win over the Orlando Magic.[46] On May 16, he grabbed a season-high eight rebounds in a 92\u201396 loss to the New York Knicks.[47] Despite being under a two-way contract, Fall never played in the G League during the 2020\u201321 season due to the Red Claws not playing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[48] He also led the Celtics in field goal percentage for the second season in a row.\n\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers (2021\u20132022)[edit]\n\n\nOn September 27, 2021, Fall signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers.[2] On October 16, his deal was converted to a two-way contract with the Cleveland Charge.[49] On November 11, Fall made his debut for the Charge, logging a G League career-high 23 points along with 12 rebounds and three blocks in 29 minutes of play.[50] On December 22, Fall made his first career NBA start in a 111\u2013101 loss to the Boston Celtics, where he grabbed a career-high 10 rebounds and a season-high 4 points. On January 9, 2022, he was waived by the Cavaliers.[51]\n\n\n\n### Cleveland Charge (2022)[edit]\n\n\nOn January 12, 2022, Fall was re-acquired by the Cleveland Charge.[52]\n\n\n\n### Xinjiang Flying Tigers (2022\u20132023)[edit]\n\n\nOn August 24, 2022, Fall signed a one-year contract to play for the Xinjiang Flying Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association.[53]\n\n\nOn June 30, 2023, Fall was signed to the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 summer league roster.[54][55]\n\n\n\n### Nanjing Monkey Kings[edit]\n\n\nOn August 17, 2023, Fall signed with the Nanjing Monkey Kings.[56]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\nGiven his size, Fall plays the center position. His shoe size is 22 and his wingspan is 8\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (2.54\u00a0m)[57] and a standing reach of 10\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in (3.10\u00a0m).[18] He also has a max vertical leap of 2\u00a0ft 2.5\u00a0in (0.67\u00a0m). Fall's hands measure at 10.5 inches in length and width.[58]\n\n\nGoing into the 2019 NBA draft, Fall was viewed as a great shot blocker who was relatively lacking in lane agility and three-quarter-court sprinting speed.[59]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n | \u00a0\u00a0GS\u00a0\n | Games started\n | \u00a0MPG\u00a0\n | Minutes per game\n |\n| \u00a0FG%\u00a0\n | Field goal percentage\n | \u00a03P%\u00a0\n | 3-point field goal percentage\n | \u00a0FT%\u00a0\n | Free throw percentage\n |\n| \u00a0RPG\u00a0\n | Rebounds per game\n | \u00a0APG\u00a0\n | Assists per game\n | \u00a0SPG\u00a0\n | Steals per game\n |\n| \u00a0BPG\u00a0\n | Blocks per game\n | \u00a0PPG\u00a0\n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n\n\n### NBA[edit]\n\n\nSource[60]\n\n\n\n#### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019\u201320 | Boston | 7 | 0 | 4.7 | **.786** | \u2014 | **.333** | 2.1 | .1 | .1 | .6 | **3.3** |\n| 2020\u201321 | Boston | **19** | 0 | **7.2** | .724 | \u2014 | **.333** | **2.7** | **.2** | .1 | **1.1** | 2.5\n |\n| 2021\u201322 | Cleveland | 11 | **1** | 5.4 | .417 | \u2014 | .286 | 2.1 | **.2** | .0 | .5 | 1.1\n |\n| Career\n | 37 | 1 | 6.2 | .673 | \u2014 | .320 | 2.4 | .2 | .1 | .8 | 2.2\n |\n\n\n#### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2020 | Boston | **2** | 0 | **1.5** | **1.000** | \u2014 | **.500** | .5 | .0 | .0 | .0 | **1.5** |\n| 2021 | Boston | 1 | 0 | 1.0 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | **1.0** | .0 | .0 | .0 | .0\n |\n| Career\n | 3 | 0 | 1.3 | 1.000 | \u2014 | .500 | .7 | .0 | .0 | .0 | 1.0\n |\n\n\n### College[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2015\u201316 | UCF | 30 | 26 | 17.6 | .750 | \u2014 | **.558** | 5.9 | .3 | .1 | 2.3 | 7.4\n |\n| 2016\u201317 | UCF | **36** | **36** | **26.3** | .715 | .000 | .462 | **9.5** | **.6** | **.3** | **2.6** | 10.9\n |\n| 2017\u201318 | UCF | 16 | 15 | 21.9 | **.767** | \u2014 | .460 | 7.3 | .3 | **.3** | 1.9 | **11.3** |\n| 2018\u201319 | UCF | 32 | 32 | 24.9 | .750 | \u2014 | .363 | 7.7 | .5 | **.3** | **2.6** | 11.0\n |\n| Career\n | 115 | 110 | 23.0 | .740 | .000 | .432 | 7.7 | .4 | .2 | 2.4 | 10.1\n |\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nFall is a Muslim,[3] and selected the jersey number 99 with the Celtics as a reference to the 99 Names of Allah.[61] He is not the only tall member of his family; his younger brother was reportedly 5\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in (1.75\u00a0m) at age 7, while two of his uncles are 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m), but his extreme height stands apart even among them.[*citation needed*] He maintained a 4.0 grade point average (GPA) in high school,[62] while taking advanced mathematics and science classes. He became fluent in English within eight months and scored in the 95th percentile on the SAT. He was a computer science major at UCF[18] and originally had aspirations of becoming an engineer for electronic companies such as Siemens or Microsoft.[3]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Tacko Fall earns two-way contract with Cavs after solid preseason\". *NBC Sports*.

He also represented the Montenegrin national basketball team in the international competitions. Standing at 2.29\u00a0m (7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in),[1][2][3] he was one of the tallest players in the world.\n\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\nVrane\u0161 started playing basketball in the Serbian club FMP \u017deleznik. Still a junior, he was snapped up by the Turkish club Efes Pilsen for the 2000\u201301 season. Then he returned to his native country in January 2001,[4] where he played for Budu\u0107nost Podgorica until the summer of 2003.\n\n\nVrane\u0161 was selected by the National Basketball Association's New York Knicks in the second round of the 2003 NBA draft.[5][6][7] He was waived by the Knicks in December 2003 before ever playing a game for them.[8] In early January 2004, he signed a ten-day contract with Portland Trail Blazers. Before his contract expired, he played one game in the 2003\u201304 NBA season.\n\n\nThat one game for Portland ended up being Vrane\u0161 first and only game in the NBA. The game took place on January 8, 2004, in a 75\u201396 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves where Vrane\u0161 played for 3 minutes and recorded 1 foul and no other stats.[9]\n\n\nAfter that, he played briefly for Crvena zvezda. From 2004 to 2007, he played with Budu\u0107nost Podgorica for the second time in his career. In October 2007, he signed a three-year contract with Partizan.[10]\n\n\nIn October 2011, he signed with Sanaye Petroshimi BC in the Iranian Super League.[11] During 2013, he played with Metalac Valjevo. In October 2013 he signed with Zob Ahan Isfahan.[12]\n\n\nOn February 10, 2015, he re-signed with Metalac Valjevo.[13] On May 8, he left Metalac Valjevo.[14] Later that month, he returned to his former team Petrochimi Bandar Imam of Iran.[15]\n\n\nIn November 2017, he signed with Metalac Valjevo.[16]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of European basketball players in the United States\n* List of Montenegrin NBA players\n* List of tallest players in National Basketball Association history\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Realgm.com profile\n2. **^** ABA League profile\n3. **^** Euroleague.net profile\n4. **^** Vrane\u0161 na\u0161 do 24. godine\n5. **^** Greg Logan (28 June 2003). \"Knicks' Big Catch\". *Newsday*. p.\u00a030.

Nicknamed \"**the Stormin' Mormon**\",[1] Bradley is one of the tallest players in NBA history at 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m). Bradley was born in Landstuhl, West Germany, as his family was stationed at the U.S. military base medical facility, and grew up in Castle Dale, Utah.[2][3] He holds citizenship in both the United States and Germany.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nShawn Bradley was born on March 22, 1972, in Landstuhl, West Germany, where his father was working at a U.S. military hospital. Bradley came from a tall family: his father Reiner Bradley (1949\u20132010) was 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m) tall, and his mother Teresa was 6\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in (1.83\u00a0m).[6] Bradley was already 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m) by the end of junior high school (age 13\u201314), and by the end of his junior year of high school (age 16\u201317) he had grown to 7\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in (2.26\u00a0m), one inch shy of his adult height of 7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.29\u00a0m).[7] In 2018, genetic analysis of Bradley's DNA showed that his great height is not the result of any physical or genetic disorders, but because he happened to inherit a natural but extremely rare combination of the thousands of genetic variants that determine human height.[8]\n\n\nBradley was raised on a farm outside the small town of Castle Dale, Utah.[7] He and his siblings were raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Bradley was a standout basketball, football, and baseball player at Emery High School from 1987 to 1990. He was one of the most successful basketball players in Utah high school history, finishing with career averages of 20.3 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 5.4 blocked shots per game.[9] During his time at the school, Emery compiled a 68\u20134 record and won two state championships. Bradley was named All-State three times and twice earned the season MVP award. In his senior year, he averaged 25 points, 17 rebounds, and 9 blocks per contest. He was named All-American by several national publications, including *Parade Magazine*, *Street and Smith*, *USA Today*, and others. He turned in a strong performance at the McDonald's All-American Game (12 points, 10 rebounds, and 6 blocks), earning the Most Valuable Player award for the West team. As of 2015, Bradley still holds Utah state records for blocked shots in a single game (18), season (209), and career (605).[10]\n\n\n\n## College career and LDS mission[edit]\n\n\nBradley was heavily recruited by many colleges from across the United States, but ultimately decided to play at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. During his freshman season (1990\u201391), he started all 34 games for BYU, averaging 14.8 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. But his main contribution to the team was shot-blocking: he led the entire nation in total blocks (177) and average (5.2 per game)\u2014setting an NCAA freshman record in both categories.[11] In one game against Eastern Kentucky (EKU), Bradley blocked 14 shots, tying the NCAA single-game record set by Navy's David Robinson in 1986. In that same game, Bradley also established a new career high by scoring 29 points.[12]\n\n\nBYU received a bid to the NCAA tournament that season, and Bradley continued his dominant defense. In the first-round game against Virginia, he set a tournament single-game record with 10 blocked shots, leading the Cougars to a 61\u201348 victory.[13] However, he struggled with foul trouble in the second round (he received 5 personal fouls in the game), and BYU lost to Arizona, 76\u201361.[14] Bradley collected several awards and honors for his outstanding freshman season. He was named the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Freshman of the Year, in addition to All-WAC defensive team and newcomer team honors. He was also named Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press (AP)[15]\n\n\nBradley took a two-year leave of absence from BYU from 1991 to 1993 to serve as a full-time missionary for the LDS Church. He was assigned to serve in Sydney, Australia. After his mission, Bradley decided to forgo his final three years of NCAA eligibility and declared for the NBA draft.\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Philadelphia 76ers (1993\u20131995)[edit]\n\n\nBradley entered the 1993 NBA draft as one of the most intriguing and highly debated prospects in the history of the NBA draft. Supporters claimed his tremendous size and surprising athleticism would allow him to dominate the league. Critics argued that he would struggle in the NBA due to his thin build \u2013 listed at just 230 pounds (100\u00a0kg), he was described by Ric Bucher of The Miami Herald as \"rail-thin,\" and Lee Rose, player personnel director for the Milwaukee Bucks at the time, said, \"Size-wise, he'll get pushed around a little bit,\"[16] \u2013 and lack of experience (just one season of college basketball, followed by a two-year hiatus from the sport due to his church mission).[17] Ultimately, he was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with the second overall pick, behind Chris Webber and ahead of Penny Hardaway. Given the novelty of a 7-foot-6 center playing for the 76ers, Bradley was issued jersey number 76.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's management saw Bradley as a major project with huge long-term potential. The team acquired legendary big man Moses Malone to serve as a mentor for Bradley, hoping to develop his skills in the low post.[18] Also, the franchise hired strength and conditioning consultant Pat Croce and registered dietitian Jeanie Subach, as well as assistant coach Jeff Ruland, to add bulk to Bradley's skinny frame.[19] His rookie season (1993\u201394) produced mixed results. In his first game, Bradley totaled just 6 points and 5 rebounds, but he did manage to block 8 shots in 25 minutes.[20]\n\n\nFor much of his career, Bradley was inconsistent in scoring and rebounding, but he always excelled at blocking shots. He averaged 10.3 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks per game in his first season \u2013 good enough to earn NBA All-Rookie Second Team honors. He shot 40.9 percent from the floor and constantly struggled with turnovers and foul trouble. He suffered a season-ending injury in February of that year, dislocating his kneecap in a collision with Portland's Harvey Grant.[21]\n\n\nBradley returned to full strength in his second season, playing in all 82 games for the 76ers. His scoring actually declined slightly (9.5 points per game), but his rebounding and shot-blocking increased. He racked up 274 rejections, setting a franchise record for most blocks in a single season. Bradley gave Philly fans a glimpse of his potential in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers in November, posting career highs of 28 points and 22 rebounds in a 97\u201383 victory. He also tied a career high with 9 blocked shots, and was credited with 9 additional \"intimidations\" as the Clippers were held to their lowest-ever point total against the 76ers.[22] He finished the season in strong fashion, posting 13 double-doubles in his last 17 games.\n\n\n\n### New Jersey Nets (1995\u20131997)[edit]\n\n\nDespite these highlights, Bradley continued to baffle and frustrate Philadelphia with his inconsistent play. Just 12 games into his third season (1995\u201396), the 76ers traded Bradley to the New Jersey Nets for Derrick Coleman. He played the final 67 games of the year with the Nets, and tantalized Nets fans with some strong play in the second half of the season. In February, he dominated a match-up against fellow giant Gheorghe Mure\u0219an, leading the Nets to a 99\u201381 victory against the Washington Bullets. Bradley scored a season-high 27 points over the 7-foot-7 Mure\u015fan, and also added 9 rebounds and 4 blocked shots.[23]\n\n\nBradley lifted his game to new levels in March 1996. He posted a career-high 32 points and added 15 rebounds against Dallas early in the month,[24] and set another career high a week later with 10 blocked shots against the Phoenix Suns. He recorded his first career triple-double in the very next game, tallying 19 points, 17 rebounds, and a career-best 11 blocked shots in another match-up against Mure\u015fan and the Bullets. In April, Bradley posted back-to-back triple-doubles (against Boston and Toronto); in the process, he became the first player in NBA history to record consecutive games of double-figure blocked shots twice in a single season.[25] His season averages for 1995\u201396 were 11.9 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.7 blocks per game[26]\u2014all career highs.\n\n\nThe Nets began the 1996\u201397 season under new management: John Calipari was named head coach in the off-season, and John Nash replaced Willis Reed as general manager. Reed had been a big believer in Bradley, but Calipari and Nash weren't nearly as excited about the 7-foot-6 enigma. In an effort to save some cash against the salary cap, the Nets traded their big center (and his big contract) to the Dallas Mavericks in a blockbuster mid-season deal that involved nine players.[27]\n\n\n\n### Dallas Mavericks (1997\u20132005)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bradley (left) with the Mavericks in 2005\nBradley embraced yet another \"fresh start\" with a new franchise. With increased playing time in Dallas, Bradley posted some of the best numbers of his career. In a game against the Clippers, he tied his career high by scoring 32 points\u2014the most ever by a center in the history of the Mavericks franchise. He also added a season-high 16 rebounds in that same contest. He finished the year with averages of 13.2 points and 8.4 rebounds per game\u2014breaking career highs set during the previous season. But most importantly, Bradley provided strong defense in the paint that Dallas had been lacking before his arrival. In fact, Bradley finished the year as the top shot-blocker in the entire league, averaging 3.4 swats per contest. It was the first time any Mavericks player had ever led the NBA in any statistical category.\n\n\nAnd yet, Bradley continued to be plagued by the maddening inconsistency that defined his entire professional career. During the 1997\u201398 season, Dallas coach Jim Cleamons experimented by bringing Bradley off the bench in several games (instead of his usual role as starter). In one particular game, it paid off in a major way: Bradley totaled 22 points, 22 rebounds, and a career-high 13 blocked shots in an April contest against the Trail Blazers. Bradley became the fifth NBA player to record at least 20 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 blocks in a single game, and the first to do so off the bench.[11] The previous players to record a 20\u201320\u201310 game with points, rebounds, and blocks were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Elvin Hayes, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Shaquille O'Neal. Bradley finished the year with a team-record 214 blocked shots; his average of 3.3 per game ranked third in the NBA.\n\n\nBradley played 7 more seasons in the league, remaining with the Mavericks until his retirement in 2005. Over that span, his playing time slowly declined, mainly due to some injuries and constant juggling of the team's lineups and rotations by coach Don Nelson. In particular, Bradley's offensive role became very limited, but he remained an imposing defensive presence. In fact, in the 2000\u201301 season, he broke his own team record by blocking 228 shots for Dallas\u2014the highest total in the NBA that year. The Mavericks emerged as a perennial playoff contender, mostly due to the rise of star players such as Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash, but Bradley's defense made a significant contribution. He finished his career with averages of 8.1 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in 23.5 minutes of action per game. [28]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nBradley has competed internationally for Germany; he and Dallas teammate Dirk Nowitzki were members of the German national basketball team that finished in fourth place at the EuroBasket 2001 in Turkey. In order to participate in this tournament, Bradley made use of his birth by a German mother to obtain German citizenship.[29]\n\n\n\n## Post-basketball career[edit]\n\n\nAfter his retirement as a player, Bradley became involved with West Ridge Academy, a coeducational private school for at-risk youths in West Jordan, Utah. Bradley's role with the school involves some of the functions of a vice principal, counselor, and coach. Describing Bradley, school executive director Ken Allen said, \"Shawn has a great presence\u2014due to his size\u2014and has immediate credibility with the kids. His instant credibility when he's talking to kids makes him an incredible mentor. He is a great example of someone who has worked hard and been very successful. Being so tall wasn't always easy for him. He knows about being the 'odd kid' and dealing with that.\"[30]\n\n\nOn March 19, 2010, Bradley filed papers to run as a Republican against incumbent Democratic Representative Tim Cosgrove for the 44th District seat in the Utah House of Representatives.[31][32] On November 2, 2010, Bradley lost the election to Cosgrove, earning 46.49% of the vote against Cosgrove's 51.13%.[33]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBradley has participated in many charitable endeavors. In the 2000\u201301 season he donated $25 for each blocked shot to Bryan's House, a managed facility for children affected by HIV and AIDS. He is a national spokesman for the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.[25][34] Bradley has also participated in the \"Basketball Without Borders\" program with other NBA players like Dikembe Mutombo, DeSagana Diop and Malik Rose and found his experiences with children in Africa uplifting.[35] He has also participated in treating leprosy colonies in India through the Rising Star Outreach.[36]\n\n\nWhile in the NBA, Bradley was fined for refusing to attend a mandatory meeting at a strip club, due to his religious beliefs.[37]\n\n\nBradley and his first wife, Annette Evertson, had six children together. They later divorced, and in 2017, Bradley married Carrie Cannon, adopting her three children in 2019.[38]\n\n\nOn January 20, 2021, Bradley was struck from behind by a motorist while riding his bicycle near his home in St. George, Utah, which resulted in a traumatic spinal cord injury in his neck that left him paralyzed.[39] A driver attempted to pass Bradley on the left in the same travel lane while Bradley himself was in the process of passing another car parked on the shoulder of the road.\n\n\nIn a 2022 interview with *Sports Illustrated*, Bradley stated that he and his family intend to move into a more wheelchair-friendly home in Dallas, Texas, while he continues his rehabilitation. Bradley described his height as a \"hindrance\" to his recovery, as quadriplegia at his height has no medical precedent.[38]\n\n\n\n## TV and movie appearances[edit]\n\n\nBradley had a role in the film *Space Jam* in 1996,[40] depicted as one of the NBA stars who lose their talent alongside Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, and Patrick Ewing. He also appeared as himself in an episode of *Walker, Texas Ranger*,[40] and had a cameo appearance as an auto mechanic in *The Singles Ward* movie.[40] In 2011, he appeared in a music video tribute to Jimmer Fredette, along with former BYU football star Chad Lewis and legendary coach LaVell Edwards.[41] He has also appeared in an episode of *Studio C*.[42]\n\n\nBradley was featured in the ESPN 30 for 30 short documentary \"Posterized\" given his propensity \"for being on the wrong end of a lot of great dunks.\"[43]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n | \u00a0\u00a0GS\u00a0\n | Games started\n | \u00a0MPG\u00a0\n | Minutes per game\n |\n| \u00a0FG%\u00a0\n | Field goal percentage\n | \u00a03P%\u00a0\n | 3-point field goal percentage\n | \u00a0FT%\u00a0\n | Free throw percentage\n |\n| \u00a0RPG\u00a0\n | Rebounds per game\n | \u00a0APG\u00a0\n | Assists per game\n | \u00a0SPG\u00a0\n | Steals per game\n |\n| \u00a0BPG\u00a0\n | Blocks per game\n | \u00a0PPG\u00a0\n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n| \u00a0\\*\u00a0\n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1993\u201394 | Philadelphia | 49 | 45 | 28.3 | .409 | .000 | .607 | 6.2 | **2.0** | **0.9** | 3.0 | 10.3\n |\n| 1994\u201395 | Philadelphia | **82**\\* | **59** | 28.8 | .455 | .000 | .638 | 8.0 | 0.6 | 0.7 | 3.3 | 9.5\n |\n| 1995\u201396 | Philadelphia | 12 | 11 | 27.8 | .443 | .000 | .760 | **8.8** | 0.7 | 0.7 | 3.2 | 8.8\n |\n| 1995\u201396 | New Jersey | 67 | 57 | 29.8 | .443 | .250 | .679 | 7.9 | 0.8 | 0.6 | 3.7 | 12.5\n |\n| 1996\u201397 | New Jersey | 40 | 38 | 30.7 | .436 | .000 | .664 | 8.1 | 0.5 | 0.6 | **4.0\\*** | 12.0\n |\n| 1996\u201397 | Dallas | 33 | 32 | **32.1** | .461 | .000 | .642 | 8.7 | 1.0 | 0.5 | 2.7 | **14.6** |\n| 1997\u201398 | Dallas | 64 | 46 | 28.5 | .422 | **.333** | .722 | 8.1 | 0.9 | 0.8 | 3.3 | 11.4\n |\n| 1998\u201399 | Dallas | 49 | 33 | 26.4 | .480 | .000 | .748 | 8.0 | 0.8 | 0.7 | 3.2 | 8.6\n |\n| 1999\u201300 | Dallas | 77 | 54 | 24.7 | .479 | .200 | .765 | 6.5 | 0.8 | **0.9** | 2.5 | 8.4\n |\n| 2000\u201301 | Dallas | **82** | 35 | 24.4 | .490 | .167 | .787 | 7.4 | 0.5 | 0.4 | 2.8 | 7.1\n |\n| 2001\u201302 | Dallas | 53 | 16 | 14.3 | .479 | .000 | **.922** | 3.3 | 0.4 | 0.5 | 1.2 | 4.1\n |\n| 2002\u201303 | Dallas | 81 | 39 | 21.4 | **.536** | .000 | .806 | 5.9 | 0.7 | 0.8 | 2.1 | 6.7\n |\n| 2003\u201304 | Dallas | 66 | 5 | 11.7 | .473 | .000 | .837 | 2.6 | 0.3 | 0.5 | 1.1 | 3.3\n |\n| 2004\u201305 | Dallas | 77 | 14 | 11.5 | .452 | .000 | .683 | 2.8 | 0.2 | 0.3 | 0.8 | 2.7\n |\n| Career\n | 832 | 484 | 23.5 | .457 | .103 | .716 | 6.3 | 0.7 | 0.6 | 2.5 | 8.1\n |\n\n\n### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2000\u201301 | Dallas | 10 | **10** | **25.6** | **.529** | .000 | **.769** | **7.1** | **0.5** | **0.4** | **3.9** | **6.4** |\n| 2001\u201302 | Dallas | 7 | 0 | 3.6 | .500 | .000 | .000 | 0.7 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.1 | 0.9\n |\n| 2002\u201303 | Dallas | **17** | 7 | 14.5 | .400 | .000 | .750 | 3.8 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.8 | 2.9\n |\n| 2003\u201304 | Dallas | 2 | 0 | 1.5 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\n |\n| 2004\u201305 | Dallas | 7 | 0 | 3.9 | .667 | .000 | .500 | 0.9 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.3 | 1.3\n |\n| Career\n | 43 | 17 | 13.0 | .478 | .000 | .741 | 3.4 | 0.2 | 0.2 | 1.1 | 3.0\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association single-game blocks leaders\n* List of tallest players in National Basketball Association history\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 13 or more blocks in a game\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Shawn Bradley\".

He played for the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Yao was selected to start for the Western Conference in the NBA All-Star Game eight times, and was named to the All-NBA Team five times. During his final season, he was the tallest active player in the NBA, at 2.29\u00a0m (7\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in).[1]\n\n\nYao, who was born in Shanghai, started playing for the Sharks as a teenager, and played on their senior team for five years in the CBA, winning a championship in his final year. After negotiating with the CBA and the Sharks to secure his release, Yao was selected by the Rockets as the first overall pick in the 2002 NBA draft. He reached the NBA playoffs four times, and the Rockets won the first-round series in the 2009 postseason, their first playoff series victory since 1997. In July 2011, Yao announced his retirement from professional basketball because of a series of foot and ankle injuries which forced him to miss 250 games in his last six seasons.[2] In eight seasons with the Rockets, Yao ranks sixth among franchise leaders in total points and total rebounds, and second in total blocks.[3]\n\n\nYao is one of China's best-known athletes, with sponsorships with several major companies. His rookie year in the NBA was the subject of a documentary film, *The Year of the Yao*, and he co-wrote, along with NBA analyst Ric Bucher, an autobiography titled *Yao: A Life in Two Worlds*. Known in China as the \"Yao Ming Phenomenon\" and in the United States as the \"Ming Dynasty\", Yao's success in the NBA, and his popularity among fans, made him a symbol of a new China that was both more modern and more confident.[4]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Yao was elected into the Basketball Hall of Fame, alongside Shaquille O'Neal and Allen Iverson.[5] In February 2017, Yao was unanimously elected as chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nYao is the only child of 6-foot-7-inch (2.01\u00a0m) Yao Zhiyuan and 6-foot-3-inch (1.91\u00a0m) Fang Fengdi,[7] both of whom were former professional basketball players.[8] At 11 pounds (5.0\u00a0kg), Yao weighed more than twice as much as the average Chinese newborn.[9] When Yao was nine years old, he began playing basketball and attended a junior sports school.[10] The following year, Yao measured 5\u00a0feet 5\u00a0inches (1.65\u00a0m)[11] and was examined by sports doctors, who predicted he would grow to 7\u00a0feet 3\u00a0inches (2.21\u00a0m).[11]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Shanghai Sharks (1997\u20132002)[edit]\n\n\nYao first tried out for the Shanghai Sharks junior team of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) when he was 13 years old, and practiced ten hours a day for his acceptance.[12] After playing with the junior team for four years, Yao joined the senior team of the Sharks, where he averaged 10\u00a0points and 8\u00a0rebounds a game in his rookie season. His next season was cut short when he broke his foot for the second time in his career, which Yao said decreased his jumping ability by four to six inches (10 to 15\u00a0cm).[13] The Sharks made the finals of the CBA in Yao's third season and again the next year, but lost both times to the Bayi Rockets. When Wang Zhizhi left the Bayi Rockets to become the first NBA player from China the following year, the Sharks finally won their first CBA championship. During the playoffs in his final year with Shanghai, Yao averaged 38.9\u00a0points and 20.2\u00a0rebounds a game, while shooting 76.6% from the field,[14] and made all 21 of his shots during one game in the finals.[15]\n\n\n\n### Houston Rockets (2002\u20132011)[edit]\n\n\nYao was pressured to enter the NBA draft in 1999 by Li Yaomin, the deputy general manager of the Shanghai Sharks.[9] Li also influenced Yao to sign a contract for Evergreen Sports Inc. to serve as his agent. The agreement entitled Evergreen to 33% of Yao's earnings,[9] but the contract was later determined to be invalid.[16]\n\n\nAs American attention on Yao grew, Chinese authorities also took interest. In 2002, the Chinese government released new regulations that would require him and other Chinese players to turn over half of any NBA earnings to the government and China's national basketball association, including endorsements as well as salaries.[17]\n\n\nWhen Yao decided to enter the 2002 NBA draft, a group of advisers was formed that came to be known as \"Team Yao\". The team consisted of Yao's negotiator, Erik Zhang; his NBA agent, Bill Duffy; his Chinese agent, Lu Hao; University of Chicago economics professor John Huizinga;[18] and the vice president for marketing at BDA Sports Management, Bill Sanders.[19] Yao was widely predicted to be picked number one overall.[20][21][22] However, some teams were concerned about Yao's NBA eligibility because of uncertainty over whether the CBA would let Yao play in the United States.[23]\n\n\nShortly after Wang Zhizhi refused to return to China to play for the national team and was subsequently banned from playing for China,[24] the CBA stipulated that Yao would have to return to play for the national team.[25] They also said they would not let him go to the United States unless the Houston Rockets would take him first overall.[26] After assurances from Team Yao that the Rockets would draft Yao with their number one pick, the CBA gave permission on the morning of the draft for Yao to play in the U.S.[27] When the Rockets selected Yao with the first pick of the draft, he became the first international player ever to be selected first overall without having previously played U.S. college basketball.[28]\n\n\n\n#### Beginning years (2002\u20132005)[edit]\n\n\nYao did not participate in the Rockets' pre-season training camp, instead playing for China in the 2002 FIBA World Championships.[29] Before the season, several commentators, including Bill Simmons and Dick Vitale, predicted that Yao would fail in the NBA,[30][31] and Charles Barkley said he would \"kiss Kenny Smith's ass\" if Yao scored more than 19\u00a0points in one of his rookie-season games.[32] Yao played his first NBA game against the Indiana Pacers, scoring no points and grabbing two rebounds,[33][34] and scored his first NBA basket against the Denver Nuggets.[35] In his first seven games, he averaged only 14\u00a0minutes and 4\u00a0points, but on November 17, he scored 20\u00a0points on a perfect 9-of-9 from the field and 2-of-2 from the free-throw line against the Lakers.[36] Barkley made good on his bet by kissing the buttock of a donkey purchased by Smith for the occasion (Smith's \"ass\").[32]\n\n\nIn Yao's first game in Miami on December 16, 2002, the Heat passed out 8,000 fortune cookies, an East Asian cultural stereotype.[37][38] Yao was not angry with the promotion because he was not familiar with American stereotypes of Chinese.[39] In an earlier interview in 2000, Yao said he had never seen a fortune cookie in China and guessed it must have been an American invention.[40]\n\n\nBefore Yao's first meeting with Shaquille O'Neal on January 17, 2003, O'Neal said, \"Tell Yao Ming, ching chong-yang-wah-ah-soh\", prompting accusations of racism.[39] O'Neal denied that his comments were racist, and said he was only joking.[41] Yao also said he believed O'Neal was joking, but he said a lot of Asians would not see the humor.[41][42] In the game, Yao scored the Rockets' first six points of the game and blocked O'Neal twice in the opening minutes as well as altering two other shots by O'Neal, all 4 of those attempts coming right at the rim, and made a game-sealing dunk with 10\u00a0seconds left in overtime.[43] Yao finished with 10\u00a0points, 10\u00a0rebounds, and 6\u00a0blocks; O'Neal recorded 31\u00a0points, 13\u00a0rebounds, and 0\u00a0blocks.[44] O'Neal later expressed regret for the way he treated Yao early in his career.[45]\n\n\nThe NBA began offering All-Star ballots in three languages\u2014English, Spanish and Chinese\u2014for fan voting of the starters for the 2003 NBA All-Star Game.[46] Yao was voted to start for the West over O'Neal, who was coming off three consecutive NBA Finals MVP Awards.[47] Yao received nearly a quarter million more votes than O'Neal, and he became the first rookie to start in the All-Star Game since Grant Hill in 1995.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Yao prepares to shoot a free throw with John Stockton in the background\nYao finished his rookie season averaging 13.5\u00a0points and 8.2\u00a0rebounds per game,[49] and was second in the NBA Rookie of the Year Award voting to Amar'e Stoudemire,[50] and a unanimous pick for the NBA All-Rookie First Team selection.[51] He was also voted the *Sporting News* Rookie of the Year,[52] and won the Laureus Newcomer of the Year award.[53]\n\n\n\n![](image)Yao (*fourth from left*) standing with the Sophomores team during the 2004 Rookie Challenge game.\nBefore the start of Yao's sophomore season, Rockets' head coach Rudy Tomjanovich resigned because of health issues,[54] and long-time New York Knicks head coach Jeff Van Gundy was brought in. After Van Gundy began focusing the offense on Yao,[55] Yao averaged career highs in points and rebounds for the season, and had a career-high 41\u00a0points and 7\u00a0assists in a triple-overtime win against the Atlanta Hawks in February 2004.[56] He was also voted to be the starting center for the Western Conference in the 2004 NBA All-Star Game for the second straight year.[57] Yao finished the season averaging 17.5 points and 9.0 rebounds a game.[49] The Rockets made the playoffs for the first time in Yao's career, claiming the seventh seed in the Western Conference. In the first round, however, the Los Angeles Lakers eliminated Houston in five games.[58] Yao averaged 15.0 points and 7.4 rebounds in his first playoff series.[49]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2004, the Rockets acquired Tracy McGrady from the Orlando Magic in a seven-player trade that also sent Steve Francis and Cuttino Mobley to Orlando.[59] Although Yao said that Francis and Mobley had \"helped [him] in every way [his] first two seasons\", he added, \"I'm excited about playing with Tracy McGrady. He can do some amazing things.\"[60] After the trade, it was predicted that the Rockets would be title contenders.[59][61] Both McGrady and Yao were voted to start in the 2005 NBA All-Star Game, and Yao broke the record previously held by Michael Jordan for most All-Star votes, with 2,558,278 total votes.[62] The Rockets won 51\u00a0games and finished fifth in the West, and made the playoffs for the second consecutive year, where they faced the Dallas Mavericks.[63] The Rockets won the first two games in Dallas, and Yao made 13 of 14\u00a0shots in the second game, the best shooting performance in the playoffs in Rockets history.[64] However, the Rockets lost four of their last five games and lost Game\u00a07 by 40\u00a0points, the largest Game\u00a07 deficit in NBA history.[65] Yao's final averages for the series were 21.4 points on 65% shooting and 7.7 rebounds.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Career highs and injury plagued seasons (2005\u20132011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In his fifth season, Yao averaged a career-high 25 points per game.\nAfter missing only two games out of 246 in his first three years of NBA play,[7] Yao endured an extended period on the inactive list in his fourth season after developing osteomyelitis in the big toe on his left foot, and surgery was performed on the toe on December 18, 2005.[66] Despite missing 21 games while recovering,[7] Yao again had the most fan votes to start the 2006 NBA All-Star Game.[67]\n\n\nIn 25\u00a0games after the All-Star break, Yao averaged 25.7 points and 11.6 rebounds per game, while shooting 53.7% from the field and 87.8% at the free-throw line.[68] His final averages in 57\u00a0games were 22.3 points and 10.2 rebounds per game.[49] It was the first time that he ended the season with a so-called \"20/10\" average. However, Tracy McGrady played only 47\u00a0games in the season, missing time because of back spasms.[69] Yao and McGrady played only 31\u00a0games together,[70] and the Rockets did not make the playoffs, winning only 34\u00a0games.[71] With only four games left in the season, Yao suffered another injury in a game against the Utah Jazz on April 10, 2006, which left him with a broken bone in his left foot. The injury required six months of rest.[72]\n\n\nEarly into his fifth season, Yao was injured again, this time breaking his right knee on December 23, 2006, while attempting to block a shot.[73] Up to that point he had been averaging 26.8\u00a0points, 9.7\u00a0rebounds and 2.3\u00a0blocks per game, and had been mentioned as an MVP candidate.[74][75] Yao was unable to play in what would have been his fifth All-Star game;[76] he was medically cleared to play on March 4, 2007, after missing 32\u00a0games.[77]\n\n\nDespite Yao's absence, the Rockets made the playoffs with the home court advantage against the Utah Jazz in the first round.[78] The Rockets won the first two games, but then lost four of five games[79] and were eliminated in Game\u00a07 at home; Yao scored 29\u00a0points\u201415 in the fourth quarter.[80] Although he averaged 25.1\u00a0points and 10.3\u00a0rebounds for the series, Yao said afterwards \"I didn't do my job\".[81] At the end of the season, Yao was selected to the All-NBA Second Team for the first time in his career, after being selected to the All-NBA Third Team twice.[82]\n\n\nOn May 18, 2007, only weeks after the Rockets were eliminated from the playoffs, Jeff Van Gundy was dismissed as head coach.[83] Three days later, the Rockets signed former Sacramento Kings coach Rick Adelman,[84] who was thought to focus more on offense than the defensive-minded Van Gundy.[85][86]\n\n\n\n![](image)Yao advanced to the second round of the playoffs for the only time in his career in 2009.\n![](image)Yao playing against Gilbert Arenas\nOn November 9, 2007, Yao played against fellow Chinese NBA and Milwaukee Bucks player Yi Jianlian for the first time. The game, which the Rockets won 104\u201388, was broadcast on 19\u00a0networks in China, and was watched by over 200\u00a0million people in China alone, making it one of the most-watched NBA games in history.[87] In the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, Yao was once again voted to start at center for the Western Conference.[88] Before the All-Star weekend, the Rockets had won eight straight games, and after the break, they took their win streak to 12\u00a0games. On February 26, 2008, however, it was reported that Yao would miss the rest of the season with a stress fracture in his left foot. He missed the 2008 NBA playoffs, but he did not miss the 2008 Summer Olympics at Beijing, China in August.[89] After Yao's injury, the Rockets stretched their winning streak to 22 games, at the time the second-longest such streak in NBA history.[90] Yao underwent a successful operation on March 3, which placed screws in his foot to strengthen the bone, and recovery time was estimated at four months.[91] Yao's final averages in 55\u00a0games were 22.0\u00a0points, 10.8\u00a0rebounds, and 2.0\u00a0blocks a game.[49]\n\n\nThe next season, Yao played 77 games, his first full season since the 2004\u201305 season, and averaged 19.7 points and 9.9 rebounds, while shooting 54.8% from the field, and a career-high 86.6% from the free throw line.[49] Despite McGrady suffering a season-ending injury in February,[92] the Rockets finished with 53 wins and the fifth seed in the Western Conference.[93] Facing the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round, Yao finished with 24 points on 9-of-9 shooting in the first game, and the Rockets won 108\u201381, in Portland.[94] The Rockets won all their games in Houston,[95] and advanced to the second round of the playoffs for the first time since 1997, and the first time in Yao's career.[96]\n\n\nThe Rockets faced the Lakers in the second round, and Yao scored 28 points, with 8 points in the final four minutes, to lead the Rockets to a 100\u201392 win in Los Angeles.[97] However, the Rockets lost their next two games,[98][99] and Yao was diagnosed with a sprained ankle after Game 3.[100] A follow-up test revealed a hairline fracture in his left foot, and he was ruled out for the remainder of the playoffs.[101] In reaction, Yao said the injury, which did not require surgery, was \"better than last year\".[102] However, follow-up analysis indicated that the injury could be career threatening.[103] The Yao-less Rockets went on to win Game 4 against the Lakers to even the series 2\u20132.[104] The Rockets eventually lost the series in seven games.\n\n\nIn July 2009, Yao discussed the injury with his doctors, and the Rockets applied for a disabled player exception, an exception to the NBA salary cap which grants the injured player's team money to sign a free agent.[105] The Rockets were granted the exception, and used approximately $5.7\u00a0million on free agent Trevor Ariza. After weeks of consulting, it was decided that Yao would undergo surgery in order to repair the broken bone in his left foot.[106] He did not play the entire 2009\u201310 season.[107]\n\n\nFor the 2010\u201311 season, the Rockets said they would limit Yao to 24 minutes a game, with no plan to play him on back-to-back nights. Their goal was to keep Yao healthy in the long term.[107] On December 16, 2010, it was announced that Yao had developed a stress fracture in his left ankle, related to an older injury, and would miss the rest of the season.[108] In January 2011, he was voted as the Western Conference starting center for the 2011 All-Star Game for the eighth time in nine seasons. Injured All-Stars are usually required to attend the All-Star functions and to be introduced at the game, but Yao was not in Los Angeles because of his rehabilitation schedule after his surgery.[109] Yao's contract with the Rockets expired at the end of the season, and he became a free agent.[110]\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\nOn July 20, 2011, Yao announced his retirement from basketball in a press conference in Shanghai.[111][112] He cited injuries to his foot and ankle, including the third fracture to his left foot sustained near the end of 2010.[113] His retirement sparked over 1.2\u00a0million comments on the Chinese social-networking site Sina Weibo.[114] Reacting to Yao's retirement, NBA commissioner David Stern said Yao was a \"bridge between Chinese and American fans\" and that he had \"a wonderful mixture of talent, dedication, humanitarian aspirations and a sense of humor.\"[113] Shaquille O'Neal said Yao \"was very agile. He could play inside, he could play outside, and if he didn't have those injuries he could've been up there in the top five centers to ever play the game.\"[115]\n\n\nYao was nominated by a member of the Chinese media for the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor to the game. He would have been eligible for induction as early as 2012, but Yao felt it was too soon and requested that the Hall of Fame delay consideration of the nomination. The Hall granted Yao's request, and said it was Yao's decision when the process would be restarted.[116]\n\n\nOn September 9, 2016, Yao was inducted into the Hall of Fame along with 4-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal and Allen Iverson.[117] Continuing with the honors, on February 3, 2017, Yao's Number 11 jersey was retired by the Houston Rockets.[118]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yao was the leading scorer of the 2006 FIBA World Championship.\n### 2000 and 2004 Olympics[edit]\n\n\nYao first played for China in the 2000 Summer Olympics, and he was dubbed, together with 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) teammates Wang Zhizhi and Mengke Bateer, \"the Walking Great Wall\".[119] During the 2004 Athens Olympics, Yao carried the Chinese flag during the opening ceremony, which he said was a \"long dream come true\".[120] He then vowed to abstain from shaving his beard for half a year unless the Chinese national team made it into the quarter-finals of the 2004 Olympics.[121] After Yao scored 39\u00a0points in a win against New Zealand, China lost 58\u201383, 57\u201382, and 52\u201389 against Spain, Argentina and Italy respectively. In the final group game, however, a 67\u201366 win over the reigning 2002 FIBA World Champions Serbia and Montenegro moved them into the quarterfinals. Yao scored 27\u00a0points and had 13\u00a0rebounds, and he hit two free throws with 28\u00a0seconds left that proved to be the winning margin.[122] He averaged 20.7\u00a0points and 9.3\u00a0rebounds per game while shooting 55.9% from the field.[123]\n\n\n\n### Asian Cup[edit]\n\n\nYao led the Chinese national team to three consecutive FIBA Asia Cup gold medals, winning the 2001 FIBA Asian Championship, the 2003 FIBA Asian Championship, and the 2005 FIBA Asian Championship. He was also named the MVP of all three tournaments.\n\n\n\n### 2006 World Championship[edit]\n\n\nYao's injury at the end of the 2005\u201306 NBA season required a full six months of rest, threatening his participation in the 2006 FIBA World Championship.[124] However, he recovered before the start of the tournament, and in the last game of the preliminary round, he had 36\u00a0points and 10\u00a0rebounds in a win against Slovenia to lead China into the Round of 16.[125] In the first knockout round, however, China was defeated by eventual finalist Greece.[125] Yao's final averages were 25.3\u00a0points, the most in the tournament, and 9.0\u00a0rebounds a game, which was fourth overall.[126]\n\n\n\n### 2008 Olympics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yao against LeBron James at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing\nAfter having surgery to repair his fractured foot, Yao stated if he could not play in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, \"It would be the biggest loss in my career to right now.\"[127] He returned to play with the Chinese national team on July 17, 2008.[128] On August 6, Yao carried the Olympic flame into Tiananmen Square, as part of the Olympic torch relay.[129] He also carried the Chinese flag and led his country's delegation during the opening ceremony.[130] Yao scored the first basket of the game, a three-pointer, in China's opening 2008 Olympics Basketball Tournament game against the eventual gold medal-winning United States.[131]\n\n\n\"I was just really happy to make that shot\", Yao said after the Americans' 101\u201370 victory. \"It was the first score in our Olympic campaign here at home and I'll always remember it. It represents that we can keep our heads up in the face of really tough odds.\"[131]\n\n\nFollowing an overtime defeat to Spain,[132] Yao scored 30 points in a win over Angola,[133] and 25 points in a three-point win against Germany,[134] which clinched China's place in the quarterfinals. However, China lost to Lithuania in the quarterfinals by 26 points,[135] eliminating them from the tournament. Yao's 19 points a game were the second-highest in the Olympics,[136] and his averages of 8.2 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game were third overall.[137][138]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n | \u00a0\u00a0GS\u00a0\n | Games started\n | \u00a0MPG\u00a0\n | Minutes per game\n |\n| \u00a0FG%\u00a0\n | Field goal percentage\n | \u00a03P%\u00a0\n | 3-point field goal percentage\n | \u00a0FT%\u00a0\n | Free throw percentage\n |\n| \u00a0RPG\u00a0\n | Rebounds per game\n | \u00a0APG\u00a0\n | Assists per game\n | \u00a0SPG\u00a0\n | Steals per game\n |\n| \u00a0BPG\u00a0\n | Blocks per game\n | \u00a0PPG\u00a0\n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n\n\n### CBA statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP\n | RPG\n | APG\n | FG%\n | FT%\n | PPG\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1997\u201398 | Shanghai | 21\n | 8.3\n | 1.3\n | .615\n | .485\n | 10.0\n |\n| 1998\u201399 | Shanghai\n | 12\n | 12.9\n | 1.7\n | .585\n | .699\n | 20.9\n |\n| 1999\u201300 | Shanghai\n | 33\n | 14.5\n | 1.7\n | .585\n | .683\n | 21.2\n |\n| 2000\u201301 | Shanghai\n | 22\n | 19.4\n | 2.2\n | .679\n | .799\n | 27.1\n |\n| 2001\u201302 | Shanghai\n | 24\n | 19.0\n | 1.9\n | .721\n | .759\n | 32.4\n |\n| Career\n | 122\n | 15.4\n | 1.8\n | .651\n | .723\n | 23.4\n |\n\n\n### NBA statistics[edit]\n\n\n#### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002\u201303 | Houston | **82** | 72 | 29.0 | .498 | .500 | .811 | 8.2 | 1.7 | .4 | 1.8 | 13.5\n |\n| 2003\u201304 | Houston | **82** | **82** | 32.8 | .522 | .000 | .809 | 9.0 | 1.5 | .3 | 1.9 | 17.5\n |\n| 2004\u201305 | Houston | 80 | 80 | 30.6 | **.552** | .000 | .783 | 8.4 | .8 | .4 | **2.0** | 18.3\n |\n| 2005\u201306 | Houston | 57 | 57 | 34.2 | .519 | .000 | .853 | 10.2 | 1.5 | **.5** | 1.6 | 22.3\n |\n| 2006\u201307 | Houston | 48 | 48 | 33.8 | .516 | .000 | .862 | 9.4 | 2.0 | .4 | **2.0** | **25.0** |\n| 2007\u201308 | Houston | 55 | 55 | **37.2** | .507 | .000 | .850 | **10.8** | **2.3** | **.5** | **2.0** | 22.0\n |\n| 2008\u201309 | Houston | 77 | 77 | 33.6 | .548 | **1.000** | .866 | 9.9 | 1.8 | .4 | 1.9 | 19.7\n |\n| 2010\u201311 | Houston | 5 | 5 | 18.2 | .486 | .000 | **.938** | 5.4 | .8 | .0 | 1.6 | 10.2\n |\n| Career\n | 486 | 476 | 32.5 | .524 | .200 | .833 | 9.2 | 1.6 | .4 | 1.9 | 19.0\n |\n| All-Star\n | 6 | 6 | 17.0 | .500 | .000 | .667 | 4.0 | 1.3 | .2 | .3 | 7.0\n |\n\n\n#### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2004 | Houston | 5 | 5 | 37.0 | .456 | .000 | .765 | 7.4 | **1.8** | **.4** | 1.4 | 15.0\n |\n| 2005 | Houston | 7 | 7 | 31.4 | **.655** | .000 | .727 | 7.7 | .7 | .3 | **2.7** | 21.4\n |\n| 2007 | Houston | 7 | 7 | **37.1** | .440 | .000 | .880 | 10.3 | .9 | .1 | .7 | **25.1** |\n| 2009 | Houston | **9** | **9** | 35.9 | .545 | .000 | **.902** | **10.9** | 1.0 | **.4** | 1.2 | 17.1\n |\n| Career\n | 28 | 28 | 35.3 | .519 | .000 | .833 | 9.3 | 1.0 | .3 | 1.5 | 19.8\n |\n\n\n## Awards and achievements[edit]\n\n\n* Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame: Class of 2016\n* 8\u00d7 NBA All-Star: 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011\n* 5\u00d7 All-NBA Team:\n\n\n* Second Team: 2007, 2009\n* Third Team: 2004, 2006, 2008\n\n* NBA All-Rookie First Team: 2003\n* NBA Rookie All-Star Game: 2004\n* Gold medal winner with Team China at the 2001, 2003, and 2005 FIBA Asia Cups\n* MVP of the 2001, 2003, 2005 FIBA Asia Cups\n* FIBA Diamond Ball Top Scorer: 2004\n* All-Tournament Team, FIBA World Cup: 2002\n* Chinese Basketball Association Champion: 2001\u201302\n* Rebounding leader in CBA in 2001\u201302\n* 2003 *Sporting News* Rookie of the Year\n* 2003 *Laureus Newcomer of the Year*\n* 2005 Proletarian Award, issued by the Chinese Communist Party[139]\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nAfter Yao announced that he would enter the 2002 NBA draft, he told one American journalist that he had been studying English for two years, and that he liked the movie *Star Wars* but disliked hip hop. He was sometimes accompanied during interviews in Shanghai by one of his parents, whose basketball careers were derailed by the 1966\u201376 Cultural Revolution, and who came to his Shanghai Sharks games on bicycles.[140]\n\n\n\n![](image)Yao answers questions from reporters, October 2006\nYao met Chinese female basketball player Ye Li when he was 17 years old.[141] Ye was not fond of Yao at first, but finally accepted him after he gave her the team pins he had collected during the 2000 Summer Olympics.[141] She is the only woman he has ever dated.[142] Their relationship became public when they appeared together during the 2004 Olympics closing ceremony.[141] On August 6, 2007, Yao and Ye married in a ceremony attended by close friends and family and closed to the media.[143] On May 21, 2010, the couple's daughter Yao Qinlei (whose English name is Amy) was born in Houston, Texas.[112][144][145]\n\n\nIn 2004, Yao co-wrote an autobiography with ESPN sportswriter Ric Bucher, entitled *Yao: A Life in Two Worlds*.[146] In the same year, he was also the subject of a documentary film, *The Year of the Yao*, which focuses on his NBA rookie year.[147] The film is narrated by his friend and interpreter, Colin Pine.[148] In 2005, former *Newsweek* writer Brook Larmer published a book entitled *Operation Yao Ming*, in which he said that Yao's parents were convinced to marry each other so that they would produce a dominant athlete, and that during Yao's childhood, he was given special treatment to help him become a great basketball player.[9] In a 2015 AMA post on Reddit, Yao stated that this was not true and that he started playing basketball for fun at age 9.[149] In 2009, Yao provided the voice for a character of a Chinese animated film, *The Magic Aster*, released on June 19.[150]\n\n\nYao enrolled at the Antai College of Economics & Management of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2011.[151] He took a tailored degree program with mostly one-on-one lectures to avoid being a distraction on campus.[152] Yao completed his studies in July 2018, graduating with a degree in economics after 7 years of study.[153][154][155][156]\n\n\nIn 2016, Yao opened a winery called Yao Family Wines in Napa Valley, California, which serves Cabernet Sauvignon blends and \"the kind of rich-but-balanced luxury reds he'd come to enjoy in Houston steakhouses.\"[157] American wine critic Robert M. Parker Jr. of *The Wine Advocate* gave Yao's wine a ranking of 96 points and wrote: \"I am aware of all the arguments that major celebrities lending their names to wines is generally a formula for mediocrity, but... the two Cabernets are actually brilliant, and the reserve bottling ranks alongside just about anything made in Napa.\"[157]\n\n\n\n## Other activities[edit]\n\n\n### Commercial engagements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yao (left) with United States Secretary of State John Kerry at the U.S.\u2013China Strategic and Economic Dialogue in 2014\nYao is one of China's most recognizable athletes, along with Liu Xiang.[158] As of 2009, he had led Forbes' Chinese celebrities list in income and popularity for six straight years, earning US$51\u00a0million (CN\u00a5357\u00a0million) in 2008.[159] A major part of his income comes from his sponsorship deals,[160] as he is under contract with several major companies to endorse their products. He was signed by Nike until the end of his rookie season. When Nike decided not to renew his contract, he signed with Reebok.[161] He also had a deal with Pepsi, and he successfully sued Coca-Cola in 2003 when they used his image on their bottles while promoting the national team.[162] He eventually signed with Coca-Cola for the 2008 Olympics.[160] His other deals include partnerships with Visa,[163] Apple,[164] Garmin,[165] and McDonald's.[166]\n\n\nOn July 16, 2009, Yao bought his former club team, the Shanghai Sharks, which were on the verge of not being able to play the next season of the Chinese Basketball Association because of financial troubles.[167]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nYao has also participated in many charity events during his career, including the NBA's Basketball Without Borders program.[168] In the NBA's offseason in 2003, Yao hosted a telethon, which raised US$300,000 to help stop the spread of SARS.[169] In September 2007, he held an auction that raised US$965,000 (CN\u00a56.75\u00a0million),[170] and competed in a charity basketball match to raise money for underprivileged children in China. He was joined by fellow NBA stars Steve Nash, Carmelo Anthony, and Baron Davis, and Hong Kong actor Jackie Chan.[171] After the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Yao donated $2\u00a0million to relief work and created the Yao Ming Foundation to help rebuild schools destroyed in the earthquake.[172][173]\n\n\nYao has also been a dedicated supporter of Special Olympics. He serves as Global Ambassador and member of the International Board of Directors.[174]\n\n\n\n### Conservation work[edit]\n\n\nYao partnered with WildAid to appear in commercials and documentaries to educate citizens on the harmful effects of shark fin soup on shark species. From 2011 to 2018, consumption of shark fin soup dropped by 70% in China.[175] In August 2012, Yao started filming a documentary about the northern white rhinoceros.[176] He is also an ambassador for elephant conservation.[177] In 2014, he was also part of the documentary *The End of the Wild* about elephant conservation. Yao has filmed a number of public service announcements for elephant and rhino conservation for the \"Say No\" campaign with partners African Wildlife Foundation and WildAid.[178]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nOn March 3, 2013, Yao attended the First Session of the 12th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as one of its 2,200 members.[179] He was a member of the CPPCC from 2013 to 2018. While he is involved in Chinese politics, he is not a member of the Chinese Communist Party, although he has been awarded the Proletarian Award by the party for his spreading of literacy and socialist ideologies.[180]\n\n\n\n## Internet meme[edit]\n\n\nYao Ming's cartoonized laughing face has been used as a reaction face since the end of August 2010. It's commonly called \"bitch please.\" Based on a 2009 photograph of Yao laughing during a sport interview with another teammate, Ron Artest.[181][182][183]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of celebrities who own wineries and vineyards\n* List of tallest players in National Basketball Association history\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"NBA.com Yao Ming Info Page\".
