Some Pok√©mon in this generation were introduced in animated adaptations of the franchise before *Gold* and *Silver*, such as Ho-Oh in the first episode of the *Pok√©mon* anime series in 1998 and 1999, Togepi, which was a recurring character in the anime owned by Misty, Donphan in the Pok√©mon first movie in 1998, Snubbull in the first Pikachu short movie in 1998, and Marill, which also debuted in that short film and was a recurring character in the anime owned by Tracey Sketchit in 1998 and 1999. Elekid, Bellossom, Ledyba, and Hoothoot debuted in Pikachu's Rescue Adventure and Lugia and Slowking debuted in Pok√©mon 2000.\n\n\nThe following list details the 100¬†Pok√©mon of Generation¬†II in order of their National Pok√©dex number. The first Pok√©mon, Chikorita, is number 152 and the last, Celebi, is number 251. Alternate forms that result in type changes are included for convenience. Mega evolutions and regional forms are included on the pages for the generation in which they were introduced.\n\n\n\n\n## Table of Dexes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Dex name | No. of Pokemon in Dex | No. in National Dex | percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Johto Dex [Gold, Silver and Crystal]\n | 251\n | 251\n | 100%  100%\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n |\n\n\n## Design and development[edit]\n\n\nTwo new types were introduced in *Pok√©mon Gold* and *Silver* ‚Äì namely the \"Dark\" and \"Steel\" types ‚Äì which were intended to better balance the gameplay of Pok√©mon battles. Dark and Steel types fare well against \"Psychic\" attacks, which was a dominant type in *Red* and *Blue*. The concept of breeding was introduced in the second generation of *Pok√©mon* games as well, which allows players to manipulate the skills of their Pok√©mon to a greater degree.[1] Some of the new Pok√©mon introduced in *Gold* and *Silver* are pre-evolutions of other Pok√©mon, such as Pichu and Igglybuff. These baby Pok√©mon are only available by breeding their evolved forms.\n\n\n*Pok√©mon Gold* and *Silver* were first revealed at Nintendo Space World in 1997.

Mega evolutions and regional forms are included on the pages for the generation in which they were introduced.\n\n\n\n\n## Design and development[edit]\n\n\n*Nintendo Life* noted in a retrospective that the third generation of *Pok√©mon* has a very different \"feel\" from the two generations that came before it because almost all of its 135 new Pok√©mon ‚Äì save for Azurill and Wynaut ‚Äì have no relation to those of the previous generations. *Ruby* and *Sapphire* features two \"Mythical Pok√©mon\" ‚Äì Jirachi and Deoxys ‚Äì both of which became available to coincide with their respective anime movies.[1]\n\n\n*Pok√©mon Ruby* and *Sapphire* significantly increased the amount of \"Dark\" and \"Steel\"-type Pok√©mon in the series, as only a few Pok√©mon in previous generations used these typings. *Hardcore Gamer* also noted that many of the new Pok√©mon made use of \"dual typing\", where Pok√©mon have both a primary and a secondary type; this was not nearly as common in *Red* and *Blue* or *Gold* and *Silver*.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Table of Dexes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Dex name | No. of Pokemon in Dex | No. in National Dex | percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hoenn Dex [Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald]\n | 202\n | 386\n | 52.33%  52.33%\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n |\n| Kanto Dex [FireRed and LeafGreen]\n | 151\n | 386\n | 39.12%  39.12%\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n |\n\n\n## List of Pok√©mon[edit]\n\n\nPok√©mon\n\n* Treecko\n* Grovyle\n* Sceptile\n* Torchic\n* Combusken\n* Blaziken\n* Mudkip\n* Marshtomp\n* Swampert\n* Poochyena\n* Mightyena\n* Zigzagoon\n* Linoone\n* Wurmple\n* Silcoon\n* Beautifly\n* Cascoon\n* Dustox\n* Lotad\n* Lombre\n* Ludicolo\n* Seedot\n* Nuzleaf\n* Shiftry\n* Taillow\n* Swellow\n* Wingull\n* Pelipper\n* Ralts\n* Kirlia\n* Gardevoir\n* Surskit\n* Masquerain\n* Shroomish\n* Breloom\n* Slakoth\n* Vigoroth\n* Slaking\n* Nincada\n* Ninjask\n* Shedinja\n* Whismur\n* Loudred\n* Exploud\n* Makuhita\n* Hariyama\n* Azurill\n* Nosepass\n* Skitty\n* Delcatty\n* Sableye\n* Mawile\n* Aron\n* Lairon\n* Aggron\n* Meditite\n* Medicham\n* Electrike\n* Manectric\n* Plusle\n* Minun\n* Volbeat\n* Illumise\n* Roselia\n* Gulpin\n* Swalot\n* Carvanha\n* Sharpedo\n* Wailmer\n* Wailord\n* Numel\n* Camerupt\n* Torkoal\n* Spoink\n* Grumpig\n* Spinda\n* Trapinch\n* Vibrava\n* Flygon\n* Cacnea\n* Cacturne\n* Swablu\n* Altaria\n* Zangoose\n* Seviper\n* Lunatone\n* Solrock\n* Barboach\n* Whiscash\n* Corphish\n* Crawdaunt\n* Baltoy\n* Claydol\n* Lileep\n* Cradily\n* Anorith\n* Armaldo\n* Feebas\n* Milotic\n* Castform\n* Kecleon\n* Shuppet\n* Banette\n* Duskull\n* Dusclops\n* Tropius\n* Chimecho\n* Absol\n* Wynaut\n* Snorunt\n* Glalie\n* Spheal\n* Sealeo\n* Walrein\n* Clamperl\n* Huntail\n* Gorebyss\n* Relicanth\n* Luvdisc\n* Bagon\n* Shelgon\n* Salamence\n* Beldum\n* Metang\n* Metagross\n* Regirock\n* Regice\n* Registeel\n* Latias\n* Latios\n* Kyogre\n* Groudon\n* Rayquaza\n* Jirachi\n* Deoxys\n\n\n\nList of Pok√©mon species introduced in Generation III (2002)[nb 1]\n| Name\n | National Pok√©dexnumber\n | Type(s) | Evolves from\n | Evolves into\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese\n | Primary\n | Secondary\n |\n| Treecko\n | *Kimori* („Ç≠„É¢„É™)[4] | 0252 | Grass\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Grovyle (#253) | Treecko has claws at the bottom of its feet so it can scale walls and ceilings.

They stated, \"A kung fu chicken? What's not to like?\". In a poll of the best Pok√©mon from *Ruby* and *Sapphire* in celebration of the games having 10 years under their belt, Blaziken was ranked in third place.[10] Another poll of the best Pok√©mon introduced in *Ruby*, *Sapphire*, and *Emerald* placed Blaziken third.[11] GamesRadar used Blaziken as an example of a human-shaped Pok√©mon done right.[12] The Escapist's John Funk wrote that Blaziken was an \"awesome\" example of a Pok√©mon that players who refused to play past *Red* and *Blue* were missing out on.[13] *Game Informer*'s Jeff Marchiafava felt that Blaziken was less cool than other Fire-type Pok√©mon and stated that it has a 1970s \"vibe\". While he felt that the Mega Evolution was an improvement, he called it a \"Mega Disappointment.\"[14] Kotaku's Eric Jou also felt that it had a weak design and cited it as an example of *Ruby* and *Sapphire*'s weak Pok√©mon designs.[15] Several critics and websites have noted that Blaziken would be a good choice for a playable character in *Super Smash Bros.*.[16][17][18] It was the first Pok√©mon capable of knowing Blaze Kick.

In *Pok√©mon Omega Ruby* and *Alpha Sapphire*, it was given a new type of form, a Primal Form.\n |\n| Groudon\n | *GurƒÅdon* („Ç∞„É©„Éº„Éâ„É≥)[29] | 0383 | Ground\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Primal Reversion | It can expand the land continuously. It had a destructive battle with Kyogre over rule of the land until Rayquaza stopped it. In *Pok√©mon Omega Ruby* and *Alpha Sapphire*, it was given a new type of form, a Primal Form.\n |\n| Rayquaza\n | *Rekk≈´za* („É¨„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Ç¶„Ç∂)[57] | 0384 | Dragon | Flying\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Mega Evolution | It feeds on meteorites to fuel its Mega Evolution while it lives in the ozone layer. It once came down to stop the massive fight between Groudon and Kyogre. In *Pok√©mon Omega Ruby* and *Alpha Sapphire*, it was given a Mega Evolution.\n |\n| Jirachi\n | *JirƒÅchi* („Ç∏„É©„Éº„ÉÅ)[33] | 0385 | Steel\n | Psychic\n | No evolution\n | Legend says that Jirachi sleeps every 1,000 years, and if you write your wishes on the tags on its forehead, it might grant them. Jirachi has an eye on its stomach, and is the only Pok√©mon capable of learning Doom Desire. It was first made available via a bonus disc that came with *Pok√©mon Colosseum*, which also showed a preview of the movie it starred in: *Pok√©mon: Jirachi‚ÄîWish Maker*.\n |\n| Deoxys\n | *Deokishisu* („Éá„Ç™„Ç≠„Ç∑„Çπ)[57] | 0386 | Psychic\n | No evolution\n | Deoxys is capable of changing between four \"Formes\": Normal, Attack, Defence, and Speed. Each of which differs by base stat values, effort value yield, and appearance.[58] Deoxys is an alien that was born when a crystal had been hit with UV rays. In March 2005, NASA teamed up with the *Pok√©mon Trading Card Game* team to use Deoxys' likeness to educate children about outer space and the ozone layer. As part of this endeavor, NASA created browser games on its website and Nintendo of America distributed promotional bracelets and postcards.[59] It could be captured after completing a post game story titled The Delta Episode in *Pok√©mon Omega Ruby* and *Alpha Sapphire*, being the first Mythical Pok√©mon to be available outside of events. It also starred in its own movie alongside Rayquaza, *Pok√©mon: Destiny Deoxys*.\n |\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nReception to Generation III's Pok√©mon has been polarising. Alex Carlson of *Hardcore Gamer* wrote in 2014 that the third generation of *Pok√©mon* games was not well received by fans of the series, with some people calling the generation the \"worst in the series history\".[2] This was in part because *Ruby* and *Sapphire* did not allow players to transfer in their Pok√©mon from previous generations and, because of this, many older Pok√©mon were completely unavailable in the games until *Pok√©mon FireRed* and *LeafGreen* were released a few years later.[60] Meanwhile, many of the new Pok√©mon designs, such as those for Torchic, Feebas, Luvdisc, Castform and Clamperl, were criticised for being unoriginal.[2][60][61] Contrastingly, some designs, including Breloom, Aggron, and the aforementioned Castform were praised for their coolness, with the large variety of unique legendary Pok√©mon also helping the third generation feel fresh and new.[62] While *Ruby* and *Sapphire* were recognized for introducing less memorable designs than their predecessors, designs like Milotic, Salamence, Metagross, Rayquaza, and Blaziken made the overall generation a satisfying supplement to the existing Pok√©dex.[63]\n\n\nThe third generation has had its share of enduringly popular designs. Eighteen years after the release of *Ruby* and *Sapphire*, Rayquaza and Gardevoir finished eighth and ninth in 2020's Pok√©mon of the Year vote,[64] with Flygon, Sceptile, and Blaziken also among the top 30.[65] Rayquaza also finished eighth in a 2016 Japanese poll, with Jirachi and Kyogre among the top 25.[66] A popularity vote on the Pok√©mon subreddit featured Blaziken at 5th, joined in the top 25 by Gardevoir, Absol, Flygon, and Mudkip.[67]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Details on Pok√©mon names, National Pok√©dex numbers, types and evolutions are obtained from The Pok√©mon Company International's online Pok√©dex.[3]\n2. **^** Only Galarian Linoone (introduced in *Pok√©mon Sword* and *Shield*) are capable of evolving into Obstagoon.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Starting in *X* and *Y*, Ralts, Kirlia, Gardevoir, Azurill and Mawile all gained the Fairy type.\n4. **^** Only male Kirlia are capable of evolving into Gallade.
