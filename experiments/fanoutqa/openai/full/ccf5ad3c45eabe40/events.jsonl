From left to right: Maki Zen'in, Megumi Fushiguro, Nobara Kugisaki (first row), Dagon (bottom left), Yuji Itadori, Panda, Toge Inumaki (second row), Choso, Suguru Geto, Jogo, Mahito (third row) and Ryomen Sukuna (back)\nThe following article is a list of characters from the manga series *Jujutsu Kaisen* by Gege Akutami.\n\n\n\n\n## Concept and creation[edit]\n\n\nRegarding the process of character creation, the author Gege Akutami claimed that they must fall within the canons of *shōnen* manga in order to capture the attention of readers. Yuji is largely inspired by Akutami's older brother, who is the opposite of Akutami, according to the author's own words, as he had succeeded in sports and study.[1] Akutami said that the message of *Jujutsu Kaisen* is that nobody has the absolute truth, not the \"good guys\" nor the \"bad guys\", and if nobody is right, then nobody is wrong either, and that each character acts according to their own ethics. The Sensui arc of *YuYu Hakusho* inspired Akutami to create evil characters with the goal of eradicating humanity, for whom the readers, nevertheless, would feel a certain empathy.[1] The character of Nobara Kugisaki was written to be the strongest protagonist while Megumi Fushiguro did not stand out too much until the author decided to give him a line where he makes philosophy. Akutami, fearing that the manga would be cancelled, decided to expand the time during which Yuji is dead. The handling of Yoshino led to more regrets to the author about how his story arc was handled.[2]\n\n\nWith Sukuna and Mahito, Akutami wanted to avoid the typical \"deep down they are good\" idea, stating that they are intrinsically evil beings who like to make humans suffer, but Akutami said that it cannot be proved that they are wrong, adding that Mahito was like Thanos in *Avengers: Endgame*, as Akutami never felt hatred for him.[1] For some characters, like Panda and Toge Inumaki, Akutami first created their visual aspects, while the character of Satoru Gojo came from an idea, which represents the paroxysm of force. Sukuna was Akutami's first favorite character due to his design being influenced by everything that Akutami had read, but Kento Nanami was the first character properly created and developed by Akutami, making him the author's later favorite character.[1]\n\n\n\n## Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School[edit]\n\n\n### Students[edit]\n\n\n#### Yuji Itadori[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yuji Itadori\n\nVoiced by: Junya Enoki[3] (Japanese); Adam McArthur[4] (English)\nYuji Itadori (虎杖 悠仁, *Itadori Yūji*) is an athletic teenager who joins his school's Occult Club to avoid the track team. After finding and opening a box containing a cursed charm resembling a rotting finger, his school is attacked by phantom-like creatures called Curses. To protect his friends, he consumes the rotting finger and becomes possessed by a Curse known as Ryoumen Sukuna. Yuji later joins the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of Satoru Gojo, where he is placed under a death sentence, suspended until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers, after which the execution would be carried out to eliminate Sukuna at the same time. Yuji believes in leading everyone to a proper death and wants to save everyone. Yuji feels responsible for the hundreds of thousands of people Sukuna kills at Shibuya and seeks to stop Kenjaku at all costs.\n\n\n\n#### Megumi Fushiguro[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Megumi Fushiguro\n\nVoiced by: Yuma Uchida[3] (Japanese); Robbie Daymond[4] (English)\nMegumi Fushiguro (伏黒 恵, *Fushiguro Megumi*) is a sorcerer studying in the first year at the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of Gojo. He meets Yuji when trying to locate a high-grade cursed charm talisman at his high school. Megumi is the one that convinces Satoru to try to save Yuji from his execution after his possession by Sukuna. Megumi possesses the \"Ten Shadows Technique\" (十種影法術, *Tokusa no Kage Bōjutsu*). He uses his curse power to create spirits (式神, *Shikigami*) out of his own shadows to exorcise Curses. He has been noted to have high potential as a sorcerer by several other powerful people, including Sukuna himself. He was originally going to be sold to the Zenin clan (one of the big three prestigious families of sorcerers), which was stopped by Gojo, and thus Megumi became a sorcerer himself. The head of the Zen'in clan, Naobito suffers grievous injuries fighting Dagon at Shibuya, and names Megumi as the next head of the Zen'in clan before dying. He and Yuji then compete in the Culling Games in order to save his sister Tsumiki. After the truth about his sister being possessed by Heian Era sorcerer Yorozu is revealed, Sukuna takes the opportunity and possesses Megumi, becoming his new vessel. After possessing Megumi, Sukuna is resolved to kill Yorozu, who is madly in love with him, in order to completely sink Megumi's consciousness into despair by turning him into his own sister's killer. Though Yorozu extends much of her force and uses her Domain Expansion on Sukuna, the latter summons Megumi's shikigami, including Mahoraga and succeeds in killing Yorozu, as well as Tsumiki. When the jujutsu sorcerers successfully release Gojo from the Prison Realm, Gojo challenges Sukuna to a duel on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n\n#### Nobara Kugisaki[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nobara Kugisaki\n\nVoiced by: Asami Seto[3] (Japanese); Anne Yatco[4] (English)\nNobara Kugisaki (釘崎 野薔薇, *Kugisaki Nobara*) is a sorcerer studying in the first year at the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of Gojo. Nobara transferred to the college so that she could move from the countryside without any expenses. She meets Yuji and Megumi during her first official mission as a sorcerer. Nobara possesses the \"Straw Doll Technique\" (芻霊呪法, *Sūrei Juhō*). She carries a toolkit consisting of a strawdoll, a weapon hammer and nails as her primary choice of combat. Nobara looks up to a person called Saori who lived in their village and wishes to meet her sometime again. During the chaos at Shibuya on October 31, she ends up severely disfigured by Mahito and her current status is unknown.\n\n\n\n#### Maki Zen'in[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Maki Zen'in\n\nVoiced by: Mikako Komatsu[5] (Japanese); Allegra Clark[6] (English)\nMaki Zen'in (禪院 真希, *Zen'in Maki*) is a second year student at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School. Along with Toge and Panda, she recruits Megumi and Nobara (and later Yuji) to participate in the Sister School Exchange Event with Kyoto Prefectural Jujutsu High School. Maki comes from a prestigious sorcerer clan and is poised to be the next heir as the head's eldest child, but due to her lack of Cursed Energy, she and her twin sister Mai were demoted to being the clan's servants. She later left the clan to attend Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School and become a Jujutsu Sorcerer. Having no Cursed Energy, Maki requires the use of glasses to see Curses and uses a variety of weapons as Cursed Tools. However, being born with a Heavenly Restriction (天与呪縛, *Ten'yo Jubaku*), she possesses superhuman physical prowess, which more than makes up for her lack of curse power. During the events at Shibuya, Jogo burns her entire body, and she only survives thanks to the Heavenly Pact. After the events at Shibuya, she lays waste to her clan, in order to gain access to their armory containing weapons useful in the fight against Kenjaku, during this ordeal she becomes even more powerful, which comes with her sister, Mai's sacrifice.

They engage in fierce battle, during which Maki is significantly injured. She is forced to retreat, in order to heal, as Noritoshi takes it upon himself to hold off Naoya until she can exorcise it, even if it costs his life.

Inumaki possesses the Cursed Speech Technique \"Jugon\" (呪言). He keeps his mouth covered and speaks only in various ingredients of rice balls.

During the Shibuya Incident, he is accidentally caught in Sukuna's Domain Expansion and loses an arm.\n\n\n\n#### Panda[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Tomokazu Seki[5] (Japanese); Matthew David Rudd[8] (English)\nPanda (パンダ) is a second year student at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School who takes part in the Sister School Exchange Event.

Yuta was initially a cursed victim of Special-Grade, haunted by the spirit of his childhood friend, Rika Orimoto. Satoru Gojo took charge of Yuta's case and enrolled him at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School, where he befriended Maki Zen'in, Toge Inumaki and Panda. After training with Gojo and the other students, Yuta learns to control his cursed energy and becomes a skilled swordsman. Even after Rika's curse is lifted, Yuta maintains his Special-Grade ranking, so much so that he can beat Suguru Geto, and Gojo has stated that Yuta has the potential to overcome him. Yuta's great power comes from being a descendant of one of the three great sorcerer clans (which makes him a distant relative to Gojo) and is the reason he cursed Rika when he refused her death at a young age. Yuta is still a sophomore at the institute, studying abroad. He later comes back as the executioner of Itadori Yuji after Gojo had been sealed, though the two soon team up afterwards, in order to rid the world of Kenjaku.

Following Yuta's advice, Megumi and Yuji seek him out to gain his help against Kenjaku, and soon find him at his illegal fight club. Upon hearing that Gojo has been sealed and Yaga was executed, Kinji agrees to help defeat Kenjaku. He later shows up in the Tokyo No. 2 Colony of the Culling Games, in an attempt to recruit French sorcerer and manga artist, Charles Bernard to their battle against Kenjaku. His innate technique allows him to spontaneously create and manipulate Pachinko machine parts, such as sliding doors. By expanding this technique into a domain, Hakari places himself and others inside a Pachinko machine, the appearance of which reflects how close Hakari is to a jackpot. Additionally, his cursed energy is inherently harmful to the touch, making him a particularly dangerous fighter in close combat. Using this technique, he is able to beat the reincarnated sorcerer, Hajime Kashimo after he had gravely injured Panda, forcing him into an alliance.\n\n\n\n#### Kirara Hoshi[edit]\n\n\nKirara Hoshi (星綺羅羅, *Hoshi Kirara*) is a third-year student at Tokyo Jujutsu High who is currently suspended for clashing with authority.

As a result, Satoru is widely respected by sorcerers and greatly influences the sorcery world. He convinces his superiors at the college to keep Yuji Itadori alive until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers. He teaches Yuji, Megumi Fushiguro, and Nobara Kugisaki. The Special Grade Cursed Spirits ambushed him at Shibuya, and Kenjaku managed to seal him away after he exorcised Hanami.

According to legend, he was a four-armed, two-faced demon god resembling a human amid Jujutsu's golden age, the Heian period, though in reality was an actual human (though mutated) sorcerer. Enemy sorcerers of his time could not kill him, and eventually, Sukuna converted himself into a special-grade cursed object, a set of twenty indestructible fingers preserved in grave wax, to be able to traverse the ages and incarnate into suitable vessels should a finger be consumed. Currently, Sukuna is the \"guest\" of the body of Yuji Itadori, who agrees to let himself be killed to avoid further massacres. He has expressed notable interest in Megumi Fushiguro's abilities and plans to regain his power and body.

Kenjaku worked along with Mahito's group to carry out his plans. However, he does not see them as allies and had ulterior motives using Geto's Cursed Manipulation Technique which he acquired in possession of his body.

Similarly, he cannot see Cursed Spirits but is able to \"see everything else\" - this led Maki to ponder what makes her different from both Hagane and Toji.\n\n\n\n### Rokujushi Miyo[edit]\n\n\nRokujushi Miyo (大道 鋼, *Miyo Rokujūshi*) is an incarnated sorcerer that Kamo and Maki unexpectedly allied with in Sakurajima Colony. Miyo is a sumo enthusiast and is visually similar to a Kappa. Despite his eccentric personality, Rokujushi acted as a sincere mentor for Maki (in contrast to Gojo and Kusakabe) and helped her reach her full potential in their brief sumo match.\n\n\n\n## Light novel characters[edit]\n\n\n### Tanabe[edit]\n\n\nTanabe is an auxiliary manager from Kyoto Prefectural Jujutsu High School. He oversees the missions handled by the Second Year Students, Mai Zen'in, Kokichi Muta, and Kasumi Miwa. He first appeared in the series' second light novel, *Jujutsu Kaisen: Yoake no Ibara Michi*.\n\n\n\n### Kairi Minato[edit]\n\n\nKairi Minato (湊 海里, *Minato Kairi*) is a character from the series' first light novel, *Jujutsu Kaisen: Iku Natsu to Kaeru Aki*. Set during Yuji's time in hiding and secret training after being declared dead, Yuji encounters Minato in a park. The boy unknowingly manifested a Cursed Spirit that appears in front of his adoptive parent's home at night. Yuji ultimately defeated it after a lesson from Gojo. \n\n\n\n### Yu Makimura[edit]\n\n\nYu Makimura (牧村 ゆう, *Makimura Yū*) is a character from the second light novel. She is a young girl who looks up to Mai Zen'in after seeing her exorcise a Cursed Spirit. She became a 'Window' for Jujutsu Tech, a person who informs the school of cursed-related activities. She has the ability to see cursed spirits, but does not have the abilities to become a sorcerer.\n\n\n\n### Tsurube Kaya[edit]\n\n\nTsurube Kaya (鶴瓶 香弥, *Kaya Tsurube*) is the antagonist from the second light novel. He is a curse user who has a Curse Words Technique. Similar to the Inumaki clan's Cursed Speech, albeit it is much weaker and requires an amplifier such as a talisman to strengthen its effects. Tsurube was able to use his technique on Nobara, making her believe that he was a talent scout. Tsurube was selling information regarding the Jujutsu High School but was defeated by Nobara after freeing herself from his Cursed Words and using a makeshift straw doll to activate her technique. \n\n\n\n### Koizumi[edit]\n\n\nKoizumi is a curse user from the second light novel, working for Tsurube. He was defeated by Inumaki and Nobara.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Martigan, Val (October 7, 2020). \"Gege Akutami: \"Pour le héros de mon manga, je me suis inspiré de mon frère\"\". *Le Figaro Magazine* (in French).

From left to right: Maki Zen'in, Megumi Fushiguro, Nobara Kugisaki (first row), Dagon (bottom left), Yuji Itadori, Panda, Toge Inumaki (second row), Choso, Suguru Geto, Jogo, Mahito (third row) and Ryomen Sukuna (back)\nThe following article is a list of characters from the manga series *Jujutsu Kaisen* by Gege Akutami.\n\n\n\n\n## Concept and creation[edit]\n\n\nRegarding the process of character creation, the author Gege Akutami claimed that they must fall within the canons of *shōnen* manga in order to capture the attention of readers. Yuji is largely inspired by Akutami's older brother, who is the opposite of Akutami, according to the author's own words, as he had succeeded in sports and study.[1] Akutami said that the message of *Jujutsu Kaisen* is that nobody has the absolute truth, not the \"good guys\" nor the \"bad guys\", and if nobody is right, then nobody is wrong either, and that each character acts according to their own ethics. The Sensui arc of *YuYu Hakusho* inspired Akutami to create evil characters with the goal of eradicating humanity, for whom the readers, nevertheless, would feel a certain empathy.[1] The character of Nobara Kugisaki was written to be the strongest protagonist while Megumi Fushiguro did not stand out too much until the author decided to give him a line where he makes philosophy. Akutami, fearing that the manga would be cancelled, decided to expand the time during which Yuji is dead. The handling of Yoshino led to more regrets to the author about how his story arc was handled.[2]\n\n\nWith Sukuna and Mahito, Akutami wanted to avoid the typical \"deep down they are good\" idea, stating that they are intrinsically evil beings who like to make humans suffer, but Akutami said that it cannot be proved that they are wrong, adding that Mahito was like Thanos in *Avengers: Endgame*, as Akutami never felt hatred for him.[1] For some characters, like Panda and Toge Inumaki, Akutami first created their visual aspects, while the character of Satoru Gojo came from an idea, which represents the paroxysm of force. Sukuna was Akutami's first favorite character due to his design being influenced by everything that Akutami had read, but Kento Nanami was the first character properly created and developed by Akutami, making him the author's later favorite character.[1]\n\n\n\n## Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School[edit]\n\n\n### Students[edit]\n\n\n#### Yuji Itadori[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yuji Itadori\n\nVoiced by: Junya Enoki[3] (Japanese); Adam McArthur[4] (English)\nYuji Itadori (虎杖 悠仁, *Itadori Yūji*) is an athletic teenager who joins his school's Occult Club to avoid the track team. After finding and opening a box containing a cursed charm resembling a rotting finger, his school is attacked by phantom-like creatures called Curses. To protect his friends, he consumes the rotting finger and becomes possessed by a Curse known as Ryoumen Sukuna. Yuji later joins the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of Satoru Gojo, where he is placed under a death sentence, suspended until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers, after which the execution would be carried out to eliminate Sukuna at the same time. Yuji believes in leading everyone to a proper death and wants to save everyone. Yuji feels responsible for the hundreds of thousands of people Sukuna kills at Shibuya and seeks to stop Kenjaku at all costs.\n\n\n\n#### Megumi Fushiguro[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Megumi Fushiguro\n\nVoiced by: Yuma Uchida[3] (Japanese); Robbie Daymond[4] (English)\nMegumi Fushiguro (伏黒 恵, *Fushiguro Megumi*) is a sorcerer studying in the first year at the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of Gojo. He meets Yuji when trying to locate a high-grade cursed charm talisman at his high school. Megumi is the one that convinces Satoru to try to save Yuji from his execution after his possession by Sukuna. Megumi possesses the \"Ten Shadows Technique\" (十種影法術, *Tokusa no Kage Bōjutsu*). He uses his curse power to create spirits (式神, *Shikigami*) out of his own shadows to exorcise Curses. He has been noted to have high potential as a sorcerer by several other powerful people, including Sukuna himself. He was originally going to be sold to the Zenin clan (one of the big three prestigious families of sorcerers), which was stopped by Gojo, and thus Megumi became a sorcerer himself. The head of the Zen'in clan, Naobito suffers grievous injuries fighting Dagon at Shibuya, and names Megumi as the next head of the Zen'in clan before dying. He and Yuji then compete in the Culling Games in order to save his sister Tsumiki. After the truth about his sister being possessed by Heian Era sorcerer Yorozu is revealed, Sukuna takes the opportunity and possesses Megumi, becoming his new vessel. After possessing Megumi, Sukuna is resolved to kill Yorozu, who is madly in love with him, in order to completely sink Megumi's consciousness into despair by turning him into his own sister's killer. Though Yorozu extends much of her force and uses her Domain Expansion on Sukuna, the latter summons Megumi's shikigami, including Mahoraga and succeeds in killing Yorozu, as well as Tsumiki. When the jujutsu sorcerers successfully release Gojo from the Prison Realm, Gojo challenges Sukuna to a duel on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n\n#### Nobara Kugisaki[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nobara Kugisaki\n\nVoiced by: Asami Seto[3] (Japanese); Anne Yatco[4] (English)\nNobara Kugisaki (釘崎 野薔薇, *Kugisaki Nobara*) is a sorcerer studying in the first year at the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of Gojo.

She later left the clan to attend Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School and become a Jujutsu Sorcerer. Having no Cursed Energy, Maki requires the use of glasses to see Curses and uses a variety of weapons as Cursed Tools. However, being born with a Heavenly Restriction (天与呪縛, *Ten'yo Jubaku*), she possesses superhuman physical prowess, which more than makes up for her lack of curse power. During the events at Shibuya, Jogo burns her entire body, and she only survives thanks to the Heavenly Pact. After the events at Shibuya, she lays waste to her clan, in order to gain access to their armory containing weapons useful in the fight against Kenjaku, during this ordeal she becomes even more powerful, which comes with her sister, Mai's sacrifice. She joins the Culling Games as a player, and due to her special circumstance, is able to leave and enter barriers. Noritoshi Kamo from Kyoto school soon joins her side in the colony, but they are set upon by the special grade cursed spirit created from Naoya Zen'in, who has arrived to avenge his own death at the hands of Maki and her mother. They engage in fierce battle, during which Maki is significantly injured. She is forced to retreat, in order to heal, as Noritoshi takes it upon himself to hold off Naoya until she can exorcise it, even if it costs his life.

Yuta was initially a cursed victim of Special-Grade, haunted by the spirit of his childhood friend, Rika Orimoto. Satoru Gojo took charge of Yuta's case and enrolled him at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School, where he befriended Maki Zen'in, Toge Inumaki and Panda. After training with Gojo and the other students, Yuta learns to control his cursed energy and becomes a skilled swordsman. Even after Rika's curse is lifted, Yuta maintains his Special-Grade ranking, so much so that he can beat Suguru Geto, and Gojo has stated that Yuta has the potential to overcome him. Yuta's great power comes from being a descendant of one of the three great sorcerer clans (which makes him a distant relative to Gojo) and is the reason he cursed Rika when he refused her death at a young age. Yuta is still a sophomore at the institute, studying abroad. He later comes back as the executioner of Itadori Yuji after Gojo had been sealed, though the two soon team up afterwards, in order to rid the world of Kenjaku.

Following Yuta's advice, Megumi and Yuji seek him out to gain his help against Kenjaku, and soon find him at his illegal fight club. Upon hearing that Gojo has been sealed and Yaga was executed, Kinji agrees to help defeat Kenjaku. He later shows up in the Tokyo No. 2 Colony of the Culling Games, in an attempt to recruit French sorcerer and manga artist, Charles Bernard to their battle against Kenjaku. His innate technique allows him to spontaneously create and manipulate Pachinko machine parts, such as sliding doors. By expanding this technique into a domain, Hakari places himself and others inside a Pachinko machine, the appearance of which reflects how close Hakari is to a jackpot. Additionally, his cursed energy is inherently harmful to the touch, making him a particularly dangerous fighter in close combat. Using this technique, he is able to beat the reincarnated sorcerer, Hajime Kashimo after he had gravely injured Panda, forcing him into an alliance.\n\n\n\n#### Kirara Hoshi[edit]\n\n\nKirara Hoshi (星綺羅羅, *Hoshi Kirara*) is a third-year student at Tokyo Jujutsu High who is currently suspended for clashing with authority.

Even though his title of 'The Strongest' is self-proclaimed, most allies and enemies alike never actually dispute the title and consider him one of the most dangerous people alive. As a result, Satoru is widely respected by sorcerers and greatly influences the sorcery world. He convinces his superiors at the college to keep Yuji Itadori alive until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers. He teaches Yuji, Megumi Fushiguro, and Nobara Kugisaki. The Special Grade Cursed Spirits ambushed him at Shibuya, and Kenjaku managed to seal him away after he exorcised Hanami.

According to legend, he was a four-armed, two-faced demon god resembling a human amid Jujutsu's golden age, the Heian period, though in reality was an actual human (though mutated) sorcerer. Enemy sorcerers of his time could not kill him, and eventually, Sukuna converted himself into a special-grade cursed object, a set of twenty indestructible fingers preserved in grave wax, to be able to traverse the ages and incarnate into suitable vessels should a finger be consumed. Currently, Sukuna is the \"guest\" of the body of Yuji Itadori, who agrees to let himself be killed to avoid further massacres. He has expressed notable interest in Megumi Fushiguro's abilities and plans to regain his power and body. Whenever Sukuna possesses Itadori, characteristic tattoos form on Itadori's body and two extra eyes open on Itadori's cheeks. Satoru Gojo claims he can beat a fully-restored Sukuna, but the latter has expressed a desire to kill him, and his power is such that all other Cursed Spirits are attempting to restore him. When Itadori is fed ten of Sukuna's fingers at once at Shibuya, Sukuna comes out and commits mass killing at Shibuya. During the Culling Games, Sukuna seizes his opportunity by ripping off Yuji's pinky finger and force feeding it to Megumi allowing Sukana to transfer himself to possess Fushiguro's body, becoming his new vessel. He then kills Megumi's sister Tsumiki, who was currently possessed by Yorozu, a Heian era sorcerer obsessed with him. After Gojo is released by his students, Sukuna is challenged by Gojo to a duel on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n\n### Kenjaku[edit]\n\n\nKenjaku (羂索) orchestrated the Shibuya Incident and the Culling Game, to which he plans on recreating the Heian era, the Golden Age of Sorcery, in modern Japan.

In reality, Kenjaku is a mysterious ancient sorcerer who had taken over the bodies of many sorcerers in many eras, among them being the ancestor Noritoshi Kamo whose body he used to make the Death Paintings and currently has possessed Geto's dead body. Kenjaku worked along with Mahito's group to carry out his plans. However, he does not see them as allies and had ulterior motives using Geto's Cursed Manipulation Technique which he acquired in possession of his body. Kenjaku's 'true form' is a brain with a mouth where he transfers himself into different hosts of his choice and they can be recognized with the horizontal stitches around their head. During the Culling Games, he approaches Sasaki, Itadori's friend and classmate at his previous school and thanks her for taking care of \"his\" son. A while after the start of the Culling Games, he resumes his identity as Noritoshi Kamo and head of the clan, exiling the current Noritoshi.

He is sadistic, immature, and loves to play with human emotions, even when his life is in danger. He believes life has no value or meaning; therefore, everyone should do what they want. This mentality seems to stem from Mahito's ability to perceive and manipulate souls, which makes him see the soul (and, by extension, the heart) as nothing more than an object. His cursed power allows him to manipulate the soul of himself and others by changing the body's shape, thus enabling him to transfigure the bodies of his victims by turning them into disfigured creatures at his service.

His pride makes him numb toward humans and casually kills them, but it also leads to overconfidence. Despite warnings that his entire group could not kill Satoru, Jogo attempted to defeat him in a single fight and was completely overwhelmed. During the Shibuya Incident, he tries to convince the rampaging Sukuna to join their ranks. Nevertheless, Sukuna utilizes his own fire-based attacks and effortlessly exterminates the cursed spirit, though not before congratulating him for fighting and dying with dignity.\n\n\n\n### Dagon[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Kenta Miyake, Aya Endō (Cursed Womb)[18]\nDagon (陀艮) is an octopus-like Special Grade Cursed Spirit born from the negative emotions associated with the ocean.

He fully developed into a form similar to Cthulhu in Shibuya after eating hundreds of people in the subway. He deeply cares for Hanami, Jogo and Mahito, treating them as family and was enraged when hearing of Hanami's death. His cursed power allows him to manifest water out of his mouth, completely flooding the subways of Shibuya, but what makes him an even deadlier opponent is his Domain Expansion which traps his victims on a tropical beach swarming with carnivorous fish shikigami.

He was later defeated by Yuta Okkotsu and thus ignited a huge battle among the remaining powerful players. \n\n\n\n### Kurourushi[edit]\n\n\nKurourushi (黒沐死) is a special grade Cursed Spirit born from people's negative emotions of cockroaches. He was released from Cursed Spirit Manipulation of Suguru Geto's technique under the possession of Kenjaku to become a player of the Culling Game. He terrorizes his victims in the Sendai colony by manipulating a wave of cockroaches to feed on their flesh. He was exorcised by Yuta Okkotsu but an offspring appeared later on that was again defeated by Okkotsu in the battle between Uro Takako and Ryuu Ishigouri. \n\n\n\n### Ryuu Ishigouri[edit]\n\n\nRyuu Ishigouri (石流 龍, *Ishigōri Ryū*) is an ancient sorcerer from 400 years ago that reincarnated into the modern era as a player for the Culling Game. Ishigouri, along with Takako Uro, Dhruv Lakdawalla and Kurourushi were the most powerful players within the Sendai colony creating a deadlock between the four. Ryuu Ishigouri gained some notoriety by having the highest cursed energy output ever recorded. He has the curse technique to create a huge blast of cursed energy from his hair.\n\n\n\n### Takako Uro[edit]\n\n\nTakako Uro (鳥鷺 亨子, *Uro Takako*) is an ancient sorcerer that Kenjaku reincarnated as a player for the Culling Game. Takako, Ishigouri, Dhruv Lakdawalla and Kurourushi were the most powerful players within the Sendai colony, creating a deadlock between the four. In her first life, Takako Uro was the captain of the Sun, Moon, and Stars Squad, a group of assassins affiliated with the Toh. She has the cursed technique that allows her to manipulate the sky.\n\n\n\n### Charles Bernard[edit]\n\n\nCharles Bernard is a modern sorcerer and the first opponent Hakari Kinji encounters in Tokyo Colony No.2. He is an 'otaku' of French descent who aspires to be a successful mangaka in Japan but could not handle the criticisms of his work. His curse technique incorporates manga creation and allows him to predict his opponents' movements by 'skipping ahead of panels'.\n\n\n\n### Hajime Kashimo[edit]\n\n\nHajime Kashimo (鹿紫雲一, *Kashimo Hajime*) is an ancient sorcerer and the top player of the Culling Game who has killed over 40 people. He later spent his points to add a new rule to the game so he could find Sukuna. After encountering and overpowering Panda in Tokyo Colony No.2, Hakari Kinji joined the fight to his aid. After an exhausting fight, Kinji manages to overwhelm Kashimo and force him into cooperation.\n\n\n\n### Hagane Daido[edit]\n\n\nHagane Daido (大道 鋼, *Daidō Hagane*) is an incarnated swordsman that Kamo and Maki unexpectedly allied with in Sakurajima Colony. Hagane is a lethal fighter with a sword and is able to fight the Vengeful Spirit of Naoya, an opponent Maki was struggling with despite wielding no Cursed Energy. Similarly, he cannot see Cursed Spirits but is able to \"see everything else\" - this led Maki to ponder what makes her different from both Hagane and Toji.\n\n\n\n### Rokujushi Miyo[edit]\n\n\nRokujushi Miyo (大道 鋼, *Miyo Rokujūshi*) is an incarnated sorcerer that Kamo and Maki unexpectedly allied with in Sakurajima Colony. Miyo is a sumo enthusiast and is visually similar to a Kappa. Despite his eccentric personality, Rokujushi acted as a sincere mentor for Maki (in contrast to Gojo and Kusakabe) and helped her reach her full potential in their brief sumo match.\n\n\n\n## Light novel characters[edit]\n\n\n### Tanabe[edit]\n\n\nTanabe is an auxiliary manager from Kyoto Prefectural Jujutsu High School. He oversees the missions handled by the Second Year Students, Mai Zen'in, Kokichi Muta, and Kasumi Miwa. He first appeared in the series' second light novel, *Jujutsu Kaisen: Yoake no Ibara Michi*.\n\n\n\n### Kairi Minato[edit]\n\n\nKairi Minato (湊 海里, *Minato Kairi*) is a character from the series' first light novel, *Jujutsu Kaisen: Iku Natsu to Kaeru Aki*. Set during Yuji's time in hiding and secret training after being declared dead, Yuji encounters Minato in a park. The boy unknowingly manifested a Cursed Spirit that appears in front of his adoptive parent's home at night. Yuji ultimately defeated it after a lesson from Gojo. \n\n\n\n### Yu Makimura[edit]\n\n\nYu Makimura (牧村 ゆう, *Makimura Yū*) is a character from the second light novel. She is a young girl who looks up to Mai Zen'in after seeing her exorcise a Cursed Spirit. She became a 'Window' for Jujutsu Tech, a person who informs the school of cursed-related activities. She has the ability to see cursed spirits, but does not have the abilities to become a sorcerer.\n\n\n\n### Tsurube Kaya[edit]\n\n\nTsurube Kaya (鶴瓶 香弥, *Kaya Tsurube*) is the antagonist from the second light novel. He is a curse user who has a Curse Words Technique. Similar to the Inumaki clan's Cursed Speech, albeit it is much weaker and requires an amplifier such as a talisman to strengthen its effects. Tsurube was able to use his technique on Nobara, making her believe that he was a talent scout. Tsurube was selling information regarding the Jujutsu High School but was defeated by Nobara after freeing herself from his Cursed Words and using a makeshift straw doll to activate her technique. \n\n\n\n### Koizumi[edit]\n\n\nKoizumi is a curse user from the second light novel, working for Tsurube. He was defeated by Inumaki and Nobara.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Martigan, Val (October 7, 2020). \"Gege Akutami: \"Pour le héros de mon manga, je me suis inspiré de mon frère\"\". *Le Figaro Magazine* (in French).

The manga mentions Maki's origins as a reject from the Zen'in clan which is further explored in the sequel *Jujutsu Kaisen* where she is one year older and deals with several enemies.\n\n\nAkutami created Maki as a character whose origins would be further explored in the series future with her fighting style being a mix of several ones envisioned in one. She is voiced by Mikako Komatsu in Japanese and Allegra Clark in English. Critical response to Maki's character has been positive in both *Jujutsu Kaisen* and the prequel for her striking personality and fighting skills, with the latter often noted to be strange to see in series aimed towards a male demography.\n\n\n\n\n## Creation[edit]\n\n\nThough Maki was better known in *Jujutsu Kaisen*, manga author Gege Akutami recommended main series readers to check the prequel *Jujutsu Kaisen 0* for a better understanding of her life. Her hair's length is something Akutami tends to change whenever he likes. Akutami also enjoys writing how Maki is shown to particularly strong physically in early in the series due to how she destroys a weapon using brute force.[1] Akutami enjoyed writing a scene in which Yuta comforts Maki Zen'in in the third chapter, which causes Maki to leave and blush angrily about whether or not should feel accepted by him. Upon seeing this scene, Akutami's editor Katayama said Yuta really understood Maki's feelings. Akutami decided to revise this scene in the storyboard following his editor's praise.[2]\n\n\nBoth the original mini-series and the main *Jujutsu Kaisen* manga early explore issues Maki has with other members from Zen'in clan to the point her weaponry is surprising but is related to the mentor Satoru Gojo. Akutami claimed in the thirteen volume that he planned to explore more focus more on the Zen'in clan problems.[3] Her design went from normal glasses to black-frames in the sequel but only for the fight against Suguru Geto. When asked by why Maki often refers to Todo by his surname, Akutami mentioned it is a tendency of her to call others by their first name unless the others call her by her last name. As a result, he mentions any contradictions when dealing with others might come across as plot holes. Originally, Maki uses a weapon to compensate for her lack of spells. Akutami claimed in the series' fanbook that a major theme in the manga is Maki becoming a stronger Jujutsu sorcerer which is meant to be the focus on future installments. Maki's fighting style was based on both aikido and a mix of Chinese martial arts.[2]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mikako Komatsu voices Maki\nMikako Komatsu voices Maki who noted the dynamic between her character, Panda and Toge Inumaki provided interesting comedy in both the television series and the movie prequel with Maki often being loud. Originally she was grown up and had an aggressive part, but was conscious that this work feels younger and more momentum in the reaction to what was said and what happened than in the TV series. Komatsu felt that the movie helped to explore her character's weakness, especially when she bonds with the shy Yuta Okkotsu as a result of their similarities as a result of his weak personality. Maki sees her strength in being able to express her feelings honestly in her weakness, and she feels frustrated in him, and she hits hard. Komatsu finds that Maki becomes more likable when interacting with Yuta despite her initial comments about how she perceives the young man. However, she considers this interaction to be to different from her role in the television series where her work with the protagonist Yuji Itadori who had little to no knowledge about spells. Komatsu also liked working in the movie for her action scenes and her meeting with Megumi Ogata, Yuta's actor, due to her performance.[4]\n\n\nAllegra Clark voices Maki in the English dub who sees her character's most notable traits are both \"vulnerable\" and \"angry\". However, Clark claims that thanks to the handling of these, Maki is enjoyable to play especially with her goals. She noticed about a major contrast between the television series and the movie in regards to how she tells Nobara and Yuta, respectively, what is her desire; In the television series she wants to become a stronger sorcerer while in the movie she instead more angry-driven towards her clan to the point of wanting to take them down. The rage that she felt in the film where she was younger, she is still finding acceptance, and but is not as mature as in the television series. Across the movie, she goes through a personal character arc where she grows more confidence. Satisfied with her role in the movie, Clark made research into the manga and wanted to keep playing Maki due to her further screentime that the anime has yet to explore.[5]\n\n\n\n## Appearances[edit]\n\n\n### *Jujutsu Kaisen 0*[edit]\n\n\nMaki Zen'in debuts in *Jujutsu Kaisen 0* as a young student from Jujutsu High mentored by Satoru Gojo who brings a nervous teenager, Yuta Okkotsu, in order to train him and stop the curse of the undead girl Rika who is attacking everybody chasing Yuta. Early Maki mocks Yuta's weakness for being too passive, believing him to be the often subject of bullying. Although Yuta is unable to fight, he is assigned to work with Maki in exorcising a curse. When Maki is wounded, she asks Yuta what is his real desire to which he responds is that he only wants to enjoy a good life rather than remain alone. Maki encourages him to fight for such rights which allows her partner to control Rika for a brief period of time to escape with her.\nIn the next three months, Maki has become Yuta's mentor in swordplay so that he can also fight alone much to her comrade's surprise. When one of Satoru Gojo's friends, Suguru Geto, appears in Jujutsu High, it is revealed that Maki is a rejected member from the Zen'in clan and is mocked which angers Yuta. After the visit, Maki tells Yuta her hatred towards her clan to which Yuta agrees to fight alongside her, comforting her. Geto once again appears in Jujutsu High to take Rika's Curse, taking down all the students. Yuta takes control of Rika to save his mates, resulting in Geto escaping weakened.\n\n\n\n### *Jujutsu Kaisen*[edit]\n\n\nIn *Jujutsu Kaisen*, Maki appears one year older still as Sorcerer from Jujutsu High alongside Panda and Toge Inumaki as Yuta is working abroad. During an examination where the Kyoto students try to kill newcomer Yuji Itadori for possessing the vengeful spirit of Ryoma Sukuna, Maki joins Yuji's group and defeats her sister Mai who questions why she left their clan. During the Shibuya incident, Maki suffers several major wounds and loses an eye. After the incident, Maki still continues to fight alongside Yuta and the other Jujutsu High students against Geto's predecessor Kenjaku. After Mai sacrifices her life for Maki, she is able to see curses without glasses. After killing their father, she slaughters all members of the Zen'in clan in retribution for the pain she and Mai were forced to undergo during their childhood.\n\n\nShe joins the Culling Games as a player, and due to her special circumstance, is able to leave and enter barriers. Noritoshi Kamo from Kyoto school soon joins her side in the colony, but they are set upon by the special grade cursed spirit created from Naoya Zen'in, who has arrived to avenge his own death at the hands of Maki and her mother. They engage in fierce battle, during which Maki is significantly injured. She is forced to retreat, in order to heal, as Noritoshi takes it upon himself to hold off Naoya until she can exorcise it, even if it costs his life. During her battle with Naoya's cursed spirit, she is fully awakened, becoming just like Toji Fushiguro.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nCritical response to Maki's character in the main series was positive during the Kyoto training arc between the Jujutsu students. When the character was about to show her skills for the first time, Anime News Network was tired of the several fights the arc had and hoped Maki would stand out in the narrative.[6] The eventual battle between the Zen'in sisters earned praise for both the animation and exploration from Maki's past. The Fandom Post called Maki \"the star of the show\" due to how she overshadows her enemies and keeps a cocky personality, surpassing Nobara's character.[7] Comic Book Resources claimed that Maki and Nobara \"crush\" society expectations also focusing on the handling of the sisters, leaving a bitterswit moment due to sadness the episode leaves as the family feuds from the Zen'in clan was not properly explained.[8] Anime News Network enjoyed both the fighting coreography as it was more enjoyable than Yuji's battle among others. The site also found how \"groundbreaking\" the scene where Maki defeats Momo was.[9] The eventual focus on Maki's actions in the series led Comic Book Resources to point out that the Zen'in clan did bad at disapproving Maki since she constantly surprises the audience and cast.[10] Manga News felt the conflicts between the Zen'in sisters was well executed in the manga.[11]\n\n\nThere was also commentary about Maki's role in *Jujutsu Kaisen 0*. According to Real, Maki is fundamental in starting Yuta's recovery from his trauma due to how she encourages him to earn the freedom he wants[12] Mary Sue agreed with a similar praised for developing alongside Yuta;[13] Real Sound particularly praised the bond the Jujutsu sorcerers have in general; in one volume, it is shown Maki trains Yuta and befriends in the process, which gives further depth to the main manga.[14] Anime UK News felt that Maki's role in *Jujutsu Kaisen 0* was better executed than in the main series based on her explored background.[15] Digital Trends also felt that Maki's characterization was outstanding as she does not feel repetitive when dealing with Yuta as she feels different from the television series.[16] Her action scenes were also noted be well executed by Hitc while calling her and the other students as comic relief in contrast to the more serious take on Yuta.[17] *The Mary Sue* enjoyed Maki, calling her \"an absolute QUEEN\" and felt her backstory also standing out despite being similar to the main series.[13] On the other hand, Otaquest lamented the demoted roles of the supporting characters in the finale when they are defeated by Geto.[18] Similarly, Siliconera lamented that Maki's screentime in the film was limited as he liked the character and wished the franchise focused more on her.[19]\n\n\nIn a Viz Media popularity poll conducted in March 2021, Maki was voted as the 11th most-popular character in the *Jujutsu Kaisen* franchise.[20] Mikako Komatsu's performance as Maki was also praised by One Sports, considering her one of the best in the cast.[21] Den of Geek regarded Maki as one of the best used female characters in *shonen manga* due to how she is portrayed as a skilled warrior rather than previous series where the female cast was used for a supportive role. The handling of her fights was also noted as she comes across as equally powerful as the protagonist Yuji Itadori despite having poor energy in comparison which heavily connects to her backstory which she takes seriously.[22] Polygon agreed claiming that while there are series like *Bleach*, *Soul Eater*, *Hunter x Hunter* among feature similar female characters, their roles are limited or have unnispired powered when compared with the ones of the male characters.[23] Comic Book Resources noted that Maki took a somber personality following the Shibuya arc while her body was so damaged in the process that it would surprise anime-only viewers.[24]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Akutami, Gege (2019). *Jujutsu Kaisen*.
