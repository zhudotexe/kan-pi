She is a young student from Jujutsu High, mentored by Satoru Gojo. While working on missions involving Curses, Maki mentors the newcomer Yuta Okkotsu who is trying to control the undead Rika which is attacking innocent people. The manga mentions Maki's origins as a reject from the Zen'in clan which is further explored in the sequel *Jujutsu Kaisen* where she is one year older and deals with several enemies.\n\n\nAkutami created Maki as a character whose origins would be further explored in the series future with her fighting style being a mix of several ones envisioned in one. She is voiced by Mikako Komatsu in Japanese and Allegra Clark in English. Critical response to Maki's character has been positive in both *Jujutsu Kaisen* and the prequel for her striking personality and fighting skills, with the latter often noted to be strange to see in series aimed towards a male demography.\n\n\n\n\n## Creation[edit]\n\n\nThough Maki was better known in *Jujutsu Kaisen*, manga author Gege Akutami recommended main series readers to check the prequel *Jujutsu Kaisen 0* for a better understanding of her life. Her hair's length is something Akutami tends to change whenever he likes. Akutami also enjoys writing how Maki is shown to particularly strong physically in early in the series due to how she destroys a weapon using brute force.[1] Akutami enjoyed writing a scene in which Yuta comforts Maki Zen'in in the third chapter, which causes Maki to leave and blush angrily about whether or not should feel accepted by him. Upon seeing this scene, Akutami's editor Katayama said Yuta really understood Maki's feelings. Akutami decided to revise this scene in the storyboard following his editor's praise.[2]\n\n\nBoth the original mini-series and the main *Jujutsu Kaisen* manga early explore issues Maki has with other members from Zen'in clan to the point her weaponry is surprising but is related to the mentor Satoru Gojo. Akutami claimed in the thirteen volume that he planned to explore more focus more on the Zen'in clan problems.[3] Her design went from normal glasses to black-frames in the sequel but only for the fight against Suguru Geto. When asked by why Maki often refers to Todo by his surname, Akutami mentioned it is a tendency of her to call others by their first name unless the others call her by her last name. As a result, he mentions any contradictions when dealing with others might come across as plot holes. Originally, Maki uses a weapon to compensate for her lack of spells. Akutami claimed in the series' fanbook that a major theme in the manga is Maki becoming a stronger Jujutsu sorcerer which is meant to be the focus on future installments. Maki's fighting style was based on both aikido and a mix of Chinese martial arts.[2]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mikako Komatsu voices Maki\nMikako Komatsu voices Maki who noted the dynamic between her character, Panda and Toge Inumaki provided interesting comedy in both the television series and the movie prequel with Maki often being loud. Originally she was grown up and had an aggressive part, but was conscious that this work feels younger and more momentum in the reaction to what was said and what happened than in the TV series. Komatsu felt that the movie helped to explore her character's weakness, especially when she bonds with the shy Yuta Okkotsu as a result of their similarities as a result of his weak personality. Maki sees her strength in being able to express her feelings honestly in her weakness, and she feels frustrated in him, and she hits hard. Komatsu finds that Maki becomes more likable when interacting with Yuta despite her initial comments about how she perceives the young man. However, she considers this interaction to be to different from her role in the television series where her work with the protagonist Yuji Itadori who had little to no knowledge about spells. Komatsu also liked working in the movie for her action scenes and her meeting with Megumi Ogata, Yuta's actor, due to her performance.[4]\n\n\nAllegra Clark voices Maki in the English dub who sees her character's most notable traits are both \"vulnerable\" and \"angry\". However, Clark claims that thanks to the handling of these, Maki is enjoyable to play especially with her goals. She noticed about a major contrast between the television series and the movie in regards to how she tells Nobara and Yuta, respectively, what is her desire; In the television series she wants to become a stronger sorcerer while in the movie she instead more angry-driven towards her clan to the point of wanting to take them down. The rage that she felt in the film where she was younger, she is still finding acceptance, and but is not as mature as in the television series. Across the movie, she goes through a personal character arc where she grows more confidence. Satisfied with her role in the movie, Clark made research into the manga and wanted to keep playing Maki due to her further screentime that the anime has yet to explore.[5]\n\n\n\n## Appearances[edit]\n\n\n### *Jujutsu Kaisen 0*[edit]\n\n\nMaki Zen'in debuts in *Jujutsu Kaisen 0* as a young student from Jujutsu High mentored by Satoru Gojo who brings a nervous teenager, Yuta Okkotsu, in order to train him and stop the curse of the undead girl Rika who is attacking everybody chasing Yuta. Early Maki mocks Yuta's weakness for being too passive, believing him to be the often subject of bullying. Although Yuta is unable to fight, he is assigned to work with Maki in exorcising a curse. When Maki is wounded, she asks Yuta what is his real desire to which he responds is that he only wants to enjoy a good life rather than remain alone. Maki encourages him to fight for such rights which allows her partner to control Rika for a brief period of time to escape with her.\nIn the next three months, Maki has become Yuta's mentor in swordplay so that he can also fight alone much to her comrade's surprise. When one of Satoru Gojo's friends, Suguru Geto, appears in Jujutsu High, it is revealed that Maki is a rejected member from the Zen'in clan and is mocked which angers Yuta. After the visit, Maki tells Yuta her hatred towards her clan to which Yuta agrees to fight alongside her, comforting her. Geto once again appears in Jujutsu High to take Rika's Curse, taking down all the students. Yuta takes control of Rika to save his mates, resulting in Geto escaping weakened.\n\n\n\n### *Jujutsu Kaisen*[edit]\n\n\nIn *Jujutsu Kaisen*, Maki appears one year older still as Sorcerer from Jujutsu High alongside Panda and Toge Inumaki as Yuta is working abroad. During an examination where the Kyoto students try to kill newcomer Yuji Itadori for possessing the vengeful spirit of Ryoma Sukuna, Maki joins Yuji's group and defeats her sister Mai who questions why she left their clan. During the Shibuya incident, Maki suffers several major wounds and loses an eye. After the incident, Maki still continues to fight alongside Yuta and the other Jujutsu High students against Geto's predecessor Kenjaku. After Mai sacrifices her life for Maki, she is able to see curses without glasses. After killing their father, she slaughters all members of the Zen'in clan in retribution for the pain she and Mai were forced to undergo during their childhood.\n\n\nShe joins the Culling Games as a player, and due to her special circumstance, is able to leave and enter barriers. Noritoshi Kamo from Kyoto school soon joins her side in the colony, but they are set upon by the special grade cursed spirit created from Naoya Zen'in, who has arrived to avenge his own death at the hands of Maki and her mother. They engage in fierce battle, during which Maki is significantly injured. She is forced to retreat, in order to heal, as Noritoshi takes it upon himself to hold off Naoya until she can exorcise it, even if it costs his life. During her battle with Naoya's cursed spirit, she is fully awakened, becoming just like Toji Fushiguro.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nCritical response to Maki's character in the main series was positive during the Kyoto training arc between the Jujutsu students. When the character was about to show her skills for the first time, Anime News Network was tired of the several fights the arc had and hoped Maki would stand out in the narrative.[6] The eventual battle between the Zen'in sisters earned praise for both the animation and exploration from Maki's past. The Fandom Post called Maki \"the star of the show\" due to how she overshadows her enemies and keeps a cocky personality, surpassing Nobara's character.[7] Comic Book Resources claimed that Maki and Nobara \"crush\" society expectations also focusing on the handling of the sisters, leaving a bitterswit moment due to sadness the episode leaves as the family feuds from the Zen'in clan was not properly explained.[8] Anime News Network enjoyed both the fighting coreography as it was more enjoyable than Yuji's battle among others. The site also found how \"groundbreaking\" the scene where Maki defeats Momo was.[9] The eventual focus on Maki's actions in the series led Comic Book Resources to point out that the Zen'in clan did bad at disapproving Maki since she constantly surprises the audience and cast.[10] Manga News felt the conflicts between the Zen'in sisters was well executed in the manga.[11]\n\n\nThere was also commentary about Maki's role in *Jujutsu Kaisen 0*. According to Real, Maki is fundamental in starting Yuta's recovery from his trauma due to how she encourages him to earn the freedom he wants[12] Mary Sue agreed with a similar praised for developing alongside Yuta;[13] Real Sound particularly praised the bond the Jujutsu sorcerers have in general; in one volume, it is shown Maki trains Yuta and befriends in the process, which gives further depth to the main manga.[14] Anime UK News felt that Maki's role in *Jujutsu Kaisen 0* was better executed than in the main series based on her explored background.[15] Digital Trends also felt that Maki's characterization was outstanding as she does not feel repetitive when dealing with Yuta as she feels different from the television series.[16] Her action scenes were also noted be well executed by Hitc while calling her and the other students as comic relief in contrast to the more serious take on Yuta.[17] *The Mary Sue* enjoyed Maki, calling her \"an absolute QUEEN\" and felt her backstory also standing out despite being similar to the main series.[13] On the other hand, Otaquest lamented the demoted roles of the supporting characters in the finale when they are defeated by Geto.[18] Similarly, Siliconera lamented that Maki's screentime in the film was limited as he liked the character and wished the franchise focused more on her.[19]\n\n\nIn a Viz Media popularity poll conducted in March 2021, Maki was voted as the 11th most-popular character in the *Jujutsu Kaisen* franchise.[20] Mikako Komatsu's performance as Maki was also praised by One Sports, considering her one of the best in the cast.[21] Den of Geek regarded Maki as one of the best used female characters in *shonen manga* due to how she is portrayed as a skilled warrior rather than previous series where the female cast was used for a supportive role. The handling of her fights was also noted as she comes across as equally powerful as the protagonist Yuji Itadori despite having poor energy in comparison which heavily connects to her backstory which she takes seriously.[22] Polygon agreed claiming that while there are series like *Bleach*, *Soul Eater*, *Hunter x Hunter* among feature similar female characters, their roles are limited or have unnispired powered when compared with the ones of the male characters.[23] Comic Book Resources noted that Maki took a somber personality following the Shibuya arc while her body was so damaged in the process that it would surprise anime-only viewers.[24]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Akutami, Gege (2019). *Jujutsu Kaisen*.

From left to right: Maki Zen'in, Megumi Fushiguro, Nobara Kugisaki (first row), Dagon (bottom left), Yuji Itadori, Panda, Toge Inumaki (second row), Choso, Suguru Geto, Jogo, Mahito (third row) and Ryomen Sukuna (back)\nThe following article is a list of characters from the manga series *Jujutsu Kaisen* by Gege Akutami.\n\n\n\n\n## Concept and creation[edit]\n\n\nRegarding the process of character creation, the author Gege Akutami claimed that they must fall within the canons of *sh\u014dnen* manga in order to capture the attention of readers. Yuji is largely inspired by Akutami's older brother, who is the opposite of Akutami, according to the author's own words, as he had succeeded in sports and study.[1] Akutami said that the message of *Jujutsu Kaisen* is that nobody has the absolute truth, not the \"good guys\" nor the \"bad guys\", and if nobody is right, then nobody is wrong either, and that each character acts according to their own ethics. The Sensui arc of *YuYu Hakusho* inspired Akutami to create evil characters with the goal of eradicating humanity, for whom the readers, nevertheless, would feel a certain empathy.[1] The character of Nobara Kugisaki was written to be the strongest protagonist while Megumi Fushiguro did not stand out too much until the author decided to give him a line where he makes philosophy. Akutami, fearing that the manga would be cancelled, decided to expand the time during which Yuji is dead. The handling of Yoshino led to more regrets to the author about how his story arc was handled.[2]\n\n\nWith Sukuna and Mahito, Akutami wanted to avoid the typical \"deep down they are good\" idea, stating that they are intrinsically evil beings who like to make humans suffer, but Akutami said that it cannot be proved that they are wrong, adding that Mahito was like Thanos in *Avengers: Endgame*, as Akutami never felt hatred for him.[1] For some characters, like Panda and Toge Inumaki, Akutami first created their visual aspects, while the character of Satoru Gojo came from an idea, which represents the paroxysm of force. Sukuna was Akutami's first favorite character due to his design being influenced by everything that Akutami had read, but Kento Nanami was the first character properly created and developed by Akutami, making him the author's later favorite character.[1]\n\n\n\n## Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School[edit]\n\n\n### Students[edit]\n\n\n#### Yuji Itadori[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yuji Itadori\n\nVoiced by: Junya Enoki[3] (Japanese); Adam McArthur[4] (English)\nYuji Itadori (\u864e\u6756 \u60a0\u4ec1, *Itadori Y\u016bji*) is an athletic teenager who joins his school's Occult Club to avoid the track team. After finding and opening a box containing a cursed charm resembling a rotting finger, his school is attacked by phantom-like creatures called Curses. To protect his friends, he consumes the rotting finger and becomes possessed by a Curse known as Ryoumen Sukuna. Yuji later joins the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of Satoru Gojo, where he is placed under a death sentence, suspended until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers, after which the execution would be carried out to eliminate Sukuna at the same time. Yuji believes in leading everyone to a proper death and wants to save everyone. Yuji feels responsible for the hundreds of thousands of people Sukuna kills at Shibuya and seeks to stop Kenjaku at all costs.\n\n\n\n#### Megumi Fushiguro[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Megumi Fushiguro\n\nVoiced by: Yuma Uchida[3] (Japanese); Robbie Daymond[4] (English)\nMegumi Fushiguro (\u4f0f\u9ed2 \u6075, *Fushiguro Megumi*) is a sorcerer studying in the first year at the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of Gojo. He meets Yuji when trying to locate a high-grade cursed charm talisman at his high school. Megumi is the one that convinces Satoru to try to save Yuji from his execution after his possession by Sukuna. Megumi possesses the \"Ten Shadows Technique\" (\u5341\u7a2e\u5f71\u6cd5\u8853, *Tokusa no Kage B\u014djutsu*). He uses his curse power to create spirits (\u5f0f\u795e, *Shikigami*) out of his own shadows to exorcise Curses. He has been noted to have high potential as a sorcerer by several other powerful people, including Sukuna himself. He was originally going to be sold to the Zenin clan (one of the big three prestigious families of sorcerers), which was stopped by Gojo, and thus Megumi became a sorcerer himself. The head of the Zen'in clan, Naobito suffers grievous injuries fighting Dagon at Shibuya, and names Megumi as the next head of the Zen'in clan before dying. He and Yuji then compete in the Culling Games in order to save his sister Tsumiki. After the truth about his sister being possessed by Heian Era sorcerer Yorozu is revealed, Sukuna takes the opportunity and possesses Megumi, becoming his new vessel. After possessing Megumi, Sukuna is resolved to kill Yorozu, who is madly in love with him, in order to completely sink Megumi's consciousness into despair by turning him into his own sister's killer. Though Yorozu extends much of her force and uses her Domain Expansion on Sukuna, the latter summons Megumi's shikigami, including Mahoraga and succeeds in killing Yorozu, as well as Tsumiki. When the jujutsu sorcerers successfully release Gojo from the Prison Realm, Gojo challenges Sukuna to a duel on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n\n#### Nobara Kugisaki[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nobara Kugisaki\n\nVoiced by: Asami Seto[3] (Japanese); Anne Yatco[4] (English)\nNobara Kugisaki (\u91d8\u5d0e \u91ce\u8594\u8587, *Kugisaki Nobara*) is a sorcerer studying in the first year at the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of Gojo. Nobara transferred to the college so that she could move from the countryside without any expenses. She meets Yuji and Megumi during her first official mission as a sorcerer. Nobara possesses the \"Straw Doll Technique\" (\u82bb\u970a\u546a\u6cd5, *S\u016brei Juh\u014d*). She carries a toolkit consisting of a strawdoll, a weapon hammer and nails as her primary choice of combat. Nobara looks up to a person called Saori who lived in their village and wishes to meet her sometime again. During the chaos at Shibuya on October 31, she ends up severely disfigured by Mahito and her current status is unknown.\n\n\n\n#### Maki Zen'in[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Maki Zen'in\n\nVoiced by: Mikako Komatsu[5] (Japanese); Allegra Clark[6] (English)\nMaki Zen'in (\u79aa\u9662 \u771f\u5e0c, *Zen'in Maki*) is a second year student at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School. Along with Toge and Panda, she recruits Megumi and Nobara (and later Yuji) to participate in the Sister School Exchange Event with Kyoto Prefectural Jujutsu High School. Maki comes from a prestigious sorcerer clan and is poised to be the next heir as the head's eldest child, but due to her lack of Cursed Energy, she and her twin sister Mai were demoted to being the clan's servants. She later left the clan to attend Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School and become a Jujutsu Sorcerer. Having no Cursed Energy, Maki requires the use of glasses to see Curses and uses a variety of weapons as Cursed Tools. However, being born with a Heavenly Restriction (\u5929\u4e0e\u546a\u7e1b, *Ten'yo Jubaku*), she possesses superhuman physical prowess, which more than makes up for her lack of curse power. During the events at Shibuya, Jogo burns her entire body, and she only survives thanks to the Heavenly Pact. After the events at Shibuya, she lays waste to her clan, in order to gain access to their armory containing weapons useful in the fight against Kenjaku, during this ordeal she becomes even more powerful, which comes with her sister, Mai's sacrifice. She joins the Culling Games as a player, and due to her special circumstance, is able to leave and enter barriers. Noritoshi Kamo from Kyoto school soon joins her side in the colony, but they are set upon by the special grade cursed spirit created from Naoya Zen'in, who has arrived to avenge his own death at the hands of Maki and her mother. They engage in fierce battle, during which Maki is significantly injured. She is forced to retreat, in order to heal, as Noritoshi takes it upon himself to hold off Naoya until she can exorcise it, even if it costs his life. During her battle with Naoya's cursed spirit, she is fully awakened, becoming just like Toji Fushiguro.\n\n\n\n#### Toge Inumaki[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Koki Uchiyama[5] (Japanese); Xander Mobus[7] (English)\nToge Inumaki (\u72d7\u5dfb \u68d8, *Inumaki Toge*) is a second year student at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School who takes part in the Sister School Exchange Event alongside Maki and Panda. Inumaki possesses the Cursed Speech Technique \"Jugon\" (\u546a\u8a00). He keeps his mouth covered and speaks only in various ingredients of rice balls. This is due to his cursed power concentrated in his voice, creating various effects against Curses depending on how he speaks and uses his words. During the Shibuya Incident, he is accidentally caught in Sukuna's Domain Expansion and loses an arm.\n\n\n\n#### Panda[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Tomokazu Seki[5] (Japanese); Matthew David Rudd[8] (English)\nPanda (\u30d1\u30f3\u30c0) is a second year student at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School who takes part in the Sister School Exchange Event. Although having an appearance of a giant panda, he is actually a unique type of Cursed Corpse created by Masamichi Yaga, in which not only does Panda have sentience, but grows and matures as he ages. Also unique to him is having three \"cores\" (the 'heart' of a Cursed Corpse), which he can change back and forth to unlock various abilities. After grieving the death of his creator, Masamichi Yaga, Panda joins the Culling Games with Itadori and Fushiguro in the effort to stop it. Panda engages in a battle with Hajime Kashimo, a resurrected sorcerer from the Heian era, who manages to defeat all two of his cores. Only the interference of Kinji Hakari stops Kashimo from killing Panda.\n\n\n\n#### Yuta Okkotsu[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yuta Okkotsu\n\nVoiced by: Megumi Ogata[9] (Japanese); Kayleigh McKee[10] (English)\nYuta Okkotsu (\u4e59\u9aa8 \u6182\u592a, *Okkotsu Y\u016bta*) is the protagonist of *Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School* (volume 0), which serves as a prequel for the main series. Yuta was initially a cursed victim of Special-Grade, haunted by the spirit of his childhood friend, Rika Orimoto. Satoru Gojo took charge of Yuta's case and enrolled him at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School, where he befriended Maki Zen'in, Toge Inumaki and Panda. After training with Gojo and the other students, Yuta learns to control his cursed energy and becomes a skilled swordsman. Even after Rika's curse is lifted, Yuta maintains his Special-Grade ranking, so much so that he can beat Suguru Geto, and Gojo has stated that Yuta has the potential to overcome him. Yuta's great power comes from being a descendant of one of the three great sorcerer clans (which makes him a distant relative to Gojo) and is the reason he cursed Rika when he refused her death at a young age. Yuta is still a sophomore at the institute, studying abroad. He later comes back as the executioner of Itadori Yuji after Gojo had been sealed, though the two soon team up afterwards, in order to rid the world of Kenjaku. He enters the Sandai colony of the Culling Games in order to protect the civilians from sorcerers and gain information on Kenjaku. He successfully defeats multiple very powerful, reincarnated sorcerers, such as Ishigoori and Uro.\n\n\n\n#### Kinji Hakari[edit]\n\n\nKinji Hakari (\u79e4\u91d1\u6b21, *Hakari Kinji*) is a third-year student at Tokyo Jujutsu High who is currently suspended for clashing with authority. While away from the school, Kinji is running a fight club between sorcerers for money. He has been spoken by Gojo as potentially surpassing him along with Yuji and Yuta, and Yuta also states that Hakari is capable of being stronger than him when he is serious. Following Yuta's advice, Megumi and Yuji seek him out to gain his help against Kenjaku, and soon find him at his illegal fight club. Upon hearing that Gojo has been sealed and Yaga was executed, Kinji agrees to help defeat Kenjaku. He later shows up in the Tokyo No. 2 Colony of the Culling Games, in an attempt to recruit French sorcerer and manga artist, Charles Bernard to their battle against Kenjaku. His innate technique allows him to spontaneously create and manipulate Pachinko machine parts, such as sliding doors. By expanding this technique into a domain, Hakari places himself and others inside a Pachinko machine, the appearance of which reflects how close Hakari is to a jackpot. Additionally, his cursed energy is inherently harmful to the touch, making him a particularly dangerous fighter in close combat. Using this technique, he is able to beat the reincarnated sorcerer, Hajime Kashimo after he had gravely injured Panda, forcing him into an alliance.\n\n\n\n#### Kirara Hoshi[edit]\n\n\nKirara Hoshi (\u661f\u7dba\u7f85\u7f85, *Hoshi Kirara*) is a third-year student at Tokyo Jujutsu High who is currently suspended for clashing with authority. While away from the school, Kirara has partnered with Kinji while running his fight club. Their cursed technique is Interstellar Flight (Love Rendezvous), a complex technique whose motif is based on the Southern Cross constellation. They agree to Fushiguro and Itadori's request for help, after hearing about everything that transpired at Shibuya. Kirara is currently outside the barriers of the Culling Game serving as the provider of intel for the group. \n\n\n\n### Faculty and staff[edit]\n\n\n#### Satoru Gojo[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Satoru Gojo\n\nVoiced by: Y\u016bichi Nakamura,[11] Mariya Ise (young)[12] (Japanese); Kaiji Tang[4] (English)\nSatoru Gojo (\u4e94\u6761 \u609f, *Goj\u014d Satoru*) is a sorcerer working as a teacher at the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School. He uses his curse power to control the space around him in numerous ways. Even though his title of 'The Strongest' is self-proclaimed, most allies and enemies alike never actually dispute the title and consider him one of the most dangerous people alive. As a result, Satoru is widely respected by sorcerers and greatly influences the sorcery world. He convinces his superiors at the college to keep Yuji Itadori alive until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers. He teaches Yuji, Megumi Fushiguro, and Nobara Kugisaki. The Special Grade Cursed Spirits ambushed him at Shibuya, and Kenjaku managed to seal him away after he exorcised Hanami. Towards the end of the Culling Games, his students successfully release him from the Prison Realm and he immediately challenges Megumi, Sukuna's current host to a duel on Christmas Eve. After several exchanges, Gojo ends being killed by Sukuna and finds himself talking with Geto and his other late friends..\n\n\n\n#### Kiyotaka Ijichi[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Mitsuo Iwata[13] (Japanese); Chris Tergliafera[14] (English)\nKiyotaka Ijichi (\u4f0a\u5730\u77e5 \u6f54\u9ad8, *Ijichi Kiyotaka*) is the assistant principal of Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School. He can create curtains, a technique used to implement a barrier to separate an area from the outside. Nanami revealed that he was once training to be a sorcerer, but for unrevealed reasons, he chose to become a manager instead. He is injured during the events at Shibuya, but Shoko saves him.\n\n\n\n#### Shoko Ieiri[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Aya End\u014d[13] (Japanese); Ryan Bartley[15] (English)\nShoko Ieiri (\u5bb6\u5165 \u785d\u5b50, *Ieiri Shoko*) is a doctor at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School and former classmate of Satoru and Suguru Geto. She has proven to be quite a valuable resource, being one of the few people capable of healing others with the Reverse Healing Cursed Technique. Shoko is a rather serious and somber person, wants nothing more than to get her job done, and often has to stop or get in the middle of Satoru to make fun of others. She usually examines dead bodies in the school morgue and does not engage in combat, unlike the other sorcerers.\n\n\n\n#### Kento Nanami[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Kenjiro Tsuda[16] (Japanese); David Vincent[17] (English)\nKento Nanami (\u4e03\u6d77 \u5efa\u4eba, *Nanami Kento*) is a Grade 1 Jujutsu Sorcerer, an alumnus of Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School, and one of Yuji's mentors. His personality is a stark contrast to Satoru's, being stoic and serious, whereas the latter is more easygoing. His cursed power allows him to forcibly create weak spots on the target with his weapon, a blunt sword wrapped in cloth. He was killed in the Shibuya Incident by his rival, Mahito, after Jogo scorched his body.\n\n\n\n#### Akari Nitta[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Sora Tokui[18] (Japanese); Sarah Anne Williams[19] (English)\nAkari Nitta (\u65b0\u7530\u660e, *Nitta Akari*) is one of the managers working for Jujutsu High School. She was assigned to accompany the first years in their mission to defeat the Yasohachi Bridge curse.\n\n\n\n#### Atsuya Kusakabe[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Shin-ichiro Miki[20]\nAtsuya Kusakabe (\u65e5\u4e0b\u90e8\u7be4\u4e5f, *Kusakabe Atsuya*) is a faculty member of Tokyo Jujutsu School. He teaches the second-years at Tokyo Jujutsu School. Although he does not possess an innate technique, he reached the levels of a grade 1 sorcerer using only his katana and excellent swordsmanship. His special move is Batto Sword Drawing (\u629c\u5200). It is implied that he is the mentor of Kasumi Miwa as she has the same skillsets.\n\n\n\n#### Masamichi Yaga[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Takaya Kuroda[13] (Japanese); Keith Silverstein[21] (English)\nMasamichi Yaga (\u591c\u86fe \u6b63\u9053, *Yaga Masamichi*) is the Principal of Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School, the creator of Panda, and the teacher of Satoru, Suguru, and Shoko. His cursed technique, Cursed Corpse (\u546a\u9ab8, *Juga*), allows him to animate and control dolls. Yaga accepts Yuji in the institute only after being convinced that he knows exactly what he is getting into and supports Satoru in opposing the superiors who want Yuji dead. Most of his appearances involve him having to deal with their escapades. After the events that transpire at Shibuya on October 31, the higher-ups hold him responsible for the carnage, and he is sentenced to death, which Gakuganji carries out.\n\n\n\n## Kyoto Prefectural Jujutsu High School[edit]\n\n\n### Students[edit]\n\n\n#### Aoi Todo[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Subaru Kimura[13] (Japanese); Xander Mobus[22] (English)\nAoi Todo (\u6771\u5802 \u8475, *T\u014dd\u014d Aoi*) is a third-year Sorcerer of Kyoto Prefectural Jujutsu High School. He is quite solid in hand-to-hand combat, defeating five Grade 1 Cursed Spirits and 1 Special Grade during an attack in Kyoto. He can apply a flash coating of Cursed Energy to his body for defence. Todo also dislikes anything boring due to his mundane past as a result of his incredible strength. He usually asks his opponent what his type is in women. He believes Itadori Yuji to be his brother and that they went to the same middle school. He also taught Yuji how to control his cursed energy. He helps Itadori fight Mahito during the Shibuya Incident, though he loses an arm, which prevents him from ever using his technique, Boogie Woogie, again.\n\n\n\n#### Mai Zen'in[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Marina Inoue[13] (Japanese); Laura Post[23] (English)\nMai Zen'in (\u79aa\u9662 \u771f\u4f9d, *Zen'in Mai*) is a second-year Sorcerer of Kyoto Prefectural Jujutsu High School. She detests her twin sister Maki after the latter leaves her and their clan to study to become a Jujutsu Sorcerer. Compared to Maki, who possesses no Cursed Energy at all, Mai possesses a Cursed Technique, albeit possessing a low amount of Cursed Energy. An expert markswoman, she primarily uses a revolver infused with Cursed Energy to take out Curses or other Sorcerers. Her technique, which is kept as a secret for strategic purposes, is \"Construction\" (\u69cb\u7bc9\u8853\u5f0f, *K\u014dchiku Jutsushiki*), allows her to materialize objects out of Cursed Energy. The process exhausts her quickly. After Gojo is sealed at Shibuya, she is fatally wounded by her father and in her last moments used the most of her remaining Cursed Energy to create a replica of Toji Fushiguro's Split Soul Katana, to which she gave to Maki to destroy the Zen'in Clan. The sword also serves as the last connection between the two sisters.\n\n\n\n#### Kasumi Miwa[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Chinatsu Akasaki[13] (Japanese); Allegra Clark[24] (English)\nKasumi Miwa (\u4e09\u8f2a \u971e, *Miwa Kasumi*) is a second year Sorcerer of Kyoto Prefectural Jujutsu High School and Gakuganji's secretary. She is also a fan of Gojo. Coming from an impoverished family, she wishes to become a Jujutsu Sorcerer to provide financial relief to her siblings. She is proficient with a sword, and her Shadow-Style: Simple Domain technique allows her to instinctively strike at anything within 2.21 meters of her radius. She often calls herself \"useless Miwa\". During the Shibuya Incident, she learns of Muta's actions and subsequent demise at the hands of Mahito, and mourns him after realizing, that she had feelings for him as well. After the Shibuya Incident, she appears at one of the Culling Game colonies.\n\n\n\n#### Kokichi Muta / Mechamaru[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Yoshitsugu Matsuoka[25] (Japanese); Keith Silverstein[21] (English)\nKokichi Muta (\u4e0e \u5e78\u5409, *Muta K\u014dkichi*) is a second year Sorcerer of Kyoto Prefectural Jujutsu High School. Being born with a Heavenly Restriction (\u5929\u4e0e\u546a\u7e1b, *Ten'yo Jubaku*), Kokichi's body is fragile and weak, but he has immense amounts of cursed energy in exchange for it. His cursed technique, Puppet Manipulation (\u5080\u5121\u64cd\u8853, *Kairai S\u014djutsu*), allows him to manipulate robot-like Cursed Corpses all over the country. His daily life and sorcerer's missions are undertaken by an assortment of Cursed Corpses puppets he uses for combat and communication, each of them named Ultimate Mechamaru (\u7a76\u6975 \u30e1\u30ab\u4e38, *Arutimetto Mekamaru*). Secretly, he had a crush on his classmate, Kasumi Miwa. It was revealed that he was the mole working with the cursed spirits Gojo and Utahime suspected. He formed a Binding Vow with Mahito to heal him of his condition, but turned on him and Kenjaku, revealing that he only used the cursed spirit for his ability to heal him and soon proceeds to attack them. Though he managed to push Mahito far, he soon met his end at the cursed spirit's hands. He later redeemed himself posthumously by helping Itadori in the events of the Shibuya Incident.\n\n\n\n#### Momo Nishimiya[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Rie Kugimiya[25] (Japanese); Tara Sands[26] (English)\nMomo Nishimiya (\u897f\u5bae \u6843, *Nishimiya Momo*) is a third year Sorcerer of Kyoto Prefectural Jujutsu High. She is a Semi-Grade 2 sorcerer, her cursed technique is Tool Manipulation which allows her to telekinetically levitate her broom, similar to those used by witches. Her role is supportive rather than offensive, as she uses her power to scout areas and collects information. As a third-year student, she looks out for her juniors and is especially close friends with Mai Zenin. She becomes a player of the Culling Games and is located in Tokyo Colony No. 2.\n\n\n\n#### Noritoshi Kamo[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Satoshi Hino[25] (Japanese); Landon McDonald[27] (English)\nNoritoshi Kamo (\u52a0\u8302 \u61b2\u7d00, *Kamo Noritoshi*) is a third-year Semi-Grade 1 Sorcerer of Kyoto Prefectural Jujutsu High. Although he is an illegitimate child, he becomes the next heir of the Kamo clan as he inherits the Blood Manipulation Technique of his clan. His main weapon of choice is a bow, and his arrows are dipped in his blood to control their direction.

According to legend, he was a four-armed, two-faced demon god resembling a human amid Jujutsu's golden age, the Heian period, though in reality was an actual human (though mutated) sorcerer. Enemy sorcerers of his time could not kill him, and eventually, Sukuna converted himself into a special-grade cursed object, a set of twenty indestructible fingers preserved in grave wax, to be able to traverse the ages and incarnate into suitable vessels should a finger be consumed. Currently, Sukuna is the \"guest\" of the body of Yuji Itadori, who agrees to let himself be killed to avoid further massacres. He has expressed notable interest in Megumi Fushiguro's abilities and plans to regain his power and body. Whenever Sukuna possesses Itadori, characteristic tattoos form on Itadori's body and two extra eyes open on Itadori's cheeks. Satoru Gojo claims he can beat a fully-restored Sukuna, but the latter has expressed a desire to kill him, and his power is such that all other Cursed Spirits are attempting to restore him. When Itadori is fed ten of Sukuna's fingers at once at Shibuya, Sukuna comes out and commits mass killing at Shibuya. During the Culling Games, Sukuna seizes his opportunity by ripping off Yuji's pinky finger and force feeding it to Megumi allowing Sukana to transfer himself to possess Fushiguro's body, becoming his new vessel.

In reality, Kenjaku is a mysterious ancient sorcerer who had taken over the bodies of many sorcerers in many eras, among them being the ancestor Noritoshi Kamo whose body he used to make the Death Paintings and currently has possessed Geto's dead body. Kenjaku worked along with Mahito's group to carry out his plans. However, he does not see them as allies and had ulterior motives using Geto's Cursed Manipulation Technique which he acquired in possession of his body. Kenjaku's 'true form' is a brain with a mouth where he transfers himself into different hosts of his choice and they can be recognized with the horizontal stitches around their head. During the Culling Games, he approaches Sasaki, Itadori's friend and classmate at his previous school and thanks her for taking care of \"his\" son. A while after the start of the Culling Games, he resumes his identity as Noritoshi Kamo and head of the clan, exiling the current Noritoshi.

He is sadistic, immature, and loves to play with human emotions, even when his life is in danger. He believes life has no value or meaning; therefore, everyone should do what they want. This mentality seems to stem from Mahito's ability to perceive and manipulate souls, which makes him see the soul (and, by extension, the heart) as nothing more than an object. His cursed power allows him to manipulate the soul of himself and others by changing the body's shape, thus enabling him to transfigure the bodies of his victims by turning them into disfigured creatures at his service.

Despite warnings that his entire group could not kill Satoru, Jogo attempted to defeat him in a single fight and was completely overwhelmed.

From left to right: Maki Zen'in, Megumi Fushiguro, Nobara Kugisaki (first row), Dagon (bottom left), Yuji Itadori, Panda, Toge Inumaki (second row), Choso, Suguru Geto, Jogo, Mahito (third row) and Ryomen Sukuna (back)\nThe following article is a list of characters from the manga series *Jujutsu Kaisen* by Gege Akutami.\n\n\n\n\n## Concept and creation[edit]\n\n\nRegarding the process of character creation, the author Gege Akutami claimed that they must fall within the canons of *sh\u014dnen* manga in order to capture the attention of readers. Yuji is largely inspired by Akutami's older brother, who is the opposite of Akutami, according to the author's own words, as he had succeeded in sports and study.[1] Akutami said that the message of *Jujutsu Kaisen* is that nobody has the absolute truth, not the \"good guys\" nor the \"bad guys\", and if nobody is right, then nobody is wrong either, and that each character acts according to their own ethics. The Sensui arc of *YuYu Hakusho* inspired Akutami to create evil characters with the goal of eradicating humanity, for whom the readers, nevertheless, would feel a certain empathy.[1] The character of Nobara Kugisaki was written to be the strongest protagonist while Megumi Fushiguro did not stand out too much until the author decided to give him a line where he makes philosophy. Akutami, fearing that the manga would be cancelled, decided to expand the time during which Yuji is dead. The handling of Yoshino led to more regrets to the author about how his story arc was handled.[2]\n\n\nWith Sukuna and Mahito, Akutami wanted to avoid the typical \"deep down they are good\" idea, stating that they are intrinsically evil beings who like to make humans suffer, but Akutami said that it cannot be proved that they are wrong, adding that Mahito was like Thanos in *Avengers: Endgame*, as Akutami never felt hatred for him.[1] For some characters, like Panda and Toge Inumaki, Akutami first created their visual aspects, while the character of Satoru Gojo came from an idea, which represents the paroxysm of force. Sukuna was Akutami's first favorite character due to his design being influenced by everything that Akutami had read, but Kento Nanami was the first character properly created and developed by Akutami, making him the author's later favorite character.[1]\n\n\n\n## Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School[edit]\n\n\n### Students[edit]\n\n\n#### Yuji Itadori[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yuji Itadori\n\nVoiced by: Junya Enoki[3] (Japanese); Adam McArthur[4] (English)\nYuji Itadori (\u864e\u6756 \u60a0\u4ec1, *Itadori Y\u016bji*) is an athletic teenager who joins his school's Occult Club to avoid the track team. After finding and opening a box containing a cursed charm resembling a rotting finger, his school is attacked by phantom-like creatures called Curses. To protect his friends, he consumes the rotting finger and becomes possessed by a Curse known as Ryoumen Sukuna. Yuji later joins the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of Satoru Gojo, where he is placed under a death sentence, suspended until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers, after which the execution would be carried out to eliminate Sukuna at the same time. Yuji believes in leading everyone to a proper death and wants to save everyone. Yuji feels responsible for the hundreds of thousands of people Sukuna kills at Shibuya and seeks to stop Kenjaku at all costs.\n\n\n\n#### Megumi Fushiguro[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Megumi Fushiguro\n\nVoiced by: Yuma Uchida[3] (Japanese); Robbie Daymond[4] (English)\nMegumi Fushiguro (\u4f0f\u9ed2 \u6075, *Fushiguro Megumi*) is a sorcerer studying in the first year at the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of Gojo. He meets Yuji when trying to locate a high-grade cursed charm talisman at his high school. Megumi is the one that convinces Satoru to try to save Yuji from his execution after his possession by Sukuna. Megumi possesses the \"Ten Shadows Technique\" (\u5341\u7a2e\u5f71\u6cd5\u8853, *Tokusa no Kage B\u014djutsu*). He uses his curse power to create spirits (\u5f0f\u795e, *Shikigami*) out of his own shadows to exorcise Curses. He has been noted to have high potential as a sorcerer by several other powerful people, including Sukuna himself. He was originally going to be sold to the Zenin clan (one of the big three prestigious families of sorcerers), which was stopped by Gojo, and thus Megumi became a sorcerer himself. The head of the Zen'in clan, Naobito suffers grievous injuries fighting Dagon at Shibuya, and names Megumi as the next head of the Zen'in clan before dying. He and Yuji then compete in the Culling Games in order to save his sister Tsumiki. After the truth about his sister being possessed by Heian Era sorcerer Yorozu is revealed, Sukuna takes the opportunity and possesses Megumi, becoming his new vessel. After possessing Megumi, Sukuna is resolved to kill Yorozu, who is madly in love with him, in order to completely sink Megumi's consciousness into despair by turning him into his own sister's killer. Though Yorozu extends much of her force and uses her Domain Expansion on Sukuna, the latter summons Megumi's shikigami, including Mahoraga and succeeds in killing Yorozu, as well as Tsumiki. When the jujutsu sorcerers successfully release Gojo from the Prison Realm, Gojo challenges Sukuna to a duel on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n\n#### Nobara Kugisaki[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nobara Kugisaki\n\nVoiced by: Asami Seto[3] (Japanese); Anne Yatco[4] (English)\nNobara Kugisaki (\u91d8\u5d0e \u91ce\u8594\u8587, *Kugisaki Nobara*) is a sorcerer studying in the first year at the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of Gojo. Nobara transferred to the college so that she could move from the countryside without any expenses. She meets Yuji and Megumi during her first official mission as a sorcerer.

She carries a toolkit consisting of a strawdoll, a weapon hammer and nails as her primary choice of combat.

Along with Toge and Panda, she recruits Megumi and Nobara (and later Yuji) to participate in the Sister School Exchange Event with Kyoto Prefectural Jujutsu High School. Maki comes from a prestigious sorcerer clan and is poised to be the next heir as the head's eldest child, but due to her lack of Cursed Energy, she and her twin sister Mai were demoted to being the clan's servants. She later left the clan to attend Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School and become a Jujutsu Sorcerer. Having no Cursed Energy, Maki requires the use of glasses to see Curses and uses a variety of weapons as Cursed Tools. However, being born with a Heavenly Restriction (\u5929\u4e0e\u546a\u7e1b, *Ten'yo Jubaku*), she possesses superhuman physical prowess, which more than makes up for her lack of curse power. During the events at Shibuya, Jogo burns her entire body, and she only survives thanks to the Heavenly Pact. After the events at Shibuya, she lays waste to her clan, in order to gain access to their armory containing weapons useful in the fight against Kenjaku, during this ordeal she becomes even more powerful, which comes with her sister, Mai's sacrifice. She joins the Culling Games as a player, and due to her special circumstance, is able to leave and enter barriers. Noritoshi Kamo from Kyoto school soon joins her side in the colony, but they are set upon by the special grade cursed spirit created from Naoya Zen'in, who has arrived to avenge his own death at the hands of Maki and her mother. They engage in fierce battle, during which Maki is significantly injured. She is forced to retreat, in order to heal, as Noritoshi takes it upon himself to hold off Naoya until she can exorcise it, even if it costs his life. During her battle with Naoya's cursed spirit, she is fully awakened, becoming just like Toji Fushiguro.\n\n\n\n#### Toge Inumaki[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Koki Uchiyama[5] (Japanese); Xander Mobus[7] (English)\nToge Inumaki (\u72d7\u5dfb \u68d8, *Inumaki Toge*) is a second year student at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School who takes part in the Sister School Exchange Event alongside Maki and Panda. Inumaki possesses the Cursed Speech Technique \"Jugon\" (\u546a\u8a00). He keeps his mouth covered and speaks only in various ingredients of rice balls. This is due to his cursed power concentrated in his voice, creating various effects against Curses depending on how he speaks and uses his words. During the Shibuya Incident, he is accidentally caught in Sukuna's Domain Expansion and loses an arm.\n\n\n\n#### Panda[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Tomokazu Seki[5] (Japanese); Matthew David Rudd[8] (English)\nPanda (\u30d1\u30f3\u30c0) is a second year student at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School who takes part in the Sister School Exchange Event. Although having an appearance of a giant panda, he is actually a unique type of Cursed Corpse created by Masamichi Yaga, in which not only does Panda have sentience, but grows and matures as he ages. Also unique to him is having three \"cores\" (the 'heart' of a Cursed Corpse), which he can change back and forth to unlock various abilities. After grieving the death of his creator, Masamichi Yaga, Panda joins the Culling Games with Itadori and Fushiguro in the effort to stop it. Panda engages in a battle with Hajime Kashimo, a resurrected sorcerer from the Heian era, who manages to defeat all two of his cores.

Yuta was initially a cursed victim of Special-Grade, haunted by the spirit of his childhood friend, Rika Orimoto. Satoru Gojo took charge of Yuta's case and enrolled him at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School, where he befriended Maki Zen'in, Toge Inumaki and Panda. After training with Gojo and the other students, Yuta learns to control his cursed energy and becomes a skilled swordsman. Even after Rika's curse is lifted, Yuta maintains his Special-Grade ranking, so much so that he can beat Suguru Geto, and Gojo has stated that Yuta has the potential to overcome him. Yuta's great power comes from being a descendant of one of the three great sorcerer clans (which makes him a distant relative to Gojo) and is the reason he cursed Rika when he refused her death at a young age. Yuta is still a sophomore at the institute, studying abroad. He later comes back as the executioner of Itadori Yuji after Gojo had been sealed, though the two soon team up afterwards, in order to rid the world of Kenjaku. He enters the Sandai colony of the Culling Games in order to protect the civilians from sorcerers and gain information on Kenjaku. He successfully defeats multiple very powerful, reincarnated sorcerers, such as Ishigoori and Uro.\n\n\n\n#### Kinji Hakari[edit]\n\n\nKinji Hakari (\u79e4\u91d1\u6b21, *Hakari Kinji*) is a third-year student at Tokyo Jujutsu High who is currently suspended for clashing with authority. While away from the school, Kinji is running a fight club between sorcerers for money. He has been spoken by Gojo as potentially surpassing him along with Yuji and Yuta, and Yuta also states that Hakari is capable of being stronger than him when he is serious. Following Yuta's advice, Megumi and Yuji seek him out to gain his help against Kenjaku, and soon find him at his illegal fight club. Upon hearing that Gojo has been sealed and Yaga was executed, Kinji agrees to help defeat Kenjaku. He later shows up in the Tokyo No. 2 Colony of the Culling Games, in an attempt to recruit French sorcerer and manga artist, Charles Bernard to their battle against Kenjaku. His innate technique allows him to spontaneously create and manipulate Pachinko machine parts, such as sliding doors. By expanding this technique into a domain, Hakari places himself and others inside a Pachinko machine, the appearance of which reflects how close Hakari is to a jackpot. Additionally, his cursed energy is inherently harmful to the touch, making him a particularly dangerous fighter in close combat. Using this technique, he is able to beat the reincarnated sorcerer, Hajime Kashimo after he had gravely injured Panda, forcing him into an alliance.\n\n\n\n#### Kirara Hoshi[edit]\n\n\nKirara Hoshi (\u661f\u7dba\u7f85\u7f85, *Hoshi Kirara*) is a third-year student at Tokyo Jujutsu High who is currently suspended for clashing with authority. While away from the school, Kirara has partnered with Kinji while running his fight club. Their cursed technique is Interstellar Flight (Love Rendezvous), a complex technique whose motif is based on the Southern Cross constellation. They agree to Fushiguro and Itadori's request for help, after hearing about everything that transpired at Shibuya. Kirara is currently outside the barriers of the Culling Game serving as the provider of intel for the group. \n\n\n\n### Faculty and staff[edit]\n\n\n#### Satoru Gojo[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Satoru Gojo\n\nVoiced by: Y\u016bichi Nakamura,[11] Mariya Ise (young)[12] (Japanese); Kaiji Tang[4] (English)\nSatoru Gojo (\u4e94\u6761 \u609f, *Goj\u014d Satoru*) is a sorcerer working as a teacher at the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School. He uses his curse power to control the space around him in numerous ways. Even though his title of 'The Strongest' is self-proclaimed, most allies and enemies alike never actually dispute the title and consider him one of the most dangerous people alive. As a result, Satoru is widely respected by sorcerers and greatly influences the sorcery world. He convinces his superiors at the college to keep Yuji Itadori alive until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers. He teaches Yuji, Megumi Fushiguro, and Nobara Kugisaki. The Special Grade Cursed Spirits ambushed him at Shibuya, and Kenjaku managed to seal him away after he exorcised Hanami. Towards the end of the Culling Games, his students successfully release him from the Prison Realm and he immediately challenges Megumi, Sukuna's current host to a duel on Christmas Eve.

She has proven to be quite a valuable resource, being one of the few people capable of healing others with the Reverse Healing Cursed Technique. Shoko is a rather serious and somber person, wants nothing more than to get her job done, and often has to stop or get in the middle of Satoru to make fun of others. She usually examines dead bodies in the school morgue and does not engage in combat, unlike the other sorcerers.\n\n\n\n#### Kento Nanami[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Kenjiro Tsuda[16] (Japanese); David Vincent[17] (English)\nKento Nanami (\u4e03\u6d77 \u5efa\u4eba, *Nanami Kento*) is a Grade 1 Jujutsu Sorcerer, an alumnus of Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School, and one of Yuji's mentors.

Todo also dislikes anything boring due to his mundane past as a result of his incredible strength. He usually asks his opponent what his type is in women. He believes Itadori Yuji to be his brother and that they went to the same middle school. He also taught Yuji how to control his cursed energy. He helps Itadori fight Mahito during the Shibuya Incident, though he loses an arm, which prevents him from ever using his technique, Boogie Woogie, again.\n\n\n\n#### Mai Zen'in[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Marina Inoue[13] (Japanese); Laura Post[23] (English)\nMai Zen'in (\u79aa\u9662 \u771f\u4f9d, *Zen'in Mai*) is a second-year Sorcerer of Kyoto Prefectural Jujutsu High School.

According to legend, he was a four-armed, two-faced demon god resembling a human amid Jujutsu's golden age, the Heian period, though in reality was an actual human (though mutated) sorcerer. Enemy sorcerers of his time could not kill him, and eventually, Sukuna converted himself into a special-grade cursed object, a set of twenty indestructible fingers preserved in grave wax, to be able to traverse the ages and incarnate into suitable vessels should a finger be consumed. Currently, Sukuna is the \"guest\" of the body of Yuji Itadori, who agrees to let himself be killed to avoid further massacres. He has expressed notable interest in Megumi Fushiguro's abilities and plans to regain his power and body. Whenever Sukuna possesses Itadori, characteristic tattoos form on Itadori's body and two extra eyes open on Itadori's cheeks. Satoru Gojo claims he can beat a fully-restored Sukuna, but the latter has expressed a desire to kill him, and his power is such that all other Cursed Spirits are attempting to restore him. When Itadori is fed ten of Sukuna's fingers at once at Shibuya, Sukuna comes out and commits mass killing at Shibuya. During the Culling Games, Sukuna seizes his opportunity by ripping off Yuji's pinky finger and force feeding it to Megumi allowing Sukana to transfer himself to possess Fushiguro's body, becoming his new vessel.

In reality, Kenjaku is a mysterious ancient sorcerer who had taken over the bodies of many sorcerers in many eras, among them being the ancestor Noritoshi Kamo whose body he used to make the Death Paintings and currently has possessed Geto's dead body. Kenjaku worked along with Mahito's group to carry out his plans. However, he does not see them as allies and had ulterior motives using Geto's Cursed Manipulation Technique which he acquired in possession of his body. Kenjaku's 'true form' is a brain with a mouth where he transfers himself into different hosts of his choice and they can be recognized with the horizontal stitches around their head. During the Culling Games, he approaches Sasaki, Itadori's friend and classmate at his previous school and thanks her for taking care of \"his\" son. A while after the start of the Culling Games, he resumes his identity as Noritoshi Kamo and head of the clan, exiling the current Noritoshi.

He is sadistic, immature, and loves to play with human emotions, even when his life is in danger. He believes life has no value or meaning; therefore, everyone should do what they want. This mentality seems to stem from Mahito's ability to perceive and manipulate souls, which makes him see the soul (and, by extension, the heart) as nothing more than an object. His cursed power allows him to manipulate the soul of himself and others by changing the body's shape, thus enabling him to transfigure the bodies of his victims by turning them into disfigured creatures at his service.

Despite warnings that his entire group could not kill Satoru, Jogo attempted to defeat him in a single fight and was completely overwhelmed. During the Shibuya Incident, he tries to convince the rampaging Sukuna to join their ranks.

These course of events were orchestrated by Kenjaku and have led to the Culling Game.\n\n\n\n### Shiu Kong / Kong Si-woo[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Hiroki Yasumoto[57] (Japanese); Mick Lauer[58] (English)\nShiu Kong (\u5b54\u6642\u96e8, *Kon Shiu*)/Kong Si-woo (\uacf5 \uc2dc\uc6b0, *Gong Si-u*) is a minor character from Gojo's Past Arc.

His lack of Cursed Energy allows him to sneak up on and kill Jujutsu Sorcerers. He defeated Gojo and Geto on their first encounter, bringing Gojo to the brink of death. He is callous and has little regard for his own family, selling Megumi to the Zenin Clan for money and even forgetting his name.\n\n\n\n### Misato Kuroi[edit]\n\n\nVoiced by: Risa Shimizu[57] (Japanese); Jeannie Tirado[59] (English)\nMisato Kuroi (\u9ed2\u4e95\u7f8e\u91cc, *Kuroi Misato*) is a minor character from Gojo's Past Arc.

In the present day, she has lost weight and grown taller. When she saw Yuji was also in Tokyo, she asked Nobara about him, believing she has a chance with Yuji now with her new appearance.

He is currently one of the top player of the Culling Game. After a tiresome fight with Yuji, Higuruma agrees to help them by adding a rule to the game, inspired by the boy. His Curse Technique allows him to summon a shikigami called \"Judgeman\", whose effects seem to take place only within Hiromi's domain, where he is given all the information about who is inside and acts as a judge to determine the sentence of the target. He has also shown the ability to impose rules on the target, such as taking away his cursed energy from him. For close combat, he summons a hammer that can change in size and be controlled remotely.\n\n\n\n### Rin Amai[edit]\n\n\nRin Amai (\u7518\u4e95 \u51db, *Amai Rin*) is a modern sorcerer who recognized Yuji from their hometown, Sendai City.

Using strategy, he survived the early stages of the game and deduced that Kenjaku will reveal something once only the strongest players are left. He uses Remi to attract potential allies or victims to collect points. This led Megumi to a trap in Shinjuku, where Reggie and his allies ambushed the student. He gets into a gruesome fight with Fushiguro, eventually losing. Afterwards, he provides some information about the game and Kenjaku's plans.\n\n\n\n### Chizuru Hari[edit]\n\n\nChizuru Hari (\u91dd \u5343\u91e3, *Hari Chizuru*) is a sorcerer who is in an alliance with Reggie Star in the Culling Game.

He reincarnated in the modern era as a player of the Culling Games in Sendai Colony along with Ryuu Ishigouri, Takako Uro and the cursed spirit, Kurourushi, whom he was competing with for the strongest players within the colony. He was later defeated by Yuta Okkotsu and thus ignited a huge battle among the remaining powerful players. \n\n\n\n### Kurourushi[edit]\n\n\nKurourushi (\u9ed2\u6c90\u6b7b) is a special grade Cursed Spirit born from people's negative emotions of cockroaches. He was released from Cursed Spirit Manipulation of Suguru Geto's technique under the possession of Kenjaku to become a player of the Culling Game.

Hagane is a lethal fighter with a sword and is able to fight the Vengeful Spirit of Naoya, an opponent Maki was struggling with despite wielding no Cursed Energy.
