All series in this list have at least 20 million copies in circulation. This list is limited to Japanese manga and does not include manhwa, manhua or original English-language manga. The series are listed according to the highest sales or circulation (copies in print) estimate of their collected *tankōbon* volumes as reported in reliable sources unless indicated otherwise. They are arranged in alphabetical order.\n\n\nNote that most manga series are first serialized and sold as part of manga magazines, before being sold separately as individual collected *tankōbon* volumes. This list only includes the number of collected *tankōbon* volumes sold. For sales of manga magazines which includes these series, see *List of Japanese manga magazines by circulation*. The best-selling manga magazine (and best-selling comic magazine) is *Weekly Shōnen Jump*, with over 7.5 billion copies sold.[1] Estimated circulation figures for individual manga series published in manga magazines are given in footnotes.[a]\n\n\n\n\n## Collected tankōbon volumes[edit]\n\n\n**Legend**\n\n\n\n* *Background shading indicates manga series currently running.*\n* † *Dagger glyph indicates the number of tankōbon copies a series has in circulation/print, rather than actually sold.*\n* ‡ *Double-dagger glyph indicates that the number includes digital sales.*\n\n\n### At least 100 million copies and above[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Manga series | Author(s) | Publisher | Demographic | No. of collectedvolumes | Serialized | Approximate sales\n | Average salesper volume[b] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *One Piece* | Eiichiro Oda | Shueisha | *Shōnen* | 106 | 1997–present | 516.6 million†‡[2][d] | 4.82 million\n |\n| *Golgo 13* | Takao Saito, Saito Production | Shogakukan | *Seinen* | 208 | 1968–present | 300 million†[3] | 1.45 million\n |\n| *Case Closed / Detective Conan* | Gosho Aoyama | Shogakukan | *Shōnen* | 102 | 1994–present | 270 million†[4] | 2.65 million\n |\n| *Dragon Ball* | Akira Toriyama | Shueisha | *Shōnen* | 42 | 1984–1995 | 260 million[5][e][f] | 6.19 million\n |\n| *Doraemon* | Fujiko F.

All series in this list have at least 20 million copies in circulation. This list is limited to Japanese manga and does not include manhwa, manhua or original English-language manga. The series are listed according to the highest sales or circulation (copies in print) estimate of their collected *tankōbon* volumes as reported in reliable sources unless indicated otherwise. They are arranged in alphabetical order.\n\n\nNote that most manga series are first serialized and sold as part of manga magazines, before being sold separately as individual collected *tankōbon* volumes. This list only includes the number of collected *tankōbon* volumes sold. For sales of manga magazines which includes these series, see *List of Japanese manga magazines by circulation*. The best-selling manga magazine (and best-selling comic magazine) is *Weekly Shōnen Jump*, with over 7.5 billion copies sold.[1] Estimated circulation figures for individual manga series published in manga magazines are given in footnotes.[a]\n\n\n\n\n## Collected tankōbon volumes[edit]\n\n\n**Legend**\n\n\n\n* *Background shading indicates manga series currently running.*\n* † *Dagger glyph indicates the number of tankōbon copies a series has in circulation/print, rather than actually sold.*\n* ‡ *Double-dagger glyph indicates that the number includes digital sales.*\n\n\n### At least 100 million copies and above[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Manga series | Author(s) | Publisher | Demographic | No. of collectedvolumes | Serialized | Approximate sales\n | Average salesper volume[b] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *One Piece* | Eiichiro Oda | Shueisha | *Shōnen* | 106 | 1997–present | 516.6 million†‡[2][d] | 4.82 million\n |\n| *Golgo 13* | Takao Saito, Saito Production | Shogakukan | *Seinen* | 208 | 1968–present | 300 million†[3] | 1.45 million\n |\n| *Case Closed / Detective Conan* | Gosho Aoyama | Shogakukan | *Shōnen* | 102 | 1994–present | 270 million†[4] | 2.65 million\n |\n| *Dragon Ball* | Akira Toriyama | Shueisha | *Shōnen* | 42 | 1984–1995 | 260 million[5][e][f] | 6.19 million\n |\n| *Doraemon* | Fujiko F.

It has been serialized in Shueisha's *shōnen* manga magazine *Weekly Shōnen Jump* since July 1997, with its individual chapters compiled into 107 *tankōbon* volumes as of November 2023[update]. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, where he explores the Grand Line in search of the mythical treasure known as the \"One Piece\" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.\n\n\nThe manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film by Production I.G, and an anime series by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated feature films, one original video animation, and thirteen television specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and numerous video games. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an English-language release in North America in 2004 before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007.\n\n\n*One Piece* has received praise for its storytelling, world-building, art, characterization, and humor. It has received many awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time. By August 2022, it had over 516.6 million copies in circulation in 61 countries and regions worldwide, making it the best-selling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic series printed in book volume. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015 and 2022, *One Piece* set the *Guinness World Record* for \"the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\". It was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the only that had achieved more than 1 million copies sold in all of its over 100 published *tankōbon* volumes. *One Piece* is the only manga whose volumes have ranked first every year in Oricon's weekly comic chart existence since 2008.\n\n\n\n\n## Synopsis[edit]\n\n\n### Setting[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *One Piece* characters\n\n![](image)The globe of the *One Piece* world\nThe world of *One Piece* is populated by humans and other races such as dwarves (more akin to faeries in size), giants, merfolk, fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked people known as the Snakeneck Tribe, and animal people (known as \"Minks\"). The world is governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World Government, consisting of dozens of member countries. The Navy is the sea military branch of the World Government that protects the known seas from pirates and other criminals. There is also Cipher Pol which is a group of agencies within the World Government that are their secret police. While pirates are major opponents against the Government, the ones who really challenge their rule are the Revolutionary Army who seeks to overthrow them. The central tension of the series pits the World Government and their forces against pirates. The series regularly emphasizes moral ambiguity over the label \"pirate\", which includes cruel villains, but also any individuals that do not submit to the World Government's authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—rule. The *One Piece* world also has supernormal characteristics like Devil Fruits,[Jp 1] which are mysterious fruits that grant whoever eats them transformative powers. Another supernatural power is Haki,[Jp 2] which grants its users enhanced willpower, observation, and fighting abilities, and it is one of the only effective methods of inflicting bodily harm on certain Devil Fruit users.\n\n\nThe world itself consists of two vast oceans divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line.[Jp 3] Within the oceans is a second global phenomenon known as the Grand Line,[Jp 4] which is a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line and is bounded by the Calm Belt,[Jp 5] strips of calm ocean infested with huge ship-eating monsters known as Sea Kings.[Jp 6] These geographical barriers divide the world into four seas: North Blue,[Jp 7] East Blue,[Jp 8] West Blue,[Jp 9] and South Blue.[Jp 10] Passage between the four seas, and the Grand Line, is therefore difficult. Unique and mystical features enable transport between the seas, such as the use of Sea Prism Stone[Jp 11] employed by government ships to mask their presence as they traverse the Calm Belt, or the Reverse Mountain[Jp 12] where water from the four seas flows uphill before merging into a rapidly flowing and dangerous canal that enters the Grand Line. The Grand Line itself is split into two separate halves with the Red Line between being Paradise[Jp 13] and the New World.[Jp 14]\n\n\n\n### Premise[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of *One Piece* chapters\n\nThe series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy—a young man made of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit—who sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger's ultimate treasure known as the \"One Piece\", and take over his prior title. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates,[Jp 15] Luffy rescues and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the titular treasure. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a money-obsessed thief and navigator; Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, an amorous but chivalrous cook. They acquire a ship, the *Going Merry*[Jp 16]—later replaced by the *Thousand Sunny*[Jp 17]—and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphized reindeer doctor; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former Baroque Works assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeleton musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a whale shark-type fish-man and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea who becomes their helmsman. Together, they encounter other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents, different types of scientists, soldiers of the morally-ambiguous World Government, and various other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Concept and creation[edit]\n\n\nEiichiro Oda's interest in pirates began in his childhood, watching the animated series *Vicky the Viking*, which inspired him to want to draw a manga series about pirates.[2] The reading of pirate biographies influenced Oda to incorporate the characteristics of real-life pirates into many of the characters in *One Piece*; for example, the character Marshall D. Teach is based on and named after the historical pirate Edward \"Blackbeard\" Teach.[3] Apart from the history of piracy, Oda's biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series *Dragon Ball*, which is one of his favorite manga.[4] He was also inspired by *The Wizard of Oz*, claiming not to endure stories where the reward of adventure is the adventure itself, opting for a story where travel is important, but even more important is the goal.[5]\n\n\nWhile working as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki, Oda began writing *One Piece* in 1996.[6] It started as two one-shot stories entitled *Romance Dawn*[6]—which would later be used as the title for *One Piece*'s first chapter and volume. They both featured the character of Luffy, and included elements that would appear later in the main series. The first of these short stories was published in August 1996 in *Akamaru Jump* and later in *One Piece Red*. The second was published in the 41st issue of *Weekly Shōnen Jump* in 1996, and reprinted in 1998 in Oda's short story collection, *Wanted!*.[7] In an interview with TBS, Takanori Asada, the original editor of *One Piece*, revealed that the manga was rejected by *Weekly Shōnen Jump* three times before Shueisha agreed to publish the series.[8]\n\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nWhen creating the Devil Fruit, Oda thinks of something that would fulfill a human desire; he added that he does not see why he would draw a Devil Fruit unless the fruit's appearance would entice one to eat it.[9] The names of many special attacks, as well as other concepts in the manga, consist of a form of punning in which phrases written in *kanji* are paired with an idiosyncratic reading. The names of some characters' techniques are often mixed with other languages, and the names of several of Zoro's sword techniques are designed as jokes; they look fearsome when read by sight but sound like kinds of food when read aloud. For example, Zoro's signature move is *Onigiri*, which is written as *demon cut* but is pronounced the same as *rice ball* in Japanese. Eisaku Inoue, the animation director, has said that the creators did not use these *kanji* readings in the anime since they \"might have cut down the laughs by about half\".[10] Nevertheless, Konosuke Uda, the director, said that he believes that the creators \"made the anime pretty close to the manga\".[10]\n\n\nOda was \"sensitive\" about how his work would be translated.[11] In many instances, the English version of the *One Piece* manga uses one onomatopoeia for multiple onomatopoeia used in the Japanese version. For instance, \"*saaa*\" (the sound of light rain, close to a mist) and \"*zaaa*\" (the sound of pouring rain) are both translated as \"fshhhhhhh\".[12] Unlike other manga artists, Oda draws everything that moves himself to create a consistent look while leaving his staff to draw the backgrounds based on sketches he has drawn.[13] This workload forces him to keep tight production rates, starting from five in the morning until two in the morning the next day, with short breaks only for meals. Oda's work program includes the first three days of the week dedicated to the writing of the storyboard and the remaining time for the definitive inking of the boards and for the possible coloring.[14] When a reader asked who Nami was in love with, Oda replied that there would hardly be any love affairs within Luffy's crew. The author also explained he deliberately avoids including them in *One Piece* since the series is a shōnen manga and the boys who read it are not interested in love stories.[15]\n\n\n\n### Conclusion[edit]\n\n\nOda revealed that he originally planned *One Piece* to last five years, and that he had already planned the ending. However, he found it would take longer than he had expected as Oda realized that he liked the story too much to end it in that period of time.[16] In 2016, nineteen years after the start of serialization, the author said that the manga has reached 65% of the story he intends to tell.[17] In July 2018, on the occasion of the twenty-first anniversary of *One Piece*, Oda said that the manga has reached 80% of the plot,[18] while in January 2019, he said that *One Piece* is on its way to the conclusion, but that it could exceed the 100th volume.[19] In August 2019, Oda said that, according to his predictions, the manga will end between 2024 and 2025.[20] However, Oda stated that the ending would be what he had decided in the beginning; he is committed to seeing it through.[21] In a television special aired in Japan, Oda said he would be willing to change the ending if the fans were to be able to predict it.[5] In August 2020, Shueisha announced in the year's 35th issue of *Weekly Shōnen Jump* that *One Piece* was \"headed toward the upcoming final saga.\"[22] On January 4, 2021, *One Piece* reached its thousandth chapter.[23][24][25] In June 2022, Oda announced that the manga would enter a one-month break to prepare for its 25th anniversary and its final saga, set to begin with the release of chapter 1054.[26]\n\n\n\n## Publication[edit]\n\n\n### Main series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *One Piece* manga volumes\n\nWritten and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda, *One Piece* has been serialized by Shueisha in the *shōnen* manga anthology *Weekly Shōnen Jump* since July 22, 1997.[27][28] Shueisha has collected its chapters into individual *tankōbon* volumes. The first volume was released on December 24, 1997.[29] By November 2, 2023, a total of 107 volumes have been released.[30]\n\n\nThe first English translation of *One Piece* was released by Viz Media in November 2002, who published its chapters in the manga anthology *Shonen Jump*, and later collected in volumes since June 30, 2003.[31][32][33] In 2009, Viz announced the release of five volumes per month during the first half of 2010 to catch up with the serialization in Japan.[34] Following the discontinuation of the print *Shonen Jump*, Viz began releasing *One Piece* chapterwise in its digital successor *Weekly Shonen Jump* on January 30, 2012.[35] Following the digital *Weekly Shonen Jump'*s cancelation in December 2018, Viz Media started simultaneously publishing *One Piece* through its *Shonen Jump* service, and by Shueisha through *Manga Plus*, in January 2019.[36][37]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the volumes were published by Gollancz Manga, starting in March 2006,[38] until Viz Media took it over after the fourteenth volume.[39][40] In Australia and New Zealand, the English volumes have been distributed by Madman Entertainment since November 10, 2008.[41] In Poland, Japonica Polonica Fantastica is publishing the manga,[42] Glénat in France,[43] Panini Comics in Mexico,[44] LARP Editores and later by Ivrea in Argentina,[45][46] Planeta de Libros in Spain,[47] Edizioni Star Comics in Italy,[48] and Sangatsu Manga in Finland.[49]\n\n\n\n### Spin-offs and crossovers[edit]\n\n\nOda teamed up with Akira Toriyama to create a single crossover of *One Piece* and Toriyama's *Dragon Ball*. Entitled *Cross Epoch*, the one-shot was published in the December 25, 2006, issue of *Weekly Shōnen Jump* and the April 2011 issue of the English *Shonen Jump*.[50] Oda collaborated with Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro, author of *Toriko*, for a crossover one-shot of their series titled *Taste of the Devil Fruit* (実食! 悪魔の実!!, *Jitsushoku! Akuma no Mi!!*, lit. \"The True Food! Devil Fruit!!\"),[51] which ran in the April 4, 2011, issue of *Weekly Shōnen Jump*. The spin-off series *One Piece Party* (ワンピースパーティー, *Wan Pīsu Pātī*), written by Ei Andō in a super deformed art style, began serialization in the January 2015 issue of *Saikyō Jump*.[52] Its final chapter was published on *Shōnen Jump+* on February 2, 2021.[53]\n\n\n\n## Related media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of *One Piece* media\n\n### Anime[edit]\n\n\n#### Festival films and original video animation[edit]\n\n\n*One Piece: Defeat Him! The Pirate Ganzack!* was produced by Production I.G for the 1998 Jump Super Anime Tour and was directed by Gorō Taniguchi.[54] Luffy, Nami, and Zoro are attacked by a sea monster that destroys their boat and separates them. Luffy is found on an island beach, where he saves a little girl, Medaka, from two pirates. All the villagers, including Medaka's father have been abducted by Ganzack and his crew and forced into labor. After hearing that Ganzack also stole all the food, Luffy and Zoro rush out to retrieve it. As they fight the pirates, one of them kidnaps Medaka. A fight starts between Luffy and Ganzack, ending with Luffy's capture. Meanwhile, Zoro is forced to give up after a threat is made to kill all the villagers. They rise up against Ganzack, and while the islanders and pirates fight, Nami unlocks the three captives. Ganzack defeats the rebellion and reveals his armored battleship. The Straw Hat Pirates are forced to fight Ganzack once more to prevent him from destroying the island.\n\n\nA second film, *One Piece: Romance Dawn Story*, was produced by Toei Animation in July 2008 for the Jump Super Anime Tour. It is 34 minutes in length and based on the first version of *Romance Dawn*.[55][7] It includes the Straw Hat Pirates up to Brook and their second ship, the *Thousand Sunny*. In search for food for his crew, Luffy arrives at a port after defeating a pirate named Crescent Moon Gally on the way. There he meets a girl named Silk, who was abandoned by attacking pirates as a baby and raised by the mayor. Her upbringing causes her to value the town as her \"treasure\". The villagers mistake Luffy for Gally and capture him just as the real Gally returns. Gally throws Luffy in the water and plans to destroy the town, but Silk saves him and Luffy pursues Gally. His crew arrives to help him, and with their help he recovers the treasure for the town, acquires food, and destroys Gally's ship. The film was later released as a triple feature DVD with *Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!* and *Tegami Bachi: Light and Blue Night*, that was available only though a mail-in offer exclusively to Japanese residents.[56]\n\n\nThe *One Piece Film Strong World: Episode 0* original video animation adapts the manga's special \"Chapter 0\", which shows how things were before and after the death of Roger. It received a limited release of three thousand DVDs as a collaboration with the House Foods brand.[57]\n\n\n\n#### TV series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *One Piece* (TV series)\n\nAn anime television series adaptation, produced by Toei Animation, premiered on Fuji TV on October 20, 1999;[58] the series reached its 1,000th episode in November 2021.[59]\n\n\n\n#### Theatrical films[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *One Piece* films\n\nFourteen animated theatrical films based on the *One Piece* series have been released. The films are typically released in March to coincide with the spring vacation of Japanese schools.[60] The films feature self-contained, completely original plots, or alternate retellings of story arcs with animation of a higher quality than what the weekly anime allows. The first three films were typically double features paired up with other anime films, and were thus, usually an hour or less in length. The films themselves offer contradictions in both chronology and design that make them incompatible with a single continuity. Funimation has licensed the eighth, tenth, and twelfth films for release in North America, and these films have received in-house dubs by the company.[61][62]\n\n\n\n### Live-action series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *One Piece* (2023 TV series)\n\nOn July 21, 2017, *Weekly Shōnen Jump* editor-in-chief Hiroyuki Nakano announced that Tomorrow Studios (a partnership between Marty Adelstein and ITV Studios) and Shueisha would commence production of an American live-action television adaptation of Eiichiro Oda's *One Piece* manga series as part of the series' 20th anniversary celebrations.[63][64] Eiichiro Oda will serve as executive producer for the series alongside Tomorrow Studios CEO Adelstein and Becky Clements.[64] The series will reportedly begin with the East Blue arc.[65]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Oda revealed that Netflix ordered a first season consisting of ten episodes.[66] On May 19, 2020, producer Marty Adelstein revealed during an interview with SyFy Wire, that the series was originally set to begin filming in Cape Town sometime around August, but has since been delayed to around September due to COVID-19. He also revealed that, during the same interview, all ten scripts had been written for the series and they were set to begin casting sometime in June.[67] However, executive producer Matt Owens stated in September 2020 that casting had not yet commenced.[68] On September 15, 2023, Oda revealed that the show has been renewed for the second season.[69]\n\n\nIn March 2021, production started up again with showrunner Steven Maeda revealing that the series codename is *Project Roger*.[70] In November 2021, it was announced that the casting for the series includes Iñaki Godoy as Monkey D.

In 2009, the 56th volume had a print run of 2.85 million, the highest initial print run of any manga by then.[141] The 57th volume had a print run of 3 million in 2010,[142] a record that was broken several times by subsequent volumes. The 60th volume had a first print run of 3.4 million and was the first book to sell over two million copies in its opening week on Oricon book rankings,[143][144] and later became the first book to sell over three million copies in Oricon's history.[145] In 2012, the 67th volume had an initial print run of 4.05 million, holding the record of the volume with the highest number of copies in the first print.[146] *One Piece* is the only manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than ten years.[147] In May 2023, it was reported that each of the 105 volumes, published by then, had sold over 1 million copies.[148] Additionally, *One Piece* is the only work whose volumes have ranked first every year in Oricon's weekly comic chart existence since 2008.[149][150]\n\n\n*One Piece* has also sold well in North America, charting on *Publishers Weekly*'s list of best-selling comics for April/May 2007 and numerous times on *The New York Times* Manga Best Seller list.[151][152][153] On *ICv2*'s list of Top 25 Manga Properties Fall 2008 for North America, which is compiled by interviews with retailers and distributors, Nielsen BookScan's Top 20 Lists of graphic novels and *ICv2*'s own analysis of information provided by Diamond Comic Distributors, *One Piece* came in fifteenth place.[154] It rose to second place on their Top 25 Manga Properties Q3 2010 list.[155] By August 2022, the manga has sold 2.9 million copies in print in North America (including single volumes and omnibus editions).[156]\n\n\nIn France, *One Piece* has been the best-selling manga since 2011,[157] with over 31.80 million copies sold by August 2022.[158] The manga is very popular in the country, where its sales alone represent 8.5% of the French manga market by 2021.[159] The first volume had sold more than 1 million copies in France by July 2021.[160] The 100th volume had one of the biggest initial prints ever for a manga in the French market, selling 131,270 copies in just three days, the best-selling manga volume in a week in the country.[161][162] The manga sold 6,011,536 copies in 2021.[163] This amount represents almost 20% of the total sales in the country; almost one in five volumes of the series was sold in the year.[164]\n\n\nIn Italy, *One Piece* had 18 million copies in circulation by April 2021.[165] which represents around 22.5% of the series market outside Japan.[166] In September 2021, the limited edition of the ninety-eighth volume ranked first in the best-selling books weekly ranking, making it the first time that a manga reaches that achievement.[167]\n\n\nIn Germany, *One Piece* is the second best-selling manga behind *Dragon Ball*. The manga had sold 6.7 million copies in the country.[168]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nAllen Divers of *Anime News Network* comments in 2003 that the art style *One Piece* employs \"initially seems very cartoonish with much of the character designs showing more North American influence than that from its Japanese origins\", adding that the \"artwork and settings come across as timeless in their presentation\". He also notes that the influence of Akira Toriyama (*Dragon Ball*) shines through in Oda's style of writing with its \"huge epic battles punctuated by a lot of humor\" and that, in *One Piece*, he \"manages to share a rich tale without getting bogged down by overly complicated plots\".[169] Rebecca Silverman of the same site stated that one of the series' strengths is to \"blend action, humor, and heavy fare together\" and praised the art, but stated that the panels could get too crowded for easy reading.[170] The website *activeAnime* describes the artwork in *One Piece* as \"wonderfully quirky and full of expression\".[171] Mario Vuk from *Splash Comics* commented that Oda's \"pleasantly bright and dynamic\" art style suits the story's \"funny and exciting\" atmosphere.[172] Isaiah Colbert of *Kotaku* called *One Piece* a \"masterpiece\", highlighting Oda's character writing, world-building and the balance between \"fun and serious subject matter\".[173] Dale Bashir of IGN wrote that *One Piece* is more about the world-building, adventuring, and the meaning of freedom instead of the \"usual shonen battling\" from series like *Dragon Ball* and *Naruto*. Bashir concluded: \"While not everyone would want to go so far for a franchise that isn't even finished yet, trust me when I say that it is definitely worth it.\"[174]\n\n\nEX Media lauds Oda's art for its \"crispy\" monochrome pictures, \"great use of subtle shade changes\" on color pages, \"sometimes exquisite\" use of angles, and for its consistency.[175] Shaenon K. Garrity, who at some point edited the series for English *Shonen Jump*, said that, while doing so, her amazement over Oda's craft grew steadily. She states that \"he has a natural, playful mastery of the often restrictive weekly-manga format,\" notes that \"interesting things [are] going on deep in the narrative structure,\" and recommends \"sticking through to the later volumes to see just how crazy and Peter Max-y the art gets\".[176] Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine commented: \"*One Piece* is a fun adventure story, with an ensemble cast that is continuing to develop, with great action and character drama.\" He praised Oda's artwork as \"imaginative and creative\" and commented that \"Oda's imagination just oozes all of the panels [*sic*]\". He also noted that \"Oda's panel work [...] features a lot of interesting perspectives and direction, especially during the explosive action sequences which are always a blast\".[177]\n\n\nIn March 2021, *Mobile Suit Gundam*'s creator, Yoshiyuki Tomino, said in his interview that *One Piece* is the \"only manga to trust\". He praised the manga, commenting: \"Still, we are working in the same studio and I saw storyboards near the photocopier. Unlike mine, those storyboards are good. But, you know, among the popular manga there is manga with very beautiful art and manga with bad art, but interesting nonetheless. And I don't trust manga with very beautiful art unless it is *One Piece*.[178]\n\n\nAfter the release of the hundredth volume, *Weekly Shonen Jump*'s editor-in-chief, Hiroyuki Nakano, explained how *One Piece* changed the history of manga and the way of making it. Nakano said that *Weekly Shonen Jump* is \"a game of weekly popularity\", and before *One Piece*, he aimed for something \"interesting this week without thinking about the next\"; however, the series reached overwhelming popularity due to its style that involves a story concept and detailed hints, adding that the series had a huge impact on other series. Nakano lauded Oda for his \"overwhelming passion, talent and power\" and his \"unwavering will\" to deliver a story to boys and girls, adding that he goes far beyond the reader's expectations, with the belief in \"don't fool the reader\" and \"there is something interesting ahead of it\".[179]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nThe brand made more than $1 billion in retail sales in Japan by 2004.[180][181]\n\n\n\n### Awards and accolades[edit]\n\n\n*One Piece* was nominated for the 23rd Kodansha Manga Award in the *shōnen* category in 1999.[182] It was a finalist for the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize three times in a row from 2000 to 2002,[183][184][185] with the highest number of fan nominations in the first two years.[186] The manga was nominated for Favorite Manga Series in *Nickelodeon Magazine*'s 2009 Comics Awards.[187] In 2012, the series won the 41st Japan Cartoonists Association Award Grand Prize, alongside Kimuchi Yokoyama's *Neko Darake*.[188] In 2014, the series received the 18th Yomiuri Advertising Award's Golden Medal.[189] It also won the 34th Newspaper Advertising Award in the Advertising category[190] and the 67th Advertising Dentsu Award in Newspaper Advertising Planning category.[191]\n\n\nThe forty-sixth volume of *One Piece* was the best manga of 2007, according to the Oricon's Japanese Book of the Year Action Committee.[192] The series was chosen as one of the best continuing manga for all ages/teens in 2011 by critics from About.com, Anime News Network, and ComicsAlliance.[193] The series has ranked on the \"Book of the Year\" list from Media Factory's *Da Vinci* magazine, where professional book reviewers, bookstore employees, and *Da Vinci* readers participate; it ranked fifth in 2011;[194] second in 2012;[195] third in 2013;[196] second in 2014, 2015 and 2016;[197][198][199] third in 2017 and 2018;[200][201] second in 2019;[202] third in 2020 and 2021;[203][204] and second in 2022.[205] It ranked eighth in the 2023 edition of Takarajimasha's *Kono Manga ga Sugoi!* list of best manga for male readers.[206]\n\n\nThe German translation of the manga won the Sondermann Award in the international manga category in 2005. The series received the award for the forty-fourth volume in 2008[207] and the forty-eighth volume in 2009.[208] *One Piece* won the *AnimeLand*'s Anime & Manga 19th Grand Prix for the \"Best Classic Shōnen\" category in 2012.[209][210]\n\n\nIn a poll conducted by Oricon in 2008 about \"the most moving (touching) manga ever\", *One Piece* ranked first in both male and female categories.[211] In another 2008 poll by Oricon, Japanese teenagers voted it the most interesting manga.[212] On Tencent's anime and manga web portal, *One Piece* ranked first in a poll of \"must-read manga for the younger generation in China\".[213] In a poll conducted by eBookJapan in 2014 about \"manga that children want to read\" for \"Children's Reading Day\" by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the series also ranked first.[214]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2015, it was announced that Eiichiro Oda and *One Piece* had set the Guinness World Record for \"The most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\" with 320,866,000 copies printed worldwide by December 2014;[215] it updated the record on August 4, 2022, when it reached over 500 million copies in circulation worldwide in both print and digital copies (416,566,000 in Japan and 100 million copies in 60 countries and territories outside of Japan).[129] The series ranked fourth on the first annual Tsutaya Comic Awards' All-Time Best Section in 2017.[216] In 2021, TV Asahi announced the results of its \"Manga General Election\" poll in which 150,000 people voted for their \"Most Favorite Manga\", *One Piece* ranked first on the list.[217][218]\n\n\nIn 2014, the \"*One Piece* Premiere Summer\" event received the \"Best Overall Production\" award from the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions.[219]\n\n\n\n### Cultural impact[edit]\n\n\nAs part of an effort to help Kumamoto Prefecture recover from the 2016 earthquakes, Oda helped set up 10 statues of the Straw Hat Pirates around the prefecture. Luffy was the first statue to be unveiled in front of the Kumamoto Prefectual Government Office on November 30, 2018. Jinbe was the last statue, unveiled at Sumiyoshi Kaigan Park on July 23, 2022.[220][221]\n\n\nAt the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Greek athlete Miltiadis Tentoglou performed a \"Gear Second\" pose before winning a gold medal in the men's long jump competition.[222] A gene in the fruit fly (*Drosophila melanogaster*) was named \"Baramicin\", partly taking inspiration from the *One Piece* character Buggy. The gene encodes a protein that is split up into multiple parts.[223] A testate amoeba genus was named *Alabasta*, partly in reference to the *One Piece* Kingdom of *Alabasta*, also known as the Kingdom of Sand, a desert kingdom located on Sandy Island in the Paradise region.[224]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nFile:Thousand Sunny.JPG\nLife-size reproductions of the main characters' two pirate ships: the *Going Merry* (top) and the *Thousand Sunny* (bottom)\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n**Japanese names**\n\n\n\n1. **^** Devil Fruits (悪魔の実, *Akuma no Mi*)\n2. **^** Haki (覇気)\n3. **^** Red Line (赤い土の大陸, *Reddo Rain*)\n4. **^** Grand Line (偉大なる航路, *Reddo Rain*)\n5. **^** Calm Belt (凪の帯, *Kāmu Beruto*)\n6. **^** Sea Kings (海王類, *Kaiō-rui*)\n7. **^** North Blue (北の海, *Nōsu Burū*)\n8. **^** East Blue (東の海, *Īsuto Burū*)\n9. **^** West Blue (西の海, *Uesuto Burū*)\n10. **^** South Blue (南の海, *Sausu Burū*)\n11. **^** Sea Prism Stone (海楼石, *Kairōseki*, Seastone)\n12. **^** Reverse Mountain (リヴァース・マウンテン, *Rivāsu Maunten*)\n13. **^** Paradise (楽園, *Paradaisu*)\n14. **^** New World (新世界, *Shinsekai*)\n15. **^** Straw Hat Pirates (麦わら海賊団, *Mugiwara Kaizoku-dan*)\n16. **^** *Going Merry* (ゴーイング・メリー号, *Gōingu Merī-gō*)\n17. **^** *Thousand Sunny* (サウザンドサニー号, *Sauzando Sanī-gō*)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Official Website for One Piece\".

The series follows the title character, a professional assassin for hire. *Golgo 13* is the oldest manga still in publication, and its *tankōbon* edition was certified by *Guinness World Records* as the highest number of volumes for a manga series. Saito said before his death in 2021 that he wanted the manga to continue on without him and previously raised concerns the manga may be unfinished after he passes away. The Saito Production group of manga creators will continue its publication with the assistance of the *Big Comic*'s editorial department.\n\n\nThe series has been adapted into two live-action feature films, an anime film, an original video animation, an anime television series and six video games.\n\n\nWith a cumulative total of 300 million copies in circulation in various formats, including compilation books, it is the second-best-selling manga series and the top-selling *seinen* manga series in history. The manga won the 1975 Shogakukan Manga Award for general manga and the Grand Prize at the 2002 Japan Cartoonists Association Awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Story[edit]\n\n\nGolgo 13 is a professional assassin. His real name, age and birthplace are unknown and there is no consensus in the worldwide intelligence community as to his true identity.[2] Most of his jobs are completed through the use of a customized, scoped M16 rifle. His most frequently used alias is Duke Togo (デューク・東郷, *Dyūku Tōgō*), but he also goes by Tadashi Togo (東郷 隆, *Tōgō Tadashi*) and Togo Rodriguez (トーゴ・ロドリゲス, *Tōgo Rodorigesu*).\n\n\nDuke Togo has a very quiet personality and will only talk when he needs to, he shows very little to no emotion when carrying out an assassination and is willing to kill anyone who will threaten to expose him. He accepts many different assassination jobs, from anyone who can afford his services. From simply shooting a violin string to taking out powerful organized crime bosses and political figures, these killings have often attracted retaliations against Golgo 13, even at one stage having both the FBI, CIA, and even the United States military out to kill him, causing Togo to always have to watch his own back and pay attention to his surroundings in order to stop other assassins and contract killers employed to kill him in often creative ways. Golgo 13 also employs many different people himself to assist him in his assassination jobs, such as in providing extra information on his targets to modifying his weapons, vehicles, and gadgets.\n\n\nThe name \"Golgo 13\" is a reference to the death of Jesus Christ. *Golgo* is short for Golgotha, the place of Jesus' crucifixion, while the number 13 is considered an unlucky number.[3] Also, Golgo 13's logo is a skeleton wearing a crown of thorns.\n\n\nDuke Togo's past is a mystery. Although his Asian appearance suggests that he may be of Japanese origin, many of Golgo 13's stories have presented different speculations about his true identity while presenting contradictory information, leaving the audience uncertain which information is true. It is known that he may be the biological father of many different children all over the world from the many sexual encounters he has had with women throughout the series, such as a four-year-old son named Joey from ex-Provisional Irish Republican Army fighter Catherine McCall.[4][5]\n\n\nWith respect to the character's age, a large number of stories are dated as they are centered around current events of the time. However, Golgo 13's age has not increased significantly to account for these events. He has also suffered multiple injuries throughout the series, leaving many different scars on his body.[6]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nEarly on, Takao Saito developed a system where he created the page layout based on a script written by the editorial department. He also inked the main characters' faces, while assistants provided the backgrounds and other elements. He did extensive research to provide accuracy, especially when the plot dealt with technology.[7] Kazuo Koike was one of the writers on the series in the beginning.[8][9] Author Yoichi Funado wrote approximately 30 stories for *Golgo 13*, three of which he later novelized.[10] Takashi Nagasaki was Saito's editor on the series in the mid-1980s, and later wrote two stories for the manga under the pen name \"Keishi Edogawa\".[11]\n\n\nAccording to Jason Thompson, several *Golgo 13* stories have not been reprinted for being \"offensive or libelous\". Thompson lists one from 1986 because of complaints from the Iranian embassy in Japan, another from 1988 about money laundering in the Vatican, and one from 1989 about a Hollywood actor blackmailed when someone discovers he has AIDS.[12]\n\n\nIn 2013, Saito stated that because he often worried about his manga being cancelled, he had an ending planned out that even included the panel layout. He said he had no idea when *Golgo 13* would end, claiming \"The manga has continued so long that it is no longer the property of the author; it belongs to the readers.\"[13] Two years later, *Big Comic*'s fourth issue of 2015 announced that the series was \"heading towards its conclusion.\"[14]\n\n\nDue to difficulties that arose from the restrictions implemented by the government to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, *Golgo 13* began its first hiatus in its 52-year history in May 2020.[15] It returned on July 7, 2020.[16]\n\n\nSaito died of pancreatic cancer at 84 on September 24, 2021.[17][18] According to Shogakukan, Saito said before his death that he wanted the manga to continue on without him. The Saito Production group of manga creators continues its publication with the assistance of *Big Comic*'s editorial department.[19]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Manga[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *Golgo 13* chapters\n\nWritten and illustrated by Takao Saito, *Golgo 13* has been serialized in the monthly manga magazine *Big Comic* since its January 1969 issue, published in October 1968.[20] The chapters have been collected into *tankōbon* volumes by Shogakukan and Leed Publishing, a spinoff of the author's own Saito Production,[12] since June 21, 1973.[21] As of July 2023, 209 volumes of the *tankōbon* edition have been published,[22] while the *bunkoban* edition has 167 volumes.[23]\n\n\nIn 1986, Leed Publishing released four *Golgo 13* stories translated by Patrick Connolly: \"Into the Wolves' Lair\", \"Galinpero\", \"The Ice Lake Hit\" and \"The Ivory Connection\".[12][24]\n\n\nIn 1989 and 1990, Leed and Vic Tokai published two further *Golgo 13* comic books, \"The Impossible Hit\" and \"The Border Hopper\", as part of the promotion for two *Golgo 13* video games.[12] The comics were released to the US public via a mail-in offer with the purchase of the games and were later even found packaged with the video games. Each issue contained one complete story and had nothing to do with the storylines of the video games themselves.\n\n\nIn 1991, Leed Publishing and Viz Media published *The Professional: Golgo 13*, a three-part mini-series.[12] *The Professional* was a re-printing of \"The Argentine Tiger\", a story where Golgo is hired by the British Government to assassinate the reportedly dead ex-president of Argentina Juan Perón.\n\n\nIn 2006, *Golgo 13* was brought back by Viz as part of their Viz Signature collection. The stories are picked from the forty-year history of the manga, and do not necessarily represent the original's order of publication. A total of thirteen volumes were published, with the thirteenth volume being published on February 19, 2008. Each volume ends with an editorial commentary on *Golgo 13* as a cultural phenomenon in Japan.[6]\n\n\nA spin-off manga titled *Gunsmith Dave* (銃器職人・デイブ) and focusing on the character Dave McCartney began serialization in the August special issue of *Big Comic* on July 17, 2021.[25] The spin-off ended its \"first season\" on May 17, 2022.[26] Saito and Saito Production are credited with creating the manga.[27]\n\n\nA second spin-off, *Golgo Camp* (ゴルゴCAMP) created by Yukio Miyama, was launched on Shogakukan's *Manga One* app on August 28, 2021.[28] It is a gag comedy and follows Golgo 13 at a modern-day campsite.[29]\n\n\nA third spin-off, *G no Idenshi: Shōjo Fanette* (Gの遺伝子 少女ファネット), began serialization in the August issue of *Big Comic Zōkan* on July 15, 2022.[26] It focuses on the French junior high school student Fanette, who has Golgo's genes.[30]\n\n\n\n### Live action[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Golgo 13* (film) and *Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon*\n\nToei Company produced a live-action film simply titled *Golgo 13* in 1973, directed by Junya Sato and starring Ken Takakura as Duke Togo and Pouri Banayi as Catherine Morton. It was filmed entirely in the Imperial State of Iran with an entirely Persian supporting cast. It was followed by *Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon* in 1977, directed by Yukio Noda, which replaced Takakura with Sonny Chiba. In 2011, production company Davis Film obtained the American film rights to *Golgo*.[31]\n\n\n\n### Anime[edit]\n\n\n#### *Golgo 13: The Professional*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Golgo 13: The Professional*\n\n*Golgo 13: The Professional*, known simply as *Golgo 13* in Japan, is a 1983 animated featured film. Golgo 13's voice is provided by Tetsurō Sagawa in the Japanese version, and Gregory Snegoff in Streamline Pictures' English dub. It incorporates CGI animation, which was in its infancy at the time. This is most notable in the scene where army helicopters circle around Dawson Tower and attack Golgo as he climbs toward Dawson's office on the top floor.\n\n\n\n#### *Golgo 13: Queen Bee*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Golgo 13: Queen Bee*\n\n*Golgo 13: Queen Bee* is an original video animation that was released in 1998. Tesshō Genda provides the voice of Golgo 13 in the Japanese version, while in the English version, he is voiced by John DiMaggio.\n\n\n\n#### TV series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *Golgo 13* episodes\n\nA *Golgo 13* anime television series was produced by The Answer Studio and aired on TV Tokyo and other stations from April 11, 2008, to March 27, 2009, for 50 episodes.[32] Hiroshi Tachi provides the voice of Golgo 13. The series was licensed by Sentai Filmworks, with the first DVD released on July 13, 2010.[33] In English, Golgo is voiced by David Wald.\n\n\nThe anime aired in North America on the Anime Network on Demand channel.[34] It is also aired on television in the Philippines by TV5 and in South Korea by Animax Korea.[35]\n\n\nThe first opening theme song is \"Take the Wave\" by Naifu for the first 25 episodes, and the second is \"So Far Away\" by Pinc Inc for the remaining. The first ending theme song for the first 12 episodes is \"Garasu no Haiwei (Highway of Glass)\" by doa,[36] while \"Yume no Hitotsu\" by Garnet Crow is used for episodes 13–25. The third ending theme is \"Sono Egao Yo Eien ni\" by Kitahara Aiko for episodes 26 to 38,[37] and the final ending song is \"Mou Kimi wo Hitori ni Sasenai\" by U-ka Saegusa in dB from 39–50.\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nSeveral video games based on *Golgo 13* have been released: \n\n\n\n* The first *Golgo 13* video game was released for the Sega SG-1000 in 1984, followed by *Golgo 13: Oi no Su* for the MSX in 1985.\n* Two games were released by Vic Tokai on the Nintendo Entertainment System: *Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode* (1988) and *The Mafat Conspiracy* (1990). Both are the only *Golgo 13* games to receive official English releases, with the license intact.\n* Two digital mangas were released only in Japan for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows in 1998; the digital manga features English text option, in addition to Japanese.\n* Namco and Eighting/Raizing developed three lightgun arcade games, similar to the *Silent Scope* series, but with a few differences. The rifle only contained a magnifying lens, not a small monitor like *Silent Scope*. The screen itself would close up on the target only when the sensor on the underside of the rifle base was activated by the player leaning their shoulder into it. Each mission was preceded by an eight- to ten-panel manga briefing. The first two releases, *Golgo 13* in 1999 and *Golgo 13: Kiseki no Dandou* (*Golgo 13: Miraculous Trajectory*) in 2000, ran on Namco System 12 hardware, with the third, *Golgo 13: Juusei no Chinkonka* (*Golgo 13: Requiem of a Gunshot*) in 2001, on Namco System 10 hardware.\n* The most recent *Golgo 13* game, *Golgo 13: File G-13*, was released for the Nintendo DS on June 18, 2009, by Marvelous Entertainment.[38] The game consists of a large quiz mode, featuring questions spanning the forty-year history of *Golgo 13*, as well as several mini-games, including the \"Don't Stand Behind Me\" game, in which the player, as Golgo 13, must punch people who walk up behind him (a reference to the tagline shown at the end of each episode of the 2008 anime, \"Do not stand behind him, if you value your life.\") The game is played holding the DS on its side, also known as \"book style\".\n\n\nThere was also an LCD game based on *Golgo 13* released only in Japan by Popy in 1982, as well as several pachinko and pachislot machines released in Japan between 2001 and 2017,[39] one of which receiving a simulator port for the PlayStation in 2002.\n\n\nA version of Golgo 13's signature weapon, the scoped M16, was released in the Japanese version of *Alliance of Valiant Arms* as a usable weapon.[40]\n\n\n\n### Other media[edit]\n\n\nIn addition, the title character has appeared in a number of TV commercials in Japan, including NEC[41] and Lotte Black Black.[42] There was also a radio drama featuring Masane Tsukayama as Golgo 13.\n\n\nAn Airsoft gun has been made by Tokyo Marui based on the rifle Golgo 13 uses.[43] A figure based on Golgo 13 was released on August 25, 2009.[44][45]\n\n\nIn November 2023, it was reported that the 1971 anime adaptation of *Golgo 13*, allegedly lost for many years, was found and will be broadcast on TV for the first time in over 50 years. It is set to broadcast on BS-TBS, under the title *Golgo 13 Selection*, on December 10–17, 2023; only a few episodes have been recovered.[46][47]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n*Golgo 13* won the 21st Shogakukan Manga Award in the General category in 1975, the Grand Prize at the 2002 Japan Cartoonists Association Awards, and the Special Judges Award at the 50th Shogakukan Manga Awards in 2005.[48][49] With the publication of volume 201 in July 2021, *Golgo 13* was certified as holding the *Guinness World Record* for \"Most volumes published for a single manga series.\"[50] On TV Asahi's Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, *Golgo 13* ranked 36th.[51] *Golgo 13* is one of the works credited with popularizing the *gekiga* movement in Japanese comics, which strives for more realistic and dramatic works. Saito himself is surprised by his series' popularity overseas, because it is firmly rooted in Japanese culture and samurai. He cited the timing of when Golgo actually takes his shot as an example; \"It evokes *iaidō* [the martial art of drawing one's sword and mimicking a deadly blow]. It is the same movement and the same shape. I love Japanese samurai stories and that is why, unconsciously, Golgo moves like a samurai. That is why I thought foreigners wouldn't understand the story.\"[52]\n\n\nBy March 2021, *Golgo 13* had over 300 million copies in circulation in various formats, including compilation books, it is the second-best-selling manga series and the top-selling *seinen* manga series in history.[53]\n\n\nAnime News Network's Carl Kimlinger compared Saito's work on the series to the novels of John le Carré and Frederick Forsyth, as the stories are \"dark, meticulously constructed [and] painstakingly realistic\".[54] Leo Lewis of the *Financial Times* wrote that \"Unsmiling, misogynist and inexorable, [the character] is a literary cousin of James Bond without the scene-softeners of Moneypenny, M, Q or exploding fountain pens.\"[52] The *Daily Vanguard* called Duke \"a badass, something like a cross between Dirty Harry and *Metal Gear Solid*'s Solid Snake.\"[6] JC DuBois of Dragon's Anime has criticized those who say that most of Golgo 13's hits are impossible to do since there are problems that would prevent him from shooting straight such as the wind or with the coriolis effect, saying that the \"whole mystique of *Golgo 13* is that he's just that damn good. He CAN make those shots—and he can do it with one shot.\"[55]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Official Website for Golgo 13\". Viz Media.

The initial manga, written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in *Weekly Shōnen Jump* from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters collected into 42 *tankōbon* volumes by its publisher Shueisha. *Dragon Ball* was originally inspired by the classical 16th-century Chinese novel *Journey to the West*, combined with elements of Hong Kong martial arts films. *Dragon Ball* characters also use a variety of East Asian martial arts styles, including karate[1][2][3] and Wing Chun (kung fu).[2][3][4] The series follows the adventures of protagonist Son Goku from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts. He spends his childhood far from civilization until he meets a teen girl named Bulma, who encourages him to join her quest in exploring the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several other friends, becomes a family man, discovers his alien heritage, and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls.\n\n\nToriyama's manga was adapted and divided into two anime series produced by Toei Animation: *Dragon Ball* and *Dragon Ball Z*, which together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. Additionally, the studio has developed 21 animated feature films and three television specials, as well as an anime sequel series titled *Dragon Ball GT* (1996–1997) and an anime midquel series titled *Dragon Ball Super* (2015–2018). From 2009 to 2015, a revised version of *Dragon Ball Z* aired in Japan under the title *Dragon Ball Kai*, as a recut that follows the manga's story more faithfully by removing most of the material featured exclusively in the anime. Several companies have developed various types of merchandise based on the series leading to a large media franchise that includes films (both animated and live-action), collectible trading card games, action figures, collections of soundtracks, and numerous video games. *Dragon Ball* has become one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\n\n\nSince its release, *Dragon Ball* has become one of the most successful manga and anime series of all time, with the manga sold in over 40 countries and the anime broadcast in more than 80 countries. The manga's 42 collected *tankōbon* volumes have over 160 million copies sold in Japan and 260 million copies sold worldwide,[5][a][c] making it one of the best-selling manga series. Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humor of the story. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential manga series ever made, with many manga artists citing *Dragon Ball* as a source of inspiration for their own now-popular works. The anime, particularly *Dragon Ball Z*, is also highly popular around the world and is considered one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture. It has had a considerable impact on global popular culture, referenced by and inspiring numerous artists, athletes, celebrities, filmmakers, musicians, and writers around the world.\n\n\n\n\n## Setting[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Dragon Ball characters\n\nEarth, known as the Dragon World (ドラゴンワールド) and designated as \"Planet 4032-877\" by the celestial hierarchy, is the main setting for the entire Dragon Ball series, as well as related media such as *Dr. Slump*, *Neko Majin*, and *Jaco the Galactic Patrolman*. It is mainly inhabited by Earthlings (地球人, *Chikyūjin*), a term used inclusively to refer to all of the intelligent races native to the planet, including humans, anthropomorphic beings, and monsters. Starting from the *Dragon Ball Z* series, various extraterrestrial species such as the Saiyans (サイヤ人, *Saiya-jin*) and Namekians (ナメック星人, *Namekku-seijin*) have played a more prominent role in franchise media.\n\n\nThe narrative of *Dragon Ball* predominantly follows the adventures of the Saiyan Son Goku; upon meeting Bulma at the beginning of the series, the two embark on an adventure to gather the seven Dragon Balls, a set of orbs that summon the wish-granting dragon Shenlong.[ch. 1] Goku later receives martial arts training from Kame-Sen'nin, meets his lifelong friend Kuririn, and enters the *Tenkaichi Budōkai* (天下一武道会, lit. \"Strongest Under the Heavens Martial Arts Tournament\") to fight the world's strongest warriors. When Piccolo Daimao, and later his offspring Piccolo, tries to conquer the planet, Goku receives training from Earth's deities to defeat them. Goku later sacrifices his life to save the planet from his estranged brother Raditz,[ch. 205] but is revived after training in the afterlife under the tutelage of the North Kaio to combat the other incoming Saiyans, Nappa and Vegeta. He later becomes a Super Saiyan and defeats the powerful alien tyrant Freeza; this sets the tone of the rest of the series, with each enemy the characters face becoming stronger than the last, requiring them to attain further training.\n\n\n*Dragon Ball Super* establishes that the franchise is set in a multiverse[11] composed of twelve[d] numbered universes, with the majority of the *Dragon Ball* series taking place in Universe 7 (第７宇宙, *Dai-Nana Uchū*, lit. \"Number Seven Universe\"). Each universe is ruled by a number of benevolent and malevolent deities, respectively called Kaioshin and Gods of Destruction who are appointed by a higher being called Zeno, who watches over the multiverse.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Dragon Ball characters and Dragon Ball (manga) § Production\n\nFile:Akira Toriyama.jpgAkira Toriyama, the creator of *Dragon Ball*\nAkira Toriyama was a fan of Hong Kong martial arts films, particularly Bruce Lee films such as *Enter the Dragon* (1973) and Jackie Chan films such as *Drunken Master* (1978), and wanted to create a manga inspired by martial arts films.[12][13][14] This led to Toriyama creating the 1983 one-shot manga *Dragon Boy*, which he later redeveloped into *Dragon Ball*.[15] Toriyama loosely modeled the plot and characters of *Dragon Ball* on the classic Chinese novel *Journey to the West*,[16][15] with Goku being Sun Wukong (\"Son Goku\" in Japanese), Bulma as Tang Sanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie, and Yamcha being Sha Wujing.[17] Toriyama wanted to create a story with the basic theme of *Journey to the West*, but with \"a little kung fu\"[18] by combining the novel with elements from the kung fu films of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee.[19] The title *Dragon Ball* was inspired by *Enter the Dragon* and later Bruceploitation knockoff kung fu films which frequently had the word \"Dragon\" in the title,[12] and the fighting scenes were influenced by Jackie Chan movies.[20][17] Since it was serialized in a shōnen manga magazine, he added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give it a game-like activity of gathering something, without thinking of what the characters would wish for.[18] His concept of the Dragon Balls was inspired by the epic Japanese novel *Nansō Satomi Hakkenden* (1814–1842), which involves the heroes collecting eight Buddhist prayer beads, which Toriyama adapted into collecting seven Dragon Balls.[21][22]\n\n\nHe originally thought it would last about a year or end once the Dragon Balls were collected.[23] Toriyama stated that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand, he specifically aimed *Dragon Ball* at readers older than those of his previous serial *Dr. Slump*.[24] He also wanted to break from the Western influences common in *Dr. Slump*, deliberately going for Chinese scenery, referencing Chinese buildings and photographs of China his wife had bought.[25] Toriyama wanted to set *Dragon Ball* in a fictional world largely based on Asia, taking inspiration from several Asian cultures including Japanese, Chinese, South Asian, Central Asian, Arabic and Indonesian cultures.[26] The island where the *Tenkaichi Budōkai* is held is modeled after Bali (in Indonesia), which he, his wife and assistant visited in mid-1985, and for the area around Bobbidi's spaceship he consulted photos of Africa.[25] Toriyama was also inspired by the jinn (genies) from *The Arabian Nights*.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Earth of *Dragon Ball*, as published in *Daizenshuu 4: World Guide*\nDuring the early chapters of the manga, Toriyama's editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, commented that Goku looked rather plain. To combat this, he added several characters like Kame-Sen'nin and Kuririn, and created the *Tenkaichi Budōkai* martial arts tournament to focus the storyline on fighting. It was when the first *Tenkaichi Budōkai* began that *Dragon Ball* truly became popular, having recalled the races and tournaments in *Dr. Slump*.[17] Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory. This allowed for more character growth as the manga progressed. He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline was inspired by the video game *Spartan X* (called *Kung-Fu Master* in the West), in which enemies appear very fast as the player ascends a tower (the game was in turn inspired by Jackie Chan's *Wheels on Meals* and Bruce Lee's *Game of Death*). He then created Piccolo Daimao as a truly evil villain, and as a result called that arc the most interesting to draw.[17]\n\n\nOnce Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (サイヤ人, *Saiya-jin*); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[28] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[17] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (超(スーパー)サイヤ人, *Sūpā Saiya-jin*) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[29] Goku's Super Saiyan form has blonde hair because it was easier to draw for Toriyama's assistant (who spent a lot of time blacking in Goku's hair), and has piercing eyes based on Bruce Lee's paralyzing glare.[30] *Dragon Ball Z* anime character designer Tadayoshi Yamamuro also used Bruce Lee as a reference for Goku's Super Saiyan form, stating that, when he \"first becomes a Super Saiyan, his slanting pose with that scowling look in his eyes is all Bruce Lee.\"[31] Toriyama later added time travel during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[17] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but later felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[17]\n\n\nGoing against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of *Dragon Ball*'s most powerful characters with small statures, including the protagonist, Goku.[32] Toriyama later explained that he had Goku grow up as a means to make drawing fight scenes easier, even though his first editor Kazuhiko Torishima was initially against it because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically.[33] When including fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid difficulties in drawing residents and destroyed buildings.[25] Toriyama said that he did not plan the details of the story, resulting in strange occurrences and discrepancies later in the series, including changing the colors of the characters mid-story and few characters having screentone because he found it difficult to use.[20][18][23][34] Since the completion of *Dragon Ball*, Toriyama has continued to add to its story, mostly background information on its universe, through guidebooks published by Shueisha.\n\n\nDuring the second half of the series, Toriyama has said that he had become more interested in coming up with the story than actually drawing it, and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines.[20] In 2013, he stated that because *Dragon Ball* is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborate, going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art.[33] He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an \"unconventional and contradictory\" story.[32] In 2013, commenting on *Dragon Ball*'s global success, Toriyama said, \"Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy.\", \"The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. I dare say I don't care even if [my works] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers.\"[35]\n\n\n\n## Manga[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dragon Ball (manga)\n\n![](image)*Dragon Ball* debuted in *Weekly Shōnen Jump* No. 51, on December 3, 1984 which is also considered to be highly sought after among fans and collectors\nWritten and illustrated by Akira Toriyama, *Dragon Ball* was serialized in the manga anthology *Weekly Shōnen Jump* from December 3, 1984 to June 5, 1995,[36][37] when Toriyama grew exhausted and felt he needed a break from drawing. The 519 individual chapters were published into 42 *tankōbon* volumes by Shueisha from September 10, 1985 through August 4, 1995.[38][39][40] Between December 4, 2002 and April 2, 2004, the chapters were re-released in a collection of 34 *kanzenban* volumes, which included a slightly rewritten ending, new covers, and color artwork from its *Weekly Shōnen Jump* run.[41][42] The February 2013 issue of *V Jump*, which was released in December 2012, announced that parts of the manga will be fully colored and re-released in 2013.[43] Twenty volumes, beginning from chapter 195 and grouped by story arcs, were released between February 4, 2013 and July 4, 2014.[44][45] Twelve volumes covering the first 194 chapters were published between January 4 and March 4, 2016.[46][47] A *sōshūhen* edition that aims to recreate the manga as it was originally serialized in *Weekly Shōnen Jump* with color pages, promotional text, and next chapter previews, was published in eighteen volumes between May 13, 2016 and January 13, 2017.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Spin-offs[edit]\n\n\nAnother manga penned by Ōishi, the three-chapter *Dragon Ball: Episode of Bardock* that revolves around Bardock, Goku's father, was published in the monthly magazine *V Jump* from August and October 2011.[50]\n\n\nThe final chapter of Toriyama's 2013 manga series *Jaco the Galactic Patrolman* revealed that it is set before *Dragon Ball*, with several characters making appearances.[51] *Jaco*'s collected volumes contain a bonus *Dragon Ball* chapter depicting Goku's mother.[52]\n\n\nIn December 2016, a spin-off manga titled *Dragon Ball Side Story: The Case of Being Reincarnated as Yamcha* began in Shueisha's *Shōnen Jump+* digital magazine. Written and illustrated by Dragon Garow Lee, it is about a high school boy who after an accident wakes up in the body of Yamcha in the *Dragon Ball* manga.[53]\n\n\n\n### Crossovers[edit]\n\n\nToriyama also created a short series, *Neko Majin* (1999–2005), that became a self-parody of *Dragon Ball*.[54] In 2006, a crossover between *Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo* (or *Kochikame*) and *Dragon Ball* by Toriyama and *Kochikame* author Osamu Akimoto appeared in the *Super Kochikame* (超こち亀, *Chō Kochikame*) manga.[55] That same year, Toriyama teamed up with Eiichiro Oda to create a crossover chapter of *Dragon Ball* and *One Piece* titled *Cross Epoch*.[56]\n\n\n\n### Reception[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Dragon Ball (manga) § Reception\n\nSee also: Weekly Shōnen Jump § Circulation figures\n\n  \n\n*Dragon Ball* is one of the most popular manga series of all time, and it continues to enjoy high readership today. *Dragon Ball* is credited as one of the main reasons manga circulation was at its highest between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s.[57][58] During *Dragon Ball*'s initial run in *Weekly Shōnen Jump*, the manga magazine reached an average circulation of 6.53 million weekly sales, the highest in its history.[57][58][59] During *Dragon Ball*'s serialisation between 1984 and 1995, *Weekly Shōnen Jump* magazine had a total circulation of over 2.9 billion copies,[60][e] with those issues generating an estimated ¥554 billion ($6.9 billion) in sales revenue.[e]\n\n\n*Dragon Ball* also sold a record number of collected *tankōbon* volumes for its time. By 2000, more than 126 million *tankōbon* copies had been sold in Japan alone.[61] It sold over 150 million copies in Japan by 2008, making it the best-selling manga ever at the time.[62] By 2012, its sales in Japan had grown to pass 156 million, making it the second best-selling *Weekly Shōnen Jump* manga of all time, behind *One Piece*.[63] *Dragon Ball*'s *tankobon* volumes sold 159.5 million copies in Japan by February 2014,[64] and have sold over 160 million copies in Japan as of 2016.[65]\n\n\nThe manga is similarly popular overseas, having been translated and released in over 40 countries worldwide.[66] The total number of *tankōbon* volumes sold have reached 350 million copies worldwide.[67][68][69][70][71] not including unofficial pirated copies; when including pirated copies, an estimated total of more than 400 million official and unofficial copies have been sold worldwide.[h][f][g]\n\n\nFor the 10th anniversary of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006, Japanese fans voted *Dragon Ball* the third greatest manga of all time.[72] In a survey conducted by Oricon in 2007 among 1,000 people, Son Goku, the main character of the franchise, ranked first place as the \"Strongest Manga Character of All Time.\"[73] Goku's journey and his ever-growing strength resulted in the character winning \"the admiration of young boys everywhere\".[16] Manga artists, such as *One Piece* creator Eiichiro Oda and *Naruto* creator Masashi Kishimoto, have stated that Goku inspired their series' main protagonists as well as series structure.[74][75]\n\n\nManga critic Jason Thompson stated in 2011 that \"*Dragon Ball* is by far the most influential shōnen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every *Shōnen Jump* artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways.\"[76] He says the series \"turns from a gag/adventure manga to an nearly-pure fighting manga\",[76] and its basic formula of \"lots of martial arts, lots of training sequences, a few jokes\" became the model for other shōnen series, such as *Naruto*.[77] Thompson also called Toriyama's art influential and cited it as a reason for the series' popularity.[76] James S. Yadao, author of *The Rough Guide to Manga*, claims that the first several chapters of *Dragon Ball* \"play out much like *Saiyuki* with *Dr. Slump*-like humour built in\" and that *Dr. Slump*, Toriyama's previous manga, has a clear early influence on the series.[78] He feels the series \"established its unique identity\" after the first occasion when Goku's group disbands and he trains under Kame-Sen'nin, when the story develops \"a far more action-packed, sinister tone\" with \"wilder\" battles with aerial and spiritual elements and an increased death count, while humor still makes an occasional appearance.[78] Yadao claims that an art shift occurs when the characters \"lose the rounded, innocent look that he established in *Dr. Slump* and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensity.\"[79]\n\n\n*Animerica* felt the series had \"worldwide appeal\", using dramatic pacing and over-the-top martial arts action to \"maintain tension levels and keep a crippler crossface hold on the audience's attention spans\".[80] In *Little Boy: The Art of Japan's Exploding Subculture*, Takashi Murakami commented that *Dragon Ball*'s \"never-ending cyclical narrative moves forward plausibly, seamlessly, and with great finesse.\"[61] Ridwan Khan from Animefringe.com commented that the manga had a \"chubby\" art style, but as the series continued the characters got more refined, leaner, and more muscular. Khan prefers the manga over the slow pacing of the anime counterparts.[81] Allen Divers of Anime News Network praised the story and humor of the manga as being very good at conveying all of the characters' personalities. Divers also called Viz's translation one of the best of all the English editions of the series due to its faithfulness to the original Japanese.[82] D. Aviva Rothschild of Rationalmagic.com remarked the first manga volume as \"a superior humor title\". They praised Goku's innocence and Bulma's insistence as one of the funniest parts of the series.[83]\n\n\nThe content of the manga has been controversial in the United States. In November 1999, Toys \"R\" Us removed Viz's *Dragon Ball* from their stores nationwide when a Dallas parent complained the series had \"borderline soft porn\" after he bought them for his four-year-old son.[84] Commenting on the issue, Susan J. Napier explained it as a difference in culture.[84] After the ban, Viz reluctantly began to censor the series to keep wide distribution.[85] However, in 2001, after releasing three volumes censored, Viz announced *Dragon Ball* would be uncensored and reprinted due to fan reactions.[85] In October 2009, Wicomico County Public Schools in Maryland banned the *Dragon Ball* manga from their school district because it \"depicts nudity, sexual contact between children and sexual innuendo among adults and children.\"[84]\n\n\n\n## Anime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Dragon Ball anime\n\nAdditionally, *Dragon Ball* is an anime television metaseries. *Dragon Ball* (1986-89), *Dragon Ball Z* (1989-96), and *Dragon Ball Super* (2015-18) are set in a uniform main continuity, while *Dragon Ball GT* (1996-97), and *Super Dragon Ball Heroes* (since 2018) explore several alternate continuities.\n\n\n\n### *Dragon Ball*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dragon Ball (TV series)\n\nFurther information: List of Dragon Ball episodes\n\nToei Animation produced an anime television series based on the first 194 manga chapters, also titled *Dragon Ball*. The series premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on February 26, 1986 and ran until April 19, 1989, lasting 153 episodes.[15] It is broadcast in 81 countries worldwide.[86]\n\n\n\n### *Dragon Ball Z*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dragon Ball Z\n\nFurther information: List of Dragon Ball Z episodes\n\nInstead of continuing the anime as *Dragon Ball*, Toei Animation decided to carry on with their adaptation under a new name and asked Akira Toriyama to come up with the title. *Dragon Ball Z* (ドラゴンボールZ(ゼット), *Doragon Bōru Zetto*, commonly abbreviated as *DBZ*) picks up five years after the first series left off and adapts the final 325 chapters of the manga. It premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on April 26, 1989, taking over its predecessor's time slot, and ran for 291 episodes until its conclusion on January 31, 1996.[15] Two television specials based on the *Z* series were aired on Fuji TV in Japan. The first, *The One True Final Battle ~The Z Warrior Who Challenged Frieza – Son Goku's Father~*, renamed *Bardock – The Father of Goku* by Funimation, was shown on October 17, 1990. The second special, *Defiance in the Face of Despair!! The Remaining Super-Warriors: Gohan and Trunks*, renamed *The History of Trunks* by Funimation, is based on a special chapter of the original manga and aired on February 24, 1993.\n\n\n\n### *Dragon Ball GT*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dragon Ball GT\n\nFurther information: List of Dragon Ball GT episodes\n\n*Dragon Ball GT* (ドラゴンボールGT(ジーティー), *Doragon Bōru Jī Tī*, *G(rand) T(ouring)*[87]) premiered on Fuji TV on February 7, 1996 and ran until November 19, 1997 for 64 episodes.[15] Unlike the first two anime series, it is not based on Akira Toriyama's original *Dragon Ball* manga,[88] being created by Toei Animation as a sequel to the series or as Toriyama called it, a \"grand side story of the original *Dragon Ball.*\"[87] Toriyama designed the main cast, the spaceship used in the show, the design of three planets, and came up with the title and logo. In addition to this, Toriyama also oversaw production of the series, just as he had for the *Dragon Ball* and *Dragon Ball Z* anime. The television special episode, *Goku's Side Story! The Proof of his Courage is the Four-Star Ball*, or *A Hero's Legacy* as Funimation titled it for their dub, aired on March 26, 1997, between episodes 41 and 42, serving as a kind of precursor to the epilogue to the series shown at the end of episode 64.\n\n\n\n### *Dragon Ball Z Kai*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Dragon Ball Z Kai episodes\n\nIn February 2009, *Dragon Ball Z* celebrated its 20th anniversary, with Toei Animation announcing that it would broadcast a re-edited and remastered version of the *Dragon Ball Z* anime under the name *Dragon Ball Kai* (ドラゴンボール改, *Doragon Bōru Kai*, lit. \"Dragon Ball Revised\"). The footage would be re-edited to follow the manga more closely, eliminating scenes and episodes which were not featured in the original manga, resulting in a more faithful adaptation, as well as in a faster-moving, and more focused story.[89] The episodes were remastered for HDTV, with rerecording of the vocal tracks by most of the original cast, and featuring updated opening and ending sequences. On April 5, 2009, the series premiered in Japan airing in Fuji TV.[90][91] *Dragon Ball Z Kai* reduced the episode count to 159 episodes (167 episodes internationally), from the original footage of 291 episodes. Damaged frames were removed, resulting in some minor shots being remade from scratch in order to fix cropping, and others to address continuity issues.[92] The majority of the international versions, including Funimation Entertainment's English dub, are titled *Dragon Ball Z Kai*.[93][94]\n\n\n\n### *Dragon Ball Super*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dragon Ball Super\n\nFurther information: List of Dragon Ball Super episodes\n\nOn April 28, 2015, Toei Animation announced *Dragon Ball Super* (ドラゴンボール超, *Doragon Bōru Sūpā*), the first all-new *Dragon Ball* television series to be released in 18 years. It debuted on July 5 and ran as a weekly series at 9:00 am on Fuji TV on Sundays until its series finale on March 25, 2018 after 131 episodes.[95] Masako Nozawa reprises her roles as Goku, Gohan, and Goten. Most of the original cast reprise their roles as well.[96][97] Koichi Yamadera and Masakazu Morita also reprise their roles, as Beerus and Whis, respectively.[97]\n\n\nThe story of the anime is set after the defeat of Majin Boo, when the Earth has become peaceful once again. Akira Toriyama is credited as the original creator, as well for \"original story & character design concepts.\"[98] It is also being adapted into a parallel manga.[99]\n\n\n\n### *Super Dragon Ball Heroes*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Super Dragon Ball Heroes (anime)\n\nFurther information: List of Super Dragon Ball Heroes episodes and Dragon Ball Heroes\n\nIn 2018, an anime to promote the *Super Dragon Ball Heroes* card and video game series was announced with a July 1 premiere.[100] The series' announcement included a brief synopsis:\n\n\n\n\n> Trunks returns from the future to train with Goku and Vegeta. However, he abruptly vanishes. The mysterious man \"Fu\" suddenly appears, telling them that Trunks has been locked up on the \"Prison Planet\", a mysterious facility in an unknown location between universes. The group searches for the Dragon Balls to free Trunks, but an unending super battle awaits them! Will Goku and the others manage to rescue Trunks and escape the Prison Planet?\n> \n> \n\n\n### Other installments[edit]\n\n\nThe short film *Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!* was created for the Jump Super Anime Tour,[101] which celebrated *Weekly Shōnen Jump*'s 40th anniversary, and debuted on September 21, 2008. A short animated adaptation of Naho Ōishi's Bardock spinoff manga, *Dragon Ball: Episode of Bardock*, was shown on December 17–18, 2011 at the Jump Festa 2012 event.[102]\n\n\nA two-episode original video animation (OVA) titled *Dragon Ball Z Side Story: Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans* was created in 1993 as strategy guides for the Famicom video game of the same name.[103] A remake titled *Dragon Ball: Plan to Eradicate the Super Saiyans* was created as a bonus feature for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game *Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2*, which was released on November 11, 2010.[104]\n\n\nA two-part hour-long crossover special between *Dragon Ball Z*, *One Piece* and *Toriko*, referred to as *Dream 9 Toriko & One Piece & Dragon Ball Z Super Collaboration Special!!* aired on April 7, 2013.[105]\n\n\n\n### Reception[edit]\n\n\nThe anime adaptations have also been very well-received and are better known in the Western world than the manga, with Anime News Network saying, \"Few anime series have mainstreamed it the way *Dragon Ball Z* has. To a certain generation of television consumers its characters are as well known as any in the animated realm, and for many it was the first step into the wilderness of anime fandom.\"[106] In a survey conducted by Oricon, \"Japanese anime that I think is world-class\" and \"world-class Manga & Anime\" \"Dragon Ball\" was selected as No. 1 with an overwhelming number of votes in both surveys[107][108].In 2000, satellite TV channel Animax together with *Brutus*, a men's lifestyle magazine, and Tsutaya, Japan's largest video rental chain, conducted a poll among 200,000 fans on the top anime series, with *Dragon Ball* coming in fourth.[109] \"Dragon Ball\" won first place in the \"100 Best Anime in Japan that has advanced to the world\" questionnaire on TV Asahi 's \" Decision! This is Japan's Best \".[110] TV Asahi conducted two polls in 2005 on the Top 100 Anime, *Dragon Ball* came in second in the nationwide survey conducted with multiple age-groups and in third in the online poll.[111][112]\n\n\n*Dragon Ball* is one of the most successful franchises in animation history.[113] The anime series is broadcast in more than 80 countries worldwide.[86] In Japan, the first sixteen anime films up until *Dragon Ball Z: Wrath of the Dragon* (1995) sold 50 million tickets and grossed over ¥40 billion ($501 million) at the box office, in addition to selling over 500,000 home video units, by 1996.[114][115] Later DVD releases of the *Dragon Ball* anime series have topped Japan's sales charts on several occasions.[116][117] In the United States, the anime series sold over 25 million DVD units by January 2012,[118] and has sold more than 30 million DVD and Blu-ray units as of 2017.[113] In Latin America, public screenings of the *Dragon Ball Super* finale in 2018 filled public spaces and stadiums in cities across the region, including stadiums holding tens of thousands of spectators.[119]\n\n\n*Dragon Ball Z* also proved to be a rating success in the United States, outperforming top shows such as *Friends* and *The X-Files* in some parts of the country in sweeps ratings during its first season.[120] The premiere of season three of *Dragon Ball Z* in 1999, done by Funimation's in-house dub, was the highest-rated program ever at the time on Cartoon Network.[121] In 2002, in the week ending September 22, *Dragon Ball Z* was the #1 program of the week on all of television with tweens 9-14, boys 9-14 and men 12-24, with the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday telecasts of *Dragon Ball Z* ranked as the top three programs in all of television, broadcast or cable, for delivery of boys 9-14.[122] Dragon ball GT has also had high ratings[123] In 2001, it was reported that the official website of *Dragon Ball Z* recorded 4.7 million hits per day and included 500,000+ registered fans.[124] Dragon Ball Z topped the Lycos 50 list of 'most searched' items for the second consecutive year -- the first time that any topic has ever been able to repeat its dominance over a two-year period.[125] Dragon Ball ranked second overall in the search number ranking for the past 10 years released by LYCOS in 2005.[126] and ranked 3rd in Yahoo! in 2002 with Playstation 2 topping the list[127] Even after it ended, the \"Dragon Ball\" series continues to maintain a high level of popularity, surpassing that of new anime, and is also often being rebroadcast, making the \"Dragon Ball\" series Funimation's most important anime license[128] The audience rating of the first Dragon ball Kai episode on Nicktoons is the highest since the station opened[129]\n\n\nCarl Kimlinger of Anime News Network summed up *Dragon Ball* as \"an action-packed tale told with rare humor and something even rarer—a genuine sense of adventure.\"[130] Both Kimlinger and colleague Theron Martin noted Funimation's reputation for drastic alterations of the script, but praised the dub.[130][131] However, some critics and most fans of the Japanese version have been more critical with Funimation's English dub and script of *Dragon Ball Z* over the years. Jeffrey Harris of IGN criticized the voices, including how Freeza's appearance combined with the feminine English voice left fans confused about Freeza's gender.[132] Carlos Ross of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews considered the series' characters to be different from stereotypical stock characters and noted that they undergo much more development.[133] Despite praising *Dragon Ball Z* for its cast of characters, they criticized it for having long and repetitive fights.[134]\n\n\n*Dragon Ball Z* is well-known, and often criticized, for its long, repetitive, dragged-out fights that span several episodes, with Martin commenting \"DBZ practically turned drawing out fights into an art form.\"[135] However, Jason Thompson of io9 explained that this comes from the fact that the anime was being created alongside the manga.[136] *Dragon Ball Z* was listed as the 78th best animated show in IGN's Top 100 Animated Series,[137] and was also listed as the 50th greatest cartoon in *Wizard* magazine's Top 100 Greatest Cartoons list.[138]\n\n\nHarris commented that *Dragon Ball GT* \"is downright repellent\", mentioning that the material and characters had lost their novelty and fun. He also criticized the *GT* character designs of Trunks and Vegeta as being goofy.[132] Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network also gave negative comments about *GT*, mentioning that the fights from the series were \"a very simple childish exercise\" and that many other anime were superior. The plot of *Dragon Ball GT* has also been criticized for giving a formula that was already used in its predecessors.[139]\n\n\n\n## Other media[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Dragon Ball films\n\n### Anime films[edit]\n\n\nTwenty animated theatrical films based on the *Dragon Ball* series have been released in Japan. The most recent films, *Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods* (2013), *Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F'* (2015), *Dragon Ball Super: Broly* (2018), and *Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero* (2022), were produced as full-length feature films and were given stand-alone theatrical releases in Japan (as well as limited theatrical releases in the U.S.). They've also been the first movies to have original creator Akira Toriyama deeply involved in their production; *Battle of Gods* and *Resurrection 'F'* were remade into the first and second arcs of the *Dragon Ball Super* anime, which told the same stories as the two films in expanded detail.[140][141] The 1996 feature film, *Dragon Ball: The Path to Power*, was also a full-length theatrical release with a running time of 80 minutes, and was produced to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the anime as a re-imagining of the first few arcs of the series.\n\n\nAll previous films were mostly below feature length (around 45–60 minutes each), making them only slightly longer than one or two episodes of the TV series; this is due to them being originally shown as back-to-back presentations alongside other Toei film productions. These films are also mostly alternate re-tellings of certain story arcs (like *The Path to Power*), or extra side-stories that do not correlate with the continuity of the series. The first three films, along with *The Path to Power*, are based on the original *Dragon Ball* anime series. The remaining thirteen older films are based on *Dragon Ball Z*. The first five films were shown at the Toei Manga Festival (東映まんがまつり, *Tōei Manga Matsuri*), while the sixth through seventeenth films were shown at the Toei Anime Fair (東映アニメフェア, *Toei Anime Fea*).\n\n\n\n### Live-action film[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dragonball Evolution\n\nAn American live-action film titled *Dragonball Evolution* was produced by 20th Century Fox after it acquired the feature film rights to the *Dragon Ball* franchise in March 2002. Previous to the film, two unofficial live-action films had been produced decades prior. The first was a Korean film titled *Dragon Ball: Ssawora Son Goku, Igyeora Son Goku* (드래곤볼 싸워라 손오공 이겨라 손오공; *Deulaegonbol Ssawola Son Ogong Igyeola Son Ogong*; lit. *Dragon Ball: Fight Son Goku, Win Son Goku*), while the second was a Taiwanese film titled *Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins* (新七龍珠; *Xīn qī lóng zhū*), which was also dubbed in English.[142][143] The film was directed by James Wong and produced by Stephen Chow, it was released in the United States on April 10, 2009.[143][144] The film was meant to lead into sequels,[145][146]\nwhich were cancelled, after the film flopped at the box office and became universally heralded as one of the worst adaptations of all time, being considered by the fans as being unfaithful to the source material.[147] Franchise creator Akira Toriyama also criticized the film adding he was completely left out of the creative process, despite having himself offered to help, going as far as saying: \"the result was a movie, I couldn't even call *Dragon Ball*\".[148] Years after its release, the writer of the film, Ben Ramsey, released a public apology in which he admitted to have written the film \"chasing for a payday\" instead of \"as a fan of the franchise\".[149][150]\n\n\nWith the news of 20th Century Fox selling itself, its assets; which include the film rights to the *Dragon Ball* franchise, will now be owned by its purchaser, The Walt Disney Company.[151] However, there have been no plans made by the Walt Disney Company to create a new live action Dragon Ball movie.[152]\n\n\n\n### Theme park attractions[edit]\n\n\n\"Dragon Ball Z: The Real 4D\" debuted at Universal Studios Japan in the summer of 2016. It features a battle between Goku and Freeza. Unlike most *Dragon Ball* animation, the attraction is animated with CGI. A second attraction titled \"Dragon Ball Z: The Real 4-D at Super Tenkaichi Budokai\" debuted at Universal Studios Japan in the summer of 2017, which featured a battle between the heroes and Broly.\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Dragon Ball video games\n\n![](image)A *Dragon Ball Z* arcade conversion kit that includes the PCB, instructions and operator's manual\nThe *Dragon Ball* franchise has spawned multiple video games across various genres and platforms. Earlier games of the series included a system of card battling and were released for the Famicom following the storyline of the series.[153] Starting with the Super Famicom and Mega Drive, most of the games were from the fighting genre or RPG (Role Playing Game), such as the *Super Butoden* series.[154] The first *Dragon Ball* game to be released in the United States was *Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout* for the PlayStation in 1997.[155] For the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable games the characters were redone in 3D cel-shaded graphics. These games included the *Dragon Ball Z: Budokai* series and the *Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi* series.[156][157] *Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit* was the first game of the franchise developed for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[158] *Dragon Ball Xenoverse* was the first game of the franchise developed for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.[159][160] A massively multiplayer online role-playing game called *Dragon Ball Online* was available in Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan until the servers were shut down in 2013.[161] A few years later fans started recreating the game. Today, \"Dragon Ball Online Global\" is a new, European version of *Dragon Ball Online* and it is being developed, while open beta server is running.[162]\n\n\nThe mobile game *Dragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle* (2015) has received over 350 million downloads worldwide, as of 2021[update].[163] A notable recent release is *Dragon Ball FighterZ* (2018), a fighting game developed by Arc System Works. The game received massive fan and critical acclaim for its fast paced frantic 3v3 battles and great visuals, also winning Best Fighting Game of 2018 at The Game Awards[164] and many other awards and other nominations. It also has a large eSports scene, where it is one of the most popular fighting games.[119] It also did very well commercially, selling 4 million units across all platforms.[165]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nIn 1994, the licensee Bandai earned $140 million annually from sales of licensed *Dragon Ball* toys, video games and other character goods in Japan.[166] In 1996, *Dragon Ball Z* grossed $2.95 billion in merchandise sales worldwide.[167] As of early 1996, more than 100 companies outside Japan applied for character goods.[168] Bandai sold over 2 billion *Dragon Ball* Carddass cards in Japan by 1998,[169] and over 1 million Dragon Stars action figures in the Americas and Europe as of 2018.[170] In 2000, Burger King sponsored a toy promotion to distribute 20 million *Dragon Ball Z* figures across North America.[171] By 2011, the franchise had generated $5 billion in merchandise sales.[172] In 2012, the franchise grossed ¥7.67 billion ($96.13 million) from licensed merchandise sales in Japan.[173]\n\n\n\n### Soundtracks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Dragon Ball soundtracks\n\nMyriad soundtracks were released in the anime, movies and the games. The music for the first two anime *Dragon Ball* and *Z* and its films was composed by Shunsuke Kikuchi, while the music from *GT* was composed by Akihito Tokunaga and the music from *Kai* was composed by Kenji Yamamoto and Norihito Sumitomo. For the first anime, the soundtracks released were *Dragon Ball: Music Collection* in 1985 and *Dragon Ball: Complete Song Collection* in 1991, although they were reissued in 2007 and 2003, respectively.[174] For the second anime, the soundtrack series released were *Dragon Ball Z Hit Song Collection Series*. It was produced and released by Columbia Records of Japan from July 21, 1989 to March 20, 1996 the show's entire lifespan. On September 20, 2006 Columbia re-released the Hit Song Collection on their Animex 1300 series.[175][176] Other CDs released are compilations, video games and films soundtracks as well as music from the English versions.[177]\n\n\n\n### Companion books[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cover of *Dragon Ball: The Complete Illustrations*\nThere have been numerous companion books to the *Dragon Ball* franchise. Chief among these are the *Daizenshuu* (大全集) series, comprising seven hardback main volumes and three supplemental softcover volumes, covering the manga and the first two anime series and their theatrical films. The first of these, *Dragon Ball: The Complete Illustrations* (*Daizenshuu* volume 1), first published in Japan in 1995, is the only one that was released in English, being printed in 2008 by Viz Media.[178] It contains all 264 colored illustrations Akira Toriyama drew for the *Weekly Shōnen Jump* magazines' covers, bonus giveaways and specials, and all the covers for the 42 *tankōbon*. It also includes an interview with Toriyama on his work process. The remainder have never been released in English, and all are now out of print in Japan. From February 4 to May 9, 2013, condensed versions of the *Daizenshuu* with some updated information were released as the four-volume *Chōzenshū* (超全集) series.[43] For *Dragon Ball GT*, the *Dragon Ball GT Perfect Files* were released in May and December 1997 by Shueisha's *Jump Comics Selection* imprint. They include series information, illustration galleries, behind-the-scenes information, and more. They were out of print for many years, but were re-released in April 2006 (accompanying the Japanese DVD release of *Dragon Ball GT*) and this edition is still in print.[179][180]\n\n\nCoinciding with the 34-volume *kanzenban* re-release of the manga, and the release of the entire series on DVD for the first time in Japan, four new guidebooks were released in 2003 and 2004. *Dragon Ball Landmark* and *Dragon Ball Forever* cover the manga, using volume numbers for story points that reference the *kanzenban* release,[181][182] while *Dragon Ball: Tenkaichi Densetsu* (ドラゴンボール 天下一伝説) and *Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku Densetsu* (ドラゴンボールZ 孫悟空伝説) cover the *Dragon Ball* and *Dragon Ball Z* anime, respectively.[183][184] Much of the material in these books is reused from the earlier *Daizenshuu* volumes, but they include new textual material including substantial interviews with the creator, cast and production staff of the series. *Son Goku Densetsu* in particular showcases previously-unpublished design sketches of Goku's father Bardock, drawn by character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru prior to creator Akira Toriyama's revisions that resulted in the final version.\n\n\nFollowing the release of *Dragon Ball Kai* in Japan, four new guidebooks were released: the two-volume *Dragon Ball: Super Exciting Guide* (ドラゴンボール 超エキサイティングガイド) in 2009, covering the manga,[185][186] and two-volume *Dragon Ball: Extreme Battle Collection* (ドラゴンボール　極限バトルコレクション) in 2010, covering the anime series.[187][188] Despite the TV series airing during this time being *Kai*, the *Extreme Battle Collection* books reference the earlier *Z* series in content and episode numbers. These books also include new question-and-answer sessions with Akira Toriyama, revealing a few new details about the world and characters of the series. 2010 also saw the release of a new artbook, *Dragon Ball: Anime Illustrations Guide – The Golden Warrior* (ドラゴンボール アニメイラスト集 「黄金の戦士」); a sort of anime-counterpart to the manga-oriented *Complete Illustrations*, it showcases anime-original illustrations and includes interviews with the three principal character designers for the anime. Each of the Japanese \"Dragon Box\" DVD releases of the series and movies, which were released from 2003 to 2006, as well as the Blu-ray boxed sets of *Dragon Ball Kai*, released 2009 to 2011, come with a *Dragon Book* guide that contains details about the content therein. Each also contains a new interview with a member of the cast or staff of the series. These books have been reproduced textually for Funimation's release of the *Dragon Ball Z* Dragon Box sets from 2009 to 2011.\n\n\n\n### Collectible cards[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Dragon Ball Collectible Card Game and Dragon Ball Z Collectible Card Game\n\nCollectible cards based on the *Dragon Ball*, *Dragon Ball Z*, and *Dragon Ball GT* series have been released by Bandai. These cards feature various scenes from the manga and anime stills, plus exclusive artwork from all three series. Bandai released the first set in the United States in July 2008.[189]\n\n\n\n### Tabletop role-playing game[edit]\n\n\n*Dragon Ball Z: The Anime Adventure Game*, a tabletop role-playing game produced by R. Talsorian Games, was published in 1999.[190][191]\n\n\n\n## Cultural impact[edit]\n\n\nSince its debut, *Dragon Ball* has had a considerable impact on global popular culture.[119][192] In 2015, the Japan Anniversary Association officially declared May 9 as \"Goku Day\" (悟空の日, *Gokū no Hi*); in Japanese, the numbers five and nine can be pronounced as \"Go\" and \"Ku\".[193] It is similarly influential in international popular culture across other parts of the world.[119] In the Philippines, a children's musical titled *Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z: Myth, Magic, Music*, was staged in June 1996.[194] *Dragon Ball* is widely referenced in American popular culture, from television and music to celebrities and athletes, and the show has been celebrated with Goku making an appearance at the 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parades, and with *Dragon Ball* murals appearing in cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, Kansas City and Denver.[192]\n\n\n*Dragon Ball* is also immensely popular in other regions of the world, such as Latin America, where public screenings of the *Dragon Ball Super* finale in 2018 filled public spaces and stadiums in cities across the region, including stadiums holding tens of thousands of spectators.[119] *Dragon Ball* creator Akira Toriyama was decorated a *Chevalier* or \"Knight\" of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government in May 2019 for his contributions to the arts, particularly for *Dragon Ball* which has been credited with popularizing manga in France.[195][196]\n\n\nVegeta's quote \"It's Over 9000!\" from the Saiyan Saga in the English dub of *Dragon Ball Z* is a popular Internet meme.[197] Goku has been identified as a superhero,[198][199] as well as Gohan with his Great Saiyaman persona.[200] Motorola's Freescale DragonBall and DragonBall EZ/VZ microcontroller processors, released in 1995, are named after *Dragon Ball* and *Dragon Ball Z*, respectively.[201]\n\n\n\n### Comics and animation[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Dragon Ball (manga) § Legacy and cultural impact\n\n*Dragon Ball* has been cited as inspiration across various different media. *Dragon Ball* is credited with setting trends for popular shōnen manga and anime since the 1980s, with manga critic Jason Thompson in 2011 calling it \"by far the most influential shōnen manga of the last 30 years.\" Successful shōnen manga authors such as Eiichiro Oda (*One Piece*), Masashi Kishimoto (*Naruto*), Tite Kubo (*Bleach*), Hiro Mashima (*Fairy Tail*) and Kentaro Yabuki (*Black Cat*) have cited *Dragon Ball* as an influence on their own now popular works. According to Thompson, \"almost every *Shōnen Jump* artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways.\"[76]\n\n\nIan Jones-Quartey, a producer of the American animated series *Steven Universe*, is a fan of *Dragon Ball* and *Dr. Slump*, and uses Toriyama's vehicle designs as a reference for his own. He also stated that \"We're all big Toriyama fans on [*Steven Universe*], which kind of shows a bit.\"[202] Comic book artist André Lima Araújo cited *Dragon Ball*, along with several other manga and anime, as a major influence on his work, which includes Marvel comics such as *Age of Ultron*, *Avengers A.I.*, *Spider-Verse* and *The Inhumans*.[203] Filipino comic artist Dexter Soy, who has worked on Marvel and DC comics such as *Captain America*, cited *Dragon Ball* as a major inspiration.[204] *Tony Stark: Iron Man* #11 (2019) makes references to *Dragon Ball Z*, including Miles Morales as Spider-Man referencing the Super Saiyan transformation.[205]\n\n\n\n### Film and television[edit]\n\n\nIn December 1990, an unofficial live-action Korean film adaptation *Dragon Ball: Ssawora Son Goku, Igyeora Son Goku* was released.[206][207] Another unofficial live-action film adaptation of the series, *Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins*, was released in Taiwan in November 1991,[15] and was later released in 2007 as an \"Ultimate Edition,\" with new effects added à la *Star Wars*.\n\n\nAction film star Jackie Chan is a fan of the franchise, and said Goku is his favorite *Dragon Ball* character. In 1995, Chan had expressed some interest in adapting *Dragon Ball* into a film, but said it would require \"a lot of amazing special effects and an enormous budget.\"[208] Later in 2013, Toriyama said his ideal live-action Goku would have been a young Jackie Chan, stating that \"nobody could play Goku but him.\"[209]\n\n\n*The Matrix* franchise echoes *Dragon Ball Z* in several action scenes, including the climactic fights of the 2003 films *The Matrix Reloaded* and *The Matrix Revolutions*.[210] Filipino-American film storyboard artist Jay Oliva has cited *Dragon Ball* as a major inspiration on his work, particularly the action scenes of 2013 Superman film *Man of Steel*, which launched the DC Extended Universe.[211] Several films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have also been visually influenced by *Dragon Ball Z*. Erik Killmonger's battle armour in *Black Panther* (2018) bears a resemblance to Vegeta's battle armour,[212][213] which actor Michael B. Jordan (himself a *Dragon Ball* fan) said may have inspired Killmonger's battle armor.[214] The fiery look of Carol Danvers' Binary powers in *Captain Marvel* (2019) also drew some influence from *Dragon Ball Z*.[215] In *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* (2021), Katy refers to one of Shang-Chi's techniques as a \"*Kamehameha* fireball\";[216] the film's director Destin Daniel Cretton cited *Dragon Ball Z* as an inspiration behind the film's climactic fight scene.[217]\n\n\nA key characteristic that set *Dragon Ball Z* (and later other anime shows) apart from American television shows at the time was a serialization format, where a continuous story arc stretches over multiple episodes or seasons. Traditional American television had an episodic format, with each episode typically consisting of a self-contained story, whereas *Dragon Ball Z* and later anime shows had a serialization format where continuous story arcs stretch over multiple episodes or seasons. Serialization has since also become a common characteristic of American streaming television shows during the \"Peak TV\" era.[218]\n\n\n\n### Music and sports[edit]\n\n\n*Dragon Ball* has been channeled and referenced by numerous musicians. It is popular in the hip hop community, and has been referenced in numerous hip hop songs by rappers and artists such as Chris Brown, Chance the Rapper, Big Sean, Lil Uzi Vert, G-Mo Skee, The Weeknd, Childish Gambino,[192] Denzel Curry, Thundercat, B.o.B, Soulja Boy,[219] Drake,[220] Frank Ocean, and Sese.[221] Mark Sammut of *TheGamer* notes that Gohan occasionally performs the dab move (as the Great Saiyaman), decades before it became a popular hip-hop dance move in American popular culture.[222]\n\n\nNumerous athletes have also channeled and referenced *Dragon Ball*, including NBA basketball players such as Sacramento Kings guard De'Aaron Fox, Chicago Bulls forward Lauri Markkanen, Golden State Warriors player Jordan Bell, and Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball, American football NFL stars such as Cleveland Browns players Darren Fells and David Njoku, mixed martial artist Ronda Rousey,[192] and WWE wrestlers such as The New Day.[223][224] Japanese kickboxer Panchan Rina took her nickname from the *Dragon Ball* character Pan.[225] Japanese mixed martial artist Itsuki Hirata is nicknamed \"Android 18\" due to her resembling the *Dragon Ball* character.[226] Canadian mixed martial artist Carlos Newton dubbed his fighting style \"Dragon Ball jiu-jitsu\" in tribute to the series.[227] Other mixed martial artists inspired by *Dragon Ball* include Kana Watanabe, Yushin Okami, Yoshihiro Akiyama and Yuya Wakamatsu.[228][229] The French group Yamakasi cited *Dragon Ball* as an influence on their development of parkour, inspired by how the heroes attain extraordinary abilities through hard work.[230]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nThe producer of the *Tekken* video game series, Katsuhiro Harada, said that *Dragon Ball* was one of the first works to visually depict chi and thereby influenced numerous Japanese video games, especially fighting games such as *Tekken* and *Street Fighter*.[231] Masaaki Ishikawa, art director of the video game *Arms*, said that its art style was largely influenced by *Dragon Ball* and *Akira*.[232] French video game designer Éric Chahi also cited *Dragon Ball* as an influence on his 1991 cinematic platformer *Another World*.[233] Other video game industry veterans who were inspired by *Dragon Ball* include Suda51, SWERY, Insomniac Games, Nina Freeman, Heart Machine, Iron Galaxy, and Mega64.[231]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Other sources estimate the total *Dragon Ball* tankōbon sales worldwide to be 260 or 300 million copies.[6][7][8][9][10] See *Dragon Ball (manga) § Reception* for worldwide sales breakdown.\n2. **^** See *Weekly Shōnen Jump § Manga series*\n3. **^** In addition to tankōbon sales, *Dragon Ball* had a total estimated circulation of approximately 2.96 billion copies in *Weekly Shōnen Jump* magazine.[b]\n4. **^** Originally there were eighteen universes, but six of them were since erased by Zeno, a supreme deity.\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** See *Weekly Shōnen Jump § Circulation figures*\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Cite error: The named reference `China` was invoked but never defined (see the help page).\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Cite error: The named reference `Korea` was invoked but never defined (see the help page).\n8. **^** Tally does not include unofficial pirated copies.

It has been serialized in Shueisha's *shōnen* manga magazine *Weekly Shōnen Jump* since July 1997, with its individual chapters compiled into 107 *tankōbon* volumes as of November 2023[update]. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, where he explores the Grand Line in search of the mythical treasure known as the \"One Piece\" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.\n\n\nThe manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film by Production I.G, and an anime series by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated feature films, one original video animation, and thirteen television specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and numerous video games. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an English-language release in North America in 2004 before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007.\n\n\n*One Piece* has received praise for its storytelling, world-building, art, characterization, and humor. It has received many awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time. By August 2022, it had over 516.6 million copies in circulation in 61 countries and regions worldwide, making it the best-selling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic series printed in book volume. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015 and 2022, *One Piece* set the *Guinness World Record* for \"the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\". It was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the only that had achieved more than 1 million copies sold in all of its over 100 published *tankōbon* volumes. *One Piece* is the only manga whose volumes have ranked first every year in Oricon's weekly comic chart existence since 2008.\n\n\n\n\n## Synopsis[edit]\n\n\n### Setting[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *One Piece* characters\n\n![](image)The globe of the *One Piece* world\nThe world of *One Piece* is populated by humans and other races such as dwarves (more akin to faeries in size), giants, merfolk, fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked people known as the Snakeneck Tribe, and animal people (known as \"Minks\"). The world is governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World Government, consisting of dozens of member countries. The Navy is the sea military branch of the World Government that protects the known seas from pirates and other criminals. There is also Cipher Pol which is a group of agencies within the World Government that are their secret police. While pirates are major opponents against the Government, the ones who really challenge their rule are the Revolutionary Army who seeks to overthrow them. The central tension of the series pits the World Government and their forces against pirates. The series regularly emphasizes moral ambiguity over the label \"pirate\", which includes cruel villains, but also any individuals that do not submit to the World Government's authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—rule. The *One Piece* world also has supernormal characteristics like Devil Fruits,[Jp 1] which are mysterious fruits that grant whoever eats them transformative powers. Another supernatural power is Haki,[Jp 2] which grants its users enhanced willpower, observation, and fighting abilities, and it is one of the only effective methods of inflicting bodily harm on certain Devil Fruit users.\n\n\nThe world itself consists of two vast oceans divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line.[Jp 3] Within the oceans is a second global phenomenon known as the Grand Line,[Jp 4] which is a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line and is bounded by the Calm Belt,[Jp 5] strips of calm ocean infested with huge ship-eating monsters known as Sea Kings.[Jp 6] These geographical barriers divide the world into four seas: North Blue,[Jp 7] East Blue,[Jp 8] West Blue,[Jp 9] and South Blue.[Jp 10] Passage between the four seas, and the Grand Line, is therefore difficult. Unique and mystical features enable transport between the seas, such as the use of Sea Prism Stone[Jp 11] employed by government ships to mask their presence as they traverse the Calm Belt, or the Reverse Mountain[Jp 12] where water from the four seas flows uphill before merging into a rapidly flowing and dangerous canal that enters the Grand Line. The Grand Line itself is split into two separate halves with the Red Line between being Paradise[Jp 13] and the New World.[Jp 14]\n\n\n\n### Premise[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of *One Piece* chapters\n\nThe series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy—a young man made of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit—who sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger's ultimate treasure known as the \"One Piece\", and take over his prior title. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates,[Jp 15] Luffy rescues and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the titular treasure. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a money-obsessed thief and navigator; Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, an amorous but chivalrous cook. They acquire a ship, the *Going Merry*[Jp 16]—later replaced by the *Thousand Sunny*[Jp 17]—and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphized reindeer doctor; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former Baroque Works assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeleton musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a whale shark-type fish-man and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea who becomes their helmsman. Together, they encounter other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents, different types of scientists, soldiers of the morally-ambiguous World Government, and various other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Concept and creation[edit]\n\n\nEiichiro Oda's interest in pirates began in his childhood, watching the animated series *Vicky the Viking*, which inspired him to want to draw a manga series about pirates.[2] The reading of pirate biographies influenced Oda to incorporate the characteristics of real-life pirates into many of the characters in *One Piece*; for example, the character Marshall D. Teach is based on and named after the historical pirate Edward \"Blackbeard\" Teach.[3] Apart from the history of piracy, Oda's biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series *Dragon Ball*, which is one of his favorite manga.[4] He was also inspired by *The Wizard of Oz*, claiming not to endure stories where the reward of adventure is the adventure itself, opting for a story where travel is important, but even more important is the goal.[5]\n\n\nWhile working as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki, Oda began writing *One Piece* in 1996.[6] It started as two one-shot stories entitled *Romance Dawn*[6]—which would later be used as the title for *One Piece*'s first chapter and volume. They both featured the character of Luffy, and included elements that would appear later in the main series. The first of these short stories was published in August 1996 in *Akamaru Jump* and later in *One Piece Red*. The second was published in the 41st issue of *Weekly Shōnen Jump* in 1996, and reprinted in 1998 in Oda's short story collection, *Wanted!*.[7] In an interview with TBS, Takanori Asada, the original editor of *One Piece*, revealed that the manga was rejected by *Weekly Shōnen Jump* three times before Shueisha agreed to publish the series.[8]\n\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nWhen creating the Devil Fruit, Oda thinks of something that would fulfill a human desire; he added that he does not see why he would draw a Devil Fruit unless the fruit's appearance would entice one to eat it.[9] The names of many special attacks, as well as other concepts in the manga, consist of a form of punning in which phrases written in *kanji* are paired with an idiosyncratic reading. The names of some characters' techniques are often mixed with other languages, and the names of several of Zoro's sword techniques are designed as jokes; they look fearsome when read by sight but sound like kinds of food when read aloud. For example, Zoro's signature move is *Onigiri*, which is written as *demon cut* but is pronounced the same as *rice ball* in Japanese. Eisaku Inoue, the animation director, has said that the creators did not use these *kanji* readings in the anime since they \"might have cut down the laughs by about half\".[10] Nevertheless, Konosuke Uda, the director, said that he believes that the creators \"made the anime pretty close to the manga\".[10]\n\n\nOda was \"sensitive\" about how his work would be translated.[11] In many instances, the English version of the *One Piece* manga uses one onomatopoeia for multiple onomatopoeia used in the Japanese version. For instance, \"*saaa*\" (the sound of light rain, close to a mist) and \"*zaaa*\" (the sound of pouring rain) are both translated as \"fshhhhhhh\".[12] Unlike other manga artists, Oda draws everything that moves himself to create a consistent look while leaving his staff to draw the backgrounds based on sketches he has drawn.[13] This workload forces him to keep tight production rates, starting from five in the morning until two in the morning the next day, with short breaks only for meals. Oda's work program includes the first three days of the week dedicated to the writing of the storyboard and the remaining time for the definitive inking of the boards and for the possible coloring.[14] When a reader asked who Nami was in love with, Oda replied that there would hardly be any love affairs within Luffy's crew. The author also explained he deliberately avoids including them in *One Piece* since the series is a shōnen manga and the boys who read it are not interested in love stories.[15]\n\n\n\n### Conclusion[edit]\n\n\nOda revealed that he originally planned *One Piece* to last five years, and that he had already planned the ending. However, he found it would take longer than he had expected as Oda realized that he liked the story too much to end it in that period of time.[16] In 2016, nineteen years after the start of serialization, the author said that the manga has reached 65% of the story he intends to tell.[17] In July 2018, on the occasion of the twenty-first anniversary of *One Piece*, Oda said that the manga has reached 80% of the plot,[18] while in January 2019, he said that *One Piece* is on its way to the conclusion, but that it could exceed the 100th volume.[19] In August 2019, Oda said that, according to his predictions, the manga will end between 2024 and 2025.[20] However, Oda stated that the ending would be what he had decided in the beginning; he is committed to seeing it through.[21] In a television special aired in Japan, Oda said he would be willing to change the ending if the fans were to be able to predict it.[5] In August 2020, Shueisha announced in the year's 35th issue of *Weekly Shōnen Jump* that *One Piece* was \"headed toward the upcoming final saga.\"[22] On January 4, 2021, *One Piece* reached its thousandth chapter.[23][24][25] In June 2022, Oda announced that the manga would enter a one-month break to prepare for its 25th anniversary and its final saga, set to begin with the release of chapter 1054.[26]\n\n\n\n## Publication[edit]\n\n\n### Main series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *One Piece* manga volumes\n\nWritten and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda, *One Piece* has been serialized by Shueisha in the *shōnen* manga anthology *Weekly Shōnen Jump* since July 22, 1997.[27][28] Shueisha has collected its chapters into individual *tankōbon* volumes. The first volume was released on December 24, 1997.[29] By November 2, 2023, a total of 107 volumes have been released.[30]\n\n\nThe first English translation of *One Piece* was released by Viz Media in November 2002, who published its chapters in the manga anthology *Shonen Jump*, and later collected in volumes since June 30, 2003.[31][32][33] In 2009, Viz announced the release of five volumes per month during the first half of 2010 to catch up with the serialization in Japan.[34] Following the discontinuation of the print *Shonen Jump*, Viz began releasing *One Piece* chapterwise in its digital successor *Weekly Shonen Jump* on January 30, 2012.[35] Following the digital *Weekly Shonen Jump'*s cancelation in December 2018, Viz Media started simultaneously publishing *One Piece* through its *Shonen Jump* service, and by Shueisha through *Manga Plus*, in January 2019.[36][37]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the volumes were published by Gollancz Manga, starting in March 2006,[38] until Viz Media took it over after the fourteenth volume.[39][40] In Australia and New Zealand, the English volumes have been distributed by Madman Entertainment since November 10, 2008.[41] In Poland, Japonica Polonica Fantastica is publishing the manga,[42] Glénat in France,[43] Panini Comics in Mexico,[44] LARP Editores and later by Ivrea in Argentina,[45][46] Planeta de Libros in Spain,[47] Edizioni Star Comics in Italy,[48] and Sangatsu Manga in Finland.[49]\n\n\n\n### Spin-offs and crossovers[edit]\n\n\nOda teamed up with Akira Toriyama to create a single crossover of *One Piece* and Toriyama's *Dragon Ball*. Entitled *Cross Epoch*, the one-shot was published in the December 25, 2006, issue of *Weekly Shōnen Jump* and the April 2011 issue of the English *Shonen Jump*.[50] Oda collaborated with Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro, author of *Toriko*, for a crossover one-shot of their series titled *Taste of the Devil Fruit* (実食! 悪魔の実!!, *Jitsushoku! Akuma no Mi!!*, lit. \"The True Food! Devil Fruit!!\"),[51] which ran in the April 4, 2011, issue of *Weekly Shōnen Jump*. The spin-off series *One Piece Party* (ワンピースパーティー, *Wan Pīsu Pātī*), written by Ei Andō in a super deformed art style, began serialization in the January 2015 issue of *Saikyō Jump*.[52] Its final chapter was published on *Shōnen Jump+* on February 2, 2021.[53]\n\n\n\n## Related media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of *One Piece* media\n\n### Anime[edit]\n\n\n#### Festival films and original video animation[edit]\n\n\n*One Piece: Defeat Him! The Pirate Ganzack!* was produced by Production I.G for the 1998 Jump Super Anime Tour and was directed by Gorō Taniguchi.[54] Luffy, Nami, and Zoro are attacked by a sea monster that destroys their boat and separates them. Luffy is found on an island beach, where he saves a little girl, Medaka, from two pirates. All the villagers, including Medaka's father have been abducted by Ganzack and his crew and forced into labor. After hearing that Ganzack also stole all the food, Luffy and Zoro rush out to retrieve it. As they fight the pirates, one of them kidnaps Medaka. A fight starts between Luffy and Ganzack, ending with Luffy's capture. Meanwhile, Zoro is forced to give up after a threat is made to kill all the villagers. They rise up against Ganzack, and while the islanders and pirates fight, Nami unlocks the three captives. Ganzack defeats the rebellion and reveals his armored battleship. The Straw Hat Pirates are forced to fight Ganzack once more to prevent him from destroying the island.\n\n\nA second film, *One Piece: Romance Dawn Story*, was produced by Toei Animation in July 2008 for the Jump Super Anime Tour. It is 34 minutes in length and based on the first version of *Romance Dawn*.[55][7] It includes the Straw Hat Pirates up to Brook and their second ship, the *Thousand Sunny*. In search for food for his crew, Luffy arrives at a port after defeating a pirate named Crescent Moon Gally on the way. There he meets a girl named Silk, who was abandoned by attacking pirates as a baby and raised by the mayor. Her upbringing causes her to value the town as her \"treasure\". The villagers mistake Luffy for Gally and capture him just as the real Gally returns. Gally throws Luffy in the water and plans to destroy the town, but Silk saves him and Luffy pursues Gally. His crew arrives to help him, and with their help he recovers the treasure for the town, acquires food, and destroys Gally's ship. The film was later released as a triple feature DVD with *Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!* and *Tegami Bachi: Light and Blue Night*, that was available only though a mail-in offer exclusively to Japanese residents.[56]\n\n\nThe *One Piece Film Strong World: Episode 0* original video animation adapts the manga's special \"Chapter 0\", which shows how things were before and after the death of Roger. It received a limited release of three thousand DVDs as a collaboration with the House Foods brand.[57]\n\n\n\n#### TV series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *One Piece* (TV series)\n\nAn anime television series adaptation, produced by Toei Animation, premiered on Fuji TV on October 20, 1999;[58] the series reached its 1,000th episode in November 2021.[59]\n\n\n\n#### Theatrical films[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *One Piece* films\n\nFourteen animated theatrical films based on the *One Piece* series have been released. The films are typically released in March to coincide with the spring vacation of Japanese schools.[60] The films feature self-contained, completely original plots, or alternate retellings of story arcs with animation of a higher quality than what the weekly anime allows. The first three films were typically double features paired up with other anime films, and were thus, usually an hour or less in length. The films themselves offer contradictions in both chronology and design that make them incompatible with a single continuity. Funimation has licensed the eighth, tenth, and twelfth films for release in North America, and these films have received in-house dubs by the company.[61][62]\n\n\n\n### Live-action series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *One Piece* (2023 TV series)\n\nOn July 21, 2017, *Weekly Shōnen Jump* editor-in-chief Hiroyuki Nakano announced that Tomorrow Studios (a partnership between Marty Adelstein and ITV Studios) and Shueisha would commence production of an American live-action television adaptation of Eiichiro Oda's *One Piece* manga series as part of the series' 20th anniversary celebrations.[63][64] Eiichiro Oda will serve as executive producer for the series alongside Tomorrow Studios CEO Adelstein and Becky Clements.[64] The series will reportedly begin with the East Blue arc.[65]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Oda revealed that Netflix ordered a first season consisting of ten episodes.[66] On May 19, 2020, producer Marty Adelstein revealed during an interview with SyFy Wire, that the series was originally set to begin filming in Cape Town sometime around August, but has since been delayed to around September due to COVID-19. He also revealed that, during the same interview, all ten scripts had been written for the series and they were set to begin casting sometime in June.[67] However, executive producer Matt Owens stated in September 2020 that casting had not yet commenced.[68] On September 15, 2023, Oda revealed that the show has been renewed for the second season.[69]\n\n\nIn March 2021, production started up again with showrunner Steven Maeda revealing that the series codename is *Project Roger*.[70] In November 2021, it was announced that the casting for the series includes Iñaki Godoy as Monkey D.

In 2009, the 56th volume had a print run of 2.85 million, the highest initial print run of any manga by then.[141] The 57th volume had a print run of 3 million in 2010,[142] a record that was broken several times by subsequent volumes. The 60th volume had a first print run of 3.4 million and was the first book to sell over two million copies in its opening week on Oricon book rankings,[143][144] and later became the first book to sell over three million copies in Oricon's history.[145] In 2012, the 67th volume had an initial print run of 4.05 million, holding the record of the volume with the highest number of copies in the first print.[146] *One Piece* is the only manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than ten years.[147] In May 2023, it was reported that each of the 105 volumes, published by then, had sold over 1 million copies.[148] Additionally, *One Piece* is the only work whose volumes have ranked first every year in Oricon's weekly comic chart existence since 2008.[149][150]\n\n\n*One Piece* has also sold well in North America, charting on *Publishers Weekly*'s list of best-selling comics for April/May 2007 and numerous times on *The New York Times* Manga Best Seller list.[151][152][153] On *ICv2*'s list of Top 25 Manga Properties Fall 2008 for North America, which is compiled by interviews with retailers and distributors, Nielsen BookScan's Top 20 Lists of graphic novels and *ICv2*'s own analysis of information provided by Diamond Comic Distributors, *One Piece* came in fifteenth place.[154] It rose to second place on their Top 25 Manga Properties Q3 2010 list.[155] By August 2022, the manga has sold 2.9 million copies in print in North America (including single volumes and omnibus editions).[156]\n\n\nIn France, *One Piece* has been the best-selling manga since 2011,[157] with over 31.80 million copies sold by August 2022.[158] The manga is very popular in the country, where its sales alone represent 8.5% of the French manga market by 2021.[159] The first volume had sold more than 1 million copies in France by July 2021.[160] The 100th volume had one of the biggest initial prints ever for a manga in the French market, selling 131,270 copies in just three days, the best-selling manga volume in a week in the country.[161][162] The manga sold 6,011,536 copies in 2021.[163] This amount represents almost 20% of the total sales in the country; almost one in five volumes of the series was sold in the year.[164]\n\n\nIn Italy, *One Piece* had 18 million copies in circulation by April 2021.[165] which represents around 22.5% of the series market outside Japan.[166] In September 2021, the limited edition of the ninety-eighth volume ranked first in the best-selling books weekly ranking, making it the first time that a manga reaches that achievement.[167]\n\n\nIn Germany, *One Piece* is the second best-selling manga behind *Dragon Ball*. The manga had sold 6.7 million copies in the country.[168]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nAllen Divers of *Anime News Network* comments in 2003 that the art style *One Piece* employs \"initially seems very cartoonish with much of the character designs showing more North American influence than that from its Japanese origins\", adding that the \"artwork and settings come across as timeless in their presentation\". He also notes that the influence of Akira Toriyama (*Dragon Ball*) shines through in Oda's style of writing with its \"huge epic battles punctuated by a lot of humor\" and that, in *One Piece*, he \"manages to share a rich tale without getting bogged down by overly complicated plots\".[169] Rebecca Silverman of the same site stated that one of the series' strengths is to \"blend action, humor, and heavy fare together\" and praised the art, but stated that the panels could get too crowded for easy reading.[170] The website *activeAnime* describes the artwork in *One Piece* as \"wonderfully quirky and full of expression\".[171] Mario Vuk from *Splash Comics* commented that Oda's \"pleasantly bright and dynamic\" art style suits the story's \"funny and exciting\" atmosphere.[172] Isaiah Colbert of *Kotaku* called *One Piece* a \"masterpiece\", highlighting Oda's character writing, world-building and the balance between \"fun and serious subject matter\".[173] Dale Bashir of IGN wrote that *One Piece* is more about the world-building, adventuring, and the meaning of freedom instead of the \"usual shonen battling\" from series like *Dragon Ball* and *Naruto*. Bashir concluded: \"While not everyone would want to go so far for a franchise that isn't even finished yet, trust me when I say that it is definitely worth it.\"[174]\n\n\nEX Media lauds Oda's art for its \"crispy\" monochrome pictures, \"great use of subtle shade changes\" on color pages, \"sometimes exquisite\" use of angles, and for its consistency.[175] Shaenon K. Garrity, who at some point edited the series for English *Shonen Jump*, said that, while doing so, her amazement over Oda's craft grew steadily. She states that \"he has a natural, playful mastery of the often restrictive weekly-manga format,\" notes that \"interesting things [are] going on deep in the narrative structure,\" and recommends \"sticking through to the later volumes to see just how crazy and Peter Max-y the art gets\".[176] Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine commented: \"*One Piece* is a fun adventure story, with an ensemble cast that is continuing to develop, with great action and character drama.\" He praised Oda's artwork as \"imaginative and creative\" and commented that \"Oda's imagination just oozes all of the panels [*sic*]\". He also noted that \"Oda's panel work [...] features a lot of interesting perspectives and direction, especially during the explosive action sequences which are always a blast\".[177]\n\n\nIn March 2021, *Mobile Suit Gundam*'s creator, Yoshiyuki Tomino, said in his interview that *One Piece* is the \"only manga to trust\". He praised the manga, commenting: \"Still, we are working in the same studio and I saw storyboards near the photocopier. Unlike mine, those storyboards are good. But, you know, among the popular manga there is manga with very beautiful art and manga with bad art, but interesting nonetheless. And I don't trust manga with very beautiful art unless it is *One Piece*.[178]\n\n\nAfter the release of the hundredth volume, *Weekly Shonen Jump*'s editor-in-chief, Hiroyuki Nakano, explained how *One Piece* changed the history of manga and the way of making it. Nakano said that *Weekly Shonen Jump* is \"a game of weekly popularity\", and before *One Piece*, he aimed for something \"interesting this week without thinking about the next\"; however, the series reached overwhelming popularity due to its style that involves a story concept and detailed hints, adding that the series had a huge impact on other series. Nakano lauded Oda for his \"overwhelming passion, talent and power\" and his \"unwavering will\" to deliver a story to boys and girls, adding that he goes far beyond the reader's expectations, with the belief in \"don't fool the reader\" and \"there is something interesting ahead of it\".[179]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nThe brand made more than $1 billion in retail sales in Japan by 2004.[180][181]\n\n\n\n### Awards and accolades[edit]\n\n\n*One Piece* was nominated for the 23rd Kodansha Manga Award in the *shōnen* category in 1999.[182] It was a finalist for the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize three times in a row from 2000 to 2002,[183][184][185] with the highest number of fan nominations in the first two years.[186] The manga was nominated for Favorite Manga Series in *Nickelodeon Magazine*'s 2009 Comics Awards.[187] In 2012, the series won the 41st Japan Cartoonists Association Award Grand Prize, alongside Kimuchi Yokoyama's *Neko Darake*.[188] In 2014, the series received the 18th Yomiuri Advertising Award's Golden Medal.[189] It also won the 34th Newspaper Advertising Award in the Advertising category[190] and the 67th Advertising Dentsu Award in Newspaper Advertising Planning category.[191]\n\n\nThe forty-sixth volume of *One Piece* was the best manga of 2007, according to the Oricon's Japanese Book of the Year Action Committee.[192] The series was chosen as one of the best continuing manga for all ages/teens in 2011 by critics from About.com, Anime News Network, and ComicsAlliance.[193] The series has ranked on the \"Book of the Year\" list from Media Factory's *Da Vinci* magazine, where professional book reviewers, bookstore employees, and *Da Vinci* readers participate; it ranked fifth in 2011;[194] second in 2012;[195] third in 2013;[196] second in 2014, 2015 and 2016;[197][198][199] third in 2017 and 2018;[200][201] second in 2019;[202] third in 2020 and 2021;[203][204] and second in 2022.[205] It ranked eighth in the 2023 edition of Takarajimasha's *Kono Manga ga Sugoi!* list of best manga for male readers.[206]\n\n\nThe German translation of the manga won the Sondermann Award in the international manga category in 2005. The series received the award for the forty-fourth volume in 2008[207] and the forty-eighth volume in 2009.[208] *One Piece* won the *AnimeLand*'s Anime & Manga 19th Grand Prix for the \"Best Classic Shōnen\" category in 2012.[209][210]\n\n\nIn a poll conducted by Oricon in 2008 about \"the most moving (touching) manga ever\", *One Piece* ranked first in both male and female categories.[211] In another 2008 poll by Oricon, Japanese teenagers voted it the most interesting manga.[212] On Tencent's anime and manga web portal, *One Piece* ranked first in a poll of \"must-read manga for the younger generation in China\".[213] In a poll conducted by eBookJapan in 2014 about \"manga that children want to read\" for \"Children's Reading Day\" by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the series also ranked first.[214]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2015, it was announced that Eiichiro Oda and *One Piece* had set the Guinness World Record for \"The most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\" with 320,866,000 copies printed worldwide by December 2014;[215] it updated the record on August 4, 2022, when it reached over 500 million copies in circulation worldwide in both print and digital copies (416,566,000 in Japan and 100 million copies in 60 countries and territories outside of Japan).[129] The series ranked fourth on the first annual Tsutaya Comic Awards' All-Time Best Section in 2017.[216] In 2021, TV Asahi announced the results of its \"Manga General Election\" poll in which 150,000 people voted for their \"Most Favorite Manga\", *One Piece* ranked first on the list.[217][218]\n\n\nIn 2014, the \"*One Piece* Premiere Summer\" event received the \"Best Overall Production\" award from the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions.[219]\n\n\n\n### Cultural impact[edit]\n\n\nAs part of an effort to help Kumamoto Prefecture recover from the 2016 earthquakes, Oda helped set up 10 statues of the Straw Hat Pirates around the prefecture. Luffy was the first statue to be unveiled in front of the Kumamoto Prefectual Government Office on November 30, 2018. Jinbe was the last statue, unveiled at Sumiyoshi Kaigan Park on July 23, 2022.[220][221]\n\n\nAt the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Greek athlete Miltiadis Tentoglou performed a \"Gear Second\" pose before winning a gold medal in the men's long jump competition.[222] A gene in the fruit fly (*Drosophila melanogaster*) was named \"Baramicin\", partly taking inspiration from the *One Piece* character Buggy. The gene encodes a protein that is split up into multiple parts.[223] A testate amoeba genus was named *Alabasta*, partly in reference to the *One Piece* Kingdom of *Alabasta*, also known as the Kingdom of Sand, a desert kingdom located on Sandy Island in the Paradise region.[224]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nFile:Thousand Sunny.JPG\nLife-size reproductions of the main characters' two pirate ships: the *Going Merry* (top) and the *Thousand Sunny* (bottom)\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n**Japanese names**\n\n\n\n1. **^** Devil Fruits (悪魔の実, *Akuma no Mi*)\n2. **^** Haki (覇気)\n3. **^** Red Line (赤い土の大陸, *Reddo Rain*)\n4. **^** Grand Line (偉大なる航路, *Reddo Rain*)\n5. **^** Calm Belt (凪の帯, *Kāmu Beruto*)\n6. **^** Sea Kings (海王類, *Kaiō-rui*)\n7. **^** North Blue (北の海, *Nōsu Burū*)\n8. **^** East Blue (東の海, *Īsuto Burū*)\n9. **^** West Blue (西の海, *Uesuto Burū*)\n10. **^** South Blue (南の海, *Sausu Burū*)\n11. **^** Sea Prism Stone (海楼石, *Kairōseki*, Seastone)\n12. **^** Reverse Mountain (リヴァース・マウンテン, *Rivāsu Maunten*)\n13. **^** Paradise (楽園, *Paradaisu*)\n14. **^** New World (新世界, *Shinsekai*)\n15. **^** Straw Hat Pirates (麦わら海賊団, *Mugiwara Kaizoku-dan*)\n16. **^** *Going Merry* (ゴーイング・メリー号, *Gōingu Merī-gō*)\n17. **^** *Thousand Sunny* (サウザンドサニー号, *Sauzando Sanī-gō*)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Official Website for One Piece\".

The initial manga, written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in *Weekly Shōnen Jump* from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters collected into 42 *tankōbon* volumes by its publisher Shueisha. *Dragon Ball* was originally inspired by the classical 16th-century Chinese novel *Journey to the West*, combined with elements of Hong Kong martial arts films. *Dragon Ball* characters also use a variety of East Asian martial arts styles, including karate[1][2][3] and Wing Chun (kung fu).[2][3][4] The series follows the adventures of protagonist Son Goku from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts. He spends his childhood far from civilization until he meets a teen girl named Bulma, who encourages him to join her quest in exploring the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several other friends, becomes a family man, discovers his alien heritage, and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls.\n\n\nToriyama's manga was adapted and divided into two anime series produced by Toei Animation: *Dragon Ball* and *Dragon Ball Z*, which together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. Additionally, the studio has developed 21 animated feature films and three television specials, as well as an anime sequel series titled *Dragon Ball GT* (1996–1997) and an anime midquel series titled *Dragon Ball Super* (2015–2018). From 2009 to 2015, a revised version of *Dragon Ball Z* aired in Japan under the title *Dragon Ball Kai*, as a recut that follows the manga's story more faithfully by removing most of the material featured exclusively in the anime. Several companies have developed various types of merchandise based on the series leading to a large media franchise that includes films (both animated and live-action), collectible trading card games, action figures, collections of soundtracks, and numerous video games. *Dragon Ball* has become one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\n\n\nSince its release, *Dragon Ball* has become one of the most successful manga and anime series of all time, with the manga sold in over 40 countries and the anime broadcast in more than 80 countries. The manga's 42 collected *tankōbon* volumes have over 160 million copies sold in Japan and 260 million copies sold worldwide,[5][a][c] making it one of the best-selling manga series. Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humor of the story. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential manga series ever made, with many manga artists citing *Dragon Ball* as a source of inspiration for their own now-popular works. The anime, particularly *Dragon Ball Z*, is also highly popular around the world and is considered one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture. It has had a considerable impact on global popular culture, referenced by and inspiring numerous artists, athletes, celebrities, filmmakers, musicians, and writers around the world.\n\n\n\n\n## Setting[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Dragon Ball characters\n\nEarth, known as the Dragon World (ドラゴンワールド) and designated as \"Planet 4032-877\" by the celestial hierarchy, is the main setting for the entire Dragon Ball series, as well as related media such as *Dr. Slump*, *Neko Majin*, and *Jaco the Galactic Patrolman*. It is mainly inhabited by Earthlings (地球人, *Chikyūjin*), a term used inclusively to refer to all of the intelligent races native to the planet, including humans, anthropomorphic beings, and monsters. Starting from the *Dragon Ball Z* series, various extraterrestrial species such as the Saiyans (サイヤ人, *Saiya-jin*) and Namekians (ナメック星人, *Namekku-seijin*) have played a more prominent role in franchise media.\n\n\nThe narrative of *Dragon Ball* predominantly follows the adventures of the Saiyan Son Goku; upon meeting Bulma at the beginning of the series, the two embark on an adventure to gather the seven Dragon Balls, a set of orbs that summon the wish-granting dragon Shenlong.[ch. 1] Goku later receives martial arts training from Kame-Sen'nin, meets his lifelong friend Kuririn, and enters the *Tenkaichi Budōkai* (天下一武道会, lit. \"Strongest Under the Heavens Martial Arts Tournament\") to fight the world's strongest warriors. When Piccolo Daimao, and later his offspring Piccolo, tries to conquer the planet, Goku receives training from Earth's deities to defeat them. Goku later sacrifices his life to save the planet from his estranged brother Raditz,[ch. 205] but is revived after training in the afterlife under the tutelage of the North Kaio to combat the other incoming Saiyans, Nappa and Vegeta. He later becomes a Super Saiyan and defeats the powerful alien tyrant Freeza; this sets the tone of the rest of the series, with each enemy the characters face becoming stronger than the last, requiring them to attain further training.\n\n\n*Dragon Ball Super* establishes that the franchise is set in a multiverse[11] composed of twelve[d] numbered universes, with the majority of the *Dragon Ball* series taking place in Universe 7 (第７宇宙, *Dai-Nana Uchū*, lit. \"Number Seven Universe\"). Each universe is ruled by a number of benevolent and malevolent deities, respectively called Kaioshin and Gods of Destruction who are appointed by a higher being called Zeno, who watches over the multiverse.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Dragon Ball characters and Dragon Ball (manga) § Production\n\nFile:Akira Toriyama.jpgAkira Toriyama, the creator of *Dragon Ball*\nAkira Toriyama was a fan of Hong Kong martial arts films, particularly Bruce Lee films such as *Enter the Dragon* (1973) and Jackie Chan films such as *Drunken Master* (1978), and wanted to create a manga inspired by martial arts films.[12][13][14] This led to Toriyama creating the 1983 one-shot manga *Dragon Boy*, which he later redeveloped into *Dragon Ball*.[15] Toriyama loosely modeled the plot and characters of *Dragon Ball* on the classic Chinese novel *Journey to the West*,[16][15] with Goku being Sun Wukong (\"Son Goku\" in Japanese), Bulma as Tang Sanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie, and Yamcha being Sha Wujing.[17] Toriyama wanted to create a story with the basic theme of *Journey to the West*, but with \"a little kung fu\"[18] by combining the novel with elements from the kung fu films of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee.[19] The title *Dragon Ball* was inspired by *Enter the Dragon* and later Bruceploitation knockoff kung fu films which frequently had the word \"Dragon\" in the title,[12] and the fighting scenes were influenced by Jackie Chan movies.[20][17] Since it was serialized in a shōnen manga magazine, he added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give it a game-like activity of gathering something, without thinking of what the characters would wish for.[18] His concept of the Dragon Balls was inspired by the epic Japanese novel *Nansō Satomi Hakkenden* (1814–1842), which involves the heroes collecting eight Buddhist prayer beads, which Toriyama adapted into collecting seven Dragon Balls.[21][22]\n\n\nHe originally thought it would last about a year or end once the Dragon Balls were collected.[23] Toriyama stated that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand, he specifically aimed *Dragon Ball* at readers older than those of his previous serial *Dr. Slump*.[24] He also wanted to break from the Western influences common in *Dr. Slump*, deliberately going for Chinese scenery, referencing Chinese buildings and photographs of China his wife had bought.[25] Toriyama wanted to set *Dragon Ball* in a fictional world largely based on Asia, taking inspiration from several Asian cultures including Japanese, Chinese, South Asian, Central Asian, Arabic and Indonesian cultures.[26] The island where the *Tenkaichi Budōkai* is held is modeled after Bali (in Indonesia), which he, his wife and assistant visited in mid-1985, and for the area around Bobbidi's spaceship he consulted photos of Africa.[25] Toriyama was also inspired by the jinn (genies) from *The Arabian Nights*.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Earth of *Dragon Ball*, as published in *Daizenshuu 4: World Guide*\nDuring the early chapters of the manga, Toriyama's editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, commented that Goku looked rather plain. To combat this, he added several characters like Kame-Sen'nin and Kuririn, and created the *Tenkaichi Budōkai* martial arts tournament to focus the storyline on fighting. It was when the first *Tenkaichi Budōkai* began that *Dragon Ball* truly became popular, having recalled the races and tournaments in *Dr. Slump*.[17] Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory. This allowed for more character growth as the manga progressed. He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline was inspired by the video game *Spartan X* (called *Kung-Fu Master* in the West), in which enemies appear very fast as the player ascends a tower (the game was in turn inspired by Jackie Chan's *Wheels on Meals* and Bruce Lee's *Game of Death*). He then created Piccolo Daimao as a truly evil villain, and as a result called that arc the most interesting to draw.[17]\n\n\nOnce Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (サイヤ人, *Saiya-jin*); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[28] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\"[17] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (超(スーパー)サイヤ人, *Sūpā Saiya-jin*) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[29] Goku's Super Saiyan form has blonde hair because it was easier to draw for Toriyama's assistant (who spent a lot of time blacking in Goku's hair), and has piercing eyes based on Bruce Lee's paralyzing glare.[30] *Dragon Ball Z* anime character designer Tadayoshi Yamamuro also used Bruce Lee as a reference for Goku's Super Saiyan form, stating that, when he \"first becomes a Super Saiyan, his slanting pose with that scowling look in his eyes is all Bruce Lee.\"[31] Toriyama later added time travel during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[17] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but later felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[17]\n\n\nGoing against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of *Dragon Ball*'s most powerful characters with small statures, including the protagonist, Goku.[32] Toriyama later explained that he had Goku grow up as a means to make drawing fight scenes easier, even though his first editor Kazuhiko Torishima was initially against it because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically.[33] When including fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid difficulties in drawing residents and destroyed buildings.[25] Toriyama said that he did not plan the details of the story, resulting in strange occurrences and discrepancies later in the series, including changing the colors of the characters mid-story and few characters having screentone because he found it difficult to use.[20][18][23][34] Since the completion of *Dragon Ball*, Toriyama has continued to add to its story, mostly background information on its universe, through guidebooks published by Shueisha.\n\n\nDuring the second half of the series, Toriyama has said that he had become more interested in coming up with the story than actually drawing it, and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines.[20] In 2013, he stated that because *Dragon Ball* is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborate, going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art.[33] He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an \"unconventional and contradictory\" story.[32] In 2013, commenting on *Dragon Ball*'s global success, Toriyama said, \"Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy.\", \"The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. I dare say I don't care even if [my works] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers.\"[35]\n\n\n\n## Manga[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dragon Ball (manga)\n\n![](image)*Dragon Ball* debuted in *Weekly Shōnen Jump* No. 51, on December 3, 1984 which is also considered to be highly sought after among fans and collectors\nWritten and illustrated by Akira Toriyama, *Dragon Ball* was serialized in the manga anthology *Weekly Shōnen Jump* from December 3, 1984 to June 5, 1995,[36][37] when Toriyama grew exhausted and felt he needed a break from drawing. The 519 individual chapters were published into 42 *tankōbon* volumes by Shueisha from September 10, 1985 through August 4, 1995.[38][39][40] Between December 4, 2002 and April 2, 2004, the chapters were re-released in a collection of 34 *kanzenban* volumes, which included a slightly rewritten ending, new covers, and color artwork from its *Weekly Shōnen Jump* run.[41][42] The February 2013 issue of *V Jump*, which was released in December 2012, announced that parts of the manga will be fully colored and re-released in 2013.[43] Twenty volumes, beginning from chapter 195 and grouped by story arcs, were released between February 4, 2013 and July 4, 2014.[44][45] Twelve volumes covering the first 194 chapters were published between January 4 and March 4, 2016.[46][47] A *sōshūhen* edition that aims to recreate the manga as it was originally serialized in *Weekly Shōnen Jump* with color pages, promotional text, and next chapter previews, was published in eighteen volumes between May 13, 2016 and January 13, 2017.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Spin-offs[edit]\n\n\nAnother manga penned by Ōishi, the three-chapter *Dragon Ball: Episode of Bardock* that revolves around Bardock, Goku's father, was published in the monthly magazine *V Jump* from August and October 2011.[50]\n\n\nThe final chapter of Toriyama's 2013 manga series *Jaco the Galactic Patrolman* revealed that it is set before *Dragon Ball*, with several characters making appearances.[51] *Jaco*'s collected volumes contain a bonus *Dragon Ball* chapter depicting Goku's mother.[52]\n\n\nIn December 2016, a spin-off manga titled *Dragon Ball Side Story: The Case of Being Reincarnated as Yamcha* began in Shueisha's *Shōnen Jump+* digital magazine. Written and illustrated by Dragon Garow Lee, it is about a high school boy who after an accident wakes up in the body of Yamcha in the *Dragon Ball* manga.[53]\n\n\n\n### Crossovers[edit]\n\n\nToriyama also created a short series, *Neko Majin* (1999–2005), that became a self-parody of *Dragon Ball*.[54] In 2006, a crossover between *Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo* (or *Kochikame*) and *Dragon Ball* by Toriyama and *Kochikame* author Osamu Akimoto appeared in the *Super Kochikame* (超こち亀, *Chō Kochikame*) manga.[55] That same year, Toriyama teamed up with Eiichiro Oda to create a crossover chapter of *Dragon Ball* and *One Piece* titled *Cross Epoch*.[56]\n\n\n\n### Reception[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Dragon Ball (manga) § Reception\n\nSee also: Weekly Shōnen Jump § Circulation figures\n\n  \n\n*Dragon Ball* is one of the most popular manga series of all time, and it continues to enjoy high readership today. *Dragon Ball* is credited as one of the main reasons manga circulation was at its highest between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s.[57][58] During *Dragon Ball*'s initial run in *Weekly Shōnen Jump*, the manga magazine reached an average circulation of 6.53 million weekly sales, the highest in its history.[57][58][59] During *Dragon Ball*'s serialisation between 1984 and 1995, *Weekly Shōnen Jump* magazine had a total circulation of over 2.9 billion copies,[60][e] with those issues generating an estimated ¥554 billion ($6.9 billion) in sales revenue.[e]\n\n\n*Dragon Ball* also sold a record number of collected *tankōbon* volumes for its time. By 2000, more than 126 million *tankōbon* copies had been sold in Japan alone.[61] It sold over 150 million copies in Japan by 2008, making it the best-selling manga ever at the time.[62] By 2012, its sales in Japan had grown to pass 156 million, making it the second best-selling *Weekly Shōnen Jump* manga of all time, behind *One Piece*.[63] *Dragon Ball*'s *tankobon* volumes sold 159.5 million copies in Japan by February 2014,[64] and have sold over 160 million copies in Japan as of 2016.[65]\n\n\nThe manga is similarly popular overseas, having been translated and released in over 40 countries worldwide.[66] The total number of *tankōbon* volumes sold have reached 350 million copies worldwide.[67][68][69][70][71] not including unofficial pirated copies; when including pirated copies, an estimated total of more than 400 million official and unofficial copies have been sold worldwide.[h][f][g]\n\n\nFor the 10th anniversary of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006, Japanese fans voted *Dragon Ball* the third greatest manga of all time.[72] In a survey conducted by Oricon in 2007 among 1,000 people, Son Goku, the main character of the franchise, ranked first place as the \"Strongest Manga Character of All Time.\"[73] Goku's journey and his ever-growing strength resulted in the character winning \"the admiration of young boys everywhere\".[16] Manga artists, such as *One Piece* creator Eiichiro Oda and *Naruto* creator Masashi Kishimoto, have stated that Goku inspired their series' main protagonists as well as series structure.[74][75]\n\n\nManga critic Jason Thompson stated in 2011 that \"*Dragon Ball* is by far the most influential shōnen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every *Shōnen Jump* artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways.\"[76] He says the series \"turns from a gag/adventure manga to an nearly-pure fighting manga\",[76] and its basic formula of \"lots of martial arts, lots of training sequences, a few jokes\" became the model for other shōnen series, such as *Naruto*.[77] Thompson also called Toriyama's art influential and cited it as a reason for the series' popularity.[76] James S. Yadao, author of *The Rough Guide to Manga*, claims that the first several chapters of *Dragon Ball* \"play out much like *Saiyuki* with *Dr. Slump*-like humour built in\" and that *Dr. Slump*, Toriyama's previous manga, has a clear early influence on the series.[78] He feels the series \"established its unique identity\" after the first occasion when Goku's group disbands and he trains under Kame-Sen'nin, when the story develops \"a far more action-packed, sinister tone\" with \"wilder\" battles with aerial and spiritual elements and an increased death count, while humor still makes an occasional appearance.[78] Yadao claims that an art shift occurs when the characters \"lose the rounded, innocent look that he established in *Dr. Slump* and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensity.\"[79]\n\n\n*Animerica* felt the series had \"worldwide appeal\", using dramatic pacing and over-the-top martial arts action to \"maintain tension levels and keep a crippler crossface hold on the audience's attention spans\".[80] In *Little Boy: The Art of Japan's Exploding Subculture*, Takashi Murakami commented that *Dragon Ball*'s \"never-ending cyclical narrative moves forward plausibly, seamlessly, and with great finesse.\"[61] Ridwan Khan from Animefringe.com commented that the manga had a \"chubby\" art style, but as the series continued the characters got more refined, leaner, and more muscular. Khan prefers the manga over the slow pacing of the anime counterparts.[81] Allen Divers of Anime News Network praised the story and humor of the manga as being very good at conveying all of the characters' personalities. Divers also called Viz's translation one of the best of all the English editions of the series due to its faithfulness to the original Japanese.[82] D. Aviva Rothschild of Rationalmagic.com remarked the first manga volume as \"a superior humor title\". They praised Goku's innocence and Bulma's insistence as one of the funniest parts of the series.[83]\n\n\nThe content of the manga has been controversial in the United States. In November 1999, Toys \"R\" Us removed Viz's *Dragon Ball* from their stores nationwide when a Dallas parent complained the series had \"borderline soft porn\" after he bought them for his four-year-old son.[84] Commenting on the issue, Susan J. Napier explained it as a difference in culture.[84] After the ban, Viz reluctantly began to censor the series to keep wide distribution.[85] However, in 2001, after releasing three volumes censored, Viz announced *Dragon Ball* would be uncensored and reprinted due to fan reactions.[85] In October 2009, Wicomico County Public Schools in Maryland banned the *Dragon Ball* manga from their school district because it \"depicts nudity, sexual contact between children and sexual innuendo among adults and children.\"[84]\n\n\n\n## Anime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Dragon Ball anime\n\nAdditionally, *Dragon Ball* is an anime television metaseries. *Dragon Ball* (1986-89), *Dragon Ball Z* (1989-96), and *Dragon Ball Super* (2015-18) are set in a uniform main continuity, while *Dragon Ball GT* (1996-97), and *Super Dragon Ball Heroes* (since 2018) explore several alternate continuities.\n\n\n\n### *Dragon Ball*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dragon Ball (TV series)\n\nFurther information: List of Dragon Ball episodes\n\nToei Animation produced an anime television series based on the first 194 manga chapters, also titled *Dragon Ball*. The series premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on February 26, 1986 and ran until April 19, 1989, lasting 153 episodes.[15] It is broadcast in 81 countries worldwide.[86]\n\n\n\n### *Dragon Ball Z*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dragon Ball Z\n\nFurther information: List of Dragon Ball Z episodes\n\nInstead of continuing the anime as *Dragon Ball*, Toei Animation decided to carry on with their adaptation under a new name and asked Akira Toriyama to come up with the title. *Dragon Ball Z* (ドラゴンボールZ(ゼット), *Doragon Bōru Zetto*, commonly abbreviated as *DBZ*) picks up five years after the first series left off and adapts the final 325 chapters of the manga. It premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on April 26, 1989, taking over its predecessor's time slot, and ran for 291 episodes until its conclusion on January 31, 1996.[15] Two television specials based on the *Z* series were aired on Fuji TV in Japan. The first, *The One True Final Battle ~The Z Warrior Who Challenged Frieza – Son Goku's Father~*, renamed *Bardock – The Father of Goku* by Funimation, was shown on October 17, 1990. The second special, *Defiance in the Face of Despair!! The Remaining Super-Warriors: Gohan and Trunks*, renamed *The History of Trunks* by Funimation, is based on a special chapter of the original manga and aired on February 24, 1993.\n\n\n\n### *Dragon Ball GT*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dragon Ball GT\n\nFurther information: List of Dragon Ball GT episodes\n\n*Dragon Ball GT* (ドラゴンボールGT(ジーティー), *Doragon Bōru Jī Tī*, *G(rand) T(ouring)*[87]) premiered on Fuji TV on February 7, 1996 and ran until November 19, 1997 for 64 episodes.[15] Unlike the first two anime series, it is not based on Akira Toriyama's original *Dragon Ball* manga,[88] being created by Toei Animation as a sequel to the series or as Toriyama called it, a \"grand side story of the original *Dragon Ball.*\"[87] Toriyama designed the main cast, the spaceship used in the show, the design of three planets, and came up with the title and logo. In addition to this, Toriyama also oversaw production of the series, just as he had for the *Dragon Ball* and *Dragon Ball Z* anime. The television special episode, *Goku's Side Story! The Proof of his Courage is the Four-Star Ball*, or *A Hero's Legacy* as Funimation titled it for their dub, aired on March 26, 1997, between episodes 41 and 42, serving as a kind of precursor to the epilogue to the series shown at the end of episode 64.\n\n\n\n### *Dragon Ball Z Kai*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Dragon Ball Z Kai episodes\n\nIn February 2009, *Dragon Ball Z* celebrated its 20th anniversary, with Toei Animation announcing that it would broadcast a re-edited and remastered version of the *Dragon Ball Z* anime under the name *Dragon Ball Kai* (ドラゴンボール改, *Doragon Bōru Kai*, lit. \"Dragon Ball Revised\"). The footage would be re-edited to follow the manga more closely, eliminating scenes and episodes which were not featured in the original manga, resulting in a more faithful adaptation, as well as in a faster-moving, and more focused story.[89] The episodes were remastered for HDTV, with rerecording of the vocal tracks by most of the original cast, and featuring updated opening and ending sequences. On April 5, 2009, the series premiered in Japan airing in Fuji TV.[90][91] *Dragon Ball Z Kai* reduced the episode count to 159 episodes (167 episodes internationally), from the original footage of 291 episodes. Damaged frames were removed, resulting in some minor shots being remade from scratch in order to fix cropping, and others to address continuity issues.[92] The majority of the international versions, including Funimation Entertainment's English dub, are titled *Dragon Ball Z Kai*.[93][94]\n\n\n\n### *Dragon Ball Super*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dragon Ball Super\n\nFurther information: List of Dragon Ball Super episodes\n\nOn April 28, 2015, Toei Animation announced *Dragon Ball Super* (ドラゴンボール超, *Doragon Bōru Sūpā*), the first all-new *Dragon Ball* television series to be released in 18 years. It debuted on July 5 and ran as a weekly series at 9:00 am on Fuji TV on Sundays until its series finale on March 25, 2018 after 131 episodes.[95] Masako Nozawa reprises her roles as Goku, Gohan, and Goten. Most of the original cast reprise their roles as well.[96][97] Koichi Yamadera and Masakazu Morita also reprise their roles, as Beerus and Whis, respectively.[97]\n\n\nThe story of the anime is set after the defeat of Majin Boo, when the Earth has become peaceful once again. Akira Toriyama is credited as the original creator, as well for \"original story & character design concepts.\"[98] It is also being adapted into a parallel manga.[99]\n\n\n\n### *Super Dragon Ball Heroes*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Super Dragon Ball Heroes (anime)\n\nFurther information: List of Super Dragon Ball Heroes episodes and Dragon Ball Heroes\n\nIn 2018, an anime to promote the *Super Dragon Ball Heroes* card and video game series was announced with a July 1 premiere.[100] The series' announcement included a brief synopsis:\n\n\n\n\n> Trunks returns from the future to train with Goku and Vegeta. However, he abruptly vanishes. The mysterious man \"Fu\" suddenly appears, telling them that Trunks has been locked up on the \"Prison Planet\", a mysterious facility in an unknown location between universes. The group searches for the Dragon Balls to free Trunks, but an unending super battle awaits them! Will Goku and the others manage to rescue Trunks and escape the Prison Planet?\n> \n> \n\n\n### Other installments[edit]\n\n\nThe short film *Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!* was created for the Jump Super Anime Tour,[101] which celebrated *Weekly Shōnen Jump*'s 40th anniversary, and debuted on September 21, 2008. A short animated adaptation of Naho Ōishi's Bardock spinoff manga, *Dragon Ball: Episode of Bardock*, was shown on December 17–18, 2011 at the Jump Festa 2012 event.[102]\n\n\nA two-episode original video animation (OVA) titled *Dragon Ball Z Side Story: Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans* was created in 1993 as strategy guides for the Famicom video game of the same name.[103] A remake titled *Dragon Ball: Plan to Eradicate the Super Saiyans* was created as a bonus feature for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game *Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2*, which was released on November 11, 2010.[104]\n\n\nA two-part hour-long crossover special between *Dragon Ball Z*, *One Piece* and *Toriko*, referred to as *Dream 9 Toriko & One Piece & Dragon Ball Z Super Collaboration Special!!* aired on April 7, 2013.[105]\n\n\n\n### Reception[edit]\n\n\nThe anime adaptations have also been very well-received and are better known in the Western world than the manga, with Anime News Network saying, \"Few anime series have mainstreamed it the way *Dragon Ball Z* has. To a certain generation of television consumers its characters are as well known as any in the animated realm, and for many it was the first step into the wilderness of anime fandom.\"[106] In a survey conducted by Oricon, \"Japanese anime that I think is world-class\" and \"world-class Manga & Anime\" \"Dragon Ball\" was selected as No. 1 with an overwhelming number of votes in both surveys[107][108].In 2000, satellite TV channel Animax together with *Brutus*, a men's lifestyle magazine, and Tsutaya, Japan's largest video rental chain, conducted a poll among 200,000 fans on the top anime series, with *Dragon Ball* coming in fourth.[109] \"Dragon Ball\" won first place in the \"100 Best Anime in Japan that has advanced to the world\" questionnaire on TV Asahi 's \" Decision! This is Japan's Best \".[110] TV Asahi conducted two polls in 2005 on the Top 100 Anime, *Dragon Ball* came in second in the nationwide survey conducted with multiple age-groups and in third in the online poll.[111][112]\n\n\n*Dragon Ball* is one of the most successful franchises in animation history.[113] The anime series is broadcast in more than 80 countries worldwide.[86] In Japan, the first sixteen anime films up until *Dragon Ball Z: Wrath of the Dragon* (1995) sold 50 million tickets and grossed over ¥40 billion ($501 million) at the box office, in addition to selling over 500,000 home video units, by 1996.[114][115] Later DVD releases of the *Dragon Ball* anime series have topped Japan's sales charts on several occasions.[116][117] In the United States, the anime series sold over 25 million DVD units by January 2012,[118] and has sold more than 30 million DVD and Blu-ray units as of 2017.[113] In Latin America, public screenings of the *Dragon Ball Super* finale in 2018 filled public spaces and stadiums in cities across the region, including stadiums holding tens of thousands of spectators.[119]\n\n\n*Dragon Ball Z* also proved to be a rating success in the United States, outperforming top shows such as *Friends* and *The X-Files* in some parts of the country in sweeps ratings during its first season.[120] The premiere of season three of *Dragon Ball Z* in 1999, done by Funimation's in-house dub, was the highest-rated program ever at the time on Cartoon Network.[121] In 2002, in the week ending September 22, *Dragon Ball Z* was the #1 program of the week on all of television with tweens 9-14, boys 9-14 and men 12-24, with the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday telecasts of *Dragon Ball Z* ranked as the top three programs in all of television, broadcast or cable, for delivery of boys 9-14.[122] Dragon ball GT has also had high ratings[123] In 2001, it was reported that the official website of *Dragon Ball Z* recorded 4.7 million hits per day and included 500,000+ registered fans.[124] Dragon Ball Z topped the Lycos 50 list of 'most searched' items for the second consecutive year -- the first time that any topic has ever been able to repeat its dominance over a two-year period.[125] Dragon Ball ranked second overall in the search number ranking for the past 10 years released by LYCOS in 2005.[126] and ranked 3rd in Yahoo! in 2002 with Playstation 2 topping the list[127] Even after it ended, the \"Dragon Ball\" series continues to maintain a high level of popularity, surpassing that of new anime, and is also often being rebroadcast, making the \"Dragon Ball\" series Funimation's most important anime license[128] The audience rating of the first Dragon ball Kai episode on Nicktoons is the highest since the station opened[129]\n\n\nCarl Kimlinger of Anime News Network summed up *Dragon Ball* as \"an action-packed tale told with rare humor and something even rarer—a genuine sense of adventure.\"[130] Both Kimlinger and colleague Theron Martin noted Funimation's reputation for drastic alterations of the script, but praised the dub.[130][131] However, some critics and most fans of the Japanese version have been more critical with Funimation's English dub and script of *Dragon Ball Z* over the years. Jeffrey Harris of IGN criticized the voices, including how Freeza's appearance combined with the feminine English voice left fans confused about Freeza's gender.[132] Carlos Ross of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews considered the series' characters to be different from stereotypical stock characters and noted that they undergo much more development.[133] Despite praising *Dragon Ball Z* for its cast of characters, they criticized it for having long and repetitive fights.[134]\n\n\n*Dragon Ball Z* is well-known, and often criticized, for its long, repetitive, dragged-out fights that span several episodes, with Martin commenting \"DBZ practically turned drawing out fights into an art form.\"[135] However, Jason Thompson of io9 explained that this comes from the fact that the anime was being created alongside the manga.[136] *Dragon Ball Z* was listed as the 78th best animated show in IGN's Top 100 Animated Series,[137] and was also listed as the 50th greatest cartoon in *Wizard* magazine's Top 100 Greatest Cartoons list.[138]\n\n\nHarris commented that *Dragon Ball GT* \"is downright repellent\", mentioning that the material and characters had lost their novelty and fun. He also criticized the *GT* character designs of Trunks and Vegeta as being goofy.[132] Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network also gave negative comments about *GT*, mentioning that the fights from the series were \"a very simple childish exercise\" and that many other anime were superior. The plot of *Dragon Ball GT* has also been criticized for giving a formula that was already used in its predecessors.[139]\n\n\n\n## Other media[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Dragon Ball films\n\n### Anime films[edit]\n\n\nTwenty animated theatrical films based on the *Dragon Ball* series have been released in Japan. The most recent films, *Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods* (2013), *Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F'* (2015), *Dragon Ball Super: Broly* (2018), and *Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero* (2022), were produced as full-length feature films and were given stand-alone theatrical releases in Japan (as well as limited theatrical releases in the U.S.). They've also been the first movies to have original creator Akira Toriyama deeply involved in their production; *Battle of Gods* and *Resurrection 'F'* were remade into the first and second arcs of the *Dragon Ball Super* anime, which told the same stories as the two films in expanded detail.[140][141] The 1996 feature film, *Dragon Ball: The Path to Power*, was also a full-length theatrical release with a running time of 80 minutes, and was produced to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the anime as a re-imagining of the first few arcs of the series.\n\n\nAll previous films were mostly below feature length (around 45–60 minutes each), making them only slightly longer than one or two episodes of the TV series; this is due to them being originally shown as back-to-back presentations alongside other Toei film productions. These films are also mostly alternate re-tellings of certain story arcs (like *The Path to Power*), or extra side-stories that do not correlate with the continuity of the series. The first three films, along with *The Path to Power*, are based on the original *Dragon Ball* anime series. The remaining thirteen older films are based on *Dragon Ball Z*. The first five films were shown at the Toei Manga Festival (東映まんがまつり, *Tōei Manga Matsuri*), while the sixth through seventeenth films were shown at the Toei Anime Fair (東映アニメフェア, *Toei Anime Fea*).\n\n\n\n### Live-action film[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dragonball Evolution\n\nAn American live-action film titled *Dragonball Evolution* was produced by 20th Century Fox after it acquired the feature film rights to the *Dragon Ball* franchise in March 2002. Previous to the film, two unofficial live-action films had been produced decades prior. The first was a Korean film titled *Dragon Ball: Ssawora Son Goku, Igyeora Son Goku* (드래곤볼 싸워라 손오공 이겨라 손오공; *Deulaegonbol Ssawola Son Ogong Igyeola Son Ogong*; lit. *Dragon Ball: Fight Son Goku, Win Son Goku*), while the second was a Taiwanese film titled *Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins* (新七龍珠; *Xīn qī lóng zhū*), which was also dubbed in English.[142][143] The film was directed by James Wong and produced by Stephen Chow, it was released in the United States on April 10, 2009.[143][144] The film was meant to lead into sequels,[145][146]\nwhich were cancelled, after the film flopped at the box office and became universally heralded as one of the worst adaptations of all time, being considered by the fans as being unfaithful to the source material.[147] Franchise creator Akira Toriyama also criticized the film adding he was completely left out of the creative process, despite having himself offered to help, going as far as saying: \"the result was a movie, I couldn't even call *Dragon Ball*\".[148] Years after its release, the writer of the film, Ben Ramsey, released a public apology in which he admitted to have written the film \"chasing for a payday\" instead of \"as a fan of the franchise\".[149][150]\n\n\nWith the news of 20th Century Fox selling itself, its assets; which include the film rights to the *Dragon Ball* franchise, will now be owned by its purchaser, The Walt Disney Company.[151] However, there have been no plans made by the Walt Disney Company to create a new live action Dragon Ball movie.[152]\n\n\n\n### Theme park attractions[edit]\n\n\n\"Dragon Ball Z: The Real 4D\" debuted at Universal Studios Japan in the summer of 2016. It features a battle between Goku and Freeza. Unlike most *Dragon Ball* animation, the attraction is animated with CGI. A second attraction titled \"Dragon Ball Z: The Real 4-D at Super Tenkaichi Budokai\" debuted at Universal Studios Japan in the summer of 2017, which featured a battle between the heroes and Broly.\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Dragon Ball video games\n\n![](image)A *Dragon Ball Z* arcade conversion kit that includes the PCB, instructions and operator's manual\nThe *Dragon Ball* franchise has spawned multiple video games across various genres and platforms. Earlier games of the series included a system of card battling and were released for the Famicom following the storyline of the series.[153] Starting with the Super Famicom and Mega Drive, most of the games were from the fighting genre or RPG (Role Playing Game), such as the *Super Butoden* series.[154] The first *Dragon Ball* game to be released in the United States was *Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout* for the PlayStation in 1997.[155] For the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable games the characters were redone in 3D cel-shaded graphics. These games included the *Dragon Ball Z: Budokai* series and the *Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi* series.[156][157] *Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit* was the first game of the franchise developed for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[158] *Dragon Ball Xenoverse* was the first game of the franchise developed for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.[159][160] A massively multiplayer online role-playing game called *Dragon Ball Online* was available in Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan until the servers were shut down in 2013.[161] A few years later fans started recreating the game. Today, \"Dragon Ball Online Global\" is a new, European version of *Dragon Ball Online* and it is being developed, while open beta server is running.[162]\n\n\nThe mobile game *Dragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle* (2015) has received over 350 million downloads worldwide, as of 2021[update].[163] A notable recent release is *Dragon Ball FighterZ* (2018), a fighting game developed by Arc System Works. The game received massive fan and critical acclaim for its fast paced frantic 3v3 battles and great visuals, also winning Best Fighting Game of 2018 at The Game Awards[164] and many other awards and other nominations. It also has a large eSports scene, where it is one of the most popular fighting games.[119] It also did very well commercially, selling 4 million units across all platforms.[165]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nIn 1994, the licensee Bandai earned $140 million annually from sales of licensed *Dragon Ball* toys, video games and other character goods in Japan.[166] In 1996, *Dragon Ball Z* grossed $2.95 billion in merchandise sales worldwide.[167] As of early 1996, more than 100 companies outside Japan applied for character goods.[168] Bandai sold over 2 billion *Dragon Ball* Carddass cards in Japan by 1998,[169] and over 1 million Dragon Stars action figures in the Americas and Europe as of 2018.[170] In 2000, Burger King sponsored a toy promotion to distribute 20 million *Dragon Ball Z* figures across North America.[171] By 2011, the franchise had generated $5 billion in merchandise sales.[172] In 2012, the franchise grossed ¥7.67 billion ($96.13 million) from licensed merchandise sales in Japan.[173]\n\n\n\n### Soundtracks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Dragon Ball soundtracks\n\nMyriad soundtracks were released in the anime, movies and the games.

Chief among these are the *Daizenshuu* (大全集) series, comprising seven hardback main volumes and three supplemental softcover volumes, covering the manga and the first two anime series and their theatrical films. The first of these, *Dragon Ball: The Complete Illustrations* (*Daizenshuu* volume 1), first published in Japan in 1995, is the only one that was released in English, being printed in 2008 by Viz Media.[178] It contains all 264 colored illustrations Akira Toriyama drew for the *Weekly Shōnen Jump* magazines' covers, bonus giveaways and specials, and all the covers for the 42 *tankōbon*. It also includes an interview with Toriyama on his work process. The remainder have never been released in English, and all are now out of print in Japan. From February 4 to May 9, 2013, condensed versions of the *Daizenshuu* with some updated information were released as the four-volume *Chōzenshū* (超全集) series.[43] For *Dragon Ball GT*, the *Dragon Ball GT Perfect Files* were released in May and December 1997 by Shueisha's *Jump Comics Selection* imprint. They include series information, illustration galleries, behind-the-scenes information, and more. They were out of print for many years, but were re-released in April 2006 (accompanying the Japanese DVD release of *Dragon Ball GT*) and this edition is still in print.[179][180]\n\n\nCoinciding with the 34-volume *kanzenban* re-release of the manga, and the release of the entire series on DVD for the first time in Japan, four new guidebooks were released in 2003 and 2004. *Dragon Ball Landmark* and *Dragon Ball Forever* cover the manga, using volume numbers for story points that reference the *kanzenban* release,[181][182] while *Dragon Ball: Tenkaichi Densetsu* (ドラゴンボール 天下一伝説) and *Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku Densetsu* (ドラゴンボールZ 孫悟空伝説) cover the *Dragon Ball* and *Dragon Ball Z* anime, respectively.[183][184] Much of the material in these books is reused from the earlier *Daizenshuu* volumes, but they include new textual material including substantial interviews with the creator, cast and production staff of the series. *Son Goku Densetsu* in particular showcases previously-unpublished design sketches of Goku's father Bardock, drawn by character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru prior to creator Akira Toriyama's revisions that resulted in the final version.\n\n\nFollowing the release of *Dragon Ball Kai* in Japan, four new guidebooks were released: the two-volume *Dragon Ball: Super Exciting Guide* (ドラゴンボール 超エキサイティングガイド) in 2009, covering the manga,[185][186] and two-volume *Dragon Ball: Extreme Battle Collection* (ドラゴンボール　極限バトルコレクション) in 2010, covering the anime series.[187][188] Despite the TV series airing during this time being *Kai*, the *Extreme Battle Collection* books reference the earlier *Z* series in content and episode numbers. These books also include new question-and-answer sessions with Akira Toriyama, revealing a few new details about the world and characters of the series. 2010 also saw the release of a new artbook, *Dragon Ball: Anime Illustrations Guide – The Golden Warrior* (ドラゴンボール アニメイラスト集 「黄金の戦士」); a sort of anime-counterpart to the manga-oriented *Complete Illustrations*, it showcases anime-original illustrations and includes interviews with the three principal character designers for the anime. Each of the Japanese \"Dragon Box\" DVD releases of the series and movies, which were released from 2003 to 2006, as well as the Blu-ray boxed sets of *Dragon Ball Kai*, released 2009 to 2011, come with a *Dragon Book* guide that contains details about the content therein. Each also contains a new interview with a member of the cast or staff of the series. These books have been reproduced textually for Funimation's release of the *Dragon Ball Z* Dragon Box sets from 2009 to 2011.\n\n\n\n### Collectible cards[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Dragon Ball Collectible Card Game and Dragon Ball Z Collectible Card Game\n\nCollectible cards based on the *Dragon Ball*, *Dragon Ball Z*, and *Dragon Ball GT* series have been released by Bandai. These cards feature various scenes from the manga and anime stills, plus exclusive artwork from all three series. Bandai released the first set in the United States in July 2008.[189]\n\n\n\n### Tabletop role-playing game[edit]\n\n\n*Dragon Ball Z: The Anime Adventure Game*, a tabletop role-playing game produced by R. Talsorian Games, was published in 1999.[190][191]\n\n\n\n## Cultural impact[edit]\n\n\nSince its debut, *Dragon Ball* has had a considerable impact on global popular culture.[119][192] In 2015, the Japan Anniversary Association officially declared May 9 as \"Goku Day\" (悟空の日, *Gokū no Hi*); in Japanese, the numbers five and nine can be pronounced as \"Go\" and \"Ku\".[193] It is similarly influential in international popular culture across other parts of the world.[119] In the Philippines, a children's musical titled *Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z: Myth, Magic, Music*, was staged in June 1996.[194] *Dragon Ball* is widely referenced in American popular culture, from television and music to celebrities and athletes, and the show has been celebrated with Goku making an appearance at the 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parades, and with *Dragon Ball* murals appearing in cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, Kansas City and Denver.[192]\n\n\n*Dragon Ball* is also immensely popular in other regions of the world, such as Latin America, where public screenings of the *Dragon Ball Super* finale in 2018 filled public spaces and stadiums in cities across the region, including stadiums holding tens of thousands of spectators.[119] *Dragon Ball* creator Akira Toriyama was decorated a *Chevalier* or \"Knight\" of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government in May 2019 for his contributions to the arts, particularly for *Dragon Ball* which has been credited with popularizing manga in France.[195][196]\n\n\nVegeta's quote \"It's Over 9000!\" from the Saiyan Saga in the English dub of *Dragon Ball Z* is a popular Internet meme.[197] Goku has been identified as a superhero,[198][199] as well as Gohan with his Great Saiyaman persona.[200] Motorola's Freescale DragonBall and DragonBall EZ/VZ microcontroller processors, released in 1995, are named after *Dragon Ball* and *Dragon Ball Z*, respectively.[201]\n\n\n\n### Comics and animation[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Dragon Ball (manga) § Legacy and cultural impact\n\n*Dragon Ball* has been cited as inspiration across various different media. *Dragon Ball* is credited with setting trends for popular shōnen manga and anime since the 1980s, with manga critic Jason Thompson in 2011 calling it \"by far the most influential shōnen manga of the last 30 years.\" Successful shōnen manga authors such as Eiichiro Oda (*One Piece*), Masashi Kishimoto (*Naruto*), Tite Kubo (*Bleach*), Hiro Mashima (*Fairy Tail*) and Kentaro Yabuki (*Black Cat*) have cited *Dragon Ball* as an influence on their own now popular works. According to Thompson, \"almost every *Shōnen Jump* artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways.\"[76]\n\n\nIan Jones-Quartey, a producer of the American animated series *Steven Universe*, is a fan of *Dragon Ball* and *Dr. Slump*, and uses Toriyama's vehicle designs as a reference for his own. He also stated that \"We're all big Toriyama fans on [*Steven Universe*], which kind of shows a bit.\"[202] Comic book artist André Lima Araújo cited *Dragon Ball*, along with several other manga and anime, as a major influence on his work, which includes Marvel comics such as *Age of Ultron*, *Avengers A.I.*, *Spider-Verse* and *The Inhumans*.[203] Filipino comic artist Dexter Soy, who has worked on Marvel and DC comics such as *Captain America*, cited *Dragon Ball* as a major inspiration.[204] *Tony Stark: Iron Man* #11 (2019) makes references to *Dragon Ball Z*, including Miles Morales as Spider-Man referencing the Super Saiyan transformation.[205]\n\n\n\n### Film and television[edit]\n\n\nIn December 1990, an unofficial live-action Korean film adaptation *Dragon Ball: Ssawora Son Goku, Igyeora Son Goku* was released.[206][207] Another unofficial live-action film adaptation of the series, *Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins*, was released in Taiwan in November 1991,[15] and was later released in 2007 as an \"Ultimate Edition,\" with new effects added à la *Star Wars*.\n\n\nAction film star Jackie Chan is a fan of the franchise, and said Goku is his favorite *Dragon Ball* character. In 1995, Chan had expressed some interest in adapting *Dragon Ball* into a film, but said it would require \"a lot of amazing special effects and an enormous budget.\"[208] Later in 2013, Toriyama said his ideal live-action Goku would have been a young Jackie Chan, stating that \"nobody could play Goku but him.\"[209]\n\n\n*The Matrix* franchise echoes *Dragon Ball Z* in several action scenes, including the climactic fights of the 2003 films *The Matrix Reloaded* and *The Matrix Revolutions*.[210] Filipino-American film storyboard artist Jay Oliva has cited *Dragon Ball* as a major inspiration on his work, particularly the action scenes of 2013 Superman film *Man of Steel*, which launched the DC Extended Universe.[211] Several films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have also been visually influenced by *Dragon Ball Z*. Erik Killmonger's battle armour in *Black Panther* (2018) bears a resemblance to Vegeta's battle armour,[212][213] which actor Michael B. Jordan (himself a *Dragon Ball* fan) said may have inspired Killmonger's battle armor.[214] The fiery look of Carol Danvers' Binary powers in *Captain Marvel* (2019) also drew some influence from *Dragon Ball Z*.[215] In *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* (2021), Katy refers to one of Shang-Chi's techniques as a \"*Kamehameha* fireball\";[216] the film's director Destin Daniel Cretton cited *Dragon Ball Z* as an inspiration behind the film's climactic fight scene.[217]\n\n\nA key characteristic that set *Dragon Ball Z* (and later other anime shows) apart from American television shows at the time was a serialization format, where a continuous story arc stretches over multiple episodes or seasons. Traditional American television had an episodic format, with each episode typically consisting of a self-contained story, whereas *Dragon Ball Z* and later anime shows had a serialization format where continuous story arcs stretch over multiple episodes or seasons. Serialization has since also become a common characteristic of American streaming television shows during the \"Peak TV\" era.[218]\n\n\n\n### Music and sports[edit]\n\n\n*Dragon Ball* has been channeled and referenced by numerous musicians. It is popular in the hip hop community, and has been referenced in numerous hip hop songs by rappers and artists such as Chris Brown, Chance the Rapper, Big Sean, Lil Uzi Vert, G-Mo Skee, The Weeknd, Childish Gambino,[192] Denzel Curry, Thundercat, B.o.B, Soulja Boy,[219] Drake,[220] Frank Ocean, and Sese.[221] Mark Sammut of *TheGamer* notes that Gohan occasionally performs the dab move (as the Great Saiyaman), decades before it became a popular hip-hop dance move in American popular culture.[222]\n\n\nNumerous athletes have also channeled and referenced *Dragon Ball*, including NBA basketball players such as Sacramento Kings guard De'Aaron Fox, Chicago Bulls forward Lauri Markkanen, Golden State Warriors player Jordan Bell, and Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball, American football NFL stars such as Cleveland Browns players Darren Fells and David Njoku, mixed martial artist Ronda Rousey,[192] and WWE wrestlers such as The New Day.[223][224] Japanese kickboxer Panchan Rina took her nickname from the *Dragon Ball* character Pan.[225] Japanese mixed martial artist Itsuki Hirata is nicknamed \"Android 18\" due to her resembling the *Dragon Ball* character.[226] Canadian mixed martial artist Carlos Newton dubbed his fighting style \"Dragon Ball jiu-jitsu\" in tribute to the series.[227] Other mixed martial artists inspired by *Dragon Ball* include Kana Watanabe, Yushin Okami, Yoshihiro Akiyama and Yuya Wakamatsu.[228][229] The French group Yamakasi cited *Dragon Ball* as an influence on their development of parkour, inspired by how the heroes attain extraordinary abilities through hard work.[230]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nThe producer of the *Tekken* video game series, Katsuhiro Harada, said that *Dragon Ball* was one of the first works to visually depict chi and thereby influenced numerous Japanese video games, especially fighting games such as *Tekken* and *Street Fighter*.[231] Masaaki Ishikawa, art director of the video game *Arms*, said that its art style was largely influenced by *Dragon Ball* and *Akira*.[232] French video game designer Éric Chahi also cited *Dragon Ball* as an influence on his 1991 cinematic platformer *Another World*.[233] Other video game industry veterans who were inspired by *Dragon Ball* include Suda51, SWERY, Insomniac Games, Nina Freeman, Heart Machine, Iron Galaxy, and Mega64.[231]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Other sources estimate the total *Dragon Ball* tankōbon sales worldwide to be 260 or 300 million copies.[6][7][8][9][10] See *Dragon Ball (manga) § Reception* for worldwide sales breakdown.\n2. **^** See *Weekly Shōnen Jump § Manga series*\n3. **^** In addition to tankōbon sales, *Dragon Ball* had a total estimated circulation of approximately 2.96 billion copies in *Weekly Shōnen Jump* magazine.[b]\n4. **^** Originally there were eighteen universes, but six of them were since erased by Zeno, a supreme deity.\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** See *Weekly Shōnen Jump § Circulation figures*\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Cite error: The named reference `China` was invoked but never defined (see the help page).\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Cite error: The named reference `Korea` was invoked but never defined (see the help page).\n8. **^** Tally does not include unofficial pirated copies.

The series follows the title character, a professional assassin for hire. *Golgo 13* is the oldest manga still in publication, and its *tankōbon* edition was certified by *Guinness World Records* as the highest number of volumes for a manga series. Saito said before his death in 2021 that he wanted the manga to continue on without him and previously raised concerns the manga may be unfinished after he passes away. The Saito Production group of manga creators will continue its publication with the assistance of the *Big Comic*'s editorial department.\n\n\nThe series has been adapted into two live-action feature films, an anime film, an original video animation, an anime television series and six video games.\n\n\nWith a cumulative total of 300 million copies in circulation in various formats, including compilation books, it is the second-best-selling manga series and the top-selling *seinen* manga series in history. The manga won the 1975 Shogakukan Manga Award for general manga and the Grand Prize at the 2002 Japan Cartoonists Association Awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Story[edit]\n\n\nGolgo 13 is a professional assassin. His real name, age and birthplace are unknown and there is no consensus in the worldwide intelligence community as to his true identity.[2] Most of his jobs are completed through the use of a customized, scoped M16 rifle. His most frequently used alias is Duke Togo (デューク・東郷, *Dyūku Tōgō*), but he also goes by Tadashi Togo (東郷 隆, *Tōgō Tadashi*) and Togo Rodriguez (トーゴ・ロドリゲス, *Tōgo Rodorigesu*).\n\n\nDuke Togo has a very quiet personality and will only talk when he needs to, he shows very little to no emotion when carrying out an assassination and is willing to kill anyone who will threaten to expose him. He accepts many different assassination jobs, from anyone who can afford his services. From simply shooting a violin string to taking out powerful organized crime bosses and political figures, these killings have often attracted retaliations against Golgo 13, even at one stage having both the FBI, CIA, and even the United States military out to kill him, causing Togo to always have to watch his own back and pay attention to his surroundings in order to stop other assassins and contract killers employed to kill him in often creative ways. Golgo 13 also employs many different people himself to assist him in his assassination jobs, such as in providing extra information on his targets to modifying his weapons, vehicles, and gadgets.\n\n\nThe name \"Golgo 13\" is a reference to the death of Jesus Christ. *Golgo* is short for Golgotha, the place of Jesus' crucifixion, while the number 13 is considered an unlucky number.[3] Also, Golgo 13's logo is a skeleton wearing a crown of thorns.\n\n\nDuke Togo's past is a mystery. Although his Asian appearance suggests that he may be of Japanese origin, many of Golgo 13's stories have presented different speculations about his true identity while presenting contradictory information, leaving the audience uncertain which information is true. It is known that he may be the biological father of many different children all over the world from the many sexual encounters he has had with women throughout the series, such as a four-year-old son named Joey from ex-Provisional Irish Republican Army fighter Catherine McCall.[4][5]\n\n\nWith respect to the character's age, a large number of stories are dated as they are centered around current events of the time. However, Golgo 13's age has not increased significantly to account for these events. He has also suffered multiple injuries throughout the series, leaving many different scars on his body.[6]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nEarly on, Takao Saito developed a system where he created the page layout based on a script written by the editorial department. He also inked the main characters' faces, while assistants provided the backgrounds and other elements. He did extensive research to provide accuracy, especially when the plot dealt with technology.[7] Kazuo Koike was one of the writers on the series in the beginning.[8][9] Author Yoichi Funado wrote approximately 30 stories for *Golgo 13*, three of which he later novelized.[10] Takashi Nagasaki was Saito's editor on the series in the mid-1980s, and later wrote two stories for the manga under the pen name \"Keishi Edogawa\".[11]\n\n\nAccording to Jason Thompson, several *Golgo 13* stories have not been reprinted for being \"offensive or libelous\". Thompson lists one from 1986 because of complaints from the Iranian embassy in Japan, another from 1988 about money laundering in the Vatican, and one from 1989 about a Hollywood actor blackmailed when someone discovers he has AIDS.[12]\n\n\nIn 2013, Saito stated that because he often worried about his manga being cancelled, he had an ending planned out that even included the panel layout. He said he had no idea when *Golgo 13* would end, claiming \"The manga has continued so long that it is no longer the property of the author; it belongs to the readers.\"[13] Two years later, *Big Comic*'s fourth issue of 2015 announced that the series was \"heading towards its conclusion.\"[14]\n\n\nDue to difficulties that arose from the restrictions implemented by the government to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, *Golgo 13* began its first hiatus in its 52-year history in May 2020.[15] It returned on July 7, 2020.[16]\n\n\nSaito died of pancreatic cancer at 84 on September 24, 2021.[17][18] According to Shogakukan, Saito said before his death that he wanted the manga to continue on without him. The Saito Production group of manga creators continues its publication with the assistance of *Big Comic*'s editorial department.[19]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Manga[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *Golgo 13* chapters\n\nWritten and illustrated by Takao Saito, *Golgo 13* has been serialized in the monthly manga magazine *Big Comic* since its January 1969 issue, published in October 1968.[20] The chapters have been collected into *tankōbon* volumes by Shogakukan and Leed Publishing, a spinoff of the author's own Saito Production,[12] since June 21, 1973.[21] As of July 2023, 209 volumes of the *tankōbon* edition have been published,[22] while the *bunkoban* edition has 167 volumes.[23]\n\n\nIn 1986, Leed Publishing released four *Golgo 13* stories translated by Patrick Connolly: \"Into the Wolves' Lair\", \"Galinpero\", \"The Ice Lake Hit\" and \"The Ivory Connection\".[12][24]\n\n\nIn 1989 and 1990, Leed and Vic Tokai published two further *Golgo 13* comic books, \"The Impossible Hit\" and \"The Border Hopper\", as part of the promotion for two *Golgo 13* video games.[12] The comics were released to the US public via a mail-in offer with the purchase of the games and were later even found packaged with the video games. Each issue contained one complete story and had nothing to do with the storylines of the video games themselves.\n\n\nIn 1991, Leed Publishing and Viz Media published *The Professional: Golgo 13*, a three-part mini-series.[12] *The Professional* was a re-printing of \"The Argentine Tiger\", a story where Golgo is hired by the British Government to assassinate the reportedly dead ex-president of Argentina Juan Perón.\n\n\nIn 2006, *Golgo 13* was brought back by Viz as part of their Viz Signature collection. The stories are picked from the forty-year history of the manga, and do not necessarily represent the original's order of publication. A total of thirteen volumes were published, with the thirteenth volume being published on February 19, 2008. Each volume ends with an editorial commentary on *Golgo 13* as a cultural phenomenon in Japan.[6]\n\n\nA spin-off manga titled *Gunsmith Dave* (銃器職人・デイブ) and focusing on the character Dave McCartney began serialization in the August special issue of *Big Comic* on July 17, 2021.[25] The spin-off ended its \"first season\" on May 17, 2022.[26] Saito and Saito Production are credited with creating the manga.[27]\n\n\nA second spin-off, *Golgo Camp* (ゴルゴCAMP) created by Yukio Miyama, was launched on Shogakukan's *Manga One* app on August 28, 2021.[28] It is a gag comedy and follows Golgo 13 at a modern-day campsite.[29]\n\n\nA third spin-off, *G no Idenshi: Shōjo Fanette* (Gの遺伝子 少女ファネット), began serialization in the August issue of *Big Comic Zōkan* on July 15, 2022.[26] It focuses on the French junior high school student Fanette, who has Golgo's genes.[30]\n\n\n\n### Live action[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Golgo 13* (film) and *Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon*\n\nToei Company produced a live-action film simply titled *Golgo 13* in 1973, directed by Junya Sato and starring Ken Takakura as Duke Togo and Pouri Banayi as Catherine Morton. It was filmed entirely in the Imperial State of Iran with an entirely Persian supporting cast. It was followed by *Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon* in 1977, directed by Yukio Noda, which replaced Takakura with Sonny Chiba. In 2011, production company Davis Film obtained the American film rights to *Golgo*.[31]\n\n\n\n### Anime[edit]\n\n\n#### *Golgo 13: The Professional*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Golgo 13: The Professional*\n\n*Golgo 13: The Professional*, known simply as *Golgo 13* in Japan, is a 1983 animated featured film. Golgo 13's voice is provided by Tetsurō Sagawa in the Japanese version, and Gregory Snegoff in Streamline Pictures' English dub. It incorporates CGI animation, which was in its infancy at the time. This is most notable in the scene where army helicopters circle around Dawson Tower and attack Golgo as he climbs toward Dawson's office on the top floor.\n\n\n\n#### *Golgo 13: Queen Bee*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Golgo 13: Queen Bee*\n\n*Golgo 13: Queen Bee* is an original video animation that was released in 1998. Tesshō Genda provides the voice of Golgo 13 in the Japanese version, while in the English version, he is voiced by John DiMaggio.\n\n\n\n#### TV series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *Golgo 13* episodes\n\nA *Golgo 13* anime television series was produced by The Answer Studio and aired on TV Tokyo and other stations from April 11, 2008, to March 27, 2009, for 50 episodes.[32] Hiroshi Tachi provides the voice of Golgo 13. The series was licensed by Sentai Filmworks, with the first DVD released on July 13, 2010.[33] In English, Golgo is voiced by David Wald.\n\n\nThe anime aired in North America on the Anime Network on Demand channel.[34] It is also aired on television in the Philippines by TV5 and in South Korea by Animax Korea.[35]\n\n\nThe first opening theme song is \"Take the Wave\" by Naifu for the first 25 episodes, and the second is \"So Far Away\" by Pinc Inc for the remaining. The first ending theme song for the first 12 episodes is \"Garasu no Haiwei (Highway of Glass)\" by doa,[36] while \"Yume no Hitotsu\" by Garnet Crow is used for episodes 13–25. The third ending theme is \"Sono Egao Yo Eien ni\" by Kitahara Aiko for episodes 26 to 38,[37] and the final ending song is \"Mou Kimi wo Hitori ni Sasenai\" by U-ka Saegusa in dB from 39–50.\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nSeveral video games based on *Golgo 13* have been released: \n\n\n\n* The first *Golgo 13* video game was released for the Sega SG-1000 in 1984, followed by *Golgo 13: Oi no Su* for the MSX in 1985.\n* Two games were released by Vic Tokai on the Nintendo Entertainment System: *Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode* (1988) and *The Mafat Conspiracy* (1990). Both are the only *Golgo 13* games to receive official English releases, with the license intact.\n* Two digital mangas were released only in Japan for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows in 1998; the digital manga features English text option, in addition to Japanese.\n* Namco and Eighting/Raizing developed three lightgun arcade games, similar to the *Silent Scope* series, but with a few differences. The rifle only contained a magnifying lens, not a small monitor like *Silent Scope*. The screen itself would close up on the target only when the sensor on the underside of the rifle base was activated by the player leaning their shoulder into it. Each mission was preceded by an eight- to ten-panel manga briefing. The first two releases, *Golgo 13* in 1999 and *Golgo 13: Kiseki no Dandou* (*Golgo 13: Miraculous Trajectory*) in 2000, ran on Namco System 12 hardware, with the third, *Golgo 13: Juusei no Chinkonka* (*Golgo 13: Requiem of a Gunshot*) in 2001, on Namco System 10 hardware.\n* The most recent *Golgo 13* game, *Golgo 13: File G-13*, was released for the Nintendo DS on June 18, 2009, by Marvelous Entertainment.[38] The game consists of a large quiz mode, featuring questions spanning the forty-year history of *Golgo 13*, as well as several mini-games, including the \"Don't Stand Behind Me\" game, in which the player, as Golgo 13, must punch people who walk up behind him (a reference to the tagline shown at the end of each episode of the 2008 anime, \"Do not stand behind him, if you value your life.\") The game is played holding the DS on its side, also known as \"book style\".\n\n\nThere was also an LCD game based on *Golgo 13* released only in Japan by Popy in 1982, as well as several pachinko and pachislot machines released in Japan between 2001 and 2017,[39] one of which receiving a simulator port for the PlayStation in 2002.\n\n\nA version of Golgo 13's signature weapon, the scoped M16, was released in the Japanese version of *Alliance of Valiant Arms* as a usable weapon.[40]\n\n\n\n### Other media[edit]\n\n\nIn addition, the title character has appeared in a number of TV commercials in Japan, including NEC[41] and Lotte Black Black.[42] There was also a radio drama featuring Masane Tsukayama as Golgo 13.\n\n\nAn Airsoft gun has been made by Tokyo Marui based on the rifle Golgo 13 uses.[43] A figure based on Golgo 13 was released on August 25, 2009.[44][45]\n\n\nIn November 2023, it was reported that the 1971 anime adaptation of *Golgo 13*, allegedly lost for many years, was found and will be broadcast on TV for the first time in over 50 years. It is set to broadcast on BS-TBS, under the title *Golgo 13 Selection*, on December 10–17, 2023; only a few episodes have been recovered.[46][47]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n*Golgo 13* won the 21st Shogakukan Manga Award in the General category in 1975, the Grand Prize at the 2002 Japan Cartoonists Association Awards, and the Special Judges Award at the 50th Shogakukan Manga Awards in 2005.[48][49] With the publication of volume 201 in July 2021, *Golgo 13* was certified as holding the *Guinness World Record* for \"Most volumes published for a single manga series.\"[50] On TV Asahi's Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, *Golgo 13* ranked 36th.[51] *Golgo 13* is one of the works credited with popularizing the *gekiga* movement in Japanese comics, which strives for more realistic and dramatic works. Saito himself is surprised by his series' popularity overseas, because it is firmly rooted in Japanese culture and samurai. He cited the timing of when Golgo actually takes his shot as an example; \"It evokes *iaidō* [the martial art of drawing one's sword and mimicking a deadly blow]. It is the same movement and the same shape. I love Japanese samurai stories and that is why, unconsciously, Golgo moves like a samurai. That is why I thought foreigners wouldn't understand the story.\"[52]\n\n\nBy March 2021, *Golgo 13* had over 300 million copies in circulation in various formats, including compilation books, it is the second-best-selling manga series and the top-selling *seinen* manga series in history.[53]\n\n\nAnime News Network's Carl Kimlinger compared Saito's work on the series to the novels of John le Carré and Frederick Forsyth, as the stories are \"dark, meticulously constructed [and] painstakingly realistic\".[54] Leo Lewis of the *Financial Times* wrote that \"Unsmiling, misogynist and inexorable, [the character] is a literary cousin of James Bond without the scene-softeners of Moneypenny, M, Q or exploding fountain pens.\"[52] The *Daily Vanguard* called Duke \"a badass, something like a cross between Dirty Harry and *Metal Gear Solid*'s Solid Snake.\"[6] JC DuBois of Dragon's Anime has criticized those who say that most of Golgo 13's hits are impossible to do since there are problems that would prevent him from shooting straight such as the wind or with the coriolis effect, saying that the \"whole mystique of *Golgo 13* is that he's just that damn good. He CAN make those shots—and he can do it with one shot.\"[55]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Official Website for Golgo 13\". Viz Media.

It has been serialized in Shogakukan's *shōnen* manga magazine *Weekly Shōnen Sunday* since January 1994, with its chapters collected in 104 *tankōbon* volumes as of October 2023. Due to legal problems with the name *Detective Conan*, the English language releases from Funimation and Viz Media were renamed to *Case Closed*. The story follows the high school detective Shinichi Kudo, whose body was transformed into that of an elementary school-age child while investigating a mysterious organization. Generally, he solves a multitude of cases by impersonating his childhood best friend's father and various other characters.\n\n\nThe manga was adapted into an anime television series by Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation and TMS Entertainment, which premiered in January 1996. The anime resulted in animated feature films, original video animations, video games, audio disc releases and live action episodes. Funimation licensed the anime series for North American broadcast in 2003 under the name *Case Closed* with the characters given Americanized names. The anime premiered on Adult Swim but was discontinued due to low ratings.\n\n\nIn March 2013, Funimation began streaming their licensed episodes of *Case Closed*; Crunchyroll simulcast them in 2014. Funimation also localized the first six *Case Closed* films, while Discotek Media localized the *Lupin III* crossover special, its film sequel, and select recent films, starting with Case Closed *Episode One*. Meanwhile, the manga was localized by Viz Media, which used Funimation's changed title and character names. Shogakukan Asia made its own localized English version of the manga, which used the original title and Japanese names.\n\n\nThe *tankōbon* volumes of the manga had over 270 million copies in circulation worldwide by January 2023, making it the third best-selling manga series of all time. In 2001, the manga was awarded the 46th Shogakukan Manga Award in the *shōnen* category. The anime adaptation has been well received and ranked in the top twenty in *Animage*'s polls between 1996 and 2001.

In an attempt to murder the young detective, they force-fed him a dangerous experimental drug. However, instead of killing him, it shrinks his body into the size of an elementary school child.[3] Adopting the pseudonym Conan Edogawa and keeping his true identity a secret, Kudo lives with his childhood friend Rachel Moore (Ran Mori) and her father Richard (Kogoro Mori), who is a private detective. Throughout the series, he tags along on Richard's cases. Nonetheless, after Kudo solves one, he will use Dr. Agasa's hidden tranquilizer to sedate Richard and then uses a voice changer to simulate his voice to reveal the solution.[4] He also enrolls in Teitan Elementary School where he makes friends with a group of classmates who form their own Junior Detective League (Detective Boys). While he continues to dig deeper into the Black Organization, he frequently interacts with other characters, including his neighbor, Dr. Agasa, Ran's friend Serena Sebastian (Sonoko Suzuki), a fellow teenage detective Harley Hartwell (Heiji Hattori), assorted police detectives from different regions, and a phantom thief called Kaito Kid.\n\n\nKudo later encounters an elementary school transfer student, Anita Hailey (Ai Haibara), who reveals herself to be a former member of the Black Organization under the code name \"Sherry\" and the creator of the experimental drug that shrunk him. She too had ingested it to evade the pursuit of the organization.[5] She soon joins the Junior Detectives. During a rare encounter with the Black Organization, Conan helps the FBI plant a CIA agent, Kir, inside the Black Organization as a spy.[6]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A recreation of Aoyama's workplace at the Gosho Aoyama Manga Factory\n*Case Closed* was conceived in 1994, during the rise of mystery genre manga due to the publishing of the series *The Kindaichi Case Files*; the first chapter appeared in the January 19 issue of Shogakukan's *Weekly Shōnen Sunday*.[7][8] Aoyama cites the stories of Arsène Lupin, Sherlock Holmes and the samurai films by Akira Kurosawa as influences on his work.[9] When scripting each chapter, he ensures the dialogue remains simple and spends an average of four hours for each new case and twelve for more complicated ones.[10][11] Aoyama's older brother is a scientist who helps him out with the \"gimmicks\" in the series.[12] Each case spans several chapters (except for a handful of shorter cases that only span one), and is resolved at the end where characters explain the details of their solutions in simple terms;[13] an online database consisting of all the cases from the manga was launched in 2007.[14][15] In 2007, Aoyama hinted he had an ending planned out but does not intend to end the series yet.[10] Aoyama and his staff decided to computerize their manga creation process in early 2011, although he still draws with a pen and paper.[16][17] The change began with the final page of chapter 760.[17]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *Case Closed* volumes\n\nWritten and illustrated by Gosho Aoyama, *Case Closed* started its serialization in Shogakukan's *shōnen* manga magazine *Weekly Shōnen Sunday* on January 5, 1994.[c] *Case Closed* became the 24th longest running manga series, with over 1000 chapters released in Japan, and the first series with over 1000 chapters published in *Weekly Shōnen Sunday*.[20] Shogakukan has collected its chapters into individual *tankōbon* volumes. The first volume was released on June 18, 1994.[21] On October 18, 2021, the series reached one hundred volumes;[22] *One Piece* author, Eiichiro Oda, whose series achieved the same feat a month before, sent congratulations to Aoyama.[23] As of October 18, 2023, 104 volumes have been published.[24]\n\n\nViz Media announced its acquisition of the series for North America on June 1, 2004.[25] Following Funimation's localization, Viz released the series as *Case Closed* and took their character names to keep consistency between the two media.[26] Viz Media released the first volume in September 2004 and began releasing digital editions in 2013.[27][28] On May 9, 2023, Viz Media launched their *Viz Manga* digital manga service, with the series' chapters receiving simultaneous English publication in North America as they are released in Japan.[29][30] Gollancz licensed and distributed 15 of Viz Media's volumes in the United Kingdom before ceasing publication of manga.

The episodes were listed as \"season one\", although in reality they are episodes 748 to 799. The episodes were only available in Japanese, but were subtitled. The availability was likely part of Netflix's efforts to expand its anime catalog.[89] In January 2021, Netflix removed the episodes. \n\n\nIt was revealed in February 2023 that TMS Entertainment commissioned a new English dub of *Case Closed*, with episodes of the anime beginning streaming on Tubi that same month, starting at episode 965.[90][91] This marked the first English dub for the series since 2010.[92] The dub is produced by Florida-based studio Macias Group with a new dub cast (except for the voices of Shinichi, Conan, Ran, Kogoro, and Kaito Kid, whose voice actors were retained from the Bang Zoom!

Chavez and IGN's A. E. Sparrow for its stories—telling the mysteries and how they were unfolded by the investigations of Conan and gang. Sparrow called the style of the series a mix of Scooby-Doo and Sherlock Holmes, while Chavez believed the manga had appeal to readers of all ages.[219][220] Melissa Sternenberg from *THEM Anime Reviews* gave the series 5 out of 5 stars, she praised its animation and plot, and described it as \"what puts *Detective Conan* as my all-time favorite anime is the superb writing. I soak up *Detective Conan* like a good book, I get so drawn into every episode that everything around me just sinks away and it is just me and the episode. It is engrossing. I can not think of another word for it. Like I said, every episode is fresh, and every mystery that is solved is profound. The kid is a prodigy, and you can not blink while watching an episode of this wonderful series\".[221]\n\n\nActiveAnime's reviewers commented on complex character design and the \"spirit\" that the series has, indicating that fans of serialized mystery shows would rather enjoy it. The series is also said to better suit the more matured audience.[222][223] Lori Lancaster of Mania.com described *Case Closed* as \"a clever series that had mysteries at every corner\", noting the \"bizarre\" and \"interesting\" nature of each case.[224] IGN's Chris Wyatt was positive to the manner the cases were set up, relating them to Agatha Christie's locked-room mysteries. He described the series as \"Inspector Gadget meets Law & Order but in an anime style\".[225]\n\n\nIn the United States, the dubbed series faced several negative reactions toward its changes to localize the content for international English-speaking audiences, mostly North American. Jeffrey Harris of IGN found it pointless to change the names of the characters, and *Anime News Network'*s Carl Kimlinger said that the changes of certain Japanese cultural references rendered several parts of the mysteries and their investigation illogical.[226][227] The voice-overs proved to be a mixed bag for Carlo Santos, who reviewed the first DVD release of *Case Closed* for *Anime News Network*; he said that while the main characters sounded like \"real people\", the secondary ones \"[came] off as caricatures\".[228]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nThe *Case Closed* manga series was awarded the 46th Shogakukan Manga Award in the *shōnen* category in 2001.[229] It respondents in an online poll for Japanese citizens in their mid-twenties voted *Case Closed* as one of the top three manga they wanted to continue running in publication.[230][231][232] In France, the series was nominated for the Angoulême Festival Graphic Novel award among the Japanese selection.[233] The series ranked on About.com's top continuing manga series of 2010, under the title \"Best Underappreciated Gem: Shonen\" category.[234]\n\n\nSeveral of the franchise's films were nominated for awards in their home country.
