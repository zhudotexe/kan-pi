Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(April 2021)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)Motor vehicles produced by country in 2013\nThis is a **list of manufacturers by motor vehicle production**, by year, based on Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles (OICA).\n\n\nFigures include passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, minibuses, trucks, buses and coaches. OICA defines these entries as follows:[1]\n\n\n\n* **Passenger cars** are motor vehicles with at least four wheels, used for the transport of passengers, and comprising no more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat.\n* **Light commercial vehicles** (**LCV**) are motor vehicles with at least four wheels, used for the carriage of goods. Mass given in tons (metric tons) is used as a limit between light commercial vehicles and heavy trucks. This limit depends on national and professional definitions, and it varies between 3.5 and 7 tons. Minibuses, derived from light commercial vehicles, are used for the transport of passengers, comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat and having a maximum mass between 3.5 and 7 tons.\n* **Heavy trucks** (**HCV**) are vehicles intended for the carriage of goods. Maximum authorised mass is over the limit (ranging from 3.5 to 7 tons) of light commercial vehicles. They include tractor vehicles designed for towing semi-trailers.\n* **Buses and coaches** are used for the transport of passengers, comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat, and having a maximum mass over the limit (ranging from 3.5 to 7 tonnes) of light commercial vehicles.\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n**Motor vehicle production by manufacturer (top five groups)**\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.\n |\n\n\nThe summary chart includes the five largest worldwide automotive manufacturing groups as of 2017 by number of vehicles produced. Those same groups have held the top 5 positions since 2007; only Hyundai / Kia had a lower rank until it took the fifth spot in 2007 from the at that time split German-American auto manufacturer DaimlerChrysler. Figures were compiled by the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA):\n2000, \n2001, \n2002, \n2003, \n2004, \n2005, \n2006, \n2007, \n2008, \n2009, \n2010, \n2011, \n2012, \n2013, \n2014, \n2015,\n2016,\n2017.\n\n\n\n* The Toyota group includes Daihatsu and Hino.[2][a]\n* The Volkswagen Group includes VW, Audi, SEAT, Skoda and luxury brands.[3][b]\n* The General Motors group includes GM Korea, formerly Daewoo, since 2005,[7][8] Saab until 2009[9] (sold to Spyker in January 2010),[10] SAIC-GM-Wuling until 2014,[11][12] and Opel and Vauxhall until 2016 (sold to Groupe PSA in 2017 and subsequently owned by Stellantis in 2021).[13]\n* Hyundai and Kia have operated as part of the Hyundai Motor Group since 1998.[c]\n* The Ford group includes Jaguar Land Rover 2000 to

OICA listed Daihatsu (owned to 51.2% by Toyota 1998 to 2016) combined with Toyota in 1998 and 1999 and both Daihatsu and Hino (owned to 50.1% by Toyota since 2001) combined with Toyota in 2000 and again from 2008, but separately 2001 to 2007, although Toyota-Daihatsu-Hino was listed combined in the list of the largest auto manufacturers by year for the years 2001 and 2002.\n2. **^** Truck producers Scania AB and M.A.N. were included by OICA in group totals for 2011[4] and 2012,[5] then removed for the following years;[6] they are excluded from the chart for consistency.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Hyundai and Kia have operated as a group since 1998 when Hyundai first took 51% control of Kia. However, OICA listed their manufacturing figures separately 2006 to 2008; they are combined here for consistency with previous and subsequent years.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Including production figures from the Chinese SAIC-GM-Wuling joint venture,[20] which the OICA left out from the 2015 and 2016 GM total contrary to prior practice; they are combined here to allow for consistent comparison with previous years.\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** FAW production excluding joint ventures with Volkswagen, Toyota and Mazda\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Although General Motors still was the largest automaker by sales by 2007, Toyota (including Daihatsu and Hino) had larger production of vehicles a year than G.M. for the first time already in 2006.\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** Ford owned a 33.4\u00a0% controlling-stake in Mazda 1996 to 2008. OICA, however, lists Mazda separately from Ford. Including Mazda's production, Ford would still be the 2nd-largest auto manufacturer, larger than Toyota (with Daihatsu and Hino), both in 2003 and 2004, as well as the 3rd largest, larger than the Volkswagen Group, in 2007 (and possibly the first half of 2008).\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Including production figures from Nissan Diesel as a Nissan subsidiary until 2006 (sold to Volvo in 2007).\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** DaimlerChrysler was split in 2007. However, OICA began to list them separately already in 2006.\n10. **^** With Mazda: 7,785,307\n11. **^** Dongfeng production excluding joint venture with Citro\u00ebn\n12. **^** BAIC production excluding joint ventures with Hyundai and Isuzu\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** GM Daewoo became a subsidiary of General Motors in 2002.

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(January 2021)*\n |\n\n\nMain article: History of the automobile\n\n![](image)The Thomas B. Jeffery Company automobile factory in Kenosha, Wisconsin around 1916\n![](image)Fiat 1800 and 2100 sedans being assembled at a Fiat factory in 1961\nThe automotive industry began in the 1860s with hundreds of manufacturers pioneering the horseless carriage. Early car manufacturing involved manual assembly by a human worker. The process evolved from engineers working on a stationary car, to a conveyor belt system where the car passed through multiple stations of more specialized engineers. Starting in the 1960s, robotic equipment was introduced to the process, and today most cars are produced largely with automated machinery.[4]\n\n\nFor many decades, the United States led the world in total automobile production, with the U.S. Big Three General Motors, Ford Motor Company and Chrysler being the world's three largest auto manufacturers for a time, and G.M. and Ford remaining the two largest until mid-2000s. In 1929, before the Great Depression, the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, of which more than 90% produced by the U.S. automobile industry. At that time, the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons.[5] After 1945, the U.S. produced around three quarters of world's auto production. In 1980, the U.S. was overtaken by Japan and then became a world leader again in 1994. Japan narrowly passed the U.S. in production the years 2006 and 2007, and in 2008 also China, which in 2009 took the top spot (from Japan) with 13.8 million units, although the U.S. surpassed Japan in 2011, to become the second-largest automobile industry. In 2017, China reached its top record, of more than 29 million produced vehicles, which was the so far largest margin from that of the U.S. From 1970 (140 models) over 1998 (260 models) to 2012 (684 models), the number of automobile models in the U.S. has grown exponentially.[6]\n\n\n\n## Safety[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Automobile safety\n\nSee also: 2009\u201311 Toyota vehicle recalls, General Motors ignition switch recalls, and Firestone and Ford tire controversy\n\n![](image)A 2010 Hyundai Tucson used for a crash test by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\nSafety is a state that implies being protected from any risk, danger, damage, or cause of injury. In the automotive industry, safety means that users, operators, or manufacturers do not face any risk or danger coming from the motor vehicle or its spare parts. Safety for the automobiles themselves implies that there is no risk of damage.\n\n\nSafety in the automotive industry is particularly important and therefore highly regulated. Automobiles and other motor vehicles have to comply with a certain number of regulations, whether local or international, in order to be accepted on the market. The standard ISO 26262, is considered one of the best practice frameworks for achieving automotive functional safety.[7]\n\n\nIn case of safety issues, danger, product defect, or faulty procedure during the manufacturing of the motor vehicle, the maker can request to return either a batch or the entire production run. This procedure is called product recall. Product recalls happen in every industry and can be production-related or stem from raw materials.\n\n\nProduct and operation tests and inspections at different stages of the value chain are made to avoid these product recalls by ensuring end-user security and safety and compliance with the automotive industry requirements. However, the automotive industry is still particularly concerned about product recalls, which cause considerable financial consequences.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Automotive industry by country\n\n![](image)An advertisement for the Pontiac 6, circa 1928\nIn 2007, there were about 806 million cars and light trucks on the road, consuming over 980\u00a0billion litres (980,000,000\u00a0m3) of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly.[8] The automobile is a primary mode of transportation for many developed economies. The Detroit branch of Boston Consulting Group predicted that, by 2014, one-third of world demand would be in the four BRIC markets (Brazil, Russia, India, and China). Meanwhile, in developed countries, the automotive industry has slowed.[9] It is also expected that this trend will continue, especially as the younger generations of people (in highly urbanized countries) no longer want to own a car anymore, and prefer other modes of transport.[10] Other potentially powerful automotive markets are Iran and Indonesia.[11]\nEmerging automobile markets already buy more cars than established markets. \n\n\nAccording to a J.D. Power study, emerging markets accounted for 51 percent of the global light-vehicle sales in 2010. The study, performed in 2010 expected this trend to accelerate.[12][13] However, more recent reports (2012) confirmed the opposite; namely that the automotive industry was slowing down even in BRIC countries.[9] In the United States, vehicle sales peaked in 2000, at 17.8 million units.[14]\n\n\nIn July 2021, the European Commission released its \"Fit for 55\" legislation package,[15] which contains important guidelines for the future of the automotive industry; all new cars on the European market must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035.[16]\n\n\nThe governments of 24 developed countries and a group of major car manufacturers including GM, Ford, Volvo, BYD Auto, Jaguar Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz committed to \"work towards all sales of new cars and vans being zero emission globally by 2040, and by no later than 2035 in leading markets\".[17][18] Major car manufacturing nations like the United States, Germany, China, Japan and South Korea, as well as Volkswagen, Toyota, Peugeot, Honda, Nissan and Hyundai, did not pledge.[19]\n\n\n\n## Environmental impacts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Trucks' share of US vehicles produced, has tripled since 1975. Though vehicle fuel efficiency has increased within each category, the overall trend toward less efficient types of vehicles has offset some of the benefits of greater fuel economy and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions.[20]\nThe global automotive industry is a major consumer of water. Some estimates surpass 180,000\u00a0L (39,000\u00a0imp\u00a0gal) of water per car manufactured, depending on whether tyre production is included. Production processes that use a significant volume of water include surface treatment, painting, coating, washing, cooling, air-conditioning, and boilers, not counting component manufacturing. Paintshop operations consume especially large amounts of water because equipment running on water-based products must also be cleaned with water.[21]\n\n\nIn 2022, Tesla's Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg ran into legal challenges due to droughts and falling groundwater levels in the region. Brandenburg's Economy Minister Joerg Steinbach said that while water supply was sufficient during the first stage, more would be needed once Tesla expands the site. The factory would nearly double the water consumption in the Gruenheide area, with 1.4 million cubic meters being contracted from local authorities per year \u2014 enough for a city of around 40,000 people. Steinbach said that the authorities would like to drill for more water there and outsource any additional supply if necessary.[22]\n\n\n\n## World motor vehicle production[edit]\n\n\nWorld motor vehicle production[23]\n![](image)\nProduction volume (1000 vehicles)\n\n**1960s**: Post-war increase\n\n\n**1970s**: Oil crisis and tighter safety and emission regulation\n\n\n**1990s**: Production started in NICs.\n\n\n**2000s**: Rise of China as a top producer\n\n\n\nAutomotive industry crisis of 2008\u20132010\n![](image)\n**To 1950**: US had produced more than 80% of motor vehicles.[24]\n**1950s**: United Kingdom, Germany, and France restarted production.\n\n\n**1960s**: Japan started production and increased volume through the 1980s.\nUnited States, Japan, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom produced about 80% of motor vehicles through the 1980s.\n\n\n**1990s**: South Korea became a volume producer.

It was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda and incorporated on August 28, 1937. Toyota is the largest automobile manufacturer in the world, producing about 10 million vehicles per year.\n\n\nThe company was originally founded as a spinoff of Toyota Industries, a machine maker started by Sakichi Toyoda, Kiichiro's father. Both companies are now part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the world. While still a department of Toyota Industries, the company developed its first product, the Type A engine, in 1934 and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA.\n\n\nAfter World War II, Toyota benefited from Japan's alliance with the United States to learn from American automakers and other companies, which gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the small company into a leader in the industry and was the subject of many academic studies.\n\n\nIn the 1960s, Toyota took advantage of the rapidly growing Japanese economy to sell cars to a growing middle-class, leading to the development of the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling automobile. The booming economy also funded an international expansion that allowed Toyota to grow into one of the largest automakers in the world, the largest company in Japan and the ninth-largest company in the world by revenue, as of December\u00a02020[update]. Toyota was the world's first automobile manufacturer to produce more than 10 million vehicles per year, a record set in 2012, when it also reported the production of its 200 millionth vehicle. By September 2023, total production reached 300 million vehicles.[3]\n\n\nToyota was praised for being a leader in the development and sales of more fuel-efficient hybrid electric vehicles, starting with the introduction of the Toyota Prius in 1997. The company now sells more than 40 hybrid vehicle models around the world. More recently, the company has also been criticized for being slow to adopt all-electric vehicles and focusing on the development of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, like the Toyota Mirai, a technology that is costlier and has fallen far behind electric batteries.\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the Toyota Motor Corporation produces vehicles under four brands: Daihatsu, Hino, Lexus and the namesake Toyota. The company also holds a 20% stake in Subaru Corporation, a 5.1% stake in Mazda, a 4.9% stake in Suzuki, a 4.6% stake in Isuzu, a 3.8% stake in Yamaha Motor Corporation, and a 2.8% stake in Panasonic, as well as stakes in vehicle manufacturing joint-ventures in China (FAW Toyota and GAC Toyota), the Czech Republic (TPCA), India (Toyota Kirloskar) and the United States (MTMUS).\n\n\nToyota is listed on the London Stock Exchange, Nagoya Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where its stock is a component of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Core30 indices.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Toyota\n\n### 1920s\u20131930s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The mass-produced Toyoda automated loom, displayed at Toyota Museum in Aichi-gun, Japan\nIn 1924, Sakichi Toyoda invented the Toyoda Model G Automatic Loom. The principle of *jidoka*, which means the machine stops itself when a problem occurs, became later a part of the Toyota Production System. Looms were built on a small production line. In 1929, the patent for the automatic loom was sold to the British company Platt Brothers,[4] generating the starting capital for automobile development.[5]\n\n\nUnder the direction of the founder's son, Kiichiro Toyoda,[6][7] Toyoda Automatic Loom Works established an Automobile Division on September 1, 1933, and formally declared its intention to begin manufacturing automobiles on January 29, 1934.[6] A prototype Toyota Type A engine was completed on September 25, 1934, with the company's first prototype sedan, the A1, completed the following May. As Kiichiro had limited experience with automobile production, he initially focused on truck production; the company's first truck, the G1, was completed on August 25, 1935, and debuted on November 21 in Tokyo, becoming the company's first production model.[6][8] Modeled on a period Ford truck, the G1 sold for \u00a52,900, \u00a5200 cheaper than the Ford truck. A total of 379 G1 trucks were ultimately produced.[8]\n\n\nIn April 1936, Toyoda's first passenger car, the Model AA, was completed. The sales price was \u00a53,350, \u00a5400 cheaper than Ford or GM cars.[9] The company's plant at Kariya was completed in May. In July, the company filled its first export order, with four G1 trucks exported to northeastern China.[6] On September 19, 1936, the Japanese imperial government officially designated Toyota Automatic Loom Works as an automotive manufacturer.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 1936 Toyota AA, the first vehicle produced by the company while it was still a department of Toyota Industries\nVehicles were originally sold under the name \"Toyoda\" (\u30c8\u30e8\u30c0), from the family name of the company's founder, Kiichir\u014d Toyoda. In September 1936, the company ran a public competition to design a new logo. Of 27,000 entries, the winning entry was the three Japanese *katakana* letters for \"Toyoda\" in a circle. However, Rizaburo Toyoda, who had married into the family and was not born with that name, preferred \"Toyota\" (\u30c8\u30e8\u30bf) because it took eight brush strokes (a lucky number) to write in Japanese, was visually simpler (leaving off the diacritic at the end), and with a voiceless consonant instead of a voiced one (voiced consonants are considered to have a \"murky\" or \"muddy\" sound compared to voiceless consonants, which are \"clear\").\n\n\nSince *toyoda* literally means \"fertile rice paddies\", changing the name also prevented the company from being associated with old-fashioned farming. The newly formed word was trademarked and the company began trading on August 28, 1937, as the Toyota Motor Company Ltd.[6][10][11][12] Kiichiro's brother-in-law Rizaburo Toyoda was appointed the firm's first president, with Kiichiro as vice-president. Toyota Automatic Loom Works formally transferred automobile manufacturing to the new entity on September 29.[6]\n\n\nThe Japanese government supported the company by preventing foreign competitors Ford and General Motors from importing automobiles into Japan.[13]\n\n\nAt the onset of World War II, Toyota almost exclusively produced standard-sized trucks for the Japanese Army, which paid one-fifth of the price in advance and the remainder in cash upon delivery.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### 1940s[edit]\n\n\nJapan was heavily damaged in World War II and Toyota's plants, which were used for the war effort, were not spared. On August 14, 1945, one day before the surrender of Japan, Toyota's Koromo Plant was bombed by the Allied forces.[16] After the surrender, the U.S.-led occupying forces banned passenger car production in Japan. However, automakers like Toyota were allowed to begin building trucks for civilian use, in an effort to rebuild the nation's infrastructure.[17] The U.S. military also contracted with Toyota to repair its vehicles.[18]\n\n\nBy 1947, there was an emerging global Cold War between the Soviet Union and the U.S., who had been allies in World War II. U.S. priorities shifted (the \"Reverse Course\") from punishing and reforming Japan to ensuring internal political stability, rebuilding the economy, and, to an extent, remilitarizing Japan. Under these new policies, in 1949, Japanese automakers were allowed to resume passenger car production, but at the same time, a new economic stabilization program to control inflation plunged the automotive industry into a serious shortage of funds, while many truck owners defaulted on their loans.[19] Ultimately, the Bank of Japan, the central bank of the country, bailed out the company, with demands that the company institute reforms.[20]\n\n\n\n### 1950s[edit]\n\n\nAs the 1950s began, Toyota emerged from its financial crisis a smaller company, closing factories and laying off workers. At about the same time, the Korean War broke out, and being located so close to the battlefront, the U.S. Army placed an order for 1,000 trucks from Toyota. The order helped to rapidly improve the struggling company's business performance.[21] In 1950, company executives, including Kiichiro's cousin Eiji Toyoda, took a trip to the United States where they trained at the Ford Motor Company and observed the operations of dozens of U.S. manufacturers.[22] The knowledge they gained during the trip, along with what the company learned making looms, gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the company into a leader in the manufacturing industry.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Toyopet Crown, the first vehicle fully designed and built by Toyota\nToyota started developing its first full-fledged passenger car, the Toyopet Crown, in January 1952. Prior to the Crown, Toyota had been outsourcing the design and manufacturing of auto bodies, which were then mounted on truck frames made by Toyota.[24] The project was a major test for Toyota, who would need to build bodies and develop a new chassis that would be comfortable, but still stand up to the muddy, slow, unpaved roads common in Japan at the time.[24] The project had been championed for many years by founder Kiichiro Toyoda, who died suddenly on March 27, 1952. The first prototypes were completed in June 1953 and began extensive testing, before the Crown went on sale in August 1955.[25] The car was met with positive reviews from around the world.\n\n\nAfter the introduction of the Crown, Toyota began aggressively expanding into the export market. Toyota began shipping Land Cruiser knock-down kits to Latin America in November 1955,[26] sending complete Land Cruisers to Burma (now Myanmar) and the Philippines in 1956 as part of war reparations provided by the Japanese government,[27] establishing a branch in Thailand in June 1957,[28] and shipping Land Cruisers to Australia in August 1957.[27] Toyota established a production facility in Brazil in 1958, the company's first outside of Japan.[29]\n\n\nToyota entered the United States market in July 1958, attempting to sell the Toyopet Crown. The company faced problems almost immediately, the Crown was a flop in the U.S. with buyers finding it overpriced and underpowered (because it was designed for the bad roads of Japan, not high-speed performance). In response, exports of the Crown to the United States were suspended in December 1960.[30]\n\n\nAfter Kiichiro's death, his cousin Eiji Toyoda led the company for the two decades. Eiji helped establish the company's first plant independent from the Loom Works plant.[31]\n\n\n\n### 1960s\u20131970s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toyota 2000GT (1967\u20131969)\nAt the start of the 1960s, the Japanese economy was booming, a period that came to be known as the Japanese economic miracle. As the economy grew, so did the income of everyday people, who now could afford to purchase a vehicle. At the same time, the Japanese government heavily invested in improving road infrastructure.[32] To take advantage of the moment, Toyota and other automakers started offering affordable economy cars like the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling automobile.[33][34]\n\n\nToyota also found success in the United States in 1965 with the Toyota Corona compact car, which was redesigned specifically for the American market with a more powerful engine. The Corona helped increase U.S. sales of Toyota vehicles to more than 20,000 units in 1966 (a threefold increase) and helped the company become the third-best-selling import brand in the United States by 1967. Toyota's first manufacturing investment in the United States came in 1972 when the company struck a deal with Atlas Fabricators, to produce truck beds in Long Beach, in an effort to avoid the 25% \"chicken tax\" on imported light trucks. By importing the truck as an incomplete chassis cab (the truck without a bed), the vehicle only faced a 4% tariff.[35] Once in the United States, Atlas would build the truck beds and attach them to the trucks. The partnership was successful and two years later, Toyota purchased Atlas.[36]\n\n\nThe energy crisis of the 1970s was a major turning point in the American auto industry. Before the crisis, large and heavy vehicles with powerful but inefficient engines were common. But in the years after, consumers started demanding high-quality and fuel-efficient small cars. Domestic automakers, in the midst of their malaise era, struggled to build these cars profitably, but foreign automakers like Toyota were well positioned. This, along with growing anti-Japanese sentiment, prompted the U.S. Congress to consider import restrictions to protect the domestic auto industry.\n\n\nThe 1960s also saw the slight opening of the Japanese auto market to foreign companies. In an effort to strengthen Japan's auto industry ahead of the market opening, Toyota purchased stakes in other Japanese automakers. That included a stake in Hino Motors, a manufacturer of large commercial trucks, buses and diesel engines, along with a 16.8 percent stake in Daihatsu, a manufacturer of kei cars, the smallest highway-legal passenger vehicles sold in Japan.[37] That began what became a long-standing partnership between Toyota and the two companies. As part of the partnership, Daihatsu would supply kei cars for Toyota to sell and to a lesser extent Toyota would supply full-sized cars for Daihatsu to sell (a process known as rebadging), allowing both companies to sell a full line-up of vehicles.\n\n\n\n### 1980s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)By the 1980s, the Toyota Corolla was one of the most popular cars in the world and became the world's all-time best-selling automobile.\nAfter the successes of the 1970s, and the threats of import restrictions, Toyota started making additional investments in the North American market in the 1980s. In 1981, Japan agreed to voluntary export restraints, which limited the number of vehicles the nation would send to the United States each year, leading Toyota to establish assembly plants in North America. The U.S. government also closed the loophole that allowed Toyota to pay lower taxes by building truck beds in America.\n\n\nAlso in 1981, Eiji Toyoda stepped down as president and assumed the title of chairman. He was succeeded as president by Shoichiro Toyoda, the son of the company's founder.[31] Within months, Shoichiro started to merge Toyota's sales and production organizations, and in 1982 the combined companies became the Toyota Motor Corporation. The two groups were described as \"oil and water\" and it took years of leadership from Shoichiro to successfully combine them into one organization.[38]\n\n\nEfforts to open a Toyota assembly plant in the United States started in 1980, with the company proposing a joint-venture with the Ford Motor Company. Those talks broke down in July 1981.[39] Eventually in 1984, the company struck a deal with General Motors (GM) to establish a joint-venture vehicle manufacturing plant called NUMMI (New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc.) in Fremont, California.[40] GM saw the joint venture as a way to get access to a quality small car and an opportunity to learn about The Toyota Way and the Toyota Production System. For Toyota, the factory gave the company its first manufacturing base in North America allowing it to avoid any future tariffs on imported vehicles and saw GM as a partner who could show them how to navigate the American labor environment. The plant would be led by Tatsuro Toyoda, the younger brother of company president Shoichiro Toyoda.[41] The first Toyota assembled in America, a white Corolla, rolled off the line at NUMMI on October 7, 1986.[42]\n\n\nToyota received its first Japanese Quality Control Award at the start of the 1980s and began participating in a wide variety of motorsports. Conservative Toyota held on to rear-wheel-drive designs for longer than most; while a clear first in overall production they were only third in production of front-wheel-drive cars in 1983, behind Nissan and Honda. In part due to this, Nissan's Sunny managed to squeeze by the Corolla in numbers built that year.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Lexus LS 400 went on sale in May 1989 and was seen as being largely responsible for the successful launch of Lexus.\nBefore the decade was out, Toyota introduced Lexus, a new division that was formed to market and service luxury vehicles in international markets. Prior to the debut of Lexus, Toyota's two existing flagship models, the Crown and Century, both catered exclusively for the Japanese market and had little global appeal that could compete with international luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar. The company had been developing the brand and vehicles in secret since August 1983, at a cost of over US$1 billion.[44][45] The LS 400 flagship full-size sedan debuted in 1989 to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque.\n\n\n\n### 1990s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Toyota Supra (JZA80) is one of the most recognized Japanese sports cars.\n![](image)Toyota Prius, first generation (NHW10 1997\u20132000)\nIn the 1990s, Toyota began to branch out from producing mostly compact cars by adding many larger and more luxurious vehicles to its lineup, including a full-sized pickup, the T100 (and later the Tundra), several lines of SUVs, a sport version of the Camry, known as the Camry Solara. They would also launch newer iterations of their sports cars, namely the MR2, Celica, and Supra during this era.\n\n\nDecember 1997 saw the introduction of the first-generation Toyota Prius, the first mass-produced gasoline-electric hybrid car.[46] The vehicle would be produced exclusively for the Japanese market for the first two years.\n\n\nWith a major presence in Europe, due to the success of Toyota Team Europe in motorsport, the corporation decided to set up Toyota Motor Europe Marketing and Engineering, TMME, to help market vehicles in the continent. Two years later, Toyota set up a base in the United Kingdom, TMUK, as the company's cars had become very popular among British drivers. Bases in Indiana, Virginia, and Tianjin were also set up.\n\n\nToyota also increased its ownership of Daihatsu during this period. In 1995, Toyota increased its shareholding in the company to 33.4 percent, giving Toyota the ability to veto shareholder resolutions at the annual meeting.[37] In 1998, Toyota increased its holding in the company to 51.2 percent, becoming the majority shareholder.[47]\n\n\nOn September 29, 1999, the company decided to list itself on the New York and London Stock Exchanges.\n\n\nThe later half of the 1990s would also see the Toyoda brothers step back from the company their father had founded. In 1992, Shoichiro Toyoda would shift to become chairman, allowing his brother Tatsuro to become president, a job he held until his retirement in 1995.[41] Shoichiro would step down as chairman in 1999. Both would retain honorary advisory roles in the company. Hiroshi Okuda would lead the company as president from 1995 until 1999 when he became chairman and the President's office would be filled by Fujio Cho.\n\n\n\n### 2000s[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2000, exports began of the Prius.[46] In 2001, Toyota acquired its long time partner, truck and bus manufacturer Hino Motors. In 2002, Toyota entered Formula One competition and established a manufacturing joint venture in France with French automakers Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot. A youth-oriented marque for North America, Scion, was introduced in 2003. Toyota ranked eighth on Forbes 2000 list of the world's leading companies for the year 2005.[48] Also in 2005, Fujio Cho would shift to become chairman of Toyota and would be replaced as president by Katsuaki Watanabe.\n\n\nIn 2007, Toyota released an update of its full-sized truck, the Tundra, produced in two American factories, one in Texas and one in Indiana. *Motor Trend* named the 2007 Toyota Camry \"Car of the Year\" for 2007. It also began the construction of two new factories, one in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, and the other in Blue Springs, Mississippi, USA.\n\n\nThe company was number one in global automobile sales for the first quarter of 2008.[49]\n\n\nToyota was hit by the global financial crisis of 2008 as it was forced in December 2008 to forecast its first annual loss in 70 years.[50] In January 2009, it announced the closure of all of its Japanese plants for 11 days to reduce output and stocks of unsold vehicles.[51]\n\n\nIn October 2009, Toyota announced that they were establishing an office in South Korea and launched the Camry sedan, Camry hybrid, Prius and the RAV4 during the launching event at the Grand Hyatt Seoul.[52]\n\n\nBetween 2009 and 2011, Toyota conducted recalls of millions of vehicles after reports that several drivers experienced unintended acceleration. The recalls were to prevent a front driver's side floor mat from sliding into the foot pedal well, causing the pedals to become trapped and to correct the possible mechanical sticking of the accelerator pedal.[53] At least 37 were killed in crashes allegedly related to unintended acceleration,[54] approximately 9 million cars and trucks were recalled,[55] Toyota was sued for personal injuries and wrongful deaths,[56] paid US$1 billion to settle a class action lawsuit to compensate owners for lost resale value,[57] and paid a US$1.2 billion criminal penalty to the United States government over accusations that it had intentionally hid information about safety defects and had made deceptive statements to protect its brand image.[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)Akio Toyoda was named President of Toyota in 2009, pictured in 2011.\nAmid the unintended acceleration scandal, Katsuaki Watanabe stepped down as company president. He was replaced by Akio Toyoda, grandson of company founder Kiichiro Toyoda, on June 23, 2009. Akio had been with Toyota since 1984, working jobs in production, marketing and product development, and took a seat on the board of directors in 2000.[59] Akio's promotion by the board marked the return of a member of the Toyoda family to the top leadership role for the first time since 1999.[60]\n\n\n\n### 2010s[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Toyota, along with large parts of the Japanese automotive industry, suffered from a series of natural disasters. The 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami led to a severe disruption of the supplier base and a drop in production and exports.[61][62] Severe flooding during the 2011 monsoon season in Thailand affected Japanese automakers that had chosen Thailand as a production base. Toyota is estimated to have lost production of 150,000 units to the tsunami and production of 240,000 units to the floods.\n\n\nOn February 10, 2014, it was announced that Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia by the end of 2017.[63][64] The decision was based on the unfavourable Australian dollar making exports not viable, the high cost of local manufacture, and the high amount of competition in a relatively small local market.[64] The company planned to consolidate its corporate functions in Melbourne by the end of 2017, and retain its Altona plant for other functions. The workforce is expected to be reduced from 3,900 to 1,300.[65] Both Ford Motor Company and General Motors (Holden) followed suit, ending Australian production in 2016 and 2017 respectively.\n\n\nThe automaker narrowly topped global sales for the first half of 2014, selling 5.1 million vehicles in the six months ending June 30, 2014, an increase of 3.8% on the same period the previous year. Volkswagen AG, which recorded sales of 5.07 million vehicles, was close behind.[66]\n\n\nIn August 2014, Toyota announced it would be cutting its spare-parts prices in China by up to 35%. The company admitted the move was in response to a probe foreshadowed earlier in the month by China's National Development and Reform Commission of Toyota's Lexus spare-parts policies, as part of an industry-wide investigation into what the Chinese regulator considers exorbitantly high prices being charged by automakers for spare parts and after-sales servicing.[67]\n\n\nIn November 2015, the company announced that it would invest US$1 billion over the next 5 years into artificial intelligence and robotics research.[68] In 2016, Toyota invested in Uber.[69] In 2020, a corporate governance report showed that Toyota owns 10.25 million shares of Uber, which was valued at $292.46 million as of March 30, 2020. According to Reuters, this was roughly 0.6 per cent of Uber's outstanding shares.[70]\n\n\nIn March 2016, Toyota partnered with Yanmar to create a fiberglass pleasure boat using Yanmar outboard marine diesel engines or Toyota inboard engines.[71]\n\n\nIn August 2016, the company purchased all remaining assets of Daihatsu, making the manufacturer of small cars a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota.[72]\n\n\nOn August 27, 2018, Toyota announced an investment of US$500 million in Uber's autonomous cars.[73]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Toyota backed the Trump Administration's proposal that federal authority should override California's ability to set its own emissions standards for automobiles. The proposal would reduce California's 2025 fuel efficiency standard from about 54.5 to 37 MPG.[74] This shift by Toyota away from fuel efficiency damaged the company's reputation as a green brand.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### 2020s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toyota Showroom in Shenzhen, China\nBy 2020, Toyota reclaimed its position as the largest automaker in the world, surpassing Volkswagen.[77] It sold 9.528 million vehicles globally despite an 11.3% drop in sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[77] This includes subsidiaries Daihatsu and Hino Motors.[77][78]\n\n\nOn April 2, 2020, BYD and Toyota announced a new joint venture between the two companies called BYD Toyota EV Technology Co., Ltd., with the aim of \"developing BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) that appeal to customers.\"[79]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Toyota, its subsidiary Hino, and Isuzu announced the creation of a strategic partnership between the three companies. Toyota acquired a 4.6% stake in Isuzu while the latter plans to acquire Toyota shares for an equivalent value. The three companies said they would form a new joint venture by April called Commercial Japan Partnership Technologies Corporation with the aim of developing fuel cell and electric light trucks. Toyota would own an 80% stake in the venture while Hino and Isuzu would own 10% each.[80]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Toyota said that it will buy Lyft's self-driving technology unit for $550 million and merge it with its newly created Woven Planet Holdings automation division.[81]\n\n\nIn June 2021, the company defended its donations to the United States Republican lawmakers after they voted against certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election, saying it did not believe it was \"appropriate to judge members of Congress\" for that one vote.[82] A report by Axios found that Toyota was the top donor to 2020 election objectors, by a substantial margin.[83] The company then reversed course in July 2021 and ceased donations to election objectors, releasing a statement saying it understood that its PAC's donations to those objectors, which far outpaced those of any other company, \"troubled some stakeholders.\"[84] Toyota resumed donations after a six-month pause.[85]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Toyota announced that it would invest \u00a58,000,000,000,000 ($70 billion at 2021 exchange rate) in electric vehicles by 2030, launch 30 EV models worldwide by that year, and set a sales target of 3.5 million electric vehicles in 2030.[86]\n\n\nToyota will increase its software engineer intake to around 40% to 50% of all technical hires from the second quarter of 2022, the move plans to address a transformation to so-called CASE \u2014 connected, autonomous, shared and electric \u2014 technologies in an environment of intensifying global competition.[87]\n\n\nIn 2021, Toyota told some of its suppliers to increase their semiconductor inventory levels from the conventional three months to five months in response to the COVID-19 chip shortage.[88] The \"just-in-time\" supply chain in which parts are only delivered when necessary, had already been revised after the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami in Japan, lifting inventories across the entire procurement network.[88] The time it takes Toyota to turn over its inventory increased by around 40% during the past ten years, to 36.36 days as of March\u00a02021[update].[88]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Toyota recalled 2,700 of its first mass-produced all-electric vehicles due to worries that their wheels could fall off during driving. It was discovered that the bolts on the bZ4X's wheels could loosen up to the point where the wheel simply detaches from the car, causing a loss of control over the vehicle and possible accident.[89]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Toyota pledged up to $5.6 billion towards production of electric vehicle battery production and announced an increase in investment in its plant near Greensboro, North Carolina.[90][91] Also in 2022, Toyota managed to maintain its position as the world's best-selling automaker for the third year in a row.[92][93]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Toyota CEO and President Akio Toyoda announced that he was stepping down and passing the position on to Koji Sato. Akio is the great-grandson of company founder Rizaburo Toyoda. Sato had previously run Lexus, Toyota's luxury car brand. The change is set to take effect on April 1, 2023.[94][95]\n\n\n\n## Board of directors[edit]\n\n\n* Chairman: Akio Toyoda (since April 2023)\n* Vice chairman: Shigeru Hayakawa\n* President & CEO: Koji Sato (since April 2023)\n* Members:\n\t+ Takeshi Uchiyamada\n\t+ James Kuffner\n\t+ Kenta Kon\n\t+ Masahiko Maeda\n\t+ Ikuro Sugawara\n\t+ Sir Philip Craven\n\t+ Teiko Kudo\n\n\n### List of former chairmen[edit]\n\n\n*In 1950, Toyota was split into Toyota Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Sales Co.

With continued refinement, the Hilux (simply known as the Pickup in some markets) became famous for being extremely durable and reliable.[109] Extended cab and crew cab versions were eventually added, and Toyota continues to produce them today under various names depending on the market in various cab lengths, with gasoline or diesel engines, and 2WD and 4WD versions.\n\n\nIn North America, the Hilux became a major model for the company, leading the company to launch the Tacoma in 1995.[110] The Tacoma was based on the Hilux, but with a design intended to better suit the needs of North American consumers who often use pickup trucks as personal vehicles. The design was a success and the Tacoma became the best-selling compact pickup in North America.\n\n\nAfter the success of its compact Hilux pickups in North America, Toyota decided to enter the full-size pickup market, which was traditionally dominated by domestic automakers. The company introduced the T100 for the 1993 US model year. The T100 had a full-size 8-foot (2.4\u00a0m) long bed, but suspension and engine characteristics were similar to that of a compact pickup. Sales were disappointing and the T100 was criticized for having a small V6 engine (especially compared to the V8 engines common in American full-size trucks), lacking an extended-cab version, being too small, and too expensive (because of the 25% tariff on imported trucks).[111] In 1995, Toyota added the more powerful V6 engine from the new Tacoma to the T100 and also added an extended cab version.[111] In 1999, Toyota replaced the T100 with the larger Tundra, which would be built in the US with a V8 engine and styling that more closely matched other American full-size trucks.[112]\n\n\n\n### Luxury vehicles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lexus\n\n![](image)Toyota Crown RS (fifteenth generation, S220; 2018)\nIn the Japanese home market, Toyota has two flagship models: the Crown premium sedan and the Century limousine.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Toyota wanted to expand its luxury car offerings but realized that existing Japanese-market flagship models had little global appeal and could not compete with established brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar or the Acura and Infiniti marquees being launched by Japanese competitors.\n\n\nBefore the decade was out, Toyota introduced Lexus, a new division that was formed to market and service luxury vehicles in markets outside of Japan. The company developed the brand and its vehicles in secret since August 1983, at a cost of over US$1 billion.[44][45] The Lexus LS flagship full-size sedan debuted in 1989 to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque. Subsequently, the division added sedan, coup\u00e9, convertible and SUV models.\n\n\nThe Lexus brand was introduced to the Japanese market in 2005, previously all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 to 2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque.\n\n\n\n### Buses[edit]\n\n\nThe Toyota Coaster is a minibus introduced in 1969 that seats 17 passengers. The Coaster is widely used in Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Australia, but also in the developing world for minibus operators in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, the Caribbean, and South America to operate as public transportation.\n\n\n\n## Technology[edit]\n\n\n### Hybrid electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Hybrid Synergy Drive and Toyota Prius\n\n![](image)The Toyota Prius, flagship of Toyota's hybrid technology, is the world's best-selling hybrid car.\nToyota is the world's leader in sales of hybrid electric vehicles, one of the largest companies to encourage the mass-market adoption of hybrid vehicles across the globe, and the first to commercially mass-produce and sell such vehicles, with the introduction of the Toyota Prius in 1997.[113][114] The company's series hybrid technology is called Hybrid Synergy Drive, and it was later applied to many vehicles in Toyota's product lineup, starting first with the Camry and the technology was also brought to the luxury Lexus division.\n\n\nAs of January\u00a02020[update], Toyota Motor Corporation sells 44 Toyota and Lexus hybrid passenger car models in over 90 countries and regions around the world, and the carmaker has sold over 15 million hybrid vehicles since 1997.[115] The Prius family is the world's top-selling hybrid gasoline-electric vehicle nameplate with almost 4 million units sold worldwide as of January 2017.[115]\n\n\n\n### Hydrogen fuel-cell[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Toyota Mirai\n\n![](image)The Toyota Mirai fuel-cell vehicle\n![](image)The Toyota SORA fuel-cell bus\nIn 2002, Toyota began a development and demonstration program to test the Toyota FCHV, a hybrid hydrogen fuel cell vehicle based on the Toyota Highlander production SUV. Toyota also built a FCHV bus based on the Hino Blue Ribbon City low-floor bus.[116][117] Toyota has built several prototypes/concepts of the FCHV since 1997, including the Toyota FCHV-1, FCHV-2, FCHV-3, FCHV-4, and Toyota FCHV-adv. The Toyota FCV-R fuel cell concept car was unveiled at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show. The FCV-R sedan seats four and has a fuel cell stack including a 70 MPa high-pressure hydrogen tank, which can deliver a range of 435\u00a0mi (700\u00a0km) under the Japanese JC08 test cycle. Toyota said the car was planned for launch in about 2015.[118]\n\n\nIn August 2012, Toyota announced its plans to start retail sales of a hydrogen fuel-cell sedan in California in 2015. Toyota expects to become a leader in this technology.[119] The prototype of its first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle will be exhibited at the November 2013 Tokyo Motor Show, and in the United States at the January 2014 Consumer Electronics Show.[120]\n\n\nToyota's first hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles to be sold commercially, the Toyota Mirai (Japanese for \"future\"), was unveiled at the November 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show.[121] In January 2015, it was announced that production of the Mirai fuel cell vehicle would increase from 700 units in 2015 to approximately 2,000 in 2016 and 3,000 in 2017.[122] Sales in Japan began on December 15, 2014, at a price of \u00a56,700,000 (~US$57,400). The Japanese government plans to support the commercialization of fuel-cell vehicles with a subsidy of \u00a52,000,000 (~US$19,600).[123] Retail sales in the U.S. began in August 2015 at a price of US$57,500 before any government incentives. Initially, the Mirai will only be available in California.[124][125] The market release in Europe is slated for September 2015, and initially will be available only in the UK, Germany, and Denmark, followed by other countries in 2017. Pricing in Germany starts at \u20ac60,000 (~US$75,140) plus VAT (\u20ac78,540).[126]\n\n\nIn 2015, Toyota released 5,600 patents for free use until 2020, hoping to promote global development of hydrogen fuel-cell technology.[127][128][129][130]\n\n\nSince the mid-2010s, Toyota has increased its focus on building hydrogen powered trucks. It first showcased a heavy-duty semi-truck tractor in 2017[131] and in 2023 announced a kit to convert existing diesel-powered truck engines to use hydrogen.[132] In late 2022, the company signed an \u00a311.3 million government deal with the UK's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to help it develop a hydrogen-powered Hilux pickup truck.[133]\n\n\n\n### Plug-in hybrids[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid and Toyota RAV4 Prime\n\n![](image)Second-generation Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid\nThe Prius Plug-In Hybrid Concept was exhibited in late 2009, and shortly after, a global demonstration program involving 600 pre-production test cars began. The vehicles were leased to fleet and government customers, and were equipped with data tracking devices to allow Toyota to monitor the car's performance. The vehicle was based on the third-generation Toyota Prius and outfitted with two additional lithium-ion batteries beyond the normal hybrid battery pack.[134] The additional batteries were used to operate the car with minimal use of the internal combustion engine until they are depleted, at which point they are disengaged from the system. They are not used in tandem with the main hybrid battery pack.\n\n\nAfter the conclusion of the demonstration program, the production version of the Prius Plug-in Hybrid was unveiled in September 2011. The production Prius Plug-in had a maximum electric-only speed of 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the vehicle as having an range of 18 kilometres (11\u00a0mi) in blended mode (mostly electric, but supplemented by the internal combustion engine).[135] Toyota ultimately only did a small production run with 75,400 vehicles being produced between 2012 and 2016.[136]\n\n\nThe second-generation Prius Plug-in (renamed the Prius Prime in the US) was unveiled in early 2016.[137] Unlike the prior generation, where the plug-in battery was limited by being added to the existing Prius, this model would be developed in tandem with the fourth-generation Prius, allowing Toyota to increase the range to 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi), with a top speed of 135\u00a0km/h (84\u00a0mph), without needing the assistance of the internal combustion engine.[138] The second-generation Prius Plug-in went on sale starting in late 2016, with Toyota expecting to sell up to 60,000 units globally per year.[139]\n\n\nA second plug-in hybrid model, the Toyota RAV4 PHV (RAV4 Prime in the US) was unveiled in December 2019. The vehicle has an EPA-estimated 68 kilometres (42\u00a0mi) of all-electric range and generates a combined 225 kilowatts (302\u00a0hp), enabling it to be Toyota's second fastest car currently in production (behind the GR Supra 3.0 sports car).[140] Sales started in mid-2020.\n\n\n\n### Battery electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toyota bZ4X\nToyota has been criticized for being slow to add battery electric vehicles to its lineup. It has been publicly skeptical of battery-electric vehicles, instead focusing on hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles,[141] and actively lobbying against government mandates to transition to zero-emissions vehicles.[142]\n\n\nAs of 2023[update], only a small only a small proportion of the vehicles the company sells are of battery electric, which has prompted criticism by some environmental and public interest groups.[143][144] The company plans to increase its sales of electric vehicles to 3.5 million per year by 2030.[86] However, the company has stated that it believes other technologies, including hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, will continue to play a role in the future of the company.[145][146]\n\n\nToyota created the first generation Toyota RAV4 EV (Electric Vehicle) as a compliance car after the California Air Resources Board mandated in the late 1990s that every automaker offer a zero-emissions vehicle.[147][148] A total of 1,484 were leased and/or sold in California from 1997 to 2003, when the state dropped its mandate under legal pressure from lawsuits filed by automakers.[149]\n\n\nA second generation of the RAV4 EV was developed in 2010 as part of a deal with Tesla. The production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from Tesla.[150][151] The RAV4 EV had a limited production run with just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014.[152][153] According to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was \"marred by clashes between engineers\".[154]\n\n\nStarting in 2009, Toyota introduced three generations of concept electric vehicles called the FT-EV built on a modified Toyota iQ platform. In late-2012, the company announced plans build a production version of the car called the Toyota iQ EV (Scion iQ EV in the US, Toyota eQ in Japan),[155] but ultimately production was cut back to 100 cars for special fleet use in Japan and the U.S. only.[141]\n\n\nIn late 2012, Toyota announced that it would back away from fully electric vehicles, after producing less than 5,000. At the time, the company's vice chairman, Takeshi Uchiyamada, said: \"*The current capabilities of electric vehicles do not meet society's needs, whether it may be the distance the cars can run, or the costs, or how it takes a long time to charge*.\"\n\n\nA shift in Toyota's formerly battery-agnostic posture could be seen as early as 2016, when Toyota's CFO Takahiko Ijichi \u201csent a strong signal that Toyota soon plans to jump on the battery bandwagon and make electric cars despite expressing skeptical views about their range and charging times,\u201d as the Wall Street Journal wrote.[156] Toyota said it would make and sell battery-electric vehicles if and where regulations and markets demand.\n\n\nA year later, Toyota outlined its electric-vehicle plans for between 2020 and 2030 to the press in Tokyo, saying it would introduce \"more than 10\" battery-electric vehicles worldwide by the early 2020s, beginning in China, and later in Japan, Europe, the US and India.[157]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Toyota introduced the C-HR EV, its first mass-produced pure electric model in China along with an identical twin called the IZOA EV.[158] It went on sale in April 2020 and May 2020 respectively. Nikkei reported in October 2020 that Toyota had only sold less than 2,000 units in the first eight months of the year.[159]\n\n\nToyota introduced the C+pod in late 2020, a 2-seater kei car with an estimated range of 100 kilometres (62\u00a0mi) and a top speed of 60 kilometres per hour (37\u00a0mph).[160][161]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda stated that electric cars are excessively \"hyped\" and that, in Japan, they would not necessarily reduce carbon dioxide emissions since electricity is mostly generated by burning coal and natural gas in the country. He also said that the infrastructure needed for Japan to switch fully to EVs would cost between $135 billion and $358 billion and switching only to EVs would cost millions of jobs and make cars less affordable.[162]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Toyota revealed the bZ4X, an electric crossover SUV that will be the first vehicle built on a dedicated electric platform called e-TNGA when it goes on sale in mid-2022.[163] It is the first model of the bZ (\"beyond Zero\") series of battery electric vehicles.[164] The company has also stated that there will be seven \"bZ\" models to be launched globally out of 15 BEV models by 2025.[165]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Transport & Environment ranked Toyota as the least ready OEM to transition to battery electric vehicles by 2030, stating: \"Toyota has not set a target for 2030 and it plans to produce just 10% BEVs in 2025. It is expected to rely on polluting hybrid technologies.\"[166]\n\n\n\n![](image)Akio Toyoda shows prototypes of 15 BEVs during Toyota's briefing on BEV strategies in December 2021.\nIn December 2021, Toyota announced in Tokyo plans for 30 battery-electric models by 2030, to sell 3.5 million BEVs per year by that date, and that its premium-brand Lexus will be 100% battery-operated by 2030 in North America, Europe, and China. The company announced investments of $70 billion into the company's electrification.[167]\n\n\nIn a session in parallel with the G-7 Meeting 2023 May, Akio Toyoda said that battery electric vehicles are not solely the future, instead offering a mix of battery electric, internal combustion engine-equipped and hydrogen cars.[144]\n\n\nToyota has been developing solid-state batteries in partnership with Panasonic, in which the company has more than a thousand patents covering solid-state batteries by late 2020.[168] The technology has been implemented on the Toyota LQ concept. Toyota hopes the technology could increase efficiency of battery electric vehicles by 30 percent, which in turn would reduce battery costs by the same amount.[168]\n\n\n\n### Autonomous vehicles[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Woven by Toyota, Inc.\n\n![](image)Toyota e-Palette\nToyota has is also regarded as lagging when it comes to developing smart car technology.[169] Although the company unveiled its first self-driving test vehicle in 2017, and has been developing its own self-driving technology named \"Chauffeur\" (intended for full self-driving) and \"Guardian\" (a driver assist system), neither of these has been introduced into any production vehicles.[170]\n\n\nThe company had set up a large research and development operation by 2018, spending almost US$4 billion to start an autonomous vehicle research institute in California's Silicon Valley[169] and another \u00a5300 billion on a similar research institute in Tokyo that would partner with fellow Toyota Group companies and automotive suppliers Aisin Seiki and Denso.[171][172]\n\n\nToyota has also been collaborating with autonomous vehicle technology developers and, in some cases, purchasing the companies. Toyota has acquired the autonomous vehicle division of ride-hailing service Lyft for $550 million,[173] invested a total of US$1 billion in competing ride-hailing service Uber's self-driving vehicle division,[174][175] invested $400 million in autonomous vehicle technology company Pony.ai,[176] and announced a partnership with Chinese electronics e-commerce company Cogobuy to build a \"Smart Car Ecosystem.\"[177]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Toyota showcased the 20-passenger \"e-Palette\" shared autonomous vehicle, which was used at the 2021 Tokyo Olympic Games.[178][179] Toyota has announced it intends to have the vehicle available for commercial applications before 2025.[180]\n\n\nSince February 2021, Toyota has been building the \"Woven City\" which it calls a \"175-acre high tech, sensor-laden metropolis\" at the foot of Mount Fuji. When completed in 2024, the Woven City will be used to run tests on autonomous vehicles for deliveries, transport and mobile shops, with the city's residents participating in the living laboratory experiment.[181][182]\n\n\n\n## Motorsports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota in motorsport\n\nSee also: Toyota Gazoo Racing and Toyota Racing Development\n\n![](image)The Toyota TS050 Hybrid that won the 2018 24 Hours of Le Mans, preserved with dirt from the race\nToyota has been involved in many global motorsports series, providing vehicles, engines and other auto parts under both the Toyota and Lexus brands.\n\n\nToyota Gazoo Racing (GR) is Toyota's performance brand that is used in many of the world's major motorsports contests. Toyota Gazoo Racing Europe, based in Cologne, Germany, competes in the FIA World Endurance Championship, while the Finland-based Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT participates in the FIA World Rally Championship. Toyota Gazoo Racing South Africa competes in the Dakar Rally. Between 2002 and 2009, the Toyota Racing team competed in Formula One. Toyota won the highest class of the 24 Hours of Le Mans 5 consecutive times from 2018 to 2022, competing with the Toyota TS050 Hybrid and Toyota GR010 Hybrid.\n\n\nToyota Racing Development USA (TRD USA) is responsible for participation in major motorsports contests in the United States including NASCAR, NHRA, Indy Racing League and Formula Drift.\n\n\nToyota also makes engines and other auto parts for other Japanese motorsports including Super Formula, Super GT, Formula 3, and Toyota Racing Series.\n\n\n\n## Non-automotive activities[edit]\n\n\n### Aerospace[edit]\n\n\nToyota is a minority shareholder in Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation, having invested US$67.2\u00a0million in the new venture which will produce the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, slated for first deliveries in 2017.[183] Toyota has also studied participation in the general aviation market and contracted with Scaled Composites to produce a proof of concept aircraft, the TAA-1, in 2002.[184][185]\n\n\n\n### Pleasure boats[edit]\n\n\nIn 1997, building on a previous partnership with Yamaha Marine, Toyota created \"Toyota Marine\",[186] building private ownership motorboats, currently sold only in Japan. A small network in Japan sells the luxury craft at 54 locations, called the \"Toyota Ponam\" series, and in 2017, a boat was labeled under the Lexus brand name starting May 26, 2017.[187]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Toyota Municipal Museum of Art in Aichi, sponsored by the manufacturer\nToyota supports a variety of philanthropic work in areas such as education, conservation, safety, and disaster relief.\n\n\nSome of the organizations that Toyota has worked with in the US include the American Red Cross, the Boys and Girls Club, Leaders in Environmental Action for the Future (LEAF), and the National Center for Family Literacy.[188]\n\n\nThe Toyota USA Foundation exists to support education in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.[189]\n\n\nIn addition, Toyota works with nonprofits to improve their processes and operations such as the Food Bank For New York City.[190][191]\n\n\nToyota also supports a variety of work in Japan.[192]\n\n\nThe Toyota Foundation takes a global perspective providing grants in the three areas of human and natural environments, social welfare, and education and culture.[193]\n\n\n\n### Higher education[edit]\n\n\nToyota established the Toyota Technological Institute in 1981, as Sakichi Toyoda had planned to establish a university as soon as he and Toyota became successful. Toyota Technological Institute founded the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago in 2003. Toyota is supporter of the Toyota Driving Expectations Program, Toyota Youth for Understanding Summer Exchange Scholarship Program, Toyota International Teacher Program, Toyota TAPESTRY, Toyota Community Scholars (scholarship for high school students), United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Internship Program, and Toyota Funded Scholarship.[194] It has contributed to a number of local education and scholarship programs for the University of Kentucky, Indiana, and others.[194]\n\n\n\n### Robotics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota Partner Robot\n\n![](image)Toyota trumpet-playing robot\nIn 2004, Toyota showcased its trumpet-playing robot.[195] Toyota has been developing multitask robots destined for elderly care, manufacturing, and entertainment. A specific example of Toyota's involvement in robotics for the elderly is the Brain Machine Interface. Designed for use with wheelchairs, it \"allows a person to control an electric wheelchair accurately, almost in real-time\", with his or her mind.[196] The thought controls allow the wheelchair to go left, right, and forward with a delay between thought and movement of just 125\u00a0milliseconds.[196] Toyota also played a part in the development of Kirobo, a 'robotic astronaut'.\n\n\nIn 2017, the company introduced T-HR3, a humanoid robot with the ability to be remotely controlled. The robot can copy the motions of a connected person. The 2017 version used wires for the connection but the 2018 version used 5G from a distance up to 10\u00a0km.[197][198]\n\n\n\n### Agricultural biotechnology[edit]\n\n\nToyota invests in several small start-up businesses and partnerships in biotechnology, including:\n\n\n\n* P.T. Toyota Bio Indonesia in Lampung, Indonesia\n* Australian Afforestation Pty. Ltd. in Western Australia and Southern Australia\n* Toyota Floritech Co., Ltd. in Rokkasho-Mura, Kamikita District, Aomori Prefecture\n* Sichuan Toyota Nitan Development Co., Ltd. in Sichuan, China\n* Toyota Roof Garden Corporation in Miyoshi-Cho, Aichi Prefecture\n\n\n### Sewing machine brand[edit]\n\n\nAisin, another member of the Toyota Group of companies, uses the same Toyota wordmark logo to market its home-use sewing machines. Aisin was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda after he founded the Toyota Motor Corporation. According to Aisin, he was so pleased with the first sewing machine, he decided to apply the same Toyota branding as his auto business, despite the companies being independent from each other.[199]\n\n\n\n### Carbon removal[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Carbon capture and utilization, Carbon footprint, Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, and Heterogeneous catalysis\n\nToyota Ventures, along with JetBlue Technology Ventures and Parley for the Oceans, is among the corporate investors that have invested $40 million in the Air Company, a carbon negative vodka distiller and perfume and hand sanitizer manufacturer that uses heterogeneous catalysis to convert captured carbon into ethanol.[200]\n\n\n\n### Environmental initiatives[edit]\n\n\nToyota states it is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and it has set a goal to reduce its overall carbon emissions by 90% by 2050, compared to 2010 levels.[201][202]\n\n\nThe company has invested heavily in solar energy, with a goal to install solar panels on the rooftops of all its dealerships worldwide by 2050.[203] In addition, Toyota has partnered with various renewable energy companies to promote the use of wind and solar power, including a recent partnership with ENEOS Corporation to develop hydrogen refueling stations in Japan.[204]\n\n\nToyota has launched a program called \"Global Environmental Challenge\" 2050 which is a comprehensive initiative aimed at reducing the environmental impact of Toyota's operations. The challenge includes six environmental goals that Toyota aims to achieve by 2050, including reducing carbon emissions, minimizing water usage, promoting the recycling and reuse of materials, and promoting the use of renewable energy.[205] The company has also implemented a variety of initiatives to promote sustainability across its supply chain, including efforts to reduce waste, water usage, and promote sustainable agriculture. For example, Toyota has implemented a zero-waste initiative at its manufacturing plants, aiming to send zero waste to landfills.[206]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Corrosion lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2016, Toyota agreed to pay $3.4 billion to settle allegations that roughly one-and-a-half million of its Tacoma, Tundra, and Sequoia pickup trucks and SUVs had been outfitted with frames prone to corrosion and perforation. According to court papers, the corrosion could reach levels high enough to compromise the vehicle's structural integrity.[207]\n\n\n\n### Death from overwork[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Kar\u014dshi\n\nOn February 9, 2002, Kenichi Uchino, aged 30 years, a quality control manager, collapsed then died at work.[208][209] On January 2, 2006, an unnamed chief engineer of the Camry Hybrid, aged 45 years, died from heart failure in his bed.[208]\n\n\n\n### Fines for environmental breaches[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Toyota was fined $34 million for violating the United States Clean Air Act, as 2.2 million vehicles it sold had defective smog-control computers.[210]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Toyota was fined $180 million for delays in reporting emissions-related defects to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) between 2005 and 2015.[76][211][212] The acting U.S. attorney said that the delays \"likely led to delayed or avoided emissions-related recalls\", although Toyota stated that despite the delays in reporting the issues to the EPA, it had notified customers and fixed the cars with the emissions defects.[212] At the time, this was the biggest civil penalty ever levied for violating the EPA's emission reporting requirements.[76][211]\n\n\n\n### 2009\u20132011 unintended acceleration recalls[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2009\u20132011 Toyota vehicle recalls\n\nBetween 2009 and 2011 Toyota, under pressure from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), conducted recalls of millions of vehicles after reports that several drivers experienced unintended acceleration. The first recall, in November 2009, was to prevent a front driver's side floor mat from sliding into the foot pedal well, causing the pedals to become trapped. The second recall, in January 2010, was begun after some crashes were shown not to have been caused by floor mats and may be caused by possible mechanical sticking of the accelerator pedal.[53] Worldwide, approximately 9 million cars and trucks were impacted by the recalls.[55]\n\n\nNHTSA received reports of a total of 37 deaths allegedly related to unintended acceleration, although an exact number was never verified.[54] As a result of the problems, Toyota faced nearly 100 lawsuits from the families of those killed, drivers who were injured, vehicle owners who lost resale value, and investors who saw a drop in the value of their shares. While most of the personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits were settled confidentially,[56] Toyota did spend more than US$1 billion to settle a class action lawsuit to compensate owners for lost resale value,[57] and the company agreed to pay a US$1.2 billion criminal penalty to the United States government over accusations that it had intentionally hid information about safety defects from the public and had made deceptive statements to protect its brand image. The penalty was the largest ever levied against a car company.[58]\n\n\n\n### Takata airbag recalls[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Takata airbag recalls\n\nToyota was impacted by a recall of faulty airbag inflators made by Takata. The inflators can explode, shooting metal fragments into the vehicle cabin. Millions of vehicles produced between 2000 and 2014 were impacted by the recall, with some needing multiple repairs.[213][214]\n\n\n\n### June 2010 Chinese labour strike[edit]\n\n\nOn June 21, 2010, a Chinese labor strike happened in Tianjin Toyoda Gosei Co, Tianjin. Workers demanded better wages and treatment.[215]\n\n\n\n### Extremist usage[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, U.S. officials asked Toyota how the Islamic State was in possession of so many Toyota trucks.[216] Toyota cars have also been documented to have been used by other extremist organizations such as the Taliban, Hamas, Al-shabab and Somali pirates.[217][218][219] Toyota representatives have said the company has a strict policy of to not sell vehicles to potential purchasers who may use or modify them for paramilitary or terrorist activities and that it cannot track aftermarket sales and that it has worked with the U.S Treasury to brief them on Toyota's supply chain on the Middle East.[220]\n\n\n\n### Misleading marketing[edit]\n\n\nIn its marketing, Toyota has often referred to its non-plug-in hybrid vehicles as \"self-charging hybrid\" vehicles. The use of the term has caused some criticism that this is misleading, as some consumers were led to erroneously believe that these vehicles charge their batteries on their own when the vehicles are not used.[221][222] Complaints about self-charging hybrid advertising were recorded in Ireland, although the complaints were rejected by the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland.[223] However, in 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Authority banned the adverts outright in Norway, stating: \"It is misleading to give the impression that the power to the hybrid battery is free of charge, since the electricity produced by the car has consumption of gasoline as a necessary condition.\"[224]\n\n\nElectric vehicle website IrishEVs criticised Toyota Ireland for paying University College Dublin to conduct a study of only seven examples of their hybrid cars over seven days to make a press release about the efficiency of the vehicles.[225][226] The website also criticised Toyota Ireland for using opinion polls to substantiate a claim about their CO2 emissions on Twitter.[227]\n\n\n\n### Rigging of crash test results[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2023, it was revealed that Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu had cheated by rigging some models to perform better in crash tests than actual production cars. The vehicles in question had a notch in the interior panel of the front door which avoided the possibility of the collision creating a sharp edge that could have injured an occupant when the side airbag deployed. This notch was present on the tested vehicles but not on vehicles sold to the public.[228]\n\n\nThe issue affected four models, the Toyota Yaris Ativ (also known as the Vios), Perodua Axia, Toyota Agya, and an undisclosed upcoming product. No recall was conducted over the issue.[228]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Principal headquarters building of Toyota\nToyota is headquartered in the city of Toyota,[229] which was named Koromo until 1951, when it changed its name to match the automaker. Toyota City is located in the Aichi Prefecture of Japan. The main headquarters of Toyota is located in a four-story building that has been described as \"modest\".[230] In 2013, company CEO Akio Toyoda reported that it had difficulties retaining foreign employees at the headquarters due to the lack of amenities in the city.[231]\n\n\nSurrounding the headquarters are the 14-story Toyota Technical Center and the Honsha plant (which was established in 1938). Toyota and its Toyota Group affiliates operate a total of 17 manufacturing facilities in Aichi Prefecture and a total of 32 plants in Japan.\n\n\nToyota also operates offices in Bunkyo, Tokyo, and Nakamura-ku, Nagoya.[229]\n\n\n\n\n### Worldwide presence[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Toyota manufacturing facilities\n\n\n\n| Top 10 Toyota and Lexus vehicle salesby country, 2022[232] |\n| --- |\n| Rankin Toyota\n | Location\n | Vehiclesales\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 2.108,460\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0China | 1.940,590\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 1.289,132\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0GCC | 390,294\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image)\u00a0Indonesia | 330,498\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image)\u00a0Thailand | 288,810\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image)\u00a0Australia | 238,139\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 200,205\n |\n| 9\n | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 191,653\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image)\u00a0Philippines | 174,106\n |\n\n\nOutside of Japan, as one of the world's largest automotive manufacturer by production volume, Toyota has factories in most parts of the world. The company assembles vehicles in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, the Czech Republic, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela.\n\n\nAdditionally, the company also has joint venture, licensed, or contract factories in China, France, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Taiwan, the United States, and Vietnam.\n\n\n\n#### North America[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota Motor North America\n\n![](image)The Toyota Camry is assembled in several facilities around the world including Australia, China, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia, Thailand, India, Vietnam, and the United States.\nToyota Motor North America is headquartered in Plano, Texas, and operates as a holding company for all operations of the Toyota Motor Corporation in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Toyota's operations in North America began on October 31, 1957, and the current company was established in 2017 from the consolidation of three companies: Toyota Motor North America, Inc., which controlled Toyota's corporate functions; Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. which handled marketing, sales, and distribution in the United States; and Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing North America which oversaw operations at all assembly plants in the region. While all three companies continue to exist in legal name, they operate as one company out of one headquarters campus.\n\n\nToyota has a large presence in the United States with six major assembly plants in Huntsville, Alabama, Georgetown, Kentucky, Princeton, Indiana, San Antonio, Texas, Buffalo, West Virginia, and Blue Springs, Mississippi. In 2018, Toyota and Mazda announced a joint venture plant that will produce vehicles in Huntsville, Alabama, starting in 2021.[233]\n\n\nIt has started producing larger trucks, such as the new Tundra, to go after the full-size pickup market in the United States. Toyota is also pushing hybrid electric vehicle in the US such as the Prius, Camry Hybrid, Highlander Hybrid, and various Lexus products. Currently, Toyota has no plans to offer diesel motor options in its North American products, including pickup trucks.[234]\n\n\nToyota Canada Inc., which is part of Toyota Motor North America, handles marketing, sales, and distribution in Canada. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada operates three assembly plants: two in Cambridge, Ontario and one in Woodstock, Ontario.[235] In 2006, Toyota's subsidiary Hino Motors opened a heavy duty truck plant, also in Woodstock, employing 45 people and producing 2,000 trucks annually.[236]\n\n\n\n#### Europe/Western Asia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota Motor Europe\n\n\n\n| Top 10 Toyota and Lexus vehicle productionby country, 2022[232] |\n| --- |\n| Rankin Toyota\n | Location\n | Vehicleproduction\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 2,656,009\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0China | 1,839,772\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 1,129,988\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0Thailand | 659,252\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 433,077\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image)\u00a0Indonesia | 268,150\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image)\u00a0Mexico | 267,775\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image)\u00a0France | 255,936\n |\n| 9\n | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 224,272\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image)\u00a0Turkey | 215,798\n |\n\n\nToyota Motor Europe is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, and oversees all operations of the Toyota Motor Corporation in Europe and western Asia. Toyota's operations in Europe began in 1963. Toyota has a significant presence in Europe with nine production facilities in Kol\u00edn, Czech Republic, Burnaston, England, Deeside, England, Onnaing, France, Jelcz-Laskowice, Poland, Wa\u0142brzych, Poland, Ovar, Portugal, Saint Petersburg, Russia, and Arifiye, Turkey.[237] Toyota also operates a joint venture plant with Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot in Valenciennes, France.\n\n\n\n#### Australia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota Australia\n\nIn 1963, Australia was one of the first countries to assemble Toyotas outside Japan. However, in February 2014, Toyota was the last of Australia's major automakers to announce the end of production in Australia. The closure of Toyota's Australian plant was completed on October 3, 2017, and had produced a total 3,451,155 vehicles. At its peak in October 2007, Toyota manufactured 15,000 cars a month.[238] Before Toyota, Ford and GM's Holden had announced similar moves, all citing an unfavorable currency and attendant high manufacturing costs.[239]\n\n\n\n### Financials[edit]\n\n\nToyota is publicly traded on the Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka, and Sapporo exchanges under company code TYO: 7203. In Japan, Toyota's stock is a component of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Core30 indices.\n\n\nIn addition, Toyota is foreign-listed on the New York Stock Exchange under NYSE:\u00a0TM and on the London Stock Exchange under LSE:\u00a0TYT.\n\n\nToyota has been publicly traded in Japan since 1949 and internationally since 1999.[240]\n\n\n\n## Company strategy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)New Toyota factory in Ohira, near Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan: A month after this picture was taken, the region was devastated by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. The plant was only lightly damaged, but remained closed more than a month, mainly due to lack of supplies and energy, in addition to a badly damaged Sendai port.\n### The Toyota Way[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Toyota Way\n\nThe Toyota Way is a set of principles and behaviors that underlie the company's approach to management and production (which is further defined as the Toyota Production System).\n\n\nThe company has been developing its corporate philosophy since 1948 and passing it on as implicit knowledge to new employees, but as the company expanded globally, leaders officially identified and defined the Toyota Way in 2001. Toyota summarized it under two main pillars: continuous improvement and respect for people. Under the continuous improvement pillar are three principles: challenge (form a long-term vision), kaizen (a continual improvement process), and genchi genbutsu (\"go and see\" the process to make correct decisions). Under the respect for people pillar are two principles: respect and teamwork.[241]\n\n\nIn 2004, Dr. Jeffrey Liker, a University of Michigan professor of industrial engineering, published *The Toyota Way*. In his book, Liker calls the Toyota Way \"a system designed to provide the tools for people to continually improve their work.\"[242] According to Liker, there are 14 principles of The Toyota Way that can be organized into four themes: (1) long-term philosophy, (2) the right process will produce the right results, (3) add value to the organization by developing your people, and (4) continuously solving root problems drives organizational learning. The 14 principles are further defined in the Wikipedia article on The Toyota Way.\n\n\n\n### Toyota Production System[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota Production System\n\nThe Toyota Way also helped shape the company's approach to production, where it was an early pioneer of what would be come to be known as lean manufacturing.[243] The company defines the Toyota Production System under two main pillars: just-in-time[244] (make only what is needed, only when it is needed, and only in the amount that is needed) and Jidoka[245] (automation with a human touch).\n\n\nThe origin of the Toyota Production System is in dispute, with three stories of its origin: (1) that during a 1950 trip to train with the Ford Motor Company, company executives also studied the just-in-time distribution system of the grocery store company Piggly-Wiggly,[246] (2) that they followed the writings of W. Edwards Deming,[247] and (3) they learned the principles from a WWII US government training program (Training Within Industry).[248]\n\n\nAfter developing the Toyota Production System in its own facilities, the company began teaching the system to its parts suppliers in the 1990s. Other companies were interested in the instruction, and Toyota later started offering training sessions. The company also has donated the training to non-profit groups to increase their efficiency and thus ability to serve people.\n\n\n\n### Logo and branding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Employee at the Toyota Automobile Museum explains development of Toyota name and brand.\nIn 1936, Toyota entered the passenger car market with its Model AA and held a competition to establish a new logo emphasizing speed for its new product line. After receiving 27,000 entries, one was selected that additionally resulted in a change of its moniker to \"Toyota\" from the family name \"Toyoda\", which means rice paddy. The new name was believed to sound better, and its eight-stroke count in the Japanese language was associated with wealth and good fortune. The original logo was a heavily stylized version of the katakana characters for Toyota (\u30c8\u30e8\u30bf).[249]\n\n\nAs the company started to expand internationally in the late 1950s, the katakana character logo was supplemented by various wordmarks with the English form of the company name in all capital letters, \"TOYOTA.\"[249]\n\n\nToyota introduced a worldwide logo in October 1989 to commemorate the 50th year of the company, and to differentiate it from the newly released luxury Lexus brand.[250] The logo consists of three ovals that combine to form the letter \"T\", which stands for Toyota. Toyota says that the overlapping of the two perpendicular ovals inside the larger oval represents the mutually beneficial relationship and trust between the customer and the company while the larger oval surrounding both of these inner ovals represents the \"global expansion of Toyota's technology and unlimited potential for the future\".[251][252] The new logo started appearing on all printed material, advertisements, dealer signage, and most vehicles in 1990.\n\n\nIn countries or regions using traditional Chinese characters, e.g. Hong Kong and Taiwan, Toyota is known as \"\u8c50\u7530\".[253] In countries using simplified Chinese characters (e.g. China and Singapore), Toyota is written as \"\u4e30\u7530\"[254] (pronounced as *F\u0113ngti\u00e1n* in Mandarin Chinese and *H\u0254ng Tshan* in Minnanese). These are the same characters as the founding family's name \"Toyoda\" in Japanese.\n\n\n\n![](image)Some new vehicles, like this Tacoma, still use the heritage TOYOTA wordmark.\nToyota still uses the katakana character logo as its corporate emblem in Japan, including on the headquarters building,[255] and some special edition models still use the \"TOYOTA\" wordmark on the grille as a nod to the company's heritage.[256]\n\n\nOn July 15, 2015, the company was delegated its own generic top-level domain, .toyota.[257]\n\n\n\n### Sports sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nToyota sponsors several teams and has purchased naming rights for several venues, and even competitions, including:\n\n\n\n* Toyota Alvark Tokyo, basketball team\n* Toyota Arena, Ontario, California\n* Toyota Cup\n* Toyota Center, Houston, Texas\n* Toyota Center, Kennewick, Washington\n* Toyota Field, San Antonio, Texas\n* Toyota Park, Bridgeview, Illinois\n* Toyota Sports Center, El Segundo, California\n* Toyota Stadium, Georgetown, Kentucky\n* Toyota Stadium, Frisco, Texas\n\n\nAs of 2017[update], Toyota is an official sponsor of Cricket Australia,[258] the England and Wales Cricket Board[259] and the AFL.[260] In March 2015, Toyota became a sponsor partner for the Olympic Games, in the form of supplying vehicles and communications between vehicles until 2024.[261]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* List of Toyota engines\n* List of Toyota manufacturing facilities\n* List of Toyota transmissions\n* List of Toyota vehicles\n* Nagoya Grampus, formerly the company's football club and still sponsored by them\n* Toyota model codes\n* Toyota Verblitz, the company's rugby team\n* Toyota War, a conflict between Libya and Chad which saw a heavy use of Toyota's pickup trucks.\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Toyota Global Sales and Production Secures 90 Percent Level Year-on-Year in FY2021\" (Press release).

Some Toyota owners, drawn to what they thought was a green brand, are in open revolt against the automaker. They're sending complaints to the company, taking to social media to call for boycotts and promising to buy cars that sided with California in its fight with President Trump.\n76. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Tabuchi, Hiroko (January 14, 2021). \"Toyota to Pay a Record Fine for a Decade of Clean Air Act Violations\". *The New York Times*.

By sales, it was the largest automaker in the United States in 2022, and was the largest in the world for 77 years before losing the top spot to Toyota in 2008.[4][5]\n\n\nGeneral Motors operates manufacturing plants in eight countries.[6] In addition to its four core brands, GM also holds interests in Chinese brands Baojun and Wuling via SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile.[2] GM further owns the BrightDrop delivery vehicle manufacturer,[7] a namesake defense vehicles division which produces military vehicles for the United States government and military,[8] the vehicle safety, security, and information services provider OnStar,[9] the auto parts company ACDelco, a namesake financial lending service, and majority ownership in the self-driving cars enterprise Cruise LLC.\n\n\nThe company traces itself to a holding company for Buick established on September 16, 1908, by William C. Durant, the largest seller of horse-drawn vehicles at the time. The first half of the 20th century saw the company grow into an automotive behemoth through acquisitions; going into the second half, the company pursued innovation and new offerings to consumers as well as collaborations with NASA to develop the earliest electric vehicles.[10][11] The current entity was established in 2009 after the General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization.[12]\n\n\nToday, General Motors remains a successful company, ranking 25th by total revenue out of all American companies on the *Fortune 500* and 50th on the *Fortune Global 500*.[13][14] The company is presently heavily pursuing electric vehicles, as GM announced plans in January 2021 to end production and sales of vehicles using internal combustion engines, including hybrid vehicles and plug-in hybrids, by 2035, as part of its plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of General Motors\n\n### Founding and consolidation[edit]\n\n\nBy 1900, William C. Durant's Durant-Dort Carriage Company of Flint, Michigan had become the largest manufacturer of horse-drawn vehicles in the United States.[16] Durant was averse to automobiles, but fellow Flint businessman James H. Whiting, owner of Flint Wagon Works, sold him the Buick Motor Company in 1904.[17] Durant formed the General Motors Company in 1908 as a holding company, with partner Charles Stewart Mott, borrowing a naming convention from General Electric.[18] GM's first acquisition was Buick, which Durant already owned, then Olds Motor Works on November 12, 1908.[19] Under Durant, GM went on to acquire Cadillac, Elmore, Welch, Cartercar, Oakland (the predecessor of Pontiac), the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company of Pontiac, Michigan, and the Reliance Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan (predecessors of GMC) in 1909.\n\n\nDurant, with the board's approval, also tried acquiring Ford Motor Company, but needed an additional $2 million.[20] Durant over-leveraged GM in making acquisitions, and was removed by the board of directors in 1910 at the order of the bankers who backed the loans to keep GM in business.[17] The action of the bankers was partially influenced by the Panic of 1910\u20131911 that followed the earlier enforcement of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. In 1911, Charles F. Kettering of Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (DELCO) and Henry M. Leland invented and patented the first electric starter in America.[21] In November 1911, Durant co-founded Chevrolet with Swiss race car driver Louis Chevrolet, who left the company in 1915 after a disagreement with Durant.[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)General Motors Company share certificate issued October 13, 1916\nGM was reincorporated in Detroit in 1916 as General Motors Corporation and became a public company via an initial public offering. By 1917, Chevrolet had become successful enough that Durant, with the backing of Samuel McLaughlin and Pierre S. du Pont, reacquired a controlling interest in GM. The same year, GM acquired Samson Tractor.[23] Chevrolet Motor Company was consolidated into GM on May 2, 1918, and the same year GM acquired United Motors, a parts supplier founded by Durant and headed by Alfred P. Sloan for $45 million, and the McLaughlin Motor Car Company, founded by R. S. McLaughlin, became General Motors of Canada Limited.[24][25][26] In 1919, GM acquired Guardian Frigerator Company, part-owned by Durant, which was renamed Frigidaire. Also in 1919, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC), which provides financing to automotive customers, was formed.[27][17]\n\n\nIn 1920, du Pont orchestrated the removal of Durant once again and replaced him with Alfred P. Sloan.[28] At a time when GM was competing heavily with Ford Motor Company, Sloan established annual model changes, making previous years' models \"dated\" and created a market for used cars.[29] He also implemented the pricing strategy used by car companies today. The pricing strategy had Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac priced from least expensive to most, respectively.[30][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nIn 1921, Thomas Midgley Jr., an engineer for GM, discovered tetraethyllead (leaded gasoline) as an antiknock agent, and GM patented the compound because ethanol could not be patented.[31] This led to the development of higher compression engines resulting in more power and efficiency. The public later realized that lead contained in the gasoline was harmful to various biological organisms including humans.[32] Evidence shows that corporate executives understood the health implications of tetraethyllead from the beginning.[33] As an engineer for GM, Midgley also developed chlorofluorocarbons, which have now been banned due to their contribution to climate change.[34]\n\n\nUnder the encouragement of GM President Alfred P. Sloan Jr., GM acquired Vauxhall Motors for $2.5 million in 1925.[35] The company also acquired an interest in the Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company the same year, and its president, John D. Hertz, joined the board of directors of GM; it acquired the remainder of the company in 1943.[17]\n\n\n\n### Growth and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nIn 1926, the company introduced the Pontiac brand and established the General Motors Group Insurance Program to provide life insurance to its employees.[17] The following year, after the success of the 1927 model of the Cadillac LaSalle designed by Harley Earl, Sloan created the \"Art and Color Section\" of GM and named Earl as its first director. Earl was the first design executive to be appointed to leadership at a major American corporation. Earl created a system of automobile design that is still practiced today.[36] At the age of 24, Bill Mitchell was recruited by Harley Earl to the design team at GM, and he was later appointed as Chief Designer of Cadillac. After Earl retired in December 1958, Mitchell took over automotive design for GM.[37] Also in 1926 the company acquired Fisher Body, its supplier of automobile bodies.[38]\n\n\nGM acquired Allison Engine Company[17][39] and began developing a 1,000 horsepower liquid-cooled aircraft engine in 1929.[17] The same year, GM acquired 80% of Opel, which at that time had a 37.5% market share in Europe, for $26 million. It acquired the remaining 20% in 1931.[35]\n\n\nIn the late-1920s, Charles Kettering embarked on a program to develop a lightweight two-stroke diesel engine for possible usage in automobiles.[40] Soon after, GM acquired Electro-Motive Company and the Winton Engine Co., and in 1941, it expanded EMC's realm to locomotive engine manufacturing.[41]\n\n\nIn 1932, GM acquired Packard Electric[17][42] (not the Packard car company, which merged with Studebaker years later). The following year, GM acquired a controlling interest in North American Aviation and merged it with the General Aviation Manufacturing Corporation.[43]\n\n\nThe GM labor force participated in the formation of the United Auto Workers labor union in 1935, and in 1936 the UAW organized the Flint Sit-Down Strike, which initially idled two key plants in Flint, Michigan, and later spread to 6 other plants including those in Janesville, Wisconsin and Fort Wayne, Indiana. In Flint, police attempted to enter the plant to arrest strikers, leading to violence; in other cities, the plants were shuttered peacefully. The strike was resolved on February 11, 1937, when GM recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for its workers and gave workers a 5% raise and permission to speak in the lunchroom.[44]\n\n\nWalter E.

Boegehold of GM invented the Jominy end-quench test for hardenability of carbon steel in 1937, a breakthrough in heat treating still in use today as ASTM A255.[45] GM established Detroit Diesel the next year.[46]\n\n\nIn 1939, the company founded Motors Insurance Corporation and entered the vehicle insurance market.[27] The same year, GM introduced the Hydramatic, the first affordable and successful automatic transmission, for the 1940 Oldsmobile.[47][48]\n\n\n\n* ![1926 Pontiac radiator logo](image)\n\n1926 Pontiac radiator logo\n* ![1928 Pontiac Series 6-28 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan](image)\n\n1928 Pontiac Series 6-28 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan\n* ![1932 Pontiac Series 402 Six 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan](image)\n\n1932 Pontiac Series 402 Six 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan\n* ![1936 Pontiac Master Six Series 6BB Coupe](image)\n\n1936 Pontiac Master Six Series 6BB Coupe\n\nDuring World War II, GM produced vast quantities of armaments, vehicles, and aircraft for the Allies of World War II. In 1940, GM's William S. Knudsen served as head of U.S. wartime production for President Franklin Roosevelt, and by 1942, all of GM's production was to support the war.[49] GM's Vauxhall Motors manufactured the Churchill tank series for the Allies, instrumental in the North African campaign.[17] However, its Opel division, based in Germany, supplied the Nazi Party with vehicles. Sloan, head of GM at the time, was an ardent opponent of the New Deal, which bolstered labor unions and public transport, and Sloan admired and supported Adolf Hitler.[50] Nazi armaments chief Albert Speer allegedly said in 1977 that Hitler \"would never have considered invading Poland\" without synthetic fuel technology provided by General Motors. GM was compensated $32 million by the U.S. government because its German factories were bombed by U.S. forces during the war.[51]\n\n\nEffective January 28, 1953, Charles Erwin Wilson, then GM president, was named by Dwight D. Eisenhower as United States Secretary of Defense.[17]\n\n\nIn December 1953, GM acquired Euclid Trucks, a manufacturer of heavy equipment for earthmoving, including dump trucks, loaders and wheel tractor-scrapers, which later spawned the Terex brand.[52][53]\n\n\n\n### Periods of innovation[edit]\n\n\nAlfred P. Sloan retired as chairman and was succeeded by Albert Bradley in April 1956.[54]\n\n\nIn 1962, GM introduced the first turbo charged engine in the world for a car in the Oldsmobile Cutlass Turbo-Jetfire.[17][55] Two years later, the company introduced its \"Mark of Excellence\" logo and trademark at the 1964 New York World's Fair. The company used the mark as their main corporate identifier until 2021.[56]\n\n\nGM released the Electrovan in 1966, the first hydrogen fuel cell car ever produced.[57] Though fuel cells have existed since the early 1800s, General Motors was the first to use a fuel cell, supplied by Union Carbide, to power the wheels of a vehicle with a budget of \"millions of dollars\".[58][59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)An advertisement for the 1969 Chevrolet Nova using the advertising slogan *\"Putting you first, keeps us first\"*\nIn the 1960s, GM was the first to use turbochargers and was an early proponent of V6 engines, but quickly lost interest as the popularity of muscle cars increased. GM demonstrated gas turbine vehicles powered by kerosene, an area of interest throughout the industry, but abandoned the alternative engine configuration due to the 1973 oil crisis.[61]\n\n\nIn partnership with Boeing, GM's Delco Defense Electronics Division designed the Lunar Roving Vehicle, which traversed the surface of the Moon, in 1971.[62][63] The following year, GM produced the first rear wheel anti-lock braking system for two models: the Toronado and Eldorado.[64]\n\n\nIn 1973, the Oldsmobile Toronado was the first retail car sold with a passenger airbag.[65][66]\n\n\nThomas Murphy became CEO of the company, succeeding Richard C. Gerstenberg in November 1974.[67][68]\n\n\nGM installed its first catalytic converters in its 1975 models.[69]\n\n\nFrom 1978 to 1985, GM pushed the benefits of diesel engines and cylinder deactivation technologies. However, it had disastrous results due to poor durability in the Oldsmobile diesels and drivability issues in the Cadillac V8-6-4 variable-cylinder engines.[70]\n\n\nGM sold Frigidaire in 1979. Although Frigidaire had between $450 million and $500 million in annual revenues, it was losing money.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)General Motors headquarters building, 1981\nRobert Lee of GM invented the Fe14Nd2B the Neodymium magnet, which was fabricated by rapid solidification, in 1984.[72] This magnet is commonly used in products like a computer hard disk. The same year, GM acquired Electronic Data Systems for $2.5 billion from Ross Perot as part of a strategy by CEO Roger Smith to derive at least 10% of its annual worldwide revenue from non-automotive sources.[73] GM also intended to have EDS handle its bookkeeping, help computerize factories, and integrate GM's computer systems. The transaction made Ross Perot the largest shareholder of GM; however, disagreements with Roger Smith led the company to buy all shares held by Ross Perot for $750 million in 1986.[74]\n\n\nIn a continuation of its diversification plans, GMAC formed GMAC Mortgage and acquired Colonial Mortgage as well as the servicing arm of Norwest Mortgage in 1985. This acquisition included an $11 billion mortgage portfolio.[75] The same year, GM acquired the Hughes Aircraft Company for $5 billion in cash and stock and merged it into Delco Electronics.[76] The following year, GM acquired 59.7% of Lotus Cars, a British producer of high-performance sports cars.[77]\n\n\nIn 1987, in conjunction with AeroVironment, GM built the Sunraycer, which won the inaugural World Solar Challenge and was a showcase of advanced technology. Much of the technology from Sunraycer found its way into the Impact prototype electric vehicle (also built by Aerovironment) and was the predecessor to the General Motors EV1.[78]\n\n\nIn 1988, GM acquired a 15% stake in AeroVironment.[79]\n\n\nIn 1989, GM acquired half of Saab Automobile's car operations for $600 million.[80]\n\n\n\n### Sales of assets[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1990, Robert Stempel became CEO of the company, succeeding Roger Smith.[81] GM cut output significantly and suffered losses that year due to the early 1990s recession.[82]\n\n\nIn 1990, GM debuted the General Motors EV1 (Impact) concept, a battery electric vehicle, at the LA Auto Show. It was the first car with zero emissions marketed in the US in over three decades. The Impact was produced as the EV1 for the 1996 model year and was available only via lease from certain dealers in California and Arizona. In 1999\u20132002, GM ceased production of the vehicles and started to not renew the leases, disappointing many people, allegedly because the program would not be profitable and would cannibalize its existing business. All of the EV1s were eventually returned to General Motors, and except for around 40 which were donated to museums with their electric powertrains deactivated, all were destroyed. The documentary film *Who Killed the Electric Car?* covered the EV1 story.[83]\n\n\nIn November 1992, John F. Smith Jr. became CEO of the company.[84]\n\n\nIn 1993, GM sold Lotus Cars to Bugatti.[85]\n\n\nIn 1996, in a return to its automotive basics, GM completed the corporate spin-off of Electronic Data Systems.[86][87]\n\n\nIn 1997, GM sold the military businesses of Hughes Aircraft Company to Raytheon Company for $9.5 billion in stock and the assumption of debt.[88][89][90][91]\n\n\nIn February 2000, Rick Wagoner was named CEO, succeeding John F. Smith Jr.[92][93] The next month, GM gave 5.1% of its common stock, worth $2.4 billion, to acquire a 20% share of Fiat.[94]\n\n\nIn December 2000, GM announced that it would begin phasing out Oldsmobile. The brand was eventually discontinued in 2004, seven years after it had become the first American car brand to turn 100.[95]\n\n\n\n* ![Chevrolet Tahoe hybrid vehicle](image)\n\nChevrolet Tahoe hybrid vehicle\n* ![Second generation Chevrolet Volt](image)\n\nSecond generation Chevrolet Volt\n* ![The Chevrolet Volt](image)\n\nThe Chevrolet Volt\n* ![The General Motors EV1, an electric car, was introduced in California in 1996.](image)\n\nThe General Motors EV1, an electric car, was introduced in California in 1996.\n\nIn May 2004, GM delivered the first full-sized pickup truck hybrid vehicles, the 1/2-ton Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra trucks.[96] These mild hybrids did not use electrical energy for propulsion, like GM's later designs. Later, the company debuted another hybrid technology, co-developed with DaimlerChrysler and BMW, in diesel-electric hybrid powertrain manufactured by Allison Transmission for transit buses.[97] Continuing to target the diesel-hybrid market, the Opel Astra diesel engine hybrid concept vehicle was rolled out in January 2005.[98] Later that year, GM sold its Electro-Motive Diesel locomotive division to private equity firms Berkshire Partners and Greenbriar Equity Group.[99][100]\n\n\nGM paid $2 billion to sever its ties with Fiat in 2005, severing ties with the company due to an increasingly contentious dispute.[101]\n\n\nGM began adding its \"Mark of Excellence\" emblem on all new vehicles produced and sold in North America in mid-2005. However, after the reorganization in 2009, the company no longer added the logo, saying that emphasis on its four core divisions would downplay the GM logo.[102][103]\n\n\nIn 2005, Edward T. Welburn was promoted to the newly created position of vice president, GM Global Design, making him the first African American to lead a global automotive design organization and the highest-ranking African American in the US motor industry at that time. On July 1, 2016, he retired from General Motors after 44 years. He was replaced by Michael Simcoe.[104][105]\n\n\nIn 2006, GM introduced a bright yellow fuel cap on its vehicles to remind drivers that cars can operate using E85 ethanol fuel.[106] They also introduced another hybrid vehicle that year, the Saturn Vue Green Line.[107]\n\n\nIn 2008, General Motors committed to engineering half of its manufacturing plants to be landfill-free by recycling or reusing waste in the manufacturing process.[108] Continuing their environmental-conscious development, GM started to offer the 2-mode hybrid system in the Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon, Cadillac Escalade, and pickup trucks.[109]\n\n\nIn late 2008, the world's largest rooftop solar power installation was installed at GM's manufacturing plant in Zaragoza. The Zaragoza solar installation has about 2,000,000 square feet (190,000\u00a0m2) of roof at the plant and contains about 85,000 solar panels. The installation was created, owned and operated by Veolia Environment and Clairvoyant Energy, which leases the rooftop area from GM.[110][111][112]\n\n\n\n### Chapter 11 bankruptcy and bailout[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization\n\nIn March 2009, after the company had received $17.4 billion in bailouts but was not effective in a turnaround, President Barack Obama forced the resignation of CEO Rick Wagoner.[113]\n\n\nGeneral Motors filed for a government-backed Chapter 11 reorganization on June 8, 2009.[114][115] On July 10, 2009, the original General Motors sold assets and some subsidiaries to an entirely new company, including the trademark \"General Motors\".[114][115] Liabilities were left with the original GM, renamed Motors Liquidation Company, freeing the companies of many liabilities and resulting in a new GM.[114][115]\n\n\nThrough the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the United States Department of the Treasury invested $49.5 billion in General Motors and recovered $39 billion when it sold its shares on December 9, 2013, resulting in a loss of $10.3 billion. The Treasury invested an additional $17.2 billion into GM's former financing company, GMAC (now Ally Financial). The shares in Ally were sold on December 18, 2014, for $19.6 billion netting the government $2.4 billion in profit, including dividends.[116][117] A study by the Center for Automotive Research found that the GM bailout saved 1.2 million jobs and preserved $34.9 billion in tax revenue.[118]\n\n\nGeneral Motors Canada was not part of the General Motors Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[119]\n\n\n\n### Post-reorganization[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2009, at the request of Steven Rattner, lead adviser to President Barack Obama on the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry, Edward Whitacre Jr., who had led a restructuring of AT&T, was appointed as chairman of General Motors.[120] Whitacre was tasked with overseeing GM's emergence from bankruptcy and downsizing its sizable number of brand marques, many of which had produced chronic losses even before the recession began. In July 2009, after 40 days of bankruptcy protection, the company emerged from the government-backed General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization.[121]\n\n\nAs mandated by its bailout agreement, GM began the process of shedding its poorest-performing brands in June 2009: Hummer, Saab, Saturn, and Pontiac. An October 2009 agreement to sell the Hummer brand to China-based Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company Ltd.[122] and a group of private investors fell through three months later, resulting in GM seeking a new suitor.[123] American company Raser Technologies, along with several others, expressed interest in buying the company, but none of the proposed acquisitions came to fruition, and in April 2010 GM said it was officially shutting down the Hummer brand.[124][125] Similarly, GM's efforts to sell its Saturn division yielded an early suitor. In June 2009, GM announced that the Saturn brand would be sold to the Penske Automotive Group.[126] The deal fell through, however, and GM declared the brand defunct in October 2010. While GM agreed to shed its underperforming Pontiac brand as part of its bailout agreement, the company explicitly opted not to sell it to another company.[127][128] The last Pontiac was built in January 2010.[129]\n\n\nGM was more successful in its attempts to sell Saab Automobile: the company closed a sale to Dutch automaker Spyker Cars in February 2010.[130] Saab continued to perform poorly under Spyker's management, however, and in 2012 the Saab division declared bankruptcy.\n\n\nIn December 2009, the \"new\" GM's board of directors asked CEO Fritz Henderson to resign, and its chairman, Ed Whitacre, was named interim CEO.[131] GM opted to appoint Whitacre as its permanent CEO the following month, though Whitacre ultimately stepped down as CEO in September 2010, relinquishing the position to fellow GM board member Daniel Akerson but agreeing to continue on as GM chairman until the end of the year. Akerson replaced him as chairman, while continuing as CEO, in January 2011.[132][133]\n\n\nIn 2010, GM introduced the Chevrolet Volt as an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV), an electric vehicle with backup generators powered by gasoline, or series plug-in hybrid.[134][135] GM delivered the first Volt in December 2010.[136] The Chevrolet Volt was a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle with back-up generators powered by gasoline (range-extended electric vehicle).[137] GM built a prototype two-seat electric vehicle with Segway Inc. An early prototype of the Personal Urban Mobility and Accessibility vehicle\u2014dubbed Project P.U.M.A. \u2013 was presented in New York at the 2009 New York International Auto Show.[138]\n\n\n\n* ![2nd generation Buick LaCrosse (2010\u20132016)[139][140]](image)\n\n2nd generation Buick LaCrosse (2010\u20132016)[139][140]\n* ![General Motors Sequel, a fuel cell-powered vehicle from GM.](image)\n\nGeneral Motors Sequel, a fuel cell-powered vehicle from GM.\n* ![E85 FlexFuel Chevrolet Impala LT 2009 (USA)](image)\n\nE85 FlexFuel Chevrolet Impala LT 2009 (USA)\n* ![The Chevrolet Bolt EV was released in late 2016.](image)\n\nThe Chevrolet Bolt EV was released in late 2016.\n\nOn January 15, 2014, Mary Barra was named chief executive officer, succeeding Daniel Akerson. Barra also joined the GM board.[141] Only three weeks later, the company announced its 2014 General Motors recall, which was due to faulty ignition switches, and was linked to at least 124 deaths. The resulting settlements with family members of those killed were estimated to cost the company $1.5 billion.[142]\n\n\nOn January 4, 2016, in its first investment in a ridesharing company, GM invested $500 million in Lyft.[143][144] The company does not directly supply Lyft drivers with vehicles, however \u2013 and has no plans to do so in the future \u2013 and Lyft ultimately partnered with Motional for production of its autonomous vehicles.\n\n\nIn March 2016, GM acquired Cruise, a San Francisco self-driving vehicle start-up, to develop self-driving cars that could be used in ride-sharing fleets.[145][146] In June 2022, Cruise received California's first Driverless Deployment Permit, allowing it to both charge fees for its service as well as offer fully autonomous rides in a major public city.[147] *The Verge* reported that the company lost $561 million in Q1 2023, but said it remains on the path to reach $1 billion in revenue by 2025 and $50 billion by 2030.[148]\n\n\nIn October 2016, GM began production of the Chevrolet Bolt EV, the first-ever mass market all-electric car with a range of more than 200 miles (320\u00a0km).[149][150] The battery pack and most drivetrain components were built by LG Corporation and assembled in GM's plant in Lake Orion, Michigan.[151] GM chose to employ the Bolt EV and similar Bolt EUV for its Cruise ride-share service.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn January 8, 2021, GM introduced a new logo alongside the tagline \"EVerybody in\", with the capitalized \"EV\" as a nod to the company's commitment to electric vehicles.[152][153] GM's new logo used negative space to create the idea of an electric plug in the \"M\" of the logo.[154]\n\n\nAt the January 2021 Consumer Electronics Show, GM launched BrightDrop, its brand for all-electric commercial vehicles.[155]\n\n\nOn January 28, 2021, GM announced that it will end production and sales of fossil-fuel vehicles (including hybrids and plug-in hybrids) by 2035 as part of its plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2040.[156]\n\n\nIn 2021, GM announced plans to establish an automotive battery and battery pack laboratory in Michigan.[157][158][159] GM will be responsible for battery management systems and power electronics, thermal management, as well as the pack assembly. An existing GM facility at Brownstown Township was chosen to be upgraded as a battery pack plant.[134] LG Chem's U.S. subsidiary, Compact Power of Troy, Michigan, has been building the prototype packs for the development vehicles and will continue to provide integration support and acting as a liaison for the program.[160]\n\n\n\n### Motorsports history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chevrolet Corvette C8.R in the IMSA SportsCar Championship\nGM participated in the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) from 2004 to 2012,[161] and has also participated in other motorsport championships, including 24 Hours of Le Mans,[162] NASCAR,[163] SCCA[164] and Supercars Championship.[165]\n\n\nGM's engines were successful in the Indy Racing League (IRL) throughout the 1990s, winning many races in the small V8 class. GM has also done much work in the development of electronics for GM auto racing. An unmodified Aurora V8 in the Aerotech captured 47 world records, including the record for speed endurance in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America. Recently, the Cadillac V-Series has entered motorsports racing.\n\n\nGM has also designed cars specifically for use in NASCAR auto racing. The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 is the only entry in the series.[166] In the past, the Pontiac Grand Prix,[167] Buick Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass, Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Malibu, Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Chevrolet Impala, and the Chevrolet SS were also used. GM has won many NASCAR Cup Series manufacturer's championships, including 40 with Chevrolet,[168] the most of any make in NASCAR history, 3 with Oldsmobile, 2 with Buick, and 1 with Pontiac. In 2021, Chevrolet became the first brand to reach 800 wins.[169]\n\n\nIn Australia, Holden cars based on the Monaro, Torana and Commodore platforms raced in the Australian Touring Car Championship until 2022. Holden won the Bathurst 1000, a record 36 times between 1968 and 2022 and the Australian Touring Car Championship 23 times.[170] From 2023, the Chevrolet Camaro will be raced.[171]\n\n\n\n### Logo evolution[edit]\n\n\nEvolution of the GM logo through the years:[172]\n\n\n\n* ![1938\u20131964[172]](image)\n\n1938\u20131964[172]\n* ![Mark of Excellence (1964\u20132021)[172]](image)\n\nMark of Excellence (1964\u20132021)[172]\n* ![2001\u20132021[172]](image)\n\n2001\u20132021[172]\n* ![2010\u20132021[172]](image)\n\n2010\u20132021[172]\n* ![2021 (gradient)[172]](image)\n\n2021 (gradient)[172]\n* ![2021 (flat)[173]](image)\n\n2021 (flat)[173]\n* ![2022 (wordmark)[174]](image)\n\n2022 (wordmark)[174]\n\n\n## Brands[edit]\n\n\n### Current[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Brand[175] | Founded\n | Began manufacturing vehicles\n | Joined GM\n | Markets served today\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Buick | 1899 | 1903 | 1908 | China, North America\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Cadillac | 1902 | 1902 | 1909 | North America, Middle East, China, Japan, South Korea, Europe, Kazakhstan\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Chevrolet | 1911 | 1911 | 1918 | Americas, China, Middle East, CIS, South Korea, Philippines, Japan, Europe, Australasia.\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | GMC | 1912 | 1912 | 1919 | North America, Middle East, South Korea\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CHN | Baojun | 2010 | 2010 | 2010 | China\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CHN | Wuling | 2002 | 2002 | 2002 | China, Indonesia\n |\n\n\n### Former[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Brand[175] | Founded\n | Began manufacturing vehicles\n | Joined GM\n | Fate\n | Defunct / Sold\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Acadian | 1962 | 1962 | 1962 | Discontinued | 1971 | Canadian Chevy with Pontiac design accents\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0KOR | Alpheon | 2010 | 2010 | 2010 | Discontinued | 2015 | The only available model was based on the Buick LaCrosse\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | As\u00fcna | 1992 | 1992 | 1992 | Discontinued | 1994 | Composed of Suzuki, Isuzu and Toyota models.\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Beaumont | 1966 | 1966 | 1966 | Discontinued | 1969 | Canadian Chevy with Pontiac design accents\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0UK | Bedford | 1931 | 1931 | 1931 | Discontinued | 1991 |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Cartercar | 1905 | 1905 | 1909 | Discontinued | 1915 |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0KOR | Daewoo | 1972 | 1972 | 1999 | Discontinued | 2011 | Succeeded by GM Korea |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Elmore | 1893 | 1900 | 1912 | Discontinued | 1916 |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Envoy | 1959 | 1959 | 1959 | Discontinued | 1970 | Imported Vauxhall and Bedford vehicles sold at Canadian Chevrolet and Oldsmobile dealerships\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Epic | 1964 | 1964 | 1964 | Discontinued | 1970 | Imported Vauxhall models sold at Canadian Pontiac, Buick and GMC dealerships\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Garland |  |  | 1909 | Discontinued | 1909 |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Geo | 1989 | 1989 | 1989 | Discontinued | 1997 | Composed of Suzuki, Isuzu and Toyota models.

This reign was longer than any other automaker, and GM is still among the world's largest automakers by vehicle unit sales.[176]\n\n\nIn 2008, the third-largest individual country by sales was Brazil, with some 550,000 GM vehicles sold. In that year, Argentina, Colombia, and Venezuela sold another 300,000 GM vehicles, suggesting that the total GM sales in South America (including sales in other South American countries such as Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, etc.) in that year were at a similar level to sales in China.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2009, General Motors sold 6.5\u00a0million cars and trucks globally; in 2010, it sold 8.39 million.[177] Sales in China rose 66.9% in 2009 to 1,830,000 vehicles and accounting for 13.4% of the market.[178]\n\n\nIn 2010, General Motors ranked second worldwide with 8.5 million vehicles produced.[179] In 2011, GM returned to the first place with 9.025 million units sold worldwide, corresponding to 11.9% market share of the global motor vehicle industry. In 2010, vehicle sales in China by GM rose 28.8% to a record 2,351,610 units.[180] The top two markets in 2011 were China, with 2,547,203 units, and the United States, with 2,503,820 vehicles sold. The Chevrolet brand was the main contributor to GM performance, with 4.76 million vehicles sold around the world in 2011, a global sales record.[181]\n\n\nBased on global sales in 2012, General Motors was ranked among the world's largest automakers.[182]\n\n\nIn May 2012, GM recorded an 18.4% market share in the U.S. with stock imported.[183]\n\n\nAnnual worldwide sales volume reached 10 million vehicles in 2016.[184][185][186] Sales in India for April 2016 \u2013 March 2017 declined to 25,823 units from 32,540 the previous year and market share contracted from 1.17% to 0.85% for the same period. However, exports surged 89% during the same period to 70,969 units. GMTC-I, GM's technical center in Bangalore, India continued in operation. Weak product line-up and below par service quality were the reasons for the poor showing by GM in India that year.[187][188]\n\n\nGlobal Volt/Ampera family sales totalled about 177,000 units from its inception in December 2010 through 2018.[189] including over 10,000 Opel/Vauxhall Amperas sold in Europe up to December 2015.[190][191] The Volt family of vehicles ranked as the world's all-time top-selling plug-in hybrid as of September\u00a02018[update], and it is also the third best selling plug-in electric car in history after the Nissan Leaf (375,000) and the Tesla Model S (253,000), as of October\u00a02018[update].[189] The Chevrolet Volt is also the U.S. all-time top-selling plug-in electric car with 148,556 units delivered through October 2018.[192][193]\n\n\n\n\n\nGM worldwide 2008 vehicle sales[194]  \n(thousands)\n| Rankin GM\n | Location\n | Vehiclesales\n | Marketshare (%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 2,981 | 22.1%\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0China | 1,095 | 12.0%\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 549 | 19.5%\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | 384 | 15.4%\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 359 | 21.4%\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 338 | 11.1%\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | 300 | 8.8%\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image)\u00a0Mexico | 212 | 19.8%\n |\n| 9\n | ![](image)\u00a0Australia | 133 | 13.1%\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | 117 | 9.7%\n |\n| 11\n | ![](image)\u00a0France | 114 | 4.4%\n |\n| 12\n | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | 107 | 7.8%\n |\n| 13\n | ![](image)\u00a0Argentina | 95 | 15.5%\n |\n| 14\n | ![](image)\u00a0Venezuela | 91 | 33.3%\n |\n| 15\n | ![](image)\u00a0Colombia | 80 | 36.3%\n |\n| 16\n | ![](image)\u00a0India | 66 | 3.3%\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | U.S. sales(vehicles)\n | Chg/yr.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998[195] | 4,603,991\n |  |\n| 1999\n | 5,017,150\n | ![Increase](image)9.0%\n |\n| 2000[196] | 4,953,163\n | ![Decrease](image)1.3%\n |\n| 2001\n | 4,904,015\n | ![Decrease](image)1.0%\n |\n| 2002\n | 4,858,705\n | ![Decrease](image)0.9%\n |\n| 2003\n | 4,756,403\n | ![Decrease](image)2.1%\n |\n| 2004[197] | 4,707,416\n | ![Decrease](image)1.0%\n |\n| 2005\n | 4,517,730\n | ![Decrease](image)4.0%\n |\n| 2006[198] | 4,124,645\n | ![Decrease](image)8.7%\n |\n| 2007[199] | 3,866,620\n | ![Decrease](image)6.3%\n |\n| 2008[200] | 2,980,688\n | ![Decrease](image)22.9%\n |\n| 2009[201] | 2,084,492\n | ![Decrease](image)30.1%\n |\n| 2010[202] | 2,215,227\n | ![Increase](image)6.3%\n |\n| 2011[203] | 2,503,820\n | ![Increase](image)13.7%\n |\n| 2012\n | 2,595,717\n | ![Increase](image)3.7%\n |\n| 2013[204] | 2,786,078\n | ![Increase](image)7.3%\n |\n| 2014[205] | 2,935,008\n | ![Increase](image)5.3%\n |\n| 2015[206] | 3,082,366\n | ![Increase](image)5.0%\n |\n| 2016\n | 3,042,773\n | ![Decrease](image)1.3%\n |\n| 2017\n | 3,002,241\n | ![Decrease](image)1.3%\n |\n| 2018\n | 2,954,037\n | ![Decrease](image)1.5%\n |\n| 2019[207] | 2,887,046\n | ![Decrease](image)2.3%\n |\n| 2020[208] | 2,547,339\n | ![Decrease](image)11.8%\n |\n| 2021[209] | 2,218,228\n | ![Decrease](image)12.9%\n |\n| 2022[209] | 2,274,088\n | ![Increase](image)2.5%\n |\n\n\n\n\nGM worldwide 2019 vehicle sales[210]\n| Location\n | Total sales\n | Year-On-Yearchange\n | Year-On-Yearchange (%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GM North America | 3,367,374 | (122,740) | (3.5)\n |\n| GM Europe | 3,590 | (266) | (6.9)\n |\n| GM South America | 668,842 | (21,355) | (3.1)\n |\n| GM International | 584,520 | 28,033 | 5.0\n |\n| China | 3,093,604 | (551,440) | (15.1)\n |\n| Total | 7,717,930 | (667,768) | (8.0)\n |\n\n\n## Management[edit]\n\n\n### Current board of directors[edit]\n\n\nNotable members of the board of directors of the company are as follows:[2]\n\n\n\n* Mary Barra, Chairman and CEO of General Motors\n* Joseph Ashton, former Vice President of the International Union at United Automobile Workers\n* Linda Gooden, former Vice President of Information Systems and Global Solutions at Lockheed Martin\n* Joseph Jimenez, CEO of Novartis\n* Jane Mendillo, former President and CEO at Harvard Management Company\n* Michael Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\n* James Mulva, former CEO, President, and Chairman at ConocoPhillips\n* Patricia Russo, CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n* Thomas Schoewe, former CFO of Wal-Mart Stores\n* Theodore Solso, former CEO and Chairman of Cummins\n* Carol Stephenson, former dean at Ivey Business School\n* Devin Wenig, former President and CEO of eBay\n* Jon McNeill, CEO of DVx Ventures LLC\n\n### Chairmen of the Board of General Motors[edit]\n\n\n* Thomas Neal\u2014November 19, 1912 \u2013 November 16, 1915\n* Pierre S. du Pont\u2014November 16, 1915 \u2013 February 7, 1929\n* Lammot du Pont II\u2014February 7, 1929 \u2013 May 3, 1937\n* Alfred P.

The program involved five designers, each lending their artistic talents to customize five different vehicles. Nicole Miller, Richard Tyler, Anna Sui, Todd Oldham, and Mark Eisen were tasked with transforming a Cadillac STS, Buick Riviera, GMC Yukon, Oldsmobile Bravada and Chevrolet Camaro Z28, respectively. The cars were then auctioned with the proceeds presented to the Nina Hyde Center at the Greater LA Auto Show in 1997.[215][216][217][218]\n\n\nSince 1997, GM has been a source of funding for Safe Kids Worldwide's \"Safe Kids Buckle Up\" program, an initiative to ensure child automobile safety through education and inspection.[219][220]\n\n\n\n## Labor conflicts[edit]\n\n\nGeneral Motors' American workers are unionized generally under the United Auto Workers (UAW), which is the primary auto workers union in the United States.\n\n\n\n### Flint sit-down strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Flint sit-down strike\n\n![](image)Young striker off sentry duty sleeping on the assembly line of auto seats\nThe 1936\u20131937 Flint sit-down strike against General Motors changed the UAW from a collection of isolated local unions on the fringes of the industry into a major labor union and led to the unionization of the domestic United States automobile industry.\n\n\nAfter the first convention of UAW in 1936, the union decided that it could not survive by piecemeal organizing campaigns at smaller plants, as it had in the past, but that it could organize the automobile industry only by going after its biggest and most powerful employer, General Motors, focusing on GM's production complex in Flint, Michigan.\n\n\nOrganizing in Flint was a difficult and dangerous plan. GM controlled city politics in Flint and kept a close eye on outsiders. According to Wyndham Mortimer, the UAW officer put in charge of the organizing campaign in Flint, he received a death threat by an anonymous caller when he visited Flint in 1936. GM also maintained an extensive network of spies throughout its plants. This forced UAW members to keep the names of new members secret and meeting workers at their homes.\n\n\nAs the UAW studied its target, it discovered that GM had only two factories that produced the dies from which car body components were stamped: one in Flint that produced the parts for Buicks, Pontiacs, and Oldsmobiles, and another in Cleveland that produced Chevrolet parts.\n\n\n\n![](image)National Guardsmen with machine guns overlooking Chevrolet factories number nine and number four\nWhile the UAW called for a sit-down strike in Flint, the police, armed with guns and tear gas, attempted to enter the Fisher Body 2 plant on January 11, 1937. The strikers inside the plant pelted them with hinges, bottles, and bolts. At the time, Vice President John Nance Garner supported federal intervention to break up the Flint Strike, but this idea was rejected by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The president urged GM to distinguish a union so the plants could re-open. The strike ended after 44 days.\n\n\nThat development forced GM to bargain with the union. John L. Lewis, President of the United Mine Workers and founder and leader of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, spoke for the UAW in those negotiations; UAW President Homer Martin was sent on a speaking tour to keep him out of the way. GM's representatives refused to be in the same room as the UAW, so Governor Frank Murphy acted as a courier and intermediary between the two groups. Governor Murphy sent in the U.S. National Guard not to evict the strikers but rather to protect them from the police and corporate strike-breakers. The two parties finally reached an agreement on February 11, 1937, on a one-page agreement that recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for GM's employees, who were union members for the next six months.[221]\n\n\n\n### Tool and die strike of 1939[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tool and die strike of 1939\n\nThe tool and die strike of 1939, also known as the \"strategy strike\", was an ultimately successful attempt by the UAW to be recognized as the sole representative for General Motors workers. In addition to representation rights, the UAW, working jointly with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), sought to resolve existing grievances of skilled workers.\n\n\n\n### United Auto Workers (UAW) strike of 1945\u20131946[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1945-46 United Auto Workers strike\n\nFrom November 21, 1945, until March 13, 1946, (113 days) the UAW organized \"320,000 hourly workers\" to form a US-wide strike against the General Motors Corporation, workers used the tactic of the sit down strike.[222] It was \"the longest strike against a major manufacturer\" that the UAW had yet seen, and it was also \"the longest national GM strike in its history\".[222] As director of the UAW's General Motors Department (coordinator of union relations with GM),[223] Walter Reuther suggested to his colleagues the idea of striking the GM manufacturing plants with a 'one-at-a-time' strategy, which was \"intended to maximize pressure on the target company\".[222] Reuther also put forth the demands of the strikers: a 30 percent increase in wages and a hold on product prices. However, the strike ended with the dissatisfaction of Walter Reuther and the UAW, and the workers received only a 17.5-percent increase in wages.\n\n\n\n### 2007 General Motors strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2007 General Motors strike\n\nThe 2007 General Motors strike was a strike from September 24 to 26, 2007, by the UAW against General Motors.\n\n\nOn September 24, 2007, General Motors workers represented by the UAW union went on strike against the company. The first US-wide strike against GM since 1970 was expected to idle 59 plants and facilities for an indefinite period of time. Talks broke down after more than 20 straight days of bargaining failed to produce a new contract. Major issues that proved to be stumbling blocks for an agreement included wages, benefits, job security and investments in US facilities.[224][225][226]\n\n\nTwo car assembly plants in Oshawa, Ontario and a transmission facility in Windsor closed on September 25. However, on September 26, a tentative agreement was reached, and the strike's end was announced by UAW officials in a news conference at 4 a.m.[227] By the following day, all GM workers in both countries were back to work.\n\n\n\n### 2019 General Motors strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 General Motors strike\n\nOn the morning of September 15, 2019, after talks broke down to renew their contract, which expired earlier that day, the UAW announced that GM employees would begin striking at 11:59 pm.[228] This strike shut down operations in nine states, including 33 manufacturing plants and 22 parts distribution warehouses.[229] After 40 days, on October 25, 2019, the \"longest strike by autoworkers in a decade\" and the longest against GM since 1970 came to an end when United Auto Workers members voted to approve a new contract with GM. Striking labor union members received a $275 a week strike pay salary for the duration of the strike.[230] The strike cost GM more than $2 billion.\n\n\n\n### 2023 United Auto Workers strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 United Auto Workers strike\n\nThe ongoing strike launched by the UAW is the first strike against all three major American automakers in history. Then-recently elected UAW president Shawn Fain stated that he was \"fed up\" with the current situation between workers and automakers; Fain specifically blasted the tiered workers system at automakers, failure for automakers to keep wages up with inflation, pensions, as well as the introduction of a four-day workweek as opposed to the five-day workweek. GM CEO Mary Barra protested that her company offered an \"unprecedented deal\" which gave workers 20% raises as well as \"world-class\" healthcare. Barra further stated that meeting all 1,000 plus demands would bankrupt the company and cost over $100 billion.[231][232]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Streetcar conspiracy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: General Motors streetcar conspiracy\n\nBetween 1938 and 1950, GM allegedly deliberately monopolized the sale of buses and supplies to National City Lines (NCL) and its subsidiaries, in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, intending to dismantle streetcar systems in many cities in the United States and make buses, sold by GM, the dominant form of public transport.\n\n\n\n### Ralph Nader and the Corvair[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1961\u201363 Corvair swing-axle rear suspension\n*Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-In Dangers of the American Automobile* by Ralph Nader, published in 1965, is a book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety. It relates to the first models of the Chevrolet Corvair (1960\u20131964) that had a swing axle suspension design that was prone to 'tuck under' in certain circumstances. To compensate for the removal of a front stabilizer bar (anti-roll bar) as a cost-cutting measure, Corvairs required tire pressures that were outside of the tire manufacturer's recommended tolerances. The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential (15 psi front, 26 psi rear, when cold; 18 psi and 30 psi hot), and if one inflated the tires equally, as was standard practice for all other cars at the time, the result was dangerous over-steer.[233]\n\n\nIn early March 1966, several media outlets, including *The New Republic* and *The New York Times*, alleged that GM had tried to discredit Ralph Nader, hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past, and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations.[234][235] Nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for $425,000. Nader's lawsuit against GM was ultimately decided by the New York Court of Appeals, whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover \"overzealous surveillance\".[236] Nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the pro-consumer Center for Study of Responsive Law.\n\n\nA 1972 safety commission report conducted by Texas A&M University concluded that the 1960\u20131963 Corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations.[237] The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a press release in 1972 describing the findings of NHTSA testing from the previous year. NHTSA conducted a series of comparative tests in 1971 studying the handling of the 1963 Corvair and four contemporary cars \u2014 a Ford Falcon, Plymouth Valiant, Volkswagen Beetle, and Renault Dauphine \u2014 along with a second-generation Corvair (with its completely redesigned, independent rear suspension). The 143-page report reviewed NHTSA's extreme-condition handling tests, national crash-involvement data for the cars in the test as well as General Motors' internal documentation regarding the Corvair's handling.[238] NHTSA went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests. This review panel concluded that 'the 1960\u201363 Corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests ... the handling and stability performance of the 1960\u201363 Corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover, and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic'.\n\n\nFormer GM executive John DeLorean asserted, in his book *On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors*, that Nader's criticisms were valid.[239]\n\n\nJournalist David E. Davis noted that despite Nader's claim that swing-axle rear suspension were dangerous, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen all used similar swing-axle concepts during that era.[240]\n\n\n\n### Apartheid[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, GM (along with other multinational corporations) was sued by a group of South Africans represented by the Khulumani Support Group.[241] The plaintiffs alleged that the company provided vehicles to the South African security forces during the Apartheid. The company settled with the plaintiffs in 2012, agreeing to pay a sum of up to $1.5 million.[242]\n\n\n\n### Ignition switch recall[edit]\n\n\nMain article: General Motors ignition switch recalls\n\nIn May 2014, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration fined the company $35 million for failing to recall cars with faulty ignition switches for a decade, despite knowing there was a problem with the switches. General Motors paid compensation for 124 deaths linked to the faulty switches.[243] The $35 million fine was the maximum the regulator could impose.[244] The total cost of the recall was estimated to be $1.5 billion.[142] As well as the Cobalts, the switches of concern had been installed in many other cars, such as the Pontiac G5, the Saturn Ion, the Chevrolet HHR, the Saturn Sky, and Pontiac Solstice. The recall involved about 2.6 million GM cars worldwide.[245]\n\n\n\n### Xinjiang region[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute accused at least 82 major brands, including General Motors, of being connected to forced Uyghur labor in Xinjiang.[246]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![flag](image)Michigan portal\n* ![](image)Cars portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers\n* ASOTRECOL\n* Crucible Industries\n* EcoCAR\n* General Motors Hy-wire\n* General Motors proving grounds\n* General Motors Technical Center\n* GM people\n* GM vehicles by brand\n* List of automobile manufacturers of the United States\n* List of GM engines\n* List of General Motors factories\n* List of General Motors platforms\n* List of GM transmissions\n* United States Council for Automotive Research\n* VIA Motors\n* Freon\n* Global Climate Coalition\n* Ethyl Corporation\n* Durant Motors\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Department of State, Division of Corporations (General Information Name Search)\".

Founded in 1937 by the German Labour Front under the Nazi Party and revived into a global brand after World War II by the British Army officer Ivan Hirst, it is known for the iconic Beetle and serves as the flagship brand of the Volkswagen Group, the largest automotive manufacturer by worldwide sales in 2016 and 2017.[1] The group's biggest market is in China, which delivers 40 percent of its sales and profits.[2][3] Its name is derived from the German-language terms *Volk* and *Wagen*, translating to \"people's car\" when combined.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1932\u20131940: People's Car project[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Model of Porsche Type 12 (Z\u00fcndapp), Museum of Industrial Culture, Nuremberg\nVolkswagen was established in 1937 by the German Labour Front (German: *Deutsche Arbeitsfront*) as part of the Strength Through Joy (German: *Kraft durch Freude*) program in Berlin.[4] In the early 1930s, cars were a luxury \u2013 most Germans could afford nothing more elaborate than a motorcycle, and only one German out of 50 owned a car. Seeking a potential new market, some car makers began independent \"people's car\" projects\u00a0\u2013 the Mercedes 170H, BMW 3/15, Adler AutoBahn, Steyr 55 and Hanomag 1.3L, among others.\n\n\nThe growing trend was not nascent; B\u00e9la Bar\u00e9nyi, a pioneering automotive engineer, is credited as already having conceived the basic design during the mid-1920s. Josef Ganz developed the Standard Superior (going as far as advertising it as the \"German Volkswagen\"). In Germany, the company Hanomag mass-produced the 2/10 PS \"Kommissbrot\", a small, cheap rear-engined car, from 1925 to 1928.[5] Also, in Czechoslovakia, the Hans Ledwinka designed Tatra T77, a very popular car amongst the German elite, was becoming smaller and more affordable at each revision. Ferdinand Porsche, a well-known designer for high-end vehicles and race cars, had been trying for years to get a manufacturer interested in a small car suitable for a family. He built a car named the \"Volksauto\" from the ground up in 1933, using many popular ideas and several of his own, putting together a car with an air-cooled rear engine, torsion bar suspension, and a \"beetle\" shape, the front bonnet rounded for better aerodynamics (necessary as it had a small engine).[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)VW logo during the 1930s, initials surrounded by a stylised cogwheel and a spinning propeller that looked like a swastika[7]\nIn 1934, with many of the above projects still in development or early stages of production, Adolf Hitler became involved, ordering the production of a basic vehicle capable of transporting two adults and three children at 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph). He wanted a car every German family would be able to afford.[6] The \"People's Car\" would be available through a savings plan at 990\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01 (US$396 in 1938)\u2014about the price of a small motorcycle (the average income being around 32\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01 a week).[8][9]\n\n\nIt soon became apparent that private industry could not turn out a car for only 990\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01. Thus, Hitler chose to sponsor an all-new, state-owned factory using Ferdinand Porsche's design (with some of Hitler's design suggestions, including an air-cooled engine so nothing could freeze). The intention was that German families could buy the car through a savings scheme (*\"*F\u00fcnf Mark die Woche musst du sparen, willst du im eigenen Wagen fahren*\"\u00a0\u2013 \"Five Marks a week you must set aside, if in your own car you wish to ride*\"), which around 336,000 people eventually paid into.[10] However, the project was not commercially viable, and only government support was able to keep it afloat.[11][Note 2] Due to the outbreak of war in 1939, none of the participants in the savings scheme ever received a car. In 1950, a lawsuit was issued that, after 12 years of trial, ultimately provided a credit of 12% off the list price of a new VW base model or 5-times less the value paid into the saving scheme.[12]\n\n\nPrototypes of the car called the *KdF-Wagen* (from the German term *Kraft durch Freude*, meaning \"Strength Through Joy\") appeared from 1938 onwards (the first cars had been produced in Stuttgart). The car already had its distinctive round shape and air-cooled, flat-four, rear-mounted engine. The VW car was just one of many *KdF* programs, which included things such as tours and outings. The prefix *Volks* (\"People's\") was not just applied to cars, but also to other products in Germany \u2013 the *Volksempf\u00e4nger* radio receiver for instance. On 28 May 1937, *Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung des Deutschen Volkswagens mbH* (\"Company for the Preparation of the German Volkswagen Ltd.\"), or *Gezuvor*[13] for short, was established by the *Deutsche Arbeitsfront* in Berlin. More than a year later, on 16 September 1938, it was renamed to *Volkswagenwerk GmbH*.[14][15]\n\n\n\n![](image)VW Type 82E\nErwin Komenda, the longstanding Auto Union chief designer, part of Ferdinand Porsche's hand-picked team,[6] developed the car body of the prototype, which was recognisably the Beetle known today. It was one of the first cars designed with the aid of a wind tunnel\u2014a method used for German aircraft design since the early 1920s. The car designs were put through rigorous tests and achieved a record-breaking million miles of testing before being deemed finished.\n\n\nThe construction of the new factory started in May 1938 in the new town of \"Stadt des KdF-Wagens\" (renamed Wolfsburg after the war), which had been purpose-built for the factory workers.[14] This factory had only produced a handful of cars by the time war started in 1939. None were actually delivered to any holder of the completed saving stamp books, though one Type 1 Cabriolet was presented to Hitler on 20 April 1944 (his 55th birthday).[14]\n\n\n\n### 1939\u20131944: Wartime production and Nazi concentration camp labour[edit]\n\n\nWar changed production to military vehicles\u2014the Type 82 *K\u00fcbelwagen* (\"Bucket car\") utility vehicle (VW's most common wartime model), and the amphibious *Schwimmwagen*\u2014manufactured for German forces. One of the first foreigners to drive a Volkswagen was the American war correspondent Ernie Pyle, who had the use of a captured Volkswagen for a few days after the Allied victory in Tunisia in May 1943.[16] As was common with much of the production in Nazi Germany during the war, slave labour was utilised in the Volkswagen plant, e.g. from Arbeitsdorf concentration camp. The company would admit in 1998 that it used 15,000 slaves during the war effort. German historians estimated that 80% of Volkswagen's wartime workforce was slave labour.[17] Many of the slaves were reported to have been supplied from the concentration camps upon request from plant managers. A lawsuit was filed in 1998 by survivors for restitution for the forced labour.[18] Volkswagen would set up a voluntary restitution fund.[19]\n\n\n\n### 1945\u20131948: British military intervention[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen industrial plant in Wolfsburg, pictured in 2006\nIn April 1945, KdF-Stadt and its heavily bombed factory were captured by the United States armed forces and subsequently handed over to the British, within whose occupation zone the town and factory fell. The factory was placed under the control of British Army officer Major Ivan Hirst, REME, a civilian Military Governor with the occupying forces. At first, one plan was to use it for military vehicle maintenance, and possibly dismantle and ship it to Britain. Since it had been used for military production, (though not of KdF-Wagens) and had been in Hirst's words, a \"political animal\" rather than a commercial enterprise \u2013 technically making it liable for destruction under the terms of the Potsdam Agreement \u2013 the equipment could have been salvaged as war reparations. Allied dismantling policy changed in late 1946 to mid-1947, though heavy industry continued to be dismantled until 1951.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOne of the factory's wartime 'KdF-Wagen' cars had been taken to the factory for repairs and abandoned there. Hirst had it repainted green and demonstrated it to British Army headquarters. Short of light transport, in September 1945 the British Army was persuaded to place a vital order for 20,000 cars. However, production facilities had been massively disrupted, there was a refugee crisis at and around the factory, and some parts (such as carburettors) were unavailable. Hirst and his German assistant Heinrich Nordhoff (who went on to run the Wolfsburg facility after the military government ended in 1949) helped to stabilise the acute social situation while simultaneously re-establishing production. Hirst, for example, used his engineering experience to arrange the manufacture of carburettors, the original producers being effectively 'lost' in the Soviet zone.[20] The first few hundred cars went to personnel from the occupying forces, and to Australia Post. Some British service personnel were allowed to take their Beetles back to the United Kingdom when they were demobilised.[21][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nIn 1986, Hirst said that factory workers were, after many years of Nazi conditioning, initially reluctant to follow his orders; to counter this, he had his military uniform brought back from Britain and wore it in the factory, after which he reported having no problems even though he was no longer a soldier at the time but a civilian member of the military government.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe post-war industrial plans for Germany set out rules that governed which industries Germany was allowed to retain. These rules set German car production at a maximum of 10% of 1936 car production.[22] By 1946, the factory produced 1,000 cars a month even though it was still in disrepair. Owing to roof and window damage, production had to stop when it rained, and the company had to barter new vehicles for steel for production.[23]\n\n\nThe car and its town changed their Second World War-era names to \"Volkswagen\" and \"Wolfsburg\" respectively, and production increased. It was still unclear what was to become of the factory. It was offered to representatives from the American, Australian, British, and French motor industries who all rejected it. After an inspection of the plant, Sir William Rootes, head of the British Rootes Group, told Hirst the project would fail within two years, and that the car \"...is quite unattractive to the average motorcar buyer, is too ugly and too noisy. If you think you're going to build cars in this place, you're a bloody fool, young man.\"[24] The official report said: \"To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise.\"[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cogeneration plant\nFord representatives were equally critical. In March 1948, the British offered the Volkswagen company to Ford, free of charge. Henry Ford II, the son of Edsel Ford, travelled to West Germany for discussions. Heinz Nordhoff was also present, as well as Ernest Breech, chairman of the board for Ford. Henry Ford II looked to Breech for his opinion, and Breech said, \"Mr. Ford, I don't think what we're being offered here is worth a damn!\"[26] Ford passed on the offer, leaving Volkswagen to rebuild itself under Nordhoff's leadership.[27]\n\n\n\n### 1948\u20131961: Icon of post-war West Germany[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1949 Volkswagen \"split rear window\" Sedan\n![](image)Volkswagen Cabriolet (1953)\n![](image)Volkswagen Type 2 (T1)\n![](image)An original 1300 Deluxe, circa 1966\n![](image)In the later 1960s, as the worldwide demand for the Beetle finally began to diminish, a variety of successor designs were proposed and, in most cases, rejected by management.\nFrom 1948, Volkswagen became an important element, symbolically and economically, of West German regeneration.[*according to whom?*] Heinrich Nordhoff (1899\u20131968), a former senior manager at Opel who had overseen civilian and military vehicle production in the 1930s and 1940s, was recruited to run the factory in 1948. In 1949, Major Hirst left the company\u2014now re-formed as a trust controlled by the West German government and government of the State of Lower Saxony. The \"Beetle\" sedan or \"peoples' car\" Volkswagen is the Type 1. Apart from the introduction of the Volkswagen Type 2 commercial vehicle (van, pick-up, and camper), and the VW Karmann Ghia sports car, Nordhoff pursued the one-model policy until shortly before his death in 1968.\n\n\nVolkswagens were first exhibited and sold in the United States in 1949 but sold only two units in America that first year. On entry to the US market, the VW was briefly sold as a *Victory Wagon*. Volkswagen of America was formed in April 1955 to standardise sales and service in the United States. Production of the Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle increased dramatically over the years, the total reaching one million in 1955.\n\n\nThe UK's first official Volkswagen importer, Colborne Garages of Ripley, Surrey, started business with importing parts for the models brought home by soldiers returning from Germany.[21]\n\n\nCanadian Motors, Limited brought in Canada's first shipment of Volkswagens on 10 July 1952 (shipping order 143075).[*citation needed*] The order consisted of 12 vehicles, (3) model 11C, a black, green, and sand colour (3) 11GS, a chestnut brown and two azure blue, (2) 24A-M51 in red, (1) 21A in blue, (1) 23A in blue, (1) 22A beige colour, and one ambulance.[*citation needed*] Volkswagens were seen in Canada for the first time at the Canadian National Exhibition in August 1952 and were accepted enthusiastically. (At least one Type 2 bus from this order still exists, and is currently in France undergoing restoration).[*citation needed*] The first shipment for Volkswagen Canada reached Toronto in early December 1952. (At least one Type 1 from this first shipment still exists, and was driven on a nationwide tour for Volkswagen Canada's 60th year of business festivities in 2012).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBy 1955, sales warranted the building of the Volkswagen plant on a 32-acre (13\u00a0ha) site on Scarborough's Golden Mile. To this, a 60,000-square-foot (5,600\u00a0m2) building with administration, showrooms, service, repairs and parts was built in 1957, with storage for $4,000,000 of parts.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1959, VW started production at a plant near S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil.[28] Volkswagen do Brasil was accused of spying on workers during the time of the military dictatorship in the 1970s and informing police on oppositional activities. In 1976, mass arrests occurred and some VW employees were tortured. In 1979, Brazilian VW workers travelled to Wolfsburg to inform the CEO in person. In 2015, activists and former VW employees in Brazil spoke out in public accused the company's silence about the persecution of its workers. In fall 2016, VW commissioned an expert review of the situation due end of 2017.[29]\n\n\nOn 22 August 1960, *Volkswagenwerk GmbH* was renamed to *Volkswagenwerk AG*. Sales soared throughout the 1960s, peaking at the end of the decade thanks in part to the famous advertising campaigns by New York advertising agency Doyle, Dane Bernbach.[*citation needed*] Led by art director Helmut Krone, and copywriters Julian Koenig and Bob Levinson, Volkswagen advertisements became[*when?*] as popular as the car, using crisp layouts and witty copy to lure the younger, sophisticated consumers with whom the car became associated.[*citation needed*] Even though it was almost universally known as the Beetle (or the Bug), it was never officially labelled as such by the manufacturer, instead referred to as the Type 1.[30]\n\n\nAlthough the car was becoming outdated, during the 1960s and early 1970s, American exports, innovative advertising, and a growing reputation for reliability helped production figures surpass the levels of the previous record-holder, the Ford Model T. On 17 February 1972, the 15,007,034th Beetle was sold. Volkswagen could now claim the world production record for the most-produced, single make of car in history. By 1973, total production was over 16 million.\n\n\nTo commemorate its passing the Ford Model T's record sales mark and its victories in the Baja 1000 Mexican races from 1967 to 1971, Volkswagen produced its first limited-edition Beetle. It was marketed as the \"Baja Champion SE\"[31] in the United States and the \"Marathon\" Superbeetle in the rest of the world. It featured unique \"Marathon Blau\" metallic blue paint, steel-pressed 10-spoke 15-inch (38\u00a0cm) magnesium-alloy wheels, a commemorative metal plate mounted on the glovebox and a certificate of authenticity presented to the original purchaser. Dealer-installed options for this limited-edition Superbeetle included the following: white stripes running the length of the rocker-panel, a special shifter knob, bumper overriders, tapered exhaust tips, fake walnut inserts in the dashboard (behind the steering wheel and the glovebox cover) as well as Bosch fog lights mounted on the front bumper.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 1961\u20131973: Beetle to Golf[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1963 VW Type 3 Notchback\nThe 1961 Type 1 Beetle had a 36\u00a0hp 1200cc four cylinder air-cooled flat-four opposed OHV engine made of aluminium alloy block and heads. By 1966, the Type 1 came with a 1300cc engine. By 1967 the Type 1 had a 1500cc engine, and 1600cc in 1970. The air-cooled engine lost favour in the United States market with the advent of unleaded petrol and smog controls. These air-cooled engines were commonly tuned to be fuel-rich in order to control engine over-heating, and this led to excessive carbon monoxide emissions. VW production equipment was eventually moved to Mexico where vehicle emissions were not regulated. Beetles were popular on the US West Coast where the limited-capacity cabin heating was less inconvenient. Beetles were popularised on the US West Coast as beach buggies and dune buggies.\n\n\nVW expanded its product line in 1961 with the introduction of four Type 3 models (Karmann Ghia, Notchback, Fastback, and Variant) based on the new Type 3 mechanical underpinnings. The name 'Squareback' was used in the United States for the Variant.\n\n\nIn 1969 the larger Type 4 (411 and 412) models were introduced. These differed substantially from previous vehicles, with the notable introduction of monocoque/unibody construction, the option of a fully automatic transmission, electronic fuel injection, and a sturdier powerplant.\n\n\nIn 1964, Volkswagen acquired Auto Union, and in 1969, NSU Motorenwerke AG (NSU). The former company owned the historic Audi brand, which had disappeared after the Second World War. VW ultimately merged Auto Union and NSU to create the modern Audi company, and would go on to develop it as its luxury vehicle marque. The purchase of Auto Union and NSU was a pivotal point in Volkswagen's history, as both companies yielded the technological expertise that proved necessary for VW to survive when demand for its air-cooled models went into decline.\n\n\n\n![](image)1970 VW Squareback (Type III)\nVolkswagen added a \"Super Beetle\"[32] (the Type 131) to its lineup in 1971. The Type 131 differed from the standard Beetle in its use of a MacPherson strut front suspension instead of the usual torsion bars. The Super Beetle featured a new hooded, padded dash and curved windshield (from 1973 model year on up). Rack and pinion steering replaced recirculating ball steering gears in the model year 1975 and up. The front of the car was stretched 2 inches (51\u00a0mm) to allow the spare tire to lie flat, and the combination of these two features increased the usable front luggage space.\n\n\nIn 1973, Volkswagen introduced the military-themed Type 181, or \"Trekker\" in Europe, \"Thing\" in America, recalling the wartime Type 82. The military version was produced for the NATO-era German Army during the Cold War years of 1970 to 1979. The US Thing version only sold for two years, 1973 and 1974.\n\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Type 4 assembly line in Wolfsburg as of 1973\nBy late 1972, Volkswagen had decided to cancel the nearly finished typ 266, a project for a mid-engined car to replace the Beetle, and to focus on front-wheel-drive, water-cooled cars. Rudolf Leiding, recently made head of Volkswagen, cited noise, heat, and servicing problems with the mid-engine layout, as well as the difficulty of making it a station wagon.[33]\n\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Passat (1973\u20131977 model)\nVolkswagen was in serious trouble by 1973.[34] The Type 3 and Type 4 models had sold in much smaller numbers than the Beetle and the NSU-based K70 also failed to sell. Beetle sales had started to decline rapidly in European and North American markets. The company knew that Beetle production had to end, but faced a conundrum of how to replace it. VW's ownership of Audi/Auto Union proved beneficial. Its expertise in front-wheel drive, and water-cooled engines would help Volkswagen produce a credible Beetle successor. Audi influences paved the way for this new generation of Volkswagens: the Passat, Scirocco, Golf, and Polo.\n\n\nFirst in the series was the Volkswagen Passat (Dasher in the US), introduced in 1973, a fastback version of the Audi 80, using many identical body and mechanical parts. Estate/wagon versions were available in many markets. In Europe, the estate/wagon version dominated market share for many years.\n\n\nIn spring 1974, the Scirocco followed. The coupe was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro. Based on the platform of the not yet released Golf, it was built at Karmann due to capacity constraints at Volkswagen.\n\n\nThe pivotal model emerged as the Volkswagen Golf in 1974, marketed in the United States and Canada as the Rabbit for the 1st generation (1975\u20131985) and 5th generation (2006\u20132009). Its angular styling was designed by the Italian Giorgetto Giugiaro. Its design followed trends for small family cars set by the 1959 Mini\u00a0\u2013 the Golf had a transversely mounted, water-cooled engine in the front, driving the front wheels, and had a hatchback, a format that has dominated the market segment ever since. Beetle production at Wolfsburg ended upon the Golf's introduction. It continued in smaller numbers at other German factories (Hanover and Emden) until 1978, but mainstream production shifted to Brazil and Mexico.\n\n\nIn 1975, the Volkswagen Polo followed. It was a re-badged Audi 50, which was soon discontinued in 1978. The Polo became the base of the Volkswagen Derby, which was introduced in 1977. The Derby was for all intents and purposes a three-box design of the Polo. After a second model generation, the Derby was discontinued in 1985, although the body style lived on in the form of the Polo classic/Polo saloon until 1991.\n\n\nPassat, Scirocco, Golf, and Polo shared many character-defining features, as well as parts and engines. They built the basis for Volkswagen's turn-around.\n\n\n\n### 1974\u20131990: Product line expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Polo (1975\u20131979 model)\nWhile Volkswagen's range of cars soon became similar to that of other large European car makers, the Golf has been the mainstay of the Volkswagen line-up since its introduction, and the mechanical basis for several other cars of the company. There have been eight generations of the Volkswagen Golf, the first of which was produced from the summer of 1974 until the autumn of 1983 (sold as the Rabbit in the United States and Canada and as the Caribe in Latin America). Its chassis also spawned the Volkswagen Scirocco sport coupe, Volkswagen Jetta saloon/sedan, Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet convertible, and Volkswagen Caddy pick-up. North American production of the Rabbit commenced at the Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly Plant near New Stanton, Pennsylvania in 1978. It would be produced in the United States as the Rabbit until the spring of 1984.[*citation needed*] The second-generation Golf hatchback/Jetta sedan ran from October 1983 until the autumn of 1991, and a North American version produced at Westmoreland Assembly went on sale at the start of the 1985 model year. The production numbers of the first-generation Golf has continued to grow annually in South Africa as the Citi Golf, with only minor modifications to the interior, engine and chassis, using tooling relocated from the New Stanton, Pennsylvania plant when that site began to build the Second Generation car.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Volkswagen's sales in the United States and Canada fell dramatically, despite the success of models like the Golf elsewhere. Sales in the United States were 293,595 in 1980, but by 1984 they were down to 177,709.[35] The introduction of the second-generation Golf, GTI and Jetta models helped Volkswagen briefly in North America. Motor Trend named the GTI its Car of the Year for 1985, and Volkswagen rose in the J.D. Power buyer satisfaction ratings to eighth place in 1985, up from 22nd a year earlier.[36] VW's American sales broke 200,000 in 1985 and 1986 before resuming the downward trend from earlier in the decade. Chairman Carl Hahn decided to expand the company elsewhere (mostly in developing countries), and the New Stanton, Pennsylvania factory closed on 14 July 1988.[37] Meanwhile, four years after signing a cooperation agreement with the Spanish car maker SEAT in 1982, Hahn expanded the company by purchasing a majority share of SEAT up to 75% by the end of 1986, which VW bought outright in 1990.[38] On 4 July 1985, *Volkswagenwerk AG* was renamed to *Volkswagen AG*.\n\n\nVolkswagen entered the supermini market in 1975 with the Volkswagen Polo, a stylish and spacious three-door hatchback designed by Bertone. It was a strong seller in West Germany and most of the rest of Western Europe, being one of the first foreign small cars to prove popular in Britain. It had started out in 1974 as the Audi 50, which was only available in certain markets and was less popular. The Polo entered a market sector already being dominated by the Fiat 127 and Renault 5, and which before long would also include the Austin Metro and Ford Fiesta.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1981, the second-generation Polo launched as a hatchback (resembling a small estate car). In 1983 the range was expanded, with the introduction of a Coupe (similar to a conventional hatchback), and the Classic (a 2-door saloon).[39] The Polo's practicality, despite the lack of a five-door version, helped ensure even stronger sales than its predecessor. It continued to sell well after a makeover in 1990, finally being replaced by an all-new version in 1994.[40] Also arriving in 1981 were the second generation of the larger Passat and a second generation of the Volkswagen Scirocco coupe.\n\n\nIn 1983 the MK2 Golf was launched. At the beginning of 1988, the third generation Passat was the next major car launch and Volkswagen did not produce a hatchback version of this Passat, despite the rising popularity of the hatchback body style throughout Europe.[*citation needed*] Just after launching the B3 Passat, Volkswagen launched the Corrado, analogous to the Scirocco, although the Scirocco remained in production until 1992; a third generation of Scirocco was in production 2008\u201317.[41]\n\n\n\n### 1991\u20131999[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Golf, in North American form\nIn 1991, Volkswagen launched the third-generation Golf, which was European Car of the Year for 1992. The Golf Mk3 and Jetta Mk3 arrived in North America in 1993. The sedan version of the Golf was badged Vento in Europe but remained Jetta in the United States. The Scirocco and the later Corrado were both Golf-based coup\u00e9s.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen New Beetle\nIn 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the J Mays-designed Concept One, a \"retro\"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, based on the platform of the Polo. Due to a positive response to the concept, a production version was developed as the New Beetle, based on the Golf's larger platform.[42]\n\n\nIn 1995 the Sharan was launched in Europe, the result of a joint venture with Ford, which also resulted in the Ford Galaxy and SEAT Alhambra.[43]\n\n\nThe company's evolution of its model range was continued with the Golf Mk4, introduced at the end of 1997 (North America in 1999), its chassis spawned a host of other cars within the Volkswagen Group; the Volkswagen Bora (the sedan known as the Jetta in the United States), SEAT Toledo, SEAT Le\u00f3n, Audi A3, Audi TT, and \u0160koda Octavia. Other main models during the decade include the Polo, a smaller car than the Golf, and the larger Passat for the segment above the Golf.\n\n\nIn 1998 the company launched the new Lupo city car. In 1999 they announced the first \"3-litre\" car, a lightweight version of the Lupo that could travel 100\u00a0km with only 3-liters of diesel\u2014making it the world's most fuel efficient car at the time.[44]\n\n\n\n### 2000\u20132016: Further expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The fifth generation Volkswagen Jetta\nVolkswagen began introducing an array of new models after Bernd Pischetsrieder became Volkswagen Group CEO (responsible for all Group brands) in 2002. The sixth-generation VW Golf was launched in 2008, came runner-up to the Opel/Vauxhall Insignia in the 2009 European Car of the Year, and has spawned several cousins: VW Jetta, VW Scirocco, SEAT Le\u00f3n, SEAT Toledo, \u0160koda Octavia and Audi A3 hatchback ranges, as well as a new mini-MPV, the SEAT Altea. The GTI, a \"hot hatch\" performance version of the Golf, boasts a 2.0\u00a0L Turbocharged Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) direct injection engine. VW began marketing the Golf under the Rabbit name once again in the US and Canada in 2006.\n\n\nThe sixth-generation Passat and the fifth-generation Jetta both debuted in 2005, and Volkswagen announced plans to expand its lineup further by bringing back the Scirocco by 2008. Other models in Wolfgang Bernhard's (Volkswagen brand CEO) \"product offensive\" include the Tiguan mid-sized SUV in 2008 and a Passat Coup\u00e9. In November 2006 Bernd Pischetsrieder announced his resignation as Volkswagen Group CEO and was replaced by Audi worldwide CEO Martin Winterkorn at the beginning of 2007.\n\n\n\n![](image)The third generation Volkswagen Scirocco\nVolkswagen maintained North American sales of 224,195 in 2005. The momentum continued for fiscal 2006, as Volkswagen's North American sales for the year were 235,140 vehicles, a 4.9 per cent increase over 2005, despite a slump in domestic North American manufacturer's sales. In conjunction with the introduction of new models, the production location of Volkswagen vehicles also underwent a great change. The 2007 Eos, a hardtop convertible, is produced in a new facility in Portugal. All Golfs/Rabbits and GTIs as of 2006 are manufactured in Wolfsburg, Germany, rather than Puebla, Mexico, where Golfs and GTIs for the North American market were produced from 1989 to 1998, and the Brazilian factory in Curitiba, where Golfs and GTIs were produced from 1999 to 2006 (the Jetta has been primarily manufactured in Mexico since 1989). Volkswagen is also in the process of reconfiguring an automotive assembly plant in Belgium. The new models and investments in manufacturing improvements were immediately noticed by automotive critics. Favourable reviews for Volkswagen's newest cars include the GTI being named by *Consumer Reports* as the top sporty car under $25,000, one of *Car and Driver* magazine's \"10 Best\" for 2007, *Automobile* Magazine's 2007 Car of the Year, as well as a 2008 *Motor Trend* comparison ranking the mid-size Passat first in its class.\n\n\n\n![](image)The seventh-generation Volkswagen Golf\nVolkswagen partnered with Daimler AG and other companies to market the BlueTec clean diesel technology on cars and trucks from Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and other companies and brands. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, four of the ten most fuel-efficient vehicles available for sale in the United States are powered by Volkswagen diesel engines.[45] Volkswagen has offered a number of its vehicles with a TDI (Turbocharged Direct Injection) engine, which lends class-leading fuel economy to several models. They were a three-way tie for 8th (TDI Beetle, TDI Golf, TDI Jetta) and ninth, the TDI Jetta Wagon. In addition, all Volkswagen TDI diesel engines produced from 1996 to 2006 can be driven on 100% biodiesel fuel.[*citation needed*] For the 2007 model year, however, strict US government emissions regulations had forced Volkswagen to drop most diesels from their US engine lineup, but a new lineup of diesel engines (then thought) compatible to US standards returned to the American market starting with Model Year 2009. These post-2009 Clean Diesel engines are limited to running on 5% (B5) biodiesel only to maintain Volkswagen's warranty. Volkswagen long resisted adding a SUV to its lineup, but relented with the introduction of the Touareg, made in partnership with Porsche, while they worked on the Porsche Cayenne and later the Audi Q7. Though acclaimed as a fine handling vehicle, the Touareg has been a modest seller at best, and it has been criticised by auto reviewers for its absence of a third-row seat, the relatively poor fuel economy, and the high vehicle mass. Volkswagen set plans to add a compact SUV with styling influences from the \"Concept A\" concept vehicle introduced at the 2006 Geneva Auto Show, and on 20 July 2006, Volkswagen announced that the new vehicle called the Tiguan.\n\n\nSince the discontinuation of the T4 in 2003 and the decision not to export the T5 to the United States, Volkswagen, coincidentally, lacked a van for its North American lineup. To remedy this, Volkswagen launched the Volkswagen Routan, a badge-engineered Dodge Grand Caravan made for the American and Canadian markets, in 2008.\n\n\nIn September 2006, Volkswagen began offering the City Golf and City Jetta only for the Canadian market. Both models were originally the Mk4 Golf and Jetta but were later replaced with the Brazilian versions of the Golf Mk4 and Bora. Volkswagen's introduction of such models is seen as a test of the market for a subcompact and, if successful, may be the beginnings of a thriving subcompact market for Volkswagen.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen Passat (3C)\nIn May 2011, Volkswagen completed Chattanooga Assembly in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The Chattanooga Assembly plant marked VW's first plant since the plant at New Stanton was closed down. The facility has produced Volkswagen cars and SUVs specifically designed for the North American markets, beginning with the Passat B7 in 2011. The company recently announced plans to expand further by investing $900\u00a0million to add floor space to the factory.[46]\n\n\nThe VW XL1 began a limited production run in 2013. The XL1 is a lightweight and fuel-efficient two-person vehicle (only 795\u00a0kg).\n\n\nThe Volkswagen Atlas, a large crossover SUV, began production in late 2016, and aimed to help end several years of losses for Volkswagen in the United States, the world's second-largest auto market.[47][48] On 14 September 2016, Volkswagen announced its partnership with three Israeli cybersecurity experts to create a new company, Cymotive, dedicated to automotive security.[49]\n\n\n\n### 2017\u2013present: Focus on electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen ID.3\nIn 2017, Volkswagen announced plans to place a considerable focus on electric vehicles (EV), with a goal to, by 2025, launch at least 30 EV models, and have 20 to 25 per cent of their total yearly sales volume (2\u20133 million) consist of EVs.[50] In September, Volkswagen CEO Matthias M\u00fcller stated that the company aimed to have electric versions of all of its vehicle models by 2030, at a cost of 20\u00a0billion euro, and 50\u00a0billion euro on acquisition of batteries.[51] On 6 March 2017 at the Geneva Motor Show Volkswagen presented its prototype for a fully autonomous car, Sedric.[52]\n\n\nVolkswagen returned to motorsport in 2018 by unveiling its all-electric I.D. R. At the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb, Romain Dumas set an all-time course record of just under eight minutes driving the I.D. R.[53]\n\n\nIn September 2018, Volkswagen announced that it would discontinue production of the Beetle (A5) in 2019.[54] Also in September 2018, Volkswagen announced its $100 million investment in Silicon Valley-based solid-state battery startup QuantumScape, becoming the startup's largest automotive investor and gaining representation on its board.[55]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Volkswagen announced that it would launch an entry-level Jetta sub-brand in China aimed at young buyers. Three models were announced in July 2019, a sedan and two SUVs,[56] all three of which will be manufactured in China as a part of Volkswagen's joint-venture with FAW.[57]\n\n\nIn September 2019 at the Frankfurt Motor Show, Volkswagen officially unveiled a refreshed logo (a thinner, two-dimensional version of the previous logo) and new sonic branding, which will accompany the newly launched ID.3 electric vehicle. Volkswagen stated that the ID.3 signified the start of a \"new era\" of the company.[58]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Volkswagen also announced a program to allow old Beetle models to be converted to run on electric power. The electric motor and battery updates will be done in partnership with German company eClassics.[59] The electric components used for retrofitting will be based upon those found in the e-up! model.\n\n\nIn November 2020, Volkswagen announced that, trying to remain the world's largest carmaker in the green era, it has increased its investment in electric and self-driving cars to $86 billion over the next five years.[60]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Volkswagen announced that its sales in 2020 dropped by 9.9% in China, 23.4% in western Europe and 17.1% in North America.[61]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Volkswagen announced that it would stop developing new internal combustion engines, although it would keep tweaking existing engines to comply with stricter emission rules.[62][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\nAlso, the company announced it was changing the American division's name to \"Voltswagen\", with the help of Johannes Leonardo, before revealing the move to be a hoax. In a tweet, the company said, the stunt \"got the whole world buzzing.\" However, some news sources considered the announcement to be real, including the Associated Press, whose headline about being fooled stated, \"Volkswagen caught lying again, this time about changing its name.\"[63]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Volkswagen released the ID. Buzz electric minivan.[64]\n\n\nOn May 11, 2022, Volkswagen confirmed the relaunch of its Scout off-road vehicle brand, this time as an EV.[65] Production is set to begin in 2026, and this relaunch will be the first time that VW creates a new brand based solely in the U.S. market.[66]\n\n\nIn July 2022 Volkswagen noted the development of the first of their own *Gigafactories*.[67] The site, based in Salzgitter in Germany, has been termed *Mission SalzGiga*. The new business unit is focused on all of Volkswagen's battery activities \"from raw materials and the cell right through to recycling\", and is part of a \u20ac20 billion investment.[67]\n\n\nOn Sep 2022 Volkswagen introduces the ID. XTREME1 off-road Electric concept Car, an off-road electric SUV.[68]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **appears to be slanted towards recent events.** Please try to keep recent events in historical perspective and add more content related to non-recent events. *(July 2017)*\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Global sales figures,2006\u20132018[69] |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | Sales (in millions) |\n| 2006\n | 5.7\n |\n| 2007\n | 6.2\n |\n| 2008\n | 6.3\n |\n| 2009\n | 6.3\n |\n| 2010\n | 7.3\n |\n| 2011\n | 8.4\n |\n| 2012\n | 9.3\n |\n| 2013\n | 9.7\n |\n| 2014\n | 10.2\n |\n| 2015\n | 10.0\n |\n| 2016\n | 10.3\n |\n| 2017\n | 10.7[70] |\n| 2018\n | 10.8[71] |\n| 2019\n | 11.0[72] |\n\n\nVolkswagen is the founding and namesake member of the Volkswagen Group, a large international corporation in charge of multiple car and truck brands, including Audi, SEAT, Porsche, Lamborghini, Bentley, Bugatti, Scania, MAN, and \u0160koda. Volkswagen Group's global headquarters are located in Volkswagen's historic home of Wolfsburg, Germany.[73][74]\n\n\nVolkswagen Group, as a unit, is Europe's largest motor vehicle manufacturer, with over 74,000 employees and over 7,700 dealerships.[75] For a long time, Volkswagen has had a market share over 20 per cent.[76]\n\n\nIn 2010, Volkswagen posted record sales of 6.29\u00a0million vehicles, with its global market share at 11.4%.[77] In 2008, Volkswagen became the third-largest car maker in the world,[78] and, as of 2016, Volkswagen was the second largest manufacturer worldwide.[79] In 2018 the company benefited from trade tariffs and new emission standards, with a record deliveries of 10.8 million vehicles.[80] Volkswagen Group's core markets include Germany and China.[81]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Volkswagen invested $2.6 billion in Argo AI, a startup focused on developing self-driving vehicles.[82]\n\n\n\n### International properties[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen logo evolution (1937\u20132019)\nVolkswagen has factories in many parts of the world, manufacturing or assembling vehicles for local markets. In addition to plants in Germany, Volkswagen has manufacturing or assembly facilities in Mexico, the United States, Slovakia, China, India, Russia (sold to the Russian company Avilon in 2023[83]), Malaysia, Brazil, Argentina, Portugal, Spain, Poland, the Czech Republic, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kenya and South Africa. In 2011, Volkswagen was named in the top 25 largest companies in the world by the Forbes Global 2000.[84][85]\n\n\nAs of May 2014, Volkswagen was planning to start assembling certain engines in India to increase localisation from 70% to 90%.[86]\n\n\nIn January 2016, Volkswagen announced the launch of a new factory in Algeria during a summit between Angela Merkel and Algerian prime minister Abdelmalek Sellal.[87] The factory was launched in Relizane, producing Volkswagen Golf VII, Volkswagen Polo, Volkswagen Caddy, SEAT Ibiza and \u0160koda Octavia cars.\n\n\nIn the 2021 review of WIPOTooltip World Intellectual Property Organization's annual World Intellectual Property Indicators VW ranked 6th in the world for its 84 industrial design registrations that were published under the Hague System during 2020.[88] This position is down on their previous 5th-place ranking for 73 industrial design registrations being published in 2019.[89][*third-party source needed*]\n\n\nSince 1985, Volkswagen has also run the Volkswagen AutoMuseum in Wolfsburg, which is dedicated to the history of the company.[90][*third-party source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Working conditions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Volkswagen worker organizations\n\nWith 120,000 employees in Germany,[91] VW is one of the most well organized labour represented companies in the world and Germany. The role that Works Councils and IG Metall play is unique even within Germany. VW workers have some of the strongest collective agreements. VW has a strong tradition and practice of social partnership and co-determination.[92]\n\n\nVolkswagen agreed in December 2011 to implement a rule passed by the company's Works Council aimed at improving work\u2013life balance and avoiding burnout by restricting company email functionality on the firm's BlackBerry smartphones to working periods and the half-hour before and after working periods. About 1,150 of Volkswagen's more than 190,000 employees in Germany were affected by the email restriction.[93]\n\n\nBecause of Volkswagen's use of IPPD,[94][95] a human contact allergen, in various polymers of their vehicles, they have coined the term \"Volkswagen dermatitis\".[96]\n\n\n\n### Relationship with Porsche and the Volkswagen Law[edit]\n\n\nVolkswagen has always had a close relationship with Porsche, the Zuffenhausen-based sports car manufacturer founded in 1931 by Ferdinand Porsche, the original Volkswagen designer and Volkswagen company co-founder, hired by Adolf Hitler for the project. The first Porsche car, the Porsche 64 of 1938, used many components from the Volkswagen Beetle. The 1948 Porsche 356 continued using many Volkswagen components, including a tuned engine, gearbox and suspension.\n\n\nThe two companies continued their collaboration in 1969 to make the VW-Porsche 914 and Porsche 914-6. (The 914-6 had a 6-cylinder Porsche engine, and the standard 914 had a Volkswagen engine.) Volkswagen and Porsche would collaborate again in 1976 on the Porsche 912-E (the USA only) and the Porsche 924, which used many Audi components and was built at Audi's Neckarsulm facilities. The 924 was originally designated for AUDI. Most Porsche 944 models were built there, although they used far fewer VW components.\n\n\nThe Porsche Cayenne, introduced in 2002, shares its entire chassis with the Volkswagen Touareg and Audi Q7, and is built at the same Volkswagen factory in Bratislava that the other SUVs are built.\n\n\nIn September 2005, Porsche announced it would increase its 5% stake in Volkswagen to 20% at a cost of \u20ac3\u00a0billion, with the intention that the combined stakes of Porsche and the government of Lower Saxony would ensure that any hostile takeover by foreign investors would be impossible.[97] Speculated suitors included DaimlerChrysler, BMW, and Renault. In July 2006, Porsche increased their ownership again to 25.1%.\n\n\nOn 4 March 2005, the European Commission brought an action against the Federal Republic of Germany before the European Court of Justice, claiming that the Volkswagen Law, which prevents any shareholder in Volkswagen from executing more than 20% of the total voting rights in the firm, was illegally restricting the flow of capital in Europe.[98] On 13 February 2007, Advocate General D\u00e1maso Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer submitted an opinion to the court in support of the action.[99] This again opened the possibility of a hostile takeover of VW and so on 26 March of the same year Porsche took its holding of Volkswagen shares to 30.9%. Porsche formally announced in a press statement that it did not intend to take over Volkswagen, but intended the move to avoid a competitor's taking a large stake and to stop hedge funds from dismantling VW.[100] As expected, on 22 October 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled in agreement with Ruiz-Jarabo and the law was struck down.[101][102] In October 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled that the VW law was illegal[103] because it was protectionist. At that time, Porsche held 31% of VW shares\u00a0\u2013 although a smaller proportion of voting rights, due to the Volkswagen Law\u00a0\u2013 and there had been speculation that Porsche would be interested in taking over VW if the law did not stand in its way. The court also prevented the government from appointing Volkswagen board members.[104] The German government then rewrote the Volkswagen law, only to be sued again.[105][106][107] In October 2013, the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled that the rewritten Volkswagen law \"complied in full\" with EU rules.[108]\n\n\nOn 26 October 2008, Porsche revealed its plan to assume control of VW. As of that day, it held 42.6% of Volkswagen's ordinary shares and stock options on another 31.5%. Combined with the state of Lower Saxony's 20.1% stake, this left only 5.8% of shares on the market\u2014mostly with index funds that could not legally sell.[109] Hedge funds desperate to cover their short positions forced Volkswagen stock above one thousand euros per share, briefly making it the world's largest company by market capitalisation on 28 October 2008.[110] By January 2009, Porsche had a 50.76% holding in Volkswagen AG, although the \"Volkswagen Law\" prevented it from taking control of the company.[111]\n\n\nOn 6 May 2009, the two companies decided to join, in a merger.\n\n\nOn 13 August, Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft's supervisory board signed the agreement to create an integrated automotive group with Porsche led by Volkswagen. The initial decision was for Volkswagen to take a 42.0% stake in Porsche AG by the end of 2009, and it would also see the family shareholders selling the automobile trading business of Porsche Holding Salzburg to Volkswagen.[112] In October 2009 however, Volkswagen announced that its percentage in Porsche would be 49.9% for a cost of \u20ac3.9\u00a0billion (the 42.0% deal would have cost \u20ac3.3\u00a0billion).[113] On 1 March 2011, Volkswagen has finalised the purchase of Porsche Holding Salzburg (PHS), Austria's leading specialty automobile distributor, for \u20ac3.3\u00a0billion ($4.55\u00a0billion).[114]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Volkswagen was overtaken by Tesla, Inc. as the second-most valuable auto maker.[115]\n\n\n\n## Product line[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Volkswagen vehicles\n\n\n\n| Best-selling Volkswagen models in 2022[116] |\n| --- |\n| Rank\n | Model\n | Production output\n |\n| 1\n | Tiguan | 604,536\n |\n| 2\n | Polo/Virtus/Vento/Ameo | 448,043\n |\n| 3\n | Passat/Magotan | 447,246\n |\n| 4\n | Lavida | 377,284\n |\n| 5\n | T-Roc | 322,211\n |\n| 6\n | T-Cross/Tacqua/Taigun | 315,036\n |\n| 7\n | Golf | 300,090\n |\n| 8\n | Jetta/Sagitar | 292,038\n |\n| 9\n | Atlas/Teramont | 217,771\n |\n| 10\n | Tharu/Taos | 216,397\n |\n\n\nThe Volkswagen brand produces various models which consists of global products and regional products, specifically for large markets including Europe, China and Latin America. Volkswagen AG annual report in 2022 reported that the best-selling model under the Volkswagen brand globally was the Tiguan, followed by the B-segment range of Polo, Virtus, Nivus and Taigo, and Passat/Magotan.[116]\n\n\n\n### Hatchbacks[edit]\n\n\nVolkswagen has been one of the leading manufacturer in terms of hatchback production, which traditionally has been a popular segment in Europe.[117][118] The brand offered a range of hatchbacks from A-segment, B-segment, and C-segment. The Golf traditionally has been the strongest selling vehicle for the brand in Europe, followed by the smaller Polo which apart from the European market also has a stronghold in emerging markets. Sales for the hatchback category has slowed down due to the rise of the SUV segment.[119][120]\n\n\n\n### SUVs/crossovers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen Tiguan has claimed the top spot in terms of sales figures within Volkswagen models.\nThe brand introduced its first crossover SUV in 2002 starting from the Touareg, a full-size luxury SUV. The brand SUV expansion continues with the release of Tiguan, a C-segment mainstream SUV in 2007. In the mid-2010s, the company decided to produce an SUV in every class of car that can justify one, which the brand called the \"SUV offensive\".[121] Between 2017 and 2020, the brand has aggressively expanded its SUV line-up by growing its number of models from 2 to 8 models, excluding its derivatives, ranging from B-segment, C-segment, and D-segment SUVs which include global models and regional models. Volkswagen also started producing derivatives of its SUV models with a rear sloping roof marketed as coup\u00e9 SUV which had gained popularity in China, the largest single market for the brand.[122][123]\n\n\nIn 2019, every fourth vehicle delivered by the Volkswagen brand today is an SUV, with its top contributor being the Tiguan. The brand plans to have over 30 SUV models on offer worldwide by 2025, contributing 50 per cent of its global sales.[124] Volkswagen also expects SUVs to lead the ID. family, its future electric vehicle range of models.[125]\n\n\nThe SUV expansion has claimed casualties in the MPV segment, which saw the Sharan mid-size MPV being phased out in 2020.[126]\n\n\n\n### Regional models[edit]\n\n\n#### Chinese market[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen Lavida was the best-selling sedan in China.\nVolkswagen is a market leader in China, which is the largest single automotive market in the world. In 2019, 3.16 million Volkswagen-branded vehicles were delivered in the country.[127] The importance of the market has justified a significant amount of China-specific models.\n\n\nSedans are a favoured segment in China due to their spacious interiors and boot space. In 2019, the brand sold 1.6 million of them in China. In the compact notchback or sedan segment, the brand is represented by several China-only models which include the Sagitar, Lamando, Bora, Santana, Lavida, and its derivatives in other body styles,[128] while the mid-size sedan segment is represented by the Passat and Magotan.[129][130] The Lavida was the best-selling model in China of all manufacturers in 2019 with 491,000 units sold.[131]\n\n\nThe popularity of SUVs also gave birth to several SUV models built or reworked specifically for China, including the Tharu, Tayron, Tayron X, Tiguan X, and reworked versions of the T-Cross and T-Roc.[132] The brand also has a strong presence in the premium or luxury segment including the Phideon and Viloran as the models developed specifically for China.[133][134]\n\n\nOn July 26, 2023, Volkswagen announced its investment of $700 million in Chinese EV maker XPeng for purchasing 4.99% stake of the company. The VW will collaborate with XPeng to develop two VW brand electric models for the mid-size segment in the Chinese market in 2026.[135][136]\n\n\n\n#### Brazilian market[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen Kombi was produced in Brazil from 1957 up to 2013.\nThe brand has a notable history in Brazil. Volkswagen's relationship with Brazil dates back to the early 1950s. In 1956, Volkswagen began by building a plant in S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, near S\u00e3o Paulo as its first manufacturing plant outside Germany as a response to the Brazil's ban on the import of completely assembled vehicles in 1950.[137] One year later, the plant started to produce the Kombi model \u2013 370 cars at that time, with a 50 per cent local content component share. Of 81 million vehicles produced over six decades in Brazil, 23 million of it was built by Volkswagen, which was produced by four passenger car factories in the country. In 2018, Volkswagen accounted for close on 15 per cent of the Brazilian car market.[138]\n\n\n\nThe importance of the Brazilian market gave birth to several models developed and manufactured by Volkswagen do Brasil, which include the Fox, Gol, Nivus, Saveiro, Virtus and Voyage. These models are also typically exported throughout Latin America. Historical vehicles built for the market include the Bras\u00edlia, SP1 & SP2, 1500/Variant/Variant II, Karmann Ghia TC, Parati and Suran.[139][140][141] The Gol, first launched in 1980, was the best-selling car in the country for 27 consecutive years, up until 2013.[137][138]\n\n\n### Environment-friendly vehicles[edit]\n\n\n#### Pure ethanol vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)VW pure ethanol prototype car developed by Volkswagen do Brasil in 1978\nVolkswagen do Brasil produced and sold pure ethanol-powered (E100 only) vehicles in Brazil, and production was discontinued only after they were supplanted by more modern Flex Fuel technology. As a response to the 1973 oil crisis, the Brazilian government began promoting bioethanol as a fuel, and the National Alcohol Program -*Pr\u00f3-\u00c1lcool*- (Portuguese: *Programa Nacional do \u00c1lcool*) was launched in 1975.[142][143][144] Compelled by the 1979 energy crisis, and after development and testing with government fleets by the CTA at S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, and further testing of several prototypes developed by the four local carmakers, including Volkswagen do Brasil, pure ethanol vehicles were launched in the Brazilian market.[142][143] Petrol engines were modified to support hydrous ethanol characteristics and changes included compression ratio, amount of fuel injected, replacement of materials that would get corroded by the contact with ethanol, use of colder spark plugs suitable for dissipating heat due to higher flame temperatures, and an auxiliary cold-start system that injects petrol from a small tank in the engine compartment to help starting when cold. Within six years, around 75% of all Brazilian passenger cars were manufactured with ethanol engines.[142][145]\n\n\nProduction and sales of pure ethanol vehicles tumbled beginning in 1987 owing to several factors, including a sharp decline in petrol prices as a result of the 1980s oil glut, and high sugar prices in the world market, shifting sugarcane ethanol production from fuel to sugar. By mid-1989, a shortage of ethanol fuel supply in the local market left thousands of vehicles in line at petrol stations or out of fuel in their garages, forcing consumers to abandon ethanol vehicles.[144][146]\n\n\n\n#### Flexible-fuel vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Gol Total Flex\nThe 2003 VW Gol 1.6 Total Flex was the first full flexible-fuel vehicle launched in Brazil, capable of running on any blend of petrol and E100. In March of that year, on its fiftieth anniversary, Volkswagen do Brasil launched in the local market the Gol 1.6 Total Flex, the first Brazilian commercial flexible fuel vehicle capable of running on any mix of E20-E25 petrol and up to 100% hydrous ethanol fuel (E100).[147][148][149][150] After the pure ethanol fiasco, consumer confidence in ethanol-powered vehicles was restored, allowing a rapid adoption of the flex technology. This was facilitated by the fuel distribution infrastructure already in place throughout Brazil, with more than 30 thousand fueling stations, a heritage of the *Pr\u00f3-\u00c1lcool* program[151]\n\n\nOwing to the success and rapid consumer acceptance of the flex-fuel versions, by 2005 VW had sold 293,523 flex-fuel cars and light-duty trucks, and only 53,074 petrol-only automobiles,[152] jumping to 525,838 flex-fuel vehicles and only 13,572 petrol-only cars and 248 petrol-only light trucks in 2007,[153] and reaching new car sales of 564,959 flex-fuel vehicles in 2008, representing 96% of all new cars and light-duty trucks sold in that year.[154] VW do Brasil stopped manufacturing petrol-only vehicles models for the local market in 2006,[148] and all of the remaining petrol-only Volkswagen models sold in Brazil are imported. The flex-fuel models currently produced for the local market are the Gol, Fox, CrossFox, Parati, Polo Hatch, Polo Sedan, Saveiro, Golf, and Kombi.[155] By March 2009, Volkswagen do Brasil had attained the milestone mark of two million flex-fuel vehicles produced since 2003.[156][157]\n\n\n\n#### Hybrid vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen Jetta Hybrid gets 48\u00a0mpg\u2011US (20.4\u00a0km/L) on highway.\nVolkswagen and Sanyo have teamed up to develop a battery system for hybrid cars.[158] Volkswagen head Martin Winterkorn has confirmed the company plans to build compact hybrid electric vehicles. He has stated \"There will definitely be compact hybrid models, such as Polo and Golf, and without any great delay\", with petrol and diesel power. For example, Golf is the ideal model to go hybrid as the Golf 1.4 TSI was recently awarded the \"Auto Environment Certificate\" by the Oko-Trend Institute for Environmental Research, and was considered one of the most environmentally friendly vehicles of 2007.[159] Also underway at Volkswagen's Braunschweig R&D facilities in Northern Germany is a hybrid version of the next-generation Touareg.[160]\n\n\nVW intends all future models to have the hybrid option. \"Future VW models will fundamentally also be constructed with hybrid concepts,\" VW head of development Ulrich Hackenberg told *Automobilwoche* in an interview. Hackenberg mentioned that the car based on the Up! concept seen at Frankfurt Motor Show,[161] as well as all future models, could be offered with either full or partial hybrid options. The rear-engine up! will go into production in 2011. Nothing has been said about plug-in hybrid options.[162]\n\n\nVolkswagen announced at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show the launch of the 2012 Touareg Hybrid, scheduled for 2011.[163][164] VW also announced plans to introduce diesel-electric hybrid versions of its most popular models in 2012, beginning with the new Jetta, followed by the Golf Hybrid in 2013 together with hybrid versions of the Passat.[165][166] In 2012, the Volkswagen Jetta Hybrid set the world record to become the fastest hybrid car at 187\u00a0mph (301\u00a0km/h).\n\n\n\n#### Plug-in electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2009, Volkswagen announced it has hired Karl-Thomas Neumann as its group chief officer for electric traction.[167] VW's Chief of research, J\u00fcrgen Leohold, said in 2010 the company has concluded hydrogen fuel-cell cars are not a viable option.[168][169]\n\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Golf GTE plug-in hybrid charging\nAs of May\u00a02016[update], the Volkswagen Group offers for retails customers nine plug-in electric cars, of which, three are all-electric cars: the Volkswagen e-Up!, e-Golf and Audi R8 e-tron, and six are plug-in hybrids: the Volkswagen Golf GTE, Passat GTE, Audi A3 Sportback e-tron, Q7 e-tron quattro, Porsche Panamera S E-Hybrid and Cayenne S E-Hybrid.[170] Also two limited production plug-in hybrids were manufactured beginning in 2013, the Volkswagen XL1 (250 units) and the Porsche 918 Spyder (918 units).[171][172] Total cumulative sales of all Volkswagen brand electrified cars since the start of their respective production is expected to reach about 103,000 by the end of 2016.[170] The Volkswagen ID.4 was launched in the U.S. in September 2020.\n\n\nIn order to comply with increasingly strict carbon dioxide emission limits in major markets, the VW Group expects to sell about one million all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles a year worldwide by 2025. The Group plans to expand its plug-in range with 20 new pure electric and plug-in hybrid cars, including two cars to compete with Tesla, Inc., the Porsche Mission E all-electric car and the Audi e-tron quattro, which is expected to become the brand's first mass-production electric vehicle. According to Thomas Ulbrich, VW brand production chief, the carmaker has the capacity to build as many as 75,000 battery-electric and plug-in hybrids a year if demand rises. Volkswagen announced in October 2015 that \"it will develop a modular architecture for battery-electric cars, called the MEB. The standardised system will be designed for all body structures and vehicle types and will allow the company to build emotionally appealing EVs with a range of up to 310\u00a0mi (500\u00a0km).\"[170] In June 2016, VW launched a program to develop 30 all-electric cars in 10 years, and sell 2\u20133\u00a0million electric cars per year by 2025.[173] Due to lower manpower requirements for electric motors than for piston engines, VW expects a gradual workforce reduction as numbers of electric cars increase.[174][175] VW considers battery factory ownership as too expensive.[176]\n\n\n\n### Flying vehicles[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Volkswagen issued a statement that \"vertical mobility\" could be the next step after self-driving technology. It announced that the company is exploring the feasibility of flying vehicles in China.[177]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen up! won the 2012 World Car of the Year.\nVolkswagen was named the fourth most influential car of the 20th century in the 1999 Car of the Century competition, for its Volkswagen Type 1 \"Beetle\" model.

Volkswagen also notched up several victories, and the championship in Formula Three.\n* In July 2011 Wolfgang D\u00fcrheimer told German magazine *Auto, Motor und Sport* that \"if [the VW group] is at the forefront of the auto industry, I can imagine us competing in Formula 1 in 2018. We have enough brands to pull it off.\"[182][183] They did not compete in F1 in 2018.\n\n\n### World Rally Championship[edit]\n\n\n* In 1981, now based in Hanover, VW took a new direction into rallying, with the launch of the first-generation Golf, and Sweden's Per Eklund, Frenchman Jean-Luc Th\u00e9rier, and the Finn Pentti Airikkala.

In 2004, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles entered the European Truck Racing series with the Volkswagen Titan truck\u00a0\u2013 it became a back-to-back champion for the 2004 and 2005 series.\n* United States: In 1976, Volkswagen entered the under-2000-cc Trans-Am Series, with the Scirocco, and they won their class outright.[184] Beginning in 2008 Volkswagen introduced the Jetta TDI Cup. The Jetta TDI Cup is an SCCA sanctioned race series that features 25 drivers between the ages of 16 and 26 driving slightly modified 2009 Jetta TDIs. The series features 10 events at 8 different road courses across North America. There is $50,000 prize money at stake over the course of the series in addition to the $100,000 prize awarded to the champion of the series at the conclusion of the last race.[185]\n* Argentina: Many Volkswagen models have competed in TC 2000, including the 1980 to 1983 champion Volkswagen 1500 and the 1994 champion Volkswagen Gol.\n* In 1999 and 2000, VW won the F2 Australian Rally Championship with the Golf GTI.\n* Finland: In 2002, VW won the Finnish Rally Championship in a7/(F2), with a Golf Mk4 KitCar, with Mikko Hirvonen.

It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903. The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand, and luxury cars under its Lincoln brand. Ford also owns a 32% stake in China's Jiangling Motors.[8] It also has joint ventures in China (Changan Ford), Taiwan (Ford Lio Ho), Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand), and Turkey (Ford Otosan). The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family; they have minority ownership but the majority of the voting power.[6][9]\n\n\nFord introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving assembly lines; by 1914, these methods were known around the world as Fordism. Ford's former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land Rover, acquired in 1989 and 2000, respectively, were sold to the Indian automaker Tata Motors in March 2008. Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010.[10] In 2011, Ford discontinued the Mercury brand, under which it had marketed entry-level luxury cars in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East since 1938.\n\n\nFord is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker (behind General Motors) and the sixth-largest in the world (behind Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Hyundai Motor Group, Stellantis, and General Motors) based on 2022 vehicle production.[11] At the end of 2010, Ford was the fifth-largest automaker in Europe.[12] The company went public in 1956 but the Ford family, through special Class B shares, still retain 40 percent of the voting rights.[6][13] During the financial crisis of 2007\u201308, the company struggled financially but did not have to be rescued by the federal government, unlike the other two major US automakers.[14][15] Ford Motors has since returned to profitability,[16] and was the eleventh-ranked overall American-based company in the 2018 Fortune 500 list, based on global revenues in 2017 of $156.7\u00a0billion.[17] In 2008, Ford produced 5.532\u00a0million automobiles[18] and employed about 213,000 employees at around 90 plants and facilities worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Ford Motor Company\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founder Henry Ford c. 1919\nThe Henry Ford Company was Henry Ford's first attempt at a car manufacturing company and was established on November 3, 1901. This became the Cadillac Motor Company on August 22, 1902, after Ford left with the rights to his name.[19] The Ford Motor Company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with $28,000 (equivalent to $950,000 in 2023) in cash from twelve investors, most notably John and Horace Dodge (who would later found their own car company). The first president was not Ford, but local banker John S. Gray, who was chosen in order to assuage investors' fears that Ford would leave the new company the way he had left its predecessor. During its early years, the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on Mack Avenue and later at its factory on Piquette Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Groups of two or three men worked on each car, assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford. Within a decade the company led the world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept, and Ford soon brought much of the part production in-house (vertical integration).\n\n\nHenry Ford was 39 years old when he founded the Ford Motor Company, which would go on to become one of the world's largest and most profitable companies. It has been in continuous family control for over 100 years and is one of the largest family-controlled companies in the world.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe first gasoline-powered automobile had been created in 1885 by the German inventor Karl Benz (Benz Patent-Motorwagen). More efficient production methods were needed to make automobiles affordable for the middle class, to which Ford contributed by, for instance, introducing the first moving assembly line in 1913 at the Ford factory in Highland Park.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)A 1910 Model T (introduced in 1908), photographed in Salt Lake City\nBetween 1903 and 1908, Ford produced the Models A, B, C, F, K, N, R, and S. Hundreds or a few thousand of most of these were sold per year. In 1908, Ford introduced the mass-produced Model T, which totaled millions sold over nearly 20 years. In 1927, Ford replaced the T with the Model A, the first car with safety glass in the windshield.[20] Ford launched the first low-priced car with a V8 engine in 1932.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn an attempt to compete with General Motors' mid-priced Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick, Ford created the Mercury in 1939 as a higher-priced companion car to Ford. Henry Ford purchased the Lincoln Motor Company in 1922, in order to compete with such brands as Cadillac and Packard for the luxury segment of the automobile market.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1929, Ford was contracted by the government of the Soviet Union to set up the Gorky Automobile Plant in Russia initially producing Ford Model A and AAs thereby playing an important role in the industrialization of that country.[21]\n\n\n\n![](image)B-24 Liberator bombers being mass-produced at Ford's Willow Run assembly plant in 1944\nDuring World War II, the United States Department of War picked Ford to mass-produce the Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber at its Willow Run assembly plant.[22] Ford Werke and Ford SAF (Ford's subsidiaries in Germany and France, respectively) produced military vehicles and other equipment for Nazi Germany's war effort. Some of Ford's operations in Germany at the time were run using forced labor.\n\n\nThe creation of a scientific laboratory in Dearborn, Michigan, in 1951, doing unfettered basic research, led to Ford's unlikely involvement in superconductivity research. In 1964, Ford Research Labs made a key breakthrough with the invention of a superconducting quantum interference device or SQUID.[23]\n\n\nFord offered the Lifeguard safety package from 1956, which included such innovations as a standard deep-dish steering wheel, optional front, and, for the first time in a car, rear seatbelts, and an optional padded dash.[24] Ford introduced child-proof door locks into its products in 1957, and, in the same year, offered the first retractable hardtop on a mass-produced six-seater car.[25]\n\n\nIn late 1955, Ford established the Continental division as a separate luxury car division. This division was responsible for the manufacture and sale of the famous Continental Mark II. At the same time, the Edsel division was created to design and market that car starting with the 1958 model year. Due to limited sales of the Continental and the Edsel disaster, Ford merged Mercury, Edsel, and Lincoln into \"M-E-L,\" which reverted to \"Lincoln-Mercury\" after Edsel's November 1959 demise.[25]\n\n\nThe Ford Mustang was introduced on April 17, 1964, during New York World's Fair (where Ford had a pavilion made by The Walt Disney Company).[26][27] In 1965, Ford introduced the seat belt reminder light.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith the 1980s, Ford introduced several highly successful vehicles around the world. During the 1980s, Ford began using the advertising slogan, \"Have you driven a Ford, lately?\" to introduce new customers to their brand and make their vehicles appear more modern. In 1990 and 1994, respectively, Ford also acquired Jaguar Cars and Aston Martin.[28] During the mid-to-late 1990s, Ford continued to sell large numbers of vehicles, in a booming American economy with a soaring stock market and low fuel prices.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith the dawn of the new century, legacy health care costs, higher fuel prices, and a faltering economy led to falling market shares, declining sales, and diminished profit margins. Most of the corporate profits came from financing consumer automobile loans through Ford Motor Credit Company.[29]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)William Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of Henry Ford, serves as the executive chairman at the board of Ford Motor Company.\nBy 2005, both Ford and GM's corporate bonds had been downgraded to junk status[30] as a result of high U.S. health care costs for an aging workforce, soaring gasoline prices, eroding market share, and an overdependence on declining SUV sales. Profit margins decreased on large vehicles due to increased \"incentives\" (in the form of rebates or low-interest financing) to offset declining demand.[31] In the latter half of 2005, Chairman Bill Ford asked newly appointed Ford Americas Division President Mark Fields to develop a plan to return the company to profitability. Fields previewed the plan, named *The Way Forward*, at the board meeting of the company on December 7, 2005, and it was unveiled to the public on January 23, 2006. \"The Way Forward\" included resizing the company to match market realities, dropping some unprofitable and inefficient models, consolidating production lines, closing 14 factories and cutting 30,000 jobs.[32]\n\n\nFord moved to introduce a range of new vehicles, including \"Crossover SUVs\" built on unibody car platforms, rather than more body-on-frame chassis. In developing the hybrid electric powertrain technologies for the Ford Escape Hybrid SUV, the company licensed similar Toyota hybrid technologies[33] in order to avoid patent infringements.[34] Ford announced that it would team up with electricity supply company Southern California Edison (SCE) to examine the future of plug-in hybrids in terms of how home and vehicle energy systems will work with the electrical grid. Under the multimillion-dollar, multi-year project, Ford is to convert a demonstration fleet of Ford Escape Hybrids into plug-in hybrids, and SCE is to evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid. Some of the vehicles are to be evaluated \"in typical customer settings\", according to Ford.[35][36]\n\n\nWilliam Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of Henry Ford (and better known by his nickname \"Bill\"), was appointed executive chairman in 1998, and also became chief executive officer of the company in 2001, with the departure of Jacques Nasser, becoming the first member of the Ford family to head the company since the retirement of his uncle, Henry Ford II, in 1982. Ford sold motorsport engineering company Cosworth to Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven in 2004, the start of a decrease in Ford's motorsport involvement. Upon the retirement of president and chief operations officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed his roles as well. Five months later, in September, Ford named Alan Mulally as president and CEO, with Ford continuing as executive chairman. In December 2006, the company raised its borrowing capacity to about $25\u00a0billion, placing substantially all corporate assets as collateral.[37] Chairman Bill Ford has stated that \"bankruptcy is not an option\".[38] Ford and the United Auto Workers, representing approximately 46,000 hourly workers in North America, agreed to a historic contract settlement in November 2007 giving the company a substantial break in terms of its ongoing retiree health care costs and other economic issues. The agreement included the establishment of a company-funded, independently run Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust to shift the burden of retiree health care from the company's books, thereby improving its balance sheet. This arrangement took effect on January 1, 2010. As a sign of its currently strong cash position, Ford contributed its entire current liability (estimated at US$5.5\u00a0billion as of December 31, 2009) to the VEBA in cash, and also pre-paid US$500\u00a0million of its future liabilities to the fund. The agreement also gave hourly workers the job security they were seeking by having the company commit to substantial investments in most of its factories.\n\n\n\n![](image)Horton Classic Car Museum, Nocona, Texas.\nThe automaker reported the largest annual loss in company history in 2006 of $12.7\u00a0billion,[39] and estimated that it would not return to profitability until 2009.[40] However, Ford surprised Wall Street in the second quarter of 2007 by posting a $750\u00a0million profit. Despite the gains, the company finished the year with a $2.7\u00a0billion loss, largely attributed to finance restructuring at Volvo.[41]\n\n\nOn June 2, 2008, Ford sold its Jaguar and Land Rover operations to Tata Motors for $2.3\u00a0billion.[42][43]\n\n\nDuring congressional hearings held in November 2008 at Washington D.C., Ford's Alan Mulally stated that \"We at Ford are hopeful that we have enough liquidity. But we also must prepare ourselves for the prospect of further deteriorating economic conditions\". He went on to state that \"The collapse of one of our competitors would have a severe impact on Ford\" and that Ford Motor Company supported both Chrysler and General Motors in their search for government bridge loans in the face of conditions caused by the 2008 financial crisis.[44][45] Together, the three companies presented action plans for the sustainability of the industry. Mulally stated that \"In addition to our plan, we are also here today to request support for the industry. In the near-term, Ford does not require access to a government bridge loan. However, we request a credit line of $9 billion as a critical backstop or safeguard against worsening conditions as we drive transformational change in our company\".[46] GM and Chrysler received government loans and financing through T.A.R.P. legislation funding provisions.[47]\n\n\nOn December 19, the cost of credit default swaps to insure the debt of Ford was 68 percent of the sum insured for five years, in addition to annual payments of 5 percent. That meant $6.8\u00a0million paid upfront to insure $10\u00a0million in debt, in addition to payments of $500,000 per year.[48] In January 2009, Ford reported a $14.6\u00a0billion loss in the preceding year, a record for the company. The company retained sufficient liquidity to fund its operations. Through April 2009, Ford's strategy of debt-for-equity exchanges erased $9.9 billion in liabilities (28% of its total) in order to leverage its cash position.[49] These actions yielded Ford a $2.7\u00a0billion profit in fiscal year 2009, the company's first full-year profit in four years.[50] In 2012, Ford's corporate bonds were upgraded from junk to investment grade again, citing sustainable, lasting improvements.[51]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2012, Ford announced the sale of its climate control components business, its last remaining automotive components operation, to Detroit Thermal Systems LLC for an undisclosed price.[52]\n\n\nOn November 1, 2012, Ford announced that CEO Alan Mulally would stay with the company until 2014. Ford also named Mark Fields, its president of operations in the Americas, as its new chief operating officer[53] Mulally was paid a compensation of over $174 million in his previous seven years at Ford since 2006. The generous amount has been a sore point for some workers of the company.[54]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Ford announced a plan to modernize its Dearborn engineering and headquarters campuses through a ten-year building project. The result would see the number of Ford employees working in these areas doubling, to 24,000. During construction, some 2000 of the employees were relocated out of the campus to a temporary location in a disused section of the local shopping mall.[55] Facilities would also be altered to allow ride-sharing and electric and self-driving vehicles.[56] Estimates of the construction cost were $1.2 billion.[57]\n\n\n\n![](image)The historic, once abandoned Michigan Central Station was purchased by Ford Motor Company in May 2018 and is expected to undergo a significant four-year renovation.\nOn January 3, 2017, Ford CEO Mark Fields announced that in a \"vote of confidence\" because of the pro-business climate being fostered in part by President-elect Donald Trump, Ford had canceled plans to invest $1.6 billion in a new plant in Mexico to manufacture the Ford Focus; instead, the company would invest $700 million in Michigan, which it planned to use to create 700 new jobs. The Focus would now be manufactured in the existing plant in Mexico.[58] Also in 2017, Ford began development of a new mixed-use urban campus in the Corktown neighborhood of Detroit, with its purchase, renovation, and occupation of The Factory at Michigan and Rosa Parks. The new site was expected to have a major focus on the development of autonomous vehicle and electric vehicle technology.[59] Ford later began buying up other parcels of land in Corktown including a very high-profile purchase of Michigan Central Station which is planned to become the hub of their Corktown campus, and the adjacent Roosevelt Warehouse.[60] Ford expects to move 2,500 of its employees, roughly 5 percent of its southeast Michigan workforce, to the campus with space for an additional 2,500 entrepreneurs, technology companies and partners.[61] Bill Ford envisioned the first-floor concourse of the train station to be a public gathering place with retail outlets and restaurants.[62]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Ford Motor Co. acquired majority ownership of Argo AI, a self-driving car startup.[63]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Ford announced cuts to its global workforce amid efforts to address the company's declining share price and to improve profits. The company is targeting $3 billion in cost reduction and a nearly 10% reduction in the salaried workforce in Asia and North America to enhance earnings in 2018.[64][65] Jim Hackett was announced to replace Mark Fields as CEO of Ford Motor. Mr. Hackett most recently oversaw the formation of Ford Smart Mobility, a unit responsible for experimenting with car-sharing programs, self-driving ventures and other programs aimed at helping Ford better compete with Uber, Alphabet Inc. and other tech giants looking to edge in on the auto industry.[66][67]\n\n\nOn April 25, 2018, Ford announced that it would discontinue passenger cars in the North American market in the next four years, except for the Mustang, due to declining demand and profitability.[68] The Focus Active, a crossover SUV based on the newly unveiled fourth-generation Focus, was also intended to be marketed in the United States. Due to the vehicle being manufactured in China, Ford later announced that it would not release the Focus Active in the United States, due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese exports.[69][70]\n\n\nIn March 2020, the Detroit United Auto Workers union announced that after discussion with the leaders of General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the carmakers would partially shut down factories on a \"rotating\" basis to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.[71] On March 24, representatives of Ford announced that production in the US, Canada, and Mexico would not resume on March 30 as originally planned, amid the further coronavirus pandemic spread.[72] In the first quarter of 2020, Ford's sales dropped by 15%, entailing the loss of $2 billion.[73]\n\n\nWith the change in the demand for the sport vehicles, on January 6, 2021, Ford reported a sales fall of 9.8% in the fourth quarter, selling 542,749 vehicles, compared to 601,862 in 2019.[74]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Ford said that it would provide COVID-19 vaccines for its employees, who were to obtain them at the company; at the beginning the vaccination program would be in southeast Michigan, Missouri and Ohio, but it was to be expanded later on to other locations.[75]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Ford announced that it would restructure the company into three separate divisions. Ford Model E is to focus on electric vehicles; Ford Blue is to focus on internal combustion vehicles; and the existing commercial division is to be rebranded as Ford Pro, to focus on vehicle distribution and service.[76][7]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Ford announced it planned layoffs of roughly 3,000 employees and contract workers, confirming earlier reporting. The cuts would mostly affect divisions in the US, Canada, and India, which Jim Farley said would allow the company to prepare for the future of electric, software-heavy vehicles.[77][78]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Ford announced that it was going to cut 3,800 jobs across Europe, with the job cuts mainly focusing on their German and British workforce. Ford will be cutting 2,300 jobs from Germany, 1,300 from the United Kingdom, and an additional 200 jobs in the rest of Europe, according to the head of Ford Germany, Martin Sander. The cuts will mainly be done to the company's engineers.[79]\n\n\nFord announced that their electric vehicle business had lost $3 billion before taxes over the past two years and will lose a similar amount in 2023 as the company looks to significantly invest in Electric Technology. The Ford Model E is expected to be profitable by 2026.[80]\n\n\nIn April 2023, United Kingdom ministers approved Ford's BlueCruise technology. Because of this assisted driving technology, Ford drivers can now legally take their hands off the wheel on certain roads. Its top speed is 129\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph). BlueCruise uses sensors and cameras to regulate the car's speed and to keep track of speed limits and road signs. It also monitors and keeps a safe distance from other vehicles. It also comes equipped with an eye-tracking system. If the driver stops looking at the road then the car will gradually reduce its speed. This technology will initially be offered in Ford's 2023 model of the electric Mustang Mach-E SUV. \nAccording to Thatcham Research, an automotive research company, this model is not a self-driving car. It is classified as a level 2 or partial automation assistance system. This means that technology controls two or more driving aspects but still requires human driver control in cases of emergencies. The driver is still legally responsible for accidents.[81]\n\n\n\n### Logo evolution[edit]\n\n\n* ![1903](image)\n\n1903\n* ![1907](image)\n\n1907\n* ![1909](image)\n\n1909\n* ![1911](image)\n\n1911\n* ![1912](image)\n\n1912\n* ![1912 variant](image)\n\n1912 variant\n* ![1927](image)\n\n1927\n* ![1957](image)\n\n1957\n* ![1976](image)\n\n1976\n* ![2003](image)\n\n2003\n* ![2017](image)\n\n2017\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n### Executive management[edit]\n\n\nMembers of the Ford board as of March\u00a02023[update] are: William Clay Ford Jr. (executive chairman), Jim Farley (president and CEO), Kimberly Casiano, Alexandra Ford English (daughter of William Clay Ford Jr.), Henry Ford III (son of Edsel Ford II), William W. Helman IV, Jon Huntsman Jr., William E. Kennard, John C. May, Beth E. Mooney, John L. Thornton, John Veihmeyer, Lynn Vojvodich Radakovich, and John S. Weinberg.[82]\n\n\nJim Farley succeeded Jim Hackett as the chief executive officer of the company in August, 2020; he previously served as Ford's chief operating officer. Hackett stayed in the company as an advisor until the second quarter of 2021.[83]\n\n\n\n## Ford Motor Company Fund[edit]\n\n\nThe Ford Motor Company Fund (also known as Ford Fund, not affiliated with the Ford Foundation), based in Dearborn, Michigan, is the philanthropic arm of the Ford Motor Company.[84] Established in 1949[85] by Henry Ford II,[*citation needed*] Ford Fund is a nonprofit corporate foundation[86] financed by contributions from Ford Motor Company. In 2017, Ford Fund contributed $63 million[87] to various causes[84] with a focus on education, driving safely and community building.\n\n\nThe Ford Driving Skills for Life program is a driver safety program aimed at teens that were developed together with the Governors Highway Safety Association and safety experts.[88] The Ford Volunteer Corps allows Ford employees and retirees to sign up for volunteering work on local projects in more than 40 countries.[89] The Ford Fund invests $18 million annually in education in the United States and around the world, but accepts applications only from nonprofit organizations registered in the U.S.[90] Education programs and scholarships include Alan Mulally Engineering Scholarship, Ford Blue Oval Scholars Program, Ford College Community Challenge (Ford C3), Ford Driving Dreams Tour, Ford Fund/Detroit Free Press Journalism Scholarship, Ford Next Generation Learning (Ford NGL), Grants to Individuals Program, HBCU Community Challenge, Smithsonian Latino Center Young Ambassadors Program, and William Clay Ford Automotive Design Scholarship.\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nFord has had manufacturing operations worldwide, including in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, and South Africa. Ford also helped the Soviet Union to construct Russian automaker GAZ.\n\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford dealer in Garden City, New York, c. 1930\u20131945\nIn May 2010, Ford reported that its sales increased 23% for the month, and that 37% of its sales came from fleet sales.[91] In June 2010, sales to individual customers at dealerships increased 13% while fleet sales rose by 32%.[92] In the first seven months of 2010, fleet sales of Ford for the same period rose 35% to 386,000 units while retail sales increase 19%.[93] Fleet sales account for 39 percent of Chrysler's sales and 31 percent for GM's.[93]\n\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford of Europe\n\n![](image)The Ford Research Center in Aachen, Germany, photographed in 2006\nAt first, Ford in Germany and Ford in Britain built different models from one another until 1965, when the Ford Transit and later the Ford Escort and the Ford Capri became common to both companies. In 1970, the Ford Taunus and the Ford Cortina came into production with a common base construction, both models being produced in left hand drive and right hand drive. Later on, the models became identical and the respective models right- and left-hand-drive exclusively. Rationalisation of model ranges meant that production of many models in the UK switched to elsewhere in Europe, including Belgium and Spain as well as Germany. The Ford Sierra replaced the Taunus and Cortina in 1982, drawing criticism for its radical aerodynamic styling, which was soon given nicknames, the \"Jellymould\" and \"The Salesman's Spaceship.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)Ford's Dunton Technical Centre in Laindon, United Kingdom, the largest automotive research and development facility in the country,[94] pictured in 2006\nIn February 2002, Ford ended car production in the UK. It was the first time in 90 years that Ford cars had not been made in Britain, although production of the Transit van continued at the company's Southampton facility until mid-2013, engines at Bridgend and Dagenham, and transmissions at Halewood. Development of European Ford is broadly split between Dunton in Essex (powertrain, Fiesta/Ka, and commercial vehicles) and Cologne (body, chassis, electrical, Focus, Mondeo) in Germany. Ford also produced the Thames range of commercial vehicles, although the use of this brand name was discontinued with the introduction of the Ford Transit in 1965. Elsewhere in continental Europe, Ford assembles the Mondeo, Galaxy, S-Max[95] and Kuga[96] in Valencia (Spain), Fiesta in Cologne (Germany), Focus in Saarlouis (Germany), Ecosport[97] and Puma[98] in Craiova (Romania).\n\n\nFord also owns a joint-venture production plant in Turkey. Ford Otosan, established in the 1970s, manufactures the Transit Connect compact panel van as well as the \"Jumbo\" and long-wheelbase versions of the full-size Transit. This new production facility was set up near Kocaeli in 2002, and its opening marked the end of Transit assembly in Genk.\n\n\nAnother joint venture plant near Set\u00fabal in Portugal, set up in collaboration with Volkswagen, formerly assembled the Galaxy people-carrier as well as its sister ships, the VW Sharan and SEAT Alhambra. With the introduction of the third generation of the Galaxy, Ford has moved the production of the people-carrier to the Genk plant, with Volkswagen taking over sole ownership of the Set\u00fabal facility.\n\n\nIn 2008, Ford acquired a majority stake in Automobile Craiova, Romania. Starting 2009, the Ford Transit Connect was Ford's first model produced in Craiova, followed, in 2012, by low-capacity car engines and a new small class car, the B-Max.[99]\n\n\nIts 1959 Anglia two-door saloon was one of the most quirky-looking small family cars in Europe at the time of its launch, but buyers soon became accustomed to its looks and it was hugely popular with British buyers in particular. It was still selling well when replaced by the more practical Escort in 1967.\n\n\nThe third incarnation of the Ford Escort was launched in 1980 and marked the company's move from rear-wheel-drive saloons to front-wheel-drive hatchbacks in the small family car sector.\n\n\nThe fourth-generation Escort was produced from 1990 until 2000, although its successor\u2014the Focus\u2014had been on sale since 1998. On its launch, the Focus was arguably the most dramatic-looking and fine-handling small family cars on sale and sold in huge volumes right up to the launch of the next-generation Focus at the end of 2004.\n\n\nThe 1982 Ford Sierra\u2014replacement for the long-running and massively popular Cortina and Taunus models\u2014was a style-setter at the time of its launch. Its ultramodern aerodynamic design was a world away from a boxy, sharp-edged Cortina, and it was massively popular just about everywhere it was sold. A series of updates kept it looking relatively fresh until it was replaced by the front-wheel-drive Mondeo at the start of 1993.\n\n\nThe rise in popularity of small cars during the 1970s saw Ford enter the mini-car market in 1976 with its Fiesta hatchback. Most of its production was concentrated at Valencia in Spain, and the Fiesta sold in huge figures from the very start. An update in 1983 and the launch of an all-new model in 1989 strengthened its position in the small car market.\n\n\nOn October 24, 2012, Ford announced that it would close its Genk assembly plant in eastern Belgium by the end of 2014.[100]\n\n\nIn 2015, Ford announced that it took control of Ford Sollers, Ford's joint venture with Russian company Sollers.[101][102]\n\n\nIn September 2018, at the IAA Commercial Vehicles show in Hannover, Germany, Ford introduced an electric tractor-trailer concept vehicle dubbed the F-Vision, which would have Level 4 autonomous driving capability.[103]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2022, Ford announced that it was suspending its Sollers joint venture operation in Russia, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[104][105] On October 26, 2022, Ford sold its 49 percent share in the joint venture, and exited the Russian market,[106] adding that it retains the option to buy them back within a 5-year period \u201cshould the global situation change.[107]\n\n\n\n### East and Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\nFord formed its first passenger-vehicle joint venture in China in 2001, six years behind GM and more than a decade after VW. It has spent as of 2013[update] $4.9 billion to expand its lineup and double production capacity in China to 600,000 vehicles. This includes Ford's largest-ever factory complex in the southwestern city of Chongqing. Ford had 2.5% of the Chinese market in 2013, while VW controlled 14.5% and GM had 15.6%, according to consultant LMC Automotive. GM outsells Ford in China by more than six-to-one.[108] Ford's presence in Asia has traditionally been much smaller, confined to Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Taiwan, where Ford has had a joint venture with Lio Ho since the 1970s. Ford began assembly of cars in Thailand in 1960, but withdrew from the country in 1976, and did not return until 1995 when it formed a joint venture with Mazda called Auto Alliance.[109] Now based in the Bo-win Sub District of the Sriracha District in Chonburi, the factory still produces passenger automobiles. The factory, built in 1941 in Singapore, was soon taken over by the Japanese during the war and was the site of a surrender of the British to the Japanese, at the factory site which is now a national monument in Singapore.\nOn April 30, 2013, Ford Motor Co. launched their car and truck line in Myanmar. Previously, heavy importation taxes had stifled imported car purchases in Myanmar, but due to currency reform, lifting of previous import restrictions, and the abolishment of shadow currency, Myanmar's car market had grown in demand.[110]\n\n\n\n#### South Korea[edit]\n\n\nIn 1967, Ford partnered with the South Korean company Hyundai, and at the new factory in Ulsan, South Korea, built the European Ford Cortina until 1974 when Hyundai introduced their all-new Hyundai Pony in 1975. Ford then developed a relationship with Korea's oldest car manufacturer Kia which built vehicles co-engineered with Mazda, later selling the Ford Festiva from 1988 to 1993, and the Ford Aspire from 1994 to 1997 for export to the United States. With the acquisition of a stake in Japanese manufacturer Mazda in 1979, Ford began selling Mazda's Familia and Capella as the Ford Laser and Telstar throughout the region, replacing the European-sourced Escort and Cortina. From 1989 to 1996, Kia imported the Mercury Sable from Ford in the U.S. and sold them in South Korea as the Kia Sable. Though the Sable was branded and marketed as a Kia, it retained the Mercury badges and emblem. Ford lost their Kia interest to Hyundai in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. Kia had declared bankruptcy in 1997; in 1998, Hyundai Motor Company acquired 51% of the company, outbidding Ford which had owned an interest in Kia Motors since 1986.[111] After subsequent divestments,[112] Hyundai Motor Company owns less than 50% of the company but remains Kia's largest stakeholder.\n\n\nAs of 2020[update], Ford sells the Explorer, Mondeo, and Mustang,[113] as well as the Lincoln Aviator, Continental, Corsair, MKZ, and Nautilus in South Korea.[114]\n\n\n\n### South and West Asia[edit]\n\n\nFord India began production in 1998 at Chennai, Tamil Nadu, with its Ford Escort model, which was later replaced by the locally produced Ford Ikon in 2001. It has since added the Fusion, Fiesta, Mondeo and Endeavour models to its product line.\n\n\nOn March 9, 2010, Ford launched its first made-for-India compact car. Starting at \u20b9349,900, the Figo was Ford's first car designed and priced for the mass Indian market.[115] On July 28, 2011, Ford India signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the State of Gujarat for the construction of an assembly and engine plant in Sanand and planned to invest approximately US$1 billion on a 460-acre site.[116] In 2019, the company and Mahindra & Mahindra formed a joint venture to develop, market and distribute Ford-branded vehicles in India.[117] In September 2021 Ford India announced plans to shut down both its assembly plants. The company said that it intends to maintain its parts and service network.[118]\n\n\nFord's market presence in the Middle East has traditionally been small, partly due to previous Arab boycotts of companies dealing with Israel. Ford and Lincoln vehicles are currently marketed in ten countries in the region.[119] Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates are the biggest markets. Ford also established itself in Egypt in 1926 but faced an uphill battle during the 1950s due to the hostile nationalist business environment.[120] Ford's distributor in Saudi Arabia announced in February 2003 that it had sold 100,000 Ford and Lincoln vehicles since commencing sales in November 1986. Half of the Ford and Lincoln vehicles sold in that country were Ford Crown Victorias.[121] In 2004, Ford sold 30,000 units in the region, falling far short of General Motors' 88,852 units and Nissan Motors' 75,000 units.\n\n\n\n### South America[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford assembly plant in General Pacheco, Argentina, as seen in the 1960s\nIn South America, Ford's primary operations are in Brazil, Argentina, and Ford Andina[122] (Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela). Ford employs over 18,000 people and operates seven assembly or other plants in the region.[123] In 1987, Ford Brasil and Ford Motor Argentina merged their operations with the Brazilian and Argentine operations of Volkswagen Group, forming a new joint-venture company called Autolatina with a shared model range.[124] Autolatina was dissolved in 1995.[124]\n\n\nIn early 2021, Ford's Brazil branch announced it would completely cease production in the country over the course of a few months.[125]\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\nIn Africa, Ford's market presence has traditionally been strongest in South Africa and neighbouring countries, with only trucks being sold elsewhere on the continent. Ford in South Africa began by importing kits from Canada to be assembled at its facility in Port Elizabeth; the company later sourced its models from the UK and Australia, with local versions of the Ford Cortina including the XR6, with a 3.0 V6 engine, and a Cortina-based 'bakkie' or pick-up, which was exported to the UK. In the mid-1980s Ford merged with a rival company, owned by Anglo American, to form the South African Motor Corporation (Samcor).[126]\n\n\nFollowing international condemnation of apartheid, Ford divested from South Africa in 1988, and sold its stake in Samcor, although it licensed the use of its brand name to the company.[127] Samcor began to assemble Mazdas as well, which affected its product line-up and saw the European Fords like the Escort and Sierra replaced by the Mazda-based Laser[128] and Telstar.[129] Ford bought a 45 per cent stake in Samcor following the demise of apartheid in 1994, and this later became, once again, a wholly owned subsidiary, the Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa. Ford now sells a local sedan version of the Fiesta (also built in India and Mexico), and the Focus. The Falcon model from Australia was also sold in South Africa, but was dropped in 2003; the Mondeo, after briefly being assembled locally, was dropped in 2005. The Mondeo was later reintroduced in 2015, badged as the Fusion, but was dropped in 2017.[130]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nFord Research and Innovation Center is the name of the technology research facilities of Ford Motor Company in\n\n\n\n* Dearborn, Michigan\n* Palo Alto, California\n* Aachen, Germany\n* Nanjing, China\n\n\nThe Ford Research and Innovation Center in Palo Alto was first opened in 2012, and in January 2015, announced plans to significantly expand its operations.[131][132][133][134]\n\n\n\n## Former operations[edit]\n\n\n### East and Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\nFord decided to shut down their entire operations in Indonesia, including their dealer network by second half of 2016.[135][136]\n\n\n\n#### Ford of Japan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford Motor Company of Japan\n\nFord established a manufacturing facility in the port city of Yokohama in February 1925, where Model T vehicles were assembled using imported knock-down kits.[137] The factory subsequently produced 10,000 Model A's up to 1936. Production ceased in 1940 as a result of political tensions between Japan and the United States.\n\n\nAfter World War II, Ford did not have a presence in Japan, as the Ford facility was appropriated by the Japanese Government until 1958 when property was returned as a possession of the Ford Motor Company and became a research and development location for Ford partner Mazda. In 1979, Ford acquired a 24.5% ownership stake in Mazda, and in 1982, Ford and Mazda jointly established a sales channel to sell Ford products in Japan, including vehicles manufactured in North America, at a dealership called *Autorama (Japanese)*. The Autorama sales channel was renamed Ford Sales of Japan in 1997.[138]\n\n\nVehicles sold at *Autorama* locations were the North American assembled Ford Explorer, Probe (1989\u20131998), Mustang, Taurus (1989\u20131997), Thunderbird (1990\u20131993), Lincoln Continental, and Lincoln LS. Ford products manufactured in Europe that were sold in Japan were the Ford Mondeo, Ka, Focus, Focus C-MAX, Fiesta, and the Galaxy. Mazda manufactured Ford vehicles in Japan and sold them as Fords at the Autorama locations. They were the Ford Telstar (Mazda Capella), Laser, Festiva, Festiva Mini Wagon, Ixion (Mazda Premacy), Freda (Mazda Bongo Friendee), Spectron (Mazda Bongo), and commercial trucks J80 and the J100 (Mazda Bongo truck).\n\n\nFord increased its shareholding in Mazda to 33.4% in 1996, but as of July\u00a02016[update], it is listed at 11%.[139] Ford did sell a small range of vehicles in Japan; as of October\u00a02010[update], the Ford Mustang, Escape, Explorer (and Explorer truck), Ford Kuga, Lincoln Navigator, Lincoln MKX, and more recently, the Ford Ecosport were available in Japan. As of February\u00a02016[update], Ford no longer maintains a regional office in Minato, Tokyo, Japan, and sales of new cars in Japan have ended.[140][141]\n\n\n\n### Oceania[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford FG X Falcon (Australia) (2014\u20132016; 2014 model shown)\n![](image)The Ford stamping plant in Geelong, Victoria, Australia. It closed in 2016.\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the popular Ford Falcon (1960\u20132016) had long been considered the average family car and is considerably larger than the Mondeo, Ford's largest car sold in Europe. Between 1960 and 1972, the Falcon was based on a U.S. model of the same name, but since then has been entirely designed and manufactured in Australia until 2016, occasionally being manufactured in New Zealand. Like its General Motors rival, the Holden Commodore, the Falcon used a rear-wheel-drive layout. High-performance variants of the Falcon running locally built engines produce up to 362\u00a0hp (270\u00a0kW). A ute (short for \"utility\", known in the U.S. as pickup truck) version is also available with the same range of drivetrains. In addition, Ford Australia sold highly tuned limited-production Falcon sedans and utes through its performance car division, Ford Performance Vehicles until it closed in 2014.\n\n\nIn Australia, the Commodore and Falcon had traditionally outsold all other cars and constituted over 20% of the new car market. In New Zealand, Ford was second in market share in the first eight months of 2006 with 14.4%.[142] More recently, Ford has axed its Falcon-based LWB variant of its lineup\u2013 the Fairlane and LTD ranges. Ford discontinued the Fairlane in 2007 and LTD in 2008. Ford had announced that their Geelong engine manufacturing plant would be shut down between 2013 and 2016. They had earlier announced local manufacturing of the Focus small car starting from 2011, but instead decided to import the model from Ford's plant in Thailand.[143]\n\n\nIn Australia, the Laser was one of Ford Australia's most successful models and was manufactured in Ford's Homebush West plant from 1981 until the plant's closure in September 1994. It outsold the Mazda 323, despite being almost identical to it because the Laser was manufactured in Australia and Ford was perceived as a local brand.[144] According to research carried out by Ford Australia in 1984, a third of Laser buyers were unaware that the Ford model was based on the Mazda 323.[145]\n\n\nIn New Zealand, the Ford Laser and Telstar were assembled alongside the Mazda 323 and 626 until 1997, at the Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ) plant in Wiri, Auckland.[146] The Sierra wagon was also assembled in New Zealand, owing to the popularity of station wagons in that market.[147]\n\n\nThe scheduled closure of Ford's Australian manufacturing base in 2016 was confirmed on May 23, 2013. Headquartered in the Victorian suburb of Broadmeadows, the company had registered losses worth AU$600 million over the five years prior to the announcement. It was noted that the corporate fleet and government sales that account for two-thirds of large, local car sales in Australia are insufficient to keep Ford's products profitable and viable in Australia. The decision will affect 1200 Ford workers\u2014over 600 employees in Geelong and more than 500 in Broadmeadows\u2014who will lose their jobs by October 2016. The closure of Ford's plants in Norlane Geelong and Broadmeadows Melbourne occurred on October 7, 2016.[148]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\n### Automobiles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Ford vehicles, List of Lincoln vehicles, and List of Mercury vehicles\n\n![](image)The 2017 model year F-150\nFord Motor Company sells a broad range of automobiles under the Ford marque worldwide, and an additional range of luxury automobiles under the Lincoln marque in the United States. The company has sold vehicles under a number of other marques during its history. The Mercury brand was introduced by Ford in 1939, continuing in production until 2011 when poor sales led to its discontinuation.[149] In 1958, Ford introduced the Edsel brand, but poor sales led to its discontinuation in 1960. In 1985, the Merkur brand was introduced in the United States to market products produced by Ford of Europe; it was discontinued in 1989.\n\n\nFord acquired the British sports car maker Aston Martin in 1989, later selling it on March 12, 2007,[150] although retaining an 8% stake.[151][152] Ford purchased Volvo Cars of Sweden in 1999,[153] selling it to Zhejiang Geely Holding Group in 2010.\n\n\nIn November 2008, it reduced its 33.4% controlling interest in Mazda of Japan to a 13.4% non-controlling interest.[154] On November 18, 2010, Ford reduced their stake further to just 3%, citing the reduction of ownership would allow greater flexibility to pursue growth in emerging markets. Ford and Mazda remain strategic partners through exchanges of technological information and joint ventures, including an American joint venture plant in Flat Rock, Michigan called Auto Alliance.[155] In 2015, Ford sold its remaining 3% stake in Mazda.[156]\n\n\nFord sold the United Kingdom-based Jaguar and Land Rover companies and brands to Tata Motors of India in March 2008.\n\n\nOn April 25, 2018, Ford announced that it planned to phase out all but one of its North American automobile models (the Mustang will be the sole surviving model) to focus primarily on trucks and SUVs. Ford had also planned to introduce an \"Active\" crossover version of the next-generation Focus, but canceled those plans due to tariff issues between the United States and China.[157]\n\n\n\n### Trucks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An advertisement for the 1939 Ford V-8 pick-up truck\n![](image)An advertisement for the 1961 Ford H-Series truck\nFord has produced trucks since 1908, beginning with the Ford Model TT, followed by the Model AA, and the Model BB. Countries where Ford commercial vehicles are or were formerly produced include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada (also badged as Mercury), France, Germany, India, Netherlands, Philippines, Spain (badged Ebro too), Turkey, UK (badged also Fordson and Thames), and the United States.\n\n\nFrom the 1940s to the late 1970s, Ford's Ford F-Series was used as the base for light trucks for the North American market.\n\n\nMost of these ventures are now extinct. The European one that lasted longest was the lorries arm of Ford of Britain, which became part of the Iveco group in 1986. Ford had a minority share in the new company and Iveco took over sales and production of the Ford Cargo range.[158] Ford's last significant European truck models were the Transcontinental and the Cargo. At the end of 1996, Ford sold the rights to its heavy trucks division to the Freightliner Trucks division of Daimler AG, with Ford producing the Cargo, Louisville, and Aeromax, through the 1998 model year. During the 1998 model year, Freightliner began production of its own versions of Ford-developed trucks in St. Thomas, Ontario, launching the Sterling truck brand.[159][160] Slotted between Freightliner and Western Star, Sterling trucks were produced through 2009.\n\n\nLine of heavy trucks made by Ford for the North American market:\n\n\n\n* Ford F-Series\n\t+ \"Big Job\" (1951-1957)\n\t+ \"Super Duty/Extra Heavy Duty (1958-1962)\n* Ford N-Series (1963-1969)\n* Ford L-Series trucks (1970-1998)\n\t+ aka Ford \"Louisville Line\"\n\t+ Ford Aeromax (1988-1998)\n\t+ Ford Louisville (1996-1998)\n\t+ Sterling (1998-2009)\n* Ford C-Series (1957-1990)\n* Ford Cargo/CF-Series (1986-1997)\n* Ford H-Series (1961-1966)\n\t+ aka \"Two-story Falcon\"\n* Ford W-Series (1966-1977)\n* Ford CL-Series (1978-1995)\n\n\nFor 1999, Ford briefly withdrew from production of medium-duty trucks. For the 2001 model year, the company entered into a joint venture with Navistar International (the supplier of diesel engines for 1-ton F-Series trucks), named *Blue Diamond Truck Company LLC*.[161] As part of the joint venture, sharing a common truck chassis, the two companies would produce medium-duty (Class 6\u20137) trucks in a Navistar facility in Mexico, with each manufacturer supplying its own powertrain and bodywork, with the Ford F-650/F-750 Super Duty and International 4000/DuraStar sharing an assembly line. In 2006, the joint venture debuted the Ford LCF/International CityStar.[162] Using a modified F-Series chassis adopted to fit a Mazda Titan cab, the LCF was a low-cab forward truck that was sold through 2009.[163]\n\n\nIn Europe, Ford manufactures the Ford Transit jumbo van, which is classed as a Large Goods Vehicle and has a payload of up to 2,265\u00a0kg; there are options of a panel van, pickup or chassis cab. The Ford Transit is also available as a light van called the Ford Transit Connect and the Ford Ranger pickup is available.[164]\n\n\n\n### Buses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Ford B700 bus chassis, with a body by Thomas Built\nFord manufactured complete buses in the company's early history, but today the role of the company has changed to that of a second stage manufacturer. In North America, the E-Series is still used as a chassis for small school buses and the F-650 is used in commercial bus markets. In the 1980s and 1990s, the medium-duty B700 was a popular chassis used by school bus body manufacturers including Thomas Built, Ward, and Blue Bird, but Ford lost its market share due to industry contraction and agreements between body manufacturers. Older bus models included:\n\n\nPrior to 1936, Ford buses were based on truck bodies:\n\n\n\n* Model B \u2013 1930s\n* Model T \u2013 1920s\n* F-105 school bus\n\n\n![](image)A 1937 Ford Transit Bus in Seattle\nIn 1936, Ford introduced the Ford Transit Bus, a series of small transit buses with bodies built by a second party. Originally a front-engine design, it was modified to a rear-engine design in 1939. About 1,000 to 1,200 of the original design were built, and around 12,500 of the rear-engine design, which was in production until 1947[165] (rebranded as the Universal Bus in 1946).\n\n\nRear-engine Transit Bus chassis model numbers:[166]\n\n\n\n* 09-B/19-B City transit bus \u2013 1939\u20131941\n* 19-B/29-B City transit bus \u2013 1941\u20131942\n* 49-B/79-B City transit bus \u2013 1944\u20131947\n* 69-B City transit bus \u2013 1946\u20131947\n* 29-B City transit bus \u2013 1946\u20131947\n* 72-T transit bus \u2013 1944\u20131945\n\n\nAfter 1946 the Transit City bus was sold as the *Universal Bus* with the roof changed from fabric/wood to all-metal:\n\n\n\n* 79-B Universal transit bus \u2013 1946\u20131947\n\n\nSucceeding the Ford Transit Bus was the Ford 8M buses:\n\n\n\n* 8MB transit bus \u2013 with Wayne Works 1948\u2013?\n\n\nFollowing World War II and from the 1950s onwards, Ford lost out to General Motors.[166] This led to the end of transit buses for Ford in North America.\n\n\n\n* B500 or B-series \u2013 1950\u20131990s based on Ford F-series truck chassis used by school bus body manufacturers\n\n\nIn Europe, Ford manufactures the Ford Transit Minibus which is classed in Europe as a Passenger Carrying Vehicle and there are options of 12-, 15-, or 17-seaters.[167] In the past, European models included:\n\n\n\n* EM\n* N-138\n* D series buses (Australia)\n\n\n### Tractors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Ford N series tractor\nThe \"Henry Ford and Son Company\" began making Fordson tractors in Henry's hometown of Springwells (later part of Dearborn), Michigan, from 1907 to 1928, from 1919 to 1932, at Cork, Ireland, and between 1933 and 1964 at Dagenham, England, later transferred to Basildon. They were also produced in Leningrad beginning in 1924.\n\n\nFord reentered the tractor market in 1939 with the Ford N-series tractors. The Ford 8N, introduced in 1947, became the most popular tractor of all time in North America. Production of the N line of models ended in 1952.\n\n\nThe Ford NAA tractor was introduced as an entirely new model in 1953. It was a replacement for the Ford N-Series tractors. Larger than the 8N, with a four-cylinder engine, and streamlined styling.\n\n\nIn 1986, Ford expanded its tractor business when it purchased the Sperry-New Holland skid-steer loader and hay baler, hay tools and implement company from Sperry Corporation and formed Ford-New Holland which bought out Versatile tractors in 1988. This company was bought by Fiat in 1993 and the name changed from Ford New Holland to New Holland. New Holland is now part of CNH Global.\n\n\n\n### Financial services[edit]\n\n\nFord offers automotive finance through Ford Motor Credit Company.\n\n\n\n### Automotive components[edit]\n\n\nFord's *FoMoCo* parts division sells aftermarket parts under the Motorcraft brand name. It has spun off its parts division under the name Visteon.\n\n\n\n## FordWorks Program[edit]\n\n\nFord Motor Company created the FordWorks program in 2016[168][169] with the aim to bring people with disabilities back into the workforce.[170] It was the first automotive program to focus on bringing people with autism in the workforce in the US. They targeted people with autism[168][169] but have expanded their criteria to people with other disabilities.[170] Ford has partnered with Upbound to broaden their hiring under the FordWorks program.[170]\n\n\n\n## Marques[edit]\n\n\n### Current marques[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Marque\n | Estab.\n | Added | Markets\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Ford | 1903 | 1903 | Global\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Lincoln | 1917 | 1922 | North America, Middle East, China, South Korea\n |\n\n\n### Former marques[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Marque\n | Years | Markets\n | Fate\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Continental[171][172] | 1956\u20131986 | North America | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Edsel | 1957\u20131960 | North America | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Fordson | 1917\u20131964 | North America, Ireland, U.K. | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Mercury | 1939\u20132011 | North America, Middle East | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Merkur | 1985\u20131989 | North America | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0AUS | FPV | 2002\u20132014 | Australia | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0BRA | Troller | 2007\u20132021 | Brazil | Defunct company, plant closed by Ford Brasil |\n| ![](image)\u00a0JPN | Mazda | 1974\u20132015 | Global | Sold shares\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0SWE | Volvo | 1999\u20132010 | Global | Sold to Geely |\n| ![](image)\u00a0UK | Aston Martin | 1989\u20132007 | Global | Sold to a private consortium\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0UK | Jaguar | 1989\u20132008 | Global | Sold to Tata Motors |\n| ![](image)\u00a0UK | Land Rover | 2000\u20132008 | Global | Sold to Tata Motors |\n| ![](image)\u00a0ITA | De Tomaso | 1971\u20131974 | Global | Sold to Alejandro de Tomaso |\n| ![](image)\u00a0ITA | Moto Guzzi | 1973\u20131974 | Global | Sold to Alejandro de Tomaso |\n| ![](image)\u00a0ITA | Benelli | 1972\u20131974 | Global | Sold to Alejandro de Tomaso |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Meteor | 1949\u20131976 | Canada | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Monarch | 1946\u20131961 | Canada | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Frontenac | 1960 | Canada | Discontinued\n |\n\n\n## Motorsport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford Performance\n\n### FIA World Championships[edit]\n\n\nAlong with Shelby and Chevrolet, Ford is one of only three American constructors to win titles on the international scene at the FIA World Championships. As a constructor, Ford won the World Sportscar Championship three times in 1966 (both sports prototype category and Grand Touring (GT) category), 1967 (GT category), and 1968 (sports prototype category), and at the World Rally Championship Ford won 4 World Drivers' Championships (in 1979, 1981, 2017 and 2018) as well as 4 World Manufacturers' Championships (in 1979, 2006, 2007 and 2017). As an engine supplier, Ford also won 13 Formula One World Drivers' Championships and 10 Formula One World Constructors' Championships.\n\n\n\n### Open-wheel racing[edit]\n\n\n#### IndyCar[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Arie Luyendyk's record-setting Ford Cosworth-powered IndyCar from 1996\nIndyCars with Ford engines first competed in 1935 using a production-based Ford V8 in the Miller-Ford racer.[173][174] A pushrod Ford V8 raced with Lotus in 1963, and Ford's first Indy win was in 1965 with a DOHC V8.[175][176] Ford motors, including the Ford-sponsored DFX engine developed by Cosworth, have won the Indianapolis 500 eighteen times.[177] On May 12, 1996, Arie Luyendyk, while driving an IndyCar powered by a Ford Cosworth XB engine, broke the Indianapolis 500 records for fastest qualification lap (237.498\u00a0mph; 382.216\u00a0km/h) and fastest qualification four-lap average (236.986\u00a0mph; 381.392\u00a0km/h).[178][179] These speed records still stand as of 2022[update].[180]\n\n\n\n#### Formula Ford[edit]\n\n\nFormula Ford, conceived in the UK in 1966, is an entry-level type of formula racing with wingless single-seater cars. Many of today's formula racing drivers started their car racing careers in this category.\n\n\n\n#### Formula One[edit]\n\n\nFord was heavily involved in Formula One for many years and supplied engines to a large number of teams from 1967 until 2004. These engines were designed and manufactured by Cosworth, the racing division that was owned by Ford from 1998 to 2004. Ford-badged engines won 176 Grands Prix between 1967 and 2003 for teams such as Team Lotus and McLaren. Ford entered Formula One as a constructor in 2000 under the Jaguar Racing name, after buying the Stewart Grand Prix team which had been its primary 'works' team in the series since 1997. Jaguar achieved little success in Formula One, and after a turbulent five seasons, Ford withdrew from the category after the 2004 season, selling both Jaguar Racing (which became Red Bull Racing) and Cosworth (to Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven).[181]\n\n\nFord has announced that it will return to Formula One in 2026 following a partnership with Red Bull Powertrains, supplying power units to Red Bull Racing and Scuderia AlphaTauri.[182]\n\n\n\n### Stock car racing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ryan Blaney driving the No. 21 Wood Brothers Ford in 2016 at Michigan International Speedway\nFord is one of three manufacturers in NASCAR's three major series: the Cup Series, Xfinity Series, and Truck Series. Major teams include RFK Racing, Team Penske, Stewart-Haas Racing, and Wood Brothers Racing. Ford is represented by the Mustang GT in the Cup Series, and the Xfinity Series and by the F-150 in the Truck Series. Some of the most successful NASCAR Fords were the aerodynamic fastback Ford Torino, Ford Torino Talladega, Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II, and Mercury Montegos, and the aero-era Ford Thunderbirds. The Ford nameplate has won eight manufacturer's championships in Sprint Cup while Mercury has won one. In the Sprint Cup Series, Ford earned its 1,000th victory in the 2013 Quicken Loans 400.[183] The Ford Fusion is also used in the ARCA Racing Series. Ford had last won a drivers' championship in the Cup Series with Joey Logano in 2022.\n\n\n\n### Rally[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford World Rally Team\n\n![](image)Jari-Matti Latvala driving the Ford Focus RS WRC 09 in 2010\nFord has a long history in rallying and has been active in the World Rally Championship since the beginning of the world championship, the 1973 season. Ford took the 1979 manufacturers' title with Hannu Mikkola, Bj\u00f6rn Waldeg\u00e5rd, and Ari Vatanen driving the Ford Escort RS1800. In the Group B era, Ford achieved success with Ford RS200. Since the 1999 season, Ford has used various versions of the Ford Focus WRC to much success. In the 2006 season, BP-Ford World Rally Team secured Ford its second manufacturers' title, with the Focus RS WRC 06 built by M-Sport and driven by \"Flying Finns\" Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm and Mikko Hirvonen.[184] Continuing with Gr\u00f6nholm and Hirvonen, Ford successfully defended the manufacturers' world championship in the 2007 season. Ford is the only manufacturer to score in the points for 92 consecutive races; since the 2002 season opener Monte Carlo Rally.[185]\n\n\n\n### Rallycross[edit]\n\n\nFord has competed in rallycross with its Ford Fiesta and Ford Focus. Tanner Foust won the Global RallyCross Championship in 2011 and 2012 and was runner-up in the FIA European Rallycross Championship in 2011 and 2012. Toomas Heikkinen won the Global RallyCross Championship title in 2013 and Joni Wiman won it in 2014. Other notable Ford drivers include Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm, Ken Block, and Brian Deegan.\n\n\n\n### Sports cars[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford GT \u00a7\u00a0Racing\n\nFord sports cars have been visible in the world of sports car racing since 1964. Most notably the Ford GT40 won the 24 Hours of Le Mans four times (in 1966, 1967, 1968 and 1969) and is the only American car to ever win overall at this prestigious event. Ford also won four titles at the World Sportscar Championship with the GT40. Swiss team Matech GT Racing, in collaboration with Ford Racing, opened a new chapter with the Ford GT, winning the Teams title in the 2008 FIA GT3 European Championship.\n\n\n\n#### Ford Mustang[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford Mustang \u00a7\u00a0Racing\n\n![](image)A GT racing version of the Ford Mustang, competing in the Koni Challenge in 2005\nThe Ford Mustang has arguably been Ford's most successful sports car. Jerry Titus won the 1965 SCCA Pro B National Championship with a Mustang and the model went on to earn Ford the SCCA Trans-Am Championship title in both 1966 and 1967. Ford won the Trans-Am Championship again in 1970 with Parnelli Jones and George Follmer driving Boss 302 Mustangs for Bud Moore Engineering. Ford took the 1985 and 1986 IMSA GTO Championship with Mustangs driven by John Jones and Scott Pruett before returning to Trans-Am glory with a championship in 1989 with Dorsey Schroeder. Ford dominated Trans-Am in the 1990s with Tommy Kendall winning championships in 1993, 1995, 1996, and 1997 with Paul Gentilozzi adding yet another title in 1999. In 2005 the Ford Mustang FR500C took the championship in the Rolex Koni Challenge Series in its first year on the circuit. In 2007, Ford added a victory in the GT4 European Championship. 2008 was the first year of the Mustang Challenge for the Miller Cup, a series that pits a full field of identical factory-built Ford Mustang race cars against each other. Also, in 2008, Ford won the manufacturers championship in the Koni Challenge Series and HyperSport drivers Joe Foster and Steve Maxwell won the drivers title in a Mustang GT.\n\n\nFord and Michelin teamed up to provide custom-engineered tires for the Ford Performance vehicle lineup. Ford Performance director Dave Pericak said: \"That confidence extends from our upcoming racing effort at Le Mans in 2016 with the all-new Ford GT, to the Ford Performance vehicle lineup, including the Shelby GT350 and F-150 Raptor\".[186]\n\n\n\n### Touring cars[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford Performance Racing Ford Falcon V8 Supercar at Eastern Creek in Australia in 2008\nFord has campaigned touring cars such as the Focus, Falcon, and Contour/Mondeo and the Sierra Cosworth in many different series throughout the years. Notably, Mondeo drivers finished 1, 2, and 3 in the 2000 British Touring Car Championship and Falcon drivers placed 1, 2, and 3 in the 2005 V8 Supercar Championship Series.\n\n\n\n### Drag racing[edit]\n\n\nIn drag racing, John Force Racing drivers John Force, Tony Pedregon, and Robert Hight have piloted Ford Mustang Funny Cars to several NHRA titles in recent seasons. Teammates Tim Wilkerson and Bob Tasca III also drive Mustangs in Funny Car.\n\n\n\n### Drifting[edit]\n\n\nFord has branched out into drifting with the introduction of the new model Mustang. Most noticeable is the Turquoise and Blue Falken Tires Mustang driven by Vaughn Gittin, Jr., (A.K.A. \"JR\") that produces 750 RWHP (Rear Wheel Horsepower).\n\n\n\n## Environmental initiatives[edit]\n\n\n### Compressed natural gas[edit]\n\n\nThe alternative fossil fuel vehicles, such as some versions of the Crown Victoria especially in fleet and taxi service, operate on compressed natural gas\u2014or CNG. Some CNG vehicles have dual fuel tanks\u2014one for gasoline, the other for CNG\u2014the same engine can operate on either fuel via a selector switch.\n\n\n\n### Flexible fuel vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Ford Focus Flexifuel was the first E85 flexible fuel vehicle commercially available in the European market.\nFlexible fuel vehicles are designed to operate smoothly using a wide range of available ethanol fuel mixtures\u2014from pure gasoline to bioethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) or E100 (neat hydrous ethanol) in Brazil. Part of the challenge of successful marketing alternative and flexible fuel vehicles in the U.S. is the general lack of establishment of sufficient fueling stations, which would be essential for these vehicles to be attractive to a wide range of consumers. Significant efforts to ramp up production and distribution of E85 fuels are underway and expanding.[187] Current Ford E100 Flex sold in the Brazilian market are the Courier, Ford EcoSport, Ford Fiesta, Ford Focus, and Ford Ka.\n\n\n\n### Electric drive vehicles[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

Bush at the Kansas City Assembly plant in Claycomo, Missouri, on March 20, 2007, touting Ford's new hybrid cars\nIn 2004, Ford and Toyota agreed a patent-sharing accord that granted Ford access to certain hybrid technology patented by Toyota; in exchange, Ford licensed some of its own patents to Toyota.[188][189][190] In 2004, Ford introduced the Escape Hybrid. With this vehicle, Ford was third to the automotive market with a hybrid electric vehicle and the first hybrid electric SUV to market. This was also the first hybrid electric vehicle with a flexible fuel capability to run on E85.[191] The Escape's platform mate Mercury Mariner was also available with the hybrid-electric system in the 2006 model year\u2014a full year ahead of schedule. The similar Mazda Tribute will also receive a hybrid-electric powertrain option, along with many other vehicles in the Ford vehicle line.\n\n\nIn 2005, Ford announced a goal to make 250,000 hybrids a year by 2010, but by mid-2006 announced that it would not meet that goal, due to excessively high costs and the lack of sufficient supplies of the hybrid-electric batteries and drivetrain system components.[192] Instead, Ford has committed to accelerating development of next-generation hybrid-electric power plants in Britain, in collaboration with Volvo. This engineering study is expected to yield more than 100 new hybrid-electric vehicle models and derivatives.\n\n\nIn September 2007, Ford announced a partnership with Southern California Edison (SCE) to examine how plug-in hybrids will work with the electrical grid. Under the multimillion-dollar, multi-year project, Ford will convert a demonstration fleet of Ford Escape Hybrids into plug-in hybrids, and SCE will evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid. Some of the vehicles will be evaluated \"in typical customer settings\", according to Ford.[35][36]\n\n\nOn June 12, 2008, USDOE expanded its own fleet of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles with the addition of a Ford Escape Plug-In Hybrid Flex-Fuel Vehicle. The vehicle is equipped with a 10-kilowatt (13\u00a0hp) lithium-ion battery supplied by Johnson Controls-Saft that stores enough electric energy to drive up to 30 miles (48\u00a0km) at speeds of up to 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[193] In March 2009, Ford launched hybrid versions of the Ford Fusion Hybrid and the Mercury Milan Hybrid in the United States, both as 2010 models.[194]\n\n\nAs of November\u00a02014[update], Ford has produced for retail sales the following hybrid electric vehicles: Ford Escape Hybrid (2004\u20132012), Mercury Mariner Hybrid (2005\u20132010), Mercury Milan Hybrid (2009\u20132010), Ford Fusion Hybrid (2009\u2013present), Lincoln MKZ Hybrid (2010\u2013present), Ford C-Max Hybrid (2012\u2013present), and Ford Mondeo Hybrid (2014\u2013present). By June 2012, Ford had sold 200,000 full hybrids in the U.S. since 2004,[195] and, as of September\u00a02014[update], the carmaker has sold over 344,000 hybrids in the United States.[195][196][197][198] The top selling hybrids in the U.S. market are the Fusion Hybrid with 127,572 units, followed by Escape Hybrid with 117,997 units, and the C-Max Hybrid with 54,236.[196][197][198][199][200] As of November\u00a02014[update], Ford is the world's second-largest manufacturer of hybrids after Toyota Motor Corporation, with 400,000 hybrid electric vehicles produced since their introduction in 2004.[201]\n\n\n\n#### Plug-in electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Plug-in electric vehicle\n\nAs of October\u00a02014[update], Ford has produced the following plug-in electric vehicles: the all-electric Ford Ranger EV (1997\u20132002), Ford TH!NK (1999\u20132003), Transit Connect (2010\u20132012), and Ford Focus Electric (2011\u20132018); and the plug-in hybrids C-MAX Energi (2012\u20132017) and the Fusion Energi (2013\u20132020), sold under the Mondeo nameplate in Europe.[202][203] Since the launch of the Focus Electric in 2011, combined sales of all Ford plug-in electric models amounted to just over 56,000 through October 2015.[204]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Azure Transit Connect Electric was produced between 2010 and 2012 as a collaboration between Azure Dynamics and Ford Motor Company.\nBill Ford was one of the first top industry executives to make regular use of a battery electric vehicle, a Ford Ranger EV, while the company contracted with the United States Postal Service to deliver electric postal vans based on the Ranger EV platform. Ford discontinued a line of electric Ranger pickup trucks and ordered them destroyed, though it reversed in January 2005, after environmentalist protest.[205] The all-electric pickup truck leased 205 units to individuals and 1,500 units to fleets in the U.S. from 1998 to 2002.[206][207]\n\n\nFrom 2009 to 2011, Ford offered the Ford TH!NK car. Ford ended production and ordered all the cars repossessed and destroyed, even as many of the people leasing them begged to be able to buy the cars from Ford. After an outcry from the lessees and activists in the U.S. and Norway, Ford returned the cars to Norway for sale.[208] Four hundred and forty units were leased in the U.S. from 1999 until 2003.[207]\n\n\nIn 2017, Ford CEO Mark Fields announced that the company would invest $4.5 billion in further development of plug-in electric vehicles by 2020.[209]\n\n\nThe Azure Transit Connect Electric was an all-electric van developed as a collaboration between Azure Dynamics and Ford Motor Company, but Azure was the official manufacturer of record.[210] The Transit Connect Electric had an official U.S. Environmental Protection Agency all-electric range of 56\u00a0mi (90\u00a0km).[211] The EPA rated the combined city/highway fuel economy at 62 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (3.8\u00a0L/100\u00a0km equivalent).[211] Deliveries for fleet customers in the U.S. and Canada began in December 2010.[212] Production of the electric van was stopped in March 2012 as a result of Azure's bankruptcy protection filing. Ford continues to provide servicing.[213] Around 500 units were sold before Azure stopped production.[214]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Ford Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid shares its powertrain with the Ford C-Max Energi.\nThe Ford Focus Electric is based on the next generation Focus internal combustion vehicle, converted to an all-electric propulsion system as a production electric car by Magna International, and retail sales began in the U.S. in December 2011.[215][216] The Focus Electric has an EPA rated range of 76\u00a0mi (122\u00a0km) and a combined city/highway fuel economy of 105 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (2.2\u00a0L/100\u00a0km).[217] Available also in Canada and several European countries, 3,965 units have been sold in the U.S. through September 2014.[196][197][198][218]\n\n\nThe Ford C-Max Energi is a plug-in hybrid released in the U.S. in October 2012. The C-Max Energi has an EPA rated all-electric range of 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) and a combined city/highway fuel economy in all-electric mode at 88 MPG-e (2.7\u00a0L/100\u00a0km).[219] U.S. sales totaled 33,509 units through December 2016.[196][197][220][221][222] Deliveries of the Ford Fusion Energi began in the United States in February 2013.[223][224] The Fusion Energi has an all-electric range of 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) and an equivalent fuel economy EPA rating of 88 MPG-e (2.7\u00a0L/100\u00a0km).[219] As of December\u00a02016[update], a total of 43,327 units have been delivered in the U.S. since its inception.[197][220][221][222]\n\n\nBoth Energi models share the same powertrain technology and have the same EPA combined city/highway fuel economy in hybrid operation of 38\u00a0mpg\u2011US (6.2\u00a0L/100\u00a0km; 46\u00a0mpg\u2011imp).[219]\nWhen asked about a battery-electric vehicle with a 200-mile (320\u00a0km) range, Fields said in April 2016 \"Clearly that's something we're developing for\". Ford has a pending trademark application on the \"Model E\" name,[225] preventing the Tesla Model 3 in using the name.[226]\n\n\nIn October 2017, Ford announced its Team Edison battery-electric vehicle group to lead the company's renewed efforts into the EV market, in which it currently offers only the Focus subcompact and has plans for a small 300-mile SUV by 2020.[227] The new team will be headquartered in Detroit and have offices in Europe and Asia.[228]\n\n\nIn 2022, Ford began manufacturing its E-Transit electric cargo vans at its plant in Kansas City, Missouri.[229]\n\n\n\n![a photograph showing the front-left quarter of a grey automobile](image)Ford Mustang Mach-E\n### Hydrogen[edit]\n\n\nFord also continues to study fuel cell-powered electric powertrains and has demonstrated hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. Compared with conventional vehicles, hybrid vehicles and/or fuel cell vehicles decrease air pollution emissions as well as sound levels, with favorable impacts upon respiratory health and decrease of noise health effects.\n\n\nFord has launched the production of hydrogen-powered shuttle buses, using hydrogen instead of gasoline in a standard internal combustion engine, for use at airports and convention centers.[230] At the 2006 Greater Los Angeles Auto Show, Ford showcased a hydrogen fuel cell version of its Explorer SUV. The Fuel cell Explorer has a combined output of 174\u00a0hp (130\u00a0kW). It has a large hydrogen storage tank which is situated in the center of the car taking the original place of the conventional model's automatic transmission. The centered position of the tank assists the vehicle reach a notable range of 350 miles (563\u00a0km), the farthest for a fuel cell vehicle so far. The fuel cell Explorer the first in a series of prototypes partly funded by the United States Department of Energy to expand efforts to determine the feasibility of hydrogen-powered vehicles. The fuel cell Explorer is one of several vehicles with green technology being featured at the L.A. show, including the 2008 Ford Escape Hybrid, PZEV emissions compliant Fusion and Focus models and a 2008 Ford F-Series Super Duty outfitted with Ford's clean diesel technology.\n\n\n\n### Increased fuel efficiency[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2008, Ford Motor Company announced that it would accelerate its plans to produce more fuel-efficient cars, changing both its North American manufacturing plans and its lineup of vehicles available in the United States. In terms of North American manufacturing, the company planned to convert three existing truck and sport utility vehicle (SUV) plants for small car production, with the first conversion at its Michigan Truck Plant. In addition, Ford's assembly plants near Mexico City, Mexico, and in Louisville, Kentucky, were to be converted from pickups and SUVs to small cars, including the Ford Fiesta, by 2011. Ford then also planned to introduce to North America six of its European small vehicles, including two versions of the Ford Fiesta, by the end of 2012.[231]\n\n\nFord of Europe developed the ECOnetic programme to address the market and legislative need for higher fuel efficiency and lower CO2 emissions. As opposed to the hybrid engine technology used in competitor products such as the Toyota Prius, ECOnetic improves existing technology. Using lower-consuming Duratorq TDCi diesel engines, and based on a combination of improved aerodynamics, lower resistance, and improved efficiency, the Ford Fiesta was the lowest-emitting mass-produced car in Europe[232] while the 2012 Ford Focus ECOnetic will have better fuel consumption than the Prius or the Volkswagen Golf BlueMotion.[233] ECOnetic is not presently planned to be sold in North American due to current perceived lower consumer demand.[234]\n\n\nFord has challenged University teams to create a vehicle that is simple, durable, lightweight, and comes equipped with a base target price of only $7,000. The students from Aachen University created the \"2015 Ford Model T\".[235][236]\n\n\nIn 2000, under the leadership of the current Ford chairman, William Clay Ford, the company announced[237] a planned 25 percent improvement in the average mileage of its SUVs\u2014to be completed by the 2005 calendar year. In 2003, Ford announced that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent the company from achieving this goal.[238]\n\n\nFor the 2007 model year, Ford had thirteen U.S. models that achieve 30 miles per gallon or better (based on the highway fuel economy estimates of the EPA) and several of Ford's vehicles were recognized in the EPA and Department of Energy Fuel Economy Guide for best-in-class fuel economy. Ford claimed to have eliminated nearly three million pounds of smog-forming emissions from their U.S. cars and light trucks over the 2004 to 2006 model years.[239] However, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has linked Ford to 54 Superfund toxic waste sites, twelve of which have been cleaned up and deleted from the list.[240]\n\n\n\n### Efficient buildings[edit]\n\n\nAs part of a renovation of the Ford River Rouge Complex, in 2010 Ford unveiled a 10.4-acre (42,000\u00a0m2) living roof covering part of the Dearborn Truck plant, consisting of sedum, a low-growing groundcover. The sedum retains and cleanses rainwater and moderates the internal temperature of the building, saving energy.[241]\n\n\nIn 2016, Ford announced a ten-year renovation plan for its Dearborn campus.[242] The plan features consolidation of office and lab spaces in to fewer and much larger buildings, which will be built to LEED standards, and will feature extensive use of wetlands and park spaces.[243][244] The new campus features new multi-story parking decks with solar power-generating roofs,[245] and a new natural gas power plant. The DTE Ford Central Energy Plant is a 34MW combined heat-and-power plant which features a high efficiency design and LEED Gold buildings.[246]\n\n\n\n## Sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nFord sponsors numerous events and sports facilities around the U.S., most notably the Ford Center in downtown Evansville, Indiana, and Ford Field in downtown Detroit.[247]\n\n\nThe company has also been a major sponsor of the UEFA Champions League for over two decades, and is also a longtime sponsor of the Sky media channel's coverage of Premier League football.\n\n\nBetween 1994 and 1999, Ford was the main kit sponsor of German Bundesliga club 1. FC K\u00f6ln.\n\n\n\n## Sales numbers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Calendar Year\n | US sales\n | Market share\nof US sales[248]\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1997\n | 3,877,458[249] | 25.0%\n |\n| 1998\n | 3,922,604[250] | 24.5%\n |\n| 1999\n | 4,163,369[251] | 23.9%\n |\n| 2000\n | 4,202,820\n | 23.6%\n |\n| 2001\n | 3,971,364\n | 22.7%\n |\n| 2002\n | 3,623,709[252] | 21.2%\n |\n| 2003\n | 3,483,719\n | 20.5%\n |\n| 2004\n | 3,331,676[253] | 19.3%\n |\n| 2005\n | 3,153,875\n | 18.1%\n |\n| 2006\n | 2,901,090[254] | 17.0%\n |\n| 2007\n | 2,507,366\n | 15.2%\n |\n| 2008\n | 1,988,376[255] | 14.7%\n |\n| 2009\n | 1,620,888[256] | 15.3%\n |\n| 2010\n | 1,935,462[257] | 16.4%\n |\n| 2011\n | 2,143,101[258] | 16.4%\n |\n| 2012\n | 2,250,165[259] | 15.2%\n |\n| 2013\n | 2,493,918[260] | 15.7%\n |\n| 2014\n | 2,480,942[261] | 14.7%\n |\n| 2015\n | 2,613,162[262] | 14.6%\n |\n| 2016\n | 2,614,697[263][264] | 14.6%\n |\n| 2017\n | 2,586,715[265] | 14.7%\n |\n| 2018\n | 2,497,318[265] | 14.1%\n |\n| 2019\n | 2,422,698[266] | 13.8%\n |\n| 2020\n | 2,044,744[267] | 13.7%\n |\n| 2021\n | 1,905,955[268] | 12.4%\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Cars portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![flag](image)Michigan portal\n\n\n* Ford's Garage\n* Bridj\n* Chariot (company)\n* Detroit Automobile Company\n* Dodge v.

Aside from their core automobile and motorcycle businesses, Honda also manufactures garden equipment, marine engines, personal watercraft, power generators, and other products. Since 1986, Honda has been involved with artificial intelligence/robotics research and released their ASIMO robot in 2000. They have also ventured into aerospace with the establishment of GE Honda Aero Engines in 2004 and the Honda HA-420 HondaJet, which began production in 2012. Honda has two joint-ventures in China: Dongfeng Honda and GAC Honda.\n\n\nIn 2013, Honda invested about 5.7% (US$6.8 billion) of its revenues into research and development.[10] Also in 2013, Honda became the first Japanese automaker to be a net exporter from the United States, exporting 108,705 Honda and Acura models, while importing only 88,357.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Honda's foray into four-wheelers started with the Honda T360 in 1963.\nThroughout his life, Honda's founder, Soichiro Honda (1906\u20131991), had an interest in automobiles. He worked as a mechanic at the Art Shokai garage, where he tuned cars and entered them in races. In 1937, with financing from his acquaintance Kato Shichir\u014d, Honda founded T\u014dkai Seiki (Eastern Sea Precision Machine Company) to make piston rings working out of the Art Shokai garage.[12] After initial failures, T\u014dkai Seiki won a contract to supply piston rings to Toyota, but lost the contract due to the poor quality of their products.[12] After attending engineering school without graduating, and visiting factories around Japan to better understand Toyota's quality control processes known as \"Five whys\", by 1941 Honda was able to mass-produce piston rings acceptable to Toyota, using an automated process that could employ even unskilled wartime laborers.[12][13]:\u200a16\u201319\n\n\nT\u014dkai Seiki was placed under the control of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (called the Ministry of Munitions after 1943) at the start of World War II, and Soichiro Honda was demoted from president to senior managing director after Toyota took a 40% stake in the company.[12] Honda also aided the war effort by assisting other companies in automating the production of military aircraft propellers.[12] The relationships Honda cultivated with personnel at Toyota, Nakajima Aircraft Company and the Imperial Japanese Navy would be instrumental in the postwar period.[12] A US B-29 bomber attack destroyed T\u014dkai Seiki's Yamashita plant in 1944, and the Itawa plant collapsed on 13 January 1945 Mikawa earthquake. Soichiro Honda sold the salvageable remains of the company to Toyota after the war for \u00a5450,000 and used the proceeds to found the Honda Technical Research Institute in October 1946.[12][14]\n\n\nWith a staff of 12 men working in a 16\u00a0m2 (170\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) shack, they built and sold improvised motorized bicycles, using a supply of 500 two-stroke *50\u00a0cc* Tohatsu war surplus radio generator engines.[12][13]:\u200a19[15] When the engines ran out, Honda began building their own copy of the Tohatsu engine, and supplying these to customers to attach to their bicycles.[12][15] This was the Honda A-Type, nicknamed the Bata Bata for the sound the engine made.[12] In 1949, the Honda Technical Research Institute was liquidated for \u00a51,000,000, or about US$5,000 today; these funds were used to incorporate Honda Motor Co., Ltd.[13]:\u200a21 At about the same time Honda hired engineer Kihachiro Kawashima, and Takeo Fujisawa who provided indispensable business and marketing expertise to complement Soichiro Honda's technical bent.[13]:\u200a21 The close partnership between Soichiro Honda and Fujisawa lasted until they stepped down together in October 1973.[13]:\u200a21\n\n\nThe first complete motorcycle with both the frame and engine made by Honda was the 1949 D-Type, the first Honda to go by the name Dream.[14][16] In 1961, Honda achieved its first Grand Prix victories and World Championships in the 125\u00a0cc and 250\u00a0cc categories.[17] Honda Motor Company grew in a short time to become the world's largest manufacturer of motorcycles by 1964.[18]\nThe first production automobile from Honda was the T360 mini pick-up truck, which went on sale in August 1963.[19] Powered by a small 356\u00a0cc straight-4 gasoline engine, it was classified under the cheaper Kei car tax bracket.[20] The second production car from Honda was the S500 sports car, which followed the T360 into production in October 1963. Its chain-driven rear wheels pointed to Honda's motorcycle origins.[21]\n\n\nOver the next few decades, Honda worked to expand its product line, operations and exports to numerous countries around the world. In 1986, Honda introduced the successful Acura brand to the American market in an attempt to gain ground in the luxury vehicle market. The year 1991 saw the introduction of the Honda NSX supercar, the first all-aluminum monocoque vehicle that incorporated a mid-engine V6 with variable-valve timing.[22]\n\n\nIn 1990, CEO Tadashi Kume was succeeded by Nobuhiko Kawamoto. Kawamoto was selected over Shoichiro Irimajiri, who oversaw the successful establishment of Honda of America Manufacturing, Inc. in Marysville, Ohio. Irimajiri and Kawamoto shared a friendly rivalry within Honda; owing to health issues, Irimajiri would resign in 1992.\n\n\nFollowing the death of Soichiro Honda and the departure of Irimajiri, Honda found itself quickly being outpaced in product development by other Japanese automakers and was caught off-guard by the truck and sport utility vehicle boom of the 1990s, all which took a toll on the profitability of the company. Japanese media reported in 1992 and 1993 that Honda was at serious risk of an unwanted and hostile takeover by Mitsubishi Motors, which at the time was a larger automaker by volume and was flush with profits from its successful Pajero and Diamante models.[23]\n\n\nKawamoto acted quickly to change Honda's corporate culture, rushing through market-driven product development that resulted in recreational vehicles such as the first-generation Odyssey and the CR-V, and a refocusing away from some of the numerous sedans and coupes that were popular with the company's engineers but not with the buying public. The most shocking change to Honda came when Kawamoto ended the company's successful participation in Formula One after the 1992 season, citing costs in light of the takeover threat from Mitsubishi as well as the desire to create a more environmentally friendly company image.[24]\n\n\nThe Honda Aircraft Company as established in 2006 as a wholly owned subsidiary to manufacture and sell the HondaJet family of aircraft.[25][26] The first deliveries to customers began in December 2015.[27]\n\n\nOn February 23, 2015, Honda announced that CEO and President Takanobu Ito would step down and be replaced by Takahiro Hachigo in June of that year; additional retirements by senior managers and directors were expected.[28]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Honda was reported to be in talks with Hitachi to merge the two companies' car parts businesses, creating a components supplier with almost $17 billion in annual sales.[29]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Honda announced that it would be withdrawing employees working in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[30] On March 23, 2020 due to the global spread of the virus, Honda became the first major automaker with operations in the US to suspend production in its factories. It resumed automobile, engine and transmission production at its US plants on May 11, 2020.[31]\n\n\nHonda and General Motors announced in September 2020 a North American alliance to begin in 2021.[32] According to The Detroit Free Press, \"The proposed alliance will include sharing a range of vehicles, to be sold under each company\u2019s distinct brands, as well as cooperation in purchasing, research and development, and connected services.\"[33]\n\n\nIn 2021, Honda announced its intention to become the world's first carmaker to sell a vehicle with level 3 self-driving technology.[34]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Honda announced it would develop and build electric vehicles in a joint venture with Sony. The latter is set to provide its imaging, sensing, network and other technologies while Honda would be responsible for the car manufacturing processes. The venture is set to fully launch later in 2022 with the release of first cars scheduled for 2025.[35]\n\n\nIn 2023, Honda announced a deal with American car company General Motors to produce cars using a new hydrogen fuel system. The aim is to ramp up the hydrogen powered cells in their Electric vehicles as well as trucks, construction machinery, and power stations.[36]\n\n\nIn 2023, Honda recalled 500,000 vehicles in the United States and Canada due to an issue with seat belts in the car not latching correctly. Among the models recalled were the 2017-2020 CR-V, the 2018 and 2019 Accord, the 2018-2020 Odyssey, the 2019 Insight, and the Acura RDX from 2019 and 2020. According to the recall, the seat belts in the front seats would break open on impact increasing the risk of injury in a crash.[37]\n\n\n\n## Senior leadership[edit]\n\n\n* *Chairman:* Toshiaki Mikoshiba (since April 2019) [38]\n* *President and Chief Executive*: Toshihiro Mibe (since April 2021) [38]\n\n\n## Corporate profile and divisions[edit]\n\n\nHonda is headquartered in Minato, Tokyo, Japan. Their shares trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange, as well as exchanges in Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Kyoto, Fukuoka, London, Paris, and Switzerland.\n\n\nThe company has assembly plants around the globe. These plants are located in China, the United States, Pakistan, Canada, England, Japan, Belgium, Brazil, M\u00e9xico, New Zealand, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Turkey, Taiwan, Per\u00fa and Argentina. As of July 2010, 89% of Honda and Acura vehicles sold in the United States were built in North American plants, up from 82.2% a year earlier. This shields profits from the yen's advance to a 15-year high against the dollar.[39]\n\n\nAmerican Honda Motor Company is based in Torrance, California. Honda Racing Corporation (HRC) is Honda's motorsport division. Honda Canada Inc. is headquartered in Markham, Ontario,[40] it was originally planned to be located in Richmond Hill, Ontario, but delays led them to look elsewhere. Their manufacturing division, Honda of Canada Manufacturing, is based in Alliston, Ontario. Honda has also created joint ventures around the world, such as Honda Siel Cars and Hero Honda Motorcycles in India,[41] Guangzhou Honda and Dongfeng Honda in China, Boon Siew Honda in Malaysia and Honda Atlas in Pakistan. The company also runs a business innovation initiative called **Honda Xcelerator**, in order to build relationships with innovators, partner with Silicon Valley startups and entrepreneurs, and help other companies work on prototypes. Xcelerator had worked with reportedly 40 companies as of January 2019. Xcelerator and a developer studio are part of the **Honda Innovations** group, formed in Spring 2017 and based in Mountain View, California.[42] Through Honda Mobilityland, Honda also operate the Suzuka Circuit and Twin Ring Motegi racing tracks.\n\n\nFollowing the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, Honda announced plans to halve production at its UK plants.[43] The decision was made to put staff at the Swindon plant on a 2-day week until the end of May as the manufacturer struggled to source supplies from Japan. It's thought around 22,500 cars were produced during this period.\n\n\nFor the fiscal year 2018, Honda reported earnings of US$9.534 billion, with an annual revenue of US$138.250 billion, an increase of 6.2% over the previous fiscal cycle.

In 1965, Honda built a two-door commercial delivery van, named the Honda L700. Honda's first four-door sedan was not the Honda Accord, but the air-cooled, four-cylinder, gasoline-powered Honda 1300 which was introduced in 1969. The Civic was a hatchback that gained wide popularity internationally, but it wasn't the first two-door hatchback built by Honda. That was the Honda N360, a Kei car that was adapted for international sale as the N600. The Civic, which appeared in 1972 and replaced the N600 also had a smaller sibling that replaced the air-cooled N360, called the Honda Life, which was water-cooled.\n\n\nThe Honda Life represented Honda's efforts in competing in the *kei* car segment, offering sedan, delivery van and small pick-up platforms on a shared chassis. The Life Step Van had a novel approach that, while not initially a commercial success, appeared to be an influence to vehicles with the front passengers sitting behind the engine, a large cargo area with a flat roof and a liftgate installed in back, and utilizing a transversely installed engine with a front-wheel-drive powertrain.\n\n\nAs Honda entered into automobile manufacturing in the late 1960s where Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota and Nissan had been making cars since before WWII, Honda instilled a sense of doing things a little differently than its Japanese competitors. Its mainstay products like the Accord and Civic (with the exception of its USA-market 1993\u201397 Passport which was part of a vehicle exchange program with Isuzu (part of the Subaru-Isuzu joint venture)) have always employed Front-wheel drive powertrain implementation, which is currently a long-held Honda tradition. Honda also installed new technologies into their products, first as optional equipment, then later standard, like anti-lock brakes, speed-sensitive power steering, and multi-port fuel injection in the early 1980s. This desire to be the first to try new approaches is evident with the creation of the first Japanese luxury chain Acura, and was also evident with the all-aluminum, mid-engined sports car, the Honda NSX, which also introduced variable valve timing technology, which Honda calls VTEC.\n\n\nThe Civic family is a line of compact cars developed and manufactured by Honda. In North America, the Civic is the second-longest continuously running nameplate from a Japanese manufacturer; only its perennial rival, the Toyota Corolla, introduced in 1966, has been in production longer.[47] The Civic, along with the Accord and Prelude, comprised Honda's vehicles sold in North America until the 1990s, when the model lineup was expanded. Having gone through several generational changes, the Civic has become larger and more upmarket, and it currently slots between the Fit and Accord.\n\n\nHonda's first hybrid electric vehicle was the 1999 Insight. The Civic was first offered as a hybrid in 2001, and the Accord followed in 2004. In 2008, the company launched the Clarity, a fuel cell car.\n\n\nIn 2008, Honda increased global production to meet the demand for small cars and hybrids in the U.S. and emerging markets. The company shuffled U.S. production to keep factories busy and boost car output while building fewer minivans and sport utility vehicles as light truck sales fell.[48]\n\n\nIts first entrance into the pickup segment, the light-duty Ridgeline, won Truck of the Year from *Motor Trend* magazine in 2006. Also in 2006, the redesigned Civic won Car of the Year from the magazine, giving Honda a rare double win of Motor Trend honors.\n\n\nIt is reported that Honda plans to increase hybrid sales in Japan to more than 20% of its total sales in the fiscal year 2011, from 14.8% in the previous year.[49]\n\n\nFive of United States Environmental Protection Agency's top ten most fuel-efficient cars from 1984 to 2010 come from Honda, more than any other automakers. The five models are: 2000\u20132006 Honda Insight (53\u00a0mpg\u2011US or 4.4\u00a0L/100\u00a0km or 64\u00a0mpg\u2011imp combined), 1986\u20131987 Honda Civic Coupe HF (46\u00a0mpg\u2011US or 5.1\u00a0L/100\u00a0km or 55\u00a0mpg\u2011imp combined), 1994\u20131995 Honda Civic hatchback VX (43\u00a0mpg\u2011US or 5.5\u00a0L/100\u00a0km or 52\u00a0mpg\u2011imp combined), 2006\u2013 Honda Civic Hybrid (42\u00a0mpg\u2011US or 5.6\u00a0L/100\u00a0km or 50\u00a0mpg\u2011imp combined), and 2010\u2013 Honda Insight (41\u00a0mpg\u2011US or 5.7\u00a0L/100\u00a0km or 49\u00a0mpg\u2011imp combined).[50] The ACEEE has also rated the Civic GX as the greenest car in America for seven consecutive years.[51]\n\n\nHonda currently builds vehicles in factories located in Japan, the United States of America, Canada, China, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Brazil, Indonesia, India, Thailand, Turkey, Argentina, Mexico, Taiwan, and the Philippines.\n\n\n\n### Motorcycles[edit]\n\n\nFor a list of motorcycle products, see list of Honda motorcycles.\n\n![](image)Honda Gold Wing bike\nHonda is the largest motorcycle manufacturer in Japan and has been since it started production in 1955.[12]\nAt its peak in 1982, Honda manufactured almost three million motorcycles annually. By 2006, this figure had been reduced to around 550,000 but was still higher than its three domestic competitors.[12]\n\n\nIn 2017, India became the largest motorcycle market for Honda.[52][53] In India, Honda is leading in the scooters segment, with 59% market share.[54]\n\n\nDuring the 1960s when it was a small manufacturer, Honda broke out of the Japanese motorcycle market and began exporting to the United States. Working with the advertising agency Grey Advertising, Honda created an innovative marketing campaign, using the slogan \"You meet the nicest people on a Honda.\" In contrast to the prevailing negative stereotypes of motorcyclists in America as tough, antisocial rebels, this campaign suggested that Honda motorcycles were made for the everyman. The campaign was hugely successful; the ads ran for three years, and by the end of 1963 alone, Honda had sold 90,000 motorcycles.[13]\n\n\nTaking Honda's story as an archetype of the smaller manufacturer entering a new market already occupied by highly dominant competitors, the story of their market entry, and their subsequent huge success in the U.S. and around the world has been the subject of some academic controversy. Competing explanations have been advanced to explain Honda's strategy and the reasons for their success.[55]\n\n\nThe first of these explanations was put forward when, in 1975, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) was commissioned by the UK government to write a report explaining why and how the British motorcycle industry had been out-competed by its Japanese competitors. The report concluded that the Japanese firms, including Honda, had sought a very high scale of production (they had made a large number of motorbikes) in order to benefit from economies of scale and learning curve effects. It blamed the decline of the British motorcycle industry on the failure of British managers to invest enough in their businesses to profit from economies of scale and scope.[56]\n\n\n\n![](image)2004 Honda Super Cub\nThe second explanation was offered in 1984 by Richard Pascale, who had interviewed the Honda executives responsible for the firm's entry into the U.S. market. As opposed to the tightly focused strategy of low cost and high scale that BCG accredited to Honda, Pascale found that their entry into the U.S. market was a story of \"miscalculation, serendipity, and organizational learning\" \u2013 in other words, Honda's success was due to the adaptability and hard work of its staff, rather than any long-term strategy.[57] For example, Honda's initial plan on entering the US market was to compete in large motorcycles, around 300\u00a0cc. Honda's motorcycles in this class suffered performance and reliability problems when ridden the relatively long distances of the US highways.[13]:\u200a41\u201343 When the team found that the scooters they were using to get themselves around their U.S. base of San Francisco attracted positive interest from consumers they fell back on selling the Super Cub instead.[13]:\u200a41\u201343\n\n\nThe most recent school of thought on Honda's strategy was put forward by Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad in 1989. Creating the concept of core competencies with Honda as an example, they argued that Honda's success was due to its focus on leadership in the technology of internal combustion engines.[58] For example, the high power-to-weight ratio engines Honda produced for its racing bikes provided technology and expertise which was transferable into mopeds. Honda's entry into the U.S. motorcycle market during the 1960s is used as a case study for teaching introductory strategy at business schools worldwide.[59]\n\n\n\n### ATVs[edit]\n\n\nHonda builds utility ATVs under models Recon, Rubicon, Rancher, Foreman and Rincon. Honda also builds sports ATVs under the models TRX 90X, TRX 250X, TRX 400x, TRX 450R and TRX 700.[60]\n\n\n\n### Power equipment[edit]\n\n\n![Honda EU70is Generator](image)A Honda Power EU70is power generator\nPower equipment[61] production started in 1953 with H-type engine (prior to motorcycles).[62]\n\n\nHonda power equipment reached record sales in 2007 with 6.4 million units sold annually.[63] By 2010 (Fiscal year ended 31 March) this figure had decreased to 4.7\u00a0million units.[64] Cumulative production of power products has exceeded 85 million units annually (as of September 2008).[65]\n\n\nHonda power equipment includes:\n\n\n\n* Engine\n* Brush Cutters\n* Tillers\n* Marine Outboard Motors\n* Water Pumps\n* Cultivator\n* Lawn mower\n* Robotic lawn mower\n* Riding mower\n* Trimmer\n* Mower\n* Blower\n* Sprayer\n* Hedge trimmer\n* Snowthrower\n* Generator, welding power supply\n* Pump\n* Outboard engine\n* Inflatable boat\n* Electric 4-wheel Scooter\n* Compact Household Cogeneration Unit\n\n### Engines[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Honda Outboard motors\nHonda engines powered the entire 33-car starting field of the 2010 Indianapolis 500[66] and for the fifth consecutive race, there were no engine-related retirements during the running of the Memorial Day Classic.[67]\n\n\nIn the 1980s Honda developed the GY6 engine for use in motor scooters. Although no longer manufactured by Honda, it's still commonly used in many Chinese, Korean and Taiwanese light vehicles.[68]\n\n\nHonda, despite being known as an engine company, has never built a V8 engine for passenger vehicles. In the late 1990s, the company resisted considerable pressure from its American dealers for a V8 engine (which would have seen use in top-of-the-line Honda SUVs and Acuras), with American Honda reportedly sending one dealer a shipment of V8 beverages to silence them.[69] Honda considered starting V8 production in the mid-2000s for larger Acura sedans, a new version of the high-end NSX sports car (which previously used DOHC V6 engines with VTEC to achieve its high power output) and possible future ventures into the American full-size truck and SUV segment for both the Acura and Honda brands, but this was canceled in late 2008, with Honda citing environmental and worldwide economic conditions as reasons for the termination of this project.[70]\n\n\n\n### Robots[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ASIMO at Expo 2005\nASIMO is part of Honda's Research & Development robotics program. It's the eleventh in a line of successive builds starting in 1986 with Honda E0 moving through the ensuing Honda E series and the Honda P series. Weighing 54 kilograms and standing 130 centimeters tall, ASIMO resembles a small astronaut wearing a backpack, and can walk on two feet in a manner resembling human locomotion, at up to 6\u00a0km/h (3.7\u00a0mph). ASIMO is the world's only humanoid robot able to ascend and descend stairs independently.[71] However, human motions such as climbing stairs are difficult to mimic with a machine, which ASIMO has demonstrated by taking two plunges off a staircase.\n\n\nHonda's robot ASIMO (see below) as an R&D project brings together expertise to create a robot that walks, dances and navigates steps.\n2010 marks the year Honda developed a machine capable of reading a user's brainwaves to move ASIMO. The system uses a helmet covered with electroencephalography and near-infrared spectroscopy sensors that monitor electrical brainwaves and cerebral blood flow signals that alter slightly during the human thought process. The user thinks of one of the limited number of gestures it wants from the robot, which has been fitted with a Brain-Machine Interface.[72]\n\n\n\n### Aircraft[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Honda HA-420 HondaJet\n\nHonda has also pioneered new technology in its HA-420 HondaJet, manufactured by its subsidiary Honda Aircraft Company, which allows new levels of reduced drag, increased aerodynamics and fuel efficiency thus reducing operating costs.[73]\n\n\n\n### Mountain bikes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Honda RN-01 G-cross\n\nHonda has also built a downhill racing bicycle known as the Honda RN-01. It is not available for sale to the public. The bike has a gearbox, which replaces the standard derailleur found on most bikes.\n\n\nHonda has hired several people to pilot the bike, among them Greg Minnaar. The team is known as Team G Cross Honda.\n\n\n\n## Former products[edit]\n\n\n### Solar cells[edit]\n\n\nHonda's solar cell subsidiary company Honda Soltec (Headquarters: Kikuchi-gun, Kumamoto; President and CEO: Akio Kazusa) started sales throughout Japan of thin-film solar cells for public and industrial use on October 24, 2008, after selling solar cells for residential use in October 2007.[74] Honda announced in the end of October 2013 that Honda Soltec would cease business operations in the Spring of 2014 except for support for existing customers and the subsidiary would be dissolved.[75]\n\n\n\n## Motorsports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Honda in motorsport\n\nSee also: Honda Racing Corporation\n\nHonda has been active in motorsports, like Formula One, MotoGP and others. Since 2022, all of Honda's motorsport activities are managed by Honda Racing Corporation (HRC); prior to that time, Honda was separately oversaw the motorbikes racing under the HRC banner while automobile racing under the Honda Racing banner.\n\n\n\n### Automobiles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Honda in Formula One\n\n![](image)Max Verstappen won the 2021 Formula One World Championship with a Honda power unit.\nHonda entered Formula One for the first time in 1964, just one year after starting the production of road cars, making both engine and chassis. Honda achieved their first victory at the 1965 Mexican Grand Prix, and another win at the 1967 Italian Grand Prix, before they withdrew after the 1968 season. They returned to the sport in 1983 as an engine manufacturer, remaining until 1992. This period saw Honda dominate Grand Prix racing,[76] as between 1986 and 1991 they won five consecutive Drivers' Championships with Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, and six Constructors' titles with Williams and McLaren.[77] A third stint from 2000 to 2008, initially as engine maker and later also as team owner, yielded 17 podiums, including one win, and second place in the 2004 constructors' standings. They returned as a power unit supplier for the second year of the hybrid era in 2015 and initially struggled, but intense development saw them become race winners again by 2019, and in 2021 they won the World Drivers' Championship with Max Verstappen and Red Bull Racing.[78] Honda formally left Formula One after 2021 to focus its resources on carbon neutral technologies, but an arrangement was made for it to extend power unit supply for Red Bull until 2025.[79][80] As the series introduced more sustainable regulations, Honda announced it will formally rejoin in 2026 to provide power units to Aston Martin as a works team.[81]\n\n\nHonda debuted in the CART IndyCar World Series as an engine supplier in 1994, and the company won six consecutive Drivers' Championships and four Manufacturers' Championships between 1996 and 2001.[82] In 2003, Honda transferred its effort to the IRL IndyCar Series. In 2004, Honda won the Indianapolis 500 for the first time and claimed the Drivers' and Manufacturers' Championships, a feat which it repeated in 2005.[82] From 2006 to 2011, Honda was the series' lone manufacturer, before manufacturer competition returned for 2012. Since 2012, Honda's turbocharged V6 engines have won the Indianapolis 500 several times as well as claimed multiple Drivers' and Manufacturers' titles.[83] In the Japanese Super Formula Championship, Honda-powered cars have won the championship numerous times since 1981, with their title tally in the double digits. In Formula Two, Honda engines dominated the premier series in 1966 and scored multiple titles in the early 1980s.\n\n\nIn sports car racing, Honda won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1995 in the GT2 class,[84] and in 2010 and 2012 they won in the LMP2 category.[85] Honda made their factory debut in the Super GT Series (previously known as the All-Japan GT Championship) in 1997, and in 2000 they won their first championships.[86] Since then, they have won several further titles, uniquely with both mid- and front-engined cars.[86] Through their Acura and HPD divisions, Honda has also competed in sports prototype racing, beginning with the Spice-Acura prototypes that won the IMSA GT Lights championship in 1991, 1992 and 1993. Acura joined the American Le Mans Series in 2007 and won the 12 Hours of Sebring in class on their debut, before winning the championship in both the LMP1 and LMP2 classes in 2009. The cars were rebranded as HPDs for 2010, after which they won multiple titles in the ALMS and also won the FIA World Endurance Championship in the LMP2 class. Acura returned to prototype racing in 2018 in the DPi class of the IMSA SportsCar Championship, winning championship titles in 2019, 2020 and 2022 as well as the 24 Hours of Daytona overall in 2021, 2022, and 2023.[87] Honda's GT3 car won both the IMSA GTD and Super GT GT300 titles.[88][89]\n\n\nDuring the Group A era of the Japanese Touring Car Championship, Honda won seven manufacturers' titles and six drivers' titles in the sub-1,600 cc division between 1986 and 1993.[90] The following Super Touring era of touring car racing saw Honda win the Japanese and North American championships in 1996 and 1997, while in Europe Honda's Super Touring cars claimed over 40 wins across the British, German and European series. After the collapse of the Super Touring regulations in the early 2000s, Honda remained involved in the British Touring Car Championship, where their cars would win multiple championships in the mid-2000s and throughout the 2010s. Honda entered the World Touring Car Championship in late 2012, and in 2013 they won the Manufacturers' World Championship. Honda's TCR car won the global TCR Model of the Year award in 2019 and 2020.[91]\n\n\n\n### Motorcycles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Honda RC212V raced by Dani Pedrosa\nHonda Racing Corporation (HRC) was formed in 1982. The company combines participation in motorcycle races throughout the world with the development of high-potential racing machines. Its racing activities are an important source for the creation of leading-edge technologies used in the development of Honda motorcycles. HRC also contributes to the advancement of motorcycle sports through a range of activities that include sales of production racing motorcycles, support for satellite teams, and rider education programs.\n\n\nSoichiro Honda, being a race driver himself, could not stay out of international motorsport. In 1959, Honda entered five motorcycles into the Isle of Man TT race, the most prestigious motorcycle race in the world. While always having powerful engines, it took until 1961 for Honda to tune their chassis well enough to allow Mike Hailwood to claim their first Grand Prix victories in the 125 and 250\u00a0cc classes. Hailwood would later pick up their first Senior TT wins in 1966 and 1967. Honda's race bikes were known for their \"sleek & stylish design\" and exotic engine configurations, such as the 5-cylinder, 22,000\u00a0rpm, 125\u00a0cc bike and their 6-cylinder 250\u00a0cc and 297\u00a0cc bikes.\n\n\nIn 1979, Honda returned to Grand Prix motorcycle racing with the monocoque-framed, four-stroke NR500. The FIM rules limited engines to four cylinders, so the NR500 had non-circular, 'race-track', cylinders, each with 8 valves and two connecting rods, in order to provide sufficient valve area to compete with the dominant two-stroke racers. Unfortunately, it seemed Honda tried to accomplish too much at one time and the experiment failed. For the 1982 season, Honda debuted its first two-stroke race bike, the NS500 and in 1983, Honda won their first 500\u00a0cc Grand Prix World Championship with Freddie Spencer. Since then, Honda has become a dominant marque in motorcycle Grand Prix racing, winning a plethora of top-level titles with riders such as Mick Doohan and Valentino Rossi. Honda also head the number of wins at the Isle of Man TT having notched up 227 victories in the solo classes and Sidecar TT,[92] including Ian Hutchinson's clean sweep at the 2010 races.[93]\n\n\nThe outright lap record on the Snaefell Mountain Course was held by Honda, set at the 2015 TT by John McGuinness at an average speed of 132.701\u00a0mph (213.562\u00a0km/h) on a Honda CBR1000RR,[94] bettered the next year by Michael Dunlop on a BMW S1000RR at 133.962\u00a0mph (215.591\u00a0km/h).[95]\n\n\nIn the Motocross World Championship, Honda has claimed seventeen world championships. In the World Enduro Championship, Honda has captured eight titles, most recently with Stefan Merriman in 2003 and with Mika Ahola from 2007 to 2010. In motorcycle trials, Honda has claimed three world championships with Belgian rider Eddy Lejeune.\n\n\n\n## Electric and alternative fuel vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2009 Honda Civic GX hooked up to Phill refueling system\n### Compressed natural gas[edit]\n\n\nThe Honda Civic GX was for a long time the only purpose-built natural gas vehicle (NGV) commercially available in some parts of the U.S.[96][97] The Honda Civic GX first appeared in 1998 as a factory-modified Civic LX that had been designed to run exclusively on compressed natural gas. The car looks and drives just like a contemporary Honda Civic LX, but does not run on gasoline. In 2001, the Civic GX was rated the cleanest-burning internal combustion engine in the world by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).[98][99]\n\n\nFirst leased to the City of Los Angeles, in 2005, Honda started offering the GX directly to the public through factory trained dealers certified to service the GX. Before that, only fleets were eligible to purchase a new Civic GX. In 2006, the Civic GX was released in New York, making it the second state where the consumer is able to buy the car.[100]\n\n\nIn June 2015, Honda announced its decision to phase out the commercialization of natural-gas powered vehicles to focus on the development of a new generation of electrified vehicles such as hybrids, plug-in electric cars and hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles. Since 2008, Honda has sold about 16,000 natural-gas vehicles, mainly to taxi and commercial fleets.[101]\n\n\n\n![](image)Top: Brazilian flexible-fuel Honda Civic Below: U.S. Honda Civic Hybrid\n### Flexible-fuel[edit]\n\n\nHonda's Brazilian subsidiary launched flexible-fuel versions for the Honda Civic and Honda Fit in late 2006. As other Brazilian flex-fuel vehicles, these models run on any blend of hydrous ethanol (E100) and E20-E25 gasoline.[102][103] Initially, and in order to test the market preferences, the carmaker decided to produce a limited share of the vehicles with flex-fuel engines, 33 percent of the Civic production and 28 percent of the Fit models.[102][103] Also, the sale price for the flex-fuel version was higher than the respective gasoline versions, around US$1,000 premium for the Civic, and US$650 for the Fit, despite the fact that all other flex-fuel vehicles sold in Brazil had the same tag price as their gasoline versions.[103][104][105] In July 2009, Honda launched in the Brazilian market its third flexible-fuel car, the Honda City.[106]\n\n\nDuring the last two months of 2006, both flex-fuel models sold 2,427 cars against 8,546 gasoline-powered automobiles,[107] jumping to 41,990 flex-fuel cars in 2007,[108] and reaching 93,361 in 2008.[109] Due to the success of the flex versions, by early 2009 a hundred percent of Honda's automobile production for the Brazilian market is now flexible-fuel, and only a small percentage of gasoline version is produced in Brazil for exports.[110]\n\n\nIn March 2009, Honda launched in the Brazilian market the first flex-fuel motorcycle in the world. Produced by its Brazilian subsidiary Moto Honda da Amaz\u00f4nia, the CG 150 Titan Mix is sold for around US$2,700.[111][112][113]\n\n\n\n### Hybrid electric[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Honda CR-Z, the first sports coupe hybrid to come with a six-speed manual transmission\nIn late 1999, Honda launched the first commercial hybrid electric car sold in the U.S. market, the Honda Insight, just one month before the introduction of the Toyota Prius, and initially sold for US$20,000.[114][115] The first-generation Insight was produced from 2000 to 2006 and had a fuel economy of 70 miles per US gallon (3.4\u00a0L/100\u00a0km; 84\u00a0mpg\u2011imp) for the EPA's highway rating, the most fuel-efficient mass-produced car at the time.[114][115] Total global sales for the Insight amounted to only around 18,000 vehicles.[115] Cumulative global sales reached 100,000 hybrids in 2005 and 200,000 in 2007.[116]\n\n\nHonda introduced the second-generation Insight in Japan in February 2009, and released it in other markets through 2009 and in the U.S. market in April 2009. At $19,800 as a five-door hatchback it will be the least expensive hybrid available in the U.S.[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)2010 Honda Insight hybrid electric vehicle (second generation)\nSince 2002, Honda has also been selling the Honda Civic Hybrid (2003 model) in the U.S. market.[114] It was followed by the Honda Accord Hybrid, offered in model years 2005 through 2007. Sales of the Honda CR-Z began in Japan in February 2010, becoming Honda's third hybrid electric car in the market.[118] As of February\u00a02011[update], Honda was producing around 200,000 hybrids a year in Japan.[119]\n\n\nSales of the Fit Hybrid began in Japan in October 2010, at the time, the lowest price for a gasoline-hybrid electric vehicle sold in the country.[120] The European version, called Honda Jazz Hybrid, was released in early 2011.[121] During 2011 Honda launched three hybrid models available only in Japan, the Fit Shuttle Hybrid, Freed Hybrid and Freed Spike Hybrid.[116]\n\n\nHonda's cumulative global hybrid sales passed the 1 million unit milestone at the end of September 2012, 12 years and 11 months after sales of the first generation Insight began in Japan November 1999.[116] A total of 187,851 hybrids were sold worldwide in 2013, and 158,696 hybrids during the first six months of 2014.[122][123] As of June\u00a02014[update], Honda has sold more than 1.35\u00a0million hybrids worldwide.[116][122][123]\n\n\n\n### Hydrogen fuel cell[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Honda FCX Clarity hydrogen fuel cell vehicle\nIn Takanezawa, Japan, on 16 June 2008, Honda Motors produced the first assembly-line FCX Clarity, a hybrid hydrogen fuel cell vehicle. More efficient than a gas-electric hybrid vehicle, the FCX Clarity combines hydrogen and oxygen from ordinary air to generate electricity for an electric motor. In July 2014 Honda announced the end of production of the Honda FCX Clarity for the 2015 model.[124]\n\n\nThe vehicle itself does not emit any pollutants and its only by-products are heat and water. The FCX Clarity also has an advantage over gas-electric hybrids in that it does not use an internal combustion engine to propel itself. Like a gas-electric hybrid, it uses a lithium ion battery to assist the fuel cell during acceleration and capture energy through regenerative braking, thus improving fuel efficiency. The lack of hydrogen filling stations throughout developed countries will keep production volumes low.[125] Honda will release the vehicle in groups of 150. California is the only U.S. market with infrastructure for fueling such a vehicle, though the number of stations is still limited. Building more stations is expensive, as the California Air Resources Board (CARB) granted $6.8\u00a0million for four H2 fueling stations, costing US$1.7\u00a0million each.[126][127]\n\n\nHonda views hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as the long-term replacement of piston cars, not battery cars.[128]\n\n\n\n### Plug-in electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Honda Fit EV concept unveiled at the 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show\nThe all-electric Honda EV Plus was introduced in 1997 as a result of CARB's zero-emissions vehicle mandate and was available only for leasing in California. The EV plus was the first battery electric vehicle from a major automaker with non-lead\u2013acid batteries The EV Plus had an all-electric range of 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). Around 276 units were sold in the U.S. and production ended in 1999.[129][130]\n\n\nThe all-electric Honda Fit EV was introduced in 2012 and has a range of 82\u00a0mi (132\u00a0km).[131] The all-electric car was launched in the U.S. to retail customers in July 2012 with initial availability limited to California and Oregon.[132] Production is limited to only 1,100 units over the first three years. A total of 1,007 units have been leased in the U.S. through September 2014.[133][134][135] The Fit EV was released in Japan through leasing to local government and corporate customers in August 2012. Availability in the Japanese market is limited to 200 units during its first two years.[136] In July 2014 Honda announced the end of production of the Fit EV for the 2015 model.[124]\n\n\nThe Honda Accord Plug-in Hybrid was introduced in 2013 and has an all-electric range of 13\u00a0mi (21\u00a0km)[137] Sales began in the U.S. in January 2013 and the plug-in hybrid is available only in California and New York.[138] A total of 835 units have been sold in the U.S. through September 2014.[133][134][135] The Accord PHEV was introduced in Japan in June 2013 and is available only for leasing, primarily to corporations and government agencies.[139]\n\n\nThe Honda e was launched in 2020 and has an electric range of 137\u00a0mi (220\u00a0km). It is an electric supermini that is retro styled, similar to the first-generation Honda Civic. Following this, the Honda e:Ny1 was launched in 2023, with an electric range of 256\u00a0mi (412\u00a0km) on the top spec model. It is Honda's first electric SUV.\n\n\nIn April 2022, Honda and General Motors announced a joint venture to develop low-cost electric vehicles based on GM's Ultium architecture in order to beat Tesla vehicles in sales. \n\n\nIn October 2023, the two companies announced that the joint venture has been cancelled due to slower-than-expected demand of electric vehicles and changing market conditions.[140] Although the upcoming Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX will use the Ultium architecture and will be manufactured by General Motors, future Honda electric vehicles will be designed solely by Honda and will be manufactured in Honda assembly plants.[141]\n\n\n\n### Batteries[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Honda and LG Energy Solution announced a joint venture to build a new lithium-ion battery factory in the US for Honda and Acura electric vehicles. At the time of the announcement, the goal was for 40 gigawatt hours.[142]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n###  Japanese marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Honda Clio (Saitama, Japan)\nStarting in 1978, Honda in Japan decided to diversify its sales distribution channels and created **Honda Verno**, which sold established products with a higher content of standard equipment and more sporting nature.[143][144] The establishment of *Honda Verno* coincided with its new sports compact, the Honda Prelude. Later, the Honda Vigor, Honda Ballade, and Honda Quint were added to *Honda Verno* stores. This approach was implemented due to efforts in place by rival Japanese automakers Toyota and Nissan.\n\n\n\n![](image)Honda Primo (Osaka)\nAs sales progressed, Honda created two more sales channels, called **Honda Clio** in 1984, and **Honda Primo** in 1985. The *Honda Clio* chain sold products that were traditionally associated with Honda dealerships before 1978, like the Honda Accord, and *Honda Primo* sold the Honda Civic, kei cars such as the Honda Today, superminis like the Honda Capa, along with other Honda products, such as farm equipment, lawnmowers, portable generators, and marine equipment, plus motorcycles and scooters like the Honda Super Cub. A styling tradition was established when *Honda Primo* and *Clio* began operations in that all *Verno* products had the rear license plate installed in the rear bumper, while *Primo* and *Clio* products had the rear license plate installed on the trunk lid or rear door for minivans. The Renault Clio was sold in Japan at Nissan dealerships, but was renamed the **Renault Lutecia**.[145] Lutecia is derived from the name of *Lutetia*, an ancient Roman city that was the predecessor of Paris.\n\n\n\n![](image)Honda Verno (2008)\nAs time progressed and sales began to diminish partly due to the collapse of the Japanese \"bubble economy\", \"supermini\" and \"kei\" vehicles that were specific to *Honda Primo* were \"badge engineered\" and sold at the other two sales channels, thereby providing smaller vehicles that sold better at both *Honda Verno* and *Honda Clio* locations. As of March 2006, the three sales chains were discontinued, with the establishment of *Honda Cars* dealerships.[146] While the network was disbanded, some Japanese Honda dealerships still use the network names, offering all Japanese market Honda cars at all locations.\n\n\n\n![](image)Honda Wing motorcycle dealership (Japan)\nHonda sells genuine accessories through a separate retail chain called *Honda Access* for both their motorcycle, scooter, and automobile products. In cooperation with corporate group partner Pioneer, Honda sells an aftermarket line of audio and in-car navigation equipment that can be installed in any vehicle under the brand name Gathers, which is available at Honda Access locations as well as Japanese auto parts retailers, such as Autobacs. Buyers of used vehicles are directed to a specific Honda retail chain that sells only used vehicles called *Honda Auto Terrace.*\n\n\nIn the spring of 2012, Honda in Japan introduced *Honda Cars Small Store* which is devoted to compact cars like the Honda Fit, and *kei* vehicles like the Honda N-One and Honda S660 roadster.\n\n\n\n* All cars sold at Honda Verno\n\n\nPrelude, Integra, CR-X, Vigor, Saber, Ballade, Quint, Crossroad, Element, NSX, HR-V, Mobilio Spike, S2000, CR-V, That's, MDX, Rafaga, Capa, and the Torneo\n\n\n\n* All cars sold at Honda Clio\n\n\nAccord, Legend, Inspire, Avancier, S-MX, Lagreat, Stepwgn, Elysion, Stream, Odyssey (int'l), Domani, Concerto, Accord Tourer, Logo, Fit, Insight, That's, Mobilio, and the City\n\n\n\n* All cars sold at Honda Primo\n\n\nCivic, Life, Acty, Vamos, Hobio, Ascot, Ascot Innova, Torneo, Civic Ferio, Freed, Mobilio, Orthia, Capa, Today, Z, and the Beat\n\n\n\n\n### International marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Honda dealership in Ontario, Canada\n![](image)A Honda dealership in Dreghorn, Scotland\nIn 2003, Honda released its *Cog* advertisement in the UK and on the Internet. To make the ad, the engineers at Honda constructed a Rube Goldberg Machine made entirely out of car parts from a Honda Accord Touring. To the chagrin of the engineers at Honda, all the parts were taken from two of only six hand-assembled pre-production models of the Accord. The advertisement depicted a single cog which sets off a chain of events that ends with the Honda Accord moving and Garrison Keillor speaking the tagline, \"Isn't it nice when things just... work?\" It took 606 takes to get it perfect.[147]\n\n\nHonda has done humor marketing such as its 1985 four-page \"How to fit six Hondas in a two-car garage\" print ad[148] or \"descending so low in a parking garage, they pass stalagmites and a Gollum-like figure.\"[149]\n\n\nIn 2004, they produced the *Grrr* advert, usually immediately followed by a shortened version of the 2005 *Impossible Dream* advert. In December 2005, Honda released *The Impossible Dream* a two-minute panoramic advertisement filmed in New Zealand, Japan, and Argentina which illustrates the founder's dream to build performance vehicles. While singing the song \"Impossible Dream\", a man reaches for his racing helmet, leaves his trailer on a minibike, then rides a succession of vintage Honda vehicles: a motorcycle, then a car, then a powerboat, then goes over a waterfall only to reappear piloting a hot air balloon, with Garrison Keillor saying \"I couldn't have put it better myself\" as the song ends. The song is from the 1960s musical *Man of La Mancha*, sung by Andy Williams.\n\n\nIn 2006, Honda released its *Choir* advertisement, for the UK and the internet. This had a 60-person choir who sang the car noises as the film of the Honda Civic is shown.\n\n\nIn the mid to late 2000s in the United States, during model close-out sales for the current year before the start of the new model year, Honda's advertising has had an animated character known simply as Mr. Opportunity, voiced by Rob Paulsen. The casual-looking man talked about various deals offered by Honda and ended with the phrase \"I'm Mr. Opportunity, and I'm knockin'\", followed by him \"knocking\" on the television screen or \"thumping\" the speaker at the end of radio ads. In addition, commercials for Honda's international hatchback, the Jazz, are parodies of well-known pop culture images such as *Tetris* and Thomas the Tank Engine.\n\n\nIn late 2006, Honda released an ad with ASIMO exploring a museum, looking at the exhibits with almost childlike wonderment (spreading out its arms in the aerospace exhibit, waving hello to an astronaut suit that resembles him, etc.), while Garrison Keillor ruminates on progress. It concludes with the tagline: \"More forwards please\". Honda also sponsored ITV's coverage of Formula One in the UK for 2007. However, they had announced that they would not continue in 2008 due to the sponsorship price requested by ITV being too high.\n\n\nIn May 2007, focuses on their strengths in racing and the use of the Red H badge \u2013 a symbol of what is termed as \"Hondamentalism\". The campaign highlights the lengths that Honda engineers go to in order to get the most out of an engine, whether it is for bikes, cars, powerboats \u2013 even lawnmowers. Honda released its Hondamentalism campaign. In the TV spot, Garrison Keillor says, \"An engineer once said to build something great is like swimming in honey\", while Honda engineers in white suits walk and run towards a great light, battling strong winds and flying debris, holding on to anything that will keep them from being blown away. Finally one of the engineers walks towards a red light, his hand outstretched. A web address is shown for the Hondamentalism website. The digital campaign aims to show how visitors to the site share many of the Hondamentalist characteristics.\n\n\nAt the beginning of 2008, Honda released \u2013 the *Problem Playground*. The advert outlines Honda's environmental responsibility, demonstrating a hybrid engine, more efficient solar panels, and the FCX Clarity, a hydrogen-powered car. The 90-second advert has large-scale puzzles, involving Rubik's Cubes, large shapes, and a 3-dimensional puzzle. On 29 May 2008, Honda, in partnership with Channel 4, broadcast a live advertisement. It showed skydivers jumping from an airplane over Spain and forming the letters H, O, N, D, and A in mid-air. This live advertisement is generally agreed to be the first of its kind on British television. The ad lasted three minutes.[150]\n\n\nIn 2009, American Honda released the *Dream the Impossible* documentary series, a collection of 5- to 8-minute web vignettes that focus on the core philosophies of Honda. Current short films include *Failure: The Secret to Success*, *Kick Out the Ladder* and *Mobility 2088*. They have Honda employees as well as Danica Patrick, Christopher Guest, Ben Bova, Chee Pearlman, Joe Johnston and Orson Scott Card. The film series plays at dreams.honda.com. In the UK, national television ads feature voice-overs from American radio host Garrison Keillor, while in the US the voice of Honda commercials is actor and wrestler John Cena\n\n\nIn the North American market, Honda starts all of its commercials with a two-tone jingle since the mid-2010s.\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe late F1 driver Ayrton Senna stated that Honda probably played the most significant role in his three world championships. He had immense respect for founder, Soichiro Honda, and had a good relationship with Nobuhiko Kawamoto, the chairman of Honda at that time. Senna once called Honda \"the greatest company in the world\".[151]\n\n\nAs part of its marketing campaign, Honda is an official partner and sponsor of the National Hockey League, the Anaheim Ducks of the NHL, and the arena named after it: Honda Center. Honda also sponsors The Honda Classic golf tournament and is a sponsor of Major League Soccer. The \"Honda Player of the Year\" award is presented in United States soccer. The \"Honda Sports Award\" is given to the best female athlete in each of twelve college sports in the United States. One of the twelve Honda Sports Award winners is chosen to receive the Honda-Broderick Cup, as \"Collegiate Woman Athlete of the Year.\"\n\n\nHonda sponsored La Liga club Valencia CF starting from 2014\u201315 season.[152]\n\n\nHonda has been a presenting sponsor of the Los Angeles Marathon since 2010 in a three-year sponsorship deal, with winners of the LA Marathon receiving a free Honda Accord. Since 1989, the Honda Campus All-Star Challenge has been a quiz bowl tournament for Historically black colleges and universities.\n\n\n\n## Facilities (partial list)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Honda facilities\n\n## Sales[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Calendar year\n | Total US sales[153] |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1992\n | 768,845\n |\n| 1993\n | 716,546\n |\n| 1994\n | 788,230\n |\n| 1995\n | 794,579\n |\n| 1996\n | 843,928\n |\n| 1997\n | 940,386\n |\n| 1998\n | 1,009,600\n |\n| 1999\n | 1,076,893\n |\n| 2000\n | 1,158,860\n |\n| 2001\n | 1,207,639\n |\n| 2002\n | 1,247,834\n |\n| 2003\n | 1,349,847\n |\n| 2004\n | 1,394,398\n |\n| 2005\n | 1,462,472\n |\n| 2006\n | 1,509,358\n |\n| 2007\n | 1,551,542[154] |\n| 2008\n | 1,284,261[154] |\n| 2009\n | 1,150,784[155] |\n| 2010\n | 1,230,480[155] |\n| 2011\n | 1,147,000[156] |\n| 2012\n | 1,422,000[156] |\n| 2013\n | 1,525,312[157] |\n| 2014\n | 1,540,872\n |\n| 2015\n | 1,586,551[158] |\n| 2016\n | 1,637,942[159] |\n| 2017\n | 1,641,429[160] |\n| 2018\n | 1,604,828[161] |\n| 2019\n | 1,608,170[161] |\n\n\n## Production numbers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Calendar year\n | Global production\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2009\n | 3,012,000[162] |\n| 2010\n | 3,643,000[162] |\n| 2011\n | 2,909,000[156] |\n| 2012\n | 4,110,000[156] |\n| 2013\n | 4,112,000[163] |\n| 2014\n | 4,513,769[164] |\n| 2015\n | 4,543,838[165] |\n| 2016\n | 4,999,266[166] |\n| 2017\n | 5,236,842[167] |\n| 2018\n | 5,357,013[168] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Tokyo portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Comparison of Honda water-pumps\n* Honda advanced technology\n* Honda Airport\n* Honda Battle of the Bands\n* Honda G-Con\n* Honda F.C., football (soccer) club\n* Honda Heat, rugby union club\n* Honda in motorsport\n* Honda Performance Development\n* Honda Type R\n* List of Honda assembly plants\n* List of Honda transmissions\n* List of motor scooter manufacturers and brands\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"2022 Fiscal Year Consolidated Financial Results\" (PDF). *Honda IR*. 13 May 2022.

It was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda and incorporated on August 28, 1937. Toyota is the largest automobile manufacturer in the world, producing about 10 million vehicles per year.\n\n\nThe company was originally founded as a spinoff of Toyota Industries, a machine maker started by Sakichi Toyoda, Kiichiro's father. Both companies are now part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the world. While still a department of Toyota Industries, the company developed its first product, the Type A engine, in 1934 and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA.\n\n\nAfter World War II, Toyota benefited from Japan's alliance with the United States to learn from American automakers and other companies, which gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the small company into a leader in the industry and was the subject of many academic studies.\n\n\nIn the 1960s, Toyota took advantage of the rapidly growing Japanese economy to sell cars to a growing middle-class, leading to the development of the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling automobile. The booming economy also funded an international expansion that allowed Toyota to grow into one of the largest automakers in the world, the largest company in Japan and the ninth-largest company in the world by revenue, as of December\u00a02020[update]. Toyota was the world's first automobile manufacturer to produce more than 10 million vehicles per year, a record set in 2012, when it also reported the production of its 200 millionth vehicle. By September 2023, total production reached 300 million vehicles.[3]\n\n\nToyota was praised for being a leader in the development and sales of more fuel-efficient hybrid electric vehicles, starting with the introduction of the Toyota Prius in 1997. The company now sells more than 40 hybrid vehicle models around the world. More recently, the company has also been criticized for being slow to adopt all-electric vehicles and focusing on the development of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, like the Toyota Mirai, a technology that is costlier and has fallen far behind electric batteries.\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the Toyota Motor Corporation produces vehicles under four brands: Daihatsu, Hino, Lexus and the namesake Toyota. The company also holds a 20% stake in Subaru Corporation, a 5.1% stake in Mazda, a 4.9% stake in Suzuki, a 4.6% stake in Isuzu, a 3.8% stake in Yamaha Motor Corporation, and a 2.8% stake in Panasonic, as well as stakes in vehicle manufacturing joint-ventures in China (FAW Toyota and GAC Toyota), the Czech Republic (TPCA), India (Toyota Kirloskar) and the United States (MTMUS).\n\n\nToyota is listed on the London Stock Exchange, Nagoya Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where its stock is a component of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Core30 indices.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Toyota\n\n### 1920s\u20131930s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The mass-produced Toyoda automated loom, displayed at Toyota Museum in Aichi-gun, Japan\nIn 1924, Sakichi Toyoda invented the Toyoda Model G Automatic Loom. The principle of *jidoka*, which means the machine stops itself when a problem occurs, became later a part of the Toyota Production System. Looms were built on a small production line. In 1929, the patent for the automatic loom was sold to the British company Platt Brothers,[4] generating the starting capital for automobile development.[5]\n\n\nUnder the direction of the founder's son, Kiichiro Toyoda,[6][7] Toyoda Automatic Loom Works established an Automobile Division on September 1, 1933, and formally declared its intention to begin manufacturing automobiles on January 29, 1934.[6] A prototype Toyota Type A engine was completed on September 25, 1934, with the company's first prototype sedan, the A1, completed the following May. As Kiichiro had limited experience with automobile production, he initially focused on truck production; the company's first truck, the G1, was completed on August 25, 1935, and debuted on November 21 in Tokyo, becoming the company's first production model.[6][8] Modeled on a period Ford truck, the G1 sold for \u00a52,900, \u00a5200 cheaper than the Ford truck. A total of 379 G1 trucks were ultimately produced.[8]\n\n\nIn April 1936, Toyoda's first passenger car, the Model AA, was completed. The sales price was \u00a53,350, \u00a5400 cheaper than Ford or GM cars.[9] The company's plant at Kariya was completed in May. In July, the company filled its first export order, with four G1 trucks exported to northeastern China.[6] On September 19, 1936, the Japanese imperial government officially designated Toyota Automatic Loom Works as an automotive manufacturer.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 1936 Toyota AA, the first vehicle produced by the company while it was still a department of Toyota Industries\nVehicles were originally sold under the name \"Toyoda\" (\u30c8\u30e8\u30c0), from the family name of the company's founder, Kiichir\u014d Toyoda. In September 1936, the company ran a public competition to design a new logo. Of 27,000 entries, the winning entry was the three Japanese *katakana* letters for \"Toyoda\" in a circle. However, Rizaburo Toyoda, who had married into the family and was not born with that name, preferred \"Toyota\" (\u30c8\u30e8\u30bf) because it took eight brush strokes (a lucky number) to write in Japanese, was visually simpler (leaving off the diacritic at the end), and with a voiceless consonant instead of a voiced one (voiced consonants are considered to have a \"murky\" or \"muddy\" sound compared to voiceless consonants, which are \"clear\").\n\n\nSince *toyoda* literally means \"fertile rice paddies\", changing the name also prevented the company from being associated with old-fashioned farming. The newly formed word was trademarked and the company began trading on August 28, 1937, as the Toyota Motor Company Ltd.[6][10][11][12] Kiichiro's brother-in-law Rizaburo Toyoda was appointed the firm's first president, with Kiichiro as vice-president. Toyota Automatic Loom Works formally transferred automobile manufacturing to the new entity on September 29.[6]\n\n\nThe Japanese government supported the company by preventing foreign competitors Ford and General Motors from importing automobiles into Japan.[13]\n\n\nAt the onset of World War II, Toyota almost exclusively produced standard-sized trucks for the Japanese Army, which paid one-fifth of the price in advance and the remainder in cash upon delivery.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### 1940s[edit]\n\n\nJapan was heavily damaged in World War II and Toyota's plants, which were used for the war effort, were not spared. On August 14, 1945, one day before the surrender of Japan, Toyota's Koromo Plant was bombed by the Allied forces.[16] After the surrender, the U.S.-led occupying forces banned passenger car production in Japan. However, automakers like Toyota were allowed to begin building trucks for civilian use, in an effort to rebuild the nation's infrastructure.[17] The U.S. military also contracted with Toyota to repair its vehicles.[18]\n\n\nBy 1947, there was an emerging global Cold War between the Soviet Union and the U.S., who had been allies in World War II. U.S. priorities shifted (the \"Reverse Course\") from punishing and reforming Japan to ensuring internal political stability, rebuilding the economy, and, to an extent, remilitarizing Japan. Under these new policies, in 1949, Japanese automakers were allowed to resume passenger car production, but at the same time, a new economic stabilization program to control inflation plunged the automotive industry into a serious shortage of funds, while many truck owners defaulted on their loans.[19] Ultimately, the Bank of Japan, the central bank of the country, bailed out the company, with demands that the company institute reforms.[20]\n\n\n\n### 1950s[edit]\n\n\nAs the 1950s began, Toyota emerged from its financial crisis a smaller company, closing factories and laying off workers. At about the same time, the Korean War broke out, and being located so close to the battlefront, the U.S. Army placed an order for 1,000 trucks from Toyota. The order helped to rapidly improve the struggling company's business performance.[21] In 1950, company executives, including Kiichiro's cousin Eiji Toyoda, took a trip to the United States where they trained at the Ford Motor Company and observed the operations of dozens of U.S. manufacturers.[22] The knowledge they gained during the trip, along with what the company learned making looms, gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the company into a leader in the manufacturing industry.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Toyopet Crown, the first vehicle fully designed and built by Toyota\nToyota started developing its first full-fledged passenger car, the Toyopet Crown, in January 1952. Prior to the Crown, Toyota had been outsourcing the design and manufacturing of auto bodies, which were then mounted on truck frames made by Toyota.[24] The project was a major test for Toyota, who would need to build bodies and develop a new chassis that would be comfortable, but still stand up to the muddy, slow, unpaved roads common in Japan at the time.[24] The project had been championed for many years by founder Kiichiro Toyoda, who died suddenly on March 27, 1952. The first prototypes were completed in June 1953 and began extensive testing, before the Crown went on sale in August 1955.[25] The car was met with positive reviews from around the world.\n\n\nAfter the introduction of the Crown, Toyota began aggressively expanding into the export market. Toyota began shipping Land Cruiser knock-down kits to Latin America in November 1955,[26] sending complete Land Cruisers to Burma (now Myanmar) and the Philippines in 1956 as part of war reparations provided by the Japanese government,[27] establishing a branch in Thailand in June 1957,[28] and shipping Land Cruisers to Australia in August 1957.[27] Toyota established a production facility in Brazil in 1958, the company's first outside of Japan.[29]\n\n\nToyota entered the United States market in July 1958, attempting to sell the Toyopet Crown. The company faced problems almost immediately, the Crown was a flop in the U.S. with buyers finding it overpriced and underpowered (because it was designed for the bad roads of Japan, not high-speed performance). In response, exports of the Crown to the United States were suspended in December 1960.[30]\n\n\nAfter Kiichiro's death, his cousin Eiji Toyoda led the company for the two decades. Eiji helped establish the company's first plant independent from the Loom Works plant.[31]\n\n\n\n### 1960s\u20131970s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toyota 2000GT (1967\u20131969)\nAt the start of the 1960s, the Japanese economy was booming, a period that came to be known as the Japanese economic miracle. As the economy grew, so did the income of everyday people, who now could afford to purchase a vehicle. At the same time, the Japanese government heavily invested in improving road infrastructure.[32] To take advantage of the moment, Toyota and other automakers started offering affordable economy cars like the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling automobile.[33][34]\n\n\nToyota also found success in the United States in 1965 with the Toyota Corona compact car, which was redesigned specifically for the American market with a more powerful engine. The Corona helped increase U.S. sales of Toyota vehicles to more than 20,000 units in 1966 (a threefold increase) and helped the company become the third-best-selling import brand in the United States by 1967. Toyota's first manufacturing investment in the United States came in 1972 when the company struck a deal with Atlas Fabricators, to produce truck beds in Long Beach, in an effort to avoid the 25% \"chicken tax\" on imported light trucks. By importing the truck as an incomplete chassis cab (the truck without a bed), the vehicle only faced a 4% tariff.[35] Once in the United States, Atlas would build the truck beds and attach them to the trucks. The partnership was successful and two years later, Toyota purchased Atlas.[36]\n\n\nThe energy crisis of the 1970s was a major turning point in the American auto industry. Before the crisis, large and heavy vehicles with powerful but inefficient engines were common. But in the years after, consumers started demanding high-quality and fuel-efficient small cars. Domestic automakers, in the midst of their malaise era, struggled to build these cars profitably, but foreign automakers like Toyota were well positioned. This, along with growing anti-Japanese sentiment, prompted the U.S. Congress to consider import restrictions to protect the domestic auto industry.\n\n\nThe 1960s also saw the slight opening of the Japanese auto market to foreign companies. In an effort to strengthen Japan's auto industry ahead of the market opening, Toyota purchased stakes in other Japanese automakers. That included a stake in Hino Motors, a manufacturer of large commercial trucks, buses and diesel engines, along with a 16.8 percent stake in Daihatsu, a manufacturer of kei cars, the smallest highway-legal passenger vehicles sold in Japan.[37] That began what became a long-standing partnership between Toyota and the two companies. As part of the partnership, Daihatsu would supply kei cars for Toyota to sell and to a lesser extent Toyota would supply full-sized cars for Daihatsu to sell (a process known as rebadging), allowing both companies to sell a full line-up of vehicles.\n\n\n\n### 1980s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)By the 1980s, the Toyota Corolla was one of the most popular cars in the world and became the world's all-time best-selling automobile.\nAfter the successes of the 1970s, and the threats of import restrictions, Toyota started making additional investments in the North American market in the 1980s. In 1981, Japan agreed to voluntary export restraints, which limited the number of vehicles the nation would send to the United States each year, leading Toyota to establish assembly plants in North America. The U.S. government also closed the loophole that allowed Toyota to pay lower taxes by building truck beds in America.\n\n\nAlso in 1981, Eiji Toyoda stepped down as president and assumed the title of chairman. He was succeeded as president by Shoichiro Toyoda, the son of the company's founder.[31] Within months, Shoichiro started to merge Toyota's sales and production organizations, and in 1982 the combined companies became the Toyota Motor Corporation. The two groups were described as \"oil and water\" and it took years of leadership from Shoichiro to successfully combine them into one organization.[38]\n\n\nEfforts to open a Toyota assembly plant in the United States started in 1980, with the company proposing a joint-venture with the Ford Motor Company. Those talks broke down in July 1981.[39] Eventually in 1984, the company struck a deal with General Motors (GM) to establish a joint-venture vehicle manufacturing plant called NUMMI (New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc.) in Fremont, California.[40] GM saw the joint venture as a way to get access to a quality small car and an opportunity to learn about The Toyota Way and the Toyota Production System. For Toyota, the factory gave the company its first manufacturing base in North America allowing it to avoid any future tariffs on imported vehicles and saw GM as a partner who could show them how to navigate the American labor environment. The plant would be led by Tatsuro Toyoda, the younger brother of company president Shoichiro Toyoda.[41] The first Toyota assembled in America, a white Corolla, rolled off the line at NUMMI on October 7, 1986.[42]\n\n\nToyota received its first Japanese Quality Control Award at the start of the 1980s and began participating in a wide variety of motorsports. Conservative Toyota held on to rear-wheel-drive designs for longer than most; while a clear first in overall production they were only third in production of front-wheel-drive cars in 1983, behind Nissan and Honda. In part due to this, Nissan's Sunny managed to squeeze by the Corolla in numbers built that year.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Lexus LS 400 went on sale in May 1989 and was seen as being largely responsible for the successful launch of Lexus.\nBefore the decade was out, Toyota introduced Lexus, a new division that was formed to market and service luxury vehicles in international markets. Prior to the debut of Lexus, Toyota's two existing flagship models, the Crown and Century, both catered exclusively for the Japanese market and had little global appeal that could compete with international luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar. The company had been developing the brand and vehicles in secret since August 1983, at a cost of over US$1 billion.[44][45] The LS 400 flagship full-size sedan debuted in 1989 to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque.\n\n\n\n### 1990s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Toyota Supra (JZA80) is one of the most recognized Japanese sports cars.\n![](image)Toyota Prius, first generation (NHW10 1997\u20132000)\nIn the 1990s, Toyota began to branch out from producing mostly compact cars by adding many larger and more luxurious vehicles to its lineup, including a full-sized pickup, the T100 (and later the Tundra), several lines of SUVs, a sport version of the Camry, known as the Camry Solara. They would also launch newer iterations of their sports cars, namely the MR2, Celica, and Supra during this era.\n\n\nDecember 1997 saw the introduction of the first-generation Toyota Prius, the first mass-produced gasoline-electric hybrid car.[46] The vehicle would be produced exclusively for the Japanese market for the first two years.\n\n\nWith a major presence in Europe, due to the success of Toyota Team Europe in motorsport, the corporation decided to set up Toyota Motor Europe Marketing and Engineering, TMME, to help market vehicles in the continent. Two years later, Toyota set up a base in the United Kingdom, TMUK, as the company's cars had become very popular among British drivers. Bases in Indiana, Virginia, and Tianjin were also set up.\n\n\nToyota also increased its ownership of Daihatsu during this period. In 1995, Toyota increased its shareholding in the company to 33.4 percent, giving Toyota the ability to veto shareholder resolutions at the annual meeting.[37] In 1998, Toyota increased its holding in the company to 51.2 percent, becoming the majority shareholder.[47]\n\n\nOn September 29, 1999, the company decided to list itself on the New York and London Stock Exchanges.\n\n\nThe later half of the 1990s would also see the Toyoda brothers step back from the company their father had founded. In 1992, Shoichiro Toyoda would shift to become chairman, allowing his brother Tatsuro to become president, a job he held until his retirement in 1995.[41] Shoichiro would step down as chairman in 1999. Both would retain honorary advisory roles in the company. Hiroshi Okuda would lead the company as president from 1995 until 1999 when he became chairman and the President's office would be filled by Fujio Cho.\n\n\n\n### 2000s[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2000, exports began of the Prius.[46] In 2001, Toyota acquired its long time partner, truck and bus manufacturer Hino Motors. In 2002, Toyota entered Formula One competition and established a manufacturing joint venture in France with French automakers Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot. A youth-oriented marque for North America, Scion, was introduced in 2003. Toyota ranked eighth on Forbes 2000 list of the world's leading companies for the year 2005.[48] Also in 2005, Fujio Cho would shift to become chairman of Toyota and would be replaced as president by Katsuaki Watanabe.\n\n\nIn 2007, Toyota released an update of its full-sized truck, the Tundra, produced in two American factories, one in Texas and one in Indiana. *Motor Trend* named the 2007 Toyota Camry \"Car of the Year\" for 2007. It also began the construction of two new factories, one in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, and the other in Blue Springs, Mississippi, USA.\n\n\nThe company was number one in global automobile sales for the first quarter of 2008.[49]\n\n\nToyota was hit by the global financial crisis of 2008 as it was forced in December 2008 to forecast its first annual loss in 70 years.[50] In January 2009, it announced the closure of all of its Japanese plants for 11 days to reduce output and stocks of unsold vehicles.[51]\n\n\nIn October 2009, Toyota announced that they were establishing an office in South Korea and launched the Camry sedan, Camry hybrid, Prius and the RAV4 during the launching event at the Grand Hyatt Seoul.[52]\n\n\nBetween 2009 and 2011, Toyota conducted recalls of millions of vehicles after reports that several drivers experienced unintended acceleration. The recalls were to prevent a front driver's side floor mat from sliding into the foot pedal well, causing the pedals to become trapped and to correct the possible mechanical sticking of the accelerator pedal.[53] At least 37 were killed in crashes allegedly related to unintended acceleration,[54] approximately 9 million cars and trucks were recalled,[55] Toyota was sued for personal injuries and wrongful deaths,[56] paid US$1 billion to settle a class action lawsuit to compensate owners for lost resale value,[57] and paid a US$1.2 billion criminal penalty to the United States government over accusations that it had intentionally hid information about safety defects and had made deceptive statements to protect its brand image.[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)Akio Toyoda was named President of Toyota in 2009, pictured in 2011.\nAmid the unintended acceleration scandal, Katsuaki Watanabe stepped down as company president. He was replaced by Akio Toyoda, grandson of company founder Kiichiro Toyoda, on June 23, 2009. Akio had been with Toyota since 1984, working jobs in production, marketing and product development, and took a seat on the board of directors in 2000.[59] Akio's promotion by the board marked the return of a member of the Toyoda family to the top leadership role for the first time since 1999.[60]\n\n\n\n### 2010s[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Toyota, along with large parts of the Japanese automotive industry, suffered from a series of natural disasters. The 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami led to a severe disruption of the supplier base and a drop in production and exports.[61][62] Severe flooding during the 2011 monsoon season in Thailand affected Japanese automakers that had chosen Thailand as a production base. Toyota is estimated to have lost production of 150,000 units to the tsunami and production of 240,000 units to the floods.\n\n\nOn February 10, 2014, it was announced that Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia by the end of 2017.[63][64] The decision was based on the unfavourable Australian dollar making exports not viable, the high cost of local manufacture, and the high amount of competition in a relatively small local market.[64] The company planned to consolidate its corporate functions in Melbourne by the end of 2017, and retain its Altona plant for other functions. The workforce is expected to be reduced from 3,900 to 1,300.[65] Both Ford Motor Company and General Motors (Holden) followed suit, ending Australian production in 2016 and 2017 respectively.\n\n\nThe automaker narrowly topped global sales for the first half of 2014, selling 5.1 million vehicles in the six months ending June 30, 2014, an increase of 3.8% on the same period the previous year. Volkswagen AG, which recorded sales of 5.07 million vehicles, was close behind.[66]\n\n\nIn August 2014, Toyota announced it would be cutting its spare-parts prices in China by up to 35%. The company admitted the move was in response to a probe foreshadowed earlier in the month by China's National Development and Reform Commission of Toyota's Lexus spare-parts policies, as part of an industry-wide investigation into what the Chinese regulator considers exorbitantly high prices being charged by automakers for spare parts and after-sales servicing.[67]\n\n\nIn November 2015, the company announced that it would invest US$1 billion over the next 5 years into artificial intelligence and robotics research.[68] In 2016, Toyota invested in Uber.[69] In 2020, a corporate governance report showed that Toyota owns 10.25 million shares of Uber, which was valued at $292.46 million as of March 30, 2020. According to Reuters, this was roughly 0.6 per cent of Uber's outstanding shares.[70]\n\n\nIn March 2016, Toyota partnered with Yanmar to create a fiberglass pleasure boat using Yanmar outboard marine diesel engines or Toyota inboard engines.[71]\n\n\nIn August 2016, the company purchased all remaining assets of Daihatsu, making the manufacturer of small cars a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota.[72]\n\n\nOn August 27, 2018, Toyota announced an investment of US$500 million in Uber's autonomous cars.[73]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Toyota backed the Trump Administration's proposal that federal authority should override California's ability to set its own emissions standards for automobiles. The proposal would reduce California's 2025 fuel efficiency standard from about 54.5 to 37 MPG.[74] This shift by Toyota away from fuel efficiency damaged the company's reputation as a green brand.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### 2020s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toyota Showroom in Shenzhen, China\nBy 2020, Toyota reclaimed its position as the largest automaker in the world, surpassing Volkswagen.[77] It sold 9.528 million vehicles globally despite an 11.3% drop in sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[77] This includes subsidiaries Daihatsu and Hino Motors.[77][78]\n\n\nOn April 2, 2020, BYD and Toyota announced a new joint venture between the two companies called BYD Toyota EV Technology Co., Ltd., with the aim of \"developing BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) that appeal to customers.\"[79]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Toyota, its subsidiary Hino, and Isuzu announced the creation of a strategic partnership between the three companies. Toyota acquired a 4.6% stake in Isuzu while the latter plans to acquire Toyota shares for an equivalent value. The three companies said they would form a new joint venture by April called Commercial Japan Partnership Technologies Corporation with the aim of developing fuel cell and electric light trucks. Toyota would own an 80% stake in the venture while Hino and Isuzu would own 10% each.[80]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Toyota said that it will buy Lyft's self-driving technology unit for $550 million and merge it with its newly created Woven Planet Holdings automation division.[81]\n\n\nIn June 2021, the company defended its donations to the United States Republican lawmakers after they voted against certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election, saying it did not believe it was \"appropriate to judge members of Congress\" for that one vote.[82] A report by Axios found that Toyota was the top donor to 2020 election objectors, by a substantial margin.[83] The company then reversed course in July 2021 and ceased donations to election objectors, releasing a statement saying it understood that its PAC's donations to those objectors, which far outpaced those of any other company, \"troubled some stakeholders.\"[84] Toyota resumed donations after a six-month pause.[85]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Toyota announced that it would invest \u00a58,000,000,000,000 ($70 billion at 2021 exchange rate) in electric vehicles by 2030, launch 30 EV models worldwide by that year, and set a sales target of 3.5 million electric vehicles in 2030.[86]\n\n\nToyota will increase its software engineer intake to around 40% to 50% of all technical hires from the second quarter of 2022, the move plans to address a transformation to so-called CASE \u2014 connected, autonomous, shared and electric \u2014 technologies in an environment of intensifying global competition.[87]\n\n\nIn 2021, Toyota told some of its suppliers to increase their semiconductor inventory levels from the conventional three months to five months in response to the COVID-19 chip shortage.[88] The \"just-in-time\" supply chain in which parts are only delivered when necessary, had already been revised after the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami in Japan, lifting inventories across the entire procurement network.[88] The time it takes Toyota to turn over its inventory increased by around 40% during the past ten years, to 36.36 days as of March\u00a02021[update].[88]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Toyota recalled 2,700 of its first mass-produced all-electric vehicles due to worries that their wheels could fall off during driving. It was discovered that the bolts on the bZ4X's wheels could loosen up to the point where the wheel simply detaches from the car, causing a loss of control over the vehicle and possible accident.[89]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Toyota pledged up to $5.6 billion towards production of electric vehicle battery production and announced an increase in investment in its plant near Greensboro, North Carolina.[90][91] Also in 2022, Toyota managed to maintain its position as the world's best-selling automaker for the third year in a row.[92][93]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Toyota CEO and President Akio Toyoda announced that he was stepping down and passing the position on to Koji Sato. Akio is the great-grandson of company founder Rizaburo Toyoda. Sato had previously run Lexus, Toyota's luxury car brand. The change is set to take effect on April 1, 2023.[94][95]\n\n\n\n## Board of directors[edit]\n\n\n* Chairman: Akio Toyoda (since April 2023)\n* Vice chairman: Shigeru Hayakawa\n* President & CEO: Koji Sato (since April 2023)\n* Members:\n\t+ Takeshi Uchiyamada\n\t+ James Kuffner\n\t+ Kenta Kon\n\t+ Masahiko Maeda\n\t+ Ikuro Sugawara\n\t+ Sir Philip Craven\n\t+ Teiko Kudo\n\n\n### List of former chairmen[edit]\n\n\n*In 1950, Toyota was split into Toyota Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Sales Co.

Toyota crossovers range from the subcompact Yaris Cross and C-HR, compact Corolla Cross and RAV4, to midsize Harrier/Venza and Kluger/Highlander.[107] Other crossovers include the Raize, Urban Cruiser.[108] Toyota SUVs range from the midsize Fortuner to full-size Land Cruiser.[107] Other SUVs include the Rush, Prado, FJ Cruiser, 4Runner, and Sequoia.[107]\n\n\n\n\n### Pickup trucks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nToyota Hilux (global)\n![](image)\nToyota Tacoma (US/Canada)\n\nToyota first entered the pickup truck market in 1947 with the SB that was only sold in Japan and limited Asian markets. It was followed in 1954 by the RK (renamed in 1959 as the Stout) and in 1968 by the compact Hilux. With continued refinement, the Hilux (simply known as the Pickup in some markets) became famous for being extremely durable and reliable.[109] Extended cab and crew cab versions were eventually added, and Toyota continues to produce them today under various names depending on the market in various cab lengths, with gasoline or diesel engines, and 2WD and 4WD versions.\n\n\nIn North America, the Hilux became a major model for the company, leading the company to launch the Tacoma in 1995.[110] The Tacoma was based on the Hilux, but with a design intended to better suit the needs of North American consumers who often use pickup trucks as personal vehicles. The design was a success and the Tacoma became the best-selling compact pickup in North America.\n\n\nAfter the success of its compact Hilux pickups in North America, Toyota decided to enter the full-size pickup market, which was traditionally dominated by domestic automakers. The company introduced the T100 for the 1993 US model year. The T100 had a full-size 8-foot (2.4\u00a0m) long bed, but suspension and engine characteristics were similar to that of a compact pickup. Sales were disappointing and the T100 was criticized for having a small V6 engine (especially compared to the V8 engines common in American full-size trucks), lacking an extended-cab version, being too small, and too expensive (because of the 25% tariff on imported trucks).[111] In 1995, Toyota added the more powerful V6 engine from the new Tacoma to the T100 and also added an extended cab version.[111] In 1999, Toyota replaced the T100 with the larger Tundra, which would be built in the US with a V8 engine and styling that more closely matched other American full-size trucks.[112]\n\n\n\n### Luxury vehicles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lexus\n\n![](image)Toyota Crown RS (fifteenth generation, S220; 2018)\nIn the Japanese home market, Toyota has two flagship models: the Crown premium sedan and the Century limousine.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Toyota wanted to expand its luxury car offerings but realized that existing Japanese-market flagship models had little global appeal and could not compete with established brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar or the Acura and Infiniti marquees being launched by Japanese competitors.\n\n\nBefore the decade was out, Toyota introduced Lexus, a new division that was formed to market and service luxury vehicles in markets outside of Japan. The company developed the brand and its vehicles in secret since August 1983, at a cost of over US$1 billion.[44][45] The Lexus LS flagship full-size sedan debuted in 1989 to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque. Subsequently, the division added sedan, coup\u00e9, convertible and SUV models.\n\n\nThe Lexus brand was introduced to the Japanese market in 2005, previously all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 to 2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque.\n\n\n\n### Buses[edit]\n\n\nThe Toyota Coaster is a minibus introduced in 1969 that seats 17 passengers. The Coaster is widely used in Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Australia, but also in the developing world for minibus operators in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, the Caribbean, and South America to operate as public transportation.\n\n\n\n## Technology[edit]\n\n\n### Hybrid electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Hybrid Synergy Drive and Toyota Prius\n\n![](image)The Toyota Prius, flagship of Toyota's hybrid technology, is the world's best-selling hybrid car.\nToyota is the world's leader in sales of hybrid electric vehicles, one of the largest companies to encourage the mass-market adoption of hybrid vehicles across the globe, and the first to commercially mass-produce and sell such vehicles, with the introduction of the Toyota Prius in 1997.[113][114] The company's series hybrid technology is called Hybrid Synergy Drive, and it was later applied to many vehicles in Toyota's product lineup, starting first with the Camry and the technology was also brought to the luxury Lexus division.\n\n\nAs of January\u00a02020[update], Toyota Motor Corporation sells 44 Toyota and Lexus hybrid passenger car models in over 90 countries and regions around the world, and the carmaker has sold over 15 million hybrid vehicles since 1997.[115] The Prius family is the world's top-selling hybrid gasoline-electric vehicle nameplate with almost 4 million units sold worldwide as of January 2017.[115]\n\n\n\n### Hydrogen fuel-cell[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Toyota Mirai\n\n![](image)The Toyota Mirai fuel-cell vehicle\n![](image)The Toyota SORA fuel-cell bus\nIn 2002, Toyota began a development and demonstration program to test the Toyota FCHV, a hybrid hydrogen fuel cell vehicle based on the Toyota Highlander production SUV. Toyota also built a FCHV bus based on the Hino Blue Ribbon City low-floor bus.[116][117] Toyota has built several prototypes/concepts of the FCHV since 1997, including the Toyota FCHV-1, FCHV-2, FCHV-3, FCHV-4, and Toyota FCHV-adv. The Toyota FCV-R fuel cell concept car was unveiled at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show. The FCV-R sedan seats four and has a fuel cell stack including a 70 MPa high-pressure hydrogen tank, which can deliver a range of 435\u00a0mi (700\u00a0km) under the Japanese JC08 test cycle. Toyota said the car was planned for launch in about 2015.[118]\n\n\nIn August 2012, Toyota announced its plans to start retail sales of a hydrogen fuel-cell sedan in California in 2015. Toyota expects to become a leader in this technology.[119] The prototype of its first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle will be exhibited at the November 2013 Tokyo Motor Show, and in the United States at the January 2014 Consumer Electronics Show.[120]\n\n\nToyota's first hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles to be sold commercially, the Toyota Mirai (Japanese for \"future\"), was unveiled at the November 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show.[121] In January 2015, it was announced that production of the Mirai fuel cell vehicle would increase from 700 units in 2015 to approximately 2,000 in 2016 and 3,000 in 2017.[122] Sales in Japan began on December 15, 2014, at a price of \u00a56,700,000 (~US$57,400). The Japanese government plans to support the commercialization of fuel-cell vehicles with a subsidy of \u00a52,000,000 (~US$19,600).[123] Retail sales in the U.S. began in August 2015 at a price of US$57,500 before any government incentives. Initially, the Mirai will only be available in California.[124][125] The market release in Europe is slated for September 2015, and initially will be available only in the UK, Germany, and Denmark, followed by other countries in 2017. Pricing in Germany starts at \u20ac60,000 (~US$75,140) plus VAT (\u20ac78,540).[126]\n\n\nIn 2015, Toyota released 5,600 patents for free use until 2020, hoping to promote global development of hydrogen fuel-cell technology.[127][128][129][130]\n\n\nSince the mid-2010s, Toyota has increased its focus on building hydrogen powered trucks. It first showcased a heavy-duty semi-truck tractor in 2017[131] and in 2023 announced a kit to convert existing diesel-powered truck engines to use hydrogen.[132] In late 2022, the company signed an \u00a311.3 million government deal with the UK's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to help it develop a hydrogen-powered Hilux pickup truck.[133]\n\n\n\n### Plug-in hybrids[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid and Toyota RAV4 Prime\n\n![](image)Second-generation Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid\nThe Prius Plug-In Hybrid Concept was exhibited in late 2009, and shortly after, a global demonstration program involving 600 pre-production test cars began. The vehicles were leased to fleet and government customers, and were equipped with data tracking devices to allow Toyota to monitor the car's performance. The vehicle was based on the third-generation Toyota Prius and outfitted with two additional lithium-ion batteries beyond the normal hybrid battery pack.[134] The additional batteries were used to operate the car with minimal use of the internal combustion engine until they are depleted, at which point they are disengaged from the system. They are not used in tandem with the main hybrid battery pack.\n\n\nAfter the conclusion of the demonstration program, the production version of the Prius Plug-in Hybrid was unveiled in September 2011. The production Prius Plug-in had a maximum electric-only speed of 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the vehicle as having an range of 18 kilometres (11\u00a0mi) in blended mode (mostly electric, but supplemented by the internal combustion engine).[135] Toyota ultimately only did a small production run with 75,400 vehicles being produced between 2012 and 2016.[136]\n\n\nThe second-generation Prius Plug-in (renamed the Prius Prime in the US) was unveiled in early 2016.[137] Unlike the prior generation, where the plug-in battery was limited by being added to the existing Prius, this model would be developed in tandem with the fourth-generation Prius, allowing Toyota to increase the range to 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi), with a top speed of 135\u00a0km/h (84\u00a0mph), without needing the assistance of the internal combustion engine.[138] The second-generation Prius Plug-in went on sale starting in late 2016, with Toyota expecting to sell up to 60,000 units globally per year.[139]\n\n\nA second plug-in hybrid model, the Toyota RAV4 PHV (RAV4 Prime in the US) was unveiled in December 2019. The vehicle has an EPA-estimated 68 kilometres (42\u00a0mi) of all-electric range and generates a combined 225 kilowatts (302\u00a0hp), enabling it to be Toyota's second fastest car currently in production (behind the GR Supra 3.0 sports car).[140] Sales started in mid-2020.\n\n\n\n### Battery electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toyota bZ4X\nToyota has been criticized for being slow to add battery electric vehicles to its lineup. It has been publicly skeptical of battery-electric vehicles, instead focusing on hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles,[141] and actively lobbying against government mandates to transition to zero-emissions vehicles.[142]\n\n\nAs of 2023[update], only a small only a small proportion of the vehicles the company sells are of battery electric, which has prompted criticism by some environmental and public interest groups.[143][144] The company plans to increase its sales of electric vehicles to 3.5 million per year by 2030.[86] However, the company has stated that it believes other technologies, including hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, will continue to play a role in the future of the company.[145][146]\n\n\nToyota created the first generation Toyota RAV4 EV (Electric Vehicle) as a compliance car after the California Air Resources Board mandated in the late 1990s that every automaker offer a zero-emissions vehicle.[147][148] A total of 1,484 were leased and/or sold in California from 1997 to 2003, when the state dropped its mandate under legal pressure from lawsuits filed by automakers.[149]\n\n\nA second generation of the RAV4 EV was developed in 2010 as part of a deal with Tesla. The production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from Tesla.[150][151] The RAV4 EV had a limited production run with just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014.[152][153] According to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was \"marred by clashes between engineers\".[154]\n\n\nStarting in 2009, Toyota introduced three generations of concept electric vehicles called the FT-EV built on a modified Toyota iQ platform. In late-2012, the company announced plans build a production version of the car called the Toyota iQ EV (Scion iQ EV in the US, Toyota eQ in Japan),[155] but ultimately production was cut back to 100 cars for special fleet use in Japan and the U.S. only.[141]\n\n\nIn late 2012, Toyota announced that it would back away from fully electric vehicles, after producing less than 5,000. At the time, the company's vice chairman, Takeshi Uchiyamada, said: \"*The current capabilities of electric vehicles do not meet society's needs, whether it may be the distance the cars can run, or the costs, or how it takes a long time to charge*.\"\n\n\nA shift in Toyota's formerly battery-agnostic posture could be seen as early as 2016, when Toyota's CFO Takahiko Ijichi \u201csent a strong signal that Toyota soon plans to jump on the battery bandwagon and make electric cars despite expressing skeptical views about their range and charging times,\u201d as the Wall Street Journal wrote.[156] Toyota said it would make and sell battery-electric vehicles if and where regulations and markets demand.\n\n\nA year later, Toyota outlined its electric-vehicle plans for between 2020 and 2030 to the press in Tokyo, saying it would introduce \"more than 10\" battery-electric vehicles worldwide by the early 2020s, beginning in China, and later in Japan, Europe, the US and India.[157]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Toyota introduced the C-HR EV, its first mass-produced pure electric model in China along with an identical twin called the IZOA EV.[158] It went on sale in April 2020 and May 2020 respectively. Nikkei reported in October 2020 that Toyota had only sold less than 2,000 units in the first eight months of the year.[159]\n\n\nToyota introduced the C+pod in late 2020, a 2-seater kei car with an estimated range of 100 kilometres (62\u00a0mi) and a top speed of 60 kilometres per hour (37\u00a0mph).[160][161]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda stated that electric cars are excessively \"hyped\" and that, in Japan, they would not necessarily reduce carbon dioxide emissions since electricity is mostly generated by burning coal and natural gas in the country. He also said that the infrastructure needed for Japan to switch fully to EVs would cost between $135 billion and $358 billion and switching only to EVs would cost millions of jobs and make cars less affordable.[162]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Toyota revealed the bZ4X, an electric crossover SUV that will be the first vehicle built on a dedicated electric platform called e-TNGA when it goes on sale in mid-2022.[163] It is the first model of the bZ (\"beyond Zero\") series of battery electric vehicles.[164] The company has also stated that there will be seven \"bZ\" models to be launched globally out of 15 BEV models by 2025.[165]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Transport & Environment ranked Toyota as the least ready OEM to transition to battery electric vehicles by 2030, stating: \"Toyota has not set a target for 2030 and it plans to produce just 10% BEVs in 2025. It is expected to rely on polluting hybrid technologies.\"[166]\n\n\n\n![](image)Akio Toyoda shows prototypes of 15 BEVs during Toyota's briefing on BEV strategies in December 2021.\nIn December 2021, Toyota announced in Tokyo plans for 30 battery-electric models by 2030, to sell 3.5 million BEVs per year by that date, and that its premium-brand Lexus will be 100% battery-operated by 2030 in North America, Europe, and China. The company announced investments of $70 billion into the company's electrification.[167]\n\n\nIn a session in parallel with the G-7 Meeting 2023 May, Akio Toyoda said that battery electric vehicles are not solely the future, instead offering a mix of battery electric, internal combustion engine-equipped and hydrogen cars.[144]\n\n\nToyota has been developing solid-state batteries in partnership with Panasonic, in which the company has more than a thousand patents covering solid-state batteries by late 2020.[168] The technology has been implemented on the Toyota LQ concept. Toyota hopes the technology could increase efficiency of battery electric vehicles by 30 percent, which in turn would reduce battery costs by the same amount.[168]\n\n\n\n### Autonomous vehicles[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Woven by Toyota, Inc.\n\n![](image)Toyota e-Palette\nToyota has is also regarded as lagging when it comes to developing smart car technology.[169] Although the company unveiled its first self-driving test vehicle in 2017, and has been developing its own self-driving technology named \"Chauffeur\" (intended for full self-driving) and \"Guardian\" (a driver assist system), neither of these has been introduced into any production vehicles.[170]\n\n\nThe company had set up a large research and development operation by 2018, spending almost US$4 billion to start an autonomous vehicle research institute in California's Silicon Valley[169] and another \u00a5300 billion on a similar research institute in Tokyo that would partner with fellow Toyota Group companies and automotive suppliers Aisin Seiki and Denso.[171][172]\n\n\nToyota has also been collaborating with autonomous vehicle technology developers and, in some cases, purchasing the companies. Toyota has acquired the autonomous vehicle division of ride-hailing service Lyft for $550 million,[173] invested a total of US$1 billion in competing ride-hailing service Uber's self-driving vehicle division,[174][175] invested $400 million in autonomous vehicle technology company Pony.ai,[176] and announced a partnership with Chinese electronics e-commerce company Cogobuy to build a \"Smart Car Ecosystem.\"[177]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Toyota showcased the 20-passenger \"e-Palette\" shared autonomous vehicle, which was used at the 2021 Tokyo Olympic Games.[178][179] Toyota has announced it intends to have the vehicle available for commercial applications before 2025.[180]\n\n\nSince February 2021, Toyota has been building the \"Woven City\" which it calls a \"175-acre high tech, sensor-laden metropolis\" at the foot of Mount Fuji. When completed in 2024, the Woven City will be used to run tests on autonomous vehicles for deliveries, transport and mobile shops, with the city's residents participating in the living laboratory experiment.[181][182]\n\n\n\n## Motorsports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota in motorsport\n\nSee also: Toyota Gazoo Racing and Toyota Racing Development\n\n![](image)The Toyota TS050 Hybrid that won the 2018 24 Hours of Le Mans, preserved with dirt from the race\nToyota has been involved in many global motorsports series, providing vehicles, engines and other auto parts under both the Toyota and Lexus brands.\n\n\nToyota Gazoo Racing (GR) is Toyota's performance brand that is used in many of the world's major motorsports contests. Toyota Gazoo Racing Europe, based in Cologne, Germany, competes in the FIA World Endurance Championship, while the Finland-based Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT participates in the FIA World Rally Championship. Toyota Gazoo Racing South Africa competes in the Dakar Rally. Between 2002 and 2009, the Toyota Racing team competed in Formula One. Toyota won the highest class of the 24 Hours of Le Mans 5 consecutive times from 2018 to 2022, competing with the Toyota TS050 Hybrid and Toyota GR010 Hybrid.\n\n\nToyota Racing Development USA (TRD USA) is responsible for participation in major motorsports contests in the United States including NASCAR, NHRA, Indy Racing League and Formula Drift.\n\n\nToyota also makes engines and other auto parts for other Japanese motorsports including Super Formula, Super GT, Formula 3, and Toyota Racing Series.\n\n\n\n## Non-automotive activities[edit]\n\n\n### Aerospace[edit]\n\n\nToyota is a minority shareholder in Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation, having invested US$67.2\u00a0million in the new venture which will produce the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, slated for first deliveries in 2017.[183] Toyota has also studied participation in the general aviation market and contracted with Scaled Composites to produce a proof of concept aircraft, the TAA-1, in 2002.[184][185]\n\n\n\n### Pleasure boats[edit]\n\n\nIn 1997, building on a previous partnership with Yamaha Marine, Toyota created \"Toyota Marine\",[186] building private ownership motorboats, currently sold only in Japan. A small network in Japan sells the luxury craft at 54 locations, called the \"Toyota Ponam\" series, and in 2017, a boat was labeled under the Lexus brand name starting May 26, 2017.[187]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Toyota Municipal Museum of Art in Aichi, sponsored by the manufacturer\nToyota supports a variety of philanthropic work in areas such as education, conservation, safety, and disaster relief.\n\n\nSome of the organizations that Toyota has worked with in the US include the American Red Cross, the Boys and Girls Club, Leaders in Environmental Action for the Future (LEAF), and the National Center for Family Literacy.[188]\n\n\nThe Toyota USA Foundation exists to support education in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.[189]\n\n\nIn addition, Toyota works with nonprofits to improve their processes and operations such as the Food Bank For New York City.[190][191]\n\n\nToyota also supports a variety of work in Japan.[192]\n\n\nThe Toyota Foundation takes a global perspective providing grants in the three areas of human and natural environments, social welfare, and education and culture.[193]\n\n\n\n### Higher education[edit]\n\n\nToyota established the Toyota Technological Institute in 1981, as Sakichi Toyoda had planned to establish a university as soon as he and Toyota became successful. Toyota Technological Institute founded the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago in 2003. Toyota is supporter of the Toyota Driving Expectations Program, Toyota Youth for Understanding Summer Exchange Scholarship Program, Toyota International Teacher Program, Toyota TAPESTRY, Toyota Community Scholars (scholarship for high school students), United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Internship Program, and Toyota Funded Scholarship.[194] It has contributed to a number of local education and scholarship programs for the University of Kentucky, Indiana, and others.[194]\n\n\n\n### Robotics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota Partner Robot\n\n![](image)Toyota trumpet-playing robot\nIn 2004, Toyota showcased its trumpet-playing robot.[195] Toyota has been developing multitask robots destined for elderly care, manufacturing, and entertainment. A specific example of Toyota's involvement in robotics for the elderly is the Brain Machine Interface. Designed for use with wheelchairs, it \"allows a person to control an electric wheelchair accurately, almost in real-time\", with his or her mind.[196] The thought controls allow the wheelchair to go left, right, and forward with a delay between thought and movement of just 125\u00a0milliseconds.[196] Toyota also played a part in the development of Kirobo, a 'robotic astronaut'.\n\n\nIn 2017, the company introduced T-HR3, a humanoid robot with the ability to be remotely controlled. The robot can copy the motions of a connected person. The 2017 version used wires for the connection but the 2018 version used 5G from a distance up to 10\u00a0km.[197][198]\n\n\n\n### Agricultural biotechnology[edit]\n\n\nToyota invests in several small start-up businesses and partnerships in biotechnology, including:\n\n\n\n* P.T. Toyota Bio Indonesia in Lampung, Indonesia\n* Australian Afforestation Pty. Ltd. in Western Australia and Southern Australia\n* Toyota Floritech Co., Ltd. in Rokkasho-Mura, Kamikita District, Aomori Prefecture\n* Sichuan Toyota Nitan Development Co., Ltd. in Sichuan, China\n* Toyota Roof Garden Corporation in Miyoshi-Cho, Aichi Prefecture\n\n\n### Sewing machine brand[edit]\n\n\nAisin, another member of the Toyota Group of companies, uses the same Toyota wordmark logo to market its home-use sewing machines. Aisin was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda after he founded the Toyota Motor Corporation. According to Aisin, he was so pleased with the first sewing machine, he decided to apply the same Toyota branding as his auto business, despite the companies being independent from each other.[199]\n\n\n\n### Carbon removal[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Carbon capture and utilization, Carbon footprint, Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, and Heterogeneous catalysis\n\nToyota Ventures, along with JetBlue Technology Ventures and Parley for the Oceans, is among the corporate investors that have invested $40 million in the Air Company, a carbon negative vodka distiller and perfume and hand sanitizer manufacturer that uses heterogeneous catalysis to convert captured carbon into ethanol.[200]\n\n\n\n### Environmental initiatives[edit]\n\n\nToyota states it is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and it has set a goal to reduce its overall carbon emissions by 90% by 2050, compared to 2010 levels.[201][202]\n\n\nThe company has invested heavily in solar energy, with a goal to install solar panels on the rooftops of all its dealerships worldwide by 2050.[203] In addition, Toyota has partnered with various renewable energy companies to promote the use of wind and solar power, including a recent partnership with ENEOS Corporation to develop hydrogen refueling stations in Japan.[204]\n\n\nToyota has launched a program called \"Global Environmental Challenge\" 2050 which is a comprehensive initiative aimed at reducing the environmental impact of Toyota's operations. The challenge includes six environmental goals that Toyota aims to achieve by 2050, including reducing carbon emissions, minimizing water usage, promoting the recycling and reuse of materials, and promoting the use of renewable energy.[205] The company has also implemented a variety of initiatives to promote sustainability across its supply chain, including efforts to reduce waste, water usage, and promote sustainable agriculture. For example, Toyota has implemented a zero-waste initiative at its manufacturing plants, aiming to send zero waste to landfills.[206]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Corrosion lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2016, Toyota agreed to pay $3.4 billion to settle allegations that roughly one-and-a-half million of its Tacoma, Tundra, and Sequoia pickup trucks and SUVs had been outfitted with frames prone to corrosion and perforation. According to court papers, the corrosion could reach levels high enough to compromise the vehicle's structural integrity.[207]\n\n\n\n### Death from overwork[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Kar\u014dshi\n\nOn February 9, 2002, Kenichi Uchino, aged 30 years, a quality control manager, collapsed then died at work.[208][209] On January 2, 2006, an unnamed chief engineer of the Camry Hybrid, aged 45 years, died from heart failure in his bed.[208]\n\n\n\n### Fines for environmental breaches[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Toyota was fined $34 million for violating the United States Clean Air Act, as 2.2 million vehicles it sold had defective smog-control computers.[210]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Toyota was fined $180 million for delays in reporting emissions-related defects to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) between 2005 and 2015.[76][211][212] The acting U.S. attorney said that the delays \"likely led to delayed or avoided emissions-related recalls\", although Toyota stated that despite the delays in reporting the issues to the EPA, it had notified customers and fixed the cars with the emissions defects.[212] At the time, this was the biggest civil penalty ever levied for violating the EPA's emission reporting requirements.[76][211]\n\n\n\n### 2009\u20132011 unintended acceleration recalls[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2009\u20132011 Toyota vehicle recalls\n\nBetween 2009 and 2011 Toyota, under pressure from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), conducted recalls of millions of vehicles after reports that several drivers experienced unintended acceleration. The first recall, in November 2009, was to prevent a front driver's side floor mat from sliding into the foot pedal well, causing the pedals to become trapped. The second recall, in January 2010, was begun after some crashes were shown not to have been caused by floor mats and may be caused by possible mechanical sticking of the accelerator pedal.[53] Worldwide, approximately 9 million cars and trucks were impacted by the recalls.[55]\n\n\nNHTSA received reports of a total of 37 deaths allegedly related to unintended acceleration, although an exact number was never verified.[54] As a result of the problems, Toyota faced nearly 100 lawsuits from the families of those killed, drivers who were injured, vehicle owners who lost resale value, and investors who saw a drop in the value of their shares. While most of the personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits were settled confidentially,[56] Toyota did spend more than US$1 billion to settle a class action lawsuit to compensate owners for lost resale value,[57] and the company agreed to pay a US$1.2 billion criminal penalty to the United States government over accusations that it had intentionally hid information about safety defects from the public and had made deceptive statements to protect its brand image. The penalty was the largest ever levied against a car company.[58]\n\n\n\n### Takata airbag recalls[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Takata airbag recalls\n\nToyota was impacted by a recall of faulty airbag inflators made by Takata. The inflators can explode, shooting metal fragments into the vehicle cabin. Millions of vehicles produced between 2000 and 2014 were impacted by the recall, with some needing multiple repairs.[213][214]\n\n\n\n### June 2010 Chinese labour strike[edit]\n\n\nOn June 21, 2010, a Chinese labor strike happened in Tianjin Toyoda Gosei Co, Tianjin. Workers demanded better wages and treatment.[215]\n\n\n\n### Extremist usage[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, U.S. officials asked Toyota how the Islamic State was in possession of so many Toyota trucks.[216] Toyota cars have also been documented to have been used by other extremist organizations such as the Taliban, Hamas, Al-shabab and Somali pirates.[217][218][219] Toyota representatives have said the company has a strict policy of to not sell vehicles to potential purchasers who may use or modify them for paramilitary or terrorist activities and that it cannot track aftermarket sales and that it has worked with the U.S Treasury to brief them on Toyota's supply chain on the Middle East.[220]\n\n\n\n### Misleading marketing[edit]\n\n\nIn its marketing, Toyota has often referred to its non-plug-in hybrid vehicles as \"self-charging hybrid\" vehicles. The use of the term has caused some criticism that this is misleading, as some consumers were led to erroneously believe that these vehicles charge their batteries on their own when the vehicles are not used.[221][222] Complaints about self-charging hybrid advertising were recorded in Ireland, although the complaints were rejected by the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland.[223] However, in 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Authority banned the adverts outright in Norway, stating: \"It is misleading to give the impression that the power to the hybrid battery is free of charge, since the electricity produced by the car has consumption of gasoline as a necessary condition.\"[224]\n\n\nElectric vehicle website IrishEVs criticised Toyota Ireland for paying University College Dublin to conduct a study of only seven examples of their hybrid cars over seven days to make a press release about the efficiency of the vehicles.[225][226] The website also criticised Toyota Ireland for using opinion polls to substantiate a claim about their CO2 emissions on Twitter.[227]\n\n\n\n### Rigging of crash test results[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2023, it was revealed that Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu had cheated by rigging some models to perform better in crash tests than actual production cars. The vehicles in question had a notch in the interior panel of the front door which avoided the possibility of the collision creating a sharp edge that could have injured an occupant when the side airbag deployed. This notch was present on the tested vehicles but not on vehicles sold to the public.[228]\n\n\nThe issue affected four models, the Toyota Yaris Ativ (also known as the Vios), Perodua Axia, Toyota Agya, and an undisclosed upcoming product. No recall was conducted over the issue.[228]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Principal headquarters building of Toyota\nToyota is headquartered in the city of Toyota,[229] which was named Koromo until 1951, when it changed its name to match the automaker. Toyota City is located in the Aichi Prefecture of Japan. The main headquarters of Toyota is located in a four-story building that has been described as \"modest\".[230] In 2013, company CEO Akio Toyoda reported that it had difficulties retaining foreign employees at the headquarters due to the lack of amenities in the city.[231]\n\n\nSurrounding the headquarters are the 14-story Toyota Technical Center and the Honsha plant (which was established in 1938). Toyota and its Toyota Group affiliates operate a total of 17 manufacturing facilities in Aichi Prefecture and a total of 32 plants in Japan.\n\n\nToyota also operates offices in Bunkyo, Tokyo, and Nakamura-ku, Nagoya.[229]\n\n\n\n\n### Worldwide presence[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Toyota manufacturing facilities\n\n\n\n| Top 10 Toyota and Lexus vehicle salesby country, 2022[232] |\n| --- |\n| Rankin Toyota\n | Location\n | Vehiclesales\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 2.108,460\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0China | 1.940,590\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 1.289,132\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0GCC | 390,294\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image)\u00a0Indonesia | 330,498\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image)\u00a0Thailand | 288,810\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image)\u00a0Australia | 238,139\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 200,205\n |\n| 9\n | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 191,653\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image)\u00a0Philippines | 174,106\n |\n\n\nOutside of Japan, as one of the world's largest automotive manufacturer by production volume, Toyota has factories in most parts of the world. The company assembles vehicles in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, the Czech Republic, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela.\n\n\nAdditionally, the company also has joint venture, licensed, or contract factories in China, France, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Taiwan, the United States, and Vietnam.\n\n\n\n#### North America[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota Motor North America\n\n![](image)The Toyota Camry is assembled in several facilities around the world including Australia, China, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia, Thailand, India, Vietnam, and the United States.\nToyota Motor North America is headquartered in Plano, Texas, and operates as a holding company for all operations of the Toyota Motor Corporation in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Toyota's operations in North America began on October 31, 1957, and the current company was established in 2017 from the consolidation of three companies: Toyota Motor North America, Inc., which controlled Toyota's corporate functions; Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. which handled marketing, sales, and distribution in the United States; and Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing North America which oversaw operations at all assembly plants in the region. While all three companies continue to exist in legal name, they operate as one company out of one headquarters campus.\n\n\nToyota has a large presence in the United States with six major assembly plants in Huntsville, Alabama, Georgetown, Kentucky, Princeton, Indiana, San Antonio, Texas, Buffalo, West Virginia, and Blue Springs, Mississippi. In 2018, Toyota and Mazda announced a joint venture plant that will produce vehicles in Huntsville, Alabama, starting in 2021.[233]\n\n\nIt has started producing larger trucks, such as the new Tundra, to go after the full-size pickup market in the United States. Toyota is also pushing hybrid electric vehicle in the US such as the Prius, Camry Hybrid, Highlander Hybrid, and various Lexus products. Currently, Toyota has no plans to offer diesel motor options in its North American products, including pickup trucks.[234]\n\n\nToyota Canada Inc., which is part of Toyota Motor North America, handles marketing, sales, and distribution in Canada. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada operates three assembly plants: two in Cambridge, Ontario and one in Woodstock, Ontario.[235] In 2006, Toyota's subsidiary Hino Motors opened a heavy duty truck plant, also in Woodstock, employing 45 people and producing 2,000 trucks annually.[236]\n\n\n\n#### Europe/Western Asia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota Motor Europe\n\n\n\n| Top 10 Toyota and Lexus vehicle productionby country, 2022[232] |\n| --- |\n| Rankin Toyota\n | Location\n | Vehicleproduction\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 2,656,009\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0China | 1,839,772\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 1,129,988\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0Thailand | 659,252\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 433,077\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image)\u00a0Indonesia | 268,150\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image)\u00a0Mexico | 267,775\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image)\u00a0France | 255,936\n |\n| 9\n | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 224,272\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image)\u00a0Turkey | 215,798\n |\n\n\nToyota Motor Europe is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, and oversees all operations of the Toyota Motor Corporation in Europe and western Asia. Toyota's operations in Europe began in 1963. Toyota has a significant presence in Europe with nine production facilities in Kol\u00edn, Czech Republic, Burnaston, England, Deeside, England, Onnaing, France, Jelcz-Laskowice, Poland, Wa\u0142brzych, Poland, Ovar, Portugal, Saint Petersburg, Russia, and Arifiye, Turkey.[237] Toyota also operates a joint venture plant with Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot in Valenciennes, France.\n\n\n\n#### Australia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota Australia\n\nIn 1963, Australia was one of the first countries to assemble Toyotas outside Japan. However, in February 2014, Toyota was the last of Australia's major automakers to announce the end of production in Australia. The closure of Toyota's Australian plant was completed on October 3, 2017, and had produced a total 3,451,155 vehicles. At its peak in October 2007, Toyota manufactured 15,000 cars a month.[238] Before Toyota, Ford and GM's Holden had announced similar moves, all citing an unfavorable currency and attendant high manufacturing costs.[239]\n\n\n\n### Financials[edit]\n\n\nToyota is publicly traded on the Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka, and Sapporo exchanges under company code TYO: 7203. In Japan, Toyota's stock is a component of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Core30 indices.\n\n\nIn addition, Toyota is foreign-listed on the New York Stock Exchange under NYSE:\u00a0TM and on the London Stock Exchange under LSE:\u00a0TYT.\n\n\nToyota has been publicly traded in Japan since 1949 and internationally since 1999.[240]\n\n\n\n## Company strategy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)New Toyota factory in Ohira, near Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan: A month after this picture was taken, the region was devastated by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. The plant was only lightly damaged, but remained closed more than a month, mainly due to lack of supplies and energy, in addition to a badly damaged Sendai port.\n### The Toyota Way[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Toyota Way\n\nThe Toyota Way is a set of principles and behaviors that underlie the company's approach to management and production (which is further defined as the Toyota Production System).\n\n\nThe company has been developing its corporate philosophy since 1948 and passing it on as implicit knowledge to new employees, but as the company expanded globally, leaders officially identified and defined the Toyota Way in 2001. Toyota summarized it under two main pillars: continuous improvement and respect for people. Under the continuous improvement pillar are three principles: challenge (form a long-term vision), kaizen (a continual improvement process), and genchi genbutsu (\"go and see\" the process to make correct decisions). Under the respect for people pillar are two principles: respect and teamwork.[241]\n\n\nIn 2004, Dr. Jeffrey Liker, a University of Michigan professor of industrial engineering, published *The Toyota Way*. In his book, Liker calls the Toyota Way \"a system designed to provide the tools for people to continually improve their work.\"[242] According to Liker, there are 14 principles of The Toyota Way that can be organized into four themes: (1) long-term philosophy, (2) the right process will produce the right results, (3) add value to the organization by developing your people, and (4) continuously solving root problems drives organizational learning. The 14 principles are further defined in the Wikipedia article on The Toyota Way.\n\n\n\n### Toyota Production System[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota Production System\n\nThe Toyota Way also helped shape the company's approach to production, where it was an early pioneer of what would be come to be known as lean manufacturing.[243] The company defines the Toyota Production System under two main pillars: just-in-time[244] (make only what is needed, only when it is needed, and only in the amount that is needed) and Jidoka[245] (automation with a human touch).\n\n\nThe origin of the Toyota Production System is in dispute, with three stories of its origin: (1) that during a 1950 trip to train with the Ford Motor Company, company executives also studied the just-in-time distribution system of the grocery store company Piggly-Wiggly,[246] (2) that they followed the writings of W. Edwards Deming,[247] and (3) they learned the principles from a WWII US government training program (Training Within Industry).[248]\n\n\nAfter developing the Toyota Production System in its own facilities, the company began teaching the system to its parts suppliers in the 1990s. Other companies were interested in the instruction, and Toyota later started offering training sessions. The company also has donated the training to non-profit groups to increase their efficiency and thus ability to serve people.\n\n\n\n### Logo and branding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Employee at the Toyota Automobile Museum explains development of Toyota name and brand.\nIn 1936, Toyota entered the passenger car market with its Model AA and held a competition to establish a new logo emphasizing speed for its new product line. After receiving 27,000 entries, one was selected that additionally resulted in a change of its moniker to \"Toyota\" from the family name \"Toyoda\", which means rice paddy. The new name was believed to sound better, and its eight-stroke count in the Japanese language was associated with wealth and good fortune. The original logo was a heavily stylized version of the katakana characters for Toyota (\u30c8\u30e8\u30bf).[249]\n\n\nAs the company started to expand internationally in the late 1950s, the katakana character logo was supplemented by various wordmarks with the English form of the company name in all capital letters, \"TOYOTA.\"[249]\n\n\nToyota introduced a worldwide logo in October 1989 to commemorate the 50th year of the company, and to differentiate it from the newly released luxury Lexus brand.[250] The logo consists of three ovals that combine to form the letter \"T\", which stands for Toyota. Toyota says that the overlapping of the two perpendicular ovals inside the larger oval represents the mutually beneficial relationship and trust between the customer and the company while the larger oval surrounding both of these inner ovals represents the \"global expansion of Toyota's technology and unlimited potential for the future\".[251][252] The new logo started appearing on all printed material, advertisements, dealer signage, and most vehicles in 1990.\n\n\nIn countries or regions using traditional Chinese characters, e.g. Hong Kong and Taiwan, Toyota is known as \"\u8c50\u7530\".[253] In countries using simplified Chinese characters (e.g. China and Singapore), Toyota is written as \"\u4e30\u7530\"[254] (pronounced as *F\u0113ngti\u00e1n* in Mandarin Chinese and *H\u0254ng Tshan* in Minnanese). These are the same characters as the founding family's name \"Toyoda\" in Japanese.\n\n\n\n![](image)Some new vehicles, like this Tacoma, still use the heritage TOYOTA wordmark.\nToyota still uses the katakana character logo as its corporate emblem in Japan, including on the headquarters building,[255] and some special edition models still use the \"TOYOTA\" wordmark on the grille as a nod to the company's heritage.[256]\n\n\nOn July 15, 2015, the company was delegated its own generic top-level domain, .toyota.[257]\n\n\n\n### Sports sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nToyota sponsors several teams and has purchased naming rights for several venues, and even competitions, including:\n\n\n\n* Toyota Alvark Tokyo, basketball team\n* Toyota Arena, Ontario, California\n* Toyota Cup\n* Toyota Center, Houston, Texas\n* Toyota Center, Kennewick, Washington\n* Toyota Field, San Antonio, Texas\n* Toyota Park, Bridgeview, Illinois\n* Toyota Sports Center, El Segundo, California\n* Toyota Stadium, Georgetown, Kentucky\n* Toyota Stadium, Frisco, Texas\n\n\nAs of 2017[update], Toyota is an official sponsor of Cricket Australia,[258] the England and Wales Cricket Board[259] and the AFL.[260] In March 2015, Toyota became a sponsor partner for the Olympic Games, in the form of supplying vehicles and communications between vehicles until 2024.[261]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* List of Toyota engines\n* List of Toyota manufacturing facilities\n* List of Toyota transmissions\n* List of Toyota vehicles\n* Nagoya Grampus, formerly the company's football club and still sponsored by them\n* Toyota model codes\n* Toyota Verblitz, the company's rugby team\n* Toyota War, a conflict between Libya and Chad which saw a heavy use of Toyota's pickup trucks.\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Toyota Global Sales and Production Secures 90 Percent Level Year-on-Year in FY2021\" (Press release).

By sales, it was the largest automaker in the United States in 2022, and was the largest in the world for 77 years before losing the top spot to Toyota in 2008.[4][5]\n\n\nGeneral Motors operates manufacturing plants in eight countries.[6] In addition to its four core brands, GM also holds interests in Chinese brands Baojun and Wuling via SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile.[2] GM further owns the BrightDrop delivery vehicle manufacturer,[7] a namesake defense vehicles division which produces military vehicles for the United States government and military,[8] the vehicle safety, security, and information services provider OnStar,[9] the auto parts company ACDelco, a namesake financial lending service, and majority ownership in the self-driving cars enterprise Cruise LLC.\n\n\nThe company traces itself to a holding company for Buick established on September 16, 1908, by William C. Durant, the largest seller of horse-drawn vehicles at the time. The first half of the 20th century saw the company grow into an automotive behemoth through acquisitions; going into the second half, the company pursued innovation and new offerings to consumers as well as collaborations with NASA to develop the earliest electric vehicles.[10][11] The current entity was established in 2009 after the General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization.[12]\n\n\nToday, General Motors remains a successful company, ranking 25th by total revenue out of all American companies on the *Fortune 500* and 50th on the *Fortune Global 500*.[13][14] The company is presently heavily pursuing electric vehicles, as GM announced plans in January 2021 to end production and sales of vehicles using internal combustion engines, including hybrid vehicles and plug-in hybrids, by 2035, as part of its plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of General Motors\n\n### Founding and consolidation[edit]\n\n\nBy 1900, William C. Durant's Durant-Dort Carriage Company of Flint, Michigan had become the largest manufacturer of horse-drawn vehicles in the United States.[16] Durant was averse to automobiles, but fellow Flint businessman James H. Whiting, owner of Flint Wagon Works, sold him the Buick Motor Company in 1904.[17] Durant formed the General Motors Company in 1908 as a holding company, with partner Charles Stewart Mott, borrowing a naming convention from General Electric.[18] GM's first acquisition was Buick, which Durant already owned, then Olds Motor Works on November 12, 1908.[19] Under Durant, GM went on to acquire Cadillac, Elmore, Welch, Cartercar, Oakland (the predecessor of Pontiac), the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company of Pontiac, Michigan, and the Reliance Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan (predecessors of GMC) in 1909.\n\n\nDurant, with the board's approval, also tried acquiring Ford Motor Company, but needed an additional $2 million.[20] Durant over-leveraged GM in making acquisitions, and was removed by the board of directors in 1910 at the order of the bankers who backed the loans to keep GM in business.[17] The action of the bankers was partially influenced by the Panic of 1910\u20131911 that followed the earlier enforcement of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. In 1911, Charles F. Kettering of Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (DELCO) and Henry M. Leland invented and patented the first electric starter in America.[21] In November 1911, Durant co-founded Chevrolet with Swiss race car driver Louis Chevrolet, who left the company in 1915 after a disagreement with Durant.[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)General Motors Company share certificate issued October 13, 1916\nGM was reincorporated in Detroit in 1916 as General Motors Corporation and became a public company via an initial public offering. By 1917, Chevrolet had become successful enough that Durant, with the backing of Samuel McLaughlin and Pierre S. du Pont, reacquired a controlling interest in GM. The same year, GM acquired Samson Tractor.[23] Chevrolet Motor Company was consolidated into GM on May 2, 1918, and the same year GM acquired United Motors, a parts supplier founded by Durant and headed by Alfred P. Sloan for $45 million, and the McLaughlin Motor Car Company, founded by R. S. McLaughlin, became General Motors of Canada Limited.[24][25][26] In 1919, GM acquired Guardian Frigerator Company, part-owned by Durant, which was renamed Frigidaire. Also in 1919, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC), which provides financing to automotive customers, was formed.[27][17]\n\n\nIn 1920, du Pont orchestrated the removal of Durant once again and replaced him with Alfred P. Sloan.[28] At a time when GM was competing heavily with Ford Motor Company, Sloan established annual model changes, making previous years' models \"dated\" and created a market for used cars.[29] He also implemented the pricing strategy used by car companies today. The pricing strategy had Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac priced from least expensive to most, respectively.[30][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nIn 1921, Thomas Midgley Jr., an engineer for GM, discovered tetraethyllead (leaded gasoline) as an antiknock agent, and GM patented the compound because ethanol could not be patented.[31] This led to the development of higher compression engines resulting in more power and efficiency. The public later realized that lead contained in the gasoline was harmful to various biological organisms including humans.[32] Evidence shows that corporate executives understood the health implications of tetraethyllead from the beginning.[33] As an engineer for GM, Midgley also developed chlorofluorocarbons, which have now been banned due to their contribution to climate change.[34]\n\n\nUnder the encouragement of GM President Alfred P. Sloan Jr., GM acquired Vauxhall Motors for $2.5 million in 1925.[35] The company also acquired an interest in the Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company the same year, and its president, John D. Hertz, joined the board of directors of GM; it acquired the remainder of the company in 1943.[17]\n\n\n\n### Growth and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nIn 1926, the company introduced the Pontiac brand and established the General Motors Group Insurance Program to provide life insurance to its employees.[17] The following year, after the success of the 1927 model of the Cadillac LaSalle designed by Harley Earl, Sloan created the \"Art and Color Section\" of GM and named Earl as its first director. Earl was the first design executive to be appointed to leadership at a major American corporation. Earl created a system of automobile design that is still practiced today.[36] At the age of 24, Bill Mitchell was recruited by Harley Earl to the design team at GM, and he was later appointed as Chief Designer of Cadillac. After Earl retired in December 1958, Mitchell took over automotive design for GM.[37] Also in 1926 the company acquired Fisher Body, its supplier of automobile bodies.[38]\n\n\nGM acquired Allison Engine Company[17][39] and began developing a 1,000 horsepower liquid-cooled aircraft engine in 1929.[17] The same year, GM acquired 80% of Opel, which at that time had a 37.5% market share in Europe, for $26 million. It acquired the remaining 20% in 1931.[35]\n\n\nIn the late-1920s, Charles Kettering embarked on a program to develop a lightweight two-stroke diesel engine for possible usage in automobiles.[40] Soon after, GM acquired Electro-Motive Company and the Winton Engine Co., and in 1941, it expanded EMC's realm to locomotive engine manufacturing.[41]\n\n\nIn 1932, GM acquired Packard Electric[17][42] (not the Packard car company, which merged with Studebaker years later). The following year, GM acquired a controlling interest in North American Aviation and merged it with the General Aviation Manufacturing Corporation.[43]\n\n\nThe GM labor force participated in the formation of the United Auto Workers labor union in 1935, and in 1936 the UAW organized the Flint Sit-Down Strike, which initially idled two key plants in Flint, Michigan, and later spread to 6 other plants including those in Janesville, Wisconsin and Fort Wayne, Indiana. In Flint, police attempted to enter the plant to arrest strikers, leading to violence; in other cities, the plants were shuttered peacefully. The strike was resolved on February 11, 1937, when GM recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for its workers and gave workers a 5% raise and permission to speak in the lunchroom.[44]\n\n\nWalter E. Jominy and A.L. Boegehold of GM invented the Jominy end-quench test for hardenability of carbon steel in 1937, a breakthrough in heat treating still in use today as ASTM A255.[45] GM established Detroit Diesel the next year.[46]\n\n\nIn 1939, the company founded Motors Insurance Corporation and entered the vehicle insurance market.[27] The same year, GM introduced the Hydramatic, the first affordable and successful automatic transmission, for the 1940 Oldsmobile.[47][48]\n\n\n\n* ![1926 Pontiac radiator logo](image)\n\n1926 Pontiac radiator logo\n* ![1928 Pontiac Series 6-28 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan](image)\n\n1928 Pontiac Series 6-28 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan\n* ![1932 Pontiac Series 402 Six 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan](image)\n\n1932 Pontiac Series 402 Six 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan\n* ![1936 Pontiac Master Six Series 6BB Coupe](image)\n\n1936 Pontiac Master Six Series 6BB Coupe\n\nDuring World War II, GM produced vast quantities of armaments, vehicles, and aircraft for the Allies of World War II. In 1940, GM's William S. Knudsen served as head of U.S. wartime production for President Franklin Roosevelt, and by 1942, all of GM's production was to support the war.[49] GM's Vauxhall Motors manufactured the Churchill tank series for the Allies, instrumental in the North African campaign.[17] However, its Opel division, based in Germany, supplied the Nazi Party with vehicles. Sloan, head of GM at the time, was an ardent opponent of the New Deal, which bolstered labor unions and public transport, and Sloan admired and supported Adolf Hitler.[50] Nazi armaments chief Albert Speer allegedly said in 1977 that Hitler \"would never have considered invading Poland\" without synthetic fuel technology provided by General Motors. GM was compensated $32 million by the U.S. government because its German factories were bombed by U.S. forces during the war.[51]\n\n\nEffective January 28, 1953, Charles Erwin Wilson, then GM president, was named by Dwight D. Eisenhower as United States Secretary of Defense.[17]\n\n\nIn December 1953, GM acquired Euclid Trucks, a manufacturer of heavy equipment for earthmoving, including dump trucks, loaders and wheel tractor-scrapers, which later spawned the Terex brand.[52][53]\n\n\n\n### Periods of innovation[edit]\n\n\nAlfred P. Sloan retired as chairman and was succeeded by Albert Bradley in April 1956.[54]\n\n\nIn 1962, GM introduced the first turbo charged engine in the world for a car in the Oldsmobile Cutlass Turbo-Jetfire.[17][55] Two years later, the company introduced its \"Mark of Excellence\" logo and trademark at the 1964 New York World's Fair. The company used the mark as their main corporate identifier until 2021.[56]\n\n\nGM released the Electrovan in 1966, the first hydrogen fuel cell car ever produced.[57] Though fuel cells have existed since the early 1800s, General Motors was the first to use a fuel cell, supplied by Union Carbide, to power the wheels of a vehicle with a budget of \"millions of dollars\".[58][59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)An advertisement for the 1969 Chevrolet Nova using the advertising slogan *\"Putting you first, keeps us first\"*\nIn the 1960s, GM was the first to use turbochargers and was an early proponent of V6 engines, but quickly lost interest as the popularity of muscle cars increased. GM demonstrated gas turbine vehicles powered by kerosene, an area of interest throughout the industry, but abandoned the alternative engine configuration due to the 1973 oil crisis.[61]\n\n\nIn partnership with Boeing, GM's Delco Defense Electronics Division designed the Lunar Roving Vehicle, which traversed the surface of the Moon, in 1971.[62][63] The following year, GM produced the first rear wheel anti-lock braking system for two models: the Toronado and Eldorado.[64]\n\n\nIn 1973, the Oldsmobile Toronado was the first retail car sold with a passenger airbag.[65][66]\n\n\nThomas Murphy became CEO of the company, succeeding Richard C. Gerstenberg in November 1974.[67][68]\n\n\nGM installed its first catalytic converters in its 1975 models.[69]\n\n\nFrom 1978 to 1985, GM pushed the benefits of diesel engines and cylinder deactivation technologies. However, it had disastrous results due to poor durability in the Oldsmobile diesels and drivability issues in the Cadillac V8-6-4 variable-cylinder engines.[70]\n\n\nGM sold Frigidaire in 1979. Although Frigidaire had between $450 million and $500 million in annual revenues, it was losing money.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)General Motors headquarters building, 1981\nRobert Lee of GM invented the Fe14Nd2B the Neodymium magnet, which was fabricated by rapid solidification, in 1984.[72] This magnet is commonly used in products like a computer hard disk. The same year, GM acquired Electronic Data Systems for $2.5 billion from Ross Perot as part of a strategy by CEO Roger Smith to derive at least 10% of its annual worldwide revenue from non-automotive sources.[73] GM also intended to have EDS handle its bookkeeping, help computerize factories, and integrate GM's computer systems. The transaction made Ross Perot the largest shareholder of GM; however, disagreements with Roger Smith led the company to buy all shares held by Ross Perot for $750 million in 1986.[74]\n\n\nIn a continuation of its diversification plans, GMAC formed GMAC Mortgage and acquired Colonial Mortgage as well as the servicing arm of Norwest Mortgage in 1985. This acquisition included an $11 billion mortgage portfolio.[75] The same year, GM acquired the Hughes Aircraft Company for $5 billion in cash and stock and merged it into Delco Electronics.[76] The following year, GM acquired 59.7% of Lotus Cars, a British producer of high-performance sports cars.[77]\n\n\nIn 1987, in conjunction with AeroVironment, GM built the Sunraycer, which won the inaugural World Solar Challenge and was a showcase of advanced technology. Much of the technology from Sunraycer found its way into the Impact prototype electric vehicle (also built by Aerovironment) and was the predecessor to the General Motors EV1.[78]\n\n\nIn 1988, GM acquired a 15% stake in AeroVironment.[79]\n\n\nIn 1989, GM acquired half of Saab Automobile's car operations for $600 million.[80]\n\n\n\n### Sales of assets[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1990, Robert Stempel became CEO of the company, succeeding Roger Smith.[81] GM cut output significantly and suffered losses that year due to the early 1990s recession.[82]\n\n\nIn 1990, GM debuted the General Motors EV1 (Impact) concept, a battery electric vehicle, at the LA Auto Show. It was the first car with zero emissions marketed in the US in over three decades. The Impact was produced as the EV1 for the 1996 model year and was available only via lease from certain dealers in California and Arizona. In 1999\u20132002, GM ceased production of the vehicles and started to not renew the leases, disappointing many people, allegedly because the program would not be profitable and would cannibalize its existing business. All of the EV1s were eventually returned to General Motors, and except for around 40 which were donated to museums with their electric powertrains deactivated, all were destroyed. The documentary film *Who Killed the Electric Car?* covered the EV1 story.[83]\n\n\nIn November 1992, John F. Smith Jr. became CEO of the company.[84]\n\n\nIn 1993, GM sold Lotus Cars to Bugatti.[85]\n\n\nIn 1996, in a return to its automotive basics, GM completed the corporate spin-off of Electronic Data Systems.[86][87]\n\n\nIn 1997, GM sold the military businesses of Hughes Aircraft Company to Raytheon Company for $9.5 billion in stock and the assumption of debt.[88][89][90][91]\n\n\nIn February 2000, Rick Wagoner was named CEO, succeeding John F. Smith Jr.[92][93] The next month, GM gave 5.1% of its common stock, worth $2.4 billion, to acquire a 20% share of Fiat.[94]\n\n\nIn December 2000, GM announced that it would begin phasing out Oldsmobile. The brand was eventually discontinued in 2004, seven years after it had become the first American car brand to turn 100.[95]\n\n\n\n* ![Chevrolet Tahoe hybrid vehicle](image)\n\nChevrolet Tahoe hybrid vehicle\n* ![Second generation Chevrolet Volt](image)\n\nSecond generation Chevrolet Volt\n* ![The Chevrolet Volt](image)\n\nThe Chevrolet Volt\n* ![The General Motors EV1, an electric car, was introduced in California in 1996.](image)\n\nThe General Motors EV1, an electric car, was introduced in California in 1996.\n\nIn May 2004, GM delivered the first full-sized pickup truck hybrid vehicles, the 1/2-ton Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra trucks.[96] These mild hybrids did not use electrical energy for propulsion, like GM's later designs. Later, the company debuted another hybrid technology, co-developed with DaimlerChrysler and BMW, in diesel-electric hybrid powertrain manufactured by Allison Transmission for transit buses.[97] Continuing to target the diesel-hybrid market, the Opel Astra diesel engine hybrid concept vehicle was rolled out in January 2005.[98] Later that year, GM sold its Electro-Motive Diesel locomotive division to private equity firms Berkshire Partners and Greenbriar Equity Group.[99][100]\n\n\nGM paid $2 billion to sever its ties with Fiat in 2005, severing ties with the company due to an increasingly contentious dispute.[101]\n\n\nGM began adding its \"Mark of Excellence\" emblem on all new vehicles produced and sold in North America in mid-2005. However, after the reorganization in 2009, the company no longer added the logo, saying that emphasis on its four core divisions would downplay the GM logo.[102][103]\n\n\nIn 2005, Edward T. Welburn was promoted to the newly created position of vice president, GM Global Design, making him the first African American to lead a global automotive design organization and the highest-ranking African American in the US motor industry at that time. On July 1, 2016, he retired from General Motors after 44 years. He was replaced by Michael Simcoe.[104][105]\n\n\nIn 2006, GM introduced a bright yellow fuel cap on its vehicles to remind drivers that cars can operate using E85 ethanol fuel.[106] They also introduced another hybrid vehicle that year, the Saturn Vue Green Line.[107]\n\n\nIn 2008, General Motors committed to engineering half of its manufacturing plants to be landfill-free by recycling or reusing waste in the manufacturing process.[108] Continuing their environmental-conscious development, GM started to offer the 2-mode hybrid system in the Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon, Cadillac Escalade, and pickup trucks.[109]\n\n\nIn late 2008, the world's largest rooftop solar power installation was installed at GM's manufacturing plant in Zaragoza. The Zaragoza solar installation has about 2,000,000 square feet (190,000\u00a0m2) of roof at the plant and contains about 85,000 solar panels. The installation was created, owned and operated by Veolia Environment and Clairvoyant Energy, which leases the rooftop area from GM.[110][111][112]\n\n\n\n### Chapter 11 bankruptcy and bailout[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization\n\nIn March 2009, after the company had received $17.4 billion in bailouts but was not effective in a turnaround, President Barack Obama forced the resignation of CEO Rick Wagoner.[113]\n\n\nGeneral Motors filed for a government-backed Chapter 11 reorganization on June 8, 2009.[114][115] On July 10, 2009, the original General Motors sold assets and some subsidiaries to an entirely new company, including the trademark \"General Motors\".[114][115] Liabilities were left with the original GM, renamed Motors Liquidation Company, freeing the companies of many liabilities and resulting in a new GM.[114][115]\n\n\nThrough the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the United States Department of the Treasury invested $49.5 billion in General Motors and recovered $39 billion when it sold its shares on December 9, 2013, resulting in a loss of $10.3 billion. The Treasury invested an additional $17.2 billion into GM's former financing company, GMAC (now Ally Financial). The shares in Ally were sold on December 18, 2014, for $19.6 billion netting the government $2.4 billion in profit, including dividends.[116][117] A study by the Center for Automotive Research found that the GM bailout saved 1.2 million jobs and preserved $34.9 billion in tax revenue.[118]\n\n\nGeneral Motors Canada was not part of the General Motors Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[119]\n\n\n\n### Post-reorganization[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2009, at the request of Steven Rattner, lead adviser to President Barack Obama on the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry, Edward Whitacre Jr., who had led a restructuring of AT&T, was appointed as chairman of General Motors.[120] Whitacre was tasked with overseeing GM's emergence from bankruptcy and downsizing its sizable number of brand marques, many of which had produced chronic losses even before the recession began. In July 2009, after 40 days of bankruptcy protection, the company emerged from the government-backed General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization.[121]\n\n\nAs mandated by its bailout agreement, GM began the process of shedding its poorest-performing brands in June 2009: Hummer, Saab, Saturn, and Pontiac. An October 2009 agreement to sell the Hummer brand to China-based Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company Ltd.[122] and a group of private investors fell through three months later, resulting in GM seeking a new suitor.[123] American company Raser Technologies, along with several others, expressed interest in buying the company, but none of the proposed acquisitions came to fruition, and in April 2010 GM said it was officially shutting down the Hummer brand.[124][125] Similarly, GM's efforts to sell its Saturn division yielded an early suitor. In June 2009, GM announced that the Saturn brand would be sold to the Penske Automotive Group.[126] The deal fell through, however, and GM declared the brand defunct in October 2010. While GM agreed to shed its underperforming Pontiac brand as part of its bailout agreement, the company explicitly opted not to sell it to another company.[127][128] The last Pontiac was built in January 2010.[129]\n\n\nGM was more successful in its attempts to sell Saab Automobile: the company closed a sale to Dutch automaker Spyker Cars in February 2010.[130] Saab continued to perform poorly under Spyker's management, however, and in 2012 the Saab division declared bankruptcy.\n\n\nIn December 2009, the \"new\" GM's board of directors asked CEO Fritz Henderson to resign, and its chairman, Ed Whitacre, was named interim CEO.[131] GM opted to appoint Whitacre as its permanent CEO the following month, though Whitacre ultimately stepped down as CEO in September 2010, relinquishing the position to fellow GM board member Daniel Akerson but agreeing to continue on as GM chairman until the end of the year. Akerson replaced him as chairman, while continuing as CEO, in January 2011.[132][133]\n\n\nIn 2010, GM introduced the Chevrolet Volt as an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV), an electric vehicle with backup generators powered by gasoline, or series plug-in hybrid.[134][135] GM delivered the first Volt in December 2010.[136] The Chevrolet Volt was a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle with back-up generators powered by gasoline (range-extended electric vehicle).[137] GM built a prototype two-seat electric vehicle with Segway Inc. An early prototype of the Personal Urban Mobility and Accessibility vehicle\u2014dubbed Project P.U.M.A. \u2013 was presented in New York at the 2009 New York International Auto Show.[138]\n\n\n\n* ![2nd generation Buick LaCrosse (2010\u20132016)[139][140]](image)\n\n2nd generation Buick LaCrosse (2010\u20132016)[139][140]\n* ![General Motors Sequel, a fuel cell-powered vehicle from GM.](image)\n\nGeneral Motors Sequel, a fuel cell-powered vehicle from GM.\n* ![E85 FlexFuel Chevrolet Impala LT 2009 (USA)](image)\n\nE85 FlexFuel Chevrolet Impala LT 2009 (USA)\n* ![The Chevrolet Bolt EV was released in late 2016.](image)\n\nThe Chevrolet Bolt EV was released in late 2016.\n\nOn January 15, 2014, Mary Barra was named chief executive officer, succeeding Daniel Akerson. Barra also joined the GM board.[141] Only three weeks later, the company announced its 2014 General Motors recall, which was due to faulty ignition switches, and was linked to at least 124 deaths. The resulting settlements with family members of those killed were estimated to cost the company $1.5 billion.[142]\n\n\nOn January 4, 2016, in its first investment in a ridesharing company, GM invested $500 million in Lyft.[143][144] The company does not directly supply Lyft drivers with vehicles, however \u2013 and has no plans to do so in the future \u2013 and Lyft ultimately partnered with Motional for production of its autonomous vehicles.\n\n\nIn March 2016, GM acquired Cruise, a San Francisco self-driving vehicle start-up, to develop self-driving cars that could be used in ride-sharing fleets.[145][146] In June 2022, Cruise received California's first Driverless Deployment Permit, allowing it to both charge fees for its service as well as offer fully autonomous rides in a major public city.[147] *The Verge* reported that the company lost $561 million in Q1 2023, but said it remains on the path to reach $1 billion in revenue by 2025 and $50 billion by 2030.[148]\n\n\nIn October 2016, GM began production of the Chevrolet Bolt EV, the first-ever mass market all-electric car with a range of more than 200 miles (320\u00a0km).[149][150] The battery pack and most drivetrain components were built by LG Corporation and assembled in GM's plant in Lake Orion, Michigan.[151] GM chose to employ the Bolt EV and similar Bolt EUV for its Cruise ride-share service.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn January 8, 2021, GM introduced a new logo alongside the tagline \"EVerybody in\", with the capitalized \"EV\" as a nod to the company's commitment to electric vehicles.[152][153] GM's new logo used negative space to create the idea of an electric plug in the \"M\" of the logo.[154]\n\n\nAt the January 2021 Consumer Electronics Show, GM launched BrightDrop, its brand for all-electric commercial vehicles.[155]\n\n\nOn January 28, 2021, GM announced that it will end production and sales of fossil-fuel vehicles (including hybrids and plug-in hybrids) by 2035 as part of its plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2040.[156]\n\n\nIn 2021, GM announced plans to establish an automotive battery and battery pack laboratory in Michigan.[157][158][159] GM will be responsible for battery management systems and power electronics, thermal management, as well as the pack assembly. An existing GM facility at Brownstown Township was chosen to be upgraded as a battery pack plant.[134] LG Chem's U.S. subsidiary, Compact Power of Troy, Michigan, has been building the prototype packs for the development vehicles and will continue to provide integration support and acting as a liaison for the program.[160]\n\n\n\n### Motorsports history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chevrolet Corvette C8.R in the IMSA SportsCar Championship\nGM participated in the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) from 2004 to 2012,[161] and has also participated in other motorsport championships, including 24 Hours of Le Mans,[162] NASCAR,[163] SCCA[164] and Supercars Championship.[165]\n\n\nGM's engines were successful in the Indy Racing League (IRL) throughout the 1990s, winning many races in the small V8 class. GM has also done much work in the development of electronics for GM auto racing. An unmodified Aurora V8 in the Aerotech captured 47 world records, including the record for speed endurance in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America. Recently, the Cadillac V-Series has entered motorsports racing.\n\n\nGM has also designed cars specifically for use in NASCAR auto racing. The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 is the only entry in the series.[166] In the past, the Pontiac Grand Prix,[167] Buick Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass, Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Malibu, Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Chevrolet Impala, and the Chevrolet SS were also used. GM has won many NASCAR Cup Series manufacturer's championships, including 40 with Chevrolet,[168] the most of any make in NASCAR history, 3 with Oldsmobile, 2 with Buick, and 1 with Pontiac. In 2021, Chevrolet became the first brand to reach 800 wins.[169]\n\n\nIn Australia, Holden cars based on the Monaro, Torana and Commodore platforms raced in the Australian Touring Car Championship until 2022. Holden won the Bathurst 1000, a record 36 times between 1968 and 2022 and the Australian Touring Car Championship 23 times.[170] From 2023, the Chevrolet Camaro will be raced.[171]\n\n\n\n### Logo evolution[edit]\n\n\nEvolution of the GM logo through the years:[172]\n\n\n\n* ![1938\u20131964[172]](image)\n\n1938\u20131964[172]\n* ![Mark of Excellence (1964\u20132021)[172]](image)\n\nMark of Excellence (1964\u20132021)[172]\n* ![2001\u20132021[172]](image)\n\n2001\u20132021[172]\n* ![2010\u20132021[172]](image)\n\n2010\u20132021[172]\n* ![2021 (gradient)[172]](image)\n\n2021 (gradient)[172]\n* ![2021 (flat)[173]](image)\n\n2021 (flat)[173]\n* ![2022 (wordmark)[174]](image)\n\n2022 (wordmark)[174]\n\n\n## Brands[edit]\n\n\n### Current[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Brand[175] | Founded\n | Began manufacturing vehicles\n | Joined GM\n | Markets served today\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Buick | 1899 | 1903 | 1908 | China, North America\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Cadillac | 1902 | 1902 | 1909 | North America, Middle East, China, Japan, South Korea, Europe, Kazakhstan\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Chevrolet | 1911 | 1911 | 1918 | Americas, China, Middle East, CIS, South Korea, Philippines, Japan, Europe, Australasia.\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | GMC | 1912 | 1912 | 1919 | North America, Middle East, South Korea\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CHN | Baojun | 2010 | 2010 | 2010 | China\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CHN | Wuling | 2002 | 2002 | 2002 | China, Indonesia\n |\n\n\n### Former[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Brand[175] | Founded\n | Began manufacturing vehicles\n | Joined GM\n | Fate\n | Defunct / Sold\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Acadian | 1962 | 1962 | 1962 | Discontinued | 1971 | Canadian Chevy with Pontiac design accents\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0KOR | Alpheon | 2010 | 2010 | 2010 | Discontinued | 2015 | The only available model was based on the Buick LaCrosse\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | As\u00fcna | 1992 | 1992 | 1992 | Discontinued | 1994 | Composed of Suzuki, Isuzu and Toyota models.\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Beaumont | 1966 | 1966 | 1966 | Discontinued | 1969 | Canadian Chevy with Pontiac design accents\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0UK | Bedford | 1931 | 1931 | 1931 | Discontinued | 1991 |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Cartercar | 1905 | 1905 | 1909 | Discontinued | 1915 |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0KOR | Daewoo | 1972 | 1972 | 1999 | Discontinued | 2011 | Succeeded by GM Korea |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Elmore | 1893 | 1900 | 1912 | Discontinued | 1916 |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Envoy | 1959 | 1959 | 1959 | Discontinued | 1970 | Imported Vauxhall and Bedford vehicles sold at Canadian Chevrolet and Oldsmobile dealerships\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Epic | 1964 | 1964 | 1964 | Discontinued | 1970 | Imported Vauxhall models sold at Canadian Pontiac, Buick and GMC dealerships\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Garland |  |  | 1909 | Discontinued | 1909 |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Geo | 1989 | 1989 | 1989 | Discontinued | 1997 | Composed of Suzuki, Isuzu and Toyota models.

This reign was longer than any other automaker, and GM is still among the world's largest automakers by vehicle unit sales.[176]\n\n\nIn 2008, the third-largest individual country by sales was Brazil, with some 550,000 GM vehicles sold. In that year, Argentina, Colombia, and Venezuela sold another 300,000 GM vehicles, suggesting that the total GM sales in South America (including sales in other South American countries such as Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, etc.) in that year were at a similar level to sales in China.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2009, General Motors sold 6.5\u00a0million cars and trucks globally; in 2010, it sold 8.39 million.[177] Sales in China rose 66.9% in 2009 to 1,830,000 vehicles and accounting for 13.4% of the market.[178]\n\n\nIn 2010, General Motors ranked second worldwide with 8.5 million vehicles produced.[179] In 2011, GM returned to the first place with 9.025 million units sold worldwide, corresponding to 11.9% market share of the global motor vehicle industry. In 2010, vehicle sales in China by GM rose 28.8% to a record 2,351,610 units.[180] The top two markets in 2011 were China, with 2,547,203 units, and the United States, with 2,503,820 vehicles sold. The Chevrolet brand was the main contributor to GM performance, with 4.76 million vehicles sold around the world in 2011, a global sales record.[181]\n\n\nBased on global sales in 2012, General Motors was ranked among the world's largest automakers.[182]\n\n\nIn May 2012, GM recorded an 18.4% market share in the U.S. with stock imported.[183]\n\n\nAnnual worldwide sales volume reached 10 million vehicles in 2016.[184][185][186] Sales in India for April 2016 \u2013 March 2017 declined to 25,823 units from 32,540 the previous year and market share contracted from 1.17% to 0.85% for the same period. However, exports surged 89% during the same period to 70,969 units. GMTC-I, GM's technical center in Bangalore, India continued in operation. Weak product line-up and below par service quality were the reasons for the poor showing by GM in India that year.[187][188]\n\n\nGlobal Volt/Ampera family sales totalled about 177,000 units from its inception in December 2010 through 2018.[189] including over 10,000 Opel/Vauxhall Amperas sold in Europe up to December 2015.[190][191] The Volt family of vehicles ranked as the world's all-time top-selling plug-in hybrid as of September\u00a02018[update], and it is also the third best selling plug-in electric car in history after the Nissan Leaf (375,000) and the Tesla Model S (253,000), as of October\u00a02018[update].[189] The Chevrolet Volt is also the U.S. all-time top-selling plug-in electric car with 148,556 units delivered through October 2018.[192][193]\n\n\n\n\n\nGM worldwide 2008 vehicle sales[194]  \n(thousands)\n| Rankin GM\n | Location\n | Vehiclesales\n | Marketshare (%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 2,981 | 22.1%\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0China | 1,095 | 12.0%\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 549 | 19.5%\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | 384 | 15.4%\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 359 | 21.4%\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 338 | 11.1%\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | 300 | 8.8%\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image)\u00a0Mexico | 212 | 19.8%\n |\n| 9\n | ![](image)\u00a0Australia | 133 | 13.1%\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | 117 | 9.7%\n |\n| 11\n | ![](image)\u00a0France | 114 | 4.4%\n |\n| 12\n | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | 107 | 7.8%\n |\n| 13\n | ![](image)\u00a0Argentina | 95 | 15.5%\n |\n| 14\n | ![](image)\u00a0Venezuela | 91 | 33.3%\n |\n| 15\n | ![](image)\u00a0Colombia | 80 | 36.3%\n |\n| 16\n | ![](image)\u00a0India | 66 | 3.3%\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | U.S. sales(vehicles)\n | Chg/yr.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998[195] | 4,603,991\n |  |\n| 1999\n | 5,017,150\n | ![Increase](image)9.0%\n |\n| 2000[196] | 4,953,163\n | ![Decrease](image)1.3%\n |\n| 2001\n | 4,904,015\n | ![Decrease](image)1.0%\n |\n| 2002\n | 4,858,705\n | ![Decrease](image)0.9%\n |\n| 2003\n | 4,756,403\n | ![Decrease](image)2.1%\n |\n| 2004[197] | 4,707,416\n | ![Decrease](image)1.0%\n |\n| 2005\n | 4,517,730\n | ![Decrease](image)4.0%\n |\n| 2006[198] | 4,124,645\n | ![Decrease](image)8.7%\n |\n| 2007[199] | 3,866,620\n | ![Decrease](image)6.3%\n |\n| 2008[200] | 2,980,688\n | ![Decrease](image)22.9%\n |\n| 2009[201] | 2,084,492\n | ![Decrease](image)30.1%\n |\n| 2010[202] | 2,215,227\n | ![Increase](image)6.3%\n |\n| 2011[203] | 2,503,820\n | ![Increase](image)13.7%\n |\n| 2012\n | 2,595,717\n | ![Increase](image)3.7%\n |\n| 2013[204] | 2,786,078\n | ![Increase](image)7.3%\n |\n| 2014[205] | 2,935,008\n | ![Increase](image)5.3%\n |\n| 2015[206] | 3,082,366\n | ![Increase](image)5.0%\n |\n| 2016\n | 3,042,773\n | ![Decrease](image)1.3%\n |\n| 2017\n | 3,002,241\n | ![Decrease](image)1.3%\n |\n| 2018\n | 2,954,037\n | ![Decrease](image)1.5%\n |\n| 2019[207] | 2,887,046\n | ![Decrease](image)2.3%\n |\n| 2020[208] | 2,547,339\n | ![Decrease](image)11.8%\n |\n| 2021[209] | 2,218,228\n | ![Decrease](image)12.9%\n |\n| 2022[209] | 2,274,088\n | ![Increase](image)2.5%\n |\n\n\n\n\nGM worldwide 2019 vehicle sales[210]\n| Location\n | Total sales\n | Year-On-Yearchange\n | Year-On-Yearchange (%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GM North America | 3,367,374 | (122,740) | (3.5)\n |\n| GM Europe | 3,590 | (266) | (6.9)\n |\n| GM South America | 668,842 | (21,355) | (3.1)\n |\n| GM International | 584,520 | 28,033 | 5.0\n |\n| China | 3,093,604 | (551,440) | (15.1)\n |\n| Total | 7,717,930 | (667,768) | (8.0)\n |\n\n\n## Management[edit]\n\n\n### Current board of directors[edit]\n\n\nNotable members of the board of directors of the company are as follows:[2]\n\n\n\n* Mary Barra, Chairman and CEO of General Motors\n* Joseph Ashton, former Vice President of the International Union at United Automobile Workers\n* Linda Gooden, former Vice President of Information Systems and Global Solutions at Lockheed Martin\n* Joseph Jimenez, CEO of Novartis\n* Jane Mendillo, former President and CEO at Harvard Management Company\n* Michael Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\n* James Mulva, former CEO, President, and Chairman at ConocoPhillips\n* Patricia Russo, CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n* Thomas Schoewe, former CFO of Wal-Mart Stores\n* Theodore Solso, former CEO and Chairman of Cummins\n* Carol Stephenson, former dean at Ivey Business School\n* Devin Wenig, former President and CEO of eBay\n* Jon McNeill, CEO of DVx Ventures LLC\n\n### Chairmen of the Board of General Motors[edit]\n\n\n* Thomas Neal\u2014November 19, 1912 \u2013 November 16, 1915\n* Pierre S. du Pont\u2014November 16, 1915 \u2013 February 7, 1929\n* Lammot du Pont II\u2014February 7, 1929 \u2013 May 3, 1937\n* Alfred P.

The program involved five designers, each lending their artistic talents to customize five different vehicles. Nicole Miller, Richard Tyler, Anna Sui, Todd Oldham, and Mark Eisen were tasked with transforming a Cadillac STS, Buick Riviera, GMC Yukon, Oldsmobile Bravada and Chevrolet Camaro Z28, respectively. The cars were then auctioned with the proceeds presented to the Nina Hyde Center at the Greater LA Auto Show in 1997.[215][216][217][218]\n\n\nSince 1997, GM has been a source of funding for Safe Kids Worldwide's \"Safe Kids Buckle Up\" program, an initiative to ensure child automobile safety through education and inspection.[219][220]\n\n\n\n## Labor conflicts[edit]\n\n\nGeneral Motors' American workers are unionized generally under the United Auto Workers (UAW), which is the primary auto workers union in the United States.\n\n\n\n### Flint sit-down strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Flint sit-down strike\n\n![](image)Young striker off sentry duty sleeping on the assembly line of auto seats\nThe 1936\u20131937 Flint sit-down strike against General Motors changed the UAW from a collection of isolated local unions on the fringes of the industry into a major labor union and led to the unionization of the domestic United States automobile industry.\n\n\nAfter the first convention of UAW in 1936, the union decided that it could not survive by piecemeal organizing campaigns at smaller plants, as it had in the past, but that it could organize the automobile industry only by going after its biggest and most powerful employer, General Motors, focusing on GM's production complex in Flint, Michigan.\n\n\nOrganizing in Flint was a difficult and dangerous plan. GM controlled city politics in Flint and kept a close eye on outsiders. According to Wyndham Mortimer, the UAW officer put in charge of the organizing campaign in Flint, he received a death threat by an anonymous caller when he visited Flint in 1936. GM also maintained an extensive network of spies throughout its plants. This forced UAW members to keep the names of new members secret and meeting workers at their homes.\n\n\nAs the UAW studied its target, it discovered that GM had only two factories that produced the dies from which car body components were stamped: one in Flint that produced the parts for Buicks, Pontiacs, and Oldsmobiles, and another in Cleveland that produced Chevrolet parts.\n\n\n\n![](image)National Guardsmen with machine guns overlooking Chevrolet factories number nine and number four\nWhile the UAW called for a sit-down strike in Flint, the police, armed with guns and tear gas, attempted to enter the Fisher Body 2 plant on January 11, 1937. The strikers inside the plant pelted them with hinges, bottles, and bolts. At the time, Vice President John Nance Garner supported federal intervention to break up the Flint Strike, but this idea was rejected by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The president urged GM to distinguish a union so the plants could re-open. The strike ended after 44 days.\n\n\nThat development forced GM to bargain with the union. John L. Lewis, President of the United Mine Workers and founder and leader of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, spoke for the UAW in those negotiations; UAW President Homer Martin was sent on a speaking tour to keep him out of the way. GM's representatives refused to be in the same room as the UAW, so Governor Frank Murphy acted as a courier and intermediary between the two groups. Governor Murphy sent in the U.S. National Guard not to evict the strikers but rather to protect them from the police and corporate strike-breakers. The two parties finally reached an agreement on February 11, 1937, on a one-page agreement that recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for GM's employees, who were union members for the next six months.[221]\n\n\n\n### Tool and die strike of 1939[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tool and die strike of 1939\n\nThe tool and die strike of 1939, also known as the \"strategy strike\", was an ultimately successful attempt by the UAW to be recognized as the sole representative for General Motors workers. In addition to representation rights, the UAW, working jointly with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), sought to resolve existing grievances of skilled workers.\n\n\n\n### United Auto Workers (UAW) strike of 1945\u20131946[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1945-46 United Auto Workers strike\n\nFrom November 21, 1945, until March 13, 1946, (113 days) the UAW organized \"320,000 hourly workers\" to form a US-wide strike against the General Motors Corporation, workers used the tactic of the sit down strike.[222] It was \"the longest strike against a major manufacturer\" that the UAW had yet seen, and it was also \"the longest national GM strike in its history\".[222] As director of the UAW's General Motors Department (coordinator of union relations with GM),[223] Walter Reuther suggested to his colleagues the idea of striking the GM manufacturing plants with a 'one-at-a-time' strategy, which was \"intended to maximize pressure on the target company\".[222] Reuther also put forth the demands of the strikers: a 30 percent increase in wages and a hold on product prices. However, the strike ended with the dissatisfaction of Walter Reuther and the UAW, and the workers received only a 17.5-percent increase in wages.\n\n\n\n### 2007 General Motors strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2007 General Motors strike\n\nThe 2007 General Motors strike was a strike from September 24 to 26, 2007, by the UAW against General Motors.\n\n\nOn September 24, 2007, General Motors workers represented by the UAW union went on strike against the company. The first US-wide strike against GM since 1970 was expected to idle 59 plants and facilities for an indefinite period of time. Talks broke down after more than 20 straight days of bargaining failed to produce a new contract. Major issues that proved to be stumbling blocks for an agreement included wages, benefits, job security and investments in US facilities.[224][225][226]\n\n\nTwo car assembly plants in Oshawa, Ontario and a transmission facility in Windsor closed on September 25. However, on September 26, a tentative agreement was reached, and the strike's end was announced by UAW officials in a news conference at 4 a.m.[227] By the following day, all GM workers in both countries were back to work.\n\n\n\n### 2019 General Motors strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 General Motors strike\n\nOn the morning of September 15, 2019, after talks broke down to renew their contract, which expired earlier that day, the UAW announced that GM employees would begin striking at 11:59 pm.[228] This strike shut down operations in nine states, including 33 manufacturing plants and 22 parts distribution warehouses.[229] After 40 days, on October 25, 2019, the \"longest strike by autoworkers in a decade\" and the longest against GM since 1970 came to an end when United Auto Workers members voted to approve a new contract with GM. Striking labor union members received a $275 a week strike pay salary for the duration of the strike.[230] The strike cost GM more than $2 billion.\n\n\n\n### 2023 United Auto Workers strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 United Auto Workers strike\n\nThe ongoing strike launched by the UAW is the first strike against all three major American automakers in history. Then-recently elected UAW president Shawn Fain stated that he was \"fed up\" with the current situation between workers and automakers; Fain specifically blasted the tiered workers system at automakers, failure for automakers to keep wages up with inflation, pensions, as well as the introduction of a four-day workweek as opposed to the five-day workweek. GM CEO Mary Barra protested that her company offered an \"unprecedented deal\" which gave workers 20% raises as well as \"world-class\" healthcare. Barra further stated that meeting all 1,000 plus demands would bankrupt the company and cost over $100 billion.[231][232]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Streetcar conspiracy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: General Motors streetcar conspiracy\n\nBetween 1938 and 1950, GM allegedly deliberately monopolized the sale of buses and supplies to National City Lines (NCL) and its subsidiaries, in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, intending to dismantle streetcar systems in many cities in the United States and make buses, sold by GM, the dominant form of public transport.\n\n\n\n### Ralph Nader and the Corvair[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1961\u201363 Corvair swing-axle rear suspension\n*Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-In Dangers of the American Automobile* by Ralph Nader, published in 1965, is a book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety. It relates to the first models of the Chevrolet Corvair (1960\u20131964) that had a swing axle suspension design that was prone to 'tuck under' in certain circumstances. To compensate for the removal of a front stabilizer bar (anti-roll bar) as a cost-cutting measure, Corvairs required tire pressures that were outside of the tire manufacturer's recommended tolerances. The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential (15 psi front, 26 psi rear, when cold; 18 psi and 30 psi hot), and if one inflated the tires equally, as was standard practice for all other cars at the time, the result was dangerous over-steer.[233]\n\n\nIn early March 1966, several media outlets, including *The New Republic* and *The New York Times*, alleged that GM had tried to discredit Ralph Nader, hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past, and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations.[234][235] Nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for $425,000. Nader's lawsuit against GM was ultimately decided by the New York Court of Appeals, whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover \"overzealous surveillance\".[236] Nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the pro-consumer Center for Study of Responsive Law.\n\n\nA 1972 safety commission report conducted by Texas A&M University concluded that the 1960\u20131963 Corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations.[237] The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a press release in 1972 describing the findings of NHTSA testing from the previous year. NHTSA conducted a series of comparative tests in 1971 studying the handling of the 1963 Corvair and four contemporary cars \u2014 a Ford Falcon, Plymouth Valiant, Volkswagen Beetle, and Renault Dauphine \u2014 along with a second-generation Corvair (with its completely redesigned, independent rear suspension). The 143-page report reviewed NHTSA's extreme-condition handling tests, national crash-involvement data for the cars in the test as well as General Motors' internal documentation regarding the Corvair's handling.[238] NHTSA went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests. This review panel concluded that 'the 1960\u201363 Corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests ... the handling and stability performance of the 1960\u201363 Corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover, and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic'.\n\n\nFormer GM executive John DeLorean asserted, in his book *On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors*, that Nader's criticisms were valid.[239]\n\n\nJournalist David E. Davis noted that despite Nader's claim that swing-axle rear suspension were dangerous, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen all used similar swing-axle concepts during that era.[240]\n\n\n\n### Apartheid[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, GM (along with other multinational corporations) was sued by a group of South Africans represented by the Khulumani Support Group.[241] The plaintiffs alleged that the company provided vehicles to the South African security forces during the Apartheid. The company settled with the plaintiffs in 2012, agreeing to pay a sum of up to $1.5 million.[242]\n\n\n\n### Ignition switch recall[edit]\n\n\nMain article: General Motors ignition switch recalls\n\nIn May 2014, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration fined the company $35 million for failing to recall cars with faulty ignition switches for a decade, despite knowing there was a problem with the switches. General Motors paid compensation for 124 deaths linked to the faulty switches.[243] The $35 million fine was the maximum the regulator could impose.[244] The total cost of the recall was estimated to be $1.5 billion.[142] As well as the Cobalts, the switches of concern had been installed in many other cars, such as the Pontiac G5, the Saturn Ion, the Chevrolet HHR, the Saturn Sky, and Pontiac Solstice. The recall involved about 2.6 million GM cars worldwide.[245]\n\n\n\n### Xinjiang region[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute accused at least 82 major brands, including General Motors, of being connected to forced Uyghur labor in Xinjiang.[246]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![flag](image)Michigan portal\n* ![](image)Cars portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers\n* ASOTRECOL\n* Crucible Industries\n* EcoCAR\n* General Motors Hy-wire\n* General Motors proving grounds\n* General Motors Technical Center\n* GM people\n* GM vehicles by brand\n* List of automobile manufacturers of the United States\n* List of GM engines\n* List of General Motors factories\n* List of General Motors platforms\n* List of GM transmissions\n* United States Council for Automotive Research\n* VIA Motors\n* Freon\n* Global Climate Coalition\n* Ethyl Corporation\n* Durant Motors\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Department of State, Division of Corporations (General Information Name Search)\".

Founded in 1937 by the German Labour Front under the Nazi Party and revived into a global brand after World War II by the British Army officer Ivan Hirst, it is known for the iconic Beetle and serves as the flagship brand of the Volkswagen Group, the largest automotive manufacturer by worldwide sales in 2016 and 2017.[1] The group's biggest market is in China, which delivers 40 percent of its sales and profits.[2][3] Its name is derived from the German-language terms *Volk* and *Wagen*, translating to \"people's car\" when combined.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1932\u20131940: People's Car project[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Model of Porsche Type 12 (Z\u00fcndapp), Museum of Industrial Culture, Nuremberg\nVolkswagen was established in 1937 by the German Labour Front (German: *Deutsche Arbeitsfront*) as part of the Strength Through Joy (German: *Kraft durch Freude*) program in Berlin.[4] In the early 1930s, cars were a luxury \u2013 most Germans could afford nothing more elaborate than a motorcycle, and only one German out of 50 owned a car. Seeking a potential new market, some car makers began independent \"people's car\" projects\u00a0\u2013 the Mercedes 170H, BMW 3/15, Adler AutoBahn, Steyr 55 and Hanomag 1.3L, among others.\n\n\nThe growing trend was not nascent; B\u00e9la Bar\u00e9nyi, a pioneering automotive engineer, is credited as already having conceived the basic design during the mid-1920s. Josef Ganz developed the Standard Superior (going as far as advertising it as the \"German Volkswagen\"). In Germany, the company Hanomag mass-produced the 2/10 PS \"Kommissbrot\", a small, cheap rear-engined car, from 1925 to 1928.[5] Also, in Czechoslovakia, the Hans Ledwinka designed Tatra T77, a very popular car amongst the German elite, was becoming smaller and more affordable at each revision. Ferdinand Porsche, a well-known designer for high-end vehicles and race cars, had been trying for years to get a manufacturer interested in a small car suitable for a family. He built a car named the \"Volksauto\" from the ground up in 1933, using many popular ideas and several of his own, putting together a car with an air-cooled rear engine, torsion bar suspension, and a \"beetle\" shape, the front bonnet rounded for better aerodynamics (necessary as it had a small engine).[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)VW logo during the 1930s, initials surrounded by a stylised cogwheel and a spinning propeller that looked like a swastika[7]\nIn 1934, with many of the above projects still in development or early stages of production, Adolf Hitler became involved, ordering the production of a basic vehicle capable of transporting two adults and three children at 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph). He wanted a car every German family would be able to afford.[6] The \"People's Car\" would be available through a savings plan at 990\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01 (US$396 in 1938)\u2014about the price of a small motorcycle (the average income being around 32\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01 a week).[8][9]\n\n\nIt soon became apparent that private industry could not turn out a car for only 990\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01. Thus, Hitler chose to sponsor an all-new, state-owned factory using Ferdinand Porsche's design (with some of Hitler's design suggestions, including an air-cooled engine so nothing could freeze). The intention was that German families could buy the car through a savings scheme (*\"*F\u00fcnf Mark die Woche musst du sparen, willst du im eigenen Wagen fahren*\"\u00a0\u2013 \"Five Marks a week you must set aside, if in your own car you wish to ride*\"), which around 336,000 people eventually paid into.[10] However, the project was not commercially viable, and only government support was able to keep it afloat.[11][Note 2] Due to the outbreak of war in 1939, none of the participants in the savings scheme ever received a car. In 1950, a lawsuit was issued that, after 12 years of trial, ultimately provided a credit of 12% off the list price of a new VW base model or 5-times less the value paid into the saving scheme.[12]\n\n\nPrototypes of the car called the *KdF-Wagen* (from the German term *Kraft durch Freude*, meaning \"Strength Through Joy\") appeared from 1938 onwards (the first cars had been produced in Stuttgart). The car already had its distinctive round shape and air-cooled, flat-four, rear-mounted engine. The VW car was just one of many *KdF* programs, which included things such as tours and outings. The prefix *Volks* (\"People's\") was not just applied to cars, but also to other products in Germany \u2013 the *Volksempf\u00e4nger* radio receiver for instance. On 28 May 1937, *Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung des Deutschen Volkswagens mbH* (\"Company for the Preparation of the German Volkswagen Ltd.\"), or *Gezuvor*[13] for short, was established by the *Deutsche Arbeitsfront* in Berlin. More than a year later, on 16 September 1938, it was renamed to *Volkswagenwerk GmbH*.[14][15]\n\n\n\n![](image)VW Type 82E\nErwin Komenda, the longstanding Auto Union chief designer, part of Ferdinand Porsche's hand-picked team,[6] developed the car body of the prototype, which was recognisably the Beetle known today. It was one of the first cars designed with the aid of a wind tunnel\u2014a method used for German aircraft design since the early 1920s. The car designs were put through rigorous tests and achieved a record-breaking million miles of testing before being deemed finished.\n\n\nThe construction of the new factory started in May 1938 in the new town of \"Stadt des KdF-Wagens\" (renamed Wolfsburg after the war), which had been purpose-built for the factory workers.[14] This factory had only produced a handful of cars by the time war started in 1939. None were actually delivered to any holder of the completed saving stamp books, though one Type 1 Cabriolet was presented to Hitler on 20 April 1944 (his 55th birthday).[14]\n\n\n\n### 1939\u20131944: Wartime production and Nazi concentration camp labour[edit]\n\n\nWar changed production to military vehicles\u2014the Type 82 *K\u00fcbelwagen* (\"Bucket car\") utility vehicle (VW's most common wartime model), and the amphibious *Schwimmwagen*\u2014manufactured for German forces. One of the first foreigners to drive a Volkswagen was the American war correspondent Ernie Pyle, who had the use of a captured Volkswagen for a few days after the Allied victory in Tunisia in May 1943.[16] As was common with much of the production in Nazi Germany during the war, slave labour was utilised in the Volkswagen plant, e.g. from Arbeitsdorf concentration camp. The company would admit in 1998 that it used 15,000 slaves during the war effort. German historians estimated that 80% of Volkswagen's wartime workforce was slave labour.[17] Many of the slaves were reported to have been supplied from the concentration camps upon request from plant managers. A lawsuit was filed in 1998 by survivors for restitution for the forced labour.[18] Volkswagen would set up a voluntary restitution fund.[19]\n\n\n\n### 1945\u20131948: British military intervention[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen industrial plant in Wolfsburg, pictured in 2006\nIn April 1945, KdF-Stadt and its heavily bombed factory were captured by the United States armed forces and subsequently handed over to the British, within whose occupation zone the town and factory fell. The factory was placed under the control of British Army officer Major Ivan Hirst, REME, a civilian Military Governor with the occupying forces. At first, one plan was to use it for military vehicle maintenance, and possibly dismantle and ship it to Britain. Since it had been used for military production, (though not of KdF-Wagens) and had been in Hirst's words, a \"political animal\" rather than a commercial enterprise \u2013 technically making it liable for destruction under the terms of the Potsdam Agreement \u2013 the equipment could have been salvaged as war reparations. Allied dismantling policy changed in late 1946 to mid-1947, though heavy industry continued to be dismantled until 1951.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOne of the factory's wartime 'KdF-Wagen' cars had been taken to the factory for repairs and abandoned there. Hirst had it repainted green and demonstrated it to British Army headquarters. Short of light transport, in September 1945 the British Army was persuaded to place a vital order for 20,000 cars. However, production facilities had been massively disrupted, there was a refugee crisis at and around the factory, and some parts (such as carburettors) were unavailable. Hirst and his German assistant Heinrich Nordhoff (who went on to run the Wolfsburg facility after the military government ended in 1949) helped to stabilise the acute social situation while simultaneously re-establishing production. Hirst, for example, used his engineering experience to arrange the manufacture of carburettors, the original producers being effectively 'lost' in the Soviet zone.[20] The first few hundred cars went to personnel from the occupying forces, and to Australia Post. Some British service personnel were allowed to take their Beetles back to the United Kingdom when they were demobilised.[21][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nIn 1986, Hirst said that factory workers were, after many years of Nazi conditioning, initially reluctant to follow his orders; to counter this, he had his military uniform brought back from Britain and wore it in the factory, after which he reported having no problems even though he was no longer a soldier at the time but a civilian member of the military government.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe post-war industrial plans for Germany set out rules that governed which industries Germany was allowed to retain. These rules set German car production at a maximum of 10% of 1936 car production.[22] By 1946, the factory produced 1,000 cars a month even though it was still in disrepair. Owing to roof and window damage, production had to stop when it rained, and the company had to barter new vehicles for steel for production.[23]\n\n\nThe car and its town changed their Second World War-era names to \"Volkswagen\" and \"Wolfsburg\" respectively, and production increased. It was still unclear what was to become of the factory. It was offered to representatives from the American, Australian, British, and French motor industries who all rejected it. After an inspection of the plant, Sir William Rootes, head of the British Rootes Group, told Hirst the project would fail within two years, and that the car \"...is quite unattractive to the average motorcar buyer, is too ugly and too noisy. If you think you're going to build cars in this place, you're a bloody fool, young man.\"[24] The official report said: \"To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise.\"[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cogeneration plant\nFord representatives were equally critical. In March 1948, the British offered the Volkswagen company to Ford, free of charge. Henry Ford II, the son of Edsel Ford, travelled to West Germany for discussions. Heinz Nordhoff was also present, as well as Ernest Breech, chairman of the board for Ford. Henry Ford II looked to Breech for his opinion, and Breech said, \"Mr. Ford, I don't think what we're being offered here is worth a damn!\"[26] Ford passed on the offer, leaving Volkswagen to rebuild itself under Nordhoff's leadership.[27]\n\n\n\n### 1948\u20131961: Icon of post-war West Germany[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1949 Volkswagen \"split rear window\" Sedan\n![](image)Volkswagen Cabriolet (1953)\n![](image)Volkswagen Type 2 (T1)\n![](image)An original 1300 Deluxe, circa 1966\n![](image)In the later 1960s, as the worldwide demand for the Beetle finally began to diminish, a variety of successor designs were proposed and, in most cases, rejected by management.\nFrom 1948, Volkswagen became an important element, symbolically and economically, of West German regeneration.[*according to whom?*] Heinrich Nordhoff (1899\u20131968), a former senior manager at Opel who had overseen civilian and military vehicle production in the 1930s and 1940s, was recruited to run the factory in 1948. In 1949, Major Hirst left the company\u2014now re-formed as a trust controlled by the West German government and government of the State of Lower Saxony. The \"Beetle\" sedan or \"peoples' car\" Volkswagen is the Type 1. Apart from the introduction of the Volkswagen Type 2 commercial vehicle (van, pick-up, and camper), and the VW Karmann Ghia sports car, Nordhoff pursued the one-model policy until shortly before his death in 1968.\n\n\nVolkswagens were first exhibited and sold in the United States in 1949 but sold only two units in America that first year. On entry to the US market, the VW was briefly sold as a *Victory Wagon*. Volkswagen of America was formed in April 1955 to standardise sales and service in the United States. Production of the Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle increased dramatically over the years, the total reaching one million in 1955.\n\n\nThe UK's first official Volkswagen importer, Colborne Garages of Ripley, Surrey, started business with importing parts for the models brought home by soldiers returning from Germany.[21]\n\n\nCanadian Motors, Limited brought in Canada's first shipment of Volkswagens on 10 July 1952 (shipping order 143075).[*citation needed*] The order consisted of 12 vehicles, (3) model 11C, a black, green, and sand colour (3) 11GS, a chestnut brown and two azure blue, (2) 24A-M51 in red, (1) 21A in blue, (1) 23A in blue, (1) 22A beige colour, and one ambulance.[*citation needed*] Volkswagens were seen in Canada for the first time at the Canadian National Exhibition in August 1952 and were accepted enthusiastically. (At least one Type 2 bus from this order still exists, and is currently in France undergoing restoration).[*citation needed*] The first shipment for Volkswagen Canada reached Toronto in early December 1952. (At least one Type 1 from this first shipment still exists, and was driven on a nationwide tour for Volkswagen Canada's 60th year of business festivities in 2012).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBy 1955, sales warranted the building of the Volkswagen plant on a 32-acre (13\u00a0ha) site on Scarborough's Golden Mile. To this, a 60,000-square-foot (5,600\u00a0m2) building with administration, showrooms, service, repairs and parts was built in 1957, with storage for $4,000,000 of parts.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1959, VW started production at a plant near S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil.[28] Volkswagen do Brasil was accused of spying on workers during the time of the military dictatorship in the 1970s and informing police on oppositional activities. In 1976, mass arrests occurred and some VW employees were tortured. In 1979, Brazilian VW workers travelled to Wolfsburg to inform the CEO in person. In 2015, activists and former VW employees in Brazil spoke out in public accused the company's silence about the persecution of its workers. In fall 2016, VW commissioned an expert review of the situation due end of 2017.[29]\n\n\nOn 22 August 1960, *Volkswagenwerk GmbH* was renamed to *Volkswagenwerk AG*. Sales soared throughout the 1960s, peaking at the end of the decade thanks in part to the famous advertising campaigns by New York advertising agency Doyle, Dane Bernbach.[*citation needed*] Led by art director Helmut Krone, and copywriters Julian Koenig and Bob Levinson, Volkswagen advertisements became[*when?*] as popular as the car, using crisp layouts and witty copy to lure the younger, sophisticated consumers with whom the car became associated.[*citation needed*] Even though it was almost universally known as the Beetle (or the Bug), it was never officially labelled as such by the manufacturer, instead referred to as the Type 1.[30]\n\n\nAlthough the car was becoming outdated, during the 1960s and early 1970s, American exports, innovative advertising, and a growing reputation for reliability helped production figures surpass the levels of the previous record-holder, the Ford Model T. On 17 February 1972, the 15,007,034th Beetle was sold. Volkswagen could now claim the world production record for the most-produced, single make of car in history. By 1973, total production was over 16 million.\n\n\nTo commemorate its passing the Ford Model T's record sales mark and its victories in the Baja 1000 Mexican races from 1967 to 1971, Volkswagen produced its first limited-edition Beetle. It was marketed as the \"Baja Champion SE\"[31] in the United States and the \"Marathon\" Superbeetle in the rest of the world. It featured unique \"Marathon Blau\" metallic blue paint, steel-pressed 10-spoke 15-inch (38\u00a0cm) magnesium-alloy wheels, a commemorative metal plate mounted on the glovebox and a certificate of authenticity presented to the original purchaser. Dealer-installed options for this limited-edition Superbeetle included the following: white stripes running the length of the rocker-panel, a special shifter knob, bumper overriders, tapered exhaust tips, fake walnut inserts in the dashboard (behind the steering wheel and the glovebox cover) as well as Bosch fog lights mounted on the front bumper.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 1961\u20131973: Beetle to Golf[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1963 VW Type 3 Notchback\nThe 1961 Type 1 Beetle had a 36\u00a0hp 1200cc four cylinder air-cooled flat-four opposed OHV engine made of aluminium alloy block and heads. By 1966, the Type 1 came with a 1300cc engine. By 1967 the Type 1 had a 1500cc engine, and 1600cc in 1970. The air-cooled engine lost favour in the United States market with the advent of unleaded petrol and smog controls. These air-cooled engines were commonly tuned to be fuel-rich in order to control engine over-heating, and this led to excessive carbon monoxide emissions. VW production equipment was eventually moved to Mexico where vehicle emissions were not regulated. Beetles were popular on the US West Coast where the limited-capacity cabin heating was less inconvenient. Beetles were popularised on the US West Coast as beach buggies and dune buggies.\n\n\nVW expanded its product line in 1961 with the introduction of four Type 3 models (Karmann Ghia, Notchback, Fastback, and Variant) based on the new Type 3 mechanical underpinnings. The name 'Squareback' was used in the United States for the Variant.\n\n\nIn 1969 the larger Type 4 (411 and 412) models were introduced. These differed substantially from previous vehicles, with the notable introduction of monocoque/unibody construction, the option of a fully automatic transmission, electronic fuel injection, and a sturdier powerplant.\n\n\nIn 1964, Volkswagen acquired Auto Union, and in 1969, NSU Motorenwerke AG (NSU). The former company owned the historic Audi brand, which had disappeared after the Second World War. VW ultimately merged Auto Union and NSU to create the modern Audi company, and would go on to develop it as its luxury vehicle marque. The purchase of Auto Union and NSU was a pivotal point in Volkswagen's history, as both companies yielded the technological expertise that proved necessary for VW to survive when demand for its air-cooled models went into decline.\n\n\n\n![](image)1970 VW Squareback (Type III)\nVolkswagen added a \"Super Beetle\"[32] (the Type 131) to its lineup in 1971. The Type 131 differed from the standard Beetle in its use of a MacPherson strut front suspension instead of the usual torsion bars. The Super Beetle featured a new hooded, padded dash and curved windshield (from 1973 model year on up). Rack and pinion steering replaced recirculating ball steering gears in the model year 1975 and up. The front of the car was stretched 2 inches (51\u00a0mm) to allow the spare tire to lie flat, and the combination of these two features increased the usable front luggage space.\n\n\nIn 1973, Volkswagen introduced the military-themed Type 181, or \"Trekker\" in Europe, \"Thing\" in America, recalling the wartime Type 82. The military version was produced for the NATO-era German Army during the Cold War years of 1970 to 1979. The US Thing version only sold for two years, 1973 and 1974.\n\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Type 4 assembly line in Wolfsburg as of 1973\nBy late 1972, Volkswagen had decided to cancel the nearly finished typ 266, a project for a mid-engined car to replace the Beetle, and to focus on front-wheel-drive, water-cooled cars. Rudolf Leiding, recently made head of Volkswagen, cited noise, heat, and servicing problems with the mid-engine layout, as well as the difficulty of making it a station wagon.[33]\n\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Passat (1973\u20131977 model)\nVolkswagen was in serious trouble by 1973.[34] The Type 3 and Type 4 models had sold in much smaller numbers than the Beetle and the NSU-based K70 also failed to sell. Beetle sales had started to decline rapidly in European and North American markets. The company knew that Beetle production had to end, but faced a conundrum of how to replace it. VW's ownership of Audi/Auto Union proved beneficial. Its expertise in front-wheel drive, and water-cooled engines would help Volkswagen produce a credible Beetle successor. Audi influences paved the way for this new generation of Volkswagens: the Passat, Scirocco, Golf, and Polo.\n\n\nFirst in the series was the Volkswagen Passat (Dasher in the US), introduced in 1973, a fastback version of the Audi 80, using many identical body and mechanical parts. Estate/wagon versions were available in many markets. In Europe, the estate/wagon version dominated market share for many years.\n\n\nIn spring 1974, the Scirocco followed. The coupe was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro. Based on the platform of the not yet released Golf, it was built at Karmann due to capacity constraints at Volkswagen.\n\n\nThe pivotal model emerged as the Volkswagen Golf in 1974, marketed in the United States and Canada as the Rabbit for the 1st generation (1975\u20131985) and 5th generation (2006\u20132009). Its angular styling was designed by the Italian Giorgetto Giugiaro. Its design followed trends for small family cars set by the 1959 Mini\u00a0\u2013 the Golf had a transversely mounted, water-cooled engine in the front, driving the front wheels, and had a hatchback, a format that has dominated the market segment ever since. Beetle production at Wolfsburg ended upon the Golf's introduction. It continued in smaller numbers at other German factories (Hanover and Emden) until 1978, but mainstream production shifted to Brazil and Mexico.\n\n\nIn 1975, the Volkswagen Polo followed. It was a re-badged Audi 50, which was soon discontinued in 1978. The Polo became the base of the Volkswagen Derby, which was introduced in 1977. The Derby was for all intents and purposes a three-box design of the Polo. After a second model generation, the Derby was discontinued in 1985, although the body style lived on in the form of the Polo classic/Polo saloon until 1991.\n\n\nPassat, Scirocco, Golf, and Polo shared many character-defining features, as well as parts and engines. They built the basis for Volkswagen's turn-around.\n\n\n\n### 1974\u20131990: Product line expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Polo (1975\u20131979 model)\nWhile Volkswagen's range of cars soon became similar to that of other large European car makers, the Golf has been the mainstay of the Volkswagen line-up since its introduction, and the mechanical basis for several other cars of the company. There have been eight generations of the Volkswagen Golf, the first of which was produced from the summer of 1974 until the autumn of 1983 (sold as the Rabbit in the United States and Canada and as the Caribe in Latin America). Its chassis also spawned the Volkswagen Scirocco sport coupe, Volkswagen Jetta saloon/sedan, Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet convertible, and Volkswagen Caddy pick-up. North American production of the Rabbit commenced at the Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly Plant near New Stanton, Pennsylvania in 1978. It would be produced in the United States as the Rabbit until the spring of 1984.[*citation needed*] The second-generation Golf hatchback/Jetta sedan ran from October 1983 until the autumn of 1991, and a North American version produced at Westmoreland Assembly went on sale at the start of the 1985 model year. The production numbers of the first-generation Golf has continued to grow annually in South Africa as the Citi Golf, with only minor modifications to the interior, engine and chassis, using tooling relocated from the New Stanton, Pennsylvania plant when that site began to build the Second Generation car.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Volkswagen's sales in the United States and Canada fell dramatically, despite the success of models like the Golf elsewhere. Sales in the United States were 293,595 in 1980, but by 1984 they were down to 177,709.[35] The introduction of the second-generation Golf, GTI and Jetta models helped Volkswagen briefly in North America. Motor Trend named the GTI its Car of the Year for 1985, and Volkswagen rose in the J.D. Power buyer satisfaction ratings to eighth place in 1985, up from 22nd a year earlier.[36] VW's American sales broke 200,000 in 1985 and 1986 before resuming the downward trend from earlier in the decade. Chairman Carl Hahn decided to expand the company elsewhere (mostly in developing countries), and the New Stanton, Pennsylvania factory closed on 14 July 1988.[37] Meanwhile, four years after signing a cooperation agreement with the Spanish car maker SEAT in 1982, Hahn expanded the company by purchasing a majority share of SEAT up to 75% by the end of 1986, which VW bought outright in 1990.[38] On 4 July 1985, *Volkswagenwerk AG* was renamed to *Volkswagen AG*.\n\n\nVolkswagen entered the supermini market in 1975 with the Volkswagen Polo, a stylish and spacious three-door hatchback designed by Bertone. It was a strong seller in West Germany and most of the rest of Western Europe, being one of the first foreign small cars to prove popular in Britain. It had started out in 1974 as the Audi 50, which was only available in certain markets and was less popular. The Polo entered a market sector already being dominated by the Fiat 127 and Renault 5, and which before long would also include the Austin Metro and Ford Fiesta.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1981, the second-generation Polo launched as a hatchback (resembling a small estate car). In 1983 the range was expanded, with the introduction of a Coupe (similar to a conventional hatchback), and the Classic (a 2-door saloon).[39] The Polo's practicality, despite the lack of a five-door version, helped ensure even stronger sales than its predecessor. It continued to sell well after a makeover in 1990, finally being replaced by an all-new version in 1994.[40] Also arriving in 1981 were the second generation of the larger Passat and a second generation of the Volkswagen Scirocco coupe.\n\n\nIn 1983 the MK2 Golf was launched. At the beginning of 1988, the third generation Passat was the next major car launch and Volkswagen did not produce a hatchback version of this Passat, despite the rising popularity of the hatchback body style throughout Europe.[*citation needed*] Just after launching the B3 Passat, Volkswagen launched the Corrado, analogous to the Scirocco, although the Scirocco remained in production until 1992; a third generation of Scirocco was in production 2008\u201317.[41]\n\n\n\n### 1991\u20131999[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Golf, in North American form\nIn 1991, Volkswagen launched the third-generation Golf, which was European Car of the Year for 1992. The Golf Mk3 and Jetta Mk3 arrived in North America in 1993. The sedan version of the Golf was badged Vento in Europe but remained Jetta in the United States. The Scirocco and the later Corrado were both Golf-based coup\u00e9s.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen New Beetle\nIn 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the J Mays-designed Concept One, a \"retro\"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, based on the platform of the Polo. Due to a positive response to the concept, a production version was developed as the New Beetle, based on the Golf's larger platform.[42]\n\n\nIn 1995 the Sharan was launched in Europe, the result of a joint venture with Ford, which also resulted in the Ford Galaxy and SEAT Alhambra.[43]\n\n\nThe company's evolution of its model range was continued with the Golf Mk4, introduced at the end of 1997 (North America in 1999), its chassis spawned a host of other cars within the Volkswagen Group; the Volkswagen Bora (the sedan known as the Jetta in the United States), SEAT Toledo, SEAT Le\u00f3n, Audi A3, Audi TT, and \u0160koda Octavia. Other main models during the decade include the Polo, a smaller car than the Golf, and the larger Passat for the segment above the Golf.\n\n\nIn 1998 the company launched the new Lupo city car. In 1999 they announced the first \"3-litre\" car, a lightweight version of the Lupo that could travel 100\u00a0km with only 3-liters of diesel\u2014making it the world's most fuel efficient car at the time.[44]\n\n\n\n### 2000\u20132016: Further expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The fifth generation Volkswagen Jetta\nVolkswagen began introducing an array of new models after Bernd Pischetsrieder became Volkswagen Group CEO (responsible for all Group brands) in 2002. The sixth-generation VW Golf was launched in 2008, came runner-up to the Opel/Vauxhall Insignia in the 2009 European Car of the Year, and has spawned several cousins: VW Jetta, VW Scirocco, SEAT Le\u00f3n, SEAT Toledo, \u0160koda Octavia and Audi A3 hatchback ranges, as well as a new mini-MPV, the SEAT Altea. The GTI, a \"hot hatch\" performance version of the Golf, boasts a 2.0\u00a0L Turbocharged Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) direct injection engine. VW began marketing the Golf under the Rabbit name once again in the US and Canada in 2006.\n\n\nThe sixth-generation Passat and the fifth-generation Jetta both debuted in 2005, and Volkswagen announced plans to expand its lineup further by bringing back the Scirocco by 2008. Other models in Wolfgang Bernhard's (Volkswagen brand CEO) \"product offensive\" include the Tiguan mid-sized SUV in 2008 and a Passat Coup\u00e9. In November 2006 Bernd Pischetsrieder announced his resignation as Volkswagen Group CEO and was replaced by Audi worldwide CEO Martin Winterkorn at the beginning of 2007.\n\n\n\n![](image)The third generation Volkswagen Scirocco\nVolkswagen maintained North American sales of 224,195 in 2005. The momentum continued for fiscal 2006, as Volkswagen's North American sales for the year were 235,140 vehicles, a 4.9 per cent increase over 2005, despite a slump in domestic North American manufacturer's sales. In conjunction with the introduction of new models, the production location of Volkswagen vehicles also underwent a great change. The 2007 Eos, a hardtop convertible, is produced in a new facility in Portugal. All Golfs/Rabbits and GTIs as of 2006 are manufactured in Wolfsburg, Germany, rather than Puebla, Mexico, where Golfs and GTIs for the North American market were produced from 1989 to 1998, and the Brazilian factory in Curitiba, where Golfs and GTIs were produced from 1999 to 2006 (the Jetta has been primarily manufactured in Mexico since 1989). Volkswagen is also in the process of reconfiguring an automotive assembly plant in Belgium. The new models and investments in manufacturing improvements were immediately noticed by automotive critics. Favourable reviews for Volkswagen's newest cars include the GTI being named by *Consumer Reports* as the top sporty car under $25,000, one of *Car and Driver* magazine's \"10 Best\" for 2007, *Automobile* Magazine's 2007 Car of the Year, as well as a 2008 *Motor Trend* comparison ranking the mid-size Passat first in its class.\n\n\n\n![](image)The seventh-generation Volkswagen Golf\nVolkswagen partnered with Daimler AG and other companies to market the BlueTec clean diesel technology on cars and trucks from Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and other companies and brands. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, four of the ten most fuel-efficient vehicles available for sale in the United States are powered by Volkswagen diesel engines.[45] Volkswagen has offered a number of its vehicles with a TDI (Turbocharged Direct Injection) engine, which lends class-leading fuel economy to several models. They were a three-way tie for 8th (TDI Beetle, TDI Golf, TDI Jetta) and ninth, the TDI Jetta Wagon. In addition, all Volkswagen TDI diesel engines produced from 1996 to 2006 can be driven on 100% biodiesel fuel.[*citation needed*] For the 2007 model year, however, strict US government emissions regulations had forced Volkswagen to drop most diesels from their US engine lineup, but a new lineup of diesel engines (then thought) compatible to US standards returned to the American market starting with Model Year 2009. These post-2009 Clean Diesel engines are limited to running on 5% (B5) biodiesel only to maintain Volkswagen's warranty. Volkswagen long resisted adding a SUV to its lineup, but relented with the introduction of the Touareg, made in partnership with Porsche, while they worked on the Porsche Cayenne and later the Audi Q7. Though acclaimed as a fine handling vehicle, the Touareg has been a modest seller at best, and it has been criticised by auto reviewers for its absence of a third-row seat, the relatively poor fuel economy, and the high vehicle mass. Volkswagen set plans to add a compact SUV with styling influences from the \"Concept A\" concept vehicle introduced at the 2006 Geneva Auto Show, and on 20 July 2006, Volkswagen announced that the new vehicle called the Tiguan.\n\n\nSince the discontinuation of the T4 in 2003 and the decision not to export the T5 to the United States, Volkswagen, coincidentally, lacked a van for its North American lineup. To remedy this, Volkswagen launched the Volkswagen Routan, a badge-engineered Dodge Grand Caravan made for the American and Canadian markets, in 2008.\n\n\nIn September 2006, Volkswagen began offering the City Golf and City Jetta only for the Canadian market. Both models were originally the Mk4 Golf and Jetta but were later replaced with the Brazilian versions of the Golf Mk4 and Bora. Volkswagen's introduction of such models is seen as a test of the market for a subcompact and, if successful, may be the beginnings of a thriving subcompact market for Volkswagen.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen Passat (3C)\nIn May 2011, Volkswagen completed Chattanooga Assembly in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The Chattanooga Assembly plant marked VW's first plant since the plant at New Stanton was closed down. The facility has produced Volkswagen cars and SUVs specifically designed for the North American markets, beginning with the Passat B7 in 2011. The company recently announced plans to expand further by investing $900\u00a0million to add floor space to the factory.[46]\n\n\nThe VW XL1 began a limited production run in 2013. The XL1 is a lightweight and fuel-efficient two-person vehicle (only 795\u00a0kg).\n\n\nThe Volkswagen Atlas, a large crossover SUV, began production in late 2016, and aimed to help end several years of losses for Volkswagen in the United States, the world's second-largest auto market.[47][48] On 14 September 2016, Volkswagen announced its partnership with three Israeli cybersecurity experts to create a new company, Cymotive, dedicated to automotive security.[49]\n\n\n\n### 2017\u2013present: Focus on electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen ID.3\nIn 2017, Volkswagen announced plans to place a considerable focus on electric vehicles (EV), with a goal to, by 2025, launch at least 30 EV models, and have 20 to 25 per cent of their total yearly sales volume (2\u20133 million) consist of EVs.[50] In September, Volkswagen CEO Matthias M\u00fcller stated that the company aimed to have electric versions of all of its vehicle models by 2030, at a cost of 20\u00a0billion euro, and 50\u00a0billion euro on acquisition of batteries.[51] On 6 March 2017 at the Geneva Motor Show Volkswagen presented its prototype for a fully autonomous car, Sedric.[52]\n\n\nVolkswagen returned to motorsport in 2018 by unveiling its all-electric I.D. R. At the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb, Romain Dumas set an all-time course record of just under eight minutes driving the I.D. R.[53]\n\n\nIn September 2018, Volkswagen announced that it would discontinue production of the Beetle (A5) in 2019.[54] Also in September 2018, Volkswagen announced its $100 million investment in Silicon Valley-based solid-state battery startup QuantumScape, becoming the startup's largest automotive investor and gaining representation on its board.[55]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Volkswagen announced that it would launch an entry-level Jetta sub-brand in China aimed at young buyers. Three models were announced in July 2019, a sedan and two SUVs,[56] all three of which will be manufactured in China as a part of Volkswagen's joint-venture with FAW.[57]\n\n\nIn September 2019 at the Frankfurt Motor Show, Volkswagen officially unveiled a refreshed logo (a thinner, two-dimensional version of the previous logo) and new sonic branding, which will accompany the newly launched ID.3 electric vehicle. Volkswagen stated that the ID.3 signified the start of a \"new era\" of the company.[58]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Volkswagen also announced a program to allow old Beetle models to be converted to run on electric power. The electric motor and battery updates will be done in partnership with German company eClassics.[59] The electric components used for retrofitting will be based upon those found in the e-up! model.\n\n\nIn November 2020, Volkswagen announced that, trying to remain the world's largest carmaker in the green era, it has increased its investment in electric and self-driving cars to $86 billion over the next five years.[60]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Volkswagen announced that its sales in 2020 dropped by 9.9% in China, 23.4% in western Europe and 17.1% in North America.[61]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Volkswagen announced that it would stop developing new internal combustion engines, although it would keep tweaking existing engines to comply with stricter emission rules.[62][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\nAlso, the company announced it was changing the American division's name to \"Voltswagen\", with the help of Johannes Leonardo, before revealing the move to be a hoax. In a tweet, the company said, the stunt \"got the whole world buzzing.\" However, some news sources considered the announcement to be real, including the Associated Press, whose headline about being fooled stated, \"Volkswagen caught lying again, this time about changing its name.\"[63]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Volkswagen released the ID. Buzz electric minivan.[64]\n\n\nOn May 11, 2022, Volkswagen confirmed the relaunch of its Scout off-road vehicle brand, this time as an EV.[65] Production is set to begin in 2026, and this relaunch will be the first time that VW creates a new brand based solely in the U.S. market.[66]\n\n\nIn July 2022 Volkswagen noted the development of the first of their own *Gigafactories*.[67] The site, based in Salzgitter in Germany, has been termed *Mission SalzGiga*. The new business unit is focused on all of Volkswagen's battery activities \"from raw materials and the cell right through to recycling\", and is part of a \u20ac20 billion investment.[67]\n\n\nOn Sep 2022 Volkswagen introduces the ID. XTREME1 off-road Electric concept Car, an off-road electric SUV.[68]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **appears to be slanted towards recent events.** Please try to keep recent events in historical perspective and add more content related to non-recent events. *(July 2017)*\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Global sales figures,2006\u20132018[69] |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | Sales (in millions) |\n| 2006\n | 5.7\n |\n| 2007\n | 6.2\n |\n| 2008\n | 6.3\n |\n| 2009\n | 6.3\n |\n| 2010\n | 7.3\n |\n| 2011\n | 8.4\n |\n| 2012\n | 9.3\n |\n| 2013\n | 9.7\n |\n| 2014\n | 10.2\n |\n| 2015\n | 10.0\n |\n| 2016\n | 10.3\n |\n| 2017\n | 10.7[70] |\n| 2018\n | 10.8[71] |\n| 2019\n | 11.0[72] |\n\n\nVolkswagen is the founding and namesake member of the Volkswagen Group, a large international corporation in charge of multiple car and truck brands, including Audi, SEAT, Porsche, Lamborghini, Bentley, Bugatti, Scania, MAN, and \u0160koda. Volkswagen Group's global headquarters are located in Volkswagen's historic home of Wolfsburg, Germany.[73][74]\n\n\nVolkswagen Group, as a unit, is Europe's largest motor vehicle manufacturer, with over 74,000 employees and over 7,700 dealerships.[75] For a long time, Volkswagen has had a market share over 20 per cent.[76]\n\n\nIn 2010, Volkswagen posted record sales of 6.29\u00a0million vehicles, with its global market share at 11.4%.[77] In 2008, Volkswagen became the third-largest car maker in the world,[78] and, as of 2016, Volkswagen was the second largest manufacturer worldwide.[79] In 2018 the company benefited from trade tariffs and new emission standards, with a record deliveries of 10.8 million vehicles.[80] Volkswagen Group's core markets include Germany and China.[81]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Volkswagen invested $2.6 billion in Argo AI, a startup focused on developing self-driving vehicles.[82]\n\n\n\n### International properties[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen logo evolution (1937\u20132019)\nVolkswagen has factories in many parts of the world, manufacturing or assembling vehicles for local markets. In addition to plants in Germany, Volkswagen has manufacturing or assembly facilities in Mexico, the United States, Slovakia, China, India, Russia (sold to the Russian company Avilon in 2023[83]), Malaysia, Brazil, Argentina, Portugal, Spain, Poland, the Czech Republic, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kenya and South Africa. In 2011, Volkswagen was named in the top 25 largest companies in the world by the Forbes Global 2000.[84][85]\n\n\nAs of May 2014, Volkswagen was planning to start assembling certain engines in India to increase localisation from 70% to 90%.[86]\n\n\nIn January 2016, Volkswagen announced the launch of a new factory in Algeria during a summit between Angela Merkel and Algerian prime minister Abdelmalek Sellal.[87] The factory was launched in Relizane, producing Volkswagen Golf VII, Volkswagen Polo, Volkswagen Caddy, SEAT Ibiza and \u0160koda Octavia cars.\n\n\nIn the 2021 review of WIPOTooltip World Intellectual Property Organization's annual World Intellectual Property Indicators VW ranked 6th in the world for its 84 industrial design registrations that were published under the Hague System during 2020.[88] This position is down on their previous 5th-place ranking for 73 industrial design registrations being published in 2019.[89][*third-party source needed*]\n\n\nSince 1985, Volkswagen has also run the Volkswagen AutoMuseum in Wolfsburg, which is dedicated to the history of the company.[90][*third-party source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Working conditions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Volkswagen worker organizations\n\nWith 120,000 employees in Germany,[91] VW is one of the most well organized labour represented companies in the world and Germany. The role that Works Councils and IG Metall play is unique even within Germany. VW workers have some of the strongest collective agreements. VW has a strong tradition and practice of social partnership and co-determination.[92]\n\n\nVolkswagen agreed in December 2011 to implement a rule passed by the company's Works Council aimed at improving work\u2013life balance and avoiding burnout by restricting company email functionality on the firm's BlackBerry smartphones to working periods and the half-hour before and after working periods. About 1,150 of Volkswagen's more than 190,000 employees in Germany were affected by the email restriction.[93]\n\n\nBecause of Volkswagen's use of IPPD,[94][95] a human contact allergen, in various polymers of their vehicles, they have coined the term \"Volkswagen dermatitis\".[96]\n\n\n\n### Relationship with Porsche and the Volkswagen Law[edit]\n\n\nVolkswagen has always had a close relationship with Porsche, the Zuffenhausen-based sports car manufacturer founded in 1931 by Ferdinand Porsche, the original Volkswagen designer and Volkswagen company co-founder, hired by Adolf Hitler for the project. The first Porsche car, the Porsche 64 of 1938, used many components from the Volkswagen Beetle. The 1948 Porsche 356 continued using many Volkswagen components, including a tuned engine, gearbox and suspension.\n\n\nThe two companies continued their collaboration in 1969 to make the VW-Porsche 914 and Porsche 914-6. (The 914-6 had a 6-cylinder Porsche engine, and the standard 914 had a Volkswagen engine.) Volkswagen and Porsche would collaborate again in 1976 on the Porsche 912-E (the USA only) and the Porsche 924, which used many Audi components and was built at Audi's Neckarsulm facilities. The 924 was originally designated for AUDI. Most Porsche 944 models were built there, although they used far fewer VW components.\n\n\nThe Porsche Cayenne, introduced in 2002, shares its entire chassis with the Volkswagen Touareg and Audi Q7, and is built at the same Volkswagen factory in Bratislava that the other SUVs are built.\n\n\nIn September 2005, Porsche announced it would increase its 5% stake in Volkswagen to 20% at a cost of \u20ac3\u00a0billion, with the intention that the combined stakes of Porsche and the government of Lower Saxony would ensure that any hostile takeover by foreign investors would be impossible.[97] Speculated suitors included DaimlerChrysler, BMW, and Renault. In July 2006, Porsche increased their ownership again to 25.1%.\n\n\nOn 4 March 2005, the European Commission brought an action against the Federal Republic of Germany before the European Court of Justice, claiming that the Volkswagen Law, which prevents any shareholder in Volkswagen from executing more than 20% of the total voting rights in the firm, was illegally restricting the flow of capital in Europe.[98] On 13 February 2007, Advocate General D\u00e1maso Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer submitted an opinion to the court in support of the action.[99] This again opened the possibility of a hostile takeover of VW and so on 26 March of the same year Porsche took its holding of Volkswagen shares to 30.9%. Porsche formally announced in a press statement that it did not intend to take over Volkswagen, but intended the move to avoid a competitor's taking a large stake and to stop hedge funds from dismantling VW.[100] As expected, on 22 October 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled in agreement with Ruiz-Jarabo and the law was struck down.[101][102] In October 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled that the VW law was illegal[103] because it was protectionist. At that time, Porsche held 31% of VW shares\u00a0\u2013 although a smaller proportion of voting rights, due to the Volkswagen Law\u00a0\u2013 and there had been speculation that Porsche would be interested in taking over VW if the law did not stand in its way. The court also prevented the government from appointing Volkswagen board members.[104] The German government then rewrote the Volkswagen law, only to be sued again.[105][106][107] In October 2013, the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled that the rewritten Volkswagen law \"complied in full\" with EU rules.[108]\n\n\nOn 26 October 2008, Porsche revealed its plan to assume control of VW. As of that day, it held 42.6% of Volkswagen's ordinary shares and stock options on another 31.5%. Combined with the state of Lower Saxony's 20.1% stake, this left only 5.8% of shares on the market\u2014mostly with index funds that could not legally sell.[109] Hedge funds desperate to cover their short positions forced Volkswagen stock above one thousand euros per share, briefly making it the world's largest company by market capitalisation on 28 October 2008.[110] By January 2009, Porsche had a 50.76% holding in Volkswagen AG, although the \"Volkswagen Law\" prevented it from taking control of the company.[111]\n\n\nOn 6 May 2009, the two companies decided to join, in a merger.\n\n\nOn 13 August, Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft's supervisory board signed the agreement to create an integrated automotive group with Porsche led by Volkswagen. The initial decision was for Volkswagen to take a 42.0% stake in Porsche AG by the end of 2009, and it would also see the family shareholders selling the automobile trading business of Porsche Holding Salzburg to Volkswagen.[112] In October 2009 however, Volkswagen announced that its percentage in Porsche would be 49.9% for a cost of \u20ac3.9\u00a0billion (the 42.0% deal would have cost \u20ac3.3\u00a0billion).[113] On 1 March 2011, Volkswagen has finalised the purchase of Porsche Holding Salzburg (PHS), Austria's leading specialty automobile distributor, for \u20ac3.3\u00a0billion ($4.55\u00a0billion).[114]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Volkswagen was overtaken by Tesla, Inc. as the second-most valuable auto maker.[115]\n\n\n\n## Product line[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Volkswagen vehicles\n\n\n\n| Best-selling Volkswagen models in 2022[116] |\n| --- |\n| Rank\n | Model\n | Production output\n |\n| 1\n | Tiguan | 604,536\n |\n| 2\n | Polo/Virtus/Vento/Ameo | 448,043\n |\n| 3\n | Passat/Magotan | 447,246\n |\n| 4\n | Lavida | 377,284\n |\n| 5\n | T-Roc | 322,211\n |\n| 6\n | T-Cross/Tacqua/Taigun | 315,036\n |\n| 7\n | Golf | 300,090\n |\n| 8\n | Jetta/Sagitar | 292,038\n |\n| 9\n | Atlas/Teramont | 217,771\n |\n| 10\n | Tharu/Taos | 216,397\n |\n\n\nThe Volkswagen brand produces various models which consists of global products and regional products, specifically for large markets including Europe, China and Latin America. Volkswagen AG annual report in 2022 reported that the best-selling model under the Volkswagen brand globally was the Tiguan, followed by the B-segment range of Polo, Virtus, Nivus and Taigo, and Passat/Magotan.[116]\n\n\n\n### Hatchbacks[edit]\n\n\nVolkswagen has been one of the leading manufacturer in terms of hatchback production, which traditionally has been a popular segment in Europe.[117][118] The brand offered a range of hatchbacks from A-segment, B-segment, and C-segment. The Golf traditionally has been the strongest selling vehicle for the brand in Europe, followed by the smaller Polo which apart from the European market also has a stronghold in emerging markets. Sales for the hatchback category has slowed down due to the rise of the SUV segment.[119][120]\n\n\n\n### SUVs/crossovers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen Tiguan has claimed the top spot in terms of sales figures within Volkswagen models.\nThe brand introduced its first crossover SUV in 2002 starting from the Touareg, a full-size luxury SUV. The brand SUV expansion continues with the release of Tiguan, a C-segment mainstream SUV in 2007. In the mid-2010s, the company decided to produce an SUV in every class of car that can justify one, which the brand called the \"SUV offensive\".[121] Between 2017 and 2020, the brand has aggressively expanded its SUV line-up by growing its number of models from 2 to 8 models, excluding its derivatives, ranging from B-segment, C-segment, and D-segment SUVs which include global models and regional models. Volkswagen also started producing derivatives of its SUV models with a rear sloping roof marketed as coup\u00e9 SUV which had gained popularity in China, the largest single market for the brand.[122][123]\n\n\nIn 2019, every fourth vehicle delivered by the Volkswagen brand today is an SUV, with its top contributor being the Tiguan. The brand plans to have over 30 SUV models on offer worldwide by 2025, contributing 50 per cent of its global sales.[124] Volkswagen also expects SUVs to lead the ID. family, its future electric vehicle range of models.[125]\n\n\nThe SUV expansion has claimed casualties in the MPV segment, which saw the Sharan mid-size MPV being phased out in 2020.[126]\n\n\n\n### Regional models[edit]\n\n\n#### Chinese market[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen Lavida was the best-selling sedan in China.\nVolkswagen is a market leader in China, which is the largest single automotive market in the world. In 2019, 3.16 million Volkswagen-branded vehicles were delivered in the country.[127] The importance of the market has justified a significant amount of China-specific models.\n\n\nSedans are a favoured segment in China due to their spacious interiors and boot space. In 2019, the brand sold 1.6 million of them in China. In the compact notchback or sedan segment, the brand is represented by several China-only models which include the Sagitar, Lamando, Bora, Santana, Lavida, and its derivatives in other body styles,[128] while the mid-size sedan segment is represented by the Passat and Magotan.[129][130] The Lavida was the best-selling model in China of all manufacturers in 2019 with 491,000 units sold.[131]\n\n\nThe popularity of SUVs also gave birth to several SUV models built or reworked specifically for China, including the Tharu, Tayron, Tayron X, Tiguan X, and reworked versions of the T-Cross and T-Roc.[132] The brand also has a strong presence in the premium or luxury segment including the Phideon and Viloran as the models developed specifically for China.[133][134]\n\n\nOn July 26, 2023, Volkswagen announced its investment of $700 million in Chinese EV maker XPeng for purchasing 4.99% stake of the company. The VW will collaborate with XPeng to develop two VW brand electric models for the mid-size segment in the Chinese market in 2026.[135][136]\n\n\n\n#### Brazilian market[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen Kombi was produced in Brazil from 1957 up to 2013.\nThe brand has a notable history in Brazil. Volkswagen's relationship with Brazil dates back to the early 1950s. In 1956, Volkswagen began by building a plant in S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, near S\u00e3o Paulo as its first manufacturing plant outside Germany as a response to the Brazil's ban on the import of completely assembled vehicles in 1950.[137] One year later, the plant started to produce the Kombi model \u2013 370 cars at that time, with a 50 per cent local content component share. Of 81 million vehicles produced over six decades in Brazil, 23 million of it was built by Volkswagen, which was produced by four passenger car factories in the country. In 2018, Volkswagen accounted for close on 15 per cent of the Brazilian car market.[138]\n\n\n\nThe importance of the Brazilian market gave birth to several models developed and manufactured by Volkswagen do Brasil, which include the Fox, Gol, Nivus, Saveiro, Virtus and Voyage. These models are also typically exported throughout Latin America. Historical vehicles built for the market include the Bras\u00edlia, SP1 & SP2, 1500/Variant/Variant II, Karmann Ghia TC, Parati and Suran.[139][140][141] The Gol, first launched in 1980, was the best-selling car in the country for 27 consecutive years, up until 2013.[137][138]\n\n\n### Environment-friendly vehicles[edit]\n\n\n#### Pure ethanol vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)VW pure ethanol prototype car developed by Volkswagen do Brasil in 1978\nVolkswagen do Brasil produced and sold pure ethanol-powered (E100 only) vehicles in Brazil, and production was discontinued only after they were supplanted by more modern Flex Fuel technology. As a response to the 1973 oil crisis, the Brazilian government began promoting bioethanol as a fuel, and the National Alcohol Program -*Pr\u00f3-\u00c1lcool*- (Portuguese: *Programa Nacional do \u00c1lcool*) was launched in 1975.[142][143][144] Compelled by the 1979 energy crisis, and after development and testing with government fleets by the CTA at S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, and further testing of several prototypes developed by the four local carmakers, including Volkswagen do Brasil, pure ethanol vehicles were launched in the Brazilian market.[142][143] Petrol engines were modified to support hydrous ethanol characteristics and changes included compression ratio, amount of fuel injected, replacement of materials that would get corroded by the contact with ethanol, use of colder spark plugs suitable for dissipating heat due to higher flame temperatures, and an auxiliary cold-start system that injects petrol from a small tank in the engine compartment to help starting when cold. Within six years, around 75% of all Brazilian passenger cars were manufactured with ethanol engines.[142][145]\n\n\nProduction and sales of pure ethanol vehicles tumbled beginning in 1987 owing to several factors, including a sharp decline in petrol prices as a result of the 1980s oil glut, and high sugar prices in the world market, shifting sugarcane ethanol production from fuel to sugar. By mid-1989, a shortage of ethanol fuel supply in the local market left thousands of vehicles in line at petrol stations or out of fuel in their garages, forcing consumers to abandon ethanol vehicles.[144][146]\n\n\n\n#### Flexible-fuel vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Gol Total Flex\nThe 2003 VW Gol 1.6 Total Flex was the first full flexible-fuel vehicle launched in Brazil, capable of running on any blend of petrol and E100. In March of that year, on its fiftieth anniversary, Volkswagen do Brasil launched in the local market the Gol 1.6 Total Flex, the first Brazilian commercial flexible fuel vehicle capable of running on any mix of E20-E25 petrol and up to 100% hydrous ethanol fuel (E100).[147][148][149][150] After the pure ethanol fiasco, consumer confidence in ethanol-powered vehicles was restored, allowing a rapid adoption of the flex technology. This was facilitated by the fuel distribution infrastructure already in place throughout Brazil, with more than 30 thousand fueling stations, a heritage of the *Pr\u00f3-\u00c1lcool* program[151]\n\n\nOwing to the success and rapid consumer acceptance of the flex-fuel versions, by 2005 VW had sold 293,523 flex-fuel cars and light-duty trucks, and only 53,074 petrol-only automobiles,[152] jumping to 525,838 flex-fuel vehicles and only 13,572 petrol-only cars and 248 petrol-only light trucks in 2007,[153] and reaching new car sales of 564,959 flex-fuel vehicles in 2008, representing 96% of all new cars and light-duty trucks sold in that year.[154] VW do Brasil stopped manufacturing petrol-only vehicles models for the local market in 2006,[148] and all of the remaining petrol-only Volkswagen models sold in Brazil are imported. The flex-fuel models currently produced for the local market are the Gol, Fox, CrossFox, Parati, Polo Hatch, Polo Sedan, Saveiro, Golf, and Kombi.[155] By March 2009, Volkswagen do Brasil had attained the milestone mark of two million flex-fuel vehicles produced since 2003.[156][157]\n\n\n\n#### Hybrid vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen Jetta Hybrid gets 48\u00a0mpg\u2011US (20.4\u00a0km/L) on highway.\nVolkswagen and Sanyo have teamed up to develop a battery system for hybrid cars.[158] Volkswagen head Martin Winterkorn has confirmed the company plans to build compact hybrid electric vehicles. He has stated \"There will definitely be compact hybrid models, such as Polo and Golf, and without any great delay\", with petrol and diesel power. For example, Golf is the ideal model to go hybrid as the Golf 1.4 TSI was recently awarded the \"Auto Environment Certificate\" by the Oko-Trend Institute for Environmental Research, and was considered one of the most environmentally friendly vehicles of 2007.[159] Also underway at Volkswagen's Braunschweig R&D facilities in Northern Germany is a hybrid version of the next-generation Touareg.[160]\n\n\nVW intends all future models to have the hybrid option. \"Future VW models will fundamentally also be constructed with hybrid concepts,\" VW head of development Ulrich Hackenberg told *Automobilwoche* in an interview. Hackenberg mentioned that the car based on the Up! concept seen at Frankfurt Motor Show,[161] as well as all future models, could be offered with either full or partial hybrid options. The rear-engine up! will go into production in 2011. Nothing has been said about plug-in hybrid options.[162]\n\n\nVolkswagen announced at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show the launch of the 2012 Touareg Hybrid, scheduled for 2011.[163][164] VW also announced plans to introduce diesel-electric hybrid versions of its most popular models in 2012, beginning with the new Jetta, followed by the Golf Hybrid in 2013 together with hybrid versions of the Passat.[165][166] In 2012, the Volkswagen Jetta Hybrid set the world record to become the fastest hybrid car at 187\u00a0mph (301\u00a0km/h).\n\n\n\n#### Plug-in electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2009, Volkswagen announced it has hired Karl-Thomas Neumann as its group chief officer for electric traction.[167] VW's Chief of research, J\u00fcrgen Leohold, said in 2010 the company has concluded hydrogen fuel-cell cars are not a viable option.[168][169]\n\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Golf GTE plug-in hybrid charging\nAs of May\u00a02016[update], the Volkswagen Group offers for retails customers nine plug-in electric cars, of which, three are all-electric cars: the Volkswagen e-Up!, e-Golf and Audi R8 e-tron, and six are plug-in hybrids: the Volkswagen Golf GTE, Passat GTE, Audi A3 Sportback e-tron, Q7 e-tron quattro, Porsche Panamera S E-Hybrid and Cayenne S E-Hybrid.[170] Also two limited production plug-in hybrids were manufactured beginning in 2013, the Volkswagen XL1 (250 units) and the Porsche 918 Spyder (918 units).[171][172] Total cumulative sales of all Volkswagen brand electrified cars since the start of their respective production is expected to reach about 103,000 by the end of 2016.[170] The Volkswagen ID.4 was launched in the U.S. in September 2020.\n\n\nIn order to comply with increasingly strict carbon dioxide emission limits in major markets, the VW Group expects to sell about one million all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles a year worldwide by 2025. The Group plans to expand its plug-in range with 20 new pure electric and plug-in hybrid cars, including two cars to compete with Tesla, Inc., the Porsche Mission E all-electric car and the Audi e-tron quattro, which is expected to become the brand's first mass-production electric vehicle. According to Thomas Ulbrich, VW brand production chief, the carmaker has the capacity to build as many as 75,000 battery-electric and plug-in hybrids a year if demand rises. Volkswagen announced in October 2015 that \"it will develop a modular architecture for battery-electric cars, called the MEB. The standardised system will be designed for all body structures and vehicle types and will allow the company to build emotionally appealing EVs with a range of up to 310\u00a0mi (500\u00a0km).\"[170] In June 2016, VW launched a program to develop 30 all-electric cars in 10 years, and sell 2\u20133\u00a0million electric cars per year by 2025.[173] Due to lower manpower requirements for electric motors than for piston engines, VW expects a gradual workforce reduction as numbers of electric cars increase.[174][175] VW considers battery factory ownership as too expensive.[176]\n\n\n\n### Flying vehicles[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Volkswagen issued a statement that \"vertical mobility\" could be the next step after self-driving technology. It announced that the company is exploring the feasibility of flying vehicles in China.[177]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen up! won the 2012 World Car of the Year.\nVolkswagen was named the fourth most influential car of the 20th century in the 1999 Car of the Century competition, for its Volkswagen Type 1 \"Beetle\" model.

Volkswagen also notched up several victories, and the championship in Formula Three.\n* In July 2011 Wolfgang D\u00fcrheimer told German magazine *Auto, Motor und Sport* that \"if [the VW group] is at the forefront of the auto industry, I can imagine us competing in Formula 1 in 2018. We have enough brands to pull it off.\"[182][183] They did not compete in F1 in 2018.\n\n\n### World Rally Championship[edit]\n\n\n* In 1981, now based in Hanover, VW took a new direction into rallying, with the launch of the first-generation Golf, and Sweden's Per Eklund, Frenchman Jean-Luc Th\u00e9rier, and the Finn Pentti Airikkala.

In 2004, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles entered the European Truck Racing series with the Volkswagen Titan truck\u00a0\u2013 it became a back-to-back champion for the 2004 and 2005 series.\n* United States: In 1976, Volkswagen entered the under-2000-cc Trans-Am Series, with the Scirocco, and they won their class outright.[184] Beginning in 2008 Volkswagen introduced the Jetta TDI Cup. The Jetta TDI Cup is an SCCA sanctioned race series that features 25 drivers between the ages of 16 and 26 driving slightly modified 2009 Jetta TDIs. The series features 10 events at 8 different road courses across North America. There is $50,000 prize money at stake over the course of the series in addition to the $100,000 prize awarded to the champion of the series at the conclusion of the last race.[185]\n* Argentina: Many Volkswagen models have competed in TC 2000, including the 1980 to 1983 champion Volkswagen 1500 and the 1994 champion Volkswagen Gol.\n* In 1999 and 2000, VW won the F2 Australian Rally Championship with the Golf GTI.\n* Finland: In 2002, VW won the Finnish Rally Championship in a7/(F2), with a Golf Mk4 KitCar, with Mikko Hirvonen.

It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903. The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand, and luxury cars under its Lincoln brand. Ford also owns a 32% stake in China's Jiangling Motors.[8] It also has joint ventures in China (Changan Ford), Taiwan (Ford Lio Ho), Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand), and Turkey (Ford Otosan). The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family; they have minority ownership but the majority of the voting power.[6][9]\n\n\nFord introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving assembly lines; by 1914, these methods were known around the world as Fordism. Ford's former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land Rover, acquired in 1989 and 2000, respectively, were sold to the Indian automaker Tata Motors in March 2008. Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010.[10] In 2011, Ford discontinued the Mercury brand, under which it had marketed entry-level luxury cars in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East since 1938.\n\n\nFord is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker (behind General Motors) and the sixth-largest in the world (behind Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Hyundai Motor Group, Stellantis, and General Motors) based on 2022 vehicle production.[11] At the end of 2010, Ford was the fifth-largest automaker in Europe.[12] The company went public in 1956 but the Ford family, through special Class B shares, still retain 40 percent of the voting rights.[6][13] During the financial crisis of 2007\u201308, the company struggled financially but did not have to be rescued by the federal government, unlike the other two major US automakers.[14][15] Ford Motors has since returned to profitability,[16] and was the eleventh-ranked overall American-based company in the 2018 Fortune 500 list, based on global revenues in 2017 of $156.7\u00a0billion.[17] In 2008, Ford produced 5.532\u00a0million automobiles[18] and employed about 213,000 employees at around 90 plants and facilities worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Ford Motor Company\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founder Henry Ford c. 1919\nThe Henry Ford Company was Henry Ford's first attempt at a car manufacturing company and was established on November 3, 1901. This became the Cadillac Motor Company on August 22, 1902, after Ford left with the rights to his name.[19] The Ford Motor Company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with $28,000 (equivalent to $950,000 in 2023) in cash from twelve investors, most notably John and Horace Dodge (who would later found their own car company). The first president was not Ford, but local banker John S. Gray, who was chosen in order to assuage investors' fears that Ford would leave the new company the way he had left its predecessor. During its early years, the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on Mack Avenue and later at its factory on Piquette Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Groups of two or three men worked on each car, assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford. Within a decade the company led the world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept, and Ford soon brought much of the part production in-house (vertical integration).\n\n\nHenry Ford was 39 years old when he founded the Ford Motor Company, which would go on to become one of the world's largest and most profitable companies. It has been in continuous family control for over 100 years and is one of the largest family-controlled companies in the world.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe first gasoline-powered automobile had been created in 1885 by the German inventor Karl Benz (Benz Patent-Motorwagen). More efficient production methods were needed to make automobiles affordable for the middle class, to which Ford contributed by, for instance, introducing the first moving assembly line in 1913 at the Ford factory in Highland Park.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)A 1910 Model T (introduced in 1908), photographed in Salt Lake City\nBetween 1903 and 1908, Ford produced the Models A, B, C, F, K, N, R, and S. Hundreds or a few thousand of most of these were sold per year. In 1908, Ford introduced the mass-produced Model T, which totaled millions sold over nearly 20 years. In 1927, Ford replaced the T with the Model A, the first car with safety glass in the windshield.[20] Ford launched the first low-priced car with a V8 engine in 1932.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn an attempt to compete with General Motors' mid-priced Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick, Ford created the Mercury in 1939 as a higher-priced companion car to Ford. Henry Ford purchased the Lincoln Motor Company in 1922, in order to compete with such brands as Cadillac and Packard for the luxury segment of the automobile market.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1929, Ford was contracted by the government of the Soviet Union to set up the Gorky Automobile Plant in Russia initially producing Ford Model A and AAs thereby playing an important role in the industrialization of that country.[21]\n\n\n\n![](image)B-24 Liberator bombers being mass-produced at Ford's Willow Run assembly plant in 1944\nDuring World War II, the United States Department of War picked Ford to mass-produce the Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber at its Willow Run assembly plant.[22] Ford Werke and Ford SAF (Ford's subsidiaries in Germany and France, respectively) produced military vehicles and other equipment for Nazi Germany's war effort. Some of Ford's operations in Germany at the time were run using forced labor.\n\n\nThe creation of a scientific laboratory in Dearborn, Michigan, in 1951, doing unfettered basic research, led to Ford's unlikely involvement in superconductivity research. In 1964, Ford Research Labs made a key breakthrough with the invention of a superconducting quantum interference device or SQUID.[23]\n\n\nFord offered the Lifeguard safety package from 1956, which included such innovations as a standard deep-dish steering wheel, optional front, and, for the first time in a car, rear seatbelts, and an optional padded dash.[24] Ford introduced child-proof door locks into its products in 1957, and, in the same year, offered the first retractable hardtop on a mass-produced six-seater car.[25]\n\n\nIn late 1955, Ford established the Continental division as a separate luxury car division. This division was responsible for the manufacture and sale of the famous Continental Mark II. At the same time, the Edsel division was created to design and market that car starting with the 1958 model year. Due to limited sales of the Continental and the Edsel disaster, Ford merged Mercury, Edsel, and Lincoln into \"M-E-L,\" which reverted to \"Lincoln-Mercury\" after Edsel's November 1959 demise.[25]\n\n\nThe Ford Mustang was introduced on April 17, 1964, during New York World's Fair (where Ford had a pavilion made by The Walt Disney Company).[26][27] In 1965, Ford introduced the seat belt reminder light.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith the 1980s, Ford introduced several highly successful vehicles around the world. During the 1980s, Ford began using the advertising slogan, \"Have you driven a Ford, lately?\" to introduce new customers to their brand and make their vehicles appear more modern. In 1990 and 1994, respectively, Ford also acquired Jaguar Cars and Aston Martin.[28] During the mid-to-late 1990s, Ford continued to sell large numbers of vehicles, in a booming American economy with a soaring stock market and low fuel prices.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith the dawn of the new century, legacy health care costs, higher fuel prices, and a faltering economy led to falling market shares, declining sales, and diminished profit margins. Most of the corporate profits came from financing consumer automobile loans through Ford Motor Credit Company.[29]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)William Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of Henry Ford, serves as the executive chairman at the board of Ford Motor Company.\nBy 2005, both Ford and GM's corporate bonds had been downgraded to junk status[30] as a result of high U.S. health care costs for an aging workforce, soaring gasoline prices, eroding market share, and an overdependence on declining SUV sales. Profit margins decreased on large vehicles due to increased \"incentives\" (in the form of rebates or low-interest financing) to offset declining demand.[31] In the latter half of 2005, Chairman Bill Ford asked newly appointed Ford Americas Division President Mark Fields to develop a plan to return the company to profitability. Fields previewed the plan, named *The Way Forward*, at the board meeting of the company on December 7, 2005, and it was unveiled to the public on January 23, 2006. \"The Way Forward\" included resizing the company to match market realities, dropping some unprofitable and inefficient models, consolidating production lines, closing 14 factories and cutting 30,000 jobs.[32]\n\n\nFord moved to introduce a range of new vehicles, including \"Crossover SUVs\" built on unibody car platforms, rather than more body-on-frame chassis. In developing the hybrid electric powertrain technologies for the Ford Escape Hybrid SUV, the company licensed similar Toyota hybrid technologies[33] in order to avoid patent infringements.[34] Ford announced that it would team up with electricity supply company Southern California Edison (SCE) to examine the future of plug-in hybrids in terms of how home and vehicle energy systems will work with the electrical grid. Under the multimillion-dollar, multi-year project, Ford is to convert a demonstration fleet of Ford Escape Hybrids into plug-in hybrids, and SCE is to evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid. Some of the vehicles are to be evaluated \"in typical customer settings\", according to Ford.[35][36]\n\n\nWilliam Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of Henry Ford (and better known by his nickname \"Bill\"), was appointed executive chairman in 1998, and also became chief executive officer of the company in 2001, with the departure of Jacques Nasser, becoming the first member of the Ford family to head the company since the retirement of his uncle, Henry Ford II, in 1982. Ford sold motorsport engineering company Cosworth to Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven in 2004, the start of a decrease in Ford's motorsport involvement. Upon the retirement of president and chief operations officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed his roles as well. Five months later, in September, Ford named Alan Mulally as president and CEO, with Ford continuing as executive chairman. In December 2006, the company raised its borrowing capacity to about $25\u00a0billion, placing substantially all corporate assets as collateral.[37] Chairman Bill Ford has stated that \"bankruptcy is not an option\".[38] Ford and the United Auto Workers, representing approximately 46,000 hourly workers in North America, agreed to a historic contract settlement in November 2007 giving the company a substantial break in terms of its ongoing retiree health care costs and other economic issues. The agreement included the establishment of a company-funded, independently run Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust to shift the burden of retiree health care from the company's books, thereby improving its balance sheet. This arrangement took effect on January 1, 2010. As a sign of its currently strong cash position, Ford contributed its entire current liability (estimated at US$5.5\u00a0billion as of December 31, 2009) to the VEBA in cash, and also pre-paid US$500\u00a0million of its future liabilities to the fund. The agreement also gave hourly workers the job security they were seeking by having the company commit to substantial investments in most of its factories.\n\n\n\n![](image)Horton Classic Car Museum, Nocona, Texas.\nThe automaker reported the largest annual loss in company history in 2006 of $12.7\u00a0billion,[39] and estimated that it would not return to profitability until 2009.[40] However, Ford surprised Wall Street in the second quarter of 2007 by posting a $750\u00a0million profit. Despite the gains, the company finished the year with a $2.7\u00a0billion loss, largely attributed to finance restructuring at Volvo.[41]\n\n\nOn June 2, 2008, Ford sold its Jaguar and Land Rover operations to Tata Motors for $2.3\u00a0billion.[42][43]\n\n\nDuring congressional hearings held in November 2008 at Washington D.C., Ford's Alan Mulally stated that \"We at Ford are hopeful that we have enough liquidity. But we also must prepare ourselves for the prospect of further deteriorating economic conditions\". He went on to state that \"The collapse of one of our competitors would have a severe impact on Ford\" and that Ford Motor Company supported both Chrysler and General Motors in their search for government bridge loans in the face of conditions caused by the 2008 financial crisis.[44][45] Together, the three companies presented action plans for the sustainability of the industry. Mulally stated that \"In addition to our plan, we are also here today to request support for the industry. In the near-term, Ford does not require access to a government bridge loan. However, we request a credit line of $9 billion as a critical backstop or safeguard against worsening conditions as we drive transformational change in our company\".[46] GM and Chrysler received government loans and financing through T.A.R.P. legislation funding provisions.[47]\n\n\nOn December 19, the cost of credit default swaps to insure the debt of Ford was 68 percent of the sum insured for five years, in addition to annual payments of 5 percent. That meant $6.8\u00a0million paid upfront to insure $10\u00a0million in debt, in addition to payments of $500,000 per year.[48] In January 2009, Ford reported a $14.6\u00a0billion loss in the preceding year, a record for the company. The company retained sufficient liquidity to fund its operations. Through April 2009, Ford's strategy of debt-for-equity exchanges erased $9.9 billion in liabilities (28% of its total) in order to leverage its cash position.[49] These actions yielded Ford a $2.7\u00a0billion profit in fiscal year 2009, the company's first full-year profit in four years.[50] In 2012, Ford's corporate bonds were upgraded from junk to investment grade again, citing sustainable, lasting improvements.[51]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2012, Ford announced the sale of its climate control components business, its last remaining automotive components operation, to Detroit Thermal Systems LLC for an undisclosed price.[52]\n\n\nOn November 1, 2012, Ford announced that CEO Alan Mulally would stay with the company until 2014. Ford also named Mark Fields, its president of operations in the Americas, as its new chief operating officer[53] Mulally was paid a compensation of over $174 million in his previous seven years at Ford since 2006. The generous amount has been a sore point for some workers of the company.[54]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Ford announced a plan to modernize its Dearborn engineering and headquarters campuses through a ten-year building project. The result would see the number of Ford employees working in these areas doubling, to 24,000. During construction, some 2000 of the employees were relocated out of the campus to a temporary location in a disused section of the local shopping mall.[55] Facilities would also be altered to allow ride-sharing and electric and self-driving vehicles.[56] Estimates of the construction cost were $1.2 billion.[57]\n\n\n\n![](image)The historic, once abandoned Michigan Central Station was purchased by Ford Motor Company in May 2018 and is expected to undergo a significant four-year renovation.\nOn January 3, 2017, Ford CEO Mark Fields announced that in a \"vote of confidence\" because of the pro-business climate being fostered in part by President-elect Donald Trump, Ford had canceled plans to invest $1.6 billion in a new plant in Mexico to manufacture the Ford Focus; instead, the company would invest $700 million in Michigan, which it planned to use to create 700 new jobs. The Focus would now be manufactured in the existing plant in Mexico.[58] Also in 2017, Ford began development of a new mixed-use urban campus in the Corktown neighborhood of Detroit, with its purchase, renovation, and occupation of The Factory at Michigan and Rosa Parks. The new site was expected to have a major focus on the development of autonomous vehicle and electric vehicle technology.[59] Ford later began buying up other parcels of land in Corktown including a very high-profile purchase of Michigan Central Station which is planned to become the hub of their Corktown campus, and the adjacent Roosevelt Warehouse.[60] Ford expects to move 2,500 of its employees, roughly 5 percent of its southeast Michigan workforce, to the campus with space for an additional 2,500 entrepreneurs, technology companies and partners.[61] Bill Ford envisioned the first-floor concourse of the train station to be a public gathering place with retail outlets and restaurants.[62]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Ford Motor Co. acquired majority ownership of Argo AI, a self-driving car startup.[63]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Ford announced cuts to its global workforce amid efforts to address the company's declining share price and to improve profits. The company is targeting $3 billion in cost reduction and a nearly 10% reduction in the salaried workforce in Asia and North America to enhance earnings in 2018.[64][65] Jim Hackett was announced to replace Mark Fields as CEO of Ford Motor. Mr. Hackett most recently oversaw the formation of Ford Smart Mobility, a unit responsible for experimenting with car-sharing programs, self-driving ventures and other programs aimed at helping Ford better compete with Uber, Alphabet Inc. and other tech giants looking to edge in on the auto industry.[66][67]\n\n\nOn April 25, 2018, Ford announced that it would discontinue passenger cars in the North American market in the next four years, except for the Mustang, due to declining demand and profitability.[68] The Focus Active, a crossover SUV based on the newly unveiled fourth-generation Focus, was also intended to be marketed in the United States. Due to the vehicle being manufactured in China, Ford later announced that it would not release the Focus Active in the United States, due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese exports.[69][70]\n\n\nIn March 2020, the Detroit United Auto Workers union announced that after discussion with the leaders of General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the carmakers would partially shut down factories on a \"rotating\" basis to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.[71] On March 24, representatives of Ford announced that production in the US, Canada, and Mexico would not resume on March 30 as originally planned, amid the further coronavirus pandemic spread.[72] In the first quarter of 2020, Ford's sales dropped by 15%, entailing the loss of $2 billion.[73]\n\n\nWith the change in the demand for the sport vehicles, on January 6, 2021, Ford reported a sales fall of 9.8% in the fourth quarter, selling 542,749 vehicles, compared to 601,862 in 2019.[74]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Ford said that it would provide COVID-19 vaccines for its employees, who were to obtain them at the company; at the beginning the vaccination program would be in southeast Michigan, Missouri and Ohio, but it was to be expanded later on to other locations.[75]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Ford announced that it would restructure the company into three separate divisions. Ford Model E is to focus on electric vehicles; Ford Blue is to focus on internal combustion vehicles; and the existing commercial division is to be rebranded as Ford Pro, to focus on vehicle distribution and service.[76][7]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Ford announced it planned layoffs of roughly 3,000 employees and contract workers, confirming earlier reporting. The cuts would mostly affect divisions in the US, Canada, and India, which Jim Farley said would allow the company to prepare for the future of electric, software-heavy vehicles.[77][78]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Ford announced that it was going to cut 3,800 jobs across Europe, with the job cuts mainly focusing on their German and British workforce. Ford will be cutting 2,300 jobs from Germany, 1,300 from the United Kingdom, and an additional 200 jobs in the rest of Europe, according to the head of Ford Germany, Martin Sander. The cuts will mainly be done to the company's engineers.[79]\n\n\nFord announced that their electric vehicle business had lost $3 billion before taxes over the past two years and will lose a similar amount in 2023 as the company looks to significantly invest in Electric Technology. The Ford Model E is expected to be profitable by 2026.[80]\n\n\nIn April 2023, United Kingdom ministers approved Ford's BlueCruise technology. Because of this assisted driving technology, Ford drivers can now legally take their hands off the wheel on certain roads. Its top speed is 129\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph). BlueCruise uses sensors and cameras to regulate the car's speed and to keep track of speed limits and road signs. It also monitors and keeps a safe distance from other vehicles. It also comes equipped with an eye-tracking system. If the driver stops looking at the road then the car will gradually reduce its speed. This technology will initially be offered in Ford's 2023 model of the electric Mustang Mach-E SUV. \nAccording to Thatcham Research, an automotive research company, this model is not a self-driving car. It is classified as a level 2 or partial automation assistance system. This means that technology controls two or more driving aspects but still requires human driver control in cases of emergencies. The driver is still legally responsible for accidents.[81]\n\n\n\n### Logo evolution[edit]\n\n\n* ![1903](image)\n\n1903\n* ![1907](image)\n\n1907\n* ![1909](image)\n\n1909\n* ![1911](image)\n\n1911\n* ![1912](image)\n\n1912\n* ![1912 variant](image)\n\n1912 variant\n* ![1927](image)\n\n1927\n* ![1957](image)\n\n1957\n* ![1976](image)\n\n1976\n* ![2003](image)\n\n2003\n* ![2017](image)\n\n2017\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n### Executive management[edit]\n\n\nMembers of the Ford board as of March\u00a02023[update] are: William Clay Ford Jr. (executive chairman), Jim Farley (president and CEO), Kimberly Casiano, Alexandra Ford English (daughter of William Clay Ford Jr.), Henry Ford III (son of Edsel Ford II), William W. Helman IV, Jon Huntsman Jr., William E. Kennard, John C. May, Beth E. Mooney, John L. Thornton, John Veihmeyer, Lynn Vojvodich Radakovich, and John S. Weinberg.[82]\n\n\nJim Farley succeeded Jim Hackett as the chief executive officer of the company in August, 2020; he previously served as Ford's chief operating officer. Hackett stayed in the company as an advisor until the second quarter of 2021.[83]\n\n\n\n## Ford Motor Company Fund[edit]\n\n\nThe Ford Motor Company Fund (also known as Ford Fund, not affiliated with the Ford Foundation), based in Dearborn, Michigan, is the philanthropic arm of the Ford Motor Company.[84] Established in 1949[85] by Henry Ford II,[*citation needed*] Ford Fund is a nonprofit corporate foundation[86] financed by contributions from Ford Motor Company. In 2017, Ford Fund contributed $63 million[87] to various causes[84] with a focus on education, driving safely and community building.\n\n\nThe Ford Driving Skills for Life program is a driver safety program aimed at teens that were developed together with the Governors Highway Safety Association and safety experts.[88] The Ford Volunteer Corps allows Ford employees and retirees to sign up for volunteering work on local projects in more than 40 countries.[89] The Ford Fund invests $18 million annually in education in the United States and around the world, but accepts applications only from nonprofit organizations registered in the U.S.[90] Education programs and scholarships include Alan Mulally Engineering Scholarship, Ford Blue Oval Scholars Program, Ford College Community Challenge (Ford C3), Ford Driving Dreams Tour, Ford Fund/Detroit Free Press Journalism Scholarship, Ford Next Generation Learning (Ford NGL), Grants to Individuals Program, HBCU Community Challenge, Smithsonian Latino Center Young Ambassadors Program, and William Clay Ford Automotive Design Scholarship.\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nFord has had manufacturing operations worldwide, including in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, and South Africa. Ford also helped the Soviet Union to construct Russian automaker GAZ.\n\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford dealer in Garden City, New York, c. 1930\u20131945\nIn May 2010, Ford reported that its sales increased 23% for the month, and that 37% of its sales came from fleet sales.[91] In June 2010, sales to individual customers at dealerships increased 13% while fleet sales rose by 32%.[92] In the first seven months of 2010, fleet sales of Ford for the same period rose 35% to 386,000 units while retail sales increase 19%.[93] Fleet sales account for 39 percent of Chrysler's sales and 31 percent for GM's.[93]\n\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford of Europe\n\n![](image)The Ford Research Center in Aachen, Germany, photographed in 2006\nAt first, Ford in Germany and Ford in Britain built different models from one another until 1965, when the Ford Transit and later the Ford Escort and the Ford Capri became common to both companies. In 1970, the Ford Taunus and the Ford Cortina came into production with a common base construction, both models being produced in left hand drive and right hand drive. Later on, the models became identical and the respective models right- and left-hand-drive exclusively. Rationalisation of model ranges meant that production of many models in the UK switched to elsewhere in Europe, including Belgium and Spain as well as Germany. The Ford Sierra replaced the Taunus and Cortina in 1982, drawing criticism for its radical aerodynamic styling, which was soon given nicknames, the \"Jellymould\" and \"The Salesman's Spaceship.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)Ford's Dunton Technical Centre in Laindon, United Kingdom, the largest automotive research and development facility in the country,[94] pictured in 2006\nIn February 2002, Ford ended car production in the UK. It was the first time in 90 years that Ford cars had not been made in Britain, although production of the Transit van continued at the company's Southampton facility until mid-2013, engines at Bridgend and Dagenham, and transmissions at Halewood. Development of European Ford is broadly split between Dunton in Essex (powertrain, Fiesta/Ka, and commercial vehicles) and Cologne (body, chassis, electrical, Focus, Mondeo) in Germany. Ford also produced the Thames range of commercial vehicles, although the use of this brand name was discontinued with the introduction of the Ford Transit in 1965. Elsewhere in continental Europe, Ford assembles the Mondeo, Galaxy, S-Max[95] and Kuga[96] in Valencia (Spain), Fiesta in Cologne (Germany), Focus in Saarlouis (Germany), Ecosport[97] and Puma[98] in Craiova (Romania).\n\n\nFord also owns a joint-venture production plant in Turkey. Ford Otosan, established in the 1970s, manufactures the Transit Connect compact panel van as well as the \"Jumbo\" and long-wheelbase versions of the full-size Transit. This new production facility was set up near Kocaeli in 2002, and its opening marked the end of Transit assembly in Genk.\n\n\nAnother joint venture plant near Set\u00fabal in Portugal, set up in collaboration with Volkswagen, formerly assembled the Galaxy people-carrier as well as its sister ships, the VW Sharan and SEAT Alhambra. With the introduction of the third generation of the Galaxy, Ford has moved the production of the people-carrier to the Genk plant, with Volkswagen taking over sole ownership of the Set\u00fabal facility.\n\n\nIn 2008, Ford acquired a majority stake in Automobile Craiova, Romania. Starting 2009, the Ford Transit Connect was Ford's first model produced in Craiova, followed, in 2012, by low-capacity car engines and a new small class car, the B-Max.[99]\n\n\nIts 1959 Anglia two-door saloon was one of the most quirky-looking small family cars in Europe at the time of its launch, but buyers soon became accustomed to its looks and it was hugely popular with British buyers in particular. It was still selling well when replaced by the more practical Escort in 1967.\n\n\nThe third incarnation of the Ford Escort was launched in 1980 and marked the company's move from rear-wheel-drive saloons to front-wheel-drive hatchbacks in the small family car sector.\n\n\nThe fourth-generation Escort was produced from 1990 until 2000, although its successor\u2014the Focus\u2014had been on sale since 1998. On its launch, the Focus was arguably the most dramatic-looking and fine-handling small family cars on sale and sold in huge volumes right up to the launch of the next-generation Focus at the end of 2004.\n\n\nThe 1982 Ford Sierra\u2014replacement for the long-running and massively popular Cortina and Taunus models\u2014was a style-setter at the time of its launch. Its ultramodern aerodynamic design was a world away from a boxy, sharp-edged Cortina, and it was massively popular just about everywhere it was sold. A series of updates kept it looking relatively fresh until it was replaced by the front-wheel-drive Mondeo at the start of 1993.\n\n\nThe rise in popularity of small cars during the 1970s saw Ford enter the mini-car market in 1976 with its Fiesta hatchback. Most of its production was concentrated at Valencia in Spain, and the Fiesta sold in huge figures from the very start. An update in 1983 and the launch of an all-new model in 1989 strengthened its position in the small car market.\n\n\nOn October 24, 2012, Ford announced that it would close its Genk assembly plant in eastern Belgium by the end of 2014.[100]\n\n\nIn 2015, Ford announced that it took control of Ford Sollers, Ford's joint venture with Russian company Sollers.[101][102]\n\n\nIn September 2018, at the IAA Commercial Vehicles show in Hannover, Germany, Ford introduced an electric tractor-trailer concept vehicle dubbed the F-Vision, which would have Level 4 autonomous driving capability.[103]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2022, Ford announced that it was suspending its Sollers joint venture operation in Russia, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[104][105] On October 26, 2022, Ford sold its 49 percent share in the joint venture, and exited the Russian market,[106] adding that it retains the option to buy them back within a 5-year period \u201cshould the global situation change.[107]\n\n\n\n### East and Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\nFord formed its first passenger-vehicle joint venture in China in 2001, six years behind GM and more than a decade after VW. It has spent as of 2013[update] $4.9 billion to expand its lineup and double production capacity in China to 600,000 vehicles. This includes Ford's largest-ever factory complex in the southwestern city of Chongqing. Ford had 2.5% of the Chinese market in 2013, while VW controlled 14.5% and GM had 15.6%, according to consultant LMC Automotive. GM outsells Ford in China by more than six-to-one.[108] Ford's presence in Asia has traditionally been much smaller, confined to Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Taiwan, where Ford has had a joint venture with Lio Ho since the 1970s. Ford began assembly of cars in Thailand in 1960, but withdrew from the country in 1976, and did not return until 1995 when it formed a joint venture with Mazda called Auto Alliance.[109] Now based in the Bo-win Sub District of the Sriracha District in Chonburi, the factory still produces passenger automobiles. The factory, built in 1941 in Singapore, was soon taken over by the Japanese during the war and was the site of a surrender of the British to the Japanese, at the factory site which is now a national monument in Singapore.\nOn April 30, 2013, Ford Motor Co. launched their car and truck line in Myanmar. Previously, heavy importation taxes had stifled imported car purchases in Myanmar, but due to currency reform, lifting of previous import restrictions, and the abolishment of shadow currency, Myanmar's car market had grown in demand.[110]\n\n\n\n#### South Korea[edit]\n\n\nIn 1967, Ford partnered with the South Korean company Hyundai, and at the new factory in Ulsan, South Korea, built the European Ford Cortina until 1974 when Hyundai introduced their all-new Hyundai Pony in 1975. Ford then developed a relationship with Korea's oldest car manufacturer Kia which built vehicles co-engineered with Mazda, later selling the Ford Festiva from 1988 to 1993, and the Ford Aspire from 1994 to 1997 for export to the United States. With the acquisition of a stake in Japanese manufacturer Mazda in 1979, Ford began selling Mazda's Familia and Capella as the Ford Laser and Telstar throughout the region, replacing the European-sourced Escort and Cortina. From 1989 to 1996, Kia imported the Mercury Sable from Ford in the U.S. and sold them in South Korea as the Kia Sable. Though the Sable was branded and marketed as a Kia, it retained the Mercury badges and emblem. Ford lost their Kia interest to Hyundai in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. Kia had declared bankruptcy in 1997; in 1998, Hyundai Motor Company acquired 51% of the company, outbidding Ford which had owned an interest in Kia Motors since 1986.[111] After subsequent divestments,[112] Hyundai Motor Company owns less than 50% of the company but remains Kia's largest stakeholder.\n\n\nAs of 2020[update], Ford sells the Explorer, Mondeo, and Mustang,[113] as well as the Lincoln Aviator, Continental, Corsair, MKZ, and Nautilus in South Korea.[114]\n\n\n\n### South and West Asia[edit]\n\n\nFord India began production in 1998 at Chennai, Tamil Nadu, with its Ford Escort model, which was later replaced by the locally produced Ford Ikon in 2001. It has since added the Fusion, Fiesta, Mondeo and Endeavour models to its product line.\n\n\nOn March 9, 2010, Ford launched its first made-for-India compact car. Starting at \u20b9349,900, the Figo was Ford's first car designed and priced for the mass Indian market.[115] On July 28, 2011, Ford India signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the State of Gujarat for the construction of an assembly and engine plant in Sanand and planned to invest approximately US$1 billion on a 460-acre site.[116] In 2019, the company and Mahindra & Mahindra formed a joint venture to develop, market and distribute Ford-branded vehicles in India.[117] In September 2021 Ford India announced plans to shut down both its assembly plants. The company said that it intends to maintain its parts and service network.[118]\n\n\nFord's market presence in the Middle East has traditionally been small, partly due to previous Arab boycotts of companies dealing with Israel. Ford and Lincoln vehicles are currently marketed in ten countries in the region.[119] Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates are the biggest markets. Ford also established itself in Egypt in 1926 but faced an uphill battle during the 1950s due to the hostile nationalist business environment.[120] Ford's distributor in Saudi Arabia announced in February 2003 that it had sold 100,000 Ford and Lincoln vehicles since commencing sales in November 1986. Half of the Ford and Lincoln vehicles sold in that country were Ford Crown Victorias.[121] In 2004, Ford sold 30,000 units in the region, falling far short of General Motors' 88,852 units and Nissan Motors' 75,000 units.\n\n\n\n### South America[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford assembly plant in General Pacheco, Argentina, as seen in the 1960s\nIn South America, Ford's primary operations are in Brazil, Argentina, and Ford Andina[122] (Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela). Ford employs over 18,000 people and operates seven assembly or other plants in the region.[123] In 1987, Ford Brasil and Ford Motor Argentina merged their operations with the Brazilian and Argentine operations of Volkswagen Group, forming a new joint-venture company called Autolatina with a shared model range.[124] Autolatina was dissolved in 1995.[124]\n\n\nIn early 2021, Ford's Brazil branch announced it would completely cease production in the country over the course of a few months.[125]\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\nIn Africa, Ford's market presence has traditionally been strongest in South Africa and neighbouring countries, with only trucks being sold elsewhere on the continent. Ford in South Africa began by importing kits from Canada to be assembled at its facility in Port Elizabeth; the company later sourced its models from the UK and Australia, with local versions of the Ford Cortina including the XR6, with a 3.0 V6 engine, and a Cortina-based 'bakkie' or pick-up, which was exported to the UK. In the mid-1980s Ford merged with a rival company, owned by Anglo American, to form the South African Motor Corporation (Samcor).[126]\n\n\nFollowing international condemnation of apartheid, Ford divested from South Africa in 1988, and sold its stake in Samcor, although it licensed the use of its brand name to the company.[127] Samcor began to assemble Mazdas as well, which affected its product line-up and saw the European Fords like the Escort and Sierra replaced by the Mazda-based Laser[128] and Telstar.[129] Ford bought a 45 per cent stake in Samcor following the demise of apartheid in 1994, and this later became, once again, a wholly owned subsidiary, the Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa. Ford now sells a local sedan version of the Fiesta (also built in India and Mexico), and the Focus. The Falcon model from Australia was also sold in South Africa, but was dropped in 2003; the Mondeo, after briefly being assembled locally, was dropped in 2005. The Mondeo was later reintroduced in 2015, badged as the Fusion, but was dropped in 2017.[130]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nFord Research and Innovation Center is the name of the technology research facilities of Ford Motor Company in\n\n\n\n* Dearborn, Michigan\n* Palo Alto, California\n* Aachen, Germany\n* Nanjing, China\n\n\nThe Ford Research and Innovation Center in Palo Alto was first opened in 2012, and in January 2015, announced plans to significantly expand its operations.[131][132][133][134]\n\n\n\n## Former operations[edit]\n\n\n### East and Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\nFord decided to shut down their entire operations in Indonesia, including their dealer network by second half of 2016.[135][136]\n\n\n\n#### Ford of Japan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford Motor Company of Japan\n\nFord established a manufacturing facility in the port city of Yokohama in February 1925, where Model T vehicles were assembled using imported knock-down kits.[137] The factory subsequently produced 10,000 Model A's up to 1936. Production ceased in 1940 as a result of political tensions between Japan and the United States.\n\n\nAfter World War II, Ford did not have a presence in Japan, as the Ford facility was appropriated by the Japanese Government until 1958 when property was returned as a possession of the Ford Motor Company and became a research and development location for Ford partner Mazda. In 1979, Ford acquired a 24.5% ownership stake in Mazda, and in 1982, Ford and Mazda jointly established a sales channel to sell Ford products in Japan, including vehicles manufactured in North America, at a dealership called *Autorama (Japanese)*. The Autorama sales channel was renamed Ford Sales of Japan in 1997.[138]\n\n\nVehicles sold at *Autorama* locations were the North American assembled Ford Explorer, Probe (1989\u20131998), Mustang, Taurus (1989\u20131997), Thunderbird (1990\u20131993), Lincoln Continental, and Lincoln LS. Ford products manufactured in Europe that were sold in Japan were the Ford Mondeo, Ka, Focus, Focus C-MAX, Fiesta, and the Galaxy. Mazda manufactured Ford vehicles in Japan and sold them as Fords at the Autorama locations. They were the Ford Telstar (Mazda Capella), Laser, Festiva, Festiva Mini Wagon, Ixion (Mazda Premacy), Freda (Mazda Bongo Friendee), Spectron (Mazda Bongo), and commercial trucks J80 and the J100 (Mazda Bongo truck).\n\n\nFord increased its shareholding in Mazda to 33.4% in 1996, but as of July\u00a02016[update], it is listed at 11%.[139] Ford did sell a small range of vehicles in Japan; as of October\u00a02010[update], the Ford Mustang, Escape, Explorer (and Explorer truck), Ford Kuga, Lincoln Navigator, Lincoln MKX, and more recently, the Ford Ecosport were available in Japan. As of February\u00a02016[update], Ford no longer maintains a regional office in Minato, Tokyo, Japan, and sales of new cars in Japan have ended.[140][141]\n\n\n\n### Oceania[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford FG X Falcon (Australia) (2014\u20132016; 2014 model shown)\n![](image)The Ford stamping plant in Geelong, Victoria, Australia. It closed in 2016.\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the popular Ford Falcon (1960\u20132016) had long been considered the average family car and is considerably larger than the Mondeo, Ford's largest car sold in Europe. Between 1960 and 1972, the Falcon was based on a U.S. model of the same name, but since then has been entirely designed and manufactured in Australia until 2016, occasionally being manufactured in New Zealand. Like its General Motors rival, the Holden Commodore, the Falcon used a rear-wheel-drive layout. High-performance variants of the Falcon running locally built engines produce up to 362\u00a0hp (270\u00a0kW). A ute (short for \"utility\", known in the U.S. as pickup truck) version is also available with the same range of drivetrains. In addition, Ford Australia sold highly tuned limited-production Falcon sedans and utes through its performance car division, Ford Performance Vehicles until it closed in 2014.\n\n\nIn Australia, the Commodore and Falcon had traditionally outsold all other cars and constituted over 20% of the new car market. In New Zealand, Ford was second in market share in the first eight months of 2006 with 14.4%.[142] More recently, Ford has axed its Falcon-based LWB variant of its lineup\u2013 the Fairlane and LTD ranges. Ford discontinued the Fairlane in 2007 and LTD in 2008. Ford had announced that their Geelong engine manufacturing plant would be shut down between 2013 and 2016. They had earlier announced local manufacturing of the Focus small car starting from 2011, but instead decided to import the model from Ford's plant in Thailand.[143]\n\n\nIn Australia, the Laser was one of Ford Australia's most successful models and was manufactured in Ford's Homebush West plant from 1981 until the plant's closure in September 1994. It outsold the Mazda 323, despite being almost identical to it because the Laser was manufactured in Australia and Ford was perceived as a local brand.[144] According to research carried out by Ford Australia in 1984, a third of Laser buyers were unaware that the Ford model was based on the Mazda 323.[145]\n\n\nIn New Zealand, the Ford Laser and Telstar were assembled alongside the Mazda 323 and 626 until 1997, at the Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ) plant in Wiri, Auckland.[146] The Sierra wagon was also assembled in New Zealand, owing to the popularity of station wagons in that market.[147]\n\n\nThe scheduled closure of Ford's Australian manufacturing base in 2016 was confirmed on May 23, 2013. Headquartered in the Victorian suburb of Broadmeadows, the company had registered losses worth AU$600 million over the five years prior to the announcement. It was noted that the corporate fleet and government sales that account for two-thirds of large, local car sales in Australia are insufficient to keep Ford's products profitable and viable in Australia. The decision will affect 1200 Ford workers\u2014over 600 employees in Geelong and more than 500 in Broadmeadows\u2014who will lose their jobs by October 2016. The closure of Ford's plants in Norlane Geelong and Broadmeadows Melbourne occurred on October 7, 2016.[148]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\n### Automobiles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Ford vehicles, List of Lincoln vehicles, and List of Mercury vehicles\n\n![](image)The 2017 model year F-150\nFord Motor Company sells a broad range of automobiles under the Ford marque worldwide, and an additional range of luxury automobiles under the Lincoln marque in the United States. The company has sold vehicles under a number of other marques during its history. The Mercury brand was introduced by Ford in 1939, continuing in production until 2011 when poor sales led to its discontinuation.[149] In 1958, Ford introduced the Edsel brand, but poor sales led to its discontinuation in 1960. In 1985, the Merkur brand was introduced in the United States to market products produced by Ford of Europe; it was discontinued in 1989.\n\n\nFord acquired the British sports car maker Aston Martin in 1989, later selling it on March 12, 2007,[150] although retaining an 8% stake.[151][152] Ford purchased Volvo Cars of Sweden in 1999,[153] selling it to Zhejiang Geely Holding Group in 2010.\n\n\nIn November 2008, it reduced its 33.4% controlling interest in Mazda of Japan to a 13.4% non-controlling interest.[154] On November 18, 2010, Ford reduced their stake further to just 3%, citing the reduction of ownership would allow greater flexibility to pursue growth in emerging markets. Ford and Mazda remain strategic partners through exchanges of technological information and joint ventures, including an American joint venture plant in Flat Rock, Michigan called Auto Alliance.[155] In 2015, Ford sold its remaining 3% stake in Mazda.[156]\n\n\nFord sold the United Kingdom-based Jaguar and Land Rover companies and brands to Tata Motors of India in March 2008.\n\n\nOn April 25, 2018, Ford announced that it planned to phase out all but one of its North American automobile models (the Mustang will be the sole surviving model) to focus primarily on trucks and SUVs. Ford had also planned to introduce an \"Active\" crossover version of the next-generation Focus, but canceled those plans due to tariff issues between the United States and China.[157]\n\n\n\n### Trucks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An advertisement for the 1939 Ford V-8 pick-up truck\n![](image)An advertisement for the 1961 Ford H-Series truck\nFord has produced trucks since 1908, beginning with the Ford Model TT, followed by the Model AA, and the Model BB. Countries where Ford commercial vehicles are or were formerly produced include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada (also badged as Mercury), France, Germany, India, Netherlands, Philippines, Spain (badged Ebro too), Turkey, UK (badged also Fordson and Thames), and the United States.\n\n\nFrom the 1940s to the late 1970s, Ford's Ford F-Series was used as the base for light trucks for the North American market.\n\n\nMost of these ventures are now extinct. The European one that lasted longest was the lorries arm of Ford of Britain, which became part of the Iveco group in 1986. Ford had a minority share in the new company and Iveco took over sales and production of the Ford Cargo range.[158] Ford's last significant European truck models were the Transcontinental and the Cargo. At the end of 1996, Ford sold the rights to its heavy trucks division to the Freightliner Trucks division of Daimler AG, with Ford producing the Cargo, Louisville, and Aeromax, through the 1998 model year. During the 1998 model year, Freightliner began production of its own versions of Ford-developed trucks in St. Thomas, Ontario, launching the Sterling truck brand.[159][160] Slotted between Freightliner and Western Star, Sterling trucks were produced through 2009.\n\n\nLine of heavy trucks made by Ford for the North American market:\n\n\n\n* Ford F-Series\n\t+ \"Big Job\" (1951-1957)\n\t+ \"Super Duty/Extra Heavy Duty (1958-1962)\n* Ford N-Series (1963-1969)\n* Ford L-Series trucks (1970-1998)\n\t+ aka Ford \"Louisville Line\"\n\t+ Ford Aeromax (1988-1998)\n\t+ Ford Louisville (1996-1998)\n\t+ Sterling (1998-2009)\n* Ford C-Series (1957-1990)\n* Ford Cargo/CF-Series (1986-1997)\n* Ford H-Series (1961-1966)\n\t+ aka \"Two-story Falcon\"\n* Ford W-Series (1966-1977)\n* Ford CL-Series (1978-1995)\n\n\nFor 1999, Ford briefly withdrew from production of medium-duty trucks. For the 2001 model year, the company entered into a joint venture with Navistar International (the supplier of diesel engines for 1-ton F-Series trucks), named *Blue Diamond Truck Company LLC*.[161] As part of the joint venture, sharing a common truck chassis, the two companies would produce medium-duty (Class 6\u20137) trucks in a Navistar facility in Mexico, with each manufacturer supplying its own powertrain and bodywork, with the Ford F-650/F-750 Super Duty and International 4000/DuraStar sharing an assembly line. In 2006, the joint venture debuted the Ford LCF/International CityStar.[162] Using a modified F-Series chassis adopted to fit a Mazda Titan cab, the LCF was a low-cab forward truck that was sold through 2009.[163]\n\n\nIn Europe, Ford manufactures the Ford Transit jumbo van, which is classed as a Large Goods Vehicle and has a payload of up to 2,265\u00a0kg; there are options of a panel van, pickup or chassis cab. The Ford Transit is also available as a light van called the Ford Transit Connect and the Ford Ranger pickup is available.[164]\n\n\n\n### Buses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Ford B700 bus chassis, with a body by Thomas Built\nFord manufactured complete buses in the company's early history, but today the role of the company has changed to that of a second stage manufacturer. In North America, the E-Series is still used as a chassis for small school buses and the F-650 is used in commercial bus markets. In the 1980s and 1990s, the medium-duty B700 was a popular chassis used by school bus body manufacturers including Thomas Built, Ward, and Blue Bird, but Ford lost its market share due to industry contraction and agreements between body manufacturers. Older bus models included:\n\n\nPrior to 1936, Ford buses were based on truck bodies:\n\n\n\n* Model B \u2013 1930s\n* Model T \u2013 1920s\n* F-105 school bus\n\n\n![](image)A 1937 Ford Transit Bus in Seattle\nIn 1936, Ford introduced the Ford Transit Bus, a series of small transit buses with bodies built by a second party. Originally a front-engine design, it was modified to a rear-engine design in 1939. About 1,000 to 1,200 of the original design were built, and around 12,500 of the rear-engine design, which was in production until 1947[165] (rebranded as the Universal Bus in 1946).\n\n\nRear-engine Transit Bus chassis model numbers:[166]\n\n\n\n* 09-B/19-B City transit bus \u2013 1939\u20131941\n* 19-B/29-B City transit bus \u2013 1941\u20131942\n* 49-B/79-B City transit bus \u2013 1944\u20131947\n* 69-B City transit bus \u2013 1946\u20131947\n* 29-B City transit bus \u2013 1946\u20131947\n* 72-T transit bus \u2013 1944\u20131945\n\n\nAfter 1946 the Transit City bus was sold as the *Universal Bus* with the roof changed from fabric/wood to all-metal:\n\n\n\n* 79-B Universal transit bus \u2013 1946\u20131947\n\n\nSucceeding the Ford Transit Bus was the Ford 8M buses:\n\n\n\n* 8MB transit bus \u2013 with Wayne Works 1948\u2013?\n\n\nFollowing World War II and from the 1950s onwards, Ford lost out to General Motors.[166] This led to the end of transit buses for Ford in North America.\n\n\n\n* B500 or B-series \u2013 1950\u20131990s based on Ford F-series truck chassis used by school bus body manufacturers\n\n\nIn Europe, Ford manufactures the Ford Transit Minibus which is classed in Europe as a Passenger Carrying Vehicle and there are options of 12-, 15-, or 17-seaters.[167] In the past, European models included:\n\n\n\n* EM\n* N-138\n* D series buses (Australia)\n\n\n### Tractors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Ford N series tractor\nThe \"Henry Ford and Son Company\" began making Fordson tractors in Henry's hometown of Springwells (later part of Dearborn), Michigan, from 1907 to 1928, from 1919 to 1932, at Cork, Ireland, and between 1933 and 1964 at Dagenham, England, later transferred to Basildon. They were also produced in Leningrad beginning in 1924.\n\n\nFord reentered the tractor market in 1939 with the Ford N-series tractors. The Ford 8N, introduced in 1947, became the most popular tractor of all time in North America. Production of the N line of models ended in 1952.\n\n\nThe Ford NAA tractor was introduced as an entirely new model in 1953. It was a replacement for the Ford N-Series tractors. Larger than the 8N, with a four-cylinder engine, and streamlined styling.\n\n\nIn 1986, Ford expanded its tractor business when it purchased the Sperry-New Holland skid-steer loader and hay baler, hay tools and implement company from Sperry Corporation and formed Ford-New Holland which bought out Versatile tractors in 1988. This company was bought by Fiat in 1993 and the name changed from Ford New Holland to New Holland. New Holland is now part of CNH Global.\n\n\n\n### Financial services[edit]\n\n\nFord offers automotive finance through Ford Motor Credit Company.\n\n\n\n### Automotive components[edit]\n\n\nFord's *FoMoCo* parts division sells aftermarket parts under the Motorcraft brand name. It has spun off its parts division under the name Visteon.\n\n\n\n## FordWorks Program[edit]\n\n\nFord Motor Company created the FordWorks program in 2016[168][169] with the aim to bring people with disabilities back into the workforce.[170] It was the first automotive program to focus on bringing people with autism in the workforce in the US. They targeted people with autism[168][169] but have expanded their criteria to people with other disabilities.[170] Ford has partnered with Upbound to broaden their hiring under the FordWorks program.[170]\n\n\n\n## Marques[edit]\n\n\n### Current marques[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Marque\n | Estab.\n | Added | Markets\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Ford | 1903 | 1903 | Global\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Lincoln | 1917 | 1922 | North America, Middle East, China, South Korea\n |\n\n\n### Former marques[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Marque\n | Years | Markets\n | Fate\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Continental[171][172] | 1956\u20131986 | North America | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Edsel | 1957\u20131960 | North America | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Fordson | 1917\u20131964 | North America, Ireland, U.K. | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Mercury | 1939\u20132011 | North America, Middle East | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Merkur | 1985\u20131989 | North America | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0AUS | FPV | 2002\u20132014 | Australia | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0BRA | Troller | 2007\u20132021 | Brazil | Defunct company, plant closed by Ford Brasil |\n| ![](image)\u00a0JPN | Mazda | 1974\u20132015 | Global | Sold shares\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0SWE | Volvo | 1999\u20132010 | Global | Sold to Geely |\n| ![](image)\u00a0UK | Aston Martin | 1989\u20132007 | Global | Sold to a private consortium\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0UK | Jaguar | 1989\u20132008 | Global | Sold to Tata Motors |\n| ![](image)\u00a0UK | Land Rover | 2000\u20132008 | Global | Sold to Tata Motors |\n| ![](image)\u00a0ITA | De Tomaso | 1971\u20131974 | Global | Sold to Alejandro de Tomaso |\n| ![](image)\u00a0ITA | Moto Guzzi | 1973\u20131974 | Global | Sold to Alejandro de Tomaso |\n| ![](image)\u00a0ITA | Benelli | 1972\u20131974 | Global | Sold to Alejandro de Tomaso |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Meteor | 1949\u20131976 | Canada | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Monarch | 1946\u20131961 | Canada | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Frontenac | 1960 | Canada | Discontinued\n |\n\n\n## Motorsport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford Performance\n\n### FIA World Championships[edit]\n\n\nAlong with Shelby and Chevrolet, Ford is one of only three American constructors to win titles on the international scene at the FIA World Championships. As a constructor, Ford won the World Sportscar Championship three times in 1966 (both sports prototype category and Grand Touring (GT) category), 1967 (GT category), and 1968 (sports prototype category), and at the World Rally Championship Ford won 4 World Drivers' Championships (in 1979, 1981, 2017 and 2018) as well as 4 World Manufacturers' Championships (in 1979, 2006, 2007 and 2017). As an engine supplier, Ford also won 13 Formula One World Drivers' Championships and 10 Formula One World Constructors' Championships.\n\n\n\n### Open-wheel racing[edit]\n\n\n#### IndyCar[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Arie Luyendyk's record-setting Ford Cosworth-powered IndyCar from 1996\nIndyCars with Ford engines first competed in 1935 using a production-based Ford V8 in the Miller-Ford racer.[173][174] A pushrod Ford V8 raced with Lotus in 1963, and Ford's first Indy win was in 1965 with a DOHC V8.[175][176] Ford motors, including the Ford-sponsored DFX engine developed by Cosworth, have won the Indianapolis 500 eighteen times.[177] On May 12, 1996, Arie Luyendyk, while driving an IndyCar powered by a Ford Cosworth XB engine, broke the Indianapolis 500 records for fastest qualification lap (237.498\u00a0mph; 382.216\u00a0km/h) and fastest qualification four-lap average (236.986\u00a0mph; 381.392\u00a0km/h).[178][179] These speed records still stand as of 2022[update].[180]\n\n\n\n#### Formula Ford[edit]\n\n\nFormula Ford, conceived in the UK in 1966, is an entry-level type of formula racing with wingless single-seater cars. Many of today's formula racing drivers started their car racing careers in this category.\n\n\n\n#### Formula One[edit]\n\n\nFord was heavily involved in Formula One for many years and supplied engines to a large number of teams from 1967 until 2004. These engines were designed and manufactured by Cosworth, the racing division that was owned by Ford from 1998 to 2004. Ford-badged engines won 176 Grands Prix between 1967 and 2003 for teams such as Team Lotus and McLaren. Ford entered Formula One as a constructor in 2000 under the Jaguar Racing name, after buying the Stewart Grand Prix team which had been its primary 'works' team in the series since 1997. Jaguar achieved little success in Formula One, and after a turbulent five seasons, Ford withdrew from the category after the 2004 season, selling both Jaguar Racing (which became Red Bull Racing) and Cosworth (to Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven).[181]\n\n\nFord has announced that it will return to Formula One in 2026 following a partnership with Red Bull Powertrains, supplying power units to Red Bull Racing and Scuderia AlphaTauri.[182]\n\n\n\n### Stock car racing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ryan Blaney driving the No. 21 Wood Brothers Ford in 2016 at Michigan International Speedway\nFord is one of three manufacturers in NASCAR's three major series: the Cup Series, Xfinity Series, and Truck Series. Major teams include RFK Racing, Team Penske, Stewart-Haas Racing, and Wood Brothers Racing. Ford is represented by the Mustang GT in the Cup Series, and the Xfinity Series and by the F-150 in the Truck Series. Some of the most successful NASCAR Fords were the aerodynamic fastback Ford Torino, Ford Torino Talladega, Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II, and Mercury Montegos, and the aero-era Ford Thunderbirds. The Ford nameplate has won eight manufacturer's championships in Sprint Cup while Mercury has won one. In the Sprint Cup Series, Ford earned its 1,000th victory in the 2013 Quicken Loans 400.[183] The Ford Fusion is also used in the ARCA Racing Series. Ford had last won a drivers' championship in the Cup Series with Joey Logano in 2022.\n\n\n\n### Rally[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford World Rally Team\n\n![](image)Jari-Matti Latvala driving the Ford Focus RS WRC 09 in 2010\nFord has a long history in rallying and has been active in the World Rally Championship since the beginning of the world championship, the 1973 season. Ford took the 1979 manufacturers' title with Hannu Mikkola, Bj\u00f6rn Waldeg\u00e5rd, and Ari Vatanen driving the Ford Escort RS1800. In the Group B era, Ford achieved success with Ford RS200. Since the 1999 season, Ford has used various versions of the Ford Focus WRC to much success. In the 2006 season, BP-Ford World Rally Team secured Ford its second manufacturers' title, with the Focus RS WRC 06 built by M-Sport and driven by \"Flying Finns\" Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm and Mikko Hirvonen.[184] Continuing with Gr\u00f6nholm and Hirvonen, Ford successfully defended the manufacturers' world championship in the 2007 season. Ford is the only manufacturer to score in the points for 92 consecutive races; since the 2002 season opener Monte Carlo Rally.[185]\n\n\n\n### Rallycross[edit]\n\n\nFord has competed in rallycross with its Ford Fiesta and Ford Focus. Tanner Foust won the Global RallyCross Championship in 2011 and 2012 and was runner-up in the FIA European Rallycross Championship in 2011 and 2012. Toomas Heikkinen won the Global RallyCross Championship title in 2013 and Joni Wiman won it in 2014. Other notable Ford drivers include Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm, Ken Block, and Brian Deegan.\n\n\n\n### Sports cars[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford GT \u00a7\u00a0Racing\n\nFord sports cars have been visible in the world of sports car racing since 1964. Most notably the Ford GT40 won the 24 Hours of Le Mans four times (in 1966, 1967, 1968 and 1969) and is the only American car to ever win overall at this prestigious event. Ford also won four titles at the World Sportscar Championship with the GT40. Swiss team Matech GT Racing, in collaboration with Ford Racing, opened a new chapter with the Ford GT, winning the Teams title in the 2008 FIA GT3 European Championship.\n\n\n\n#### Ford Mustang[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford Mustang \u00a7\u00a0Racing\n\n![](image)A GT racing version of the Ford Mustang, competing in the Koni Challenge in 2005\nThe Ford Mustang has arguably been Ford's most successful sports car. Jerry Titus won the 1965 SCCA Pro B National Championship with a Mustang and the model went on to earn Ford the SCCA Trans-Am Championship title in both 1966 and 1967. Ford won the Trans-Am Championship again in 1970 with Parnelli Jones and George Follmer driving Boss 302 Mustangs for Bud Moore Engineering. Ford took the 1985 and 1986 IMSA GTO Championship with Mustangs driven by John Jones and Scott Pruett before returning to Trans-Am glory with a championship in 1989 with Dorsey Schroeder. Ford dominated Trans-Am in the 1990s with Tommy Kendall winning championships in 1993, 1995, 1996, and 1997 with Paul Gentilozzi adding yet another title in 1999. In 2005 the Ford Mustang FR500C took the championship in the Rolex Koni Challenge Series in its first year on the circuit. In 2007, Ford added a victory in the GT4 European Championship. 2008 was the first year of the Mustang Challenge for the Miller Cup, a series that pits a full field of identical factory-built Ford Mustang race cars against each other. Also, in 2008, Ford won the manufacturers championship in the Koni Challenge Series and HyperSport drivers Joe Foster and Steve Maxwell won the drivers title in a Mustang GT.\n\n\nFord and Michelin teamed up to provide custom-engineered tires for the Ford Performance vehicle lineup. Ford Performance director Dave Pericak said: \"That confidence extends from our upcoming racing effort at Le Mans in 2016 with the all-new Ford GT, to the Ford Performance vehicle lineup, including the Shelby GT350 and F-150 Raptor\".[186]\n\n\n\n### Touring cars[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford Performance Racing Ford Falcon V8 Supercar at Eastern Creek in Australia in 2008\nFord has campaigned touring cars such as the Focus, Falcon, and Contour/Mondeo and the Sierra Cosworth in many different series throughout the years. Notably, Mondeo drivers finished 1, 2, and 3 in the 2000 British Touring Car Championship and Falcon drivers placed 1, 2, and 3 in the 2005 V8 Supercar Championship Series.\n\n\n\n### Drag racing[edit]\n\n\nIn drag racing, John Force Racing drivers John Force, Tony Pedregon, and Robert Hight have piloted Ford Mustang Funny Cars to several NHRA titles in recent seasons. Teammates Tim Wilkerson and Bob Tasca III also drive Mustangs in Funny Car.\n\n\n\n### Drifting[edit]\n\n\nFord has branched out into drifting with the introduction of the new model Mustang. Most noticeable is the Turquoise and Blue Falken Tires Mustang driven by Vaughn Gittin, Jr., (A.K.A. \"JR\") that produces 750 RWHP (Rear Wheel Horsepower).\n\n\n\n## Environmental initiatives[edit]\n\n\n### Compressed natural gas[edit]\n\n\nThe alternative fossil fuel vehicles, such as some versions of the Crown Victoria especially in fleet and taxi service, operate on compressed natural gas\u2014or CNG. Some CNG vehicles have dual fuel tanks\u2014one for gasoline, the other for CNG\u2014the same engine can operate on either fuel via a selector switch.\n\n\n\n### Flexible fuel vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Ford Focus Flexifuel was the first E85 flexible fuel vehicle commercially available in the European market.\nFlexible fuel vehicles are designed to operate smoothly using a wide range of available ethanol fuel mixtures\u2014from pure gasoline to bioethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) or E100 (neat hydrous ethanol) in Brazil. Part of the challenge of successful marketing alternative and flexible fuel vehicles in the U.S. is the general lack of establishment of sufficient fueling stations, which would be essential for these vehicles to be attractive to a wide range of consumers. Significant efforts to ramp up production and distribution of E85 fuels are underway and expanding.[187] Current Ford E100 Flex sold in the Brazilian market are the Courier, Ford EcoSport, Ford Fiesta, Ford Focus, and Ford Ka.\n\n\n\n### Electric drive vehicles[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. The reason given is: this section did not include newer electric and hybrid models. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(January 2021)*\n |\n\n\n#### Hybrid electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hybrid electric vehicle\n\n![](image)Ford Escape plug-in hybrid test vehicle\n![](image)Alan Mulally (wearing red tie) with then-President George W. Bush at the Kansas City Assembly plant in Claycomo, Missouri, on March 20, 2007, touting Ford's new hybrid cars\nIn 2004, Ford and Toyota agreed a patent-sharing accord that granted Ford access to certain hybrid technology patented by Toyota; in exchange, Ford licensed some of its own patents to Toyota.[188][189][190] In 2004, Ford introduced the Escape Hybrid. With this vehicle, Ford was third to the automotive market with a hybrid electric vehicle and the first hybrid electric SUV to market. This was also the first hybrid electric vehicle with a flexible fuel capability to run on E85.[191] The Escape's platform mate Mercury Mariner was also available with the hybrid-electric system in the 2006 model year\u2014a full year ahead of schedule. The similar Mazda Tribute will also receive a hybrid-electric powertrain option, along with many other vehicles in the Ford vehicle line.\n\n\nIn 2005, Ford announced a goal to make 250,000 hybrids a year by 2010, but by mid-2006 announced that it would not meet that goal, due to excessively high costs and the lack of sufficient supplies of the hybrid-electric batteries and drivetrain system components.[192] Instead, Ford has committed to accelerating development of next-generation hybrid-electric power plants in Britain, in collaboration with Volvo. This engineering study is expected to yield more than 100 new hybrid-electric vehicle models and derivatives.\n\n\nIn September 2007, Ford announced a partnership with Southern California Edison (SCE) to examine how plug-in hybrids will work with the electrical grid. Under the multimillion-dollar, multi-year project, Ford will convert a demonstration fleet of Ford Escape Hybrids into plug-in hybrids, and SCE will evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid. Some of the vehicles will be evaluated \"in typical customer settings\", according to Ford.[35][36]\n\n\nOn June 12, 2008, USDOE expanded its own fleet of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles with the addition of a Ford Escape Plug-In Hybrid Flex-Fuel Vehicle. The vehicle is equipped with a 10-kilowatt (13\u00a0hp) lithium-ion battery supplied by Johnson Controls-Saft that stores enough electric energy to drive up to 30 miles (48\u00a0km) at speeds of up to 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[193] In March 2009, Ford launched hybrid versions of the Ford Fusion Hybrid and the Mercury Milan Hybrid in the United States, both as 2010 models.[194]\n\n\nAs of November\u00a02014[update], Ford has produced for retail sales the following hybrid electric vehicles: Ford Escape Hybrid (2004\u20132012), Mercury Mariner Hybrid (2005\u20132010), Mercury Milan Hybrid (2009\u20132010), Ford Fusion Hybrid (2009\u2013present), Lincoln MKZ Hybrid (2010\u2013present), Ford C-Max Hybrid (2012\u2013present), and Ford Mondeo Hybrid (2014\u2013present). By June 2012, Ford had sold 200,000 full hybrids in the U.S. since 2004,[195] and, as of September\u00a02014[update], the carmaker has sold over 344,000 hybrids in the United States.[195][196][197][198] The top selling hybrids in the U.S. market are the Fusion Hybrid with 127,572 units, followed by Escape Hybrid with 117,997 units, and the C-Max Hybrid with 54,236.[196][197][198][199][200] As of November\u00a02014[update], Ford is the world's second-largest manufacturer of hybrids after Toyota Motor Corporation, with 400,000 hybrid electric vehicles produced since their introduction in 2004.[201]\n\n\n\n#### Plug-in electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Plug-in electric vehicle\n\nAs of October\u00a02014[update], Ford has produced the following plug-in electric vehicles: the all-electric Ford Ranger EV (1997\u20132002), Ford TH!NK (1999\u20132003), Transit Connect (2010\u20132012), and Ford Focus Electric (2011\u20132018); and the plug-in hybrids C-MAX Energi (2012\u20132017) and the Fusion Energi (2013\u20132020), sold under the Mondeo nameplate in Europe.[202][203] Since the launch of the Focus Electric in 2011, combined sales of all Ford plug-in electric models amounted to just over 56,000 through October 2015.[204]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Azure Transit Connect Electric was produced between 2010 and 2012 as a collaboration between Azure Dynamics and Ford Motor Company.\nBill Ford was one of the first top industry executives to make regular use of a battery electric vehicle, a Ford Ranger EV, while the company contracted with the United States Postal Service to deliver electric postal vans based on the Ranger EV platform. Ford discontinued a line of electric Ranger pickup trucks and ordered them destroyed, though it reversed in January 2005, after environmentalist protest.[205] The all-electric pickup truck leased 205 units to individuals and 1,500 units to fleets in the U.S. from 1998 to 2002.[206][207]\n\n\nFrom 2009 to 2011, Ford offered the Ford TH!NK car. Ford ended production and ordered all the cars repossessed and destroyed, even as many of the people leasing them begged to be able to buy the cars from Ford. After an outcry from the lessees and activists in the U.S. and Norway, Ford returned the cars to Norway for sale.[208] Four hundred and forty units were leased in the U.S. from 1999 until 2003.[207]\n\n\nIn 2017, Ford CEO Mark Fields announced that the company would invest $4.5 billion in further development of plug-in electric vehicles by 2020.[209]\n\n\nThe Azure Transit Connect Electric was an all-electric van developed as a collaboration between Azure Dynamics and Ford Motor Company, but Azure was the official manufacturer of record.[210] The Transit Connect Electric had an official U.S. Environmental Protection Agency all-electric range of 56\u00a0mi (90\u00a0km).[211] The EPA rated the combined city/highway fuel economy at 62 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (3.8\u00a0L/100\u00a0km equivalent).[211] Deliveries for fleet customers in the U.S. and Canada began in December 2010.[212] Production of the electric van was stopped in March 2012 as a result of Azure's bankruptcy protection filing. Ford continues to provide servicing.[213] Around 500 units were sold before Azure stopped production.[214]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Ford Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid shares its powertrain with the Ford C-Max Energi.\nThe Ford Focus Electric is based on the next generation Focus internal combustion vehicle, converted to an all-electric propulsion system as a production electric car by Magna International, and retail sales began in the U.S. in December 2011.[215][216] The Focus Electric has an EPA rated range of 76\u00a0mi (122\u00a0km) and a combined city/highway fuel economy of 105 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (2.2\u00a0L/100\u00a0km).[217] Available also in Canada and several European countries, 3,965 units have been sold in the U.S. through September 2014.[196][197][198][218]\n\n\nThe Ford C-Max Energi is a plug-in hybrid released in the U.S. in October 2012. The C-Max Energi has an EPA rated all-electric range of 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) and a combined city/highway fuel economy in all-electric mode at 88 MPG-e (2.7\u00a0L/100\u00a0km).[219] U.S. sales totaled 33,509 units through December 2016.[196][197][220][221][222] Deliveries of the Ford Fusion Energi began in the United States in February 2013.[223][224] The Fusion Energi has an all-electric range of 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) and an equivalent fuel economy EPA rating of 88 MPG-e (2.7\u00a0L/100\u00a0km).[219] As of December\u00a02016[update], a total of 43,327 units have been delivered in the U.S. since its inception.[197][220][221][222]\n\n\nBoth Energi models share the same powertrain technology and have the same EPA combined city/highway fuel economy in hybrid operation of 38\u00a0mpg\u2011US (6.2\u00a0L/100\u00a0km; 46\u00a0mpg\u2011imp).[219]\nWhen asked about a battery-electric vehicle with a 200-mile (320\u00a0km) range, Fields said in April 2016 \"Clearly that's something we're developing for\". Ford has a pending trademark application on the \"Model E\" name,[225] preventing the Tesla Model 3 in using the name.[226]\n\n\nIn October 2017, Ford announced its Team Edison battery-electric vehicle group to lead the company's renewed efforts into the EV market, in which it currently offers only the Focus subcompact and has plans for a small 300-mile SUV by 2020.[227] The new team will be headquartered in Detroit and have offices in Europe and Asia.[228]\n\n\nIn 2022, Ford began manufacturing its E-Transit electric cargo vans at its plant in Kansas City, Missouri.[229]\n\n\n\n![a photograph showing the front-left quarter of a grey automobile](image)Ford Mustang Mach-E\n### Hydrogen[edit]\n\n\nFord also continues to study fuel cell-powered electric powertrains and has demonstrated hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. Compared with conventional vehicles, hybrid vehicles and/or fuel cell vehicles decrease air pollution emissions as well as sound levels, with favorable impacts upon respiratory health and decrease of noise health effects.\n\n\nFord has launched the production of hydrogen-powered shuttle buses, using hydrogen instead of gasoline in a standard internal combustion engine, for use at airports and convention centers.[230] At the 2006 Greater Los Angeles Auto Show, Ford showcased a hydrogen fuel cell version of its Explorer SUV. The Fuel cell Explorer has a combined output of 174\u00a0hp (130\u00a0kW). It has a large hydrogen storage tank which is situated in the center of the car taking the original place of the conventional model's automatic transmission. The centered position of the tank assists the vehicle reach a notable range of 350 miles (563\u00a0km), the farthest for a fuel cell vehicle so far. The fuel cell Explorer the first in a series of prototypes partly funded by the United States Department of Energy to expand efforts to determine the feasibility of hydrogen-powered vehicles. The fuel cell Explorer is one of several vehicles with green technology being featured at the L.A. show, including the 2008 Ford Escape Hybrid, PZEV emissions compliant Fusion and Focus models and a 2008 Ford F-Series Super Duty outfitted with Ford's clean diesel technology.\n\n\n\n### Increased fuel efficiency[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2008, Ford Motor Company announced that it would accelerate its plans to produce more fuel-efficient cars, changing both its North American manufacturing plans and its lineup of vehicles available in the United States. In terms of North American manufacturing, the company planned to convert three existing truck and sport utility vehicle (SUV) plants for small car production, with the first conversion at its Michigan Truck Plant. In addition, Ford's assembly plants near Mexico City, Mexico, and in Louisville, Kentucky, were to be converted from pickups and SUVs to small cars, including the Ford Fiesta, by 2011. Ford then also planned to introduce to North America six of its European small vehicles, including two versions of the Ford Fiesta, by the end of 2012.[231]\n\n\nFord of Europe developed the ECOnetic programme to address the market and legislative need for higher fuel efficiency and lower CO2 emissions. As opposed to the hybrid engine technology used in competitor products such as the Toyota Prius, ECOnetic improves existing technology. Using lower-consuming Duratorq TDCi diesel engines, and based on a combination of improved aerodynamics, lower resistance, and improved efficiency, the Ford Fiesta was the lowest-emitting mass-produced car in Europe[232] while the 2012 Ford Focus ECOnetic will have better fuel consumption than the Prius or the Volkswagen Golf BlueMotion.[233] ECOnetic is not presently planned to be sold in North American due to current perceived lower consumer demand.[234]\n\n\nFord has challenged University teams to create a vehicle that is simple, durable, lightweight, and comes equipped with a base target price of only $7,000. The students from Aachen University created the \"2015 Ford Model T\".[235][236]\n\n\nIn 2000, under the leadership of the current Ford chairman, William Clay Ford, the company announced[237] a planned 25 percent improvement in the average mileage of its SUVs\u2014to be completed by the 2005 calendar year. In 2003, Ford announced that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent the company from achieving this goal.[238]\n\n\nFor the 2007 model year, Ford had thirteen U.S. models that achieve 30 miles per gallon or better (based on the highway fuel economy estimates of the EPA) and several of Ford's vehicles were recognized in the EPA and Department of Energy Fuel Economy Guide for best-in-class fuel economy. Ford claimed to have eliminated nearly three million pounds of smog-forming emissions from their U.S. cars and light trucks over the 2004 to 2006 model years.[239] However, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has linked Ford to 54 Superfund toxic waste sites, twelve of which have been cleaned up and deleted from the list.[240]\n\n\n\n### Efficient buildings[edit]\n\n\nAs part of a renovation of the Ford River Rouge Complex, in 2010 Ford unveiled a 10.4-acre (42,000\u00a0m2) living roof covering part of the Dearborn Truck plant, consisting of sedum, a low-growing groundcover. The sedum retains and cleanses rainwater and moderates the internal temperature of the building, saving energy.[241]\n\n\nIn 2016, Ford announced a ten-year renovation plan for its Dearborn campus.[242] The plan features consolidation of office and lab spaces in to fewer and much larger buildings, which will be built to LEED standards, and will feature extensive use of wetlands and park spaces.[243][244] The new campus features new multi-story parking decks with solar power-generating roofs,[245] and a new natural gas power plant. The DTE Ford Central Energy Plant is a 34MW combined heat-and-power plant which features a high efficiency design and LEED Gold buildings.[246]\n\n\n\n## Sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nFord sponsors numerous events and sports facilities around the U.S., most notably the Ford Center in downtown Evansville, Indiana, and Ford Field in downtown Detroit.[247]\n\n\nThe company has also been a major sponsor of the UEFA Champions League for over two decades, and is also a longtime sponsor of the Sky media channel's coverage of Premier League football.\n\n\nBetween 1994 and 1999, Ford was the main kit sponsor of German Bundesliga club 1.

It was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda and incorporated on August 28, 1937. Toyota is the largest automobile manufacturer in the world, producing about 10 million vehicles per year.\n\n\nThe company was originally founded as a spinoff of Toyota Industries, a machine maker started by Sakichi Toyoda, Kiichiro's father. Both companies are now part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the world. While still a department of Toyota Industries, the company developed its first product, the Type A engine, in 1934 and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA.\n\n\nAfter World War II, Toyota benefited from Japan's alliance with the United States to learn from American automakers and other companies, which gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the small company into a leader in the industry and was the subject of many academic studies.\n\n\nIn the 1960s, Toyota took advantage of the rapidly growing Japanese economy to sell cars to a growing middle-class, leading to the development of the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling automobile. The booming economy also funded an international expansion that allowed Toyota to grow into one of the largest automakers in the world, the largest company in Japan and the ninth-largest company in the world by revenue, as of December\u00a02020[update]. Toyota was the world's first automobile manufacturer to produce more than 10 million vehicles per year, a record set in 2012, when it also reported the production of its 200 millionth vehicle. By September 2023, total production reached 300 million vehicles.[3]\n\n\nToyota was praised for being a leader in the development and sales of more fuel-efficient hybrid electric vehicles, starting with the introduction of the Toyota Prius in 1997. The company now sells more than 40 hybrid vehicle models around the world. More recently, the company has also been criticized for being slow to adopt all-electric vehicles and focusing on the development of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, like the Toyota Mirai, a technology that is costlier and has fallen far behind electric batteries.\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the Toyota Motor Corporation produces vehicles under four brands: Daihatsu, Hino, Lexus and the namesake Toyota. The company also holds a 20% stake in Subaru Corporation, a 5.1% stake in Mazda, a 4.9% stake in Suzuki, a 4.6% stake in Isuzu, a 3.8% stake in Yamaha Motor Corporation, and a 2.8% stake in Panasonic, as well as stakes in vehicle manufacturing joint-ventures in China (FAW Toyota and GAC Toyota), the Czech Republic (TPCA), India (Toyota Kirloskar) and the United States (MTMUS).\n\n\nToyota is listed on the London Stock Exchange, Nagoya Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where its stock is a component of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Core30 indices.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Toyota\n\n### 1920s\u20131930s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The mass-produced Toyoda automated loom, displayed at Toyota Museum in Aichi-gun, Japan\nIn 1924, Sakichi Toyoda invented the Toyoda Model G Automatic Loom. The principle of *jidoka*, which means the machine stops itself when a problem occurs, became later a part of the Toyota Production System. Looms were built on a small production line. In 1929, the patent for the automatic loom was sold to the British company Platt Brothers,[4] generating the starting capital for automobile development.[5]\n\n\nUnder the direction of the founder's son, Kiichiro Toyoda,[6][7] Toyoda Automatic Loom Works established an Automobile Division on September 1, 1933, and formally declared its intention to begin manufacturing automobiles on January 29, 1934.[6] A prototype Toyota Type A engine was completed on September 25, 1934, with the company's first prototype sedan, the A1, completed the following May. As Kiichiro had limited experience with automobile production, he initially focused on truck production; the company's first truck, the G1, was completed on August 25, 1935, and debuted on November 21 in Tokyo, becoming the company's first production model.[6][8] Modeled on a period Ford truck, the G1 sold for \u00a52,900, \u00a5200 cheaper than the Ford truck. A total of 379 G1 trucks were ultimately produced.[8]\n\n\nIn April 1936, Toyoda's first passenger car, the Model AA, was completed. The sales price was \u00a53,350, \u00a5400 cheaper than Ford or GM cars.[9] The company's plant at Kariya was completed in May. In July, the company filled its first export order, with four G1 trucks exported to northeastern China.[6] On September 19, 1936, the Japanese imperial government officially designated Toyota Automatic Loom Works as an automotive manufacturer.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 1936 Toyota AA, the first vehicle produced by the company while it was still a department of Toyota Industries\nVehicles were originally sold under the name \"Toyoda\" (\u30c8\u30e8\u30c0), from the family name of the company's founder, Kiichir\u014d Toyoda. In September 1936, the company ran a public competition to design a new logo. Of 27,000 entries, the winning entry was the three Japanese *katakana* letters for \"Toyoda\" in a circle. However, Rizaburo Toyoda, who had married into the family and was not born with that name, preferred \"Toyota\" (\u30c8\u30e8\u30bf) because it took eight brush strokes (a lucky number) to write in Japanese, was visually simpler (leaving off the diacritic at the end), and with a voiceless consonant instead of a voiced one (voiced consonants are considered to have a \"murky\" or \"muddy\" sound compared to voiceless consonants, which are \"clear\").\n\n\nSince *toyoda* literally means \"fertile rice paddies\", changing the name also prevented the company from being associated with old-fashioned farming. The newly formed word was trademarked and the company began trading on August 28, 1937, as the Toyota Motor Company Ltd.[6][10][11][12] Kiichiro's brother-in-law Rizaburo Toyoda was appointed the firm's first president, with Kiichiro as vice-president. Toyota Automatic Loom Works formally transferred automobile manufacturing to the new entity on September 29.[6]\n\n\nThe Japanese government supported the company by preventing foreign competitors Ford and General Motors from importing automobiles into Japan.[13]\n\n\nAt the onset of World War II, Toyota almost exclusively produced standard-sized trucks for the Japanese Army, which paid one-fifth of the price in advance and the remainder in cash upon delivery.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### 1940s[edit]\n\n\nJapan was heavily damaged in World War II and Toyota's plants, which were used for the war effort, were not spared. On August 14, 1945, one day before the surrender of Japan, Toyota's Koromo Plant was bombed by the Allied forces.[16] After the surrender, the U.S.-led occupying forces banned passenger car production in Japan. However, automakers like Toyota were allowed to begin building trucks for civilian use, in an effort to rebuild the nation's infrastructure.[17] The U.S. military also contracted with Toyota to repair its vehicles.[18]\n\n\nBy 1947, there was an emerging global Cold War between the Soviet Union and the U.S., who had been allies in World War II. U.S. priorities shifted (the \"Reverse Course\") from punishing and reforming Japan to ensuring internal political stability, rebuilding the economy, and, to an extent, remilitarizing Japan. Under these new policies, in 1949, Japanese automakers were allowed to resume passenger car production, but at the same time, a new economic stabilization program to control inflation plunged the automotive industry into a serious shortage of funds, while many truck owners defaulted on their loans.[19] Ultimately, the Bank of Japan, the central bank of the country, bailed out the company, with demands that the company institute reforms.[20]\n\n\n\n### 1950s[edit]\n\n\nAs the 1950s began, Toyota emerged from its financial crisis a smaller company, closing factories and laying off workers. At about the same time, the Korean War broke out, and being located so close to the battlefront, the U.S. Army placed an order for 1,000 trucks from Toyota. The order helped to rapidly improve the struggling company's business performance.[21] In 1950, company executives, including Kiichiro's cousin Eiji Toyoda, took a trip to the United States where they trained at the Ford Motor Company and observed the operations of dozens of U.S. manufacturers.[22] The knowledge they gained during the trip, along with what the company learned making looms, gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the company into a leader in the manufacturing industry.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Toyopet Crown, the first vehicle fully designed and built by Toyota\nToyota started developing its first full-fledged passenger car, the Toyopet Crown, in January 1952. Prior to the Crown, Toyota had been outsourcing the design and manufacturing of auto bodies, which were then mounted on truck frames made by Toyota.[24] The project was a major test for Toyota, who would need to build bodies and develop a new chassis that would be comfortable, but still stand up to the muddy, slow, unpaved roads common in Japan at the time.[24] The project had been championed for many years by founder Kiichiro Toyoda, who died suddenly on March 27, 1952. The first prototypes were completed in June 1953 and began extensive testing, before the Crown went on sale in August 1955.[25] The car was met with positive reviews from around the world.\n\n\nAfter the introduction of the Crown, Toyota began aggressively expanding into the export market. Toyota began shipping Land Cruiser knock-down kits to Latin America in November 1955,[26] sending complete Land Cruisers to Burma (now Myanmar) and the Philippines in 1956 as part of war reparations provided by the Japanese government,[27] establishing a branch in Thailand in June 1957,[28] and shipping Land Cruisers to Australia in August 1957.[27] Toyota established a production facility in Brazil in 1958, the company's first outside of Japan.[29]\n\n\nToyota entered the United States market in July 1958, attempting to sell the Toyopet Crown. The company faced problems almost immediately, the Crown was a flop in the U.S. with buyers finding it overpriced and underpowered (because it was designed for the bad roads of Japan, not high-speed performance). In response, exports of the Crown to the United States were suspended in December 1960.[30]\n\n\nAfter Kiichiro's death, his cousin Eiji Toyoda led the company for the two decades. Eiji helped establish the company's first plant independent from the Loom Works plant.[31]\n\n\n\n### 1960s\u20131970s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toyota 2000GT (1967\u20131969)\nAt the start of the 1960s, the Japanese economy was booming, a period that came to be known as the Japanese economic miracle. As the economy grew, so did the income of everyday people, who now could afford to purchase a vehicle. At the same time, the Japanese government heavily invested in improving road infrastructure.[32] To take advantage of the moment, Toyota and other automakers started offering affordable economy cars like the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling automobile.[33][34]\n\n\nToyota also found success in the United States in 1965 with the Toyota Corona compact car, which was redesigned specifically for the American market with a more powerful engine. The Corona helped increase U.S. sales of Toyota vehicles to more than 20,000 units in 1966 (a threefold increase) and helped the company become the third-best-selling import brand in the United States by 1967. Toyota's first manufacturing investment in the United States came in 1972 when the company struck a deal with Atlas Fabricators, to produce truck beds in Long Beach, in an effort to avoid the 25% \"chicken tax\" on imported light trucks. By importing the truck as an incomplete chassis cab (the truck without a bed), the vehicle only faced a 4% tariff.[35] Once in the United States, Atlas would build the truck beds and attach them to the trucks. The partnership was successful and two years later, Toyota purchased Atlas.[36]\n\n\nThe energy crisis of the 1970s was a major turning point in the American auto industry. Before the crisis, large and heavy vehicles with powerful but inefficient engines were common. But in the years after, consumers started demanding high-quality and fuel-efficient small cars. Domestic automakers, in the midst of their malaise era, struggled to build these cars profitably, but foreign automakers like Toyota were well positioned. This, along with growing anti-Japanese sentiment, prompted the U.S. Congress to consider import restrictions to protect the domestic auto industry.\n\n\nThe 1960s also saw the slight opening of the Japanese auto market to foreign companies. In an effort to strengthen Japan's auto industry ahead of the market opening, Toyota purchased stakes in other Japanese automakers. That included a stake in Hino Motors, a manufacturer of large commercial trucks, buses and diesel engines, along with a 16.8 percent stake in Daihatsu, a manufacturer of kei cars, the smallest highway-legal passenger vehicles sold in Japan.[37] That began what became a long-standing partnership between Toyota and the two companies. As part of the partnership, Daihatsu would supply kei cars for Toyota to sell and to a lesser extent Toyota would supply full-sized cars for Daihatsu to sell (a process known as rebadging), allowing both companies to sell a full line-up of vehicles.\n\n\n\n### 1980s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)By the 1980s, the Toyota Corolla was one of the most popular cars in the world and became the world's all-time best-selling automobile.\nAfter the successes of the 1970s, and the threats of import restrictions, Toyota started making additional investments in the North American market in the 1980s. In 1981, Japan agreed to voluntary export restraints, which limited the number of vehicles the nation would send to the United States each year, leading Toyota to establish assembly plants in North America. The U.S. government also closed the loophole that allowed Toyota to pay lower taxes by building truck beds in America.\n\n\nAlso in 1981, Eiji Toyoda stepped down as president and assumed the title of chairman. He was succeeded as president by Shoichiro Toyoda, the son of the company's founder.[31] Within months, Shoichiro started to merge Toyota's sales and production organizations, and in 1982 the combined companies became the Toyota Motor Corporation. The two groups were described as \"oil and water\" and it took years of leadership from Shoichiro to successfully combine them into one organization.[38]\n\n\nEfforts to open a Toyota assembly plant in the United States started in 1980, with the company proposing a joint-venture with the Ford Motor Company. Those talks broke down in July 1981.[39] Eventually in 1984, the company struck a deal with General Motors (GM) to establish a joint-venture vehicle manufacturing plant called NUMMI (New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc.) in Fremont, California.[40] GM saw the joint venture as a way to get access to a quality small car and an opportunity to learn about The Toyota Way and the Toyota Production System. For Toyota, the factory gave the company its first manufacturing base in North America allowing it to avoid any future tariffs on imported vehicles and saw GM as a partner who could show them how to navigate the American labor environment. The plant would be led by Tatsuro Toyoda, the younger brother of company president Shoichiro Toyoda.[41] The first Toyota assembled in America, a white Corolla, rolled off the line at NUMMI on October 7, 1986.[42]\n\n\nToyota received its first Japanese Quality Control Award at the start of the 1980s and began participating in a wide variety of motorsports. Conservative Toyota held on to rear-wheel-drive designs for longer than most; while a clear first in overall production they were only third in production of front-wheel-drive cars in 1983, behind Nissan and Honda. In part due to this, Nissan's Sunny managed to squeeze by the Corolla in numbers built that year.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Lexus LS 400 went on sale in May 1989 and was seen as being largely responsible for the successful launch of Lexus.\nBefore the decade was out, Toyota introduced Lexus, a new division that was formed to market and service luxury vehicles in international markets. Prior to the debut of Lexus, Toyota's two existing flagship models, the Crown and Century, both catered exclusively for the Japanese market and had little global appeal that could compete with international luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar. The company had been developing the brand and vehicles in secret since August 1983, at a cost of over US$1 billion.[44][45] The LS 400 flagship full-size sedan debuted in 1989 to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque.\n\n\n\n### 1990s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Toyota Supra (JZA80) is one of the most recognized Japanese sports cars.\n![](image)Toyota Prius, first generation (NHW10 1997\u20132000)\nIn the 1990s, Toyota began to branch out from producing mostly compact cars by adding many larger and more luxurious vehicles to its lineup, including a full-sized pickup, the T100 (and later the Tundra), several lines of SUVs, a sport version of the Camry, known as the Camry Solara. They would also launch newer iterations of their sports cars, namely the MR2, Celica, and Supra during this era.\n\n\nDecember 1997 saw the introduction of the first-generation Toyota Prius, the first mass-produced gasoline-electric hybrid car.[46] The vehicle would be produced exclusively for the Japanese market for the first two years.\n\n\nWith a major presence in Europe, due to the success of Toyota Team Europe in motorsport, the corporation decided to set up Toyota Motor Europe Marketing and Engineering, TMME, to help market vehicles in the continent. Two years later, Toyota set up a base in the United Kingdom, TMUK, as the company's cars had become very popular among British drivers. Bases in Indiana, Virginia, and Tianjin were also set up.\n\n\nToyota also increased its ownership of Daihatsu during this period. In 1995, Toyota increased its shareholding in the company to 33.4 percent, giving Toyota the ability to veto shareholder resolutions at the annual meeting.[37] In 1998, Toyota increased its holding in the company to 51.2 percent, becoming the majority shareholder.[47]\n\n\nOn September 29, 1999, the company decided to list itself on the New York and London Stock Exchanges.\n\n\nThe later half of the 1990s would also see the Toyoda brothers step back from the company their father had founded. In 1992, Shoichiro Toyoda would shift to become chairman, allowing his brother Tatsuro to become president, a job he held until his retirement in 1995.[41] Shoichiro would step down as chairman in 1999. Both would retain honorary advisory roles in the company. Hiroshi Okuda would lead the company as president from 1995 until 1999 when he became chairman and the President's office would be filled by Fujio Cho.\n\n\n\n### 2000s[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2000, exports began of the Prius.[46] In 2001, Toyota acquired its long time partner, truck and bus manufacturer Hino Motors. In 2002, Toyota entered Formula One competition and established a manufacturing joint venture in France with French automakers Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot. A youth-oriented marque for North America, Scion, was introduced in 2003. Toyota ranked eighth on Forbes 2000 list of the world's leading companies for the year 2005.[48] Also in 2005, Fujio Cho would shift to become chairman of Toyota and would be replaced as president by Katsuaki Watanabe.\n\n\nIn 2007, Toyota released an update of its full-sized truck, the Tundra, produced in two American factories, one in Texas and one in Indiana. *Motor Trend* named the 2007 Toyota Camry \"Car of the Year\" for 2007. It also began the construction of two new factories, one in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, and the other in Blue Springs, Mississippi, USA.\n\n\nThe company was number one in global automobile sales for the first quarter of 2008.[49]\n\n\nToyota was hit by the global financial crisis of 2008 as it was forced in December 2008 to forecast its first annual loss in 70 years.[50] In January 2009, it announced the closure of all of its Japanese plants for 11 days to reduce output and stocks of unsold vehicles.[51]\n\n\nIn October 2009, Toyota announced that they were establishing an office in South Korea and launched the Camry sedan, Camry hybrid, Prius and the RAV4 during the launching event at the Grand Hyatt Seoul.[52]\n\n\nBetween 2009 and 2011, Toyota conducted recalls of millions of vehicles after reports that several drivers experienced unintended acceleration. The recalls were to prevent a front driver's side floor mat from sliding into the foot pedal well, causing the pedals to become trapped and to correct the possible mechanical sticking of the accelerator pedal.[53] At least 37 were killed in crashes allegedly related to unintended acceleration,[54] approximately 9 million cars and trucks were recalled,[55] Toyota was sued for personal injuries and wrongful deaths,[56] paid US$1 billion to settle a class action lawsuit to compensate owners for lost resale value,[57] and paid a US$1.2 billion criminal penalty to the United States government over accusations that it had intentionally hid information about safety defects and had made deceptive statements to protect its brand image.[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)Akio Toyoda was named President of Toyota in 2009, pictured in 2011.\nAmid the unintended acceleration scandal, Katsuaki Watanabe stepped down as company president. He was replaced by Akio Toyoda, grandson of company founder Kiichiro Toyoda, on June 23, 2009. Akio had been with Toyota since 1984, working jobs in production, marketing and product development, and took a seat on the board of directors in 2000.[59] Akio's promotion by the board marked the return of a member of the Toyoda family to the top leadership role for the first time since 1999.[60]\n\n\n\n### 2010s[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Toyota, along with large parts of the Japanese automotive industry, suffered from a series of natural disasters. The 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami led to a severe disruption of the supplier base and a drop in production and exports.[61][62] Severe flooding during the 2011 monsoon season in Thailand affected Japanese automakers that had chosen Thailand as a production base. Toyota is estimated to have lost production of 150,000 units to the tsunami and production of 240,000 units to the floods.\n\n\nOn February 10, 2014, it was announced that Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia by the end of 2017.[63][64] The decision was based on the unfavourable Australian dollar making exports not viable, the high cost of local manufacture, and the high amount of competition in a relatively small local market.[64] The company planned to consolidate its corporate functions in Melbourne by the end of 2017, and retain its Altona plant for other functions. The workforce is expected to be reduced from 3,900 to 1,300.[65] Both Ford Motor Company and General Motors (Holden) followed suit, ending Australian production in 2016 and 2017 respectively.\n\n\nThe automaker narrowly topped global sales for the first half of 2014, selling 5.1 million vehicles in the six months ending June 30, 2014, an increase of 3.8% on the same period the previous year. Volkswagen AG, which recorded sales of 5.07 million vehicles, was close behind.[66]\n\n\nIn August 2014, Toyota announced it would be cutting its spare-parts prices in China by up to 35%. The company admitted the move was in response to a probe foreshadowed earlier in the month by China's National Development and Reform Commission of Toyota's Lexus spare-parts policies, as part of an industry-wide investigation into what the Chinese regulator considers exorbitantly high prices being charged by automakers for spare parts and after-sales servicing.[67]\n\n\nIn November 2015, the company announced that it would invest US$1 billion over the next 5 years into artificial intelligence and robotics research.[68] In 2016, Toyota invested in Uber.[69] In 2020, a corporate governance report showed that Toyota owns 10.25 million shares of Uber, which was valued at $292.46 million as of March 30, 2020. According to Reuters, this was roughly 0.6 per cent of Uber's outstanding shares.[70]\n\n\nIn March 2016, Toyota partnered with Yanmar to create a fiberglass pleasure boat using Yanmar outboard marine diesel engines or Toyota inboard engines.[71]\n\n\nIn August 2016, the company purchased all remaining assets of Daihatsu, making the manufacturer of small cars a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota.[72]\n\n\nOn August 27, 2018, Toyota announced an investment of US$500 million in Uber's autonomous cars.[73]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Toyota backed the Trump Administration's proposal that federal authority should override California's ability to set its own emissions standards for automobiles. The proposal would reduce California's 2025 fuel efficiency standard from about 54.5 to 37 MPG.[74] This shift by Toyota away from fuel efficiency damaged the company's reputation as a green brand.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### 2020s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toyota Showroom in Shenzhen, China\nBy 2020, Toyota reclaimed its position as the largest automaker in the world, surpassing Volkswagen.[77] It sold 9.528 million vehicles globally despite an 11.3% drop in sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[77] This includes subsidiaries Daihatsu and Hino Motors.[77][78]\n\n\nOn April 2, 2020, BYD and Toyota announced a new joint venture between the two companies called BYD Toyota EV Technology Co., Ltd., with the aim of \"developing BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) that appeal to customers.\"[79]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Toyota, its subsidiary Hino, and Isuzu announced the creation of a strategic partnership between the three companies. Toyota acquired a 4.6% stake in Isuzu while the latter plans to acquire Toyota shares for an equivalent value. The three companies said they would form a new joint venture by April called Commercial Japan Partnership Technologies Corporation with the aim of developing fuel cell and electric light trucks. Toyota would own an 80% stake in the venture while Hino and Isuzu would own 10% each.[80]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Toyota said that it will buy Lyft's self-driving technology unit for $550 million and merge it with its newly created Woven Planet Holdings automation division.[81]\n\n\nIn June 2021, the company defended its donations to the United States Republican lawmakers after they voted against certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election, saying it did not believe it was \"appropriate to judge members of Congress\" for that one vote.[82] A report by Axios found that Toyota was the top donor to 2020 election objectors, by a substantial margin.[83] The company then reversed course in July 2021 and ceased donations to election objectors, releasing a statement saying it understood that its PAC's donations to those objectors, which far outpaced those of any other company, \"troubled some stakeholders.\"[84] Toyota resumed donations after a six-month pause.[85]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Toyota announced that it would invest \u00a58,000,000,000,000 ($70 billion at 2021 exchange rate) in electric vehicles by 2030, launch 30 EV models worldwide by that year, and set a sales target of 3.5 million electric vehicles in 2030.[86]\n\n\nToyota will increase its software engineer intake to around 40% to 50% of all technical hires from the second quarter of 2022, the move plans to address a transformation to so-called CASE \u2014 connected, autonomous, shared and electric \u2014 technologies in an environment of intensifying global competition.[87]\n\n\nIn 2021, Toyota told some of its suppliers to increase their semiconductor inventory levels from the conventional three months to five months in response to the COVID-19 chip shortage.[88] The \"just-in-time\" supply chain in which parts are only delivered when necessary, had already been revised after the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami in Japan, lifting inventories across the entire procurement network.[88] The time it takes Toyota to turn over its inventory increased by around 40% during the past ten years, to 36.36 days as of March\u00a02021[update].[88]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Toyota recalled 2,700 of its first mass-produced all-electric vehicles due to worries that their wheels could fall off during driving. It was discovered that the bolts on the bZ4X's wheels could loosen up to the point where the wheel simply detaches from the car, causing a loss of control over the vehicle and possible accident.[89]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Toyota pledged up to $5.6 billion towards production of electric vehicle battery production and announced an increase in investment in its plant near Greensboro, North Carolina.[90][91] Also in 2022, Toyota managed to maintain its position as the world's best-selling automaker for the third year in a row.[92][93]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Toyota CEO and President Akio Toyoda announced that he was stepping down and passing the position on to Koji Sato. Akio is the great-grandson of company founder Rizaburo Toyoda. Sato had previously run Lexus, Toyota's luxury car brand. The change is set to take effect on April 1, 2023.[94][95]\n\n\n\n## Board of directors[edit]\n\n\n* Chairman: Akio Toyoda (since April 2023)\n* Vice chairman: Shigeru Hayakawa\n* President & CEO: Koji Sato (since April 2023)\n* Members:\n\t+ Takeshi Uchiyamada\n\t+ James Kuffner\n\t+ Kenta Kon\n\t+ Masahiko Maeda\n\t+ Ikuro Sugawara\n\t+ Sir Philip Craven\n\t+ Teiko Kudo\n\n\n### List of former chairmen[edit]\n\n\n*In 1950, Toyota was split into Toyota Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Sales Co.

Toyota crossovers range from the subcompact Yaris Cross and C-HR, compact Corolla Cross and RAV4, to midsize Harrier/Venza and Kluger/Highlander.[107] Other crossovers include the Raize, Urban Cruiser.[108] Toyota SUVs range from the midsize Fortuner to full-size Land Cruiser.[107] Other SUVs include the Rush, Prado, FJ Cruiser, 4Runner, and Sequoia.[107]\n\n\n\n\n### Pickup trucks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nToyota Hilux (global)\n![](image)\nToyota Tacoma (US/Canada)\n\nToyota first entered the pickup truck market in 1947 with the SB that was only sold in Japan and limited Asian markets. It was followed in 1954 by the RK (renamed in 1959 as the Stout) and in 1968 by the compact Hilux. With continued refinement, the Hilux (simply known as the Pickup in some markets) became famous for being extremely durable and reliable.[109] Extended cab and crew cab versions were eventually added, and Toyota continues to produce them today under various names depending on the market in various cab lengths, with gasoline or diesel engines, and 2WD and 4WD versions.\n\n\nIn North America, the Hilux became a major model for the company, leading the company to launch the Tacoma in 1995.[110] The Tacoma was based on the Hilux, but with a design intended to better suit the needs of North American consumers who often use pickup trucks as personal vehicles. The design was a success and the Tacoma became the best-selling compact pickup in North America.\n\n\nAfter the success of its compact Hilux pickups in North America, Toyota decided to enter the full-size pickup market, which was traditionally dominated by domestic automakers. The company introduced the T100 for the 1993 US model year. The T100 had a full-size 8-foot (2.4\u00a0m) long bed, but suspension and engine characteristics were similar to that of a compact pickup. Sales were disappointing and the T100 was criticized for having a small V6 engine (especially compared to the V8 engines common in American full-size trucks), lacking an extended-cab version, being too small, and too expensive (because of the 25% tariff on imported trucks).[111] In 1995, Toyota added the more powerful V6 engine from the new Tacoma to the T100 and also added an extended cab version.[111] In 1999, Toyota replaced the T100 with the larger Tundra, which would be built in the US with a V8 engine and styling that more closely matched other American full-size trucks.[112]\n\n\n\n### Luxury vehicles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lexus\n\n![](image)Toyota Crown RS (fifteenth generation, S220; 2018)\nIn the Japanese home market, Toyota has two flagship models: the Crown premium sedan and the Century limousine.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Toyota wanted to expand its luxury car offerings but realized that existing Japanese-market flagship models had little global appeal and could not compete with established brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar or the Acura and Infiniti marquees being launched by Japanese competitors.\n\n\nBefore the decade was out, Toyota introduced Lexus, a new division that was formed to market and service luxury vehicles in markets outside of Japan. The company developed the brand and its vehicles in secret since August 1983, at a cost of over US$1 billion.[44][45] The Lexus LS flagship full-size sedan debuted in 1989 to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque. Subsequently, the division added sedan, coup\u00e9, convertible and SUV models.\n\n\nThe Lexus brand was introduced to the Japanese market in 2005, previously all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 to 2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque.\n\n\n\n### Buses[edit]\n\n\nThe Toyota Coaster is a minibus introduced in 1969 that seats 17 passengers. The Coaster is widely used in Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Australia, but also in the developing world for minibus operators in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, the Caribbean, and South America to operate as public transportation.\n\n\n\n## Technology[edit]\n\n\n### Hybrid electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Hybrid Synergy Drive and Toyota Prius\n\n![](image)The Toyota Prius, flagship of Toyota's hybrid technology, is the world's best-selling hybrid car.\nToyota is the world's leader in sales of hybrid electric vehicles, one of the largest companies to encourage the mass-market adoption of hybrid vehicles across the globe, and the first to commercially mass-produce and sell such vehicles, with the introduction of the Toyota Prius in 1997.[113][114] The company's series hybrid technology is called Hybrid Synergy Drive, and it was later applied to many vehicles in Toyota's product lineup, starting first with the Camry and the technology was also brought to the luxury Lexus division.\n\n\nAs of January\u00a02020[update], Toyota Motor Corporation sells 44 Toyota and Lexus hybrid passenger car models in over 90 countries and regions around the world, and the carmaker has sold over 15 million hybrid vehicles since 1997.[115] The Prius family is the world's top-selling hybrid gasoline-electric vehicle nameplate with almost 4 million units sold worldwide as of January 2017.[115]\n\n\n\n### Hydrogen fuel-cell[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Toyota Mirai\n\n![](image)The Toyota Mirai fuel-cell vehicle\n![](image)The Toyota SORA fuel-cell bus\nIn 2002, Toyota began a development and demonstration program to test the Toyota FCHV, a hybrid hydrogen fuel cell vehicle based on the Toyota Highlander production SUV. Toyota also built a FCHV bus based on the Hino Blue Ribbon City low-floor bus.[116][117] Toyota has built several prototypes/concepts of the FCHV since 1997, including the Toyota FCHV-1, FCHV-2, FCHV-3, FCHV-4, and Toyota FCHV-adv. The Toyota FCV-R fuel cell concept car was unveiled at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show. The FCV-R sedan seats four and has a fuel cell stack including a 70 MPa high-pressure hydrogen tank, which can deliver a range of 435\u00a0mi (700\u00a0km) under the Japanese JC08 test cycle. Toyota said the car was planned for launch in about 2015.[118]\n\n\nIn August 2012, Toyota announced its plans to start retail sales of a hydrogen fuel-cell sedan in California in 2015. Toyota expects to become a leader in this technology.[119] The prototype of its first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle will be exhibited at the November 2013 Tokyo Motor Show, and in the United States at the January 2014 Consumer Electronics Show.[120]\n\n\nToyota's first hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles to be sold commercially, the Toyota Mirai (Japanese for \"future\"), was unveiled at the November 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show.[121] In January 2015, it was announced that production of the Mirai fuel cell vehicle would increase from 700 units in 2015 to approximately 2,000 in 2016 and 3,000 in 2017.[122] Sales in Japan began on December 15, 2014, at a price of \u00a56,700,000 (~US$57,400). The Japanese government plans to support the commercialization of fuel-cell vehicles with a subsidy of \u00a52,000,000 (~US$19,600).[123] Retail sales in the U.S. began in August 2015 at a price of US$57,500 before any government incentives. Initially, the Mirai will only be available in California.[124][125] The market release in Europe is slated for September 2015, and initially will be available only in the UK, Germany, and Denmark, followed by other countries in 2017. Pricing in Germany starts at \u20ac60,000 (~US$75,140) plus VAT (\u20ac78,540).[126]\n\n\nIn 2015, Toyota released 5,600 patents for free use until 2020, hoping to promote global development of hydrogen fuel-cell technology.[127][128][129][130]\n\n\nSince the mid-2010s, Toyota has increased its focus on building hydrogen powered trucks. It first showcased a heavy-duty semi-truck tractor in 2017[131] and in 2023 announced a kit to convert existing diesel-powered truck engines to use hydrogen.[132] In late 2022, the company signed an \u00a311.3 million government deal with the UK's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to help it develop a hydrogen-powered Hilux pickup truck.[133]\n\n\n\n### Plug-in hybrids[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid and Toyota RAV4 Prime\n\n![](image)Second-generation Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid\nThe Prius Plug-In Hybrid Concept was exhibited in late 2009, and shortly after, a global demonstration program involving 600 pre-production test cars began. The vehicles were leased to fleet and government customers, and were equipped with data tracking devices to allow Toyota to monitor the car's performance. The vehicle was based on the third-generation Toyota Prius and outfitted with two additional lithium-ion batteries beyond the normal hybrid battery pack.[134] The additional batteries were used to operate the car with minimal use of the internal combustion engine until they are depleted, at which point they are disengaged from the system. They are not used in tandem with the main hybrid battery pack.\n\n\nAfter the conclusion of the demonstration program, the production version of the Prius Plug-in Hybrid was unveiled in September 2011. The production Prius Plug-in had a maximum electric-only speed of 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the vehicle as having an range of 18 kilometres (11\u00a0mi) in blended mode (mostly electric, but supplemented by the internal combustion engine).[135] Toyota ultimately only did a small production run with 75,400 vehicles being produced between 2012 and 2016.[136]\n\n\nThe second-generation Prius Plug-in (renamed the Prius Prime in the US) was unveiled in early 2016.[137] Unlike the prior generation, where the plug-in battery was limited by being added to the existing Prius, this model would be developed in tandem with the fourth-generation Prius, allowing Toyota to increase the range to 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi), with a top speed of 135\u00a0km/h (84\u00a0mph), without needing the assistance of the internal combustion engine.[138] The second-generation Prius Plug-in went on sale starting in late 2016, with Toyota expecting to sell up to 60,000 units globally per year.[139]\n\n\nA second plug-in hybrid model, the Toyota RAV4 PHV (RAV4 Prime in the US) was unveiled in December 2019. The vehicle has an EPA-estimated 68 kilometres (42\u00a0mi) of all-electric range and generates a combined 225 kilowatts (302\u00a0hp), enabling it to be Toyota's second fastest car currently in production (behind the GR Supra 3.0 sports car).[140] Sales started in mid-2020.\n\n\n\n### Battery electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toyota bZ4X\nToyota has been criticized for being slow to add battery electric vehicles to its lineup. It has been publicly skeptical of battery-electric vehicles, instead focusing on hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles,[141] and actively lobbying against government mandates to transition to zero-emissions vehicles.[142]\n\n\nAs of 2023[update], only a small only a small proportion of the vehicles the company sells are of battery electric, which has prompted criticism by some environmental and public interest groups.[143][144] The company plans to increase its sales of electric vehicles to 3.5 million per year by 2030.[86] However, the company has stated that it believes other technologies, including hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, will continue to play a role in the future of the company.[145][146]\n\n\nToyota created the first generation Toyota RAV4 EV (Electric Vehicle) as a compliance car after the California Air Resources Board mandated in the late 1990s that every automaker offer a zero-emissions vehicle.[147][148] A total of 1,484 were leased and/or sold in California from 1997 to 2003, when the state dropped its mandate under legal pressure from lawsuits filed by automakers.[149]\n\n\nA second generation of the RAV4 EV was developed in 2010 as part of a deal with Tesla. The production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from Tesla.[150][151] The RAV4 EV had a limited production run with just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014.[152][153] According to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was \"marred by clashes between engineers\".[154]\n\n\nStarting in 2009, Toyota introduced three generations of concept electric vehicles called the FT-EV built on a modified Toyota iQ platform. In late-2012, the company announced plans build a production version of the car called the Toyota iQ EV (Scion iQ EV in the US, Toyota eQ in Japan),[155] but ultimately production was cut back to 100 cars for special fleet use in Japan and the U.S. only.[141]\n\n\nIn late 2012, Toyota announced that it would back away from fully electric vehicles, after producing less than 5,000. At the time, the company's vice chairman, Takeshi Uchiyamada, said: \"*The current capabilities of electric vehicles do not meet society's needs, whether it may be the distance the cars can run, or the costs, or how it takes a long time to charge*.\"\n\n\nA shift in Toyota's formerly battery-agnostic posture could be seen as early as 2016, when Toyota's CFO Takahiko Ijichi \u201csent a strong signal that Toyota soon plans to jump on the battery bandwagon and make electric cars despite expressing skeptical views about their range and charging times,\u201d as the Wall Street Journal wrote.[156] Toyota said it would make and sell battery-electric vehicles if and where regulations and markets demand.\n\n\nA year later, Toyota outlined its electric-vehicle plans for between 2020 and 2030 to the press in Tokyo, saying it would introduce \"more than 10\" battery-electric vehicles worldwide by the early 2020s, beginning in China, and later in Japan, Europe, the US and India.[157]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Toyota introduced the C-HR EV, its first mass-produced pure electric model in China along with an identical twin called the IZOA EV.[158] It went on sale in April 2020 and May 2020 respectively. Nikkei reported in October 2020 that Toyota had only sold less than 2,000 units in the first eight months of the year.[159]\n\n\nToyota introduced the C+pod in late 2020, a 2-seater kei car with an estimated range of 100 kilometres (62\u00a0mi) and a top speed of 60 kilometres per hour (37\u00a0mph).[160][161]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda stated that electric cars are excessively \"hyped\" and that, in Japan, they would not necessarily reduce carbon dioxide emissions since electricity is mostly generated by burning coal and natural gas in the country. He also said that the infrastructure needed for Japan to switch fully to EVs would cost between $135 billion and $358 billion and switching only to EVs would cost millions of jobs and make cars less affordable.[162]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Toyota revealed the bZ4X, an electric crossover SUV that will be the first vehicle built on a dedicated electric platform called e-TNGA when it goes on sale in mid-2022.[163] It is the first model of the bZ (\"beyond Zero\") series of battery electric vehicles.[164] The company has also stated that there will be seven \"bZ\" models to be launched globally out of 15 BEV models by 2025.[165]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Transport & Environment ranked Toyota as the least ready OEM to transition to battery electric vehicles by 2030, stating: \"Toyota has not set a target for 2030 and it plans to produce just 10% BEVs in 2025. It is expected to rely on polluting hybrid technologies.\"[166]\n\n\n\n![](image)Akio Toyoda shows prototypes of 15 BEVs during Toyota's briefing on BEV strategies in December 2021.\nIn December 2021, Toyota announced in Tokyo plans for 30 battery-electric models by 2030, to sell 3.5 million BEVs per year by that date, and that its premium-brand Lexus will be 100% battery-operated by 2030 in North America, Europe, and China. The company announced investments of $70 billion into the company's electrification.[167]\n\n\nIn a session in parallel with the G-7 Meeting 2023 May, Akio Toyoda said that battery electric vehicles are not solely the future, instead offering a mix of battery electric, internal combustion engine-equipped and hydrogen cars.[144]\n\n\nToyota has been developing solid-state batteries in partnership with Panasonic, in which the company has more than a thousand patents covering solid-state batteries by late 2020.[168] The technology has been implemented on the Toyota LQ concept. Toyota hopes the technology could increase efficiency of battery electric vehicles by 30 percent, which in turn would reduce battery costs by the same amount.[168]\n\n\n\n### Autonomous vehicles[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Woven by Toyota, Inc.\n\n![](image)Toyota e-Palette\nToyota has is also regarded as lagging when it comes to developing smart car technology.[169] Although the company unveiled its first self-driving test vehicle in 2017, and has been developing its own self-driving technology named \"Chauffeur\" (intended for full self-driving) and \"Guardian\" (a driver assist system), neither of these has been introduced into any production vehicles.[170]\n\n\nThe company had set up a large research and development operation by 2018, spending almost US$4 billion to start an autonomous vehicle research institute in California's Silicon Valley[169] and another \u00a5300 billion on a similar research institute in Tokyo that would partner with fellow Toyota Group companies and automotive suppliers Aisin Seiki and Denso.[171][172]\n\n\nToyota has also been collaborating with autonomous vehicle technology developers and, in some cases, purchasing the companies. Toyota has acquired the autonomous vehicle division of ride-hailing service Lyft for $550 million,[173] invested a total of US$1 billion in competing ride-hailing service Uber's self-driving vehicle division,[174][175] invested $400 million in autonomous vehicle technology company Pony.ai,[176] and announced a partnership with Chinese electronics e-commerce company Cogobuy to build a \"Smart Car Ecosystem.\"[177]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Toyota showcased the 20-passenger \"e-Palette\" shared autonomous vehicle, which was used at the 2021 Tokyo Olympic Games.[178][179] Toyota has announced it intends to have the vehicle available for commercial applications before 2025.[180]\n\n\nSince February 2021, Toyota has been building the \"Woven City\" which it calls a \"175-acre high tech, sensor-laden metropolis\" at the foot of Mount Fuji. When completed in 2024, the Woven City will be used to run tests on autonomous vehicles for deliveries, transport and mobile shops, with the city's residents participating in the living laboratory experiment.[181][182]\n\n\n\n## Motorsports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota in motorsport\n\nSee also: Toyota Gazoo Racing and Toyota Racing Development\n\n![](image)The Toyota TS050 Hybrid that won the 2018 24 Hours of Le Mans, preserved with dirt from the race\nToyota has been involved in many global motorsports series, providing vehicles, engines and other auto parts under both the Toyota and Lexus brands.\n\n\nToyota Gazoo Racing (GR) is Toyota's performance brand that is used in many of the world's major motorsports contests. Toyota Gazoo Racing Europe, based in Cologne, Germany, competes in the FIA World Endurance Championship, while the Finland-based Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT participates in the FIA World Rally Championship. Toyota Gazoo Racing South Africa competes in the Dakar Rally. Between 2002 and 2009, the Toyota Racing team competed in Formula One. Toyota won the highest class of the 24 Hours of Le Mans 5 consecutive times from 2018 to 2022, competing with the Toyota TS050 Hybrid and Toyota GR010 Hybrid.\n\n\nToyota Racing Development USA (TRD USA) is responsible for participation in major motorsports contests in the United States including NASCAR, NHRA, Indy Racing League and Formula Drift.\n\n\nToyota also makes engines and other auto parts for other Japanese motorsports including Super Formula, Super GT, Formula 3, and Toyota Racing Series.\n\n\n\n## Non-automotive activities[edit]\n\n\n### Aerospace[edit]\n\n\nToyota is a minority shareholder in Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation, having invested US$67.2\u00a0million in the new venture which will produce the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, slated for first deliveries in 2017.[183] Toyota has also studied participation in the general aviation market and contracted with Scaled Composites to produce a proof of concept aircraft, the TAA-1, in 2002.[184][185]\n\n\n\n### Pleasure boats[edit]\n\n\nIn 1997, building on a previous partnership with Yamaha Marine, Toyota created \"Toyota Marine\",[186] building private ownership motorboats, currently sold only in Japan. A small network in Japan sells the luxury craft at 54 locations, called the \"Toyota Ponam\" series, and in 2017, a boat was labeled under the Lexus brand name starting May 26, 2017.[187]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Toyota Municipal Museum of Art in Aichi, sponsored by the manufacturer\nToyota supports a variety of philanthropic work in areas such as education, conservation, safety, and disaster relief.\n\n\nSome of the organizations that Toyota has worked with in the US include the American Red Cross, the Boys and Girls Club, Leaders in Environmental Action for the Future (LEAF), and the National Center for Family Literacy.[188]\n\n\nThe Toyota USA Foundation exists to support education in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.[189]\n\n\nIn addition, Toyota works with nonprofits to improve their processes and operations such as the Food Bank For New York City.[190][191]\n\n\nToyota also supports a variety of work in Japan.[192]\n\n\nThe Toyota Foundation takes a global perspective providing grants in the three areas of human and natural environments, social welfare, and education and culture.[193]\n\n\n\n### Higher education[edit]\n\n\nToyota established the Toyota Technological Institute in 1981, as Sakichi Toyoda had planned to establish a university as soon as he and Toyota became successful. Toyota Technological Institute founded the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago in 2003. Toyota is supporter of the Toyota Driving Expectations Program, Toyota Youth for Understanding Summer Exchange Scholarship Program, Toyota International Teacher Program, Toyota TAPESTRY, Toyota Community Scholars (scholarship for high school students), United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Internship Program, and Toyota Funded Scholarship.[194] It has contributed to a number of local education and scholarship programs for the University of Kentucky, Indiana, and others.[194]\n\n\n\n### Robotics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota Partner Robot\n\n![](image)Toyota trumpet-playing robot\nIn 2004, Toyota showcased its trumpet-playing robot.[195] Toyota has been developing multitask robots destined for elderly care, manufacturing, and entertainment. A specific example of Toyota's involvement in robotics for the elderly is the Brain Machine Interface. Designed for use with wheelchairs, it \"allows a person to control an electric wheelchair accurately, almost in real-time\", with his or her mind.[196] The thought controls allow the wheelchair to go left, right, and forward with a delay between thought and movement of just 125\u00a0milliseconds.[196] Toyota also played a part in the development of Kirobo, a 'robotic astronaut'.\n\n\nIn 2017, the company introduced T-HR3, a humanoid robot with the ability to be remotely controlled. The robot can copy the motions of a connected person. The 2017 version used wires for the connection but the 2018 version used 5G from a distance up to 10\u00a0km.[197][198]\n\n\n\n### Agricultural biotechnology[edit]\n\n\nToyota invests in several small start-up businesses and partnerships in biotechnology, including:\n\n\n\n* P.T. Toyota Bio Indonesia in Lampung, Indonesia\n* Australian Afforestation Pty. Ltd. in Western Australia and Southern Australia\n* Toyota Floritech Co., Ltd. in Rokkasho-Mura, Kamikita District, Aomori Prefecture\n* Sichuan Toyota Nitan Development Co., Ltd. in Sichuan, China\n* Toyota Roof Garden Corporation in Miyoshi-Cho, Aichi Prefecture\n\n\n### Sewing machine brand[edit]\n\n\nAisin, another member of the Toyota Group of companies, uses the same Toyota wordmark logo to market its home-use sewing machines. Aisin was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda after he founded the Toyota Motor Corporation. According to Aisin, he was so pleased with the first sewing machine, he decided to apply the same Toyota branding as his auto business, despite the companies being independent from each other.[199]\n\n\n\n### Carbon removal[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Carbon capture and utilization, Carbon footprint, Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, and Heterogeneous catalysis\n\nToyota Ventures, along with JetBlue Technology Ventures and Parley for the Oceans, is among the corporate investors that have invested $40 million in the Air Company, a carbon negative vodka distiller and perfume and hand sanitizer manufacturer that uses heterogeneous catalysis to convert captured carbon into ethanol.[200]\n\n\n\n### Environmental initiatives[edit]\n\n\nToyota states it is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and it has set a goal to reduce its overall carbon emissions by 90% by 2050, compared to 2010 levels.[201][202]\n\n\nThe company has invested heavily in solar energy, with a goal to install solar panels on the rooftops of all its dealerships worldwide by 2050.[203] In addition, Toyota has partnered with various renewable energy companies to promote the use of wind and solar power, including a recent partnership with ENEOS Corporation to develop hydrogen refueling stations in Japan.[204]\n\n\nToyota has launched a program called \"Global Environmental Challenge\" 2050 which is a comprehensive initiative aimed at reducing the environmental impact of Toyota's operations. The challenge includes six environmental goals that Toyota aims to achieve by 2050, including reducing carbon emissions, minimizing water usage, promoting the recycling and reuse of materials, and promoting the use of renewable energy.[205] The company has also implemented a variety of initiatives to promote sustainability across its supply chain, including efforts to reduce waste, water usage, and promote sustainable agriculture. For example, Toyota has implemented a zero-waste initiative at its manufacturing plants, aiming to send zero waste to landfills.[206]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Corrosion lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2016, Toyota agreed to pay $3.4 billion to settle allegations that roughly one-and-a-half million of its Tacoma, Tundra, and Sequoia pickup trucks and SUVs had been outfitted with frames prone to corrosion and perforation. According to court papers, the corrosion could reach levels high enough to compromise the vehicle's structural integrity.[207]\n\n\n\n### Death from overwork[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Kar\u014dshi\n\nOn February 9, 2002, Kenichi Uchino, aged 30 years, a quality control manager, collapsed then died at work.[208][209] On January 2, 2006, an unnamed chief engineer of the Camry Hybrid, aged 45 years, died from heart failure in his bed.[208]\n\n\n\n### Fines for environmental breaches[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Toyota was fined $34 million for violating the United States Clean Air Act, as 2.2 million vehicles it sold had defective smog-control computers.[210]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Toyota was fined $180 million for delays in reporting emissions-related defects to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) between 2005 and 2015.[76][211][212] The acting U.S. attorney said that the delays \"likely led to delayed or avoided emissions-related recalls\", although Toyota stated that despite the delays in reporting the issues to the EPA, it had notified customers and fixed the cars with the emissions defects.[212] At the time, this was the biggest civil penalty ever levied for violating the EPA's emission reporting requirements.[76][211]\n\n\n\n### 2009\u20132011 unintended acceleration recalls[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2009\u20132011 Toyota vehicle recalls\n\nBetween 2009 and 2011 Toyota, under pressure from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), conducted recalls of millions of vehicles after reports that several drivers experienced unintended acceleration. The first recall, in November 2009, was to prevent a front driver's side floor mat from sliding into the foot pedal well, causing the pedals to become trapped. The second recall, in January 2010, was begun after some crashes were shown not to have been caused by floor mats and may be caused by possible mechanical sticking of the accelerator pedal.[53] Worldwide, approximately 9 million cars and trucks were impacted by the recalls.[55]\n\n\nNHTSA received reports of a total of 37 deaths allegedly related to unintended acceleration, although an exact number was never verified.[54] As a result of the problems, Toyota faced nearly 100 lawsuits from the families of those killed, drivers who were injured, vehicle owners who lost resale value, and investors who saw a drop in the value of their shares. While most of the personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits were settled confidentially,[56] Toyota did spend more than US$1 billion to settle a class action lawsuit to compensate owners for lost resale value,[57] and the company agreed to pay a US$1.2 billion criminal penalty to the United States government over accusations that it had intentionally hid information about safety defects from the public and had made deceptive statements to protect its brand image. The penalty was the largest ever levied against a car company.[58]\n\n\n\n### Takata airbag recalls[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Takata airbag recalls\n\nToyota was impacted by a recall of faulty airbag inflators made by Takata. The inflators can explode, shooting metal fragments into the vehicle cabin. Millions of vehicles produced between 2000 and 2014 were impacted by the recall, with some needing multiple repairs.[213][214]\n\n\n\n### June 2010 Chinese labour strike[edit]\n\n\nOn June 21, 2010, a Chinese labor strike happened in Tianjin Toyoda Gosei Co, Tianjin. Workers demanded better wages and treatment.[215]\n\n\n\n### Extremist usage[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, U.S. officials asked Toyota how the Islamic State was in possession of so many Toyota trucks.[216] Toyota cars have also been documented to have been used by other extremist organizations such as the Taliban, Hamas, Al-shabab and Somali pirates.[217][218][219] Toyota representatives have said the company has a strict policy of to not sell vehicles to potential purchasers who may use or modify them for paramilitary or terrorist activities and that it cannot track aftermarket sales and that it has worked with the U.S Treasury to brief them on Toyota's supply chain on the Middle East.[220]\n\n\n\n### Misleading marketing[edit]\n\n\nIn its marketing, Toyota has often referred to its non-plug-in hybrid vehicles as \"self-charging hybrid\" vehicles. The use of the term has caused some criticism that this is misleading, as some consumers were led to erroneously believe that these vehicles charge their batteries on their own when the vehicles are not used.[221][222] Complaints about self-charging hybrid advertising were recorded in Ireland, although the complaints were rejected by the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland.[223] However, in 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Authority banned the adverts outright in Norway, stating: \"It is misleading to give the impression that the power to the hybrid battery is free of charge, since the electricity produced by the car has consumption of gasoline as a necessary condition.\"[224]\n\n\nElectric vehicle website IrishEVs criticised Toyota Ireland for paying University College Dublin to conduct a study of only seven examples of their hybrid cars over seven days to make a press release about the efficiency of the vehicles.[225][226] The website also criticised Toyota Ireland for using opinion polls to substantiate a claim about their CO2 emissions on Twitter.[227]\n\n\n\n### Rigging of crash test results[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2023, it was revealed that Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu had cheated by rigging some models to perform better in crash tests than actual production cars. The vehicles in question had a notch in the interior panel of the front door which avoided the possibility of the collision creating a sharp edge that could have injured an occupant when the side airbag deployed. This notch was present on the tested vehicles but not on vehicles sold to the public.[228]\n\n\nThe issue affected four models, the Toyota Yaris Ativ (also known as the Vios), Perodua Axia, Toyota Agya, and an undisclosed upcoming product. No recall was conducted over the issue.[228]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Principal headquarters building of Toyota\nToyota is headquartered in the city of Toyota,[229] which was named Koromo until 1951, when it changed its name to match the automaker. Toyota City is located in the Aichi Prefecture of Japan. The main headquarters of Toyota is located in a four-story building that has been described as \"modest\".[230] In 2013, company CEO Akio Toyoda reported that it had difficulties retaining foreign employees at the headquarters due to the lack of amenities in the city.[231]\n\n\nSurrounding the headquarters are the 14-story Toyota Technical Center and the Honsha plant (which was established in 1938). Toyota and its Toyota Group affiliates operate a total of 17 manufacturing facilities in Aichi Prefecture and a total of 32 plants in Japan.\n\n\nToyota also operates offices in Bunkyo, Tokyo, and Nakamura-ku, Nagoya.[229]\n\n\n\n\n### Worldwide presence[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Toyota manufacturing facilities\n\n\n\n| Top 10 Toyota and Lexus vehicle salesby country, 2022[232] |\n| --- |\n| Rankin Toyota\n | Location\n | Vehiclesales\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 2.108,460\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0China | 1.940,590\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 1.289,132\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0GCC | 390,294\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image)\u00a0Indonesia | 330,498\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image)\u00a0Thailand | 288,810\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image)\u00a0Australia | 238,139\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 200,205\n |\n| 9\n | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 191,653\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image)\u00a0Philippines | 174,106\n |\n\n\nOutside of Japan, as one of the world's largest automotive manufacturer by production volume, Toyota has factories in most parts of the world. The company assembles vehicles in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, the Czech Republic, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela.\n\n\nAdditionally, the company also has joint venture, licensed, or contract factories in China, France, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Taiwan, the United States, and Vietnam.\n\n\n\n#### North America[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota Motor North America\n\n![](image)The Toyota Camry is assembled in several facilities around the world including Australia, China, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia, Thailand, India, Vietnam, and the United States.\nToyota Motor North America is headquartered in Plano, Texas, and operates as a holding company for all operations of the Toyota Motor Corporation in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Toyota's operations in North America began on October 31, 1957, and the current company was established in 2017 from the consolidation of three companies: Toyota Motor North America, Inc., which controlled Toyota's corporate functions; Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. which handled marketing, sales, and distribution in the United States; and Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing North America which oversaw operations at all assembly plants in the region. While all three companies continue to exist in legal name, they operate as one company out of one headquarters campus.\n\n\nToyota has a large presence in the United States with six major assembly plants in Huntsville, Alabama, Georgetown, Kentucky, Princeton, Indiana, San Antonio, Texas, Buffalo, West Virginia, and Blue Springs, Mississippi. In 2018, Toyota and Mazda announced a joint venture plant that will produce vehicles in Huntsville, Alabama, starting in 2021.[233]\n\n\nIt has started producing larger trucks, such as the new Tundra, to go after the full-size pickup market in the United States. Toyota is also pushing hybrid electric vehicle in the US such as the Prius, Camry Hybrid, Highlander Hybrid, and various Lexus products. Currently, Toyota has no plans to offer diesel motor options in its North American products, including pickup trucks.[234]\n\n\nToyota Canada Inc., which is part of Toyota Motor North America, handles marketing, sales, and distribution in Canada. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada operates three assembly plants: two in Cambridge, Ontario and one in Woodstock, Ontario.[235] In 2006, Toyota's subsidiary Hino Motors opened a heavy duty truck plant, also in Woodstock, employing 45 people and producing 2,000 trucks annually.[236]\n\n\n\n#### Europe/Western Asia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota Motor Europe\n\n\n\n| Top 10 Toyota and Lexus vehicle productionby country, 2022[232] |\n| --- |\n| Rankin Toyota\n | Location\n | Vehicleproduction\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 2,656,009\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0China | 1,839,772\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 1,129,988\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0Thailand | 659,252\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 433,077\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image)\u00a0Indonesia | 268,150\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image)\u00a0Mexico | 267,775\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image)\u00a0France | 255,936\n |\n| 9\n | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 224,272\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image)\u00a0Turkey | 215,798\n |\n\n\nToyota Motor Europe is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, and oversees all operations of the Toyota Motor Corporation in Europe and western Asia. Toyota's operations in Europe began in 1963. Toyota has a significant presence in Europe with nine production facilities in Kol\u00edn, Czech Republic, Burnaston, England, Deeside, England, Onnaing, France, Jelcz-Laskowice, Poland, Wa\u0142brzych, Poland, Ovar, Portugal, Saint Petersburg, Russia, and Arifiye, Turkey.[237] Toyota also operates a joint venture plant with Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot in Valenciennes, France.\n\n\n\n#### Australia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota Australia\n\nIn 1963, Australia was one of the first countries to assemble Toyotas outside Japan. However, in February 2014, Toyota was the last of Australia's major automakers to announce the end of production in Australia. The closure of Toyota's Australian plant was completed on October 3, 2017, and had produced a total 3,451,155 vehicles. At its peak in October 2007, Toyota manufactured 15,000 cars a month.[238] Before Toyota, Ford and GM's Holden had announced similar moves, all citing an unfavorable currency and attendant high manufacturing costs.[239]\n\n\n\n### Financials[edit]\n\n\nToyota is publicly traded on the Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka, and Sapporo exchanges under company code TYO: 7203. In Japan, Toyota's stock is a component of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Core30 indices.\n\n\nIn addition, Toyota is foreign-listed on the New York Stock Exchange under NYSE:\u00a0TM and on the London Stock Exchange under LSE:\u00a0TYT.\n\n\nToyota has been publicly traded in Japan since 1949 and internationally since 1999.[240]\n\n\n\n## Company strategy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)New Toyota factory in Ohira, near Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan: A month after this picture was taken, the region was devastated by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. The plant was only lightly damaged, but remained closed more than a month, mainly due to lack of supplies and energy, in addition to a badly damaged Sendai port.\n### The Toyota Way[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Toyota Way\n\nThe Toyota Way is a set of principles and behaviors that underlie the company's approach to management and production (which is further defined as the Toyota Production System).\n\n\nThe company has been developing its corporate philosophy since 1948 and passing it on as implicit knowledge to new employees, but as the company expanded globally, leaders officially identified and defined the Toyota Way in 2001. Toyota summarized it under two main pillars: continuous improvement and respect for people. Under the continuous improvement pillar are three principles: challenge (form a long-term vision), kaizen (a continual improvement process), and genchi genbutsu (\"go and see\" the process to make correct decisions). Under the respect for people pillar are two principles: respect and teamwork.[241]\n\n\nIn 2004, Dr. Jeffrey Liker, a University of Michigan professor of industrial engineering, published *The Toyota Way*. In his book, Liker calls the Toyota Way \"a system designed to provide the tools for people to continually improve their work.\"[242] According to Liker, there are 14 principles of The Toyota Way that can be organized into four themes: (1) long-term philosophy, (2) the right process will produce the right results, (3) add value to the organization by developing your people, and (4) continuously solving root problems drives organizational learning. The 14 principles are further defined in the Wikipedia article on The Toyota Way.\n\n\n\n### Toyota Production System[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toyota Production System\n\nThe Toyota Way also helped shape the company's approach to production, where it was an early pioneer of what would be come to be known as lean manufacturing.[243] The company defines the Toyota Production System under two main pillars: just-in-time[244] (make only what is needed, only when it is needed, and only in the amount that is needed) and Jidoka[245] (automation with a human touch).\n\n\nThe origin of the Toyota Production System is in dispute, with three stories of its origin: (1) that during a 1950 trip to train with the Ford Motor Company, company executives also studied the just-in-time distribution system of the grocery store company Piggly-Wiggly,[246] (2) that they followed the writings of W. Edwards Deming,[247] and (3) they learned the principles from a WWII US government training program (Training Within Industry).[248]\n\n\nAfter developing the Toyota Production System in its own facilities, the company began teaching the system to its parts suppliers in the 1990s. Other companies were interested in the instruction, and Toyota later started offering training sessions. The company also has donated the training to non-profit groups to increase their efficiency and thus ability to serve people.\n\n\n\n### Logo and branding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Employee at the Toyota Automobile Museum explains development of Toyota name and brand.\nIn 1936, Toyota entered the passenger car market with its Model AA and held a competition to establish a new logo emphasizing speed for its new product line. After receiving 27,000 entries, one was selected that additionally resulted in a change of its moniker to \"Toyota\" from the family name \"Toyoda\", which means rice paddy. The new name was believed to sound better, and its eight-stroke count in the Japanese language was associated with wealth and good fortune. The original logo was a heavily stylized version of the katakana characters for Toyota (\u30c8\u30e8\u30bf).[249]\n\n\nAs the company started to expand internationally in the late 1950s, the katakana character logo was supplemented by various wordmarks with the English form of the company name in all capital letters, \"TOYOTA.\"[249]\n\n\nToyota introduced a worldwide logo in October 1989 to commemorate the 50th year of the company, and to differentiate it from the newly released luxury Lexus brand.[250] The logo consists of three ovals that combine to form the letter \"T\", which stands for Toyota. Toyota says that the overlapping of the two perpendicular ovals inside the larger oval represents the mutually beneficial relationship and trust between the customer and the company while the larger oval surrounding both of these inner ovals represents the \"global expansion of Toyota's technology and unlimited potential for the future\".[251][252] The new logo started appearing on all printed material, advertisements, dealer signage, and most vehicles in 1990.\n\n\nIn countries or regions using traditional Chinese characters, e.g. Hong Kong and Taiwan, Toyota is known as \"\u8c50\u7530\".[253] In countries using simplified Chinese characters (e.g. China and Singapore), Toyota is written as \"\u4e30\u7530\"[254] (pronounced as *F\u0113ngti\u00e1n* in Mandarin Chinese and *H\u0254ng Tshan* in Minnanese). These are the same characters as the founding family's name \"Toyoda\" in Japanese.\n\n\n\n![](image)Some new vehicles, like this Tacoma, still use the heritage TOYOTA wordmark.\nToyota still uses the katakana character logo as its corporate emblem in Japan, including on the headquarters building,[255] and some special edition models still use the \"TOYOTA\" wordmark on the grille as a nod to the company's heritage.[256]\n\n\nOn July 15, 2015, the company was delegated its own generic top-level domain, .toyota.[257]\n\n\n\n### Sports sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nToyota sponsors several teams and has purchased naming rights for several venues, and even competitions, including:\n\n\n\n* Toyota Alvark Tokyo, basketball team\n* Toyota Arena, Ontario, California\n* Toyota Cup\n* Toyota Center, Houston, Texas\n* Toyota Center, Kennewick, Washington\n* Toyota Field, San Antonio, Texas\n* Toyota Park, Bridgeview, Illinois\n* Toyota Sports Center, El Segundo, California\n* Toyota Stadium, Georgetown, Kentucky\n* Toyota Stadium, Frisco, Texas\n\n\nAs of 2017[update], Toyota is an official sponsor of Cricket Australia,[258] the England and Wales Cricket Board[259] and the AFL.[260] In March 2015, Toyota became a sponsor partner for the Olympic Games, in the form of supplying vehicles and communications between vehicles until 2024.[261]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* List of Toyota engines\n* List of Toyota manufacturing facilities\n* List of Toyota transmissions\n* List of Toyota vehicles\n* Nagoya Grampus, formerly the company's football club and still sponsored by them\n* Toyota model codes\n* Toyota Verblitz, the company's rugby team\n* Toyota War, a conflict between Libya and Chad which saw a heavy use of Toyota's pickup trucks.\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Toyota Global Sales and Production Secures 90 Percent Level Year-on-Year in FY2021\" (Press release).

By sales, it was the largest automaker in the United States in 2022, and was the largest in the world for 77 years before losing the top spot to Toyota in 2008.[4][5]\n\n\nGeneral Motors operates manufacturing plants in eight countries.[6] In addition to its four core brands, GM also holds interests in Chinese brands Baojun and Wuling via SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile.[2] GM further owns the BrightDrop delivery vehicle manufacturer,[7] a namesake defense vehicles division which produces military vehicles for the United States government and military,[8] the vehicle safety, security, and information services provider OnStar,[9] the auto parts company ACDelco, a namesake financial lending service, and majority ownership in the self-driving cars enterprise Cruise LLC.\n\n\nThe company traces itself to a holding company for Buick established on September 16, 1908, by William C. Durant, the largest seller of horse-drawn vehicles at the time. The first half of the 20th century saw the company grow into an automotive behemoth through acquisitions; going into the second half, the company pursued innovation and new offerings to consumers as well as collaborations with NASA to develop the earliest electric vehicles.[10][11] The current entity was established in 2009 after the General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization.[12]\n\n\nToday, General Motors remains a successful company, ranking 25th by total revenue out of all American companies on the *Fortune 500* and 50th on the *Fortune Global 500*.[13][14] The company is presently heavily pursuing electric vehicles, as GM announced plans in January 2021 to end production and sales of vehicles using internal combustion engines, including hybrid vehicles and plug-in hybrids, by 2035, as part of its plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of General Motors\n\n### Founding and consolidation[edit]\n\n\nBy 1900, William C. Durant's Durant-Dort Carriage Company of Flint, Michigan had become the largest manufacturer of horse-drawn vehicles in the United States.[16] Durant was averse to automobiles, but fellow Flint businessman James H. Whiting, owner of Flint Wagon Works, sold him the Buick Motor Company in 1904.[17] Durant formed the General Motors Company in 1908 as a holding company, with partner Charles Stewart Mott, borrowing a naming convention from General Electric.[18] GM's first acquisition was Buick, which Durant already owned, then Olds Motor Works on November 12, 1908.[19] Under Durant, GM went on to acquire Cadillac, Elmore, Welch, Cartercar, Oakland (the predecessor of Pontiac), the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company of Pontiac, Michigan, and the Reliance Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan (predecessors of GMC) in 1909.\n\n\nDurant, with the board's approval, also tried acquiring Ford Motor Company, but needed an additional $2 million.[20] Durant over-leveraged GM in making acquisitions, and was removed by the board of directors in 1910 at the order of the bankers who backed the loans to keep GM in business.[17] The action of the bankers was partially influenced by the Panic of 1910\u20131911 that followed the earlier enforcement of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. In 1911, Charles F. Kettering of Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (DELCO) and Henry M. Leland invented and patented the first electric starter in America.[21] In November 1911, Durant co-founded Chevrolet with Swiss race car driver Louis Chevrolet, who left the company in 1915 after a disagreement with Durant.[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)General Motors Company share certificate issued October 13, 1916\nGM was reincorporated in Detroit in 1916 as General Motors Corporation and became a public company via an initial public offering. By 1917, Chevrolet had become successful enough that Durant, with the backing of Samuel McLaughlin and Pierre S. du Pont, reacquired a controlling interest in GM. The same year, GM acquired Samson Tractor.[23] Chevrolet Motor Company was consolidated into GM on May 2, 1918, and the same year GM acquired United Motors, a parts supplier founded by Durant and headed by Alfred P. Sloan for $45 million, and the McLaughlin Motor Car Company, founded by R. S. McLaughlin, became General Motors of Canada Limited.[24][25][26] In 1919, GM acquired Guardian Frigerator Company, part-owned by Durant, which was renamed Frigidaire. Also in 1919, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC), which provides financing to automotive customers, was formed.[27][17]\n\n\nIn 1920, du Pont orchestrated the removal of Durant once again and replaced him with Alfred P. Sloan.[28] At a time when GM was competing heavily with Ford Motor Company, Sloan established annual model changes, making previous years' models \"dated\" and created a market for used cars.[29] He also implemented the pricing strategy used by car companies today. The pricing strategy had Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac priced from least expensive to most, respectively.[30][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nIn 1921, Thomas Midgley Jr., an engineer for GM, discovered tetraethyllead (leaded gasoline) as an antiknock agent, and GM patented the compound because ethanol could not be patented.[31] This led to the development of higher compression engines resulting in more power and efficiency. The public later realized that lead contained in the gasoline was harmful to various biological organisms including humans.[32] Evidence shows that corporate executives understood the health implications of tetraethyllead from the beginning.[33] As an engineer for GM, Midgley also developed chlorofluorocarbons, which have now been banned due to their contribution to climate change.[34]\n\n\nUnder the encouragement of GM President Alfred P. Sloan Jr., GM acquired Vauxhall Motors for $2.5 million in 1925.[35] The company also acquired an interest in the Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company the same year, and its president, John D. Hertz, joined the board of directors of GM; it acquired the remainder of the company in 1943.[17]\n\n\n\n### Growth and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nIn 1926, the company introduced the Pontiac brand and established the General Motors Group Insurance Program to provide life insurance to its employees.[17] The following year, after the success of the 1927 model of the Cadillac LaSalle designed by Harley Earl, Sloan created the \"Art and Color Section\" of GM and named Earl as its first director. Earl was the first design executive to be appointed to leadership at a major American corporation. Earl created a system of automobile design that is still practiced today.[36] At the age of 24, Bill Mitchell was recruited by Harley Earl to the design team at GM, and he was later appointed as Chief Designer of Cadillac. After Earl retired in December 1958, Mitchell took over automotive design for GM.[37] Also in 1926 the company acquired Fisher Body, its supplier of automobile bodies.[38]\n\n\nGM acquired Allison Engine Company[17][39] and began developing a 1,000 horsepower liquid-cooled aircraft engine in 1929.[17] The same year, GM acquired 80% of Opel, which at that time had a 37.5% market share in Europe, for $26 million. It acquired the remaining 20% in 1931.[35]\n\n\nIn the late-1920s, Charles Kettering embarked on a program to develop a lightweight two-stroke diesel engine for possible usage in automobiles.[40] Soon after, GM acquired Electro-Motive Company and the Winton Engine Co., and in 1941, it expanded EMC's realm to locomotive engine manufacturing.[41]\n\n\nIn 1932, GM acquired Packard Electric[17][42] (not the Packard car company, which merged with Studebaker years later). The following year, GM acquired a controlling interest in North American Aviation and merged it with the General Aviation Manufacturing Corporation.[43]\n\n\nThe GM labor force participated in the formation of the United Auto Workers labor union in 1935, and in 1936 the UAW organized the Flint Sit-Down Strike, which initially idled two key plants in Flint, Michigan, and later spread to 6 other plants including those in Janesville, Wisconsin and Fort Wayne, Indiana. In Flint, police attempted to enter the plant to arrest strikers, leading to violence; in other cities, the plants were shuttered peacefully. The strike was resolved on February 11, 1937, when GM recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for its workers and gave workers a 5% raise and permission to speak in the lunchroom.[44]\n\n\nWalter E. Jominy and A.L. Boegehold of GM invented the Jominy end-quench test for hardenability of carbon steel in 1937, a breakthrough in heat treating still in use today as ASTM A255.[45] GM established Detroit Diesel the next year.[46]\n\n\nIn 1939, the company founded Motors Insurance Corporation and entered the vehicle insurance market.[27] The same year, GM introduced the Hydramatic, the first affordable and successful automatic transmission, for the 1940 Oldsmobile.[47][48]\n\n\n\n* ![1926 Pontiac radiator logo](image)\n\n1926 Pontiac radiator logo\n* ![1928 Pontiac Series 6-28 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan](image)\n\n1928 Pontiac Series 6-28 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan\n* ![1932 Pontiac Series 402 Six 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan](image)\n\n1932 Pontiac Series 402 Six 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan\n* ![1936 Pontiac Master Six Series 6BB Coupe](image)\n\n1936 Pontiac Master Six Series 6BB Coupe\n\nDuring World War II, GM produced vast quantities of armaments, vehicles, and aircraft for the Allies of World War II. In 1940, GM's William S. Knudsen served as head of U.S. wartime production for President Franklin Roosevelt, and by 1942, all of GM's production was to support the war.[49] GM's Vauxhall Motors manufactured the Churchill tank series for the Allies, instrumental in the North African campaign.[17] However, its Opel division, based in Germany, supplied the Nazi Party with vehicles. Sloan, head of GM at the time, was an ardent opponent of the New Deal, which bolstered labor unions and public transport, and Sloan admired and supported Adolf Hitler.[50] Nazi armaments chief Albert Speer allegedly said in 1977 that Hitler \"would never have considered invading Poland\" without synthetic fuel technology provided by General Motors. GM was compensated $32 million by the U.S. government because its German factories were bombed by U.S. forces during the war.[51]\n\n\nEffective January 28, 1953, Charles Erwin Wilson, then GM president, was named by Dwight D. Eisenhower as United States Secretary of Defense.[17]\n\n\nIn December 1953, GM acquired Euclid Trucks, a manufacturer of heavy equipment for earthmoving, including dump trucks, loaders and wheel tractor-scrapers, which later spawned the Terex brand.[52][53]\n\n\n\n### Periods of innovation[edit]\n\n\nAlfred P. Sloan retired as chairman and was succeeded by Albert Bradley in April 1956.[54]\n\n\nIn 1962, GM introduced the first turbo charged engine in the world for a car in the Oldsmobile Cutlass Turbo-Jetfire.[17][55] Two years later, the company introduced its \"Mark of Excellence\" logo and trademark at the 1964 New York World's Fair. The company used the mark as their main corporate identifier until 2021.[56]\n\n\nGM released the Electrovan in 1966, the first hydrogen fuel cell car ever produced.[57] Though fuel cells have existed since the early 1800s, General Motors was the first to use a fuel cell, supplied by Union Carbide, to power the wheels of a vehicle with a budget of \"millions of dollars\".[58][59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)An advertisement for the 1969 Chevrolet Nova using the advertising slogan *\"Putting you first, keeps us first\"*\nIn the 1960s, GM was the first to use turbochargers and was an early proponent of V6 engines, but quickly lost interest as the popularity of muscle cars increased. GM demonstrated gas turbine vehicles powered by kerosene, an area of interest throughout the industry, but abandoned the alternative engine configuration due to the 1973 oil crisis.[61]\n\n\nIn partnership with Boeing, GM's Delco Defense Electronics Division designed the Lunar Roving Vehicle, which traversed the surface of the Moon, in 1971.[62][63] The following year, GM produced the first rear wheel anti-lock braking system for two models: the Toronado and Eldorado.[64]\n\n\nIn 1973, the Oldsmobile Toronado was the first retail car sold with a passenger airbag.[65][66]\n\n\nThomas Murphy became CEO of the company, succeeding Richard C. Gerstenberg in November 1974.[67][68]\n\n\nGM installed its first catalytic converters in its 1975 models.[69]\n\n\nFrom 1978 to 1985, GM pushed the benefits of diesel engines and cylinder deactivation technologies. However, it had disastrous results due to poor durability in the Oldsmobile diesels and drivability issues in the Cadillac V8-6-4 variable-cylinder engines.[70]\n\n\nGM sold Frigidaire in 1979. Although Frigidaire had between $450 million and $500 million in annual revenues, it was losing money.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)General Motors headquarters building, 1981\nRobert Lee of GM invented the Fe14Nd2B the Neodymium magnet, which was fabricated by rapid solidification, in 1984.[72] This magnet is commonly used in products like a computer hard disk. The same year, GM acquired Electronic Data Systems for $2.5 billion from Ross Perot as part of a strategy by CEO Roger Smith to derive at least 10% of its annual worldwide revenue from non-automotive sources.[73] GM also intended to have EDS handle its bookkeeping, help computerize factories, and integrate GM's computer systems. The transaction made Ross Perot the largest shareholder of GM; however, disagreements with Roger Smith led the company to buy all shares held by Ross Perot for $750 million in 1986.[74]\n\n\nIn a continuation of its diversification plans, GMAC formed GMAC Mortgage and acquired Colonial Mortgage as well as the servicing arm of Norwest Mortgage in 1985. This acquisition included an $11 billion mortgage portfolio.[75] The same year, GM acquired the Hughes Aircraft Company for $5 billion in cash and stock and merged it into Delco Electronics.[76] The following year, GM acquired 59.7% of Lotus Cars, a British producer of high-performance sports cars.[77]\n\n\nIn 1987, in conjunction with AeroVironment, GM built the Sunraycer, which won the inaugural World Solar Challenge and was a showcase of advanced technology. Much of the technology from Sunraycer found its way into the Impact prototype electric vehicle (also built by Aerovironment) and was the predecessor to the General Motors EV1.[78]\n\n\nIn 1988, GM acquired a 15% stake in AeroVironment.[79]\n\n\nIn 1989, GM acquired half of Saab Automobile's car operations for $600 million.[80]\n\n\n\n### Sales of assets[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1990, Robert Stempel became CEO of the company, succeeding Roger Smith.[81] GM cut output significantly and suffered losses that year due to the early 1990s recession.[82]\n\n\nIn 1990, GM debuted the General Motors EV1 (Impact) concept, a battery electric vehicle, at the LA Auto Show. It was the first car with zero emissions marketed in the US in over three decades. The Impact was produced as the EV1 for the 1996 model year and was available only via lease from certain dealers in California and Arizona. In 1999\u20132002, GM ceased production of the vehicles and started to not renew the leases, disappointing many people, allegedly because the program would not be profitable and would cannibalize its existing business. All of the EV1s were eventually returned to General Motors, and except for around 40 which were donated to museums with their electric powertrains deactivated, all were destroyed. The documentary film *Who Killed the Electric Car?* covered the EV1 story.[83]\n\n\nIn November 1992, John F. Smith Jr. became CEO of the company.[84]\n\n\nIn 1993, GM sold Lotus Cars to Bugatti.[85]\n\n\nIn 1996, in a return to its automotive basics, GM completed the corporate spin-off of Electronic Data Systems.[86][87]\n\n\nIn 1997, GM sold the military businesses of Hughes Aircraft Company to Raytheon Company for $9.5 billion in stock and the assumption of debt.[88][89][90][91]\n\n\nIn February 2000, Rick Wagoner was named CEO, succeeding John F. Smith Jr.[92][93] The next month, GM gave 5.1% of its common stock, worth $2.4 billion, to acquire a 20% share of Fiat.[94]\n\n\nIn December 2000, GM announced that it would begin phasing out Oldsmobile. The brand was eventually discontinued in 2004, seven years after it had become the first American car brand to turn 100.[95]\n\n\n\n* ![Chevrolet Tahoe hybrid vehicle](image)\n\nChevrolet Tahoe hybrid vehicle\n* ![Second generation Chevrolet Volt](image)\n\nSecond generation Chevrolet Volt\n* ![The Chevrolet Volt](image)\n\nThe Chevrolet Volt\n* ![The General Motors EV1, an electric car, was introduced in California in 1996.](image)\n\nThe General Motors EV1, an electric car, was introduced in California in 1996.\n\nIn May 2004, GM delivered the first full-sized pickup truck hybrid vehicles, the 1/2-ton Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra trucks.[96] These mild hybrids did not use electrical energy for propulsion, like GM's later designs. Later, the company debuted another hybrid technology, co-developed with DaimlerChrysler and BMW, in diesel-electric hybrid powertrain manufactured by Allison Transmission for transit buses.[97] Continuing to target the diesel-hybrid market, the Opel Astra diesel engine hybrid concept vehicle was rolled out in January 2005.[98] Later that year, GM sold its Electro-Motive Diesel locomotive division to private equity firms Berkshire Partners and Greenbriar Equity Group.[99][100]\n\n\nGM paid $2 billion to sever its ties with Fiat in 2005, severing ties with the company due to an increasingly contentious dispute.[101]\n\n\nGM began adding its \"Mark of Excellence\" emblem on all new vehicles produced and sold in North America in mid-2005. However, after the reorganization in 2009, the company no longer added the logo, saying that emphasis on its four core divisions would downplay the GM logo.[102][103]\n\n\nIn 2005, Edward T. Welburn was promoted to the newly created position of vice president, GM Global Design, making him the first African American to lead a global automotive design organization and the highest-ranking African American in the US motor industry at that time. On July 1, 2016, he retired from General Motors after 44 years. He was replaced by Michael Simcoe.[104][105]\n\n\nIn 2006, GM introduced a bright yellow fuel cap on its vehicles to remind drivers that cars can operate using E85 ethanol fuel.[106] They also introduced another hybrid vehicle that year, the Saturn Vue Green Line.[107]\n\n\nIn 2008, General Motors committed to engineering half of its manufacturing plants to be landfill-free by recycling or reusing waste in the manufacturing process.[108] Continuing their environmental-conscious development, GM started to offer the 2-mode hybrid system in the Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon, Cadillac Escalade, and pickup trucks.[109]\n\n\nIn late 2008, the world's largest rooftop solar power installation was installed at GM's manufacturing plant in Zaragoza. The Zaragoza solar installation has about 2,000,000 square feet (190,000\u00a0m2) of roof at the plant and contains about 85,000 solar panels. The installation was created, owned and operated by Veolia Environment and Clairvoyant Energy, which leases the rooftop area from GM.[110][111][112]\n\n\n\n### Chapter 11 bankruptcy and bailout[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization\n\nIn March 2009, after the company had received $17.4 billion in bailouts but was not effective in a turnaround, President Barack Obama forced the resignation of CEO Rick Wagoner.[113]\n\n\nGeneral Motors filed for a government-backed Chapter 11 reorganization on June 8, 2009.[114][115] On July 10, 2009, the original General Motors sold assets and some subsidiaries to an entirely new company, including the trademark \"General Motors\".[114][115] Liabilities were left with the original GM, renamed Motors Liquidation Company, freeing the companies of many liabilities and resulting in a new GM.[114][115]\n\n\nThrough the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the United States Department of the Treasury invested $49.5 billion in General Motors and recovered $39 billion when it sold its shares on December 9, 2013, resulting in a loss of $10.3 billion. The Treasury invested an additional $17.2 billion into GM's former financing company, GMAC (now Ally Financial). The shares in Ally were sold on December 18, 2014, for $19.6 billion netting the government $2.4 billion in profit, including dividends.[116][117] A study by the Center for Automotive Research found that the GM bailout saved 1.2 million jobs and preserved $34.9 billion in tax revenue.[118]\n\n\nGeneral Motors Canada was not part of the General Motors Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[119]\n\n\n\n### Post-reorganization[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2009, at the request of Steven Rattner, lead adviser to President Barack Obama on the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry, Edward Whitacre Jr., who had led a restructuring of AT&T, was appointed as chairman of General Motors.[120] Whitacre was tasked with overseeing GM's emergence from bankruptcy and downsizing its sizable number of brand marques, many of which had produced chronic losses even before the recession began. In July 2009, after 40 days of bankruptcy protection, the company emerged from the government-backed General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization.[121]\n\n\nAs mandated by its bailout agreement, GM began the process of shedding its poorest-performing brands in June 2009: Hummer, Saab, Saturn, and Pontiac. An October 2009 agreement to sell the Hummer brand to China-based Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company Ltd.[122] and a group of private investors fell through three months later, resulting in GM seeking a new suitor.[123] American company Raser Technologies, along with several others, expressed interest in buying the company, but none of the proposed acquisitions came to fruition, and in April 2010 GM said it was officially shutting down the Hummer brand.[124][125] Similarly, GM's efforts to sell its Saturn division yielded an early suitor. In June 2009, GM announced that the Saturn brand would be sold to the Penske Automotive Group.[126] The deal fell through, however, and GM declared the brand defunct in October 2010. While GM agreed to shed its underperforming Pontiac brand as part of its bailout agreement, the company explicitly opted not to sell it to another company.[127][128] The last Pontiac was built in January 2010.[129]\n\n\nGM was more successful in its attempts to sell Saab Automobile: the company closed a sale to Dutch automaker Spyker Cars in February 2010.[130] Saab continued to perform poorly under Spyker's management, however, and in 2012 the Saab division declared bankruptcy.\n\n\nIn December 2009, the \"new\" GM's board of directors asked CEO Fritz Henderson to resign, and its chairman, Ed Whitacre, was named interim CEO.[131] GM opted to appoint Whitacre as its permanent CEO the following month, though Whitacre ultimately stepped down as CEO in September 2010, relinquishing the position to fellow GM board member Daniel Akerson but agreeing to continue on as GM chairman until the end of the year. Akerson replaced him as chairman, while continuing as CEO, in January 2011.[132][133]\n\n\nIn 2010, GM introduced the Chevrolet Volt as an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV), an electric vehicle with backup generators powered by gasoline, or series plug-in hybrid.[134][135] GM delivered the first Volt in December 2010.[136] The Chevrolet Volt was a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle with back-up generators powered by gasoline (range-extended electric vehicle).[137] GM built a prototype two-seat electric vehicle with Segway Inc. An early prototype of the Personal Urban Mobility and Accessibility vehicle\u2014dubbed Project P.U.M.A. \u2013 was presented in New York at the 2009 New York International Auto Show.[138]\n\n\n\n* ![2nd generation Buick LaCrosse (2010\u20132016)[139][140]](image)\n\n2nd generation Buick LaCrosse (2010\u20132016)[139][140]\n* ![General Motors Sequel, a fuel cell-powered vehicle from GM.](image)\n\nGeneral Motors Sequel, a fuel cell-powered vehicle from GM.\n* ![E85 FlexFuel Chevrolet Impala LT 2009 (USA)](image)\n\nE85 FlexFuel Chevrolet Impala LT 2009 (USA)\n* ![The Chevrolet Bolt EV was released in late 2016.](image)\n\nThe Chevrolet Bolt EV was released in late 2016.\n\nOn January 15, 2014, Mary Barra was named chief executive officer, succeeding Daniel Akerson. Barra also joined the GM board.[141] Only three weeks later, the company announced its 2014 General Motors recall, which was due to faulty ignition switches, and was linked to at least 124 deaths. The resulting settlements with family members of those killed were estimated to cost the company $1.5 billion.[142]\n\n\nOn January 4, 2016, in its first investment in a ridesharing company, GM invested $500 million in Lyft.[143][144] The company does not directly supply Lyft drivers with vehicles, however \u2013 and has no plans to do so in the future \u2013 and Lyft ultimately partnered with Motional for production of its autonomous vehicles.\n\n\nIn March 2016, GM acquired Cruise, a San Francisco self-driving vehicle start-up, to develop self-driving cars that could be used in ride-sharing fleets.[145][146] In June 2022, Cruise received California's first Driverless Deployment Permit, allowing it to both charge fees for its service as well as offer fully autonomous rides in a major public city.[147] *The Verge* reported that the company lost $561 million in Q1 2023, but said it remains on the path to reach $1 billion in revenue by 2025 and $50 billion by 2030.[148]\n\n\nIn October 2016, GM began production of the Chevrolet Bolt EV, the first-ever mass market all-electric car with a range of more than 200 miles (320\u00a0km).[149][150] The battery pack and most drivetrain components were built by LG Corporation and assembled in GM's plant in Lake Orion, Michigan.[151] GM chose to employ the Bolt EV and similar Bolt EUV for its Cruise ride-share service.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn January 8, 2021, GM introduced a new logo alongside the tagline \"EVerybody in\", with the capitalized \"EV\" as a nod to the company's commitment to electric vehicles.[152][153] GM's new logo used negative space to create the idea of an electric plug in the \"M\" of the logo.[154]\n\n\nAt the January 2021 Consumer Electronics Show, GM launched BrightDrop, its brand for all-electric commercial vehicles.[155]\n\n\nOn January 28, 2021, GM announced that it will end production and sales of fossil-fuel vehicles (including hybrids and plug-in hybrids) by 2035 as part of its plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2040.[156]\n\n\nIn 2021, GM announced plans to establish an automotive battery and battery pack laboratory in Michigan.[157][158][159] GM will be responsible for battery management systems and power electronics, thermal management, as well as the pack assembly. An existing GM facility at Brownstown Township was chosen to be upgraded as a battery pack plant.[134] LG Chem's U.S. subsidiary, Compact Power of Troy, Michigan, has been building the prototype packs for the development vehicles and will continue to provide integration support and acting as a liaison for the program.[160]\n\n\n\n### Motorsports history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chevrolet Corvette C8.R in the IMSA SportsCar Championship\nGM participated in the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) from 2004 to 2012,[161] and has also participated in other motorsport championships, including 24 Hours of Le Mans,[162] NASCAR,[163] SCCA[164] and Supercars Championship.[165]\n\n\nGM's engines were successful in the Indy Racing League (IRL) throughout the 1990s, winning many races in the small V8 class. GM has also done much work in the development of electronics for GM auto racing. An unmodified Aurora V8 in the Aerotech captured 47 world records, including the record for speed endurance in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America. Recently, the Cadillac V-Series has entered motorsports racing.\n\n\nGM has also designed cars specifically for use in NASCAR auto racing. The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 is the only entry in the series.[166] In the past, the Pontiac Grand Prix,[167] Buick Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass, Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Malibu, Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Chevrolet Impala, and the Chevrolet SS were also used. GM has won many NASCAR Cup Series manufacturer's championships, including 40 with Chevrolet,[168] the most of any make in NASCAR history, 3 with Oldsmobile, 2 with Buick, and 1 with Pontiac. In 2021, Chevrolet became the first brand to reach 800 wins.[169]\n\n\nIn Australia, Holden cars based on the Monaro, Torana and Commodore platforms raced in the Australian Touring Car Championship until 2022. Holden won the Bathurst 1000, a record 36 times between 1968 and 2022 and the Australian Touring Car Championship 23 times.[170] From 2023, the Chevrolet Camaro will be raced.[171]\n\n\n\n### Logo evolution[edit]\n\n\nEvolution of the GM logo through the years:[172]\n\n\n\n* ![1938\u20131964[172]](image)\n\n1938\u20131964[172]\n* ![Mark of Excellence (1964\u20132021)[172]](image)\n\nMark of Excellence (1964\u20132021)[172]\n* ![2001\u20132021[172]](image)\n\n2001\u20132021[172]\n* ![2010\u20132021[172]](image)\n\n2010\u20132021[172]\n* ![2021 (gradient)[172]](image)\n\n2021 (gradient)[172]\n* ![2021 (flat)[173]](image)\n\n2021 (flat)[173]\n* ![2022 (wordmark)[174]](image)\n\n2022 (wordmark)[174]\n\n\n## Brands[edit]\n\n\n### Current[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Brand[175] | Founded\n | Began manufacturing vehicles\n | Joined GM\n | Markets served today\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Buick | 1899 | 1903 | 1908 | China, North America\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Cadillac | 1902 | 1902 | 1909 | North America, Middle East, China, Japan, South Korea, Europe, Kazakhstan\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Chevrolet | 1911 | 1911 | 1918 | Americas, China, Middle East, CIS, South Korea, Philippines, Japan, Europe, Australasia.\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | GMC | 1912 | 1912 | 1919 | North America, Middle East, South Korea\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CHN | Baojun | 2010 | 2010 | 2010 | China\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CHN | Wuling | 2002 | 2002 | 2002 | China, Indonesia\n |\n\n\n### Former[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Brand[175] | Founded\n | Began manufacturing vehicles\n | Joined GM\n | Fate\n | Defunct / Sold\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Acadian | 1962 | 1962 | 1962 | Discontinued | 1971 | Canadian Chevy with Pontiac design accents\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0KOR | Alpheon | 2010 | 2010 | 2010 | Discontinued | 2015 | The only available model was based on the Buick LaCrosse\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | As\u00fcna | 1992 | 1992 | 1992 | Discontinued | 1994 | Composed of Suzuki, Isuzu and Toyota models.\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Beaumont | 1966 | 1966 | 1966 | Discontinued | 1969 | Canadian Chevy with Pontiac design accents\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0UK | Bedford | 1931 | 1931 | 1931 | Discontinued | 1991 |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Cartercar | 1905 | 1905 | 1909 | Discontinued | 1915 |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0KOR | Daewoo | 1972 | 1972 | 1999 | Discontinued | 2011 | Succeeded by GM Korea |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Elmore | 1893 | 1900 | 1912 | Discontinued | 1916 |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Envoy | 1959 | 1959 | 1959 | Discontinued | 1970 | Imported Vauxhall and Bedford vehicles sold at Canadian Chevrolet and Oldsmobile dealerships\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Epic | 1964 | 1964 | 1964 | Discontinued | 1970 | Imported Vauxhall models sold at Canadian Pontiac, Buick and GMC dealerships\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Garland |  |  | 1909 | Discontinued | 1909 |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Geo | 1989 | 1989 | 1989 | Discontinued | 1997 | Composed of Suzuki, Isuzu and Toyota models.

This reign was longer than any other automaker, and GM is still among the world's largest automakers by vehicle unit sales.[176]\n\n\nIn 2008, the third-largest individual country by sales was Brazil, with some 550,000 GM vehicles sold. In that year, Argentina, Colombia, and Venezuela sold another 300,000 GM vehicles, suggesting that the total GM sales in South America (including sales in other South American countries such as Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, etc.) in that year were at a similar level to sales in China.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2009, General Motors sold 6.5\u00a0million cars and trucks globally; in 2010, it sold 8.39 million.[177] Sales in China rose 66.9% in 2009 to 1,830,000 vehicles and accounting for 13.4% of the market.[178]\n\n\nIn 2010, General Motors ranked second worldwide with 8.5 million vehicles produced.[179] In 2011, GM returned to the first place with 9.025 million units sold worldwide, corresponding to 11.9% market share of the global motor vehicle industry. In 2010, vehicle sales in China by GM rose 28.8% to a record 2,351,610 units.[180] The top two markets in 2011 were China, with 2,547,203 units, and the United States, with 2,503,820 vehicles sold. The Chevrolet brand was the main contributor to GM performance, with 4.76 million vehicles sold around the world in 2011, a global sales record.[181]\n\n\nBased on global sales in 2012, General Motors was ranked among the world's largest automakers.[182]\n\n\nIn May 2012, GM recorded an 18.4% market share in the U.S. with stock imported.[183]\n\n\nAnnual worldwide sales volume reached 10 million vehicles in 2016.[184][185][186] Sales in India for April 2016 \u2013 March 2017 declined to 25,823 units from 32,540 the previous year and market share contracted from 1.17% to 0.85% for the same period. However, exports surged 89% during the same period to 70,969 units. GMTC-I, GM's technical center in Bangalore, India continued in operation. Weak product line-up and below par service quality were the reasons for the poor showing by GM in India that year.[187][188]\n\n\nGlobal Volt/Ampera family sales totalled about 177,000 units from its inception in December 2010 through 2018.[189] including over 10,000 Opel/Vauxhall Amperas sold in Europe up to December 2015.[190][191] The Volt family of vehicles ranked as the world's all-time top-selling plug-in hybrid as of September\u00a02018[update], and it is also the third best selling plug-in electric car in history after the Nissan Leaf (375,000) and the Tesla Model S (253,000), as of October\u00a02018[update].[189] The Chevrolet Volt is also the U.S. all-time top-selling plug-in electric car with 148,556 units delivered through October 2018.[192][193]\n\n\n\n\n\nGM worldwide 2008 vehicle sales[194]  \n(thousands)\n| Rankin GM\n | Location\n | Vehiclesales\n | Marketshare (%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 2,981 | 22.1%\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0China | 1,095 | 12.0%\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 549 | 19.5%\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | 384 | 15.4%\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 359 | 21.4%\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 338 | 11.1%\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | 300 | 8.8%\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image)\u00a0Mexico | 212 | 19.8%\n |\n| 9\n | ![](image)\u00a0Australia | 133 | 13.1%\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | 117 | 9.7%\n |\n| 11\n | ![](image)\u00a0France | 114 | 4.4%\n |\n| 12\n | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | 107 | 7.8%\n |\n| 13\n | ![](image)\u00a0Argentina | 95 | 15.5%\n |\n| 14\n | ![](image)\u00a0Venezuela | 91 | 33.3%\n |\n| 15\n | ![](image)\u00a0Colombia | 80 | 36.3%\n |\n| 16\n | ![](image)\u00a0India | 66 | 3.3%\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | U.S. sales(vehicles)\n | Chg/yr.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998[195] | 4,603,991\n |  |\n| 1999\n | 5,017,150\n | ![Increase](image)9.0%\n |\n| 2000[196] | 4,953,163\n | ![Decrease](image)1.3%\n |\n| 2001\n | 4,904,015\n | ![Decrease](image)1.0%\n |\n| 2002\n | 4,858,705\n | ![Decrease](image)0.9%\n |\n| 2003\n | 4,756,403\n | ![Decrease](image)2.1%\n |\n| 2004[197] | 4,707,416\n | ![Decrease](image)1.0%\n |\n| 2005\n | 4,517,730\n | ![Decrease](image)4.0%\n |\n| 2006[198] | 4,124,645\n | ![Decrease](image)8.7%\n |\n| 2007[199] | 3,866,620\n | ![Decrease](image)6.3%\n |\n| 2008[200] | 2,980,688\n | ![Decrease](image)22.9%\n |\n| 2009[201] | 2,084,492\n | ![Decrease](image)30.1%\n |\n| 2010[202] | 2,215,227\n | ![Increase](image)6.3%\n |\n| 2011[203] | 2,503,820\n | ![Increase](image)13.7%\n |\n| 2012\n | 2,595,717\n | ![Increase](image)3.7%\n |\n| 2013[204] | 2,786,078\n | ![Increase](image)7.3%\n |\n| 2014[205] | 2,935,008\n | ![Increase](image)5.3%\n |\n| 2015[206] | 3,082,366\n | ![Increase](image)5.0%\n |\n| 2016\n | 3,042,773\n | ![Decrease](image)1.3%\n |\n| 2017\n | 3,002,241\n | ![Decrease](image)1.3%\n |\n| 2018\n | 2,954,037\n | ![Decrease](image)1.5%\n |\n| 2019[207] | 2,887,046\n | ![Decrease](image)2.3%\n |\n| 2020[208] | 2,547,339\n | ![Decrease](image)11.8%\n |\n| 2021[209] | 2,218,228\n | ![Decrease](image)12.9%\n |\n| 2022[209] | 2,274,088\n | ![Increase](image)2.5%\n |\n\n\n\n\nGM worldwide 2019 vehicle sales[210]\n| Location\n | Total sales\n | Year-On-Yearchange\n | Year-On-Yearchange (%)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GM North America | 3,367,374 | (122,740) | (3.5)\n |\n| GM Europe | 3,590 | (266) | (6.9)\n |\n| GM South America | 668,842 | (21,355) | (3.1)\n |\n| GM International | 584,520 | 28,033 | 5.0\n |\n| China | 3,093,604 | (551,440) | (15.1)\n |\n| Total | 7,717,930 | (667,768) | (8.0)\n |\n\n\n## Management[edit]\n\n\n### Current board of directors[edit]\n\n\nNotable members of the board of directors of the company are as follows:[2]\n\n\n\n* Mary Barra, Chairman and CEO of General Motors\n* Joseph Ashton, former Vice President of the International Union at United Automobile Workers\n* Linda Gooden, former Vice President of Information Systems and Global Solutions at Lockheed Martin\n* Joseph Jimenez, CEO of Novartis\n* Jane Mendillo, former President and CEO at Harvard Management Company\n* Michael Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\n* James Mulva, former CEO, President, and Chairman at ConocoPhillips\n* Patricia Russo, CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n* Thomas Schoewe, former CFO of Wal-Mart Stores\n* Theodore Solso, former CEO and Chairman of Cummins\n* Carol Stephenson, former dean at Ivey Business School\n* Devin Wenig, former President and CEO of eBay\n* Jon McNeill, CEO of DVx Ventures LLC\n\n### Chairmen of the Board of General Motors[edit]\n\n\n* Thomas Neal\u2014November 19, 1912 \u2013 November 16, 1915\n* Pierre S. du Pont\u2014November 16, 1915 \u2013 February 7, 1929\n* Lammot du Pont II\u2014February 7, 1929 \u2013 May 3, 1937\n* Alfred P.

The program involved five designers, each lending their artistic talents to customize five different vehicles. Nicole Miller, Richard Tyler, Anna Sui, Todd Oldham, and Mark Eisen were tasked with transforming a Cadillac STS, Buick Riviera, GMC Yukon, Oldsmobile Bravada and Chevrolet Camaro Z28, respectively. The cars were then auctioned with the proceeds presented to the Nina Hyde Center at the Greater LA Auto Show in 1997.[215][216][217][218]\n\n\nSince 1997, GM has been a source of funding for Safe Kids Worldwide's \"Safe Kids Buckle Up\" program, an initiative to ensure child automobile safety through education and inspection.[219][220]\n\n\n\n## Labor conflicts[edit]\n\n\nGeneral Motors' American workers are unionized generally under the United Auto Workers (UAW), which is the primary auto workers union in the United States.\n\n\n\n### Flint sit-down strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Flint sit-down strike\n\n![](image)Young striker off sentry duty sleeping on the assembly line of auto seats\nThe 1936\u20131937 Flint sit-down strike against General Motors changed the UAW from a collection of isolated local unions on the fringes of the industry into a major labor union and led to the unionization of the domestic United States automobile industry.\n\n\nAfter the first convention of UAW in 1936, the union decided that it could not survive by piecemeal organizing campaigns at smaller plants, as it had in the past, but that it could organize the automobile industry only by going after its biggest and most powerful employer, General Motors, focusing on GM's production complex in Flint, Michigan.\n\n\nOrganizing in Flint was a difficult and dangerous plan. GM controlled city politics in Flint and kept a close eye on outsiders. According to Wyndham Mortimer, the UAW officer put in charge of the organizing campaign in Flint, he received a death threat by an anonymous caller when he visited Flint in 1936. GM also maintained an extensive network of spies throughout its plants. This forced UAW members to keep the names of new members secret and meeting workers at their homes.\n\n\nAs the UAW studied its target, it discovered that GM had only two factories that produced the dies from which car body components were stamped: one in Flint that produced the parts for Buicks, Pontiacs, and Oldsmobiles, and another in Cleveland that produced Chevrolet parts.\n\n\n\n![](image)National Guardsmen with machine guns overlooking Chevrolet factories number nine and number four\nWhile the UAW called for a sit-down strike in Flint, the police, armed with guns and tear gas, attempted to enter the Fisher Body 2 plant on January 11, 1937. The strikers inside the plant pelted them with hinges, bottles, and bolts. At the time, Vice President John Nance Garner supported federal intervention to break up the Flint Strike, but this idea was rejected by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The president urged GM to distinguish a union so the plants could re-open. The strike ended after 44 days.\n\n\nThat development forced GM to bargain with the union. John L. Lewis, President of the United Mine Workers and founder and leader of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, spoke for the UAW in those negotiations; UAW President Homer Martin was sent on a speaking tour to keep him out of the way. GM's representatives refused to be in the same room as the UAW, so Governor Frank Murphy acted as a courier and intermediary between the two groups. Governor Murphy sent in the U.S. National Guard not to evict the strikers but rather to protect them from the police and corporate strike-breakers. The two parties finally reached an agreement on February 11, 1937, on a one-page agreement that recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for GM's employees, who were union members for the next six months.[221]\n\n\n\n### Tool and die strike of 1939[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tool and die strike of 1939\n\nThe tool and die strike of 1939, also known as the \"strategy strike\", was an ultimately successful attempt by the UAW to be recognized as the sole representative for General Motors workers. In addition to representation rights, the UAW, working jointly with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), sought to resolve existing grievances of skilled workers.\n\n\n\n### United Auto Workers (UAW) strike of 1945\u20131946[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1945-46 United Auto Workers strike\n\nFrom November 21, 1945, until March 13, 1946, (113 days) the UAW organized \"320,000 hourly workers\" to form a US-wide strike against the General Motors Corporation, workers used the tactic of the sit down strike.[222] It was \"the longest strike against a major manufacturer\" that the UAW had yet seen, and it was also \"the longest national GM strike in its history\".[222] As director of the UAW's General Motors Department (coordinator of union relations with GM),[223] Walter Reuther suggested to his colleagues the idea of striking the GM manufacturing plants with a 'one-at-a-time' strategy, which was \"intended to maximize pressure on the target company\".[222] Reuther also put forth the demands of the strikers: a 30 percent increase in wages and a hold on product prices. However, the strike ended with the dissatisfaction of Walter Reuther and the UAW, and the workers received only a 17.5-percent increase in wages.\n\n\n\n### 2007 General Motors strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2007 General Motors strike\n\nThe 2007 General Motors strike was a strike from September 24 to 26, 2007, by the UAW against General Motors.\n\n\nOn September 24, 2007, General Motors workers represented by the UAW union went on strike against the company. The first US-wide strike against GM since 1970 was expected to idle 59 plants and facilities for an indefinite period of time. Talks broke down after more than 20 straight days of bargaining failed to produce a new contract. Major issues that proved to be stumbling blocks for an agreement included wages, benefits, job security and investments in US facilities.[224][225][226]\n\n\nTwo car assembly plants in Oshawa, Ontario and a transmission facility in Windsor closed on September 25. However, on September 26, a tentative agreement was reached, and the strike's end was announced by UAW officials in a news conference at 4 a.m.[227] By the following day, all GM workers in both countries were back to work.\n\n\n\n### 2019 General Motors strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 General Motors strike\n\nOn the morning of September 15, 2019, after talks broke down to renew their contract, which expired earlier that day, the UAW announced that GM employees would begin striking at 11:59 pm.[228] This strike shut down operations in nine states, including 33 manufacturing plants and 22 parts distribution warehouses.[229] After 40 days, on October 25, 2019, the \"longest strike by autoworkers in a decade\" and the longest against GM since 1970 came to an end when United Auto Workers members voted to approve a new contract with GM. Striking labor union members received a $275 a week strike pay salary for the duration of the strike.[230] The strike cost GM more than $2 billion.\n\n\n\n### 2023 United Auto Workers strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 United Auto Workers strike\n\nThe ongoing strike launched by the UAW is the first strike against all three major American automakers in history. Then-recently elected UAW president Shawn Fain stated that he was \"fed up\" with the current situation between workers and automakers; Fain specifically blasted the tiered workers system at automakers, failure for automakers to keep wages up with inflation, pensions, as well as the introduction of a four-day workweek as opposed to the five-day workweek. GM CEO Mary Barra protested that her company offered an \"unprecedented deal\" which gave workers 20% raises as well as \"world-class\" healthcare. Barra further stated that meeting all 1,000 plus demands would bankrupt the company and cost over $100 billion.[231][232]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Streetcar conspiracy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: General Motors streetcar conspiracy\n\nBetween 1938 and 1950, GM allegedly deliberately monopolized the sale of buses and supplies to National City Lines (NCL) and its subsidiaries, in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, intending to dismantle streetcar systems in many cities in the United States and make buses, sold by GM, the dominant form of public transport.\n\n\n\n### Ralph Nader and the Corvair[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1961\u201363 Corvair swing-axle rear suspension\n*Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-In Dangers of the American Automobile* by Ralph Nader, published in 1965, is a book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety. It relates to the first models of the Chevrolet Corvair (1960\u20131964) that had a swing axle suspension design that was prone to 'tuck under' in certain circumstances. To compensate for the removal of a front stabilizer bar (anti-roll bar) as a cost-cutting measure, Corvairs required tire pressures that were outside of the tire manufacturer's recommended tolerances. The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential (15 psi front, 26 psi rear, when cold; 18 psi and 30 psi hot), and if one inflated the tires equally, as was standard practice for all other cars at the time, the result was dangerous over-steer.[233]\n\n\nIn early March 1966, several media outlets, including *The New Republic* and *The New York Times*, alleged that GM had tried to discredit Ralph Nader, hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past, and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations.[234][235] Nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for $425,000. Nader's lawsuit against GM was ultimately decided by the New York Court of Appeals, whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover \"overzealous surveillance\".[236] Nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the pro-consumer Center for Study of Responsive Law.\n\n\nA 1972 safety commission report conducted by Texas A&M University concluded that the 1960\u20131963 Corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations.[237] The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a press release in 1972 describing the findings of NHTSA testing from the previous year. NHTSA conducted a series of comparative tests in 1971 studying the handling of the 1963 Corvair and four contemporary cars \u2014 a Ford Falcon, Plymouth Valiant, Volkswagen Beetle, and Renault Dauphine \u2014 along with a second-generation Corvair (with its completely redesigned, independent rear suspension). The 143-page report reviewed NHTSA's extreme-condition handling tests, national crash-involvement data for the cars in the test as well as General Motors' internal documentation regarding the Corvair's handling.[238] NHTSA went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests. This review panel concluded that 'the 1960\u201363 Corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests ... the handling and stability performance of the 1960\u201363 Corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover, and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic'.\n\n\nFormer GM executive John DeLorean asserted, in his book *On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors*, that Nader's criticisms were valid.[239]\n\n\nJournalist David E. Davis noted that despite Nader's claim that swing-axle rear suspension were dangerous, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen all used similar swing-axle concepts during that era.[240]\n\n\n\n### Apartheid[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, GM (along with other multinational corporations) was sued by a group of South Africans represented by the Khulumani Support Group.[241] The plaintiffs alleged that the company provided vehicles to the South African security forces during the Apartheid. The company settled with the plaintiffs in 2012, agreeing to pay a sum of up to $1.5 million.[242]\n\n\n\n### Ignition switch recall[edit]\n\n\nMain article: General Motors ignition switch recalls\n\nIn May 2014, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration fined the company $35 million for failing to recall cars with faulty ignition switches for a decade, despite knowing there was a problem with the switches. General Motors paid compensation for 124 deaths linked to the faulty switches.[243] The $35 million fine was the maximum the regulator could impose.[244] The total cost of the recall was estimated to be $1.5 billion.[142] As well as the Cobalts, the switches of concern had been installed in many other cars, such as the Pontiac G5, the Saturn Ion, the Chevrolet HHR, the Saturn Sky, and Pontiac Solstice. The recall involved about 2.6 million GM cars worldwide.[245]\n\n\n\n### Xinjiang region[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute accused at least 82 major brands, including General Motors, of being connected to forced Uyghur labor in Xinjiang.[246]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![flag](image)Michigan portal\n* ![](image)Cars portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers\n* ASOTRECOL\n* Crucible Industries\n* EcoCAR\n* General Motors Hy-wire\n* General Motors proving grounds\n* General Motors Technical Center\n* GM people\n* GM vehicles by brand\n* List of automobile manufacturers of the United States\n* List of GM engines\n* List of General Motors factories\n* List of General Motors platforms\n* List of GM transmissions\n* United States Council for Automotive Research\n* VIA Motors\n* Freon\n* Global Climate Coalition\n* Ethyl Corporation\n* Durant Motors\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Department of State, Division of Corporations (General Information Name Search)\".

Founded in 1937 by the German Labour Front under the Nazi Party and revived into a global brand after World War II by the British Army officer Ivan Hirst, it is known for the iconic Beetle and serves as the flagship brand of the Volkswagen Group, the largest automotive manufacturer by worldwide sales in 2016 and 2017.[1] The group's biggest market is in China, which delivers 40 percent of its sales and profits.[2][3] Its name is derived from the German-language terms *Volk* and *Wagen*, translating to \"people's car\" when combined.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1932\u20131940: People's Car project[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Model of Porsche Type 12 (Z\u00fcndapp), Museum of Industrial Culture, Nuremberg\nVolkswagen was established in 1937 by the German Labour Front (German: *Deutsche Arbeitsfront*) as part of the Strength Through Joy (German: *Kraft durch Freude*) program in Berlin.[4] In the early 1930s, cars were a luxury \u2013 most Germans could afford nothing more elaborate than a motorcycle, and only one German out of 50 owned a car. Seeking a potential new market, some car makers began independent \"people's car\" projects\u00a0\u2013 the Mercedes 170H, BMW 3/15, Adler AutoBahn, Steyr 55 and Hanomag 1.3L, among others.\n\n\nThe growing trend was not nascent; B\u00e9la Bar\u00e9nyi, a pioneering automotive engineer, is credited as already having conceived the basic design during the mid-1920s. Josef Ganz developed the Standard Superior (going as far as advertising it as the \"German Volkswagen\"). In Germany, the company Hanomag mass-produced the 2/10 PS \"Kommissbrot\", a small, cheap rear-engined car, from 1925 to 1928.[5] Also, in Czechoslovakia, the Hans Ledwinka designed Tatra T77, a very popular car amongst the German elite, was becoming smaller and more affordable at each revision. Ferdinand Porsche, a well-known designer for high-end vehicles and race cars, had been trying for years to get a manufacturer interested in a small car suitable for a family. He built a car named the \"Volksauto\" from the ground up in 1933, using many popular ideas and several of his own, putting together a car with an air-cooled rear engine, torsion bar suspension, and a \"beetle\" shape, the front bonnet rounded for better aerodynamics (necessary as it had a small engine).[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)VW logo during the 1930s, initials surrounded by a stylised cogwheel and a spinning propeller that looked like a swastika[7]\nIn 1934, with many of the above projects still in development or early stages of production, Adolf Hitler became involved, ordering the production of a basic vehicle capable of transporting two adults and three children at 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph). He wanted a car every German family would be able to afford.[6] The \"People's Car\" would be available through a savings plan at 990\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01 (US$396 in 1938)\u2014about the price of a small motorcycle (the average income being around 32\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01 a week).[8][9]\n\n\nIt soon became apparent that private industry could not turn out a car for only 990\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01. Thus, Hitler chose to sponsor an all-new, state-owned factory using Ferdinand Porsche's design (with some of Hitler's design suggestions, including an air-cooled engine so nothing could freeze). The intention was that German families could buy the car through a savings scheme (*\"*F\u00fcnf Mark die Woche musst du sparen, willst du im eigenen Wagen fahren*\"\u00a0\u2013 \"Five Marks a week you must set aside, if in your own car you wish to ride*\"), which around 336,000 people eventually paid into.[10] However, the project was not commercially viable, and only government support was able to keep it afloat.[11][Note 2] Due to the outbreak of war in 1939, none of the participants in the savings scheme ever received a car. In 1950, a lawsuit was issued that, after 12 years of trial, ultimately provided a credit of 12% off the list price of a new VW base model or 5-times less the value paid into the saving scheme.[12]\n\n\nPrototypes of the car called the *KdF-Wagen* (from the German term *Kraft durch Freude*, meaning \"Strength Through Joy\") appeared from 1938 onwards (the first cars had been produced in Stuttgart). The car already had its distinctive round shape and air-cooled, flat-four, rear-mounted engine. The VW car was just one of many *KdF* programs, which included things such as tours and outings. The prefix *Volks* (\"People's\") was not just applied to cars, but also to other products in Germany \u2013 the *Volksempf\u00e4nger* radio receiver for instance. On 28 May 1937, *Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung des Deutschen Volkswagens mbH* (\"Company for the Preparation of the German Volkswagen Ltd.\"), or *Gezuvor*[13] for short, was established by the *Deutsche Arbeitsfront* in Berlin. More than a year later, on 16 September 1938, it was renamed to *Volkswagenwerk GmbH*.[14][15]\n\n\n\n![](image)VW Type 82E\nErwin Komenda, the longstanding Auto Union chief designer, part of Ferdinand Porsche's hand-picked team,[6] developed the car body of the prototype, which was recognisably the Beetle known today. It was one of the first cars designed with the aid of a wind tunnel\u2014a method used for German aircraft design since the early 1920s. The car designs were put through rigorous tests and achieved a record-breaking million miles of testing before being deemed finished.\n\n\nThe construction of the new factory started in May 1938 in the new town of \"Stadt des KdF-Wagens\" (renamed Wolfsburg after the war), which had been purpose-built for the factory workers.[14] This factory had only produced a handful of cars by the time war started in 1939. None were actually delivered to any holder of the completed saving stamp books, though one Type 1 Cabriolet was presented to Hitler on 20 April 1944 (his 55th birthday).[14]\n\n\n\n### 1939\u20131944: Wartime production and Nazi concentration camp labour[edit]\n\n\nWar changed production to military vehicles\u2014the Type 82 *K\u00fcbelwagen* (\"Bucket car\") utility vehicle (VW's most common wartime model), and the amphibious *Schwimmwagen*\u2014manufactured for German forces. One of the first foreigners to drive a Volkswagen was the American war correspondent Ernie Pyle, who had the use of a captured Volkswagen for a few days after the Allied victory in Tunisia in May 1943.[16] As was common with much of the production in Nazi Germany during the war, slave labour was utilised in the Volkswagen plant, e.g. from Arbeitsdorf concentration camp. The company would admit in 1998 that it used 15,000 slaves during the war effort. German historians estimated that 80% of Volkswagen's wartime workforce was slave labour.[17] Many of the slaves were reported to have been supplied from the concentration camps upon request from plant managers. A lawsuit was filed in 1998 by survivors for restitution for the forced labour.[18] Volkswagen would set up a voluntary restitution fund.[19]\n\n\n\n### 1945\u20131948: British military intervention[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen industrial plant in Wolfsburg, pictured in 2006\nIn April 1945, KdF-Stadt and its heavily bombed factory were captured by the United States armed forces and subsequently handed over to the British, within whose occupation zone the town and factory fell. The factory was placed under the control of British Army officer Major Ivan Hirst, REME, a civilian Military Governor with the occupying forces. At first, one plan was to use it for military vehicle maintenance, and possibly dismantle and ship it to Britain. Since it had been used for military production, (though not of KdF-Wagens) and had been in Hirst's words, a \"political animal\" rather than a commercial enterprise \u2013 technically making it liable for destruction under the terms of the Potsdam Agreement \u2013 the equipment could have been salvaged as war reparations. Allied dismantling policy changed in late 1946 to mid-1947, though heavy industry continued to be dismantled until 1951.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOne of the factory's wartime 'KdF-Wagen' cars had been taken to the factory for repairs and abandoned there. Hirst had it repainted green and demonstrated it to British Army headquarters. Short of light transport, in September 1945 the British Army was persuaded to place a vital order for 20,000 cars. However, production facilities had been massively disrupted, there was a refugee crisis at and around the factory, and some parts (such as carburettors) were unavailable. Hirst and his German assistant Heinrich Nordhoff (who went on to run the Wolfsburg facility after the military government ended in 1949) helped to stabilise the acute social situation while simultaneously re-establishing production. Hirst, for example, used his engineering experience to arrange the manufacture of carburettors, the original producers being effectively 'lost' in the Soviet zone.[20] The first few hundred cars went to personnel from the occupying forces, and to Australia Post. Some British service personnel were allowed to take their Beetles back to the United Kingdom when they were demobilised.[21][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nIn 1986, Hirst said that factory workers were, after many years of Nazi conditioning, initially reluctant to follow his orders; to counter this, he had his military uniform brought back from Britain and wore it in the factory, after which he reported having no problems even though he was no longer a soldier at the time but a civilian member of the military government.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe post-war industrial plans for Germany set out rules that governed which industries Germany was allowed to retain. These rules set German car production at a maximum of 10% of 1936 car production.[22] By 1946, the factory produced 1,000 cars a month even though it was still in disrepair. Owing to roof and window damage, production had to stop when it rained, and the company had to barter new vehicles for steel for production.[23]\n\n\nThe car and its town changed their Second World War-era names to \"Volkswagen\" and \"Wolfsburg\" respectively, and production increased. It was still unclear what was to become of the factory. It was offered to representatives from the American, Australian, British, and French motor industries who all rejected it. After an inspection of the plant, Sir William Rootes, head of the British Rootes Group, told Hirst the project would fail within two years, and that the car \"...is quite unattractive to the average motorcar buyer, is too ugly and too noisy. If you think you're going to build cars in this place, you're a bloody fool, young man.\"[24] The official report said: \"To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise.\"[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cogeneration plant\nFord representatives were equally critical. In March 1948, the British offered the Volkswagen company to Ford, free of charge. Henry Ford II, the son of Edsel Ford, travelled to West Germany for discussions. Heinz Nordhoff was also present, as well as Ernest Breech, chairman of the board for Ford. Henry Ford II looked to Breech for his opinion, and Breech said, \"Mr. Ford, I don't think what we're being offered here is worth a damn!\"[26] Ford passed on the offer, leaving Volkswagen to rebuild itself under Nordhoff's leadership.[27]\n\n\n\n### 1948\u20131961: Icon of post-war West Germany[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1949 Volkswagen \"split rear window\" Sedan\n![](image)Volkswagen Cabriolet (1953)\n![](image)Volkswagen Type 2 (T1)\n![](image)An original 1300 Deluxe, circa 1966\n![](image)In the later 1960s, as the worldwide demand for the Beetle finally began to diminish, a variety of successor designs were proposed and, in most cases, rejected by management.\nFrom 1948, Volkswagen became an important element, symbolically and economically, of West German regeneration.[*according to whom?*] Heinrich Nordhoff (1899\u20131968), a former senior manager at Opel who had overseen civilian and military vehicle production in the 1930s and 1940s, was recruited to run the factory in 1948. In 1949, Major Hirst left the company\u2014now re-formed as a trust controlled by the West German government and government of the State of Lower Saxony. The \"Beetle\" sedan or \"peoples' car\" Volkswagen is the Type 1. Apart from the introduction of the Volkswagen Type 2 commercial vehicle (van, pick-up, and camper), and the VW Karmann Ghia sports car, Nordhoff pursued the one-model policy until shortly before his death in 1968.\n\n\nVolkswagens were first exhibited and sold in the United States in 1949 but sold only two units in America that first year. On entry to the US market, the VW was briefly sold as a *Victory Wagon*. Volkswagen of America was formed in April 1955 to standardise sales and service in the United States. Production of the Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle increased dramatically over the years, the total reaching one million in 1955.\n\n\nThe UK's first official Volkswagen importer, Colborne Garages of Ripley, Surrey, started business with importing parts for the models brought home by soldiers returning from Germany.[21]\n\n\nCanadian Motors, Limited brought in Canada's first shipment of Volkswagens on 10 July 1952 (shipping order 143075).[*citation needed*] The order consisted of 12 vehicles, (3) model 11C, a black, green, and sand colour (3) 11GS, a chestnut brown and two azure blue, (2) 24A-M51 in red, (1) 21A in blue, (1) 23A in blue, (1) 22A beige colour, and one ambulance.[*citation needed*] Volkswagens were seen in Canada for the first time at the Canadian National Exhibition in August 1952 and were accepted enthusiastically. (At least one Type 2 bus from this order still exists, and is currently in France undergoing restoration).[*citation needed*] The first shipment for Volkswagen Canada reached Toronto in early December 1952. (At least one Type 1 from this first shipment still exists, and was driven on a nationwide tour for Volkswagen Canada's 60th year of business festivities in 2012).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBy 1955, sales warranted the building of the Volkswagen plant on a 32-acre (13\u00a0ha) site on Scarborough's Golden Mile. To this, a 60,000-square-foot (5,600\u00a0m2) building with administration, showrooms, service, repairs and parts was built in 1957, with storage for $4,000,000 of parts.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1959, VW started production at a plant near S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil.[28] Volkswagen do Brasil was accused of spying on workers during the time of the military dictatorship in the 1970s and informing police on oppositional activities. In 1976, mass arrests occurred and some VW employees were tortured. In 1979, Brazilian VW workers travelled to Wolfsburg to inform the CEO in person. In 2015, activists and former VW employees in Brazil spoke out in public accused the company's silence about the persecution of its workers. In fall 2016, VW commissioned an expert review of the situation due end of 2017.[29]\n\n\nOn 22 August 1960, *Volkswagenwerk GmbH* was renamed to *Volkswagenwerk AG*. Sales soared throughout the 1960s, peaking at the end of the decade thanks in part to the famous advertising campaigns by New York advertising agency Doyle, Dane Bernbach.[*citation needed*] Led by art director Helmut Krone, and copywriters Julian Koenig and Bob Levinson, Volkswagen advertisements became[*when?*] as popular as the car, using crisp layouts and witty copy to lure the younger, sophisticated consumers with whom the car became associated.[*citation needed*] Even though it was almost universally known as the Beetle (or the Bug), it was never officially labelled as such by the manufacturer, instead referred to as the Type 1.[30]\n\n\nAlthough the car was becoming outdated, during the 1960s and early 1970s, American exports, innovative advertising, and a growing reputation for reliability helped production figures surpass the levels of the previous record-holder, the Ford Model T. On 17 February 1972, the 15,007,034th Beetle was sold. Volkswagen could now claim the world production record for the most-produced, single make of car in history. By 1973, total production was over 16 million.\n\n\nTo commemorate its passing the Ford Model T's record sales mark and its victories in the Baja 1000 Mexican races from 1967 to 1971, Volkswagen produced its first limited-edition Beetle. It was marketed as the \"Baja Champion SE\"[31] in the United States and the \"Marathon\" Superbeetle in the rest of the world. It featured unique \"Marathon Blau\" metallic blue paint, steel-pressed 10-spoke 15-inch (38\u00a0cm) magnesium-alloy wheels, a commemorative metal plate mounted on the glovebox and a certificate of authenticity presented to the original purchaser. Dealer-installed options for this limited-edition Superbeetle included the following: white stripes running the length of the rocker-panel, a special shifter knob, bumper overriders, tapered exhaust tips, fake walnut inserts in the dashboard (behind the steering wheel and the glovebox cover) as well as Bosch fog lights mounted on the front bumper.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 1961\u20131973: Beetle to Golf[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1963 VW Type 3 Notchback\nThe 1961 Type 1 Beetle had a 36\u00a0hp 1200cc four cylinder air-cooled flat-four opposed OHV engine made of aluminium alloy block and heads. By 1966, the Type 1 came with a 1300cc engine. By 1967 the Type 1 had a 1500cc engine, and 1600cc in 1970. The air-cooled engine lost favour in the United States market with the advent of unleaded petrol and smog controls. These air-cooled engines were commonly tuned to be fuel-rich in order to control engine over-heating, and this led to excessive carbon monoxide emissions. VW production equipment was eventually moved to Mexico where vehicle emissions were not regulated. Beetles were popular on the US West Coast where the limited-capacity cabin heating was less inconvenient. Beetles were popularised on the US West Coast as beach buggies and dune buggies.\n\n\nVW expanded its product line in 1961 with the introduction of four Type 3 models (Karmann Ghia, Notchback, Fastback, and Variant) based on the new Type 3 mechanical underpinnings. The name 'Squareback' was used in the United States for the Variant.\n\n\nIn 1969 the larger Type 4 (411 and 412) models were introduced. These differed substantially from previous vehicles, with the notable introduction of monocoque/unibody construction, the option of a fully automatic transmission, electronic fuel injection, and a sturdier powerplant.\n\n\nIn 1964, Volkswagen acquired Auto Union, and in 1969, NSU Motorenwerke AG (NSU). The former company owned the historic Audi brand, which had disappeared after the Second World War. VW ultimately merged Auto Union and NSU to create the modern Audi company, and would go on to develop it as its luxury vehicle marque. The purchase of Auto Union and NSU was a pivotal point in Volkswagen's history, as both companies yielded the technological expertise that proved necessary for VW to survive when demand for its air-cooled models went into decline.\n\n\n\n![](image)1970 VW Squareback (Type III)\nVolkswagen added a \"Super Beetle\"[32] (the Type 131) to its lineup in 1971. The Type 131 differed from the standard Beetle in its use of a MacPherson strut front suspension instead of the usual torsion bars. The Super Beetle featured a new hooded, padded dash and curved windshield (from 1973 model year on up). Rack and pinion steering replaced recirculating ball steering gears in the model year 1975 and up. The front of the car was stretched 2 inches (51\u00a0mm) to allow the spare tire to lie flat, and the combination of these two features increased the usable front luggage space.\n\n\nIn 1973, Volkswagen introduced the military-themed Type 181, or \"Trekker\" in Europe, \"Thing\" in America, recalling the wartime Type 82. The military version was produced for the NATO-era German Army during the Cold War years of 1970 to 1979. The US Thing version only sold for two years, 1973 and 1974.\n\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Type 4 assembly line in Wolfsburg as of 1973\nBy late 1972, Volkswagen had decided to cancel the nearly finished typ 266, a project for a mid-engined car to replace the Beetle, and to focus on front-wheel-drive, water-cooled cars. Rudolf Leiding, recently made head of Volkswagen, cited noise, heat, and servicing problems with the mid-engine layout, as well as the difficulty of making it a station wagon.[33]\n\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Passat (1973\u20131977 model)\nVolkswagen was in serious trouble by 1973.[34] The Type 3 and Type 4 models had sold in much smaller numbers than the Beetle and the NSU-based K70 also failed to sell. Beetle sales had started to decline rapidly in European and North American markets. The company knew that Beetle production had to end, but faced a conundrum of how to replace it. VW's ownership of Audi/Auto Union proved beneficial. Its expertise in front-wheel drive, and water-cooled engines would help Volkswagen produce a credible Beetle successor. Audi influences paved the way for this new generation of Volkswagens: the Passat, Scirocco, Golf, and Polo.\n\n\nFirst in the series was the Volkswagen Passat (Dasher in the US), introduced in 1973, a fastback version of the Audi 80, using many identical body and mechanical parts. Estate/wagon versions were available in many markets. In Europe, the estate/wagon version dominated market share for many years.\n\n\nIn spring 1974, the Scirocco followed. The coupe was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro. Based on the platform of the not yet released Golf, it was built at Karmann due to capacity constraints at Volkswagen.\n\n\nThe pivotal model emerged as the Volkswagen Golf in 1974, marketed in the United States and Canada as the Rabbit for the 1st generation (1975\u20131985) and 5th generation (2006\u20132009). Its angular styling was designed by the Italian Giorgetto Giugiaro. Its design followed trends for small family cars set by the 1959 Mini\u00a0\u2013 the Golf had a transversely mounted, water-cooled engine in the front, driving the front wheels, and had a hatchback, a format that has dominated the market segment ever since. Beetle production at Wolfsburg ended upon the Golf's introduction. It continued in smaller numbers at other German factories (Hanover and Emden) until 1978, but mainstream production shifted to Brazil and Mexico.\n\n\nIn 1975, the Volkswagen Polo followed. It was a re-badged Audi 50, which was soon discontinued in 1978. The Polo became the base of the Volkswagen Derby, which was introduced in 1977. The Derby was for all intents and purposes a three-box design of the Polo. After a second model generation, the Derby was discontinued in 1985, although the body style lived on in the form of the Polo classic/Polo saloon until 1991.\n\n\nPassat, Scirocco, Golf, and Polo shared many character-defining features, as well as parts and engines. They built the basis for Volkswagen's turn-around.\n\n\n\n### 1974\u20131990: Product line expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Polo (1975\u20131979 model)\nWhile Volkswagen's range of cars soon became similar to that of other large European car makers, the Golf has been the mainstay of the Volkswagen line-up since its introduction, and the mechanical basis for several other cars of the company. There have been eight generations of the Volkswagen Golf, the first of which was produced from the summer of 1974 until the autumn of 1983 (sold as the Rabbit in the United States and Canada and as the Caribe in Latin America). Its chassis also spawned the Volkswagen Scirocco sport coupe, Volkswagen Jetta saloon/sedan, Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet convertible, and Volkswagen Caddy pick-up. North American production of the Rabbit commenced at the Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly Plant near New Stanton, Pennsylvania in 1978. It would be produced in the United States as the Rabbit until the spring of 1984.[*citation needed*] The second-generation Golf hatchback/Jetta sedan ran from October 1983 until the autumn of 1991, and a North American version produced at Westmoreland Assembly went on sale at the start of the 1985 model year. The production numbers of the first-generation Golf has continued to grow annually in South Africa as the Citi Golf, with only minor modifications to the interior, engine and chassis, using tooling relocated from the New Stanton, Pennsylvania plant when that site began to build the Second Generation car.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Volkswagen's sales in the United States and Canada fell dramatically, despite the success of models like the Golf elsewhere. Sales in the United States were 293,595 in 1980, but by 1984 they were down to 177,709.[35] The introduction of the second-generation Golf, GTI and Jetta models helped Volkswagen briefly in North America. Motor Trend named the GTI its Car of the Year for 1985, and Volkswagen rose in the J.D. Power buyer satisfaction ratings to eighth place in 1985, up from 22nd a year earlier.[36] VW's American sales broke 200,000 in 1985 and 1986 before resuming the downward trend from earlier in the decade. Chairman Carl Hahn decided to expand the company elsewhere (mostly in developing countries), and the New Stanton, Pennsylvania factory closed on 14 July 1988.[37] Meanwhile, four years after signing a cooperation agreement with the Spanish car maker SEAT in 1982, Hahn expanded the company by purchasing a majority share of SEAT up to 75% by the end of 1986, which VW bought outright in 1990.[38] On 4 July 1985, *Volkswagenwerk AG* was renamed to *Volkswagen AG*.\n\n\nVolkswagen entered the supermini market in 1975 with the Volkswagen Polo, a stylish and spacious three-door hatchback designed by Bertone. It was a strong seller in West Germany and most of the rest of Western Europe, being one of the first foreign small cars to prove popular in Britain. It had started out in 1974 as the Audi 50, which was only available in certain markets and was less popular. The Polo entered a market sector already being dominated by the Fiat 127 and Renault 5, and which before long would also include the Austin Metro and Ford Fiesta.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1981, the second-generation Polo launched as a hatchback (resembling a small estate car). In 1983 the range was expanded, with the introduction of a Coupe (similar to a conventional hatchback), and the Classic (a 2-door saloon).[39] The Polo's practicality, despite the lack of a five-door version, helped ensure even stronger sales than its predecessor. It continued to sell well after a makeover in 1990, finally being replaced by an all-new version in 1994.[40] Also arriving in 1981 were the second generation of the larger Passat and a second generation of the Volkswagen Scirocco coupe.\n\n\nIn 1983 the MK2 Golf was launched. At the beginning of 1988, the third generation Passat was the next major car launch and Volkswagen did not produce a hatchback version of this Passat, despite the rising popularity of the hatchback body style throughout Europe.[*citation needed*] Just after launching the B3 Passat, Volkswagen launched the Corrado, analogous to the Scirocco, although the Scirocco remained in production until 1992; a third generation of Scirocco was in production 2008\u201317.[41]\n\n\n\n### 1991\u20131999[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Golf, in North American form\nIn 1991, Volkswagen launched the third-generation Golf, which was European Car of the Year for 1992. The Golf Mk3 and Jetta Mk3 arrived in North America in 1993. The sedan version of the Golf was badged Vento in Europe but remained Jetta in the United States. The Scirocco and the later Corrado were both Golf-based coup\u00e9s.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen New Beetle\nIn 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the J Mays-designed Concept One, a \"retro\"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, based on the platform of the Polo. Due to a positive response to the concept, a production version was developed as the New Beetle, based on the Golf's larger platform.[42]\n\n\nIn 1995 the Sharan was launched in Europe, the result of a joint venture with Ford, which also resulted in the Ford Galaxy and SEAT Alhambra.[43]\n\n\nThe company's evolution of its model range was continued with the Golf Mk4, introduced at the end of 1997 (North America in 1999), its chassis spawned a host of other cars within the Volkswagen Group; the Volkswagen Bora (the sedan known as the Jetta in the United States), SEAT Toledo, SEAT Le\u00f3n, Audi A3, Audi TT, and \u0160koda Octavia. Other main models during the decade include the Polo, a smaller car than the Golf, and the larger Passat for the segment above the Golf.\n\n\nIn 1998 the company launched the new Lupo city car. In 1999 they announced the first \"3-litre\" car, a lightweight version of the Lupo that could travel 100\u00a0km with only 3-liters of diesel\u2014making it the world's most fuel efficient car at the time.[44]\n\n\n\n### 2000\u20132016: Further expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The fifth generation Volkswagen Jetta\nVolkswagen began introducing an array of new models after Bernd Pischetsrieder became Volkswagen Group CEO (responsible for all Group brands) in 2002. The sixth-generation VW Golf was launched in 2008, came runner-up to the Opel/Vauxhall Insignia in the 2009 European Car of the Year, and has spawned several cousins: VW Jetta, VW Scirocco, SEAT Le\u00f3n, SEAT Toledo, \u0160koda Octavia and Audi A3 hatchback ranges, as well as a new mini-MPV, the SEAT Altea. The GTI, a \"hot hatch\" performance version of the Golf, boasts a 2.0\u00a0L Turbocharged Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) direct injection engine. VW began marketing the Golf under the Rabbit name once again in the US and Canada in 2006.\n\n\nThe sixth-generation Passat and the fifth-generation Jetta both debuted in 2005, and Volkswagen announced plans to expand its lineup further by bringing back the Scirocco by 2008. Other models in Wolfgang Bernhard's (Volkswagen brand CEO) \"product offensive\" include the Tiguan mid-sized SUV in 2008 and a Passat Coup\u00e9. In November 2006 Bernd Pischetsrieder announced his resignation as Volkswagen Group CEO and was replaced by Audi worldwide CEO Martin Winterkorn at the beginning of 2007.\n\n\n\n![](image)The third generation Volkswagen Scirocco\nVolkswagen maintained North American sales of 224,195 in 2005. The momentum continued for fiscal 2006, as Volkswagen's North American sales for the year were 235,140 vehicles, a 4.9 per cent increase over 2005, despite a slump in domestic North American manufacturer's sales. In conjunction with the introduction of new models, the production location of Volkswagen vehicles also underwent a great change. The 2007 Eos, a hardtop convertible, is produced in a new facility in Portugal. All Golfs/Rabbits and GTIs as of 2006 are manufactured in Wolfsburg, Germany, rather than Puebla, Mexico, where Golfs and GTIs for the North American market were produced from 1989 to 1998, and the Brazilian factory in Curitiba, where Golfs and GTIs were produced from 1999 to 2006 (the Jetta has been primarily manufactured in Mexico since 1989). Volkswagen is also in the process of reconfiguring an automotive assembly plant in Belgium. The new models and investments in manufacturing improvements were immediately noticed by automotive critics. Favourable reviews for Volkswagen's newest cars include the GTI being named by *Consumer Reports* as the top sporty car under $25,000, one of *Car and Driver* magazine's \"10 Best\" for 2007, *Automobile* Magazine's 2007 Car of the Year, as well as a 2008 *Motor Trend* comparison ranking the mid-size Passat first in its class.\n\n\n\n![](image)The seventh-generation Volkswagen Golf\nVolkswagen partnered with Daimler AG and other companies to market the BlueTec clean diesel technology on cars and trucks from Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and other companies and brands. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, four of the ten most fuel-efficient vehicles available for sale in the United States are powered by Volkswagen diesel engines.[45] Volkswagen has offered a number of its vehicles with a TDI (Turbocharged Direct Injection) engine, which lends class-leading fuel economy to several models. They were a three-way tie for 8th (TDI Beetle, TDI Golf, TDI Jetta) and ninth, the TDI Jetta Wagon. In addition, all Volkswagen TDI diesel engines produced from 1996 to 2006 can be driven on 100% biodiesel fuel.[*citation needed*] For the 2007 model year, however, strict US government emissions regulations had forced Volkswagen to drop most diesels from their US engine lineup, but a new lineup of diesel engines (then thought) compatible to US standards returned to the American market starting with Model Year 2009. These post-2009 Clean Diesel engines are limited to running on 5% (B5) biodiesel only to maintain Volkswagen's warranty. Volkswagen long resisted adding a SUV to its lineup, but relented with the introduction of the Touareg, made in partnership with Porsche, while they worked on the Porsche Cayenne and later the Audi Q7. Though acclaimed as a fine handling vehicle, the Touareg has been a modest seller at best, and it has been criticised by auto reviewers for its absence of a third-row seat, the relatively poor fuel economy, and the high vehicle mass. Volkswagen set plans to add a compact SUV with styling influences from the \"Concept A\" concept vehicle introduced at the 2006 Geneva Auto Show, and on 20 July 2006, Volkswagen announced that the new vehicle called the Tiguan.\n\n\nSince the discontinuation of the T4 in 2003 and the decision not to export the T5 to the United States, Volkswagen, coincidentally, lacked a van for its North American lineup. To remedy this, Volkswagen launched the Volkswagen Routan, a badge-engineered Dodge Grand Caravan made for the American and Canadian markets, in 2008.\n\n\nIn September 2006, Volkswagen began offering the City Golf and City Jetta only for the Canadian market. Both models were originally the Mk4 Golf and Jetta but were later replaced with the Brazilian versions of the Golf Mk4 and Bora. Volkswagen's introduction of such models is seen as a test of the market for a subcompact and, if successful, may be the beginnings of a thriving subcompact market for Volkswagen.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen Passat (3C)\nIn May 2011, Volkswagen completed Chattanooga Assembly in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The Chattanooga Assembly plant marked VW's first plant since the plant at New Stanton was closed down. The facility has produced Volkswagen cars and SUVs specifically designed for the North American markets, beginning with the Passat B7 in 2011. The company recently announced plans to expand further by investing $900\u00a0million to add floor space to the factory.[46]\n\n\nThe VW XL1 began a limited production run in 2013. The XL1 is a lightweight and fuel-efficient two-person vehicle (only 795\u00a0kg).\n\n\nThe Volkswagen Atlas, a large crossover SUV, began production in late 2016, and aimed to help end several years of losses for Volkswagen in the United States, the world's second-largest auto market.[47][48] On 14 September 2016, Volkswagen announced its partnership with three Israeli cybersecurity experts to create a new company, Cymotive, dedicated to automotive security.[49]\n\n\n\n### 2017\u2013present: Focus on electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen ID.3\nIn 2017, Volkswagen announced plans to place a considerable focus on electric vehicles (EV), with a goal to, by 2025, launch at least 30 EV models, and have 20 to 25 per cent of their total yearly sales volume (2\u20133 million) consist of EVs.[50] In September, Volkswagen CEO Matthias M\u00fcller stated that the company aimed to have electric versions of all of its vehicle models by 2030, at a cost of 20\u00a0billion euro, and 50\u00a0billion euro on acquisition of batteries.[51] On 6 March 2017 at the Geneva Motor Show Volkswagen presented its prototype for a fully autonomous car, Sedric.[52]\n\n\nVolkswagen returned to motorsport in 2018 by unveiling its all-electric I.D. R. At the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb, Romain Dumas set an all-time course record of just under eight minutes driving the I.D. R.[53]\n\n\nIn September 2018, Volkswagen announced that it would discontinue production of the Beetle (A5) in 2019.[54] Also in September 2018, Volkswagen announced its $100 million investment in Silicon Valley-based solid-state battery startup QuantumScape, becoming the startup's largest automotive investor and gaining representation on its board.[55]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Volkswagen announced that it would launch an entry-level Jetta sub-brand in China aimed at young buyers. Three models were announced in July 2019, a sedan and two SUVs,[56] all three of which will be manufactured in China as a part of Volkswagen's joint-venture with FAW.[57]\n\n\nIn September 2019 at the Frankfurt Motor Show, Volkswagen officially unveiled a refreshed logo (a thinner, two-dimensional version of the previous logo) and new sonic branding, which will accompany the newly launched ID.3 electric vehicle. Volkswagen stated that the ID.3 signified the start of a \"new era\" of the company.[58]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Volkswagen also announced a program to allow old Beetle models to be converted to run on electric power. The electric motor and battery updates will be done in partnership with German company eClassics.[59] The electric components used for retrofitting will be based upon those found in the e-up! model.\n\n\nIn November 2020, Volkswagen announced that, trying to remain the world's largest carmaker in the green era, it has increased its investment in electric and self-driving cars to $86 billion over the next five years.[60]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Volkswagen announced that its sales in 2020 dropped by 9.9% in China, 23.4% in western Europe and 17.1% in North America.[61]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Volkswagen announced that it would stop developing new internal combustion engines, although it would keep tweaking existing engines to comply with stricter emission rules.[62][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\nAlso, the company announced it was changing the American division's name to \"Voltswagen\", with the help of Johannes Leonardo, before revealing the move to be a hoax. In a tweet, the company said, the stunt \"got the whole world buzzing.\" However, some news sources considered the announcement to be real, including the Associated Press, whose headline about being fooled stated, \"Volkswagen caught lying again, this time about changing its name.\"[63]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Volkswagen released the ID. Buzz electric minivan.[64]\n\n\nOn May 11, 2022, Volkswagen confirmed the relaunch of its Scout off-road vehicle brand, this time as an EV.[65] Production is set to begin in 2026, and this relaunch will be the first time that VW creates a new brand based solely in the U.S. market.[66]\n\n\nIn July 2022 Volkswagen noted the development of the first of their own *Gigafactories*.[67] The site, based in Salzgitter in Germany, has been termed *Mission SalzGiga*. The new business unit is focused on all of Volkswagen's battery activities \"from raw materials and the cell right through to recycling\", and is part of a \u20ac20 billion investment.[67]\n\n\nOn Sep 2022 Volkswagen introduces the ID. XTREME1 off-road Electric concept Car, an off-road electric SUV.[68]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **appears to be slanted towards recent events.** Please try to keep recent events in historical perspective and add more content related to non-recent events. *(July 2017)*\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Global sales figures,2006\u20132018[69] |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | Sales (in millions) |\n| 2006\n | 5.7\n |\n| 2007\n | 6.2\n |\n| 2008\n | 6.3\n |\n| 2009\n | 6.3\n |\n| 2010\n | 7.3\n |\n| 2011\n | 8.4\n |\n| 2012\n | 9.3\n |\n| 2013\n | 9.7\n |\n| 2014\n | 10.2\n |\n| 2015\n | 10.0\n |\n| 2016\n | 10.3\n |\n| 2017\n | 10.7[70] |\n| 2018\n | 10.8[71] |\n| 2019\n | 11.0[72] |\n\n\nVolkswagen is the founding and namesake member of the Volkswagen Group, a large international corporation in charge of multiple car and truck brands, including Audi, SEAT, Porsche, Lamborghini, Bentley, Bugatti, Scania, MAN, and \u0160koda. Volkswagen Group's global headquarters are located in Volkswagen's historic home of Wolfsburg, Germany.[73][74]\n\n\nVolkswagen Group, as a unit, is Europe's largest motor vehicle manufacturer, with over 74,000 employees and over 7,700 dealerships.[75] For a long time, Volkswagen has had a market share over 20 per cent.[76]\n\n\nIn 2010, Volkswagen posted record sales of 6.29\u00a0million vehicles, with its global market share at 11.4%.[77] In 2008, Volkswagen became the third-largest car maker in the world,[78] and, as of 2016, Volkswagen was the second largest manufacturer worldwide.[79] In 2018 the company benefited from trade tariffs and new emission standards, with a record deliveries of 10.8 million vehicles.[80] Volkswagen Group's core markets include Germany and China.[81]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Volkswagen invested $2.6 billion in Argo AI, a startup focused on developing self-driving vehicles.[82]\n\n\n\n### International properties[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen logo evolution (1937\u20132019)\nVolkswagen has factories in many parts of the world, manufacturing or assembling vehicles for local markets. In addition to plants in Germany, Volkswagen has manufacturing or assembly facilities in Mexico, the United States, Slovakia, China, India, Russia (sold to the Russian company Avilon in 2023[83]), Malaysia, Brazil, Argentina, Portugal, Spain, Poland, the Czech Republic, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kenya and South Africa. In 2011, Volkswagen was named in the top 25 largest companies in the world by the Forbes Global 2000.[84][85]\n\n\nAs of May 2014, Volkswagen was planning to start assembling certain engines in India to increase localisation from 70% to 90%.[86]\n\n\nIn January 2016, Volkswagen announced the launch of a new factory in Algeria during a summit between Angela Merkel and Algerian prime minister Abdelmalek Sellal.[87] The factory was launched in Relizane, producing Volkswagen Golf VII, Volkswagen Polo, Volkswagen Caddy, SEAT Ibiza and \u0160koda Octavia cars.\n\n\nIn the 2021 review of WIPOTooltip World Intellectual Property Organization's annual World Intellectual Property Indicators VW ranked 6th in the world for its 84 industrial design registrations that were published under the Hague System during 2020.[88] This position is down on their previous 5th-place ranking for 73 industrial design registrations being published in 2019.[89][*third-party source needed*]\n\n\nSince 1985, Volkswagen has also run the Volkswagen AutoMuseum in Wolfsburg, which is dedicated to the history of the company.[90][*third-party source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Working conditions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Volkswagen worker organizations\n\nWith 120,000 employees in Germany,[91] VW is one of the most well organized labour represented companies in the world and Germany. The role that Works Councils and IG Metall play is unique even within Germany. VW workers have some of the strongest collective agreements. VW has a strong tradition and practice of social partnership and co-determination.[92]\n\n\nVolkswagen agreed in December 2011 to implement a rule passed by the company's Works Council aimed at improving work\u2013life balance and avoiding burnout by restricting company email functionality on the firm's BlackBerry smartphones to working periods and the half-hour before and after working periods. About 1,150 of Volkswagen's more than 190,000 employees in Germany were affected by the email restriction.[93]\n\n\nBecause of Volkswagen's use of IPPD,[94][95] a human contact allergen, in various polymers of their vehicles, they have coined the term \"Volkswagen dermatitis\".[96]\n\n\n\n### Relationship with Porsche and the Volkswagen Law[edit]\n\n\nVolkswagen has always had a close relationship with Porsche, the Zuffenhausen-based sports car manufacturer founded in 1931 by Ferdinand Porsche, the original Volkswagen designer and Volkswagen company co-founder, hired by Adolf Hitler for the project. The first Porsche car, the Porsche 64 of 1938, used many components from the Volkswagen Beetle. The 1948 Porsche 356 continued using many Volkswagen components, including a tuned engine, gearbox and suspension.\n\n\nThe two companies continued their collaboration in 1969 to make the VW-Porsche 914 and Porsche 914-6. (The 914-6 had a 6-cylinder Porsche engine, and the standard 914 had a Volkswagen engine.) Volkswagen and Porsche would collaborate again in 1976 on the Porsche 912-E (the USA only) and the Porsche 924, which used many Audi components and was built at Audi's Neckarsulm facilities. The 924 was originally designated for AUDI. Most Porsche 944 models were built there, although they used far fewer VW components.\n\n\nThe Porsche Cayenne, introduced in 2002, shares its entire chassis with the Volkswagen Touareg and Audi Q7, and is built at the same Volkswagen factory in Bratislava that the other SUVs are built.\n\n\nIn September 2005, Porsche announced it would increase its 5% stake in Volkswagen to 20% at a cost of \u20ac3\u00a0billion, with the intention that the combined stakes of Porsche and the government of Lower Saxony would ensure that any hostile takeover by foreign investors would be impossible.[97] Speculated suitors included DaimlerChrysler, BMW, and Renault. In July 2006, Porsche increased their ownership again to 25.1%.\n\n\nOn 4 March 2005, the European Commission brought an action against the Federal Republic of Germany before the European Court of Justice, claiming that the Volkswagen Law, which prevents any shareholder in Volkswagen from executing more than 20% of the total voting rights in the firm, was illegally restricting the flow of capital in Europe.[98] On 13 February 2007, Advocate General D\u00e1maso Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer submitted an opinion to the court in support of the action.[99] This again opened the possibility of a hostile takeover of VW and so on 26 March of the same year Porsche took its holding of Volkswagen shares to 30.9%. Porsche formally announced in a press statement that it did not intend to take over Volkswagen, but intended the move to avoid a competitor's taking a large stake and to stop hedge funds from dismantling VW.[100] As expected, on 22 October 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled in agreement with Ruiz-Jarabo and the law was struck down.[101][102] In October 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled that the VW law was illegal[103] because it was protectionist. At that time, Porsche held 31% of VW shares\u00a0\u2013 although a smaller proportion of voting rights, due to the Volkswagen Law\u00a0\u2013 and there had been speculation that Porsche would be interested in taking over VW if the law did not stand in its way. The court also prevented the government from appointing Volkswagen board members.[104] The German government then rewrote the Volkswagen law, only to be sued again.[105][106][107] In October 2013, the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled that the rewritten Volkswagen law \"complied in full\" with EU rules.[108]\n\n\nOn 26 October 2008, Porsche revealed its plan to assume control of VW. As of that day, it held 42.6% of Volkswagen's ordinary shares and stock options on another 31.5%. Combined with the state of Lower Saxony's 20.1% stake, this left only 5.8% of shares on the market\u2014mostly with index funds that could not legally sell.[109] Hedge funds desperate to cover their short positions forced Volkswagen stock above one thousand euros per share, briefly making it the world's largest company by market capitalisation on 28 October 2008.[110] By January 2009, Porsche had a 50.76% holding in Volkswagen AG, although the \"Volkswagen Law\" prevented it from taking control of the company.[111]\n\n\nOn 6 May 2009, the two companies decided to join, in a merger.\n\n\nOn 13 August, Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft's supervisory board signed the agreement to create an integrated automotive group with Porsche led by Volkswagen. The initial decision was for Volkswagen to take a 42.0% stake in Porsche AG by the end of 2009, and it would also see the family shareholders selling the automobile trading business of Porsche Holding Salzburg to Volkswagen.[112] In October 2009 however, Volkswagen announced that its percentage in Porsche would be 49.9% for a cost of \u20ac3.9\u00a0billion (the 42.0% deal would have cost \u20ac3.3\u00a0billion).[113] On 1 March 2011, Volkswagen has finalised the purchase of Porsche Holding Salzburg (PHS), Austria's leading specialty automobile distributor, for \u20ac3.3\u00a0billion ($4.55\u00a0billion).[114]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Volkswagen was overtaken by Tesla, Inc. as the second-most valuable auto maker.[115]\n\n\n\n## Product line[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Volkswagen vehicles\n\n\n\n| Best-selling Volkswagen models in 2022[116] |\n| --- |\n| Rank\n | Model\n | Production output\n |\n| 1\n | Tiguan | 604,536\n |\n| 2\n | Polo/Virtus/Vento/Ameo | 448,043\n |\n| 3\n | Passat/Magotan | 447,246\n |\n| 4\n | Lavida | 377,284\n |\n| 5\n | T-Roc | 322,211\n |\n| 6\n | T-Cross/Tacqua/Taigun | 315,036\n |\n| 7\n | Golf | 300,090\n |\n| 8\n | Jetta/Sagitar | 292,038\n |\n| 9\n | Atlas/Teramont | 217,771\n |\n| 10\n | Tharu/Taos | 216,397\n |\n\n\nThe Volkswagen brand produces various models which consists of global products and regional products, specifically for large markets including Europe, China and Latin America. Volkswagen AG annual report in 2022 reported that the best-selling model under the Volkswagen brand globally was the Tiguan, followed by the B-segment range of Polo, Virtus, Nivus and Taigo, and Passat/Magotan.[116]\n\n\n\n### Hatchbacks[edit]\n\n\nVolkswagen has been one of the leading manufacturer in terms of hatchback production, which traditionally has been a popular segment in Europe.[117][118] The brand offered a range of hatchbacks from A-segment, B-segment, and C-segment. The Golf traditionally has been the strongest selling vehicle for the brand in Europe, followed by the smaller Polo which apart from the European market also has a stronghold in emerging markets. Sales for the hatchback category has slowed down due to the rise of the SUV segment.[119][120]\n\n\n\n### SUVs/crossovers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen Tiguan has claimed the top spot in terms of sales figures within Volkswagen models.\nThe brand introduced its first crossover SUV in 2002 starting from the Touareg, a full-size luxury SUV. The brand SUV expansion continues with the release of Tiguan, a C-segment mainstream SUV in 2007. In the mid-2010s, the company decided to produce an SUV in every class of car that can justify one, which the brand called the \"SUV offensive\".[121] Between 2017 and 2020, the brand has aggressively expanded its SUV line-up by growing its number of models from 2 to 8 models, excluding its derivatives, ranging from B-segment, C-segment, and D-segment SUVs which include global models and regional models. Volkswagen also started producing derivatives of its SUV models with a rear sloping roof marketed as coup\u00e9 SUV which had gained popularity in China, the largest single market for the brand.[122][123]\n\n\nIn 2019, every fourth vehicle delivered by the Volkswagen brand today is an SUV, with its top contributor being the Tiguan. The brand plans to have over 30 SUV models on offer worldwide by 2025, contributing 50 per cent of its global sales.[124] Volkswagen also expects SUVs to lead the ID. family, its future electric vehicle range of models.[125]\n\n\nThe SUV expansion has claimed casualties in the MPV segment, which saw the Sharan mid-size MPV being phased out in 2020.[126]\n\n\n\n### Regional models[edit]\n\n\n#### Chinese market[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen Lavida was the best-selling sedan in China.\nVolkswagen is a market leader in China, which is the largest single automotive market in the world. In 2019, 3.16 million Volkswagen-branded vehicles were delivered in the country.[127] The importance of the market has justified a significant amount of China-specific models.\n\n\nSedans are a favoured segment in China due to their spacious interiors and boot space. In 2019, the brand sold 1.6 million of them in China. In the compact notchback or sedan segment, the brand is represented by several China-only models which include the Sagitar, Lamando, Bora, Santana, Lavida, and its derivatives in other body styles,[128] while the mid-size sedan segment is represented by the Passat and Magotan.[129][130] The Lavida was the best-selling model in China of all manufacturers in 2019 with 491,000 units sold.[131]\n\n\nThe popularity of SUVs also gave birth to several SUV models built or reworked specifically for China, including the Tharu, Tayron, Tayron X, Tiguan X, and reworked versions of the T-Cross and T-Roc.[132] The brand also has a strong presence in the premium or luxury segment including the Phideon and Viloran as the models developed specifically for China.[133][134]\n\n\nOn July 26, 2023, Volkswagen announced its investment of $700 million in Chinese EV maker XPeng for purchasing 4.99% stake of the company. The VW will collaborate with XPeng to develop two VW brand electric models for the mid-size segment in the Chinese market in 2026.[135][136]\n\n\n\n#### Brazilian market[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen Kombi was produced in Brazil from 1957 up to 2013.\nThe brand has a notable history in Brazil. Volkswagen's relationship with Brazil dates back to the early 1950s. In 1956, Volkswagen began by building a plant in S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, near S\u00e3o Paulo as its first manufacturing plant outside Germany as a response to the Brazil's ban on the import of completely assembled vehicles in 1950.[137] One year later, the plant started to produce the Kombi model \u2013 370 cars at that time, with a 50 per cent local content component share. Of 81 million vehicles produced over six decades in Brazil, 23 million of it was built by Volkswagen, which was produced by four passenger car factories in the country. In 2018, Volkswagen accounted for close on 15 per cent of the Brazilian car market.[138]\n\n\n\nThe importance of the Brazilian market gave birth to several models developed and manufactured by Volkswagen do Brasil, which include the Fox, Gol, Nivus, Saveiro, Virtus and Voyage. These models are also typically exported throughout Latin America. Historical vehicles built for the market include the Bras\u00edlia, SP1 & SP2, 1500/Variant/Variant II, Karmann Ghia TC, Parati and Suran.[139][140][141] The Gol, first launched in 1980, was the best-selling car in the country for 27 consecutive years, up until 2013.[137][138]\n\n\n### Environment-friendly vehicles[edit]\n\n\n#### Pure ethanol vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)VW pure ethanol prototype car developed by Volkswagen do Brasil in 1978\nVolkswagen do Brasil produced and sold pure ethanol-powered (E100 only) vehicles in Brazil, and production was discontinued only after they were supplanted by more modern Flex Fuel technology. As a response to the 1973 oil crisis, the Brazilian government began promoting bioethanol as a fuel, and the National Alcohol Program -*Pr\u00f3-\u00c1lcool*- (Portuguese: *Programa Nacional do \u00c1lcool*) was launched in 1975.[142][143][144] Compelled by the 1979 energy crisis, and after development and testing with government fleets by the CTA at S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, and further testing of several prototypes developed by the four local carmakers, including Volkswagen do Brasil, pure ethanol vehicles were launched in the Brazilian market.[142][143] Petrol engines were modified to support hydrous ethanol characteristics and changes included compression ratio, amount of fuel injected, replacement of materials that would get corroded by the contact with ethanol, use of colder spark plugs suitable for dissipating heat due to higher flame temperatures, and an auxiliary cold-start system that injects petrol from a small tank in the engine compartment to help starting when cold. Within six years, around 75% of all Brazilian passenger cars were manufactured with ethanol engines.[142][145]\n\n\nProduction and sales of pure ethanol vehicles tumbled beginning in 1987 owing to several factors, including a sharp decline in petrol prices as a result of the 1980s oil glut, and high sugar prices in the world market, shifting sugarcane ethanol production from fuel to sugar. By mid-1989, a shortage of ethanol fuel supply in the local market left thousands of vehicles in line at petrol stations or out of fuel in their garages, forcing consumers to abandon ethanol vehicles.[144][146]\n\n\n\n#### Flexible-fuel vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Gol Total Flex\nThe 2003 VW Gol 1.6 Total Flex was the first full flexible-fuel vehicle launched in Brazil, capable of running on any blend of petrol and E100. In March of that year, on its fiftieth anniversary, Volkswagen do Brasil launched in the local market the Gol 1.6 Total Flex, the first Brazilian commercial flexible fuel vehicle capable of running on any mix of E20-E25 petrol and up to 100% hydrous ethanol fuel (E100).[147][148][149][150] After the pure ethanol fiasco, consumer confidence in ethanol-powered vehicles was restored, allowing a rapid adoption of the flex technology. This was facilitated by the fuel distribution infrastructure already in place throughout Brazil, with more than 30 thousand fueling stations, a heritage of the *Pr\u00f3-\u00c1lcool* program[151]\n\n\nOwing to the success and rapid consumer acceptance of the flex-fuel versions, by 2005 VW had sold 293,523 flex-fuel cars and light-duty trucks, and only 53,074 petrol-only automobiles,[152] jumping to 525,838 flex-fuel vehicles and only 13,572 petrol-only cars and 248 petrol-only light trucks in 2007,[153] and reaching new car sales of 564,959 flex-fuel vehicles in 2008, representing 96% of all new cars and light-duty trucks sold in that year.[154] VW do Brasil stopped manufacturing petrol-only vehicles models for the local market in 2006,[148] and all of the remaining petrol-only Volkswagen models sold in Brazil are imported. The flex-fuel models currently produced for the local market are the Gol, Fox, CrossFox, Parati, Polo Hatch, Polo Sedan, Saveiro, Golf, and Kombi.[155] By March 2009, Volkswagen do Brasil had attained the milestone mark of two million flex-fuel vehicles produced since 2003.[156][157]\n\n\n\n#### Hybrid vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen Jetta Hybrid gets 48\u00a0mpg\u2011US (20.4\u00a0km/L) on highway.\nVolkswagen and Sanyo have teamed up to develop a battery system for hybrid cars.[158] Volkswagen head Martin Winterkorn has confirmed the company plans to build compact hybrid electric vehicles. He has stated \"There will definitely be compact hybrid models, such as Polo and Golf, and without any great delay\", with petrol and diesel power. For example, Golf is the ideal model to go hybrid as the Golf 1.4 TSI was recently awarded the \"Auto Environment Certificate\" by the Oko-Trend Institute for Environmental Research, and was considered one of the most environmentally friendly vehicles of 2007.[159] Also underway at Volkswagen's Braunschweig R&D facilities in Northern Germany is a hybrid version of the next-generation Touareg.[160]\n\n\nVW intends all future models to have the hybrid option. \"Future VW models will fundamentally also be constructed with hybrid concepts,\" VW head of development Ulrich Hackenberg told *Automobilwoche* in an interview. Hackenberg mentioned that the car based on the Up! concept seen at Frankfurt Motor Show,[161] as well as all future models, could be offered with either full or partial hybrid options. The rear-engine up! will go into production in 2011. Nothing has been said about plug-in hybrid options.[162]\n\n\nVolkswagen announced at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show the launch of the 2012 Touareg Hybrid, scheduled for 2011.[163][164] VW also announced plans to introduce diesel-electric hybrid versions of its most popular models in 2012, beginning with the new Jetta, followed by the Golf Hybrid in 2013 together with hybrid versions of the Passat.[165][166] In 2012, the Volkswagen Jetta Hybrid set the world record to become the fastest hybrid car at 187\u00a0mph (301\u00a0km/h).\n\n\n\n#### Plug-in electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2009, Volkswagen announced it has hired Karl-Thomas Neumann as its group chief officer for electric traction.[167] VW's Chief of research, J\u00fcrgen Leohold, said in 2010 the company has concluded hydrogen fuel-cell cars are not a viable option.[168][169]\n\n\n\n![](image)Volkswagen Golf GTE plug-in hybrid charging\nAs of May\u00a02016[update], the Volkswagen Group offers for retails customers nine plug-in electric cars, of which, three are all-electric cars: the Volkswagen e-Up!, e-Golf and Audi R8 e-tron, and six are plug-in hybrids: the Volkswagen Golf GTE, Passat GTE, Audi A3 Sportback e-tron, Q7 e-tron quattro, Porsche Panamera S E-Hybrid and Cayenne S E-Hybrid.[170] Also two limited production plug-in hybrids were manufactured beginning in 2013, the Volkswagen XL1 (250 units) and the Porsche 918 Spyder (918 units).[171][172] Total cumulative sales of all Volkswagen brand electrified cars since the start of their respective production is expected to reach about 103,000 by the end of 2016.[170] The Volkswagen ID.4 was launched in the U.S. in September 2020.\n\n\nIn order to comply with increasingly strict carbon dioxide emission limits in major markets, the VW Group expects to sell about one million all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles a year worldwide by 2025. The Group plans to expand its plug-in range with 20 new pure electric and plug-in hybrid cars, including two cars to compete with Tesla, Inc., the Porsche Mission E all-electric car and the Audi e-tron quattro, which is expected to become the brand's first mass-production electric vehicle. According to Thomas Ulbrich, VW brand production chief, the carmaker has the capacity to build as many as 75,000 battery-electric and plug-in hybrids a year if demand rises. Volkswagen announced in October 2015 that \"it will develop a modular architecture for battery-electric cars, called the MEB. The standardised system will be designed for all body structures and vehicle types and will allow the company to build emotionally appealing EVs with a range of up to 310\u00a0mi (500\u00a0km).\"[170] In June 2016, VW launched a program to develop 30 all-electric cars in 10 years, and sell 2\u20133\u00a0million electric cars per year by 2025.[173] Due to lower manpower requirements for electric motors than for piston engines, VW expects a gradual workforce reduction as numbers of electric cars increase.[174][175] VW considers battery factory ownership as too expensive.[176]\n\n\n\n### Flying vehicles[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Volkswagen issued a statement that \"vertical mobility\" could be the next step after self-driving technology. It announced that the company is exploring the feasibility of flying vehicles in China.[177]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volkswagen up! won the 2012 World Car of the Year.\nVolkswagen was named the fourth most influential car of the 20th century in the 1999 Car of the Century competition, for its Volkswagen Type 1 \"Beetle\" model. It trailed only the Ford Model T, BMC Mini, and Citro\u00ebn DS.[178]\n\n\nVolkswagen has produced four winners of the 50-year-old European Car of the Year award.\n\n\n\n* 1992 \u2013 Volkswagen Golf\n* 2010 \u2013 Volkswagen Polo\n* 2013 \u2013 Volkswagen Golf\n* 2015 \u2013 Volkswagen Passat\n\nVolkswagen has produced five winners of the United States Motor Trend Car of the Year award\u00a0\u2013 the original Car of the Year designation, which began in 1949.\n\n\n\n* 1985 \u2013 Volkswagen GTI\n* 1999 \u2013 Volkswagen New Beetle (Import COTY subgroup)\n* 2004 \u2013 Volkswagen Touareg (Sport Utility Vehicle COTY subgroup)\n* 2012 \u2013 Volkswagen Passat\n* 2015 \u2013 Volkswagen Golf line-up[179]\n\nVolkswagen has already produced five winners of the recently developed World Car of the Year award.\n\n\n\n* 2009 \u2013 Volkswagen Golf\n* 2010 \u2013 Volkswagen Polo\n* 2012 \u2013 Volkswagen up!\n* 2013 \u2013 Volkswagen Golf\n* 2021 \u2013 Volkswagen ID.4\n\n## Motorsport rally team[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Volkswagen Motorsport\n\n### Formula racing[edit]\n\n\n* In 1963, Formula Vee circuit racing, with cars built from easily available Beetle parts, started in the United States. It quickly spread to Europe and other parts of the world. It proved very popular as a low-cost route into formula racing.[180]\n* In 1971, Volkswagen of America started the more powerful Formula Super Vee,[181] which became famous for hothousing new talent.[*citation needed*] In the 11 years it ran, until 1982, it produced a stable of world-famous Formula One drivers\u2014names like Niki Lauda, Jochen Mass, Nelson Piquet, Jochen Rindt and Keke Rosberg. Volkswagen also notched up several victories, and the championship in Formula Three.\n* In July 2011 Wolfgang D\u00fcrheimer told German magazine *Auto, Motor und Sport* that \"if [the VW group] is at the forefront of the auto industry, I can imagine us competing in Formula 1 in 2018. We have enough brands to pull it off.\"[182][183] They did not compete in F1 in 2018.\n\n\n### World Rally Championship[edit]\n\n\n* In 1981, now based in Hanover, VW took a new direction into rallying, with the launch of the first-generation Golf, and Sweden's Per Eklund, Frenchman Jean-Luc Th\u00e9rier, and the Finn Pentti Airikkala. The final chapters in Volkswagen Racing UK's rallying story were the 'one-make' Castrol Polo Challenge, and the Polo GTI 'Super 1600' in 2001.\n* Volkswagen Motorsport won the World Rally Championship with S\u00e9bastien Ogier and co-driver Julien Ingrassia four years in a row from 2013 to 2016 in the Volkswagen Polo R WRC.\n\n\n### Dakar Rally[edit]\n\n\n* In 1980, Volkswagen competed with the Audi-developed Iltis, placing 1st, 2nd, 4th and 9th overall.\n* In 2003, the Hanover-based team entered with a 2WD buggy named Tarek, finishing 6th overall and 1st in the 2WD and Diesel class.\n* In 2005, an updated Race-Touareg with slightly more power entered, with driver Bruno Saby finishing 3rd overall and 1st in the Diesel class.\n* In 2006, the revised Race-Touareg entered, with driver Giniel de Villiers finishing 2nd overall and 1st in the Diesel class.\n* Volkswagen won the 2009, 2010 and 2011 Dakar Rally, held in South America.\n\n\n### Volkswagen motorsport worldwide[edit]\n\n\n* Europe: In 1998 the company founded the ADAC Volkswagen Lupo Cup, founded in 1998 (renamed Polo Cup in 2003, and Volkswagen Scirocco R-Cup from 2010 to 2014), and started the ADAC New Beetle Cup in 2000. In 2004, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles entered the European Truck Racing series with the Volkswagen Titan truck\u00a0\u2013 it became a back-to-back champion for the 2004 and 2005 series.\n* United States: In 1976, Volkswagen entered the under-2000-cc Trans-Am Series, with the Scirocco, and they won their class outright.[184] Beginning in 2008 Volkswagen introduced the Jetta TDI Cup. The Jetta TDI Cup is an SCCA sanctioned race series that features 25 drivers between the ages of 16 and 26 driving slightly modified 2009 Jetta TDIs. The series features 10 events at 8 different road courses across North America. There is $50,000 prize money at stake over the course of the series in addition to the $100,000 prize awarded to the champion of the series at the conclusion of the last race.[185]\n* Argentina: Many Volkswagen models have competed in TC 2000, including the 1980 to 1983 champion Volkswagen 1500 and the 1994 champion Volkswagen Gol.\n* In 1999 and 2000, VW won the F2 Australian Rally Championship with the Golf GTI.\n* Finland: In 2002, VW won the Finnish Rally Championship in a7/(F2), with a Golf Mk4 KitCar, with Mikko Hirvonen. In 1999 and 2000, VW won the Finnish Rally Championship in a7/(F2) with a Golf Mk3 KitCar. In 2000, 2001 and 2002, VW won the Finnish Racing Championship in Sport 2000 with a Golf Mk4.[186][187][188]\n* Austria: From 1967 until 1974, the Austrian sole distributor Porsche Salzburg entered the VW Beetle (1500, 1302S and 1303S) in Europe-wide rallies. Victories were achieved in 1972 and 1973 in the overall Austrian championship, on Elba, in the Acropolis rally (first in class). Top drivers were Tony Fall (GB), Achim Warmbold (D), G\u00fcnter Janger (A), Harry K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m (S).\n\n\n* ![1939 Berlin to Rome.

It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903. The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand, and luxury cars under its Lincoln brand. Ford also owns a 32% stake in China's Jiangling Motors.[8] It also has joint ventures in China (Changan Ford), Taiwan (Ford Lio Ho), Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand), and Turkey (Ford Otosan). The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family; they have minority ownership but the majority of the voting power.[6][9]\n\n\nFord introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving assembly lines; by 1914, these methods were known around the world as Fordism. Ford's former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land Rover, acquired in 1989 and 2000, respectively, were sold to the Indian automaker Tata Motors in March 2008. Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010.[10] In 2011, Ford discontinued the Mercury brand, under which it had marketed entry-level luxury cars in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East since 1938.\n\n\nFord is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker (behind General Motors) and the sixth-largest in the world (behind Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Hyundai Motor Group, Stellantis, and General Motors) based on 2022 vehicle production.[11] At the end of 2010, Ford was the fifth-largest automaker in Europe.[12] The company went public in 1956 but the Ford family, through special Class B shares, still retain 40 percent of the voting rights.[6][13] During the financial crisis of 2007\u201308, the company struggled financially but did not have to be rescued by the federal government, unlike the other two major US automakers.[14][15] Ford Motors has since returned to profitability,[16] and was the eleventh-ranked overall American-based company in the 2018 Fortune 500 list, based on global revenues in 2017 of $156.7\u00a0billion.[17] In 2008, Ford produced 5.532\u00a0million automobiles[18] and employed about 213,000 employees at around 90 plants and facilities worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Ford Motor Company\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founder Henry Ford c. 1919\nThe Henry Ford Company was Henry Ford's first attempt at a car manufacturing company and was established on November 3, 1901. This became the Cadillac Motor Company on August 22, 1902, after Ford left with the rights to his name.[19] The Ford Motor Company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with $28,000 (equivalent to $950,000 in 2023) in cash from twelve investors, most notably John and Horace Dodge (who would later found their own car company). The first president was not Ford, but local banker John S. Gray, who was chosen in order to assuage investors' fears that Ford would leave the new company the way he had left its predecessor. During its early years, the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on Mack Avenue and later at its factory on Piquette Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Groups of two or three men worked on each car, assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford. Within a decade the company led the world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept, and Ford soon brought much of the part production in-house (vertical integration).\n\n\nHenry Ford was 39 years old when he founded the Ford Motor Company, which would go on to become one of the world's largest and most profitable companies. It has been in continuous family control for over 100 years and is one of the largest family-controlled companies in the world.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe first gasoline-powered automobile had been created in 1885 by the German inventor Karl Benz (Benz Patent-Motorwagen). More efficient production methods were needed to make automobiles affordable for the middle class, to which Ford contributed by, for instance, introducing the first moving assembly line in 1913 at the Ford factory in Highland Park.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)A 1910 Model T (introduced in 1908), photographed in Salt Lake City\nBetween 1903 and 1908, Ford produced the Models A, B, C, F, K, N, R, and S. Hundreds or a few thousand of most of these were sold per year. In 1908, Ford introduced the mass-produced Model T, which totaled millions sold over nearly 20 years. In 1927, Ford replaced the T with the Model A, the first car with safety glass in the windshield.[20] Ford launched the first low-priced car with a V8 engine in 1932.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn an attempt to compete with General Motors' mid-priced Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick, Ford created the Mercury in 1939 as a higher-priced companion car to Ford. Henry Ford purchased the Lincoln Motor Company in 1922, in order to compete with such brands as Cadillac and Packard for the luxury segment of the automobile market.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1929, Ford was contracted by the government of the Soviet Union to set up the Gorky Automobile Plant in Russia initially producing Ford Model A and AAs thereby playing an important role in the industrialization of that country.[21]\n\n\n\n![](image)B-24 Liberator bombers being mass-produced at Ford's Willow Run assembly plant in 1944\nDuring World War II, the United States Department of War picked Ford to mass-produce the Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber at its Willow Run assembly plant.[22] Ford Werke and Ford SAF (Ford's subsidiaries in Germany and France, respectively) produced military vehicles and other equipment for Nazi Germany's war effort. Some of Ford's operations in Germany at the time were run using forced labor.\n\n\nThe creation of a scientific laboratory in Dearborn, Michigan, in 1951, doing unfettered basic research, led to Ford's unlikely involvement in superconductivity research. In 1964, Ford Research Labs made a key breakthrough with the invention of a superconducting quantum interference device or SQUID.[23]\n\n\nFord offered the Lifeguard safety package from 1956, which included such innovations as a standard deep-dish steering wheel, optional front, and, for the first time in a car, rear seatbelts, and an optional padded dash.[24] Ford introduced child-proof door locks into its products in 1957, and, in the same year, offered the first retractable hardtop on a mass-produced six-seater car.[25]\n\n\nIn late 1955, Ford established the Continental division as a separate luxury car division. This division was responsible for the manufacture and sale of the famous Continental Mark II. At the same time, the Edsel division was created to design and market that car starting with the 1958 model year. Due to limited sales of the Continental and the Edsel disaster, Ford merged Mercury, Edsel, and Lincoln into \"M-E-L,\" which reverted to \"Lincoln-Mercury\" after Edsel's November 1959 demise.[25]\n\n\nThe Ford Mustang was introduced on April 17, 1964, during New York World's Fair (where Ford had a pavilion made by The Walt Disney Company).[26][27] In 1965, Ford introduced the seat belt reminder light.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith the 1980s, Ford introduced several highly successful vehicles around the world. During the 1980s, Ford began using the advertising slogan, \"Have you driven a Ford, lately?\" to introduce new customers to their brand and make their vehicles appear more modern. In 1990 and 1994, respectively, Ford also acquired Jaguar Cars and Aston Martin.[28] During the mid-to-late 1990s, Ford continued to sell large numbers of vehicles, in a booming American economy with a soaring stock market and low fuel prices.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith the dawn of the new century, legacy health care costs, higher fuel prices, and a faltering economy led to falling market shares, declining sales, and diminished profit margins. Most of the corporate profits came from financing consumer automobile loans through Ford Motor Credit Company.[29]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)William Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of Henry Ford, serves as the executive chairman at the board of Ford Motor Company.\nBy 2005, both Ford and GM's corporate bonds had been downgraded to junk status[30] as a result of high U.S. health care costs for an aging workforce, soaring gasoline prices, eroding market share, and an overdependence on declining SUV sales. Profit margins decreased on large vehicles due to increased \"incentives\" (in the form of rebates or low-interest financing) to offset declining demand.[31] In the latter half of 2005, Chairman Bill Ford asked newly appointed Ford Americas Division President Mark Fields to develop a plan to return the company to profitability. Fields previewed the plan, named *The Way Forward*, at the board meeting of the company on December 7, 2005, and it was unveiled to the public on January 23, 2006. \"The Way Forward\" included resizing the company to match market realities, dropping some unprofitable and inefficient models, consolidating production lines, closing 14 factories and cutting 30,000 jobs.[32]\n\n\nFord moved to introduce a range of new vehicles, including \"Crossover SUVs\" built on unibody car platforms, rather than more body-on-frame chassis. In developing the hybrid electric powertrain technologies for the Ford Escape Hybrid SUV, the company licensed similar Toyota hybrid technologies[33] in order to avoid patent infringements.[34] Ford announced that it would team up with electricity supply company Southern California Edison (SCE) to examine the future of plug-in hybrids in terms of how home and vehicle energy systems will work with the electrical grid. Under the multimillion-dollar, multi-year project, Ford is to convert a demonstration fleet of Ford Escape Hybrids into plug-in hybrids, and SCE is to evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid. Some of the vehicles are to be evaluated \"in typical customer settings\", according to Ford.[35][36]\n\n\nWilliam Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of Henry Ford (and better known by his nickname \"Bill\"), was appointed executive chairman in 1998, and also became chief executive officer of the company in 2001, with the departure of Jacques Nasser, becoming the first member of the Ford family to head the company since the retirement of his uncle, Henry Ford II, in 1982. Ford sold motorsport engineering company Cosworth to Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven in 2004, the start of a decrease in Ford's motorsport involvement. Upon the retirement of president and chief operations officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed his roles as well. Five months later, in September, Ford named Alan Mulally as president and CEO, with Ford continuing as executive chairman. In December 2006, the company raised its borrowing capacity to about $25\u00a0billion, placing substantially all corporate assets as collateral.[37] Chairman Bill Ford has stated that \"bankruptcy is not an option\".[38] Ford and the United Auto Workers, representing approximately 46,000 hourly workers in North America, agreed to a historic contract settlement in November 2007 giving the company a substantial break in terms of its ongoing retiree health care costs and other economic issues. The agreement included the establishment of a company-funded, independently run Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust to shift the burden of retiree health care from the company's books, thereby improving its balance sheet. This arrangement took effect on January 1, 2010. As a sign of its currently strong cash position, Ford contributed its entire current liability (estimated at US$5.5\u00a0billion as of December 31, 2009) to the VEBA in cash, and also pre-paid US$500\u00a0million of its future liabilities to the fund. The agreement also gave hourly workers the job security they were seeking by having the company commit to substantial investments in most of its factories.\n\n\n\n![](image)Horton Classic Car Museum, Nocona, Texas.\nThe automaker reported the largest annual loss in company history in 2006 of $12.7\u00a0billion,[39] and estimated that it would not return to profitability until 2009.[40] However, Ford surprised Wall Street in the second quarter of 2007 by posting a $750\u00a0million profit. Despite the gains, the company finished the year with a $2.7\u00a0billion loss, largely attributed to finance restructuring at Volvo.[41]\n\n\nOn June 2, 2008, Ford sold its Jaguar and Land Rover operations to Tata Motors for $2.3\u00a0billion.[42][43]\n\n\nDuring congressional hearings held in November 2008 at Washington D.C., Ford's Alan Mulally stated that \"We at Ford are hopeful that we have enough liquidity. But we also must prepare ourselves for the prospect of further deteriorating economic conditions\". He went on to state that \"The collapse of one of our competitors would have a severe impact on Ford\" and that Ford Motor Company supported both Chrysler and General Motors in their search for government bridge loans in the face of conditions caused by the 2008 financial crisis.[44][45] Together, the three companies presented action plans for the sustainability of the industry. Mulally stated that \"In addition to our plan, we are also here today to request support for the industry. In the near-term, Ford does not require access to a government bridge loan. However, we request a credit line of $9 billion as a critical backstop or safeguard against worsening conditions as we drive transformational change in our company\".[46] GM and Chrysler received government loans and financing through T.A.R.P. legislation funding provisions.[47]\n\n\nOn December 19, the cost of credit default swaps to insure the debt of Ford was 68 percent of the sum insured for five years, in addition to annual payments of 5 percent. That meant $6.8\u00a0million paid upfront to insure $10\u00a0million in debt, in addition to payments of $500,000 per year.[48] In January 2009, Ford reported a $14.6\u00a0billion loss in the preceding year, a record for the company. The company retained sufficient liquidity to fund its operations. Through April 2009, Ford's strategy of debt-for-equity exchanges erased $9.9 billion in liabilities (28% of its total) in order to leverage its cash position.[49] These actions yielded Ford a $2.7\u00a0billion profit in fiscal year 2009, the company's first full-year profit in four years.[50] In 2012, Ford's corporate bonds were upgraded from junk to investment grade again, citing sustainable, lasting improvements.[51]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2012, Ford announced the sale of its climate control components business, its last remaining automotive components operation, to Detroit Thermal Systems LLC for an undisclosed price.[52]\n\n\nOn November 1, 2012, Ford announced that CEO Alan Mulally would stay with the company until 2014. Ford also named Mark Fields, its president of operations in the Americas, as its new chief operating officer[53] Mulally was paid a compensation of over $174 million in his previous seven years at Ford since 2006. The generous amount has been a sore point for some workers of the company.[54]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Ford announced a plan to modernize its Dearborn engineering and headquarters campuses through a ten-year building project. The result would see the number of Ford employees working in these areas doubling, to 24,000. During construction, some 2000 of the employees were relocated out of the campus to a temporary location in a disused section of the local shopping mall.[55] Facilities would also be altered to allow ride-sharing and electric and self-driving vehicles.[56] Estimates of the construction cost were $1.2 billion.[57]\n\n\n\n![](image)The historic, once abandoned Michigan Central Station was purchased by Ford Motor Company in May 2018 and is expected to undergo a significant four-year renovation.\nOn January 3, 2017, Ford CEO Mark Fields announced that in a \"vote of confidence\" because of the pro-business climate being fostered in part by President-elect Donald Trump, Ford had canceled plans to invest $1.6 billion in a new plant in Mexico to manufacture the Ford Focus; instead, the company would invest $700 million in Michigan, which it planned to use to create 700 new jobs. The Focus would now be manufactured in the existing plant in Mexico.[58] Also in 2017, Ford began development of a new mixed-use urban campus in the Corktown neighborhood of Detroit, with its purchase, renovation, and occupation of The Factory at Michigan and Rosa Parks. The new site was expected to have a major focus on the development of autonomous vehicle and electric vehicle technology.[59] Ford later began buying up other parcels of land in Corktown including a very high-profile purchase of Michigan Central Station which is planned to become the hub of their Corktown campus, and the adjacent Roosevelt Warehouse.[60] Ford expects to move 2,500 of its employees, roughly 5 percent of its southeast Michigan workforce, to the campus with space for an additional 2,500 entrepreneurs, technology companies and partners.[61] Bill Ford envisioned the first-floor concourse of the train station to be a public gathering place with retail outlets and restaurants.[62]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Ford Motor Co. acquired majority ownership of Argo AI, a self-driving car startup.[63]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Ford announced cuts to its global workforce amid efforts to address the company's declining share price and to improve profits. The company is targeting $3 billion in cost reduction and a nearly 10% reduction in the salaried workforce in Asia and North America to enhance earnings in 2018.[64][65] Jim Hackett was announced to replace Mark Fields as CEO of Ford Motor. Mr. Hackett most recently oversaw the formation of Ford Smart Mobility, a unit responsible for experimenting with car-sharing programs, self-driving ventures and other programs aimed at helping Ford better compete with Uber, Alphabet Inc. and other tech giants looking to edge in on the auto industry.[66][67]\n\n\nOn April 25, 2018, Ford announced that it would discontinue passenger cars in the North American market in the next four years, except for the Mustang, due to declining demand and profitability.[68] The Focus Active, a crossover SUV based on the newly unveiled fourth-generation Focus, was also intended to be marketed in the United States. Due to the vehicle being manufactured in China, Ford later announced that it would not release the Focus Active in the United States, due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese exports.[69][70]\n\n\nIn March 2020, the Detroit United Auto Workers union announced that after discussion with the leaders of General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the carmakers would partially shut down factories on a \"rotating\" basis to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.[71] On March 24, representatives of Ford announced that production in the US, Canada, and Mexico would not resume on March 30 as originally planned, amid the further coronavirus pandemic spread.[72] In the first quarter of 2020, Ford's sales dropped by 15%, entailing the loss of $2 billion.[73]\n\n\nWith the change in the demand for the sport vehicles, on January 6, 2021, Ford reported a sales fall of 9.8% in the fourth quarter, selling 542,749 vehicles, compared to 601,862 in 2019.[74]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Ford said that it would provide COVID-19 vaccines for its employees, who were to obtain them at the company; at the beginning the vaccination program would be in southeast Michigan, Missouri and Ohio, but it was to be expanded later on to other locations.[75]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Ford announced that it would restructure the company into three separate divisions. Ford Model E is to focus on electric vehicles; Ford Blue is to focus on internal combustion vehicles; and the existing commercial division is to be rebranded as Ford Pro, to focus on vehicle distribution and service.[76][7]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Ford announced it planned layoffs of roughly 3,000 employees and contract workers, confirming earlier reporting. The cuts would mostly affect divisions in the US, Canada, and India, which Jim Farley said would allow the company to prepare for the future of electric, software-heavy vehicles.[77][78]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Ford announced that it was going to cut 3,800 jobs across Europe, with the job cuts mainly focusing on their German and British workforce. Ford will be cutting 2,300 jobs from Germany, 1,300 from the United Kingdom, and an additional 200 jobs in the rest of Europe, according to the head of Ford Germany, Martin Sander. The cuts will mainly be done to the company's engineers.[79]\n\n\nFord announced that their electric vehicle business had lost $3 billion before taxes over the past two years and will lose a similar amount in 2023 as the company looks to significantly invest in Electric Technology. The Ford Model E is expected to be profitable by 2026.[80]\n\n\nIn April 2023, United Kingdom ministers approved Ford's BlueCruise technology. Because of this assisted driving technology, Ford drivers can now legally take their hands off the wheel on certain roads. Its top speed is 129\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph). BlueCruise uses sensors and cameras to regulate the car's speed and to keep track of speed limits and road signs. It also monitors and keeps a safe distance from other vehicles. It also comes equipped with an eye-tracking system. If the driver stops looking at the road then the car will gradually reduce its speed. This technology will initially be offered in Ford's 2023 model of the electric Mustang Mach-E SUV. \nAccording to Thatcham Research, an automotive research company, this model is not a self-driving car. It is classified as a level 2 or partial automation assistance system. This means that technology controls two or more driving aspects but still requires human driver control in cases of emergencies. The driver is still legally responsible for accidents.[81]\n\n\n\n### Logo evolution[edit]\n\n\n* ![1903](image)\n\n1903\n* ![1907](image)\n\n1907\n* ![1909](image)\n\n1909\n* ![1911](image)\n\n1911\n* ![1912](image)\n\n1912\n* ![1912 variant](image)\n\n1912 variant\n* ![1927](image)\n\n1927\n* ![1957](image)\n\n1957\n* ![1976](image)\n\n1976\n* ![2003](image)\n\n2003\n* ![2017](image)\n\n2017\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n### Executive management[edit]\n\n\nMembers of the Ford board as of March\u00a02023[update] are: William Clay Ford Jr. (executive chairman), Jim Farley (president and CEO), Kimberly Casiano, Alexandra Ford English (daughter of William Clay Ford Jr.), Henry Ford III (son of Edsel Ford II), William W. Helman IV, Jon Huntsman Jr., William E. Kennard, John C. May, Beth E. Mooney, John L. Thornton, John Veihmeyer, Lynn Vojvodich Radakovich, and John S. Weinberg.[82]\n\n\nJim Farley succeeded Jim Hackett as the chief executive officer of the company in August, 2020; he previously served as Ford's chief operating officer. Hackett stayed in the company as an advisor until the second quarter of 2021.[83]\n\n\n\n## Ford Motor Company Fund[edit]\n\n\nThe Ford Motor Company Fund (also known as Ford Fund, not affiliated with the Ford Foundation), based in Dearborn, Michigan, is the philanthropic arm of the Ford Motor Company.[84] Established in 1949[85] by Henry Ford II,[*citation needed*] Ford Fund is a nonprofit corporate foundation[86] financed by contributions from Ford Motor Company. In 2017, Ford Fund contributed $63 million[87] to various causes[84] with a focus on education, driving safely and community building.\n\n\nThe Ford Driving Skills for Life program is a driver safety program aimed at teens that were developed together with the Governors Highway Safety Association and safety experts.[88] The Ford Volunteer Corps allows Ford employees and retirees to sign up for volunteering work on local projects in more than 40 countries.[89] The Ford Fund invests $18 million annually in education in the United States and around the world, but accepts applications only from nonprofit organizations registered in the U.S.[90] Education programs and scholarships include Alan Mulally Engineering Scholarship, Ford Blue Oval Scholars Program, Ford College Community Challenge (Ford C3), Ford Driving Dreams Tour, Ford Fund/Detroit Free Press Journalism Scholarship, Ford Next Generation Learning (Ford NGL), Grants to Individuals Program, HBCU Community Challenge, Smithsonian Latino Center Young Ambassadors Program, and William Clay Ford Automotive Design Scholarship.\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nFord has had manufacturing operations worldwide, including in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, and South Africa. Ford also helped the Soviet Union to construct Russian automaker GAZ.\n\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford dealer in Garden City, New York, c. 1930\u20131945\nIn May 2010, Ford reported that its sales increased 23% for the month, and that 37% of its sales came from fleet sales.[91] In June 2010, sales to individual customers at dealerships increased 13% while fleet sales rose by 32%.[92] In the first seven months of 2010, fleet sales of Ford for the same period rose 35% to 386,000 units while retail sales increase 19%.[93] Fleet sales account for 39 percent of Chrysler's sales and 31 percent for GM's.[93]\n\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford of Europe\n\n![](image)The Ford Research Center in Aachen, Germany, photographed in 2006\nAt first, Ford in Germany and Ford in Britain built different models from one another until 1965, when the Ford Transit and later the Ford Escort and the Ford Capri became common to both companies. In 1970, the Ford Taunus and the Ford Cortina came into production with a common base construction, both models being produced in left hand drive and right hand drive. Later on, the models became identical and the respective models right- and left-hand-drive exclusively. Rationalisation of model ranges meant that production of many models in the UK switched to elsewhere in Europe, including Belgium and Spain as well as Germany. The Ford Sierra replaced the Taunus and Cortina in 1982, drawing criticism for its radical aerodynamic styling, which was soon given nicknames, the \"Jellymould\" and \"The Salesman's Spaceship.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)Ford's Dunton Technical Centre in Laindon, United Kingdom, the largest automotive research and development facility in the country,[94] pictured in 2006\nIn February 2002, Ford ended car production in the UK. It was the first time in 90 years that Ford cars had not been made in Britain, although production of the Transit van continued at the company's Southampton facility until mid-2013, engines at Bridgend and Dagenham, and transmissions at Halewood. Development of European Ford is broadly split between Dunton in Essex (powertrain, Fiesta/Ka, and commercial vehicles) and Cologne (body, chassis, electrical, Focus, Mondeo) in Germany. Ford also produced the Thames range of commercial vehicles, although the use of this brand name was discontinued with the introduction of the Ford Transit in 1965. Elsewhere in continental Europe, Ford assembles the Mondeo, Galaxy, S-Max[95] and Kuga[96] in Valencia (Spain), Fiesta in Cologne (Germany), Focus in Saarlouis (Germany), Ecosport[97] and Puma[98] in Craiova (Romania).\n\n\nFord also owns a joint-venture production plant in Turkey. Ford Otosan, established in the 1970s, manufactures the Transit Connect compact panel van as well as the \"Jumbo\" and long-wheelbase versions of the full-size Transit. This new production facility was set up near Kocaeli in 2002, and its opening marked the end of Transit assembly in Genk.\n\n\nAnother joint venture plant near Set\u00fabal in Portugal, set up in collaboration with Volkswagen, formerly assembled the Galaxy people-carrier as well as its sister ships, the VW Sharan and SEAT Alhambra. With the introduction of the third generation of the Galaxy, Ford has moved the production of the people-carrier to the Genk plant, with Volkswagen taking over sole ownership of the Set\u00fabal facility.\n\n\nIn 2008, Ford acquired a majority stake in Automobile Craiova, Romania. Starting 2009, the Ford Transit Connect was Ford's first model produced in Craiova, followed, in 2012, by low-capacity car engines and a new small class car, the B-Max.[99]\n\n\nIts 1959 Anglia two-door saloon was one of the most quirky-looking small family cars in Europe at the time of its launch, but buyers soon became accustomed to its looks and it was hugely popular with British buyers in particular. It was still selling well when replaced by the more practical Escort in 1967.\n\n\nThe third incarnation of the Ford Escort was launched in 1980 and marked the company's move from rear-wheel-drive saloons to front-wheel-drive hatchbacks in the small family car sector.\n\n\nThe fourth-generation Escort was produced from 1990 until 2000, although its successor\u2014the Focus\u2014had been on sale since 1998. On its launch, the Focus was arguably the most dramatic-looking and fine-handling small family cars on sale and sold in huge volumes right up to the launch of the next-generation Focus at the end of 2004.\n\n\nThe 1982 Ford Sierra\u2014replacement for the long-running and massively popular Cortina and Taunus models\u2014was a style-setter at the time of its launch. Its ultramodern aerodynamic design was a world away from a boxy, sharp-edged Cortina, and it was massively popular just about everywhere it was sold. A series of updates kept it looking relatively fresh until it was replaced by the front-wheel-drive Mondeo at the start of 1993.\n\n\nThe rise in popularity of small cars during the 1970s saw Ford enter the mini-car market in 1976 with its Fiesta hatchback. Most of its production was concentrated at Valencia in Spain, and the Fiesta sold in huge figures from the very start. An update in 1983 and the launch of an all-new model in 1989 strengthened its position in the small car market.\n\n\nOn October 24, 2012, Ford announced that it would close its Genk assembly plant in eastern Belgium by the end of 2014.[100]\n\n\nIn 2015, Ford announced that it took control of Ford Sollers, Ford's joint venture with Russian company Sollers.[101][102]\n\n\nIn September 2018, at the IAA Commercial Vehicles show in Hannover, Germany, Ford introduced an electric tractor-trailer concept vehicle dubbed the F-Vision, which would have Level 4 autonomous driving capability.[103]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2022, Ford announced that it was suspending its Sollers joint venture operation in Russia, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[104][105] On October 26, 2022, Ford sold its 49 percent share in the joint venture, and exited the Russian market,[106] adding that it retains the option to buy them back within a 5-year period \u201cshould the global situation change.[107]\n\n\n\n### East and Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\nFord formed its first passenger-vehicle joint venture in China in 2001, six years behind GM and more than a decade after VW. It has spent as of 2013[update] $4.9 billion to expand its lineup and double production capacity in China to 600,000 vehicles. This includes Ford's largest-ever factory complex in the southwestern city of Chongqing. Ford had 2.5% of the Chinese market in 2013, while VW controlled 14.5% and GM had 15.6%, according to consultant LMC Automotive. GM outsells Ford in China by more than six-to-one.[108] Ford's presence in Asia has traditionally been much smaller, confined to Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Taiwan, where Ford has had a joint venture with Lio Ho since the 1970s. Ford began assembly of cars in Thailand in 1960, but withdrew from the country in 1976, and did not return until 1995 when it formed a joint venture with Mazda called Auto Alliance.[109] Now based in the Bo-win Sub District of the Sriracha District in Chonburi, the factory still produces passenger automobiles. The factory, built in 1941 in Singapore, was soon taken over by the Japanese during the war and was the site of a surrender of the British to the Japanese, at the factory site which is now a national monument in Singapore.\nOn April 30, 2013, Ford Motor Co. launched their car and truck line in Myanmar. Previously, heavy importation taxes had stifled imported car purchases in Myanmar, but due to currency reform, lifting of previous import restrictions, and the abolishment of shadow currency, Myanmar's car market had grown in demand.[110]\n\n\n\n#### South Korea[edit]\n\n\nIn 1967, Ford partnered with the South Korean company Hyundai, and at the new factory in Ulsan, South Korea, built the European Ford Cortina until 1974 when Hyundai introduced their all-new Hyundai Pony in 1975. Ford then developed a relationship with Korea's oldest car manufacturer Kia which built vehicles co-engineered with Mazda, later selling the Ford Festiva from 1988 to 1993, and the Ford Aspire from 1994 to 1997 for export to the United States. With the acquisition of a stake in Japanese manufacturer Mazda in 1979, Ford began selling Mazda's Familia and Capella as the Ford Laser and Telstar throughout the region, replacing the European-sourced Escort and Cortina. From 1989 to 1996, Kia imported the Mercury Sable from Ford in the U.S. and sold them in South Korea as the Kia Sable. Though the Sable was branded and marketed as a Kia, it retained the Mercury badges and emblem. Ford lost their Kia interest to Hyundai in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. Kia had declared bankruptcy in 1997; in 1998, Hyundai Motor Company acquired 51% of the company, outbidding Ford which had owned an interest in Kia Motors since 1986.[111] After subsequent divestments,[112] Hyundai Motor Company owns less than 50% of the company but remains Kia's largest stakeholder.\n\n\nAs of 2020[update], Ford sells the Explorer, Mondeo, and Mustang,[113] as well as the Lincoln Aviator, Continental, Corsair, MKZ, and Nautilus in South Korea.[114]\n\n\n\n### South and West Asia[edit]\n\n\nFord India began production in 1998 at Chennai, Tamil Nadu, with its Ford Escort model, which was later replaced by the locally produced Ford Ikon in 2001. It has since added the Fusion, Fiesta, Mondeo and Endeavour models to its product line.\n\n\nOn March 9, 2010, Ford launched its first made-for-India compact car. Starting at \u20b9349,900, the Figo was Ford's first car designed and priced for the mass Indian market.[115] On July 28, 2011, Ford India signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the State of Gujarat for the construction of an assembly and engine plant in Sanand and planned to invest approximately US$1 billion on a 460-acre site.[116] In 2019, the company and Mahindra & Mahindra formed a joint venture to develop, market and distribute Ford-branded vehicles in India.[117] In September 2021 Ford India announced plans to shut down both its assembly plants. The company said that it intends to maintain its parts and service network.[118]\n\n\nFord's market presence in the Middle East has traditionally been small, partly due to previous Arab boycotts of companies dealing with Israel. Ford and Lincoln vehicles are currently marketed in ten countries in the region.[119] Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates are the biggest markets. Ford also established itself in Egypt in 1926 but faced an uphill battle during the 1950s due to the hostile nationalist business environment.[120] Ford's distributor in Saudi Arabia announced in February 2003 that it had sold 100,000 Ford and Lincoln vehicles since commencing sales in November 1986. Half of the Ford and Lincoln vehicles sold in that country were Ford Crown Victorias.[121] In 2004, Ford sold 30,000 units in the region, falling far short of General Motors' 88,852 units and Nissan Motors' 75,000 units.\n\n\n\n### South America[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford assembly plant in General Pacheco, Argentina, as seen in the 1960s\nIn South America, Ford's primary operations are in Brazil, Argentina, and Ford Andina[122] (Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela). Ford employs over 18,000 people and operates seven assembly or other plants in the region.[123] In 1987, Ford Brasil and Ford Motor Argentina merged their operations with the Brazilian and Argentine operations of Volkswagen Group, forming a new joint-venture company called Autolatina with a shared model range.[124] Autolatina was dissolved in 1995.[124]\n\n\nIn early 2021, Ford's Brazil branch announced it would completely cease production in the country over the course of a few months.[125]\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\nIn Africa, Ford's market presence has traditionally been strongest in South Africa and neighbouring countries, with only trucks being sold elsewhere on the continent. Ford in South Africa began by importing kits from Canada to be assembled at its facility in Port Elizabeth; the company later sourced its models from the UK and Australia, with local versions of the Ford Cortina including the XR6, with a 3.0 V6 engine, and a Cortina-based 'bakkie' or pick-up, which was exported to the UK. In the mid-1980s Ford merged with a rival company, owned by Anglo American, to form the South African Motor Corporation (Samcor).[126]\n\n\nFollowing international condemnation of apartheid, Ford divested from South Africa in 1988, and sold its stake in Samcor, although it licensed the use of its brand name to the company.[127] Samcor began to assemble Mazdas as well, which affected its product line-up and saw the European Fords like the Escort and Sierra replaced by the Mazda-based Laser[128] and Telstar.[129] Ford bought a 45 per cent stake in Samcor following the demise of apartheid in 1994, and this later became, once again, a wholly owned subsidiary, the Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa. Ford now sells a local sedan version of the Fiesta (also built in India and Mexico), and the Focus. The Falcon model from Australia was also sold in South Africa, but was dropped in 2003; the Mondeo, after briefly being assembled locally, was dropped in 2005. The Mondeo was later reintroduced in 2015, badged as the Fusion, but was dropped in 2017.[130]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nFord Research and Innovation Center is the name of the technology research facilities of Ford Motor Company in\n\n\n\n* Dearborn, Michigan\n* Palo Alto, California\n* Aachen, Germany\n* Nanjing, China\n\n\nThe Ford Research and Innovation Center in Palo Alto was first opened in 2012, and in January 2015, announced plans to significantly expand its operations.[131][132][133][134]\n\n\n\n## Former operations[edit]\n\n\n### East and Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\nFord decided to shut down their entire operations in Indonesia, including their dealer network by second half of 2016.[135][136]\n\n\n\n#### Ford of Japan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford Motor Company of Japan\n\nFord established a manufacturing facility in the port city of Yokohama in February 1925, where Model T vehicles were assembled using imported knock-down kits.[137] The factory subsequently produced 10,000 Model A's up to 1936. Production ceased in 1940 as a result of political tensions between Japan and the United States.\n\n\nAfter World War II, Ford did not have a presence in Japan, as the Ford facility was appropriated by the Japanese Government until 1958 when property was returned as a possession of the Ford Motor Company and became a research and development location for Ford partner Mazda. In 1979, Ford acquired a 24.5% ownership stake in Mazda, and in 1982, Ford and Mazda jointly established a sales channel to sell Ford products in Japan, including vehicles manufactured in North America, at a dealership called *Autorama (Japanese)*. The Autorama sales channel was renamed Ford Sales of Japan in 1997.[138]\n\n\nVehicles sold at *Autorama* locations were the North American assembled Ford Explorer, Probe (1989\u20131998), Mustang, Taurus (1989\u20131997), Thunderbird (1990\u20131993), Lincoln Continental, and Lincoln LS. Ford products manufactured in Europe that were sold in Japan were the Ford Mondeo, Ka, Focus, Focus C-MAX, Fiesta, and the Galaxy. Mazda manufactured Ford vehicles in Japan and sold them as Fords at the Autorama locations. They were the Ford Telstar (Mazda Capella), Laser, Festiva, Festiva Mini Wagon, Ixion (Mazda Premacy), Freda (Mazda Bongo Friendee), Spectron (Mazda Bongo), and commercial trucks J80 and the J100 (Mazda Bongo truck).\n\n\nFord increased its shareholding in Mazda to 33.4% in 1996, but as of July\u00a02016[update], it is listed at 11%.[139] Ford did sell a small range of vehicles in Japan; as of October\u00a02010[update], the Ford Mustang, Escape, Explorer (and Explorer truck), Ford Kuga, Lincoln Navigator, Lincoln MKX, and more recently, the Ford Ecosport were available in Japan. As of February\u00a02016[update], Ford no longer maintains a regional office in Minato, Tokyo, Japan, and sales of new cars in Japan have ended.[140][141]\n\n\n\n### Oceania[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford FG X Falcon (Australia) (2014\u20132016; 2014 model shown)\n![](image)The Ford stamping plant in Geelong, Victoria, Australia. It closed in 2016.\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the popular Ford Falcon (1960\u20132016) had long been considered the average family car and is considerably larger than the Mondeo, Ford's largest car sold in Europe. Between 1960 and 1972, the Falcon was based on a U.S. model of the same name, but since then has been entirely designed and manufactured in Australia until 2016, occasionally being manufactured in New Zealand. Like its General Motors rival, the Holden Commodore, the Falcon used a rear-wheel-drive layout. High-performance variants of the Falcon running locally built engines produce up to 362\u00a0hp (270\u00a0kW). A ute (short for \"utility\", known in the U.S. as pickup truck) version is also available with the same range of drivetrains. In addition, Ford Australia sold highly tuned limited-production Falcon sedans and utes through its performance car division, Ford Performance Vehicles until it closed in 2014.\n\n\nIn Australia, the Commodore and Falcon had traditionally outsold all other cars and constituted over 20% of the new car market. In New Zealand, Ford was second in market share in the first eight months of 2006 with 14.4%.[142] More recently, Ford has axed its Falcon-based LWB variant of its lineup\u2013 the Fairlane and LTD ranges. Ford discontinued the Fairlane in 2007 and LTD in 2008. Ford had announced that their Geelong engine manufacturing plant would be shut down between 2013 and 2016. They had earlier announced local manufacturing of the Focus small car starting from 2011, but instead decided to import the model from Ford's plant in Thailand.[143]\n\n\nIn Australia, the Laser was one of Ford Australia's most successful models and was manufactured in Ford's Homebush West plant from 1981 until the plant's closure in September 1994. It outsold the Mazda 323, despite being almost identical to it because the Laser was manufactured in Australia and Ford was perceived as a local brand.[144] According to research carried out by Ford Australia in 1984, a third of Laser buyers were unaware that the Ford model was based on the Mazda 323.[145]\n\n\nIn New Zealand, the Ford Laser and Telstar were assembled alongside the Mazda 323 and 626 until 1997, at the Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ) plant in Wiri, Auckland.[146] The Sierra wagon was also assembled in New Zealand, owing to the popularity of station wagons in that market.[147]\n\n\nThe scheduled closure of Ford's Australian manufacturing base in 2016 was confirmed on May 23, 2013. Headquartered in the Victorian suburb of Broadmeadows, the company had registered losses worth AU$600 million over the five years prior to the announcement. It was noted that the corporate fleet and government sales that account for two-thirds of large, local car sales in Australia are insufficient to keep Ford's products profitable and viable in Australia. The decision will affect 1200 Ford workers\u2014over 600 employees in Geelong and more than 500 in Broadmeadows\u2014who will lose their jobs by October 2016. The closure of Ford's plants in Norlane Geelong and Broadmeadows Melbourne occurred on October 7, 2016.[148]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\n### Automobiles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Ford vehicles, List of Lincoln vehicles, and List of Mercury vehicles\n\n![](image)The 2017 model year F-150\nFord Motor Company sells a broad range of automobiles under the Ford marque worldwide, and an additional range of luxury automobiles under the Lincoln marque in the United States. The company has sold vehicles under a number of other marques during its history. The Mercury brand was introduced by Ford in 1939, continuing in production until 2011 when poor sales led to its discontinuation.[149] In 1958, Ford introduced the Edsel brand, but poor sales led to its discontinuation in 1960. In 1985, the Merkur brand was introduced in the United States to market products produced by Ford of Europe; it was discontinued in 1989.\n\n\nFord acquired the British sports car maker Aston Martin in 1989, later selling it on March 12, 2007,[150] although retaining an 8% stake.[151][152] Ford purchased Volvo Cars of Sweden in 1999,[153] selling it to Zhejiang Geely Holding Group in 2010.\n\n\nIn November 2008, it reduced its 33.4% controlling interest in Mazda of Japan to a 13.4% non-controlling interest.[154] On November 18, 2010, Ford reduced their stake further to just 3%, citing the reduction of ownership would allow greater flexibility to pursue growth in emerging markets. Ford and Mazda remain strategic partners through exchanges of technological information and joint ventures, including an American joint venture plant in Flat Rock, Michigan called Auto Alliance.[155] In 2015, Ford sold its remaining 3% stake in Mazda.[156]\n\n\nFord sold the United Kingdom-based Jaguar and Land Rover companies and brands to Tata Motors of India in March 2008.\n\n\nOn April 25, 2018, Ford announced that it planned to phase out all but one of its North American automobile models (the Mustang will be the sole surviving model) to focus primarily on trucks and SUVs. Ford had also planned to introduce an \"Active\" crossover version of the next-generation Focus, but canceled those plans due to tariff issues between the United States and China.[157]\n\n\n\n### Trucks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An advertisement for the 1939 Ford V-8 pick-up truck\n![](image)An advertisement for the 1961 Ford H-Series truck\nFord has produced trucks since 1908, beginning with the Ford Model TT, followed by the Model AA, and the Model BB. Countries where Ford commercial vehicles are or were formerly produced include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada (also badged as Mercury), France, Germany, India, Netherlands, Philippines, Spain (badged Ebro too), Turkey, UK (badged also Fordson and Thames), and the United States.\n\n\nFrom the 1940s to the late 1970s, Ford's Ford F-Series was used as the base for light trucks for the North American market.\n\n\nMost of these ventures are now extinct. The European one that lasted longest was the lorries arm of Ford of Britain, which became part of the Iveco group in 1986. Ford had a minority share in the new company and Iveco took over sales and production of the Ford Cargo range.[158] Ford's last significant European truck models were the Transcontinental and the Cargo. At the end of 1996, Ford sold the rights to its heavy trucks division to the Freightliner Trucks division of Daimler AG, with Ford producing the Cargo, Louisville, and Aeromax, through the 1998 model year. During the 1998 model year, Freightliner began production of its own versions of Ford-developed trucks in St. Thomas, Ontario, launching the Sterling truck brand.[159][160] Slotted between Freightliner and Western Star, Sterling trucks were produced through 2009.\n\n\nLine of heavy trucks made by Ford for the North American market:\n\n\n\n* Ford F-Series\n\t+ \"Big Job\" (1951-1957)\n\t+ \"Super Duty/Extra Heavy Duty (1958-1962)\n* Ford N-Series (1963-1969)\n* Ford L-Series trucks (1970-1998)\n\t+ aka Ford \"Louisville Line\"\n\t+ Ford Aeromax (1988-1998)\n\t+ Ford Louisville (1996-1998)\n\t+ Sterling (1998-2009)\n* Ford C-Series (1957-1990)\n* Ford Cargo/CF-Series (1986-1997)\n* Ford H-Series (1961-1966)\n\t+ aka \"Two-story Falcon\"\n* Ford W-Series (1966-1977)\n* Ford CL-Series (1978-1995)\n\n\nFor 1999, Ford briefly withdrew from production of medium-duty trucks. For the 2001 model year, the company entered into a joint venture with Navistar International (the supplier of diesel engines for 1-ton F-Series trucks), named *Blue Diamond Truck Company LLC*.[161] As part of the joint venture, sharing a common truck chassis, the two companies would produce medium-duty (Class 6\u20137) trucks in a Navistar facility in Mexico, with each manufacturer supplying its own powertrain and bodywork, with the Ford F-650/F-750 Super Duty and International 4000/DuraStar sharing an assembly line. In 2006, the joint venture debuted the Ford LCF/International CityStar.[162] Using a modified F-Series chassis adopted to fit a Mazda Titan cab, the LCF was a low-cab forward truck that was sold through 2009.[163]\n\n\nIn Europe, Ford manufactures the Ford Transit jumbo van, which is classed as a Large Goods Vehicle and has a payload of up to 2,265\u00a0kg; there are options of a panel van, pickup or chassis cab. The Ford Transit is also available as a light van called the Ford Transit Connect and the Ford Ranger pickup is available.[164]\n\n\n\n### Buses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Ford B700 bus chassis, with a body by Thomas Built\nFord manufactured complete buses in the company's early history, but today the role of the company has changed to that of a second stage manufacturer. In North America, the E-Series is still used as a chassis for small school buses and the F-650 is used in commercial bus markets. In the 1980s and 1990s, the medium-duty B700 was a popular chassis used by school bus body manufacturers including Thomas Built, Ward, and Blue Bird, but Ford lost its market share due to industry contraction and agreements between body manufacturers. Older bus models included:\n\n\nPrior to 1936, Ford buses were based on truck bodies:\n\n\n\n* Model B \u2013 1930s\n* Model T \u2013 1920s\n* F-105 school bus\n\n\n![](image)A 1937 Ford Transit Bus in Seattle\nIn 1936, Ford introduced the Ford Transit Bus, a series of small transit buses with bodies built by a second party. Originally a front-engine design, it was modified to a rear-engine design in 1939. About 1,000 to 1,200 of the original design were built, and around 12,500 of the rear-engine design, which was in production until 1947[165] (rebranded as the Universal Bus in 1946).\n\n\nRear-engine Transit Bus chassis model numbers:[166]\n\n\n\n* 09-B/19-B City transit bus \u2013 1939\u20131941\n* 19-B/29-B City transit bus \u2013 1941\u20131942\n* 49-B/79-B City transit bus \u2013 1944\u20131947\n* 69-B City transit bus \u2013 1946\u20131947\n* 29-B City transit bus \u2013 1946\u20131947\n* 72-T transit bus \u2013 1944\u20131945\n\n\nAfter 1946 the Transit City bus was sold as the *Universal Bus* with the roof changed from fabric/wood to all-metal:\n\n\n\n* 79-B Universal transit bus \u2013 1946\u20131947\n\n\nSucceeding the Ford Transit Bus was the Ford 8M buses:\n\n\n\n* 8MB transit bus \u2013 with Wayne Works 1948\u2013?\n\n\nFollowing World War II and from the 1950s onwards, Ford lost out to General Motors.[166] This led to the end of transit buses for Ford in North America.\n\n\n\n* B500 or B-series \u2013 1950\u20131990s based on Ford F-series truck chassis used by school bus body manufacturers\n\n\nIn Europe, Ford manufactures the Ford Transit Minibus which is classed in Europe as a Passenger Carrying Vehicle and there are options of 12-, 15-, or 17-seaters.[167] In the past, European models included:\n\n\n\n* EM\n* N-138\n* D series buses (Australia)\n\n\n### Tractors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Ford N series tractor\nThe \"Henry Ford and Son Company\" began making Fordson tractors in Henry's hometown of Springwells (later part of Dearborn), Michigan, from 1907 to 1928, from 1919 to 1932, at Cork, Ireland, and between 1933 and 1964 at Dagenham, England, later transferred to Basildon. They were also produced in Leningrad beginning in 1924.\n\n\nFord reentered the tractor market in 1939 with the Ford N-series tractors. The Ford 8N, introduced in 1947, became the most popular tractor of all time in North America. Production of the N line of models ended in 1952.\n\n\nThe Ford NAA tractor was introduced as an entirely new model in 1953. It was a replacement for the Ford N-Series tractors. Larger than the 8N, with a four-cylinder engine, and streamlined styling.\n\n\nIn 1986, Ford expanded its tractor business when it purchased the Sperry-New Holland skid-steer loader and hay baler, hay tools and implement company from Sperry Corporation and formed Ford-New Holland which bought out Versatile tractors in 1988. This company was bought by Fiat in 1993 and the name changed from Ford New Holland to New Holland. New Holland is now part of CNH Global.\n\n\n\n### Financial services[edit]\n\n\nFord offers automotive finance through Ford Motor Credit Company.\n\n\n\n### Automotive components[edit]\n\n\nFord's *FoMoCo* parts division sells aftermarket parts under the Motorcraft brand name. It has spun off its parts division under the name Visteon.\n\n\n\n## FordWorks Program[edit]\n\n\nFord Motor Company created the FordWorks program in 2016[168][169] with the aim to bring people with disabilities back into the workforce.[170] It was the first automotive program to focus on bringing people with autism in the workforce in the US. They targeted people with autism[168][169] but have expanded their criteria to people with other disabilities.[170] Ford has partnered with Upbound to broaden their hiring under the FordWorks program.[170]\n\n\n\n## Marques[edit]\n\n\n### Current marques[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Marque\n | Estab.\n | Added | Markets\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Ford | 1903 | 1903 | Global\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Lincoln | 1917 | 1922 | North America, Middle East, China, South Korea\n |\n\n\n### Former marques[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Origin\n | Marque\n | Years | Markets\n | Fate\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Continental[171][172] | 1956\u20131986 | North America | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Edsel | 1957\u20131960 | North America | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Fordson | 1917\u20131964 | North America, Ireland, U.K. | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Mercury | 1939\u20132011 | North America, Middle East | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Merkur | 1985\u20131989 | North America | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0AUS | FPV | 2002\u20132014 | Australia | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0BRA | Troller | 2007\u20132021 | Brazil | Defunct company, plant closed by Ford Brasil |\n| ![](image)\u00a0JPN | Mazda | 1974\u20132015 | Global | Sold shares\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0SWE | Volvo | 1999\u20132010 | Global | Sold to Geely |\n| ![](image)\u00a0UK | Aston Martin | 1989\u20132007 | Global | Sold to a private consortium\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0UK | Jaguar | 1989\u20132008 | Global | Sold to Tata Motors |\n| ![](image)\u00a0UK | Land Rover | 2000\u20132008 | Global | Sold to Tata Motors |\n| ![](image)\u00a0ITA | De Tomaso | 1971\u20131974 | Global | Sold to Alejandro de Tomaso |\n| ![](image)\u00a0ITA | Moto Guzzi | 1973\u20131974 | Global | Sold to Alejandro de Tomaso |\n| ![](image)\u00a0ITA | Benelli | 1972\u20131974 | Global | Sold to Alejandro de Tomaso |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Meteor | 1949\u20131976 | Canada | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Monarch | 1946\u20131961 | Canada | Discontinued\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CAN | Frontenac | 1960 | Canada | Discontinued\n |\n\n\n## Motorsport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford Performance\n\n### FIA World Championships[edit]\n\n\nAlong with Shelby and Chevrolet, Ford is one of only three American constructors to win titles on the international scene at the FIA World Championships. As a constructor, Ford won the World Sportscar Championship three times in 1966 (both sports prototype category and Grand Touring (GT) category), 1967 (GT category), and 1968 (sports prototype category), and at the World Rally Championship Ford won 4 World Drivers' Championships (in 1979, 1981, 2017 and 2018) as well as 4 World Manufacturers' Championships (in 1979, 2006, 2007 and 2017). As an engine supplier, Ford also won 13 Formula One World Drivers' Championships and 10 Formula One World Constructors' Championships.\n\n\n\n### Open-wheel racing[edit]\n\n\n#### IndyCar[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Arie Luyendyk's record-setting Ford Cosworth-powered IndyCar from 1996\nIndyCars with Ford engines first competed in 1935 using a production-based Ford V8 in the Miller-Ford racer.[173][174] A pushrod Ford V8 raced with Lotus in 1963, and Ford's first Indy win was in 1965 with a DOHC V8.[175][176] Ford motors, including the Ford-sponsored DFX engine developed by Cosworth, have won the Indianapolis 500 eighteen times.[177] On May 12, 1996, Arie Luyendyk, while driving an IndyCar powered by a Ford Cosworth XB engine, broke the Indianapolis 500 records for fastest qualification lap (237.498\u00a0mph; 382.216\u00a0km/h) and fastest qualification four-lap average (236.986\u00a0mph; 381.392\u00a0km/h).[178][179] These speed records still stand as of 2022[update].[180]\n\n\n\n#### Formula Ford[edit]\n\n\nFormula Ford, conceived in the UK in 1966, is an entry-level type of formula racing with wingless single-seater cars. Many of today's formula racing drivers started their car racing careers in this category.\n\n\n\n#### Formula One[edit]\n\n\nFord was heavily involved in Formula One for many years and supplied engines to a large number of teams from 1967 until 2004. These engines were designed and manufactured by Cosworth, the racing division that was owned by Ford from 1998 to 2004. Ford-badged engines won 176 Grands Prix between 1967 and 2003 for teams such as Team Lotus and McLaren. Ford entered Formula One as a constructor in 2000 under the Jaguar Racing name, after buying the Stewart Grand Prix team which had been its primary 'works' team in the series since 1997. Jaguar achieved little success in Formula One, and after a turbulent five seasons, Ford withdrew from the category after the 2004 season, selling both Jaguar Racing (which became Red Bull Racing) and Cosworth (to Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven).[181]\n\n\nFord has announced that it will return to Formula One in 2026 following a partnership with Red Bull Powertrains, supplying power units to Red Bull Racing and Scuderia AlphaTauri.[182]\n\n\n\n### Stock car racing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ryan Blaney driving the No. 21 Wood Brothers Ford in 2016 at Michigan International Speedway\nFord is one of three manufacturers in NASCAR's three major series: the Cup Series, Xfinity Series, and Truck Series. Major teams include RFK Racing, Team Penske, Stewart-Haas Racing, and Wood Brothers Racing. Ford is represented by the Mustang GT in the Cup Series, and the Xfinity Series and by the F-150 in the Truck Series. Some of the most successful NASCAR Fords were the aerodynamic fastback Ford Torino, Ford Torino Talladega, Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II, and Mercury Montegos, and the aero-era Ford Thunderbirds. The Ford nameplate has won eight manufacturer's championships in Sprint Cup while Mercury has won one. In the Sprint Cup Series, Ford earned its 1,000th victory in the 2013 Quicken Loans 400.[183] The Ford Fusion is also used in the ARCA Racing Series. Ford had last won a drivers' championship in the Cup Series with Joey Logano in 2022.\n\n\n\n### Rally[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford World Rally Team\n\n![](image)Jari-Matti Latvala driving the Ford Focus RS WRC 09 in 2010\nFord has a long history in rallying and has been active in the World Rally Championship since the beginning of the world championship, the 1973 season. Ford took the 1979 manufacturers' title with Hannu Mikkola, Bj\u00f6rn Waldeg\u00e5rd, and Ari Vatanen driving the Ford Escort RS1800. In the Group B era, Ford achieved success with Ford RS200. Since the 1999 season, Ford has used various versions of the Ford Focus WRC to much success. In the 2006 season, BP-Ford World Rally Team secured Ford its second manufacturers' title, with the Focus RS WRC 06 built by M-Sport and driven by \"Flying Finns\" Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm and Mikko Hirvonen.[184] Continuing with Gr\u00f6nholm and Hirvonen, Ford successfully defended the manufacturers' world championship in the 2007 season. Ford is the only manufacturer to score in the points for 92 consecutive races; since the 2002 season opener Monte Carlo Rally.[185]\n\n\n\n### Rallycross[edit]\n\n\nFord has competed in rallycross with its Ford Fiesta and Ford Focus. Tanner Foust won the Global RallyCross Championship in 2011 and 2012 and was runner-up in the FIA European Rallycross Championship in 2011 and 2012. Toomas Heikkinen won the Global RallyCross Championship title in 2013 and Joni Wiman won it in 2014. Other notable Ford drivers include Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm, Ken Block, and Brian Deegan.\n\n\n\n### Sports cars[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford GT \u00a7\u00a0Racing\n\nFord sports cars have been visible in the world of sports car racing since 1964. Most notably the Ford GT40 won the 24 Hours of Le Mans four times (in 1966, 1967, 1968 and 1969) and is the only American car to ever win overall at this prestigious event. Ford also won four titles at the World Sportscar Championship with the GT40. Swiss team Matech GT Racing, in collaboration with Ford Racing, opened a new chapter with the Ford GT, winning the Teams title in the 2008 FIA GT3 European Championship.\n\n\n\n#### Ford Mustang[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ford Mustang \u00a7\u00a0Racing\n\n![](image)A GT racing version of the Ford Mustang, competing in the Koni Challenge in 2005\nThe Ford Mustang has arguably been Ford's most successful sports car. Jerry Titus won the 1965 SCCA Pro B National Championship with a Mustang and the model went on to earn Ford the SCCA Trans-Am Championship title in both 1966 and 1967. Ford won the Trans-Am Championship again in 1970 with Parnelli Jones and George Follmer driving Boss 302 Mustangs for Bud Moore Engineering. Ford took the 1985 and 1986 IMSA GTO Championship with Mustangs driven by John Jones and Scott Pruett before returning to Trans-Am glory with a championship in 1989 with Dorsey Schroeder. Ford dominated Trans-Am in the 1990s with Tommy Kendall winning championships in 1993, 1995, 1996, and 1997 with Paul Gentilozzi adding yet another title in 1999. In 2005 the Ford Mustang FR500C took the championship in the Rolex Koni Challenge Series in its first year on the circuit. In 2007, Ford added a victory in the GT4 European Championship. 2008 was the first year of the Mustang Challenge for the Miller Cup, a series that pits a full field of identical factory-built Ford Mustang race cars against each other. Also, in 2008, Ford won the manufacturers championship in the Koni Challenge Series and HyperSport drivers Joe Foster and Steve Maxwell won the drivers title in a Mustang GT.\n\n\nFord and Michelin teamed up to provide custom-engineered tires for the Ford Performance vehicle lineup. Ford Performance director Dave Pericak said: \"That confidence extends from our upcoming racing effort at Le Mans in 2016 with the all-new Ford GT, to the Ford Performance vehicle lineup, including the Shelby GT350 and F-150 Raptor\".[186]\n\n\n\n### Touring cars[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford Performance Racing Ford Falcon V8 Supercar at Eastern Creek in Australia in 2008\nFord has campaigned touring cars such as the Focus, Falcon, and Contour/Mondeo and the Sierra Cosworth in many different series throughout the years. Notably, Mondeo drivers finished 1, 2, and 3 in the 2000 British Touring Car Championship and Falcon drivers placed 1, 2, and 3 in the 2005 V8 Supercar Championship Series.\n\n\n\n### Drag racing[edit]\n\n\nIn drag racing, John Force Racing drivers John Force, Tony Pedregon, and Robert Hight have piloted Ford Mustang Funny Cars to several NHRA titles in recent seasons. Teammates Tim Wilkerson and Bob Tasca III also drive Mustangs in Funny Car.\n\n\n\n### Drifting[edit]\n\n\nFord has branched out into drifting with the introduction of the new model Mustang. Most noticeable is the Turquoise and Blue Falken Tires Mustang driven by Vaughn Gittin, Jr., (A.K.A. \"JR\") that produces 750 RWHP (Rear Wheel Horsepower).\n\n\n\n## Environmental initiatives[edit]\n\n\n### Compressed natural gas[edit]\n\n\nThe alternative fossil fuel vehicles, such as some versions of the Crown Victoria especially in fleet and taxi service, operate on compressed natural gas\u2014or CNG. Some CNG vehicles have dual fuel tanks\u2014one for gasoline, the other for CNG\u2014the same engine can operate on either fuel via a selector switch.\n\n\n\n### Flexible fuel vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Ford Focus Flexifuel was the first E85 flexible fuel vehicle commercially available in the European market.\nFlexible fuel vehicles are designed to operate smoothly using a wide range of available ethanol fuel mixtures\u2014from pure gasoline to bioethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) or E100 (neat hydrous ethanol) in Brazil. Part of the challenge of successful marketing alternative and flexible fuel vehicles in the U.S. is the general lack of establishment of sufficient fueling stations, which would be essential for these vehicles to be attractive to a wide range of consumers. Significant efforts to ramp up production and distribution of E85 fuels are underway and expanding.[187] Current Ford E100 Flex sold in the Brazilian market are the Courier, Ford EcoSport, Ford Fiesta, Ford Focus, and Ford Ka.\n\n\n\n### Electric drive vehicles[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(January 2021)*\n |\n\n\n#### Hybrid electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hybrid electric vehicle\n\n![](image)Ford Escape plug-in hybrid test vehicle\n![](image)Alan Mulally (wearing red tie) with then-President George W. Bush at the Kansas City Assembly plant in Claycomo, Missouri, on March 20, 2007, touting Ford's new hybrid cars\nIn 2004, Ford and Toyota agreed a patent-sharing accord that granted Ford access to certain hybrid technology patented by Toyota; in exchange, Ford licensed some of its own patents to Toyota.[188][189][190] In 2004, Ford introduced the Escape Hybrid. With this vehicle, Ford was third to the automotive market with a hybrid electric vehicle and the first hybrid electric SUV to market. This was also the first hybrid electric vehicle with a flexible fuel capability to run on E85.[191] The Escape's platform mate Mercury Mariner was also available with the hybrid-electric system in the 2006 model year\u2014a full year ahead of schedule. The similar Mazda Tribute will also receive a hybrid-electric powertrain option, along with many other vehicles in the Ford vehicle line.\n\n\nIn 2005, Ford announced a goal to make 250,000 hybrids a year by 2010, but by mid-2006 announced that it would not meet that goal, due to excessively high costs and the lack of sufficient supplies of the hybrid-electric batteries and drivetrain system components.[192] Instead, Ford has committed to accelerating development of next-generation hybrid-electric power plants in Britain, in collaboration with Volvo. This engineering study is expected to yield more than 100 new hybrid-electric vehicle models and derivatives.\n\n\nIn September 2007, Ford announced a partnership with Southern California Edison (SCE) to examine how plug-in hybrids will work with the electrical grid. Under the multimillion-dollar, multi-year project, Ford will convert a demonstration fleet of Ford Escape Hybrids into plug-in hybrids, and SCE will evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid. Some of the vehicles will be evaluated \"in typical customer settings\", according to Ford.[35][36]\n\n\nOn June 12, 2008, USDOE expanded its own fleet of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles with the addition of a Ford Escape Plug-In Hybrid Flex-Fuel Vehicle. The vehicle is equipped with a 10-kilowatt (13\u00a0hp) lithium-ion battery supplied by Johnson Controls-Saft that stores enough electric energy to drive up to 30 miles (48\u00a0km) at speeds of up to 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[193] In March 2009, Ford launched hybrid versions of the Ford Fusion Hybrid and the Mercury Milan Hybrid in the United States, both as 2010 models.[194]\n\n\nAs of November\u00a02014[update], Ford has produced for retail sales the following hybrid electric vehicles: Ford Escape Hybrid (2004\u20132012), Mercury Mariner Hybrid (2005\u20132010), Mercury Milan Hybrid (2009\u20132010), Ford Fusion Hybrid (2009\u2013present), Lincoln MKZ Hybrid (2010\u2013present), Ford C-Max Hybrid (2012\u2013present), and Ford Mondeo Hybrid (2014\u2013present). By June 2012, Ford had sold 200,000 full hybrids in the U.S. since 2004,[195] and, as of September\u00a02014[update], the carmaker has sold over 344,000 hybrids in the United States.[195][196][197][198] The top selling hybrids in the U.S. market are the Fusion Hybrid with 127,572 units, followed by Escape Hybrid with 117,997 units, and the C-Max Hybrid with 54,236.[196][197][198][199][200] As of November\u00a02014[update], Ford is the world's second-largest manufacturer of hybrids after Toyota Motor Corporation, with 400,000 hybrid electric vehicles produced since their introduction in 2004.[201]\n\n\n\n#### Plug-in electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Plug-in electric vehicle\n\nAs of October\u00a02014[update], Ford has produced the following plug-in electric vehicles: the all-electric Ford Ranger EV (1997\u20132002), Ford TH!NK (1999\u20132003), Transit Connect (2010\u20132012), and Ford Focus Electric (2011\u20132018); and the plug-in hybrids C-MAX Energi (2012\u20132017) and the Fusion Energi (2013\u20132020), sold under the Mondeo nameplate in Europe.[202][203] Since the launch of the Focus Electric in 2011, combined sales of all Ford plug-in electric models amounted to just over 56,000 through October 2015.[204]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Azure Transit Connect Electric was produced between 2010 and 2012 as a collaboration between Azure Dynamics and Ford Motor Company.\nBill Ford was one of the first top industry executives to make regular use of a battery electric vehicle, a Ford Ranger EV, while the company contracted with the United States Postal Service to deliver electric postal vans based on the Ranger EV platform. Ford discontinued a line of electric Ranger pickup trucks and ordered them destroyed, though it reversed in January 2005, after environmentalist protest.[205] The all-electric pickup truck leased 205 units to individuals and 1,500 units to fleets in the U.S. from 1998 to 2002.[206][207]\n\n\nFrom 2009 to 2011, Ford offered the Ford TH!NK car. Ford ended production and ordered all the cars repossessed and destroyed, even as many of the people leasing them begged to be able to buy the cars from Ford. After an outcry from the lessees and activists in the U.S. and Norway, Ford returned the cars to Norway for sale.[208] Four hundred and forty units were leased in the U.S. from 1999 until 2003.[207]\n\n\nIn 2017, Ford CEO Mark Fields announced that the company would invest $4.5 billion in further development of plug-in electric vehicles by 2020.[209]\n\n\nThe Azure Transit Connect Electric was an all-electric van developed as a collaboration between Azure Dynamics and Ford Motor Company, but Azure was the official manufacturer of record.[210] The Transit Connect Electric had an official U.S. Environmental Protection Agency all-electric range of 56\u00a0mi (90\u00a0km).[211] The EPA rated the combined city/highway fuel economy at 62 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (3.8\u00a0L/100\u00a0km equivalent).[211] Deliveries for fleet customers in the U.S. and Canada began in December 2010.[212] Production of the electric van was stopped in March 2012 as a result of Azure's bankruptcy protection filing. Ford continues to provide servicing.[213] Around 500 units were sold before Azure stopped production.[214]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Ford Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid shares its powertrain with the Ford C-Max Energi.\nThe Ford Focus Electric is based on the next generation Focus internal combustion vehicle, converted to an all-electric propulsion system as a production electric car by Magna International, and retail sales began in the U.S. in December 2011.[215][216] The Focus Electric has an EPA rated range of 76\u00a0mi (122\u00a0km) and a combined city/highway fuel economy of 105 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (2.2\u00a0L/100\u00a0km).[217] Available also in Canada and several European countries, 3,965 units have been sold in the U.S. through September 2014.[196][197][198][218]\n\n\nThe Ford C-Max Energi is a plug-in hybrid released in the U.S. in October 2012. The C-Max Energi has an EPA rated all-electric range of 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) and a combined city/highway fuel economy in all-electric mode at 88 MPG-e (2.7\u00a0L/100\u00a0km).[219] U.S. sales totaled 33,509 units through December 2016.[196][197][220][221][222] Deliveries of the Ford Fusion Energi began in the United States in February 2013.[223][224] The Fusion Energi has an all-electric range of 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) and an equivalent fuel economy EPA rating of 88 MPG-e (2.7\u00a0L/100\u00a0km).[219] As of December\u00a02016[update], a total of 43,327 units have been delivered in the U.S. since its inception.[197][220][221][222]\n\n\nBoth Energi models share the same powertrain technology and have the same EPA combined city/highway fuel economy in hybrid operation of 38\u00a0mpg\u2011US (6.2\u00a0L/100\u00a0km; 46\u00a0mpg\u2011imp).[219]\nWhen asked about a battery-electric vehicle with a 200-mile (320\u00a0km) range, Fields said in April 2016 \"Clearly that's something we're developing for\". Ford has a pending trademark application on the \"Model E\" name,[225] preventing the Tesla Model 3 in using the name.[226]\n\n\nIn October 2017, Ford announced its Team Edison battery-electric vehicle group to lead the company's renewed efforts into the EV market, in which it currently offers only the Focus subcompact and has plans for a small 300-mile SUV by 2020.[227] The new team will be headquartered in Detroit and have offices in Europe and Asia.[228]\n\n\nIn 2022, Ford began manufacturing its E-Transit electric cargo vans at its plant in Kansas City, Missouri.[229]\n\n\n\n![a photograph showing the front-left quarter of a grey automobile](image)Ford Mustang Mach-E\n### Hydrogen[edit]\n\n\nFord also continues to study fuel cell-powered electric powertrains and has demonstrated hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. Compared with conventional vehicles, hybrid vehicles and/or fuel cell vehicles decrease air pollution emissions as well as sound levels, with favorable impacts upon respiratory health and decrease of noise health effects.\n\n\nFord has launched the production of hydrogen-powered shuttle buses, using hydrogen instead of gasoline in a standard internal combustion engine, for use at airports and convention centers.[230] At the 2006 Greater Los Angeles Auto Show, Ford showcased a hydrogen fuel cell version of its Explorer SUV. The Fuel cell Explorer has a combined output of 174\u00a0hp (130\u00a0kW). It has a large hydrogen storage tank which is situated in the center of the car taking the original place of the conventional model's automatic transmission. The centered position of the tank assists the vehicle reach a notable range of 350 miles (563\u00a0km), the farthest for a fuel cell vehicle so far. The fuel cell Explorer the first in a series of prototypes partly funded by the United States Department of Energy to expand efforts to determine the feasibility of hydrogen-powered vehicles. The fuel cell Explorer is one of several vehicles with green technology being featured at the L.A. show, including the 2008 Ford Escape Hybrid, PZEV emissions compliant Fusion and Focus models and a 2008 Ford F-Series Super Duty outfitted with Ford's clean diesel technology.\n\n\n\n### Increased fuel efficiency[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2008, Ford Motor Company announced that it would accelerate its plans to produce more fuel-efficient cars, changing both its North American manufacturing plans and its lineup of vehicles available in the United States. In terms of North American manufacturing, the company planned to convert three existing truck and sport utility vehicle (SUV) plants for small car production, with the first conversion at its Michigan Truck Plant. In addition, Ford's assembly plants near Mexico City, Mexico, and in Louisville, Kentucky, were to be converted from pickups and SUVs to small cars, including the Ford Fiesta, by 2011. Ford then also planned to introduce to North America six of its European small vehicles, including two versions of the Ford Fiesta, by the end of 2012.[231]\n\n\nFord of Europe developed the ECOnetic programme to address the market and legislative need for higher fuel efficiency and lower CO2 emissions. As opposed to the hybrid engine technology used in competitor products such as the Toyota Prius, ECOnetic improves existing technology. Using lower-consuming Duratorq TDCi diesel engines, and based on a combination of improved aerodynamics, lower resistance, and improved efficiency, the Ford Fiesta was the lowest-emitting mass-produced car in Europe[232] while the 2012 Ford Focus ECOnetic will have better fuel consumption than the Prius or the Volkswagen Golf BlueMotion.[233] ECOnetic is not presently planned to be sold in North American due to current perceived lower consumer demand.[234]\n\n\nFord has challenged University teams to create a vehicle that is simple, durable, lightweight, and comes equipped with a base target price of only $7,000. The students from Aachen University created the \"2015 Ford Model T\".[235][236]\n\n\nIn 2000, under the leadership of the current Ford chairman, William Clay Ford, the company announced[237] a planned 25 percent improvement in the average mileage of its SUVs\u2014to be completed by the 2005 calendar year. In 2003, Ford announced that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent the company from achieving this goal.[238]\n\n\nFor the 2007 model year, Ford had thirteen U.S. models that achieve 30 miles per gallon or better (based on the highway fuel economy estimates of the EPA) and several of Ford's vehicles were recognized in the EPA and Department of Energy Fuel Economy Guide for best-in-class fuel economy. Ford claimed to have eliminated nearly three million pounds of smog-forming emissions from their U.S. cars and light trucks over the 2004 to 2006 model years.[239] However, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has linked Ford to 54 Superfund toxic waste sites, twelve of which have been cleaned up and deleted from the list.[240]\n\n\n\n### Efficient buildings[edit]\n\n\nAs part of a renovation of the Ford River Rouge Complex, in 2010 Ford unveiled a 10.4-acre (42,000\u00a0m2) living roof covering part of the Dearborn Truck plant, consisting of sedum, a low-growing groundcover. The sedum retains and cleanses rainwater and moderates the internal temperature of the building, saving energy.[241]\n\n\nIn 2016, Ford announced a ten-year renovation plan for its Dearborn campus.[242] The plan features consolidation of office and lab spaces in to fewer and much larger buildings, which will be built to LEED standards, and will feature extensive use of wetlands and park spaces.[243][244] The new campus features new multi-story parking decks with solar power-generating roofs,[245] and a new natural gas power plant. The DTE Ford Central Energy Plant is a 34MW combined heat-and-power plant which features a high efficiency design and LEED Gold buildings.[246]\n\n\n\n## Sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nFord sponsors numerous events and sports facilities around the U.S., most notably the Ford Center in downtown Evansville, Indiana, and Ford Field in downtown Detroit.[247]\n\n\nThe company has also been a major sponsor of the UEFA Champions League for over two decades, and is also a longtime sponsor of the Sky media channel's coverage of Premier League football.\n\n\nBetween 1994 and 1999, Ford was the main kit sponsor of German Bundesliga club 1. FC K\u00f6ln.\n\n\n\n## Sales numbers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Calendar Year\n | US sales\n | Market share\nof US sales[248]\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1997\n | 3,877,458[249] | 25.0%\n |\n| 1998\n | 3,922,604[250] | 24.5%\n |\n| 1999\n | 4,163,369[251] | 23.9%\n |\n| 2000\n | 4,202,820\n | 23.6%\n |\n| 2001\n | 3,971,364\n | 22.7%\n |\n| 2002\n | 3,623,709[252] | 21.2%\n |\n| 2003\n | 3,483,719\n | 20.5%\n |\n| 2004\n | 3,331,676[253] | 19.3%\n |\n| 2005\n | 3,153,875\n | 18.1%\n |\n| 2006\n | 2,901,090[254] | 17.0%\n |\n| 2007\n | 2,507,366\n | 15.2%\n |\n| 2008\n | 1,988,376[255] | 14.7%\n |\n| 2009\n | 1,620,888[256] | 15.3%\n |\n| 2010\n | 1,935,462[257] | 16.4%\n |\n| 2011\n | 2,143,101[258] | 16.4%\n |\n| 2012\n | 2,250,165[259] | 15.2%\n |\n| 2013\n | 2,493,918[260] | 15.7%\n |\n| 2014\n | 2,480,942[261] | 14.7%\n |\n| 2015\n | 2,613,162[262] | 14.6%\n |\n| 2016\n | 2,614,697[263][264] | 14.6%\n |\n| 2017\n | 2,586,715[265] | 14.7%\n |\n| 2018\n | 2,497,318[265] | 14.1%\n |\n| 2019\n | 2,422,698[266] | 13.8%\n |\n| 2020\n | 2,044,744[267] | 13.7%\n |\n| 2021\n | 1,905,955[268] | 12.4%\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Cars portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![flag](image)Michigan portal\n\n\n* Ford's Garage\n* Bridj\n* Chariot (company)\n* Detroit Automobile Company\n* Dodge v.

Currently, the company owns 33.88 percent of Kia Corporation,[5] and also fully owns two marques including its luxury cars subsidiary, Genesis, and an electric vehicle sub-brand, Ioniq.[6][7][8] Those three brands altogether comprise the Hyundai Motor Group.\n\n\nHyundai operates the world's largest integrated automobile manufacturing facility in Ulsan, South Korea which has an annual production capacity of 1.6\u00a0million units.[9] The company employs about 75,000 people worldwide. Hyundai vehicles are sold in 193 countries through 5,000 dealerships and showrooms.[10] As of 2022, Hyundai is the world's third-largest carmaker in terms of production, behind Toyota and Volkswagen.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1982 Hyundai Pony\nChung Ju-yung (1915\u20132001) founded the Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company in 1947. Hyundai Motor Company was later established in 1967, and the company's first model, the Cortina, was released in cooperation with Ford Motor Company in 1968.[12] When Hyundai wanted to develop their own car, they hired George Turnbull in February 1974, the former managing director of Austin Morris at British Leyland. He in turn hired five other top British car engineers. They were body designer Kenneth Barnett, engineers John Simpson and Edward Chapman, John Crosthwaite, formerly of BRM, as chassis engineer and Peter Slater as chief development engineer.[13][14][15][16] In 1975, the Pony, the first South Korean car, was released, with styling by Giorgio Giugiaro of Italdesign and powertrain technology provided by Japan's Mitsubishi Motors. Exports began in the following year to Ecuador and soon thereafter to the Benelux countries. Hyundai entered the British market in 1982, selling 2993 cars in their first year there.[17]\n\n\nIn 1984, Hyundai began exporting the Pony to Canada, but not to the United States, as the Pony would not pass emissions standards there. Canadian sales greatly exceeded expectations, and it was at one point the top-selling car on the Canadian market. In 1985, the one millionth Hyundai car was built.[18] Until the 1986 introduction of the larger Hyundai Grandeur, Hyundai offered a locally assembled Ford Granada for the South Korean executive market. The import of these knocked down kits was permitted as long as Hyundai exported five cars for every single Granada brought in (the same demands were placed on Kia).[19]\n\n\nIn 1986, Hyundai began to sell cars in the United States, and the Excel was nominated as \"Best Product #10\" by *Fortune* magazine, largely because of its affordability. The company began to produce models with its own technology in 1988, beginning with the midsize Sonata. In the spring of 1990, aggregate production of Hyundai automobiles reached the four million mark.[18] In 1991, the company succeeded in developing its first proprietary gasoline engine, the four-cylinder Alpha, and also its own transmission, thus paving the way for technological independence.\n\n\nIn 1996, Hyundai Motor India Limited was established with a production plant in Irungattukottai near Chennai, India.[20]\n\n\nIn 1998, Hyundai began to overhaul its image in an attempt to establish itself as a world-class brand. Chung Ju-yung transferred leadership of Hyundai Motor to his son, Chung Mong-koo, in 1999.[21] Hyundai's parent company, Hyundai Motor Group, invested heavily in the quality, design, manufacturing, and long-term research of its vehicles. It added a 10-year or 100,000-mile (160,000\u00a0km) warranty to cars sold in the United States and launched an aggressive marketing campaign.\n\n\nIn 2004, Hyundai was ranked second in \"initial quality\" in a survey/study by J.D. Power and Associates in North America.[22][23] Hyundai is now one of the top 100 most valuable brands worldwide according to Interbrand.[24] Since 2002, Hyundai has also been one of the worldwide official sponsors of the FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nIn 2006, the South Korean government initiated an investigation of Chung Mong-koo's practices as head of Hyundai, suspecting him of corruption. On 28 April 2006, Chung was arrested, and charged for embezzlement of 100\u00a0billion South Korean won (US$106\u00a0million).[25] As a result, Hyundai vice chairman and CEO, Kim Dong-jin, replaced him as head of the company.\n\n\nOn 30 September 2011, Yang Seung-suk announced his retirement as CEO of Hyundai Motor Co. In the interim replacement period, Chung Mong-koo and Kim Eok-jo divided the duties of the CEO position.[26]\n\n\nIn 2014, Hyundai started an initiative to focus on improving vehicle dynamics in its vehicles and hired Albert Biermann, former Vice President of Engineering at BMW M, to direct chassis development for Hyundai vehicles, stating: \"The company intends to become a technical leader in ride and handling, producing vehicles that lead their respective segments for driver engagement.\"[27]\n\n\nOn 14 October 2020, Euisun Chung was inaugurated as the new chairman of the Hyundai Motor Group. His father, Chung Mong-koo, has been made Honorary Chairman.[28]\n\n\nIn April 2021, the company said that its profits rose by 187%, the highest rise in four years. The company recorded a profit of $1.16 billion from the beginning of 2021 until March.[29]\n\n\n\n### Research and development[edit]\n\n\nHyundai has six research and development centers, located in South Korea (three offices), Germany, Japan and India. Additionally, a center in California develops designs for the United States.[30]\n\n\nHyundai established the Hyundai Design Center in Fountain Valley, California in 1990. The center moved to a new $30\u00a0million facility in Irvine, California in 2003, and was renamed the Hyundai Kia Motors Design and Technical Center. The facility also housed Hyundai America Technical Center, Inc, a subsidiary responsible for all engineering activities in the U.S. for Hyundai. Hyundai America Technical Center moved to its new 200,000-square-foot (19,000\u00a0m2), $117\u00a0million headquarters in Superior Township, Michigan (near Ann Arbor) in 2005.[31]\n\n\nIn 2004, Hyundai America Technical Center completed construction of its Hyundai/Kia proving ground in California City, California. The 4,300-acre (17\u00a0km2) facility is located in the Mojave Desert and features a 6.4-mile (10.3\u00a0km) oval track,[9] a Vehicle Dynamics Area, a vehicle-handling course inside the oval track, a paved hill road, and several special surface roads. A 30,000-square-foot (2,800\u00a0m2) complex featuring offices and indoor testing areas is located on the premises as well. The facility was built at a cost of $50\u00a0million.\n\n\nIn the 2021 review of WIPO's annual World Intellectual Property Indicators Hyundai ranked as 4th in the world for its 141 industrial design registrations being published under the Hague System during 2020.[32] This position is up on their previous 7th-place ranking for 57 industrial design registrations being published in 2019.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Business[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hyundai Motor Group\n\n![](image)The world's largest automobile manufacturing plant in Ulsan, South Korea, produces over 1.6\u00a0million vehicles annually.In 1998, after a shake-up in the South Korean auto industry caused by overambitious expansion and the Asian financial crisis, Hyundai acquired the majority of rival Kia Motors.[35]\n\n\nIn 2000, the company established a strategic alliance with DaimlerChrysler and severed its partnership with the Hyundai Group. In 2001, the Daimler-Hyundai Truck Corporation was formed. In 2004, however, DaimlerChrysler divested its interest in the company by selling its 10.5% stake for $900\u00a0million.\n\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai Motor America headquarters in Fountain Valley, California\nHyundai has invested in manufacturing plants in North America, India, the Czech Republic, Russia, China and Turkey as well as research and development centers in Europe, Asia, North America and the Pacific Rim. In 2004, Hyundai Motor Company had $57.2\u00a0billion in sales in South Korea making it the country's second largest corporation, or chaebol, after Samsung. Worldwide sales in 2005 reached 2,533,695 units, an 11 percent increase over the previous year. In 2011, Hyundai sold 4.05 million cars worldwide and the Hyundai Motor Group was the world's fourth largest automaker behind GM, Volkswagen and Toyota.[36][37] Hyundai vehicles are sold in 193 countries through some 5,000 dealerships.\n\n\nIn February 2021, CNBC reported that Apple and Hyundai-Kia are close to finalizing a deal to build an autonomous Apple car. The vehicle was said to be completely designed by Apple and would be built in Hyundai or Kia plants, and could potentially go into production in 2024.[38] However, Hyundai Motor announced shortly after that it is no longer in talks with Apple.[39][40]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Hyundai Motor Group completed its acquisition of a controlling interest in the robotics firm, Boston Dynamics. Hyundai Motor Group now takes an 80% share of the company.[41]\n\n\n\n## Board of directors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai Motor Group chairman Chung Mong Koo (right) sitting next to South Korean president Park Geun-hye in 2013\n* Chung Eui-sun, Executive Chairman of Hyundai Motors\n* Chang Jae-hoon, President and CEO of Hyundai Motors\n* Lee Dong-seock, Vice President\n* Jose Munoz, Global COO\n* Gang Hyun-seo, Executive Vice President\n* Yoon Chi-won, Former Chairman of EQONEX\n* Eugene M.

B\u00fcrkle had previously worked for BMW, having designed the BMW 3 Series (E46), and the BMW 6 Series (E63).[42][43] Hyundai's current design philosophy is known as *Fluidic Sculpture*,[44] which is heavily inspired by nature.[45]\n\n\nIn 2018, the company announced the *Sensuous Sportiness* next-generation design direction. The design philosophy was unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show demonstrated by the Le Fil Rouge concept car, and has been rolled out into their recent models, ranging from sedans to SUVs.[46] The *Sensuous Sportiness* design identity and strategy has won Design Management Institute's (DMI) Design Value Award 2020.[47]\n\n\n\n## Regional operations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Hyundai Motor Company manufacturing facilities\n\n\n\n| Top 8 Hyundai and Genesis vehicleproduction by country, 2021[48] |\n| --- |\n| Rank\n | Country\n | Vehicleproduction\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | 1,646,888\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0India | 635,413\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0China | 360,565\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 288,967\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image)\u00a0Czech Republic | 275,620\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 235,157\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 188,349\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image)\u00a0Turkey | 161,500\n |\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hyundai Motor America\n\n![](image)Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nHyundai Motor America began selling cars in the United States on 20 February 1986, with a single model, the Hyundai Excel. That year, Hyundai set a record of selling the most automobiles in its first year of business in the United States compared to any other car brand; total sales in 1986 were 168,882.[49]\n\n\nInitially well received, the Excel's faults soon became apparent; cost-cutting measures caused reliability to suffer. With an increasingly poor reputation for quality, Hyundai sales plummeted, and many dealerships either earned their profits on repairs or abandoned the product. At one point, Hyundai became the butt of many jokes (i.e. Hyundai stands for \"Hope you understand nothing's driveable and inexpensive\").[50]\n\n\nIn response, Hyundai began investing heavily in the quality, design, manufacturing, and long-term research of its vehicles. The company added free maintenance for the first 2 years or 24,000 miles for all its new cars sold, starting with the 1992 model year. It also added a 10-year or 100,000-mile (160,000\u00a0km) powertrain warranty (known as the Hyundai Advantage) to its vehicles sold in the United States, it is now known as the America Best Warranty.[51]\n\n\nHyundai incorporated a new manufacturing facility, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, in April 2002. The new plant in Montgomery, Alabama, was completed during 2004, at a cost of $1.7\u00a0billion. Production started in May 2005. It employed more than 3,000 workers in 2012.[52]\n\n\nBy 2004, sales had dramatically increased, and the reputation of Hyundai cars improved. In 2004, Hyundai tied with Honda for initial brand quality in a survey/study from J.D. Power and Associates, for having 102 problems per 1000 vehicles. This made Hyundai second in the industry, only behind Toyota, for initial vehicle quality. The company continued this tradition by placing third overall in J.D. Power's 2006 Initial Quality Survey, behind only Porsche and Lexus.[53]\n\n\nIn 2009, the Hyundai Genesis luxury sedan was named 2009 North American Car of the Year, the first for Hyundai.[54] The model has received a number of well-recognized automobile awards worldwide. It also won the 2009 Canadian Car of the Year after winning its category of Best New Luxury Car under $50,000.[55] The Hyundai's V8 Tau engine in the Genesis received 2009 Ward's 10 Best Engines award.[56]\n\n\nIn January 2012, the Hyundai Elantra was named the North American Car of the Year at the North American International Auto Show, selling more than 200,000 cars since the model's redesigned debut.[57]\n\n\nAn urban air mobility (UAM) subsidiary called *Supernal* was established in 2020.[58][59] The name means 'Best Quality' and 'Heavenly'.[60] On November 8, 2023, Hyundai announced that a new plant will be built in the United States to produce flying taxis for commuters. They are targeting a test flight as early as December 2024. [61]\n\n\n\n#### Canada[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai Auto Canada office in Markham\nThe second-generation Hyundai Pony was available for sale in Canada starting with the 1984 model year. The Canadian Pony differed from its European counterparts by having 8\u00a0km/h bumpers, sealed-beam headlights, side marker lamps, and slightly different instrumentation and interior trim. Sales projections for 1984 called for 5,000 Ponys, but actual sales were closer to 25,000, making the Pony one of Canada's best-selling cars that year. A lesser-known model, also sold in Canada, was the Hyundai Stellar. Both models were available until 1987, when they were replaced by the Excel.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1989, **Hyundai Auto Canada Inc.** opened a stamping and assembly plant in Bromont, Quebec, employing 800. The plant cost $387.7\u00a0million, with Quebec and Canadian federal government subsidies of $131\u00a0million.[62] The plant was designed to manufacture approximately 2000 Hyundai Sonatas per week.[62] Subsequently, Chrysler and Hyundai considered a joint venture that would have Chrysler rebranding the Sonata manufactured at Bromont \u2013 only to later announce the deal had failed.[63] The Bromont plant was operational for four years before it closed \u2013 with Hyundai's sales unable to support the plant. With boost in sales in 2009, Hyundai Auto Canada Inc. is currently planning to build a new plant in Canada and resume production in Canada.[64] Hyundai subsequently sold the plant,[64] which was eventually purchased by Olymbec inc, a Quebec real estate developer. Hyundai is the No. 1 import car brand in Canada without a local plant. Sales over 100,000 cars-per-year mark in 2012.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Mexico[edit]\n\n\nHyundai Motor M\u00e9xico entered the Mexican market in 2014 with the imported vehicles such as Grand i10, the Elantra, and the ix35.[66] Soon afterwards, the Hyundai Sonata joined the lineup. Prior to the introduction of the Hyundai brand for non-commercial vehicles, Hyundai passenger vehicles, light-duty cargo vans, and passenger vans were distributed by Chrysler de M\u00e9xico, branded as Dodge.[67][68]\n\n\n\n### South America[edit]\n\n\n#### Brazil[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hyundai Motor Brasil\n\n![](image)Hyundai HB20, the first model exclusively introduced for the Brazilian market. 'HB' in HB20 stands for Hyundai Brasil.[69]\nIn October 2012, Hyundai launched a new small bi-fuel car, the HB20, designed specifically for the Brazilian mass-market. The car was developed under the \"Projeto HB\" (Hyundai Brazil) project, and is built at a new Hyundai factory in Brazil, located in Piracicaba, S\u00e3o Paulo.[70] The plant is the first wholly owned Hyundai plant in Latin America. With an investment of around R$1.2 billion, the plant has the capacity to produce 180,000 cars per year under three shifts.\n\n\nHyundai vehicles have also been produced in Brazil by local partner, Caoa Group at a plant located in An\u00e1polis, Goi\u00e1s. Production here started with the HR model in 2007, and continued with the Tucson in 2010, the HD78 truck in 2011, and the ix35 in 2013.[71]\n\n\n\n### Asia[edit]\n\n\n#### China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Unit sales and year-on-year rate in China. From March 2017, unit sales plummeted in retaliation for the installation of THAAD.\nHyundai cars, including those made by Hyundai's affiliate, Kia Motors, sold well in China until 2016, when sales fell by half, marking the start of a slump that continued into 2019, when the company announced plans to cut jobs in the region.[72]\n\n\nHyundai is currently working with its Chinese partner Beijing Automobile Industry Holding Co. to develop an electric car for sale only in China.[73][74] In September 2011, it was announced that Korean actor Lee Min-ho, who has enjoyed popularity in China, would promote Hyundai's new 'Veloster' in China.[75]\n\n\nHyundai and its sister company, Kia, were reported to have lost market share from 2017 because of their over-reliance on sedans, poor brand images and local Chinese automakers compete with price-competitive SUVs.[76]\n\n\n\n##### Beijing Hyundai[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Beijing Hyundai\n\nHyundai formed a 50-50 joint venture with Beijing Automotive Group since 2002 to produce cars in China.[77] The joint venture is called Beijing Hyundai, which also manufactures several models which are exclusive to the Chinese market.[78] It began operations in China by producing Sonata in December 2002.[79]\nThe joint venture sold 700,000 passenger cars in 2010, 855,995 car sales in 2012, and 2014 saw the company sell 1,120,000 vehicles.[80][81][82] Currently, the company operates five plants, three which is located in Beijing, one in Hubei, and another in Chongqing.[83]\n\n\n\n##### Hawtai partnership[edit]\n\n\nBetween 2002 and 2010,[84][85] Hawtai Motor had produced Chinese-market versions of the Hyundai Matrix,[86] the Hyundai Santa Fe[84][87] and the Hyundai Terracan.[84][87] The Santa Fe was the fifth most-purchased SUV in China in 2010,[88] and some of Hawtai's versions may greatly differ from those sold in other markets.[89] Hyundai ended its partnership with Hawtai in 2010.[90]\n\n\n\n##### Commercial vehicles[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2010, Hyundai signed an agreement with Sichuan Nanjun Automobile on setting up a commercial vehicle joint venture\u2014Sichuan Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd.[74]\n\n\n\n#### India[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hyundai Motor India\n\n![](image)Hyundai's manufacturing plant at Irungattukottai near Chennai, India\nHyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) was formed on 6 May 1996. During the entry of Hyundai in 1996, fellow South Korean Daewoo had entered the Indian automobile market just three years before, while Ford, Opel and Honda had entered less than a year back. Hyundai's first car in the country, the Hyundai Santro was launched on 23 September 1998 and was considered a success. It became the second best-selling car in the country from 2000.[91]\n\n\nHyundai Motor India Limited is currently the second largest auto exporter from India.[92][93] It is making India the global manufacturing base for small cars.[94]\n\n\nHyundai has two manufacturing plants in India located at Sriperumbudur in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Both plants have a combined annual capacity of 600,000 units. In the year 2007, Hyundai opened its R&D facility in Hyderabad, employing now nearly 450 engineers from different parts of the country. Hyundai Motor India Engineering (HMIE) gives technical & engineering support in vehicle development to Hyundai's main R&D centre in Namyang, Korea.\n\n\n\n![](image)A stamp released to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Hyundai in India\nIn 2007, Hyundai started its support engineering centre with CAD/CAE teams in Hyderabad, India. Hyundai expanded its engineering activities in India with Vehicle Engineering team in 2010. In 2011, Hyundai started its design activities at Hyderabad R&D Centre with Styling, Digital Design & Skin CAD Teams and Packaging team. Indian engineers are heavily involved in the making of Indian-oriented Hyundai vehicles including the i10, i20, along with other global cars.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn June 2017, The Competition Commission of India imposed \u20b987 crore ($13.6 million) penalty for unfair business practices with respect to providing discounts for cars.[95]\n\n\n\n#### Japan[edit]\n\n\nHyundai Motors restarted passenger vehicle sales in Japan in 2022, after leaving the market in 2009. Since the relaunch, only electric cars are available, and the sales are online-only.\n\n\nDespite having growing sales worldwide, Hyundai struggled in Japan, having sold only 15,095 passenger cars from 2001 to 2009.[96][97] Following an announcement in November 2009, Hyundai pulled their passenger car division out of the Japanese market and focused on their commercial vehicle division instead.[96][97] The company said that it is possible for them to come back to Japan fully if market conditions continue to improve.[98]\n\n\nAccording to the newspaper *The Chosun Ilbo*, the reason for Hyundai's failure in the car market was due to the company's inability to recognize the value of small cars due to parking spaces. For instance, actor Bae Yong-joon was hired to endorse the mid-sized Sonata in Japan to appeal to housewives who watched the drama *Winter Sonata*. The marketing campaign backfired, as large sedans are driven primarily by middle-aged men, while housewives prefer compact cars.[*citation needed*] In addition, the Sonata was priced too similarly to its Japanese rivals, which resulted in poor sales.[99]\n\n\nOn February 9, 2022, Hyundai announced a comeback to Japan by marketing eco-friendly vehicles like the Ioniq 5 and Nexo with pre-orders from May 2022 for delivery beginning in July 2022 under the company name *Hyundai Mobility Japan*.[100] As of 2022, Hyundai Mobility Japan operates an office and R&D center in Yokohoma.[101]\n\n\n\n#### Philippines[edit]\n\n\nHyundai first entered the Philippine market with the Hyundai Excel compact car and the Hyundai Grace van in the early 1990s, later introducing the Hyundai Starex and the second generation Hyundai Elantra towards the end of the decade. Their assembly plant in Santa Rosa, Laguna produced the Hyundai Accent, Hyundai H100, and the Hyundai H350.[102] As of June 2022[update], there are 39 dealerships around the country but it will be expected to increase to 44 by the end of the year.[103] HARI currently focuses on Jeepneys, Trucks and Buses, while HMPH focuses on Cars, SUVs and Passenger Vans.\n\n\n**Hyundai Asia Resources, Inc. (HARI)** was the distributor of Hyundai passenger cars and currently the official distributor of Hyundai commercial vehicles in the country.[104] They were appointed by Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea in August 2001 as the official distributor of Hyundai vehicles in the Philippines. It had earned its spot as the third top player in the Philippine automotive industry. But due to the outrage of COVID-19 pandemic, they decided to abandon the passenger car market which resulted to their sales decline and the numerous of controversies surrounds them even before the pandemic. HARI has expected sales to be further boosted by its Hyundai Modern Jeepneys with the implementation of the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program. HARI targets to sell more modern jeepneys as the government pushes for the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program to replace the country's aging jeepneys.\n\n\nIn early 2022, **Hyundai Motor Philippines, Inc.

This model was produced in several plants, including in South Korea, United States, China, among others. Another popular sedan model is the Accent/Verna, which is popular in emerging markets including China, India, Middle East, as well as developed markets like North America. This model ceased to be produced in South Korea in 2019, as its production base were moved to Mexico and India.[134]\n\n\nOther sedan models are the mid-size Sonata, executive Grandeur, and several China-oriented models which consist of Reina, Celesta, Lafesta, and Mistra.\n\n\nSome hatchback models developed by Hyundai have been divided into models developed to cater to the Indian market and the European market. Both the i10 and i20 are models built in India and Europe, with several changes between the Indian and European versions to ensure the model could fit according to each market. Other hatchback models include the entry-level Santro first introduced in 1998 for the Indian market, i30 C-segment car for developed markets, the HB20 for the Brazilian market, and the hatchback version of Accent for markets outside India and Europe.\n\n\n\n### Crossovers/SUVs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Tucson is currently the best-selling Hyundai vehicle.\nHyundai entered the crossover SUV market early with the Santa Fe in 2000, followed by the smaller Tucson in 2004. The Santa Fe was a huge hit with American and European markets, despite receiving criticism in the past for Hyundai's obscure looks. It quickly became Hyundai's best seller and was one of the reasons Hyundai survived despite having their sales declined.[135] As of 2020, Hyundai has sold more than 5,260,000 units of Santa Fe globally.[136]\n\n\nThe first-generation Tucson shared its Elantra-based platform with the Kia Sportage. In most countries apart from South Korea and the United States, the Tucson was retired for the Hyundai ix35 from 2009 to 2015. However, the Tucson name was restored for the third generation, where it was to be used across all markets. It was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in 2015.[135] The Tucson is the fourth best-selling SUV in the world in 2020, with a total sales of 451,703 units, below the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, and Volkswagen Tiguan.[137][138]\n\n\nBy mid-2010s, Hyundai moved into developing smaller crossover SUV models, starting from the Creta (ix25 in China) from 2014, and the Kona in 2017. The Kona is also consisted of a hybrid electric and a pure battery electric variant. By 2019, both model became the third and fourth-best selling vehicle of the brand, while the Creta has been the best-selling SUV in Russia since 2016,[139][140][141] and India in 2020.[142] In 2021, Hyundai released its first crossover SUV model in the South Korean light car segment, the Casper. It is the first venture of the brand in the segment in 15 years, and also the smallest automobile the brand produces of any kind.[143]\n\n\nCurrently, Hyundai produces 12 crossover SUV models for different markets.\n\n\n\n### Hybrid and electric vehicles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hyundai E-GMP and Ioniq\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article needs to be **updated**.

The test vehicle was 1991 MY Scoupe FFV.[144] Since March 1992, in Seoul, Korea, through at least November 1993, field trials of several FFVs had been performed over more than 30,000 miles.[144]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hyundai Sonata Hybrid uses a lightweight lithium polymer battery.\nThe new hybrid-electric FGV-1 was unveiled at the Seoul Motor Show in 1995 which featured full-time electric drive technology.[145] The 1995 FGV-1 was the result of Hyundai's first experiments with hybrid propulsion systems in 1994. The FGV-2 was the second vehicle to be produced. The company is using the \"parallel\" type design, which utilizes either the internal combustion engine or the electric motor.[145] Others are the Elantra HEV and the Hyundai Accent HEV, which were unveiled in 1999 and 2000, respectively.[145]\n\n\nThe first pure electric car developed by Hyundai was the Sonata Electric Vehicle in 1991. The car started as a Sonata sedan-based model.[146] Hyundai planned to have six electric vehicles available for testing by the end of 1992.[147]\n\n\nHyundai began mass-producing hybrid electric vehicles in 2008. The company is using Hybrid Blue Drive, which includes lithium polymer batteries, as opposed to lithium-ion.[148][149][150] The new hybrid Sonata made its debut at the Los Angeles International Auto Show in November 2008.[151] The 2011 Sonata Hybrid sales in the U.S. began in February 2011.\n\n\nIn 2009, Hyundai released the Avante LPI Hybrid in the South Korean domestic market in July.[152] Hyundai showcased also the Hyundai BlueOn, an electric prototype of i10, was first unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2009. At the 2010 Geneva Motor Show, Hyundai unveiled the i-flow, a concept car using a variant of the BLUE-WILL hybrid system.[153]\n\n\nAs of March\u00a02014[update], cumulative global sales of hybrid models totaled 200,000 units, including both Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors hybrid models.[154]\n\n\nIn 2016, Hyundai revealed the Ioniq five-door liftback to rival the Toyota Prius. The nameplate *Ioniq* is a portmanteau of *ion* and *unique*.[155] It is the first automobile to be offered in hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and all-electric variants with no \"standard\" internal combustion engine only version.[156][157][158] The hybrid variant launched in its home market in February 2016, followed by the electric model in July 2016.[157][159] The plug-in hybrid version followed in February 2017.[160]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hyundai Ioniq 5 is the first Hyundai model developed on the E-GMP platform.\nIn August 2020, the company announced the launch of Ioniq as its own new electric brand and confirmed three new electric cars that will be sold under the sub-brand. Ioniq is Hyundai's second stand-alone brand after the Genesis. The new brand is going to utilise Hyundai's Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP), which they claims will enable \"fast charging capability and plentiful driving range.\"[161] The automaker said the first of the three new global models will be the Ioniq 5, a midsize crossover, arriving in early 2021. It will be followed by the Ioniq 6 sedan in late 2022, and then by the Ioniq 7, a large SUV, in early 2024. New models will be named numerically, with even numbers for sedans, and odd numbers for SUVs.[162]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Hyundai Motor Group announced details about its E-GMP platform that will be the underpinning of new Hyundai and Kia electric vehicles starting in 2021. Apart from Hyundai, Ioniq, and Kia brands, it will also be used for future Genesis electric cars.[163] The platform's main components is a battery pack under the cabin and an all-in-one motor, transmission, and inverter designed and developed by Hyundai. By bundling the components, Hyundai said, it raised the maximum speed of the motor by up to 70 percent compared to existing motors, despite its small size. The company claimed that it is capable to handle power output up to 600\u00a0hp (608\u00a0PS; 447\u00a0kW) from the system.[164]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Hyundai launched its first vehicle built above the E-GMP platform, the Ioniq 5. It is the first product to be marketed under the Ioniq sub-brand.[165] At its introduction, it is the most advanced electric vehicle produced by Hyundai. Its battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in 18 minutes with its 800 V charging capabilities by using a 350-kW charger. A five minutes charge will add 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) to its range by WLTP standards.[166] Its claimed maximum range is 480\u00a0km (298\u00a0mi) for the rear-wheel-drive 72.6 kWh variant.[167]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Hyundai announced its new automotive factory in South Korea, solely dedicated for electric vehicles and with production set to begin in 2025. It will be the first Hyundai plant to open in South Korea since 1996.[168]\n\n\nHyundai is currently expanding its full-electric lineup by adding the Ioniq 6 to its lineup, which debuted in Europe in the second half of 2022, and in the United States in spring of 2023. Hyundai is also expanding its full-electric lineup with the Ioniq 7, which is projected to hit the market in 2024.[168]\n\n\n\n### Hydrogen vehicles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai Nexo\nIn March 2018, Hyundai launched a hydrogen powered crossover SUV the Nexo.[169] In October 2020, South Korean domestic sales of the Nexo exceeded 10,000 vehicles.[170] As of July 2020, Hyundai had exported only 769 vehicles to the United States and Europe with supply limited due to domestic demand.[171][172]\n\n\nIn 2020, Hyundai launched a hydrogen powered version of its Xcient truck the Xcient Fuel Cell delivering seven vehicles to customers in Switzerland.[173] The Xcient Fuel Cell is the world's first production hydrogen fuel cell truck.[173][174] In 2019, Hyundai formed Hyundai Hydrogen Mobility (HHM) together with Swiss company H2 Energy to lease trucks to Swiss customers with plans to deliver 50 trucks by 2020.[173] Hyundai chose to launch in Switzerland as its road tax does not apply to zero-emission trucks and for its ability to produce hydrogen using hydropower.[173] HHM formed a partnership with Hydrospider, a joint venture of H2Energy, Alpiq and Linde to produce hydrogen and to build hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in Switzerland.[175] The 34-ton Xcient Fuel Cell has a 190 kW fuel cell supported by a 73\u00a0kW battery pack that stores energy from the fuel cell and from braking, seven hydrogen tanks, a maximum speed of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph), a driving range of about 400 kilometres (250\u00a0mi) and a refueling time of between 8 and 20 minutes.[174]\n\n\nIn 2020, Hyundai launched a hydrogen powered version of its Elec City bus the Elec City FCEV that has a capacity of 44 passengers with 24 seats and 20 standing seats.[170][176] The bus has a 180 kW fuel cell supported by a 156\u00a0kW battery pack, five hydrogen tanks, a driving range of 434 kilometres (270\u00a0mi) and a refuelling time of 15 minutes.[176][177] In 2020, Hyundai exported two buses to Saudi Arabian oil company Saudi Aramco for demonstration.[178]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Hyundai suspended development of its Genesis, and possibly its other, hydrogen cars.[179]\n\n\n\n### Light commercial vehicles[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

The company started selling trucks in 1969 with the D-750/800, followed by the R-182 as their first bus in 1970.[181]\n\n\nA joint venture called the Daimler-Hyundai Truck Corporation was established between Hyundai and Daimler AG[182] in 2000 to produce high-tech middle-range trucks and buses in the Korean market beginning in 2004.[183] However, after numerous delays and disputes,[184] the planned venture was cancelled in 2004, with DaimlerChrysler selling its 10.65 percent stake in Hyundai Motor.[185]\n\n\n\n## Military equipment[edit]\n\n\n*Hyundai Rotem* is a subsidiary, for manufacturing rolling stock, military equipment, and plant engineering.[186]\n\n\n\n\n## Environmental record[edit]\n\n\nOn 23 April 2008, Hyundai Motor announced the beginning of a five-year project to turn 50\u00a0km2 of infertile land into grassland by 2012. Hyundai is doing so with the help of the Korean Federation for Environmental Movement (KFEM). The project, named Hyundai Green Zone, is located 660\u00a0km north of Beijing. The goal of the project is to end the recurring dust storms in Beijing, block desertification and protect the local ecosystem. Local weeds will be planted in the region that have the ability to endure sterile alkaline soil. This is the first environmental project of the company's social contribution programme.\n\n\n\n## Motorsport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alister McRae driving an Accent WRC at the 2001 Rally Finland\nHyundai entered motorsport by competing in the F2 class of the World Rally Championship in 1998 and 1999. In September 1999, Hyundai unveiled the Accent WRC, a World Rally Car based on the Hyundai Accent. The Hyundai World Rally Team debuted the car at the 2000 Swedish Rally and achieved their first top-ten result at that year's Rally Argentina, when Alister McRae and Kenneth Eriksson finished seventh and eighth, respectively. Eriksson later drove the car to fifth place in New Zealand and fourth in Australia. In 2001, Hyundai debuted a new evolution of the Accent WRC, which was intended to improve reliability, but the performance of the car was still not good enough to challenge the four big teams (Ford, Mitsubishi, Peugeot and Subaru). However, at the season-ending Rally GB, the team achieved their best result with McRae finishing fourth and Eriksson sixth.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFor the 2002 season, Hyundai hired the four-time world champion Juha Kankkunen, along with Freddy Loix and Armin Schwarz. Kankkunen's fifth place in New Zealand was the team's best result, but they managed to edge out \u0160koda and Mitsubishi by one point in the battle for fourth place in the manufacturers' world championship. In September 2003, after a season hampered by budget constraints, Hyundai announced withdrawal from the WRC and planned to return in 2006, which did not happen.[187]\n\n\nIn 2006, following the announcement that Korea was scheduled to earn a Formula One Grand Prix, Hyundai planned to enter the sport.[188] The Korean Grand Prix was first held in 2010, but Hyundai have not entered the championship. Hyundai announced they would be revealing their future rally plans at the 2011 Chicago Auto Show, on 9 February.[189] The current plans for rallying are focused around the newest Hyundai release, the Veloster.[190] In September 2012 Hyundai announced that they were due to start the WRC with a rally model of its i20 to rival the likes of the Ford Fiesta, the Citroen DS3 and the Mini Countryman.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n **Hyundai i20 WRC** \n\n\n\n![](image)Hyundai i20 WRC\nThe Hyundai i20 WRC is a World Rally Car built by Hyundai for use in the 2014 World Rally Championship.[191] It is based on the Hyundai i20 subcompact car, and was unveiled at the 2012 Paris Motor Show. The launch of the i20 marks Hyundai's return to the World Rally Championship after a ten-year absence.[192] The car is scheduled to make its first competitive appearance at the 2014 Rallye Monte Carlo, but may compete during the 2013 season to aid development.[193]\n\n\nThe car will be operated by Hyundai's performance division, Hyundai Motorsport from a base in Frankfurt, Germany.[194]\n\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Corporate social responsibility[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Hyundai Motors established a committee to oversee its Corporate Social Responsibility programme.[195] Among the programme's initiatives have been the \"Happy Move Global Youth Volunteers Program\".[196]\n\n\nThe Hyundai Motors' India Foundation (HMIF) has invested more than 20 million rupees in various corporate social responsibility programmes in India. In 2011, it started the \"Go Green\" village adoption project in Tamil Nadu. Its aim was to promote environmentally friendly products, increase the forest cover in Tamil Nadu, and improve living and hygiene conditions in the region's villages. A number of schools have been adopted for improvement with the HMIF donating around 450 benches to government schools and drilling 10 bore wells.[197]\n\n\nIn 2020, Hyundai Motors signed a contract with UN Development Programme and launched a campaign \u2018for Tomorrow\u2019 in 2021 to create and realize a solution for problems that global society faces. In 2022, the documentary film 'for Tomorrow' was released which contains the main story of the 'for Tomorrow' project.[198]\n\n\n\n### Sports sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)UEFA Euro 2012\n* BCCI\n* Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors FC\n* FIFA (Since 1999, except the FIFA Club World Cup)\n* International Cricket Council\n* UEFA (From 2000\u20132017)\n* Cricket World Cup (Until 2015)\n* Korea Football Association\n* A-League\n* Inside the NBA\n* National Football League[199]\n* Sun Bowl[200]\n* Hyundai Tournament of Champions\n* Olympique Lyonnais (from 2013 to 2020)\n* PFC CSKA Moscow\n* Millonarios F\u00fatbol Club\n* Club Universitario de Deportes\n* Tampines Rovers FC\n* Al-Fateh SC\n* Moroka Swallows F.C.[201]\n* Mandurah City FC[202]\n* Park United FC[203]\n* Carlton Football Club[204]\n* Brisbane Lions\n* Brisbane Broncos\n* AS Cannes Volley-Ball\n* Hyundai Hockey Helpers[205]\n* Rhys Millen[206][207]\n* Atl\u00e9tico Madrid[208]\n* Hertha BSC\n* Chelsea FC\n* AS Roma\n\n### Other sponsorships[edit]\n\n\n* Academy Awards\n* CNN Worldwide\n* Hyundai Auto Club Philippines\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hyundai Child Labor Scandal, Diesel emissions scandal, and Kia Challenge\n\n### Inflated fuel economy numbers[edit]\n\n\nAfter an investigation in 2012, the EPA found that 35% of all 2011\u20132013 Hyundai and Kia vehicles had inflated fuel economy numbers; by as much as six miles per gallon. Currently, Hyundai and Kia have started a reimbursement programme for the owners of the 2011\u20132013 affected vehicles.\n[209][210][211] In 2014 the company was issued $350 million in penalties by the US government, agreed to pay $395 million in 2013 to resolve claims from vehicles owners, and agreed to pay $41.2 million to cover the \"investigative costs\" of 33 US state attorneys general.[212]\n\n\n\n### Wrongly advertised engine and horsepower[edit]\n\n\nSeveral consumers complained that the engine delivered with the Hyundai Veloster in Brazil was inferior to the one advertised.[213] Independent tests confirmed that it was not the same engine, and it delivered only 121 CV (119 HP) instead of the advertised 140 CV (138 HP), with the car earning derogatory nicknames like Slowster in the Brazilian market.[214]\n\n\n\n### Marketing controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2013, Hyundai Motors UK released a commercial depicting a man attempting to commit suicide via carbon monoxide poisoning in an ix35, only to fail to do so because of the vehicle's non-toxic emissions. The advert, produced by Hyundai's in-house agency Innocean Worldwide, received widespread criticism for promoting suicide.[215] Hyundai has since taken down the video and issued a formal apology.[215][216]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Bering Truck Corporation\n* Hyundai Group\n* Hyundai Mobis\n* Hyundai Motor Group\n* Kia Motors\n* List of Hyundai engines\n* List of Korean car makers\n* List of Hyundai Motor Company transmissions\n* List of Hyundai distributors world wide\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Pronunciations in English vary, and include:\n\n\n\t* /\u02c8h(j)\u028cnde\u026a/ *H(Y)UN-day*\n\t* /\u02c8h(j)\u028cnda\u026a/ *H(Y)UN-dye*\n\t* /ha\u026a\u02c8u\u02d0nda\u026a/ *hy-OON-dye*\n\t* /hi\u02c8\u028cnde\u026a/ *hee-UN-day*\n\nThe closest English pronunciation to the original Korean would be /\u02c8hj\u028cnd\u025b/ *HYUN-deh*, but the final vowel is checked and cannot occur word-final in English.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hyundai Motor 2016 Fast Facts\".

The first company in the group was founded in 1947 as a construction company. With government assistance, Chung and his family members rapidly expanded into various industries, eventually becoming South Korea's second chaebol. Chung Ju-yung was directly in control of the company until his death in 2001.\n\n\nThe company spun off many of its better known businesses after the 1997 Asian financial crisis and founder Chung Ju-yung's death, including Hyundai Motor Group, Hyundai Department Store Group, and Hyundai Heavy Industries Group. The Hyundai Group now focuses on elevators and tourism to Mount Kumgang.[*needs update*]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe name \"Hyundai\" comes from a Korean word (Hanja: \u73fe\u4ee3) that means \"modernity\".[2]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn 1947, Hyundai Togun (Hyundai Engineering and Construction), the initial company of the Hyundai Group, was established by Chung Ju-yung.[3] Hyundai Construction began operating outside of South Korea in 1965, initially entering the markets of Guam, Thailand and Vietnam.[4] In 1950, Hyundai Togun was renamed Hyundai Construction. In 1958, Keumkang Company was established to make construction materials. In 1965, Hyundai Construction began its first overseas venture, a highway project in Thailand.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\nIn 1967, Hyundai Motors was established.[5] Hyundai Heavy Industries was founded in 1973,[6] and completed the construction of its first ships in June 1974.[7] In 1975, the group began construction on an integrated car factory and launched a new Korean vehicle. In 1973, the group's shipyard was incorporated as Hyundai Shipbuilding and Heavy Industries and renamed Hyundai Heavy Industries in 1978. In 1976, Hyundai Corporation was established as a trading arm. The same year, Asia Merchant Marine Co. established, later renamed Hyundai Merchant Marine.[*citation needed*]\n\n![](image)The former headquarters of Hyundai in Seoul, South KoreaIn 1977, Asan Foundation was established. In 1983 Hyundai entered the semiconductor industry through the establishment of Hyundai Electronics (renamed Hynix in 2001).[8] In 1986, Hyundai Research Institute was established.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1986 a Hyundai-manufactured IBM PC-XT compatible called the **Blue Chip PC** was sold in discount and toy stores throughout the US. It was one of the earliest PC clones marketed toward consumers instead of business.[9] In 1988, Asian Sangsun was established, renamed Hyundai Logistics in 1992.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBy the mid-1990s Hyundai comprised over 60 subsidiary companies and was active in a diverse range of activities including automobile manufacturing, construction, chemicals, electronics, financial services, heavy industry and shipbuilding.[4] In the same period it had total annual revenues of around US$90 billion and over 200,000 employees.[4] In December 1995, Hyundai announced a major management restructuring, affecting 404 executives.[10]\n\n\nDuring 1997 Asian financial crisis, Hyundai acquired Kia Motors and LG Semi-Conductor.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1998, Korea's economic crisis forced the group to begin restructuring efforts, which include selling off subsidiaries and focusing on five core business areas. Nevertheless, Hyundai began South Korean tourism to North Korea's Kumgangsan. In 1999, Hyundai Asan was established to operating Kumgang tourism, the Kaesong Industrial Complex, and other inter-Korean work.[11] In April 1999 Hyundai announced an enormous corporate restructuring, involving a two-thirds reduction of the number of business units and a plan to break up the group into five independent business groups by 2003.[12][13] In 2001, the founder Chung Ju-yung died, and the Hyundai Group conglomerate continued to be dismantled.[14]\n\n\nIn 2007, Hyundai Construction Equipment India Pvt. Ltd. was established in India.[*citation needed*] In 2010, Hyundai Group was selected as a preferred bidder by creditors for the acquisition of Hyundai Engineering & Construction.[15]\nAs of 2023, Hyundai Group \"includes divisions that build and export diesel and electric locomotives, freight cars, and passenger coaches for the railroad industry, and offshore drilling and extraction equipment to the oil industry.\"[16] Hyundai's \"[i]nternational exports range from heavy industrial equipment to consumer products, and include cement, pianos, military uniforms, and consumer electronics products. Hyundai is represented on all continents but Australia, and has a number of international subsidiaries under its control.\"[16]\n\n\n\n## Logo[edit]\n\n\n* ![1957-1974 logo](image)\n\n1957-1974 logo\n* ![1974-1984 logo](image)\n\n1974-1984 logo\n* ![The current logo in use since 1984](image)\n\nThe current logo in use since 1984\n* ![Hanja variant](image)\n\nHanja variant\n\n\n## Affiliated companies[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2017, these are the affiliated companies of the Hyundai Group.[17]\n\n\n\n* Hyundai Elevator\n* Hyundai Movex\n* Hyundai Asan\n* Hyundai Research Institute\n* Hyundai Investment Partners\n* Hyundai Global\n* Able Hyundai Hotel & Resort\n* Bloomvista\n\n\n### Hyundai Motor Company[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hyundai Motor Company\n\nHyundai branded vehicles are manufactured by Hyundai Motor Company, which along with Kia forms the Hyundai Kia Automotive Group. Headquartered in Seoul, South Korea, Hyundai operates in Ulsan the world's largest integrated automobile manufacturing facility,[2] which is capable of producing 1.6 million units annually. The company employs about 75,000 people around the world. Hyundai vehicles are sold in 193 countries through some 6,000 dealerships and showrooms worldwide. In 2012, Hyundai sold over 4.4 million vehicles worldwide. Popular models include the Sonata and Elantra mid-sized sedans.[18]\n\n\nThe Asan Foundation, established by Chung Ju-yung in 1977 with 50 percent of the stock of Hyundai Construction, subsidizes medical services in Korea primarily through the Asan Medical Center and six other hospitals. The foundation has sponsored conferences on Eastern ethics and funded academic research into traditional Korean culture. In 1991, it established the annual Filial Piety Award.[19]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\nPortals:* ![flag](image) South Korea\n* ![](image) Companies\n\n* Economy of South Korea\n* Chaebol\n* Hyundai Motor Company\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Pronunciations in English vary.
