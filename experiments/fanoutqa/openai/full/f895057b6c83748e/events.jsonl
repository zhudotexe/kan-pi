Listed by the GaWC as an alpha global city, São Paulo is the most populous city outside of Asia and the world's 4th largest city proper by population. Additionally, São Paulo is the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. It exerts strong international influences in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.[8] The city's name honors the Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the Greater São Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater São Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundiaí, Sorocaba and São José dos Campos) created the São Paulo Macrometropolis,[9] a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[10]\n\n\nHaving the largest economy by GDP in Latin America,[11] the city is home to the São Paulo Stock Exchange. Paulista Avenue is the economic core of São Paulo. The city has the 23rd largest GDP in the world,[12] representing 10.7% of all Brazilian GDP[13] and 36% of the production of goods and services in the state of São Paulo, being home to 63% of established multinationals in Brazil,[14] and was responsible for 28% of the national scientific production in 2005, as measured by the number of science papers published in journals.[15]\n\n\nThe metropolis is also home to several of the tallest skyscrapers in Brazil, including the Mirante do Vale, Edifício Itália, Banespa, North Tower and many others. The city has cultural, economic and political influence nationally and internationally. It is home to monuments, parks and museums such as the Latin American Memorial, the Ibirapuera Park, Museum of Ipiranga, São Paulo Museum of Art, and the Museum of the Portuguese Language. The city holds events like the São Paulo Jazz Festival, São Paulo Art Biennial, the Brazilian Grand Prix, São Paulo Fashion Week, the ATP Brasil Open, the Brasil Game Show and the Comic Con Experience. São Paulo's LGBT Pride parade ranks second only to the New York City Pride March as the largest LGBT pride parade in the world.[16][17]\n\n\nSão Paulo is a cosmopolitan, melting pot city, home to the largest Arab, Italian, and Japanese diasporas, with examples including ethnic neighborhoods of Bixiga, Bom Retiro, and Liberdade. In 2016, inhabitants of the city were native to over 200 countries.[18] People from the city are known as *paulistanos*, while *paulistas* designates anyone from the state, including the *paulistanos*. The city's Latin motto, which it has shared with the battleship and the aircraft carrier named after it, is *Non ducor, duco*, which translates as \"I am not led, I lead.\"[19] The city, which is also colloquially known as *Sampa*, *Selva de Pedra* (Jungle of Stone)[20] or *Terra da Garoa* (Land of Drizzle), is known for its unreliable weather, the size of its helicopter fleet, its architecture, gastronomy, severe traffic congestion and skyscrapers. São Paulo was one of the host cities of the 1950 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Additionally, the city hosted the IV Pan American Games, Miss Universe 2011, and the São Paulo Indy 300.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the city of São Paulo\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of São Paulo.\n\n### Pre-colonial period[edit]\n\n\nHistorical affiliations\n\n\n> \n> ![Portugal](image) Portuguese Empire 1554–1815  \n> ![](image) United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves 1815–1822  \n> ![](image) Empire of Brazil 1822–1889  \n> ![Brazil](image) Republic of Brazil 1889–present\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nThe region of modern-day São Paulo, then known as Piratininga plains around the Tietê River, was inhabited by the Tupi people, such as the Tupiniquim, Guaianás, and Guarani. Other tribes also lived in areas that today form the metropolitan region.[21]\n\n\nThe region was divided in Caciquedoms (chiefdoms) at the time of encounter with the Europeans.[22] The most notable cacique was Tibiriçá, known for his support for the Portuguese and other European colonists. Among the many indigenous names of places, rivers, neighborhoods, etc., that survive today are Tietê, Ipiranga, Tamanduateí, Anhangabaú, Piratininga, Itaquaquecetuba, Cotia, Itapevi, Barueri, Embu-Guaçu, etc.\n\n\n\n### Colonial period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Founding of São Paulo*, 1909 painting by Oscar Pereira da Silva\n![](image)Courtyard of the college, *Pátio do Colégio*, in the Historic Center of São Paulo. At this location, the city was founded in 1554. The current building is a reconstruction made in the late 20th century, based on the Jesuit college and church that were erected at the site in 1653.\nThe Portuguese village of São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga was marked by the founding of the Colégio de São Paulo de Piratininga on 25 January 1554. The Jesuit college of twelve priests included Manuel da Nóbrega and Spanish priest José de Anchieta. They built a mission on top of a steep hill between the Anhangabaú and Tamanduateí rivers.[23]\n\n\nThey first had a small structure built of rammed earth, made by Native Indian workers in their traditional style. The priests wanted to evangelize these Indians who lived in the Plateau region of Piratininga and convert them to Christianity. The site was separated from the coast by the Serra do Mar mountain range, called \"Serra Paranapiacaba\" by the Indians.\n\n\nThe college was named for a Christian saint and its founding on the feast day of the celebration of the conversion of the Apostle Paul of Tarsus. Father José de Anchieta wrote this account in a letter to the Society of Jesus:\n\n\n\n\n> The settlement of the region's Courtyard of the College began in 1560. During the visit of Mem de Sá, Governor-General of Brazil, the Captaincy of São Vicente, he ordered the transfer of the population of the Village of São Bernardo do Campo to the vicinity of the college. It was then named \"College of St. Paul of the Piratininga\". The new location was on a steep hill adjacent to a large wetland, the Várzea do Carmo. It offered better protection from attacks by local Indian groups. It was renamed Vila de São Paulo, belonging to the Captaincy of São Vicente.\n> \n> \n\n\nFor the next two centuries, São Paulo developed as a poor and isolated village that survived largely through the cultivation of subsistence crops by the labor of natives. For a long time, São Paulo was the only village in Brazil's interior, as travel was too difficult for many to reach the area. Mem de Sá forbade colonists to use the Caminho do Piraquê *(Piraquê Path)* and today known as Piaçaguera, because of frequent Indian raids along it.\n\n\nOn 22 March 1681, Luís Álvares de Castro, the Second Marquis de Cascais and donee of the Captaincy of São Vicente, moved the capital to the village of São Paulo *(see Timeline of São Paulo)*, designating it the \"Head of the captaincy\". The new capital was established on 23 April 1683, with public celebrations.\n\n\n\n#### The Bandeirantes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bandeirantes\n\n![](image)The Monument to the Bandeiras commemorates the 17th-century *bandeiras*.\nIn the 17th century, São Paulo was one of the poorest regions of the Portuguese colony. It was also the center of interior colonial development. Because they were extremely poor, the Paulistas could not afford to buy African slaves, as did other Portuguese colonists. The discovery of gold in the region of Minas Gerais, in the 1690s, brought attention and new settlers to São Paulo. The Captaincy of São Paulo and Minas de Ouro (see Captaincies of Brazil) was created on 3 November 1709, when the Portuguese crown purchased the Captaincies of São Paulo and Santo Amaro from the former grantees.[24]\n\n\nConveniently located in the country, up the steep *Serra do Mar* escarpment/mountain range when traveling from Santos, while also not too far from the coastline, São Paulo became a safe place to stay for tired travelers. The town became a center for the *bandeirantes*, intrepid invaders who marched into unknown lands in search for gold, diamonds, precious stones, and Indians to enslave. The *bandeirantes*, which could be translated as \"flag-bearers\" or \"flag-followers\", organized excursions into the land with the primary purpose of profit and the expansion of territory for the Portuguese crown. Trade grew from the local markets and from providing food and accommodation for explorers. The *bandeirantes* eventually became politically powerful as a group, and forced the expulsion of the Jesuits from the city of São Paulo in 1640. The two groups had frequently come into conflict because of the Jesuits' opposition to the domestic slave trade in Indians.\n\n\n\n![](image)East entrance of the city of São Paulo in 1821, by Arnaud Julien Pallière (1784–1862)\nOn 11 July 1711, the town of São Paulo was elevated to city status. Around the 1720s, gold was found by the pioneers in the regions near what are now Cuiabá and Goiânia. The Portuguese expanded their Brazilian territory beyond the Tordesillas Line to incorporate the gold regions. When the gold ran out in the late 18th century, São Paulo shifted to growing sugar cane. Cultivation of this commodity crop spread through the interior of the Captaincy. The sugar was exported through the Port of Santos. At that time, the first modern highway between São Paulo and the coast was constructed and named the Calçada do Lorena *(\"Lorena's settway\")*. Nowadays, the estate that is home to the Governor of the State of São Paulo, in the city of São Paulo, is called the *Palácio dos Bandeirantes* (Bandeirantes Palace), in the neighborhood of Morumbi.\n\n\n\n### Imperial period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Empire of Brazil\n\n![](image)Monument to Independence in Independence Park, located at the place where then-Prince Pedro proclaimed the independence of Brazil\n![](image)Cathedral Square of São Paulo in 1880, during the reign of Emperor Pedro II by Marc Ferrez\nAfter Brazil became independent from Portugal in 1822, as declared by Emperor Pedro I where the Monument to the Independence of Brazil is located, he named São Paulo as an Imperial City. In 1827, a law school was founded at the Convent of São Francisco, today part of the University of São Paulo. The influx of students and teachers gave a new impetus to the city's growth, thanks to which the city became the *Imperial City and Borough of Students of St. Paul of Piratininga*.\n\n\nThe expansion of coffee production was a major factor in the growth of São Paulo, as it became the region's chief export crop and yielded good revenue. It was cultivated initially in the Paraíba Valley region in the East of the State of São Paulo, and later on in the regions of Campinas, Rio Claro, São Carlos and Ribeirão Preto.\n\n\nFrom 1869 onward, São Paulo was connected to the port of Santos by the Estrada de Ferro Santos-Jundiaí (Santos-Jundiaí Railroad), nicknamed *The Lady*. In the late 19th century, several other railroads connected the interior to the state capital. São Paulo became the point of convergence of all railroads from the interior of the state. Coffee was the economic engine for major economic and population growth in the State of São Paulo.\n\n\nIn 1888, the \"Golden Law\" (*Lei Áurea*) was sanctioned by Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil, abolishing the institution of slavery in Brazil. Slaves were the main source of labor in the coffee plantations until then. As a consequence of this law, and following governmental stimulus towards the increase of immigration, the province began to receive a large number of immigrants, largely Italians, Japanese and Portuguese peasants, many of whom settled in the capital. The region's first industries also began to emerge, providing jobs to the newcomers, especially those who had to learn Portuguese.\n\n\n\n### Old Republican period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Luz Station in 1900\nBy the time Brazil became a republic on 15 November 1889, coffee exports were still an important part of São Paulo's economy. São Paulo grew strong in the national political scene, taking turns with the also rich state of Minas Gerais in electing Brazilian presidents, an alliance that became known as \"coffee and milk\", given that Minas Gerais was famous for its dairy production. During this period, São Paulo went from regional center to national metropolis, becoming industrialized and reaching its first million inhabitants in 1928. Its greatest growth in this period was relative in the 1890s when it doubled its population. The height of the coffee period is represented by the construction of the second Luz Station (the present building) at the end of the 19th century and by the Paulista Avenue in 1900, where they built many mansions.[25]\n\n\nIndustrialization was the economic cycle that followed the coffee plantation model. By the hands of some industrious families, including many immigrants of Italian and Jewish origin, factories began to arise and São Paulo became known for its smoky, foggy air. The cultural scene followed modernist and naturalist tendencies in fashion at the beginning of the 20th century. Some examples of notable modernist artists are poets Mário de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade, artists Anita Malfatti, Tarsila do Amaral and Lasar Segall, and sculptor Victor Brecheret. The Modern Art Week of 1922 that took place at the Theatro Municipal was an event marked by avant-garde ideas and works of art. In 1929, São Paulo won its first skyscraper, the Martinelli Building.[25]\n\n\nThe modifications made in the city by Antônio da Silva Prado, Baron of Duprat and Washington Luís, who governed from 1899 to 1919, contributed to the climate development of the city; some scholars consider that the entire city was demolished and rebuilt at that time. São Paulo's main economic activities derive from the services industry – factories are since long gone, and in came financial services institutions, law firms, consulting firms. Old factory buildings and warehouses still dot the landscape in neighborhoods such as Barra Funda and Brás. Some cities around São Paulo, such as Diadema, São Bernardo do Campo, Santo André, and Cubatão are still heavily industrialized to the present day, with factories producing from cosmetics to chemicals to automobiles.\n\n\nIn 1924 the city was the stage of the São Paulo Revolt, an armed conflict fought in working-class neighborhoods near the center of São Paulo that lasted 23 days, from 5 to 28 July, leaving hundreds dead and thousands injured. The confrontation between the federal troops of president Artur Bernardes against rebels of the Brazilian Army and the Public Force of São Paulo was classified by the federal government as a conspiracy, a mutiny and a \"revolt against the Fatherland, without foundation, headed by disorderly members of the Brazilian Army\".[26] To face the rebels, the federal government launched an indiscriminate artillery bombardment against the city, which affected mostly civilian targets; as a result of the bombing, a third of São Paulo's 700,000 inhabitants fled the city. The revolt has been described as \"the largest urban conflict in the history of Brazil\".[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAnhangabaú Valley in Downtown São Paulo, 1925\n\n### Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Constitutionalist Revolution\n\n![](image)Group of aviators from São Paulo at Campo de Marte Airport during the Constitutionalist Revolution\nThis revolution is considered by some historians as the last armed conflict to take place in Brazil's history. On 9 July 1932, the population of São Paulo town rose against a coup d'état by Getúlio Vargas to take the presidential office. The movement grew out of local resentment from the fact that Vargas ruled by decree, unbound by a constitution, in a provisional government. The 1930 coup also affected São Paulo by eroding the autonomy that states enjoyed during the term of the 1891 Constitution and preventing the inauguration of the governor of São Paulo Júlio Prestes in the Presidency of the Republic, while simultaneously overthrowing President Washington Luís, who was governor of São Paulo from 1920 to 1924. These events marked the end of the Old Republic.\n\n\nThe uprising commenced on 9 July 1932, after four protesting students were killed by federal government troops on 23 May 1932. On the wake of their deaths, a movement called MMDC (from the initials of the names of each of the four students killed, Martins, Miragaia, Dráusio and Camargo) started. A fifth victim, Alvarenga, was also shot that night, but died months later. In a few months, the state of São Paulo rebelled against the federal government. Counting on the solidarity of the political elites of two other powerful states, (Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul), the politicians from São Paulo expected a quick war. However, that solidarity was never translated into actual support, and the São Paulo revolt was militarily crushed on 2 October 1932. In total, there were 87 days of fighting (9 July to 4 October 1932 – with the last two days after the surrender of São Paulo), with a balance of 934 official deaths, though non-official estimates report up to 2,200 dead, and many cities in the state of São Paulo suffered damage due to fighting. There is an obelisk in front of Ibirapuera Park that serves as a memorial to the young men that died for the MMDC. The University of São Paulo's Law School also pays homage to the students that died during this period with plaques hung on its arcades.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jaraguá Peak is the highest point in the city, at 1,135 meters (3,724 ft).[28]\nSão Paulo is the capital of the most populous state in Brazil, São Paulo, located at latitude 23°33'01'' south and longitude 46°38'02'' west. The total area of the municipality is 1,521.11 square kilometres (587.30 sq mi), according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), being the ninth largest in the state in terms of territorial extension.[29] Of the entire area of the municipality, 949,611 square kilometres (366,647 sq mi) are urban areas (2015), being the largest urban area in the country.[30]\n\n\nThe city is on a plateau placed beyond the Serra do Mar (Portuguese for \"Sea Range\" or \"Coastal Range\"), itself a component of the vast region known as the Brazilian Highlands, with an average elevation of around 799 meters (2,621 ft) above sea level, although being at a distance of only about 70 kilometers (43 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean. The distance is covered by two highways, the Anchieta and the Imigrantes, (see \"Transportation\" below) that roll down the range, leading to the port city of Santos and the beach resort of Guarujá. Rolling terrain prevails within the urbanized areas of São Paulo except in its northern area, where the Serra da Cantareira Range reaches a higher elevation and a sizable remnant of the Atlantic Rain Forest. The region is seismically stable and no significant activity has ever been recorded.[31]\n\n\n\n### Hydrography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nTietê River, with the Marginal Tietê\n![](image)\nBillings Reservoir\n\nSee also: Water management in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo\n\nThe Tietê River and its tributary, the Pinheiros River, were once important sources of fresh water and leisure for São Paulo. However, heavy industrial effluents and wastewater discharges in the later 20th century caused the rivers to become heavily polluted. A substantial clean-up program for both rivers is underway.[32][33] Neither river is navigable in the stretch that flows through the city, although water transportation becomes increasingly important on the Tietê river further downstream (near river Paraná), as the river is part of the River Plate basin.[34]\n\n\nNo large natural lakes exist in the region, but the Billings and Guarapiranga reservoirs in the city's southern outskirts are used for power generation, water storage and leisure activities, such as sailing. The original flora consisted mainly of broadleaf evergreens. Non-native species are common, as the mild climate and abundant rainfall permit a multitude of tropical, subtropical and temperate plants to be cultivated, especially the ubiquitous eucalyptus.[35]\n\n\nThe north of the municipality contains part of the 7,917 hectares (19,560 acres) Cantareira State Park, created in 1962, which protects a large part of the metropolitan São Paulo water supply.[36] In 2015, São Paulo experienced a major drought, which led several cities in the state to start a rationing system.[37]\n\n\n\n### Parks and biodiversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nCantareira State Park, part of the São Paulo Green Belt Biosphere Reserve\n![](image)\nSão Paulo Zoo in the Fontes do Ipiranga Biological Reserve\n\nSão Paulo is located in an ecotone area between 3 biomes: mixed ombrophilous forest, dense ombrophilous forest and cerrado; the latter had some plant species native to the pampas in the city. There were several species typical of both biomes, among them we can mention: araucarias, pitangueiras, cambucís, ipês, jabuticabeiras, queen palms, muricís-do-campo, etc.[38]\n\n\nIn 2010, São Paulo had 62 municipal and state parks,[39] such as the Cantareira State Park, part of the São Paulo Green Belt Biosphere Reserve and home to one of the largest urban forests on the planet with 7,900 hectares (20,000 acres) of extension,[40] the Fontes do Ipiranga State Park, the Ibirapuera Park, the Tietê Ecological Park, the Capivari-Monos Environmental Protection Area, the Serra do Mar State Park, Villa-Lobos State Park, People's Park, and the Jaraguá State Park, listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994.[41]\n\n\nIn 2009, São Paulo had 2,300 hectares (5,700 acres) of green area, less than 1.5% of the city's area[42] and below the 12 square metres (130 sq ft) per inhabitant recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).[43] About 21% of the municipality's area is covered by green areas, including ecological reserves (2010 data).[44][45]\n\n\nIn the municipality it is possible to observe forest birds that usually appear in the spring, due to the belt of native forest that still surrounds the metropolitan region. Species such as the rufous-bellied thrush, golden-chevroned tanager, great kiskadee and hummingbird are the most common. Despite the intense pollution, the main rivers of the city, the Tietê and the Pinheiros, shelter several species of animals such as capybaras, hawks, southern lapwings, herons and nutrias. Other species found in the municipality are the gray brocket, howler monkey, green-billed toucan and the Amazonian umbrellabird.[46]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nTietê River, one of the most polluted in the city\n![](image)\nSmog seen on the horizon of the Ibirapuera region\n\nAir pollution in some districts of the city exceeds local standards, mainly due to car traffic.[47] The World Health Organization (WHO) sets a limit of 20 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter of air as a safe annual average. In an assessment carried out by the WHO among over a thousand cities around the world in 2011, the city of São Paulo was ranked 268th among the most polluted, with an average rate of 38 micrograms per cubic meter, a rate well above the limit imposed by the organization, but lower than in other Brazilian cities, such as Rio de Janeiro (64 micrograms per cubic meter).[48] A 2013 study found that air pollution in the city causes more deaths than traffic accidents.[49][50]\n\n\nThe stretch of the Tietê River that runs through the city is the most polluted river in Brazil.[51] In 1992, the Tietê Project began, with the aim to clean up the river by 2005. 8.8 billion reais was spent on the failed project.[52] In 2019, the Novo Rio Pinheiros Project began, under the administration of João Doria, with the aim to reduce sewage discharged into the Tietê's tributary, the Pinheiros River.[53][54]\n\n\nThe problem of balanced water supply for the city - and for the metropolis, in general - is also a worrying issue: São Paulo has few sources of water in its own perimeter, having to seek it in distant hydrographic basins. The problem of water pollution is also aggravated by the irregular occupation of watershed areas, caused by urban expansion, driven by the difficulty of access to land and housing in central areas by the low-income population[55] and associated with real estate speculation and precariousness in new subdivisions. With this, there is also an overvaluation of individual transport over public transport – leading to the current rate of more than one vehicle for every two inhabitants and aggravating the problem of environmental pollution.[56]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Heavy rain and lightning in São Paulo, which has one of the largest number of lightning incidents amongst Brazilian state capitals[57]\nAccording to the Köppen classification, the city has a humid subtropical climate (*Cfa/Cwa*).[58][59] In summer (January through March), the mean low temperature is about 19 °C (66 °F) and the mean high temperatures is near 28 °C (82 °F). In winter, temperatures tend to range between 12 and 22 °C (54 and 72 °F). The record high temperature was 37.8 °C (100.0 °F) on 17 October 2014[60] and the lowest −3.2 °C (26.2 °F) on 25 June 1918.[61][62] The Tropic of Capricorn, at about 23°27' S, passes through north of São Paulo and roughly marks the boundary between the tropical and temperate areas of South America. Because of its elevation, however, São Paulo experiences a more temperate climate.[63] The city experiences four seasons. The summer is warm and rainy. Autumn and spring are transitional seasons. Winter is the coldest season, with cloudiness around town and frequently polar air masses. Frosts occur sporadically in regions further away from the center, in some winters throughout the city.[64]\n\n\nRainfall is abundant, annually averaging 1,454 millimeters (57.2 in).[65] It is especially common in the warmer months averaging 219 millimeters (8.6 in) and decreases in winter, averaging 47 millimeters (1.9 in). Neither São Paulo nor the nearby coast has ever been hit by a tropical cyclone and tornadic activity is uncommon. During late winter, especially August, the city experiences the phenomenon known as *\"veranico\"* or *\"verãozinho\"* (\"little summer\"), which consists of hot and dry weather, sometimes reaching temperatures well above 28 °C (82 °F). On the other hand, relatively cool days during summer are fairly common when persistent winds blow from the ocean. On such occasions daily high temperatures may not surpass 20 °C (68 °F), accompanied by lows often below 15 °C (59 °F), however, summer can be extremely hot when a heat wave hits the city followed by temperatures around 34 °C (93 °F), but in places with greater skyscraper density and less tree cover, the temperature can feel like 39 °C (102 °F), as on Paulista Avenue for example. In the summer of 2014, São Paulo was affected by a heat wave that lasted for almost 4 weeks with highs above 30 °C (86 °F), peaking on 36 °C (97 °F). Secondary to deforestation, groundwater pollution, and climate change, São Paulo is increasingly susceptible to drought and water shortages.[66]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for São Paulo (Mirante de Santana, 1991–2020, extremes 1887–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 37.0(98.6)\n | 35.9(96.6)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 31.7(89.1)\n | 28.8(83.8)\n | 30.2(86.4)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 35.7(96.3)\n | 35.9(96.6)\n | 35.3(95.5)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 37.0(98.6)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n | 28.0(82.4)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 25.2(77.4)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 17.5(63.5)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 18.1(64.6)\n | 19.1(66.4)\n | 20.5(68.9)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 17.5(63.5)\n | 14.7(58.5)\n | 13.5(56.3)\n | 12.8(55.0)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n | 14.9(58.8)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 6.5(43.7)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 6.8(44.2)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 0.8(33.4)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 10.3(50.5)\n | 0.8(33.4)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 292.1(11.50)\n | 257.7(10.15)\n | 229.1(9.02)\n | 87.0(3.43)\n | 66.3(2.61)\n | 59.7(2.35)\n | 48.4(1.91)\n | 32.3(1.27)\n | 83.3(3.28)\n | 127.2(5.01)\n | 143.9(5.67)\n | 231.3(9.11)\n | 1,658.3(65.29)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 17\n | 14\n | 13\n | 6\n | 6\n | 5\n | 4\n | 4\n | 7\n | 10\n | 11\n | 13\n | 110\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 76.9\n | 75.0\n | 76.6\n | 74.6\n | 75.0\n | 73.5\n | 70.8\n | 68.2\n | 71.3\n | 73.7\n | 73.7\n | 73.9\n | 73.6\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 139.1\n | 153.5\n | 161.6\n | 169.3\n | 167.6\n | 160.0\n | 169.0\n | 173.1\n | 144.5\n | 157.9\n | 152.8\n | 145.1\n | 1,893.5\n |\n| Source 1: Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (sun 1981–2010)[67][68][69][70][71][72][73] |\n| Source 2: Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)[74] |\n\n| Climate data for São Paulo (Horto Florestal, 1961–1990)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 34.6(94.3)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n | 33.2(91.8)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 34.6(94.3)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 27.8(82.0)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 23.7(74.7)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 24.7(76.5)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.3(79.3)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 18.6(65.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 16.9(62.4)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 14.1(57.4)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | 9.7(49.5)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 10.3(50.5)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 9.6(49.3)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 0.2(32.4)\n | −1.8(28.8)\n | 0.2(32.4)\n | 0.4(32.7)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | 5.7(42.3)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 9.2(48.6)\n | −1.8(28.8)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 245.6(9.67)\n | 243.8(9.60)\n | 159.2(6.27)\n | 76.0(2.99)\n | 59.7(2.35)\n | 58.7(2.31)\n | 53.1(2.09)\n | 39.9(1.57)\n | 76.2(3.00)\n | 162.7(6.41)\n | 195.7(7.70)\n | 220.6(8.69)\n | 1,591.3(62.65)\n |\n| Average rainy days (≥ 1 mm) | 16\n | 14\n | 11\n | 7\n | 6\n | 5\n | 5\n | 4\n | 7\n | 11\n | 12\n | 15\n | 113\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 81.0\n | 80.4\n | 80.3\n | 81.2\n | 80.5\n | 79.2\n | 77.4\n | 74.6\n | 76.2\n | 79.3\n | 79.4\n | 80.4\n | 79.2\n |\n| Source: Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET).[75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Brazilians, Demographics of São Paulo, and Demographics of Brazil\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1872 | 31,385 | —     |\n| 1890 | 64,934 | +4.12% |\n| 1900 | 239,820 | +13.96% |\n| 1920 | 579,033 | +4.51% |\n| 1940 | 1,326,261 | +4.23% |\n| 1950 | 2,198,096 | +5.18% |\n| 1960 | 3,781,446 | +5.58% |\n| 1970 | 5,924,615 | +4.59% |\n| 1980 | 8,493,226 | +3.67% |\n| 1991 | 9,646,185 | +1.16% |\n| 2000 | 10,434,252 | +0.88% |\n| 2010 | 11,253,503 | +0.76% |\n| 2021 | 12,396,372 | +0.88% |\n| [84] |\n\n\nSão Paulo's population has grown rapidly. By 1960 it had surpassed that of Rio de Janeiro, making it Brazil's most populous city. By this time, the urbanized area of São Paulo had extended beyond the boundaries of the municipality proper into neighboring municipalities, making it a metropolitan area with a population of 4.6 million. Population growth has continued since 1960, although the rate of growth has slowed.[85]\n\n\nIn 2013, São Paulo was the most populous city in Brazil and in South America.[86] According to the 2010 IBGE Census, there were 11,244,369 people residing in the city of São Paulo.[87] Portuguese remains the most widely spoken language and São Paulo is the largest city in the Portuguese speaking world.[88]\n\n\nIn 2010, the city had 2,146,077 opposite-sex couples and 7,532 same-sex couples. The population of São Paulo was 52.6% female and 47.4% male.[89] The census found 6,824,668 White people (60.6%), 3,433,218 Pardo (multiracial) people (30.5%), 736,083 Black people (6.5%), 246,244 Asian people (2.2%) and 21,318 Amerindian people (0.2%).[89]\n\n\n\n### Immigration and migration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Brazil\n\nSão Paulo is considered the most multicultural city in Brazil. From 1870 to 2010, approximately 2.3 million immigrants arrived in the state, from all parts of the world. The Italian community is one of the strongest, with a presence throughout the city. Of the 12 million inhabitants of São Paulo, 50% (6 million people) have full or partial Italian ancestry. São Paulo has more descendants of Italians than any Italian city (the largest city of Italy is Rome, with 2.8 million inhabitants).[90]\n\n\n\n| Race and ethnicity in São Paulo |\n| --- |\n| Ethnicity |  | Percentage |\n| White |  | 60.6% |\n| Pardo (Multiracial) |  | 30.5% |\n| Black |  | 6.5% |\n| Asian |  | 2.2% |\n| Amerindian |  | 0.2% |\n\nThe main groups, considering all the metropolitan area, are: 6 million people of Italian descent,[91] 3 million people of Portuguese descent,[92] 1.7 million people of African descent,[93] 1 million people of Arab descent,[94] 665,000 people of Japanese descent,[94] 400,000 people of German descent,[94] 250,000 people of French descent,[94] 150,000 people of Greek descent,[94] 120,000 people of Chinese descent,[94] 120,000–300,000 Bolivian immigrants,[95] 50,000 people of Korean descent,[96] and 80,000 Jews.[97]\n\n\nEven today, Italians are grouped in neighborhoods like Bixiga, Brás, and Mooca to promote celebrations and festivals. In the early twentieth century, Italian and its dialects were spoken almost as much as Portuguese in the city, which influenced the formation of the São Paulo dialect of today. Six thousand pizzerias are producing about a million pizzas a day. Brazil has the largest Italian population outside Italy, with São Paulo being the most populous city with Italian ancestry in the world.[98]\n\n\nThe Portuguese community is also large; it is estimated that three million paulistanos have some origin in Portugal. The Jewish colony is more than 80,000 people in São Paulo and is concentrated mainly in Higienópolis and Bom Retiro.[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)Italian immigrants in the Immigrant Inn, c. 1890\n![](image)The Liberdade district is a Japantown of São Paulo.\nFrom the nineteenth century through the first half of the twentieth century, São Paulo also received German immigrants (in the current neighborhood of Santo Amaro), Spanish and Lithuanian (in the neighborhood Vila Zelina).[99]\n\n\n\n\n> \"A French observer, travelling to São Paulo at the time, noted that there was a division of the capitalist class, by nationality (...) Germans, French and Italians shared the dry goods sector with Brazilians. Foodstuffs was generally the province of either Portuguese or Brazilians, except for bakery and pastry which was the domain of the French and Germans. Shoes and tinware were mostly controlled by Italians. However, the larger metallurgical plants were in the hands of the English and the Americans. (...) Italians outnumbered Brazilians two to one in São Paulo.\"\n> \n> — [100]\n> \n\n\nUntil 1920, 1,078,437 Italians entered in the State of São Paulo. Of the immigrants who arrived there between 1887 and 1902, 63.5% came from Italy. Between 1888 and 1919, 44.7% of the immigrants were Italians, 19.2% were Spaniards and 15.4% were Portuguese.[101] In 1920, nearly 80% of São Paulo city's population was composed of immigrants and their descendants and Italians made up over half of its male population.[101] At that time, the Governor of São Paulo said that \"if the owner of each house in São Paulo display the flag of the country of origin on the roof, from above São Paulo would look like an Italian city\". In 1900, a columnist who was absent from São Paulo for 20 years wrote \"then São Paulo used to be a genuine Paulista city, today it is an Italian city.\"[101]\n\n\nSão Paulo also is home of the largest Japanese community outside Japan.[102] In 1958 the census counted 120,000 Japanese in the city and by 1987, there were 326,000 with another 170,000 in the surrounding areas within São Paulo state.[103] As of 2007, the Paulistano Japanese population outnumbered their fellow diaspora in the entirety of Peru, and in all individual American cities.[103]\n\n\nResearch conducted by the University of São Paulo (USP) shows the city's high ethnic diversity: when asked if they are \"descendants of foreign immigrants\", 81% of the students reported \"yes\". The main reported ancestries were: Italian (30.5%), Portuguese (23%), Spanish (14%), Japanese (8%), German (6%), *Brazilian* (4%), African (3%), Arab (2%) and Jewish (1%).[104]\n\n\nThe city once attracted numerous immigrants from all over Brazil and even from foreign countries, due to a strong economy and for being the hub of most Brazilian companies.[105] São Paulo is also receiving waves of immigration from Haiti and from many countries of Africa and the Caribbean. Those immigrants are mainly concentrated in Praça da Sé, Glicério and Vale do Anhangabaú in the Central Zone of São Paulo.\n\n\nSince the 19th century people began migrating from northeastern Brazil into São Paulo. This migration grew enormously in the 1930s and remained huge in the next decades. The concentration of land, modernization in rural areas, changes in work relationships and cycles of droughts stimulated migration. Northeastern migrants live mainly in hazardous and unhealthy areas of the city, in cortiços *(\"guettos\")*, in favelas *(\"slums\")* of the metropolis, because they offer cheaper housing. The largest concentration of northeastern migrants was found in the area of Sé/Brás (districts of Brás, Bom Retiro, Cambuci, Pari and Sé). In this area they composed 41% of the population.[106][*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan area[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Greater São Paulo and São Paulo Macrometropolis\n\n![](image)Satellite view of Greater São Paulo at night\nThe nonspecific term \"Grande São Paulo\" (\"*Greater São Paulo*\") covers multiple definitions. The legally defined *Região Metropolitana de São Paulo* consists of 39 municipalities in total and a population of 21.1 million[107] inhabitants (as of the 2014 National Census[update]).\n\n\nThe Metropolitan Region of São Paulo is known as the financial, economic, and cultural center of Brazil. Among the largest municipalities, Guarulhos, with a population of more than 1 million people is the biggest one. Several others count more than 100,000 inhabitants, such as São Bernardo do Campo (811,000 inh.) and Santo André (707,000 inh.) in the ABC Region. The ABC Region, comprising Santo André, São Bernardo do Campo and São Caetano do Sul in the south of Grande São Paulo, is an important location for industrial corporations, such as Volkswagen and Ford Motors.[108]\n\n\nBecause São Paulo has urban sprawl, it uses a different definition for its metropolitan area alternately called the Expanded Metropolitan Complex of São Paulo and the São Paulo Macrometropolis. Analogous to the BosWash definition, it is one of the largest urban agglomerations in the world, with 32 million inhabitants,[109] behind Tokyo, which includes four contiguous legally defined metropolitan regions and three micro-regions.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n| Religion in São Paulo (2010 Census)[110] |\n| --- |\n| Religion |  | Percent |\n| Roman Catholicism |  | 58.2% |\n| Protestantism |  | 22.1% |\n| No religion |  | 9.38% |\n| Spiritism |  | 4.73% |\n| Others |  | 4.25% |\n| Other Christians |  | 1.33% |\n\nSee also: Religion in Brazil, Protestantism in Brazil, and Roman Catholic Church in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nSão Paulo Metropolitan Cathedral\n![](image)\nOrthodox Cathedral of São Paulo\n![](image)\nTemple of Solomon of the UCKG\n![](image)\nBuddhist Lohan Temple, Liberdade\n![](image)\nBrás mosque\n![](image)\nBeth El Synagogue\n\nLike the cultural variety verifiable in São Paulo, there are several religious manifestations present in the city. Although it has developed on an eminently Catholic social matrix, both due to colonization and immigration – and even today most of the people of São Paulo declare themselves Roman Catholic – it is possible to find in the city dozens of different Protestant denominations, as well as the practice of Islam, Spiritism, among others. Buddhism and Eastern religions also have relevance among the beliefs most practiced by Paulistanos. It is estimated that there are more than one hundred thousand Buddhist followers and Hindu. Also considerable are Judaism, Mormonism and Afro-Brazilian religions.[110]\n\n\nAccording to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in 2010 the population of São Paulo was 6,549,775 Roman Catholics (58.2%), 2,887,810 Protestants (22.1%), 531,822 Spiritists (4.7%), 101,493 Jehovah's Witnesses (0.9%), 75,075 Buddhists (0.7%), 50,794 Umbandists (0.5%), 43,610 Jews (0.4%), 28,673 Catholic Apostolic Brazilians (0.3%), 25,583 eastern religious (0.2%), 18,058 Candomblecists (0.2%), 17,321 Mormons (0.2%), 14,894 Eastern Orthodox (0.1%), 9,119 spiritualists (0.1%), 8,277 Muslims (0.1%), 7,139 esoteric (0.1%), 1,829 practiced Indian traditions (<0.1%) and 1,008 were Hindu (<0.1%). Others 1,056 008 had no religion (9.4%), 149,628 followed other Christian religiosities (1.3%), 55,978 had an undetermined religion or multiple belonging (0.5%), 14,127 did not know (0.1%) And 1,896 reported following other religiosities (<0.1%).[110]\n\n\nThe Catholic Church divides the territory of the municipality of São Paulo into four ecclesiastical circumscriptions: the Archdiocese of São Paulo, and the adjacent Diocese of Santo Amaro, the Diocese of São Miguel Paulista and the Diocese of Campo Limpo, the last three suffragans of the first. The archive of the archdiocese, called the Metropolitan Archival Dom Duarte Leopoldo e Silva, in the Ipiranga neighborhood, holds one of the most important documentary heritage in Brazil. The archiepiscopal is the Metropolitan Cathedral of São Paulo (known as Sé Cathedral), in Praça da Sé, considered one of the five largest Gothic temples in the world. The Catholic Church recognizes as patron saints of the city Saint Paul of Tarsus and Our Lady of Penha of France.[111]\n\n\nThe city has the most diverse Protestant or Reformed creeds, such as the Evangelical Community of Our Land, Maranatha Christian Church, Lutheran Church, Presbyterian Church, Methodist Church, Anglican Episcopal Church, Baptist churches, Assembly Church of God, The Seventh-day Adventist Church, the World Church of God's Power, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, the Christian Congregation in Brazil, among others, as well as Christians of various denominations.[111] \n\n\n\n### Public security[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Training of soldiers of the Military Police of São Paulo State at the Military Police Academy of Barro Branco\nAccording to the 2011 Global Homicide Survey released by the United Nations, in the period between 2004 and 2009 the homicide rate dropped from 20.8 to 10.8 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. The UN pointed to São Paulo as an example of how big cities can reduce crime. Crime rates, such as homicide, have been steadily declining for 8 years. The number of murders in 2007 was 63% lower than in 1999. Carandiru's 9th DP is considered one of the five best police stations in the world and the best in Latin America.\n\n\nIn 2008, the city of São Paulo ranked 493rd in the list of the most violent cities in Brazil. Among the capitals, it was the fourth least violent, registering, in 2006, homicide rates higher than those of Boa Vista, Palmas and Natal.\n\n\nIn a survey on the Adolescent Homicide Index (IHA), released in 2009, São Paulo ranked 151st among 267 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants. In November 2009, the Ministry of Justice and the Brazilian Forum of Public Security published a survey that pointed to São Paulo as the safest Brazilian capital for young people. Between 2000 and 2010, the city of São Paulo reduced its homicide rate by 78%. According to data from the Map of Violence 2011, published by the Sangari Institute and the Ministry of Justice, the city of São Paulo has the lowest homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants among all Brazilian capitals.\n\n\n\n### Social challenges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Social issues in Brazil\n\n![](image)Paraisópolis, the largest slum (*favela*) in the city, with residential buildings in the background\n![](image)Public housing in Heliópolis\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, São Paulo has been a major economic center in Latin America. During two World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports (from other regions of the state) were critically affected. This led wealthy coffee farmers to invest in industrial activities that turned São Paulo into Brazil's largest industrial hub.\n\n\n\n* Crime rates consistently decreased in the 21st century. The citywide homicide rate was 6.56 in 2019, less than a fourth of the 27.38 national rate.[112]\n* Air quality[47] has steadily increased during the modern era.\n* The two major rivers crossing the city, Tietê and Pinheiros, are highly polluted. A major project to clean up these rivers is underway.[32][33]\n* The Clean City Law or antibillboard, approved in 2007, focused on two main targets: anti-publicity and anti-commerce. Advertisers estimate that they removed 15,000 billboards and that more than 1,600 signs and 1,300 towering metal panels were dismantled by authorities.[113]\n* São Paulo metropolitan region, adopted vehicle restrictions from 1996 to 1998 to reduce air pollution during wintertime. Since 1997, a similar project was implemented throughout the year in the central area of São Paulo to improve traffic.[114]\n* There were more than 30,000 homeless people in 2021 according to official data. It increased by 31% in two years, and doubled in 20 years.[115]\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Brazil\n\nThe primary language is Portuguese. The general language from São Paulo General, or Tupi Austral (Southern Tupi), was the Tupi-based trade language of what is now São Vicente, São Paulo, and the upper Tietê River. In the 17th century it was widely spoken in São Paulo and spread to neighboring regions while in Brazil. From 1750 on, following orders from Marquess of Pombal, Portuguese language was introduced through immigration and consequently taught to children in schools. The original Tupi Austral language subsequently lost ground to Portuguese, and eventually became extinct. Due to the large influx of Japanese, German, Spanish, Italian and Arab immigrants etc., the Portuguese idiom spoken in the metropolitan area of São Paulo reflects influences from those languages.\n\n\n\n![](image)Museum of the Portuguese Language\nThe Italian influence in São Paulo accents is evident in the Italian neighborhoods such as Bela Vista, Mooca, Brás and Lapa. Italian mingled with Portuguese and as an old influence, was assimilated or disappeared into spoken language. The local accent with Italian influences became notorious through the songs of Adoniran Barbosa, a Brazilian samba singer born to Italian parents who used to sing using the local accent.[116]\n\n\nOther languages spoken in the city are mainly among the Asian community: São Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan. Although today most Japanese-Brazilians speak only Portuguese, some of them are still fluent in Japanese. Some people of Chinese and Korean descent are still able to speak their ancestral languages.[117] In some areas it is still possible to find descendants of immigrants who speak German[118] (especially in the area of Brooklin paulista) and Lithuanian or Russian or East European languages (especially in the area of Vila Zelina).[119][12] In the west zone of São Paulo, specially at Vila Anastácio and Lapa region, there is a Hungarian colony, with three churches (Calvinist, Baptist and Catholic), so on Sundays it is possible to see Hungarians talking to each other on sidewalks.\n\n\n\n### Sexual diversity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: LGBT rights in Brazil, LGBT people in Brazil, LGBT history in Brazil, and Same-sex marriage in Brazil\n\n![](image)The 18th edition of the São Paulo Gay Pride Parade in 2014\nThe Greater São Paulo is home to a prominent self-identifying gay, bisexual and transgender community, with 9.6% of the male population and 7% of the female population declaring themselves to be non-heterosexual.[120] Same-sex civil unions have been legal in the whole country since 5 May 2011, while same-sex marriage in São Paulo was legalized on 18 December 2012. Since 1997, the city has hosted the annual São Paulo Gay Pride Parade, considered the biggest pride parade in the world by the Guinness Book of World Records with over 5 million participants, and typically rivalling the New York City Pride March for the record.[16]\n\n\nStrongly supported by the State and the City of São Paulo government authorities, in 2010, the city hall of São Paulo invested R$1 million reais in the parade and provided a solid security plan, with approximately 2,000 policemen, two mobile police stations for immediate reporting of occurrences, 30 equipped ambulances, 55 nurses, 46 medical physicians, three hospital camps with 80 beds. The parade, considered the city's second largest event after the Formula One, begins at the São Paulo Museum of Art, crosses Paulista Avenue, and follows Consolação Street to Praça Roosevelt in Downtown São Paulo. According to the LGBT app Grindr, the gay parade of the city was elected the best in the world.[121]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Brazil and Brazilian science and technology\n\n![](image)University of São Paulo\nSão Paulo has public and private primary and secondary schools and vocational-technical schools. More than nine-tenths of the population are literate and roughly the same proportion of those age 7 to 14 are enrolled in school. There are 578 universities in the state of São Paulo.[122]\n\n\nThe city of São Paulo is also home to research and development facilities and attracts companies due to the presence of regionally renowned universities. Science, technology and innovation is leveraged by the allocation of funds from the state government, mainly carried out by means of the Foundation to Research Support in the State of São Paulo (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo – FAPESP), one of the main agencies promoting scientific and technological research.[123]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in Brazil\n\nSee also: Rede São Paulo Saudável\n\n![](image)Institute of Cancer of São Paulo, the largest oncology center in Latin America[124][125]\nSão Paulo is one of the largest health care hubs in Latin America. Among its hospitals are the Albert Einstein Israelites Hospital, ranked the best hospital in all Latin America[126] and the Hospital das Clínicas, the largest in the region, with a total area of 600,000 square meters and offers 2,400 beds, distributed among its eight specialized institutes and two assisting hospitals.[127]\n\n\nThe main hospitals in the city of São Paulo concentrate in the upper-income areas, the majority of the population of the city has a private health insurance. This can includes hospitals, private practices and pharmacies. The city of São Paulo has the largest number of foreigners comparing with any other Brazilian city and an intense health tourism. In Brazil, the city of São Paulo has the largest number of doctors who can speak more than one language, which in this case is Portuguese, with the secondary languages predominantly are English and Spanish.[128]\n\n\nThe private health care sector is very large and most of Brazil's best hospitals are in the city. As of September 2009, the city of São Paulo had: 32,553 ambulatory clinics, centers and professional offices (physicians, dentists and others); 217 hospitals, with 32,554 beds; 137,745 health care professionals, including 28,316 physicians.[129]\n\n\nThe municipal government operates public health facilities across the city's territory, with 770 primary health care units (UBS), ambulatory and emergency clinics and 17 hospitals. The Municipal Secretary of Health has 59,000 employees, including 8,000 physicians and 12,000 nurses. 6,000,000 citizens uses the facilities, which provide drugs at no cost and manage an extensive family health program (PSF – Programa de Saúde da Família).[130]\n\n\nThe Sistema Integrado de Gestão de Assistência à Saúde de São Paulo – SIGA Saúde (*Integrated Health Care Management System in São Paulo*) has been operating in the city of São Paulo since 2004. Today there are more than 22 million registered users, including the people of the Greater São Paulo, with a monthly average of 1.3 million appointments.[130]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mayors of São Paulo\n\n![](image)Matarazzo Building, the São Paulo city hall\n![](image)Municipal Chamber of São Paulo\n![](image)Bandeirantes Palace, the seat of state government\nAs the capital of the state of São Paulo, the city is home to the Bandeirantes Palace (state government) and the Legislative Assembly. The Executive Branch of the municipality of São Paulo is represented by the mayor and his cabinet of secretaries, following the model proposed by the Federal Constitution.[131] The organic law of the municipality and the Master Plan of the city, however, determine that the public administration must guarantee to the population effective tools of manifestation of participatory democracy, which causes that the city is divided in regional prefectures, each one led by a Regional Mayor appointed by the Mayor.[132]\n\n\nThe legislative power is represented by the Municipal Chamber, composed of 55 aldermen elected to four-year posts (in compliance with the provisions of Article 29 of the Constitution, which dictates a minimum number of 42 and a maximum of 55 for municipalities with more than five million inhabitants). It is up to the house to draft and vote fundamental laws for the administration and the Executive, especially the municipal budget (known as the Law of Budgetary Guidelines).[133] In addition to the legislative process and the work of the secretariats, there are also a number of municipal councils, each dealing with different topics, composed of representatives of the various sectors of organized civil society. The actual performance and representativeness of such councils, however, are sometimes questioned.\n\n\nThe following municipal councils are active: Municipal Council for Children and Adolescents (CMDCA); of Informatics (WCC); of the Physically Disabled (CMDP); of Education (CME); of Housing (CMH); of Environment (CADES); of Health (CMS); of Tourism (COMTUR); of Human Rights (CMDH); of Culture (CMC); and of Social Assistance (COMAS) and Drugs and Alcohol (COMUDA). The Prefecture also owns (or is the majority partner in their social capital) a series of companies responsible for various aspects of public services and the economy of São Paulo:\n\n\n\n* *São Paulo Turismo S/A* (SPTuris): company responsible for organizing large events and promoting the city's tourism.\n* *Companhia de Engenharia de Tráfego* (CET):[134] subordinated to the Municipal Transportation Department, is responsible for traffic supervision, fines (in cooperation with DETRAN) and maintenance of the city's road system.\n* *Companhia Metropolitana de Habitação de São Paulo* (COHAB): subordinate to the Department of Housing, is responsible for the implementation of public housing policies, especially the construction of housing developments.\n* *Empresa Municipal de Urbanização de São Paulo* (EMURB): subordinate to the Planning Department, is responsible for urban works and for the maintenance of public spaces and urban furniture.\n* *Companhia de Processamento de Dados de São Paulo* (PRODAM): responsible for the electronic infrastructure and information technology of the city hall.\n* *São Paulo Transportes Sociedade Anônima* (SPTrans): responsible for the operation of the public transport systems managed by the city hall, such as the municipal bus lines.\n\n\n### Subdivisions[edit]\n\n\nSão Paulo is divided into 32 subprefectures, each with an administration (\"subprefeitura\") divided into several districts (\"distritos\").[132] The city also has a radial division into nine zones for purpose of traffic control and bus lines, which do not fit into the administrative divisions. These zones are identified by colors in the street signs. The historical core of São Paulo, which includes the inner city and the area of Paulista Avenue, is in the Subprefecture of Sé. Most other economic and tourist facilities of the city are inside an area officially called *Centro Expandido* (Portuguese for \"Broad Center\", or \"Broad Downtown\"), which includes Sé and several other subprefectures, and areas immediately around it.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Subprefectures of São Paulo[135] |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Subprefecture\n | Area\n | Population\n |  |  | Subprefecture\n | Area\n | Population\n |\n| 1\n | **Aricanduva/Vila Formosa** | 21.5 km2 | 266 838\n | ![](image) | 17\n | **Mooca** | 35.2 km2 | 305 436\n |\n| 2\n | **Butantã** | 56.1 km2 | 345 943\n | 18\n | **Parelheiros** | 353.5 km2 | 110 909\n |\n| 3\n | **Campo Limpo** | 36.7 km2 | 508 607\n | 19\n | **Penha** | 42.8 km2 | 472 247\n |\n| 4\n | **Capela do Socorro** | 134.2 km2 | 561 071\n | 20\n | **Perus** | 57.2 km2 | 109 218\n |\n| 5\n | **Casa Verde/Cachoeirinha** | 26.7 km2 | 313 176\n | 21\n | **Pinheiros** | 31.7 km2 | 270 798\n |\n| 6\n | **Cidade Ademar** | 30.7 km2 | 370 759\n | 22\n | **Pirituba/Jaraguá** | 54.7 km2 | 390 083\n |\n| 7\n | **Cidade Tiradentes** | 15 km2 | 248 762\n | 23\n | **Sé** | 26.2 km2 | 373 160\n |\n| 8\n | **Ermelino Matarazzo** | 15.1 km2 | 204 315\n | 24\n | **Santana/Tucuruvi** | 34.7 km2 | 327 279\n |\n| 9\n | **Freguesia do Ó/Brasilândia** | 31.5 km2 | 391 403\n | 25\n | **Jaçanã/Tremembé** | 64.1 km2 | 255 435\n |\n| 10\n | **Guaianases** | 17.8 km2 | 283 162\n | 26\n | **Santo Amaro** | 37.5 km2 | 217 280\n |\n| 11\n | **Ipiranga** | 37.5 km2 | 427 585\n | 27\n | **São Mateus** | 45.8 km2 | 422 199\n |\n| 12\n | **Itaim Paulista** | 21.7 km2 | 358 888\n | 28\n | **São Miguel Paulista** | 24.3 km2 | 377 540\n |\n| 13\n | **Itaquera** | 54.3 km2 | 488 327\n | 29\n | **Sapopemba** | 13.4 km2 | 296 042\n |\n| 14\n | **Jabaquara** | 14.1 km2 | 214 200\n | 30\n | **Vila Maria/Vila Guilherme** | 26.4 km2 | 302 899\n |\n| 15\n | **Lapa** | 40.1 km2 | 270 102\n | 31\n | **Vila Mariana** | 26.5 km2 | 311 019\n |\n| 16\n | **M'Boi Mirim** | 62.1 km2 | 523 138\n | 32\n | **Vila Prudente** | 33.3 km2 | 480 823\n |\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Brazil\n\nSão Paulo is twinned with:[136]\n\n\n\n* ![Ivory Coast](image) Abidjan, Ivory Coast\n* ![Paraguay](image) Asunción, Paraguay\n* ![Spain](image) Barcelona, Spain\n* ![Portugal](image) Belmonte, Portugal\n* ![Romania](image) Cluj-Napoca, Romania\n* ![Cuba](image) Havana, Cuba\n* ![Turkey](image) İzmir, Turkey\n* ![Peru](image) Lima, Peru\n* ![Macau](image) Macau, China\n* ![United States](image) Miami-Dade County, United States\n* ![Italy](image) Milan, Italy\n* ![Japan](image) Osaka, Japan\n* ![Bolivia](image) La Paz, Bolivia\n* ![Spain](image) San Cristóbal de La Laguna, Spain\n* ![Chile](image) Santiago, Chile\n* ![Spain](image) Santiago de Compostela, Spain\n* ![South Korea](image) Seoul, South Korea\n* ![China](image) Shanghai, China\n* ![Armenia](image) Yerevan, Armenia\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of São Paulo, Economy of the state of São Paulo, and Economy of Brazil\n\n![](image)\nB3, the largest stock exchange of Latin America by market capitalization\n![](image)\nPaulista Avenue, the headquarters of many financial and cultural institutions\n![](image)\nPeople's Park in Itaim Bibi, in the region of the Brigadeiro Faria Lima Avenue\n![](image)\nUnited Nations Business Center at Brooklin Novo\n![](image)\nOscar Freire St., one of the most luxurious streets in the world[137]\n\nSão Paulo is considered the \"financial capital of Brazil\", as it is the location for the headquarters of major corporations and of banks and financial institutions. São Paulo is Brazil's highest GDP city and one of the largest in the world,[138][139]\n\n\nAccording to data from the IBGE, its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010 was R$450 billion,[140] approximately\nUS$220 billion, 12.26% of Brazilian GDP and 36% of all production of goods and services of the State of São Paulo.[141]\n\n\nAccording to PricewaterhouseCoopers average annual economic growth of the city is 4.2%.[142] São Paulo also has a large \"informal\" economy.[143] In 2005, the city of São Paulo collected R$90 billion in taxes and the city budget was R$15 billion. The city has 1,500 bank branches and 70 shopping malls.[144]\n\n\nAs of 2014[update], São Paulo is the third largest exporting municipality in Brazil after Parauapebas, PA and Rio de Janeiro, RJ. In that year São Paulo's exported goods totaled $7.32B (USD) or 3.02% of Brazil's total exports. The top five commodities exported by São Paulo are soybean (21%), raw sugar (19%), coffee (6.5%), sulfate chemical wood pulp (5.6%), and corn (4.4%).[145]\n\n\nThe São Paulo Stock Exchange (BM&F Bovespa) is Brazil's official stock and bond exchange. It is the largest stock exchange in Latin America, trading about R$6 billion (US$3.5 billion) every day.[146]\n\n\nSão Paulo's economy is going through a deep transformation. Once a city with a strong industrial character, São Paulo's economy has followed the global trend of shifting to the tertiary sector of the economy, focusing on services. The city is unique among Brazilian cities for its large number of foreign corporations.[147]\n\n\n63% of all the international companies with business in Brazil have their head offices in São Paulo. São Paulo has one of the largest concentrations of German businesses worldwide[148] and is the largest Swedish industrial hub alongside Gothenburg.[149]\n\n\nSão Paulo ranked second after New York in FDi magazine's bi-annual ranking of Cities of the Future 2013–14 in the Americas, and was named the Latin American City of the Future 2013–14, overtaking Santiago de Chile, the first city in the previous ranking. Santiago now ranks second, followed by Rio de Janeiro.[150]\n\n\nThe per capita income for the city was R$32,493 in 2008.[151] According to Mercer's 2011 city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, São Paulo is now among the ten most expensive cities in the world, ranking 10th in 2011, up from 21st in 2010 and ahead of London, Paris, Milan and New York City.[152][153]\n\n\nLuxury brands tend to concentrate their business in São Paulo. Because of the lack of department stores and multi-brand boutiques, shopping malls as well as the Jardins district attract most of the world's luxurious brands. Most of the international luxury brands can be found in the Iguatemi, Cidade Jardim or JK shopping malls or on the streets of Oscar Freire, Lorena or Haddock Lobo in the Jardins district. They are home of brands such as Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Tiffany & Co. Cidade Jardim was opened in São Paulo in 2008, it is a 45,000-square-meter (484,376-square-foot) mall, landscaped with trees and greenery scenario, with a focus on Brazilian brands but also home to international luxury brands such as Hermès, Jimmy Choo, Pucci and Carolina Herrera. Opened in 2012, JK shopping mall has brought to Brazil brands that were not present in the country before such as Goyard, Tory Burch, Llc., Prada, and Miu Miu.[154]\n\n\nThe Iguatemi Faria Lima, in Faria Lima Avenue, is Brazil's oldest mall, opened in 1966.[155] The Jardins neighborhood is regarded among the most sophisticated places in town, with upscale restaurants and hotels. The New York Times once compared Oscar Freire Street to Rodeo Drive.[156] In Jardins there are luxury car dealers. One of the world's best restaurants as elected by The World's 50 Best Restaurants Award, D.O.M.,[157] is there.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in the city of São Paulo\n\n![](image)\nIbirapuera Park, elected the best in South America by TripAdvisor[158]\n![](image)\nRoda Rico, the tallest observation wheel in Latin America[159]\n\nLarge hotel chains whose target audience is the corporate traveler are in the city. São Paulo is home to 75% of the country's leading business fairs. The city also promotes one of the most important fashion weeks in the world, São Paulo Fashion Week, established in 1996 under the name Morumbi Fashion Brasil, is the largest and most important fashion event in Latin America.[160] Besides, the São Paulo Gay Pride Parade, held since 1997 on Paulista Avenue is the event that attracts more tourists to the city.[161]\n\n\nThe annual March For Jesus is a large gathering of Christians from Protestant churches throughout Brazil, with São Paulo police reporting participation in the range of 350,000 in 2015.[162] In addition, São Paulo hosts the annual São Paulo Pancake Cook-Off in which chefs from across Brazil and the world participate in competitions based on the cooking of pancakes.[163]\n\n\nCultural tourism also has relevance to the city, especially when considering the international events in the metropolis, such as the São Paulo Art Biennial, that attracted almost 1 million people in 2004.\n\n\nThe city has a nightlife that is considered one of the best in the country, and is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.[164] There are cinemas, theaters, museums, and cultural centers. The Rua Oscar Freire was named one of the eight most luxurious streets in the world, according to the Mystery Shopping International,[165] and São Paulo the 25th \"most expensive city\" of the planet.[166]\n\n\nAccording to the International Congress & Convention Association, São Paulo ranks first among the cities that host international events in Americas and the 12th in the world, after Vienna, Paris, Barcelona, Singapore, Berlin, Budapest, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Seoul, Lisbon, and Copenhagen.[167] According to a study by MasterCard in 130 cities around the world, São Paulo was the third most visited destination in Latin America (behind Mexico City and Buenos Aires) with 2.4 million foreign travelers, who spent US$2.9 billion in 2013 (the highest among the cities in the region). In 2014, CNN ranked nightlife São Paulo as the fourth best in the world, behind New York City, Berlin and Ibiza, in Spain.[168]\n\n\nThe cuisine of the region is a tourist attraction. The city has 62 cuisines across 12,000 restaurants.[169] During the 10th International Congress of Gastronomy, Hospitality and Tourism (Cihat) conducted in 1997, the city received the title of \"World Gastronomy Capital\" from a commission formed by 43 nations' representatives.[170]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of the city at night from Ibirapuera Park\n\n## Urban infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Octávio Frias de Oliveira Bridge aside of *Centro Empresarial Nações Unidas*\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, São Paulo has been one of the main economic centers of Latin America. With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make São Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, São Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980. The rapid population growth has brought many problems for the city.\n\n\nSão Paulo is practically all served by the water supply network. The city consumes an average of 221 liters of water/inhabitant/day while the UN recommends the consumption of 110 liters/day. The water loss is 30.8%. However, between 11 and 12.8% of households do not have a sewage system, depositing waste in pits and ditches. Sixty percent of the sewage collected is treated. According to data from IBGE and Eletropaulo, the electricity grid serves almost 100% of households. The fixed telephony network is still precarious, with coverage of 67.2%. Household garbage collection covers all regions of the municipality but is still insufficient, reaching around 94% of the demand in districts such as Parelheiros and Perus. About 80% of the garbage produced daily by Paulistas is exported to other cities, such as Caieiras and Guarulhos.[173] Recycling accounts for about 1% of the 15,000 metric tons of waste produced daily.[173]\n\n\n\n### Urban planning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Changes in urban fabrics in the region of Jardins: side by side, vertical areas and low houses\n![](image)Martinelli Building was the first skyscraper of Latin America and the tallest until 1947.\n![](image)The city view from Altino Arantes Building\n![](image)Pinheiros River in Santo Amaro district\nSão Paulo has a myriad of urban fabrics. The original nuclei of the city are vertical, characterized by the presence of commercial buildings and services; And the peripheries are generally developed with two to four-story buildings – although such generalization certainly meets with exceptions in the fabric of the metropolis. Compared to other global cities (such as the island cities of New York City and Hong Kong), however, São Paulo is considered a \"low-rise building\" city. Its tallest buildings rarely reach forty stories, and the average residential building is twenty. Nevertheless, it is the fourth city in the world in quantity of buildings, according to the page specialized in research of data on buildings *Emporis Buildings*,[174] besides possessing what was considered until 2014 the tallest skyscraper of the country, the Mirante do Vale, also known as *Palácio Zarzur Kogan*, with 170 meters of height and 51 floors.[175]\n\n\nSuch tissue heterogeneity, however, is not as predictable as the generic model can make us imagine. Some central regions of the city began to concentrate indigents, drug trafficking, street vending and prostitution, which encouraged the creation of new socio-economic centralities. The characterization of each region of the city also underwent several changes throughout the 20th century. With the relocation of industries to other cities or states, several areas that once housed factory sheds have become commercial or even residential areas.[176]\n\n\nSão Paulo has a history of actions, projects and plans related to urban planning that can be traced to the governments of Antonio da Silva Prado, Baron Duprat, Washington and Luis Francisco Prestes Maia. However, in general, the city was formed during the 20th century, growing from village to metropolis through a series of informal processes and irregular urban sprawl.[177]\n\n\nUrban growth in São Paulo has followed three patterns since the beginning of the 20th century, according to urban historians: since the late 19th century and until the 1940s, São Paulo was a condensed city in which different social groups lived in a small urban zone separated by type of housing; from the 1940s to the 1980s, São Paulo followed a model of center-periphery social segregation, in which the upper and middle-classes occupied central and modern areas while the poor moved towards precarious, self-built housing in the periphery; and from the 1980s onward, new transformations have brought the social classes closer together in spatial terms, but separated by walls and security technologies that seek to isolate the richer classes in the name of security.[178] Thus, São Paulo differs considerably from other Brazilian cities such as Belo Horizonte and Goiânia, whose initial expansion followed determinations by a plan, or a city like Brasília, whose master plan had been fully developed prior to construction.[179]\n\n\nThe effectiveness of these plans has been seen by some planners and historians as questionable. Some of these scholars argue that such plans were produced exclusively for the benefit of the wealthier strata of the population while the working classes would be relegated to the traditional informal processes. In São Paulo until the mid-1950s, the plans were based on the idea of \"demolish and rebuild\", including former Mayor Francisco Prestes Maia's road plan for São Paulo (known as the Avenues Plan) or Saturnino de Brito's plan for the Tietê River. The Plan of the Avenues was implemented during the 1920s and sought to build large avenues connecting the city center with the outskirts. This plan included renewing the commercial city center, leading to real estate speculation and gentrification of several downtown neighborhoods. The plan also led to the expansion of bus services, which would soon replace the trolley as the preliminary transportation system.[180] This contributed to the outwards expansion of São Paulo and the peripherization of poorer residents. Peripheral neighborhoods were usually unregulated and consisted mainly of self-built single-family houses.[178]\n\n\nIn 1968 the Urban Development Plan proposed the Basic Plan for Integrated Development of São Paulo, under the administration of Figueiredo Ferraz. The main result was zoning laws. It lasted until 2004 when the Basic Plan was replaced by the current Master Plan.[181] That zoning, adopted in 1972, designated \"Z1\" areas (residential areas designed for elites) and \"Z3\" (a \"mixed zone\" lacking clear definitions about their characteristics). Zoning encouraged the growth of suburbs with minimal control and major speculation.[182] After the 1970s peripheral lot regulation increased and infrastructure in the periphery improved, driving land prices up. The poorest and the newcomers now could not purchase their lot and build their house, and were forced to look for a housing alternative. As a result, favelas and precarious tenements (cortiços) appeared.[183] These housing types were often closer to the city's center: favelas could sprawl in any unused terrain (often dangerous or unsanitary) and decaying or abandoned buildings for tenements were abundant inside the city. Favelas went back into the urban perimeter, occupying the small lots not yet occupied by urbanization – alongside polluted rivers, railways, or between bridges.[184] By 1993, 19.8% of São Paulo's population lived in favelas, compared to 5.2% in 1980.[185] Today, it is estimated that 2.1 million Paulistas live in favelas, which represents about 11% of the metropolitan area's population.[186]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of Central Zone of São Paulo from Italy Building\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in São Paulo and Transport in Brazil\n\n#### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nBandeirantes Highway/SP-348\n![](image)\nMario Covas Beltway\n\nAutomobiles are the main means to get into the city. In March 2011, more than 7 million vehicles were registered.[187] Heavy traffic is common on the city's main avenues and traffic jams are relatively common on its highways.\n\n\nThe city is crossed by 10 major motorways: President Dutra Highway/BR-116 (connects São Paulo to the east and north-east of the country); Régis Bittencourt Highway/BR-116 (connects São Paulo to the south of the country); Fernão Dias Highway/BR-381 (connects São Paulo to the north of the country); Anchieta Highway/SP-150 (connects São Paulo to the ocean coast); Immigrants Highway/SP-150 (connects São Paulo to the ocean coast); President Castelo Branco Highway/SP-280 (connects São Paulo to the west and north-west of the country); Raposo Tavares Highway/SP-270 (connects São Paulo to the west of the country); Anhanguera Highway/SP-330 (connects São Paulo to the north-west of the country, including its capital city); Bandeirantes Highway/SP-348 (connects São Paulo to the north-west of the country); Ayrton Senna Highway/SP-70 (named after Brazilian legendary Formula One driver Ayrton Senna, the motorway connects São Paulo to east locations of the state, as well as the north coast of the state).\n\n\nThe Rodoanel Mário Covas (official designation SP-021) is the beltway of the Greater São Paulo. Upon its completion, it will have a length of 177 km (110 mi), with a radius of approximately 23 km (14 mi) from the geographical center of the city. It was named after Mário Covas, who was mayor of the city of São Paulo (1983–1985) and a state governor (1994-1998/1998-2001) until his death from cancer. It is a controlled access highway with a speed limit of 100 km/h (62 mph) under normal weather and traffic circumstances. The west, south and east parts are completed, and the north part, which will close the beltway, is due in 2022 and is being built by DERSA.[188]\n\n\n\n#### Airports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nSão Paulo–Congonhas Airport\n![](image)\nSão Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport\n\nSão Paulo has two main airports, São Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport for international flights and national hub, and São Paulo–Congonhas Airport for domestic and regional flights. Another airport, the Campo de Marte Airport, serves private jets and light aircraft. The three airports together moved more than 58.000.000 passengers in 2015, making São Paulo one of the top 15 busiest in the world, by number of air passenger movements. The region of Greater São Paulo is also served by Viracopos International Airport, São José dos Campos Airport and Jundiaí Airport.\n\n\nCongonhas Airport operates flights mainly to Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte and Brasília. Built in the 1930s, it was designed to handle the increasing demand for flights, in the fastest growing city in the world. Located in Campo Belo District, Congonhas Airport is close to the three main city's financial districts: Paulista Avenue, Brigadeiro Faria Lima Avenue and Engenheiro Luís Carlos Berrini Avenue.\n\n\nThe São Paulo–Guarulhos International, also known as \"Cumbica\", is 25 km (16 mi) north-east of the city center, in the neighboring city of Guarulhos. Every day nearly 110.000 people pass through the airport, which connects Brazil to 36 countries around the world. 370 companies operate there, generating more than 53.000 jobs. The international airport is connected to the metropolitan rail system, with Line 13 (CPTM).\n\n\nCampo de Marte is in Santana district, the northern zone of São Paulo. The airport handles private flights and air shuttles, including air taxi firms. Opened in 1935, Campo de Marte is the base for the largest helicopter fleet in Brazil and the world's, ahead of New York and Tokyo.[189] This airport is the home base of the State Civil Police Air Tactical Unit, the State Military Police Radio Patrol Unit and the São Paulo Flying Club.[190]\nFrom this airport, passengers can take advantage of some 350 remote helipads and heliports to bypass heavy road traffic.[191]\n\n\n\n#### Urban rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nMap of the 377 km (234 mi) urban rail network of the city (São Paulo Metro and CPTM)\n![](image)\nMonorail of the Line 15 (Silver) of the São Paulo Metro\n![](image)\nTrain of the Line 4 (Yellow) of the São Paulo Metro\n![](image)\nTrain of the CPTM at Luz Station\n\nMain articles: São Paulo Metro and Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos\n\nSão Paulo has an urban rail transit system (São Paulo Metro and CPTM) that serves 184 stations and has 377 km (234 mi) of track,[192] forming the largest metropolitan rail transport network of Latin America.[193] The underground and urban railway lines together carry some 7 million people on an average weekday.[194]\n\n\nThe São Paulo Metro operates 104 kilometers (65 mi) of rapid transit system, with six lines in operation, serving 91 stations.[195] In 2015, the metro reached the mark of 11.5 million passengers per mile of line, 15% higher than in 2008, when 10 million users were taken per mile. It is the largest concentration of people in a single transport system in the world, according to the company. In 2014, the São Paulo Metro was elected the best metro system in the Americas.[196]\n\n\nThe company ViaQuatro, a private concessionaire, operates the Line 4 of the metro system.[197] The Line 15 (Silver) is the first mass-transit monorail of the South America and the first system in the world to use the Bombardier Innovia Monorail 300. When fully completed will be the largest and highest capacity monorail system in the Americas and second worldwide, only behind to the Chongqing Monorail.[198]\n\n\nThe Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM, or \"Paulista Company of Metropolitan Trains\") railway add 273.0 km (169.6 mi) of commuter rail, with seven lines and 94 stations. The system carries about 2.8 million passengers a day. On 8 June 2018, CPTM set a weekday ridership record with 3,096,035 trips.[199] The Line 13 (Jade) of the CPTM connects São Paulo to the São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport, in the municipality of Guarulhos, the first major international airport in South America to be directly served by train.[200]\n\n\nCCR Group (through the ViaQuatro and ViaMobilidade concessionaires) operates subway lines 4–Yellow and 5–Lilac, in addition to managing (through the ViaMobilidade concessionaire) lines 8-Diamond and 9-Emerald of the metropolitan train system. Metro and metropolitan train networks transport an average of nearly 7 million people a day, while another 2 million passengers are transported by EMTU buses daily.[201]\n\n\nThe two major São Paulo railway stations are Luz and Júlio Prestes in the Luz/Campos Eliseos region. Julio Prestes Station connected Southwest São Paulo State and Northern Paraná State to São Paulo City. Agricultural products were transferred to Luz Station from which they headed to the Atlantic Ocean and overseas. Júlio Prestes stopped transporting passengers through the Sorocabana or FEPASA lines and now only has metro service. Due to its acoustics and interior beauty, surrounded by Greek revival columns, part of the rebuilt station was transformed into the São Paulo Hall.\n\n\nLuz Station was built in Britain and assembled in Brazil. It has an underground station and is still active with metro lines that link São Paulo to the Greater São Paulo region to the East and the Campinas Metropolitan region in Jundiaí in the western part of the State. Luz Station is surrounded by important cultural institutions such as the Pinacoteca do Estado, The Museu de Arte Sacra on Tiradentes Avenue and Jardim da Luz, among others. It is the seat of the Santos-Jundiaí line which historically transported international immigrants from the Port of Santos to São Paulo and the coffee plantation lands in the Western region of Campinas. São Paulo has no tram lines, although trams were common in the first half of the 20th century.[202]\n\n\n\n#### Buses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nSão Paulo has two independent trolleybus systems.[203]\n![](image)\nTietê Bus Terminal, the 2nd busiest bus terminal in the world, after PABT[204]\n\nMain articles: SPTrans, Empresa Metropolitana de Transportes Urbanos de São Paulo, and Trolleybuses in São Paulo\n\nBus transport (government and private) is composed of 17,000 buses (including about 290 trolley buses).[205] The traditional system of informal transport (dab vans) was later reorganized and legalized. The trolleybus systems provide a portion of the public transport service in Greater São Paulo with two independent netwoeks.[206][203] The SPTrans (São Paulo Transportes) system opened in 1949 and serves the city of São Paulo, while the Empresa Metropolitana de Transportes Urbanos de São Paulo (EMTU) system opened in 1988 and serves suburban areas to the southeast of the city proper. Worldwide, São Paulo is one of only two metropolitan areas possessing two independent trolleybus systems, the other being Naples, Italy.[203]\n\n\nSão Paulo Tietê Bus Terminal is the second largest bus terminal in the world, after PABT in New York.[204] It serves localities across the nation, with the exception of the states of Amazonas, Roraima and Amapá. Routes to 1,010 cities in five countries (Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay) are available. It connects to all regional airports and a ride sharing automobile service to Santos.[204]\n\n\nThe Palmeiras-Barra Funda Intermodal Terminal is much smaller and is connected to the Palmeiras-Barra Funda metro and Palmeiras-Barra Funda CPTM stations. It serves the southwestern cities of Sorocaba, Itapetininga, Itu, Botucatu, Bauru, Marília, Jaú, Avaré, Piraju, Santa Cruz do Rio Pardo, Ipaussu, Chavantes and Ourinhos (on the border with Paraná State). It also serves São José do Rio Preto, Araçatuba and other small towns on the northwest of São Paulo State.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Brazil\n\n![](image)Sala São Paulo, the home of the São Paulo State Symphony\nAdoniran Barbosa was a samba singer and composer who became successful during São Paulo's early radio era. Born in 1912 in the town of Valinhos, Barbosa was known as the \"composer to the masses\", particularly Italian immigrants living in the quarters of Bela Vista, also known as \"Bexiga\" and Brás, as well as those who lived in the city's many 'cortiços' or tenements. His songs drew from the life of urban workers, the unemployed and those who lived on the edge. His first big hit was \"Saudosa Maloca\" (\"Shanty of Fond Memories\" – 1951), wherein three homeless friends recall with nostalgia their improvised shanty home, which was torn down by the landowner to make room for a building. His 1964 Trem das Onze (\"The 11 pm Train\"), became one of the five best samba songs ever, the protagonist explains to his lover that he cannot stay any longer because he has to catch the last train to the Jaçanã suburb, for his mother will not sleep before he arrives home. Another important musician with a similar style is Paulo Vanzolini. Vanzolini is a PhD in biology and a part-time professional musician. He composed a song depicting a love murder scene in São Paulo called \"Ronda\".\n\n\n\n![](image)Ibirapuera Auditorium\n![](image)Titãs live at the Montevideo Rock 2018\nIn the late 1960s, a psychedelic rock band called Os Mutantes became popular. Their success is related to that of other tropicalia musicians. The group was known as very *paulistanos* in its behavior and clothing. Os Mutantes released five albums before lead singer Rita Lee departed in 1972 to join another group called Tutti Frutti. Although initially known only in Brazil, Os Mutantes became successful abroad after the 1990s. In 2000, *Tecnicolor*, an album recorded in the early 1970s in English by the band, was released with artwork designed by Sean Lennon.[207]\n\n\nIn the early 1980s, a band called *Ultraje a Rigor* (Elegant Outrage) emerged. They played a simple and irreverent style of rock. The lyrics depicted the changes in society and culture that Brazilian society was experiencing. A late punk and garage scene became strong in the 1980s, perhaps associated with the gloomy scenario of unemployment during an extended recession. Bands originating from this movement include Ira!, Titãs, Ratos de Porão and Inocentes. In the 1990s, drum and bass arose as another musical movement in São Paulo, with artists such as DJ Marky, DJ Patife, XRS, Drumagick and Fernanda Porto.[208] Many heavy metal bands also originated in São Paulo, such as Angra, Project46, Torture Squad, Korzus and Dr. Sin. Famous electro-pop band Cansei de Ser Sexy, or CSS (Portuguese for \"tired of being sexy\") also has its origins in the city.\n\n\nMany of the most important classical Brazilian living composers, such as Amaral Vieira, Osvaldo Lacerda and Edson Zampronha, were born and live in São Paulo. Local baritone Paulo Szot has won international acclaim performing for six consecutive seasons at The Metropolitan Opera, La Scala and Opera de Paris, among others; and The Tony Award for best actor in a musical for his performance in a 2008 revival of *South Pacific*. The São Paulo State Symphony is one of the world's outstanding orchestras; their artistic director beginning in 2012 is the noted American conductor Marin Alsop. In 1952, Heitor Villa-Lobos wrote his Symphony Number 10 ('Ameríndia') for the 400th anniversary of São Paulo: an allegorical, historical and religious account of the city told through the eyes of its founder José de Anchieta.[209]\n\n\nSão Paulo's opera houses are: São Paulo Municipal Theater, Theatro São Pedro and Alfa Theater, for the symphonic concerts there is the Sala São Paulo, the latter being the headquarters of OSESP, an orchestra. The city hosts several music halls. The main ones are: Citibank Hall, HSBC Music Hall, Olympia, Via Funchal, Villa Country, Arena Anhembi and Espaco das Américas. The Anhembi Sambadrome hosts musical presentations as well, in addition to the Carnival of São Paulo. Other facilities include the new Praça das Artes, with the Municipal Conservatory of Music Chamber Hall and others venues, like, Cultura Artistica, Teatro Sérgio Cardoso with a venue for only dance performances and Herzog & DeMeron's Centro Cultural Luz, for Ballet, Opera, theater and concerts, with three huge halls. The auditorium of the Latin-American Cultural Center, The Mozarteum, holds concerts through the year. Festivals as the Virada Cultural (Cultural Overnight) happen once a year and holds hundreds of attractions spread throughout the city.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n2007 Virada Cultural, in Downtown São Paulo\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Literature of Brazil\n\n![](image)Mário de Andrade Library\n![](image)Livraria Cultura\nSão Paulo was home to the first Jesuit missionaries in Brazil, in the early 16th century. They wrote reports to the Portuguese crown about the newly found land, the native peoples and composed poetry and music for the catechism, creating the first written works from the area. The literary priests included Manuel da Nóbrega and José de Anchieta, living in or near the colony then called *Piratininga*. They also helped to register the Old Tupi language, lexicon and its grammar.\nIn 1922, the Brazilian Modernist Movement, launched in São Paulo, began to achieve cultural independence. Brazil had gone through the same stages of development as the rest of Latin America, but its political and cultural independence came more gradually.[210]\n\n\nBrazilian elite culture was originally strongly tied to Portugal. Gradually writers developed a multi-ethnic body of work that was distinctively Brazilian. The presence of large numbers of former slaves added a distinctive African character to the culture. Subsequent infusions of immigrants of non-Portuguese origin broadened the range of influences.[211]\n\n\nMário de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade were the prototypical modernists. With the urban poems of \"Paulicéia Desvairada\" and \"Carefree Paulistan land\" (1922), Mário de Andrade established the movement in Brazil. His rhapsodic novel *Macunaíma* (1928), with its abundance of Brazilian folklore, represents the apex of modernism's nationalist prose through its creation of an offbeat native national hero. Oswald de Andrade's experimental poetry, avant-garde prose, particularly the novel Serafim Ponte Grande (1933) and provocative manifestos exemplify the movement's break with tradition.[211]\n\n\nModernist artists and writers chose the Municipal Theatre of São Paulo to launch their Modernist manifesto. The site happened to be a bastion of European culture with opera and classical music presentations from Germany, France, Austria and Italy. They defied the high society that frequented the venue and who insisted on speaking only foreign languages such as French, behaving as if Brazilian culture did not matter.[211]\n\n\n\n### Theaters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Municipal Theatre of São Paulo\nMany historians believe that the first theatrical performance in Brazil was held in São Paulo. The Portuguese Jesuit missionary José de Anchieta (1534–1597) wrote short plays that were performed and watched by the Tupi–Guarani natives. In the second half of the 19th century a cultural, musical and theatrical life emerged. European ethnic groups began holding performances in some of the state's rural cities. The most important period for the art in São Paulo was the 1940s. São Paulo had had a professional company, Teatro Brasileiro de Comédia, (Brazilian Theater of Comedy), along with others.\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, major theater productions in São Paulo and Brazil were presented by two groups. Teatro de Arena began with a group of students from Escola de Arte Dramática (Drama Art School), founded by Alfredo Mesquita, in 1948. In 1958, the group excelled with the play \"Eles não usam black tie\" by Gianfrancesco Guarnieri which was the first in the history of the Brazilian drama to feature labor workers as protagonists.[212]\n\n\nAfter the military coup of 1964, plays started focusing on Brazilian history (Zumbi, Tiradentes). Teatro de Arena and Teatro Oficina supported the democratic resistance during the military dictatorship period, marked by its censorship. The Tropicalist movement began there. A number of plays represented historic moments, notably \"O Rei da Vela\", \"Galileu Galilei\" (1968), \"Na Selva das Cidades\" (1969) and \"Gracias Señor\" (1972).\n\n\nThe district of Bixiga concentrates the greatest number of theaters, around 40 including the theaters that are closed for refurbishing or for other reasons, and small alternatives companies venues. Some of the most important are Renault, Brigadeiro, Zaccaro, Bibi Ferreira, Maria della Costa, Ruth Escobar, Opera, TBC, Imprensa, Oficina, Àgora, Cacilda Becker, Sérgio Cardoso, do Bixiga, and Bandeirantes.\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nSão Paulo Museum of Art\n![](image)\nPinacotheca of the State of São Paulo\n![](image)\nIpiranga Museum\n![](image)\nLatin America Memorial\n![](image)\nSão Paulo Museum of Image and Sound\n![](image)\nFootball Museum at Pacaembu Stadium\n![](image)\nItaú Cultural\n\nSão Paulo has many neighborhoods and buildings of historical value.

Immigrant's Hostel was built in Brás to welcome the immigrants who arrived in Brazil through the Port of Santos, quarantining those who were sick and helping new arrivals to find work in coffee plantations in Western, Northern and Southwestern São Paulo State and Northern Paraná State. From 1882 to 1978, 2.5 million immigrants of more than 60 nationalities and ethnicities were guests there,[214] all of them duly registered in the museum's books and lists. The hostel hosted approximately 3,000 people on average, but occasionally reached 8,000. The hostel received the last immigrants in 1978.[215]\n\n\nIn 1998 the hostel became a museum, where it preserves the immigrants' documentation, memory and objects. Located in one of the few remaining centenarian buildings, the museum occupies part of the former hostel. The museum also restores wooden train wagons from the former São Paulo Railway. Two restored wagons inhabit the museum. One dates from 1914, while a second class passenger car dates from 1931. The museum records the names of all immigrants who were hosted there from 1888 to 1978.[216]\n\n\nMASP has one of world's most important collections of European art. The most important collections cover Italian and French painting schools. The museum was founded by Assis Chateaubriand and is directed by Pietro Maria Bardi. Its headquarters, opened in 1968, were designed by Lina Bo Bardi. MASP organizes temporary exhibitions in special areas. Brazilian and international exhibitions of contemporary arts, photography, design and architecture take turn during the whole year.[217]\n\n\nLocated next to the Luz metro station, the Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo was projected by architect Ramos de Azevedo in 1895. It was constructed to house an Arts Lyceum. In 1911, it became a museum, where it hosts a number of art exhibitions, such as bronze statues of French sculptor Auguste Rodin took place in 2001. There is also a permanent exhibition on the \"Resistance\" movement that took place during military dictatorship in the Republican period, including a reconstructed prison cell where political prisoners were kept.\n\n\nThe Oca (*oca* means thatched house in Native Brazilian Tupi-Guarani) is a white, spaceship-like building sitting in the greens of Ibirapuera Park. An exhibition place with more than 10 thousand square meters (0.11 million square feet). Modern art, Native Brazilian art, and photographie are some of the topics of past thematic exhibitions.\n\n\nMuseu da Imagem e do Som (*Image and Sound Museum*) preserves music, cinema, photography and graphical arts.

Lying on both sides of the Yamuna river, but chiefly to the west, or beyond its right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. Delhi became a union territory on 1 November 1956 and the NCT in 1995.[15] The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi).[5] According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million,[6][16] while the NCT's population was about 16.8 million.[7]\n\n\nDelhi's urban agglomeration, which includes the satellite cities Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon, Noida, Greater Noida, Meerut and YEIDA city in an area known as the National Capital Region (NCR), has an estimated population of over 28 million, making it the largest metropolitan area in India and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo).[8]\n\n\nThe topography of the medieval fort Purana Qila on the banks of the river Yamuna matches the literary description of the citadel Indraprastha in the Sanskrit epic *Mahabharata*; however, excavations in the area have revealed no signs of an ancient built environment. From the early 13th century until the mid-19th century, Delhi was the capital of two major empires, the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire, which covered large parts of South Asia. All three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the city, the Qutub Minar, Humayun's Tomb, and the Red Fort, belong to this period. Delhi was the early centre of Sufism and Qawwali music. The names of Nizamuddin Auliya and Amir Khusrau are prominently associated with it. The Khariboli dialect of Delhi was part of a linguistic development that gave rise to the literature of Urdu and later Modern Standard Hindi. Major Urdu poets from Delhi include Mir Taqi Mir and Mirza Ghalib. Delhi was a notable centre of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. In 1911, New Delhi, a southern region within Delhi, became the capital of the British Indian Empire. During the Partition of India in 1947, Delhi was transformed from a Mughal city to a Punjabi one, losing two-thirds of its Muslim residents, in part due to the pressure brought to bear by arriving Hindu and Sikh refugees from western Punjab.[17] After independence in 1947, New Delhi continued as the capital of the Dominion of India, and after 1950 of the Republic of India.\n\n\nDelhi ranks fifth among the Indian states and union territories in human development index,[18] and has the second-highest GDP per capita in India (after Goa).[19] Although a union territory, the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more closely resembles that of a state of India, with its own legislature, high court and an executive council of ministers headed by a chief minister. New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal government of India and the local government of Delhi, and serves as the capital of the nation as well as the NCT of Delhi. Delhi is also the centre of the National Capital Region, which is an \"interstate regional planning\" area created in 1985.[20][21] Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, the 1982 Asian Games, the 1983 Non-Aligned Movement summit, the 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, the 2010 Commonwealth Games, and the 2012 BRICS summit and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup and 2023 Cricket World Cup\n\n\n\n\n## Toponym[edit]\n\n\nThere are a number of myths and legends associated with the origin of the name *Delhi*. One of them is derived from *Dhillu* or *Dilu*, a king who built a city at this location in 50 BCE and named it after himself.[22][23][24] Another legend holds that the name of the city is based on the Prakrit word *dhili* (*loose*) and that it was used by the Tomaras to refer to the city because the iron pillar of Delhi had a weak foundation and had to be moved.[24] According to Panjab Notes and Queries, the name of the city at the time of King Prithviraj was *dilpat*, and that *dilpat* and *dilli* are probably derived from the old Hindi word *dil* meaning \"eminence\". The former director of the Archaeological Survey of India, Alexander Cunningham, mentioned that *dilli* later became *dihli/dehli*.[25] Some suggest the coins in circulation in the region under the Tomaras were called *dehliwal*.[26] According to the Bhavishya Purana, King Prithiviraja of Indraprastha built a new fort in the modern-day Purana Qila area for the convenience of all four castes in his kingdom. He ordered the construction of a gateway to the fort and later named the fort *dehali*.[27] Some historians believe that *Dhilli* or *Dhillika* is the original name for the city while others believe the name could be a corruption of the Hindustani words *dehleez* or *dehali*—both terms meaning \"threshold\" or \"gateway\"—and symbolic of the city as a gateway to the Gangetic Plain.[28][29]\n\n\nThe people of Delhi are referred to as *Delhiites* or *Dilliwalas*.[30] The city is referenced in various idioms of the Northern Indo-Aryan languages. Examples include:\n\n\n\n* *Abhī Dillī dūr hai* (अभी दिल्ली दूर है / ابھی دلی دور ہے) or its Persian version, *Hanuz Dehli dur ast* (هنوز دهلی دور است), literally meaning \"Delhi is still far away\", which is generically said about a task or journey still far from completion.[31][32]\n* *Ās-pās barse, Dillī pānī tarse* (आस-पास बरसे, दिल्ली पानी तरसे / آس پاس برسے، دلی پانی ترسے), literally meaning \"It pours all around, while Delhi lies parched\". An allusion to the sometimes semi-arid climate of Delhi, it idiomatically refers to situations of deprivation when one is surrounded by plenty.[32]\n\n\nThe form *Delhi*, spelled in the Latin script with the *h* following the *l*, originated under colonial rule and is an alternation of the spelling based on the Urdu name of the city (دہلی, *Dehli*).[33]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Delhi and Old Delhi\n\n### Ancient and Early Medieval Periods[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The walls of the 16th-century Purana Qila built on a mound matching ancient literary descriptions[34] Traditionally seven cities have been associated with the region of Delhi. The earliest, Indraprastha, is part of a literary description in the Sanskrit epic *Mahabharata* (composed c. 400 BCE to 200 CE but describing an earlier time) which situates a city on a knoll on the banks of the river Yamuna. According to art historian Catherine B. Asher, the topographical description of the *Mahabharata* matches the area of Purana Qila, a 14th-century CE fort of the Delhi sultanate, but the analogy does not go much further. Whereas the *Mahabharata* speaks of a beautifully decorated city with surrounding fortification, the excavations have yielded \"uneven findings of painted grey pottery characteristic of the eleventh century BCE; no signs of a built environment, much fewer fortifications, have been revealed.\"[34]\n\n\nThe earliest architectural relics date back to the Maurya period (c. 300 BCE); in 1966, an inscription of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (273–235 BCE) was discovered near Srinivaspuri. Remains of several major cities can be found in Delhi. The first of these was in the southern part of present-day Delhi. Tomara Rajput King Anang Pal built the Lal Kot and several temples in 1052 CE. The Chauhan Rajputs under Vigraharaja IV conquered Lal Kot in the mid-12th century and renamed it Qila Rai Pithora.\n\n\n\n### Late Medieval Period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Delhi Sultanate\n\n![](image)The Qutub Minar, Delhi\nPrithviraj Chauhan was defeated in 1192 by Muhammad Ghori in the second battle of Tarain. Qutb-ud-din Aibak, was given the responsibility of governing the conquered territories of India after Ghori returned to his capital, Ghor. When Ghori died without an heir in 1206 CE, Qutb-ud-din assumed control of Ghori's Indian possessions and laid the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mamluk dynasty. He began construction of the Qutb Minar and Quwwat-al-Islam (Might of Islam) mosque, the earliest extant mosque in India. It was his successor, Iltutmish (1211–1236), who consolidated the Turkic conquest of northern India.[22][35] At 72.5 m (238 ft), the Qutb Minar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Delhi,[36] was completed during the reign of Sultan Illtutmish in the 13th century. Although its style has some similarities with the Jarkurgan minaret, it is more closely related to the Ghaznavid and Ghurid minarets of Central Asia[37] Razia, daughter of Iltutmish, became the Sultana of Delhi upon the former's death.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFor the next three hundred years, Delhi was ruled by a succession of Turkic and an Afghan, Lodi dynasty. They built several forts and townships that are part of the seven cities of Delhi.[38] Delhi was a major centre of Sufism during this period.[39] The Mamluk Sultanate (Delhi) was overthrown in 1290 by Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji (1290–1320). Under the second Khalji ruler, Ala-ud-din Khalji, the Delhi sultanate extended its control south of the Narmada River in the Deccan. The Delhi sultanate reached its greatest extent during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughluq (1325–1351). In an attempt to bring the whole of the Deccan under control, he moved his capital to Daulatabad, Maharashtra in central India. However, by moving away from Delhi he lost control of the north and was forced to return to Delhi to restore order. The southern provinces then broke away. In the years following the reign of Firoz Shah Tughlaq (1351–1388), the Delhi Sultanate rapidly began to lose its hold over its northern provinces. Delhi was captured and sacked by Timur in 1398,[40] who massacred 100,000 captive civilian.[41] Delhi's decline continued under the Sayyid dynasty (1414–1451), until the sultanate was reduced to Delhi and its hinterland. Under the Afghan Lodi dynasty (1451–1526), the sultanate recovered control of Punjab and the Gangetic plain to once again achieve domination over Northern India. However, the recovery was short-lived and the sultanate was destroyed in 1526 by Babur, founder of the Mughal dynasty.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Early Modern Period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mughal Empire\n\n![Red Fort with the Indian Flag at the centre](image)Red Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was the main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years.\nIn 1526, Babur, a descendant of Genghis Khan and Timur from the Fergana Valley in modern-day Uzbekistan, invaded India and defeated the last Lodhi sultan in the First Battle of Panipat and founded the Mughal Empire that ruled from Delhi and Agra.[22] The Mughal dynasty ruled Delhi for more than three centuries, with a sixteen-year hiatus during the reigns of Sher Shah Suri and Hemu from 1540 to 1556.[42] Shah Jahan built the seventh city of Delhi that bears his name *Shahjahanabad*, which served as the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1638 and is today known as the *Old City* or *Old Delhi*.[43]\n\n\nAfter the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal Empire's influence declined rapidly as the Hindu Maratha Empire from Deccan Plateau rose to prominence.[44] In 1737, Maratha forces led by Baji Rao I sacked Delhi following their victory against the Mughals in the First Battle of Delhi. In 1739, the Mughal Empire lost the huge Battle of Karnal in less than three hours against the numerically outnumbered but militarily superior Persian army led by Nader Shah of Persia. After his invasion, he completely sacked and looted Delhi, carrying away immense wealth including the Peacock Throne, the Daria-i-Noor, and Koh-i-Noor. The Mughals, severely further weakened, could never overcome this crushing defeat and humiliation which also left the way open for more invaders to come, including eventually the British.[45][46][47] Nader eventually agreed to leave the city and India after forcing the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah I to beg him for mercy and granting him the keys of the city and the royal treasury.[48] A treaty signed in 1752 made Marathas the protectors of the Mughal throne in Delhi.[49] The city was sacked again in 1757 by the forces of Ahmad Shah Durrani, although it was not annexed by the Afghan Empire and being its vassal state under the Mughal emperor. Then the Marathas battled and won control of Delhi from the Mughals.[50] By the end of the century, Delhi had also come under control of the Bharatpur State and the Sikh Empire.\n\n\n\n### Colonial Period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: British Raj\n\n![](image)British India stamps, inauguration, New Delhi, February 1931\nIn 1803, during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, the forces of British East India Company defeated the Maratha forces in the Battle of Delhi.[51] During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Delhi fell to the forces of East India Company after a bloody fight known as the Siege of Delhi. The city came under the direct control of the British Government in 1858. It was made a district province of the Punjab.[22] In 1911, it was announced that the capital of British-held territories in India was to be transferred from Calcutta to Delhi.[52] This formally transferred on 12 December 1911.[53]\n\n\nThe name \"New Delhi\" was given in 1927, and the new capital was inaugurated on 13 February 1931. New Delhi was officially declared as the capital of the Union of India after the country gained independence on 15 August 1947.[54] It has expanded since; the small part of it that was constructed during the British period has come to be informally known as *Lutyens' Delhi*.[55]\n\n\n\n### Partition and post-independence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Khan Market in New Delhi, now a high-end shopping district, was established in 1951 to help refugees of the Partition of India, especially those from the North West Frontier Province (NWFP). It honours Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan, chief minister of NWFP during the Partition.[56][57]\nDuring the partition of India, around five hundred thousand Hindu and Sikh refugees, mainly from West Punjab fled to Delhi, while around three hundred thousand Muslim residents of the city migrated to Pakistan.[58][59] Ethnic Punjabis are believed to account for at least 40% of Delhi's total population and are predominantly Hindi-speaking Punjabi Hindus.[60][61][62] Migration to Delhi from the rest of India continues (as of 2013[update]), contributing more to the rise of Delhi's population than the birth rate, which is declining.[63]\n\n\nThe States Reorganisation Act, 1956 created the Union Territory of Delhi from its predecessor, the *Chief Commissioner's Province of Delhi*.[1][2] The Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 declared the Union Territory of Delhi to be formally known as the National Capital Territory of Delhi.[3] The Act gave Delhi its legislative assembly along Civil lines, though with limited powers.[3]\n\n\nDelhi was the primary site in the nationwide anti-Sikh pogroms of 1984, which resulted in the death of around 2,800 people in the city according to government figures, though independent estimates of the number of people killed tend to be higher. The riots were set off by the assassination of Indira Gandhi—the Prime Minister of India at the time—by her Sikh bodyguards.[64]\n\n\nIn 2001, the Parliament of India building in New Delhi was attacked by armed militants, killing six security personnel.[65] India suspected Pakistan-based Jihadist militant groups were behind the attack, which caused a major diplomatic crisis between the two countries.[66] There were further terrorist attacks in Delhi in 2005 and 2008, resulting in a total of 92 deaths.[67][68] In 2020, Delhi witnessed worst communal violence in decades. The riots, caused mainly by Hindu mobs attacking Muslims,[69][70] 53 people were killed, two-thirds were Muslims,[71][72][73] and the rest Hindus.[72]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environment of Delhi\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Delhi in April 2016 with river Yamuna in top-right\nDelhi is located in Northern India, at 28°37′N 77°14′E﻿ / ﻿28.61°N 77.23°E﻿ / 28.61; 77.23. The city is bordered on its northern, western, and southern sides by the state of Haryana and to the east by that of Uttar Pradesh (UP). Two prominent features of the geography of Delhi are the Yamuna flood plains and the Delhi ridge. The Yamuna River was the historical boundary between Punjab and UP, and its flood plains provide fertile alluvial soil suitable for agriculture but are prone to recurrent floods. The Yamuna, a sacred river in Hinduism, is the only major river flowing through Delhi. The Hindon River separates Ghaziabad from the eastern part of Delhi. The Delhi ridge originates from the Aravalli Range in the south and encircles the west, northeast, and northwest parts of the city. It reaches a height of 318 m (1,043 ft) and is a dominant feature of the region.[74]\n\n\nIn addition to the wetlands formed by the Yamuna river, Delhi continues to retain over 500 ponds (wetlands < 5 ha (12 acres)), that in turn support considerable number of bird species.[75] Delhi's ponds, despite experiencing ecological deterioration due to garbage dumping and concretisation, supports the largest number of bird species known to be using ponds anywhere in the world.[76] Existing policy in Delhi prevents the conversion of wetlands and, quite inadvertently, has led to the city's ponds becoming invaluable refugia for birds.[75][76]\n\n\nThe National Capital Territory of Delhi covers an area of 1,483 km2 (573 sq mi), of which 783 km2 (302 sq mi) is designated rural, and 700 km2 (270 sq mi) urban therefore making it the largest city in terms of area in the country. It has a length of 51.9 km (32 mi) and a width of 48.48 km (30 mi).[*citation needed*] Delhi is included in India's seismic zone-IV, indicating its vulnerability to major earthquakes.[77]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Climate of Delhi\n\nDelhi features a dry winter humid subtropical climate (Köppen *Cwa*) bordering a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen *BSh*). The warm season lasts from 21 March to 15 June with an average daily high temperature above 39 °C (102 °F). The hottest day of the year is usually witnessed between 26 and 30 May, with an average high of 42 °C (108 °F) and low of 27 °C (81 °F).[78] The cold season lasts from 26 November to 9 February with an average daily high temperature below 20 °C (68 °F). The coldest day of the year is usually witnessed between 16 and 20 January, with an average low of 7 °C (45 °F) and high of 20 °C (68 °F).[78] In early March, the wind direction changes from north-westerly to south-westerly. From April to October the weather is hot. The monsoon arrives at the end of June, along with an increase in humidity.[*citation needed*] The brief, mild winter starts in late November, peaks in January and heavy fog often occurs.[79]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for New Delhi (Safdarjung) 1991–2020, extremes 1901–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 32.5(90.5)\n | 34.1(93.4)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n | 45.6(114.1)\n | 47.2(117.0)\n | 46.7(116.1)\n | 45.0(113.0)\n | 42.0(107.6)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n | 39.4(102.9)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 47.2(117.0)\n |\n| Mean maximum °C (°F)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n | 41.4(106.5)\n | 44.3(111.7)\n | 43.7(110.7)\n | 40.1(104.2)\n | 37.4(99.3)\n | 37.1(98.8)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 32.2(90.0)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 44.8(112.6)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 20.1(68.2)\n | 24.2(75.6)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 36.5(97.7)\n | 39.9(103.8)\n | 39.0(102.2)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 34.2(93.6)\n | 34.1(93.4)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 31.4(88.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 13.9(57.0)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 29.1(84.4)\n | 32.7(90.9)\n | 33.3(91.9)\n | 31.5(88.7)\n | 30.4(86.7)\n | 29.6(85.3)\n | 26.2(79.2)\n | 20.5(68.9)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 10.6(51.1)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 27.7(81.9)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 26.7(80.1)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n |\n| Mean minimum °C (°F)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 6.0(42.8)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 20.5(68.9)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 23.7(74.7)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 4.5(40.1)\n | 3.1(37.6)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −0.6(30.9)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n | 4.4(39.9)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 20.7(69.3)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 0.0(32.0)\n | −0.6(30.9)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 19.1(0.75)\n | 21.3(0.84)\n | 17.4(0.69)\n | 16.3(0.64)\n | 30.7(1.21)\n | 74.1(2.92)\n | 209.7(8.26)\n | 233.1(9.18)\n | 123.5(4.86)\n | 15.1(0.59)\n | 6.0(0.24)\n | 8.1(0.32)\n | 774.4(30.5)\n |\n| Average rainy days\n | 1.7\n | 1.5\n | 1.7\n | 1.0\n | 2.7\n | 4.8\n | 9.7\n | 10.2\n | 5.5\n | 0.8\n | 0.4\n | 0.6\n | 40.6\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%) (at 17:30 IST) | 57\n | 46\n | 37\n | 25\n | 28\n | 43\n | 63\n | 68\n | 60\n | 47\n | 52\n | 59\n | 49\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | 8(46)\n | 11(52)\n | 14(57)\n | 14(57)\n | 18(64)\n | 22(72)\n | 26(79)\n | 25(77)\n | 23(73)\n | 18(64)\n | 14(57)\n | 10(50)\n | 17(62)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 220.1\n | 223.2\n | 248.0\n | 276.0\n | 285.2\n | 219.0\n | 179.8\n | 176.7\n | 219.0\n | 260.4\n | 246.0\n | 220.1\n | 2,773.5\n |\n| Mean daily sunshine hours | 7.1\n | 7.9\n | 8.0\n | 9.2\n | 9.2\n | 7.3\n | 5.8\n | 5.7\n | 7.3\n | 8.4\n | 8.2\n | 7.1\n | 7.6\n |\n| Mean daily daylight hours | 10.6\n | 11.2\n | 12.0\n | 12.9\n | 13.6\n | 13.9\n | 13.8\n | 13.1\n | 12.3\n | 11.5\n | 10.7\n | 10.3\n | 12.2\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 67\n | 71\n | 67\n | 71\n | 68\n | 53\n | 42\n | 44\n | 59\n | 73\n | 77\n | 69\n | 63\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 3\n | 5\n | 6\n | 7\n | 9\n | 9\n | 8\n | 7\n | 6\n | 5\n | 4\n | 3\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: India Meteorological Department (sun 1971–2000);[80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87][88][89][90][91][92][93] Time and Date (dewpoints, 2005–2015)[94] Revised Rainfall data[95] |\n| Source 2: Tokyo Climate Center (mean temperatures 1991–2020);[96] Weather Atlas (UV Index)[97](Daylight)[98] |\n\n### Air pollution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Environmental issues in Delhi and Air pollution in Delhi\n\n![](image)A dense toxic smog in Delhi blocking out the sun, November 2017\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), Delhi was the most polluted[99] city in the world in 2014. In 2016, WHO downgraded Delhi to eleventh-worst in the urban air quality database.[100] According to one estimate, air pollution causes the death of about 10,500 people every year.[101][102][103] Air quality index is generally moderate (101–200) level between January and September, and then it drastically deteriorates to Very Poor (301–400), Severe (401–500) or Hazardous (500+) levels in three months between October and December,[104][105] due to various factors including stubble burning (a type of biomass burning), fire crackers burning during Diwali and cold weather.[106][107][108] During 2013–14, peak levels of fine particulate matter (PM) increased by about 44%, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions, construction work and crop burning in adjoining states.[101][109][110][111] It has the highest level of the airborne particulate matter, PM2.5 considered most harmful to health, with 153 micrograms.[112]\n\n\nRising air pollution level has significantly increased lung-related ailments (especially asthma and lung cancer) among Delhi's children and women.[113][114] The dense smog and haze during winter results in major air and rail traffic disruptions every year.[115] According to Indian meteorologists, the average maximum temperature during winters has declined notably since 1998 due to rising air pollution.[116]\n\n\nIndia's Ministry of Earth Sciences published a research paper in October 2018 attributing almost 41% of PM2.5 air pollution in Delhi to vehicular emissions, 21.5% to dust/fire and 18% to industries.[117] The director of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) alleged that the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) is lobbying \"against the report\" because it is \"inconvenient\" to the automobile industry.[118] Environmentalists have also criticised the Delhi government for not doing enough to curb air pollution and to inform people about air quality issues.[102] In 2014, an environmental panel appealed to India's Supreme Court to impose a 30% cess on diesel cars, but till date no action has been taken to penalise the automobile industry.[119]\n\n\nMost of Delhi's residents are unaware of alarming levels of air pollution in the city and the health risks associated with it.[110][111] In 2020, annual average PM2.5 in the city stood at 107.6 µg/m³, which is almost 21.5 times the WHO's PM2.5 Guideline (5 µg/m³; set in September 2021).[120] These pollution levels are estimated to reduce the life expectancy of an average person living in Delhi by almost 10.1 years.[120]\n\n\nHowever, as of 2015[update], awareness, particularly among the foreign diplomatic community and high-income Indians, was noticeably increasing.[121] Since the mid-1990s, Delhi has undertaken some measures to curb air pollution—it has the third-highest quantity of trees among Indian cities;[122] the Delhi Transport Corporation operates the world's largest fleet of environmentally friendly compressed natural gas (CNG) buses.[123] In 1996, the CSE started a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court of India that ordered the conversion of Delhi's fleet of buses and taxis to run on CNG and banned the use of leaded petrol in 1998. In 2003, Delhi won the United States Department of Energy's first 'Clean Cities International Partner of the Year' award for its \"bold efforts to curb air pollution and support alternative fuel initiatives\".[123] The Delhi Metro has also been credited for significantly reducing air pollutants in the city.[124]\n\n\nHowever, according to several authors, most of these gains have been lost, especially due to stubble burning, a rise in the market share of diesel cars and a considerable decline in bus ridership.[125][126] According to CSE and System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), burning of agricultural waste in nearby Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh regions results in severe intensification of smog over Delhi.[127][128]\n\n\n\n## Civic administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Districts of Delhi, Neighbourhoods of Delhi, and List of towns in National Capital Territory of Delhi\n\n![](image)Logo of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi\n![](image)Districts of Delhi\nCurrently, the NCT of Delhi is made up of one division, 11 districts, 33 subdivisions, 59 census towns, and 300 villages.[129]\n\n\n\n![](image)Municipalities of Delhi\nOn the other way, the NCT of Delhi is divided into three municipalities. The boundaries of municipalities may be different from district boundaries:\n\n\n\n1. Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), which occupies an area of 1397.3 km2 and is sub-divided into 12 zones, that is, Centre, South, West, Najafgarh, Rohini, Civil Lines, Karol Bagh, SP-City, Keshavpuram, Narela, Shahdara North and Shahdara South.[130]\n2. New Delhi Municipality , which occupies an area of 42.7 km2\n3. Delhi Cantonment, which occupies an area of 42.3 km2\n\n\nBetween 13 January 2011 and 22 May 2022, MCD was divided into three municipal corporations:[131]\n\n\n\n1. South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) had jurisdiction over South and West Delhi areas, including Mahipalpur, Rajouri Garden, Uttam Nagar, Badarpur, Jaitpur, Janakpuri, Hari Nagar, Tilak Nagar, Dwarka, Jungpura, Greater Kailash, R K Puram, Malviya Nagar, Kalkaji, Ambedkar Nagar and Pul pehladpur.\n2. North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) had jurisdiction over areas such as Badli, Rithala, Bawana, Kirari, Mangolpuri, Tri Nagar, Model Town, Sadar Bazar, Chandni Chowk, Matia Mahal, Karol Bagh, Moti Nagar\n3. East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) had jurisdiction over areas such as Patparganj, Kondli, Laxmi Nagar, Seemapuri, Gonda, Karawal Nagar, Babarpur and Shahadra.[132]\n\n\nDelhi is home to the High Court of Delhi. The High Court of Delhi is the highest in the Delhi before Supreme Court. The High Court of Delhi just like the apex court and other High Courts in India is the Court of record. Delhi is also home to various District Court according to jurisdictions. Delhi have Currently seven District Courts namely Tis Hazari Court Complex, Karkardooma Court Complex, Patiala House Court Complex, Rohini Court Complex, Dwarka Courts Complex, Saket Court Complex, and Rouse Avenue Court \nApart from the District Courts Delhi also have Consumer Courts, CBI Courts, Labour Courts, Revenue Courts, Army tribunals, electricity tribunals, Railway Tribunals, and other various tribunals situated according to appropriate jurisdictions.[133][134]\n\n\nFor policing purposes Delhi is divided into fifteen police districts which are further subdivided into 95 local police station zones. Delhi currently has 180 police stations.[135][136]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Delhi and Government of India\n\n![](image)\nArvind Kejriwal is the seventh and current Chief Minister of Delhi, first elected in February 2015.\n![](image)\nDelhi Legislative Assembly\n\nAs a first-level administrative division, the National Capital Territory of Delhi has its own Legislative Assembly, Lieutenant Governor, the council of ministers, and Chief Minister. Members of the legislative assembly are directly elected from territorial constituencies in the NCT. The legislative assembly was abolished in 1956, after which direct federal control was implemented until it was re-established in 1993. The Municipal corporation handles civic administration for the city as part of the Panchayati Raj Act. The Government of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi jointly administer New Delhi, where both bodies are located. The Parliament of India, the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Palace), Cabinet Secretariat, and the Supreme Court of India are located in the municipal district of New Delhi. There are 70 assembly constituencies and seven Lok Sabha (Indian parliament's lower house) constituencies in Delhi.[137][138]\nThe Indian National Congress (Congress) formed all the governments in Delhi until the 1990s, when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Madan Lal Khurana, came to power.[139] In 1998, the Congress returned to power under the leadership of Sheila Dikshit, who was subsequently re-elected for 3 consecutive terms. But in 2013, the Congress was ousted from power by the newly formed Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) led by Arvind Kejriwal forming the government with outside support from the Congress.[140] However, that government was short-lived, collapsing only after 49 days.[141] Delhi was then under President's rule until February 2015.[142] On 10 February 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party returned to power after a landslide victory, winning 67 out of the 70 seats in the Delhi Legislative Assembly.[143]\nOn 8 February 2020, Aam Aadmi Party surged to power in Delhi for a third term, boosted by a massive mandate of 62 seats.[144]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Delhi\n\n![](image)\nThe Khari Baoli market in Old Delhi is one of the oldest and busiest in the city.\n![](image)\nConnaught Place in New Delhi is an important economic hub of the National Capital Region.\n\nDelhi is the largest commercial center in northern India. As of 2016[update] recent estimates of the economy of the Delhi urban area have ranged from $370 billion to $400 billion (PPP metro GDP) ranking it either the most or second-most productive metro area of India.[145] The nominal GSDP of the NCT of Delhi for 2016–17 was estimated at ₹6,224 billion (US$75 billion), 13% higher than in 2015–16.[146][147]\n\n\nAs per the Economic survey of Delhi (2005–2006), the tertiary sector contributes 70.95% of Delhi's gross SDP followed by secondary and primary sectors with 25.20% and 3.85% contributions, respectively.[148] Delhi's workforce constitutes 32.82% of the population, and increased by 52.52% between 1991 and 2001.[149] Delhi's unemployment rate decreased from 12.57% in 1999–2000 to 4.63% in 2003.[149] In December 2004, 636,000 people were registered with various employment exchange programmes in Delhi.[149]\n\n\nIn 2018 the total workforce in national and state governments and the quasi-government sector was 594,000, and the private sector employed 273,000.[150] Key service industries are information technology, telecommunications, hotels, banking, media and tourism.[151] Construction, power, health and community services and real estate are also important to the city's economy. Delhi has one of India's largest and fastest growing retail industries.[152] Manufacturing also grew considerably as consumer goods companies established manufacturing units and headquarters in the city. Delhi's large consumer market and the availability of skilled labour has also attracted foreign investment. In 2001, the manufacturing sector employed 1,440,000 workers and the city had 129,000 industrial units.[153]\n\n\n\n## Utility services[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bhalswa landfill\n\nDelhi's municipal water supply is managed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB). As of June 2005[update], it supplied 650 million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the estimated consumption requirement is 963 MGD.[154] The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240 MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage.[154] Research on Delhi suggests that up to half of the city's water use is unofficial groundwater.[155]  \nIn Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000 tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD.[156] The daily domestic waste water production is 470 MGD and industrial waste water is 70 MGD.[157] A large portion of the sewage flows untreated into the Yamuna river.[157]\n\n\nThe city's electricity consumption is about 1,265 kWh per capita but the actual demand is higher.[158] In Delhi power distribution is managed by TPDDL and BSES Yamuna & BSES Rajdhani since 2002. The Delhi Fire Service runs 43 fire stations that attend about 15,000 fire and rescue calls per year.[159] The state-owned BSNL and private enterprises such as Airtel, Vi, Jio, and provide telephone and cell phone services to the city. Cellular coverage is available in GSM, CDMA, 3G, 4G and 4G+.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Delhi\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\n![Shown here is the check-in counter at Terminal 3 of the airport.](image)Indira Gandhi International Airport's immigration counter in Terminal 3[160]\nIndira Gandhi International Airport, situated to the south-west of Delhi, is the main gateway for the city's domestic and international civilian air traffic. In 2015–16, the airport handled more than 48 million passengers,[161] making it the busiest airport in India and South Asia. Terminal 3, which cost ₹96.8 billion (US$1.2 billion) to construct between 2007 and 2010, handles an additional 37 million passengers annually.[162] In 2010, IGIA was conferred the 4th best airport award in the world in the 15–25 million category, by Airports Council International. The airport was rated as the *Best airport in the world* in the 25–40 million passengers category in 2015, by Airports Council International. Delhi Airport was awarded *The Best Airport in Central Asia* and *Best Airport Staff in Central Asia* at the Skytrax World Airport Awards 2015.[163][164] Hindon Domestic Airport in Ghaziabad was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the second airport for the Delhi-NCR Region on 8 March 2019.[165] A second international airport open for commercial flights has been suggested either by expansion of Meerut Airport or construction of a new airport in Greater Noida.[166]\nThe Taj International Airport project in Jewar has been approved by the Uttar Pradesh government.[167]\n\n\nThe *Delhi Flying Club*, established in 1928 with two de Havilland Moth aircraft named *Delhi* and *Roshanara*, was based at Safdarjung Airport which started operations in 1929, when it was the Delhi's only airport and the second in India.[168] The airport functioned until 2001; however, in January 2002 the government closed the airport for flying activities because of security concerns following the New York attacks in September 2001. Since then, the club only carries out aircraft maintenance courses and is used for helicopter rides to Indira Gandhi International Airport for VIP including the president and the prime minister.[168][169]\n\n\n\n### Road[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nCompressed natural gas red- and green buses have low floors; orange has standard.[b]\n![](image)\nThe cycle rickshaw and the auto rickshaw are commonly used in Delhi for travelling short distances.\n\nDelhi has the highest road density of 2103 km/100 km2 in India.[171] It is connected to other parts of India by five National Highways: NH 1, NH 2, NH 8, NH 10 and NH 24. The Delhi–Mumbai and Delhi–Kolkata prongs of the Golden Quadrilateral start from the city. The majority of the city's roads which are 60 ft. wide or above are maintained by the Public Works Department (PWD)[172] which is under the jurisdiction of the Government of Delhi while some are maintained by Delhi Development Authority and New Delhi Municipal Council[173] which are under the jurisdiction of the Government of India. Roads and streets less than 60 ft wide are maintained by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. Roads and streets in unauthorised colonies are maintained by the local Member of the Legislative Assembly.[174]\n\n\nBuses are the most popular means of road transport catering to about 60% of Delhi's total demand.[175] Delhi has one of India's largest bus transport systems. In 1998, the Supreme Court of India ruled that all public transport vehicles in Delhi must be fuelled by compressed natural gas (CNG) to tackle increasing vehicular pollution.[176] The state-owned Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) is a major bus service provider which operates the world's largest fleet of CNG-fuelled buses.[177][178] In addition, cluster scheme buses are operated by Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) with the participation of private concessionaires and DTC.[179][180] In December 2017, the DTC and cluster buses carried over 4.19 million passengers per day.[181] Kashmiri Gate ISBT, Anand Vihar ISBT and Sarai Kale Khan ISBT are the main bus terminals for outstation buses plying to neighbouring states. Delhi's rapid rate of economic development and population growth has resulted in an increasing demand for transport, creating excessive pressure on the city's transport infrastructure. To meet the transport demand, the State and Union government constructed a mass rapid transit system, including the Delhi Metro.[182] Delhi Bus Rapid Transit System runs between Ambedkar Nagar and Delhi Gate.\n\n\nPersonal vehicles especially cars also form a major chunk of vehicles plying on Delhi roads. As of 2007[update], private vehicles account for 30% of the total demand for transport.[182] Delhi has the highest number of registered cars compared to any other metropolitan city in India.[183] Taxis, auto rickshaws, and cycle rickshaws also ply on Delhi roads in large numbers. As of 2008[update], the number of vehicles in the metropolitan region, Delhi NCR, was 11.2 million (11.2 million).[184] In 2008, there were 85 cars in Delhi for every 1,000 of its residents.[185] In 2017, the number of vehicles in Delhi city alone crossed the ten million mark with the transport department of Delhi Government putting the total number of registered vehicles at 10,567,712 until 25 May of the year.[186]\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A passenger train at the New Delhi railway station. Freight awaits pick up or transportation to other destinations.\nDelhi is a major junction in the Indian railway network and is the headquarters of the Northern Railway. The main railway stations are New Delhi, Old Delhi, Hazrat Nizamuddin, Anand Vihar, Delhi Sarai Rohilla and Delhi Cantt.[182] The Delhi Metro, a mass rapid transit system built and operated by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), serves many parts of Delhi and the neighbouring cities Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida.[187] As of December 2021[update], the metro consists of ten operational lines with a total length of 348.12 km (216.31 mi) and 254 stations, and several other lines are under construction.[188] The Phase-I was built at a cost of US$2.3 billion and the Phase-II was expected to cost an additional ₹216 billion (US$2.6 billion).[189] Phase-II has a total length of 128 km and was completed by 2010.[190] Delhi Metro completed 10 years of operation on 25 December 2012. It carries millions of passengers every day.[191] In addition to the Delhi Metro, a suburban railway, the Delhi Suburban Railway exists.[192]\n\n\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Delhi Metro is widely used in the NCR.\nThe Delhi Metro is a rapid transit system serving Delhi, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida in the National Capital Region of India. It is the world's tenth-largest metro system by length of lines. It was India's second modern public transportation system. The network consists of 10 colour-coded lines[193] serving 255 stations[c] with a total length of 348.12 kilometres (216.31 mi).[d] The system has a mix of underground, at-grade, and elevated stations using both broad-gauge and standard-gauge. All stations have escalators, lifts, and tactile tiles to guide the visually impaired from station entrances to trains. There are 18 designated parking sites at the Metro stations. In March 2010, DMRC partnered with Google India (through Google Transit) to provide train schedule and route information to mobile devices with Google Maps.\nIt has a combination of elevated, at-grade, and underground lines, and uses both broad gauge and standard gauge rolling stock. Four types of rolling stock are used: Mitsubishi–ROTEM Broad gauge, Bombardier MOVIA, Mitsubishi–ROTEM Standard gauge, and CAF Beasain Standard gauge. The Phase-I of Delhi Metro was built for US$2.3 billion and the Phase-II was expected to cost an additional ₹216 billion (US$2.6 billion).[189] Phase-II has a total length of 128 km and was completed by 2010.[190] Delhi Metro completed 10 years of operation on 25 December 2012. It carries millions of passengers every day.[191]\n\n\nAlthough the Delhi Metro was built and is operated by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC), a state-owned company with equal equity participation of the governments of India and Delhi, it is under the administrative control of the Indian government's Ministry of Urban Development. Besides the construction and operation of the Delhi Metro, DMRC is also involved in the planning and implementation of metro rail, monorail, and high-speed rail projects in India and providing consultancy services to other metro projects in the country as well as abroad.\n\n\n\n### Regional Rapid Transit System[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Namo Bharat trainsets in Duhai\nDelhi is also going to be connected with India's first regional rail metro corridor. The first such system Delhi–Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This system has the capacity to run at 180KMph.[196]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Ethnic groups in Delhi\n\n![](image)NCT of Delhi population pyramid in 2011\nAccording to the 2011 census of India, the population of the NCT of Delhi is 16,753,235.[197] The corresponding population density was 11,297 persons per km2 with a sex ratio of 866 women per 1000 men, and a literacy rate of 86.34%. In 2004, the birth rate, death rate and infant mortality rate per 1000 population were 20.03, 5.59 and 13.08, respectively.[198] In 2001, the population of Delhi increased by 285,000 as a result of migration and by 215,000 as a result of natural population growth,[198] which made Delhi one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Dwarka Sub City, Asia's largest planned residential area, is located within the National Capital Territory of Delhi.[199] Urban expansion has resulted in Delhi's urban area now being considered as extending beyond the NCT boundaries to incorporate the towns and cities of neighbouring states including Faridabad and Gurgaon in Haryana, and Ghaziabad and Noida in Uttar Pradesh, the total population of which is estimated by the United Nations to be over 28 million. According to the UN this makes Delhi urban area the world's second-largest urban area after Tokyo,[8] although Demographia declares the Jakarta urban area to be the second-largest.[200] The 2011 census provided two figures for urban area population: 16,314,838 within the NCT boundary,[201] and 21,753,486 for the *Extended Urban Area*.[202] The 2021 regional plan released by the Government of India renamed the *Extended Urban Area* from *Delhi Metropolitan Area (DMA)* as defined by the 2001 plan,[203] to *Central National Capital Region (CNCR)*.[203][204] Around 49% of the population of Delhi lives in slums and unauthorised colonies without any civic amenities.[205] The majority of these slums have inadequate provisions to the basic facilities and according to a DUSIB report, almost 22% of the people do open defecation.[206]\n\n\n\n* ![The Birla temple in Delhi with its towers.](image)\n\nThe Hindu Laxminarayan Mandir was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi in 1933.\n* ![The Jama Masjid was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan between 1650 and 1656.](image)\n\nThe Jama Masjid was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan between 1650 and 1656.\n* ![The prayer hall of Sikh Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib in Chandni Chowk, Old Delhi which dates to 1783](image)\n\nThe prayer hall of Sikh Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib in Chandni Chowk, Old Delhi which dates to 1783\n\n\nReligions in Delhi (2011)\n\n\n\nHinduism (81.68%)\nIslam (12.86%)\nSikhism (3.40%)\nJainism (0.99%)\nChristianity (0.87%)\nBuddhism (0.11%)\nOthers (0.09%)\n\nHinduism is Delhi's predominant religious faith, with 81.68% of Delhi's population, followed by Islam (12.86%), Sikhism (3.40%), Jainism (0.99%), Christianity (0.87%), and Buddhism (0.11%).[207] Other minority religions include Zoroastrianism, Baháʼísm and Judaism.[208]\n\n\n\n\n\nReligious groups in Delhi (1891−2011)[e]\n| Religiousgroup\n | 1891[211]: 68 | 1901[212]: 44 | 1911[209]: 20 | 1921[213]: 30 | 1931[214]: 119 | 1941[210]: 80 | 2011[207] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % |\n| Hinduism ![](image) | 108,058\n | 56.11%\n | 114,417\n | 54.86%\n | 121,735\n | 52.28%\n | 325,551\n | 66.65%\n | 400,302[f] | 62.92%\n | 567,264[f] | 61.8%\n | 13,712,100\n | 81.68%\n |\n| Islam ![](image) | 79,238\n | 41.15%\n | 88,460\n | 42.41%\n | 102,476\n | 44.01%\n | 141,758\n | 29.02%\n | 206,960\n | 32.53%\n | 304,971\n | 33.22%\n | 2,158,684\n | 12.86%\n |\n| Jainism ![](image) | 3,256\n | 1.69%\n | 3,266\n | 1.57%\n | 3,531\n | 1.52%\n | 4,698\n | 0.96%\n | 5,345\n | 0.84%\n | 11,287\n | 1.23%\n | 166,231\n | 0.99%\n |\n| Christianity ![](image) | 1,700\n | 0.88%\n | 2,164\n | 1.04%\n | 3,075\n | 1.32%\n | 13,320\n | 2.73%\n | 16,989\n | 2.67%\n | 17,475\n | 1.9%\n | 146,093\n | 0.87%\n |\n| Sikhism ![](image) | 289\n | 0.15%\n | 229\n | 0.11%\n | 1,939\n | 0.83%\n | 2,764\n | 0.57%\n | 6,437\n | 1.01%\n | 16,157\n | 1.76%\n | 570,581\n | 3.4%\n |\n| Zoroastrianism ![](image) | 31\n | 0.02%\n | 35\n | 0.02%\n | 74\n | 0.03%\n | 72\n | 0.01%\n | 126\n | 0.02%\n | 284\n | 0.03%\n | —\n | —\n |\n| Judaism ![](image) | 6\n | 0%\n | —\n | —\n | 7\n | 0%\n | 17\n | 0%\n | 11\n | 0%\n | 55\n | 0.01%\n | —\n | —\n |\n| Buddhism ![](image) | 0\n | 0%\n | 0\n | 0%\n | 0\n | 0%\n | 6\n | 0%\n | 76\n | 0.01%\n | 150\n | 0.02%\n | 18,449\n | 0.11%\n |\n| Others\n | 1\n | 0%\n | 4\n | 0%\n | 0\n | 0%\n | 2\n | 0%\n | 0\n | 0%\n | 296\n | 0.03%\n | 15,803\n | 0.09%\n |\n| Total population\n | 192,579\n | 100%\n | 208,575\n | 100%\n | 232,837\n | 100%\n | 488,452\n | 100%\n | 636,246\n | 100%\n | 917,939\n | 100%\n | 16,787,941\n | 100%\n |\n\n\nAccording to the 50th report of the commissioner for linguistic minorities in India, which was submitted in 2014, Hindi is Delhi's most spoken language, with 80.94% speakers, followed by Punjabi (7.14%), Urdu (6.31%) and Bengali (1.50%). 4.11% of Delhites speak other languages.[215] Hindi is also the official language of Delhi while Urdu and Punjabi have been declared as additional official languages.[215]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Culture of India\n\n![](image)\nTraditional pottery on display in *Dilli Haat*\n![](image)\nPragati Maidan hosts the *World Book Fair* biennially.\n\nDelhi's culture has been influenced by its lengthy history and historic association as the capital of India. Although a strong Punjabi Influence can be seen in language, Dress and Cuisine brought by the large number of refugees who came following the partition in 1947 the recent migration from other parts of India has made it a melting pot. This is exemplified by many significant monuments in the city. The Archaeological Survey of India recognises 1,200 heritage buildings[216] and 175 monuments as national heritage sites.[217]\n\n\nIn the Old City, the Mughals and the Turkic rulers constructed several architecturally significant buildings, such as the Jama Masjid—India's largest mosque[218] built in 1656[219] and the Red Fort. Three World Heritage Sites—the Red Fort, Qutub Minar and Humayun's Tomb—are located in Delhi.[220] Other monuments include the India Gate, the Jantar Mantar—an 18th-century astronomical observatory—and the Purana Qila—a 16th-century fortress. The Laxminarayan Temple, Akshardham temple, Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, the Baháʼí Faith's Lotus Temple and the ISKCON temple are examples of modern architecture. Raj Ghat and associated memorials houses memorials of Mahatma Gandhi and other notable personalities. New Delhi houses several government buildings and official residences reminiscent of British colonial architecture, including the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Secretariat, Rajpath, the Parliament of India and Vijay Chowk. Safdarjung's Tomb is an example of the Mughal gardens style. Some regal *havelis* (palatial residences) are in the Old City.[221] Lotus Temple is a Baháʼí House of Worship completed in 1986. Notable for its flowerlike shape, it serves as the Mother Temple of the Indian subcontinent and has become a prominent attraction in the city. The National Museum and National Gallery of Modern Art are some of the largest museums in the country. Other museums in Delhi include the National Museum of Natural History, National Rail Museum and National Philatelic Museum.\n\n\nChandni Chowk, a 17th-century market, is one of the most popular shopping areas in Delhi for jewellery and *Zari* saris.[222] Delhi's arts and crafts include, *Zardozi*[223]—an embroidery done with gold thread[224]—and *Meenakari*[225]—the art of enamelling.\n\n\n\n### Festivals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nMore than a quarter of the immigrants in Delhi are from Bihar and neighbouring states. Chhath, a festival of rural Bihar is now popular in Delhi.[226]\n![](image)\nOn Basant Panchmi eve, qawwali singers wearing yellow headbands gather at the dargah of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya to sing verses from Amir Khusrau.[227]\n\nDelhi's association and geographic proximity to the capital, New Delhi, has amplified the importance of national events and holidays like Republic Day, Independence Day (15 August) and *Gandhi Jayanti*. On Independence Day, the Prime Minister addresses the nation from the Red Fort. The Republic Day Parade is a large cultural and military parade showcasing India's cultural diversity and military strength.[228][229] Over the centuries, Delhi has become known for its composite culture, and a festival that symbolises this is the *Phool Walon Ki Sair*, which takes place in September. Flowers and *pankhe*—fans embroidered with flowers—are offered to the shrine of the 13th-century Sufi saint Khwaja Bakhtiyar Kaki and the Yogmaya Temple, both situated in Mehrauli.[230]\n\n\nReligious festivals include *Diwali* (the festival of lights), *Mahavir Jayanti*, Guru Nanak's Birthday, *Raksha Bandhan*, *Durga Puja*, *Holi*, *Lohri*, *Chauth*, *Krishna Janmastami*, *Maha Shivratri*, Eid ul-Fitr, *Moharram* and *Buddha Jayanti*.[229] The Qutub Festival is a cultural event during which performances of musicians and dancers from all over India are showcased at night, with the Qutub Minar as a backdrop.[231] Other events such as Kite Flying Festival, International Mango Festival and *Vasant Panchami* (the Spring Festival) are held every year in Delhi. The Auto Expo, Asia's largest auto show,[232] is held in Delhi biennially. The New Delhi World Book Fair, held biennially at the Pragati Maidan, is the second-largest exhibition of books in the world.[233] Delhi is often regarded as the \"Book Capital\" of India because of high readership.[234] India International Trade Fair (IITF), organised by ITPO is the biggest cultural and shopping fair of Delhi which takes place in November each year and is visited by more than 1.5 million people.[235]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian cuisine\n\n![](image)Kitchen, Karim's, Old Delhi, a historic restaurant, estab. 1913[236]\nAs India's national capital and centuries old Mughal capital, Delhi influenced the food habits of its residents and is where Mughlai cuisine originated. Along with Indian cuisine, a variety of international cuisines are popular among the residents.[237] The dearth of food habits among the city's residents created a unique style of cooking which became popular throughout the world, with dishes such as *Kebab*, *biryani*, *tandoori*. The city's classic dishes include butter chicken, *dal makhani*, *shahi paneer*, *aloo chaat*, *chaat*, *dahi bhalla*, *kachori*, *gol gappe*, *samosa*, *chole bhature*, *chole kulche*, *gulab jamun*, *jalebi* and *lassi*.[237][238]: 40–50, 189–196\n\n\nThe fast living habits of Delhi's people has motivated the growth of street food outlets.[238]: 41 A trend of dining at local *dhabas* is popular among the residents. High-profile restaurants have gained popularity in recent years, among the popular restaurants are the Karim Hotel, the Punjab Grill and Bukhara.[239] The *Gali Paranthe Wali* (the street of fried bread) is a street in Chandni Chowk particularly for food eateries since the 1870s. Almost the entire street is occupied by fast food stalls or street vendors. It has nearly become a tradition that almost every prime minister of India has visited the street to eat *paratha* at least once. Other Indian cuisines are also available in this area even though the street specialises in north Indian food.[238]: 40–50[240]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Delhi and List of schools in Delhi\n\n![](image)\nLady Hardinge Medical College pharmacy, 1921\n![](image)\nIndraprastha College for Women, established in 1924\nFile:Building 7 jamia.JPG\nJamia Millia Islamia est. 1920 by M.

The population of the city proper is the third largest in the world, with 24.89 million inhabitants in 2021, while the urban area is the most populous in China, with 39.3 million residents. As of 2018, the Greater Shanghai metropolitan area was estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (nominal) of nearly 9.1 trillion RMB ($1.33 trillion). Shanghai is one of the world's major centers for finance, business and economics, research, science and technology, manufacturing, transportation, tourism, and culture, and the Port of Shanghai is the world's busiest container port.\n\n\nOriginally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to both domestic and foreign trade and its favorable port location. The city was one of five treaty ports forced to open to European trade after the First Opium War. The Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession were subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of Asia in the 1930s. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the city was the site of the major Battle of Shanghai. After the war, with the CCP takeover of the mainland in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries and the city's global influence declined.\n\n\nBy the 1990s, economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping a decade earlier resulted in an intense redevelopment of the city, especially the Pudong New Area, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment. The city has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance; it is the home of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, one of the largest stock exchanges in the world by market capitalization and the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone, the first free-trade zone in mainland China. Shanghai has been classified as an Alpha+ (global first-tier) city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. As of 2022, it is home to 12 companies of the *Fortune* Global 500 and is ranked 4th on the Global Financial Centres Index. The city is also a global major center for research and development and home to many highly ranked Double First-Class Universities. The Shanghai Metro, first opened in 1993, is the largest metro network in the world by route length. \n\n\nShanghai has been described as the \"showpiece\" of the booming economy of China. Featuring several architectural styles such as Art Deco and shikumen, the city is renowned for its Lujiazui skyline, museums and historic buildings including the City God Temple, Yu Garden, the China Pavilion and buildings along the Bund, which includes Oriental Pearl TV Tower. Shanghai is also known for its sugary cuisine, distinctive local language and vibrant international flair.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Shanghai |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| ![](image)\"Shanghai\" in regular Chinese characters\n |\n| Chinese | 上海 |\n|  |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Shànghǎi |\n| Wu | Zaon22 he44ⓘ |\n|  |\n| Postal | Shanghai |\n| Literal meaning | \"Upon the Sea\" |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Shànghǎi |\n| Bopomofo | ㄕㄤˋ   ㄏㄞˇ |\n| Gwoyeu Romatzyh | Shanqhae |\n| Wade–Giles | Shang4-hai3 |\n| IPA | [ʂâŋ.xàɪ] ⓘ |\n| Wu |\n| Romanization | Zaon22 he44ⓘ |\n| ShanghaineseRomanization | Zånhae |\n| Hakka |\n| Romanization | Sông-hói |\n| Yue: Cantonese |\n| Yale Romanization | Seuhnghói |\n| Jyutping | Soeng6hoi2 |\n| IPA | [sœːŋ˨.hɔːi˧˥] |\n| Southern Min |\n| Hokkien POJ | Siōng-hái |\n| Eastern Min |\n| Fuzhou BUC | Siông-hāi |\n\n |\n|  |\n\nThe two Chinese characters in the city's name are 上 (*shàng*/*zan*, \"upon\") and 海 (*hǎi*/*hae*, \"sea\"), together meaning \"On the Sea\". The earliest occurrence of this name dates from the 11th-century Song dynasty, when there was already a river confluence and a town with this name in the area. How the name should be understood has been disputed, but Chinese historians have concluded that during the Tang dynasty, the area of modern-day Shanghai was under sea level, so the land appeared to be literally \"on the sea\".[20]\n\n\nShanghai is officially abbreviated 沪[b] (*Hù*/*Vu*2) in Chinese, a contraction of 沪渎[c] (*Hù Dú*/*Vu Doh*, \"Harpoon Ditch\"), a 4th- or 5th-century Jin name for the mouth of Suzhou Creek when it was the main conduit into the ocean.[23] This character appears on all motor vehicle license plates issued in the municipality today.[24]\n\n\n\n### Alternative names[edit]\n\n\n申 (*Shēn*) or 申城 (*Shēnchéng*, \"Shen City\") was an early name originating from Lord Chunshen, a 3rd-century BC nobleman and prime minister of the state of Chu, whose fief included modern Shanghai.[23] Shanghai-based sports teams and newspapers often use Shen in their names, such as Shanghai Shenhua and *Shen Bao*.\n\n\n华亭[d] (*Huátíng*) was another early name for Shanghai. In AD 751 during the mid-Tang dynasty, Huating County was established by Zhao Juzhen, the governor of Wu Commandery, at modern-day Songjiang, the first county-level administration within modern-day Shanghai. The first five-star hotel in the city was named after Huating.[25]\n\n\n魔都 (*Módū*, \"Magical City\"), a contemporary nickname for Shanghai, is widely known among the youth.[26] The name was first mentioned in Shōfu Muramatsu's 1924 novel *Mato*, which portrayed Shanghai as a dichotomic city where both light and darkness existed.[27]\n\n\nThe city has various nicknames in English, including \"Pearl of the Orient\" and \"Paris of the East\".[28][29] This is similar to Ho Chi Minh City (also known as Saigon), in Vietnam, which has also been nicknamed as \"Paris of the Orient\", due to Vietnam's historical French status.[30]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Shanghai\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Shanghai.\n\n### Antiquity[edit]\n\n\nThe western part of modern-day Shanghai was inhabited 6000 years ago.[31] During the Spring and Autumn period (approximately 771 to 476 BC), it belonged to the Kingdom of Wu, which was conquered by the Kingdom of Yue, which in turn was conquered by the Kingdom of Chu.[32] During the Warring States period (475 BC), Shanghai was part of the fief of Lord Chunshen of Chu, one of the Four Lords of the Warring States. He ordered the excavation of the Huangpu River. Its former or poetic name, the Chunshen River, gave Shanghai its nickname of \"Shēn\".[32] Fishermen living in the Shanghai area then created a fish tool called the *hù*, which lent its name to the outlet of Suzhou Creek north of the Old City and became a common nickname and abbreviation for the city.[33]\n\n\n\n### Imperial era[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Tang and Song dynasties, Qinglong Town (青龙镇[e]) in modern Qingpu District was a major trading port. Established in 746 (the fifth year of the Tang Tianbao era), it developed into what was historically called a \"giant town of the Southeast\", with thirteen temples and seven pagodas. Mi Fu, a scholar and artist of the Song dynasty, served as its mayor. The port experienced thriving trade with provinces along the Yangtze and the Chinese coast, as well as with foreign countries such as Japan and Silla.[2] By the end of the Song dynasty, the center of trading had moved downstream of the Wusong River to Shanghai.[34] It was upgraded in status from a village to a market town in 1074, and in 1172, a second sea wall was built to stabilize the ocean coastline, supplementing an earlier dike.[35] From the Yuan dynasty in 1292 until Shanghai officially became a municipality in 1927, central Shanghai was administered as a county under Songjiang Prefecture, which had its seat in the present-day Songjiang District.[36]\n\n\n\n![](image)Seventeenth century map of the Old City of Shanghai\nTwo important events helped promote Shanghai's developments in the Ming dynasty. A city wall was built for the first time in 1554 to protect the town from raids by Japanese pirates. It measured 10 m (33 ft) high and 5 km (3 mi) in circumference.[37] A City God Temple was built in 1602 during the Wanli reign. This honor was usually reserved for prefectural capitals and not normally given to a mere county seat such as Shanghai. Scholars have theorized that this likely reflected the town's economic importance, as opposed to its low political status.[37]\n\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty, Shanghai became one of the most important sea ports in the Yangtze Delta region as a result of two important central government policy changes: in 1684, the Kangxi Emperor reversed the Ming dynasty prohibition on oceangoing vessels—a ban that had been in force since 1525; and in 1732, the Qianlong Emperor moved the customs office for Jiangsu province (江海关;[f] see Customs House, Shanghai) from the prefectural capital of Songjiang to Shanghai, and gave Shanghai exclusive control over customs collections for Jiangsu's foreign trade. As a result of these two critical decisions, Shanghai became the major trade port for all of the lower Yangtze region by 1735, despite still being at the lowest administrative level in the political hierarchy.[38]\n\n\n\n* ![Songjiang Square Pagoda, built in the 11th century](image)\n\nSongjiang Square Pagoda, built in the 11th century\n* ![The Mahavira Hall at Zhenru Temple, built in 1320](image)\n\nThe Mahavira Hall at Zhenru Temple, built in 1320\n* ![The walled Old City of Shanghai in the 17th century](image)\n\nThe walled Old City of Shanghai in the 17th century\n\n\n### Rise and golden age[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map of Shanghai in 1884; Chinese area are in yellow, French in red, British in blue, American in orange.\nIn the 19th century, international attention to Shanghai grew due to European recognition of its economic and trade potential at the Yangtze. During the First Opium War (1839–1842), British forces occupied the city.[39] The war ended in 1842 with the Treaty of Nanking, which opened Shanghai as one of the five treaty ports for international trade.[40] The Treaty of the Bogue, the Treaty of Wanghia, and the Treaty of Whampoa (signed in 1843, 1844, and 1844, respectively) forced Chinese concession to European and American desires for visitation and trade on Chinese soil. Britain, France, and the United States all established a presence outside the walled city of Shanghai, which remained under the direct administration of the Chinese.[41]\n\n\nThe Chinese-held Old City of Shanghai fell to rebels from the Small Swords Society in 1853, but was recovered by the Qing government in February 1855.[42] In 1854, the Shanghai Municipal Council was created to manage the foreign settlements. Between 1860 and 1862, the Taiping rebels twice attacked Shanghai and destroyed the city's eastern and southern suburbs, but failed to take the city.[43] In 1863, the British settlement to the south of Suzhou Creek (northern Huangpu District) and the American settlement to the north (southern Hongkou District) joined in order to form the Shanghai International Settlement. The French opted out of the Shanghai Municipal Council and maintained its own concession to the south and southwest.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)The dismantlement of Old City walls, 1911\nThe First Sino-Japanese War concluded with the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki, which elevated Japan to become another foreign power in Shanghai. Japan built the first factories in Shanghai, which was soon copied by other foreign powers. All this international activity gave Shanghai the nickname \"the Great Athens of China\".[45] In 1914, the Old City walls were dismantled because they blocked the city's expansion. In July 1921, the Chinese Communist Party was founded in the French Concession.[41] On 30 May 1925, the May Thirtieth Movement broke out when a worker in a Japanese-owned cotton mill was shot and killed by a Japanese foreman.[46] Workers in the city then launched general strikes against imperialism, which became nationwide protests that gave rise to Chinese nationalism.[47]\n\n\nThe golden age of Shanghai began with its elevation to municipality after it was separated from Jiangsu on 7 July 1927.[41][48] This new Chinese municipality covered an area of 494.69 km2 (191.0 sq mi), including the modern-day districts of Baoshan, Yangpu, Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong, but excluded the foreign concessions territories.[48] Headed by a Chinese mayor and municipal council, the new city government's first task—the Greater Shanghai Plan—was to create a new city center in Jiangwan town of Yangpu district, outside the boundaries of the foreign concessions. The plan included a public museum, library, sports stadium, and city hall, which were partially constructed before being interrupted by the Japanese invasion.[49] In the 1920s, *shidaiqu* became a new form of entertainment and was popularised in Shanghai.[50]\n\n\nThe city flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s.[51] During the ensuing decades, citizens of many countries and all continents came to Shanghai to live and work; those who stayed for long periods⁠⁠—some for generations⁠—called themselves \"Shanghailanders\".[52] In the 1920s and 1930s, almost 20,000 White Russians fled the newly established Soviet Union to reside in Shanghai.[53] These Shanghai Russians constituted the second-largest foreign community. By 1932, Shanghai had become the world's fifth largest city and home to 70,000 foreigners.[54] In the 1930s, some 30,000 Jewish refugees from Europe arrived in the city.[55]\n\n\n\n* ![Skyline of Shanghai Pudong at night, September 2021](image)\n\nSkyline of Shanghai Pudong at night, September 2021\n* Shanghai, filmed in 1937\n* ![The Bund in the late 1920s seen from the French Concession](image)\n\nThe Bund in the late 1920s seen from the French Concession\n* ![Nanking Road (modern-day East Nanjing Road) in the 1930s](image)\n\nNanking Road (modern-day East Nanjing Road) in the 1930s\n* ![Shanghai Park Hotel was the tallest building in Asia for decades](image)\n\nShanghai Park Hotel was the tallest building in Asia for decades.\n* ![Former Shanghai Library](image)\n\nFormer Shanghai Library\n* ![The HSBC Building, built in 1923, and the Customs House, built in 1927](image)\n\nThe HSBC Building, built in 1923, and the Customs House, built in 1927\n\n\n### Japanese invasion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zhabei District on fire, 1937\nOn 28 January 1932, Japanese forces invaded Shanghai while the Chinese resisted. More than 10,000 shops and hundreds of factories and public buildings[56] were destroyed, leaving Zhabei district ruined. About 18,000 civilians were either killed, injured, or declared missing.[41] A ceasefire was brokered on 5 May.[57] In 1937, the Battle of Shanghai resulted in the occupation of the Chinese-administered parts of Shanghai outside of the International Settlement and the French Concession. People who stayed in the occupied city suffered on a daily basis, experiencing hunger, oppression, or death.[58] The foreign concessions were ultimately occupied by the Japanese on 8 December 1941 and remained occupied until Japan's surrender in 1945; multiple war crimes were committed during that time.[59]\n\n\nA side-effect of the Japanese invasion of Shanghai was the Shanghai Ghetto. Japanese consul to Kaunas, Lithuania, Chiune Sugihara issued thousands of visas to Jewish refugees who were escaping the Nazi's Final Solution to the Jewish Question. They traveled from Keidan, Lithuania across Russia by railroad to the Vladivostok from where they traveled by ship to Kobe, Japan. Their stay in Kobe was short as the Japanese government transferred them to Shanghai by November 1941. Other Jewish refugees found haven in Shanghai, not through Sugihara, but came on ships from Italy. The refugees from Europe were interned into a cramped ghetto in the Hongkou District, and after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, even the Iraqi Jews who had been living in Shanghai from before the outbreak of WWII were interned. Among the refugees in the Shanghai Ghetto was the Mirrer Yeshiva, including its students and faculty. On 3 September 1945, the Chinese Army liberated the Ghetto and most of the Jews left over the next few years.[60]\n\n\nOn 27 May 1949, the People's Liberation Army took control of Shanghai through the Shanghai Campaign. Under the new People's Republic of China (PRC), Shanghai was one of only three municipalities not merged into neighboring provinces (the others being Beijing and Tianjin).[61] Most foreign firms moved their offices from Shanghai to Hong Kong, as part of a foreign divestment due to the PRC's victory.[62]\n\n\n\n### Modernity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nanjing Road, 1967, during the Cultural Revolution\nAfter the war, Shanghai's economy was restored—from 1949 to 1952, the city's agricultural and industrial output increased by 51.5% and 94.2%, respectively.[41] There were 20 urban districts and 10 suburbs at the time.[63] On 17 January 1958, Jiading, Baoshan, and Shanghai County in Jiangsu became part of Shanghai Municipality, which expanded to 863 km2 (333.2 sq mi). The following December, the land area of Shanghai was further expanded to 5,910 km2 (2,281.9 sq mi) after more surrounding suburban areas in Jiangsu were added: Chongming, Jinshan, Qingpu, Fengxian, Chuansha, and Nanhui.[64] In 1964, the city's administrative divisions were rearranged to 10 urban districts and 10 counties.[63]\n\n\nAs the industrial center of China with the most skilled industrial workers, Shanghai became a center for radical leftism during the 1950s and 1960s. The radical leftist Jiang Qing and her three allies, together the Gang of Four, were based in the city.[65] During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), Shanghai's society was severely damaged. The majority of the workers in the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China were Red Guards and they formed a group called the Anti-Economy Liaison Headquarters within the branch.[66]: 38 The Anti-Economy Liaison Headquarters dismantled economic organizations in Shanghai, investigated bank withdrawals, and disrupted regular bank service in the city.[66]: 38The Shanghai People's Commune was established in the city during the January Storm of 1967. Despite the disruptions of the Cultural Revolutions, Shanghai maintained economic production with a positive annual growth rate.[41]\n\n\nDuring the Third Front campaign to develop basic industry and heavy industry in China's hinterlands in case of invasion by the Soviet Union or the United States, 354,900 Shanghainese were sent to work on Third Front projects.[67]: xvi The centerpiece of Shanghai's Small Third Front project was the \"rear base\" in Anhui rear base which served as \"a multi-function manufacturing base for anti-aircraft and anti-tank weaponry.[67]: xvi\n\n\nSince 1949, Shanghai has been a comparatively heavy contributor of tax revenue to the central government; in 1983, the city's contribution in tax revenue was greater than investment received in the past 33 years combined.[68] Its importance to the fiscal well-being of the central government also denied it from economic liberalizations begun in 1978. \n\n\nIn 1990, Deng Xiaoping permitted Shanghai to initiate economic reforms, which reintroduced foreign capital to the city and developed the Pudong district, resulting in the birth of Lujiazui.[69] That year, the China's central government designated Shanghai as the \"Dragon Head\" of economic reform.[70] As of 2020, Shanghai is classified as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, making it one of the world's Top 10 major cities.[71]\n\n\nIn early 2022, Shanghai experienced a large outbreak of COVID-19 cases. After localized lockdowns failed to stem the rise in cases, the Chinese government locked down the entire city on 5 April. This resulted in widespread food shortages across the city emerged as food-supply chains were severely disrupted by the government's lockdown measures, which was not lifted until 1 June.[72]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Shanghai\n\n![](image)The urban area of Shanghai in 2016, along with its major islands. From northwest to southeast: Chongming, Changxing, Hengsha, and the Jiuduansha shoals off Pudong. The Yangtze's natural sediment discharge can be seen.\nShanghai is located on the Yangtze Estuary of China's east coast, with the Yangtze River to the north and Hangzhou Bay to the south, with the East China Sea to the east. The land is formed by the Yangtze's natural deposition and modern land reclamation projects. As such, it has sandy soil, and skyscrapers have to be built with deep concrete piles to avoid sinking into the soft ground.[73] The provincial-level Municipality of Shanghai administers both the estuary and many of its surrounding islands. It borders the provinces of Zhejiang to the south and Jiangsu to the west and north.[74] The municipality's northernmost point is on Chongming Island, which is the second-largest island in mainland China after its expansion during the 20th century.[75] It does not administratively include an exclave of Jiangsu on northern Chongming or the two islands forming Shanghai's Yangshan Port, which are parts of Zhejiang's Shengsi County.\n\n\nShanghai is located on an alluvial plain. As such, the vast majority of its 6,340.5 km2 (2,448.1 sq mi) land area is flat, with an average elevation of 4 m (13 ft).[8] Tidal flat ecosystems exist around the estuary, however, they have long been reclaimed for agricultural purposes.[76] The city's few hills, such as She Shan, lie to the southwest, and its highest point is the peak of Dajinshan Island (103 m or 338 ft) in Hangzhou Bay.[8] Shanghai has many rivers, canals, streams, and lakes, and it is known for its rich water resources as part of the Lake Tai drainage basin.[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  Shanghai\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 49\n\n\n\n8\n\n1\n | 59\n\n\n\n9\n\n2\n | 90\n\n\n\n13\n\n5\n | 97\n\n\n\n19\n\n11\n | 112\n\n\n\n24\n\n16\n | 169\n\n\n\n27\n\n21\n | 151\n\n\n\n32\n\n25\n | 146\n\n\n\n32\n\n25\n | 141\n\n\n\n28\n\n21\n | 57\n\n\n\n23\n\n15\n | 50\n\n\n\n17\n\n9\n | 38\n\n\n\n11\n\n3\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n| Source: The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 1.9\n\n\n\n46\n\n33\n | 2.3\n\n\n\n48\n\n36\n | 3.6\n\n\n\n55\n\n42\n | 3.8\n\n\n\n66\n\n51\n | 4.4\n\n\n\n75\n\n61\n | 6.6\n\n\n\n81\n\n69\n | 6\n\n\n\n90\n\n77\n | 5.8\n\n\n\n89\n\n77\n | 5.6\n\n\n\n82\n\n69\n | 2.3\n\n\n\n73\n\n59\n | 2\n\n\n\n63\n\n48\n | 1.5\n\n\n\n52\n\n37\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nDowntown Shanghai is bisected by the Huangpu River, a man-made tributary of the Yangtze created by order of Lord Chunshen during the Warring States period.[32] The historic center of the city was located on the west bank of the Huangpu (Puxi), near the mouth of Suzhou Creek, connecting it with Lake Tai and the Grand Canal. The central financial district, Lujiazui, has been established on the east bank of the Huangpu (Pudong). Along Shanghai's eastern shore, the destruction of local wetlands due to the construction of Pudong International Airport has been partially offset by the protection and expansion of a nearby shoal, Jiuduansha, as a nature preserve.[77]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nShanghai has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), with an average annual temperature of 15.8 °C (60.4 °F) for urban districts and 15.2–15.7 °C (59.4–60.3 °F) for suburbs.[73] The city experiences four distinct seasons. Winters are temperate to cold and damp—northwesterly winds from Siberia can cause nighttime temperatures to drop below freezing. Each year, there are an average of 6.2 days with snowfall and 2.8 days with snow cover.[73] Summers are hot and humid, and occasional downpours or freak thunderstorms can be expected. On average, 8.7 days exceed 35 °C (95 °F) annually. In summer and the beginning of autumn, the city is susceptible to typhoons.[78]\n\n\nThe most pleasant seasons are generally spring, although changeable and often rainy, and autumn, which is usually sunny and dry. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 28% in June to 47% in August, the city receives 1,763 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from −10.1 °C (14 °F) on 31 January 1977 (unofficial record of −12.1 °C (10 °F) was set on 19 January 1893) to 40.9 °C (106 °F) on 13 July 2022 at a weather station in Xujiahui.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Shanghai (Minhang District), 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1951–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 22.1(71.8)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 29.6(85.3)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 37.5(99.5)\n | 40.9(105.6)\n | 39.9(103.8)\n | 38.2(100.8)\n | 36.0(96.8)\n | 28.7(83.7)\n | 24.0(75.2)\n | 40.9(105.6)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 8.7(47.7)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 32.3(90.1)\n | 28.5(83.3)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 11.5(52.7)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 4.9(40.8)\n | 6.6(43.9)\n | 10.4(50.7)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n | 20.9(69.6)\n | 24.4(75.9)\n | 28.8(83.8)\n | 28.5(83.3)\n | 24.7(76.5)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 7.3(45.1)\n | 17.1(62.8)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 1.9(35.4)\n | 3.3(37.9)\n | 6.8(44.2)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −10.1(13.8)\n | −7.9(17.8)\n | −5.4(22.3)\n | −0.5(31.1)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 1.7(35.1)\n | −4.2(24.4)\n | −8.5(16.7)\n | −10.1(13.8)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 70.4(2.77)\n | 65.4(2.57)\n | 95.4(3.76)\n | 82.5(3.25)\n | 93.2(3.67)\n | 207.3(8.16)\n | 148.0(5.83)\n | 187.1(7.37)\n | 118.1(4.65)\n | 68.4(2.69)\n | 59.4(2.34)\n | 50.3(1.98)\n | 1,245.5(49.04)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 10.9\n | 10.2\n | 12.9\n | 11.3\n | 11.2\n | 14.5\n | 11.7\n | 12.4\n | 9.8\n | 7.4\n | 9.1\n | 8.3\n | 129.7\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 1.8\n | 1.4\n | 0.4\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0.1\n | 0.7\n | 4.4\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 74\n | 73\n | 72\n | 71\n | 73\n | 80\n | 78\n | 78\n | 76\n | 73\n | 74\n | 72\n | 75\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 114.8\n | 117.9\n | 143.8\n | 168.1\n | 176.8\n | 131.2\n | 209.4\n | 202.3\n | 163.7\n | 162.1\n | 131.1\n | 129.7\n | 1,850.9\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 36\n | 37\n | 39\n | 43\n | 41\n | 31\n | 49\n | 50\n | 45\n | 46\n | 42\n | 41\n | 42\n |\n| Source: China Meteorological Administration[79][80] |\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nView of Lujiazui from The Bund during the day\n\n![](image)\nView of Pudong from Waibaidu Bridge\n\n![](image)\nNight view of Lujiazui in Pudong.\n\nThe Bund, located by the bank of the Huangpu River, is home to a row of early 20th-century architecture, ranging in style from the neoclassical HSBC Building to the Art Deco Sassoon House (now part of the Peace Hotel). Many areas in the former foreign concessions are also well-preserved, the most notable being the French Concession.[81] Shanghai is also home to many architecturally distinctive and even eccentric buildings, including the Shanghai Museum, the Shanghai Grand Theatre, the Shanghai Oriental Art Center, and the Oriental Pearl Tower. Despite rampant redevelopment, the Old City still retains some traditional architecture and designs, such as the Yu Garden, an elaborate Jiangnan style garden.[82]\n\n\nAs a result of its construction boom during the 1920s and 1930s, Shanghai has among the most Art Deco buildings in the world.[81] One of the most famous architects working in Shanghai was László Hudec, a Hungarian-Slovak who lived in the city between 1918 and 1947.[83] His most notable Art Deco buildings include the Park Hotel, the Grand Cinema, and the Paramount.[84] Other prominent architects who contributed to the Art Deco style are Clement Palmer and Arthur Turner, who together designed the Peace Hotel, the Metropole Hotel, and the Broadway Mansions;[85] and Austrian architect C.H. Gonda, who designed the Capitol Theatre. The Bund has been revitalized several times. The first was in 1986, with a new promenade by the Dutch architect Paulus Snoeren.[86] The second was before the 2010 Expo, which includes restoration of the century-old Waibaidu Bridge and reconfiguration of traffic flow.[87]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bund\nOne distinctive cultural element is the shikumen (石库门, \"stone storage door\") residence, typically two- or three-story gray brick houses with the front yard protected by a heavy wooden door in a stylistic stone arch.[88] Each residence is connected and arranged in straight alleys, known as longtang[g] (弄堂). The house is similar to western-style terrace houses or townhouses, but distinguished by the tall, heavy brick wall and archway in front of each house.[90]\n\n\nThe shikumen is a cultural blend of elements found in Western architecture with traditional Jiangnan Chinese architecture and social behavior.[88] Like almost all traditional Chinese dwellings, it has a courtyard, which reduces outside noise. Vegetation can be grown in the courtyard, and it can also allow for sunlight and ventilation to the rooms.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai World Financial Center (left) and Jin Mao Tower (right)\nSome of Shanghai's buildings feature Soviet neoclassical architecture or Stalinist architecture, though the city has fewer such structures than Beijing. These buildings were mostly erected between the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 and the Sino-Soviet Split in the late 1960s. During this time period, large numbers of Soviet experts, including architects, poured into China to aid the country in the construction of a communist state. An example of Soviet neoclassical architecture in Shanghai is the modern-day Shanghai Exhibition Center.[92]\n\n\nShanghai—Lujiazui in particular—has numerous skyscrapers, making it the fifth city in the world with the most skyscrapers.[93] Among the most prominent examples are the 421 m (1,381 ft) high Jin Mao Tower, the 492 m (1,614 ft) high Shanghai World Financial Center, and the 632 m (2,073 ft) high Shanghai Tower, which is the tallest building in China and the third tallest in the world.[94] Completed in 2015, the tower takes the form of nine twisted sections stacked atop each other, totaling 128 floors.[95] It is featured in its double-skin facade design, which eliminates the need for either layer to be opaqued for reflectivity as the double-layer structure has already reduced the heat absorption.[96] The futuristic-looking Oriental Pearl Tower, at 468 m (1,535 ft), is located nearby at the northern tip of Lujiazui.[97] Skyscrapers outside of Lujiazui include the White Magnolia Plaza in Hongkou, the Shimao International Plaza in Huangpu, and the Shanghai Wheelock Square in Jing'an.\n\n\n\n* ![The Shanghai Museum](image)\n\nThe Shanghai Museum\n* ![The Shanghai Grand Theater](image)\n\nThe Shanghai Grand Theater\n* ![The Shanghai Exhibition Center, an example of Stalinist architecture](image)\n\nThe Shanghai Exhibition Center, an example of Stalinist architecture\n* ![The Oriental Pearl Tower at night](image)\n\nThe Oriental Pearl Tower at night\n* ![Shanghai Tower](image)\n\nShanghai Tower\n* ![Glass facades of two skyscrapers](image)\n\nGlass facades of two skyscrapers\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Shanghai and Shanghai Municipal People's Government\n\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCurrent leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Government\n|  | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Title\n | **CCP Committee Secretary** | **SMPC Chairman** | **Mayor** | **Shanghai CPPCC Chairman** |\n| Name\n | Chen Jining | Jiang Zhuoqing | Gong Zheng | Dong Yunhu\n |\n| Ancestral home | Lishu, Jilin | Cixi, Zhejiang | Suzhou, Jiangsu | Taizhou, Zhejiang |\n| Born\n | February 1964 (age 60) | August 1959 (age 64) | March 1960 (age 64) | November 1962 (age 61)\n |\n| Assumed office\n | October 2022[98] | January 2020[99] | March 2020[100] | January 2018[101] |\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai Municipal Government building\nLike all governing institutions in mainland China, Shanghai has a parallel party-government system,[102] in which the CCP Committee Secretary, officially termed the Chinese Communist Party Shanghai Municipal Committee Secretary, outranks the Mayor.[103] The CCP committee acts as the top policy-formulation body, and is typically composed of 12 members (including the secretary), and has control over the Shanghai Municipal People's Government.[104][105]\n\n\nPolitical power in Shanghai has frequently been a stepping stone to higher positions in the central government. Since Jiang Zemin became the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in June 1989, all former Shanghai party secretaries but one were elevated to the Politburo Standing Committee, the *de facto* highest decision-making body in China,[102] including Jiang himself (Party General Secretary),[106] Zhu Rongji (Premier),[107] Wu Bangguo (NPC Chairman),[108] Huang Ju (Vice Premier),[109] Xi Jinping (current General Secretary),[110] Yu Zhengsheng (CPPCC Chairman),[111] Han Zheng (Vice Premier and Vice President),[112] and Li Qiang (Premier). Zeng Qinghong, a former deputy party secretary of Shanghai, also rose to the Politburo Standing Committee and became the Vice President and an influential power broker.[113] The only exception is Chen Liangyu, who was fired in 2006 and later convicted of corruption.[114]\n\n\nOfficials with ties to the Shanghai administration collectively form a powerful faction in the central government known as the Shanghai Clique, which has often been viewed to compete against the rival Youth League Faction over personnel appointments and policy decisions.[115] However, Xi Jinping, successor to Hu Jintao as General Secretary and President, was largely an independent leader and took anti-corruption campaigns on both factions.[116]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of administrative divisions of Shanghai and List of township-level divisions of Shanghai\n\nShanghai is one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of the Government of the People's Republic of China,[117] and is divided into 16 county-level districts.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Administrative divisions of Shanghai\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**Huangpu**\n\n**Xuhui**\n\n**Changning**\n\n**Jing'an**\n\n**Putuo**\n\n**Hongkou**\n\n**Yangpu**\n\n**Minhang**\n\n**Baoshan**\n\n**Jiading**\n\n**Pudong**\n\n**Jinshan**\n\n**Songjiang**\n\n**Qingpu**\n\n**Fengxian**\n\n**Chongming**\n |\n| Division code[118] | Division\n | Area (km2)[119] | Total population 2020[119] | Seat\n | Postal code\n |\n| 310000 | Shanghai\n | 6,340.50 | 24,870,895 | Huangpu | 200000\n |\n| 310101 | Huangpu | 20.46 | 662,030 | Waitan Subdistrict | 200001\n |\n| 310104 | Xuhui | 54.76 | 1,113,078 | Xujiahui Subdistrict | 200030\n |\n| 310105 | Changning | 38.30 | 693,051 | Jiangsu Road Subdistrict | 200050\n |\n| 310106 | Jing'an | 36.88 | 975,707 | Jiangning Road Subdistrict | 200040\n |\n| 310107 | Putuo | 54.83 | 1,239,800 | Zhenru Town Subdistrict | 200333\n |\n| 310109 | Hongkou | 23.46 | 757,498 | Jiaxing Road Subdistrict | 200080\n |\n| 310110 | Yangpu | 60.73 | 1,242,548 | Pingliang Road Subdistrict | 200082\n |\n| 310112 | Minhang | 370.75 | 2,653,489 | Xinzhuang town | 201100\n |\n| 310113 | Baoshan | 270.99 | 2,235,218 | Youyi Road Subdistrict | 201900\n |\n| 310114 | Jiading | 464.20 | 1,834,258 | Xincheng Road Subdistrict | 201800\n |\n| 310115 | Pudong | 1,210.41 | 5,681,512 | Huamu Subdistrict | 200135\n |\n| 310116 | Jinshan | 586.05 | 822,776 | Shanyang town | 201500\n |\n| 310117 | Songjiang | 605.64 | 1,909,713 | Fangsong Subdistrict | 201600\n |\n| 310118 | Qingpu | 670.14 | 1,271,424 | Xiayang Subdistrict | 201700\n |\n| 310120 | Fengxian | 687.39 | 1,140,872 | Nanqiao town | 201400\n |\n| 310151 | Chongming | 1,185.49 | 637,921 | Chengqiao town | 202100\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Divisions in Chinese and varieties of romanizations\n |\n| --- |\n| English\n | Chinese\n | Pinyin\n | Shanghainese Romanization\n |\n| Shanghai Municipality\n | 上海市 | Shànghǎi Shì\n | zaon he zy\n |\n| Huangpu District | 黄浦区 | Huángpǔ Qū\n | waon phu chiu\n |\n| Xuhui District | 徐汇区 | Xúhuì Qū\n | zi we chiu\n |\n| Changning District | 长宁区 | Chángníng Qū\n | zan nyin chiu\n |\n| Jing'an District | 静安区 | Jìng'ān Qū\n | zin oe chiu\n |\n| Putuo District | 普陀区 | Pǔtuó Qū\n | phu du chiu\n |\n| Hongkou District | 虹口区 | Hóngkǒu Qū\n | ghon kheu chiu\n |\n| Yangpu District | 杨浦区 | Yángpǔ Qū\n | yan phu chiu\n |\n| Minhang District | 闵行区 | Mǐnháng Qū\n | min ghaon chiu\n |\n| Baoshan District | 宝山区 | Bǎoshān Qū\n | pau sae chiu\n |\n| Jiading District | 嘉定区 | Jiādìng Qū\n | ka din chiu\n |\n| Pudong New Area | 浦东新区 | Pǔdōng Xīnqū\n | phu ton sin chiu\n |\n| Jinshan District | 金山区 | Jīnshān Qū\n | cin se chiu\n |\n| Songjiang District | 松江区 | Sōngjiāng Qū\n | son kaon chiu\n |\n| Qingpu District | 青浦区 | Qīngpǔ Qū\n | tsin phu chiu\n |\n| Fengxian District | 奉贤区 | Fèngxián Qū\n | von yi chiu\n |\n| Chongming District | 崇明区 | Chóngmíng Qū\n | dzon min chiu\n |\n\n\nAlthough every district has its own urban core, the city hall and major administrative units are located in Huangpu District, which also serves as a commercial area, including the famous Nanjing Road.

Many universities in Shanghai are located in residential areas in Yangpu District and Putuo District.\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of central Shanghai\nSeven of the districts govern Puxi (lit. \"The West Bank\", or \"West of the River Pu\"), the older part of urban Shanghai on the west bank of the Huangpu River. These seven districts are collectively referred to as Shanghai Proper (上海市区) or the core city (市中心), which comprise Huangpu, Xuhui, Changning, Jing'an, Putuo, Hongkou, and Yangpu.\n\n\nPudong (lit. \"The East Bank\", or \"East of the River Pu\"), the newer part of urban and suburban Shanghai on the east bank of the Huangpu River, is governed by Pudong New Area (浦东新区).[j]\n\n\nSeven of the districts govern suburbs, satellite towns, and rural areas farther away from the urban core: Baoshan,[k] Minhang,[l] Jiading,[m] Jinshan,[n] Songjiang,[o] Qingpu,[p] and Fengxian.[q]\n\n\nChongming District comprises the islands of Changxing and Hengsha and most—but not all[r]—of Chongming Island.\n\n\nThe former district of Nanhui was absorbed into Pudong District in 2009. In 2011, Luwan District merged with Huangpu District. As of 2015[update], these county-level divisions are further divided into the following 210 township-level divisions: 109 towns, 2 townships, and 99 subdistricts. Those are in turn divided into the following village-level divisions: 3,661 neighborhood committees and 1,704 village committees.[123]\n\n\nThere is a sizable Korean community of Shanghai and Japanese community of Shanghai largely in the Minhang District.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article on Chinese Wikipedia: 上海经济\n\nShanghai has been described as the \"showpiece\" of the booming economy of China.[124][125] The city is a global center for finance and innovation,[126][127] and a national center for commerce, trade, and transportation,[128] with the world's busiest container port—the Port of Shanghai.[129] As of 2018, the Greater Shanghai metropolitan area, which includes Suzhou, Wuxi, Nantong, Ningbo, Jiaxing, Zhoushan, and Huzhou, was estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product of nearly 9.1 trillion RMB ($1.33 trillion in nominal or $2.08 trillion in PPP), exceeding that of Mexico with GDP (nominal) of $1.22 trillion, the 15th largest in the world.[130][131] As of 2020, the economy of Shanghai was estimated to be $1 trillion (PPP), ranking the most productive metro area of China and among the top ten largest metropolitan economies in the world.[132] Shanghai's six largest industries—retail, finance, IT, real estate, machine manufacturing, and automotive manufacturing—comprise about half the city's GDP.[133] As of 2021[update], Shanghai had a GDP of CN¥4.46 trillion ($1.106 trillion in PPP) that makes up 3.69% of China's GDP, and a GDP per capita of CN¥179,907 (US$26,747 in nominal or US$44,576 in PPP)[11] In 2021, the average annual disposable income of Shanghai's residents was CN¥78,027 (US$12,287) per capita, while the average annual salary of people employed in urban units in Shanghai was CN¥191,844 (US$29,736),[11] making it one of the wealthiest cities in China,[134] but also the most expensive city in mainland China to live in according to a 2017 study by the Economist Intelligence Unit.[135] Since 2018, Shanghai has been hosting the China International Import Expo (CIIE) annually, the world's first import-themed national-level expo.\n\n\nIn 2021, Shanghai was the most expensive city in the world.[136] Shanghai was the 5th wealthiest city in the world, with a total wealth amounts to $1.8 trillion,[137] and Shanghai was ranked fifth-highest in the number of billionaires by Forbes.[138] Shanghai's nominal GDP was projected to reach US$1.3 trillion in 2035 (ranking first in China), making it one of the world's Top 5 major cities in terms of GRP according to a study by Oxford Economics.[139] As of August 2022, Shanghai ranked 5th in the world and 2nd in China (after Beijing) by the largest number of the *Fortune* Global 500 companies in the world.[140]\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomy of Shanghai since the Chinese economic reform\n| Year\n | 1978\n | 1980\n | 1983\n | 1986\n | 1990\n | 1993\n | 1996\n | 2000\n | 2003\n | 2006\n | 2010\n | 2013\n | 2016\n | 2017\n | 2018[141] | 2019[142] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GDP (¥T)[143] | 0.027\n | 0.031\n | 0.035\n | 0.049\n | 0.078\n | 0.152\n | 0.298\n | 0.481\n | 0.676\n | 1.072\n | 1.744\n | 2.226\n | 2.818\n | 3.063\n | 3.268\n | 3.816\n |\n| GDP per capita (¥K)[143] | 2.85\n | 2.73\n | 2.95\n | 3.96\n | 5.91\n | 11.06\n | 20.81\n | 30.31\n | 38.88\n | 55.62\n | 77.28\n | 92.85\n | 116.58\n | 126.63\n | 134.83\n | 157.14\n |\n| Average disposable income(urban) (¥K)[144][145][146] |  | 0.64\n |  |  | 2.18\n | 4.28\n | 8.16\n | 11.72\n | 14.87\n | 20.67\n | 31.84\n | 43.85\n | 57.69\n | 62.60\n | 64.18(total)\n | 69.44(total)\n |\n| Average disposable income(rural) (¥K)[147][145] |  | 0.40\n |  |  | 1.67\n |  | 4.85\n | 5.57\n | 6.66\n | 9.21\n | 13.75\n | 19.21\n | 25.52\n | 27.82\n |  |\n\n\nShanghai was the largest and most prosperous city in East Asia during the 1930s, and its rapid redevelopment began in the 1990s.[51] In the last two decades, Shanghai has been one of the fastest-developing cities in the world; it has recorded double-digit GDP growth in almost every year between 1992 and 2008, before the financial crisis of 2007–08.[148]\n\n\n\n### Finance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Shanghai Stock Exchange is one of the largest stock exchanges in the world by market capitalization.\nShanghai is a global financial center, ranking first in the whole of Asia & Oceania region and third globally (after New York and London) in the 28th edition of the Global Financial Centres Index,[149] published in September 2020 by Z/Yen and China Development Institute.[150] Shanghai is also a large hub of the Chinese and global technology industry and home to a large startup ecosystem. As of 2021, the city was ranked as the 2nd Fintech powerhouse in the world after New York City.[151]\n\n\nAs of 2019[update], the Shanghai Stock Exchange had a market capitalization of US$4.02 trillion, making it the largest stock exchange in China and the fourth-largest stock exchange in the world.[152] In 2009, the trading volume of six key commodities—including rubber, copper, and zinc—on the Shanghai Futures Exchange all ranked first globally.[153] By the end of 2017, Shanghai had 1,491 financial institutions, of which 251 were foreign-invested.[154]\n\n\nIn September 2013 with the backing of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, the city launched the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone—the first free-trade zone in mainland China. The zone introduced a number of pilot reforms designed to incentivize foreign investment. In April 2014, *The Banker* reported that Shanghai \"has attracted the highest volumes of financial sector foreign direct investment in the Asia-Pacific region in the 12 months to the end of January 2014\".[155] In August 2014, *fDi magazine* named Shanghai the \"Chinese Province of the Future 2014/15\" due to \"particularly impressive performances in the Business Friendliness and Connectivity categories, as well as placing second in the Economic Potential and Human Capital and Lifestyle categories\".[156]\n\n\n\n### Manufacturing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The F-22P frigate built by Hudong-Zhonghua for the Pakistan Navy\nAs one of the main industrial centers of China, Shanghai plays a key role in domestic manufacturing and heavy industry. Several industrial zones—including Shanghai Hongqiao Economic and Technological Development Zone, Jinqiao Export Economic Processing Zone, Minhang Economic and Technological Development Zone, and Shanghai Caohejing High-Tech Development Zone—are backbones of Shanghai's secondary sector. Shanghai is home to China's largest steelmaker Baosteel Group, China's largest shipbuilding base Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding Group, and one of China's oldest shipbuilders, the Jiangnan Shipyard.[157][158] Auto manufacturing is another important industry. The Shanghai-based SAIC Motor is one of the three largest automotive corporations in China, and has strategic partnerships with Volkswagen and General Motors.[159]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of tourist attractions in Shanghai.\n\n![The Nanjing Pedestrian Street at night. This is a popular commercial center in Shanghai.](image)Nanjing Road near The Bund at night. This is a popular commercial center in Shanghai.\nTourism is a major industry of Shanghai. In 2017, the number of domestic tourists increased by 7.5% to 318 million, while the number of overseas tourists increased by 2.2% to 8.73 million.[154] In 2017, Shanghai was the highest earning tourist city in the world, which is expected to maintain until 2027.[160] As of 2019, Shanghai had 71 five-star hotels, 61 four star hotels, 1,758 travel agencies, 113 rated tourist attractions, and 34 red tourist attractions.[142]\n\n\nThe conference and meeting sector is also growing. According to the International Congress and Convention Association, Shanghai hosted 82 international meetings in 2018, a 34% increase from 61 in 2017.[161][162]\n\n\n\n### Free-trade zone[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shanghai Free-Trade Zone\n\nShanghai is home to China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone, the first free-trade zone in mainland China.[163] As of October 2019[update], it is also the second largest free-trade zone in mainland China in terms of land area (behind Hainan Free Trade Zone [zh], which covers the whole Hainan province[164]) by covering an area of 240.22 km2 (92.75 sq mi) and integrating four existing bonded zones—Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, Waigaoqiao Free Trade Logistics Park, Yangshan Free Trade Port Area, and Pudong Airport Comprehensive Free Trade Zone.[165][166] The industrial chain of port logistics has shaped the future development direction of the free-trade zone in Shanghai. Currently, two port chain centers have been approved for construction in Waigaoqiao and Yangshan.[167] Several preferential policies have been implemented to attract foreign investment in various industries to the zone. Because the zone is not technically considered Chinese territory for tax purposes, commodities entering the zone are exempt from duty and customs clearance.[168]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Shanghai\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1954[169] | 6,204,400 | —     |\n| 1964[169] | 10,816,500 | +5.72% |\n| 1982[169] | 11,859,700 | +0.51% |\n| 1990[169] | 13,341,900 | +1.48% |\n| 2000[169] | 16,407,700 | +2.09% |\n| 2010[169] | 23,019,200 | +3.44% |\n| 2015[170] | 24,152,700 | +0.97% |\n| 2016[170] | 24,197,000 | +0.18% |\n| 2017[170] | 24,183,300 | −0.06% |\n| 2018[141] | 24,237,800 | +0.23% |\n| 2019[142] | 24,281,400 | +0.18% |\n| Population size may be affected by changes to administrative divisions. |\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], Shanghai had a total population of 24,758,900, including 14,693,630 (59.3%) hukou holders (registered locally).[142] As of 2021[update], 89.3% of Shanghai's population live in urban areas, and 10.7% live in rural areas.[11] Based on the population of its total administrative area, Shanghai is the second largest of the four municipalities of China, behind Chongqing, but is generally considered the largest Chinese city because the urban population of Chongqing is much smaller.[171] According to the OECD, Shanghai's metropolitan area has an estimated population of 34 million.[172]\n\n\nAccording to the Shanghai Municipal Statistics Bureau, about 157,900 residents in Shanghai are foreigners, including 28,900 Japanese, 21,900 Americans and 20,800 Koreans.[173] The actual number of foreign citizens in the city is probably much higher.[174] Shanghai is also a domestic immigration city—40.3% (9.8 million) of the city's residents are from other regions of China.[142]\n\n\nShanghai has a life expectancy of 83.18 years for the city's registered population,[175] the highest life expectancy of all cities in mainland China. This has also caused the city to experience population aging—in 2021, 17.4% (4.3 million) of the city's registered population was aged 65 or above.[142] In 2017, the Chinese government implemented population controls for Shanghai, resulting in a population decline of 10,000 people by the end of the year.[176]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article on Chinese Wikipedia: 上海宗教\n\nSee also: Religion in China\n\n![](image)Bird's-eye view of the golden pagoda of Jing'an Temple\nDue to its cosmopolitan history, Shanghai has a blend of religious heritage; religious buildings and institutions are scattered around the city. According to a 2012 survey, only 13.1% of the city's population belongs to organized religions, including Buddhists with 10.4%, Protestants with 1.9%, Catholics with 0.7%, and other faiths with 0.1% while the remaining 86.9% of the population could be either atheists or involved in worship of nature deities and ancestors or folk religious sects.[177]\n\n\n\n<div style=\"border:solid transparent;background-color:initial;position:absolute;width:100px;line-height:0;<div style=\"border:solid transparent;background-color:initial;position:absolute;width:100px;line-height:0;\n\nReligion in Shanghai (2012):\n\n\n\nChinese folk religion, or atheist (86.9%)\nBuddhism (10.4%)\nProtestantism (1.9%)\nCatholicism (0.7%)\nOther (0.1%)\n\nBuddhism, in its Chinese varieties, has had a presence in Shanghai since the Three Kingdoms period, during which the Longhua Temple—the largest temple in Shanghai—and the Jing'an Temple were founded.[178] Another significant temple is the Jade Buddha Temple, which was named after a large statue of Buddha carved out of jade in the temple.[179] As of 2014[update], Buddhism in Shanghai had 114 temples, 1,182 clergical staff, and 453,300 registered followers.[178] The religion also has its own college, the Shanghai Buddhist College [zh], and its own press, Shanghai Buddhological Press [zh].[180]\n\n\n\n![](image)The St. Ignatius Cathedral\nCatholicism was brought into Shanghai in 1608 by Italian missionary Lazzaro Cattaneo.[181] The Apostolic Vicariate of Shanghai was erected in 1933, and was further elevated to the Diocese of Shanghai in 1946.[182] Notable Catholic sites include the St. Ignatius Cathedral in Xujiahui—the largest Catholic church in the city,[183] the St. Francis Xavier Church, and the She Shan Basilica.[184] Other forms of Christianity in Shanghai include Eastern Orthodox minorities and, since 1996, registered Christian Protestant churches.\n\n\nAlthough currently making up a fraction of the religious population in Shanghai, Jewish people have played an influential role in the city's history. After the Treaty of Nanking ended the First Opium War in 1842, the city was opened up to western populations and merchants traveled to Shanghai for its rich business potential, including many prominent Jewish families. The Sassoons amassed great wealth in the opium and textile trades, cementing their status by funding many of the buildings that have become iconic in Shanghai's skyline, such as the Cathay Hotel in 1929.[185] The Hardoons were another prominent Baghdadi Jewish family that used their business success to define Shanghai in the 20th century. The head of the family, Silas Hardoon, one of the richest people in the world during the 1800s, financed Nanjing Road, which then housed departmental stores in the International Settlement, that is now one of the busiest shopping centers in the world.[185]\n\n\nDuring World War II, thousands of Jews emigrated to Shanghai in an effort to flee Nazi Germany. They lived in a designated area called the Shanghai Ghetto and formed a community centered on the Ohel Moishe Synagogue, which is now the Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum.[186] In 1939, Horace Kadoorie, the head of the powerful philanthropic Sephardic Jewish family in Shanghai, founded the Shanghai Jewish Youth Association to support Jewish refugees through English education so they would be prepared to emigrate from Shanghai when the time came.[187]\n\n\nIslam came into Shanghai during the Yuan dynasty. The city's first mosque, Songjiang Mosque, was built during the Zhizheng (至正) era under Emperor Huizong (reigned 1333 – 1368). Shanghai's Muslim population increased in the 19th and early 20th centuries (when the city was a treaty port), during which time many mosques—including the Xiaotaoyuan Mosque, the Huxi Mosque, and the Pudong Mosque—were built. The Shanghai Islamic Association is located in the Xiaotaoyuan Mosque in Huangpu.[188]\n\n\nShanghai has several folk religious temples, including the City God Temple at the heart of the Old City, the Dajing Ge Pavilion dedicated to the Three Kingdoms general Guan Yu, the Confucian Temple of Shanghai, and a major Taoist center Shanghai White Cloud Temple [zh] where the Shanghai Taoist Association locates.[189]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shanghainese\n\n| Ability to speak the following dialects/languages in Shanghai (2013)[190] |\n| --- |\n| Languages |  | % | Can Speak |\n| Mandarin |  | 97.0% |\n| Shanghainese |  | 81.4% |\n| English |  | 47.5% |\n| Other Chinese |  | 29.7% |\n| Other foreign languages |  | 7.8% |\n| Sampled among residents ≥ 13 years old. |\n\nThe vernacular language spoken in the city is Shanghainese, part of the Taihu Wu subgroup of the Wu Chinese language family. This is different from the national language, Mandarin, which is mutually unintelligible with Wu Chinese.[191] Modern Shanghainese derives from the indigenous Wu spoken in the former Songjiang prefecture but has been influenced by other dialects of Taihu Wu, most notably Suzhounese, and Ningbonese[192]\n\n\nPrior to its expansion, the language spoken in Shanghai was not as prominent as those spoken around Jiaxing and later Suzhou,[192] and was known as \"the local tongue\" (本地閑話), a name which is now used in suburbs only.[193] In the late 19th century, downtown Shanghainese (市區閑話 or simply 上海閑話) appeared, undergoing rapid changes and quickly replacing Suzhounese as the prestige dialect of the Yangtze River Delta region. At the time, most of the immigration into the city came from the two adjacent provinces, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the local dialects of which had the greatest influence on Shanghainese. After 1949, Putonghua (Standard Mandarin) has also had a great impact on Shanghainese as a result of being rigorously promoted by the government.[192] Since the 1990s, many migrants outside of the Wu-speaking region have come to Shanghai for education and jobs. They often cannot speak the local language and therefore use Putonghua (Mandarin) as a lingua franca. Because Putonghua and English were more favored, Shanghainese began to decline, and fluency among young speakers weakened. In recent years, there have been movements within the city to promote the local language and protect it from fading out.[194][195]\n\n\n\n## Education and research[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Shanghai\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of universities and colleges in Shanghai.\n\n![](image)Shanghai Jiao Tong University Library\nShanghai is an international center of research and development and as of 2022, it was ranked third globally and second in the whole Asia & Oceania region (after Beijing) by scientific research outputs, as tracked by the Nature Index.[196] It is also a major center of higher education in China. As of 2022, Shanghai had 64 universities and colleges, ranking first in East China region as a city with most higher education institutions.[197]\n\n\nShanghai has many highly ranked educational institutions,[198][199] with 15 universities listed in 147 Double First-Class Universities ranking second nationwide among all cities in China (after Beijing). A number of China's most prestigious universities appearing in the global university rankings are based in Shanghai, including Fudan University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Tongji University, East China Normal University, Shanghai University, East China University of Science and Technology, Donghua University, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai International Studies University, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai University of Electric Power, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai Maritime University, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai Ocean University, Shanghai University of Engineering Science, Shanghai Institute of Technology, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and Shanghai University of Sport.[199][200][201][202] Some of these universities were selected as \"985 universities\" or \"211 universities\" since the 90s by the Chinese government in order to build world-class universities.[203][204]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fudan University\nShanghai is a seat of two members (Fudan University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University) of the C9 League, an alliance of elite Chinese universities offering comprehensive and leading education,[205] and these two universities are ranked consistently in the Asia top 10, [206][207] and in the global top 100 research comprehensive universities according to the most influential university rankings in the world such as QS Rankings, Shanghai Rankings, Times Higher Education Rankings and *U.S. News & World Report* Best Global Universities Ranking.[201][208][209][199] Fudan University established a joint EMBA program with Washington University in St. Louis in 2002 which has since consistently been ranked as one of the best in the world.[210][211]\n\n\nThe other two members of the \"Project 985\", Tongji University and East China Normal University, are also based in Shanghai and internationally; they are regarded as one of the most reputable Chinese universities by the *Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings* where they ranked 150–175th globally.[212] The city is also home to the Shanghai University of Sport, which consistently ranks the best in China among universities specialized in sports.[213] As of 2022, Shanghai University of Sport ranks #1 in Asia and #43 globally according to the \"Global Ranking of Sport Science Schools and Departments 2022\" released by Shanghai Ranking.[214]\n\n\nThe city has many Chinese–foreign joint education institutes [zh], such as the Shanghai University–University of Technology Sydney Business School since 1994, the University of Michigan–Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute since 2006, and New York University Shanghai—the first China–U.S. joint venture university—since 2012.[215][216] In 2013, the Shanghai Municipality and the Chinese Academy of Sciences founded the ShanghaiTech University in the Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park in Pudong.[217] Shanghai is also home to the cadre school China Executive Leadership Academy in Pudong and the China Europe International Business School. The city government's education agency is the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission.\n\n\nThe city is also a seat of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, China's oldest think tank for the humanities and social sciences. It is the largest one outside the capital of Beijing after the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).[218]\n\n\nBy the end of 2019, the city also had 929 secondary schools, 698 primary schools, and 31 special schools.[142] In Shanghai, the nine years of compulsory education—including five years of primary education and four years of junior secondary education—are free, with a gross enrollment ratio of over 99.9%.[142] The city's compulsory education system is among the best in the world: in 2009 and 2012, 15-year-old students from Shanghai ranked first in every subject (math, reading, and science) in the Program for International Student Assessment, a worldwide study of academic performance conducted by the OECD.[219][220] The consecutive three-year senior secondary education is priced and uses the Senior High School Entrance Examination (*Zhongkao*) as a selection process, with a gross enrollment ratio of 98%.[221] Among all senior high schools, the four with the best teaching quality—Shanghai High School, No. 2 High School Attached to East China Normal University, High School Affiliated to Fudan University, and High School Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University—are termed \"The Four Schools\" (“四校”) of Shanghai.[222] As of October 2019[update], the city's National College Entrance Examination (*Gaokao*) is structured under the \"3+3\" system, in which all general senior high school students study three compulsory subjects (Chinese, English, and math) and three subjects chosen from six options (physics, chemistry, biology, history, geography, and politics).[223]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Shanghai\n\n### Public[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Shanghai Metro is the longest metro system in the world.\n![](image)Shanghai Metro Network\nShanghai has an extensive public transportation system comprising metros, buses, ferries, and taxis, all of which can be accessed using a Shanghai Public Transport Card.[224]\n\n\nShanghai's rapid transit system, the Shanghai Metro, incorporates both subway and light metro lines and extends to every core urban district as well as neighboring suburban districts. As of 2021[update], there are 19 metro lines (excluding the Shanghai maglev train and Jinshan Railway), 515 stations, and 803 km (499 mi) of lines in operation, making it the longest network in the world.[142] On 8 March 2019, it set the city's daily metro ridership record with 13.3 million.[225] The average fare ranges from CN¥3 (US$0.48) to CN¥9 (US$1.28), depending on the travel distance.[226]\n\n\n\n![](image)A maglev train leaving Pudong International Airport\nOpened in 2004, the Shanghai maglev train is the first and the fastest commercial high-speed maglev in the world, with a maximum operation speed of 430 km/h (267 mph).[227] The train can complete the 30-kilometer (19 mi) journey between Longyang Road Station and Pudong International Airport in 7 minutes 20 seconds,[228] comparing to 32 minutes by Metro Line 2[229] and 30 minutes by car.[230] A one-way ticket costs CN¥50 (US$8), or CN¥40 (US$6.40) for those with airline tickets or public transportation cards. A round-trip ticket costs CN¥80 (US$12.80), and VIP tickets cost double the standard fare.[231]\n\n\nWith the first tram line been in service in 1908, trams were once popular in Shanghai in the early 20th century. By 1925, there were 328 tramcars and 14 routes operated by Chinese, French, and British companies collaboratively,[232] all of which were nationalized after the PRC's victory in 1949. Since the 1960s, many tram lines were either dismantled or replaced by trolleybus or motorbus lines;[233] the last tram line was demolished in 1975.[234] Shanghai reintroduced trams in 2010, as a modern rubber-tire Translohr system in Zhangjiang area of East Shanghai as Zhangjiang Tram.[235] In 2018, the steel wheeled Songjiang Tram started operating in Songjiang District.[236] Additional tram lines are under planning in Hongqiao Subdistrict and Jiading District as of 2019[update].[237]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Shanghai Trolleybus network is currently the oldest in the world.\nShanghai also has the world's most extensive bus network, including the world's oldest continuously operating trolleybus system, with 1,575 lines covering a total length of 8,997 km (5,590 mi) by 2019.[142] The system is operated by multiple companies.[238] Bus fares generally cost CN¥2 (US$0.32).[239] Shanghai also has three bus rapid transit systems, namely the Yan'an Road Medium Capacity Bus Transit System, Fengpu Express and Nantuan Express.\n\n\nAs of 2019[update], a total of 40,000 taxis were in operation in Shanghai.[142] The base fare for taxis is CN¥14 (US$2.24), which covers the first 3 km (2 mi) and includes a CN¥1 (US$0.14) fuel surcharge. The base fare is CN¥18 (US$2.55) between 11:00 pm and 5:00 am. Each additional kilometer costs CN¥2.7 (US$0.45), or CN¥4.05 (US$0.67) between 11:00 pm and 5:00 am.[240] Taxicabs and DiDi play major roles in urban transportation and DiDi is often cheaper than taxis.[241]\n\n\nAs of January 2021, Shanghai Metro has 459 stations and 772 km. The scale of operation is the first in the world. in 2017, the average daily passenger traffic of the Shanghai metro was 9.693 million, and the total passenger traffic reached 3.538 billion. It is one of the busiest metro cities in the world. The metro lines cover the central city densely and connect most districts and counties.[242]\n\n\n\n### Roads and expressways[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Expressways of Shanghai\n\n![](image)Interchange between Yan'an Elevated Road and North–South Elevated Road\nShanghai is a major hub of China's expressway network. Many national expressways (prefixed with the letter G) pass through or end in Shanghai, including Jinghu Expressway (overlaps with Hurong Expressway), Shenhai Expressway, Hushaan Expressway, Huyu Expressway, Hukun Expressway (overlaps with Hangzhou Bay Ring Expressway), and Shanghai Ring Expressway.[243] There are also numerous municipal expressways prefixed with the letter S.[243] As of 2019, Shanghai has a total of 12 bridges and 14 tunnels crossing the Huangpu River.[244][245] The Shanghai Yangtze River Bridge is the city's only bridge–tunnel complex across Yangtze River.\n\n\nThe expressway network within the city center consists of North–South Elevated Road, Yan'an Elevated Road, and Inner Ring Road. Other ring roads in Shanghai include Middle Ring Road, Outer Ring Expressway, and Shanghai Ring Expressway.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bicycle-sharing systems, such as ofo (yellow) and Mobike (orange), are common in Shanghai.\nBicycle lanes are common in Shanghai, separating non-motorized traffic from car traffic on most surface streets. However, on some main roads, including all expressways, bicycles and motorcycles are banned. In recent years, cycling has seen a resurgence in popularity due to the emergence of a large number of dockless app-based bicycle-sharing systems, such as Mobike, Bluegogo, and ofo.[246] As of December 2018[update], bicycle-sharing systems had an average of 1.15 million daily riders within the city.[247]\n\n\nPrivate car ownership in Shanghai is rapidly increasing: in 2019, there were 3.40 million private cars in the city, a 12.5% increase from 2018.[142] New private cars cannot be driven without a license plate, which are sold in monthly license plate auctions. Around 9,500 license plates are auctioned each month, and the average price is about CN¥89,600 (US$12,739) in 2019.[248] According to the city's vehicle regulations introduced in June 2016, only locally registered residents and those who have paid social insurance or individual income taxes for over three years are eligible to be in the auction. The purpose of this policy is to limit the growth of automobile traffic and alleviate congestion.[249]\n\n\n\n### Railways[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai railway station\nShanghai has four major railway stations: Shanghai railway station, Shanghai South railway station, Shanghai West railway station, and Shanghai Hongqiao railway station.[250] All are connected to the metro network and serve as hubs in the railway network of China. And now Shanghai has around twenty railway lines running under this city, which largely facilitate people's life in Shanghai.\n\n\nBuilt in 1876, the Woosung railway was the first railway in Shanghai and the first railway in operation in China[251] By 1909, Shanghai–Nanjing railway and Shanghai–Hangzhou railway were in service.[252][253] As of October 2019[update], the two railways have been integrated into two main railways in China: Beijing–Shanghai railway and Shanghai–Kunming railway, respectively.[254]\n\n\nShanghai has four high-speed railways (HSRs): Beijing–Shanghai HSR (overlaps with Shanghai–Wuhan–Chengdu passenger railway), Shanghai–Nanjing intercity railway, Shanghai–Kunming HSR, and Shanghai–Nantong railway. One HSR is under construction: Shanghai–Suzhou–Huzhou HSR.[255][256]\n\n\nShanghai also has four commuter railways: Pudong railway (passenger service is currently suspended) and Jinshan railway operated by China Railway, and Line 16 and Line 17 operated by Shanghai Metro.[257][258] As of January 2022[update], four additional lines—Chongming line, Jiamin line, Airport link line and Lianggang Express line—are under construction.[258][259]\n\n\n\n### Air and sea[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Port of Shanghai\n\n![](image)Inside Shanghai Pudong International Airport Terminal 1\n![](image)Due to Yangshan Port, Shanghai has become the world's busiest container port.\nShanghai is one of the largest air transportation hubs in Asia.[260] The city has two commercial airports: Shanghai Pudong International Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport.[261] Pudong International Airport is the primary international airport, while Hongqiao International Airport mainly operates domestic flights with limited short-haul international flights. In 2018, Pudong International Airport served 74.0 million passengers and handled 3.8 million tons of cargo, making it the ninth-busiest airport by passenger volume and third-busiest airport by cargo volume.[262][263] The same year, Hongqiao International Airport served 43.6 million passengers, making it the 19th-busiest airport by passenger volume.[262]\n\n\nSince its opening, the Port of Shanghai has rapidly grown to become the largest port in China.[264] Yangshan Port was built in 2005 because the river was unsuitable for docking large container ships. The port is connected with the mainland through the 32-kilometer (20 mi) long Donghai Bridge. Although the port is run by the Shanghai International Port Group under the government of Shanghai, it administratively belongs to Shengsi County, Zhejiang.[265]\n\n\nOvertaking the Port of Singapore in 2010,[266] the Port of Shanghai has become world's busiest container port with an annual TEU transportation of 42 million in 2018.[267] Besides cargo, the Port of Shanghai handled 259 cruises and 1.89 million passengers in 2019.[142]\n\n\nShanghai is part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to the south via the southern tip of India to Mombasa, from there to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and the Eastern Europe.[268][269][270][271][272]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Shanghai\n\n![](image)Shanghai Citi Bank Building operates a light show, shining the phrase \"I love Shanghai\".\nThe culture of Shanghai was formed by a combination of the nearby Wuyue culture and the \"East Meets West\" Haipai culture. Wuyue culture's influence is manifested in Shanghainese language—which comprises dialectal elements from nearby Jiaxing, Suzhou, and Ningbo—and Shanghai cuisine, which was influenced by Jiangsu cuisine and Zhejiang cuisine.[273] Haipai culture emerged after Shanghai became a prosperous port in the early 20th century, with numerous foreigners from Europe, America, Japan, and India moving into the city.[274] The culture fuses elements of Western cultures with the local Wuyue culture, and its influence extends to the city's literature, fashion, architecture, music, and cuisine.[275] The term Haipai—originally referring to a painting school in Shanghai—was coined by a group of Beijing writers in 1920 to criticize some Shanghai scholars for admiring capitalism and Western culture.[275][276] In the early 21st century, Shanghai has been recognized as a new influence and inspiration for cyberpunk culture.[277]\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of museums in China § Shanghai\n\n![](image)The China Art Museum, located in Pudong\nCultural curation in Shanghai has seen significant growth since 2013, with several new museums having been opened in the city.[278] This is in part due to the city's 2018 development plans, which aim to make Shanghai \"an excellent global city\".[279] As such, Shanghai has several museums of regional and national importance.[280][281] The Shanghai Museum has one of the largest collections of Chinese artifacts in the world, including a large collection of ancient Chinese bronzes and ceramics.[282] The China Art Museum, located in the former China Pavilion of Expo 2010, is one of the largest museums in Asia and displays an animated replica of the 12th century painting Along the River During the Qingming Festival.[283] The Shanghai Natural History Museum and the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum are notable natural history and science museums. In addition, there are numerous smaller, specialist museums housed in important archeological and historical sites, such as the Songze Museum,[284] the Museum of the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the site of the former Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea,[285] the Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum, and the Shanghai Post Office Museum (located in the General Post Office Building).[286]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shanghainese cuisine\n\n![](image)Xiaolongbao in Shanghai\nBenbang cuisine (本帮菜)[287] is cooking style that originated in the 1600s, with influences from surrounding provinces. It emphasizes the use of condiments while retaining the original flavors of the raw ingredients. Sugar is an important ingredient in Benbang cuisine, especially when used in combination with soy sauce. Signature dishes of Benbang cuisine include Xiaolongbao, Red braised pork belly, and Shanghai hairy crab.[288] Haipai cuisine, on the other hand, is a Western-influenced cooking style that originated in Shanghai. It absorbed elements from French, British, Russian, German, and Italian cuisines and adapted them to suit the local taste according to the features of local ingredients.[289] Famous dishes of Haipai cuisine include Shanghai-style borscht (罗宋汤, \"Russian soup\"), crispy pork cutlets, and Shanghai salad derived from Olivier salad.[290] Both Benbang and Haipai cuisine make use of a variety of seafood, including freshwater fish, shrimps, and crabs.[291]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)十万图之四 (*No. 4 of a Hundred Thousand Scenes*) by Ren Xiong, a pioneer of the Shanghai School of Chinese art, c. 1850\nThe Songjiang School (淞江派), containing the Huating School (华亭派) founded by Gu Zhengyi,[292] was a small painting school in Shanghai during the Ming and Qing Dynasties.[293] It was represented by Dong Qichang.[294] The school was considered an expansion of the Wu School in Suzhou, the cultural center of the Jiangnan region at the time.[295] In the mid 19th century, the Shanghai School movement commenced, focusing less on the symbolism emphasized by the Literati style but more on the visual content of painting through the use of bright colors. Secular objects like flowers and birds were often selected as themes.[296] Western art was introduced to Shanghai in 1847 by Spanish missionary Joannes Ferrer (范廷佐), and the city's first Western atelier was established in 1864 inside the Tushanwan orphanage [zh; fr].[297] During the Republic of China, many famous artists including Zhang Daqian, Liu Haisu, Xu Beihong, Feng Zikai, and Yan Wenliang settled in Shanghai, allowing it to gradually become the art center of China. Various art forms—including photography, wood carving, sculpture, comics (Manhua), and Lianhuanhua—thrived. Sanmao was created to dramatize the chaos created by the Second Sino-Japanese War.[298] Today, the most comprehensive art and cultural facility in Shanghai is the China Art Museum. In addition, the Chinese Painting Academy features traditional Chinese painting,[299] while the Power Station of Art displays contemporary art.[300] The city also has many art galleries, many of which are located in the M50 Art District and Tianzifang. First held in 1996, the Shanghai Biennale has become an important place for Chinese and foreign arts to interact.[301]\n\n![](image)Mei Lanfang performing the Peking opera \"Resisting the Jin Army\" at Tianchan Theatre\nTraditional Chinese opera (Xiqu) became a popular source of public entertainment in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, monologue and burlesque in Shanghainese appeared, absorbing elements from traditional dramas. The Great World opened in 1912 and was a significant stage at the time.[302] In the 1920s, Pingtan expanded from Suzhou to Shanghai.[303] Pingtan art developed rapidly to 103 programs every day by the 1930s because of the abundant commercial radio stations in the city. Around the same time, a Shanghai-style Beijing Opera was formed. Led by Zhou Xinfang and Gai Jiaotian [zh], it attracted many Xiqu masters, like Mei Lanfang, to the city.[304] A small troupe from Shengxian (now Shengzhou) also began to promote Yue opera on the Shanghainese stage.[305] A unique style of opera, Shanghai opera, was formed when local folksongs were fused with modern operas.[306] As of 2012, prominent troupes in Shanghai include Shanghai Jingju Theatre Company, Shanghai Kunqu Opera Troupe [zh], Shanghai Yue Opera House, and Shanghai Huju Opera House.[307]\n\n\nDrama appeared in missionary schools in Shanghai in the late 19th century. At the time, it was mainly performed in English. *Scandals in Officialdom* (官场丑史), staged in 1899, was one of the earliest-recorded plays.[308] In 1907, *Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly* (黑奴吁天录) was performed at the Lyceum Theatre [zh].[309] After the New Culture Movement, drama became a popular way for students and intellectuals to express their views. The city has several major institutes of theater training, including the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Centre, the Shanghai Opera House, and the Shanghai Theatre Academy. Notable theaters in Shanghai include the Shanghai Grand Theatre, the Oriental Art Center, and the People's Theatre.\n\n\n\n![](image)In this Shanghainese soap advertisement from the 1930s, two women are wearing Shanghai-styled *qipao* while playing golf.\nShanghai is considered to be the birthplace of Chinese cinema.[310] China's first short film, *The Difficult Couple* (1913), and the country's first fictional feature film, *An Orphan Rescues His Grandfather* (孤儿救祖记, 1923)[311] were both produced in Shanghai. Shanghai's film industry grew during the early 1930s, generating stars such as Hu Die, Ruan Lingyu, Zhou Xuan, Jin Yan, and Zhao Dan. Another film star, Jiang Qing, went on to become Madame Mao Zedong. The exile of Shanghainese filmmakers and actors as a result of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Communist revolution contributed enormously to the development of the Hong Kong film industry.[312] The movie *In the Mood for Love* directed by Wong Kar-wai, a Shanghai native, depicts a slice of the displaced Shanghainese community in Hong Kong and the nostalgia for that era, featuring 1940s music by Zhou Xuan.[313]\n\n\nShanghai's cultural festivals include Shanghai International Television Festival, Shanghai International Film Festival, Shanghai International Art Festival, Shanghai International Tourism Festival, Shanghai Spring International Music Festival, etc. Shanghai TV Festival is the earliest international TV festival founded in China. It was founded in 1986. The Shanghai International Film Festival was founded in 1993 and is one of the nine major international film festivals in the A category. The highest award is the \"Golden Goblet Award\"[314]\n\n\n\n### Fashion[edit]\n\n\nSince 2001, Shanghai has held its own fashion week called Shanghai Fashion Week twice every year in April and October. The main venue is in Fuxing Park, and the opening and closing ceremonies are held in the Shanghai Fashion Center. The April session is also part of the one-month Shanghai International Fashion Culture Festival.[315] Shanghai Fashion Week is considered to be an event of national significance featuring both international and Chinese designers. The international presence has included many promising young British fashion designers.[316] The event is hosted by the Shanghai Municipal Government and supported by the People's Republic Ministry of Commerce.[317]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)F1 Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai\nShanghai is home to several football teams, including two in the Chinese Super League: Shanghai Shenhua[318] and Shanghai Port.[319] China's top-tier basketball team, the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association, developed Yao Ming before he entered the NBA.[320][321] Shanghai's baseball team, the Shanghai Golden Eagles, plays in the China Baseball League.[322]\n\n\nThe Shanghai Cricket Club dates back to 1858 when the first recorded cricket match was played between a team of British Naval officers and a Shanghai 11. Following a 45-year dormancy after the founding of the PRC in 1949, the club was re-established in 1994 by expatriates living in the city and has since grown to over 300 members. The Shanghai cricket team played various international matches between 1866 and 1948. With cricket in the rest of China almost non-existent, for that period they were the de facto China national cricket team.[323]\n\n\n\n![](image)Yao Ming was born in Shanghai. He started his career with the Shanghai Sharks.\nShanghai is home to many prominent Chinese professional athletes, such as basketball player Yao Ming,[321] 110 metres hurdles Liu Xiang,[324] table tennis player Wang Liqin,[325] and badminton player Wang Yihan.[326]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai Masters in Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena\nShanghai is the host of several international sports events. Since 2004, it has hosted the Chinese Grand Prix, a round of the Formula One World Championship. The race is staged annually at the Shanghai International Circuit.[327] It hosted the 1000th Formula One race on 14 April 2019. In 2010, Shanghai became the host city of Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters, which raced in a street circuit in Pudong. In 2012, Shanghai began hosting 4 Hours of Shanghai as one round from the inaugural season of the FIA World Endurance Championship. The city also hosts the Shanghai Masters tennis tournament, which is part of ATP World Tour Masters 1000, as well as golf tournaments including the BMW Masters and WGC-HSBC Champions.[328]\n\n\nOn 21 September 2017, Shanghai hosted a National Hockey League (NHL) ice hockey exhibition game in an effort to increase fan interest for the 2017–18 NHL season.[329]\n\n\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\n### Parks and resorts[edit]\n\n\nShanghai has an extensive public park system; by 2018, the city had 300 parks, of which 281 had free admission, and the per capita park area was 8.2 m2 (88 sq ft).[330] Some of the parks also have become popular tourist attractions due to their unique location, history, or architecture.\n\n\n\n![](image)People's Square\nThe People's Square park, located in the heart of downtown Shanghai, is especially well known for its proximity to other major landmarks in the city. Fuxing Park, located in the former French Concession, features formal French-style gardens and is surrounded by high-end bars and cafes.[331]\n\n\nZhongshan Park, in western central Shanghai, is famous for its monument of Chopin, the tallest statue dedicated to the composer in the world.[332] Built in 1914 as Jessfield Park, it once contained the campus of St. John's University, Shanghai's first international college; today, the park features sakura and peony gardens and a 150-year-old platanus,[333] and it also serves as an interchange hub in the metro system.[334]\n\n\nOne of Shanghai's newer parks is the Xujiahui Park, which was built in 1999, on the former grounds of the Great Chinese Rubber Works Factory and the EMI Recording Studio (now La Villa Rouge restaurant). The park has an artificial lake with a sky bridge running across the park.[335] Shanghai Botanical Garden is located 12 km (7 mi) southwest of the city center and was established in 1978. In 2011, the largest botanical garden in Shanghai—Shanghai Chen Shan Botanical Garden—opened in Songjiang District.[336]\n\n\n\n![](image)Enchanted Storybook Castle of Shanghai Disneyland\nOther notable parks in Shanghai include Lu Xun Park, Century Park, Gucun Park, Gongqing Forest Park, and Jing'an Park.\n\n\nThe Shanghai Disney Resort Project was approved by the government on 4 November 2009[337] and opened in 2016.[338]\nThe $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Pudong features a castle that is the biggest among Disney's resorts.[339] More than 11 million people visited the resort in its first year of operation.[340]\n\n\n\n### Air pollution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pollution in China § Air pollution\n\n![](image)Huangpu District during the 2013 Eastern China smog\nAir pollution in Shanghai is not as severe as in many other Chinese cities, but is still considered substantial by world standards.[341] During the December 2013 Eastern China smog, air pollution rates reached between 23 and 31 times the international standard.[342][343] On 6 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter in Shanghai rose above 600 micrograms per cubic meter and in the surrounding area, above 700 micrograms per cubic meter.[343] Levels of PM2.5 in Putuo District reached 726 micrograms per cubic meter.[344][345] As a result, the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission received orders to suspend students' outdoor activities. Authorities pulled nearly one-third of government vehicles from the roads, while much construction work was halted. Most inbound flights were canceled, and more than 50 flights at Pudong International Airport were diverted.[346]\n\n\nOn 23 January 2014, Yang Xiong, the mayor of Shanghai, announced that three main measures would be taken to manage the air pollution in Shanghai, along with surrounding Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces.[347] The measures involved implementing the 2013 air-cleaning program, establishing a linkage mechanism with the three surrounding provinces, and improving the city's early-warning systems.[347] On 12 February 2014, China's cabinet announced that a CN¥10 billion (US$1.7 billion) fund will be set up to help companies meet the new environmental standards.[348] The effect of the policy was significant. From 2013 to 2018, more than 3,000 treatment facilities for industrial waste gases were installed, and the city's annual smoke, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide emission decreased by 65%, 54%, and 95%, respectively.[349][350]\n\n\n\n### Environmental protection[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A residual waste truck and a kitchen waste truck on Zhonghua Road\nPublic awareness of the environment is growing, and the city is investing in a number of environmental protection projects. A 16-year rehabilitation of Suzhou Creek, which runs through the city, was finished in 2012, clearing the creek of barges and factories and removing 1.3 million cubic meters of sludge.[351][352] Additionally, the government has moved almost all the factories within the city center to either the outskirts or other provinces,[353] and provided incentives for transportation companies to invest in LPG buses and taxis.\n\n\nOn 1 July 2019, Shanghai adopted a new garbage-classification system that sorts out waste into residual waste, kitchen waste, recyclable waste, and hazardous waste.[354] The wastes are collected by separate vehicles and sent to incineration plants, landfills, recycling centers, and hazardous-waste-disposal facilities, respectively.[355]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nMedia in Shanghai [zh] covers newspapers, publisher, broadcast, television, and Internet, with some media having influence over the country. In regard to foreign publications in Shanghai, Hartmut Walravens of the IFLA Newspapers Section said that when the Japanese controlled Shanghai in the 1940s \"it was very difficult to publish good papers – one either had to concentrate on emigration problems, or cooperate like the *Chronicle*\".[356]\n\n\nAs of March 2020[update], newspapers publishing in Shanghai include:\n\n\n\n* *Jiefang Daily*\n* *Oriental Sports Daily*\n* *Shanghai Review of Books*\n* *Shanghai Daily*\n* *Shanghai Star*\n* *Xinmin Evening News*\n* *Wen Hui Bao*\n* *Wenhui Book Review*\n\nNewspapers formerly

city's main broadcaster is Shanghai Media Group.\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nThe city is the seat of the New Development Bank, a multilateral development bank established by the BRICS states. \n\n\n\n### Twin towns – sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in China\n\nShanghai is twinned with:[361]\n\n\n\n* ![Japan](image) Yokohama, Japan (1973)\n*

Mumbai is the *de facto* financial centre and the most populous city of India with an estimated city proper population of 12.5 million (1.25 crore).[19] Mumbai is the centre of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the sixth most populous metropolitan area in the world with a population of over 23 million (2.3 crore) living within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.[20] Mumbai lies on the Konkan coast on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour. In 2008, Mumbai was named an alpha world city.[21][22]\n\n\nThe seven islands that constitute Mumbai were earlier home to communities of Marathi language-speaking Koli people.[23][24][25] For centuries, the seven islands of Bombay were under the control of successive indigenous rulers before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire, and subsequently to the East India Company in 1661, through the dowry of Catherine Braganza when she was married off to Charles II of England.[26] Beginning in 1782, Mumbai was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project,[27] which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea.[28] Along with the construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Mumbai into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Mumbai in the 19th century was characterized by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Mumbai as the capital.[29]\n\n\nMumbai is the financial, commercial,[30] and the entertainment capital of India. It is also one of the world's top ten centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow,[31] generating 6.16% of India's GDP,[32] and accounting for 25% of industrial output, 70% of maritime trade in India (Mumbai Port Trust, Dharamtar Port and JNPT),[33] and 70% of capital transactions to India's economy.[34][35] The city houses important financial institutions and the corporate headquarters of numerous Indian companies and multinational corporations. It is also home to some of India's premier scientific and nuclear institutes. The city is also home to the Bollywood and Marathi cinema industries. Mumbai's business opportunities attracts migrants from all over India.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe name *Mumbai* (Marathi: मुंबई, Gujarati: મુંબઈ) is derived from *Mumbā* or *Mahā-Ambā*—the name of the patron Hindu goddess (kuladevata) Mumbadevi of the native Koli community[36]—and from *ā'ī*, meaning \"mother\" in the Marathi language, which is the mother tongue of the Koli people and the official language of Maharashtra.[23][37] According to certain accounts, the Koli community, which hails from Kathiawar and Central Gujarat, is believed to have introduced their deity Mumba from Kathiawar (Gujarat), where her worship continues to this day.[24][25] However, other sources disagree that Mumbai's name was derived from the goddess Mumba.[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Mumba Devi Temple, from whom the city of Mumbai may derive its name.\nThe oldest known names for the city are *Kakamuchee* and *Galajunkja*; these are sometimes still used.[38][39] Portuguese writer Gaspar Correia recorded the name \"Bombaim\" after 1512 in his *Lendas da Índia* (*Legends of India*).[40][41] While some anglophone authors have suggested this name possibly originated as an alleged Galician-Portuguese phrase *bom baim*, meaning \"good little bay\",[42] such suggestions lack any scientific basis.[43] Portuguese linguist José Pedro Machado attributes that interpretation to a deficient knowledge of the Portuguese language of these authors, mixing up the Portuguese word \"bom\" with the English \"bay\", from the English version of the name.[43] In 1516, Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa used the name *Tana-Maiambu*: *Tana* appears to refer to the adjoining town of Thane and *Maiambu* to *Mumbadevi*.[44] The form *Bombaim* is still commonly used in Portuguese.[45]\n\n\nOther variations recorded in the 16th and the 17th centuries include: *Mombayn* (1525), *Bombay* (1538), *Bombain* (1552), *Bombaym* (1552), *Monbaym* (1554), *Mombaim* (1563), *Mombaym* (1644), *Bambaye* (1666), *Bombaiim* (1666), *Bombeye* (1676), *Boon Bay* (1690)[45][46] and *Bon Bahia*.[47] After the English gained possession of the city in the 17th century, the Portuguese name was anglicised as *Bombay*.[48] Ali Muhammad Khan, imperial dewan or revenue minister of the Gujarat province, in the *Mirat-i Ahmedi* (1762) referred to the city as *Manbai*.[49]\n\n\nThe French traveller Louis Rousselet, who visited in 1863 and 1868, states in his book *L'Inde des Rajahs*, which was first published in 1877: \"Etymologists have wrongly derived this name from the Portuguese Bôa Bahia, or (French: \"bonne bai\", English: \"good bay\"), not knowing that the tutelar goddess of this island has been, from remote antiquity, Bomba, or Mumba Devi, and that she still ... possesses a temple\".[50]\n\n\nBy the late 20th century, the city was referred to as *Mumbai* or *Mambai* in Marathi, Konkani, Gujarati, Kannada and Sindhi, and as *Bambai* in Hindi.[51] The Government of India officially changed the English name to *Mumbai* in November 1995.[52] This came at the insistence of the Marathi nationalist Shiv Sena party, which had just won the Maharashtra state elections, and mirrored similar name changes across the country and particularly in Maharashtra.[53] According to *Slate* magazine, \"they argued that 'Bombay' was a corrupted English version of 'Mumbai' and an unwanted legacy of British colonial rule.\"[54] *Slate* also said \"The push to rename Bombay was part of a larger movement to strengthen Marathi identity in the Maharashtra region.\"[55] While Mumbai is still referred to as Bombay by some of its residents and by some Indians from other regions,[56][57] mention of the city by a name other than *Mumbai* has been controversial.[58][59]\n\n\n\n### People from Mumbai[edit]\n\n\nA resident of Mumbai is called *Mumbaikar* (pronounced [mumbəikəɾ]) in Marathi, in which the suffix *-kar* means a *resident of*. The term had been in use for quite some time but it gained popularity after the official name change to Mumbai.[60] Older terms such as *Bombayite* are also used.[61][62]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Mumbai\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Mumbai.\n\nHistorical affiliations\n\n\n> \n> ![](image) Bombay Presidency 1843–1947  \n> ![](image) Bombay State 1947–1960  \n> ![](image) Maharashtra 1960–Present\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![A white Buddhist stupa.](image)Kanheri Caves contain Buddhist sculptures and paintings dating from the 1st century CE to the 10th century CE.\nMumbai is built on what was once an archipelago of seven islands: Isle of Bombay, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman's Island (also known as *Little Colaba*).[63] It is not exactly known when these islands were first inhabited. Pleistocene sediments found along the coastal areas around Kandivali in northern Mumbai suggest that the islands were inhabited since the South Asian Stone Age.[64] Perhaps at the beginning of the Common Era, or possibly earlier, they came to be occupied by the Koli fishing community.[65][66]\n\n\nIn the 3rd century BCE, the islands formed part of the Maurya Empire, during its expansion in the south, ruled by the Buddhist emperor Ashoka of Magadha.[67] The Kanheri Caves in Borivali were excavated from basalt rock in the first century CE,[68] and served as an important centre of Buddhism in Western India during ancient Times.[69] The city then was known as *Heptanesia* (Ancient Greek: A Cluster of Seven Islands) to the Greek geographer Ptolemy in 150 CE.[70] The Mahakali Caves in Andheri were cut out between the 1st century BCE and the 6th century CE.[71][72]\n\n\nBetween the 2nd century BCE and 9th century CE, the islands came under the control of successive indigenous dynasties: Satavahanas, Western Satraps, Abhira, Vakataka, Kalachuris, Konkan Mauryas, Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas,[73] before being ruled by the Shilaharas from 810 to 1260.[74] Some of the oldest edifices in the city built during this period are the Jogeshwari Caves (between 520 and 525),[75] Elephanta Caves (between the sixth to seventh century),[76] Walkeshwar Temple (10th century),[77][78] and Banganga Tank (12th century).[79][80]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Haji Ali Dargah was built in 1431, when Mumbai was under the rule of the Gujarat Sultanate.\nKing Bhimdev founded his kingdom in the region in the late 13th century and established his capital in *Mahikawati* (present day Mahim).[81] The Pathare Prabhus, among the earliest known settlers of the city, were brought to *Mahikawati* from Saurashtra in Gujarat around 1298 by Bhimdev.[82] The Delhi Sultanate annexed the islands in 1347–48 and controlled it until 1407. During this time, the islands were administered by the Muslim Governors of Gujarat, who were appointed by the Delhi Sultanate.[83][84]\n\n\nThe islands were later governed by the independent Gujarat Sultanate, which was established in 1407. As a result of the Sultanate's support, numerous mosques were built, with one notable example being the Haji Ali Dargah in Worli. Erected in 1431, this magnificent structure pays homage to the revered Muslim saint, Haji Ali.[85] From 1429 to 1431, the islands were a source of contention between the Gujarat Sultanate and the Bahmani Sultanate of Deccan.[86][87] In 1493, Bahadur Khan Gilani of the Bahmani Sultanate attempted to conquer the islands but was defeated.[88]\n\n\n\n### Portuguese and British rule[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Bombay under Portuguese rule (1534–1661) and History of Bombay under British rule\n\n![](image)The Madh Fort, built by the Portuguese, was one of the most important forts in Salsette.\nThe Mughal Empire, founded in 1526, was the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent during the mid-16th century.[89] Growing apprehensive of the power of the Mughal emperor Humayun, Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat was obliged to sign the Treaty of Bassein with the Portuguese Empire on 23 December 1534. According to the treaty, the Seven Islands of Bombay, the nearby strategic town of Bassein and its dependencies were offered to the Portuguese. The territories were later surrendered on 25 October 1535.[90]\n\n\n\n![](image)Flora Fountain, built in Neo Classical and Gothic Revival style in 1864, depicts the Roman goddess Flora.\nThe Portuguese were actively involved in the foundation and growth of their Roman Catholic religious orders in Bombay.[91] They called the islands by various names, which finally took the written form *Bombaim*. The islands were leased to several Portuguese officers during their regime. The Portuguese Franciscans and Jesuits built several churches in the city, prominent being the St. Michael's Church at Mahim (1534),[92] St. John the Baptist Church at Andheri (1579),[93] St. Andrew's Church at Bandra (1580),[94] and Gloria Church at Byculla (1632).[95] The Portuguese also built several fortifications around the city like the Bombay Castle, *Castella de Aguada* (Castelo da Aguada or Bandra Fort), and Madh Fort. The English were in constant struggle with the Portuguese vying for hegemony over Mumbai, as they recognised its strategic natural harbour and its natural isolation from land attacks. By the middle of the 17th century the growing power of the Dutch Empire forced the English to acquire a station in western India. On 11 May 1661, the marriage treaty of Charles II of England and Catherine of Braganza, daughter of King John IV of Portugal, placed the islands in possession of the English Empire, as part of Catherine's dowry to Charles.[96] However, Salsette, Bassein, Mazagaon, Parel, Worli, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala still remained under Portuguese possession. From 1665 to 1666, the English managed to acquire Mahim, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala.[97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Two views of the English fort in Bombay, c. 1665\nIn accordance with the Royal Charter of 27 March 1668, England leased these islands to the English East India Company in 1668 for a sum of £10 per annum.[98] The population quickly rose from 10,000 in 1661, to 60,000 in 1675.[99] The islands were subsequently attacked by Yakut Khan, the Muslim Koli[100][101][102][103] admiral of the Mughal Empire, in October 1672,[104] Rickloffe van Goen, the Governor-General of Dutch India on 20 February 1673,[105] and Siddi admiral Sambal on 10 October 1673.[104]\n\n\nIn 1687, the English East India Company transferred its headquarters from Surat to Mumbai. The city eventually became the headquarters of the Bombay Presidency.[106] Following the transfer, Mumbai was placed at the head of all the company's establishments in India.[107] Towards the end of the 17th century, the islands again suffered incursions from Yakut Khan in 1689–90.[108] The Portuguese presence ended in Mumbai when the Marathas under *Peshwa* Baji Rao I captured Salsette in 1737, and Bassein in 1739.[109]\nBy the middle of the 18th century, Mumbai began to grow into a major trading town, and received a huge influx of migrants from across India.[110] Later, the British occupied Salsette on 28 December 1774. With the Treaty of Surat (1775), the British formally gained control of Salsette and Bassein, resulting in the First Anglo-Maratha War.[111] The British were able to secure Salsette from the Marathas without violence through the Treaty of Purandar (1776),[112] and later through the Treaty of Salbai (1782), signed to settle the outcome of the First Anglo-Maratha War.[113]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ships in Mumbai Harbour (c. 1731). Mumbai emerged as a significant trading town during the mid-18th century.\nFrom 1782 onwards, the city was reshaped with large-scale civil engineering projects aimed at merging all the seven islands of Bombay into a single amalgamated mass by way of a causeway called the Hornby Vellard, which was completed by 1784.[27][114] In 1817, the British East India Company under Mountstuart Elphinstone defeated Baji Rao II, the last of the Maratha *Peshwa* in the Battle of Khadki.[115] Following his defeat, almost the whole of the Deccan Plateau came under British suzerainty, and was incorporated into the Bombay Presidency. The success of the British campaign in the Deccan marked the end of all attacks by native powers.[116]\n\n\nBy 1845, the seven islands coalesced into a single landmass by the Hornby Vellard project via large scale land reclamation.[28][117] On 16 April 1853, India's first passenger railway line was established, connecting Mumbai to the neighbouring town of Thana (now Thane).[118] During the American Civil War (1861–1865), the city became the world's chief cotton-trading market, resulting in a boom in the economy that subsequently enhanced the city's stature.[119]\n\n\nThe opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 transformed Mumbai into one of the largest seaports on the Arabian Sea.[120] In September 1896, Mumbai was hit by a bubonic plague epidemic where the death toll was estimated at 1,900 people per week.[121] About 850,000 people fled Mumbai and the textile industry was adversely affected.[122] While the city was the capital of the Bombay Presidency, the Indian independence movement fostered the Quit India Movement in 1942 and the Royal Indian Navy mutiny in 1946.[123][124]\n\n\n\n### Independent India[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Bombay in Independent India\n\n![](image)Municipal Corporation Building, Mumbai in 1950 (Victoria Terminus partly visible on far right)\nAfter India's independence in 1947, the territory of the Bombay Presidency retained by India was restructured into Bombay State. The area of Bombay State increased, after several erstwhile princely states that joined the Indian union were integrated into the state. Subsequently, the city became the capital of Bombay State.[125] In April 1950, Municipal limits of Mumbai were expanded by merging the Mumbai Suburban District and Mumbai City to form the Greater Mumbai Municipal Corporation.[126]\n\n\nThe Samyukta Maharashtra movement to create a separate Maharashtra state including Mumbai was at its height in the 1950s. In the *Lok Sabha* discussions in 1955, the Congress party demanded that the city be constituted as an autonomous city-state.[127] The States Reorganisation Committee recommended a bilingual state for Maharashtra–Gujarat with Mumbai as its capital in its 1955 report. Bombay Citizens' Committee, an advocacy group of leading Gujarati industrialists lobbied for Mumbai's independent status.[128]\n\n\n\nFollowing protests during the movement in which 105 people died in clashes with the police, Bombay State was reorganised on linguistic lines on 1 May 1960.[129] Gujarati-speaking areas of Bombay State were partitioned into the state of Gujarat.[130] Maharashtra State with Mumbai as its capital was formed with the merger of Marathi-speaking areas of Bombay State, eight districts from Central Provinces and Berar, five districts from Hyderabad State, and numerous princely states enclosed between them.[131] As a memorial to the martyrs of the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, Flora Fountain was renamed as *Hutatma Chowk* (Martyr's Square) and a memorial was erected.[132] \n\n![A stone statue of torch-bearers as seen at night. A fountain with a white base is in the background](image)The Hutatma Chowk memorial, built to honour the martyrs of the Samyukta Maharashtra movement (Flora Fountain on its left in the background)The following decades saw massive expansion of the city and its suburbs. In the late 1960s, Nariman Point and Cuffe Parade were reclaimed and developed.[133] The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (BMRDA) was established on 26 January 1975 by the Government of Maharashtra as an apex body for planning and co-ordination of development activities in the Mumbai metropolitan region.[134] In August 1979, a sister township of New Mumbai was founded by the City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) across the Thane and Raigad districts to help the dispersal and control of Mumbai's population. The textile industry in Mumbai largely disappeared after the widespread 1982 Great Bombay Textile Strike, in which nearly 250,000 workers in more than 50 textile mills went on strike.[135] Mumbai's defunct cotton mills have since become the focus of intense redevelopment.[136][137] Industrial development began in Mumbai when its economy started focusing on the petrochemical, electronic, and automotive sectors. In 1954 Hindustan Petroleum comissoned Mumbai Refinery at Trombay and BPCL Refinery.[138]\n\n\nThe Jawaharlal Nehru Port, which handles 55–60% of India's containerized cargo, was commissioned on 26 May 1989 across the creek at Nhava Sheva with a view to de-congest Mumbai Harbour and to serve as a hub port for the city.[139] The geographical limits of Greater Mumbai were coextensive with municipal limits of Greater Mumbai. On 1 October 1990, the Greater Mumbai district was bifurcated to form two revenue districts namely, Mumbai City and Mumbai Suburban, though they continued to be administered by same Municipal Administration.[140]\n\n\nThe years from 1990 to 2010 saw an increase in violence and terrorism activities. Following the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, the city was rocked by the Hindu-Muslim riots of 1992–93 in which more than 1,000 people were killed. In March 1993, a series of 13 coordinated bombings at several city landmarks by Islamic extremists and the Mumbai underworld resulted in 257 deaths and over 700 injuries.[141] In 2006, 209 people were killed and over 700 injured when seven bombs exploded on the city's commuter trains.[142] In 2008, a series of ten coordinated attacks by armed terrorists for three days resulted in 173 deaths, 308 injuries, and severe damage to several heritage landmarks and prestigious hotels.[143] The three coordinated bomb explosions in July 2011 that occurred at the Opera house, Zaveri Bazaar and Dadar were the latest in the series of terrorist attacks in Mumbai which resulted in 26 deaths and 130 injuries.[144][145]\n\n\nMumbai is the commercial capital of India and has evolved into a global financial hub.[146] For several decades it has been the home of India's main financial services companies, and a focus for both infrastructure development and private investment.[147] From being an ancient fishing community and a colonial centre of trade, Mumbai has become South Asia's largest city and home of the world's most prolific film industry.[148]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Mumbai\n\nSee also: South Mumbai, Western Suburbs (Mumbai), Eastern Suburbs (Mumbai), and List of neighbourhoods in Mumbai\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Mumbai\n![](image)Mumbai consists of two revenue districts.\nMumbai is on a narrow peninsula on the southwest of Salsette Island, which lies between the Arabian Sea to the west, Thane Creek to the east and Vasai Creek to the north. Mumbai's suburban district occupies most of the island. Navi Mumbai is east of Thane Creek and Thane is north of Vasai Creek. Mumbai consists of two distinct regions: Mumbai City district and Mumbai Suburban district, which form two separate revenue districts of Maharashtra.[149] The city district region is also commonly referred to as the *Island City* or South Mumbai.[32] The total area of Mumbai is 603.4 km2 (233 sq mi).[150] Of this, the island city spans 67.79 km2 (26 sq mi), while the suburban district spans 370 km2 (143 sq mi), together accounting for 437.71 km2 (169 sq mi) under the administration of Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). The remaining areas belong to various Defence establishments, the Mumbai Port Trust, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Borivali National Park, which are out of the jurisdiction of the MCGM.[151] The Mumbai Metropolitan Region which includes portions of Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts in addition to Greater Mumbai, covers an area of 4,355 km2 (1681.5 sq mi).[8]\nMumbai lies at the mouth of the Ulhas River on the western coast of India, in the coastal region known as the Konkan. It sits on Salsette Island (Sashti Island), which it partially shares with the Thane district.[152] Mumbai is bounded by the Arabian Sea to the west.[153] Many parts of the city lie just above sea level, with elevations ranging from 10 m (33 ft) to 15 m (49 ft);[154] the city has an average elevation of 14 m (46 ft).[155] Northern Mumbai (Salsette) is hilly,[156] and the highest point in the city is 450 m (1,476 ft) at Salsette in the Powai–Kanheri ranges.[157] The Sanjay Gandhi National Park (Borivali National Park) is located partly in the Mumbai suburban district, and partly in the Thane district, and it extends over an area of 103.09 km2 (39.80 sq mi).[158]\n\n\nApart from the Bhatsa Dam, there are six major lakes that supply water to the city: Vihar, Lower Vaitarna, Upper Vaitarna, Tulsi, Tansa and Powai. Tulsi Lake and Vihar Lake are located in Borivili National Park, within the city's limits. The supply from Powai lake, also within the city limits, is used only for agricultural and industrial purposes.[159] Three small rivers, the Dahisar River, Poinsar (or Poisar) and Ohiwara (or Oshiwara) originate within the park, while the Mithi River originates from Tulsi Lake and gathers water overflowing from Vihar and Powai Lakes.[160] The coastline of the city is indented with numerous creeks and bays, stretching from the Thane creek on the\neastern to Madh Marve on the western front.[161] The eastern coast of Salsette Island is covered with large mangrove swamps, rich in biodiversity, while the western coast is mostly sandy and rocky.[162]\n\n\nSoil cover in the city region is predominantly sandy due to its proximity to the sea. In the suburbs, the soil cover is largely alluvial and loamy.[163] The underlying rock of the region is composed of black Deccan basalt flows, and their acidic and basic variants dating back to the late Cretaceous and early Eocene eras.[164] Mumbai sits on a seismically active zone owing to the presence of 23 fault lines in the vicinity.[165] The area is classified as a Seismic Zone III region,[166] which means an earthquake of up to magnitude 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale may be expected.[167]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Mumbai\n\nSee also: Mumbai Climate Action Plan\n\n![The average temperature ranges between 23 °C (73 °F) in January to 30 °C (86 °F) in May. Rainfall is at or near zero from November through May, then quickly rises to a peak of about 600 mm (23.62 in) in July, falling back more gradually.](image)Average temperature and precipitation in Mumbai\n![](image)Skyline of Mumbai during a monsoon\nMumbai has an extreme tropical wet and dry climate (*Aw*) under the Köppen climate classification, although the central and northern suburbs have a tropical monsoon climate (*Am*) with even heavier wet season rainfall. Mumbai has a virtually rainless period extending from October to May and an extremely wet period peaking in July.[168] A cooler season from December to February is followed by a hotter season from March to May. The period from June to about the end of September constitutes the south west monsoon season, and October and November form the post-monsoon season.[169]\n\n\nBetween June and September, the South-west monsoon rains occur in Mumbai. Pre-monsoon showers are received in May. Occasionally, north-east monsoon showers occur in October and November. The maximum annual rainfall ever recorded was 3,452 mm (136 in) for 1954.[170] The highest rainfall recorded in a single day was 944 mm (37 in) on 26 July 2005.[171] The average total annual rainfall is 2,213.4 mm (87 in) for the Island City, and 2,502.3 mm (99 in) for the suburbs.[170]\n\n\nThe average annual temperature is 27 °C (81 °F), and the average annual precipitation is 2,213 mm (87 in).[172] In the Island City, the average maximum temperature is 31 °C (88 °F), while the average minimum temperature is 24 °C (75 °F). In the suburbs, the daily mean maximum temperature range from 29 °C (84 °F) to 33 °C (91 °F), while the daily mean minimum temperature ranges from 16 °C (61 °F) to 26 °C (79 °F).[170] The record high is 42.2 °C (108 °F) set on 14 April 1952,[173] and the record low is 7.4 °C (45 °F) set on 27 January 1962.[173][174]\n\n\nTropical cyclones are rare in the city. The worst cyclone to ever impact Mumbai was the one in 1948 where gusts reached 151 km/h (94 mph) in Juhu. The storm left 38 people dead and 47 missing. The storm reportedly impacted Mumbai for 20 hours and left the city devastated.[175][176][177]\n\n\n\nMumbai is prone to monsoon floods,[178][179] caused due to climate change that is affected by heavy rains and high tide in the sea, according to the World Bank, unplanned drainage system and informal settlement is a key factor of frequent floods in Mumbai.[180] Among other causes of flooding in Mumbai is its geographic location, Mumbai urban is peninsular in form, (a land-filled area that connects seven islands) a low laying area, compared to its suburbs that sit on an elevated location. Over the past few decades, new informal settlements were formed in the suburbs, causing a rapid increase in population, improper waste management, and drainage congestion. The rainwater from these areas heavily flows towards low-lying urban areas consisting of some slums and high-rise buildings. As a result, slums are either swamped, washed away, or collapse causing heavy casualties, and post-flood water logging lasts for a long time that causing blockage of railway lines-(most frequently used public transport in Mumbai), traffic snarl, inundated roads, and sub-merged bylanes. Over the past few decades, the frequency of floods in Mumbai is enormous, the 2005 Mumbai floods are characterized by 500-1000 deaths, household displacements, damaged infrastructure-(including heritage sites), and a financial loss of US$ 1.2 billion.[180][181] In the process of reducing floods in Mumbai, the Maharashtra government adopted a flood mitigation plan; according to which the drainage system will be restructured, restoration of Mithi River, and re-establishment of informal settlements. Local civic body Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities are assigned to forecast and issue eviction notices while BMC along with NGO's prepare for the evacuation of the residents of those areas to temporary safe camps.[180][181][182]\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for Mumbai (Colaba) 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1901–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n |

concentration in 2013 was 63 μg/m3, which is 6.3 times higher than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines[195] for the annual mean PM2.5. The Central Pollution Control Board for the Government of India and the Consulate General of the United States, Mumbai monitor and publicly share real-time air quality data.[196][197] In December 2019, IIT Bombay, in partnership with the McKelvey School of Engineering of Washington University in St. Louis launched the Aerosol and Air Quality Research Facility to study air pollution in Mumbai, among other Indian cities.[198]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Mumbai\n\n![](image)\nSome of the tallest skyscrapers of Mumbai, like World One and Lodha Park complexes, can be found in Lower Parel.\n![](image)\nAntilia and Lodha Altamount skyscrapers on Altamount Road, also known as India's Billionaires' Row.\n\nMumbai is India's largest city (by population) and is the financial and commercial capital of the country as it generates 6.16% of the total GDP.[32][146][199] It serves as an economic hub of India; as of 2006, Mumbai contributed 10% of the nation's factory employment, 25% of industrial output, 33% of income tax collections, 60% of customs duty collections, 20% of central excise tax collections, 40% of foreign trade, and ₹40 billion (equivalent to ₹130 billion or US$1.5 billion in 2023) in corporate taxes.[200]\n\n\nAlong with the rest of India, Mumbai has witnessed an economic boom since the liberalisation of 1991, the finance boom in the mid-nineties and the IT, export, services and outsourcing boom in the 2000s.[201] Although Mumbai had prominently figured as the hub of economic activity of India in the 1990s, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region's contribution to India's GDP is currently declining.[202]\n\n\nRecent estimates of the economy of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region have ranged from $368 billion to $400 billion (PPP metro GDP) ranking it either the most or second-most productive metro area of India.[14][203][204][205][15] Many of India's numerous conglomerates (including Larsen & Toubro, State Bank of India (SBI), Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), Tata Group, Godrej and Reliance),[146] and five of the Fortune Global 500 companies are based in Mumbai.[206] This is facilitated by the presence of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE), and financial sector regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).[202]\n\n\nUntil the 1970s, Mumbai owed its prosperity largely to textile mills and the seaport, but the local economy has since then diversified to include finance, engineering, diamond-polishing, healthcare and information technology.[207]\nThe key sectors contributing to the city's economy are: finance, gems & jewellery, leather processing, IT and ITES, textiles, petrochemical, electronics manufacturing, automobiles, and entertainment. Nariman Point and Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) are Mumbai's major financial centres.[202]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThree Sixty West Tower B, occupied by The Ritz-Carlton, is one of the tallest commercial skyscrapers in the city.\n![](image)\nThe Bombay Stock Exchange is the oldest stock exchange in Asia.\n\nDespite competition from Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune, Mumbai has carved a niche for itself in the information technology industry. The Santacruz Electronic Export Processing Zone (SEEPZ) and the International Infotech Park (Navi Mumbai) offer excellent facilities to IT companies.[208]\n\n\nState and central government employees make up a large percentage of the city's workforce. Mumbai also has a large unskilled and semi-skilled self-employed population, who primarily earn their livelihood as hawkers, taxi drivers, mechanics, and other such blue collar professions. The port and shipping industry is well established, with Mumbai Port being one of the oldest and most significant ports in India.[209] Dharavi, in central Mumbai, has an increasingly large recycling industry, processing recyclable waste from other parts of the city; the district has an estimated 15,000 single-room factories.[210]\n\n\nAs of 2023, Mumbai is home to the seventh-highest number of billionaires of any city.[211] With a total wealth of around $960 billion,[212][213] it is the richest Indian city and one of the richest cities in the world.[214] As of 2008[update], the Globalization and World Cities Study Group (GaWC) has ranked Mumbai as an \"Alpha world city\", third in its categories of Global cities.[21] Mumbai is the third most expensive office market in the world, and was ranked among the fastest cities in the country for business startup in 2009.[215]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\n### Civic administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Headquarters of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the largest civic organisation in the country.\nGreater Mumbai (or Brihanmumbai), an area of 603 km2 (233 sq mi),[216] consisting of the Mumbai City and Mumbai Suburban districts, extends from Colaba in the south, to Mulund and Dahisar in the north, and Mankhurd in the east. Its population as per the 2011 census was 12,442,373.[217]\n\n\nIt is administered by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) (sometimes referred to as the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai), formerly known as the *Bombay Municipal Corporation* (BMC).[153] The BMC is in charge of the civic and infrastructure needs of the metropolis.[218] The mayor, who serves for a term of two and a half years, is chosen through an indirect election by the councillors from among themselves.[219]\n\n\nThe municipal commissioner is the chief executive officer and head of the executive arm of the municipal corporation. All executive powers are vested in the municipal commissioner who is an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer appointed by the state government. Although the municipal corporation is the legislative body that lays down policies for the governance of the city, it is the commissioner who is responsible for the execution of the policies. The commissioner is appointed for a fixed term as defined by state statute. The powers of the commissioner are those provided by statute and those delegated by the corporation or the standing committee.[220]\n\n\nThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation was ranked 9th out of 21 cities for best governance & administrative practices in India in 2014. It scored 3.5 on 10 compared to the national average of 3.3.[221]\n\n\n\n![A brown building with a central tower and sloping roofs surrounded by trees. A grassy ground and a coconut tree are in front of it.](image)The Bombay High Court exercises jurisdiction over Maharashtra, Goa, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.\nThe two revenue districts of Mumbai come under the jurisdiction of a District Collector. The collectors are in charge of property records and revenue collection for the central government, and oversee the national elections held in the city.\n\n\nThe Mumbai Police is headed by a police commissioner, who is an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer. The Mumbai Police is a division of the Maharashtra Police, under the state Home Ministry.[222] The city is divided into seven police zones and seventeen traffic police zones,[151] each headed by a deputy commissioner of police.[223] The Mumbai Traffic Police is a semi-autonomous body under the Mumbai Police. The Mumbai Fire Brigade, which is under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation, is headed by the chief fire officer, who is assisted by four deputy chief fire officers and six divisional officers.[151] The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is responsible for infrastructure development and planning of Mumbai Metropolitan Region.[224]\n\n\nMumbai is the seat of the Bombay High Court, which exercises jurisdiction over the states of Maharashtra and Goa, and the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.[225] Mumbai also has two lower courts, the Small Causes Court for civil matters, and the Sessions Court for criminal cases. Mumbai also has a special Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (TADA) court for people accused of conspiring and abetting acts of terrorism in the city.[226]\n\n\n\n### National politics[edit]\n\n\n![Men in traditional Indian dresses posing for a photograph](image)First session of the Indian National Congress in Mumbai (28–31 December 1885)\nMumbai had been a traditional stronghold and birthplace of the Indian National Congress, also known as the Congress Party.[227] The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in Mumbai from 28 to 31 December 1885.[228] The city played host to the Indian National Congress six times during its first 50 years, and became a strong base for the Indian independence movement during the 20th century.[229]\n\n\nThe 1960s saw the rise of regionalist politics in Mumbai, with the formation of the Shiv Sena on 19 June 1966, under the leadership of Balasaheb Thackeray out of a feeling of resentment about the relative marginalisation of the native Marathi people in Mumbai.[230] Shiv Sena switched from 'Marathi Cause' to larger 'Hindutva Cause' in 1985 and joined hands with Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) in the same year.[231] The Congress had dominated the politics of Mumbai from independence until the early 1980s, when the Shiv Sena won the 1985 Mumbai Municipal Corporation elections.[232]\n\n\nIn 1989, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a major national political party, forged an electoral alliance with the Shiv Sena to dislodge the Congress in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections. In 1999, several members left the Congress to form the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) but later allied with the Congress as part of an alliance known as the Democratic Front.[233] Other parties such as Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and several independent candidates also contest elections in the city.[234]\n\n\nIn the Indian national elections held every five years, Mumbai is represented by six parliamentary constituencies: North, North West, North East, North Central, South Central, and South.[235] A member of parliament (MP) to the *Lok Sabha*, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, is elected from each of the parliamentary constituencies. In the 2019 national election, all six parliamentary constituencies were won by the BJP and Shiv Sena in alliance, with both parties winning three seats each.[236]\n\n\n\n![](image)Maharashtra Legislative Assembly\nIn the Maharashtra state assembly elections held every five years, Mumbai is represented by 36 assembly constituencies.[237][238] A member of the legislative assembly (MLA) to the Maharashtra *Vidhan Sabha* (legislative assembly) is elected from each of the assembly constituencies. In the 2019 state assembly election, out of the 36 assembly constituencies, 16 were won by the BJP, 11 by the Shiv Sena, 6 by the Congress, 2 by the NCP and one by independent candidate.[239]\n\n\nElections are also held every five years to elect corporators to power in the MCGM.[240] The Corporation comprises 227 directly elected Councillors representing the 24 municipal wards, five nominated Councillors having special knowledge or experience in municipal administration, and a mayor whose role is mostly ceremonial.[241][242][243] In the 2012 municipal corporation elections, out of the 227 seats, the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance secured 107 seats, holding power with the support of independent candidates in the MCGM, while the Congress-NCP alliance bagged 64 seats.[244] The tenure of the mayor, deputy mayor, and municipal commissioner is two and a half years.[245]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Mumbai\n\n![](image)\nRapid transit map of Mumbai\n![](image)\nThe Mumbai Suburban Railway system carries more than 69.9 lakh (6.99 million) commuters on a daily basis. It has the highest passenger density of any urban railway system in the world.\n![](image)\nMumbai Metro provides connectivity with eastern and western part of the city.\n![](image)\nThe Mumbai Monorail, opened in February 2014, is the only operational monorail system in India and also is the seventh largest Monorail system in the world.\n![](image)\nBEST buses carry a total of 2.8 million passengers daily.\n![](image)\nThe black and yellow Premier Padmini Taxis are iconic of Mumbai.\n![](image)\nThe Bandra-Worli Sea Link is a 5.6 kilometers long cable-stayed bridge that connects central Mumbai with its western suburbs.\n![](image)\nChhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, Mumbai, India\n![](image)\nJawaharlal Nehru Port is the busiest port in India.\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\nPublic transport systems in Mumbai include the Mumbai Suburban Railway, Monorail, Metro, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses, black-and-yellow meter taxis, auto rickshaws and ferries. Suburban railway and BEST bus services together accounted for about 88% of the passenger traffic in 2008.[246] Auto rickshaws are allowed to operate only in the suburban areas of Mumbai, while taxis are allowed to operate throughout Mumbai, but generally operate in South Mumbai.[247] Taxis and Auto rickshaws in Mumbai are required by law to run on compressed natural gas (CNG),[248] and are a convenient, economical, and easily available means of transport.[247]\n\n\n\n#### Railway[edit]\n\n\nThe Mumbai Suburban Railway, popularly referred to as Locals forms the backbone of the city's transport system.[249] It is operated by the Central Railway and Western Railway zones of the Indian Railways.[250] Mumbai's suburban rail systems carried a total of 63 lakh (6.3 million) passengers every day in 2007.[251] Trains are overcrowded during peak hours, with nine-car trains of rated capacity 1,700 passengers, actually carrying around 4,500 passengers at peak hours.[252] The Mumbai rail network is spread at an expanse of 319 route kilometres. 191 rakes (train-sets) of 9 car and 12 car composition are utilised to run a total of 2,226 train services in the city.[253]\n\n\nThe Mumbai Monorail and Mumbai Metro have been built and are being extended in phases to relieve the overcrowding on the existing network. The Monorail opened in early February 2014.[254] The first line of the Mumbai Metro opened in early June 2014.[255]\n\n\nMumbai is the headquarters of two zones of the Indian Railways: the Central Railway (CR) headquartered at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus), and the Western Railway (WR) headquartered at Churchgate.[256] Mumbai is also well connected to most parts of India by the Indian Railways. Long-distance trains originate from Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, Dadar, Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, Mumbai Central, Bandra Terminus, Andheri and Borivali.[257]\n\n\n\n#### Bus[edit]\n\n\nMumbai's bus services carried over 55 lakh (5.5 million) passengers per day in 2008,[246] which dropped to 28 lakh (2.8 million) in 2015.[258] Public buses run by BEST cover almost all parts of the metropolis, as well as parts of Navi Mumbai, Mira-Bhayandar and Thane.[259] The BEST operates a total of 4,608 buses[260] with CCTV cameras installed, ferrying 45 lakh (4.5 million) passengers daily[246] over 390 routes. Its fleet consists of single-decker, double-decker, vestibule, low-floor, disabled-friendly, air-conditioned and Euro III compliant diesel and compressed natural gas powered buses.[261] BEST introduced air-conditioned buses in 1998.[262] BEST buses are red in colour, based originally on the Routemaster buses of London.[263]\nMaharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC, also known as ST)[264] buses provide intercity transport connecting Mumbai with other towns and cities of Maharashtra and nearby states.[265][266] The Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport (NMMT) and Thane Municipal Transport (TMT) also operate their buses in Mumbai, connecting various nodes of Navi Mumbai and Thane to parts of Mumbai.[267][268]\n\n\nBuses are generally favoured for commuting short to medium distances, while train fares are more economical for longer distance commutes.[269]\n\n\nThe *Mumbai Darshan* is a tourist bus service which explores numerous tourist attractions in Mumbai.[270] Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) lanes have been planned throughout Mumbai.[271] Though 88% of the city's commuters travel by public transport, Mumbai still continues to struggle with traffic congestion.[272] Mumbai's transport system has been categorised as one of the most congested in the world.[273]\n\n\n\n#### Water[edit]\n\n\nWater transport in Mumbai consists of ferries, hovercraft and catamarans. Services are provided by both government agencies as well as private partners.[274] Hovercraft services plied briefly in the late 1990s between the Gateway of India and CBD Belapur in Navi Mumbai. They were subsequently scrapped due to lack of adequate infrastructure.[275]\n\n\n\n### Road[edit]\n\n\nMumbai is served by National Highway 48, National Highway 66, National Highway 160 and National Highway 61.[276] The Mumbai–Chennai and Mumbai–Delhi prongs of the Golden Quadrilateral system of National Highways start from the city. The Mumbai-Pune Expressway was the first expressway built in India.[277] The Eastern Freeway was opened in 2013. The Bandra-Worli Sea Link bridge, along with Mahim Causeway, links the island city to the western suburbs.[278] The three major road arteries of the city are the Eastern Express Highway from Sion to Thane, the Sion Panvel Expressway from Sion to Panvel and the Western Express Highway from Bandra to Bhayander.[279] The under-construction Mumbai Trans Harbour Link will connect Mumbai with Navi Mumbai and when completed, will be the longest sea bridge in India.[280] Mumbai has approximately 1,900 km (1,181 mi) of roads.[281] There are five tolled entry points to the city by road.[282]\n\n\nMumbai had about 721,000 private vehicles as of March 2014,[283] 56,459 black and yellow taxis as of 2005[update],[284] and 106,000 auto rickshaws, as of May 2013.[285]\n\n\nMumbai currently has one operational expressway–the Mumbai–Pune Expressway, which directly connects Mumbai with Pune. In the coming years, the great metropolis will be connected with more expressways. They are as follows:\n\n\n\n* Delhi–Mumbai Expressway: Under construction since March 2019,[286] to be completed by December 2023.[287][288]\n* Mumbai–Nagpur Expressway: Under construction since January 2019,[289] to be completed by December 2023.[290][291]\n* Konkan Expressway: Proposed.[292]\n\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\nThe Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (formerly Sahar International Airport) is the main aviation hub in the city and the second busiest airport in India in terms of passenger traffic.[293] It handled 36.6 million (3.66 crore) passengers and 694,300 tonnes of cargo during FY 2014–2015.[294] An upgrade plan was initiated in 2006, targeted at increasing the capacity of the airport to handle up to 40 million (4 crore) passengers annually[295] and the new terminal T2 was opened in February 2014.[296]\n\n\nThe proposed Navi Mumbai International airport to be built in the Kopra-Panvel area has been sanctioned by the Indian Government and will help relieve the increasing traffic burden on the existing airport.[297]\n\n\nThe Juhu Aerodrome was India's first airport, and now hosts the Bombay Flying Club and a heliport operated by state-owned Pawan Hans.[298]\n\n\n\n### Sea[edit]\n\n\nMumbai is served by two major ports, Mumbai Port Trust and Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, which lies just across the creek in Navi Mumbai.[299] Mumbai Port has one of the best natural harbours in the world, and has extensive wet and dry dock accommodation facilities.[300] Jawaharlal Nehru Port, commissioned on 26 May 1989, is the busiest and most modern major port in India.[301] It handles 55–60% of the country's total containerised cargo.[302] Ferries from Ferry Wharf in Mazagaon allow access to islands near the city.[303]\n\n\nThe city is also the headquarters of the Western Naval Command, and also an important base for the Indian Navy.[153]\n\n\n\n## Utility services[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mumbai's water sources\n\nUnder colonial rule, tanks were the only source of water in Mumbai, with many localities having been named after them. The MCGM supplies potable water to the city from six lakes,[304][305] most of which comes from the Tulsi and Vihar lakes. The Tansa lake supplies water to the western suburbs and parts of the island city along the Western Railway.[306] The water is filtered at Bhandup,[306] which is Asia's largest water filtration plant.[307][308][309] India's first underground water tunnel was completed in Mumbai to supply water to the Bhandup filtration plant.[310][311]\n\n\n\n![](image)Deonar dumping ground seen behind the Eastern Express Highway\nAbout 700 million (70 crore) litres of water, out of a daily supply of 3.5 billion (350 crore) litres, is lost by way of water thefts, illegal connections and leakages, per day in Mumbai.[312] Almost all of Mumbai's daily refuse of 7,800 metric tonnes, of which 40 metric tonnes is plastic waste,[313] is transported to dumping grounds in Gorai in the northwest, Mulund in the northeast, and to the Deonar dumping ground in the east.[314] Sewage treatment is carried out at Worli and Bandra, and disposed of by two independent marine outfalls of 3.4 km (2.1 mi) and 3.7 km (2.3 mi) at Bandra and Worli respectively.[315]\n\n\nElectricity is distributed by the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking in the island city, and by Adani Transmission,[316] Tata Power and the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd (Mahavitaran) in the suburbs.[317] Power supply cables are underground, which reduces pilferage, thefts and other losses.[318][319]\n\n\nCooking gas is supplied in the form of liquefied petroleum gas cylinders sold by state-owned oil companies,[320] as well as through piped natural gas supplied by Mahanagar Gas Limited.[321]\n\n\nThe largest telephone service provider is the state-owned MTNL, which held a monopoly over fixed line and cellular services up until 2000, and provides fixed line as well as mobile WLL services.[322] Mobile phone coverage is extensive, and the main service providers are Vodafone Essar, Airtel, MTNL, Loop Mobile, Reliance Communications, Idea Cellular and Tata Indicom. Both GSM and CDMA services are available in the city.[323] Mumbai, along with the area served by telephone exchanges in Navi Mumbai and Kalyan is classified as a *Metro* telecom circle.[324] Many of the above service providers also provide broadband internet and wireless internet access in Mumbai. As of 2014[update], Mumbai had the highest number of internet users in India with 16.4 million (1.64 crore) users.[325]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Growth of Mumbai\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1971  | 5,970,575 | —     |\n| 1981  | 8,243,405 | +38.1% |\n| 1991  | 9,925,891 | +20.4% |\n| 2001  | 11,914,398 | +20.0% |\n| 2011  | 12,478,447 | +4.7% |\n| Data is based on Government of India Census.Source: MMRDA[326] |\n\n\n![](image)Shri Siddhivinayak Temple is one of the most popular Hindu temples in the city.\nAccording to the 2011 census, the population of Mumbai city was 12,479,608. The population density is estimated to be about 20,482 persons per square kilometre. The living space is 4.5 square metres per person.[327] Mumbai Metropolitan Region was home to 20,748,395 people by 2011.[10] Greater Mumbai, the area under the administration of the MCGM, has a literacy rate of 94.7%, higher than the national average of 86.7%. The number of slum-dwellers in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region is estimated to be 90 lakh (9 million), up from 60 lakh (6 million) in 2001 which constitutes approximately 38.5% of the region.[328][329]\n\n\nThe sex ratio in 2011 was 838 females per 1,000 males in the island city, 857 in the suburbs, and 848 as a whole in Greater Mumbai, all numbers lower than the national average of 914 females per 1,000 males. The low sex ratio is partly because of the large number of male migrants who come to the city to work.[330]\n\n\nResidents of Mumbai call themselves *Mumbaikar*,[60] *Mumbaiite*,[331] *Bombayite* or *Bombaiite*.\n\n\nMumbai suffers from the same major urbanization problems seen in many fast growing cities in developing countries: poverty and unemployment. With available land at a premium, Mumbai residents often reside in cramped, relatively expensive housing, usually far from workplaces, and therefore requiring long commutes on crowded mass transit, or clogged roadways. Many of them live close to bus or train stations, although suburban residents spend significant time travelling southward to the main commercial district.[332] Dharavi, Asia's second largest slum (if Karachi's Orangi Town is counted as a single slum)[333] is located in central Mumbai and houses between 800,000 and 10 lakh (one million) people[334] in 2.39 km2 (0.92 sq mi), making it one of the most densely populated areas on Earth[335] with a population density of at least 334,728 persons per square kilometre.[336]\n\n\nThe number of migrants to Mumbai from outside Maharashtra during the 1991–2001 decade was 11.2 lakh (1.12 million), which amounted to 54.8% of the net addition to the population of Mumbai.[337]\n\n\nThe number of households in Mumbai is forecast to rise from 42 lakh (4.2 million) in 2008 to 66 lakh (6.6 million) in 2020. The number of households with annual incomes of 20 lakh (2 million) rupees will increase from 4% to 10% by 2020, amounting to 660,000 families. The number of households with incomes from 10 to 20 lakh (1–2 million) rupees is also estimated to increase from 4% to 15% by 2020.[338] According to the 2016 report of the Central Pollution Control Board, Mumbai is the noisiest city in India, ahead of Lucknow, Hyderabad and Delhi.[339]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups and religions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Maharashtra\n\nReligion in Mumbai City (2011)[340]\n\n\n\nHinduism (65.99%)\nIslam (20.65%)\nJainism (4.10%)\nBuddhism (4.85%)\nChristianity (3.27%)\nSikhism (0.49%)\nOther (0.65%)\n\nThe religious groups represented in Greater Mumbai as of 2011 include Hindus (65.99%), Muslims (20.65%), Buddhists (4.85%), Jains (4.10%), Christians (3.27%) and Sikhs (0.49%).[341][342][343] The linguistic/ethnic demographics in the Greater Mumbai Area are: Maharashtrians (32%), Gujaratis (20%), with the rest hailing from other parts of India.[344]\n\n\nNative Christians include East Indian Catholics, who were converted by the Portuguese during the 16th century,[345] while Goan and Mangalorean Catholics also constitute a significant portion of the Christian community of the city.[*citation needed*] Jews settled in Mumbai during the 18th century. The Bene Israeli Jewish community of Mumbai, who migrated from the Konkan villages, south of Mumbai, are believed to be the descendants of the Jews of Israel who were shipwrecked off the Konkan coast, probably in the year 175 BCE, during the reign of the Greek ruler, Antiochus IV Epiphanes.[346] Mumbai is also home to the largest population of Parsi Zoroastrians in the world,[347] numbering about 60,000, however their population is declining rapidly.[348] Parsis migrated to India from Greater Iran following the Muslim conquest of Persia in the seventh century.[349] The oldest Muslim communities in Mumbai include the Dawoodi Bohras, Ismaili Khojas, and Konkani Muslims.[350]\n\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nLanguages in Mumbai (2011)[351][352][353]\n\n\n\nMarathi (35.30%)\nHindi (25.90%)\nGujarati (20.40%)\nUrdu (11.69%)\nOthers (11.64%)\n\nMarathi is the official and working language of the bureaucracy along with English. Mumbai has a large polyglot population like all other metropolitan cities of India. Sixteen major languages of India are spoken in Mumbai, with the most common being Marathi and its dialect East Indian. Marathi, and its dialect, as a single language is spoken by 35.30% of the population around 4,396,870 people.[354] Hindi is spoken by 25.90% of the population around 3,582,719 people, making it the second largest dominant language in Mumbai.

Limited land resources and an exponential increase in urban population were the primary reasons for Mumbai's vertical growth compared to other Tier 1 Indian cities.[408]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of Mumbai and Heritage structures in Mumbai\n\n![](image)Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus\nThe architecture of the city is a blend of Gothic Revival, Indo-Saracenic, Art Deco, and other contemporary styles.

The total population had declined by 0.8 percent from the time of the census five years previously, the first time it had declined since the 1945 census.[5]\n\n\nSince 2010, Japan has experienced net population loss due to falling birth rates and minimal immigration, despite having one of the highest life expectancies in the world, at 85.00 years as of 2016[update] (it stood at 81.25 as of 2006).[6] Using the annual estimate for October of each year, the population peaked in 2008 at 128,083,960 and had fallen by 2,983,352 by October 2021.[7]\n\n\nBased on 2012 data from the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, Japan's population will keep declining by about one million people every year in the coming decades, which would leave it with a population of around 70 million by 2060 and 42 million by early 22nd century if the current projections do not change.[8] More than 40% of the population is expected to be over the age of 65 in 2060.[9] In 2021 the population had for fifteen consecutive years declined by 644,000 on this year, the largest drop on record since 1945 and also reflecting a record low of 831,000 births. As of 2013[update] more than 20 percent of the population of Japan were aged 65 and over.[10]\n\n\nThe population consisted of 47,062,743 households, with 78.7% in urban areas (July 2000). High population density; 329.5 people per square kilometer for total area; 1,523 persons per square kilometer for habitable land. More than 50% of the population lives on 2% of the land. (July 1993).[11] According to research in 2009, the population to land density ratio has gradually increased, now at 127 million per 337 km2. Compared to the findings of July 1993 as well as in July 2000, the population density has greatly increased, from 50% of the population living on 2% of the land to 77%. However, as the years have progressed since the last recordings of the population, Japan's population has decreased, raising concern about the future of Japan. There are many causes, such as the declining birthrates, as well as the ratio of men to women since the last measurements from the years of 2006 and 2010. According to the Japanese Health Ministry, the population is estimated to drop from its current state of 125.58 million to 86.74 million by the year 2060.[12]\n\n\nJapan dropped from the 7th most populous country in the world to 8th in 1990, to 9th in 1998, to 10th in the early 21st century, and to 11th in 2020.[13][14] Over the period of 2010 to 2015, the population shrank by almost a million,[15] and Japan lost a half-million in 2022 alone.[16] The number of Japanese citizens decreased by 801,000 to 122,423,038 in 2022 from a year earlier, which was the most severe decrease and the first time all 47 prefectures have suffered a decline since the launch of the poll in 1968. The nation's population reached 128,057,352 Japanese people by early 2010, making up some 8% of the total population. However, the long-lasting effects of Japanese economic crisis during the Great Recession strongly slowed down immigration rates in Japan in 2010s.\n\n\nIn March 2011, Japan suffered from a massive earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent Fukushima nuclear disaster, resulting in nearly 16,000 deaths, a reduction of about 1.39 years in the average life expectancy, an ultimate decrease in birth rates, and a marked decrease in immigration rates following the natural disasters, the worst since the end of World War II.\n\n\nFrom January 2020 to December 2021, as a direct effect of COVID-19 pandemic, Japan registered at least 18,000 deaths, a loss of about 2.6 years in the average life expectancy, a noticeable decrease in birth rates and a marked decrease in immigration rates, the overall effect being a record natural population decline of 798,214 units[*clarification needed*] in that year, the largest ever recorded since 1918 (at the time of World War I, Spanish flu pandemic, and the Great Kanto earthquake).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to a demographic study conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, as of 2023, Japan's population was 125.4 million residents including foreign residents[*Does this mean foreign nationals resident in Japan?*], declined from 128 million people in 2010 to its lowest level on record since 1900, with fewer of almost 511,000 people from the previous year.[17][18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Japanese population density map per prefecture as of 2022 per square kilometer0–100\n 101–200\n 201–300\n 301–400\n 401–500\n 500–1000\n 1000–5514\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

It ranks 35th in a list of countries by population density. Between 1955 and 1989, land prices in the six largest cities increased by 15,000% (+12% per year compound). Urban land prices generally increased 40% from 1980 to 1987; in the six largest cities, the price of land doubled over that period. For many families, this trend put housing in central cities out of reach.[11]\n\n\nThe result was lengthy commutes for many workers in the big cities, especially in the Tokyo area where daily commutes of two hours each way are common.[11] In 1991, as the bubble economy started to collapse, land prices began a steep decline, and within a few years fell 60% below their peak.[21] After a decade of declining land prices, residents began moving back into central city areas (especially Tokyo's 23 wards), as evidenced by 2005 census figures. Despite nearly 70% of Japan being covered by forests,[22] parks in many major cities—especially Tokyo and Osaka—are smaller and scarcer than in major West European or North American cities. As of 2014, parkland per inhabitant in Tokyo is 5.78 square meters,[23] which is roughly half of the 11.5 square meters of Madrid.[24]\n\n\nNational and regional governments devote resources to making regional cities and rural areas more attractive by developing transportation networks, social services, industry, and educational institutions to try to decentralize settlement and improve the quality of life. Nevertheless, major cities, especially Tokyo, Yokohama and Fukuoka, and to a lesser extent Kyoto, Osaka and Nagoya, remain attractive to young people seeking education and jobs.[11]\n\n\n\n### Urban distribution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Distribution of population[25] by regions (blue shades) and prefectures (red: most populous; green: less).  \nKANTO, KEIHANSHIN and TOKAI are three largest metropolitan areas which have about 2/3 of total population of Japan. Out of 47 prefectures, 13 are red and 34 are green.  \nThe population of Japan has been decreasing since 2011. Only 8 prefectures had increased its population compared to 2010, due to internal migration to large cities.\n\n\n| External images |\n| --- |\n| Views of the World |\n| ![image icon](image) Japan Gridded Population Cartogram |\n| ![image icon](image) Japan Gridded Population |\n\n\nJapan has a high population concentration in urban areas on the plains since 75% of Japan's land area is made up of mountains,[26] and also Japan has a forest cover rate of 68.5% (the only other developed countries with such a high forest cover percentage are Finland and Sweden).[22]\nThe 2010 census shows 90.7% of the total Japanese population live in cities.[27]\n\n\nJapan is an urban society with about only 5% of the labor force working in agriculture. Many farmers supplement their income with part-time jobs in nearby towns and cities. About 80 million of the urban population is heavily concentrated on the Pacific shore of Honshu.[28]\n\n\nMetropolitan Tokyo-Yokohama, with its population of 35 million residents, is the world's most populous city. Japan faces the same problems that confront urban industrialized societies throughout the world: overcrowded cities and congested highways.\n\n\n\n### Age structure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Aging of Japan\n\nJapan's population is aging faster than that of any other nation.[29] The population of those 65 years or older roughly doubled in 24 years, from 7.1% of the population in 1970 to 14.1% in 1994.

migration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Migration in Japan\n\nBetween 6 million and 7 million people moved their residences each year during the 1980s. About 50% of these moves were within the same prefecture; the others were relocations from one prefecture to another. During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education. Out-migration from rural prefectures continued in the late 1980s, but more slowly than in previous decades.[11]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, government policy provided support for new urban development away from the large cities, particularly Tokyo, and assisted regional cities to attract young people to live and work there. Regional cities offered familiarity to those from nearby areas, lower costs of living, shorter commutes, and, in general, a more relaxed lifestyle than could be had in larger cities. Young people continued to move to large cities, however, to attend universities and find work, but some returned to regional cities (a pattern known as U-turn) or to their prefecture of origin (referred to as \"J-turn\"), or even moved to a rural area for the first time (\"I-turn\").[11][51]\n\n\nGovernment statistics show that in the 1980s significant numbers of people left the largest central cities (Tokyo and Osaka) to move to suburbs within their metropolitan areas. In 1988, more than 500,000 people left Tokyo, which experienced a net loss through migration of nearly 73,000 for the year. Osaka had a net loss of nearly 36,000 in the same year.[11]\n\n\nWith a decreasing total population, internal migration results in only eight prefectures showing an increase in population. These are Okinawa \n(2.9%), Tokyo \n(2.7%), Aichi \n(1.0%), Saitama \n(1.0%), Kanagawa \n(0.9%), Fukuoka \n(0.6%), Shiga \n(0.2%), and Chiba \n(0.1%).[52]\n\n\n\n### Emigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japanese diaspora\n\nAbout 663,300 Japanese were living abroad, approximately 75,000 of whom had permanent foreign residency, more than six times the number who had that status in 1975. More than 200,000 Japanese went abroad in 1990 for extended periods of study, research, or business assignments. As the government and private corporations have stressed internationalization, greater numbers of individuals have been directly affected, decreasing Japan's historical insularity. By the late 1980s, these problems, particularly the bullying of returnee children in schools, had become a major public issue both in Japan and in Japanese communities abroad.[11]\n\n\nCities with significant populations of Japanese nationals in 2015 included: \n\n\n\n* Los Angeles, United States: 68,689\n* Bangkok, Thailand: 48,700\n* Shanghai, China: 46,115\n* New York, United States: 44,636\n* Singapore: 36,963\n* London, United Kingdom: 36,721\n* Sydney, Australia: 30,448\n* Vancouver, Canada: 26,999\n* Hong Kong: 26,869\n* San Francisco, United States: 18,777\n* Toronto, Canada: 13,410\n\n\nNote: The above data shows the number of Japanese nationals living overseas. It was published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan and relates to 2015.[53]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Japan\n\nAccording to the Japanese immigration centre, the number of foreign residents in Japan has steadily increased, and the number of foreign residents exceeded 2.8 million people in 2020.[54]\n\n\nIn 2020, the number of foreigners in Japan was 2,887,116. This includes 325,000 Filipinos, many of whom are married to Japanese nationals and possessing some degree of Japanese ancestry,[55][56] 208,538 Brazilians, the majority possessing some degree of Japanese ancestry,[56] 778,112 Chinese, 448,053 Vietnamese and 426,908 South Koreans. Chinese, Vietnamese, Koreans, Filipinos and Brazilians account for about 77% of foreign residents in Japan.\n\n\nThe current issue of the shrinking workforce in Japan alongside its aging population has resulted in a recent need to attract foreign labour to the country. Reforms which took effect in 2015 relax visa requirements for \"Highly Skilled Foreign Professionals\" and create a new type of residence status with an unlimited period of stay.\n\n\nThe number of naturalizations peaked in 2008 at 16,000, declining to over 9,000 in the most recent year for which data are available.[57] Most of the decline is accounted for by a steep reduction in the number of Japan-born Koreans taking Japanese citizenship. Historically the bulk of those taking Japanese citizenship have not been foreign-born immigrants but rather Japanese-born descendants of Koreans and Taiwanese who lost their citizenship in the Japanese Empire in 1947 as part of the American Occupation policy for Japan.\n\n\nJapanese statistical authorities do not collect information on ethnicity, only nationality.[58] As a result, both native and naturalized Japanese citizens are counted in a single group.[59] Although official statistics therefore show homogeneity, other analyses describe the population as “multi-ethnic”.[60][61][62]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Japan\n\n| Languages of Japan |\n| --- |\n| Official | None[63] |\n| National | Standard Japanese |\n| Main | Standard Japanese |\n| Indigenous | Ainu |\n| Regional | Japanese dialects, Amami-Ōshima, Kunigami, Miyako, Okinawan, Yaeyama, Yonaguni |\n| Minority | Bonin English, Matagi, Nivkh, Orok, Sanka, Zainichi Korean |\n| Immigrant | Chinese, Korean, Mongolian, Portuguese, Spanish |\n| Foreign | Arabic, Bengali, Burmese, Chinese, Dutch, English, Filipino, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Khmer, Korean, Kurdish, Lao, Malay, Nepali, Persian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese |\n| Signed | Japanese Sign LanguageAmami Oshima Sign LanguageMiyakubo Sign Language |\n| Keyboard layout | JIS\n |\n\nThe most widely spoken language in Japan is Japanese, which is separated into several dialects with Tokyo dialect considered Standard Japanese.\nIn addition to the Japanese language, Ryūkyūan languages are spoken in Okinawa and parts of Kagoshima in the Ryūkyū Islands. Along with Japanese, these languages are part of the Japonic language family, but they are separate languages,[*citation needed*] and are not mutually intelligible with Japanese, or with each other. All of the spoken Ryukyuan languages are classified by UNESCO as endangered.\n\n\nIn Hokkaidō, there is the Ainu language, which is spoken by the Ainu people, who are the indigenous people of the island. The Ainu languages, of which Hokkaidō Ainu is the only extant variety, are isolated and do not fall under any language family. Ever since the Meiji period, Japanese has become widely used among the Ainu people and consequently Ainu languages have been classified critically endangered by UNESCO.[64]\n\n\n\nIn addition, languages such as Orok, Evenki and Nivkh spoken in formerly Japanese controlled southern Sakhalin are becoming more and more endangered. After the Soviet Union took control of the region, speakers of these languages and their descendants migrated to mainland Japan and still exist in small numbers.\n\nThe Japanese society of Yamato people is linguistically homogeneous with small populations of Koreans (0.9 million), Chinese/Taiwanese (0.65 million), Filipino (306,000 some being Japanese Filipino; children of Japanese and Filipino parentage).[65] This can be also said for Brazilians (300,000, many of whom are ethnically Japanese) as well as Peruvians and Argentineans of both Latin American and Japanese descent.[*citation needed*] Japan has indigenous minority groups such as the Ainu and Ryukyuans, who generally speak Japanese.\n\n\n\n## Citizenship[edit]\n\n\nJapanese citizenship is conferred *jure sanguinis*, and monolingual Japanese-speaking minorities often reside in Japan for generations under permanent residency status without acquiring citizenship in their country of birth, although legally they are allowed to do so. This is because Japanese law does not recognise dual citizenship after the age of adulthood, and so people becoming naturalised Japanese citizens must relinquish their previous citizenship upon reaching the age of 20 years[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn addition, people taking Japanese citizenship must take a name using one or more of the Japanese character sets (hiragana, katakana, kanji). Names written in the Western alphabet, Korean alphabet, Arabic characters, etc., are not acceptable as legal names. Chinese characters are usually legally acceptable as nearly all Chinese characters are recognized as valid by the Japanese government. Transliterations of non-Japanese names using katakana (e.g. スミス　\"*Sumisu*\" for \"Smith\") are also legally acceptable.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHowever, some naturalizing foreigners feel that becoming a Japanese citizen should mean that they have a Japanese name and that they should abandon their foreign name, and some foreign residents do not wish to do this—although most Special Permanent Resident Koreans and Chinese already use Japanese names. Nonetheless, some 10,000 Zainichi Koreans naturalize every year. Approximately 98.6% of the population are Japanese citizens, and 99% of the population speak Japanese as their first language. Non-ethnic Japanese in the past, and to an extent in the present, also live in small numbers in the Japanese archipelago.[60]\n\n\n\n## Society[edit]\n\n\n### Lifestyle[edit]\n\n\nJapanese people enjoy a high standard of living, and nearly 90% of the population consider themselves part of the middle class.[11] However, many studies on happiness and satisfaction with life tend to find that Japanese people average relatively low levels of life satisfaction and happiness when compared with most of the highly developed world; the levels have remained consistent if not declining slightly over the last half century.[66][67][68][69] Japanese have been surveyed to be relatively lacking in financial satisfaction.[70] The societal view generally disapproves of out-of-wedlock births and premarital pregnancies.[71]\n\n\nSocial isolation is a problem for a segment of Japanese society, with almost 500,000 young people belonging to this group, they are also known as *hikikomori*.[72]\n\n\nThe Japanese management working culture in Japan has led some to work-related deaths due to heart attack or stroke, this has led to the term *karoshi* (lit. \"overwork death\")*.* The government has received 200 claims of karoshi related work injuries each year, with some leading to suicide.[73]\n\n\nMany Japanese lead a sexless marriage. Japan has the lowest level of couples having sex at 45 times per year, well below the global average of 103 times. With reasons of \"tired\" and \"bored with intercourse\" usually given as an answer.[74] Despite this, Japan ranks as number two globally on the amount spent on pornography, after South Korea.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### Marriages and divorce[edit]\n\n\n* Marriage and divorce statistics\n* ![Marriages in Japan over time](image)\n\nMarriages in Japan over time\n* ![Marriage rate per 1000 people in Japan](image)\n\nMarriage rate per 1000 people in Japan\n* ![Average age of first marriage in Japan](image)\n\nAverage age of first marriage in Japan\n* ![Number of divorces in Japan over time](image)\n\nNumber of divorces in Japan over time\n* ![Divorce rates per 1000 of total population](image)\n\nDivorce rates per 1000 of total population\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ethnic issues in Japan and Ethnic groups of Japan\n\nNaturalized Japanese citizens and native-born Japanese nationals with a multi-ethnic background are all considered to be Japanese in the population census of Japan.[59]\n\n\n\n### Discrimination against ethnic minorities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Burakumin\n\nThree native Japanese minority groups can be identified. The largest are the *hisabetsu buraku* or \"discriminated communities\", also known as the *burakumin*. These descendants of premodern outcast hereditary occupational groups, such as butchers, leatherworkers, funeral directors, and certain entertainers, may be considered a Japanese analog of India's Dalits. Discrimination against these occupational groups arose historically because of Buddhist prohibitions against killing and Shinto notions of pollution, as well as governmental attempts at social control.[11]\n\n\nDuring the Edo period, such people were required to live in special *buraku* and, like the rest of the population, were bound by sumptuary laws based on the inheritance of social class. The Meiji government abolished most derogatory names applied to these discriminated communities in 1871, but the new laws had little effect on the social discrimination faced by the former outcasts and their descendants. The laws, however, did eliminate the economic monopoly they had over certain occupations.[11] The *buraku* continued to be treated as social outcasts and some casual interactions with the majority caste were perceived taboo until the era after World War II.\n\n\nEstimates of their number range from 2 to 4 million (about 4% of the national population in 2022). Although members of these discriminated communities are physically indistinguishable from other Japanese, they often live in urban ghettoes or in the traditional special hamlets in rural areas, and membership can be surmised from the location of the family home, occupation, dialect, or mannerisms. Checks on family background designed to ferret out *buraku* were commonly performed as part of marriage arrangements and employment applications,[11] but have been illegal since 1985 in Osaka.\n\n\nPast and current discrimination has resulted in lower educational attainment and socioeconomic status among *hisabetsu buraku* than among the majority of Japanese. Movements with objectives ranging from \"liberation\" to encouraging integration have tried to change this situation,[11] with some success. Nadamoto Masahisa of the Buraku History Institute estimates that as of 1998, between 60 and 80% of burakumin marry a non-burakumin.[77]\n\n\n\n### Ryukyuans[edit]\n\n\nOne of the largest minority groups among Japanese citizens is the Ryukyuan people.[78] They are primarily distinguished by their use of several distinct Ryukyuan languages, though use of Ryukyuan is dying out.[79] The Ryukyuan people and language originated in the Ryukyu Islands, which are in Okinawa prefecture and Kagoshima Prefecture.\n\n\n\n### Ainu[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Japanese Ainu group in 1904\nThe third largest minority group among Japanese citizens is the Ainu, whose language is an isolate. Historically, the Ainu were an indigenous hunting and gathering population who occupied most of northern Honshū as late as the Nara period (A.D. 710–94). As Japanese settlement expanded, the Ainu were pushed northward,[11] by the Tokugawa shogunate, the Ainu were pushed into the island of Hokkaido.[80]\n\n\nCharacterized as remnants of a primitive circumpolar culture, the fewer than 20,000 Ainu in 1990 were considered racially distinct and thus not fully Japanese. Disease and a low birth rate had severely diminished their numbers over the past two centuries, and intermarriage had brought about an almost completely mixed population.[11]\n\n\nAlthough no longer in daily use, the Ainu language is preserved in epics, songs, and stories transmitted orally over succeeding generations. Distinctive rhythmic music and dances and some Ainu festivals and crafts are preserved, but mainly in order to take advantage of tourism.[11]\n\n\n\n### Hāfu[edit]\n\n\nHāfu (a kana rendition of \"half\") is a term used for people who are biracial and ethnically half Japanese. Of the one million children born in Japan in 2013, 2.2% had one or two non-Japanese parents.[70] According to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, one in forty-nine babies born in Japan today are born into families with one non-Japanese parent.[81] Most intermarriages in Japan are between Japanese men and women from other Asian countries, including China, the Philippines and South Korea.[82] Southeast Asia too, also has significant populations of people with half-Japanese ancestry, particularly in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.\n\n\nIn the 1940s, biracial Japanese children (Ainoko), specifically Amerasian children, encountered social problems such as poverty, perception of impurity and discrimination due to negative treatment in Japan.[83] In the 21st century, discrimination against hāfu occurs based on how different their identity, behavior and appearance is from a typical Japanese person.[84]\n\n\n\n## Foreign residents[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Transition of numbers of registered foreigners in Japan\n![](image)Age and sex distribution of major foreigners in Japan\nIn 2021, there were 2,887,116 foreign residents in Japan, representing 2.3% of the Japanese population.[85] Foreign Army personnel, of which there were up to 430,000 from the SCAP (post-occupation, United States Forces Japan) and 40,000 BCOF in the immediate post-war years, have not been at any time included in Japanese foreign resident statistics.[86] Most foreign residents in Japan come from Brazil or from other Asian countries, particularly from China, Vietnam, South Korea, the Philippines, and Nepal.[87][88]\n\n\nA number of long-term resident Koreans in Japan today retain familial links with the descendants of Koreans,[89] that either immigrated voluntarily or were forcibly relocated during the Japanese Occupation of the Korea. Within this group, a number hold Special Permanent Resident status, granted under the terms of the Normalisation Treaty (22. June 1965) between South Korea and Japan.[90] In many cases special residents, despite being born in Japan and speaking Japanese, have chosen not to take advantage of the mostly automatic granting of citizenship to special resident applicants.[91]\n\n\nBeginning in 1947 the Japanese government started to repatriate Korean nationals, who had nominally been granted Japanese citizenship during the years of military occupation. When the Treaty of San Francisco came into force many ethnic Koreans lost their Japanese citizenship from April 28, 1952, and with it the right to welfare grants, to hold a government job of any kind or to attend Japanese schools.[86] In the following year the government contrived, with the help of the Red Cross, a scheme to \"repatriate\" Korean residents, who mainly were from the Southern Provinces, to their \"home\" of North Korea.[92] Between 1959 and 1984 93,430 people used this route, of whom 6,737 were Japanese or Chinese dependents. Most of these departures – 78,276 – occurred before 1962.[93]\n\n\n\n![](image)Foreign-born population by citizenship in 2023[94]\nAll non-Japanese without special residential status (people whose residential roots go back to before WWII) are required by law to register with the government and carry alien registration cards. From the early 1980s, a civil disobedience movement encouraged refusal of the fingerprinting that accompanied registration every five years.[11]\n\n\nOpponents of fingerprinting argued that it was discriminatory because the only Japanese who were fingerprinted were criminals. The courts upheld fingerprinting, but the law was changed so that fingerprinting was done once rather than with each renewal of the registration,[11] which until a law reform in 1989 was usually required every six months for anybody from the age of 16. Those refusing fingerprinting were denied re-entry permits, thus depriving them of freedom of movement.\n\n\nOf these foreign residents below, the new wave started in 2014 comes to Japan as students or trainees. These foreigners are registered under student visa or trainee visa, which gives them the student residency status. Most of these new foreigners are under this visa. Almost all of these foreign students and trainees will return to their home country after three to four years (one valid period); few students extend their visa. Vietnamese makes the largest increase, however Burmese, Cambodians, Filipinos and Chinese are also increasing.\n\n\nAsian migrant wives of Japanese men have also contributed to the foreign-born population in the country. Many young single Japanese male farmers choose foreign wives, mainly from the Philippines, Thailand, China and South Korea, due to a lack of interest from Japanese women living a farming life.[95] Migrant wives often travel as mail-order brides as a result of arranged marriages with Japanese men.[96] Additionally, Japanese men in urban parts of the country have also begun marrying foreign Asian women.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country region groups | Number | Percentage of\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Foreigncitizens | Totalpopulation\n |\n| Desi/South Asians | 255,168 | 8.8% | 0.20%\n |\n| Southeast Asians | 1,304,765 | 45.2% | 1.0%\n |\n| Other East Asians | 1,301,610 | 45.1% | 1.0%\n |\n| Europeans/North Americans | 84,916 | 2.9% | 0.05%\n |\n| South Americans | 256,794 | 8.8% | 0.20%\n |\n| Others (African, West Asian, etc.) | 635,787 | 23.6% | 0.50%\n |\n| Total (as of 2022) | 2,887,116 | 100% | 2.3%\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This list may **require cleanup** to meet Wikipedia's quality standards.

increase of 110,358 foreign residents from 2014 to 2015. Vietnamese made the largest proportion of these new foreign residents, whilst Nepalese, Filipino, Chinese and Taiwanese are also significant in numbers. Together these countries makes up 91,126 or 82.6% of all new residents from 2014 to 2015. However, the majority of these immigrants will only remain in Japan for a maximum of five years, as many of them have entered the country in order to complete trainee programmes. Once they complete their programmes, they will be required to return to their home countries.[104]\n\n\nAs of December 2014 there were 2,121,831 foreigners residing in Japan, 677,019 of whom were long-term residents in Japan, according to national demographics figures. The majority of long-term residents were from Asia, totalling 478,953. Chinese made up the largest portion of them with 215,155, followed by Filipinos with 115,857, and Koreans with 65,711. Thai, Vietnamese, and Taiwanese long-term residents totaled 47,956, and those from other Asian countries totaled 34,274. The Korean figures do not include zainichi Koreans with *tokubetsu eijusha* (\"special permanent resident\") visas, of whom there were 354,503 (of a total of 358,409 of all nationalities with such visas). The total number of permanent residents had declined over the previous five years due to high cost of living.[98]\n\n\n\n### Foreign residents as of 2021[edit]\n\n\nThe number of foreign residents of Japan reached a high of 2.93 million in 2019 before falling to 2.76 million at the end of 2021.[105] The number of foreign workers was 1.46 million in 2018, 29.7% are in the manufacturing sector; 389,000 are from Vietnam and 316,000 are from China.[106]\n\n\n\nOn April 1, 2019, Japan's revised immigration law was enacted. The revision clarifies and better protects the rights of foreign workers. Japan formally accepts foreign blue-collar workers. This helps reduce labour shortage in certain sectors of the economy. The reform changes the status of foreign workers to regular employees and they can obtain permanent residence status. The reform includes a new visa status called *tokutei gino* (特定技能, *\"designated skills\"*). In order to qualify, applicants must pass a language and skills test (level N4 or higher of the Japanese-Language Proficiency Test). In the old \"Technical Trainee programme\" a foreign employee was tied to their employer. This caused numerous cases of exploitation. The revision gives foreign workers more freedom to leave and change their employer.[107]\n\n* Japanese nationality data mapped in prefectures in 2020\n* ![Japanese nationality (96.3% total)](image)\n\nJapanese nationality (96.3% total)\n* ![Foreign nationality (1.9% total)[t 1]](image)\n\nForeign nationality (1.9% total)[t 1]\n* ![No nationality stated (1.7% total)](image)\n\nNo nationality stated (1.7% total)\n\n\n1. **^** The proportion of foreign nationals is most likely higher due to those that did not declare a nationality. The Statistics of Foreign Residents estimated that there was a total of 2,887,116 (2.3% of the total population) foreign nationals in December 2020, while in the 2020 census carried out in October enumarated 2,402,460 foreign nationals.\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Japan\n\nSee also: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Japan\n\n![](image)Shinto wedding at the Meiji Shrine\nShinto and Buddhism are Japan's two major religions. They have co-existed for more than a thousand years. However, most Japanese people generally do not exclusively identify themselves as adherents of one religion, but rather incorporate various elements in a syncretic fashion.[108] There are small Christian and other minorities as well, with the Christian population dating to as early as the 1500s, as a result of European missionary work before sakoku was implemented from 1635 to 1853.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Demographic history of Japan before the Meiji Restoration\n* Demography of the Empire of Japan\n* Elderly people in Japan\n* Largest cities in Japan by population by decade\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Statistics Bureau Home Page/Population Estimates Monthly Report\". *www.stat.go.jp*.

In Japanese, it is referred to by various terms, one of the most common being **Capital Region** (首都圏, *Shuto-ken*).\n\n\nAs of 2016, the United Nations estimates the total population at 38,140,000.[4] It covers an area of approximately 13,500 km2 (5,200 mi2),[5] giving it a population density of 2,642 people/km2. It is the second largest single metropolitan area in the world in terms of built-up or urban function landmass at 8,547 km2 (3,300 mi2), behind only the New York City metropolitan area at 11,642 km2 (4,495 mi2).[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Definition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Growth of densely inhabited districts (*DIDs [ja], defined as >4,000 people/km2 or >10,355 people/mi2*) of suburb Saitama city (outlined) of northern Greater Tokyo, 1960s to 2010. Notice how the densely populated zones grow along railway lines and stations, the purple circles and lines. Green southern border is Tokyo.\nThere are various definitions of the Greater Tokyo Area, each of which tries to incorporate different aspects. Some definitions are clearly defined by law or government regulation, some are based coarsely on administrative areas, while others are for research purposes such as commuting patterns or distance from Central Tokyo. Each definition has a different population figure, granularity, methodology, and spatial association.\n\n\n\n### Various definitions of Tokyo, Greater Tokyo, and Kantō[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Inner Tokyo and Tokyo | Details | Population, thousands(year) | Area (km2) | Population density (people/km2) | Map\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Area of former (dissolved) Tokyo City limits** | 23 special wards, does not correspond to any single authority | 8,841 (1970CF),8,135 (2000CF),8,490 (2005CF),8,949 (2010CF),9,256 (2015-12CR) | 621.9 | 13,080 (2000) 14,390 (2010) 14,883 (2015–12) | ![](image) |\n| **Tokyo Metropolis** | Prefectural-level jurisdiction (Tokyo-to), figures excluding the Izu and Ogasawara islands | 12,038 (2000CF),12,541 (2005CF),13,129 (2010CF),13,479 (2015-12CR) | 1808 | 6,658(2000)6,936 (2005)7,216.5 (2010)7,455 (2015–12) | ![](image) |\n\n\n\n\n| Metropolitan area | Details | Population, thousands(year) | Area (km2) | Population density (people/km2) | Map\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Tokyo Metropolitan Employment Area (東京大都市雇用圏, *Tōkyō Dai-toshi Koyō-ken*)** | All municipalities that have at least 10% of their population commuting to the 23 special wards.

Before Saitama became a designated city in 2001, the area was called *Keihin'yō Major Metropolitan Area (京浜葉大都市圏, *Keihin'yō Dai-toshi-ken*)*.

Abbreviations: CF for National Census Final Data (every 5 years by JSB), CR for Civil Registry (compiled by local governments, monthly as per legal requirement), CP for Census Preliminary.\n\n\n\n### National Capital Region[edit]\n\n\nThe **National Capital Region** (首都圏, *Shutoken*) of Japan refers to the Greater Tokyo Area as defined by the National Capital Region Planning Act [ja] (首都圏整備法, *Shutoken-seibi-hō*) of 1956, which defines it as \"Tokyo and its surrounding area declared by government ordinance.\"[12][*failed verification*] The government ordinance defined it as Tokyo and all six prefectures in the Kantō region plus Yamanashi Prefecture. While this includes all of Greater Tokyo, it also includes sparsely populated mountain areas as well as the far-flung Bonin Islands which are administered under Tokyo.\n\n\n\n### International comparison[edit]\n\n\nUsing the \"One Metropolis Three Prefectures\" definition, Tokyo is 13,555.65 square kilometres (5,233.87 sq mi), a similar size to that of Los Angeles County, and almost two-thirds smaller than the combined statistical area of New York City, at 30,671 square kilometres (11,842 sq mi) and 21.9 million people.[*citation needed*] Other metropolitan areas such as Greater Jakarta are considerably more compact as well as more densely populated than Greater Tokyo.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan Area definition ambiguities and issues[edit]\n\n\n* The South Kantō region (南関東, *Minami Kantō*) is a potentially ambiguous term. Informally, it may mean the One Metropolis, Two Prefectures, or the area without Saitama Prefecture. Formally, it may mean the South Kantō Block, which is not the Greater Tokyo Area, but a proportional representation block of the national election, comprising Kanagawa, Chiba, and Yamanashi Prefectures.\n* In informal occasions, the term National Capital Region (首都圏, *Shuto-ken*) often means Greater Tokyo Area. Officially, the term refers to a much larger area, namely the whole Kantō region and Yamanashi Prefecture.\n* Tokyo as a metropolis includes some 394 km2  \n of islands (the Izu and Ogasawara islands), as well as some mountainous areas to the far west (331 km2  \n), which are officially part of Greater Tokyo, but are wilderness or rustic areas.\n\n\n## Cities[edit]\n\n\n(populations listed for those over 300,000)\n\n\n\n### Cities within Tokyo[edit]\n\n\nTokyo is legally classified as a *to* (都), which translates as \"metropolis\", and is treated as one of the forty-seven prefectures of Japan. The metropolis is administered by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government as a whole.\n\n\n\n![](image)Special wards of Tokyo\n![](image)Shibuya\n#### Eastern Tokyo Metropolis[edit]\n\n\nCentral Tokyo, situated in the eastern portion of Tokyo Metropolis, was once incorporated as Tokyo City, which was dismantled during World War II. Its subdivisions have been reclassified as special wards (特別区, *tokubetsu-ku*). The twenty three special wards currently have the legal status of cities, with individual mayors and city councils, and they call themselves \"cities\" in English. However, when listing Japan's largest cities, Tokyo's twenty three wards are often counted as a single city.\n\n\n\n#### Western Tokyo Metropolis[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hachiōji\nWestern Tokyo, known as the Tama Area (*Tama-chiiki* 多摩地域) comprises a number of municipalities, including these suburban cities:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Akiruno\n* Akishima\n* Chōfu\n* Fuchū\n* Fussa\n* Hachiōji (pop 540,000)\n* Hamura\n* Higashikurume\n* Higashimurayama\n | * Higashiyamato\n* Hino\n* Inagi\n* Kiyose\n* Kodaira\n* Koganei\n* Kokubunji\n* Komae\n* Kunitachi\n | * Machida (pop over 410,000)\n* Mitaka\n* Musashimurayama\n* Musashino\n* Nishitōkyō\n* Ōme\n* Tachikawa\n* Tama\n |\n\n\n### Cities outside Tokyo[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chiba\n![](image)Kawasaki\n![](image)Saitama\n![](image)Yokohama\n![](image)Kawaguchi\nThe core cities of the Greater Tokyo Area outside Tokyo Metropolis are:\n\n\n\n* Chiba (population 940,000)\n* Kawasaki (population 1.36 million)\n* Sagamihara (population 730,000)\n* Saitama (population 1.19 million)\n* Yokohama (population 3.62 million)\n\n\nThe other cities in Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama Prefectures are:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Abiko\n* Ageo\n* Asahi\n* Asaka\n* Atsugi\n* Ayase\n* Chichibu\n* Chigasaki\n* Chōshi\n* Ebina\n* Fujimi\n* Fujimino\n* Fujisawa (pop 416,000)\n* Fukaya\n* Funabashi (pop 580,000)\n* Futtsu\n* Gyōda\n* Hadano\n* Hannō\n* Hanyū\n* Hasuda\n* Hidaka\n* Higashimatsuyama\n* Hiratsuka\n* Honjō\n* Ichihara\n* Ichikawa (pop. 470,000)\n* Inzai\n* Iruma\n* Isehara\n | * Kamagaya\n* Kamakura\n* Kamogawa\n* Kashiwa (pop 380,000)\n* Kasukabe\n* Katsuura\n* Kawagoe (pop 330,000)\n* Kawaguchi (pop 500,000)\n* Kazo\n* Kimitsu\n* Kisarazu\n* Kitamoto\n* Koshigaya (population 318,000)\n* Kōnosu\n* Kuki\n* Kumagaya\n* Matsudo (pop 480,000)\n* Minamiashigara\n* Misato\n* Miura\n* Mobara\n* Nagareyama\n* Narashino\n* Narita\n* Niiza\n* Noda\n* Ōamishirasato\n* Odawara\n* Okegawa\n | * Sakado\n* Sakura\n* Satte\n* Sawara\n* Sayama\n* Shiki\n* Shiraoka\n* Shiroi\n* Sodegaura\n* Sōka\n* Tateyama\n* Toda\n* Tōgane\n* Tokorozawa (pop 338,000)\n* Tomisato\n* Tsurugashima\n* Urayasu\n* Wakō\n* Warabi\n* Yachimata\n* Yachiyo\n* Yamato\n* Yashio\n* Yōkaichiba\n* Yokosuka (pop 420,000)\n* Yoshikawa\n* Yotsukaidō\n* Zama\n* Zushi\n |\n\n\nsource: stat.go.jp census 2005\n\n\n\n### Additional cities[edit]\n\n\nIn the major metropolitan area (MMA) definition used by the Japanese Statistics Bureau, the following cities in Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Yamanashi, and Shizuoka Prefectures are included:\n\n\n\n#### Gunma Prefecture[edit]\n\n\n* Tatebayashi\n\n\n#### Ibaraki Prefecture[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Inashiki\n* Ishioka\n* Jōsō\n* Kasumigaura\n | * Koga\n* Moriya\n* Ryūgasaki\n* Toride\n | * Tsuchiura\n* Tsukuba\n* Tsukubamirai\n* Ushiku\n |\n\n\n#### Shizuoka Prefecture[edit]\n\n\n* Atami\n\n\n#### Tochigi Prefecture[edit]\n\n\n* Oyama\n\n\n#### Yamanashi Prefecture[edit]\n\n\n* Ōtsuki\n* Uenohara\n\n\n#### Border areas[edit]\n\n\nTighter definitions for Greater Tokyo do not include adjacent metropolitan areas of Numazu-Mishima (approx. 450,000) to the southwest, Maebashi-Takasaki-Ōta-Ashikaga (approx. 1,500,000 people) on the northwest, and Greater Utsunomiya [ja] (approx. 1,000,000) to the north. If they are included, Greater Tokyo's population would be around 39 million.Takasaki-Maebashi is included as part of the Tokyo-Yokohama area in the definition of urban areas by Demographia.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of Tokyo from Tokyo Skytree\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nAt the centre of the main urban area (approximately the first 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Tokyo Station) are the 23 special wards, formerly treated as a single city but now governed as separate municipalities, and containing many major commercial centres such as Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ikebukuro and Ginza. Around the 23 special wards are a multitude of suburban cities which merge seamlessly into each other to form a continuous built up area, circumnavigated by the heavily travelled Route 16 which forms a (broken) loop about 40 kilometres (25 mi) from central Tokyo. Situated along the loop are the major cities of Yokohama (to the south of Tokyo), Hachiōji (to the west), Ōmiya (now part of Saitama City, to the north), and Chiba (to the east).\n\n\nWithin the Route 16 loop, the coastline of Tokyo Bay is heavily industrialised, with the Keihin Industrial Area stretching from Tokyo down to Yokohama, and the Keiyō Industrial Zone from Tokyo eastwards to Chiba. Along the periphery of the main urban area are numerous new suburban housing developments such as the Tama New Town. The landscape is relatively flat compared to most of Japan, most of it comprising low hills.\n\n\nOutside the Route 16 loop the landscape becomes more rural. To the southwest is an area known as Shōnan, which contains various cities and towns along the coast of Sagami Bay, and to the west the area is mountainous.\n\n\nMany rivers run through the area, the major ones being Arakawa and Tama River.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population of South-Kanto Prefectures  \n(Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, Saitama)\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950 | 11,274,641 | —     |\n| 1955 | 13,712,679 | +3.99% |\n| 1960 | 16,678,821 | +3.99% |\n| 1965 | 20,284,371 | +3.99% |\n| 1970 | 23,297,503 | +2.81% |\n| 1975 | 26,614,733 | +2.70% |\n| 1980 | 28,548,512 | +1.41% |\n| 1985 | 30,303,794 | +1.20% |\n| 1990 | 32,530,003 | +1.43% |\n| 1995 | 33,586,573 | +0.64% |\n| 2000 | 34,449,908 | +0.51% |\n| 2005 | 35,621,544 | +0.67% |\n| 2010 | 36,859,626 | +0.69% |\n| 2015 | 37,256,109 | +0.21% |\n| 2020 | 37,393,128 | +0.07% |\n| 2021 | 37,251,006 | −0.38% |\n| for Tokyo Agglomeration (UN Definition):[13] |\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nTokyo metropolitan area has the second largest city economy in the world and is one of the major global centers of trade and commerce along with New York City and London.\n\n\n\n### Greater Tokyo Area 2020[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\n\n\n| Prefecture\n | Gross prefecture product(in billion JP¥)[2] | Gross prefecture product(in billion US$)[3] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Tokyo\n | 109,602\n | 1,027\n |\n| Kanagawa\n | 33,905\n | 318\n |\n| Saitama\n | 22,923\n | 215\n |\n| Chiba\n | 20,756\n | 194\n |\n| Ibaraki\n | 13,771\n | 129\n |\n| Tochigi\n | 8,946\n | 84\n |\n| Gunma\n | 8,653\n | 81\n |\n| Yamanashi\n | 4,284\n | 40\n |\n| **National Capital Region** | **222,129**\n | **2,084**\n |\n\n\n### Metropolitan Employment Area[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | 2010 | 1995 | 1980\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Employed persons 000s\n | 16,234 | 16,381 | 12,760\n |\n| Production (billion US$)\n | 1,797 | 1,491 | 358\n |\n| Production manufacturing (billion US$)\n | 216 | 476 | 159\n |\n| Private capital stock (billion US$)\n | 3,618 | 2,631 | 368\n |\n| Social overhead capital (billion US$)\n | 1,607 | 1,417 | 310\n |\n| 1 US dollar (Japanese yen)\n | 87.780 | 94.060 | 226.741\n |\n\n\nSources:[7] Conversion rates – Exchange rates – OECD Data\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Narita International Airport\n![](image)Yamanote Line; 3.61 million passengers ride per day.\n![](image)Shuto Expressway on Rainbow Bridge\nMain article: Transport in Greater Tokyo\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\nThe Greater Tokyo Area has two major airports, Tokyo International Airport, commonly known as Haneda Airport (once chiefly domestic, now turning international) and Narita International Airport (chiefly international as well). Minor facilities include Chōfu and Ibaraki Airport. Tokyo Heliport serves helicopter traffic, including police, fire, and news. Japan Civil Aviation Bureau handles air traffic in large part but various military facilities handle air traffic in part: Hyakuri Air Base (Japan Air Self-Defense Force), Utsunomiya Air Field (Japan Ground Self-Defense Force), and Yokota Air Base (United States Air Force).[14]\n\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\nGreater Tokyo has an extensive railway network comprising high-speed rail, commuter rails, subways, monorails, private lines, trams and others. There are around 136 individual rail lines in the Greater Tokyo Area, and between 1,000 and 1,200 railway stations depending on one's definition of the area, most designed for heavy use, usually long enough to accommodate 10-car (200 metres (660 ft) long) trains. Stations are designed to accommodate hundreds of thousands of passengers at any given time, with miles of connecting tunnels linking vast department stores and corporate offices. Tokyo Station has underground connections that stretch well over 4 kilometres (2.5 mi), and Shinjuku Station has well over 200 exits. Greater Tokyo's Railway Network is easily considered the world's largest in terms of both daily passenger throughput with a daily trips of over 40 million (20 million different passengers) as well as physical extent with approximately 2,578 kilometres (1,602 mi) of track. Shinjuku station is used by an average of 3.34 million people per day, making it the world's busiest train station. Some 57 percent of all Greater Tokyo residents used rail as their primary means of transport in 2001.[15]\n\n\nJR East and many other carriers crisscross the region with a network of rail lines. The most important carriers include Keihin Kyūkō Electric Railway (*Keikyū*), Keisei Electric Railway, Keiō Electric Railway, Odakyū Electric Railway, Seibu Railway, Tōbu Railway, and Tōkyū Corporation. In addition to Tokyo's two subway systems — Tokyo Metro and Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation (*Toei* and *Toden* lines), Yokohama also has two subway lines.\n\n\nThe Tokyo Monorail provides an important shuttle service between Haneda Airport and Hammatsucho station on the Yamanote line.\n\n\n\n### Others[edit]\n\n\nThe Shuto Expressway system connects to other national expressways in the capital region.\n\n\nTokyo and Yokohama are major commercial seaports, and both the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and United States Navy maintain naval bases at Yokosuka.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Tokyo portal\n\n\n* Jing-Jin-Ji\n* List of metropolitan areas in Asia\n* List of metropolitan areas in Japan\n* National Capital Region, briefly shows the two definitions of the \"Capital Area\" (Shuto-ken)\n* Seoul Capital Area\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Major Agglomerations of the World - Population Statistics and Maps\".\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"県民経済計算（平成23年度 - 令和２年度）（2008SNA、平成27年基準計数）＜47都道府県、4政令指定都市分＞\".\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"US Dollar to Japanese Yen Spot Exchange Rates for 2020\".\n4. **^** United Nations. *The World's Cities in 2016* (PDF).
