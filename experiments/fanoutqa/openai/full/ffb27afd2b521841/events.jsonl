Byzantine emperors Constantine VIII and Basil II, reigning for 66 years in total (962–1028) and for 65 years in total (960–1025) respectively, are not included, because for part of those periods they reigned only nominally as junior co-emperors alongside senior emperors.\n\n\nRegencies are not counted against monarchs, hence Louis XIV of France being listed first among the monarchs of sovereign states despite his mother Anne of Austria being his regent for 8 years. A distinction is not made between absolute and constitutional monarchy, hence Elizabeth II being listed second despite being a figurehead her entire reign.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Portrait\n | Name\n | State\n | Reign\n | Duration\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| From\n | To\n | (days)\n | (years, days)\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | Louis XIV | * ![](image) France\n* ![](image) Andorra\n | 14 May 1643 | 1 September 1715 | 26,407\n | 72 years, 110 days\n | [1] |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Elizabeth II | * ![](image) United Kingdom\n* ![](image) Canada\n* ![](image) Australia\n* ![](image) New Zealand\n[a] | 6 February 1952 | 8 September 2022 | 25,782\n | 70 years, 214 days[b] | [2][3][4] |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | Rama IX(Bhumibol Adulyadej) | ![](image) Thailand | 9 June 1946 | 13 October 2016 | 25,694\n | 70 years, 126 days\n | [5] |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | Johann II | ![](image) Liechtenstein | 12 November 1858 | 11 February 1929 | 25,658\n | 70 years, 91 days\n | [6] |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal I | Palenque (Mexico)\n | 27 July 615[c] | 29 August 683 | 24,870\n | 68 years, 33 days\n | [7][9] |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | Franz Joseph I | * ![](image) Austrian Empire (1848–1867)\n* Austria-Hungary (1867–1916)\n | 2 December 1848 | 21 November 1916 | 24,825\n | 67 years, 355 days\n | [10] |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | Chan Imix Kʼawiil | Copán (Honduras)\n | 5 February 628[d] | 15 June 695 | 24,602\n | 67 years, 130 days\n | [13][14] |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Ferdinand III | * ![](image) Sicily (1759–1816)\n* ![](image) Two Sicilies (1816–1825)\n | 6 October 1759 | 4 January 1825 | 23,831\n | 65 years, 90 days\n | [15] |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | Victoria | ![](image) United Kingdom | 20 June 1837 | 22 January 1901 | 23,226\n | 63 years, 216 days\n | [16] |\n| 10\n | ![](image) | James I | ![](image) Crown of Aragon | 12 September 1213 | 27 July 1276 | 22,964\n | 62 years, 319 days\n | [17] |\n| 11\n | ![](image) | Emperor Shōwa[e](Hirohito) | ![](image) Empire of Japan (1926–1947)![](image) Japan (1947–1989)\n | 25 December 1926 | 7 January 1989 | 22,659\n | 62 years, 13 days\n | [18] |\n| 12\n | ![](image) | Kangxi Emperor[f] | ![](image) Qing dynasty (China)\n | 5 February 1661 | 20 December 1722 | 22,597\n | 61 years, 318 days\n | [19] |\n| 13\n | ![](image) | Honoré III | ![](image) Monaco | 29 December 1731 | 13 January 1793 | 22,296\n | 61 years, 15 days\n | [20][21] |\n| 14\n | ![](image) | Itzamnaaj Bahlam III[g] | Yaxchilan (Mexico)\n | 20 October 681[h] | 15 June 742 | 22,153\n | 60 years, 238 days\n | [11] |\n| 15\n | ![](image) | Kʼakʼ Tiliw Chan Yopaat | Quiriguá (Guatemala)\n | 29 December 724[i] | 27 July 785 | 22,125\n | 60 years, 210 days\n | [22][23] |\n| 16\n | ![](image) | Qianlong Emperor[j] | ![](image) Qing dynasty (China)\n | 18 October 1735 | 9 February 1796[k] | 22,029\n | 60 years, 114 days\n | [24] |\n| 17\n | ![](image) | Christian IV | ![](image) Denmark–Norway | 4 April 1588 | 28 February 1648 | 21,879\n | 59 years, 330 days\n | [25] |\n| 18\n | ![](image) | George III | * ![](image) Great Britain (1760–1800)\n* ![](image) Ireland (1760–1800)\n* ![](image) United Kingdom[l] (1801–1820)\n | 25 October 1760 | 29 January 1820 | 21,644\n | 59 years, 96 days\n | [26] |\n| 19\n | ![](image) | Louis XV | * ![](image) France\n* ![](image) Andorra\n | 1 September 1715 | 10 May 1774 | 21,436\n | 58 years, 251 days\n | [27] |\n| 20\n | ![](image) | Pedro II | ![](image) Brazil | 7 April 1831 | 15 November 1889 | 21,407\n | 58 years, 222 days\n | [28] |\n| 21\n | ![](image) | Al-Mustansir Billah | Fatimid Caliphate (Egypt)\n | 13 June 1036[m] | 29 December 1094 | 21,383\n | 58 years, 199 days\n | [29][30] |\n| 22\n | ![](image) | Nicholas I | * ![](image) Principality of Montenegro(1860–1910)\n* ![](image) Kingdom of Montenegro(1910–1918)\n | 13 August 1860 | 26 November 1918 | 21,288\n | 58 years, 105 days\n | [33] |\n| 23\n | ![](image) | Wilhelmina | ![](image) Netherlands | 23 November 1890 | 4 September 1948 | 21,104\n | 57 years, 286 days\n | [34] |\n| 24\n | ![](image) | James VI | ![](image) Scotland [n] | 24 July 1567 | 27 March 1625 | 21,066\n | 57 years, 246 days\n | [35] |\n| 25\n | ![](image) | Conrad I | ![](image) Burgundy | 11 July 937[o] | 19 October 993 | 20,554\n | 56 years, 100 days\n | [36] |\n\n\n## Monarchs of dependent or constituent states with verifiable reigns by exact date[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Within each year-grouping, they appear in historical order. In a given year, there may have been a wide array of actual reign lengths based on days. Thus, this table does not present a precise ranking by length of reign. The list is limited to those that might reasonably be expected to lie within the range of those in the tables above, at minimum 56 years. The list is sorted alphabetically. ***Emphasised*** states were sovereign. Japanese legendary emperors, according to the ancient Japanese calendar, reigned for very long terms of 60–70 years each. The longest ruler of the legendary emperors, Emperor Kōan, was claimed to have reigned for about 101 years. These figures are not included in the table because they are regarded as inaccurate by modern scholars. For those, see Longevity myths.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name\n | Country\n | Reign\n | Duration(approx. years)\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| from\n | to\n |\n|  | Min Hti[72]

Others point, however, to the consistency between the existing historical sources all crediting Pepi with over 90 years of reign. Finally, the lack of evidence beyond his 62nd year does not preclude a much longer reign, especially in view of the decay of the Egyptian state into the chaos of the First Intermediate Period at the end of Pepi's reign.\n38. **^** A dispute exists concerning when Taejo's reign ended. Lower estimates suggest 121–145 and higher ones up to 167 but the most widely believed one is 146 since Korean historians claim that he died in that year.\n39. **^** 121 CE is another possible accepted date of Taejo's end reign\n40. **^** While the chronology of his reign is disputed, his existence is generally accepted by most historians.\n41. **^** Chronology Disputed.\n42. **^** Some sources just give 80 years of lifespan not reign and Chronology disputed\n43. **^** Other sources put his start date as 679 or 688.\n44. **^** Some sources just give 79 Years of Lifespan not Reign.\n45. **^** During his lifetime, Otto I had many co-monarchs, including his father Rudolph IV, who made him ruler in 1308; he also ruled with his brother Henry IV until he died in 1318, as well as his brother Rudolph VI, who died in 1352.\n46. **^** In Co-Reign with his Mother until 1128\n47. **^** Shapur II was crowned *in utero*: the crown was placed upon his mother's belly. This child, named Shapur, was therefore born king; the government was conducted by his mother and the magnates.\n48. **^** Dominated by Nepal until 1816 and then by the British.\n49. **^** Robert I was in co-rule with his step-brother Edward II until 1352\n50. **^** Historians debate whether he was a Chinese or Vietnamese ruler (named Triệu Vũ Đế))\n51. **^** Sometimes her aunt Anne de La Tour d'Auvergne's death is given as June 1524 or 16 June 1524 (see for example her French wikipedia article), though sources seem to be laking for such specific dates and so she remains here.

She was queen regnant of 32 sovereign states over the course of her lifetime and remained the monarch of 15 realms by the time of her death. Her reign of over 70 years is the longest of any British monarch and the longest verified reign of any female head of state in history.\n\n\nElizabeth was born in Mayfair, London, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, King George V. She was the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his brother Edward VIII, making the ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021. They had four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.\n\n\nWhen her father died in February 1952, Elizabeth—then 25 years old—became queen of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (known today as Sri Lanka), as well as head of the Commonwealth. Elizabeth reigned as a constitutional monarch through major political changes such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland, devolution in the United Kingdom, the decolonisation of Africa, and the United Kingdom's accession to the European Communities and withdrawal from the European Union. The number of her realms varied over time as territories gained independence and some realms became republics. As queen, Elizabeth was served by more than 170 prime ministers across her realms. Her many historic visits and meetings included state visits to China in 1986, to Russia in 1994, and to the Republic of Ireland in 2011, and meetings with five popes and fourteen US presidents.\n\n\nSignificant events included Elizabeth's coronation in 1953 and the celebrations of her Silver, Golden, Diamond, and Platinum jubilees in 1977, 2002, 2012, and 2022, respectively. Although she faced occasional republican sentiment and media criticism of her family—particularly after the breakdowns of her children's marriages, her *annus horribilis* in 1992, and the death in 1997 of her former daughter-in-law Diana—support for the monarchy in the United Kingdom remained consistently high throughout her lifetime, as did her personal popularity. Elizabeth died aged 96 at Balmoral Castle in September 2022, and was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nElizabeth was born on 21 April 1926, the first child of Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father was the second son of King George V and Queen Mary, and her mother was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. She was delivered at 02:40 (GMT)[1] by Caesarean section at her maternal grandfather's London home, 17 Bruton Street in Mayfair.[2] The Anglican Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, baptised her in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 29 May,[3][b] and she was named Elizabeth after her mother; Alexandra after her paternal great-grandmother, who had died six months earlier; and Mary after her paternal grandmother.[5] She was called \"Lilibet\" by her close family,[6] based on what she called herself at first.[7] She was cherished by her grandfather George V, whom she affectionately called \"Grandpa England\",[8] and her regular visits during his serious illness in 1929 were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery.[9]\n\n\n\n![Elizabeth as a thoughtful-looking toddler with curly, fair hair](image)\nOn the cover of *Time*, April 1929\n![Elizabeth as a rosy-cheeked young girl with blue eyes and fair hair](image)\nPortrait by Philip de László, 1933\n\nElizabeth's only sibling, Princess Margaret, was born in 1930. The two princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and their governess, Marion Crawford.[10] Lessons concentrated on history, language, literature, and music.[11] Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled *The Little Princesses* in 1950, much to the dismay of the royal family.[12] The book describes Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her orderliness, and her attitude of responsibility.[13] Others echoed such observations: Winston Churchill described Elizabeth when she was two as \"a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant.\"[14] Her cousin Margaret Rhodes described her as \"a jolly little girl, but fundamentally sensible and well-behaved\".[15] Elizabeth's early life was spent primarily at the Yorks' residences at 145 Piccadilly (their town house in London) and Royal Lodge in Windsor.[16]\n\n\n\n## Heir presumptive[edit]\n\n\nDuring her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth was third in the line of succession to the British throne, behind her uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, and her father. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as Edward was still young and likely to marry and have children of his own, who would precede Elizabeth in the line of succession.[17] When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second in line to the throne, after her father. Later that year, Edward abdicated, after his proposed marriage to divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis.[18] Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, taking the regnal name George VI. Since Elizabeth had no brothers, she became heir presumptive. If her parents had subsequently had a son, he would have been heir apparent and above her in the line of succession, which was determined by the male-preference primogeniture in effect at the time.[19]\n\n\nElizabeth received private tuition in constitutional history from Henry Marten, Vice-Provost of Eton College,[20] and learned French from a succession of native-speaking governesses.[21] A Girl Guides company, the 1st Buckingham Palace Company, was formed specifically so she could socialise with girls her age.[22] Later, she was enrolled as a Sea Ranger.[21]\n\n\nIn 1939, Elizabeth's parents toured Canada and the United States. As in 1927, when they had toured Australia and New Zealand, Elizabeth remained in Britain since her father thought she was too young to undertake public tours.[23] She \"looked tearful\" as her parents departed.[24] They corresponded regularly,[24] and she and her parents made the first royal transatlantic telephone call on 18 May.[23]\n\n\n\n### Second World War[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In Auxiliary Territorial Service uniform, April 1945\nIn September 1939, Britain entered the Second World War. Lord Hailsham suggested that Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret should be evacuated to Canada to avoid the frequent aerial bombings of London by the *Luftwaffe*.[25] This was rejected by their mother, who declared, \"The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave.\"[26] The princesses stayed at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to Sandringham House, Norfolk.[27] From February to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge, Windsor, until moving to Windsor Castle, where they lived for most of the next five years.[28] At Windsor, the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments.[29] In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's *Children's Hour*, addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities.[30] She stated: \"We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers, and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our own share of the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well.\"[30]\n\n\nIn 1943, Elizabeth undertook her first solo public appearance on a visit to the Grenadier Guards, of which she had been appointed colonel the previous year.[31] As she approached her 18th birthday, Parliament changed the law so that she could act as one of five counsellors of state in the event of her father's incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944.[32] In February 1945, she was appointed an honorary second subaltern in the Auxiliary Territorial Service with the service number 230873.[33] She trained as a driver and mechanic and was given the rank of honorary junior commander (female equivalent of captain at the time) five months later.[34]\n\n\n\n![](image)Elizabeth (far left) on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family and Winston Churchill, 8 May 1945\nAt the end of the war in Europe, on Victory in Europe Day, Elizabeth and Margaret mingled incognito with the celebrating crowds in the streets of London. Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, \"We asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised ... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief.\"[35]\n\n\nDuring the war, plans were drawn to quell Welsh nationalism by affiliating Elizabeth more closely with Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for several reasons, including fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd at a time when Britain was at war.[36] Welsh politicians suggested she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent.[37] In 1946, she was inducted into the Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.[38]\n\n\nElizabeth went on her first overseas tour in 1947, accompanying her parents through southern Africa. During the tour, in a broadcast to the British Commonwealth on her 21st birthday, she made the following pledge: \n\n\n\n\n> I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong. But I shall not have strength to carry out this resolution alone unless you join in it with me, as I now invite you to do: I know that your support will be unfailingly given. God help me to make good my vow, and God bless all of you who are willing to share in it.[39][c]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Marriage[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten\n\nElizabeth met her future husband, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, in 1934 and again in 1937.[41] They were second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark and third cousins through Queen Victoria. After meeting for the third time at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth in July 1939, Elizabeth—though only 13 years old—said she fell in love with Philip, who was 18, and they began to exchange letters.[42] She was 21 when their engagement was officially announced on 9 July 1947.[43]\n\n\nThe engagement attracted some controversy. Philip had no financial standing, was foreign-born (though a British subject who had served in the Royal Navy throughout the Second World War), and had sisters who had married German noblemen with Nazi links.[44] Marion Crawford wrote, \"Some of the King's advisors did not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip's foreign origin.\"[45] Later biographies reported that Elizabeth's mother had reservations about the union initially and teased Philip as \"the Hun\".[46] In later life, however, she told the biographer Tim Heald that Philip was \"an English gentleman\".[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)At Buckingham Palace with Philip after their wedding, 1947\nBefore the marriage, Philip renounced his Greek and Danish titles, officially converted from Greek Orthodoxy to Anglicanism, and adopted the style *Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten*, taking the surname of his mother's British family.[48] Shortly before the wedding, he was created Duke of Edinburgh and granted the style *His Royal Highness*.[49] Elizabeth and Philip were married on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey. They received 2,500 wedding gifts from around the world.[50] Elizabeth required ration coupons to buy the material for her gown (which was designed by Norman Hartnell) because Britain had not yet completely recovered from the devastation of the war.[51] In post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for Philip's German relations, including his three surviving sisters, to be invited to the wedding.[52] Neither was an invitation extended to the Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII.[53]\n\n\nElizabeth gave birth to her first child, Prince Charles, in November 1948. One month earlier, the King had issued letters patent allowing her children to use the style and title of a royal prince or princess, to which they otherwise would not have been entitled as their father was no longer a royal prince.[54] A second child, Princess Anne, was born in August 1950.[55]\n\n\nFollowing their wedding, the couple leased Windlesham Moor, near Windsor Castle, until July 1949,[50] when they took up residence at Clarence House in London. At various times between 1949 and 1951, Philip was stationed in the British Crown Colony of Malta as a serving Royal Navy officer. He and Elizabeth lived intermittently in Malta for several months at a time in the hamlet of Gwardamanġa, at Villa Guardamangia, the rented home of Philip's uncle Lord Mountbatten. Their two children remained in Britain.[56]\n\n\n\n## Reign[edit]\n\n\n### Accession and coronation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Coronation of Elizabeth II\n\n![Elizabeth is seated and holds an orb and sceptre.](image)Coronation portrait by Cecil Beaton, 1953\nAs George VI's health declined during 1951, Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events. When she visited Canada and Harry S. Truman in Washington, DC, in October 1951, her private secretary Martin Charteris carried a draft accession declaration in case the King died while she was on tour.[57] In early 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand by way of the British colony of Kenya. On 6 February, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, Sagana Lodge, after a night spent at Treetops Hotel, when word arrived of the death of Elizabeth's father. Philip broke the news to the new queen.[58] She chose to retain Elizabeth as her regnal name,[59] and was therefore called Elizabeth II. The numeral offended some Scots, as she was the first Elizabeth to rule in Scotland.[60] She was proclaimed queen throughout her realms, and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom.[61] Elizabeth and Philip moved into Buckingham Palace.[62]\n\n\nWith Elizabeth's accession, it seemed possible that the royal house would take her husband's name, in line with the custom for married women of the time. Lord Mountbatten advocated for *House of Mountbatten*, and Philip suggested *House of Edinburgh*, after his ducal title.[63] The British prime minister, Winston Churchill, and Elizabeth's grandmother Queen Mary favoured the retention of the House of Windsor. Elizabeth issued a declaration on 9 April 1952 that the royal house would continue to be *Windsor*. Philip complained, \"I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.\"[64] In 1960, the surname *Mountbatten-Windsor* was adopted for Philip and Elizabeth's male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles.[65][66]\n\n\nAmid preparations for the coronation, Princess Margaret told her sister she wished to marry Peter Townsend, a divorcé 16 years Margaret's senior with two sons from his previous marriage. Elizabeth asked them to wait for a year; in the words of her private secretary, \"the Queen was naturally sympathetic towards the Princess, but I think she thought—she hoped—given time, the affair would peter out.\"[67] Senior politicians were against the match and the Church of England did not permit remarriage after divorce. If Margaret had contracted a civil marriage, she would have been expected to renounce her right of succession.[68] Margaret decided to abandon her plans with Townsend.[69] In 1960, she married Antony Armstrong-Jones, who was created Earl of Snowdon the following year. They divorced in 1978; she did not remarry.[70]\n\n\nDespite the death of Queen Mary on 24 March 1953, the coronation went ahead as planned on 2 June, as Mary had requested.[71] The coronation ceremony in Westminster Abbey was televised for the first time, with the exception of the anointing and communion.[72][d] On Elizabeth's instruction, her coronation gown was embroidered with the floral emblems of Commonwealth countries.[76]\n\n\n\n### Early reign[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Commonwealth realm § From the accession of Elizabeth II\n\n![](image)Elizabeth's realms (light red and pink) and their territories and protectorates (dark red) at the beginning of her reign in 1952\nFrom Elizabeth's birth onwards, the British Empire continued its transformation into the Commonwealth of Nations.[77] By the time of her accession in 1952, her role as head of multiple independent states was already established.[78] In 1953, Elizabeth and her husband embarked on a seven-month round-the-world tour, visiting 13 countries and covering more than 40,000 miles (64,000 km) by land, sea and air.[79] She became the first reigning monarch of Australia and New Zealand to visit those nations.[80] During the tour, crowds were immense; three-quarters of the population of Australia were estimated to have seen her.[81] Throughout her reign, Elizabeth made hundreds of state visits to other countries and tours of the Commonwealth; she was the most widely travelled head of state.[82]\n\n\nIn 1956, the British and French prime ministers, Sir Anthony Eden and Guy Mollet, discussed the possibility of France joining the Commonwealth. The proposal was never accepted, and the following year France signed the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community, the precursor to the European Union.[83] In November 1956, Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal. Lord Mountbatten said Elizabeth was opposed to the invasion, though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.[84]\n\n\n\n![A formal group of Elizabeth in tiara and evening dress with eleven politicians in evening dress or national costume](image)With Commonwealth leaders at the 1960 Commonwealth Conference\nThe governing Conservative Party had no formal mechanism for choosing a leader, meaning that it fell to Elizabeth to decide whom to commission to form a government following Eden's resignation. Eden recommended she consult Lord Salisbury, the lord president of the council. Lord Salisbury and Lord Kilmuir, the lord chancellor, consulted the British Cabinet, Churchill, and the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, resulting in Elizabeth appointing their recommended candidate: Harold Macmillan.[85]\n\n\nThe Suez crisis and the choice of Eden's successor led, in 1957, to the first major personal criticism of Elizabeth. In a magazine, which he owned and edited,[86] Lord Altrincham accused her of being \"out of touch\".[87] Altrincham was denounced by public figures and slapped by a member of the public appalled by his comments.[88] Six years later, in 1963, Macmillan resigned and advised Elizabeth to appoint Alec Douglas-Home as the prime minister, advice she followed.[89] Elizabeth again came under criticism for appointing the prime minister on the advice of a small number of ministers or a single minister.[89] In 1965, the Conservatives adopted a formal mechanism for electing a leader, thus relieving the Queen of her involvement.[90]\n\n\n\n![](image)Seated with Philip on thrones at the Canadian parliament, 1957\nIn 1957, Elizabeth made a state visit to the United States, where she addressed the United Nations General Assembly on behalf of the Commonwealth. On the same tour, she opened the 23rd Canadian Parliament, becoming the first monarch of Canada to open a parliamentary session.[91] Two years later, solely in her capacity as Queen of Canada, she revisited the United States and toured Canada.[91][92] In 1961, she toured Cyprus, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Iran.[93] On a visit to Ghana the same year, she dismissed fears for her safety, even though her host, President Kwame Nkrumah, who had replaced her as head of state, was a target for assassins.[94] Harold Macmillan wrote, \"The Queen has been absolutely determined all through ... She is impatient of the attitude towards her to treat her as ... a film star ... She has indeed 'the heart and stomach of a man' ... She loves her duty and means to be a Queen.\"[94] Before her tour through parts of Quebec in 1964, the press reported extremists within the Quebec separatist movement were plotting Elizabeth's assassination.[95] No attempt was made, but a riot did break out while she was in Montreal; Elizabeth's \"calmness and courage in the face of the violence\" was noted.[96]\n\n\nElizabeth gave birth to her third child, Prince Andrew, in February 1960, which was the first birth to a reigning British monarch since 1857.[97] Her fourth child, Prince Edward, was born in March 1964.[98]\n\n\n\n### Political reforms and crises[edit]\n\n\n![Elizabeth waving from a car](image)\nIn Queensland, Australia, 1970\n![](image)\nWith President Tito of Yugoslavia in Belgrade, 1972\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw an acceleration in the decolonisation of Africa and the Caribbean. More than 20 countries gained independence from Britain as part of a planned transition to self-government. In 1965, however, the Rhodesian prime minister, Ian Smith, in opposition to moves towards majority rule, unilaterally declared independence while expressing \"loyalty and devotion\" to Elizabeth, declaring her \"Queen of Rhodesia\".[99] Although Elizabeth formally dismissed him, and the international community applied sanctions against Rhodesia, his regime survived for over a decade.[100] As Britain's ties to its former empire weakened, the British government sought entry to the European Community, a goal it achieved in 1973.[101]\n\n\nIn 1966, the Queen was criticised for waiting eight days before visiting the village of Aberfan, where a mining disaster claimed the lives of 116 children and 28 adults. Charteris said that the delay, made on his advice, was a mistake that she later regretted.[102][103]\n\n\nElizabeth toured Yugoslavia in October 1972, becoming the first British monarch to visit a communist country.[104] She was received at the airport by President Josip Broz Tito, and a crowd of thousands greeted her in Belgrade.[105]\n\n\nIn February 1974, the British prime minister Edward Heath advised Elizabeth to call a general election in the middle of her tour of the Austronesian Pacific Rim, requiring her to fly back to Britain.[106] The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the Liberals. When discussions on forming a coalition foundered, Heath resigned, and Elizabeth asked the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Harold Wilson, to form a government.[107]\n\n\nA year later, at the height of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, the Australian prime minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, after the Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlam's budget proposals.[108] As Whitlam had a majority in the House of Representatives, Speaker Gordon Scholes appealed to Elizabeth to reverse Kerr's decision. She declined, saying she would not interfere in decisions reserved by the Constitution of Australia for the governor-general.[109] The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism.[108]\n\n\n\n![](image)Leaders of the G7 states, members of the royal family and Elizabeth (centre), London, 1977\nIn 1977, Elizabeth marked the Silver Jubilee of her accession. Parties and events took place throughout the Commonwealth, many coinciding with her associated national and Commonwealth tours. The celebrations re-affirmed Elizabeth's popularity, despite virtually coincident negative press coverage of Princess Margaret's separation from her husband, Lord Snowdon.[110] In 1978, Elizabeth endured a state visit to the United Kingdom by Romania's communist leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu, and his wife, Elena,[111] though privately she thought they had \"blood on their hands\".[112] The following year brought two blows: one was the unmasking of Anthony Blunt, former Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, as a communist spy; the other was the assassination of her uncle-in-law Lord Mountbatten by the Provisional Irish Republican Army.[113]\n\n\nAccording to Paul Martin Sr., by the end of the 1970s, Elizabeth was worried the Crown \"had little meaning for\" Pierre Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister.[114] Tony Benn said Elizabeth found Trudeau \"rather disappointing\".[114] Trudeau's supposed republicanism seemed to be confirmed by his antics, such as sliding down banisters at Buckingham Palace and pirouetting behind Elizabeth's back in 1977, and the removal of various Canadian royal symbols during his term of office.[114] In 1980, Canadian politicians sent to London to discuss the patriation of the Canadian constitution found Elizabeth \"better informed ... than any of the British politicians or bureaucrats\".[114] She was particularly interested after the failure of Bill C-60, which would have affected her role as head of state.[114]\n\n\n\n### Perils and dissent[edit]\n\n\n![Elizabeth in red uniform on a black horse](image)Riding Burmese at the 1986 Trooping the Colour ceremony\nDuring the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony, six weeks before the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, six shots were fired at Elizabeth from close range as she rode down The Mall, London, on her horse, Burmese. Police later discovered the shots were blanks. The 17-year-old assailant, Marcus Sarjeant, was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three.[115] Elizabeth's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised.[116] That October, Elizabeth was the subject of another attack while on a visit to Dunedin, New Zealand. Christopher John Lewis, who was 17 years old, fired a shot with a .22 rifle from the fifth floor of a building overlooking the parade but missed.[117] Lewis was arrested, but instead of being charged with attempted murder or treason was sentenced to three years in jail for unlawful possession and discharge of a firearm. Two years into his sentence, he attempted to escape a psychiatric hospital with the intention of assassinating Charles, who was visiting the country with Diana and their son Prince William.[118]\n\n\n\n![Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan on black horses. He bare-headed; she in a headscarf; both in tweeds, jodhpurs and riding boots.](image)Riding at Windsor with President Reagan, June 1982\nFrom April to September 1982, Elizabeth's son Andrew served with British forces in the Falklands War, for which she reportedly felt anxiety[119] and pride.[120] On 9 July, she awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder, Michael Fagan, in the room with her. In a serious lapse of security, assistance only arrived after two calls to the Palace police switchboard.[121] After hosting US president Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visiting his California ranch in 1983, Elizabeth was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada, one of her Caribbean realms, without informing her.[122]\n\n\nIntense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, pioneered by *The Sun* tabloid.[123] As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of *The Sun*, told his staff: \"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true—so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\"[124] Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in *The Observer* of 21 September 1986: \"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\" It was reported, most notably in *The Sunday Times* of 20 July 1986, that Elizabeth was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth secretary-general Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation.[125] Thatcher reputedly said Elizabeth would vote for the Social Democratic Party—Thatcher's political opponents.[126] Thatcher's biographer, John Campbell, claimed \"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making\".[127] Reports of acrimony between them were exaggerated,[128] and Elizabeth gave two honours in her personal gift—membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter—to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major.[129] Brian Mulroney, Canadian prime minister between 1984 and 1993, said Elizabeth was a \"behind the scenes force\" in ending apartheid.[130][131]\n\n\n\nFile:Christmas Card issued by H.R.H. Queen Elizabeth II (1987) (52344711248).jpgWith Philip and their four eldest grandchildren, 1987\nIn 1986, Elizabeth paid a six-day state visit to the People's Republic of China, becoming the first British monarch to visit the country.[132] The tour included the Forbidden City, the Great Wall of China, and the Terracotta Warriors.[133] At a state banquet, Elizabeth joked about the first British emissary to China being lost at sea with Queen Elizabeth I's letter to the Wanli Emperor, and remarked, \"fortunately postal services have improved since 1602\".[134] Elizabeth's visit also signified the acceptance of both countries that sovereignty over Hong Kong would be transferred from the United Kingdom to China in 1997.[135]\n\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, Elizabeth had become the target of satire.[136] The involvement of younger members of the royal family in the charity game show *It's a Royal Knockout* in 1987 was ridiculed.[137] In Canada, Elizabeth publicly supported politically divisive constitutional amendments, prompting criticism from opponents of the proposed changes, including Pierre Trudeau.[130] The same year, the elected Fijian government was deposed in a military coup. As monarch of Fiji, Elizabeth supported the attempts of Governor-General Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau to assert executive power and negotiate a settlement. Coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka deposed Ganilau and declared Fiji a republic.[138]\n\n\n\n### Turbulent years[edit]\n\n\nIn the wake of coalition victory in the Gulf War, Elizabeth became the first British monarch to address a joint meeting of the United States Congress in May 1991.[139]\n\n\n\n![Elizabeth, in formal dress, holds a pair of spectacles to her mouth in a thoughtful pose](image)With Philip in Germany, October 1992\nOn 24 November 1992, in a speech to mark the Ruby Jubilee of her accession to the throne, Elizabeth called 1992 her *annus horribilis* (a Latin phrase, meaning \"horrible year\").[140] Republican feeling in Britain had risen because of press estimates of Elizabeth's private wealth—contradicted by the Palace[e]—and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family.[145] In March, her second son, Prince Andrew, separated from his wife, Sarah; her daughter, Princess Anne, divorced Captain Mark Phillips in April;[146] angry demonstrators in Dresden threw eggs at Elizabeth during a state visit to Germany in October;[147] and a large fire broke out at Windsor Castle, one of her official residences, in November. The monarchy came under increased criticism and public scrutiny.[148] In an unusually personal speech, Elizabeth said that any institution must expect criticism, but suggested it might be done with \"a touch of humour, gentleness and understanding\".[149] Two days later, John Major announced plans to reform the royal finances, drawn up the previous year, including Elizabeth paying income tax from 1993 onwards, and a reduction in the civil list.[150] In December, Prince Charles and his wife, Diana, formally separated.[151] At the end of the year, Elizabeth sued *The Sun* newspaper for breach of copyright when it published the text of her annual Christmas message two days before it was broadcast. The newspaper was forced to pay her legal fees and donated £200,000 to charity.[152] Elizabeth's solicitors had taken successful action against *The Sun* five years earlier for breach of copyright after it published a photograph of her daughter-in-law the Duchess of York and her granddaughter Princess Beatrice.[153]\n\n\nIn January 1994, Elizabeth broke the scaphoid bone in her left wrist as the horse she was riding at Sandringham tripped and fell.[154] In October 1994, she became the first reigning British monarch to set foot on Russian soil.[f] In October 1995, Elizabeth was tricked into a hoax call by Montreal radio host Pierre Brassard impersonating Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien. Elizabeth, who believed that she was speaking to Chrétien, said she supported Canadian unity and would try to influence Quebec's referendum on proposals to break away from Canada.[159]\n\n\nIn the year that followed, public revelations on the state of Charles and Diana's marriage continued.[160] In consultation with her husband and John Major, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury (George Carey) and her private secretary (Robert Fellowes), Elizabeth wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, suggesting that a divorce would be advisable.[161]\n\n\nIn August 1997, a year after the divorce, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris. Elizabeth was on holiday with her extended family at Balmoral. Diana's two sons, Princes William and Harry, wanted to attend church, so Elizabeth and Philip took them that morning.[162] Afterwards, for five days, the royal couple shielded their grandsons from the intense press interest by keeping them at Balmoral where they could grieve in private,[163] but the royal family's silence and seclusion, and the failure to fly a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace, caused public dismay.[131][164] Pressured by the hostile reaction, Elizabeth agreed to return to London and address the nation in a live television broadcast on 5 September, the day before Diana's funeral.[165] In the broadcast, she expressed admiration for Diana and her feelings \"as a grandmother\" for the two princes.[166] As a result, much of the public hostility evaporated.[166]\n\n\nIn October 1997, Elizabeth and Philip made a state visit to India, which included a controversial visit to the site of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre to pay her respects. Protesters chanted \"Killer Queen, go back\",[167] and there were demands for her to apologise for the action of British troops 78 years earlier.[168] At the memorial in the park, she and Philip laid a wreath and stood for a 30‑second moment of silence.[168] As a result, much of the fury among the public softened, and the protests were called off.[167] That November, Elizabeth and her husband held a reception at Banqueting House to mark their golden wedding anniversary.[169] Elizabeth made a speech and praised Philip for his role as a consort, referring to him as \"my strength and stay\".[169]\n\n\nIn 1999, as part of the process of devolution within the UK, Elizabeth formally opened newly established legislatures for Wales and Scotland: the National Assembly for Wales at Cardiff in May,[170] and the Scottish Parliament at Edinburgh in July.[171]\n\n\n\n### Dawn of the new millennium[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Golden Jubilee dinner with living British prime ministers, 2002: (left to right) Tony Blair, Margaret Thatcher, Edward Heath, Elizabeth, James Callaghan, John Major\nOn the eve of the new millennium, Elizabeth and Philip boarded a vessel from Southwark, bound for the Millennium Dome. Before passing under Tower Bridge, Elizabeth lit the National Millennium Beacon in the Pool of London using a laser torch.[172] Shortly before midnight, she officially opened the Dome.[173] During the singing of *Auld Lang Syne*, Elizabeth held hands with Philip and British prime minister Tony Blair.[174]\n\n\nIn 2002, Elizabeth marked her Golden Jubilee, the 50th anniversary of her accession. Her sister and mother died in February and March, respectively, and the media speculated on whether the Jubilee would be a success or a failure.[175] The death of her sister shook Elizabeth; her funeral was one of the rare occasions where Elizabeth openly cried.[176] Elizabeth again undertook an extensive tour of her realms, beginning in Jamaica in February, where she called the farewell banquet \"memorable\" after a power cut plunged King's House, the official residence of the governor-general, into darkness.[177] As in 1977, there were street parties and commemorative events, and monuments were named to honour the occasion. One million people attended each day of the three-day main Jubilee celebration in London,[178] and the enthusiasm shown for Elizabeth by the public was greater than many journalists had anticipated.[179]\n\n\n\n![](image)Greeting NASA employees at the Goddard Space Flight Center, Maryland, May 2007\nIn 2003, Elizabeth sued the *Daily Mirror* for breach of confidence and obtained an injunction which prevented the outlet from publishing information gathered by a reporter who posed as a footman at Buckingham Palace.[180] The newspaper also paid £25,000 towards her legal costs.[181] Though generally healthy throughout her life, in 2003 she had keyhole surgery on both knees. In October 2006, she missed the opening of the new Emirates Stadium because of a strained back muscle that had been troubling her since the summer.[182]\n\n\nIn May 2007, citing unnamed sources, *The Daily Telegraph* reported that Elizabeth was \"exasperated and frustrated\" by the policies of Tony Blair, that she was concerned the British Armed Forces were overstretched in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that she had raised concerns over rural and countryside issues with Blair.[183] She was, however, said to admire Blair's efforts to achieve peace in Northern Ireland.[184] She became the first British monarch to celebrate a diamond wedding anniversary in November 2007.[185] On 20 March 2008, at the Church of Ireland St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh, Elizabeth attended the first Maundy service held outside England and Wales.[186]\n\n\nElizabeth addressed the UN General Assembly for a second time in 2010, again in her capacity as Queen of all Commonwealth realms and Head of the Commonwealth.[187] The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, introduced her as \"an anchor for our age\".[188] During her visit to New York, which followed a tour of Canada, she officially opened a memorial garden for British victims of the 9/11 attacks.[188] Elizabeth's 11-day visit to Australia in October 2011 was her 16th visit to the country since 1954.[189] By invitation of the Irish president, Mary McAleese, she made the first state visit to the Republic of Ireland by a British monarch in May 2011.[190]\n\n\n\n### Diamond Jubilee and milestones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Visiting Birmingham in July 2012 as part of the Diamond Jubilee tour\nElizabeth's 2012 Diamond Jubilee marked 60 years on the throne, and celebrations were held throughout her realms, the wider Commonwealth, and beyond. She and her husband undertook an extensive tour of the United Kingdom, while her children and grandchildren embarked on royal tours of other Commonwealth states on her behalf.[191] On 4 June, Jubilee beacons were lit around the world.[192] On 18 December, she became the first British sovereign to attend a peacetime Cabinet meeting since George III in 1781.[193]\n\n\nElizabeth, who opened the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, also opened the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in London, making her the first head of state to open two Olympic Games in two countries.[194] For the London Olympics, she played herself in a short film as part of the opening ceremony, alongside Daniel Craig as James Bond.[195] On 4 April 2013, she received an honorary BAFTA for her patronage of the film industry and was called \"the most memorable Bond girl yet\" at the award ceremony.[196]\n\n\n\n![](image)Opening the Borders Railway on the day she became the longest-reigning British monarch, 2015. In her speech, she said she had never aspired to achieve that milestone.[197]\nOn 3 March 2013, Elizabeth stayed overnight at King Edward VII's Hospital as a precaution after developing symptoms of gastroenteritis.[198] A week later, she signed the new Charter of the Commonwealth.[199] Because of her age and the need for her to limit travelling, in 2013 she chose not to attend the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting for the first time in 40 years. She was represented at the summit in Sri Lanka by Prince Charles.[200] On 20 April 2018, the Commonwealth heads of government announced that Charles would succeed her as Head of the Commonwealth, which she stated was her \"sincere wish\".[201] She underwent cataract surgery in May 2018.[202] In March 2019, she gave up driving on public roads, largely as a consequence of a car crash involving her husband two months earlier.[203]\n\n\nElizabeth surpassed her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, to become the longest-lived British monarch on 21 December 2007, and the longest-reigning British monarch and longest-reigning queen regnant and female head of state in the world on 9 September 2015.[204] She became the oldest current monarch after King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia died on 23 January 2015.[205] She later became the longest-reigning current monarch and the longest-serving current head of state following the death of King Bhumibol of Thailand on 13 October 2016,[206] and the oldest current head of state on the resignation of Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe on 21 November 2017.[207] On 6 February 2017, she became the first British monarch to commemorate a sapphire jubilee,[208] and on 20 November, she was the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum wedding anniversary.[209] Philip had retired from his official duties as the Queen's consort in August 2017.[210]\n\n\n\n### Pandemic and widowhood[edit]\n\n\nOn 19 March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United Kingdom, Elizabeth moved to Windsor Castle and sequestered there as a precaution.[211] Public engagements were cancelled and Windsor Castle followed a strict sanitary protocol nicknamed \"HMS Bubble\".[212]\n\n\n\n![](image)Virtual meeting with Cindy Kiro during the pandemic, October 2021\nOn 5 April, in a televised broadcast watched by an estimated 24 million viewers in the UK,[213] she asked people to \"take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.\"[214] On 8 May, the 75th anniversary of VE Day, in a television broadcast at 9 pm—the exact time at which her father George VI had broadcast to the nation on the same day in 1945—she asked people to \"never give up, never despair\".[215] In October, she visited the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory in Wiltshire, her first public engagement since the start of the pandemic.[216] On 4 November, she appeared masked for the first time in public, during a private pilgrimage to the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, to mark the centenary of his burial.[217] In 2021, she received her first and second COVID-19 vaccinations in January and April respectively.[218]\n\n\nPrince Philip died on 9 April 2021, after 73 years of marriage, making Elizabeth the first British monarch to reign as a widow or widower since Queen Victoria.[219] She was reportedly at her husband's bedside when he died,[220] and remarked in private that his death had \"left a huge void\".[221] Due to the COVID-19 restrictions in place in England at the time, Elizabeth sat alone at Philip's funeral service, which evoked sympathy from people around the world.[222] In her Christmas broadcast that year, which was ultimately her last, she paid a personal tribute to her \"beloved Philip\", saying, \"That mischievous, inquiring twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him\".[223]\n\n\nDespite the pandemic, Elizabeth attended the 2021 State Opening of Parliament in May,[224] the 47th G7 summit in June,[225] and hosted US president Joe Biden at Windsor Castle. Biden was the 14th US president that the Queen had met.[226] On 5 July, the 73rd anniversary of the founding of the UK's National Health Service, she announced that the NHS would be awarded the George Cross to \"recognise all NHS staff, past and present, across all disciplines and all four nations\".[227] In October 2021, she began using a walking stick during public engagements for the first time since her operation in 2004.[228] Following an overnight stay in hospital on 20 October, her previously scheduled visits to Northern Ireland,[229] the COP26 summit in Glasgow,[230] and the 2021 National Service of Remembrance were cancelled on health grounds.[231] On Christmas Day 2021, while she was staying at Windsor Castle, 19-year-old Jaswant Singh Chail broke into the gardens using a rope ladder and carrying a crossbow with the aim of assassinating Elizabeth in revenge for the Amritsar massacre. Before he could enter any buildings, he was arrested and detained under the Mental Health Act. In 2023, he pleaded guilty to attempting to injure or alarm the sovereign.[232]\n\n\n\n### Platinum Jubilee and beyond[edit]\n\n\n![](image)With the royal family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace following the Platinum Jubilee Pageant, June 2022\nElizabeth's Platinum Jubilee began on 6 February 2022, marking 70 years since she acceded to the throne on her father's death. On the eve of the date, she held a reception at Sandringham House for pensioners, local Women's Institute members and charity volunteers.[233] In her accession day message, Elizabeth renewed her commitment to a lifetime of public service, which she had originally made in 1947.[234]\n\n\nLater that month, Elizabeth had \"mild cold-like symptoms\" and tested positive for COVID-19, along with some staff and family members.[235] She cancelled two virtual audiences on 22 February,[236] but held a phone conversation with British prime minister Boris Johnson the following day amid a crisis on the Russo-Ukrainian border,[g][237] following which she made a donation to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal.[238] On 28 February, she was reported to have recovered and spent time with her family at Frogmore.[239] On 7 March, Elizabeth met Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau at Windsor Castle, in her first in-person engagement since her COVID diagnosis.[240] She later remarked that COVID infection \"leave[s] one very tired and exhausted ... It's not a nice result\".[241]\n\n\nElizabeth was present at the service of thanksgiving for Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey on 29 March,[242] but was unable to attend the annual Commonwealth Day service that month[243] or the Royal Maundy service in April, due to \"episodic mobility problems\".[244] She missed the State Opening of Parliament in May for the first time in 59 years. (She did not attend the 1959 and 1963 state openings as she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, respectively.)[245] In her absence, Parliament was opened by the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge as counsellors of state.[246]\n\n\nDuring the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, Elizabeth was largely confined to balcony appearances and missed the National Service of Thanksgiving.[247] For the Jubilee concert, she took part in a sketch with Paddington Bear that opened the event outside Buckingham Palace.[248] On 13 June, she became the second-longest reigning monarch in history among those whose exact dates of reign are known, with 70 years, 127 days reigned—surpassing King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand.[249] On 6 September, she appointed her 15th British prime minister, Liz Truss, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. This marked the only time she did not receive a new prime minister at Buckingham Palace during her reign.[250] No other British reign had seen so many prime ministers.[251] The Queen's last public message was issued on 7 September to her Canadian people, in the aftermath of the Saskatchewan stabbings.[252]\n\n\nElizabeth never planned to abdicate,[253] though she took on fewer public engagements as she grew older and Prince Charles took on more of her duties.[254] The Queen told Canadian governor-general Adrienne Clarkson in a meeting in 2002 that she would never abdicate, saying \"It is not our tradition. Although, I suppose if I became completely gaga, one would have to do something\".[255] In June 2022, Elizabeth met the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who \"came away thinking there is someone who has no fear of death, has hope in the future, knows the rock on which she stands and that gives her strength.\"[256]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Death and state funeral of Elizabeth II\n\n![](image)Tributes left in The Mall, London\nOn 8 September 2022, Buckingham Palace released a statement which read: \"Following further evaluation this morning, the Queen's doctors are concerned for Her Majesty's health and have recommended she remain under medical supervision. The Queen remains comfortable and at Balmoral.\"[257][258] Her immediate family rushed to Balmoral to be by her side.[259][260] She died peacefully at 15:10 BST at the age of 96, with two of her children, Charles and Anne, by her side;[261][262] Charles immediately succeeded as monarch. Her death was announced to the public at 18:30,[263][264] setting in motion Operation London Bridge and, because she died in Scotland, Operation Unicorn.[265][266] Elizabeth was the first monarch to die in Scotland since James V in 1542.[267] Her death certificate recorded her cause of death as \"old age\".[261][268]\n\n\nOn 12 September, Elizabeth's coffin was carried up the Royal Mile in a procession to St Giles' Cathedral, where the Crown of Scotland was placed on it.[269] Her coffin lay at rest at the cathedral for 24 hours, guarded by the Royal Company of Archers, during which around 33,000 people filed past the coffin.[270] It was taken by air to London on 13 September. On 14 September, her coffin was taken in a military procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall, where Elizabeth lay in state for four days. The coffin was guarded by members of both the Sovereign's Bodyguard and the Household Division. An estimated 250,000 members of the public filed past the coffin, as did politicians and other public figures.[271][272] On 16 September, Elizabeth's children held a vigil around her coffin, and the next day her eight grandchildren did the same.[273][274]\n\n\n\n![](image)Elizabeth's coffin on the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy, during the procession to Wellington Arch\nElizabeth's state funeral was held at Westminster Abbey on 19 September, which marked the first time that a monarch's funeral service had been held at the Abbey since George II in 1760.[275] More than a million people lined the streets of central London,[276] and the day was declared a holiday in several Commonwealth countries. In Windsor, a final procession involving 1,000 military personnel took place, which 97,000 people witnessed.[277][276] Elizabeth's fell pony, and two royal corgis, stood at the side of the procession.[278] After a committal service at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, Elizabeth was interred with her husband Philip in the King George VI Memorial Chapel later the same day, in a private ceremony attended by her closest family members.[279][280][281][282]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Personality and image of Elizabeth II\n\n### Beliefs, activities, and interests[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Petting a dog in New Zealand, 1974\nElizabeth rarely gave interviews, and little was known of her political opinions, which she did not express explicitly in public. It is against convention to ask or reveal the monarch's views. When *Times* journalist Paul Routledge asked her about the miners' strike of 1984–85 during a royal tour of the newspaper's offices, she replied that it was \"all about one man\" (a reference to Arthur Scargill),[283] with which Routledge disagreed.[284] Routledge was widely criticised in the media for asking the question and claimed that he was unaware of the protocols.[284] After the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Prime Minister David Cameron was overheard saying that Elizabeth was pleased with the outcome.[285] She had arguably issued a public coded statement about the referendum by telling one woman outside Balmoral Kirk that she hoped people would think \"very carefully\" about the outcome. It emerged later that Cameron had specifically requested that she register her concern.[286]\n\n\nElizabeth had a deep sense of religious and civic duty, and took her Coronation Oath seriously.[287] Aside from her official religious role as supreme governor of the established Church of England, she worshipped with that church and with the national Church of Scotland.[288] She demonstrated support for inter-faith relations and met with leaders of other churches and religions, including five popes: Pius XII, John XXIII, John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis.[289] A personal note about her faith often featured in her annual Christmas Message broadcast to the Commonwealth. In 2000, she said:[290]\n\n\n\n\n> To many of us, our beliefs are of fundamental importance. For me the teachings of Christ and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life. I, like so many of you, have drawn great comfort in difficult times from Christ's words and example.\n> \n> \n\n\nElizabeth was patron of more than 600 organisations and charities.[291] The Charities Aid Foundation estimated that Elizabeth helped raise over £1.4 billion for her patronages during her reign.[292] Her main leisure interests included equestrianism and dogs, especially her Pembroke Welsh Corgis.[293] Her lifelong love of corgis began in 1933 with Dookie, the first corgi owned by her family.[294] Scenes of a relaxed, informal home life were occasionally witnessed; she and her family, from time to time, prepared a meal together and washed the dishes afterwards.[295]\n\n\n\n### Media depiction and public opinion[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, as a young woman at the start of her reign, Elizabeth was depicted as a glamorous \"fairytale Queen\".[296] After the trauma of the Second World War, it was a time of hope, a period of progress and achievement heralding a \"new Elizabethan age\".[297] Lord Altrincham's accusation in 1957 that her speeches sounded like those of a \"priggish schoolgirl\" was an extremely rare criticism.[298] In the late 1960s, attempts to portray a more modern image of the monarchy were made in the television documentary *Royal Family* and by televising Prince Charles's investiture as Prince of Wales.[299] Elizabeth also instituted other new practices; her first royal walkabout, meeting ordinary members of the public, took place during a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1970.[300] Her wardrobe developed a recognisable, signature style driven more by function than fashion.[301] In public, she took to wearing mostly solid-colour overcoats and decorative hats, allowing her to be seen easily in a crowd.[302] By the end of her reign, nearly one third of Britons had seen or met Elizabeth in person.[303]\n\n\nAt Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee in 1977, the crowds and celebrations were genuinely enthusiastic;[304] but, in the 1980s, public criticism of the royal family increased, as the personal and working lives of Elizabeth's children came under media scrutiny.[305] Her popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public.[306] Although support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher than at any time in living memory, republican ideology was still a minority viewpoint, and Elizabeth herself had high approval ratings.[307] Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself, and the conduct of Elizabeth's wider family, rather than her own behaviour and actions.[308] Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, although Elizabeth's personal popularity—as well as general support for the monarchy—rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.[309]\n\n\n\n![](image)In Brisbane, Australia, 1982\nIn November 1999, a referendum in Australia on the future of the Australian monarchy favoured its retention in preference to an indirectly elected head of state.[310] Many republicans credited Elizabeth's personal popularity with the survival of the monarchy in Australia. In 2010, Prime Minister Julia Gillard noted that there was a \"deep affection\" for Elizabeth in Australia and that another referendum on the monarchy should wait until after her reign.[311] Gillard's successor, Malcolm Turnbull, who led the republican campaign in 1999, similarly believed that Australians would not vote to become a republic in her lifetime.[312] \"She's been an extraordinary head of state\", Turnbull said in 2021, \"and I think frankly, in Australia, there are more Elizabethans than there are monarchists\".[313] Similarly, referendums in both Tuvalu in 2008 and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 2009 saw voters reject proposals to become republics.[314]\n\n\nPolls in Britain in 2006 and 2007 revealed strong support for the monarchy,[315] and in 2012, Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee year, her approval ratings hit 90 per cent.[316] Her family came under scrutiny again in the last few years of her life due to her son Andrew's association with convicted sex offenders Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his lawsuit with Virginia Giuffre amidst accusations of sexual impropriety, and her grandson Harry and his wife Meghan's exit from the working royal family and subsequent move to the United States.[317] Polling in Great Britain during the Platinum Jubilee, however, showed support for maintaining the monarchy[318] and Elizabeth's personal popularity remained strong.[319] As of 2021 she remained the third most admired woman in the world according to the annual Gallup poll, her 52 appearances on the list meaning she had been in the top ten more than any other woman in the poll's history.[320]\n\n\nElizabeth was portrayed in a variety of media by many notable artists, including painters Pietro Annigoni, Peter Blake, Chinwe Chukwuogo-Roy, Terence Cuneo, Lucian Freud, Rolf Harris, Damien Hirst, Juliet Pannett and Tai-Shan Schierenberg.[321][322] Notable photographers of Elizabeth included Cecil Beaton, Yousuf Karsh, Anwar Hussein, Annie Leibovitz, Lord Lichfield, Terry O'Neill, John Swannell and Dorothy Wilding. The first official portrait photograph of Elizabeth was taken by Marcus Adams in 1926.[323]\n\n\n\n## Titles, styles, honours, and arms[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of titles and honours of Elizabeth II\n\n![](image)\nRoyal cypher of Elizabeth II, surmounted by St Edward's Crown\n![](image)\nPersonal flag of Elizabeth II\n\n### Titles and styles [edit]\n\n\nElizabeth held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, was sovereign of many orders in her own countries and received honours and awards from around the world. In each of her realms, she had a distinct title that follows a similar formula: *Queen of Saint Lucia and of Her other Realms and Territories* in Saint Lucia, *Queen of Australia and Her other Realms and Territories* in Australia, etc. In the Isle of Man, which is a Crown Dependency rather than a separate realm, she was known as Lord of Mann. Elizabeth was also styled *Defender of the Faith*.\n\n\n\n### Arms[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Flags of Elizabeth II\n\nFrom 21 April 1944 until her accession, Elizabeth's arms consisted of a lozenge bearing the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom differenced with a label of three points argent, the centre point bearing a Tudor rose and the first and third a cross of Saint George.[324] Upon her accession, she inherited the various arms her father held as sovereign. Elizabeth also possessed royal standards and personal flags for use in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, and elsewhere.[325]\n\n\n\n\n## Issue[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Birth\n | Marriage\n | Children\n | Grandchildren\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Date\n | Spouse\n |\n| Charles III |  (1948-11-14) 14 November 1948 (age 75) | 29 July 1981Divorced 28 August 1996 | Lady Diana Spencer | William, Prince of Wales | * Prince George of Wales\n* Princess Charlotte of Wales\n* Prince Louis of Wales\n |\n| Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex | * Prince Archie of Sussex\n* Princess Lilibet of Sussex\n |\n| 9 April 2005\n | Camilla Parker Bowles | None\n |\n| Anne, Princess Royal |  (1950-08-15) 15 August 1950 (age 73) | 14 November 1973Divorced 23 April 1992 | Mark Phillips | Peter Phillips | * Savannah Phillips\n* Isla Phillips\n |\n| Zara Tindall | * Mia Tindall\n* Lena Tindall\n* Lucas Tindall\n |\n| 12 December 1992\n | Timothy Laurence | None\n |\n| Prince Andrew, Duke of York |  (1960-02-19) 19 February 1960 (age 64) | 23 July 1986Divorced 30 May 1996 | Sarah Ferguson | Princess Beatrice, Mrs Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi | Sienna Mapelli Mozzi\n |\n| Princess Eugenie, Mrs Jack Brooksbank | * August Brooksbank\n* Ernest Brooksbank\n |\n| Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh |  (1964-03-10) 10 March 1964 (age 60) | 19 June 1999\n | Sophie Rhys-Jones | Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor | None\n |\n| James Mountbatten-Windsor, Earl of Wessex | None\n |\n\n\n## Ancestry[edit]\n\n\n| Ancestors of Elizabeth II[326] |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 8.

She was also a member of the Church of Scotland.\n2. **^** Her godparents were: King George V and Queen Mary; Lord Strathmore; Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (her paternal great-granduncle); Princess Mary, Viscountess Lascelles (her paternal aunt); and Lady Elphinstone (her maternal aunt).[4]\n3. **^** The oft-quoted speech was written by Dermot Morrah, a journalist for *The Times*.[40]\n4. **^** Television coverage of the coronation was instrumental in boosting the medium's popularity; the number of television licences in the United Kingdom doubled to 3 million,[73] and many of the more than 20 million British viewers watched television for the first time in the homes of their friends or neighbours.[74] In North America, almost 100 million viewers watched recorded broadcasts.[75]\n5. **^** The *Sunday Times Rich List 1989* put her number one on the list with a reported wealth of £5.2 billion (approximately £16.3 billion in today's value),[141] but it included state assets like the Royal Collection that were not hers personally.[142] In 1993, Buckingham Palace called estimates of £100 million \"grossly overstated\".[143] In 1971, Jock Colville, her former private secretary and a director of her bank, Coutts, estimated her wealth at £2 million (equivalent to about £14 million in 1993[141]).[144]\n6. **^** The only previous state visit by a British monarch to Russia was made by King Edward VII in 1908. The King never stepped ashore, and met Nicholas II on royal yachts off the Baltic port of what is now Tallinn, Estonia.[155][156] During the four-day visit, which was considered to be one of the most important foreign trips of Elizabeth's reign,[157] she and Philip attended events in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.[158]\n7. **^** Russia invaded Ukraine one day later.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"No. 33153\", *The London Gazette*, 21 April 1926, p. 1\n2. **^** Bradford 2012, p. 22;

Reigning from 1946 until his death in 2016,[6] he is the third-longest verified reigning sovereign monarch in world history after King Louis XIV and Queen Elizabeth II, reigning for 70 years and 126 days.[7][8] His reign of over 70 years is the longest reign of any Thai monarch, and the longest native rule of any Asian sovereign.\n\n\n*Forbes* estimated Bhumibol's fortune – including property and investments managed by the Crown Property Bureau, a body that is neither private nor government-owned (assets managed by the Bureau were owned by the crown as an institution, not by the monarch as an individual)[9]– to be US$30 billion in 2010, and he headed the magazine's list of the \"world's richest royals\" from 2008 to 2013.[10][11][12] In May 2014, Bhumibol's wealth was again listed as US$30 billion.[13]\n\n\nAfter a period of deteriorating health which left him hospitalized on several occasions, Bhumibol died on 13 October 2016 in Siriraj Hospital.[14] He was highly revered by the people in Thailand[15][16] – some saw him as close to divine.[17][18] Notable political activists and Thai citizens who criticized the king or the institution of monarchy were often forced into exile or to suffer frequent imprisonments,[19] yet many cases were dropped before being proceeded or were eventually given royal pardon.[20] His cremation was held on 26 October 2017 at the royal crematorium at Sanam Luang.[21] His son, Maha Vajiralongkorn, succeeded him as King.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)King Bhumibol (right) with his brother, King Ananda Mahidol in 1938\nBhumibol was born at Cambridge Hospital (now Mount Auburn Hospital) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, on 5 December 1927.[22] He was the youngest son of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, the Prince of Songkla, and his commoner wife Mom Sangwan (later Princess Srinagarindra, the Princess Mother). His father was enrolled in the public health program at Harvard University, which is why Bhumibol was the only monarch to be born in the US.[23]: 46–47 Bhumibol had an older sister, Princess Galyani Vadhana, and an older brother, Prince Ananda Mahidol.\n\n\nBhumibol came to Thailand in 1928, after his father obtained a certificate from Harvard. His father died of kidney failure in September 1929, when Bhumibol was less than two years old.[23]: 62 He briefly attended Mater Dei school in Bangkok, but in 1933 his mother took her family to Switzerland, where he continued his education at the École nouvelle de la Suisse romande in Lausanne. In 1934 Bhumibol was given his first camera, which ignited his lifelong enthusiasm for photography.[23]: 67 When Bhumibol's childless uncle Prajadhipok abdicated in 1935, his nine-year-old brother Ananda Mahidol became King Rama VIII. However, the family remained in Switzerland and the affairs of the head of state were conducted by a regency council. They returned to Thailand for only two months in 1938. In 1942, Bhumibol became a jazz enthusiast, and started to play the saxophone, a passion that he kept throughout his life.[23]: 73–74 He received the *baccalauréat des lettres* (high-school diploma with a major in French literature, Latin, and Greek) from the Gymnase Classique Cantonal de Lausanne, and by 1945 had begun studying sciences at the University of Lausanne, when World War II ended and the family was able to return to Thailand.[22]\n\n\n\n## Succession and marriage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)King Ananda Mahidol returned from Switzerland to Thailand, during an official ceremony in January 1946 in Bangkok, with Pridi Banomyong, Srinagarindra, and Prince Bhumibol which was not long before the King's death.\nBhumibol ascended the throne following the death by gunshot wound of his brother, King Ananda Mahidol, on 9 June 1946, under circumstances that remain unclear. While an initial government statement stated that Ananda had accidentally shot himself,[24]: 76–77 an investigation committee ruled this was virtually impossible.[24]: 87 Three palace aides (Chit Singhaseni, But Patthamasarin, and Chaliao Pathumrot) were eventually convicted of regicide, and were executed by firing squad on 17 February 1955, after their appeals for clemency were rejected by Bhumibol.[25]: 92[24]: 78 A third possibility, that Bhumibol accidentally shot his brother while the brothers played with their pistols, was never officially considered.[24]: 77–78[26]\n\n\nBhumibol succeeded his brother, but returned to Switzerland before the end of the 100-day mourning period. Despite his interest in science and technology, he changed his major and enrolled in law and political science to prepare for his duties as head of state. His uncle, Rangsit, Prince of Chainat, was appointed Prince Regent. In Bhumibol's name, Prince Rangsit acknowledged a military coup that overthrew the government of Thamrongnawasawat in November 1947.[24]: 88 The regent also signed the 1949 constitution, which returned to the monarchy many of the powers it had lost by the 1932 Revolution.[24]: 91–93\n\n\nIn December 1946, the Siamese government allocated several hundred thousand dollars for the ceremonial cremation of the remains of the late King Ananda, a necessary preliminary to the coronation of Bhumibol who was required by religious custom to light the funeral pyre. Unsettled conditions in 1947 following a coup d'état resulted in a postponement, and court astrologers determined that 2 March 1949 was the most auspicious date.[27]\n\n\nWhile doing his degree in Switzerland, Bhumibol visited Paris frequently. It was in Paris that he first met Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara, daughter of the Thai ambassador to France (Nakkhatra Mangala) and a great-granddaughter of King Chulalongkorn and thus a cousin of Bhumibol. She was then 15 years old and training to be a concert pianist.[27][28]\n\n\nOn 4 October 1948, while Bhumibol was driving a Fiat Topolino on the Geneva-Lausanne road, he collided with the rear of a braking truck 10 km outside Lausanne. He injured his back, suffered paralysis in half of his face and incurred cuts on his face that cost him the sight of his right eye.[24]: 104[29] Both the royal cremation and coronation had to be postponed once more.[27] While he was hospitalised in Lausanne, Sirikit visited him frequently. She met his mother, who asked her to continue her studies nearby so that Bhumibol could get to know her better. Bhumibol selected for her a boarding school in Lausanne, Riante Rive.[30] A quiet engagement in Lausanne followed on 19 July 1949, and they were married on 28 April 1950, just a week before his coronation. Their wedding was described by *The New York Times* as \"the shortest, simplest royal wedding ever held in the land of gilded elephants and white umbrellas\". The ceremony was performed by Bhumibol's ageing grandmother, Savang Vadhana.[27]\n\n\nBhumibol and Sirikit have four children:\n\n\n\n* (Formerly HRH) Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya, born 5 April 1951 in Lausanne, Switzerland; married Peter Ladd Jensen (now divorced), and has two daughters. Her son, Bhumi Jensen, was killed in the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.[31][32]\n* King Maha Vajiralongkorn (Rama X), born 28 July 1952; married Mom Luang Soamsawali Kitiyakara (later divorced and became HRH the Princess Niece); one daughter. Then married Yuvadhida Polpraserth (later divorced); four sons and a daughter. Third marriage was to Srirasmi Suwadee (now divorced); one son. Fourth and current marriage is to Suthida Tidjai.\n* HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, The Princess Royal, born 2 April 1955; never married, no issue\n* HRH Princess Chulabhorn Walailak, born 4 July 1957; married Virayudh Tishyasarin (now divorced); two daughters\n\n\n## Coronation and titles[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Coronation of Bhumibol Adulyadej\n\n![](image)On 31 October 1956, the monk Bhumibalo visited the Government House to ask for alms. Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram is on the right.\nFile:King Bhumibol coronation 2.jpgCoronation portrait of King Bhumibol Adulyadej\nAfter presiding over the long-delayed, ceremonial cremation of his brother Ananda Mahidol, Bhumibol was crowned King of Thailand on 5 May 1950 in the Phaisan Thaksin Throne Hall in the Grand Palace in Bangkok. It was the first coronation ceremony of a Thai sovereign to rule under the system of constitutional monarchy.[27] During the ceremony, he pledged that he would \"reign with righteousness for the benefit and happiness of the Siamese people\".[c][33] Notable elements associated with the coronation included the Bahadrabith Throne [th] beneath the Great White Umbrella of State and royal regalia and utensils.[34]\n\n\nIn 1950 on Coronation Day, Bhumibol's consort was made queen (Somdej Phra Boromarajini). The date of his coronation is celebrated each 5 May in Thailand as Coronation Day, a public holiday.\n\n\nThe royal couple spent their honeymoon at Hua Hin before they returned to Switzerland, where the king completed his university studies. They returned to Thailand in 1951.[27]\n\n\nFollowing the death of his grandmother Queen Savang Vadhana, Bhumibol entered a 15-day monkhood (22 October 1956 – 5 November 1956) at Wat Bowonniwet, as is customary for Buddhist males on the death of elder relatives. He was ordained by the Supreme Patriarch on 22 October 1956 at the Royal Chapel of the Emerald Buddha in the Grand Palace.[27][35] At this time, Sirikit was appointed his regent. She was later appointed Queen Regent (Somdej Phra Boromarajininat) in recognition of this.\n\n\nAlthough Bhumibol was sometimes referred to as King Rama IX in English, Thais referred to him as *Nai Luang*[d] or *Phra Chao Yu Hua*,[e] which translated to \"the King\" and \"Lord Upon our Heads\", respectively. He was also called *Chao Chiwit* (\"Lord of Life\").[15] Formally, he was referred to as *Phrabat Somdet Phra Chao Yu Hua*[f] or, in legal documents, *Phrabat Somdet Phra Paraminthara Maha Bhumibol Adulyadej*,[g] and in English as \"His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej\". He signed his name as ภูมิพลอดุลยเดช ป.ร. (Bhumibol Adulyadej Por Ror, the Thai equivalent of \"Bhumibol Adulyadej R[ex])\".\n\n\n\n## Role in Thai politics[edit]\n\n\nIn 1957, a military coup overthrew the government of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram with allegations of *lèse-majesté*,[24]: 136–137[36] corruption and manipulation of the election held earlier that year.[36]: 146–148 This began a new and long-lasting relationship between the monarch and military,[37] leading some to perceive that the king condones the Thammasat University massacre in defense of his throne, and support a series of military dictatorships.[24][38] However, during his interview given to the BBC in 1979, the king reiterated that the monarchy should remain impartial and be in peaceful co-existence with everybody.[23]: 139–141 Bhumibol invited public criticism in a 2005 speech,[39] but the *lèse majesté* laws have not been revoked by the Thai parliament yet.\n\n\n\n### Plaek Phibunsongkhram era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)King Bhumibol, together with Queen Sirikit, attended the Red Cross Fair in Bangkok on 9 November 1956\n![](image)King Bhumibol with Queen Sirikit at Nakhon Si Thammarat in 1959\nIn the early years of his reign, during the government of military dictator Plaek Phibunsongkhram, Bhumibol had no real political power and was little more than a ceremonial figure under the military-dominated government. In August 1957, six months after parliamentary elections, General Sarit Thanarat accused the government of Field Marshal Phibunsongkhram of *lèse-majesté* due to its conduct of the 2,500th anniversary celebration of Buddhism.[24]: 129–130, 136–137[36] On 16 September 1957, Phibunsongkhram went to Bhumibol to seek support for his government.[40] Bhumibol advised the field marshal to resign to avoid a coup. Phibunsongkhram refused. That evening, Sarit Thanarat seized power. Two hours later Bhumibol imposed martial law throughout the kingdom.[41] Bhumibol issued a proclamation appointing Sarit as \"military defender of the capital\" without anyone countersigning the proclamation. It included the following:[42]\n\n\n\n\n> Whereas it appears that the public administration by the government under the premiership of Field Marshal P. Phibunsongkhram is untrustworthy, and that the government could not maintain the public order; and whereas the military, led by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, has successfully taken over the public administration and now acts as the Military Defender of the Capital; now, therefore, I do hereby appoint Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat as the Military Defender of the Capital, and command that all the citizens shall remain calm whilst all the government officers shall serve the orders issued by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat. This Proclamation shall come into force immediately. Done this 16th Day of September, Buddhist Era 2500 (1957).[42]\n> \n> \n\n Sarit later admitted in a rare interview with foreign correspondent that the king had no involvement and did not acknowledge anything about the coup until it had been done successfully.[43]\n\n\n### Sarit Thanarat era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bhumibol addresses a joint session of the United States Congress, 29 June 1960\n![](image)King Bhumibol in Royal Thai Army dress in 1960 and is decorated with the Honourable Order of Rama and Legion of Merit\n![](image)King Bhumibol with President Richard Nixon in 1969\nDuring Sarit's dictatorship, the monarchy was revitalised. Bhumibol attended public ceremonies, toured the provinces and patronised development projects, he also visited the United States in June 1960, addressing Congress, and many countries in Europe, including a visit to Rome, hosted by PM Giovanni Gronchi, in September 1960.\n\n\nUnder Sarit, the practice of crawling in front of royalty during audiences, banned by King Chulalongkorn, was revived in certain situations and the royal-sponsored Thammayut Nikaya order was revitalised. For the first time since the absolute monarchy was overthrown, a king was conveyed up the Chao Phraya River in a Royal Barge Procession to offer robes at temples.[44][45]\n\n\nOther disused ceremonies from the classical period of the Chakri Dynasty, such as the royally patronised ploughing ceremony (Thai: พิธีพืชมงคล), were also revived.[46] Bhumibol's birthday (5 December) was declared the national day, replacing the previous national day, the anniversary of the Siamese revolution of 1932 (24 June).[47] Upon Sarit's death on 8 December 1963, an unprecedented 21 days of mourning were declared in the palace. A royal five-tier umbrella shaded his body while it lay in state. Long-time royal adviser Phraya Srivisaravacha later noted that no Prime Minister ever had such an intimate relationship with Bhumibol as Sarit.[48]\n\n\nBhumibol biographer Paul Handley, in *The King Never Smiles*, writes that the dictator Sarit was Bhumibol's tool. Political scientist Thak Chaloemtiarana writes that Sarit used Bhumibol in order to build his own credibility.[49][50]\n\n\n\n### Thammasat University massacre[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Thammasat University massacre\n\nFollowing Sarit's death General Thanom Kittikachorn rose to power to lead Thailand's military dictatorship, ultimately challenged by the 1973 Thai popular uprising. Bhumibol initially asked student protestors to disband. When police attacked and killed dozens of students, sparking protest riots, Bhumibol announced general Thanom's resignation and departure from Thailand.[51]\nAccording to William Stevenson, the king had asked the three tyrants to avoid bloodshed, although the three tyrants had agreed, they later changed their minds. Eventually, it led to the incidents of October 1973.[52]\n\n\nBhumibol distanced himself from the Thai military after Thanom's fall. Political events in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos brought powerful guerrilla and communist movements into power or prominence, which threatened the Thai monarchy and political establishment. Fearing unrest, Bhumibol began to court the military in 1975, visiting camps throughout the country, and publicly warning of internal and external threats.[38]: 87 At this time, Bhumibol increasingly cultivated far-right militias and paramilitary forces, including the Red Gaurs and the Village Scouts, warning that students and political dissidents planned to bring communists to power in Thailand.[24]: 232–9 Finally, Bhumibol provoked outrage among students and legal groups by inviting general Thanom back into the country.\n\n\nThe ensuing chaos was used as a pretext for a military coup, which Bhumibol backed and described as a manifestation of the people's will.[38]: 90–1 The event that catalyzed the coup was the Thammasat University massacre, carried out in the name of defending Bhumibol's throne.[24]: 9 The victorious military junta submitted three names to the king as possible premiers: Deputy President of the king's Privy Council Prakob Hutasingh [th], right-wing Bangkok Governor Thamnoon Thien-ngern [th], and staunchly anti-communist Supreme Court judge Thanin Kraivichien.[38]: 90–1[53] Bhumibol chose Thanin as the most suitable premier, leading student protesters to flee to join the communists in the jungle. Thanin was overthrown in a military coup in October 1977 led by General Kriangsak Chamanan.\n\n\n\n### Prem Tinsulanonda era[edit]\n\n\nKriangsak was succeeded in 1980 by the popular Army Commander-in-Chief, General Prem Tinsulanonda, who later became the Privy Council President.\n\n\nBhumibol's refusal to endorse military coups in 1981 (the April Fool's Day coup) and 1985 (the Share Rebellion) ultimately led to the victory of forces loyal to the government, despite some violence – including, in 1981, the seizure of Bangkok by rebel forces. The coups led many to believe that Bhumibol had misjudged Thai society and that his credibility as an impartial mediator between various political and military factions had been compromised.[54][55][56]\n\n\nFollowing the death of Emperor Hirohito of Japan in 1989, he overtook the distinction as the world's longest-reigning living monarch.[57]\n\n\n\n### Crisis of 1992[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Royal intervention on the night of 20 May. Chamlong Srimuang (left) and Suchinda Kraprayoon (middle) submit to the King (seated)\nMain article: Black May (1992)\n\nIn 1992, Bhumibol played a key role in Thailand's transition to a democratic system. The 1991 Thai coup d'état on 23 February returned Thailand to military dictatorship. After a general election in 1992, the majority parties invited General Suchinda Kraprayoon, a leader of the coup group, to be prime minister. This caused much dissent, which escalated into demonstrations called Black May that led to a large number of deaths when the military was brought in to control protesters. The situation became increasingly critical as police and military forces clashed with protesters. Violence and riots spread to many areas of the capital with rumours of a rift among the armed forces.[58]\n\n\nAmidst the fear of civil war, Bhumibol intervened. He summoned Suchinda and the leader of the pro-democracy movement, retired Major General Chamlong Srimuang, to a televised audience, and urged them to find a peaceful resolution. At the height of the crisis, the sight of both men appearing together on their knees (in accordance with royal protocol) made a strong impression on the nation. Bhumibol then signed Suchinda's amnesty decree that applied to both sides of the conflict, with the reason to protect security and unity of the country.[59] Suchinda resigned soon afterwards.\n\n\nIt was one of the few occasions in which Bhumibol directly and publicly intervened in a political conflict. A general election was held shortly afterward, leading to a civilian government.[60]\n\n\n\n### Crisis of 2005–2006 and the September 2006 coup[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2005–06 Thai political crisis, Finland Plot, and 2006 Thai coup d'état\n\n#### Background to the coup[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2005–06 Thai political crisis\n\nWeeks before the April 2006 legislative election, the Democrat Party-led opposition and the People's Alliance for Democracy petitioned Bhumibol to appoint a replacement prime minister and cabinet. Demands for royal intervention were met with much criticism from the public. Bhumibol, in a speech on 26 April 2006, responded, \"Asking for a Royally-appointed prime minister is undemocratic. It is, pardon me, a mess. It is irrational\".[61]\n\n\nAfter publicly claiming victory in the boycotted April parliamentary elections, Thaksin Shinawatra had a private audience with the king. A few hours later, Thaksin appeared on national television to announce that he would be taking a break from politics. Due to the election result, Bhumibol took the unprecedented step of calling the elections undemocratic.[62]\n\n\nIn May 2006, the Sondhi Limthongkul-owned *Manager Daily* newspaper published a series of articles describing the \"Finland Plot\", alleging that Thaksin and former members of the Communist Party of Thailand planned to overthrow the king and seize control of the nation. No evidence was ever produced to verify the existence of such a plot, and Thaksin and his Thai Rak Thai party vehemently denied the accusations and sued the accusers.\n\n\nIn a rare, televised speech to senior judges, Bhumibol requested the judiciary to take action to resolve the political crisis.[61] On 8 May 2006, the Constitutional Court invalidated the results of the April elections and ordered new elections scheduled for 15 October 2006.[63] The Criminal Court later jailed the Election Commissioners.[64][65]\n\n\nOn 14 July 2006, Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda addressed graduating cadets of the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, telling them that the Thai military must serve the nation and the king—not the government.[66]\n\n\nOn 20 July, Bhumibol signed a royal decree endorsing new House elections for 15 October 2006. In an unprecedented act, the King wrote a note on the royal decree calling for a clean and fair election. That very day, Bhumibol underwent spinal surgery.[67]\n\n\n\n#### The coup[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2006 Thai coup d'état\n\nOn the evening of 19 September, the Thai military overthrew the Thaksin government and seized control of Bangkok in a bloodless coup. The junta, led by the Sonthi Boonyaratglin, Commander of the Army, called itself the Council for Democratic Reform under the Constitutional Monarchy. It accused the deposed prime minister and his regime of crimes, including lèse majesté, and pledged its loyalty to Bhumibol. Martial law was declared, the constitution repealed and the October elections cancelled. Protests and political meetings were banned.[68]\n\n\nThe king's role in the coup was the subject of much speculation among Thai analysts and the international media, although publication of such speculation was banned in Thailand. The king had an audience with Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda at the same time that special forces troops were mobilised.[69] Anti-coup protesters claimed that Prem was the mastermind of the coup, although the military claimed otherwise and banned any discussion of the topic. In a BBC interview, Thitinan Pongsudhirak of Chulalongkorn University noted, \"This coup was nothing short of Thaksin versus the King ... He [the king] is widely seen as having implicitly endorsed the coup.\" In the same interview, social critic Sulak Sivaraksa claimed, \"Without his [the king's] involvement, the coup would have been impossible.\" Sulak added that the king is \"very skillful. He never becomes obviously involved. If this coup goes wrong, Sonthi will get the blame, but whatever happens, the King will only get praise.\"[70] On Saturday, 23 September 2006, the junta warned it would \"urgently retaliate against foreign reporters whose coverage has been deemed insulting to the monarchy.\"[71] Prem did help secure the appointment of Surayud Chulanont, another member of the King's Privy Council, as Premier, and allegedly had a say in the appointment of Surayud's Cabinet. Critics claimed the cabinet was full of \"Prem's boys\".[72][73][74]\n\n\nOn 20 April 2009, Thaksin claimed in an interview with the *Financial Times* that Bhumibol had been briefed by Privy Councillors Prem Tinsulanonda and Surayud Chulanont about their plans to stage the 2006 coup. He claimed that General Panlop Pinmanee, a leader of the People's Alliance for Democracy, had told him of the briefing.[75][76] The Thai embassy in London denied Thaksin's claims.\n\n\n\n#### After the coup[edit]\n\n\nThe junta appointed a constitutional tribunal to rule on alleged polling fraud involving the Thai Rak Thai and Democrat political parties. Guilty rulings would have dissolved both parties, Thailand's largest and oldest, respectively, and banned the parties' leadership from politics for five years. The weeks leading up to the verdicts saw rising political tensions. On 24 May 2007, about a week before the scheduled verdict, Bhumibol gave a rare speech to the Supreme Administrative Court (the president of which is also a member of the constitutional tribunal). \"You have the responsibility to prevent the country from collapsing\", he warned them in the speech, which was shown on all national television channels simultaneously during the evening. \"The nation needs political parties ... In my mind, I have a judgment but I cannot say\", he said. \"Either way the ruling goes, it will be bad for the country, there will be mistakes\".[77][78][79] The tribunal later acquitted the Democrat Party, but dissolved the Thai Rak Thai Party and banned 111 of its executives from politics for five years.\n\n\nThe junta-appointed Constitution Drafting Assembly later tried to use the King in a propaganda campaign to increase public support for its widely criticised draft constitution. The CDA placed billboards saying \"Love the King. Care about the King. Vote in the referendum\" throughout northeast Thailand, where opposition to the junta was greatest.[80]\n\n\n\n### 2008 crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Thai political crisis\n\nThe military's constitution passed the referendum, and a general election was held in December 2007. The People's Power Party (PPP), consisting of many former Thai Rak Thai Party MPs and supporters, won the majority and formed a government.[81] The People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) refused to accept the election results and started protests, eventually laying siege to Government House, Don Mueang Airport, and Suvarnabhumi Airport. Although the PAD claimed they were defending the monarchy, Bhumibol remained silent. However, after a PAD supporter died in a clash with police, Queen Sirikit presided over her cremation. Princess Sirindhorn, when asked at a US press conference whether PAD was acting on behalf of the monarchy, replied, \"I don't think so. They do things for themselves.\"[82] Questioning and criticism over Bhumibol's role in the crisis increased, particularly from the international press.[83][84][85][86][87][88][89] \"It is more and more difficult for them to hold the illusion that the monarchy is universally adored\", says a Thai academic.[90]\n\n\nIn April 2008, Bhumibol appointed alleged coup plotter General Surayud Chulanont to the Privy Council of Thailand. In the weeks leading up to the 2011 general election, Bhumibol appointed Air Chief Marshal Chalit Pukbhasuk, a leader of the 2006 military coup, to his privy council.[91]\n\n\n\n### 2013–2014 crisis[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikisource has original text related to this article:\n**Proclamation on Appointment of Leader of the National Council for Peace and Order**\n\nAfter Prayut Chan-o-cha, Commander of the Royal Thai Army launched a coup d'état, the 12th since the country's first coup in 1932,[92] against the caretaker government, following six months of political crisis. On 24 May 2014, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) said Bhumibol had acknowledged the coup, but stopped short of describing the response as an endorsement.[93] However, on 26 May 2014 Bhumibol formally appointed General Prayut to run the country. In Thailand the monarchy is highly respected and royal endorsement was seen as legitimation of the takeover.[94]\n\n\nPaul Chambers said that the military is the only institution that can sustain the power of Bhumibol monarch, and Bhumibol gave legitimacy to the military and blessing each of the coups. Past two coups showed relationship between the military and the monarch.[95] Serhat Uenaldi said that Bhumibol helped kill off democracy since last 2006 coup by endorsed a military coup against the popular Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.[96]\n\n\n\n### Declining health[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This article has multiple issues.** Please help **improve it** or discuss these issues on the **talk page**. *(Learn how and when to remove these template messages)*\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

In 2011, it was revealed as part of WikiLeaks' leak of United States diplomatic cables that he had suffered from Parkinson's disease and depression.[101] He was diagnosed with diverticulitis in hospital in November 2011, and was treated for the condition in January 2012.[102] Bhumibol suffered minute subdural bleeding in the left frontal area of his brain for which he was treated in July 2012.[103] Bhumibol left the hospital in July 2013,[104] and travelled to Klai Kangwon Palace at Hua Hin on 2 August 2013,[105] but returned intermittently in the following years, most recently on 1 June 2015.[106] Bhumibol was too ill to appear for the public celebration of his birthday on 5 December 2015,[107] but made a televised appearance on 14 December, his first in several months.[108] The King temporarily left hospital to visit Chitralada Royal Villa on 11 January 2016 but returned later that day.[109]\n\n\nOn 1 October 2016, the palace released a bulletin stating that after recovering from a fever, King Bhumibol underwent tests that revealed a blood infection and an X-ray found inflammation on his left lung, along with water in his lungs.[110] He had been in kidney failure for some time and received dialysis.[111][112] By 9 October, he had been placed on a ventilator and doctors pronounced him \"not yet stable\".[113] Crowds of well-wishers, many dressed in pink symbolizing good health and luck, gathered outside Siriraj Hospital and the Grand Palace to offer prayers and support.[114]\n\n\nBy 12 October, the royal children had arrived at Siriraj Hospital and Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn had met with the prime minister.[115][116] There were some internal concerns about the succession of the crown prince, in that he was not perceived to be as well-respected as his father and it was speculated that some palace elites, responding to the people's admiration for Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, might try to position her to take the throne.[117][118]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Death and funeral of Bhumibol Adulyadej\n\n![](image)Bureau of the Royal Household announcement of King Bhumibol Adulyadej's death, 13 October 2016\nKing Bhumibol Adulyadej died at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand on 13 October 2016, at 15:52 local time, at the age of 88, as announced by the royal palace later that day.[6] The following day, his body was taken by motorcade to the Grand Palace for the customary bathing rite.[119] Thousands of the bereaved public lined the route, demonstrating their affection for their \"king of kings\". The royal procession arrived at the Grand Palace through Viset Chaisri Gate at 17:00. His only son and the next in line to rule the kingdom, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, presided over the bathing ritual at Phiman Rattaya Throne Hall.[120]\n\n\nA royal cremation ceremony took place over five days at the end of October 2017. The actual cremation, which was not broadcast on television, was held in the late evening of 26 October 2017.[121][122] Following cremation his ashes were taken to the Grand Palace and were enshrined at the Chakri Maha Phasat Throne Hall (royal remains), the Royal Cemetery at Wat Ratchabophit and the Wat Bowonniwet Vihara Royal Temple (royal ashes).[123] Following burial, the mourning period officially ended on midnight of 30 October 2017, after which Thais resumed wearing regular colours while they awaited the future coronation of King Vajiralongkorn, which was hosted between 4–6 May 2019.[124][125]\n\n\n\n## Royal powers[edit]\n\n\n### Constitutional powers[edit]\n\n\nFor a historical perspective on how Bhumibol's constitutional powers changed over time, see Constitutions of Thailand.\n\n![](image)King Bhumibol with Russian president Putin in 2003\n![](image)Bhumibol in a meeting with US president Barack Obama in 2012\nBhumibol retained enormous powers, partly because of his immense popularity and partly because his powers – although clearly defined in the Thai constitution – were often subject to conflicting interpretations. This was highlighted by the controversy surrounding the appointment of Jaruvan Maintaka as Auditor-General. Jaruvan had been appointed by The State Audit Commission, but in July 2004, the Constitutional Court ruled that her appointment was unconstitutional. Jaruvan refused to vacate her office without an explicit order from Bhumibol, on the grounds that she had previously been royally approved. When the Senate elected a replacement for Jaruvan, Bhumibol refused to approve him.[126] The Senate declined to vote to override Bhumibol's veto.[127] Finally in February 2006 the Audit Commission reinstated Jaruvan when it became clear from a memo from the Office of the King's Principal Private Secretary that King Bhumibol supported her appointment.\nBhumibol only vetoed legislation on rare occasions. In 1976, when the Parliament voted 149–19 to extend democratic elections down to district levels, Bhumibol refused to sign the law.[24]: 233 The Parliament refused to vote to overturn the King's veto. In 1954, Bhumibol vetoed parliamentary-approved land reform legislation twice before consenting to sign it.[24]: 126 The law limited the maximum land an individual could hold to 50 rai (80,000 square metres (860,000 sq ft)), at a time when the Crown Property Bureau was the kingdom's largest land-owner. The law was not enforced as General Sarit soon overthrew the elected government in a coup and repealed the law.\n\n\nBhumibol had the constitutional prerogative to pardon criminals, although there are several criteria for receiving a pardon, including age and remaining sentence. The 2006 pardoning of several convicted child rapists, including an Australian rapist and child pornographer, caused controversy.[128][129][130] However, under the Thai constitution, the king has the prerogative to grant pardons and all laws, royal rescripts, and royal commands relating to state affairs must be countersigned by a minister unless otherwise provided for in the constitution.\n\n\n\n### Network monarchy and extraconstitutional powers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Network monarchy\n\n![](image)City decoration in observance of King Bhumibol's birthday in Phitsanulok, Thailand\nSeveral academics outside Thailand, including Duncan McCargo and Federico Ferrara, noted the active but indirect political involvement of Bhumibol through a \"network monarchy\", whose most significant proxy is Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda. McCargo claimed that Bhumibol's conservative network worked behind the scenes to establish political influence in the 1990s, but was threatened by the landslide election victories of Thaksin Shinawatra in 2001 and 2005.[131] Ferrara claimed, shortly before the Thai Supreme Court delivered its verdict to seize Thaksin Shinawatra's assets, that the judiciary was a well-established part of Bhumibol's network and represented his main avenue to exercise extra-constitutional prerogatives despite having the appearance of being constitutional. He also noted how, in comparison to the Constitutional Court's 2001 acquittal of Thaksin, the judiciary was a much more important part of the \"network\" than it was in the past.[132]\n\n\nThe network's ability to exercise power is based partly on Bhumibol's popularity and strict control of Bhumibol's popular image. According to Jost Pachaly of the Heinrich Böll Foundation, Bhumibol \"plays an important role behind the scenes. But the role is difficult to assess because nothing is reported about it and no one really knows anything specific\", due to lese majeste laws forbidding discussion about Bhumibol's political activities.[133] Bhumibol's popularity was demonstrated following the 2003 Phnom Penh riots in Cambodia, when hundreds of Thai protesters, enraged by rumors that Cambodian rioters had stomped on photographs of Bhumibol, gathered outside the Cambodian embassy in Bangkok. Photographs of the stomping were not published in Thailand, but were available on the internet. The situation was resolved peacefully only when Police General Sant Sarutanonda told the crowd that he had received a call from royal secretary Arsa Sarasin conveying Bhumibol's request for calm. The crowd dispersed.[134]\n\n\n\n## Royal projects[edit]\n\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

This approach will prevent incurring mistakes and failures, and lead to the certain and complete achievement of the objectives.\n> \n> — Bhumibol's speech at Kasetsart University Commencement Ceremony, 19 July 1974.[135]\n> \n\n\nBhumibol was involved in many social and economic development projects. The nature of his involvement varied by political regime.[136]\n\n\nThe government of Plaek Phibunsongkhram (1951–1957) limited Bhumibol to a ceremonial role. During that period Bhumibol produced some films and operated a radio station from Chitlada Palace using personal funds.\n\n\nIn the military governments of Sarit Thanarat and his successors (1958–1980), Bhumibol was portrayed as the \"development King\" and the inspiration for the economic and political goals of the regime. Royally ordered projects were implemented under the financial and political support of the government, including projects in rural areas and communities under the influence of the Communist Party of Thailand. Bhumibol's visits to these projects were heavily promoted by the Sarit government and broadcast in state-controlled media.\n\n\nDuring the governments of General Prem Tinsulanonda (1981–1987), the relationship between the Thai state and the monarch was at its closest. Prem, later to become President of Bhumibol's Privy Council, officially allocated government budgets and manpower to support royal projects. Most activities in this period involved the development of large-scale irrigation projects in rural areas.\n\n\nDuring the modern period (post-1988), the structured development of the royal projects reached its apex. Bhumibol's Chaipattana Foundation was established, promoting his \"sufficiency economy\" theory, an alternative to the export-oriented policies adopted by the period's elected governments. Following the 2006 coup, establishment of a \"sufficiency economy\" was enshrined in the constitution as being a primary goal of the government, and government financial support for royal projects was boosted.\n\n\n\n### Project samplings[edit]\n\n\n* 'Sandwich' and 'Supersandwich' artificial rainmaking project under the Thailand Royal Rainmaking Project\n* Chai Pattana Waste Water Aerator, awarded gold medal by BKU (The Belgian Chamber of Inventors) at Brussels Eureka 2000\n* 'Sufficiency economy' Theory\n* New Theory of Agriculture\n* Rice policy, especially increasing production[137] and improvement of germplasm collections which continues through today.[138] For this he received the first Borlaug Medallion in 2007.[139]\n* Use of Vetiver Grass for soil improvement,[137][138] awarded the International Merit Award by the IECA (International Erosion Control Association)\n* Kaem Ling Project, formation of detention basins[140]\n* Klaeng Din Project, acidic soil treatment[141]\n* Fai Maeo Project, formation of check dams\n* Khun Dan Prakanchon Dam, Nakhon Nayok Province\n* Pa Sak Jolasid Dam, Lop Buri Province\n* Pa Sak River Basin Improvement Project\n* Khlong Lat Pho Project, water diversion to prevent flooding in Bangkok\n* Rama VIII Bridge\n* Ratchadaphisek Road\n* Bangkok Industrial Ring Road/Bhumibol Bridge\n* Huai Ongkod Land Rehabilitation Project, Kanchanaburi Province\n* Khao Hin Son Royal Development Study Centre, Chachoengsao Province\n* Phikun Thong Royal Development Study Centre, Narathiwat Province\n* Huai Sai Royal Development Study Centre, Phetchaburi Province\n* Royal Medical Team.

In addition, the Royal Household sends letters of support to physicians who volunteer to serve in hospitals in provinces where royal palaces are present.[142]\n* In honour of his work in soil science, the United Nations observes the king's birthday, 5 December, as World Soil Day. The first observance was in 2014.[143][144]\n\n\n## 60th anniversary celebrations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 60th Anniversary Celebrations of Bhumibol Adulyadej's Accession\n\nAlso called the Diamond Jubilee, the 60th anniversary celebrations of the king's accession to the throne were a series of events marking Bhumibol's reign in June 2006. Events included a royal barge procession on the Chao Phraya River, fireworks displays, art exhibitions, and the pardoning of 25,000 prisoners,[145] concerts, and dance performances.\n\n\nTied in with the anniversary, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan presented Bhumibol with the United Nations Development Programme's first Human Development Lifetime Achievement Award on 26 May 2006. National holidays were observed on 9 June and 12–13 June 2006. On 9 June, the king and queen appeared on the balcony of Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall before hundreds of thousands of people. The official royal barge procession on 12 June was attended by the king and queen and royal visitors from 26 other countries. On 13 June, a state banquet for the royal visitors was held in the newly constructed Rama IX Throne Hall at the Grand Palace, the first official function of the hall. The Chiang Mai Royal Floral Expo was also held to honour the anniversary.\n\n\nOn 16 January 2007, the CDRM officially declared the end of the 60th anniversary celebrations and commenced year-long celebrations of Bhumibol's 80th birthday.[146]\n\n\n\n## Private life[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Monarchs of the Chakri dynasty |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) | Phutthayotfa Chulalok (King Rama I) |\n| ![](image) | Phutthaloetla Naphalai (King Rama II) |\n| ![](image) | Nangklao (King Rama III) |\n| ![](image) | Mongkut (King Rama IV) |\n| ![](image) | Chulalongkorn (King Rama V) |\n| ![](image) | Vajiravudh (King Rama VI) |\n| ![](image) | Prajadhipok (King Rama VII) |\n| ![](image) | Ananda Mahidol (King Rama VIII) |\n| ![](image) | Bhumibol Adulyadej (King Rama IX) |\n| ![](image) | Vajiralongkorn (King Rama X) |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nBhumibol was a painter, musician, photographer, author and translator. His book *Phra Mahachanok* is based on a traditional *Jataka* story of Buddhist scripture. *The Story of Thong Daeng* is the story of his dog Thong Daeng.[147]\n\n\nIn his youth, Bhumibol was greatly interested in firearms. He kept a carbine, a Sten gun and two automatic pistols in his bedroom, and he and his elder brother, King Ananda Mahidol, often used the gardens of the palace for target practice.[24]: 70\n\n\nThere are two English-language books that provide extensive detail—albeit not always verifiable—about Bhumibol's life, especially his early years and then throughout his entire reign. One is *The Revolutionary King* (2001) by William Stevenson, the other is *The King Never Smiles* (2006) by Paul M. Handley. A third and earlier work, *The Devil's Discus* (1964), is also available in Thai and English. The latter two books are banned in Thailand, while the first has never been sold in the country due to its \"inaccuracies\", despite having been written with royal patronage.[24]: 162\n\n\nBhumibol's creativity in, among other things, music, art and invention, was the focus of a two-minute long documentary created by the government of Abhisit Vejjajiva that was screened at all branches of the Major Cineplex Group and SF Cinema City, the two largest cinema chains in Thailand.[148]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Compositions by Bhumibol Adulyadej\n\n![](image)Saxophone of Bhumibol Adulyadej, displayed at Bangkok National Museum\nBhumibol was an accomplished jazz saxophone player and composer, playing Dixieland and New Orleans jazz, and also the clarinet, trumpet, guitar, and piano.[149] It is widely believed that his father, Mahidol Adulyadej, may have inspired his passion for artistic pursuits at an early age.[150] Bhumibol initially focused on classical music exclusively for two years but eventually switched to jazz since it allowed him to improvise more freely. It was during this time that he decided to specialize in wind instruments, especially the saxophone and clarinet.[150] By the time Bhumibol turned 18, he started to compose his own music with the first being *Candlelight Blues*.[150] He continued to compose even during his reign following his coronation in 1946. Bhumibol performed with Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Benny Goodman, Stan Getz, Lionel Hampton, and Benny Carter.[149][151] Throughout his life, Bhumibol wrote a total of 49 compositions. Much of it is jazz swing but he also composed marches, waltzes, and Thai patriotic songs. His most popular compositions were *Candlelight Blues*, *Love at Sundown*, and *Falling Rain* which were all composed in 1946.[149] Bhumibol's musical influences included Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Benny Carter, and Johnny Hodges.[149] The Bhumibol Adulyadej (King of Thailand) Collection, 1946–1954 at the Library of Congress Music Division includes some of his compositions, including 13 music manuscripts, 100 pieces of printed music, clippings, correspondence, and other miscellaneous documents.[152]\n\n\nBhumibol initially received general music training privately while he was studying in Switzerland, but his older brother, then King Ananda Mahidol, who had bought a saxophone, sent Bhumibol in his place.[151] King Ananda would later join him on the clarinet.[151] On his permanent return to Thailand in 1950, Bhumibol started a jazz band, Lay Kram, whom he performed with on a radio station he started at his palace.[151] The band grew, being renamed the Au Sau Wan Suk Band and he would perform with them live on Friday evenings, occasionally taking telephoned requests.[151] Bhumibol also performed with his band at Thai universities, composing anthems for the universities of Chulalongkorn, Thammasat, and Kasetsart.[151] Bhumibol performed with Benny Goodman at the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall, in 1956, and later played at Goodman's home in New York in 1960.[149] Many bands such as Les Brown and His Band of Renown, Claude Bolling Big Band, and Preservation Hall Jazz Band recorded some of Bhumibol's compositions and can still be heard in Thailand.[149] A 1996 documentary, *Gitarajan*, was made about Bhumibol's music.[149]\n\n\nBhumibol still played music with his Au Sau Wan Suk Band in later years, but was rarely heard in public.[151] In 1964, Bhumibol became the 23rd person to receive the Certificate of Bestowal of Honorary Membership on behalf of Vienna's University of Music and Performing Arts.[150]\n\n\n\n### Sailing[edit]\n\n\nBhumibol was an accomplished sailor and sailboat designer.[153] He won a gold medal for sailing in the Fourth Southeast Asian Peninsular (SEAP) Games in 1967, together with Princess Ubol Ratana whom he tied for points.[154] This accomplishment was all the more remarkable given Bhumibol's lack of binocular depth perception. On 19 April 1966, Bhumibol also sailed the Gulf of Thailand from Hua Hin to Toey Ngam Harbour[155] in Sattahip, covering 60 nautical miles (110 km) in a 17-hour journey on the \"Vega 1\", an OK Class dinghy he built.[24]\n\n\nLike his father, a former military naval engineer, Bhumibol was an avid boat designer and builder. He produced several small sailboat designs in the International Enterprise, OK, and Moth classes. His designs in the Moth class included the \"Mod\", \"Super Mod\", and \"Micro Mod\".[156]\n\n\n\n### Radio amateur[edit]\n\n\nBhumibol was a radio amateur with the call sign HS1A. He was also the patron of the Radio Amateur Society of Thailand (RAST).[157]\n\n\n\n### Patents[edit]\n\n\nBhumibol was the only Thai monarch to hold a patent.[158] He obtained one in 1993 for a waste water aerator named \"Chai Pattana\", and several patents on rainmaking after 1955: the \"sandwich\" rainmaking patent in 1999 and the \"supersandwich\" patent in 2003.[159][160][161]\n\n\n\n## Wealth[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Portrait, TMB Bank office building in Bangkok 2006\n![](image)Portrait, Thai Airways International Building\nEstimates of the post-devaluation (c. 1997–1998) wealth of the royal household and the Crown Property Bureau (CPB) range from US$10–20 billion.[162] In August 2008, *Forbes* published its 2008 version of *The World's Richest Royals* and King Bhumibol was listed first, with an estimated wealth of US$35 billion.[163] A few days later, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand issued a statement that the *Forbes* report incorrectly conflated the wealth of the CPB and that of Bhumibol.[164] In the 2009 *Forbes* list, the Thai government's objections were acknowledged, but *Forbes* justified the continued inclusion of the CPB's assets, as the bureau is responsible for handling the Crown's property and investments.[10] The 2009 estimate was a reduced figure of US$30 billion due to declines in real estate and stocks, and this figure was also published in April 2014 by *Business Spectator*, which also confirmed that the CPB is the body responsible for the management of the Crown's wealth.[10][13]\n\n\nThe wealth and properties of Bhumibol and the royal family are managed by the Privy Purse. The CPB manages the assets of the Crown as an institution. It was established by law, but is directed without the involvement of the Thai government and reports only to the king.[165] The CPB receives many state privileges. Although the minister of finance presides over the CPB's board of directors, final decisions were made solely by Bhumibol. During his lifetime Bhumibol was the only person who could view the CPB's annual report, which was not released to the public.[166]\n\n\nThrough the CPB, the Crown owns equity in many companies and massive amounts of land, including 3,320 acres in central Bangkok, as well as 13,200 acres of rural land.[13][167] The CPB owns 32 percent of Siam Cement (worth US$12.6 billion), 23 percent of Siam Commercial Bank (Thailand's largest bank), and interests in Christiani & Nielsen, Deves Insurance, and Shin Corporation.[13]\n\n\nThe CPB also lets or leases about 36,000 properties to third parties, including the sites of the Anantara Siam Bangkok Hotel, the Suan Lum Night Bazaar, Siam Paragon, and the Central World Tower. The CPB spearheaded a plan to turn Bangkok's historical Ratchadamnoen Avenue into a shopping street known as the \"Champs-Élysées of Asia\" and in 2007, shocked longtime residents of traditional marketplace districts by serving them with eviction notices.[166] The Crown's substantial income from the CPB, estimated to be at least five billion baht in 2004, is exempt from taxes.[166][168]\n\n\nKing Bhumibol was the owner of the Golden Jubilee Diamond, the largest faceted diamond in the world, which is estimated to be worth between US$4–12 million in April 2014.[13]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A government officer pays respect to the portrait of King Bhumibol.\nMain article: Lèse majesté in Thailand\n\nAlthough Bhumibol was held in great respect by many Thais,[15] he was also protected by some of the strictest *lèse-majesté* laws in the world. Under these laws, critics could be jailed for three to fifteen years.[169] After the Thammasat University Massacre in 1976, the laws were toughened during the dictatorship of royalist and anti-communist Premier Thanin Kraivichien. Criticism of any member of the royal family, the royal development projects, the royal institution, the Chakri Dynasty or any previous Thai king was also banned.\n\n\nDuring his 2005 birthday speech, Bhumibol invited criticism: \"Actually, I must also be criticised. I am not afraid if the criticism concerns what I do wrong, because then I know. Because if you say the king cannot be criticised, it means that the king is not human\", he claimed. \"If the king can do no wrong, it is akin to looking down upon him because the king is not being treated as a human being. But the king can do wrong.\"[39] A widespread barrage of criticisms resulted, followed by a sharp rise in *lèse-majesté* prosecutions. *Lèse-majesté* cases rose from five or six a year pre-2005 to 478 in 2010.[170]\n\n\nAlthough *lèse-majesté* officially only applies to current kings, in practice the laws are very broadly construed and flexible. Even after his death, Bhumibol remains protected by *lèse-majesté*.\n\n\n\n## Biographies[edit]\n\n\nAmerican journalist Paul Handley, who spent thirteen years in Thailand, wrote the biography *The King Never Smiles*. The Information and Communications Ministry banned the book and blocked the book's page on the Yale University Press website in January 2006. In a statement dated 19 January 2006, Thai National Police Chief General Kowit Wattana said the book had \"contents which could affect national security and the good morality of the people\".[171] The book provided a detailed discussion of Bhumibol's role in Thai political history, and it also analyzed the factors behind Bhumibol's popularity.\n\n\nWilliam Stevenson, who had access to the royal court and the royal family, wrote the biography *The Revolutionary King* in 2001.[172] An article in *Time* said the idea for the book was suggested by Bhumibol.[173] Critics noted that the book displayed intimate knowledge about personal aspects of Bhumibol. However, the book was unofficially banned in Thailand and the Bureau of the Royal Household warned the Thai media about even referring to it in print. An official ban was not possible as it was written with Bhumibol's blessing. The book was criticised for factual inaccuracies, disrespecting Bhumibol (it refers to him by his personal nickname \"Lek\"), and proposing a controversial theory explaining the mysterious death of King Ananda. Stevenson said: \"The king said from the beginning the book would be dangerous for him and for me.\"[173]\n\n\n\n## Succession to the throne[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The King's Royal Cypher and personal flag\nPrior to 1972, there was widespread speculation that Bhumibol had been considering his eldest child Ubol Ratana as successor. Ubol Ratana, considered Bhumibol's most intelligent and favorite child, disobeyed her parents by marrying Peter Ladd Jensen, her classmate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her parents stripped her of her royal title and banished her from the court; she did not return to Thailand for eight years.[24]: 684 After this, Bhumibol's only son, Prince Vajiralongkorn, was given the title \"Somdej Phra Boroma Orasadhiraj Chao Fah Maha Vajiralongkorn Sayam Makutrajakuman\" (Crown Prince of Siam) on 28 December 1972 and made heir apparent (องค์รัชทายาท) to the throne in accordance with the Palace Law on Succession of 1924.[174]\n\n\nOn 5 December 1977, Princess Sirindhorn was given the title \"Siam Boromrajakumari\" (Princess Royal of Siam). Her title is often translated by the English-language press as \"Crown Princess\", although her official English-language title is simply \"Princess\".[175]\n\n\nAlthough the constitution was later amended to allow the Privy Council to appoint a princess as successor to the throne, this would only occur in the absence of an heir apparent. This amendment is retained in Section 23 of the 1997 \"People's Constitution\". This effectively allowed Princess Sirindhorn to potentially be second in line to the throne, but did not affect Prince Vajiralongkorn's status as heir apparent.\n\n\nRecent constitutions of Thailand have made the amendment of the Palace Law of Succession the sole prerogative of the reigning king. According to Assoc. Prof. Gothom Arya, former election commissioner, this allows the reigning king, if he so chooses, to appoint his son or any of his daughters to the throne.[176]\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nBhumibol's signature in 1952 Amendment to the Thai Constitution of 1932, signed as \"Somdet Phra Poraminthra Maha **Bhumibol Adulyadej** Sayaminthrathirat Borommanatbophit\"\n\nBhumibol's US birth certificate reads simply \"**Baby Songkla**\", as the parents had to consult his uncle, King Rama VII (Prajadhipok), then head of the House of Chakri, for an auspicious name. The king chose a name of Sanskrit origin, *Bhumibol Adulyadej* (Devanagari: भूमिबल अतुल्यतेज, IAST: *Bhūmibala Atulyateja*), a compound of *Bhūmi* (भूमि), meaning \"Land\"; *Bala* (बल), meaning \"Strength\" or \"Power\"; *Atulya* (अतुल्य), meaning \"Incomparable\"; and *Tej* (तेज), meaning \"Power\". Thus, *Bhūmibala Atulyateja*, or *Bhumibol Adulyadej* as it is transliterated in Thai, can be literally translated as \"Strength of the Land, Incomparable Power\".[22]\n\n\n\n## Titles and honours[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of titles and honours of Bhumibol Adulyadej\n\n\n\n| Styles of**King Bhumibol Adulyadej  Rama IX of Thailand** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Reference style | His Majesty |\n| Spoken style | Your Majesty |\n\n\n![](image)Royal Monogram of King Bhumibol Adulyadej\n### Titles and styles[edit]\n\n\n* 5 December 1927 – 9 July 1935: *His Highness* Prince Bhumibol Aduldej (พระวรวงศ์เธอ พระองค์เจ้าภูมิพลอดุลเดช *Phra Worawong Thoe Phra Ong Chao Bhumibol Aduldej*)[177]\n* 9 July 1935 – 9 June 1946: *His Royal Highness* Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej of Siam (สมเด็จพระเจ้าน้องยาเธอ เจ้าฟ้าภูมิพลอดุลยเดช *Somdet Phrachao Nongya Thoe Chaofa Bhumibol Adulyadej*)[177]\n* 9 June 1946 – 13 October 2016: *His Majesty* The King of Thailand\n\t+ 9 June 1946 – 5 May 1950 (สมเด็จพระเจ้าอยู่หัว *Somdet Phrachao Yuhua*)[177]\n\t+ 5 May 1950 – 13 October 2016 (พระบาทสมเด็จพระเจ้าอยู่หัว *Phrabat Somdet Phrachao Yuhua*)[177]\n\n\n### Military rank[edit]\n\n\nHis highest rank was as a field marshal.[178] His other ranks in the military include Admiral of the Fleet[179] and Marshal of the Royal Thai Air Force.[178]\n\n\n\n## Issue[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Birth\n | Marriage\n | Their children\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Date\n | Spouse\n |\n| Princess Ubolratana |  (1951-04-05) 5 April 1951 (age 73) | 29 July 1981Divorced 1998 | Peter Ladd Jensen\n | Ploypailin Jensen |\n| Poom Jensen |\n| Sirikitiya Jensen |\n| Vajiralongkorn (Rama X)\n |  (1952-07-28) 28 July 1952 (age 71) | 3 January 1977Divorced 12 August 1991 | Soamsawali Kitiyakara | Bajrakitiyabha, Princess Rajasarini Siribajra |\n| February 1994Divorced 1996 | Yuvadhida Polpraserth | Juthavachara Vivacharawongse\n |\n| Vacharaesorn Vivacharawongse |\n| Chakriwat Vivacharawongse\n |\n| Vatchrawee Vivacharawongse\n |\n| Princess Sirivannavari |\n| 10 February 2001Divorced 11 December 2014 | Srirasmi Suwadee | Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti |\n| 1 May 2019\n | Suthida Tidjai | None\n |\n| Sirindhorn, Princess Royal |  (1955-04-02) 2 April 1955 (age 69) | None\n | None\n |\n| Chulabhorn, Princess Srisavangavadhana |  (1957-07-04) 4 July 1957 (age 66) | 7 January 1982Divorced 1996 | Virayudh Tishyasarin\n | Princess Siribha Chudabhorn |\n| Princess Aditayadorn Kitikhun |\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand. *The Story of Tongdaeng*.

He ascended to the throne shortly after his 18th birthday. Until he was surpassed by Elizabeth II on 9 May 2022, his reign had been the longest precisely documented tenure of any European monarch since antiquity in which a regent (that is, a regent serving in place of an underage sovereign) was never employed.[1] Although his mother acted as his regent from 10 February 1859 to November 1860,[2][3] she was not the regent for a minor, but was appointed by her son to fulfil his duties because he wished to finish his education before he began his rule.\n\n\n\n## Law and reform[edit]\n\n\nIn 1862, Johann II issued Liechtenstein's first constitution, which was heavily influenced by the likes of Vorarlberg.[4] After World War I and due to significant popular demand, Johann II granted a new constitution, which was ratified on 5 October 1921. It granted considerable political rights to common Liechtensteiners and made the principality a constitutional monarchy.[5] The constitution has survived but with revisions, most notably in 2003.[6]\n\n\n\n## Foreign affairs[edit]\n\n\nLiechtenstein left the German Confederation in 1866. Not long afterward, the Liechtenstein Army was abolished as it was regarded as an unnecessary expense.\n\n\n\n![](image)Portrait by John Quincy Adams, 1908\nIn 1867 Alexander II of Russia had offered Johann to purchase Russian Alaska, but he refused as he believed the territory was useless.[7][8]\n\n\nJohann II somewhat cooled relations with Liechtenstein's traditional ally, Austria-Hungary and its successor states, to forge closer relations with Switzerland, particularly after World War I. Liechtenstein was neutral during the war, which broke Liechtenstein's alliance with Austria-Hungary and led it to go into a customs union with Switzerland. In 1924, late in Johann's reign, the Swiss franc became Liechtenstein's official currency.[9]\n\n\n\n## Patron of arts[edit]\n\n\nJohann II, an outstanding art connoisseur and a generous patron, added much to the Liechtenstein Princely Collections. Although considered a prominent patron of the arts and sciences during his long reign,[10] Johann II was also considered to be rather unsociable and did not participate in social events. Rarely did he show up in his magnificent Vienna residences, Liechtenstein City Palace and Liechtenstein Garden Palace. He also never assumed any tasks of the Austrian politics or the Austrian military. And he never married or had any children, like several other members of his family.[11]\n\n\nFrom 1884 he had Liechtenstein Castle rebuilt, the ancestral seat of his family near Vienna which had fallen into ruins. Between 1905 and 1920, Schloss Vaduz was renovated and expanded. Like all of his ancestors he never lived in the principality of Liechtenstein, but on the vast Austrian and Moravian estates of the House of Liechtenstein which were 7.5 times the total area of the Principality itself. His main home were the castles of Lednice and Valtice (German names: Eisgrub and Feldsberg) in what is today the Czech Republic (then part of Austria-Hungary with the Austrian-Bohemian border running through the park between the two castles). The local administration of the Principality was overseen by a governor, and the government office was located at the prince's seat. It was not until the German occupation of the Czech lands at the beginning of World War II that the residence was moved to Vaduz. \n\n\n\n## Declining health and death[edit]\n\n\nAs Johann entered his later years his eyesight began to decline rapidly and on 12 November 1928 he underwent surgery to remove cataracts.[12] He died on 11 February 1929 and was succeeded by his younger brother Franz I.[13][14]\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order, *1860* (Kingdom of Hanover)[15]\n* ![](image) Knight of the Golden Fleece, *1862* (Austrian Empire)[16]\n* ![](image) Grand Cross of St. Stephen, *1896* (Austria-Hungary)[17]\n* ![](image) Knight of St. Hubert, *1882* (Kingdom of Bavaria)[18]\n* ![](image) Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion (Sovereign Military Order of Malta)[19]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Worldstatesmen.org – Liechtenstein.

He became known as the Grand Dauphin after the birth of his own son, Louis, Duke of Burgundy, the Petit Dauphin. He and his son died before his father and thus never became kings. Instead, his grandson became King Louis XV at the death of Louis XIV, and his second son inherited the Spanish throne as Philip V through his grandmother.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nLouis was born on 1 November 1661 at the Château de Fontainebleau, the eldest son of Louis XIV of France and Maria Theresa of Austria (who were double first-cousins to each other). As a *Fils de France* (\"Son of France\") he was entitled to the style of *Royal Highness.* He was baptised on 24 March 1662 at the chapel of the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye and given his father's name of Louis. At the ceremony, the Cardinal de Vendôme and the Princess of Conti acted as proxies for the godparents, Pope Clement IX and Queen Henrietta Maria of England. The latter was Louis's great-aunt. It was for this occasion that Jean-Baptiste Lully composed the motet *Plaude Laetare Gallia*.\n\n\n\n![](image)Louis by Jean Nocret, c. 1668\nHe was initially under the care of royal governesses, among them being Julie d'Angennes and Louise de Prie de La Mothe-Houdancourt. When Louis reached the age of seven, he was removed from the care of women and placed in a society of men. He received Charles de Sainte-Maure, as his governor and was tutored by the great French preacher and orator Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet, the Bishop of Meaux, seemingly without acceptable results.\n\n\nPhilippe Erlanger writes the following in his book about the life of Louis XIV:\n\n\n\n\n> Louis XIV secretly nursed the same suspicious jealousy of the Grand Dauphin that Louis XIII had once shown to himself. No prince could have been less deserving of such feelings.\n> \n> \n> The *Monseigneur*, as the heir to the throne was now known to have inherited his mother's docility and low intelligence. All his life he remained petrified with admiration of his formidable father and stood in fear of him even while lavish proofs of 'affection' were showered upon him. The best way for the *Monseigneur* to do someone an injury was to commend him to the royal favour. He knew it, and did not conceal it from his rare petitioners.\n> \n> \n> Louis XIV saw to it that his son's upbringing was quite the opposite of his own. Instead of a devoted mother and an affectionate and likeable tutor, the Dauphin had the repellent and misanthropic Duc de Montausier, who ruthlessly applied the same methods that had so disturbed Louis XIII. They annihilated his grandson.\n> \n> \n> \n> Bossuet overwhelmed his backward pupil with such splendid lessons that the Dauphin developed a lasting horror of books, learning and history. By the age of eighteen, the *Monseigneur* had assimilated almost none of the knowledge amassed to so little purpose, and the apathy of his mind was second only to that of his senses.[1]\n> \n> \n\n\nIt was said that when Louis was an adult, he could pass a whole day simply tapping his cane against his foot in an armchair. Nonetheless, his generosity, affability, and liberality gave him great popularity in Paris and with the French people in general. Louis was one of six legitimate children of his parents. The others all died in early childhood; the second longest-lived, Marie Thérèse of France, died at the age of five when Louis was 11.\n\n\nAccording to John B. Wolf, Louis XIV had a low opinion of his son, writing:\n\n\n\n\n> ...indolent, fatuous, and dull, only the saving grace of his bourgeois morals kept him from outraging the pious people about him. Like his father he enjoyed the hunt, but that was about the only way in which this disappointing son resembled his father.[2]\n> \n> \n\n\nBeing especially interested in geopolitical ties his son could help him form, the King considered various European royal daughters as possible wives for his heir, such as Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici and Louis' cousin Marie Louise d'Orléans, daughter of Philippe I, Duke of Orléans and Henrietta of England. According to various sources, Marie Louise and Louis were in love and had grown up with each other. However, Louis XIV decided to use Marie Louise to instead forge a link with Spain and made her to marry the invalid Charles II of Spain, the Dauphin's half-uncle.\n\n\nLouis was eventually engaged to his second cousin, Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria, when he was seven. She was a year older than Louis and, upon arriving at the French court, was described as being very unattractive. Nonetheless, she was a very cultured princess, and made a good first impression as she was able to speak French fluently.\n\n\nThey were married by proxy in Munich on 28 January 1680; the couple met for the first time on 7 March 1680 in Châlons-sur-Marne.\n\n\n\n## Political and military role[edit]\n\n\nAlthough he was permitted at first to attend and later to participate in the *Conseil d'en haut*, Louis did not play an important part in French politics. Nonetheless, as the heir to the throne, he was constantly surrounded by cabals battling for future prominence. Apart from the minor political role that he played during his father's reign, Louis engaged in more leisurely pursuits and was esteemed for his magnificent collection of art at Versailles and Meudon. Louis XIV purchased Meudon for him from the widow of Louvois. The Dauphin employed Jules Hardouin Mansart and the office of the *Bâtiments du Roi* but most particularly his long-term \"house designer\", Jean Bérain, head of the Menus Plaisirs, to provide new decors. He lived quietly at Meudon for the remainder of his life and was surrounded by his two half-sisters Marie Anne de Bourbon and the Princess of Condé, both of whom he loved dearly. The three made up the main part of the *Cabal de Meudon* \n, which opposed the Dauphin's son Louis and his Savoyard wife, the Duchess of Burgundy.\n\n\n\nDuring the War of the Grand Alliance, he was sent in 1688 to the Rhineland front. Before leaving the court, Louis was thus instructed by his father: \n\n\n> In sending you to command my army, I am giving you an opportunity to make known your merit; go and show it to all Europe, so that when I come to die it will not be noticed that the King is dead.\n> \n> \n\n\nThere, Louis succeeded, under the tutelage of Marshal de Duras and Vauban, in taking one of the bridgeheads across the Rhine, Philippsburg, which was surrounded by marshes. Louis's courage was shown when he visited the soldiers in the inundated trenches under heavy fire to observe the progress of the siege.[3] Montausier, his former governor, wrote to him: \n\n\n\n\n> I shall not compliment you on the taking of Philippsburg; you had a good army, bombs, cannons and Vauban. I shall not compliment you because you are brave. That virtue is hereditary. But I rejoice with you that you have been liberal, generous, humane, and have recognised the services of those who did well.[4]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)The Grand Dauphin\nLouis's capture of Philippsburg prevented the large gathering Imperial Army from crossing the Rhine and invading Alsace.\n\n\nLouis's position in the *Conseil d'en haut* gave him an opportunity to have his voice heard in the years and in the crises leading up to the War of the Spanish Succession. From his mother, Louis had rights and claims to the Spanish throne. His uncle Charles II of Spain had produced no descendants and, as he lay dying, had no heir to whom he could pass the throne. The choice of a successor was essentially split between the French and Austrian claimants. To improve the chances of a Bourbon succession, Louis gave up his and his eldest son's rights in favour of his second son, Philip, Duke of Anjou (later Philip V of Spain), who, as the second son, was not expected to succeed to the French throne, which would thus keep France and Spain separate. Moreover, in the discussions in the *Conseil d'en haut* regarding the French response to Charles II's last will and testament, which indeed left all Spanish possessions to Anjou, Louis persuasively argued for acceptance. He opposed those who advocated a rejection of the will and the adherence to the Partition Treaty, which was signed with William III of England, even though the treaty had awarded Naples, Sicily and Tuscany to him.\n\n\nLouis died of smallpox on 14 April 1711, at the age of 49, and so predeceased his father.\n\n\n\n## Literary tribute[edit]\n\n\n* The *Delphin Classics* were a large edition of the Latin classics, edited in the 1670s for Louis (*Delphin* is the adjective derived from *dauphin*) and known for being written (unlike some other treatments) entirely in that language. Thirty-eight scholars contributed to the series, which was edited by Pierre Huet, with assistance from several co-editors including Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet and Anne Dacier.\n\n\n## Marriages[edit]\n\n\nLouis married Duchess Maria Anna of Bavaria on 7 March 1680. She was known in France as *Dauphine Marie Anne Victoire*. Although the marriage was not a close one, the couple had three sons. The *Dauphine* died in 1690 and in 1695 Louis secretly married his lover Marie Émilie de Joly de Choin. His new wife did not acquire the status of Dauphine of France, and the marriage remained without surviving issue. Pregnant at the time of her marriage, de Choin gave birth to a son, who was secretly sent to the countryside; the child died aged two, in 1697, without having been publicly named.[5]\n\n\n\n### Issue[edit]\n\n\n* Louis, Duke of Burgundy (16 August 1682 – 18 February 1712), Duke of Burgundy and later Dauphin of France; married his double-second-cousin, Maria Adelaide of Savoy, elder daughter of the Duke of Savoy and was the father of the future Louis XV of France;\n* Philip V, King of Spain (19 December 1683 – 9 July 1746), Duke of Anjou and later King of Spain; married firstly his double-second-cousin, Maria Luisa of Savoy, younger daughter of the Duke of Savoy, and had issue; married secondly Elisabeth Farnese and had issue including the future Dauphine of France, Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain;\n* Charles, Duke of Berry (31 July 1686 – 5 May 1714), Duke of Berry, of Alençon and of Angoulême, Count of Ponthieu; married Marie Louise Élisabeth d'Orléans and had issue but none survived over a year.\n\n\nThus, through his two older sons Burgundy and Anjou, Louis ensured respectively the continuation of the senior Bourbon line on the throne of France and the establishment of the Spanish Bourbon dynasty.\n\n\nBesides his unnamed child with Mme de Choin, Louis had two illegitimate daughters with Françoise Pitel:[6][7][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n* Anne Louise de Bourbon (1695 – August 1716) – wife of Anne Errard d'Avaugour;\n* Charlotte de Fleury (6 February 1697 – 1750) – wife of Gérard Michel de La Jonchère.\n\n\nWith another mistress, Marie Anne Caumont de La Force, he had one daughter:[7]\n\n\n\n* Louise Émilie de Vautedard (1694–1719) – wife of Nicolas Mesnager.\n\n\n## Ancestry[edit]\n\n\nLouis's paternal grandparents were Louis XIII of France and Anne of Austria; he was descended, on his mother's side, from Philip IV of Spain and Élisabeth of France. Louis XIII and Élisabeth de Bourbon were siblings (the children of Henry IV of France and Marie de' Medici), as were Anne of Austria and Philip IV, who were the children of Philip III of Spain and Margaret of Austria. That means that he had only four great grandparents instead of the usual eight, and that his double cousin parents had the same coefficient of coancestry (1/4) as if they were half-siblings.\n\n\n\n| Ancestors of Louis of France |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 8.

He was also the last Emperor of India from 1936 until the British Raj was dissolved in August 1947, and the first head of the Commonwealth following the London Declaration of 1949.\n\n\nThe future George VI was born during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria; he was named Albert at birth after his great-grandfather Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and was known as \"Bertie\" to his family and close friends. His father ascended the throne as George V in 1910. As the second son of the king, Albert was not expected to inherit the throne. He spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, Edward, the heir apparent. Albert attended naval college as a teenager and served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force during the First World War. In 1920, he was made Duke of York. He married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923, and they had two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret. In the mid-1920s, he engaged speech therapist Lionel Logue to treat his stutter, which he learned to manage to some degree. His elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII after their father died in 1936, but Edward abdicated later that year to marry the twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. As heir presumptive to Edward VIII, Albert became king, taking the regnal name George VI.\n\n\nIn September 1939, the British Empire and most Commonwealth countries—but not Ireland—declared war on Nazi Germany, following the invasion of Poland. War with the Kingdom of Italy and the Empire of Japan followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. George VI was seen as sharing the hardships of the common people and his popularity soared. Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Blitz while the King and Queen were there, and his younger brother the Duke of Kent was killed on active service. George became known as a symbol of British determination to win the war. Britain and its allies were victorious in 1945, but the British Empire declined. Ireland had largely broken away, followed by the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947. George relinquished the title of Emperor of India in June 1948 and instead adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by smoking-related health problems in the later years of his reign and died at Sandringham House, aged 56, of a coronary thrombosis in 1952. He was succeeded by his elder daughter, Elizabeth II.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Four kings: Edward VII (far right); his son George, Prince of Wales, later George V (far left); and grandsons Edward, later Edward VIII (rear); and Albert, later George VI (foreground), c. 1908\nAlbert was born at York Cottage, on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria.[1] His father was Prince George, Duke of York (later King George V), the second and only surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra). His mother, the Duchess of York (later Queen Mary), was the eldest child and only daughter of Francis, Duke of Teck, and Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck.[2] His birthday, 14 December 1895, was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather Albert, Prince Consort.[3] Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been \"rather distressed\". Two days later, he wrote again: \"I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name *Albert* to her.\"[4]\n\n\nThe Queen was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: \"I am all impatience to see the *new* one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good.\"[5] Consequently, he was baptised \"Albert Frederick Arthur George\" at St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham on 17 February 1896.[d] Formally he was His Highness Prince Albert of York; within the royal family he was known informally as \"Bertie\".[7] The Duchess of Teck did not like the first name her grandson had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name \"may supplant the less favoured one\".[8] Albert was fourth in line to the throne at birth, after his grandfather, father and elder brother, Edward.\n\n\nAlbert was ill often and was described as \"easily frightened and somewhat prone to tears\".[9] His parents were generally removed from their children's day-to-day upbringing, as was the norm in aristocratic families of that era. He had a stutter that lasted for many years. Although naturally left-handed, he was forced to write with his right hand, as was common practice at the time.[10] He had chronic stomach problems as well as knock knees, for which he was forced to wear painful corrective splints.[11]\n\n\nQueen Victoria died on 22 January 1901, and the Prince of Wales succeeded her as King Edward VII. Prince Albert moved up to third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother.\n\n\n\n## Military career and education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)At an RAF dinner, 1919\nBeginning in 1909, Albert attended the Royal Naval College, Osborne, as a naval cadet. In 1911 he came bottom of the class in the final examination, but despite this he progressed to the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth.[12] When his grandfather Edward VII died in 1910, his father became King George V. Prince Edward became Prince of Wales, with Albert second in line to the throne.[13]\n\n\nAlbert spent the first six months of 1913 on the training ship HMS *Cumberland* in the West Indies and on the east coast of Canada.[14] He was rated as a midshipman aboard HMS *Collingwood* on 15 September 1913. He spent three months in the Mediterranean, but never overcame his seasickness.[15] Three weeks after the outbreak of World War I he was medically evacuated from the ship to Aberdeen, where his appendix was removed by Sir John Marnoch.[16] He was mentioned in dispatches for his actions as a turret officer aboard *Collingwood* in the Battle of Jutland (31 May – 1 June 1916), the great naval battle of the war. He did not see further combat, largely because of ill health caused by a duodenal ulcer, for which he had an operation in November 1917.[17]\n\n\nIn February 1918 Albert was appointed Officer in Charge of Boys at the Royal Naval Air Service's training establishment at Cranwell. With the establishment of the Royal Air Force Albert transferred from the Royal Navy to the Royal Air Force.[18] He served as Officer Commanding Number 4 Squadron of the Boys' Wing at Cranwell until August 1918,[19] before reporting for duty on the staff of the RAF's Cadet Brigade at St Leonards-on-Sea and then at Shorncliffe.[20] He completed a fortnight's training and took command of a squadron on the Cadet Wing.[21] He was the first member of the British royal family to be certified as a fully qualified pilot.[22]\n\n\nAlbert wanted to serve on the Continent while the war was still in progress and welcomed a posting to General Trenchard's staff in France. On 23 October, he flew across the Channel to Autigny.[23] For the closing weeks of the war, he served on the staff of the RAF's Independent Air Force at its headquarters in Nancy, France.[24] Following the disbanding of the Independent Air Force in November 1918, he remained on the Continent for two months as an RAF staff officer until posted back to Britain.[25] He accompanied King Albert I of Belgium on his triumphal re-entry into Brussels on 22 November. Prince Albert qualified as an RAF pilot on 31 July 1919 and was promoted to squadron leader the following day.[26]\n\n\nIn October 1919, Albert went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied history, economics and civics for a year,[27] with the historian R. V. Laurence as his \"official mentor\".[28] On 4 June 1920 his father created him Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killarney.[29] He began to take on more royal duties. He represented his father and toured coal mines, factories, and railyards. Through such visits he acquired the nickname of the \"Industrial Prince\".[30] His stutter, and his embarrassment over it, together with a tendency to shyness, caused him to appear less confident in public than his older brother, Edward. However, he was physically active and enjoyed playing tennis. He played at Wimbledon in the Men's Doubles with Louis Greig in 1926, losing in the first round.[31] He developed an interest in working conditions, and was president of the Industrial Welfare Society. His series of annual summer camps for boys between 1921 and 1939 brought together boys from different social backgrounds.[32]\n\n\n\n## Marriage[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Wedding of Prince Albert and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon\n\n![](image)The Duke and Duchess of York (centre, reading programmes) at Eagle Farm Racecourse, Brisbane, Queensland, 1927\nIn a time when royalty were expected to marry fellow royalty, it was unusual that Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing a prospective wife. An infatuation with the already-married Australian socialite Lady Loughborough came to an end in April 1920 when the King, with the promise of the dukedom of York, persuaded Albert to stop seeing her.[33] That year, he met for the first time since childhood Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the youngest daughter of the Earl and Countess of Strathmore. He became determined to marry her.[34] Elizabeth rejected his proposal twice, in 1921 and 1922, reportedly because she was reluctant to make the sacrifices necessary to become a member of the royal family.[35] In the words of Lady Strathmore, Albert would be \"made or marred\" by his choice of wife. After a protracted courtship, Elizabeth agreed to marry him.[36]\n\n\nAlbert and Elizabeth were married on 26 April 1923 in Westminster Abbey. Albert's marriage to someone not of royal birth was considered a modernising gesture.[37] The newly formed British Broadcasting Company wished to record and broadcast the event on radio, but the Abbey Chapter vetoed the idea (although the Dean, Herbert Edward Ryle, was in favour).[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)On the cover of *Time*, January 1925\nFrom December 1924 to April 1925, the Duke and Duchess toured Kenya, Uganda, and the Sudan, travelling via the Suez Canal and Aden. During the trip, they both went big-game hunting.[39]\n\n\nBecause of his stutter, Albert dreaded public speaking.[40] After his closing speech at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on 31 October 1925, one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners,[41] he began to see Lionel Logue, an Australian-born speech therapist. The Duke and Logue practised breathing exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently.[42] Subsequently, he was able to speak with less hesitation.[43] With his delivery improved, Albert opened the new Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, during a tour of the empire with the Duchess in 1927.[44] Their journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took them via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, Bertrand Clark, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.[45]\n\n\nThe Duke and Duchess had two children: Elizabeth (called \"Lilibet\" by the family, and the future Elizabeth II) who was born in 1926, and Margaret who was born in 1930. The close family lived at White Lodge, Richmond Park, and then at 145 Piccadilly, rather than one of the royal palaces.[46][47] In 1931, the Canadian prime minister, R. B. Bennett, considered Albert for Governor General of Canada—a proposal that King George V rejected on the advice of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, J. H. Thomas.[48]\n\n\n\n## Reign[edit]\n\n\n### Reluctant king[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Abdication of Edward VIII\n\nKing George V had severe reservations about Prince Edward, saying \"After I am dead, the boy will ruin himself in twelve months\" and \"I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne.\"[49] On 20 January 1936, George V died and Edward ascended the throne as King Edward VIII. In the Vigil of the Princes, Prince Albert and his three brothers (the new king, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, and Prince George, Duke of Kent) took a shift standing guard over their father's body as it lay in state, in a closed casket, in Westminster Hall.\n\n\nAs Edward was unmarried and had no children, Albert was the heir presumptive to the throne. Less than a year later, on 11 December 1936, Edward abdicated in order to marry Wallis Simpson, who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second. Edward had been advised by British prime minister Stanley Baldwin that he could not remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. He abdicated and Albert, though he had been reluctant to accept the throne, became king.[50] The day before the abdication, Albert went to London to see his mother, Queen Mary. He wrote in his diary, \"When I told her what had happened, I broke down and sobbed like a child.\"[51]\n\n\nOn the day of Edward's abdication, the Oireachtas, the parliament of the Irish Free State, removed all direct mention of the monarch from the Irish constitution. The next day, it passed the External Relations Act, which gave the monarch limited authority (strictly on the advice of the government) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and to be involved in the making of foreign treaties. The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.[52]\n\n\nAcross Britain, gossip spread that Albert was physically and psychologically incapable of being king. No evidence has been found to support the contemporaneous rumour that the government considered bypassing him, his children and his brother Prince Henry, in favour of their younger brother Prince George, Duke of Kent.[53] This seems to have been suggested on the grounds that Prince George was at that time the only brother with a son.[54]\n\n\n\n### Early reign[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Crown coin with George in profile, 1937\nAlbert assumed the regnal name \"George VI\" to emphasise continuity with his father and restore confidence in the monarchy.[55] The beginning of George VI's reign was taken up by questions surrounding his predecessor and brother, whose titles, style and position were uncertain. He had been introduced as \"His Royal Highness Prince Edward\" for the abdication broadcast,[56] but George VI felt that by abdicating and renouncing the succession, Edward had lost the right to bear royal titles, including \"Royal Highness\".[57] In settling the issue, George's first act as king was to confer upon his brother the title \"Duke of Windsor\" with the style \"Royal Highness\", but the letters patent creating the dukedom prevented any wife or children from bearing royal styles. George VI was forced to buy from Edward the royal residences of Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House, as these were private properties and did not pass to him automatically.[58] Three days after his accession, on his 41st birthday, he invested his wife, the new queen consort, with the Order of the Garter.[59]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cover of the 7 May 1937 edition of *Radio Times*, drawn by C. R. W. Nevinson, marking the first coronation to be broadcast, and partially televised, live\nGeorge VI's coronation at Westminster Abbey took place on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation. In a break with tradition, his mother Queen Mary attended the ceremony in a show of support for her son.[60] There was no Durbar held in Delhi for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost would have been a burden to the Government of India.[61] Rising Indian nationalism made the welcome that the royal party would have received likely to be muted at best,[62] and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before the Second World War. Two overseas tours were undertaken, to France and to North America, both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war.[63]\n\n\nThe growing likelihood of war in Europe dominated the early reign of George VI. The King was constitutionally bound to support British prime minister Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler.[11][64] When the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the Munich Agreement in 1938, they invited him to appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with them. This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional, as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family.[11] While broadly popular among the general public, Chamberlain's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the House of Commons, which led historian and politician John Grigg to describe George's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as \"the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century\".[65]\n\n\n\n![](image)Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt with King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, on the USS *Potomac*, 9 June 1939\nIn May and June 1939, the King and Queen toured Canada and the United States; it was the first visit of a reigning British monarch to North America, although George had been to Canada prior to his accession. From Ottawa, George and Elizabeth were accompanied by Canadian prime minister Mackenzie King,[66] to present themselves in North America as King and Queen of Canada.[67][68] Both Mackenzie King and the Canadian governor general, Lord Tweedsmuir, hoped that George's presence in Canada would demonstrate the principles of the Statute of Westminster 1931, which gave full sovereignty to the British Dominions. On 19 May, George personally accepted and approved the Letter of Credence of the new U.S. ambassador to Canada, Daniel Calhoun Roper; gave royal assent to nine parliamentary bills; and ratified two international treaties with the Great Seal of Canada. The official royal tour historian, Gustave Lanctot, wrote \"the Statute of Westminster had assumed full reality\" and George gave a speech emphasising \"the free and equal association of the nations of the Commonwealth\".[69]\n\n\nThe trip was intended to soften the strong isolationist tendencies among the North American public with regard to the developing tensions in Europe. Although the aim of the tour was mainly political, to shore up Atlantic support for the United Kingdom in any future war, the King and Queen were enthusiastically received by the public.[70] The fear that George would be compared unfavourably to his predecessor was dispelled.[71] They visited the 1939 New York World's Fair and stayed with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House and at his private estate at Hyde Park, New York.[72] A strong bond of friendship was forged between Roosevelt and the royal couple during the tour, which had major significance in the relations between the United States and the United Kingdom through the ensuing war years.[73][74]\n\n\n\n### Second World War[edit]\n\n\n![](image)King George VI, Queen Elizabeth, and Princess Elizabeth with RAF personnel during World War II\nFollowing the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, the United Kingdom and the self-governing Dominions other than Ireland declared war on Nazi Germany.[75] The King and Queen resolved to stay in London, despite German bombing raids. They officially stayed in Buckingham Palace throughout the war, although they usually spent nights at Windsor Castle.[76] The first night of the Blitz on London, on 7 September 1940, killed about one thousand civilians, mostly in the East End.[77] On 13 September, the couple narrowly avoided death when two German bombs exploded in a courtyard at Buckingham Palace while they were there.[78] In defiance, Elizabeth declared: \"I am glad we have been bombed. It makes me feel we can look the East End in the face.\"[79] The royal family were portrayed as sharing the same dangers and deprivations as the rest of the country. They were subject to British rationing restrictions, and U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt remarked on the rationed food served and the limited bathwater that was permitted during a stay at the unheated and boarded-up Palace.[80] In August 1942, the King's brother, the Duke of Kent, was killed on active service.[81]\n\n\n\n![](image)With Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery (right), near the front lines in the Netherlands, October 1944\nIn 1940, Winston Churchill replaced Neville Chamberlain as prime minister, though personally George would have preferred to appoint Lord Halifax.[82] After the King's initial dismay over Churchill's appointment of Lord Beaverbrook to the Cabinet, he and Churchill developed \"the closest personal relationship in modern British history between a monarch and a Prime Minister\".[83] Every Tuesday for four and a half years from September 1940, the two men met privately for lunch to discuss the war in secret and with frankness.[84] George related much of what the two discussed in his diary, which is the only extant first-hand account of these conversations.[85]\n\n\nThroughout the war, George and Elizabeth provided morale-boosting visits throughout the United Kingdom, visiting bomb sites, munitions factories, and troops. George visited military forces abroad in France in December 1939, North Africa and Malta in June 1943, Normandy in June 1944, southern Italy in July 1944, and the Low Countries in October 1944.[86] Their high public profile and apparently indefatigable determination secured their place as symbols of national resistance.[87] At a social function in 1944, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Field Marshal Alan Brooke, revealed that every time he met Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, he thought Montgomery was after his job. George replied: \"You should worry, when I meet him, I always think he's after mine!\"[88]\n\n\nIn 1945, crowds shouted \"We want the King!\" in front of Buckingham Palace during the Victory in Europe Day celebrations. In an echo of Chamberlain's appearance, the King invited Churchill to appear with the royal family on the balcony to public acclaim.[89] In January 1946, George addressed the United Nations at its first assembly, which was held in London, and reaffirmed \"our faith in the equal rights of men and women and of nations great and small\".[90]\n\n\n\n### Empire to Commonwealth[edit]\n\n\n![](image)With Clement Attlee (left) at Buckingham Palace, July 1945\nGeorge VI's reign saw the acceleration of the dissolution of the British Empire. The Statute of Westminster 1931 had already acknowledged the evolution of the Dominions into separate sovereign states. The process of transformation from an empire to a voluntary association of independent states, known as the Commonwealth, gathered pace after the Second World War.[91] During the ministry of Clement Attlee, British India became the two independent Dominions of India and Pakistan in August 1947.[92] George relinquished the title of Emperor of India,[93] and became King of India and King of Pakistan instead. In late April 1949, the Commonwealth leaders issued the London Declaration, which laid the foundation of the modern Commonwealth and recognised George as Head of the Commonwealth.[94][95][96] In January 1950, he ceased to be King of India when it became a republic. He remained King of Pakistan until his death. Other countries left the Commonwealth, such as Burma in January 1948, Palestine (divided between Israel and the Arab states) in May 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in 1949.[97]\n\n\nIn 1947, George and his family toured southern Africa.[98] The prime minister of the Union of South Africa, Jan Smuts, was facing an election and hoped to make political capital out of the visit.[99] George was appalled, however, when instructed by the South African government to shake hands only with whites,[100] and referred to his South African bodyguards as \"the Gestapo\".[101] Despite the tour, Smuts lost the election the following year, and the new government instituted a strict policy of racial segregation.\n\n\n\n## Illness and death[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Death and state funeral of George VI\n\nThe stress of the war had taken its toll on George's health,[102][103] made worse by his heavy smoking,[104] and subsequent development of lung cancer among other ailments, including arteriosclerosis and Buerger's disease. A planned tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed after George developed an arterial blockage in his right leg, which threatened the loss of the leg and was treated with a right lumbar sympathectomy in March 1949.[105] His elder daughter and heir presumptive, Elizabeth, took on more royal duties as her father's health deteriorated. The delayed tour was re-organised, with Princess Elizabeth and her husband, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, taking the place of the King and Queen.\n\n\nGeorge was well enough to open the Festival of Britain in May 1951, but on 4 June it was announced that he would need immediate and complete rest for the next four weeks, despite the arrival of Haakon VII of Norway the following afternoon for an official visit.[106] On 23 September 1951, he underwent a surgical operation where his entire left lung was removed by Clement Price Thomas after a malignant tumour was found.[107] In October 1951, Elizabeth and Philip went on a month-long tour of Canada; the trip had been delayed for a week due to George's illness. At the State Opening of Parliament in November, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Simonds, read the King's speech from the throne.[108] The King's Christmas broadcast of 1951 was recorded in sections, and then edited together.[109]\n\n\nOn 31 January 1952, despite advice from those close to him, George went to London Airport[e] to see Elizabeth and Philip off on their tour to Australia via Kenya. It was his last public appearance. Six days later, at 07:30 GMT on the morning of 6 February, he was found dead in bed at Sandringham House in Norfolk.[111] He had died in the night from a coronary thrombosis at the age of 56.[112] His daughter flew back to Britain from Kenya as Queen Elizabeth II.[113]\n\n\nFrom 9 February George's coffin rested in St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham, before lying in state at Westminster Hall from 11 February.[114] His funeral took place at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on the 15th.[115] He was interred initially in the Royal Vault until he was transferred to the King George VI Memorial Chapel inside St George's on 26 March 1969.[116] In 2002, fifty years after his death, the remains of his widow, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and the ashes of his younger daughter, Princess Margaret, who both died that year, were interred in the chapel alongside him.[117] In 2022, the remains of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, were also interred in the chapel.[118]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cultural depictions of George VI\n\n![](image)Statue by William McMillan (1955) at Carlton House Terrace, Westminster\nIn the words of Labour Member of Parliament (MP) George Hardie, the abdication crisis of 1936 did \"more for republicanism than fifty years of propaganda\".[119] George VI wrote to his brother Edward that in the aftermath of the abdication he had reluctantly assumed \"a rocking throne\" and tried \"to make it steady again\".[120] He became king at a point when public faith in the monarchy was at a low ebb. During his reign, his people endured the hardships of war, and imperial power was eroded. However, as a dutiful family man and by showing personal courage, he succeeded in restoring the popularity of the monarchy.[121][122]\n\n\nThe George Cross and the George Medal were founded at the King's suggestion during the Second World War to recognise acts of exceptional civilian bravery.[123] He bestowed the George Cross on the entire \"island fortress of Malta\" in 1943.[124] He was posthumously awarded the Order of Liberation by the French government in 1960, one of only two people (the other being Churchill in 1958) to be awarded the medal after 1946.[125]\n\n\nColin Firth won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as George VI in the 2010 film *The King's Speech*.[126]\n\n\n\n\n## Titles, honours and arms[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of titles and honours of George VI\n\nAs Duke of York, Albert bore the royal arms of the United Kingdom differenced with a label of three points argent, the centre point bearing an anchor azure—a difference earlier awarded to his father, George V, when he was Duke of York, and then later awarded to his grandson Prince Andrew, Duke of York. As king, he bore the royal arms undifferenced.[127]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nCoat of arms as Duke of York\n![](image)\nCoat of arms as King of the United Kingdom\n![](image)\nCoat of arms in Scotland\n![](image)\nCoat of arms in Canada\n\n## Issue[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Name | Birth | Death | Marriage | Children\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Date | Spouse\n |\n| Elizabeth II | 21 April 1926 | 8 September 2022 | 20 November 1947\n | Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh | Charles IIIAnne, Princess RoyalPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkPrince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh |\n| Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon | 21 August 1930 | 9 February 2002 | 6 May 1960Divorced 11 July 1978 | Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon | David Armstrong-Jones, 2nd Earl of SnowdonLady Sarah Chatto |\n\n\n## Ancestry[edit]\n\n\n| Ancestors of George VI[128] |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 8.

He ascended to the throne shortly after his 18th birthday. Until he was surpassed by Elizabeth II on 9 May 2022, his reign had been the longest precisely documented tenure of any European monarch since antiquity in which a regent (that is, a regent serving in place of an underage sovereign) was never employed.[1] Although his mother acted as his regent from 10 February 1859 to November 1860,[2][3] she was not the regent for a minor, but was appointed by her son to fulfil his duties because he wished to finish his education before he began his rule.\n\n\n\n## Law and reform[edit]\n\n\nIn 1862, Johann II issued Liechtenstein's first constitution, which was heavily influenced by the likes of Vorarlberg.[4] After World War I and due to significant popular demand, Johann II granted a new constitution, which was ratified on 5 October 1921. It granted considerable political rights to common Liechtensteiners and made the principality a constitutional monarchy.[5] The constitution has survived but with revisions, most notably in 2003.[6]\n\n\n\n## Foreign affairs[edit]\n\n\nLiechtenstein left the German Confederation in 1866. Not long afterward, the Liechtenstein Army was abolished as it was regarded as an unnecessary expense.\n\n\n\n![](image)Portrait by John Quincy Adams, 1908\nIn 1867 Alexander II of Russia had offered Johann to purchase Russian Alaska, but he refused as he believed the territory was useless.[7][8]\n\n\nJohann II somewhat cooled relations with Liechtenstein's traditional ally, Austria-Hungary and its successor states, to forge closer relations with Switzerland, particularly after World War I. Liechtenstein was neutral during the war, which broke Liechtenstein's alliance with Austria-Hungary and led it to go into a customs union with Switzerland. In 1924, late in Johann's reign, the Swiss franc became Liechtenstein's official currency.[9]\n\n\n\n## Patron of arts[edit]\n\n\nJohann II, an outstanding art connoisseur and a generous patron, added much to the Liechtenstein Princely Collections. Although considered a prominent patron of the arts and sciences during his long reign,[10] Johann II was also considered to be rather unsociable and did not participate in social events. Rarely did he show up in his magnificent Vienna residences, Liechtenstein City Palace and Liechtenstein Garden Palace. He also never assumed any tasks of the Austrian politics or the Austrian military. And he never married or had any children, like several other members of his family.[11]\n\n\nFrom 1884 he had Liechtenstein Castle rebuilt, the ancestral seat of his family near Vienna which had fallen into ruins. Between 1905 and 1920, Schloss Vaduz was renovated and expanded. Like all of his ancestors he never lived in the principality of Liechtenstein, but on the vast Austrian and Moravian estates of the House of Liechtenstein which were 7.5 times the total area of the Principality itself. His main home were the castles of Lednice and Valtice (German names: Eisgrub and Feldsberg) in what is today the Czech Republic (then part of Austria-Hungary with the Austrian-Bohemian border running through the park between the two castles). The local administration of the Principality was overseen by a governor, and the government office was located at the prince's seat. It was not until the German occupation of the Czech lands at the beginning of World War II that the residence was moved to Vaduz. \n\n\n\n## Declining health and death[edit]\n\n\nAs Johann entered his later years his eyesight began to decline rapidly and on 12 November 1928 he underwent surgery to remove cataracts.[12] He died on 11 February 1929 and was succeeded by his younger brother Franz I.[13][14]\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order, *1860* (Kingdom of Hanover)[15]\n* ![](image) Knight of the Golden Fleece, *1862* (Austrian Empire)[16]\n* ![](image) Grand Cross of St. Stephen, *1896* (Austria-Hungary)[17]\n* ![](image) Knight of St. Hubert, *1882* (Kingdom of Bavaria)[18]\n* ![](image) Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion (Sovereign Military Order of Malta)[19]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Worldstatesmen.org – Liechtenstein.

Reigning from 1946 until his death in 2016,[6] he is the third-longest verified reigning sovereign monarch in world history after King Louis XIV and Queen Elizabeth II, reigning for 70 years and 126 days.[7][8] His reign of over 70 years is the longest reign of any Thai monarch, and the longest native rule of any Asian sovereign.\n\n\n*Forbes* estimated Bhumibol's fortune – including property and investments managed by the Crown Property Bureau, a body that is neither private nor government-owned (assets managed by the Bureau were owned by the crown as an institution, not by the monarch as an individual)[9]– to be US$30 billion in 2010, and he headed the magazine's list of the \"world's richest royals\" from 2008 to 2013.[10][11][12] In May 2014, Bhumibol's wealth was again listed as US$30 billion.[13]\n\n\nAfter a period of deteriorating health which left him hospitalized on several occasions, Bhumibol died on 13 October 2016 in Siriraj Hospital.[14] He was highly revered by the people in Thailand[15][16] – some saw him as close to divine.[17][18] Notable political activists and Thai citizens who criticized the king or the institution of monarchy were often forced into exile or to suffer frequent imprisonments,[19] yet many cases were dropped before being proceeded or were eventually given royal pardon.[20] His cremation was held on 26 October 2017 at the royal crematorium at Sanam Luang.[21] His son, Maha Vajiralongkorn, succeeded him as King.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)King Bhumibol (right) with his brother, King Ananda Mahidol in 1938\nBhumibol was born at Cambridge Hospital (now Mount Auburn Hospital) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, on 5 December 1927.[22] He was the youngest son of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, the Prince of Songkla, and his commoner wife Mom Sangwan (later Princess Srinagarindra, the Princess Mother). His father was enrolled in the public health program at Harvard University, which is why Bhumibol was the only monarch to be born in the US.[23]: 46–47 Bhumibol had an older sister, Princess Galyani Vadhana, and an older brother, Prince Ananda Mahidol.\n\n\nBhumibol came to Thailand in 1928, after his father obtained a certificate from Harvard. His father died of kidney failure in September 1929, when Bhumibol was less than two years old.[23]: 62 He briefly attended Mater Dei school in Bangkok, but in 1933 his mother took her family to Switzerland, where he continued his education at the École nouvelle de la Suisse romande in Lausanne. In 1934 Bhumibol was given his first camera, which ignited his lifelong enthusiasm for photography.[23]: 67 When Bhumibol's childless uncle Prajadhipok abdicated in 1935, his nine-year-old brother Ananda Mahidol became King Rama VIII. However, the family remained in Switzerland and the affairs of the head of state were conducted by a regency council. They returned to Thailand for only two months in 1938. In 1942, Bhumibol became a jazz enthusiast, and started to play the saxophone, a passion that he kept throughout his life.[23]: 73–74 He received the *baccalauréat des lettres* (high-school diploma with a major in French literature, Latin, and Greek) from the Gymnase Classique Cantonal de Lausanne, and by 1945 had begun studying sciences at the University of Lausanne, when World War II ended and the family was able to return to Thailand.[22]\n\n\n\n## Succession and marriage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)King Ananda Mahidol returned from Switzerland to Thailand, during an official ceremony in January 1946 in Bangkok, with Pridi Banomyong, Srinagarindra, and Prince Bhumibol which was not long before the King's death.\nBhumibol ascended the throne following the death by gunshot wound of his brother, King Ananda Mahidol, on 9 June 1946, under circumstances that remain unclear. While an initial government statement stated that Ananda had accidentally shot himself,[24]: 76–77 an investigation committee ruled this was virtually impossible.[24]: 87 Three palace aides (Chit Singhaseni, But Patthamasarin, and Chaliao Pathumrot) were eventually convicted of regicide, and were executed by firing squad on 17 February 1955, after their appeals for clemency were rejected by Bhumibol.[25]: 92[24]: 78 A third possibility, that Bhumibol accidentally shot his brother while the brothers played with their pistols, was never officially considered.[24]: 77–78[26]\n\n\nBhumibol succeeded his brother, but returned to Switzerland before the end of the 100-day mourning period. Despite his interest in science and technology, he changed his major and enrolled in law and political science to prepare for his duties as head of state. His uncle, Rangsit, Prince of Chainat, was appointed Prince Regent. In Bhumibol's name, Prince Rangsit acknowledged a military coup that overthrew the government of Thamrongnawasawat in November 1947.[24]: 88 The regent also signed the 1949 constitution, which returned to the monarchy many of the powers it had lost by the 1932 Revolution.[24]: 91–93\n\n\nIn December 1946, the Siamese government allocated several hundred thousand dollars for the ceremonial cremation of the remains of the late King Ananda, a necessary preliminary to the coronation of Bhumibol who was required by religious custom to light the funeral pyre. Unsettled conditions in 1947 following a coup d'état resulted in a postponement, and court astrologers determined that 2 March 1949 was the most auspicious date.[27]\n\n\nWhile doing his degree in Switzerland, Bhumibol visited Paris frequently. It was in Paris that he first met Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara, daughter of the Thai ambassador to France (Nakkhatra Mangala) and a great-granddaughter of King Chulalongkorn and thus a cousin of Bhumibol. She was then 15 years old and training to be a concert pianist.[27][28]\n\n\nOn 4 October 1948, while Bhumibol was driving a Fiat Topolino on the Geneva-Lausanne road, he collided with the rear of a braking truck 10 km outside Lausanne. He injured his back, suffered paralysis in half of his face and incurred cuts on his face that cost him the sight of his right eye.[24]: 104[29] Both the royal cremation and coronation had to be postponed once more.[27] While he was hospitalised in Lausanne, Sirikit visited him frequently. She met his mother, who asked her to continue her studies nearby so that Bhumibol could get to know her better. Bhumibol selected for her a boarding school in Lausanne, Riante Rive.[30] A quiet engagement in Lausanne followed on 19 July 1949, and they were married on 28 April 1950, just a week before his coronation. Their wedding was described by *The New York Times* as \"the shortest, simplest royal wedding ever held in the land of gilded elephants and white umbrellas\". The ceremony was performed by Bhumibol's ageing grandmother, Savang Vadhana.[27]\n\n\nBhumibol and Sirikit have four children:\n\n\n\n* (Formerly HRH) Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya, born 5 April 1951 in Lausanne, Switzerland; married Peter Ladd Jensen (now divorced), and has two daughters. Her son, Bhumi Jensen, was killed in the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.[31][32]\n* King Maha Vajiralongkorn (Rama X), born 28 July 1952; married Mom Luang Soamsawali Kitiyakara (later divorced and became HRH the Princess Niece); one daughter. Then married Yuvadhida Polpraserth (later divorced); four sons and a daughter. Third marriage was to Srirasmi Suwadee (now divorced); one son. Fourth and current marriage is to Suthida Tidjai.\n* HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, The Princess Royal, born 2 April 1955; never married, no issue\n* HRH Princess Chulabhorn Walailak, born 4 July 1957; married Virayudh Tishyasarin (now divorced); two daughters\n\n\n## Coronation and titles[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Coronation of Bhumibol Adulyadej\n\n![](image)On 31 October 1956, the monk Bhumibalo visited the Government House to ask for alms. Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram is on the right.\nFile:King Bhumibol coronation 2.jpgCoronation portrait of King Bhumibol Adulyadej\nAfter presiding over the long-delayed, ceremonial cremation of his brother Ananda Mahidol, Bhumibol was crowned King of Thailand on 5 May 1950 in the Phaisan Thaksin Throne Hall in the Grand Palace in Bangkok. It was the first coronation ceremony of a Thai sovereign to rule under the system of constitutional monarchy.[27] During the ceremony, he pledged that he would \"reign with righteousness for the benefit and happiness of the Siamese people\".[c][33] Notable elements associated with the coronation included the Bahadrabith Throne [th] beneath the Great White Umbrella of State and royal regalia and utensils.[34]\n\n\nIn 1950 on Coronation Day, Bhumibol's consort was made queen (Somdej Phra Boromarajini). The date of his coronation is celebrated each 5 May in Thailand as Coronation Day, a public holiday.\n\n\nThe royal couple spent their honeymoon at Hua Hin before they returned to Switzerland, where the king completed his university studies. They returned to Thailand in 1951.[27]\n\n\nFollowing the death of his grandmother Queen Savang Vadhana, Bhumibol entered a 15-day monkhood (22 October 1956 – 5 November 1956) at Wat Bowonniwet, as is customary for Buddhist males on the death of elder relatives. He was ordained by the Supreme Patriarch on 22 October 1956 at the Royal Chapel of the Emerald Buddha in the Grand Palace.[27][35] At this time, Sirikit was appointed his regent. She was later appointed Queen Regent (Somdej Phra Boromarajininat) in recognition of this.\n\n\nAlthough Bhumibol was sometimes referred to as King Rama IX in English, Thais referred to him as *Nai Luang*[d] or *Phra Chao Yu Hua*,[e] which translated to \"the King\" and \"Lord Upon our Heads\", respectively. He was also called *Chao Chiwit* (\"Lord of Life\").[15] Formally, he was referred to as *Phrabat Somdet Phra Chao Yu Hua*[f] or, in legal documents, *Phrabat Somdet Phra Paraminthara Maha Bhumibol Adulyadej*,[g] and in English as \"His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej\". He signed his name as ภูมิพลอดุลยเดช ป.ร. (Bhumibol Adulyadej Por Ror, the Thai equivalent of \"Bhumibol Adulyadej R[ex])\".\n\n\n\n## Role in Thai politics[edit]\n\n\nIn 1957, a military coup overthrew the government of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram with allegations of *lèse-majesté*,[24]: 136–137[36] corruption and manipulation of the election held earlier that year.[36]: 146–148 This began a new and long-lasting relationship between the monarch and military,[37] leading some to perceive that the king condones the Thammasat University massacre in defense of his throne, and support a series of military dictatorships.[24][38] However, during his interview given to the BBC in 1979, the king reiterated that the monarchy should remain impartial and be in peaceful co-existence with everybody.[23]: 139–141 Bhumibol invited public criticism in a 2005 speech,[39] but the *lèse majesté* laws have not been revoked by the Thai parliament yet.\n\n\n\n### Plaek Phibunsongkhram era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)King Bhumibol, together with Queen Sirikit, attended the Red Cross Fair in Bangkok on 9 November 1956\n![](image)King Bhumibol with Queen Sirikit at Nakhon Si Thammarat in 1959\nIn the early years of his reign, during the government of military dictator Plaek Phibunsongkhram, Bhumibol had no real political power and was little more than a ceremonial figure under the military-dominated government. In August 1957, six months after parliamentary elections, General Sarit Thanarat accused the government of Field Marshal Phibunsongkhram of *lèse-majesté* due to its conduct of the 2,500th anniversary celebration of Buddhism.[24]: 129–130, 136–137[36] On 16 September 1957, Phibunsongkhram went to Bhumibol to seek support for his government.[40] Bhumibol advised the field marshal to resign to avoid a coup. Phibunsongkhram refused. That evening, Sarit Thanarat seized power. Two hours later Bhumibol imposed martial law throughout the kingdom.[41] Bhumibol issued a proclamation appointing Sarit as \"military defender of the capital\" without anyone countersigning the proclamation. It included the following:[42]\n\n\n\n\n> Whereas it appears that the public administration by the government under the premiership of Field Marshal P. Phibunsongkhram is untrustworthy, and that the government could not maintain the public order; and whereas the military, led by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, has successfully taken over the public administration and now acts as the Military Defender of the Capital; now, therefore, I do hereby appoint Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat as the Military Defender of the Capital, and command that all the citizens shall remain calm whilst all the government officers shall serve the orders issued by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat. This Proclamation shall come into force immediately. Done this 16th Day of September, Buddhist Era 2500 (1957).[42]\n> \n> \n\n Sarit later admitted in a rare interview with foreign correspondent that the king had no involvement and did not acknowledge anything about the coup until it had been done successfully.[43]\n\n\n### Sarit Thanarat era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bhumibol addresses a joint session of the United States Congress, 29 June 1960\n![](image)King Bhumibol in Royal Thai Army dress in 1960 and is decorated with the Honourable Order of Rama and Legion of Merit\n![](image)King Bhumibol with President Richard Nixon in 1969\nDuring Sarit's dictatorship, the monarchy was revitalised. Bhumibol attended public ceremonies, toured the provinces and patronised development projects, he also visited the United States in June 1960, addressing Congress, and many countries in Europe, including a visit to Rome, hosted by PM Giovanni Gronchi, in September 1960.\n\n\nUnder Sarit, the practice of crawling in front of royalty during audiences, banned by King Chulalongkorn, was revived in certain situations and the royal-sponsored Thammayut Nikaya order was revitalised. For the first time since the absolute monarchy was overthrown, a king was conveyed up the Chao Phraya River in a Royal Barge Procession to offer robes at temples.[44][45]\n\n\nOther disused ceremonies from the classical period of the Chakri Dynasty, such as the royally patronised ploughing ceremony (Thai: พิธีพืชมงคล), were also revived.[46] Bhumibol's birthday (5 December) was declared the national day, replacing the previous national day, the anniversary of the Siamese revolution of 1932 (24 June).[47] Upon Sarit's death on 8 December 1963, an unprecedented 21 days of mourning were declared in the palace. A royal five-tier umbrella shaded his body while it lay in state. Long-time royal adviser Phraya Srivisaravacha later noted that no Prime Minister ever had such an intimate relationship with Bhumibol as Sarit.[48]\n\n\nBhumibol biographer Paul Handley, in *The King Never Smiles*, writes that the dictator Sarit was Bhumibol's tool. Political scientist Thak Chaloemtiarana writes that Sarit used Bhumibol in order to build his own credibility.[49][50]\n\n\n\n### Thammasat University massacre[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Thammasat University massacre\n\nFollowing Sarit's death General Thanom Kittikachorn rose to power to lead Thailand's military dictatorship, ultimately challenged by the 1973 Thai popular uprising. Bhumibol initially asked student protestors to disband. When police attacked and killed dozens of students, sparking protest riots, Bhumibol announced general Thanom's resignation and departure from Thailand.[51]\nAccording to William Stevenson, the king had asked the three tyrants to avoid bloodshed, although the three tyrants had agreed, they later changed their minds. Eventually, it led to the incidents of October 1973.[52]\n\n\nBhumibol distanced himself from the Thai military after Thanom's fall. Political events in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos brought powerful guerrilla and communist movements into power or prominence, which threatened the Thai monarchy and political establishment. Fearing unrest, Bhumibol began to court the military in 1975, visiting camps throughout the country, and publicly warning of internal and external threats.[38]: 87 At this time, Bhumibol increasingly cultivated far-right militias and paramilitary forces, including the Red Gaurs and the Village Scouts, warning that students and political dissidents planned to bring communists to power in Thailand.[24]: 232–9 Finally, Bhumibol provoked outrage among students and legal groups by inviting general Thanom back into the country.\n\n\nThe ensuing chaos was used as a pretext for a military coup, which Bhumibol backed and described as a manifestation of the people's will.[38]: 90–1 The event that catalyzed the coup was the Thammasat University massacre, carried out in the name of defending Bhumibol's throne.[24]: 9 The victorious military junta submitted three names to the king as possible premiers: Deputy President of the king's Privy Council Prakob Hutasingh [th], right-wing Bangkok Governor Thamnoon Thien-ngern [th], and staunchly anti-communist Supreme Court judge Thanin Kraivichien.[38]: 90–1[53] Bhumibol chose Thanin as the most suitable premier, leading student protesters to flee to join the communists in the jungle. Thanin was overthrown in a military coup in October 1977 led by General Kriangsak Chamanan.\n\n\n\n### Prem Tinsulanonda era[edit]\n\n\nKriangsak was succeeded in 1980 by the popular Army Commander-in-Chief, General Prem Tinsulanonda, who later became the Privy Council President.\n\n\nBhumibol's refusal to endorse military coups in 1981 (the April Fool's Day coup) and 1985 (the Share Rebellion) ultimately led to the victory of forces loyal to the government, despite some violence – including, in 1981, the seizure of Bangkok by rebel forces. The coups led many to believe that Bhumibol had misjudged Thai society and that his credibility as an impartial mediator between various political and military factions had been compromised.[54][55][56]\n\n\nFollowing the death of Emperor Hirohito of Japan in 1989, he overtook the distinction as the world's longest-reigning living monarch.[57]\n\n\n\n### Crisis of 1992[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Royal intervention on the night of 20 May. Chamlong Srimuang (left) and Suchinda Kraprayoon (middle) submit to the King (seated)\nMain article: Black May (1992)\n\nIn 1992, Bhumibol played a key role in Thailand's transition to a democratic system. The 1991 Thai coup d'état on 23 February returned Thailand to military dictatorship. After a general election in 1992, the majority parties invited General Suchinda Kraprayoon, a leader of the coup group, to be prime minister. This caused much dissent, which escalated into demonstrations called Black May that led to a large number of deaths when the military was brought in to control protesters. The situation became increasingly critical as police and military forces clashed with protesters. Violence and riots spread to many areas of the capital with rumours of a rift among the armed forces.[58]\n\n\nAmidst the fear of civil war, Bhumibol intervened. He summoned Suchinda and the leader of the pro-democracy movement, retired Major General Chamlong Srimuang, to a televised audience, and urged them to find a peaceful resolution. At the height of the crisis, the sight of both men appearing together on their knees (in accordance with royal protocol) made a strong impression on the nation. Bhumibol then signed Suchinda's amnesty decree that applied to both sides of the conflict, with the reason to protect security and unity of the country.[59] Suchinda resigned soon afterwards.\n\n\nIt was one of the few occasions in which Bhumibol directly and publicly intervened in a political conflict. A general election was held shortly afterward, leading to a civilian government.[60]\n\n\n\n### Crisis of 2005–2006 and the September 2006 coup[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2005–06 Thai political crisis, Finland Plot, and 2006 Thai coup d'état\n\n#### Background to the coup[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2005–06 Thai political crisis\n\nWeeks before the April 2006 legislative election, the Democrat Party-led opposition and the People's Alliance for Democracy petitioned Bhumibol to appoint a replacement prime minister and cabinet. Demands for royal intervention were met with much criticism from the public. Bhumibol, in a speech on 26 April 2006, responded, \"Asking for a Royally-appointed prime minister is undemocratic. It is, pardon me, a mess. It is irrational\".[61]\n\n\nAfter publicly claiming victory in the boycotted April parliamentary elections, Thaksin Shinawatra had a private audience with the king. A few hours later, Thaksin appeared on national television to announce that he would be taking a break from politics. Due to the election result, Bhumibol took the unprecedented step of calling the elections undemocratic.[62]\n\n\nIn May 2006, the Sondhi Limthongkul-owned *Manager Daily* newspaper published a series of articles describing the \"Finland Plot\", alleging that Thaksin and former members of the Communist Party of Thailand planned to overthrow the king and seize control of the nation. No evidence was ever produced to verify the existence of such a plot, and Thaksin and his Thai Rak Thai party vehemently denied the accusations and sued the accusers.\n\n\nIn a rare, televised speech to senior judges, Bhumibol requested the judiciary to take action to resolve the political crisis.[61] On 8 May 2006, the Constitutional Court invalidated the results of the April elections and ordered new elections scheduled for 15 October 2006.[63] The Criminal Court later jailed the Election Commissioners.[64][65]\n\n\nOn 14 July 2006, Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda addressed graduating cadets of the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, telling them that the Thai military must serve the nation and the king—not the government.[66]\n\n\nOn 20 July, Bhumibol signed a royal decree endorsing new House elections for 15 October 2006. In an unprecedented act, the King wrote a note on the royal decree calling for a clean and fair election. That very day, Bhumibol underwent spinal surgery.[67]\n\n\n\n#### The coup[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2006 Thai coup d'état\n\nOn the evening of 19 September, the Thai military overthrew the Thaksin government and seized control of Bangkok in a bloodless coup. The junta, led by the Sonthi Boonyaratglin, Commander of the Army, called itself the Council for Democratic Reform under the Constitutional Monarchy. It accused the deposed prime minister and his regime of crimes, including lèse majesté, and pledged its loyalty to Bhumibol. Martial law was declared, the constitution repealed and the October elections cancelled. Protests and political meetings were banned.[68]\n\n\nThe king's role in the coup was the subject of much speculation among Thai analysts and the international media, although publication of such speculation was banned in Thailand. The king had an audience with Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda at the same time that special forces troops were mobilised.[69] Anti-coup protesters claimed that Prem was the mastermind of the coup, although the military claimed otherwise and banned any discussion of the topic. In a BBC interview, Thitinan Pongsudhirak of Chulalongkorn University noted, \"This coup was nothing short of Thaksin versus the King ... He [the king] is widely seen as having implicitly endorsed the coup.\" In the same interview, social critic Sulak Sivaraksa claimed, \"Without his [the king's] involvement, the coup would have been impossible.\" Sulak added that the king is \"very skillful. He never becomes obviously involved. If this coup goes wrong, Sonthi will get the blame, but whatever happens, the King will only get praise.\"[70] On Saturday, 23 September 2006, the junta warned it would \"urgently retaliate against foreign reporters whose coverage has been deemed insulting to the monarchy.\"[71] Prem did help secure the appointment of Surayud Chulanont, another member of the King's Privy Council, as Premier, and allegedly had a say in the appointment of Surayud's Cabinet. Critics claimed the cabinet was full of \"Prem's boys\".[72][73][74]\n\n\nOn 20 April 2009, Thaksin claimed in an interview with the *Financial Times* that Bhumibol had been briefed by Privy Councillors Prem Tinsulanonda and Surayud Chulanont about their plans to stage the 2006 coup. He claimed that General Panlop Pinmanee, a leader of the People's Alliance for Democracy, had told him of the briefing.[75][76] The Thai embassy in London denied Thaksin's claims.\n\n\n\n#### After the coup[edit]\n\n\nThe junta appointed a constitutional tribunal to rule on alleged polling fraud involving the Thai Rak Thai and Democrat political parties. Guilty rulings would have dissolved both parties, Thailand's largest and oldest, respectively, and banned the parties' leadership from politics for five years. The weeks leading up to the verdicts saw rising political tensions. On 24 May 2007, about a week before the scheduled verdict, Bhumibol gave a rare speech to the Supreme Administrative Court (the president of which is also a member of the constitutional tribunal). \"You have the responsibility to prevent the country from collapsing\", he warned them in the speech, which was shown on all national television channels simultaneously during the evening. \"The nation needs political parties ... In my mind, I have a judgment but I cannot say\", he said. \"Either way the ruling goes, it will be bad for the country, there will be mistakes\".[77][78][79] The tribunal later acquitted the Democrat Party, but dissolved the Thai Rak Thai Party and banned 111 of its executives from politics for five years.\n\n\nThe junta-appointed Constitution Drafting Assembly later tried to use the King in a propaganda campaign to increase public support for its widely criticised draft constitution. The CDA placed billboards saying \"Love the King. Care about the King. Vote in the referendum\" throughout northeast Thailand, where opposition to the junta was greatest.[80]\n\n\n\n### 2008 crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Thai political crisis\n\nThe military's constitution passed the referendum, and a general election was held in December 2007. The People's Power Party (PPP), consisting of many former Thai Rak Thai Party MPs and supporters, won the majority and formed a government.[81] The People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) refused to accept the election results and started protests, eventually laying siege to Government House, Don Mueang Airport, and Suvarnabhumi Airport. Although the PAD claimed they were defending the monarchy, Bhumibol remained silent. However, after a PAD supporter died in a clash with police, Queen Sirikit presided over her cremation. Princess Sirindhorn, when asked at a US press conference whether PAD was acting on behalf of the monarchy, replied, \"I don't think so. They do things for themselves.\"[82] Questioning and criticism over Bhumibol's role in the crisis increased, particularly from the international press.[83][84][85][86][87][88][89] \"It is more and more difficult for them to hold the illusion that the monarchy is universally adored\", says a Thai academic.[90]\n\n\nIn April 2008, Bhumibol appointed alleged coup plotter General Surayud Chulanont to the Privy Council of Thailand. In the weeks leading up to the 2011 general election, Bhumibol appointed Air Chief Marshal Chalit Pukbhasuk, a leader of the 2006 military coup, to his privy council.[91]\n\n\n\n### 2013–2014 crisis[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikisource has original text related to this article:\n**Proclamation on Appointment of Leader of the National Council for Peace and Order**\n\nAfter Prayut Chan-o-cha, Commander of the Royal Thai Army launched a coup d'état, the 12th since the country's first coup in 1932,[92] against the caretaker government, following six months of political crisis. On 24 May 2014, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) said Bhumibol had acknowledged the coup, but stopped short of describing the response as an endorsement.[93] However, on 26 May 2014 Bhumibol formally appointed General Prayut to run the country. In Thailand the monarchy is highly respected and royal endorsement was seen as legitimation of the takeover.[94]\n\n\nPaul Chambers said that the military is the only institution that can sustain the power of Bhumibol monarch, and Bhumibol gave legitimacy to the military and blessing each of the coups. Past two coups showed relationship between the military and the monarch.[95] Serhat Uenaldi said that Bhumibol helped kill off democracy since last 2006 coup by endorsed a military coup against the popular Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.[96]\n\n\n\n### Declining health[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This article has multiple issues.** Please help **improve it** or discuss these issues on the **talk page**. *(Learn how and when to remove these template messages)*\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

In 2011, it was revealed as part of WikiLeaks' leak of United States diplomatic cables that he had suffered from Parkinson's disease and depression.[101] He was diagnosed with diverticulitis in hospital in November 2011, and was treated for the condition in January 2012.[102] Bhumibol suffered minute subdural bleeding in the left frontal area of his brain for which he was treated in July 2012.[103] Bhumibol left the hospital in July 2013,[104] and travelled to Klai Kangwon Palace at Hua Hin on 2 August 2013,[105] but returned intermittently in the following years, most recently on 1 June 2015.[106] Bhumibol was too ill to appear for the public celebration of his birthday on 5 December 2015,[107] but made a televised appearance on 14 December, his first in several months.[108] The King temporarily left hospital to visit Chitralada Royal Villa on 11 January 2016 but returned later that day.[109]\n\n\nOn 1 October 2016, the palace released a bulletin stating that after recovering from a fever, King Bhumibol underwent tests that revealed a blood infection and an X-ray found inflammation on his left lung, along with water in his lungs.[110] He had been in kidney failure for some time and received dialysis.[111][112] By 9 October, he had been placed on a ventilator and doctors pronounced him \"not yet stable\".[113] Crowds of well-wishers, many dressed in pink symbolizing good health and luck, gathered outside Siriraj Hospital and the Grand Palace to offer prayers and support.[114]\n\n\nBy 12 October, the royal children had arrived at Siriraj Hospital and Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn had met with the prime minister.[115][116] There were some internal concerns about the succession of the crown prince, in that he was not perceived to be as well-respected as his father and it was speculated that some palace elites, responding to the people's admiration for Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, might try to position her to take the throne.[117][118]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Death and funeral of Bhumibol Adulyadej\n\n![](image)Bureau of the Royal Household announcement of King Bhumibol Adulyadej's death, 13 October 2016\nKing Bhumibol Adulyadej died at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand on 13 October 2016, at 15:52 local time, at the age of 88, as announced by the royal palace later that day.[6] The following day, his body was taken by motorcade to the Grand Palace for the customary bathing rite.[119] Thousands of the bereaved public lined the route, demonstrating their affection for their \"king of kings\". The royal procession arrived at the Grand Palace through Viset Chaisri Gate at 17:00. His only son and the next in line to rule the kingdom, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, presided over the bathing ritual at Phiman Rattaya Throne Hall.[120]\n\n\nA royal cremation ceremony took place over five days at the end of October 2017. The actual cremation, which was not broadcast on television, was held in the late evening of 26 October 2017.[121][122] Following cremation his ashes were taken to the Grand Palace and were enshrined at the Chakri Maha Phasat Throne Hall (royal remains), the Royal Cemetery at Wat Ratchabophit and the Wat Bowonniwet Vihara Royal Temple (royal ashes).[123] Following burial, the mourning period officially ended on midnight of 30 October 2017, after which Thais resumed wearing regular colours while they awaited the future coronation of King Vajiralongkorn, which was hosted between 4–6 May 2019.[124][125]\n\n\n\n## Royal powers[edit]\n\n\n### Constitutional powers[edit]\n\n\nFor a historical perspective on how Bhumibol's constitutional powers changed over time, see Constitutions of Thailand.\n\n![](image)King Bhumibol with Russian president Putin in 2003\n![](image)Bhumibol in a meeting with US president Barack Obama in 2012\nBhumibol retained enormous powers, partly because of his immense popularity and partly because his powers – although clearly defined in the Thai constitution – were often subject to conflicting interpretations. This was highlighted by the controversy surrounding the appointment of Jaruvan Maintaka as Auditor-General. Jaruvan had been appointed by The State Audit Commission, but in July 2004, the Constitutional Court ruled that her appointment was unconstitutional. Jaruvan refused to vacate her office without an explicit order from Bhumibol, on the grounds that she had previously been royally approved. When the Senate elected a replacement for Jaruvan, Bhumibol refused to approve him.[126] The Senate declined to vote to override Bhumibol's veto.[127] Finally in February 2006 the Audit Commission reinstated Jaruvan when it became clear from a memo from the Office of the King's Principal Private Secretary that King Bhumibol supported her appointment.\nBhumibol only vetoed legislation on rare occasions. In 1976, when the Parliament voted 149–19 to extend democratic elections down to district levels, Bhumibol refused to sign the law.[24]: 233 The Parliament refused to vote to overturn the King's veto. In 1954, Bhumibol vetoed parliamentary-approved land reform legislation twice before consenting to sign it.[24]: 126 The law limited the maximum land an individual could hold to 50 rai (80,000 square metres (860,000 sq ft)), at a time when the Crown Property Bureau was the kingdom's largest land-owner. The law was not enforced as General Sarit soon overthrew the elected government in a coup and repealed the law.\n\n\nBhumibol had the constitutional prerogative to pardon criminals, although there are several criteria for receiving a pardon, including age and remaining sentence. The 2006 pardoning of several convicted child rapists, including an Australian rapist and child pornographer, caused controversy.[128][129][130] However, under the Thai constitution, the king has the prerogative to grant pardons and all laws, royal rescripts, and royal commands relating to state affairs must be countersigned by a minister unless otherwise provided for in the constitution.\n\n\n\n### Network monarchy and extraconstitutional powers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Network monarchy\n\n![](image)City decoration in observance of King Bhumibol's birthday in Phitsanulok, Thailand\nSeveral academics outside Thailand, including Duncan McCargo and Federico Ferrara, noted the active but indirect political involvement of Bhumibol through a \"network monarchy\", whose most significant proxy is Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda. McCargo claimed that Bhumibol's conservative network worked behind the scenes to establish political influence in the 1990s, but was threatened by the landslide election victories of Thaksin Shinawatra in 2001 and 2005.[131] Ferrara claimed, shortly before the Thai Supreme Court delivered its verdict to seize Thaksin Shinawatra's assets, that the judiciary was a well-established part of Bhumibol's network and represented his main avenue to exercise extra-constitutional prerogatives despite having the appearance of being constitutional. He also noted how, in comparison to the Constitutional Court's 2001 acquittal of Thaksin, the judiciary was a much more important part of the \"network\" than it was in the past.[132]\n\n\nThe network's ability to exercise power is based partly on Bhumibol's popularity and strict control of Bhumibol's popular image. According to Jost Pachaly of the Heinrich Böll Foundation, Bhumibol \"plays an important role behind the scenes. But the role is difficult to assess because nothing is reported about it and no one really knows anything specific\", due to lese majeste laws forbidding discussion about Bhumibol's political activities.[133] Bhumibol's popularity was demonstrated following the 2003 Phnom Penh riots in Cambodia, when hundreds of Thai protesters, enraged by rumors that Cambodian rioters had stomped on photographs of Bhumibol, gathered outside the Cambodian embassy in Bangkok. Photographs of the stomping were not published in Thailand, but were available on the internet. The situation was resolved peacefully only when Police General Sant Sarutanonda told the crowd that he had received a call from royal secretary Arsa Sarasin conveying Bhumibol's request for calm. The crowd dispersed.[134]\n\n\n\n## Royal projects[edit]\n\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

This approach will prevent incurring mistakes and failures, and lead to the certain and complete achievement of the objectives.\n> \n> — Bhumibol's speech at Kasetsart University Commencement Ceremony, 19 July 1974.[135]\n> \n\n\nBhumibol was involved in many social and economic development projects. The nature of his involvement varied by political regime.[136]\n\n\nThe government of Plaek Phibunsongkhram (1951–1957) limited Bhumibol to a ceremonial role. During that period Bhumibol produced some films and operated a radio station from Chitlada Palace using personal funds.\n\n\nIn the military governments of Sarit Thanarat and his successors (1958–1980), Bhumibol was portrayed as the \"development King\" and the inspiration for the economic and political goals of the regime. Royally ordered projects were implemented under the financial and political support of the government, including projects in rural areas and communities under the influence of the Communist Party of Thailand. Bhumibol's visits to these projects were heavily promoted by the Sarit government and broadcast in state-controlled media.\n\n\nDuring the governments of General Prem Tinsulanonda (1981–1987), the relationship between the Thai state and the monarch was at its closest. Prem, later to become President of Bhumibol's Privy Council, officially allocated government budgets and manpower to support royal projects. Most activities in this period involved the development of large-scale irrigation projects in rural areas.\n\n\nDuring the modern period (post-1988), the structured development of the royal projects reached its apex. Bhumibol's Chaipattana Foundation was established, promoting his \"sufficiency economy\" theory, an alternative to the export-oriented policies adopted by the period's elected governments. Following the 2006 coup, establishment of a \"sufficiency economy\" was enshrined in the constitution as being a primary goal of the government, and government financial support for royal projects was boosted.\n\n\n\n### Project samplings[edit]\n\n\n* 'Sandwich' and 'Supersandwich' artificial rainmaking project under the Thailand Royal Rainmaking Project\n* Chai Pattana Waste Water Aerator, awarded gold medal by BKU (The Belgian Chamber of Inventors) at Brussels Eureka 2000\n* 'Sufficiency economy' Theory\n* New Theory of Agriculture\n* Rice policy, especially increasing production[137] and improvement of germplasm collections which continues through today.[138] For this he received the first Borlaug Medallion in 2007.[139]\n* Use of Vetiver Grass for soil improvement,[137][138] awarded the International Merit Award by the IECA (International Erosion Control Association)\n* Kaem Ling Project, formation of detention basins[140]\n* Klaeng Din Project, acidic soil treatment[141]\n* Fai Maeo Project, formation of check dams\n* Khun Dan Prakanchon Dam, Nakhon Nayok Province\n* Pa Sak Jolasid Dam, Lop Buri Province\n* Pa Sak River Basin Improvement Project\n* Khlong Lat Pho Project, water diversion to prevent flooding in Bangkok\n* Rama VIII Bridge\n* Ratchadaphisek Road\n* Bangkok Industrial Ring Road/Bhumibol Bridge\n* Huai Ongkod Land Rehabilitation Project, Kanchanaburi Province\n* Khao Hin Son Royal Development Study Centre, Chachoengsao Province\n* Phikun Thong Royal Development Study Centre, Narathiwat Province\n* Huai Sai Royal Development Study Centre, Phetchaburi Province\n* Royal Medical Team.

In addition, the Royal Household sends letters of support to physicians who volunteer to serve in hospitals in provinces where royal palaces are present.[142]\n* In honour of his work in soil science, the United Nations observes the king's birthday, 5 December, as World Soil Day. The first observance was in 2014.[143][144]\n\n\n## 60th anniversary celebrations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 60th Anniversary Celebrations of Bhumibol Adulyadej's Accession\n\nAlso called the Diamond Jubilee, the 60th anniversary celebrations of the king's accession to the throne were a series of events marking Bhumibol's reign in June 2006. Events included a royal barge procession on the Chao Phraya River, fireworks displays, art exhibitions, and the pardoning of 25,000 prisoners,[145] concerts, and dance performances.\n\n\nTied in with the anniversary, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan presented Bhumibol with the United Nations Development Programme's first Human Development Lifetime Achievement Award on 26 May 2006. National holidays were observed on 9 June and 12–13 June 2006. On 9 June, the king and queen appeared on the balcony of Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall before hundreds of thousands of people. The official royal barge procession on 12 June was attended by the king and queen and royal visitors from 26 other countries. On 13 June, a state banquet for the royal visitors was held in the newly constructed Rama IX Throne Hall at the Grand Palace, the first official function of the hall. The Chiang Mai Royal Floral Expo was also held to honour the anniversary.\n\n\nOn 16 January 2007, the CDRM officially declared the end of the 60th anniversary celebrations and commenced year-long celebrations of Bhumibol's 80th birthday.[146]\n\n\n\n## Private life[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Monarchs of the Chakri dynasty |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) | Phutthayotfa Chulalok (King Rama I) |\n| ![](image) | Phutthaloetla Naphalai (King Rama II) |\n| ![](image) | Nangklao (King Rama III) |\n| ![](image) | Mongkut (King Rama IV) |\n| ![](image) | Chulalongkorn (King Rama V) |\n| ![](image) | Vajiravudh (King Rama VI) |\n| ![](image) | Prajadhipok (King Rama VII) |\n| ![](image) | Ananda Mahidol (King Rama VIII) |\n| ![](image) | Bhumibol Adulyadej (King Rama IX) |\n| ![](image) | Vajiralongkorn (King Rama X) |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nBhumibol was a painter, musician, photographer, author and translator. His book *Phra Mahachanok* is based on a traditional *Jataka* story of Buddhist scripture. *The Story of Thong Daeng* is the story of his dog Thong Daeng.[147]\n\n\nIn his youth, Bhumibol was greatly interested in firearms. He kept a carbine, a Sten gun and two automatic pistols in his bedroom, and he and his elder brother, King Ananda Mahidol, often used the gardens of the palace for target practice.[24]: 70\n\n\nThere are two English-language books that provide extensive detail—albeit not always verifiable—about Bhumibol's life, especially his early years and then throughout his entire reign. One is *The Revolutionary King* (2001) by William Stevenson, the other is *The King Never Smiles* (2006) by Paul M. Handley. A third and earlier work, *The Devil's Discus* (1964), is also available in Thai and English. The latter two books are banned in Thailand, while the first has never been sold in the country due to its \"inaccuracies\", despite having been written with royal patronage.[24]: 162\n\n\nBhumibol's creativity in, among other things, music, art and invention, was the focus of a two-minute long documentary created by the government of Abhisit Vejjajiva that was screened at all branches of the Major Cineplex Group and SF Cinema City, the two largest cinema chains in Thailand.[148]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Compositions by Bhumibol Adulyadej\n\n![](image)Saxophone of Bhumibol Adulyadej, displayed at Bangkok National Museum\nBhumibol was an accomplished jazz saxophone player and composer, playing Dixieland and New Orleans jazz, and also the clarinet, trumpet, guitar, and piano.[149] It is widely believed that his father, Mahidol Adulyadej, may have inspired his passion for artistic pursuits at an early age.[150] Bhumibol initially focused on classical music exclusively for two years but eventually switched to jazz since it allowed him to improvise more freely. It was during this time that he decided to specialize in wind instruments, especially the saxophone and clarinet.[150] By the time Bhumibol turned 18, he started to compose his own music with the first being *Candlelight Blues*.[150] He continued to compose even during his reign following his coronation in 1946. Bhumibol performed with Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Benny Goodman, Stan Getz, Lionel Hampton, and Benny Carter.[149][151] Throughout his life, Bhumibol wrote a total of 49 compositions. Much of it is jazz swing but he also composed marches, waltzes, and Thai patriotic songs. His most popular compositions were *Candlelight Blues*, *Love at Sundown*, and *Falling Rain* which were all composed in 1946.[149] Bhumibol's musical influences included Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Benny Carter, and Johnny Hodges.[149] The Bhumibol Adulyadej (King of Thailand) Collection, 1946–1954 at the Library of Congress Music Division includes some of his compositions, including 13 music manuscripts, 100 pieces of printed music, clippings, correspondence, and other miscellaneous documents.[152]\n\n\nBhumibol initially received general music training privately while he was studying in Switzerland, but his older brother, then King Ananda Mahidol, who had bought a saxophone, sent Bhumibol in his place.[151] King Ananda would later join him on the clarinet.[151] On his permanent return to Thailand in 1950, Bhumibol started a jazz band, Lay Kram, whom he performed with on a radio station he started at his palace.[151] The band grew, being renamed the Au Sau Wan Suk Band and he would perform with them live on Friday evenings, occasionally taking telephoned requests.[151] Bhumibol also performed with his band at Thai universities, composing anthems for the universities of Chulalongkorn, Thammasat, and Kasetsart.[151] Bhumibol performed with Benny Goodman at the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall, in 1956, and later played at Goodman's home in New York in 1960.[149] Many bands such as Les Brown and His Band of Renown, Claude Bolling Big Band, and Preservation Hall Jazz Band recorded some of Bhumibol's compositions and can still be heard in Thailand.[149] A 1996 documentary, *Gitarajan*, was made about Bhumibol's music.[149]\n\n\nBhumibol still played music with his Au Sau Wan Suk Band in later years, but was rarely heard in public.[151] In 1964, Bhumibol became the 23rd person to receive the Certificate of Bestowal of Honorary Membership on behalf of Vienna's University of Music and Performing Arts.[150]\n\n\n\n### Sailing[edit]\n\n\nBhumibol was an accomplished sailor and sailboat designer.[153] He won a gold medal for sailing in the Fourth Southeast Asian Peninsular (SEAP) Games in 1967, together with Princess Ubol Ratana whom he tied for points.[154] This accomplishment was all the more remarkable given Bhumibol's lack of binocular depth perception. On 19 April 1966, Bhumibol also sailed the Gulf of Thailand from Hua Hin to Toey Ngam Harbour[155] in Sattahip, covering 60 nautical miles (110 km) in a 17-hour journey on the \"Vega 1\", an OK Class dinghy he built.[24]\n\n\nLike his father, a former military naval engineer, Bhumibol was an avid boat designer and builder. He produced several small sailboat designs in the International Enterprise, OK, and Moth classes. His designs in the Moth class included the \"Mod\", \"Super Mod\", and \"Micro Mod\".[156]\n\n\n\n### Radio amateur[edit]\n\n\nBhumibol was a radio amateur with the call sign HS1A. He was also the patron of the Radio Amateur Society of Thailand (RAST).[157]\n\n\n\n### Patents[edit]\n\n\nBhumibol was the only Thai monarch to hold a patent.[158] He obtained one in 1993 for a waste water aerator named \"Chai Pattana\", and several patents on rainmaking after 1955: the \"sandwich\" rainmaking patent in 1999 and the \"supersandwich\" patent in 2003.[159][160][161]\n\n\n\n## Wealth[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Portrait, TMB Bank office building in Bangkok 2006\n![](image)Portrait, Thai Airways International Building\nEstimates of the post-devaluation (c. 1997–1998) wealth of the royal household and the Crown Property Bureau (CPB) range from US$10–20 billion.[162] In August 2008, *Forbes* published its 2008 version of *The World's Richest Royals* and King Bhumibol was listed first, with an estimated wealth of US$35 billion.[163] A few days later, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand issued a statement that the *Forbes* report incorrectly conflated the wealth of the CPB and that of Bhumibol.[164] In the 2009 *Forbes* list, the Thai government's objections were acknowledged, but *Forbes* justified the continued inclusion of the CPB's assets, as the bureau is responsible for handling the Crown's property and investments.[10] The 2009 estimate was a reduced figure of US$30 billion due to declines in real estate and stocks, and this figure was also published in April 2014 by *Business Spectator*, which also confirmed that the CPB is the body responsible for the management of the Crown's wealth.[10][13]\n\n\nThe wealth and properties of Bhumibol and the royal family are managed by the Privy Purse. The CPB manages the assets of the Crown as an institution. It was established by law, but is directed without the involvement of the Thai government and reports only to the king.[165] The CPB receives many state privileges. Although the minister of finance presides over the CPB's board of directors, final decisions were made solely by Bhumibol. During his lifetime Bhumibol was the only person who could view the CPB's annual report, which was not released to the public.[166]\n\n\nThrough the CPB, the Crown owns equity in many companies and massive amounts of land, including 3,320 acres in central Bangkok, as well as 13,200 acres of rural land.[13][167] The CPB owns 32 percent of Siam Cement (worth US$12.6 billion), 23 percent of Siam Commercial Bank (Thailand's largest bank), and interests in Christiani & Nielsen, Deves Insurance, and Shin Corporation.[13]\n\n\nThe CPB also lets or leases about 36,000 properties to third parties, including the sites of the Anantara Siam Bangkok Hotel, the Suan Lum Night Bazaar, Siam Paragon, and the Central World Tower. The CPB spearheaded a plan to turn Bangkok's historical Ratchadamnoen Avenue into a shopping street known as the \"Champs-Élysées of Asia\" and in 2007, shocked longtime residents of traditional marketplace districts by serving them with eviction notices.[166] The Crown's substantial income from the CPB, estimated to be at least five billion baht in 2004, is exempt from taxes.[166][168]\n\n\nKing Bhumibol was the owner of the Golden Jubilee Diamond, the largest faceted diamond in the world, which is estimated to be worth between US$4–12 million in April 2014.[13]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A government officer pays respect to the portrait of King Bhumibol.\nMain article: Lèse majesté in Thailand\n\nAlthough Bhumibol was held in great respect by many Thais,[15] he was also protected by some of the strictest *lèse-majesté* laws in the world. Under these laws, critics could be jailed for three to fifteen years.[169] After the Thammasat University Massacre in 1976, the laws were toughened during the dictatorship of royalist and anti-communist Premier Thanin Kraivichien. Criticism of any member of the royal family, the royal development projects, the royal institution, the Chakri Dynasty or any previous Thai king was also banned.\n\n\nDuring his 2005 birthday speech, Bhumibol invited criticism: \"Actually, I must also be criticised. I am not afraid if the criticism concerns what I do wrong, because then I know. Because if you say the king cannot be criticised, it means that the king is not human\", he claimed. \"If the king can do no wrong, it is akin to looking down upon him because the king is not being treated as a human being. But the king can do wrong.\"[39] A widespread barrage of criticisms resulted, followed by a sharp rise in *lèse-majesté* prosecutions. *Lèse-majesté* cases rose from five or six a year pre-2005 to 478 in 2010.[170]\n\n\nAlthough *lèse-majesté* officially only applies to current kings, in practice the laws are very broadly construed and flexible. Even after his death, Bhumibol remains protected by *lèse-majesté*.\n\n\n\n## Biographies[edit]\n\n\nAmerican journalist Paul Handley, who spent thirteen years in Thailand, wrote the biography *The King Never Smiles*. The Information and Communications Ministry banned the book and blocked the book's page on the Yale University Press website in January 2006. In a statement dated 19 January 2006, Thai National Police Chief General Kowit Wattana said the book had \"contents which could affect national security and the good morality of the people\".[171] The book provided a detailed discussion of Bhumibol's role in Thai political history, and it also analyzed the factors behind Bhumibol's popularity.\n\n\nWilliam Stevenson, who had access to the royal court and the royal family, wrote the biography *The Revolutionary King* in 2001.[172] An article in *Time* said the idea for the book was suggested by Bhumibol.[173] Critics noted that the book displayed intimate knowledge about personal aspects of Bhumibol. However, the book was unofficially banned in Thailand and the Bureau of the Royal Household warned the Thai media about even referring to it in print. An official ban was not possible as it was written with Bhumibol's blessing. The book was criticised for factual inaccuracies, disrespecting Bhumibol (it refers to him by his personal nickname \"Lek\"), and proposing a controversial theory explaining the mysterious death of King Ananda. Stevenson said: \"The king said from the beginning the book would be dangerous for him and for me.\"[173]\n\n\n\n## Succession to the throne[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The King's Royal Cypher and personal flag\nPrior to 1972, there was widespread speculation that Bhumibol had been considering his eldest child Ubol Ratana as successor. Ubol Ratana, considered Bhumibol's most intelligent and favorite child, disobeyed her parents by marrying Peter Ladd Jensen, her classmate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her parents stripped her of her royal title and banished her from the court; she did not return to Thailand for eight years.[24]: 684 After this, Bhumibol's only son, Prince Vajiralongkorn, was given the title \"Somdej Phra Boroma Orasadhiraj Chao Fah Maha Vajiralongkorn Sayam Makutrajakuman\" (Crown Prince of Siam) on 28 December 1972 and made heir apparent (องค์รัชทายาท) to the throne in accordance with the Palace Law on Succession of 1924.[174]\n\n\nOn 5 December 1977, Princess Sirindhorn was given the title \"Siam Boromrajakumari\" (Princess Royal of Siam). Her title is often translated by the English-language press as \"Crown Princess\", although her official English-language title is simply \"Princess\".[175]\n\n\nAlthough the constitution was later amended to allow the Privy Council to appoint a princess as successor to the throne, this would only occur in the absence of an heir apparent. This amendment is retained in Section 23 of the 1997 \"People's Constitution\". This effectively allowed Princess Sirindhorn to potentially be second in line to the throne, but did not affect Prince Vajiralongkorn's status as heir apparent.\n\n\nRecent constitutions of Thailand have made the amendment of the Palace Law of Succession the sole prerogative of the reigning king. According to Assoc. Prof. Gothom Arya, former election commissioner, this allows the reigning king, if he so chooses, to appoint his son or any of his daughters to the throne.[176]\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nBhumibol's signature in 1952 Amendment to the Thai Constitution of 1932, signed as \"Somdet Phra Poraminthra Maha **Bhumibol Adulyadej** Sayaminthrathirat Borommanatbophit\"\n\nBhumibol's US birth certificate reads simply \"**Baby Songkla**\", as the parents had to consult his uncle, King Rama VII (Prajadhipok), then head of the House of Chakri, for an auspicious name. The king chose a name of Sanskrit origin, *Bhumibol Adulyadej* (Devanagari: भूमिबल अतुल्यतेज, IAST: *Bhūmibala Atulyateja*), a compound of *Bhūmi* (भूमि), meaning \"Land\"; *Bala* (बल), meaning \"Strength\" or \"Power\"; *Atulya* (अतुल्य), meaning \"Incomparable\"; and *Tej* (तेज), meaning \"Power\". Thus, *Bhūmibala Atulyateja*, or *Bhumibol Adulyadej* as it is transliterated in Thai, can be literally translated as \"Strength of the Land, Incomparable Power\".[22]\n\n\n\n## Titles and honours[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of titles and honours of Bhumibol Adulyadej\n\n\n\n| Styles of**King Bhumibol Adulyadej  Rama IX of Thailand** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Reference style | His Majesty |\n| Spoken style | Your Majesty |\n\n\n![](image)Royal Monogram of King Bhumibol Adulyadej\n### Titles and styles[edit]\n\n\n* 5 December 1927 – 9 July 1935: *His Highness* Prince Bhumibol Aduldej (พระวรวงศ์เธอ พระองค์เจ้าภูมิพลอดุลเดช *Phra Worawong Thoe Phra Ong Chao Bhumibol Aduldej*)[177]\n* 9 July 1935 – 9 June 1946: *His Royal Highness* Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej of Siam (สมเด็จพระเจ้าน้องยาเธอ เจ้าฟ้าภูมิพลอดุลยเดช *Somdet Phrachao Nongya Thoe Chaofa Bhumibol Adulyadej*)[177]\n* 9 June 1946 – 13 October 2016: *His Majesty* The King of Thailand\n\t+ 9 June 1946 – 5 May 1950 (สมเด็จพระเจ้าอยู่หัว *Somdet Phrachao Yuhua*)[177]\n\t+ 5 May 1950 – 13 October 2016 (พระบาทสมเด็จพระเจ้าอยู่หัว *Phrabat Somdet Phrachao Yuhua*)[177]\n\n\n### Military rank[edit]\n\n\nHis highest rank was as a field marshal.[178] His other ranks in the military include Admiral of the Fleet[179] and Marshal of the Royal Thai Air Force.[178]\n\n\n\n## Issue[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Birth\n | Marriage\n | Their children\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Date\n | Spouse\n |\n| Princess Ubolratana |  (1951-04-05) 5 April 1951 (age 73) | 29 July 1981Divorced 1998 | Peter Ladd Jensen\n | Ploypailin Jensen |\n| Poom Jensen |\n| Sirikitiya Jensen |\n| Vajiralongkorn (Rama X)\n |  (1952-07-28) 28 July 1952 (age 71) | 3 January 1977Divorced 12 August 1991 | Soamsawali Kitiyakara | Bajrakitiyabha, Princess Rajasarini Siribajra |\n| February 1994Divorced 1996 | Yuvadhida Polpraserth | Juthavachara Vivacharawongse\n |\n| Vacharaesorn Vivacharawongse |\n| Chakriwat Vivacharawongse\n |\n| Vatchrawee Vivacharawongse\n |\n| Princess Sirivannavari |\n| 10 February 2001Divorced 11 December 2014 | Srirasmi Suwadee | Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti |\n| 1 May 2019\n | Suthida Tidjai | None\n |\n| Sirindhorn, Princess Royal |  (1955-04-02) 2 April 1955 (age 69) | None\n | None\n |\n| Chulabhorn, Princess Srisavangavadhana |  (1957-07-04) 4 July 1957 (age 66) | 7 January 1982Divorced 1996 | Virayudh Tishyasarin\n | Princess Siribha Chudabhorn |\n| Princess Aditayadorn Kitikhun |\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand. *The Story of Tongdaeng*.

She was queen regnant of 32 sovereign states over the course of her lifetime and remained the monarch of 15 realms by the time of her death. Her reign of over 70 years is the longest of any British monarch and the longest verified reign of any female head of state in history.\n\n\nElizabeth was born in Mayfair, London, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, King George V. She was the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his brother Edward VIII, making the ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021. They had four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.\n\n\nWhen her father died in February 1952, Elizabeth—then 25 years old—became queen of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (known today as Sri Lanka), as well as head of the Commonwealth. Elizabeth reigned as a constitutional monarch through major political changes such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland, devolution in the United Kingdom, the decolonisation of Africa, and the United Kingdom's accession to the European Communities and withdrawal from the European Union. The number of her realms varied over time as territories gained independence and some realms became republics. As queen, Elizabeth was served by more than 170 prime ministers across her realms. Her many historic visits and meetings included state visits to China in 1986, to Russia in 1994, and to the Republic of Ireland in 2011, and meetings with five popes and fourteen US presidents.\n\n\nSignificant events included Elizabeth's coronation in 1953 and the celebrations of her Silver, Golden, Diamond, and Platinum jubilees in 1977, 2002, 2012, and 2022, respectively. Although she faced occasional republican sentiment and media criticism of her family—particularly after the breakdowns of her children's marriages, her *annus horribilis* in 1992, and the death in 1997 of her former daughter-in-law Diana—support for the monarchy in the United Kingdom remained consistently high throughout her lifetime, as did her personal popularity. Elizabeth died aged 96 at Balmoral Castle in September 2022, and was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nElizabeth was born on 21 April 1926, the first child of Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father was the second son of King George V and Queen Mary, and her mother was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. She was delivered at 02:40 (GMT)[1] by Caesarean section at her maternal grandfather's London home, 17 Bruton Street in Mayfair.[2] The Anglican Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, baptised her in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 29 May,[3][b] and she was named Elizabeth after her mother; Alexandra after her paternal great-grandmother, who had died six months earlier; and Mary after her paternal grandmother.[5] She was called \"Lilibet\" by her close family,[6] based on what she called herself at first.[7] She was cherished by her grandfather George V, whom she affectionately called \"Grandpa England\",[8] and her regular visits during his serious illness in 1929 were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery.[9]\n\n\n\n![Elizabeth as a thoughtful-looking toddler with curly, fair hair](image)\nOn the cover of *Time*, April 1929\n![Elizabeth as a rosy-cheeked young girl with blue eyes and fair hair](image)\nPortrait by Philip de László, 1933\n\nElizabeth's only sibling, Princess Margaret, was born in 1930. The two princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and their governess, Marion Crawford.[10] Lessons concentrated on history, language, literature, and music.[11] Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled *The Little Princesses* in 1950, much to the dismay of the royal family.[12] The book describes Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her orderliness, and her attitude of responsibility.[13] Others echoed such observations: Winston Churchill described Elizabeth when she was two as \"a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant.\"[14] Her cousin Margaret Rhodes described her as \"a jolly little girl, but fundamentally sensible and well-behaved\".[15] Elizabeth's early life was spent primarily at the Yorks' residences at 145 Piccadilly (their town house in London) and Royal Lodge in Windsor.[16]\n\n\n\n## Heir presumptive[edit]\n\n\nDuring her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth was third in the line of succession to the British throne, behind her uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, and her father. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as Edward was still young and likely to marry and have children of his own, who would precede Elizabeth in the line of succession.[17] When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second in line to the throne, after her father. Later that year, Edward abdicated, after his proposed marriage to divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis.[18] Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, taking the regnal name George VI. Since Elizabeth had no brothers, she became heir presumptive. If her parents had subsequently had a son, he would have been heir apparent and above her in the line of succession, which was determined by the male-preference primogeniture in effect at the time.[19]\n\n\nElizabeth received private tuition in constitutional history from Henry Marten, Vice-Provost of Eton College,[20] and learned French from a succession of native-speaking governesses.[21] A Girl Guides company, the 1st Buckingham Palace Company, was formed specifically so she could socialise with girls her age.[22] Later, she was enrolled as a Sea Ranger.[21]\n\n\nIn 1939, Elizabeth's parents toured Canada and the United States. As in 1927, when they had toured Australia and New Zealand, Elizabeth remained in Britain since her father thought she was too young to undertake public tours.[23] She \"looked tearful\" as her parents departed.[24] They corresponded regularly,[24] and she and her parents made the first royal transatlantic telephone call on 18 May.[23]\n\n\n\n### Second World War[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In Auxiliary Territorial Service uniform, April 1945\nIn September 1939, Britain entered the Second World War. Lord Hailsham suggested that Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret should be evacuated to Canada to avoid the frequent aerial bombings of London by the *Luftwaffe*.[25] This was rejected by their mother, who declared, \"The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave.\"[26] The princesses stayed at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to Sandringham House, Norfolk.[27] From February to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge, Windsor, until moving to Windsor Castle, where they lived for most of the next five years.[28] At Windsor, the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments.[29] In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's *Children's Hour*, addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities.[30] She stated: \"We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers, and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our own share of the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well.\"[30]\n\n\nIn 1943, Elizabeth undertook her first solo public appearance on a visit to the Grenadier Guards, of which she had been appointed colonel the previous year.[31] As she approached her 18th birthday, Parliament changed the law so that she could act as one of five counsellors of state in the event of her father's incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944.[32] In February 1945, she was appointed an honorary second subaltern in the Auxiliary Territorial Service with the service number 230873.[33] She trained as a driver and mechanic and was given the rank of honorary junior commander (female equivalent of captain at the time) five months later.[34]\n\n\n\n![](image)Elizabeth (far left) on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family and Winston Churchill, 8 May 1945\nAt the end of the war in Europe, on Victory in Europe Day, Elizabeth and Margaret mingled incognito with the celebrating crowds in the streets of London. Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, \"We asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised ... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief.\"[35]\n\n\nDuring the war, plans were drawn to quell Welsh nationalism by affiliating Elizabeth more closely with Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for several reasons, including fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd at a time when Britain was at war.[36] Welsh politicians suggested she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent.[37] In 1946, she was inducted into the Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.[38]\n\n\nElizabeth went on her first overseas tour in 1947, accompanying her parents through southern Africa. During the tour, in a broadcast to the British Commonwealth on her 21st birthday, she made the following pledge: \n\n\n\n\n> I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong. But I shall not have strength to carry out this resolution alone unless you join in it with me, as I now invite you to do: I know that your support will be unfailingly given. God help me to make good my vow, and God bless all of you who are willing to share in it.[39][c]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Marriage[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten\n\nElizabeth met her future husband, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, in 1934 and again in 1937.[41] They were second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark and third cousins through Queen Victoria. After meeting for the third time at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth in July 1939, Elizabeth—though only 13 years old—said she fell in love with Philip, who was 18, and they began to exchange letters.[42] She was 21 when their engagement was officially announced on 9 July 1947.[43]\n\n\nThe engagement attracted some controversy. Philip had no financial standing, was foreign-born (though a British subject who had served in the Royal Navy throughout the Second World War), and had sisters who had married German noblemen with Nazi links.[44] Marion Crawford wrote, \"Some of the King's advisors did not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip's foreign origin.\"[45] Later biographies reported that Elizabeth's mother had reservations about the union initially and teased Philip as \"the Hun\".[46] In later life, however, she told the biographer Tim Heald that Philip was \"an English gentleman\".[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)At Buckingham Palace with Philip after their wedding, 1947\nBefore the marriage, Philip renounced his Greek and Danish titles, officially converted from Greek Orthodoxy to Anglicanism, and adopted the style *Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten*, taking the surname of his mother's British family.[48] Shortly before the wedding, he was created Duke of Edinburgh and granted the style *His Royal Highness*.[49] Elizabeth and Philip were married on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey. They received 2,500 wedding gifts from around the world.[50] Elizabeth required ration coupons to buy the material for her gown (which was designed by Norman Hartnell) because Britain had not yet completely recovered from the devastation of the war.[51] In post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for Philip's German relations, including his three surviving sisters, to be invited to the wedding.[52] Neither was an invitation extended to the Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII.[53]\n\n\nElizabeth gave birth to her first child, Prince Charles, in November 1948. One month earlier, the King had issued letters patent allowing her children to use the style and title of a royal prince or princess, to which they otherwise would not have been entitled as their father was no longer a royal prince.[54] A second child, Princess Anne, was born in August 1950.[55]\n\n\nFollowing their wedding, the couple leased Windlesham Moor, near Windsor Castle, until July 1949,[50] when they took up residence at Clarence House in London. At various times between 1949 and 1951, Philip was stationed in the British Crown Colony of Malta as a serving Royal Navy officer. He and Elizabeth lived intermittently in Malta for several months at a time in the hamlet of Gwardamanġa, at Villa Guardamangia, the rented home of Philip's uncle Lord Mountbatten. Their two children remained in Britain.[56]\n\n\n\n## Reign[edit]\n\n\n### Accession and coronation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Coronation of Elizabeth II\n\n![Elizabeth is seated and holds an orb and sceptre.](image)Coronation portrait by Cecil Beaton, 1953\nAs George VI's health declined during 1951, Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events. When she visited Canada and Harry S. Truman in Washington, DC, in October 1951, her private secretary Martin Charteris carried a draft accession declaration in case the King died while she was on tour.[57] In early 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand by way of the British colony of Kenya. On 6 February, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, Sagana Lodge, after a night spent at Treetops Hotel, when word arrived of the death of Elizabeth's father. Philip broke the news to the new queen.[58] She chose to retain Elizabeth as her regnal name,[59] and was therefore called Elizabeth II. The numeral offended some Scots, as she was the first Elizabeth to rule in Scotland.[60] She was proclaimed queen throughout her realms, and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom.[61] Elizabeth and Philip moved into Buckingham Palace.[62]\n\n\nWith Elizabeth's accession, it seemed possible that the royal house would take her husband's name, in line with the custom for married women of the time. Lord Mountbatten advocated for *House of Mountbatten*, and Philip suggested *House of Edinburgh*, after his ducal title.[63] The British prime minister, Winston Churchill, and Elizabeth's grandmother Queen Mary favoured the retention of the House of Windsor. Elizabeth issued a declaration on 9 April 1952 that the royal house would continue to be *Windsor*. Philip complained, \"I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.\"[64] In 1960, the surname *Mountbatten-Windsor* was adopted for Philip and Elizabeth's male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles.[65][66]\n\n\nAmid preparations for the coronation, Princess Margaret told her sister she wished to marry Peter Townsend, a divorcé 16 years Margaret's senior with two sons from his previous marriage. Elizabeth asked them to wait for a year; in the words of her private secretary, \"the Queen was naturally sympathetic towards the Princess, but I think she thought—she hoped—given time, the affair would peter out.\"[67] Senior politicians were against the match and the Church of England did not permit remarriage after divorce. If Margaret had contracted a civil marriage, she would have been expected to renounce her right of succession.[68] Margaret decided to abandon her plans with Townsend.[69] In 1960, she married Antony Armstrong-Jones, who was created Earl of Snowdon the following year. They divorced in 1978; she did not remarry.[70]\n\n\nDespite the death of Queen Mary on 24 March 1953, the coronation went ahead as planned on 2 June, as Mary had requested.[71] The coronation ceremony in Westminster Abbey was televised for the first time, with the exception of the anointing and communion.[72][d] On Elizabeth's instruction, her coronation gown was embroidered with the floral emblems of Commonwealth countries.[76]\n\n\n\n### Early reign[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Commonwealth realm § From the accession of Elizabeth II\n\n![](image)Elizabeth's realms (light red and pink) and their territories and protectorates (dark red) at the beginning of her reign in 1952\nFrom Elizabeth's birth onwards, the British Empire continued its transformation into the Commonwealth of Nations.[77] By the time of her accession in 1952, her role as head of multiple independent states was already established.[78] In 1953, Elizabeth and her husband embarked on a seven-month round-the-world tour, visiting 13 countries and covering more than 40,000 miles (64,000 km) by land, sea and air.[79] She became the first reigning monarch of Australia and New Zealand to visit those nations.[80] During the tour, crowds were immense; three-quarters of the population of Australia were estimated to have seen her.[81] Throughout her reign, Elizabeth made hundreds of state visits to other countries and tours of the Commonwealth; she was the most widely travelled head of state.[82]\n\n\nIn 1956, the British and French prime ministers, Sir Anthony Eden and Guy Mollet, discussed the possibility of France joining the Commonwealth. The proposal was never accepted, and the following year France signed the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community, the precursor to the European Union.[83] In November 1956, Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal. Lord Mountbatten said Elizabeth was opposed to the invasion, though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.[84]\n\n\n\n![A formal group of Elizabeth in tiara and evening dress with eleven politicians in evening dress or national costume](image)With Commonwealth leaders at the 1960 Commonwealth Conference\nThe governing Conservative Party had no formal mechanism for choosing a leader, meaning that it fell to Elizabeth to decide whom to commission to form a government following Eden's resignation. Eden recommended she consult Lord Salisbury, the lord president of the council. Lord Salisbury and Lord Kilmuir, the lord chancellor, consulted the British Cabinet, Churchill, and the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, resulting in Elizabeth appointing their recommended candidate: Harold Macmillan.[85]\n\n\nThe Suez crisis and the choice of Eden's successor led, in 1957, to the first major personal criticism of Elizabeth. In a magazine, which he owned and edited,[86] Lord Altrincham accused her of being \"out of touch\".[87] Altrincham was denounced by public figures and slapped by a member of the public appalled by his comments.[88] Six years later, in 1963, Macmillan resigned and advised Elizabeth to appoint Alec Douglas-Home as the prime minister, advice she followed.[89] Elizabeth again came under criticism for appointing the prime minister on the advice of a small number of ministers or a single minister.[89] In 1965, the Conservatives adopted a formal mechanism for electing a leader, thus relieving the Queen of her involvement.[90]\n\n\n\n![](image)Seated with Philip on thrones at the Canadian parliament, 1957\nIn 1957, Elizabeth made a state visit to the United States, where she addressed the United Nations General Assembly on behalf of the Commonwealth. On the same tour, she opened the 23rd Canadian Parliament, becoming the first monarch of Canada to open a parliamentary session.[91] Two years later, solely in her capacity as Queen of Canada, she revisited the United States and toured Canada.[91][92] In 1961, she toured Cyprus, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Iran.[93] On a visit to Ghana the same year, she dismissed fears for her safety, even though her host, President Kwame Nkrumah, who had replaced her as head of state, was a target for assassins.[94] Harold Macmillan wrote, \"The Queen has been absolutely determined all through ... She is impatient of the attitude towards her to treat her as ... a film star ... She has indeed 'the heart and stomach of a man' ... She loves her duty and means to be a Queen.\"[94] Before her tour through parts of Quebec in 1964, the press reported extremists within the Quebec separatist movement were plotting Elizabeth's assassination.[95] No attempt was made, but a riot did break out while she was in Montreal; Elizabeth's \"calmness and courage in the face of the violence\" was noted.[96]\n\n\nElizabeth gave birth to her third child, Prince Andrew, in February 1960, which was the first birth to a reigning British monarch since 1857.[97] Her fourth child, Prince Edward, was born in March 1964.[98]\n\n\n\n### Political reforms and crises[edit]\n\n\n![Elizabeth waving from a car](image)\nIn Queensland, Australia, 1970\n![](image)\nWith President Tito of Yugoslavia in Belgrade, 1972\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw an acceleration in the decolonisation of Africa and the Caribbean. More than 20 countries gained independence from Britain as part of a planned transition to self-government. In 1965, however, the Rhodesian prime minister, Ian Smith, in opposition to moves towards majority rule, unilaterally declared independence while expressing \"loyalty and devotion\" to Elizabeth, declaring her \"Queen of Rhodesia\".[99] Although Elizabeth formally dismissed him, and the international community applied sanctions against Rhodesia, his regime survived for over a decade.[100] As Britain's ties to its former empire weakened, the British government sought entry to the European Community, a goal it achieved in 1973.[101]\n\n\nIn 1966, the Queen was criticised for waiting eight days before visiting the village of Aberfan, where a mining disaster claimed the lives of 116 children and 28 adults. Charteris said that the delay, made on his advice, was a mistake that she later regretted.[102][103]\n\n\nElizabeth toured Yugoslavia in October 1972, becoming the first British monarch to visit a communist country.[104] She was received at the airport by President Josip Broz Tito, and a crowd of thousands greeted her in Belgrade.[105]\n\n\nIn February 1974, the British prime minister Edward Heath advised Elizabeth to call a general election in the middle of her tour of the Austronesian Pacific Rim, requiring her to fly back to Britain.[106] The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the Liberals. When discussions on forming a coalition foundered, Heath resigned, and Elizabeth asked the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Harold Wilson, to form a government.[107]\n\n\nA year later, at the height of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, the Australian prime minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, after the Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlam's budget proposals.[108] As Whitlam had a majority in the House of Representatives, Speaker Gordon Scholes appealed to Elizabeth to reverse Kerr's decision. She declined, saying she would not interfere in decisions reserved by the Constitution of Australia for the governor-general.[109] The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism.[108]\n\n\n\n![](image)Leaders of the G7 states, members of the royal family and Elizabeth (centre), London, 1977\nIn 1977, Elizabeth marked the Silver Jubilee of her accession. Parties and events took place throughout the Commonwealth, many coinciding with her associated national and Commonwealth tours. The celebrations re-affirmed Elizabeth's popularity, despite virtually coincident negative press coverage of Princess Margaret's separation from her husband, Lord Snowdon.[110] In 1978, Elizabeth endured a state visit to the United Kingdom by Romania's communist leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu, and his wife, Elena,[111] though privately she thought they had \"blood on their hands\".[112] The following year brought two blows: one was the unmasking of Anthony Blunt, former Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, as a communist spy; the other was the assassination of her uncle-in-law Lord Mountbatten by the Provisional Irish Republican Army.[113]\n\n\nAccording to Paul Martin Sr., by the end of the 1970s, Elizabeth was worried the Crown \"had little meaning for\" Pierre Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister.[114] Tony Benn said Elizabeth found Trudeau \"rather disappointing\".[114] Trudeau's supposed republicanism seemed to be confirmed by his antics, such as sliding down banisters at Buckingham Palace and pirouetting behind Elizabeth's back in 1977, and the removal of various Canadian royal symbols during his term of office.[114] In 1980, Canadian politicians sent to London to discuss the patriation of the Canadian constitution found Elizabeth \"better informed ... than any of the British politicians or bureaucrats\".[114] She was particularly interested after the failure of Bill C-60, which would have affected her role as head of state.[114]\n\n\n\n### Perils and dissent[edit]\n\n\n![Elizabeth in red uniform on a black horse](image)Riding Burmese at the 1986 Trooping the Colour ceremony\nDuring the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony, six weeks before the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, six shots were fired at Elizabeth from close range as she rode down The Mall, London, on her horse, Burmese. Police later discovered the shots were blanks. The 17-year-old assailant, Marcus Sarjeant, was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three.[115] Elizabeth's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised.[116] That October, Elizabeth was the subject of another attack while on a visit to Dunedin, New Zealand. Christopher John Lewis, who was 17 years old, fired a shot with a .22 rifle from the fifth floor of a building overlooking the parade but missed.[117] Lewis was arrested, but instead of being charged with attempted murder or treason was sentenced to three years in jail for unlawful possession and discharge of a firearm. Two years into his sentence, he attempted to escape a psychiatric hospital with the intention of assassinating Charles, who was visiting the country with Diana and their son Prince William.[118]\n\n\n\n![Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan on black horses. He bare-headed; she in a headscarf; both in tweeds, jodhpurs and riding boots.](image)Riding at Windsor with President Reagan, June 1982\nFrom April to September 1982, Elizabeth's son Andrew served with British forces in the Falklands War, for which she reportedly felt anxiety[119] and pride.[120] On 9 July, she awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder, Michael Fagan, in the room with her. In a serious lapse of security, assistance only arrived after two calls to the Palace police switchboard.[121] After hosting US president Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visiting his California ranch in 1983, Elizabeth was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada, one of her Caribbean realms, without informing her.[122]\n\n\nIntense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, pioneered by *The Sun* tabloid.[123] As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of *The Sun*, told his staff: \"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true—so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\"[124] Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in *The Observer* of 21 September 1986: \"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\" It was reported, most notably in *The Sunday Times* of 20 July 1986, that Elizabeth was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth secretary-general Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation.[125] Thatcher reputedly said Elizabeth would vote for the Social Democratic Party—Thatcher's political opponents.[126] Thatcher's biographer, John Campbell, claimed \"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making\".[127] Reports of acrimony between them were exaggerated,[128] and Elizabeth gave two honours in her personal gift—membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter—to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major.[129] Brian Mulroney, Canadian prime minister between 1984 and 1993, said Elizabeth was a \"behind the scenes force\" in ending apartheid.[130][131]\n\n\n\nFile:Christmas Card issued by H.R.H. Queen Elizabeth II (1987) (52344711248).jpgWith Philip and their four eldest grandchildren, 1987\nIn 1986, Elizabeth paid a six-day state visit to the People's Republic of China, becoming the first British monarch to visit the country.[132] The tour included the Forbidden City, the Great Wall of China, and the Terracotta Warriors.[133] At a state banquet, Elizabeth joked about the first British emissary to China being lost at sea with Queen Elizabeth I's letter to the Wanli Emperor, and remarked, \"fortunately postal services have improved since 1602\".[134] Elizabeth's visit also signified the acceptance of both countries that sovereignty over Hong Kong would be transferred from the United Kingdom to China in 1997.[135]\n\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, Elizabeth had become the target of satire.[136] The involvement of younger members of the royal family in the charity game show *It's a Royal Knockout* in 1987 was ridiculed.[137] In Canada, Elizabeth publicly supported politically divisive constitutional amendments, prompting criticism from opponents of the proposed changes, including Pierre Trudeau.[130] The same year, the elected Fijian government was deposed in a military coup. As monarch of Fiji, Elizabeth supported the attempts of Governor-General Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau to assert executive power and negotiate a settlement. Coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka deposed Ganilau and declared Fiji a republic.[138]\n\n\n\n### Turbulent years[edit]\n\n\nIn the wake of coalition victory in the Gulf War, Elizabeth became the first British monarch to address a joint meeting of the United States Congress in May 1991.[139]\n\n\n\n![Elizabeth, in formal dress, holds a pair of spectacles to her mouth in a thoughtful pose](image)With Philip in Germany, October 1992\nOn 24 November 1992, in a speech to mark the Ruby Jubilee of her accession to the throne, Elizabeth called 1992 her *annus horribilis* (a Latin phrase, meaning \"horrible year\").[140] Republican feeling in Britain had risen because of press estimates of Elizabeth's private wealth—contradicted by the Palace[e]—and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family.[145] In March, her second son, Prince Andrew, separated from his wife, Sarah; her daughter, Princess Anne, divorced Captain Mark Phillips in April;[146] angry demonstrators in Dresden threw eggs at Elizabeth during a state visit to Germany in October;[147] and a large fire broke out at Windsor Castle, one of her official residences, in November. The monarchy came under increased criticism and public scrutiny.[148] In an unusually personal speech, Elizabeth said that any institution must expect criticism, but suggested it might be done with \"a touch of humour, gentleness and understanding\".[149] Two days later, John Major announced plans to reform the royal finances, drawn up the previous year, including Elizabeth paying income tax from 1993 onwards, and a reduction in the civil list.[150] In December, Prince Charles and his wife, Diana, formally separated.[151] At the end of the year, Elizabeth sued *The Sun* newspaper for breach of copyright when it published the text of her annual Christmas message two days before it was broadcast. The newspaper was forced to pay her legal fees and donated £200,000 to charity.[152] Elizabeth's solicitors had taken successful action against *The Sun* five years earlier for breach of copyright after it published a photograph of her daughter-in-law the Duchess of York and her granddaughter Princess Beatrice.[153]\n\n\nIn January 1994, Elizabeth broke the scaphoid bone in her left wrist as the horse she was riding at Sandringham tripped and fell.[154] In October 1994, she became the first reigning British monarch to set foot on Russian soil.[f] In October 1995, Elizabeth was tricked into a hoax call by Montreal radio host Pierre Brassard impersonating Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien. Elizabeth, who believed that she was speaking to Chrétien, said she supported Canadian unity and would try to influence Quebec's referendum on proposals to break away from Canada.[159]\n\n\nIn the year that followed, public revelations on the state of Charles and Diana's marriage continued.[160] In consultation with her husband and John Major, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury (George Carey) and her private secretary (Robert Fellowes), Elizabeth wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, suggesting that a divorce would be advisable.[161]\n\n\nIn August 1997, a year after the divorce, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris. Elizabeth was on holiday with her extended family at Balmoral. Diana's two sons, Princes William and Harry, wanted to attend church, so Elizabeth and Philip took them that morning.[162] Afterwards, for five days, the royal couple shielded their grandsons from the intense press interest by keeping them at Balmoral where they could grieve in private,[163] but the royal family's silence and seclusion, and the failure to fly a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace, caused public dismay.[131][164] Pressured by the hostile reaction, Elizabeth agreed to return to London and address the nation in a live television broadcast on 5 September, the day before Diana's funeral.[165] In the broadcast, she expressed admiration for Diana and her feelings \"as a grandmother\" for the two princes.[166] As a result, much of the public hostility evaporated.[166]\n\n\nIn October 1997, Elizabeth and Philip made a state visit to India, which included a controversial visit to the site of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre to pay her respects. Protesters chanted \"Killer Queen, go back\",[167] and there were demands for her to apologise for the action of British troops 78 years earlier.[168] At the memorial in the park, she and Philip laid a wreath and stood for a 30‑second moment of silence.[168] As a result, much of the fury among the public softened, and the protests were called off.[167] That November, Elizabeth and her husband held a reception at Banqueting House to mark their golden wedding anniversary.[169] Elizabeth made a speech and praised Philip for his role as a consort, referring to him as \"my strength and stay\".[169]\n\n\nIn 1999, as part of the process of devolution within the UK, Elizabeth formally opened newly established legislatures for Wales and Scotland: the National Assembly for Wales at Cardiff in May,[170] and the Scottish Parliament at Edinburgh in July.[171]\n\n\n\n### Dawn of the new millennium[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Golden Jubilee dinner with living British prime ministers, 2002: (left to right) Tony Blair, Margaret Thatcher, Edward Heath, Elizabeth, James Callaghan, John Major\nOn the eve of the new millennium, Elizabeth and Philip boarded a vessel from Southwark, bound for the Millennium Dome. Before passing under Tower Bridge, Elizabeth lit the National Millennium Beacon in the Pool of London using a laser torch.[172] Shortly before midnight, she officially opened the Dome.[173] During the singing of *Auld Lang Syne*, Elizabeth held hands with Philip and British prime minister Tony Blair.[174]\n\n\nIn 2002, Elizabeth marked her Golden Jubilee, the 50th anniversary of her accession. Her sister and mother died in February and March, respectively, and the media speculated on whether the Jubilee would be a success or a failure.[175] The death of her sister shook Elizabeth; her funeral was one of the rare occasions where Elizabeth openly cried.[176] Elizabeth again undertook an extensive tour of her realms, beginning in Jamaica in February, where she called the farewell banquet \"memorable\" after a power cut plunged King's House, the official residence of the governor-general, into darkness.[177] As in 1977, there were street parties and commemorative events, and monuments were named to honour the occasion. One million people attended each day of the three-day main Jubilee celebration in London,[178] and the enthusiasm shown for Elizabeth by the public was greater than many journalists had anticipated.[179]\n\n\n\n![](image)Greeting NASA employees at the Goddard Space Flight Center, Maryland, May 2007\nIn 2003, Elizabeth sued the *Daily Mirror* for breach of confidence and obtained an injunction which prevented the outlet from publishing information gathered by a reporter who posed as a footman at Buckingham Palace.[180] The newspaper also paid £25,000 towards her legal costs.[181] Though generally healthy throughout her life, in 2003 she had keyhole surgery on both knees. In October 2006, she missed the opening of the new Emirates Stadium because of a strained back muscle that had been troubling her since the summer.[182]\n\n\nIn May 2007, citing unnamed sources, *The Daily Telegraph* reported that Elizabeth was \"exasperated and frustrated\" by the policies of Tony Blair, that she was concerned the British Armed Forces were overstretched in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that she had raised concerns over rural and countryside issues with Blair.[183] She was, however, said to admire Blair's efforts to achieve peace in Northern Ireland.[184] She became the first British monarch to celebrate a diamond wedding anniversary in November 2007.[185] On 20 March 2008, at the Church of Ireland St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh, Elizabeth attended the first Maundy service held outside England and Wales.[186]\n\n\nElizabeth addressed the UN General Assembly for a second time in 2010, again in her capacity as Queen of all Commonwealth realms and Head of the Commonwealth.[187] The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, introduced her as \"an anchor for our age\".[188] During her visit to New York, which followed a tour of Canada, she officially opened a memorial garden for British victims of the 9/11 attacks.[188] Elizabeth's 11-day visit to Australia in October 2011 was her 16th visit to the country since 1954.[189] By invitation of the Irish president, Mary McAleese, she made the first state visit to the Republic of Ireland by a British monarch in May 2011.[190]\n\n\n\n### Diamond Jubilee and milestones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Visiting Birmingham in July 2012 as part of the Diamond Jubilee tour\nElizabeth's 2012 Diamond Jubilee marked 60 years on the throne, and celebrations were held throughout her realms, the wider Commonwealth, and beyond. She and her husband undertook an extensive tour of the United Kingdom, while her children and grandchildren embarked on royal tours of other Commonwealth states on her behalf.[191] On 4 June, Jubilee beacons were lit around the world.[192] On 18 December, she became the first British sovereign to attend a peacetime Cabinet meeting since George III in 1781.[193]\n\n\nElizabeth, who opened the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, also opened the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in London, making her the first head of state to open two Olympic Games in two countries.[194] For the London Olympics, she played herself in a short film as part of the opening ceremony, alongside Daniel Craig as James Bond.[195] On 4 April 2013, she received an honorary BAFTA for her patronage of the film industry and was called \"the most memorable Bond girl yet\" at the award ceremony.[196]\n\n\n\n![](image)Opening the Borders Railway on the day she became the longest-reigning British monarch, 2015. In her speech, she said she had never aspired to achieve that milestone.[197]\nOn 3 March 2013, Elizabeth stayed overnight at King Edward VII's Hospital as a precaution after developing symptoms of gastroenteritis.[198] A week later, she signed the new Charter of the Commonwealth.[199] Because of her age and the need for her to limit travelling, in 2013 she chose not to attend the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting for the first time in 40 years. She was represented at the summit in Sri Lanka by Prince Charles.[200] On 20 April 2018, the Commonwealth heads of government announced that Charles would succeed her as Head of the Commonwealth, which she stated was her \"sincere wish\".[201] She underwent cataract surgery in May 2018.[202] In March 2019, she gave up driving on public roads, largely as a consequence of a car crash involving her husband two months earlier.[203]\n\n\nElizabeth surpassed her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, to become the longest-lived British monarch on 21 December 2007, and the longest-reigning British monarch and longest-reigning queen regnant and female head of state in the world on 9 September 2015.[204] She became the oldest current monarch after King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia died on 23 January 2015.[205] She later became the longest-reigning current monarch and the longest-serving current head of state following the death of King Bhumibol of Thailand on 13 October 2016,[206] and the oldest current head of state on the resignation of Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe on 21 November 2017.[207] On 6 February 2017, she became the first British monarch to commemorate a sapphire jubilee,[208] and on 20 November, she was the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum wedding anniversary.[209] Philip had retired from his official duties as the Queen's consort in August 2017.[210]\n\n\n\n### Pandemic and widowhood[edit]\n\n\nOn 19 March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United Kingdom, Elizabeth moved to Windsor Castle and sequestered there as a precaution.[211] Public engagements were cancelled and Windsor Castle followed a strict sanitary protocol nicknamed \"HMS Bubble\".[212]\n\n\n\n![](image)Virtual meeting with Cindy Kiro during the pandemic, October 2021\nOn 5 April, in a televised broadcast watched by an estimated 24 million viewers in the UK,[213] she asked people to \"take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.\"[214] On 8 May, the 75th anniversary of VE Day, in a television broadcast at 9 pm—the exact time at which her father George VI had broadcast to the nation on the same day in 1945—she asked people to \"never give up, never despair\".[215] In October, she visited the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory in Wiltshire, her first public engagement since the start of the pandemic.[216] On 4 November, she appeared masked for the first time in public, during a private pilgrimage to the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, to mark the centenary of his burial.[217] In 2021, she received her first and second COVID-19 vaccinations in January and April respectively.[218]\n\n\nPrince Philip died on 9 April 2021, after 73 years of marriage, making Elizabeth the first British monarch to reign as a widow or widower since Queen Victoria.[219] She was reportedly at her husband's bedside when he died,[220] and remarked in private that his death had \"left a huge void\".[221] Due to the COVID-19 restrictions in place in England at the time, Elizabeth sat alone at Philip's funeral service, which evoked sympathy from people around the world.[222] In her Christmas broadcast that year, which was ultimately her last, she paid a personal tribute to her \"beloved Philip\", saying, \"That mischievous, inquiring twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him\".[223]\n\n\nDespite the pandemic, Elizabeth attended the 2021 State Opening of Parliament in May,[224] the 47th G7 summit in June,[225] and hosted US president Joe Biden at Windsor Castle. Biden was the 14th US president that the Queen had met.[226] On 5 July, the 73rd anniversary of the founding of the UK's National Health Service, she announced that the NHS would be awarded the George Cross to \"recognise all NHS staff, past and present, across all disciplines and all four nations\".[227] In October 2021, she began using a walking stick during public engagements for the first time since her operation in 2004.[228] Following an overnight stay in hospital on 20 October, her previously scheduled visits to Northern Ireland,[229] the COP26 summit in Glasgow,[230] and the 2021 National Service of Remembrance were cancelled on health grounds.[231] On Christmas Day 2021, while she was staying at Windsor Castle, 19-year-old Jaswant Singh Chail broke into the gardens using a rope ladder and carrying a crossbow with the aim of assassinating Elizabeth in revenge for the Amritsar massacre. Before he could enter any buildings, he was arrested and detained under the Mental Health Act. In 2023, he pleaded guilty to attempting to injure or alarm the sovereign.[232]\n\n\n\n### Platinum Jubilee and beyond[edit]\n\n\n![](image)With the royal family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace following the Platinum Jubilee Pageant, June 2022\nElizabeth's Platinum Jubilee began on 6 February 2022, marking 70 years since she acceded to the throne on her father's death. On the eve of the date, she held a reception at Sandringham House for pensioners, local Women's Institute members and charity volunteers.[233] In her accession day message, Elizabeth renewed her commitment to a lifetime of public service, which she had originally made in 1947.[234]\n\n\nLater that month, Elizabeth had \"mild cold-like symptoms\" and tested positive for COVID-19, along with some staff and family members.[235] She cancelled two virtual audiences on 22 February,[236] but held a phone conversation with British prime minister Boris Johnson the following day amid a crisis on the Russo-Ukrainian border,[g][237] following which she made a donation to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal.[238] On 28 February, she was reported to have recovered and spent time with her family at Frogmore.[239] On 7 March, Elizabeth met Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau at Windsor Castle, in her first in-person engagement since her COVID diagnosis.[240] She later remarked that COVID infection \"leave[s] one very tired and exhausted ... It's not a nice result\".[241]\n\n\nElizabeth was present at the service of thanksgiving for Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey on 29 March,[242] but was unable to attend the annual Commonwealth Day service that month[243] or the Royal Maundy service in April, due to \"episodic mobility problems\".[244] She missed the State Opening of Parliament in May for the first time in 59 years. (She did not attend the 1959 and 1963 state openings as she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, respectively.)[245] In her absence, Parliament was opened by the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge as counsellors of state.[246]\n\n\nDuring the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, Elizabeth was largely confined to balcony appearances and missed the National Service of Thanksgiving.[247] For the Jubilee concert, she took part in a sketch with Paddington Bear that opened the event outside Buckingham Palace.[248] On 13 June, she became the second-longest reigning monarch in history among those whose exact dates of reign are known, with 70 years, 127 days reigned—surpassing King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand.[249] On 6 September, she appointed her 15th British prime minister, Liz Truss, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. This marked the only time she did not receive a new prime minister at Buckingham Palace during her reign.[250] No other British reign had seen so many prime ministers.[251] The Queen's last public message was issued on 7 September to her Canadian people, in the aftermath of the Saskatchewan stabbings.[252]\n\n\nElizabeth never planned to abdicate,[253] though she took on fewer public engagements as she grew older and Prince Charles took on more of her duties.[254] The Queen told Canadian governor-general Adrienne Clarkson in a meeting in 2002 that she would never abdicate, saying \"It is not our tradition. Although, I suppose if I became completely gaga, one would have to do something\".[255] In June 2022, Elizabeth met the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who \"came away thinking there is someone who has no fear of death, has hope in the future, knows the rock on which she stands and that gives her strength.\"[256]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Death and state funeral of Elizabeth II\n\n![](image)Tributes left in The Mall, London\nOn 8 September 2022, Buckingham Palace released a statement which read: \"Following further evaluation this morning, the Queen's doctors are concerned for Her Majesty's health and have recommended she remain under medical supervision. The Queen remains comfortable and at Balmoral.\"[257][258] Her immediate family rushed to Balmoral to be by her side.[259][260] She died peacefully at 15:10 BST at the age of 96, with two of her children, Charles and Anne, by her side;[261][262] Charles immediately succeeded as monarch. Her death was announced to the public at 18:30,[263][264] setting in motion Operation London Bridge and, because she died in Scotland, Operation Unicorn.[265][266] Elizabeth was the first monarch to die in Scotland since James V in 1542.[267] Her death certificate recorded her cause of death as \"old age\".[261][268]\n\n\nOn 12 September, Elizabeth's coffin was carried up the Royal Mile in a procession to St Giles' Cathedral, where the Crown of Scotland was placed on it.[269] Her coffin lay at rest at the cathedral for 24 hours, guarded by the Royal Company of Archers, during which around 33,000 people filed past the coffin.[270] It was taken by air to London on 13 September. On 14 September, her coffin was taken in a military procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall, where Elizabeth lay in state for four days. The coffin was guarded by members of both the Sovereign's Bodyguard and the Household Division. An estimated 250,000 members of the public filed past the coffin, as did politicians and other public figures.[271][272] On 16 September, Elizabeth's children held a vigil around her coffin, and the next day her eight grandchildren did the same.[273][274]\n\n\n\n![](image)Elizabeth's coffin on the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy, during the procession to Wellington Arch\nElizabeth's state funeral was held at Westminster Abbey on 19 September, which marked the first time that a monarch's funeral service had been held at the Abbey since George II in 1760.[275] More than a million people lined the streets of central London,[276] and the day was declared a holiday in several Commonwealth countries. In Windsor, a final procession involving 1,000 military personnel took place, which 97,000 people witnessed.[277][276] Elizabeth's fell pony, and two royal corgis, stood at the side of the procession.[278] After a committal service at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, Elizabeth was interred with her husband Philip in the King George VI Memorial Chapel later the same day, in a private ceremony attended by her closest family members.[279][280][281][282]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Personality and image of Elizabeth II\n\n### Beliefs, activities, and interests[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Petting a dog in New Zealand, 1974\nElizabeth rarely gave interviews, and little was known of her political opinions, which she did not express explicitly in public. It is against convention to ask or reveal the monarch's views. When *Times* journalist Paul Routledge asked her about the miners' strike of 1984–85 during a royal tour of the newspaper's offices, she replied that it was \"all about one man\" (a reference to Arthur Scargill),[283] with which Routledge disagreed.[284] Routledge was widely criticised in the media for asking the question and claimed that he was unaware of the protocols.[284] After the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Prime Minister David Cameron was overheard saying that Elizabeth was pleased with the outcome.[285] She had arguably issued a public coded statement about the referendum by telling one woman outside Balmoral Kirk that she hoped people would think \"very carefully\" about the outcome. It emerged later that Cameron had specifically requested that she register her concern.[286]\n\n\nElizabeth had a deep sense of religious and civic duty, and took her Coronation Oath seriously.[287] Aside from her official religious role as supreme governor of the established Church of England, she worshipped with that church and with the national Church of Scotland.[288] She demonstrated support for inter-faith relations and met with leaders of other churches and religions, including five popes: Pius XII, John XXIII, John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis.[289] A personal note about her faith often featured in her annual Christmas Message broadcast to the Commonwealth. In 2000, she said:[290]\n\n\n\n\n> To many of us, our beliefs are of fundamental importance. For me the teachings of Christ and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life. I, like so many of you, have drawn great comfort in difficult times from Christ's words and example.\n> \n> \n\n\nElizabeth was patron of more than 600 organisations and charities.[291] The Charities Aid Foundation estimated that Elizabeth helped raise over £1.4 billion for her patronages during her reign.[292] Her main leisure interests included equestrianism and dogs, especially her Pembroke Welsh Corgis.[293] Her lifelong love of corgis began in 1933 with Dookie, the first corgi owned by her family.[294] Scenes of a relaxed, informal home life were occasionally witnessed; she and her family, from time to time, prepared a meal together and washed the dishes afterwards.[295]\n\n\n\n### Media depiction and public opinion[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, as a young woman at the start of her reign, Elizabeth was depicted as a glamorous \"fairytale Queen\".[296] After the trauma of the Second World War, it was a time of hope, a period of progress and achievement heralding a \"new Elizabethan age\".[297] Lord Altrincham's accusation in 1957 that her speeches sounded like those of a \"priggish schoolgirl\" was an extremely rare criticism.[298] In the late 1960s, attempts to portray a more modern image of the monarchy were made in the television documentary *Royal Family* and by televising Prince Charles's investiture as Prince of Wales.[299] Elizabeth also instituted other new practices; her first royal walkabout, meeting ordinary members of the public, took place during a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1970.[300] Her wardrobe developed a recognisable, signature style driven more by function than fashion.[301] In public, she took to wearing mostly solid-colour overcoats and decorative hats, allowing her to be seen easily in a crowd.[302] By the end of her reign, nearly one third of Britons had seen or met Elizabeth in person.[303]\n\n\nAt Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee in 1977, the crowds and celebrations were genuinely enthusiastic;[304] but, in the 1980s, public criticism of the royal family increased, as the personal and working lives of Elizabeth's children came under media scrutiny.[305] Her popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public.[306] Although support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher than at any time in living memory, republican ideology was still a minority viewpoint, and Elizabeth herself had high approval ratings.[307] Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself, and the conduct of Elizabeth's wider family, rather than her own behaviour and actions.[308] Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, although Elizabeth's personal popularity—as well as general support for the monarchy—rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.[309]\n\n\n\n![](image)In Brisbane, Australia, 1982\nIn November 1999, a referendum in Australia on the future of the Australian monarchy favoured its retention in preference to an indirectly elected head of state.[310] Many republicans credited Elizabeth's personal popularity with the survival of the monarchy in Australia. In 2010, Prime Minister Julia Gillard noted that there was a \"deep affection\" for Elizabeth in Australia and that another referendum on the monarchy should wait until after her reign.[311] Gillard's successor, Malcolm Turnbull, who led the republican campaign in 1999, similarly believed that Australians would not vote to become a republic in her lifetime.[312] \"She's been an extraordinary head of state\", Turnbull said in 2021, \"and I think frankly, in Australia, there are more Elizabethans than there are monarchists\".[313] Similarly, referendums in both Tuvalu in 2008 and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 2009 saw voters reject proposals to become republics.[314]\n\n\nPolls in Britain in 2006 and 2007 revealed strong support for the monarchy,[315] and in 2012, Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee year, her approval ratings hit 90 per cent.[316] Her family came under scrutiny again in the last few years of her life due to her son Andrew's association with convicted sex offenders Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his lawsuit with Virginia Giuffre amidst accusations of sexual impropriety, and her grandson Harry and his wife Meghan's exit from the working royal family and subsequent move to the United States.[317] Polling in Great Britain during the Platinum Jubilee, however, showed support for maintaining the monarchy[318] and Elizabeth's personal popularity remained strong.[319] As of 2021 she remained the third most admired woman in the world according to the annual Gallup poll, her 52 appearances on the list meaning she had been in the top ten more than any other woman in the poll's history.[320]\n\n\nElizabeth was portrayed in a variety of media by many notable artists, including painters Pietro Annigoni, Peter Blake, Chinwe Chukwuogo-Roy, Terence Cuneo, Lucian Freud, Rolf Harris, Damien Hirst, Juliet Pannett and Tai-Shan Schierenberg.[321][322] Notable photographers of Elizabeth included Cecil Beaton, Yousuf Karsh, Anwar Hussein, Annie Leibovitz, Lord Lichfield, Terry O'Neill, John Swannell and Dorothy Wilding. The first official portrait photograph of Elizabeth was taken by Marcus Adams in 1926.[323]\n\n\n\n## Titles, styles, honours, and arms[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of titles and honours of Elizabeth II\n\n![](image)\nRoyal cypher of Elizabeth II, surmounted by St Edward's Crown\n![](image)\nPersonal flag of Elizabeth II\n\n### Titles and styles [edit]\n\n\nElizabeth held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, was sovereign of many orders in her own countries and received honours and awards from around the world. In each of her realms, she had a distinct title that follows a similar formula: *Queen of Saint Lucia and of Her other Realms and Territories* in Saint Lucia, *Queen of Australia and Her other Realms and Territories* in Australia, etc. In the Isle of Man, which is a Crown Dependency rather than a separate realm, she was known as Lord of Mann. Elizabeth was also styled *Defender of the Faith*.\n\n\n\n### Arms[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Flags of Elizabeth II\n\nFrom 21 April 1944 until her accession, Elizabeth's arms consisted of a lozenge bearing the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom differenced with a label of three points argent, the centre point bearing a Tudor rose and the first and third a cross of Saint George.[324] Upon her accession, she inherited the various arms her father held as sovereign. Elizabeth also possessed royal standards and personal flags for use in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, and elsewhere.[325]\n\n\n\n\n## Issue[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Birth\n | Marriage\n | Children\n | Grandchildren\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Date\n | Spouse\n |\n| Charles III |  (1948-11-14) 14 November 1948 (age 75) | 29 July 1981Divorced 28 August 1996 | Lady Diana Spencer | William, Prince of Wales | * Prince George of Wales\n* Princess Charlotte of Wales\n* Prince Louis of Wales\n |\n| Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex | * Prince Archie of Sussex\n* Princess Lilibet of Sussex\n |\n| 9 April 2005\n | Camilla Parker Bowles | None\n |\n| Anne, Princess Royal |  (1950-08-15) 15 August 1950 (age 73) | 14 November 1973Divorced 23 April 1992 | Mark Phillips | Peter Phillips | * Savannah Phillips\n* Isla Phillips\n |\n| Zara Tindall | * Mia Tindall\n* Lena Tindall\n* Lucas Tindall\n |\n| 12 December 1992\n | Timothy Laurence | None\n |\n| Prince Andrew, Duke of York |  (1960-02-19) 19 February 1960 (age 64) | 23 July 1986Divorced 30 May 1996 | Sarah Ferguson | Princess Beatrice, Mrs Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi | Sienna Mapelli Mozzi\n |\n| Princess Eugenie, Mrs Jack Brooksbank | * August Brooksbank\n* Ernest Brooksbank\n |\n| Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh |  (1964-03-10) 10 March 1964 (age 60) | 19 June 1999\n | Sophie Rhys-Jones | Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor | None\n |\n| James Mountbatten-Windsor, Earl of Wessex | None\n |\n\n\n## Ancestry[edit]\n\n\n| Ancestors of Elizabeth II[326] |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 8.

She was also a member of the Church of Scotland.\n2. **^** Her godparents were: King George V and Queen Mary; Lord Strathmore; Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (her paternal great-granduncle); Princess Mary, Viscountess Lascelles (her paternal aunt); and Lady Elphinstone (her maternal aunt).[4]\n3. **^** The oft-quoted speech was written by Dermot Morrah, a journalist for *The Times*.[40]\n4. **^** Television coverage of the coronation was instrumental in boosting the medium's popularity; the number of television licences in the United Kingdom doubled to 3 million,[73] and many of the more than 20 million British viewers watched television for the first time in the homes of their friends or neighbours.[74] In North America, almost 100 million viewers watched recorded broadcasts.[75]\n5. **^** The *Sunday Times Rich List 1989* put her number one on the list with a reported wealth of £5.2 billion (approximately £16.3 billion in today's value),[141] but it included state assets like the Royal Collection that were not hers personally.[142] In 1993, Buckingham Palace called estimates of £100 million \"grossly overstated\".[143] In 1971, Jock Colville, her former private secretary and a director of her bank, Coutts, estimated her wealth at £2 million (equivalent to about £14 million in 1993[141]).[144]\n6. **^** The only previous state visit by a British monarch to Russia was made by King Edward VII in 1908. The King never stepped ashore, and met Nicholas II on royal yachts off the Baltic port of what is now Tallinn, Estonia.[155][156] During the four-day visit, which was considered to be one of the most important foreign trips of Elizabeth's reign,[157] she and Philip attended events in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.[158]\n7. **^** Russia invaded Ukraine one day later.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"No. 33153\", *The London Gazette*, 21 April 1926, p. 1\n2. **^** Bradford 2012, p. 22;

He acceded to the throne in July 615 and ruled until his death. Pakal reigned 68 years[N 2]—the fifth-longest verified regnal period of any sovereign monarch in history, the longest in world history for more than a millennium,[N 3][2] and still the longest of any residing monarch in the history of the Americas. During his reign, Pakal was responsible for the construction or extension of some of Palenque's most notable surviving inscriptions and monumental architecture.[3] Pakal is perhaps best known in popular culture for his depiction on the carved lid of his sarcophagus, which has become the subject of pseudoarchaeological speculations.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nKʼinich Janaab Pakal I's glyphs.\n\nPakal's full name, *Kʼinich Janaab Pakal* (\"Radiant Corn-Flower (?) Shield\"[5]), is rendered in Classic Maya as **KʼINICH-JANA꞉B-PAKAL-la**, **KʼINICH-JANA꞉B-pa-ka-la**, or **KʼINICH-ja-na-bi-pa-ka-la**.[6] Before his name was securely deciphered from extant Maya inscriptions, Pakal had been known by various nicknames and approximations, including **Sun Shield** and **8 Ahau**.\n\n\nIn modern sources Pakal's name is also sometimes appended with a regnal number,[N 4] to distinguish him from other rulers with this name who either preceded or followed him in the dynastic lineage of Palenque. Confusingly, he has at times been referred to as *either* \"Pakal I\" or \"Pakal II\". Reference to him as Pakal II alludes to his maternal grandfather (died c. 612), who also bore the name Janahb Pakal. However, although his grandfather was a personage of *ajaw* ranking, he does not himself appear to have been a king. When instead the name *Pakal I* is used, this serves to distinguish him from two later known successors to the American rulership, Kʼinich Janaab Pakal II (ruled c. 742) and Janaab Pakal III, the last-known Palenque ruler (ruled c. 799).[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mounted funerary jewelry of Kʼinich Janaab Pakal I.\nKʼinich Janaab Pakal was a Palenque native, born on 9.8.9.13.0 (March 603) to Lady Sak Kʼukʼ of the ruling Palenque dynasty and her husband Kʼan Moʼ Hix.\n\n\nPakal's birth came during a particularly turbulent time in Palenque's history. Palenque had been sacked by the powerful Maya state of Calakmul just four years earlier, and another catastrophic attack was led by Calakmul *ajaw* Scroll Serpent during Pakal's early childhood in 611. The deaths the following year of both the ruling Palenque *ajaw* Ajen Yohl Mat and his heir Janahb Pakal (Pakal's maternal grandfather and namesake) triggered a crisis of succession; eventually Pakal ascended to the rulership of Palenque on 9.9.2.4.8 (July 615), at the age of twelve, after an interim regency by his mother Lady Sak Kʼukʼ.[8]\n\n\n\n## Reign[edit]\n\n\nPakal expanded Palenque's power in the western part of the Maya states and initiated a building program at his capital that produced some of Maya civilization's finest art and architecture.[9] On 9.9.13.0.7 (March 626), he married Ix Tzʼakbu Ajaw, a descendant of the former ruling Toktahn dynasty from Palenque's satellite settlement of Uxteʼkʼuh; during their long marriage, they had at least two sons—Kan Bahlam (b. 635) and Kʼan Joy Chitam (b. 644)—and probably a third, Tiwol Chan Mat (b. 648).[10]\n\n\nIn 628, one of Pakal's officials (*aj kʼuhuun*), was captured by Piedras Negras. Six days later Nuun Ujol Chaak, *ajaw* of Santa Elena, was captured and taken to Palenque. Santa Elena became a tributary of Palenque. Having been appointed *ajaw* at the age of twelve, Pakal's mother was a regent to him. Over the years she slowly ceded power until she died in September 640. In 659 Pakal captured six prisoners; one of them, Ahiin Chan Ahk, was from Pipaʼ, generally associated with Pomona. Another lord of Pipaʼ was slain by Pakal in 663; at this time he also captured six people from Santa Elena.[11]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Palace of Palenque.\nIn 647, at the age of 44, Pakal began his first construction project, the temple today called El Olvidado (The Forgotten) in Spanish due to its distance from Lakamhaʼ. Of all Pakal's construction projects, perhaps the most accomplished is the Palace of Palenque. The building was already in existence, but Pakal enlarged it greatly by adding monument rooms onto the old level of the building. He then constructed Building E, called *Sak Nuk Naah* \"White Skin House\" in Classic Maya for its white coat of paint rather than the red used elsewhere in the palace. The east court of the palace is a ceremonial area marking military triumphs. Houses B and C were built in 661 and house A in 668. House A is covered with frescos of prisoners captured in 662.[12][13] The monuments and text associated with Pakal are: Oval Palace Tablet, Hieroglyphic Stairway, House C texts, Subterranean Thrones and Tableritos, Olvidado piers and sarcophagus texts.[14]\n\n\nPakal was widowed when Tzʼakbu Ajaw, his wife of 47 years, died on 9.12.0.6.18 (November 672). Eight years later, Pakal also saw the death of Tiwol Chan Mat (his third son), and presided over his burial ceremony.[15]\n\n\n\n## Death and burial[edit]\n\n\nPakal died on 9.12.11.5.18 (August 683), at the age of 80, having ruled Palenque for 68 years and 33 days.[16]\n\n\nAfter his death, Pakal was deified as one of the patron gods of Palenque.[17] He was survived at least by his two sons Kan Bahlam and Kʼan Joy Chitam—each of whom subsequently also became Palenque's *kʼuhul ajaw* in his own right[18]—and two grandsons, Ahkal Moʼ Nahb (successor of Kʼinich Kʼan Joy Chitam II as *kʼuhul ajaw* of Palenque) and Janaab Ajaw, a royal official inaugurated under the reign of Kʼinich Kʼan Joy Chitam II.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)A reconstruction of Pakal's tomb in the Museo Nacional de Antropología.\nPakal was buried in a colossal sarcophagus within the largest of Palenque's stepped pyramid structures, the building called *Bʼolon Yej Teʼ Naah* \"House of the Nine Sharpened Spears\"[20] in Classic Maya and now known as the Temple of the Inscriptions. Though Palenque had been examined by archaeologists before, the secret to opening his tomb—closed off by a stone slab with stone plugs in the holes, which had until then escaped the attention of archaeologists—was discovered by Mexican archaeologist Alberto Ruz Lhuillier in 1948. It took four years to clear the rubble from the stairway leading down to Pakal's tomb, but it was finally uncovered in 1952.[21] His skeletal remains were still lying in his sarcophagus, wearing a jade mask and bead necklaces, surrounded by sculptures and stucco reliefs depicting the ruler's transition to divinity and figures from Maya mythology. Traces of pigment show that these were once colorfully painted, common of much Maya sculpture at the time.[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Temple of the Inscriptions.\nInitially, it was hotly debated whether the bones in the tomb were really those of Pakal. The skeleton's comparatively minor degree of dental wear suggested the owner's age as some 40 years younger than the age recorded for Pakal in the inscriptional texts, leading some—including the tomb's discoverer Alberto Ruz Lhuillier—to contend that the texts must have referred to two people with the same name or used a non-standard method of recording time. Epigraphers, on the other hand, insisted that allowing for such possibilities would go against everything else that is known about the Maya calendar and Maya written history, and asserted that the texts clearly state that it is indeed Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal entombed within, and that he did in fact die at the advanced age of 80, after reigning for 68 years. More recent morphometric analysis of the rest of the skeleton demonstrates that the entombed individual could not have lived less than fifty years and most likely died in their eighth or ninth decade of life, consistent with the textual evidence rather than the younger age estimates of early researchers.[23][24] The disparity between the dental wear and the skeletal morphology is likely due to Pakal's aristocratic status, which would have allowed him access to a softer, less abrasive diet than the average Maya person so that his teeth naturally acquired less wear. Unusually large accumulations of dental calculus on his teeth are also consistent with such an interpretation.[25][26]\n\n\nFurther archaeological explorations have continued to shed light on Pakal's burial site. In 2016 an underground water tunnel was discovered under the Temple of Inscriptions; a stucco mask depicting an elderly Pakal was subsequently found in August 2018.[27][28]\n\n\n\n### Pakal's sarcophagus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Carved lid of the tomb of Kʼinich Janaab Pakal I in the Temple of the Inscriptions.\nThe large carved stone sarcophagus lid in the Temple of Inscriptions is a unique piece of Classic Maya art. Iconographically, it is closely related to the large wall panels of the temples of the Cross and the Foliated Cross centered on world trees. Around the edges of the lid is a band with cosmological signs, including those for sun, moon, and star, as well as the heads of six named noblemen of varying rank.[29] The central image is that of a cruciform world tree. Beneath Pakal is one of the heads of a celestial two-headed serpent viewed frontally. Both the king and the serpent head on which he seems to rest are framed by the open jaws of a funerary serpent, a common iconographic device for signalling entrance into, or residence in, the realm(s) of the dead. The king himself wears the attributes of the Tonsured maize god — in particular a turtle ornament on the breast — and is shown in a peculiar posture that may denote rebirth.[30] Interpretation of the lid has raised controversy. Linda Schele saw Pakal falling down the Milky Way into the southern horizon.[31]\n\n\n\n#### Pseudoarchaeology[edit]\n\n\nPakal's tomb has been the subject of ancient astronaut speculations since its appearance in Erich von Däniken's 1968 best-seller *Chariots of the Gods?* Von Däniken reproduced a drawing of the sarcophagus lid (though incorrectly labelling it as being from Copán) and compared Pakal's pose to that of Project Mercury astronauts in the 1960s; he interpreted drawings underneath Pakal as rockets, and offered the sarcophagus lid as possible evidence of an extraterrestrial influence on the ancient Maya.[32][33] Such an interpretation is almost universally denounced by archaeologists, epigraphers, and art historians of the Maya, who point out that von Däniken's claim relies solely upon visual inspection, paying heed neither to the broader archaeological context nor to a wealth of additional research on Classic Maya artistic conventions, symbolism, cosmology, and written history.[34]\n\n\nAnother example of this carving's manifestation in pseudoarchaeology is the identification by José Argüelles of \"Pacal Votan\" as an incarnation named \"Valum Votan,\" who would act as a \"closer of the cycle\" in 2012 (an event that is also significant on Argüelles' \"13 Moon\" calendar). Daniel Pinchbeck, in his book *2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl* (2006), also uses the name \"Pacal Votan\" for Pakal.[35]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** In the Maya calendar: born 9.8.9.13.0, 8 Ajaw 13 Pop; died 9.12.11.5.18, 6 Etzʼnab 11 Yax (Tiesler & Cucina 2004, p. 40).\n2. **^** In the Maya calendar: acceded 9.9.2.4.8, 5 Lamat 1 Mol; died 9.12.11.5.18, 6 Etzʼnab 11 Yax (Martin & Grube 2008, p. 162).\n3. **^** Pakal's record was surpassed in June 1711, by Louis XIV of France; Louis's record still stands as of today.\n4. **^** Maya rulership titles and name glyphs themselves do not use regnal numbers; they are a convenience only of modern scholars.\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Skidmore 2010, p. 71.\n2. **^** Skidmore 2010, p. 7.\n3. **^** Martin & Grube 2008, pp. 162–168.\n4. **^** Wade, Lizzie (2019-04-09). \"Believe in Atlantis?

His verified reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest of any sovereign.[1][a] Although Louis XIV's France was emblematic of the Age of Absolutism in Europe,[3] the King surrounded himself with a variety of significant political, military, and cultural figures, such as Bossuet, Colbert, Louvois, Le Brun, Le Nôtre, Lully, Mazarin, Molière, Racine, Turenne, Condé, and Vauban.\n\n\nLouis began his personal rule of France in 1661, after the death of his chief minister Cardinal Mazarin, when the King famously declared that he would take over the job himself.[4] An adherent of the divine right of kings, Louis continued his predecessors' work of creating a centralised state governed from the capital. He sought to eliminate the remnants of feudalism persisting in parts of France; by compelling many members of the nobility to reside at his lavish Palace of Versailles, he succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy, many of whom had participated in the Fronde rebellions during his minority. He thus became one of the most powerful French monarchs and consolidated a system of absolute monarchy in France that endured until the French Revolution. Louis also enforced uniformity of religion under the Catholic Church. His revocation of the Edict of Nantes abolished the rights of the Huguenot Protestant minority and subjected them to a wave of dragonnades, effectively forcing Huguenots to emigrate or convert, virtually destroying the French Protestant community.\n\n\nDuring Louis's long reign, France emerged as the leading European power and regularly asserted its military strength. A conflict with Spain marked his entire childhood, while during his personal rule, Louis fought three major continental conflicts, each against powerful foreign alliances: the Franco-Dutch War, the Nine Years' War, and the War of the Spanish Succession. In addition, France also contested shorter wars, such as the War of Devolution and the War of the Reunions. Warfare defined Louis's foreign policy and his personal ambition shaped his approach. Impelled by \"a mix of commerce, revenge, and pique\", he sensed that war was the ideal way to enhance his glory. His wars strained France's resources to the utmost, while in peacetime, he concentrated on preparing for the next war. He taught his diplomats that their job was to create tactical and strategic advantages for the French military.[5] Upon his death in 1715, Louis XIV left his great-grandson and successor, Louis XV, a powerful kingdom, albeit in major debt after the War of the Spanish Succession that had raged on since 1701.\n\n\nSignificant achievements during Louis XIV's reign which would go on to have a wide influence on the early modern period, well into the Industrial Revolution and until today, include the construction of the Canal du Midi, the patronage of artists, and the founding of the French Academy of Sciences. \n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Louis XIV as a young child, unknown painter\n![](image)Baptismal certificate, 1638\nLouis XIV was born on 5 September 1638 in the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, to Louis XIII and Anne of Austria. He was named Louis Dieudonné (Louis the God-given)[6] and bore the traditional title of French heirs apparent: *Dauphin*.[7] At the time of his birth, his parents had been married for 23 years. His mother had experienced four stillbirths between 1619 and 1631. Leading contemporaries thus regarded him as a divine gift and his birth a miracle of God.[8]\n\n\nLouis's relationship with his mother was uncommonly affectionate for the time. Contemporaries and eyewitnesses claimed that the Queen would spend all her time with Louis.[9] Both were greatly interested in food and theatre, and it is highly likely that Louis developed these interests through his close relationship with his mother. This long-lasting and loving relationship can be evidenced by excerpts in Louis' journal entries, such as:\n\n\n\n\n> \"Nature was responsible for the first knots which tied me to my mother. But attachments formed later by shared qualities of the spirit are far more difficult to break than those formed merely by blood.\"[10]\n> \n> \n\n\nIt was his mother who gave Louis his belief in the absolute and divine power of his monarchical rule.[11]\n\n\nDuring his childhood, he was taken care of by the governesses Françoise de Lansac and Marie-Catherine de Senecey. In 1646, Nicolas V de Villeroy became the young king's tutor. Louis XIV became friends with Villeroy's young children, particularly François de Villeroy, and divided his time between the Palais-Royal and the nearby Hotel de Villeroy.\n\n\n\n## Minority and the *Fronde*[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Not trusting the judgement of his Spanish wife Queen Anne, who would normally have become the sole regent of France, the king decreed that a regency council would rule on his son's behalf, with Anne at its head.[12]\n\n\nLouis XIII died on 14 May 1643. On 18 May[13] Queen Anne had her husband's will annulled by the *Parlement de Paris*, a judicial body of nobles and high clergymen,[14] and she became sole regent. She exiled her husband's ministers Chavigny and Bouthilier and appointed Brienne[*specify*] as her minister of foreign affairs.[15] Anne kept the direction of religious policy strongly in hand until her son's majority in 1661.\n\n\nShe appointed Cardinal Mazarin as chief minister, giving him the daily administration of policy. She continued the policies of her late husband and Cardinal Richelieu, despite their persecution of her, in order to win absolute authority in France and victory abroad for her son. Anne protected Mazarin by exiling her followers the Duke of Beaufort and Marie de Rohan, who conspired against him in 1643.[16]\n\n\nThe best example of Anne's loyalty to France was her treatment of one of Richelieu's men, the Chancellor Pierre Séguier. Séguier had brusquely interrogated Anne in 1637 (like a \"common criminal\", as she recalled) following the discovery that she was giving military secrets to her father in Spain, and Anne was virtually under house arrest for years. By keeping the effective Séguier in his post, Anne sacrificed her own feelings for the interests of France and her son Louis. \n\n\nThe Queen sought a lasting peace between Catholic nations, but only after a French victory over her native Spain. She also gave a partial Catholic orientation to French foreign policy. This was felt by the Netherlands, France's Protestant ally, which negotiated a separate peace with Spain in 1648.[17]\n\n\nIn 1648, Anne and Mazarin successfully negotiated the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War.[18] Its terms ensured Dutch independence from Spain, awarded some autonomy to the various German princes of the Holy Roman Empire, and granted Sweden seats on the Imperial Diet and territories controlling the mouths of the Oder, Elbe, and Weser Rivers.[19] France, however, profited most from the settlement. Austria, ruled by the Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand III, ceded all Habsburg lands and claims in Alsace to France and acknowledged her *de facto* sovereignty over the Three Bishoprics of Metz, Verdun, and Toul.[20] Moreover, many petty German states sought French protection, eager to emancipate themselves from Habsburg domination. This anticipated the formation of the 1658 League of the Rhine, which further diminished Imperial power.\n\n\n\n### Early acts[edit]\n\n\nAs the Thirty Years' War came to an end, a civil war known as the Fronde erupted in France. It effectively checked France's ability to exploit the Peace of Westphalia. Anne and Mazarin had largely pursued the policies of Cardinal Richelieu, augmenting the Crown's power at the expense of the nobility and the **Parlements**. Anne was more concerned with internal policy than foreign affairs; she was a very proud queen who insisted on the divine rights of the King of France.[21]\n\n\n\n![](image)Europe after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648\nAll this led her to advocate a forceful policy in all matters relating to the King's authority, in a manner that was much more radical than the one proposed by Mazarin. The Cardinal depended totally on Anne's support and had to use all his influence on the Queen to temper some of her radical actions. Anne imprisoned any aristocrat or member of parliament who challenged her will; her main aim was to transfer to her son an absolute authority in the matters of finance and justice. One of the leaders of the Parlement of Paris, whom she had jailed, died in prison.[22]\n\n\nThe **Frondeurs**, political heirs of the disaffected feudal aristocracy, sought to protect their traditional feudal privileges from the increasingly centralized royal government. Furthermore, they believed their traditional influence and authority was being usurped by the recently ennobled bureaucrats (the **Noblesse de Robe**, or \"nobility of the robe\"), who administered the kingdom and on whom the monarchy increasingly began to rely. This belief intensified the nobles' resentment.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1648, Anne and Mazarin attempted to tax members of the **Parlement de Paris**. The members refused to comply and ordered all of the king's earlier financial edicts burned. Buoyed by the victory of *Louis, duc d'Enghien* (later known as **le Grand Condé**) at the Battle of Lens, Mazarin, on Queen Anne's insistence, arrested certain members in a show of force.[23] The most important arrest, from Anne's point of view, concerned Pierre Broussel, one of the most important leaders in the **Parlement de Paris**.\n\n\n\n![](image)1655 portrait of Louis, the Victor of the Fronde, portrayed as the god Jupiter\nPeople in France were complaining about the expansion of royal authority, the high rate of taxation, and the reduction of the authority of the Parlement de Paris and other regional representative entities. Paris erupted in rioting as a result, and Anne was forced, under intense pressure, to free Broussel. Moreover, on the night of 9–10 February 1651, when Louis was twelve, a mob of angry Parisians broke into the royal palace and demanded to see their king. Led into the royal bed-chamber, they gazed upon Louis, who was feigning sleep, were appeased, and then quietly departed.[24] The threat to the royal family prompted Anne to flee Paris with the king and his courtiers.\n\n\nShortly thereafter, the conclusion of the Peace of Westphalia allowed Condé's army to return to aid Louis and his court. Condé's family was close to Anne at that time, and he agreed to help her attempt to restore the king's authority.[25] The queen's army, headed by Condé, attacked the rebels in Paris; the rebels were under the political control of Anne's old friend Marie de Rohan. Beaufort, who had escaped from the prison where Anne had incarcerated him five years before, was the military leader in Paris, under the nominal control of Conti. After a few battles, a political compromise was reached; the Peace of Rueil was signed, and the court returned to Paris.\n\n\nUnfortunately for Anne, her partial victory depended on Condé, who wanted to control the queen and destroy Mazarin's influence. It was Condé's sister who pushed him to turn against the queen. After striking a deal with her old friend Marie de Rohan, who was able to impose the nomination of *Charles de l'Aubespine, marquis de Châteauneuf* as minister of justice, Anne arrested Condé, his brother Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti, and the husband of their sister Anne Genevieve de Bourbon, duchess of Longueville. This situation did not last long, and Mazarin's unpopularity led to the creation of a coalition headed mainly by Marie de Rohan and the duchess of Longueville. This aristocratic coalition was strong enough to liberate the princes, exile Mazarin, and impose a condition of virtual house arrest on Queen Anne.\n\n\n\n![](image)Portrait by Justus van Egmont between the years 1649-1652.\nAll these events were witnessed by Louis and largely explained his later distrust of Paris and the higher aristocracy.[26] \"In one sense, Louis' childhood came to an end with the outbreak of the Fronde. It was not only that life became insecure and unpleasant – a fate meted out to many children in all ages – but that Louis had to be taken into the confidence of his mother and Mazarin on political and military matters of which he could have no deep understanding\".[27] \"The family home became at times a near-prison when Paris had to be abandoned, not in carefree outings to other chateaux but in humiliating flights\".[27] The royal family was driven out of Paris twice in this manner, and at one point Louis XIV and Anne were held under virtual arrest in the royal palace in Paris. The Fronde years planted in Louis a hatred of Paris and a consequent determination to move out of the ancient capital as soon as possible, never to return.[28]\n\n\nJust as the first **Fronde** (the **Fronde parlementaire** of 1648–1649) ended, a second one (the **Fronde des princes** of 1650–1653) began. Unlike that which preceded it, tales of sordid intrigue and half-hearted warfare characterized this second phase of upper-class insurrection. To the aristocracy, this rebellion represented a protest for the reversal of their political demotion from vassals to courtiers. It was headed by the highest-ranking French nobles, among them Louis' uncle Gaston, Duke of Orléans and first cousin Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier, known as **la Grande Mademoiselle**; Princes of the Blood such as Condé, his brother Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti, and their sister the Duchess of Longueville; dukes of legitimised royal descent, such as Henri, Duke of Longueville, and François, Duke of Beaufort; so-called \"foreign princes\" such as Frédéric Maurice, Duke of Bouillon, his brother Marshal Turenne, and Marie de Rohan, Duchess of Chevreuse; and scions of France's oldest families, such as François de La Rochefoucauld.\n\n\nQueen Anne played the most important role in defeating the Fronde because she wanted to transfer absolute authority to her son. In addition, most of the princes refused to deal with Mazarin, who went into exile for a number of years. The **Frondeurs** claimed to act on Louis' behalf, and in his real interest, against his mother and Mazarin.\n\n\nQueen Anne had a very close relationship with the Cardinal, and many observers believed that Mazarin became Louis XIV's stepfather by a secret marriage to Queen Anne.[29] However, Louis' coming-of-age and subsequent coronation deprived them of the **Frondeurs**' pretext for revolt. The **Fronde** thus gradually lost steam and ended in 1653, when Mazarin returned triumphantly from exile. From that time until his death, Mazarin was in charge of foreign and financial policy without the daily supervision of Anne, who was no longer regent.[30]\n\n\nDuring this period, Louis fell in love with Mazarin's niece Marie Mancini, but Anne and Mazarin ended the king's infatuation by sending Mancini away from court to be married in Italy. While Mazarin might have been tempted for a short period of time to marry his niece to the King of France, Queen Anne was absolutely against this; she wanted to marry her son to the daughter of her brother, Philip IV of Spain, for both dynastic and political reasons. Mazarin soon supported the Queen's position because he knew that her support for his power and his foreign policy depended on making peace with Spain from a strong position and on the Spanish marriage. Additionally, Mazarin's relations with Marie Mancini were not good, and he did not trust her to support his position. All of Louis' tears and his supplications to his mother did not make her change her mind. The Spanish marriage would be very important both for its role in ending the war between France and Spain, because many of the claims and objectives of Louis' foreign policy for the next 50 years would be based upon this marriage, and because it was through this marriage that the Spanish throne would ultimately be delivered to the House of Bourbon (which holds it to this day).[31]\n\n\n\n## Personal reign and reforms[edit]\n\n\n### Coming of age and early reforms[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Royal Monogram\nLouis XIV was declared to have reached the age of majority on the 7th of September 1651. On the death of Mazarin, in March 1661, Louis assumed personal control of the reins of government and astonished his court by declaring that he would rule without a chief minister: \"Up to this moment I have been pleased to entrust the government of my affairs to the late Cardinal. It is now time that I govern them myself. You (he was talking to the secretaries and ministers of state) will assist me with your counsels when I ask for them. I request and order you to seal no orders except by my command . . . I order you not to sign anything, not even a passport . . . without my command; to render account to me personally each day and to favor no one\".[32] Louis was able to capitalize on the widespread public yearning for law and order, that resulted from prolonged foreign wars and domestic civil strife, to further consolidate central political authority and reform at the expense of the feudal aristocracy. Praising his ability to choose and encourage men of talent, the historian Chateaubriand noted: \"it is the voice of genius of all kinds which sounds from the tomb of Louis\".[33]\n\n\nLouis began his personal reign with administrative and fiscal reforms. In 1661, the treasury verged on bankruptcy. To rectify the situation, Louis chose Jean-Baptiste Colbert as Controller-General of Finances in 1665. However, Louis first had to neutralize Nicolas Fouquet, the Superintendent of Finances, in order to give Colbert a free hand. Although Fouquet's financial indiscretions were not very different from Mazarin's before him or Colbert's after him, his ambition was worrying to Louis. He had, for example, built an opulent château at Vaux-le-Vicomte where he entertained Louis and his court ostentatiously, as if he were wealthier than the king himself. The court was left with the impression that the vast sums of money needed to support his lifestyle could only have been obtained through embezzlement of government funds.\n\n\nFouquet appeared eager to succeed Mazarin and Richelieu in assuming power, and he indiscreetly purchased and privately fortified the remote island of Belle Île. These acts sealed his doom. Fouquet was charged with embezzlement. The *Parlement* found him guilty and sentenced him to exile. However, Louis altered the sentence to life imprisonment and abolished Fouquet's post.\n\n\nWith Fouquet dismissed, Colbert reduced the national debt through more efficient taxation. The principal taxes included the *aides* and *douanes* (both customs duties), the *gabelle* (a tax on salt), and the *taille* (a tax on land). The *taille* was reduced at first; financial officials were forced to keep regular accounts, auctioning certain taxes instead of selling them privately to a favoured few, revising inventories and removing unauthorized exemptions (for example, in 1661 only 10 per cent from the royal domain reached the King). Reform proved difficult because the *taille* was levied by officers of the Crown who had purchased their post at a high price: punishment of abuses necessarily lowered the value of the post. Nevertheless, excellent results were achieved: the deficit of 1661 turned into a surplus in 1666. The interest on the debt was reduced from 52 million to 24 million livres. The *taille* was reduced to 42 million in 1661 and 35 million in 1665; finally the revenue from indirect taxation progressed from 26 million to 55 million. The revenues of the royal domain were raised from 80,000 livres in 1661 to 5.5 million livres in 1671. In 1661, the receipts were equivalent to 26 million British pounds, of which 10 million reached the treasury. The expenditure was around 18 million pounds, leaving a deficit of 8 million. In 1667, the net receipts had risen to 20 million pounds sterling, while expenditure had fallen to 11 million, leaving a surplus of 9 million pounds.\n\n\n\n![](image)Engraving of Louis XIV\nTo support the reorganized and enlarged army, the panoply of Versailles, and the growing civil administration, the king needed a good deal of money. Finance had always been the weak spot in the French monarchy: methods of collecting taxes were costly and inefficient; direct taxes passed through the hands of many intermediate officials; and indirect taxes were collected by private concessionaries, called tax farmers, who made a substantial profit. Consequently, the state always received far less than what the taxpayers actually paid.\n\n\nThe main weakness arose from an old bargain between the French crown and nobility: the king might raise taxes without consent if only he refrained from taxing the nobles. Only the \"unprivileged\" classes paid direct taxes, and this term came to mean the peasants only, since many bourgeois, in one way or another, obtained exemptions.\n\n\nThe system was outrageously unjust in throwing a heavy tax burden on the poor and helpless. Later, after 1700, the French ministers who were supported by Louis' secret wife Madame de Maintenon, were able to convince the king to change his fiscal policy. Louis was willing enough to tax the nobles but was unwilling to fall under their control, and only towards the close of his reign, under extreme stress of war, was he able, for the first time in French history, to impose direct taxes on the aristocratic elements of the population. This was a step toward equality before the law and toward sound public finance, but so many concessions and exemptions were won by nobles and bourgeois that the reform lost much of its value.[34]\n\n\nLouis and Colbert also had wide-ranging plans to bolster French commerce and trade. Colbert's mercantilist administration established new industries and encouraged manufacturers and inventors, such as the Lyon silk manufacturers and the Gobelins manufactory, a producer of tapestries. He invited manufacturers and artisans from all over Europe to France, such as Murano glassmakers, Swedish ironworkers, and Dutch shipbuilders. In this way, he aimed to decrease foreign imports while increasing French exports, hence reducing the net outflow of precious metals from France.\n\n\nLouis instituted reforms in military administration through Michel le Tellier and the latter's son François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois. They helped to curb the independent spirit of the nobility, imposing order on them at court and in the army. Gone were the days when generals protracted war at the frontiers while bickering over precedence and ignoring orders from the capital and the larger politico-diplomatic picture. The old military aristocracy (the *Noblesse d'épée*, or \"nobility of the sword\") ceased to have a monopoly over senior military positions and rank. Louvois, in particular, pledged to modernize the army and re-organize it into a professional, disciplined, well-trained force. He was devoted to the soldiers' material well-being and morale, and even tried to direct campaigns.\n\n\n\n### Relations with the major colonies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Louis and his family portrayed as Roman gods in a 1670 painting by Jean Nocret. L to R: Louis' aunt, Henriette-Marie; his brother, Philippe, duc d'Orléans; the Duke's daughter, Marie Louise d'Orléans, and wife, Henriette-Anne Stuart; the Queen-mother, Anne of Austria; three daughters of Gaston d'Orléans; Louis XIV; the Dauphin Louis; Queen Marie-Thérèse; *la Grande Mademoiselle*.\nLegal matters did not escape Louis' attention, as is reflected in the numerous \"Great Ordinances\" he enacted. Pre-revolutionary France was a patchwork of legal systems, with as many legal customs as there were provinces, and two co-existing legal traditions—customary law in the north and Roman civil law in the south.[35] The *Grande Ordonnance de Procédure Civile* of 1667, also known as the *Code Louis*, was a comprehensive legal code attempting a uniform regulation of civil procedure throughout legally irregular France. Among other things, it prescribed baptismal, marriage and death records in the state's registers, not the church's, and it strictly regulated the right of the *Parlements* to remonstrate.[36] The *Code Louis* played an important part in French legal history as the basis for the Napoleonic code, from which many modern legal codes are, in turn, derived.\n\n\nOne of Louis' more infamous decrees was the *Grande Ordonnance sur les Colonies* of 1685, also known as the *Code Noir* (\"black code\"). Although it sanctioned slavery, it attempted to humanise the practice by prohibiting the separation of families. Additionally, in the colonies, only Roman Catholics could own slaves, and these had to be baptised.\n\n\nLouis ruled through a number of councils:\n\n\n\n* Conseil d'en haut (\"High Council\", concerning the most important matters of state)—composed of the king, the crown prince, the controller-general of finances, and the secretaries of state in charge of various departments. The members of that council were called ministers of state.\n* Conseil des dépêches (\"Council of Messages\", concerning notices and administrative reports from the provinces).\n* Conseil de Conscience (\"Council of Conscience\", concerning religious affairs and episcopal appointments).\n* Conseil royal des finances (\"Royal Council of Finances\") who was headed by the \"chef du conseil des finances\" (an honorary post in most cases)—this was one of the few posts in the council that was opened to the high aristocracy.[37]\n\n\n## Early wars in the Low Countries[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: War of Devolution and Franco-Dutch War\n\n### Spain[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Louis XIV in 1670, engraved portrait by Robert Nanteuil\n![](image)The future Philip V being introduced as king of Spain by his grandfather, Louis XIV\nThe death of his maternal uncle King Philip IV of Spain, in 1665, precipitated the War of Devolution. In 1660, Louis had married Philip IV's eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, as one of the provisions of the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees.[38] The marriage treaty specified that Maria Theresa was to renounce all claims to Spanish territory for herself and all her descendants.[38] Mazarin and Lionne, however, made the renunciation conditional on the full payment of a Spanish dowry of 500,000 écus.[39] The dowry was never paid and would later play a part persuading his maternal first cousin Charles II of Spain to leave his empire to Philip, Duke of Anjou (later Philip V of Spain), the grandson of Louis XIV and Maria Theresa.\n\n\nIn fact, the War of Devolution did not focus on the payment of the dowry; rather, the lack of payment was what Louis XIV used as a pretext for nullifying Maria Theresa's renunciation of her claims, allowing the land to \"devolve\" to him. In Brabant (the location of the land in dispute), children of first marriages traditionally were not disadvantaged by their parents' remarriages and still inherited property. Louis' wife was Philip IV's daughter by his first marriage, while the new king of Spain, Charles II, was his son by a subsequent marriage. Thus, Brabant allegedly \"devolved\" to Maria Theresa, giving France a justification to attack the Spanish Netherlands.\n\n\n\n### Relations with the Dutch[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Battle of Tolhuis, Louis XIV crosses the Lower Rhine at Lobith on 12 June 1672; Rijksmuseum Amsterdam\nDuring the Eighty Years' War with Spain, France supported the Dutch Republic as part of a general policy of opposing Habsburg power. Johan de Witt, Dutch Grand Pensionary from 1653 to 1672, viewed this as crucial for Dutch security and a counterweight against his domestic Orangist opponents. Louis provided support in the 1665-1667 Second Anglo-Dutch War but used the opportunity to launch the War of Devolution in 1667. This captured Franche-Comté and much of the Spanish Netherlands; French expansion in this area was a direct threat to Dutch economic interests.[40]\n\n\nThe Dutch opened talks with Charles II of England on a common diplomatic front against France, leading to the Triple Alliance, between England, the Dutch and Sweden. The threat of an escalation and a secret treaty to divide Spanish possessions with Emperor Leopold, the other major claimant to the throne of Spain, led Louis to relinquish many of his gains in the 1668 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.[41]\n\n\nLouis placed little reliance on his agreement with Leopold and as it was now clear French and Dutch aims were in direct conflict, he decided to first defeat the Republic, then seize the Spanish Netherlands. This required breaking up the Triple Alliance; he paid Sweden to remain neutral and signed the 1670 Secret Treaty of Dover with Charles, an Anglo-French alliance against the Dutch Republic. In May 1672, France invaded the Republic, supported by Münster and the Electorate of Cologne.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Louis XIV, 1670, by Claude Lefèbvre\nRapid French advance led to a coup that toppled De Witt and brought William III to power. Leopold viewed French expansion into the Rhineland as an increasing threat, especially after their seizure of the strategic Duchy of Lorraine in 1670. The prospect of Dutch defeat led Leopold to an alliance with Brandenburg-Prussia on 23 June, followed by another with the Republic on 25th.[43] Although Brandenburg was forced out of the war by the June 1673 Treaty of Vossem, in August an anti-French alliance was formed by the Dutch, Spain, Emperor Leopold and the Duke of Lorraine.[44]\n\n\nThe French alliance was deeply unpopular in England, and only more so after the disappointing battles against Michiel de Ruyter's fleet. Charles II of England made peace with the Dutch in the February 1674 Treaty of Westminster. However, French armies held significant advantages over their opponents; an undivided command, talented generals like Turenne, Condé and Luxembourg and vastly superior logistics. Reforms introduced by Louvois, the Secretary of War, helped maintain large field armies that could be mobilised much more quickly, allowing them to mount offensives in early spring before their opponents were ready.[45]\n\n\nThe French were nevertheless forced to retreat from most of the Dutch Republic, which deeply shocked Louis; he retreated to St Germain for while, where no one, except a few intimates, were allowed to disturb him.[46] French military advantages allowed them however to hold their ground in Alsace and the Spanish Netherlands while retaking Franche-Comté. By 1678, mutual exhaustion led to the Treaty of Nijmegen, which was generally settled in France's favour and allowed Louis to intervene in the Scanian War. Despite military defeat, his ally Sweden regained much of what they had lost under the 1679 treaties of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Fontainebleau and Lund imposed on Denmark–Norway and Brandenburg.[47] Yet Louis' two primary goals, the destruction of the Dutch Republic and the conquest of the Spanish Netherlands, had failed.[48]\n\n\nLouis was at the height of his power, but at the cost of uniting his opponents; this increased as he continued his expansion. In 1679, he dismissed his foreign minister Simon Arnauld, marquis de Pomponne, because he was seen as having compromised too much with the allies. Louis maintained the strength of his army, but in his next series of territorial claims avoided using military force alone. Rather, he combined it with legal pretexts in his efforts to augment the boundaries of his kingdom. Contemporary treaties were intentionally phrased ambiguously. Louis established the Chambers of Reunion to determine the full extent of his rights and obligations under those treaties.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Silver coin of Louis XIV, dated 1674\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Obverse.

The Latin inscription is *FRAN[CIÆ] ET NAVARRÆ REX 1674* (\"King of France and of Navarre, 1674\").\n |\n\n\nCities and territories, such as Luxembourg and Casale, were prized for their strategic positions on the frontier and access to important waterways. Louis also sought Strasbourg, an important strategic crossing on the left bank of the Rhine and theretofore a Free Imperial City of the Holy Roman Empire, annexing it and other territories in 1681. Although a part of Alsace, Strasbourg was not part of Habsburg-ruled Alsace and was thus not ceded to France in the Peace of Westphalia.\n\n\nFollowing these annexations, Spain declared war, precipitating the War of the Reunions. However, the Spanish were rapidly defeated because the Emperor (distracted by the Great Turkish War) abandoned them, and the Dutch only supported them minimally. By the Truce of Ratisbon, in 1684, Spain was forced to acquiesce in the French occupation of most of the conquered territories, for 20 years.[49]\n\n\nLouis' policy of the *Réunions* may have raised France to its greatest size and power during his reign, but it alienated much of Europe. This poor public opinion was compounded by French actions off the Barbary Coast and at Genoa. First, Louis had Algiers and Tripoli, two Barbary pirate strongholds, bombarded to obtain a favourable treaty and the liberation of Christian slaves. Next, in 1684, a punitive mission was launched against Genoa in retaliation for its support for Spain in previous wars. Although the Genoese submitted, and the Doge led an official mission of apology to Versailles, France gained a reputation for brutality and arrogance. European apprehension at growing French might and the realisation of the extent of the dragonnades' effect (discussed below) led many states to abandon their alliances with France.[50] Accordingly, by the late 1680s, France became increasingly isolated in Europe.\n\n\n\n### Non-European relations and the colonies[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: French colonial empire and Orientalism in early modern France\n\n![](image)The Persian embassy to Louis XIV sent by Soltan Hoseyn in 1715. *Ambassade de Perse auprès de Louis XIV*, studio of Antoine Coypel.\nFrench colonies multiplied in Africa, the Americas, and Asia during Louis' reign, and French explorers made important discoveries in North America. In 1673, Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette discovered the Mississippi River. In 1682, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, followed the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico and claimed the vast Mississippi basin in Louis' name, calling it *Louisiane*. French trading posts were also established in India, at Chandernagore and Pondicherry, and in the Indian Ocean at Île Bourbon. Throughout these regions Louis and Colbert embarked on an extensive program of architecture and urbanism meant to reflect the styles of Versailles and Paris and the 'gloire' of the realm.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)Siamese embassy of King Narai to Louis XIV in 1686, led by Kosa Pan. Engraving by Nicolas Larmessin.\nMeanwhile, diplomatic relations were initiated with distant countries. In 1669, Suleiman Aga led an Ottoman embassy to revive the old Franco-Ottoman alliance.[52] Then, in 1682, after the reception of the Moroccan embassy of Mohammed Tenim in France, Moulay Ismail, Sultan of Morocco, allowed French consular and commercial establishments in his country.[53] In 1699, Louis once again received a Moroccan ambassador, Abdallah bin Aisha, and in 1715, he received a Persian embassy led by Mohammad Reza Beg.\n\n\nFrom farther afield, Siam dispatched an embassy in 1684, reciprocated by the French magnificently the next year under Alexandre, Chevalier de Chaumont. This, in turn, was succeeded by another Siamese embassy under Kosa Pan, superbly received at Versailles in 1686. Louis then sent another embassy in 1687, under Simon de la Loubère, and French influence grew at the Siamese court, which granted Mergui as a naval base to France. However, the death of Narai, King of Ayutthaya, the execution of his pro-French minister Constantine Phaulkon, and the siege of Bangkok in 1688 ended this era of French influence.[54]\n\n\nFrance also attempted to participate actively in Jesuit missions to China. To break the Portuguese dominance there, Louis sent Jesuit missionaries to the court of the Kangxi Emperor in 1685: Jean de Fontaney, Joachim Bouvet, Jean-François Gerbillon, Louis Le Comte, and Claude de Visdelou.[55] Louis also received a Chinese Jesuit, Michael Shen Fu-Tsung, at Versailles in 1684.[56] Furthermore, Louis' librarian and translator Arcadio Huang was Chinese.[57][58]\n\n\n\n## Height of power[edit]\n\n\n### Centralisation of power[edit]\n\n\nBy the early 1680s, Louis had greatly augmented French influence in the world. Domestically, he successfully increased the influence of the crown and its authority over the church and aristocracy, thus consolidating absolute monarchy in France.\n\n\nLouis initially supported traditional Gallicanism, which limited papal authority in France, and convened an Assembly of the French clergy in November 1681. Before its dissolution eight months later, the Assembly had accepted the Declaration of the Clergy of France, which increased royal authority at the expense of papal power. Without royal approval, bishops could not leave France, and appeals could not be made to the pope. Additionally, government officials could not be excommunicated for acts committed in pursuance of their duties. Although the king could not make ecclesiastical law, all papal regulations without royal assent were invalid in France. Unsurprisingly, the Pope repudiated the Declaration.[4]\n\n\n\n![](image)Louis receiving the Doge of Genoa at Versailles on 15 May 1685, following the Bombardment of Genoa. (*Reparation faite à Louis XIV par le Doge de Gênes. 15 mai 1685* by Claude Guy Halle, Versailles.)\nBy attaching nobles to his court at Versailles, Louis achieved increased control over the French aristocracy. According to historian Philip Mansel, the king turned the palace into:\n\n\n\nan irresistible combination of marriage market, employment agency and entertainment capital of aristocratic Europe, boasting the best theatre, opera, music, gambling, sex and (most important) hunting.[59]\nApartments were built to house those willing to pay court to the king.[60] However, the pensions and privileges necessary to live in a style appropriate to their rank were only possible by waiting constantly on Louis.[61] For this purpose, an elaborate court ritual was created wherein the king became the centre of attention and was observed throughout the day by the public. With his excellent memory, Louis could then see who attended him at court and who was absent, facilitating the subsequent distribution of favours and positions. Another tool Louis used to control his nobility was censorship, which often involved the opening of letters to discern their author's opinion of the government and king.[60] Moreover, by entertaining, impressing, and domesticating them with extravagant luxury and other distractions, Louis not only cultivated public opinion of him, but he also ensured the aristocracy remained under his scrutiny.\n\n\nLouis's extravagance at Versailles extended far beyond the scope of elaborate court rituals. He took delivery of an African elephant as a gift from the king of Portugal.[62] He encouraged leading nobles to live at Versailles. This, along with the prohibition of private armies, prevented them from passing time on their own estates and in their regional power bases, from which they historically waged local wars and plotted resistance to royal authority. Louis thus compelled and seduced the old military aristocracy (the \"nobility of the sword\") into becoming his ceremonial courtiers, further weakening their power. In their place, he raised commoners or the more recently ennobled bureaucratic aristocracy (the \"nobility of the robe\"). He judged that royal authority thrived more surely by filling high executive and administrative positions with these men because they could be more easily dismissed than nobles of ancient lineage and entrenched influence. It is believed that Louis's policies were rooted in his experiences during the *Fronde*, when men of high birth readily took up the rebel cause against their king, who was actually the kinsman of some. This victory over the nobility may thus have ensured the end of major civil wars in France until the French Revolution about a century later.\n\n\n\n### France as the pivot of warfare[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Louis XIV\nUnder Louis, France was the leading European power, and most wars pivoted around its aggressiveness. No European state exceeded it in population, and no one could match its wealth, central location, and very strong professional army. It had largely avoided the devastation of the Thirty Years' War. Its weaknesses included an inefficient financial system that was hard-pressed to pay for its military adventures, and the tendency of most other powers to gang up against it.\n\n\nDuring Louis's reign, France fought three major wars: the Franco-Dutch War, the War of the League of Augsburg, and the War of the Spanish Succession. There were also two lesser conflicts: the War of Devolution and the War of the Reunions.[63] The wars were very expensive but defined Louis XIV's foreign policy, and his personality shaped his approach. Impelled \"by a mix of commerce, revenge, and pique\", Louis sensed that war was the ideal way to enhance his glory. In peacetime he concentrated on preparing for the next war. He taught his diplomats that their job was to create tactical and strategic advantages for the French military.[5] By 1695, France retained much of its dominance but had lost control of the seas to England and Holland, and most countries, both Protestant and Catholic, were in alliance against it. Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, France's leading military strategist, warned Louis in 1689 that a hostile \"Alliance\" was too powerful at sea. He recommended that France fight back by licensing French merchants ships to privateer and seize enemy merchant ships while avoiding its navies:\n\n\n\nFrance has its declared enemies Germany and all the states that it embraces; Spain with all its dependencies in Europe, Asia, Africa and America; the Duke of Savoy [in Italy], England, Scotland, Ireland, and all their colonies in the East and West Indies; and Holland with all its possessions in the four corners of the world where it has great establishments. France has ... undeclared enemies, indirectly hostile, hostile, and envious of its greatness, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Portugal, Venice, Genoa, and part of the Swiss Confederation, all of which states secretly aid France's enemies by the troops that they hire to them, the money they lend them and by protecting and covering their trade.[64]\nVauban was pessimistic about France's so-called friends and allies:\n\n\n\nFor lukewarm, useless, or impotent friends, France has the Pope, who is indifferent; the King of England [James II] expelled from his country; the Grand Duke of Tuscany; the Dukes of Mantua, Modena, and Parma [all in Italy]; and the other faction of the Swiss. Some of these are sunk in the softness that comes of years of peace, the others are cool in their affections....The English and Dutch are the main pillars of the Alliance; they support it by making war against us in concert with the other powers, and they keep it going by means of the money that they pay every year to... Allies.... We must therefore fall back on privateering as the method of conducting war which is most feasible, simple, cheap, and safe, and which will cost least to the state, the more so since any losses will not be felt by the King, who risks virtually nothing....It will enrich the country, train many good officers for the King, and in a short time force his enemies to sue for peace.[65]\n## Edict of Fontainebleau[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edict of Fontainebleau\n\n![](image)Louis XIV in 1685, the year he revoked the Edict of Nantes\nLouis decided to persecute Protestants and revoke the 1598 Edict of Nantes, which awarded Huguenots political and religious freedom. He saw the persistence of Protestantism as a disgraceful reminder of royal powerlessness. After all, the Edict was the pragmatic concession of his grandfather Henry IV to end the longstanding French Wars of Religion. An additional factor in Louis' thinking was the prevailing contemporary European principle to assure socio-political stability, *cuius regio, eius religio* (\"whose realm, his religion\"), the idea that the religion of the ruler should be the religion of the realm (as originally confirmed in central Europe in the Peace of Augsburg of 1555).[66]\n\n\nResponding to petitions, Louis initially excluded Protestants from office, constrained the meeting of synods, closed churches outside of Edict-stipulated areas, banned Protestant outdoor preachers, and prohibited domestic Protestant migration. He also disallowed Protestant-Catholic intermarriages to which third parties objected, encouraged missions to the Protestants, and rewarded converts to Catholicism.[67] This discrimination did not encounter much Protestant resistance, and a steady conversion of Protestants occurred, especially among the noble elites.\n\n\nIn 1681, Louis dramatically increased his persecution of Protestants. The principle of *cuius regio, eius religio* generally had also meant that subjects who refused to convert could emigrate, but Louis banned emigration and effectively insisted that all Protestants must be converted. Secondly, following the proposal of René de Marillac and the Marquis of Louvois, he began quartering dragoons in Protestant homes. Although this was within his legal rights, the *dragonnades* inflicted severe financial strain on Protestants and atrocious abuse. Between 300,000 and 400,000 Huguenots converted, as this entailed financial rewards and exemption from the *dragonnades*.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)Protestant peasants rebelled against the officially sanctioned *dragonnades* (conversions enforced by dragoons, labeled \"missionaries in boots\") that followed the Edict of Fontainebleau.\nOn 15 October 1685, Louis issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, which cited the redundancy of privileges for Protestants given their scarcity after the extensive conversions. The Edict of Fontainebleau revoked the Edict of Nantes and repealed all the privileges that arose therefrom.[4] By his edict, Louis no longer tolerated the existence of Protestant groups, pastors, or churches in France. No further churches were to be constructed, and those already existing were to be demolished. Pastors could choose either exile or secular life. Those Protestants who had resisted conversion were now to be baptised forcibly into the established church.[69]\n\n\nHistorians have debated Louis' reasons for issuing the Edict of Fontainebleau. He may have been seeking to placate Pope Innocent XI, with whom relations were tense and whose aid was necessary to determine the outcome of a succession crisis in the Electorate of Cologne. He may also have acted to upstage Emperor Leopold I and regain international prestige after the latter defeated the Turks without Louis' help. Otherwise, he may simply have desired to end the remaining divisions in French society dating to the Wars of Religion by fulfilling his coronation oath to eradicate heresy.[70][71]\n\n\nMany historians have condemned the Edict of Fontainebleau as gravely harmful to France.[72] In support, they cite the emigration of about 200,000 highly skilled Huguenots (roughly one quarter of the Protestant population, or 1% of the French population) who defied royal decrees and fled France for various Protestant states, weakening the French economy and enriching that of Protestant states. On the other hand, there are historians who view this as an exaggeration. They argue that most of France's preeminent Protestant businessmen and industrialists converted to Catholicism and remained.[73]\n\n\nWhat is certain is that reaction to the Edict was mixed. Even while French Catholic leaders exulted, Pope Innocent XI still argued with Louis over Gallicanism and criticized the use of violence. Protestants across Europe were horrified at the treatment of their co-religionists, but most Catholics in France applauded the move. Nonetheless, it is indisputable that Louis' public image in most of Europe, especially in Protestant regions, was dealt a severe blow.\n\n\nIn the end, however, despite renewed tensions with the Camisards of south-central France at the end of his reign, Louis may have helped ensure that his successor would experience fewer instances of the religion-based disturbances that had plagued his forebears. French society would sufficiently change by the time of his descendant, Louis XVI, to welcome tolerance in the form of the 1787 Edict of Versailles, also known as the Edict of Tolerance. This restored to non-Catholics their civil rights and the freedom to worship openly.[74] With the advent of the French Revolution in 1789, Protestants were granted equal rights with their Roman Catholic counterparts.\n\n\n\n## Nine Years' War[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nine Years' War\n\n### Causes and conduct of the war[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Battle of Fleurus, 1690\n![](image)Louis in 1690\nThe Nine Years' War, which lasted from 1688 to 1697, initiated a period of decline in Louis's political and diplomatic fortunes. It arose from two events in the Rhineland. First, in 1685, the Elector Palatine Charles II died. All that remained of his immediate family was Louis's sister-in-law, Elizabeth Charlotte. German law ostensibly barred her from succeeding to her brother's lands and electoral dignity, but it was unclear enough for arguments in favour of Elizabeth Charlotte to have a chance of success. Conversely, the princess was clearly entitled to a division of the family's personal property. Louis pressed her claims to land and chattels, hoping the latter, at least, would be given to her.[75] Then, in 1688, Maximilian Henry of Bavaria, Archbishop of Cologne, an ally of France, died. The archbishopric had traditionally been held by the Wittelsbachs of Bavaria, but the Bavarian claimant to replace Maximilian Henry, Prince Joseph Clemens of Bavaria, was at that time not more than 17 years old and not even ordained. Louis sought instead to install his own candidate, Wilhelm Egon von Fürstenberg, to ensure the key Rhenish state remained an ally.[76]\n\n\nIn light of his foreign and domestic policies during the early 1680s, which were perceived as aggressive, Louis's actions, fostered by the succession crises of the late 1680s, created concern and alarm in much of Europe. This led to the formation of the 1686 League of Augsburg by the Holy Roman Emperor, Spain, Sweden, Saxony, and Bavaria. Their stated intention was to return France to at least the borders agreed to in the Treaty of Nijmegen.[77] Emperor Leopold I's persistent refusal to convert the Truce of Ratisbon into a permanent treaty fed Louis's fears that the Emperor would turn on France and attack the Reunions after settling his affairs in the Balkans.[78]\n\n\nAnother event Louis found threatening was England's Glorious Revolution of 1688. Although King James II was Catholic, his two Anglican daughters, Mary and Anne, ensured the English people a Protestant succession. But when James II's son James Francis Edward Stuart was born, he took precedence in succession over his sisters. This seemed to herald an era of Catholic monarchs in England. Protestant lords called on the Dutch Prince William III of Orange, grandson of Charles I of England, to come to their aid. He sailed for England with troops despite Louis's warning that France would regard it as a provocation. Witnessing numerous desertions and defections, even among those closest to him, James II fled England. Parliament declared the throne vacant, and offered it to James's daughter Mary II and his son-in-law and nephew William. Vehemently anti-French, William (now William III of England) pushed his new kingdoms into war, thus transforming the League of Augsburg into the Grand Alliance. Before this happened, Louis expected William's expedition to England to absorb his energies and those of his allies, so he dispatched troops to the Rhineland after the expiry of his ultimatum to the German princes requiring confirmation of the Truce of Ratisbon and acceptance of his demands about the succession crises. This military manoeuvre was also intended to protect his eastern provinces from Imperial invasion by depriving the enemy army of sustenance, thus explaining the preemptive scorched earth policy pursued in much of southwestern Germany (the \"Devastation of the Palatinate\").[79]\n\n\n\n![](image)Louis XIV at the siege of Namur (1692)\nFrench armies were generally victorious throughout the war because of Imperial commitments in the Balkans, French logistical superiority, and the quality of French generals such as Condé's famous pupil, François Henri de Montmorency-Bouteville, duc de Luxembourg.[80] He triumphed at the Battles of Fleurus in 1690, Steenkerque in 1692, and Landen in 1693, although, the battles proved to be of little of strategic consequence,[81][82] mostly due to the nature of late 17th-century warfare.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Marshal de Luxembourg\nAlthough an attempt to restore James II failed at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, France accumulated a string of victories from Flanders in the north, Germany in the east, and Italy and Spain in the south, to the high seas and the colonies. Louis personally supervised the captures of Mons in 1691 and Namur in 1692. Luxembourg gave France the defensive line of the Sambre by capturing Charleroi in 1693. France also overran most of the Duchy of Savoy after the battles of Marsaglia and Staffarde in 1693. While naval stalemate ensued after the French victory at the Battle of Beachy Head in 1690 and the Allied victory at Barfleur-La Hougue in 1692, the Battle of Torroella in 1694 exposed Catalonia to French invasion, culminating in the capture of Barcelona. The Dutch captured Pondichéry in 1693, but a 1697 French raid on the Spanish treasure port of Cartagena, Spain, yielded a fortune of 10,000,000 livres.\n\n\nIn July 1695, the city of Namur, occupied for three years by the French, was besieged by an allied army led by William III. Louis XIV ordered the surprise destruction of a Flemish city to divert the attention of these troops. This led to the bombardment of Brussels, in which more than 4,000 buildings were destroyed, including the entire city centre. The strategy failed, as Namur fell three weeks later, but harmed Louis XIV's reputation: a century later, Napoleon deemed the bombardment \"as barbarous as it was useless\".[84]\n\n\nPeace was broached by Sweden in 1690. By 1692, both sides evidently wanted peace, and secret bilateral talks began, but to no avail.[85] Louis tried to break up the alliance against him by dealing with individual opponents but did not achieve his aim until 1696 when the Savoyards agreed to the Treaty of Turin and switched sides. Thereafter, members of the League of Augsburg rushed to the peace table, and negotiations for a general peace began in earnest, culminating in the Peace of Ryswick of 1697.[86]\n\n\n\n### Peace of Ryswick[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Peace of Ryswick\n\nThe Peace of Ryswick ended the War of the League of Augsburg and disbanded the Grand Alliance. By manipulating their rivalries and suspicions, Louis divided his enemies and broke their power.\n\n\nThe treaty yielded many benefits for France. Louis secured permanent French sovereignty over all of Alsace, including Strasbourg, and established the Rhine as the Franco-German border (as it is to this day). Pondichéry and Acadia were returned to France, and Louis's *de facto* possession of Saint-Domingue was recognised as lawful. However, he returned Catalonia and most of the Reunions.\n\n\nFrench military superiority might have allowed him to press for more advantageous terms. Thus, his generosity to Spain with regard to Catalonia has been read as a concession to foster pro-French sentiment and may ultimately have induced King Charles II to name Louis's grandson Philip, Duke of Anjou, heir to the Spanish throne.[87] In exchange for financial compensation, France renounced its interests in the Electorate of Cologne and the Palatinate. Lorraine, which had been occupied by the French since 1670, was returned to its rightful Duke Leopold, albeit with a right of way to the French military. William and Mary were recognised as joint sovereigns of the British Isles, and Louis withdrew support for James II. The Dutch were given the right to garrison forts in the Spanish Netherlands that acted as a protective barrier against possible French aggression. Though in some respects the Treaty of Ryswick may appear a diplomatic defeat for Louis since he failed to place client rulers in control of the Palatinate or the Electorate of Cologne, he did in fact fulfil many of the aims laid down in his 1688 ultimatum.[88] In any case, peace in 1697 was desirable to Louis, since France was exhausted from the costs of the war.\n\n\n\n## War of the Spanish Succession[edit]\n\n\nMain article: War of the Spanish Succession\n\n### Causes and build-up to the war[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Philip V of Spain\nBy the time of the Peace of Ryswick, the Spanish succession had been a source of concern to European leaders for well over forty years. King Charles II ruled a vast empire comprising Spain, Naples, Sicily, Milan, the Spanish Netherlands, and numerous Spanish colonies. He produced no children, however, and consequently had no direct heirs.\n\n\nThe principal claimants to the throne of Spain belonged to the ruling families of France and Austria. The French claim derived from Louis XIV's mother Anne of Austria (the older sister of Philip IV of Spain) and his wife Maria Theresa (Philip IV's eldest daughter). Based on the laws of primogeniture, France had the better claim as it originated from the eldest daughters in two generations. However, their renunciation of succession rights complicated matters. In the case of Maria Theresa, nonetheless, the renunciation was considered null and void owing to Spain's breach of her marriage contract with Louis. In contrast, no renunciations tainted the claims of Emperor Leopold I's son Charles, Archduke of Austria, who was a grandson of Philip III's youngest daughter Maria Anna. The English and Dutch feared that a French or Austrian-born Spanish king would threaten the balance of power and thus preferred the Bavarian Prince Joseph Ferdinand, a grandson of Leopold I through his first wife Margaret Theresa of Spain (the younger daughter of Philip IV).\n\n\nIn an attempt to avoid war, Louis signed the Treaty of the Hague with William III of England in 1698. This agreement divided Spain's Italian territories between Louis's son *le Grand Dauphin* and Archduke Charles, with the rest of the empire awarded to Joseph Ferdinand. William III consented to permitting the Dauphin's new territories to become part of France when the latter succeeded to his father's throne.[89] The signatories, however, omitted to consult the ruler of these lands, and Charles II was passionately opposed to the dismemberment of his empire. In 1699, he re-confirmed his 1693 will that named Joseph Ferdinand as his sole successor.[90]\n\n\nSix months later, Joseph Ferdinand died. Therefore, in 1700, Louis and William III concluded a fresh partitioning agreement, the Treaty of London. This allocated Spain, the Low Countries, and the Spanish colonies to the Archduke. The Dauphin would receive all of Spain's Italian territories.[91] Charles II acknowledged that his empire could only remain undivided by bequeathing it entirely to a Frenchman or an Austrian. Under pressure from his German wife, Maria Anna of Neuburg, Charles II named Archduke Charles as his sole heir.\n\n\n\n### Acceptance of the will of Charles II and consequences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Louis in 1701\nOn his deathbed in 1700, Charles II of Spain unexpectedly changed his will. The clear demonstration of French military superiority for many decades before this time, the pro-French faction at the court of Spain, and even Pope Innocent XII convinced him that France was more likely to preserve his empire intact. He thus offered the entire empire to the Dauphin's second son Philip, Duke of Anjou, provided it remained undivided. Anjou was not in the direct line of French succession, thus his accession would not cause a Franco-Spanish union.[91] If Anjou refused, the throne would be offered to his younger brother Charles, Duke of Berry. If the Duke of Berry declined it, it would go to Archduke Charles, then to the distantly related House of Savoy if Charles declined it.[92]\n\n\nLouis was confronted with a difficult choice. He could agree to a partition of the Spanish possessions and avoid a general war, or accept Charles II's will and alienate much of Europe. He may initially have been inclined to abide by the partition treaties, but the Dauphin's insistence persuaded him otherwise.[93] Moreover, Louis's foreign minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, marquis de Torcy, pointed out that war with the Emperor would almost certainly ensue whether Louis accepted the partition treaties or Charles II's will. He emphasised that, should it come to war, William III was unlikely to stand by France since he \"made a treaty to avoid war and did not intend to go to war to implement the treaty\".[90] Indeed, in the event of war, it might be preferable to be already in control of the disputed lands. Eventually, therefore, Louis decided to accept Charles II's will. Philip, Duke of Anjou, thus became Philip V, King of Spain.\n\n\nMost European rulers accepted Philip as king, some reluctantly. Depending on one's views of the war's inevitability, Louis acted reasonably or arrogantly.[94] He confirmed that Philip V retained his French rights despite his new Spanish position. Admittedly, he may only have been hypothesising a theoretical eventuality and not attempting a Franco-Spanish union. But his actions were certainly not read as disinterested. Moreover, Louis sent troops to the Spanish Netherlands to evict Dutch garrisons and secure Dutch recognition of Philip V. In 1701, Philip transferred the *asiento* (the right to supply slaves to Spanish colonies) to France, as a sign of the two nations' growing connections. As tensions mounted, Louis decided to acknowledge James Stuart, the son of James II, as king of England on the latter's death, infuriating William III. These actions enraged Britain and the Dutch Republic.[95] With the Holy Roman Emperor and the petty German states, they formed another Grand Alliance and declared war on France in 1702. French diplomacy secured Bavaria, Portugal, and Savoy as Franco-Spanish allies.[96]\n\n\n\n### Commencement of fighting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Franco-Spanish army led by the Duke of Berwick defeated decisively the Alliance forces of Portugal, England, and the Dutch Republic at the Battle of Almansa.\n![](image)The Battle of Ramillies where the French fought the Dutch and British, 23 May 1706\nEven before war was officially declared, hostilities began with Imperial aggression in Italy. Once finally declared, the War of the Spanish Succession lasted almost until Louis's death, at great cost to him and France.\n\n\nThe war began with French successes, but the talents of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and Eugene of Savoy checked these victories and broke the myth of French invincibility. The duo allowed the Palatinate and Austria to occupy Bavaria after their victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, had to flee to the Spanish Netherlands. The impact of this victory won the support of Portugal and Savoy. Later, the Battle of Ramillies delivered the Low Countries to the Allies, and the Battle of Turin forced Louis to evacuate Italy, leaving it open to Allied forces. Marlborough and Eugene met again at the Battle of Oudenarde, which enabled them to invade France.\n\n\nFrance established contact with Francis II Rákóczi and promised support if he took up the cause of Hungarian independence.\n\n\nDefeats, famine, and mounting debt greatly weakened France. Between 1693 and 1710, over two million people died in two famines, made worse as foraging armies seized food supplies from the villages.[97] In desperation, Louis ordered a disastrous invasion of the English island of Guernsey in the autumn of 1704 with the aim of raiding their successful harvest. By the winter of 1708–09, he was willing to accept peace at nearly any cost. He agreed that the entire Spanish empire should be surrendered to Archduke Charles, and also consented to return to the frontiers of the Peace of Westphalia, giving up all the territories he had acquired over 60 years. But he could not promise that Philip V would accept these terms, so the Allies demanded that Louis single-handedly attack his grandson to force these terms on him. If he could not achieve this within the year, the war would resume. Louis could not accept these terms.[98]\n\n\n\n### Turning point[edit]\n\n\n![Louis XIV depicted on a Louis d'or in 1709](image)\n\nLouis XIV depicted on a Louis d'or in 1709\n\nThe final phases of the War of the Spanish Succession demonstrated that the Allies could not maintain Archduke Charles in Spain just as surely as France could not retain the entire Spanish inheritance for Philip V. The Allies were definitively expelled from central Spain by the Franco-Spanish victories at the Battles of Villaviciosa and Brihuega in 1710. French forces elsewhere remained obdurate despite their defeats. The Allies suffered a Pyrrhic victory at the Battle of Malplaquet with 21,000 casualties, twice that of the French.[99] Eventually, France recovered its military pride with the decisive victory at Denain in 1712.\n\n\nFrench military successes near the end of the war took place against the background of a changed political situation in Austria. In 1705, Emperor Leopold I died. His elder son and successor, Joseph I, followed him in 1711. His heir was none other than Archduke Charles, who secured control of all of his brother's Austrian landholdings. If the Spanish empire then fell to him, it would have resurrected a domain as vast as Holy Roman Emperor Charles V's in the 16th century. To the maritime powers of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, this would have been as undesirable as a Franco-Spanish union.[100]\n\n\n\n### Conclusion of peace[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of France after the death of Louis XIV\nAs a result of the fresh British perspective on the European balance of power, Anglo-French talks began, culminating in the 1713 Peace of Utrecht between Louis, Philip V of Spain, Anne of Great Britain, and the Dutch Republic. In 1714, after losing Landau and Freiburg, the Holy Roman Emperor also made peace with France in the Treaties of Rastatt and Baden.\n\n\nIn the general settlement, Philip V retained Spain and its colonies, while Austria received the Spanish Netherlands and divided Spanish Italy with Savoy. Britain kept Gibraltar and Menorca. Louis agreed to withdraw his support for James Stuart, son of James II and pretender to the throne of Great Britain, and ceded Newfoundland, Rupert's Land, and Acadia in the Americas to Anne. Britain gained the most from the treaty, but the final terms were much more favourable to France than those being discussed in peace negotiations in 1709 and 1710.[*citation needed*] France retained Île-Saint-Jean and Île Royale, and Louis acquired a few minor European territories, such as the Principality of Orange and the Ubaye Valley, which covered transalpine passes into Italy. Thanks to Louis, his allies the Electors of Bavaria and Cologne were restored to their prewar status and returned their lands.[101]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Marriages and children[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dual Cypher of King Louis XIV & Queen Marie Thérèse\nLouis and his wife Maria Theresa of Spain had six children from the marriage contracted for them in 1660. However, only one child, the eldest, survived to adulthood: Louis, *le Grand Dauphin*, known as *Monseigneur*. Maria Theresa died in 1683, whereupon Louis remarked that she had never caused him unease on any other occasion.\n\n\nDespite evidence of affection early on in their marriage, Louis was never faithful to Maria Theresa. He took a series of mistresses, both official and unofficial. Among the better documented are Louise de La Vallière (with whom he had five children; 1661–1667), Bonne de Pons d'Heudicourt (1665), Catherine Charlotte de Gramont (1665), Françoise-Athénaïs, Marquise de Montespan (with whom he had seven children; 1667–1680), Anne de Rohan-Chabot (1669–1675), Claude de Vin des Œillets (one child born in 1676), Isabelle de Ludres (1675–1678), and Marie Angélique de Scorailles (1679–1681), who died at age 19 in childbirth. Through these liaisons, he produced numerous illegitimate children, most of whom he married to members of cadet branches of the royal family.\n\n\nLouis proved relatively more faithful to his second wife, Françoise d'Aubigné, Marquise de Maintenon. He first met her through her work caring for his children by Madame de Montespan, noting the care she gave to his favourite, Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine.[102] The king was, at first, put off by her strict religious practice, but he warmed to her through her care for his children.[102]\n\n\nWhen he legitimized his children by Madame de Montespan on 20 December 1673, Françoise d'Aubigné became the royal governess at Saint-Germain.[102] As governess, she was one of very few people permitted to speak to him as an equal, without limits.[102] It is believed that they were married secretly at Versailles on or around 10 October 1683[103] or January 1684.[104] This marriage, though never announced or publicly discussed, was an open secret and lasted until his death.[105]\n\n\n\n### Piety and religion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Louis XIV encouraged Catholic missions through the creation of the Paris Foreign Missions Society\nLouis was a pious and devout king who saw himself as the head and protector of the Catholic Church in France. He made his devotions daily regardless of where he was, following the liturgical calendar regularly.[106] Under the influence of his very religious second wife, he became much stronger in the practice of his Catholic faith.[107] This included banning opera and comedy performances during Lent.[107]\n\n\nTowards the middle and the end of his reign, the centre for the King's religious observances was usually the Chapelle Royale at Versailles. Ostentation was a distinguishing feature of daily Mass, annual celebrations, such as those of Holy Week, and special ceremonies.[108] Louis established the Paris Foreign Missions Society, but his informal alliance with the Ottoman Empire was criticised for undermining Christendom.[109]\n\n\n\n### Patronage of the arts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Painting from 1667 depicting Louis as patron of the fine arts\n![](image)The *Cour royale* and the *Cour de marbre* at Versailles\nSee also: Louis XIV style\n\nLouis generously supported the royal court of France and those who worked under him. He brought the Académie Française under his patronage and became its \"Protector\". He allowed Classical French literature to flourish by protecting such writers as Molière, Racine, and La Fontaine, whose works remain influential to this day. Louis also patronised the visual arts by funding and commissioning artists such as Charles Le Brun, Pierre Mignard, Antoine Coysevox, and Hyacinthe Rigaud, whose works became famous throughout Europe. Composers and musicians such as Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jacques Champion de Chambonnières, and François Couperin thrived. In 1661, Louis founded the Académie Royale de Danse, and in 1669, the Académie d'Opéra, important driving events in the evolution of ballet. He also attracted, supported and patronized such artists as André Charles Boulle, who revolutionised marquetry with his art of inlay, today known as \"Boulle work\". Always on the lookout for new talent, the king launched music competitions: in 1683, Michel-Richard de Lalande thus became deputy master of the Royal Chapel, composing his *Symphonies for the Soupers du Roy* along with 77 large scale *Grand Motets*.\n\n\nOver the course of four building campaigns, Louis converted a hunting lodge built by Louis XIII into the spectacular Palace of Versailles. With the exception of the current Royal Chapel (built near the end of his reign), the palace achieved much of its current appearance after the third building campaign, which was followed by an official move of the royal court to Versailles on 6 May 1682. Versailles became a dazzling, awe-inspiring setting for state affairs and the reception of foreign dignitaries. At Versailles, the king alone commanded attention.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bust of Louis XIV by Gianlorenzo Bernini\nSeveral reasons have been suggested for the creation of the extravagant and stately palace, as well as the relocation of the monarchy's seat. The memoirist Saint-Simon speculated that Louis viewed Versailles as an isolated power centre where treasonous cabals could be more readily discovered and foiled.[61] There has also been speculation that the revolt of the *Fronde* caused Louis to hate Paris, which he abandoned for a country retreat, but his sponsorship of many public works in Paris, such as the establishment of a police force and of street-lighting,[110] lend little credence to this theory. As a further example of his continued care for the capital, Louis constructed the *Hôtel des Invalides*, a military complex and home to this day for officers and soldiers rendered infirm either by injury or old age. While pharmacology was still quite rudimentary in his day, the *Invalides* pioneered new treatments and set new standards for hospice treatment. The conclusion of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1668 also induced Louis to demolish Paris's northern walls in 1670 and replace them with wide tree-lined boulevards.[111]\n\n\nLouis also renovated and improved the Louvre and other royal residences. Gian Lorenzo Bernini was originally to plan additions to the Louvre; however, his plans would have meant the destruction of much of the existing structure, replacing it with an Italian summer villa in the centre of Paris. Bernini's plans were eventually shelved in favour of the elegant Louvre Colonnade designed by three Frenchmen: Louis Le Vau, Charles Le Brun, and Claude Perrault. With the relocation of the court to Versailles, the Louvre was given over to the arts and the public.[112]\nDuring his visit from Rome, Bernini also executed a renowned portrait bust of the king.\n\n\n\n## Image and depiction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bronze bust of Louis XIV. Circa 1660, by an unknown artist. From Paris, France. The Victoria and Albert Museum, London.\nFew rulers in world history have commemorated themselves in as grand a manner as Louis.[113] He cultivated his image as the Sun King (*le Roi Soleil*), the center of the universe \"without equal\". Louis used court ritual and the arts to validate and augment his control over France. With his support, Colbert established from the beginning of Louis' personal reign a centralised and institutionalised system for creating and perpetuating the royal image. The King was thus portrayed largely in majesty or at war, notably against Spain. This portrayal of the monarch was to be found in numerous media of artistic expression, such as painting, sculpture, theatre, dance, music, and the almanacs that diffused royal propaganda to the population at large.\n\n\n\n### Evolution of royal portraiture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Le roi gouverne par lui-même*, *modello* for the central panel of the ceiling of the Hall of Mirrors c. 1680 by Le Brun, (1619–1690)\nOver his lifetime, Louis commissioned numerous works of art to portray himself, among them over 300 formal portraits. The earliest portrayals of Louis already followed the pictorial conventions of the day in depicting the child king as the majestically royal incarnation of France. This idealisation of the monarch continued in later works, which avoided depictions of the effect of smallpox that Louis contracted in 1647. In the 1660s, Louis began to be shown as a Roman emperor, the god Apollo, or Alexander the Great, as can be seen in many works of Charles Le Brun, such as sculpture, paintings, and the decor of major monuments.\n\n\nThe depiction of the king in this manner focused on allegorical or mythological attributes, instead of attempting to produce a true likeness. As Louis aged, so too did the manner in which he was depicted. Nonetheless, there was still a disparity between realistic representation and the demands of royal propaganda. There is no better illustration of this than in Hyacinthe Rigaud's frequently-reproduced *Portrait of Louis XIV of 1701*, in which a 63-year-old Louis appears to stand on a set of unnaturally young legs.[114]\n\n\nRigaud's portrait exemplified the height of royal portraiture during Louis' reign. Although Rigaud crafted a credible likeness of Louis, the portrait was neither meant as an exercise in realism nor to explore Louis' personal character. Certainly, Rigaud was concerned with detail and depicted the king's costume with great precision, down to his shoe buckle.[115]\n\n\nHowever, Rigaud's intention was to glorify the monarchy. Rigaud's original, now housed in the Louvre, was originally meant as a gift to Louis' grandson, Philip V of Spain. However, Louis was so pleased with the work that he kept the original and commissioned a copy to be sent to his grandson. That became the first of many copies, both in full and half-length formats, to be made by Rigaud, often with the help of his assistants. The portrait also became a model for French royal and imperial portraiture down to the time of Charles X over a century later. In his work, Rigaud proclaims Louis' exalted royal status through his elegant stance and haughty expression, the royal regalia and throne, rich ceremonial fleur-de-lys robes, as well as the upright column in the background, which, together with the draperies, serves to frame this image of majesty.\n\n\n\n### Other works of art[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to portraits, Louis commissioned at least 20 statues of himself in the 1680s, to stand in Paris and provincial towns as physical manifestations of his rule. He also commissioned \"war artists\" to follow him on campaigns to document his military triumphs. To remind the people of these triumphs, Louis erected permanent triumphal arches in Paris and the provinces for the first time since the decline of the Roman Empire.\n\n\nLouis' reign marked the birth and infancy of the art of medallions. Sixteenth-century rulers had often issued medals in small numbers to commemorate the major events of their reigns. Louis, however, struck more than 300 to celebrate the story of the king in bronze, that were enshrined in thousands of households throughout France.\n\n\nHe also used tapestries as a medium of exalting the monarchy. Tapestries could be allegorical, depicting the elements or seasons, or realist, portraying royal residences or historical events. They were among the most significant means to spread royal propaganda prior to the construction of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles.[116]\n\n\n\n### Ballet[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Louis XIV as Apollo in the *Ballet Royal de la Nuit* (1653)\n![](image)Hall of Mirrors, Palace of Versailles\nLouis loved ballet and frequently danced in court ballets during the early half of his reign. In general, Louis was an eager dancer who performed 80 roles in 40 major ballets. This approaches the career of a professional ballet dancer.[117]\n\n\nHis choices were strategic and varied. He danced four parts in three of Molière's comédies-ballets, which are plays accompanied by music and dance. Louis played an Egyptian in *Le Mariage forcé* in 1664, a Moorish gentleman in *Le Sicilien* in 1667, and both Neptune and Apollo in *Les Amants magnifiques* in 1670.\n\n\nHe sometimes danced leading roles that were suitably royal or godlike (such as Neptune, Apollo, or the Sun).[117] At other times, he would adopt mundane roles before appearing at the end in the lead role. It is considered that, at all times, he provided his roles with sufficient majesty and drew the limelight with his flair for dancing.[117] For Louis, ballet may not have merely been a tool for manipulation in his propaganda machinery. The sheer number of performances he gave as well as the diversity of roles he played may serve to indicate a deeper understanding and interest in the art form.[117][118]\n\n\nBallet dancing was actually used by Louis as a political tool to hold power over his state. He integrated ballet deeply in court social functions and fixated his nobles' attention on upholding standards in ballet dancing, effectively distracting them from political activities.[119] In 1661, the Royal Academy of Dance was founded by Louis to further his ambition. Pierre Beauchamp, his private dance instructor, was ordered by Louis to come up with a notation system to record ballet performances, which he did with great success. His work was adopted and published by Feuillet in 1700 as *Choregraphie*. This major development in ballet played an important role in promoting French culture and ballet throughout Europe during Louis' time.[120]\n\n\nLouis greatly emphasized etiquettes in ballet dancing, evidently seen in \"La belle danse\" (the French noble style). More challenging skills were required to perform this dance with movements very much resembling court behaviours, as a way to remind the nobles of the king's absolute power and their own status. All the details and rules were compressed in five positions of the bodies codified by Beauchamp.[121]\n\n\n\n### Unofficial image[edit]\n\n\nBesides the official depiction and image of Louis, his subjects also followed a non-official discourse consisting mainly of clandestine publications, popular songs, and rumours that provided an alternative interpretation of Louis and his government. They often focused on the miseries arising from poor government, but also carried the hope for a better future when Louis escaped the malignant influence of his ministers and mistresses, and took the government into his own hands. On the other hand, petitions addressed either directly to Louis or to his ministers exploited the traditional imagery and language of monarchy. These varying interpretations of Louis abounded in self-contradictions that reflected the people's amalgamation of their everyday experiences with the idea of monarchy.[122]\n\n\n\n### In fiction[edit]\n\n\n#### Literature[edit]\n\n\n* Alexandre Dumas portrayed Louis in his two sequels to his 1844 novel *The Three Musketeers*: first as a child in *Twenty Years After* (1845), then as a young man in *The Vicomte de Bragelonne* (1847–1850), in which he is a central character. The final part of the latter novel recounts the legend that a mysterious prisoner in an iron mask was actually Louis' twin brother and has spawned numerous film adaptations generally titled *The Man in the Iron Mask*.\n* In 1910, the American historical novelist Charles Major wrote *\"The Little King: A Story of the Childhood of King Louis XIV\"*.\n* Louis is a major character in the 1959 historical novel *Angélique et le Roy* (\"Angélique and the King\"), part of the *Angélique* series. The protagonist, a strong-willed lady at Versailles, rejects the King's advances and refuses to become his mistress. A later book, the 1961 *Angélique se révolte* (\"Angélique in Revolt\"), details the dire consequences of her defying this powerful monarch.\n* A character based on Louis plays an important role in *The Age of Unreason*, a series of four alternate history novels written by American science fiction and fantasy author Gregory Keyes.\n* Louis features significantly in Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle, specifically in the 2003 novel *The Confusion*, the greater part of which takes place at Versailles.\n* In the *39 Clues* series universe, it has been noted that Louis was part of the Cahill branch, Tomas.\n* He is called the son of Apollo in Rick Riordan's *Trials of Apollo* series.\n* Louis XIV is portrayed in Vonda N. McIntyre's 1997 novel *The Moon and the Sun*.\n\n\n#### Films[edit]\n\n\n* The film, *The Taking of Power by Louis XIV* (1966), directed by Roberto Rossellini, shows Louis' rise to power after the death of Cardinal Mazarin.\n* The film *Man in the Iron Mask* (1998), directed by Randall Wallace, focused on the identity of an anonymous masked prisoner who spent decades in the Bastille and other French prisons, and his true identity remains somewhat a mystery till date. The monarch was played by Leonardo DiCaprio.\n* The film, *Le Roi Danse* (2000; translated: *The King Dances*), directed by Gérard Corbiau, reveals Louis through the eyes of Jean-Baptiste Lully, his court musician.\n* Julian Sands portrayed Louis in Roland Jaffe's *Vatel* (2000).\n* Alan Rickman directed, co-wrote, and stars as Louis XIV in the film, *A Little Chaos*, which centres on construction in the gardens of Versaille, at the time immediately before and after the death of Queen Maria Theresa.\n* The 2016 film *The Death of Louis XIV*, directed by Albert Serra, is set during the last two weeks of Louis XIV's life before dying of gangrene, with the monarch played by Jean-Pierre Léaud.\n\n\n#### Television[edit]\n\n\n* The 15-year-old Louis XIV, as played by the Irish actor Robert Sheehan, is a major character of the short-lived historical fantasy series *Young Blades* from January to June 2005.\n* George Blagden portrays Louis XIV in the Canal+ series *Versailles* which aired for three seasons from 2015.\n\n\n#### Musicals[edit]\n\n\n* Emmanuel Moire portrayed Louis XIV in the 2005-07 Kamel Ouali musical Le Roi Soleil.\n\n\n## Health and death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Louis XIV (seated) with his son *le Grand Dauphin* (to the left), his grandson Louis, Duke of Burgundy (to the right), his great-grandson Louis Duke of Anjou, and Madame de Ventadour, Anjou's governess, who commissioned this painting; busts of Henry IV and Louis XIII are in the background.\nDespite the image of a healthy and virile king that Louis sought to project, evidence exists to suggest that his health was not very good. He had many ailments: for example, symptoms of diabetes, as confirmed in reports of suppurating periostitis in 1678, dental abscesses in 1696, along with recurring boils, fainting spells, gout, dizziness, hot flushes, and headaches.\n\n\nFrom 1647 to 1711, the three chief physicians to the king (Antoine Vallot, Antoine d'Aquin, and Guy-Crescent Fagon) recorded all of his health problems in the *Journal de Santé du Roi* (*Journal of the King's Health*), a daily report of his health. On 18 November 1686, Louis underwent a painful operation for an anal fistula that was performed by the surgeon Charles Felix de Tassy, who prepared a specially shaped curved scalpel for the occasion. The wound took more than two months to heal.[123]\n\n\nLouis died of gangrene at Versailles on 1 September 1715, four days before his 77th birthday, after 72 years on the throne. Enduring much pain in his last days, he finally \"yielded up his soul without any effort, like a candle going out\", while reciting the psalm *Deus, in adjutorium me festina* (*O Lord, make haste to help me*).[124] His body was laid to rest in Saint-Denis Basilica outside Paris. It remained there undisturbed for about 80 years until revolutionaries exhumed and destroyed all of the remains found in the Basilica.[125]\n\n\nCardinal Armand Gaston Maximilien de Rohan gave Last Rites (confession, viaticum, and unction) to king Louis XIV.[126]\n\n\n\n### Succession[edit]\n\n\nLouis outlived most of his immediate legitimate family. His last surviving legitimate son, the Dauphin, died in 1711. Barely a year later, the Duke of Burgundy, the eldest of the Dauphin's three sons and then heir-apparent to Louis, followed his father. Burgundy's elder son, Louis, Duke of Brittany, joined them a few weeks later. Thus, on his deathbed, Louis' heir-apparent was his five-year-old great-grandson, Louis, Duke of Anjou, Burgundy's younger son.\n\n\nLouis foresaw an underaged successor and sought to restrict the power of his nephew Philip II, Duke of Orléans, who, as his closest surviving legitimate relative in France, would probably become regent to the prospective Louis XV. Accordingly, the king created a regency council as Louis XIII had in anticipation of Louis XIV's own minority, with some power vested in his illegitimate son Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, Duke of Maine.[127] Orléans, however, had Louis' will annulled by the *Parlement of Paris* after his death and made himself sole regent. He stripped Maine and his brother, Louis-Alexandre, Count of Toulouse, of the rank of Prince of the Blood, which Louis had granted them, and significantly reduced Maine's power and privileges.[128]\n\n\n\n#### Line of succession in 1715[edit]\n\n\nLine of succession to the French throne upon the death of Louis XIV in 1715. Louis XIV's only surviving legitimate grandson, Philip V, was not included in the line of succession due to having renounced the French throne after the war of the Spanish Succession, which lasted for 13 years after the death of Charles II of Spain in 1700.[129]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) *Louis XIII (1601–1643)*\n\t+ ![](image) **Louis XIV** *(1638–1715)*\n\t\t- *Louis, Grand Dauphin (1661–1711)*\n\t\t\t* *Louis, Duke of Burgundy (1682–1712)*\n\t\t\t\t+ *Louis, Duke of Brittany (1707–1712)*\n\t\t\t\t+ **(1)** Louis, Duke of Anjou (1710–1774)\n\t\t\t* Philip V of Spain (1683–1746)\n\t\t\t* *Charles, Duke of Berry (1686–1714)*\n\t+ *Philippe I, Duke of Orléans (1640–1701)*\n\t\t- **(2)** Philippe II, Duke of Orléans (1674–1723)\n\t\t\t* **(3)** Louis, Duke of Chartres (1703–1752)\n\nFurther down the French line of succession in 1715 was the House of Conde, followed by the House of Conti (a cadet branch of the House of Conde). Both of these royal houses were descended in the male line from Henri II, Prince of Conde, a second cousin of French King Louis XIII (the father of Louis XIV) in the male line.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Reputation[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Philippe de Courcillon's *Journal*, Louis on his deathbed advised his heir with these words: \n\n\n> Do not follow the bad example which I have set you; I have often undertaken war too lightly and have sustained it for vanity. Do not imitate me, but be a peaceful prince, and may you apply yourself principally to the alleviation of the burdens of your subjects.[130]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Territorial expansion of France under Louis XIV (1643–1715) is depicted in orange.\nSome historians point out that it was a customary demonstration of piety in those days to exaggerate one's sins. Thus they do not place much emphasis on Louis' deathbed declarations in assessing his accomplishments. Rather, they focus on military and diplomatic successes, such as how he placed a French prince on the Spanish throne. This, they contend, ended the threat of an aggressive Spain that historically interfered in domestic French politics. These historians also emphasise the effect of Louis' wars in expanding France's boundaries and creating more defensible frontiers that preserved France from invasion until the Revolution.[130]\n\n\nArguably, Louis also applied himself indirectly to \"the alleviation of the burdens of [his] subjects.\" For example, he patronised the arts, encouraged industry, fostered trade and commerce, and sponsored the founding of an overseas empire. Moreover, the significant reduction in civil wars and aristocratic rebellions during his reign are seen by these historians as the result of Louis' consolidation of royal authority over feudal elites. In their analysis, his early reforms centralised France and marked the birth of the modern French state. They regard the political and military victories as well as numerous cultural achievements as the means by which Louis helped raise France to a preeminent position in Europe.[131] Europe came to admire France for its military and cultural successes, power, and sophistication. Europeans generally began to emulate French manners, values, goods, and deportment. French became the universal language of the European elite.\n\n\nLouis' detractors have argued that his considerable foreign, military and domestic expenditure impoverished and bankrupted France. His supporters, however, distinguish the state, which was impoverished, from France, which was not. As supporting evidence, they cite the literature of the time, such as the social commentary in Montesquieu's *Persian Letters*.[132]\n\n\nAlternatively, Louis' critics attribute the social upheaval culminating in the French Revolution to his failure to reform French institutions while the monarchy was still secure. Other scholars counter that there was little reason to reform institutions that largely worked well under Louis. They also maintain that events occurring almost 80 years after his death were not reasonably foreseeable to Louis and that in any case, his successors had sufficient time to initiate reforms of their own.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)Royal procession passing the Pont-Neuf under Louis XIV\nLouis has often been criticised for his vanity. The memoirist Saint-Simon, who claimed that Louis slighted him, criticised him thus: \n\n\n> There was nothing he liked so much as flattery, or, to put it more plainly, adulation; the coarser and clumsier it was, the more he relished it.\n> \n> \n\n For his part, Voltaire saw Louis' vanity as the cause for his bellicosity:\n\n\n> It is certain that he passionately wanted glory, rather than the conquests themselves. In the acquisition of Alsace and half of Flanders, and of all of Franche-Comté, what he really liked was the name he made for himself.[134]\n> \n> \n\n\nNonetheless, Louis has also received praise. The anti-Bourbon Napoleon described him not only as \"a great king\", but also as \"the only King of France worthy of the name\".[135] Leibniz, the German Protestant philosopher, commended him as \"one of the greatest kings that ever was\".[136] And Lord Acton admired him as \"by far the ablest man who was born in modern times on the steps of a throne\".[137] The historian and philosopher Voltaire wrote: \"His name can never be pronounced without respect and without summoning the image of an eternally memorable age\".[138] Voltaire's history, *The Age of Louis XIV*, named Louis' reign as not only one of the four great ages in which reason and culture flourished, but the greatest ever.[139][140]\n\n\nIn 1848, at Nuneham House, a piece of Louis' mummified heart, taken from his tomb and kept in a silver locket by Lord Harcourt, Archbishop of York, was shown to the Dean of Westminster, William Buckland, who ate it.[141]\n\n\n\n### Quotes[edit]\n\n\nNumerous quotes have been attributed to Louis XIV by legend.\n\n\nThe well-known \"I am the state\" (*\"L'État, c'est moi.\"*) was reported from at least the late 18th century.[142] It was widely repeated but also denounced as apocryphal by the early 19th century.[143][b][144]\n\n\nHe did say, \"Every time I appoint someone to a vacant position, I make a hundred unhappy and one ungrateful.\"[145][146] Louis is recorded by numerous eyewitnesses as having said on his deathbed: \"*Je m'en vais, mais l'État demeurera toujours.*\" (\"I depart, but the State shall always remain.\")[147]\n\n\n\n## Arms[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms of Louis XIV\n| ![](image) | Notes\nUpon his accession to the throne Louis assumed the royal coat of arms of France & Navarre.[148][*better source needed*]\nAdopted\n1643–1715\nCrest\nThe Royal crown of France\nHelm\nAn opened gold helmet, with blue and gold mantling.\nEscutcheon\n*Azure, three fleurs-de-lis Or (for France) impaling Gules on a chain in cross saltire and orle Or an emerald Proper (for Navarre)*.\nSupporters\nThe two supporters are two angels, acting as heralds for the two realms.

It is notable as the first decoration that could be granted to non-nobles and is roughly the forerunner of the *Légion d'honneur*, with which it shares the red ribbon (though the *Légion d'honneur* is awarded to military personnel and civilians alike).\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\n### Ancestry[edit]\n\n\n| Ancestors of Louis XIV |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 8.

It follows the Bourbon, Kings of France, and the Counts of Paris and Worms. This line can be traced back more than 1,200 years from Robert of Hesbaye to the present day, through Kings of France & Navarre, Spain and Two-Sicilies, Dukes of Parma and Grand-Dukes of Luxembourg, Princes of Orléans and Emperors of Brazil. It is one of the oldest in Europe.\n1. Robert II of Worms and Rheingau (Robert of Hesbaye), 770–807\n2. Robert III of Worms and Rheingau, 808–834\n3. Robert IV the Strong, 820–866\n4.
