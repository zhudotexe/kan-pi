It is the primary operating system for Apple's Mac computers. Within the market of desktop and laptop computers, it is the second most widely used desktop OS, after Microsoft Windows and ahead of Linux (including ChromeOS).\n\n\nmacOS succeeded the classic Mac OS, a Macintosh operating system from 1984 to 2001. During this time, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had left Apple and started another company, NeXT, developing the NeXTSTEP platform that would later be acquired by Apple to form the basis of macOS.\n\n\nThe first desktop version, Mac OS X 10.0, was released on March 24, 2001. Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and all releases from OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion to macOS 14 Sonoma are UNIX 03 certified.[5][6] The derivatives of macOS are Apple's other operating systems: iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS, and audioOS.\n\n\nA prominent part of macOS's original brand identity was the use of Roman numeral X, pronounced \"ten\", as well as code naming each release after species of big cats, or places within California.[7] Apple shortened the name to \"OS X\" in 2011 and then changed it to \"macOS\" in 2016 to align with the branding of Apple's other operating systems, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.[8] After sixteen distinct versions of macOS 10, macOS Big Sur was presented as version 11 in 2020, and every subsequent version has also incremented the major version number.\n\n\nmacOS has supported three major processor architectures, beginning with PowerPC-based Macs in 1999. In 2006, Apple transitioned to the Intel architecture with a line of Macs using Intel Core processors. In 2020, Apple began the Apple silicon transition, using self-designed, 64-bit ARM-based Apple M series processors on the latest Macintosh computers.[9] As of 2023[update], the most recent release of macOS is macOS 14 Sonoma.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nMain article: macOS version history\n\nThe heritage of what would become macOS had originated at NeXT, a company founded by Steve Jobs following his departure from Apple in 1985. There, the Unix-like NeXTSTEP operating system was developed, before being launched in 1989. The kernel of NeXTSTEP is based upon the Mach kernel, which was originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University, with additional kernel layers and low-level user space code derived from parts of BSD.[10] Its graphical user interface was built on top of an object-oriented GUI toolkit using the Objective-C programming language.\n\n\nThroughout the early 1990s, Apple had tried to create a \"next-generation\" OS to succeed its classic Mac OS through the Taligent, Copland and Gershwin projects, but all were eventually abandoned.[11] This led Apple to acquire NeXT in 1997, allowing NeXTSTEP, later called OPENSTEP, to serve as the basis for Apple's next generation operating system.[12]\nThis purchase also led to Steve Jobs returning to Apple as an interim, and then the permanent CEO, shepherding the transformation of the programmer-friendly OPENSTEP into a system that would be adopted by Apple's primary market of home users and creative professionals. The project was first code named \"Rhapsody\" and then officially named Mac OS X.[13][14]\n\n\n\n### Mac OS X[edit]\n\n\nMac OS X was originally presented as the tenth major version of Apple's operating system for Macintosh computers until 2020. The letter \"X\" in Mac OS X's name refers to the number 10, a Roman numeral, and Apple has stated that it should be pronounced \"ten\" in this context. However, it is also commonly pronounced like the letter \"X\".[15][16] Previous Macintosh operating systems (versions of the classic Mac OS) were named using Arabic numerals, as with Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9.[17][15] Until macOS 11 Big Sur, all versions of the operating system were given version numbers of the form 10.*x*, with *x* going from 0 to 15; with macOS 11 Big Sur, Apple switched to numbering major releases with numbers that increase by 1 with every major release.\n\n\nThe first version of Mac OS X, Mac OS X Server 1.0, was a transitional product, featuring an interface resembling the classic Mac OS, though it was not compatible with software designed for the older system. Consumer releases of Mac OS X included more backward compatibility. Mac OS applications could be rewritten to run natively via the Carbon API; many could also be run directly through the Classic Environment with a reduction in performance.\n\n\nThe consumer version of Mac OS X was launched in 2001 with Mac OS X 10.0. Reviews were variable, with extensive praise for its sophisticated, glossy Aqua interface, but criticizing it for sluggish performance.[18] With Apple's popularity at a low, the maker of FrameMaker, Adobe Inc., declined to develop new versions of it for Mac OS X.[19] *Ars Technica* columnist John Siracusa, who reviewed every major OS X release up to 10.10, described the early releases in retrospect as \"dog-slow, feature poor\" and Aqua as \"unbearably slow and a huge resource hog\".[18][20][21]\n\n\nApple rapidly developed several new releases of Mac OS X.[22] Siracusa's review of version 10.3, Panther, noted \"It's strange to have gone from years of uncertainty and vaporware to a steady annual supply of major new operating system releases.\"[23] Version 10.4, Tiger, reportedly shocked executives at Microsoft by offering a number of features, such as fast file searching and improved graphics processing, that Microsoft had spent several years struggling to add to Windows with acceptable performance.[24]\n\n\nAs the operating system evolved, it moved away from the classic Mac OS, with applications being added and removed.[25] Considering music to be a key market, Apple developed the iPod music player and music software for the Mac, including iTunes and GarageBand.[26] Targeting the consumer and media markets, Apple emphasized its new \"digital lifestyle\" applications such as the iLife suite, integrated home entertainment through the Front Row media center and the Safari web browser. With increasing popularity of the internet, Apple offered additional online services, including the .Mac, MobileMe and most recently iCloud products. It later began selling third-party applications through the Mac App Store.\n\n\nNewer versions of Mac OS X also included modifications to the general interface, moving away from the striped gloss and transparency of the initial versions. Some applications began to use a brushed metal appearance, or non-pinstriped title bar appearance in version 10.4.[27] In Leopard, Apple announced a unification of the interface, with a standardized gray-gradient window style.[28][29]\n\n\nIn 2006, the first Intel Macs released used a specialized version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.[30]\n\n\nA key development for the system was the announcement and release of the iPhone from 2007 onwards. While Apple's previous iPod media players used a minimal operating system, the iPhone used an operating system based on Mac OS X, which would later be called \"iPhone OS\" and then iOS. The simultaneous release of two operating systems based on the same frameworks placed tension on Apple, which cited the iPhone as forcing it to delay Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.[31] However, after Apple opened the iPhone to third-party developers its commercial success drew attention to Mac OS X, with many iPhone software developers showing interest in Mac development.[32]\n\n\nIn 2007, Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard was the sole release with universal binary components, allowing installation on both Intel Macs and select PowerPC Macs.[33] It is also the final release with PowerPC Mac support. Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was the first version of Mac OS X to be built exclusively for Intel Macs, and the final release with 32-bit Intel Mac support.[34] The name was intended to signal its status as an iteration of Leopard, focusing on technical and performance improvements rather than user-facing features; indeed it was explicitly branded to developers as being a 'no new features' release.[35] Since its release, several OS X or macOS releases (namely OS X Mountain Lion, OS X El Capitan, macOS High Sierra, and macOS Monterey) follow this pattern, with a name derived from its predecessor, similar to the 'tick\u2013tock model' used by Intel.\n\n\nIn two succeeding versions, Lion and Mountain Lion, Apple moved some applications to a highly skeuomorphic style of design inspired by contemporary versions of iOS while simplifying some elements by making controls such as scroll bars fade out when not in use.[20] This direction was, like brushed metal interfaces, unpopular with some users, although it continued a trend of greater animation and variety in the interface previously seen in design aspects such as the Time Machine backup utility, which presented past file versions against a swirling nebula, and the glossy translucent dock of Leopard and Snow Leopard.[36] In addition, with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, Apple ceased to release separate server versions of Mac OS X, selling server tools as a separate downloadable application through the Mac App Store. A review described the trend in the server products as becoming \"cheaper and simpler... shifting its focus from large businesses to small ones.\"[37]\n\n\n\n### OS X[edit]\n\n\n![](image)OS X logo from 2011 to 2013\nIn 2012, with the release of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, the name of the system was officially shortened from Mac OS X to OS X, after the previous version shortened the system name in a similar fashion a year prior. That year, Apple removed the head of OS X development, Scott Forstall, and design was changed towards a more minimal direction.[38] Apple's new user interface design, using deep color saturation, text-only buttons and a minimal, 'flat' interface, was debuted with iOS 7 in 2013. With OS X engineers reportedly working on iOS 7, the version released in 2013, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, was something of a transitional release, with some of the skeuomorphic design removed, while most of the general interface of Mavericks remained unchanged.[39] The next version, OS X 10.10 Yosemite, adopted a design similar to iOS 7 but with greater complexity suitable for an interface controlled with a mouse.[40]\n\n\nFrom 2012 onwards, the system has shifted to an annual release schedule similar to that of iOS. It also steadily cut the cost of updates from Snow Leopard onwards, before removing upgrade fees altogether from 2013 onwards.[41] Some journalists and third-party software developers have suggested that this decision, while allowing more rapid feature release, meant less opportunity to focus on stability, with no version of OS X recommendable for users requiring stability and performance above new features.[42] Apple's 2015 update, OS X 10.11 El Capitan, was announced to focus specifically on stability and performance improvements.[43]\n\n\n\n### macOS[edit]\n\n\n![](image)macOS logo\nIn 2016, with the release of macOS 10.12 Sierra, the name was changed from OS X to macOS to align it with the branding of Apple's other primary operating systems, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.[44] macOS Sierra added Siri, iCloud Drive, picture-in-picture support, a Night Shift mode that switches the display to warmer colors at night, and two Continuity features: Universal Clipboard, which syncs a user's clipboard across their Apple devices, and Auto Unlock, which can unlock a user's Mac with their Apple Watch. macOS Sierra also adds support for the Apple File System (APFS), Apple's successor to the dated HFS+ file system.[45][46][47] macOS 10.13 High Sierra, released in 2017, included performance improvements, Metal 2 and HEVC support, and made APFS the default file system for SSD boot drives.[48]\n\n\nIts successor, macOS 10.14 Mojave, was released in 2018, adding a dark user interface option and a dynamic wallpaper setting.[49] It was succeeded by macOS 10.15 Catalina in 2019, which replaces iTunes with separate apps for different types of media, and introduces the Catalyst system for porting iOS apps.[50]\n\n\nIn 2020, Apple previewed macOS 11 Big Sur at the WWDC 2020. This was the first increment in the primary version number of macOS since the release of Mac OS X Public Beta in 2000; updates to macOS 11 were given 11.x numbers, matching the version numbering scheme used by Apple's other operating systems. Big Sur brought major changes to the UI and was the first version to run on the ARM instruction set.[51] The new numbering system was continued in 2021 with macOS 12 Monterey, 2022 with macOS 13 Ventura, and 2023 with macOS 14 Sonoma.\n\n\n\n### Timeline of releases[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n* v\n* t\n* e\n Mac OS X, OS X, and macOS version information\n| Version\n | Release Name\n | Darwinversion\n |

However, Intel-based Macs are unable to run ARM-based applications, such as iOS and iPadOS apps.\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of macOS\n\nAt macOS's core is a POSIX-compliant operating system built on top of the XNU kernel,[75] with standard Unix facilities available from the command line interface. Apple has released this family of software as a free and open source operating system named Darwin. On top of Darwin, Apple layered a number of components, including the Aqua interface and the Finder, to complete the GUI-based operating system which is macOS.[76]\n\n\nWith its original introduction as Mac OS X, the system brought a number of new capabilities to provide a more stable and reliable platform than its predecessor, the classic Mac OS. For example, pre-emptive multitasking and memory protection improved the system's ability to run multiple applications simultaneously without them interrupting or corrupting each other. Many aspects of macOS's architecture are derived from OPENSTEP, which was designed to be portable, to ease the transition from one platform to another. For example, NeXTSTEP was ported from the original 68k-based NeXT workstations to x86 and other architectures before NeXT was purchased by Apple,[77] and OPENSTEP was later ported to the PowerPC architecture as part of the Rhapsody project.\n\n\nPrior to macOS High Sierra, and on drives other than solid state drives (SSDs), the default file system is HFS+, which it inherited from the classic Mac OS. Operating system designer Linus Torvalds has criticized HFS+, saying it is \"probably the worst file system ever\", whose design is \"actively corrupting user data\". He criticized the case insensitivity of file names, a design made worse when Apple extended the file system to support Unicode.[78][79]\n\n\nThe Darwin subsystem in macOS manages the file system, which includes the Unix permissions layer. In 2003 and 2005, two Macworld editors expressed criticism of the permission scheme; Ted Landau called misconfigured permissions \"the most common frustration\" in macOS, while Rob Griffiths suggested that some users may even have to reset permissions every day, a process which can take up to 15 minutes.[80] More recently, another Macworld editor, Dan Frakes, called the procedure of repairing permissions vastly overused.[81] He argues that macOS typically handles permissions properly without user interference, and resetting permissions should only be tried when problems emerge.[82]\n\n\nThe architecture of macOS incorporates a layered design:[83]\nthe layered frameworks aid rapid development of applications by providing existing code for common tasks.[84] Apple provides its own software development tools, most prominently an integrated development environment called Xcode. Xcode provides interfaces to compilers that support several programming languages including C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift. For the Mac transition to Intel processors, it was modified so that developers could build their applications as a universal binary, which provides compatibility with both the Intel-based and PowerPC-based Macintosh lines.[85] First and third-party applications can be controlled programmatically using the AppleScript framework,[86] retained from the classic Mac OS,[87] or using the newer Automator application that offers pre-written tasks that do not require programming knowledge.[88]\n\n\n\n### Software compatibility[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Mac software\n\n\n\nList of macOS versions and the software they run\n\n| Operating system\n | Safari | Mail | QuickTime | iTunes | Messages/iChat | iWork |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 10.0 \"Cheetah\"[note 1] | \u2014\n | 1.x\n | 5.0\n | 2.0.4\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |\n| 10.1 \"Puma\" | 6.3.1\n | 4.7.1\n |\n| 10.2 \"Jaguar\"[note 2] | 1.0.3\n | 6.5.3\n | 6.0.5\n | 2.0\n | Keynote |\n| 10.3 \"Panther\" | 1.3.2\n | 7.5\n | 7.7.1[89] | 2.1[90] | '05\n |\n| 10.4 \"Tiger\" | 4.1.3\n | 2.1.3\n | 7.6.4\n | 9.2.1[91] | 3.0\n | '09\n |\n| 10.5 \"Leopard\" | 5.0.6\n | 3.6\n | 7.7\n | 10.6.3[92] | 4.0\n |\n| 10.6 \"Snow Leopard\" | 5.1.10[93] | 4.5[94] | 10.1\n | 11.4[95] | 5.0\n |\n| 10.7 \"Lion\"[note 3] | 6.1.6\n | Un\u00adknown\n | 12.2.2[96] | 8.0b or 6.0.1\n |\n| 10.8 \"Mountain Lion\" | 6.2.8\n | 10.2\n | 12.4.3[97] | 8.0\n |\n| 10.9 \"Mavericks\" | 9.1.3\n | 7.3\n | 10.3\n | 12.6.2\n | 2013\n |\n| 10.10 \"Yosemite\" | 10.1.2\n | 9.3\n | 10.4\n | 12.8.2\n | 2014\n |\n| 10.11 \"El Capitan\" | 11.1.2\n | 9.3\n |\n| 10.12 \"Sierra\" | 12.1.2\n | 11.0\n | 10.0\n | 2018\n |\n| 10.13 \"High Sierra\" | 13.1.2\n | 11.0\n | 2019\n |\n| 10.14 \"Mojave\" | 14.1.2\n | 12.0\n | 10.5\n | 12.9.5\n | 12.0\n | 2020\n |\n| 10.15 \"Catalina\" | 15.4\n | 13.0\n | \u2014\n | 13.0\n | 2021 partial, 2020\n |\n| 11 \"Big Sur\" | 16.0\n | 14.0\n | 14.0\n | 2022 (12.0)\n |\n| 12 \"Monterey\" | 16.0\n |\n| 13 \"Ventura\" |\n| 14 \"Sonoma\" | 17.0\n | 16.0\n |  |  | 13.0\n |\n\n\n1. **^** iTunes 2.0.4 can only run if Classic is installed.

Afterwards, users could either revert to iChat or upgrade to a newer version of OS X (10.8 \"Mountain Lion\" for US$19.99, or 10.9 \"Mavericks\" or newer for free) to continue using Messages.\n\nApple offered two main APIs to develop software natively for macOS: Cocoa and Carbon. Cocoa was a descendant of APIs inherited from OPENSTEP with no ancestry from the classic Mac OS, while Carbon was an adaptation of classic Mac OS APIs, allowing Mac software to be minimally rewritten to run natively on Mac OS X.[14]\n\n\nThe Cocoa API was created as the result of a 1993 collaboration between NeXT Computer and Sun Microsystems. This heritage is highly visible for Cocoa developers, since the \"NS\" prefix is ubiquitous in the framework, standing variously for **N**eXT**S**TEP or **N**eXT/**S**un. The official OPENSTEP API, published in September 1994, was the first to split the API between Foundation and ApplicationKit and the first to use the \"NS\" prefix.[77] Traditionally, Cocoa programs have been mostly written in Objective-C, with Java as an alternative. However, on July 11, 2005, Apple announced that \"features added to Cocoa in Mac OS X versions later than 10.4 will not be added to the Cocoa-Java programming interface.\"[98] macOS also used to support the Java Platform as a \"preferred software package\"\u2014in practice this means that applications written in Java fit as neatly into the operating system as possible while still being cross-platform compatible, and that graphical user interfaces written in Swing look almost exactly like native Cocoa interfaces. Since 2014, Apple has promoted its new programming language Swift as the preferred language for software development on Apple platforms.\n\n\nApple's original plan with macOS was to require all developers to rewrite their software into the Cocoa APIs. This caused much outcry among existing Mac developers, who threatened to abandon the platform rather than invest in a costly rewrite, and the idea was shelved.[14][99] To permit a smooth transition from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X, the Carbon Application Programming Interface (API) was created.[14] Applications written with Carbon were initially able to run natively on both classic Mac OS and Mac OS X, although this ability was later dropped as Mac OS X developed. Carbon was not included in the first product sold as Mac OS X: the little-used original release of Mac OS X Server 1.0, which also did not include the Aqua interface.[100] Apple limited further development of Carbon from the release of Leopard onwards and announced that Carbon applications would not run at 64-bit.[99][14] A number of macOS applications continued to use Carbon for some time afterwards, especially ones with heritage dating back to the classic Mac OS and for which updates would be difficult, uneconomic or not necessary. This included Microsoft Office up to Office 2016, and Photoshop up to CS5.[101][99] Early versions of macOS could also run some classic Mac OS applications through the Classic Environment with performance limitations; this feature was removed from 10.5 onwards and all Macs using Intel processors.\n\n\nBecause macOS is POSIX compliant, many software packages written for the other Unix-like systems including Linux can be recompiled to run on it, including much scientific and technical software.[102] Third-party projects such as Homebrew, Fink, MacPorts and pkgsrc provide pre-compiled or pre-formatted packages. Apple and others have provided versions of the X Window System graphical interface which can allow these applications to run with an approximation of the macOS look-and-feel.[103][104][105] The current Apple-endorsed method is the open-source XQuartz project; earlier versions could use the X11 application provided by Apple, or before that the XDarwin project.[106]\n\n\nApplications can be distributed to Macs and installed by the user from any source and by any method such as downloading (with or without code signing, available via an Apple developer account) or through the Mac App Store, a marketplace of software maintained by Apple through a process requiring the company's approval. Apps installed through the Mac App Store run within a sandbox, restricting their ability to exchange information with other applications or modify the core operating system and its features. This has been cited as an advantage, by allowing users to install apps with confidence that they should not be able to damage their system, but also as a disadvantage due to blocking the Mac App Store's use for professional applications that require elevated privileges.[107][108] Applications without any code signature cannot be run by default except from a computer's administrator account.[109][110]\n\n\nApple produces macOS applications. Some are included with macOS and some sold separately. This includes iWork, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, iLife, and the database application FileMaker. Numerous other developers also offer software for macOS.\n\n\nIn 2018, Apple introduced an application layer, codenamed Marzipan, to port iOS apps to macOS.[111][112] macOS Mojave included ports of four first-party iOS apps including Home and News, and it was announced that the API would be available for third-party developers to use from 2019.[113][114][115] In 2019, in macOS Catalina, the application layer was made available to third-party developers as Mac Catalyst.[116]\n\n\n\n### Hardware compatibility[edit]\n\n\nList of macOS versions, the supported systems on which they run, and their RAM requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n| Operating system\n | Release year(s)\n | Supported systems[117] | RAM requirement\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 10.0 \u2013 10.2 | 2001 \u2013 2002\n | G3, G4 and G5 iBook and PowerBook, Power Mac and iMac(except PowerBook G3 \"Kanga\") | 128 MB\n |\n| 10.3 | 2003\n | Macs with a New World ROM[118] |\n| 10.4 | 2004\n | Macs with built-in FireWire and either a New World ROM or Intel processor\n | 256 MB\n |\n| 10.5 | 2006\n | Select G4, G5, and Intel Macs (32-bit or 64-bit) at 867\u00a0MHz or fasterClassic support dropped from 10.5 and later.\n | 512 MB\n |\n| 10.6 | 2008\n | Intel Macs (32-bit or 64-bit)[119] | 1 GB\n |\n| 10.7 | 2010\n | Intel Macs (64-bit)[119]Rosetta support dropped from 10.7 and later.\n | 2 GB\n |\n| 10.8 \u2013 10.11 | 2012 \u2013 2015\n | * *Laptops*: MacBook (Aluminum, Late 2008 or later), MacBook Air (Late 2008 or later), MacBook Pro (Mid 2007 or later)\n* *Desktops*: Mac Mini (Early 2009 or later), iMac (Mid 2007 or later), Mac Pro (Early 2008 or later)\n* *Servers*: Xserve (Early 2009)\n |\n| 10.12 \u2013 10.13 | 2016 \u2013 2017\n | * *Laptops*: MacBook (Late 2009 or later), MacBook Air (Late 2010 or later), MacBook Pro (Mid 2010 or later)\n* *Desktops*: Mac Mini (Mid 2010 or later), iMac (Late 2009 or later), iMac Pro (2017) (macOS 10.13), Mac Pro (Mid 2010 or later)\n |\n| 10.14 | 2018\n | * *Laptops*: MacBook (Early 2015 or later), MacBook Air (Mid 2012 or later), MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 or later)\n* *Desktops*: Mac Mini (Late 2012 or later), iMac (Late 2012 or later), iMac Pro (2017), Mac Pro (Mid 2010 or later[120])\n |\n| 10.15 | 2019\n | * *Laptops*: MacBook (Early 2015 or later), MacBook Air (Mid 2012 or later), MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 or later)\n* *Desktops*: Mac Mini (Late 2012 or later), iMac (Late 2012 or later), iMac Pro (2017), Mac Pro (Late 2013 or later)\n | 4 GB\n |\n| 11 | 2020\n | * *Laptops*: MacBook (Early 2015 or later), MacBook Air (Mid 2013 or later), MacBook Pro (Late 2013 or later)\n* *Desktops*: Mac Mini (Late 2014 or later), iMac (Mid 2014 or later), iMac Pro (2017), Mac Pro (Late 2013 or later)\n |\n| 12 | 2021\n | * *Laptops*: MacBook (Early 2016 or later), MacBook Air (Early 2015 or later), MacBook Pro (Early 2015 or later)\n* *Desktops*: Mac Mini (Late 2014 or later), iMac (Late 2015 or later), iMac Pro (2017), Mac Studio (2022), Mac Pro (Late 2013 or later)\n |\n| 13 | 2022\n | * *Laptops*: MacBook (2017), MacBook Air (2018 or later), MacBook Pro (2017 or later)\n* *Desktops*: Mac Mini (2018 or later), iMac (2017 or later), iMac Pro (2017), Mac Studio (2022 or later), Mac Pro (2019 or later)\n | 8 GB\n |\n| 14 | 2023\n | * *Laptops*: MacBook Air (2018 or later), MacBook Pro (2018 or later)\n* *Desktops*: Mac Mini (2018 or later), iMac (2019 or later), iMac Pro (2017), Mac Studio (2022 or later), Mac Pro (2019 or later)\n |\n\n\nTools such as XPostFacto and patches applied to the installation media have been developed by third parties to enable installation of newer versions of macOS on systems not officially supported by Apple. This includes a number of pre-G3 Power Macintosh systems that can be made to run up to and including Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, all G3-based Macs which can run up to and including Tiger, and sub-867\u00a0MHz G4 Macs can run Leopard by removing the restriction from the installation DVD or entering a command in the Mac's Open Firmware interface to tell the Leopard Installer that it has a clock rate of 867\u00a0MHz or greater. Except for features requiring specific hardware such as graphics acceleration or DVD writing, the operating system offers the same functionality on all supported hardware.\n\n\nAs most Mac hardware components, or components similar to those, since the Intel transition are available for purchase,[121] some technology-capable groups have developed software to install macOS on non-Apple computers. These are referred to as Hackintoshes, a portmanteau of the words \"hack\" and \"Macintosh\". This violates Apple's EULA (and is therefore unsupported by Apple technical support, warranties etc.), but communities that cater to personal users, who do not install for resale and profit, have generally been ignored by Apple.[122][123][124] These self-made computers allow more flexibility and customization of hardware, but at a cost of leaving the user more responsible for their own machine, such as on matter of data integrity or security.[125] Psystar, a business that attempted to profit from selling macOS on non-Apple certified hardware, was sued by Apple in 2008.[126]\n\n\n\n### PowerPC\u2013Intel transition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac transition to Intel processors\n\n![](image)Steve Jobs talks about the transition to Intel processors.\nIn April 2002, eWeek announced a rumor that Apple had a version of Mac OS X code-named Marklar, which ran on Intel x86 processors. The idea behind Marklar was to keep Mac OS X running on an alternative platform should Apple become dissatisfied with the progress of the PowerPC platform.[127] These rumors subsided until late in May 2005, when various media outlets, such as *The Wall Street Journal*[128] and CNET,[129] announced that Apple would unveil Marklar in the coming months.[130][131][132]\n\n\nOn June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs announced in his keynote address at WWDC that Apple would be making the transition from PowerPC to Intel processors over the following two years, and that Mac OS X would support both platforms during the transition. Jobs also confirmed rumors that Apple had versions of Mac OS X running on Intel processors for most of its developmental life. Intel-based Macs would run a new recompiled version of OS X along with Rosetta, a binary translation layer which enables software compiled for PowerPC Mac OS X to run on Intel Mac OS X machines.[133] The system was included with Mac OS X versions up to version 10.6.8.[134] Apple dropped support for Classic mode on the new Intel Macs. Third party emulation software such as Mini vMac, Basilisk II and SheepShaver provided support for some early versions of Mac OS. A new version of Xcode and the underlying command-line compilers supported building universal binaries that would run on either architecture.[135]\n\n\nPowerPC-only software is supported with Apple's official binary translation software, Rosetta, though applications eventually had to be rewritten to run properly on the newer versions released for Intel processors. Apple initially encouraged developers to produce universal binaries with support for both PowerPC and Intel.[136] PowerPC binaries suffer a performance penalty when run on Intel Macs through Rosetta. Moreover, some PowerPC software, such as kernel extensions and System Preferences plugins, are not supported on Intel Macs at all. Plugins for Safari need to be compiled for the same platform as Safari, so when Safari is running on Intel, it requires plug-ins that have been compiled as Intel-only or universal binaries, so PowerPC-only plug-ins will not work.[137] While Intel Macs can run PowerPC, Intel, and universal binaries, PowerPC Macs support only universal and PowerPC builds.\n\n\nSupport for the PowerPC platform was dropped following the transition. In 2009, Apple announced at WWDC that Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard would drop support for PowerPC processors and be Intel-only.[138] Rosetta continued to be offered as an optional download or installation choice in Snow Leopard before it was discontinued with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.[139] In addition, new versions of Mac OS X first- and third-party software increasingly required Intel processors, including new versions of iLife, iWork, Aperture and Logic Pro.\n\n\n\n### Intel\u2013Apple silicon transition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac transition to Apple silicon\n\n![](image)An illustration of Apple's M1 processor.\nRumors of Apple shifting Macs to the ARM processors used by iOS devices began circulating as early as 2011,[140] and ebbed and flowed throughout the 2010s.[141] Rumors intensified in 2020, when numerous reports announced that the company would announce its shift to its custom processors at WWDC.[142]\n\n\nApple officially announced its shift to processors designed in-house on June 22, 2020, at WWDC 2020, with the transition planned to last for two years.[143] The first release of macOS to support ARM is macOS Big Sur. Big Sur and later versions support Universal 2 binaries, which are applications consisting of both Intel (x86-64) and Apple silicon (AArch64) binaries; when launched, only the appropriate binary is run. Additionally, Intel binaries can be run on Apple silicon-based Macs using the Rosetta 2 binary translation software.\n\n\nThe change in processor architecture allows Macs with ARM processors to be able to run iOS and iPadOS apps natively.[144]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n### Aqua user interface[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Aqua (user interface)\n\n![](image)The original Aqua user interface as seen in the Mac OS X Public Beta from 2000.\nOne of the major differences between the classic Mac OS and the current macOS was the addition of Aqua, a graphical user interface with water-like elements, in the first major release of Mac OS X. Every window element, text, graphic, or widget is drawn on-screen using spatial anti-aliasing technology.[145] ColorSync, a technology introduced many years before, was improved and built into the core drawing engine, to provide color matching for printing and multimedia professionals.[146] Also, drop shadows were added around windows and isolated text elements to provide a sense of depth. New interface elements were integrated, including sheets (dialog boxes attached to specific windows) and drawers, which would slide out and provide options.\n\n\nThe use of soft edges, translucent colors, and pinstripes, similar to the hardware design of the first iMacs, brought more texture and color to the user interface when compared to what Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X Server 1.0's \"Platinum\" appearance had offered. According to Siracusa, the introduction of Aqua and its departure from the then conventional look \"hit like a ton of bricks.\"[147]\nBruce Tognazzini (who founded the original Apple Human Interface Group) said that the Aqua interface in Mac OS X 10.0 represented a step backwards in usability compared with the original Mac OS interface.[148][149]\nThird-party developers started producing skins for customizable applications and other operating systems which mimicked the Aqua appearance. To some extent, Apple has used the successful transition to this new design as leverage, at various times threatening legal action against people who make or distribute software with an interface the company says is derived from its copyrighted design.[150]\n\n\nApple has continued to change aspects of the macOS appearance and design, particularly with tweaks to the appearance of windows and the menu bar. Since 2012, Apple has sold many of its Mac models with high-resolution Retina displays, and macOS and its APIs have extensive support for resolution-independent development on supporting high-resolution displays. Reviewers have described Apple's support for the technology as superior to that on Windows.[151][152][153]\n\n\nThe human interface guidelines published by Apple for macOS are followed by many applications, giving them consistent user interface and keyboard shortcuts.[154] In addition, new services for applications are included, which include spelling and grammar checkers, special characters palette, color picker, font chooser and dictionary; these global features are present in every Cocoa application, adding consistency. The graphics system OpenGL composites windows onto the screen to allow hardware-accelerated drawing. This technology, introduced in version 10.2, is called Quartz Extreme, a component of Quartz. Quartz's internal imaging model correlates well with the Portable Document Format (PDF) imaging model, making it easy to output PDF to multiple devices.[146] As a side result, PDF viewing and creating PDF documents from any application are built-in features.[155] Reflecting its popularity with design users, macOS also has system support for a variety of professional video and image formats and includes an extensive pre-installed font library, featuring many prominent brand-name designs.[156]\n\n\n\n### Components[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of macOS built-in apps\n\nThe Finder is a file browser allowing quick access to all areas of the computer, which has been modified throughout subsequent releases of macOS.[157][158] Quick Look has been part of the Finder since version 10.5. It allows for dynamic previews of files, including videos and multi-page documents without opening any other applications. Spotlight, a file searching technology which has been integrated into the Finder since version 10.4, allows rapid real-time searches of data files; mail messages; photos; and other information based on item properties (metadata) or content.[159][160] macOS makes use of a Dock, which holds file and folder shortcuts as well as minimized windows.\n\n\nApple added Expos\u00e9 in version 10.3 (called Mission Control since version 10.7), a feature which includes three functions to help accessibility between windows and desktop. Its functions are to instantly display all open windows as thumbnails for easy navigation to different tasks, display all open windows as thumbnails from the current application, and hide all windows to access the desktop.[161] FileVault is optional encryption of the user's files with the 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128).[162]\n\n\nFeatures introduced in version 10.4 include Automator, an application designed to create an automatic workflow for different tasks;[163] Dashboard, a full-screen group of small applications called desktop widgets that can be called up and dismissed in one keystroke;[164] and Front Row, a media viewer interface accessed by the Apple Remote.[165] Sync Services allows applications to access a centralized extensible database for various elements of user data, including calendar and contact items. The operating system then managed conflicting edits and data consistency.[166]\n\n\nAll system icons are scalable up to 512\u00d7512 pixels as of version 10.5 to accommodate various places where they appear in larger size, including for example the Cover Flow view, a three-dimensional graphical user interface included with iTunes, the Finder, and other Apple products for visually skimming through files and digital media libraries via cover artwork. That version also introduced Spaces, a virtual desktop implementation which enables the user to have more than one desktop and display them in an Expos\u00e9-like interface;[167] an automatic backup technology called Time Machine, which allows users to view and restore previous versions of files and application data;[168] and Screen Sharing was built in for the first time.[169]\n\n\nIn more recent releases, Apple has developed support for emoji characters by including the proprietary Apple Color Emoji font.[170][171] Apple has also connected macOS with social networks such as Twitter and Facebook through the addition of share buttons for content such as pictures and text.[172] Apple has brought several applications and features that originally debuted in iOS, its mobile operating system, to macOS in recent releases, notably the intelligent personal assistant Siri, which was introduced in version 10.12 of macOS.[173][174]\n\n\n\n### Multilingual support[edit]\n\n\nThere are 39 system languages available in macOS for the user at the moment of installation; the system language is used throughout the entire operating system environment.[175] Input methods for typing in dozens of scripts can be chosen independently of the system language.[176] Recent updates have added increased support for Chinese characters and interconnections with popular social networks in China.[177][178][179][180]\n\n\n\n### Updating methods[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nmacOS can be updated using the Software Update settings pane in System Settings or the `softwareupdate` command line utility. Until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, a separate Software Update application performed this functionality. In Mountain Lion and later, this was merged into the Mac App Store application, although the underlying update mechanism remains unchanged and is fundamentally different from the download mechanism used when purchasing an App Store application. In macOS 10.14 Mojave, the updating function was moved again to the Software Update settings pane.\n\n\nMost Macs receive six or seven years of macOS updates. After a new major release of macOS, the previous two releases still receive occasional updates, but many security vulnerabilities are only patched in the latest macOS release.[181]\n\n\n\n## Release history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: macOS version history \u00a7\u00a0Releases\n\n![](image)\n\nTimeline of versions\n\nMac OS X versions were named after big cats, with the exception of Mac OS X Server 1.0 and the original public beta, from Mac OS X 10.0 until OS X 10.9 Mavericks, when Apple switched to using California locations. Prior to its release, version 10.0 was code named internally at Apple as \"Cheetah\" , and Mac OS X 10.1 was code named internally as \"Puma\". After the immense buzz surrounding Mac OS X 10.2, codenamed \"Jaguar\", Apple's product marketing began openly using the code names to promote the operating system. Mac OS X 10.3 was marketed as \"Panther\", Mac OS X 10.4 as \"Tiger\", Mac OS X 10.5 as \"Leopard\", Mac OS X 10.6 as \"Snow Leopard\", Mac OS X 10.7 as \"Lion\", OS X 10.8 as \"Mountain Lion\", and OS X 10.9 as \"Mavericks\".\n\n\n\"Panther\", \"Tiger\" and \"Leopard\" are registered as trademarks of Apple,[182][183][184] but \"Cheetah\", \"Puma\" and \"Jaguar\" have never been registered. Apple has also registered \"Lynx\" and \"Cougar\" as trademarks, though these were allowed to lapse.[185][186] Computer retailer Tiger Direct sued Apple for its use of the name \"Tiger\". On May 16, 2005, a US federal court in the Southern District of Florida ruled that Apple's use did not infringe on Tiger Direct's trademark.[187]\n\n\n\n### Mac OS X Public Beta[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac OS X Public Beta\n\nOn September 13, 2000, Apple released a $29.95[188] \"preview\" version of Mac OS X, internally codenamed Kodiak, to gain feedback from users.\n\n\nThe \"PB\", as it was known, marked the first public availability of the Aqua interface and Apple made many changes to the UI based on customer feedback. Mac OS X Public Beta expired and ceased to function in Spring 2001.[189]\n\n\n\n### Mac OS X 10.0 (Cheetah)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac OS X 10.0\n\n![](image)Screenshot of OS X 10.0\nOn March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah).[190]\nThe initial version was slow,[191] incomplete,[192] and had very few applications available at launch, mostly from independent developers.[193] While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve.[192] Simply releasing Mac OS X was received by the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment,[192] for attempts to overhaul the Mac OS had been underway since 1996, and delayed by countless setbacks.\n\n\n\n### Mac OS X 10.1 (Puma)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac OS X 10.1\n\nLater that year on September 25, 2001, Mac OS X 10.1 (internally codenamed Puma) was released. It featured increased performance and provided missing features, such as DVD playback. Apple released 10.1 as a free upgrade CD for 10.0 users, in addition to the US$129 boxed version for people running Mac OS 9. It was discovered that the upgrade CDs were full install CDs that could be used with Mac OS 9 systems by removing a specific file; Apple later re-released the CDs in an actual stripped-down format that did not facilitate installation on such systems.[194] On January 7, 2002, Apple announced that Mac OS X was to be the default operating system for all Macintosh products by the end of that month.[195]\n\n\n\n### Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac OS X Jaguar\n\nOn August 23, 2002,[196] Apple followed up with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, the first release to use its code name as part of the branding.[197]\nIt brought great raw performance improvements, a sleeker look, and many powerful user-interface enhancements (over 150, according to Apple[198]), including Quartz Extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce2 MX AGP-based video card with at least 16\u00a0MB of VRAM, a system-wide repository for contact information in the new Address Book, and an instant messaging client named iChat.[199] The Happy Mac which had appeared during the Mac OS startup sequence for almost 18 years was replaced with a large grey Apple logo with the introduction of Mac OS X v10.2.[200]\n\n\n\n### Mac OS X 10.3 Panther[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac OS X Panther\n\nMac OS X v10.3 Panther was released on October 24, 2003. It significantly improved performance and incorporated the most extensive update yet to the user interface. Panther included as many or more new features as Jaguar had the year before, including an updated Finder, incorporating a brushed-metal interface, Fast user switching, Expos\u00e9 (Window manager), FileVault, Safari, iChat AV (which added video conferencing features to iChat), improved Portable Document Format (PDF) rendering and much greater Microsoft Windows interoperability.[201] Support for some early G3 computers such as \"beige\" Power Macs and \"WallStreet\" PowerBooks was discontinued.[202]\n\n\n\n### Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac OS X Tiger\n\n![](image)Screenshot of Tiger\nMac OS X 10.4 Tiger was released on April 29, 2005. Apple stated that Tiger contained more than 200 new features.[203] As with Panther, certain older machines were no longer supported; Tiger requires a Mac with 256\u00a0MB and a built-in FireWire port.[118] Among the new features, Tiger introduced Spotlight, Dashboard, Smart Folders, updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes, QuickTime 7, Safari 2, Automator, VoiceOver, Core Image and Core Video. The initial release of the Apple TV used a modified version of Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services.[204] On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, with the exception of the Intel release lacking support for the Classic environment.[205]\n\n\n\n### Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac OS X Leopard\n\nMac OS X 10.5 Leopard was released on October 26, 2007. It was called by Apple \"the largest update of Mac OS X\". It brought more than 300 new features.[206] Leopard supports both PowerPC- and Intel x86-based Macintosh computers; support for the G3 processor was dropped and the G4 processor required a minimum clock rate of 867\u00a0MHz, and at least 512\u00a0MB of RAM to be installed. The single DVD works for all supported Macs (including 64-bit machines). New features include a new look, an updated Finder, Time Machine, Spaces, Boot Camp pre-installed,[207] full support for 64-bit applications (including graphical applications), new features in Mail and iChat, and a number of new security features. Leopard is an Open Brand UNIX 03 registered product on the Intel platform. It was also the first BSD-based OS to receive UNIX 03 certification.[208][209] Leopard dropped support for the Classic Environment and all Classic applications.[210] It was the final version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC architecture.[211]\n\n\n\n### Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac OS X Snow Leopard\n\nMac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was released on August 28, 2009. Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of Mac OS X, Snow Leopard focused on \"under the hood\" changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system. For most users, the most noticeable changes were: the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean install compared to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, a more responsive Finder rewritten in Cocoa, faster Time Machine backups, more reliable and user-friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, as well as a faster Safari web browser. Snow Leopard only supported machines with Intel CPUs, required at least 1\u00a0GB of RAM, and dropped default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture (Rosetta could be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC-only applications).[212]\n\n\nSnow Leopard also featured new 64-bit technology capable of supporting greater amounts of RAM, improved support for multi-core processors through Grand Central Dispatch, and advanced GPU performance with OpenCL.[213]\n\n\nThe 10.6.6 update introduced support for the Mac App Store, Apple's digital distribution platform for macOS applications.[214]\n\n\n\n![](image)OS X Lion was announced at WWDC 2011 at Moscone West.\n### OS X 10.7 Lion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: OS X Lion\n\nOS X 10.7 Lion was released on July 20, 2011. It brought developments made in Apple's iOS, such as an easily navigable display of installed applications called Launchpad and a greater use of multi-touch gestures, to the Mac. This release removed Rosetta, making it incompatible with PowerPC applications.[139]\n\n\nChanges made to the GUI include auto-hiding scrollbars that only appear when they are used, and Mission Control which unifies Expos\u00e9, Spaces, Dashboard, and full-screen applications within a single interface.[215] Apple also made changes to applications: they resume in the same state as they were before they were closed, similar to iOS. Documents auto-save by default.[216]\n\n\n\n### OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: OS X Mountain Lion\n\nOS X 10.8 Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012.[68] Following the release of Lion the previous year, it was the first of the annual rather than two-yearly updates to OS X (and later macOS), which also closely aligned with the annual iOS operating system updates. It incorporates some features seen in iOS 5, which include Game Center, support for iMessage in the new Messages messaging application, and Reminders as a to-do list app separate from iCal (which is renamed as Calendar, like the iOS app). It also includes support for storing iWork documents in iCloud.[217] Notification Center, which makes its debut in Mountain Lion, is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS 5.0 and higher. Application pop-ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen, and the Center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen. Mountain Lion also includes more Chinese features including support for Baidu as an option for Safari search engine, QQ, 163.com and 126.com services for Mail, Contacts and Calendar, Youku, Tudou and Sina Weibo are integrated into share sheets.[180]\n\n\nStarting with Mountain Lion, Apple software updates (including the OS) are distributed via the App Store.[218] This updating mechanism replaced the Apple Software Update utility.[219]\n\n\n\n![](image)A screenshot of OS X Mavericks\n### OS X 10.9 Mavericks[edit]\n\n\nMain article: OS X Mavericks\n\nOS X 10.9 Mavericks was released on October 22, 2013. It was a free upgrade to all users running Snow Leopard or later with a 64-bit Intel processor.[220] Its changes include the addition of the previously iOS-only Maps and iBooks applications, improvements to the Notification Center, enhancements to several applications, and many under-the-hood improvements.[221]\n\n\n\n### OS X 10.10 Yosemite[edit]\n\n\nMain article: OS X Yosemite\n\nOS X 10.10 Yosemite was released on October 16, 2014. It features a redesigned user interface similar to that of iOS 7, intended to feature a more minimal, text-based 'flat' design, with use of translucency effects and intensely saturated colors.[222] Apple's showcase new feature in Yosemite is Handoff, which enables users with iPhones running iOS 8.1 or later to answer phone calls, receive and send SMS messages, and complete unfinished iPhone emails on their Mac. As of OS X 10.10.3, Photos replaced iPhoto and Aperture.[223]\n\n\n\n### OS X 10.11 El Capitan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: OS X El Capitan\n\n![](image)Screenshot of El Capitan\nOS X 10.11 El Capitan was released on September 30, 2015. Similar to Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, Apple described this release as emphasizing \"refinements to the Mac experience\" and \"improvements to system performance\".[224] Refinements include public transport built into the Maps application, GUI improvements to the Notes application, adopting San Francisco as the system font for clearer legibility, and the introduction of System Integrity Protection.\n\n\nThe Metal API, first introduced in iOS 8, was also included in this operating system for \"all Macs since 2012\".[225] According to Apple, Metal accelerates system-level rendering by up to 50 percent, resulting in faster graphics performance for everyday apps. Metal also delivers up to 10 times faster draw call performance for more fluid experience in games and pro apps.[226]\n\n\n\n### macOS 10.12 Sierra[edit]\n\n\nMain article: macOS Sierra\n\nmacOS 10.12 Sierra was released to the public on September 20, 2016. New features include the addition of Siri, Optimized Storage, and updates to Photos, Messages, and iTunes.[227][228]\n\n\n\n### macOS 10.13 High Sierra[edit]\n\n\nMain article: macOS High Sierra\n\nmacOS 10.13 High Sierra was released to the public on September 25, 2017.[229] Like OS X El Capitan and OS X Mountain Lion, High Sierra is a refinement-based update having very few new features visible to the user, including updates to Safari, Photos, and Mail, among other changes.[230]\n\n\nThe major change under the hood is the switch to the Apple File System, optimized for the solid-state storage used in most new Mac computers.[231]\n\n\n\n### macOS 10.14 Mojave[edit]\n\n\nMain article: macOS Mojave\n\nmacOS 10.14 Mojave was released on September 24, 2018.[49] The update introduced a system-wide dark mode and several new apps lifted from iOS, such as Apple News. It was the first version to require a GPU that supports Metal. Mojave also changed the system software update mechanism from the App Store (where it had been since OS X Mountain Lion) to a new panel in System Preferences. App updates remain in the App Store.\n\n\n\n### macOS 10.15 Catalina[edit]\n\n\nMain article: macOS Catalina\n\nmacOS 10.15 Catalina was released on October 7, 2019.[232] Updates included enhanced voice control, and bundled apps for music, video, and podcasts that together replace the functions of iTunes, and the ability to use an iPad as an external monitor. Catalina officially dropped support for 32-bit applications.[233]\n\n\n\n### macOS 11 Big Sur[edit]\n\n\nMain article: macOS Big Sur\n\nmacOS Big Sur was announced during the WWDC keynote speech on June 22, 2020,[234] and it was made available to the general public on November 12, 2020. This is the first time the major version number of the operating system has been incremented since the Mac OS X Public Beta in 2000. It brings ARM support,[235] new icons, and aesthetic user interface changes to the system.[236]\n\n\n\n### macOS 12 Monterey[edit]\n\n\nMain article: macOS Monterey\n\nmacOS Monterey was announced during the WWDC keynote speech on June 7, 2021, and released on October 25, 2021, introducing Universal Control (which allows input devices to be used with multiple devices simultaneously), Focus (which allows selectively limiting notifications and alerts depending on user-defined user/work modes), Shortcuts (a task automation framework previously only available on iOS and iPadOS expected to replace Automator), a redesigned Safari Web browser, and updates and improvements to FaceTime.[237]\n\n\n\n### macOS 13 Ventura[edit]\n\n\nMain article: macOS Ventura\n\nmacOS Ventura was announced during the WWDC keynote speech on June 6, 2022[238] and released on October 24, 2022.[239] It came with the redesigned System Preferences to a more iOS-like settings, and now with the new Weather and Clock app for Mac. Users can use an iPhone as a webcam for video conferencing.\n\n\n\n### macOS 14 Sonoma[edit]\n\n\nMain article: macOS Sonoma\n\nmacOS Sonoma was announced during the WWDC keynote speech on June 5, 2023. It was released on September 26, 2023.[240]\n\n\n\n## Security[edit]\n\n\nApple publishes Apple Platform Security documents to lay out the security protections built into macOS and Mac hardware.[241]\n\n\nmacOS supports additional hardware-based security features on Apple silicon Macs:[242]\n\n\n\n* Write xor execute prevents some security vulnerabilities by making memory pages either writable or executable, but not both.[242]\n* PCIe or Thunderbolt devices are prevented by IOMMUs from reading system memory that is not explicitly mapped to them, unlike Intel-based Macs.[242][243]\n\n\nmacOS's optional Lockdown Mode enables additional protections, such as disabling just-in-time compilation for Safari's JavaScript engine, preventing some vulnerabilities.[244]\n\n\nOnly the latest major release of macOS (currently macOS Sonoma) receives patches for all known security vulnerabilities. The previous two releases receive some security updates, but not for all vulnerabilities known to Apple. In 2021, Apple fixed a critical privilege escalation vulnerability in macOS Big Sur, but a fix remained unavailable for the previous release, macOS Catalina, for 234 days, until Apple was informed that the vulnerability was being used to infect the computers of people who visited Hong Kong pro-democracy websites.[245][246]\n\n\nmacOS Ventura added support for Rapid Security Response (RSR) updates. These smaller updates may require a reboot, but take less than a minute to install.[247][248] In an analysis, Hackintosh developer Mykola Grymalyuk noted that RSR updates can only fix userland vulunerability, and cannot patch the macOS kernel.[249]\n\n\n\n### Malware and spyware[edit]\n\n\nMain article: macOS malware\n\nIn its earlier years, Mac OS X enjoyed a near-absence of the types of malware and spyware that have affected Microsoft Windows users.[250][251][252] macOS has a smaller usage share compared to Windows.[253] Worms, as well as potential vulnerabilities, were noted in 2006, which led some industry analysts and anti-virus companies to issue warnings that Apple's Mac OS X is not immune to malware.[254] Increasing market share coincided with additional reports of a variety of attacks.[255] In early 2011, Mac OS X experienced a large increase in malware attacks,[256] and malware such as Mac Defender, MacProtector, and MacGuard was seen as an increasing problem for Mac users. At first, the malware installer required the user to enter the administrative password, but later versions installed without user input.[257] Initially, Apple support staff were instructed not to assist in the removal of the malware or admit the existence of the malware issue, but as the malware spread, a support document was issued. Apple announced an OS X update to fix the problem. An estimated 100,000 users were affected.[258][259] Apple releases security updates for macOS regularly,[260] as well as signature files containing malware signatures for Xprotect, an anti-malware feature part of File Quarantine present since Mac OS X Snow Leopard.[261]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Usage share[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Usage share of operating systems\n\nAs of January\u00a02023[update], macOS is the second-most widely used general-purpose desktop operating system used on the World Wide Web following Microsoft Windows, with a 15.33% usage share according to statistics compiled by Statcounter GlobalStats.[262]\n\n\n\n### Promotion[edit]\n\n\nAs a device company, Apple has mostly promoted macOS to sell Macs, with promotion of macOS updates focused on existing users, promotion at Apple Store and other retail partners, or through events for developers. In larger scale advertising campaigns, Apple specifically promoted macOS as better for handling media and other home-user applications, and comparing Mac OS X (especially versions Tiger and Leopard) with the heavy criticism Microsoft received for the long-awaited Windows Vista operating system.[263][264]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Dock (macOS)\n* Classic Mac OS (1984\u20132001)\n* Comparison of BSD operating systems\n* Comparison of operating systems\n* List of operating systems\n* List of Mac software\n* Mac operating systems\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"What Is the I/O Kit?\". *IOKit Fundamentals*.

It is frequently praised for its dramatic scenery. Big Sur has been called the \"longest and most scenic stretch of undeveloped coastline in the contiguous United States\",[1] a sublime \"national treasure that demands extraordinary procedures to protect it from development\",[2] and \"one of the most beautiful coastlines anywhere in the world, an isolated stretch of road, mythic in reputation\".[3] The views, redwood forests, hiking, beaches, and other recreational opportunities have made Big Sur a popular destination for visitors from across the world. With 4.5 to 7 million visitors annually,[4] it is among the top tourist destinations in the United States, comparable to Yosemite National Park, but with considerably fewer services, and less parking, roads, and related infrastructure.[5][6][7][8][9]\n\n\nBig Sur Village is a collection of small roadside businesses and homes.[10]:\u200a2 The larger region known as Big Sur does not have specific boundaries but is generally considered to include the 71-mile (114\u00a0km) segment of California State Route 1 between Malpaso Creek near Carmel Highlands[11] in the north and San Carp\u00f3foro Creek near San Simeon in the south,[12] as well as the entire Santa Lucia range between these creeks.[10] The interior region is mostly uninhabited, while the coast remains relatively isolated and sparsely populated, with between 1,800 and 2,000 year-round residents[13] and relatively few visitor accommodations scattered among four small settlements. The region remained one of the most inaccessible areas of California and the entire United States until, after 18 years of construction, the Carmel\u2013San Simeon Highway (now signed as part of State Route 1) was completed in 1937. Along with the ocean views, this winding, narrow road, often cut into the face of towering seaside cliffs, dominates the visitor's experience of Big Sur. The highway has been closed more than 55 times by landslides, and in May 2017, a 2,000,000-cubic-foot (57,000\u00a0m3) slide blocked the highway at Mud Creek, north of Salmon Creek near the San Luis Obispo County line, to just south of Gorda. The road was reopened on July 18, 2018.\n\n\nThe region is protected by the Big Sur Local Coastal Plan, which preserves it as \"open space, a small residential community, and agricultural ranching.\"[14] Approved in 1986, the plan is one of the most restrictive local-use programs in the state,[15] and is widely regarded as one of the most restrictive documents of its kind anywhere.[16] The program protects viewsheds from the highway and many vantage points, and severely restricts the density of development. About 60% of the coastal region is owned by governmental or private agencies which do not allow any development. The majority of the interior region is part of the Los Padres National Forest, Ventana Wilderness, Silver Peak Wilderness or Fort Hunter Liggett.\n\n\n\n\n## Location[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Approximate boundaries of the Big Sur region\nBig Sur is not an incorporated town but a region without formal boundaries in California's Central Coast region.[17] The region is often confused with the small community of buildings and services 26 miles (42\u00a0km) south of Carmel in the Big Sur River valley, sometimes referred to by locals as Big Sur Village, but officially known as Big Sur.[17][18][19]:\u200a8[20]:\u200a7[21] Some visitors think Big Sur only refers to Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park, whose environmental setting is extremely different from the overall rocky coastal environment.[22]\n\n\n\n### Historical boundaries[edit]\n\n\nThe various informal boundaries applied to the region have gradually expanded north and south over time. Esther Pfeiffer Ewoldson, who was born in 1904 and was a granddaughter of Big Sur pioneers Michael and Barbara Pfeiffer, wrote that the region extended from the Little Sur River 23 miles (37\u00a0km) south to Slates Hot Springs. Members of the Harlan Family, who homesteaded the Lucia region 9 miles (14\u00a0km) south of Slates Hot Springs, said that Big Sur was \"miles and miles to the north of us.\"[19]:\u200a6 Prior to the construction of Highway 1, residents on the south coast had little contact with residents to the north of them.[19]\n\n\n\n### Northern and southern boundaries[edit]\n\n\nMost current descriptions of the area refer to Malpaso Creek 4.5 miles (7.2\u00a0km) south of the Carmel River as the northern border.[11][*failed verification*] The southern border is generally accepted to be San Carp\u00f3foro Creek in San Luis Obispo County.[12]\n\n\n\n### Settlements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of Gorda, one of the small clusters of services in Big Sur\nThe Big Sur region is largely rural and the 1,800 to 2,000 residents are widely distributed. There are a concentration of homes in the north at Palo Colorado Canyon, Big Sur Village, and Posts. Other residential areas include Otter Cove, Garrapata Ridge, Garrapata Canyon, Bixby Canyon, Pfeiffer Ridge, Sycamore Canyon, Coastlands, and Partington Ridge.\n\n\nIn the south, residents are in the vicinity of Slates Hot Springs, Plaskett, Lucia, and Gorda. Homes are also located near Burns Creek, Buck Creek to Lime Creek, Plaskett Ridge, and Redwood Gulch.[23]\n\n\n\n### Inland extent[edit]\n\n\nThe vast majority of visitors only see Big Sur's dramatic coastline and consider the Big Sur region to include only the coastal flanks of the Santa Lucia Mountains, which at various points extend from 3 to 12 miles (5 to 19\u00a0km) inland.[24]\n\n\nSome residents place the eastern border at the boundaries of the vast inland areas comprising the Los Padres National Forest, Ventana Wilderness, and Silver Peak Wilderness, or the unpopulated regions all the way to the eastern foothills of the Santa Lucia Mountains.[10] Author and local historian Jeff Norman considered Big Sur to extend inland to include the watersheds that drain into the Pacific Ocean.[20]:\u200a7\n\n\nAuthor Lillian Ross wrote about life in Big Sur in several books. She and her husband Harry Dick Ross lived in southern Big Sur near Lime Creek beginning in 1939. Harry, a wood sculptor, worked at Hearst's estate in San Simeon as a tile-setter. She famously described Big Sur as \"not a place at all but a state of mind.\"[25][26][27]\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Big Sur: rocky coast, fog and giant kelp\nThe name \"Big Sur\" has its origins in the area's early Spanish history. While the Portol\u00e1 expedition was exploring Alta California, they arrived at San Carp\u00f3foro Canyon near present-day San Simeon on September 13, 1769. Unable to penetrate the difficult terrain along the coast, they detoured inland through the San Antonio and Salinas Valleys before arriving at Monterey Bay, where they founded Monterey and named it the provincial capital.[28]\n\n\nThe Spanish referred to the vast and relatively unexplored coastal region to the south of Monterey as *el pa\u00eds grande del sur*, meaning 'the big country of the south'. This was often shortened to *el sur grande* 'the big south'.[29][30] The two major rivers draining this portion of the coast were named El Rio Grande del Sur and El Rio Chiquito del Sur.[20]:\u200a7\n\n\nThe first recorded use of the name *el Sud* (meaning 'the South') was on a map of the Rancho El Sur land grant given by Governor Jos\u00e9 Figueroa to Juan Bautista Alvarado on July 30, 1834.[31] The first American use of the name 'Sur' was by the United States Coast Survey in 1851, which renamed a point of land that looked like an island and was shaped like a trumpet, known to the Spanish as *Morro de la Trompa* and *Punta Que Parece Isla*, to Point Sur.[21]\n\n\nBig Sur's first post office was named \"Posts\" after William Brainard Post, in whose home it was located. He had obtained a patent to land at the top of the grade south of the Big Sur River, where he built a home in 1867.[32] Confusion ensued when mail intended for the Presidio was sent to Big Sur, and mail for the local residents was sent to the military post. The residents changed the name of the post office to Arbolado ('woodland'), but that was confused by the post office for Alvarado, a street in Monterey. The post office operated at Posts from 1889 to 1910; it was moved in 1905 several miles northwest to Big Sur Village.[33] The English-speaking homesteaders petitioned the United States Post Office in Washington D.C. to change the name of their post office from Arbolado to Big Sur, and the rubber stamp using that name was returned on March 6, 1915, cementing the use of Big Sur as the place name.[19]:\u200a8[20]:\u200a7[34][21]\n\n\n\n## Popularity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Big Sur coast, looking north toward Bixby Creek Bridge\nBig Sur is renowned worldwide for its natural features and relatively pristine scenery. It is rated among the top 35 tourist destinations in the world.[5] The Big Sur coast has been called the \"longest and most scenic stretch of undeveloped coastline in the [contiguous] United States.\"[1] The region has been described as a \"national treasure that demands extraordinary procedures to protect it from development.\"[2] Robert Lindsey wrote in The *New York Times* that it is \"one of the most stunning meetings of land and sea in the world.\"[35] The *Washington Times* stated that it is \"one of the most beautiful coastlines anywhere in the world, an isolated stretch of road, mythic in reputation.\"[3] *Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler* named State Route 1 through Big Sur one of the top 10 world-famous streets, comparable to Broadway in New York City and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris.[36] Realtor Mark Peterson commented, \"Big Sur's popularity has erupted with the growth of social media. It has become a year-round destination.\"[37]\n\n\nWriters have compared Big Sur to other natural wonders like the Grand Canyon.[38] Novelist Herbert Gold described it as \"one of the grand American retreats for those who nourish themselves with wilderness.\"[39]\n\n\n\n\n> Big Sur is the California that men dreamed of years ago, this is the Pacific that Balboa looked at from the Peak of Darien, this is the face of the earth as the Creator intended it to look.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aHenry Miller[12]\n> \n\n\n### Scenic designations[edit]\n\n\nThe section of Highway 1 running through Big Sur is widely considered one of the most scenic driving routes in the United States, if not the world.[40][41][42] The views are one reason that Big Sur was ranked second among all United States destinations in TripAdvisor's 2008 Travelers' Choice Destination Awards.[43] The unblemished natural scenery owes much of its preservation to the highly restrictive development plans enforced in Big Sur; no billboards or advertisements are permitted along the highway and signage for businesses must be modestly scaled and of a rural nature conforming to the Big Sur region. The state of California designated the 72-mile (116\u00a0km) section of the highway from Cambria to Carmel Highlands as the first California Scenic Highway in 1965.[44][45] In 1966, First Lady Lady Bird Johnson led the official scenic road designation ceremony at Bixby Creek Bridge.[46] In 1996, the road became one of the first designated by the federal government as an \"All-American Road\" under the National Scenic Byways Program.[6][47][48][49] CNN Traveler named McWay Falls as the most beautiful place in California.[50]\n\n\n\n### Driving popularity[edit]\n\n\nThe drive along Highway 1 has been described as \"one of the best drives on Earth\", and is considered one of the top 10 motorcycle rides in the United States.[51] Highway 1 was named the most popular drive in California in 2014 by the American Automobile Association.[52] The region receives as many and sometimes more visitors than Yosemite National Park. Unlike the national park managed by a single entity, the Big Sur region is ruled over by multiple government and private land owners, offers only occasional bus service, limited parking, few restrooms, and a single, narrow two-lane highway that for most of its length clings to the steep coastal cliffs. North-bound traffic during the peak summer season and holiday weekends is often backed up for about 20 miles (32\u00a0km) from Big Sur Village to Carmel Highlands. Due to the large number of visitors during the summer, congestion and slow traffic between Carmel and Posts is becoming the norm.[8][7][5][9][6] However, during the winter, the road is frequently closed due to washouts and slides.\n\n\n\n### Protection[edit]\n\n\nDespite its popularity, the region is heavily protected to preserve the rural and natural character of the land. The entire Big Sur coast is located within the protected coastal zone established by the 1976 California Coastal Act. This includes land use within a defined \"coastal zone\" extending inland from 3,000\u00a0ft (910\u00a0m) up to 5\u00a0mi (8.0\u00a0km). The California Coastal Commission has the authority to control the construction of any type, including buildings, housing, roads, as well as fire and erosion abatement structures, and can issue fines for unapproved construction. The Coastal Zone is specifically defined by law as an area that extends from the State's seaward boundary of jurisdiction, and inland for a distance from the Mean High Tide Line of between a couple of hundred feet in urban areas, to up to five miles in rural areas.[53] The Big Sur Local Coastal Plan, approved by the Monterey County Supervisors in 1981, states that the region is meant to be an experience that visitors transit through, not a destination. For that reason, development of all kinds is severely restricted.[54]\n\n\n\n## Attractions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bixby Creek Bridge, shown here looking southwest, is a popular attraction in Big Sur.\n![](image)Bixby Creek Bridge at night\nBesides sightseeing from the highway, Big Sur offers hiking and outdoor activities. There are a large number of state and federal lands and parks, including McWay Falls at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park, one of only two waterfalls in California that plunge directly into the ocean. The waterfall is located near the foundation of a grand stone cliffside house built in 1940 by Lathrop and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Hooper Brown which was the region's first electrified home. However, parking is very limited and usually unavailable on summer weekends and holidays.[55]\n\n\nAnother notable landmark is Point Sur Lightstation, the only complete nineteenth century lighthouse complex open to the public in California.[56]\n\n\nThe Ventana Wildlife Center near Andrew Molera State Park features a free Discovery Center that enables visitors to learn about the California Condor recovery program and other wildlife.[57]\n\n\nThe Henry Miller Memorial Library is a nonprofit bookstore and arts center that opened in 1981 as a tribute to the writer. Miller lived in Big Sur from 1944 to February 1963 and wrote about Big Sur in his book Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch. It is a gathering place for locals and has become the focal point of individuals with a literary mind,[58] a cultural center devoted to Miller's life and work, and a popular attraction for tourists.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Santa Lucia Range from Nepenthe restaurant\n### Camping[edit]\n\n\nThere are both public and private campgrounds along the coast. Kirk Creek, Limekiln, and Plaskett Creek Campgrounds are located very near Highway 1. The public sites accommodate at least one vehicle while Plaskett Creek offers large group camping. The public campgrounds are privately managed and filled months ahead of time.[61] Dispersed camping along local roads or state highways is illegal and violators are regularly cited. Sleeping in cars is illegal and subject to a $1000 fine.[62]\n\n\n\n### Beaches[edit]\n\n\nThere are a few small, scenic beaches that are accessible to the public and popular for walking, but usually unsuitable for swimming, because of unpredictable currents, frigid temperatures, and dangerous surf.[63] The beach at Garrapata State Park is sometimes rated as the best beach in Big Sur. Depending on the season, visitors can view sea otters, sea lions, seals, and migrating whales from the beach. The beach is barely visible from Highway 1.[63]\n\n\nPfeiffer Beach is very popular but is only accessible via the narrow 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) Sycamore Canyon Road. The parking lot at the beach only accommodates 60 vehicles and is usually full on summer and holiday weekends. During the summer, a shuttle operates from the US Forest Service headquarters to the beach. The wide sandy expanse offers views of a scenic arch rock offshore. It is sometimes confused with the beach at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park to the south.[63]\n\n\nIn the south, Sand Dollar Beach is the longest stretch of beach in Big Sur. It is popular with hikers and photographers for its views of nearby bluffs. The beach is 25 miles (40\u00a0km) south of the Big Sur village on Highway 1. A steep staircase leads down to the beach from the highway.[63] Jade Cove, 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) south of Sand Dollar Beach, is also sometimes popular with visitors.\n\n\nSwiss Canyon Beach is a long, sandy beach that's visible when looking north from the mouth of the Big Sur River in Andrew Molera State Park. The eastern side of the beach is bounded by private land. The beach may be accessible from the southern end depending on the tide.[64]\n\n\nSome beaches are surrounded by private land. At the mouth of the Little Sur river are some of the largest dunes on the Big Sur coast. The mouth of the Little Sur River, the dunes, and the mile-long Little Sur River beach are within the boundaries of the El Sur Ranch and are inaccessible to the public. The owner of the ranch maintains a secure fence and has prominently posted \"Private Property\" and \"No Trespassing\" signs on the fence along Highway 1 as suggested by legal precedent.[65] While the beach below the mean high tide line is open to the public, the law does not permit individuals to trespass on private property to reach the public beach. Individuals who trespass to reach the beach have been cited.[66][67]\n\n\nOther beaches that are inaccessible to the public include Point Sur Beach, a long sandy beach located below and to the north of Point Sur Lighthouse.[68] There is a small beach at Rocky Point that is surrounded by private property, making it inaccessible. The beach at the foot of McWay falls is physically inaccessible from the shore. To the south near the county line, Wreck Beach south of Pfeiffer Beach is not accessible. Gamboa Point Beach near the Monterey / San Luis Obispo count line is closed to the public.[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Hiking[edit]\n\n\nThe Pine Ridge Trail (USFS 3E06) is the most popular hiking route into the Ventana Wilderness. Hikers can use it to access many campsites in the backcountry, including Ventana Camp, Terrace Creek, Barlow Flats, Sykes, and Redwood camps. When open, it is accessible from the Big Sur Station. The trail, connecting trails, and the campsites along its route were closed during the Soberanes Fire in July 2016. They were damaged by the fire itself and further damaged by the heavy rains during the following winter. As of August\u00a02017[update], the trail was blocked by four major washouts and more than 100 fallen trees across the path. Reopening the trail will require an environmental assessment, and perhaps re-routing the trail entirely.\n\n\nThe Mt. Manuel Trail (USFS 2E06) begins within Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park. It follows a northeasterly route up the slopes of Mt. Manuel. Hikers following this route can access Vado, Launtz Creek, and Tin House campsites. It connects to the Little Sur trail that provides access to the Little Sur River watershed. The trail is not maintained.[70]\n\n\nThe North Coast Ridge Road (USFS 20S05) is accessible from the road to the Ventana Inn and indirectly from the south via Limekiln State Park. Parking is available in the north at Cadillac Flat near the Ventana Inn. From Ventana Inn, the trail climbs steeply to the crest of the coastal ridge and south about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) to near Cone Peak. There are wide views in all directions for almost the entire hike. It connects to several trails over its length, including Terrace Creek Trail (closed as of January\u00a02018[update]), Boronda Trail, DeAngulo Trail, Big Sur Trail, Marble Peak Trail, Bee Camp Trail, Lost Valley Connector Trail, Rodeo Flat Trail, and the Arroyo Seco Trail. It provides access to Timber Top and Cold Spring Camp. It passes near the summit of Anderson Peak (4,099 feet (1,249\u00a0m)) and Marble Peak (4,031 feet (1,229\u00a0m)), and through to the Nacimiento-Fergusson Road and through connects to the Cone Peak Road. It is not open to vehicular traffic or bicycles. As of January\u00a02018[update], the trail is closed.[71][72]\n\n\nGarrapata State Park, Andrew Molera State Park, Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park, and Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park all contain short hiking trails. As of January\u00a02018[update], almost all trails on the east side of Highway 1 in these parks are closed due to the Soberanes Fire and damage sustained during heavy rains the following winter. Some trails west of Highway 1 are open.[73]\n\n\n\n### Places of contemplation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An evening aerial view of the Esalen Institute\nAmong the places that draw visitors is the formerly counterculture but now upscale Esalen Institute. Esalen hosted many figures of the nascent \"New Age\" and, in the 1960s, played an important role in popularizing Eastern philosophies, the \"Human Potential Movement\", and Gestalt therapy in the United States.[39] Esalen is named after the Native Americans who congregated there at the natural hot springs possibly for thousands of years. Far from the coast within the Los Padres National Forest, the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, accessible via a steep, narrow, 12-mile (19\u00a0km) dirt road, is only open to guests during the summer months.\n\n\nBig Sur is also the location of a Catholic monastery, the New Camaldoli Hermitage. The Hermitage in Big Sur was founded in 1957. It rents a few simple rooms for visitors who would like to engage in silent meditation and contemplation. Normally all retreats are silent and undirected.[74]\n\n\n\n![](image)Historic menu cover from Nepenthe restaurant, a Big Sur icon since 1949[75]\n![](image)McWay Falls and McWay Cove\n### Special events[edit]\n\n\nThe Big Sur International Marathon is an annual marathon that begins south of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park and ends at the Crossroads Shopping Center in Carmel-by-the-Sea. The marathon was established in 1986 and attracts about 4,500 participants annually.[76]\n\n\nCivic leaders in Big Sur stage a run each year in October to raise funds for the Big Sur Volunteer Fire Brigade and the Big Sur Health Center. Since the race, known as the Big Sur River Run, was founded in 1971, more than $1,025,104 has been donated to the two organizations. The run through the redwoods was canceled in 2016 due to the Soberanes Fire and in 2017 due to winter storms.[77][78]\n\n\nThe Big Sur Folk Festival was held from 1964 to 1971. It began unintentionally when Nancy Carlen, a friend of singer Joan Baez, organized a weekend seminar at the Esalen Institute in June 1964 titled \"The New Folk Music\". On Sunday afternoon, they invited all the neighbors for a free, open performance. This became the first festival.[79] The festival was held yearly on the grounds of the Esalen Institute, except for 1970, when it was held at the Monterey County Fairgrounds. Even when well-known acts like Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young or the Beach Boys performed, the event was purposefully kept small with no more than a few thousand in attendance.[80]\n\n\n\n## State and federal lands[edit]\n\n\n### State parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Point Sur and light station from the north\nThe state parks in Big Sur grew out of the original residents' desire to protect and preserve the land they admired. \"The early settlers considered land stewardship their obligation to the community.\"[81] The first was Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park. John Pfeiffer, son of pioneers Michael Pfeiffer and Barbara Laquet, was offered $210,000 for his land near Sycamore Canyon by a Los Angeles developer, who wanted to build a subdivision on the land. Instead, Pfeiffer sold 700 acres (2.8 km2) to the state of California in 1933.[82][83]\n\n\nAs of January\u00a02018[update], portions of most of these parks are closed due to after effects of the Soberanes Fire.[84]\nFrom north to south, the following state parks are in use:[85]\n\n\n\n* Garrapata State Park\n* Point Sur State Historic Park\n* Andrew Molera State Park\n* Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park\n* Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park\n* Limekiln State Park\n\n\n### State reserves[edit]\n\n\n* John Little State Natural Reserve\n* Big Creek State Marine Reserve and Marine Conservation Area\n\n\n### Federal land[edit]\n\n\nAs of January\u00a02018[update], some trails and campsites within the following areas are closed, due to damage caused by the 2016 Soberanes Fire and the following winter's rains.[85]\n\n\n\n* Pfeiffer Beach\n* Los Padres National Forest\n* Ventana Wilderness\n* Silver Peak Wilderness\n\n\n## Overuse issues[edit]\n\n\nDuring most summer weekends and on all major holidays, Big Sur is overwhelmingly crowded.[86] Although some Big Sur residents catered to adventurous travelers in the early twentieth century,[19]:\u200a10 the modern tourist economy began when Highway 1 opened the region to automobiles in 1937, but only took off after World War II-era gasoline rationing and a ban on pleasure driving ended in August 1945.[87] Big Sur has become a destination for travelers both within the United States and internationally.[88][89][90][91]\n\n\n\n### Increasing numbers of visitors[edit]\n\n\nThe number of visitors to Big Sur has risen from about 1.5 million in 1978,[87] to about 3 million in 1980,[92] to an estimated 4 to 5 million during 2014 and 2015, comparable to or greater than the number of visitors to Yosemite National Park.[93] Unlike Yosemite, which is managed by a single federal entity, about one-quarter of the land in Big Sur is privately owned and the remainder is managed by a conglomeration of federal, state, local, and private agencies. Yosemite offers 5,400 parking spots and a free, daily, park-wide bus service. In Big Sur during the summer, there is a single public bus that runs three times daily and a single shuttle van that operates on Thursday through Sunday from the Big Sur Station to Pfeiffer Beach.[94] The owner of the Nepenthe restaurant estimated in 2017 that the number of visitors had increased by 40% since 2011. Big Sur residents and business owners are concerned about the impact visitors are having on the region. Traffic and parking is consistently bad during summer and holidays weekends and some visitors don't obey the laws.[95][96]:\u200a6\n\n\nResidents began discussing the potential necessity of shuttle buses, tollgates along Highway 1, and limits on the number of private autos allowed on the highway in 1978.[87] One of the reasons for Big Sur's popularity is that it is only a one-day drive for about 7 million people. With the advent of social media, hashtags like \"#sykeshotsprings\" and \"#pineridgetrail\", two popular destinations within Big Sur, encourage more visitors.[86][97] Visitors must pay $15 for a parking spot at a trailhead parking lot and take a 14-passenger van to Pfeiffer Beach.[98][99][100][101][96]:\u200a6 In response to visitor abuses, an anonymous Big Sur resident began an Instagram account in May 2019 named BigSurHatesYou intended to shame visitors into treating the Big Sur region better.[102][103]\n\n\nThe television series *Big Little Lies*, which is filmed in the Monterey and Big Sur area, has increased the number of visitors to the area.[104]\n\n\n\n### Restricted public transportation[edit]\n\n\nPublic transportation is available to and from Monterey on Monterey\u2013Salinas Transit. The summer schedule operates from Memorial Day to Labor Day three times a day, while the winter schedule only offers bus service on weekends. The route is subject to interruption due to wind and severe inclement weather.[105]\n\n\n\n### Limited vehicle services[edit]\n\n\nThere are only six gas stations along Highway 1 in Big Sur, from Ragged Point in the south to Carmel Highlands in the north. Three of them are in the north near Big Sur Valley. The gas station at the Big Sur River Inn and Restaurant offers a steep discount to local residents.[106] The filling station in Gorda has one of the highest prices in the United States, as it is far from the electrical grid and part of the cost of auto fuel is used to support the operation of a diesel generator. All of them only operate during regular business hours and none of them supply diesel fuel. There are three Tesla recharging stations near Posts.[107][108][109][110]\n\n\n\n### Lack of restrooms[edit]\n\n\n\n> It's a 'scenic highway' with piles of shit up and down the highway.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aButch Kronlund, Coast Property Owners Association Executive Director\n> \n\n\nThere are only 16 public restrooms along the entire coast to accommodate the almost 5 million annual visitors. The number of visitors far exceeds the available restrooms, and most restrooms are not available in locations where tourists frequently visit.[111][112] Businesses report that the large number of visitors using their bathroom has overwhelmed their septic systems.[111]\n\n\nIf visitors can locate them, they can use bathrooms within California State Parks or federal campgrounds without paying an entrance fee.[113] But many of the bathrooms are not visible from Highway 1. This is due in part to the fact that restroom signs along Highway 1 were removed for aesthetic reasons.[111]\n\n\nAs a result, visitors often resort to defecating in the bushes near locations like the Bixby Creek Bridge.[111][112] Residents complain that visitors regularly defecate along Highway 1. Toilet paper, human waste, and trash litter the roadsides.[111] Residents have taken it upon themselves to clean up after visitors. The California Department of Transportation, which cleans the roadside areas about once a week, finds human waste during every cleanup.[112] Butch Kronlund, executive director of the Coast Property Owners Association, criticized the lack of restrooms. He says, \"It's a 'scenic highway' with piles of shit up and down the highway.\"[95][114]\n\n\nThe 1976 California Coastal Act makes installing public bathrooms, trash bins, or even new road signs along Highway 1 extremely difficult. Several federal, state, and local agencies have jurisdiction in Big Sur, all of which must weigh in on decisions affecting residents and visitors.[115]\n\n\n\n### Few visitors' services[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Deetjen's Big Sur Inn is listed on the National Register of Historic Places[116]\nThe land use restrictions that preserve Big Sur's natural beauty also mean that visitor accommodations are limited, often expensive, and places to stay fill up quickly during the busy summer season.\n\n\nThere are no urban areas, just three small clusters of restaurants, gas stations, motels, and camp grounds: Posts in the Big Sur River valley, Lucia, near Limekiln State Park, and Gorda, on the southern coast. Scattered among these distant settlements are nine small grocery stores, a few gift shops, and no chain hotels, supermarkets, or fast-food outlets, and no plans to add facilities or shopping.[117][118][119] Among the places to stay and eat are the luxury Ventana Inn, Post Ranch, and the Nepenthe restaurant, built around the cabin Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth impulsively bought.\n\n\n\n### Limited accommodations[edit]\n\n\n![A cabin is built attached to four trees about 10 feet above grade. An elevated walkway is connected to the cabin's entrance.](image)One of the accommodations at the Treebones campsite and resort in Big Sur\nThere are fewer than 300 hotel rooms on the entire 90-mile (140\u00a0km) stretch of Highway 1 between San Simeon and Carmel. Lodging include a few cabins, motels, and campgrounds, and higher-end resorts such as the Post Ranch Inn, charging as much as $1,800, and the Ventana Inn, with suites up to $2,400 per night.[120][121] There are some short-term rentals, but their legality is still being determined.[122]\n\n\n\n### Illegal camping[edit]\n\n\nSome social media sites report the availability of free camping on the side of roads, but camping of any sort or parking overnight along highways and local roads is illegal and violators are regularly cited. Sleeping in cars is illegal and subject to a $1000 fine.[62] Casual campers have at times turned every wide spot along the Nacimiento-Fergusson Road into an illegal campsite, although there are no bathrooms or fire pits. Residents complain about illegal camp fires and people defecating along the road without using proper sanitation.[98] Camping is only permitted within designated private and state or federal park campsites or within USFS lands.[123][124]\n\n\nOn July 22, 2016, an illegal campfire within Garrapata State Park, where camping is not permitted, got out of control. The resulting Soberanes Fire burned 132,127 acres (53,470\u00a0ha), 57 homes and 11 outbuildings, and killed a bulldozer operator. It took almost three months to extinguish and cost about $236\u00a0million to suppress.[125] In October, 2017, a visitor from Florida was arrested for starting an illegal campfire that grew out of control.[126]\n\n\n\n### Solutions under consideration[edit]\n\n\nThe Community Association of Big Sur (formerly the Big Sur Property Owners Association) is proposing some solutions. They want to close the parking lot at Bixby Creek for a year to encourage visitors to take public transportation. They are considering asking community volunteers to keep tourists from walking onto the bridge, which is both dangerous and illegal. Tourists who want to get to Pfeiffer Beach over the current mile-long, one-lane road to a small 65-car parking lot would be required to reserve and pay for parking ahead of time or take a shuttle. Parking on the highway shoulder at popular McWay Falls to avoid a $10 parking lot fee would be prohibited. Another idea under consideration is a ban on dispersed camping in the national forest during fire season \"until proper backcountry monitoring and enforcement exists.\" An illegal campfire in 2017 burned 57 homes and killed one firefighter. The Forest Service used to have several backcountry rangers but now has none.[115]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nThe arrival of Bay Area artists in Carmel-by-the-Sea beginning in 1904 was the beginning of a literary and artistic colony on the northern edge of Big Sur. Robinson Jeffers moved to Carmel in September 1914, and over his lifetime wrote many evocative poems about the isolation and natural beauty of Big Sur. Beginning in the 1920s, his poetry introduced the romantic idea of Big Sur's wild, untamed spaces to a national audience, which encouraged many of the later visitors.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Henry Miller Memorial Library. Author Henry Miller lived in Big Sur from 1944 to 1962.\nHenry Miller moved to Big Sur at the invitation of the Greco-French artist Jean Varda, uncle of filmmaker Agn\u00e8s Varda. He lived in Big Sur for almost 20 years, from 1944 to 1962. When he first arrived, he was broke and novelist Lynda Sargent was renting a cabin from a local riding club. She allowed Miller to live rent-free for a while. But when the cabin was sold to Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth in 1945, Miller moved several miles south to a wood cabin on Partington Ridge that had been owned by his friend Emil White.[127]\n\n\nWhile in Big Sur, Miller, avant-garde musician Harry Partch and Jean Varda were part of a local group of bohemians known as the Anderson Creek Gang, many of whom lived at the former highway work camp near the mouth of Anderson Creek. Miller lived in a shack there during 1946 before moving back to the cabin on Partington Ridge in 1947. In his 1957 essay/memoir/novel *Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch*, Miller described the joys and hardships that came from escaping the \"air-conditioned nightmare\" of modern life.[128]\n\n\n\n### Bohemian reputation[edit]\n\n\nHunter S. Thompson worked as a security guard and caretaker at a resort in Big Sur Hot Springs for eight months in 1961, just before the Esalen Institute was founded at that location. While there, he published his first feature story in the nationally distributed men's magazine *Rogue* about Big Sur's artisan and bohemian culture.[129][130] In the article, he described how the Bohemian image attracted people who annoyed residents:\n\n\n\n\n> Every weekend Dick Hartford, owner of the local Village Store, is plagued by people looking for \"sex orgies,\" \"wild drinking brawls,\" or \"the road to Henry Miller's house\" as if once they found Miller everything else would be taken care of ...\n> \n> \n> Time was when this place was as lonely and isolated as any spot in America. But no longer; inevitably, Big Sur has been \"discovered.\" *Life* called it a \"Rugged, Romantic World Apart,\" and presented nine pages of pictures to prove it. After that, there was no hope ...\n> \n> \n> \n> And on some weekends, it seems like all seven million of them are right here, bubbling over with questions: \"Where's the art colony man? I've come all the way from Tennessee to join it.\" \"Say, fella, where do I find this nudist colony?\"... Or the one that drove Miller half-crazy: \"Ah-ha! So you're Henry Miller! Well my name is Claude Fink and I've come to join the cult of sex and anarchy.\"[131]\n> \n> \n\n\nOther writers and artists were also attracted by Big Sur, including Edward Weston, Richard Brautigan, Emile Norman and Jack Kerouac.[132] Big Sur acquired a bohemian reputation with these newcomers. Kerouac followed Miller to Big Sur and included the rugged coast in large parts of two of his novels. He spent a few days in early 1960 at fellow poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti's cabin in Bixby Canyon and based his novel *Big Sur* on his time there.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:People from Big Sur, California\n\nWell-known individuals have called Big Sur home, including:\n\n\n\n* Jos\u00e9 Abrego merchant, politician\n* Ansel Adams photographer / musician\n* Juan Bautista Alvarado politician\n* Morley Baer photographer\n* Jos\u00e9 Castro politician, statesman, and military officer\n* John B.

At the turn of the 19th century, the 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) trip from Monterey to the Pfeiffer Ranch in the Big Sur valley could take three days by wagon. It was a rough road that ended in present-day Big Sur Village and could be impassible in winter.[133] There was no road beyond the Pfeiffer Ranch, only a horseback trail connecting the homesteads to the south. The ride from Pfeiffer Ranch to San Carp\u00f3foro canyon was about 60 miles (97\u00a0km) in a direct line, but about three times that by horseback. J. Smeaton Chase, who traveled on horseback up the coast in 1911, reported that a stagecoach carried passengers from Posts (then named Arbolado) to the Everett Hotel in Monterey on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.[134]\n\n\nThe highway was first proposed by Dr. John L.\u00a0D. Roberts, a physician who was summoned on April 21, 1894, to treat survivors of the wreck of the 493 tons (447\u00a0t; 440 long tons) S.S. *Los Angeles* (originally USRC *Wayanda*), which had run aground near the Point Sur Light Station about 25 miles (40\u00a0km) south of Carmel-by-the-Sea. The ride on his two-wheeled, horse-drawn cart took him 3+1\u20442 hours, a very fast trip for the day. Construction began in 1921, ceased for two years in 1926 when funding ran out, and after 18 years of construction, the Carmel\u2013San Simeon Highway was completed in 1937. The route was incorporated into the state highway system and re-designated as Highway 1 in 1939.\n\n\nThe highway is a dominant feature of the Big Sur coast, providing the primary means of access and transportation. The Big Sur portion of Highway 1 is generally considered to include the 71-mile (114\u00a0km) segment adjoining the unincorporated region of Big Sur between Malpaso Creek near Carmel Highlands[11] in the north and San Carp\u00f3foro Creek near San Simeon in the south.[12]\n\n\nAlong with the ocean views, this winding, narrow road, often cut into the face of seaside cliffs, dominates the visitor's experience of Big Sur.[135] The views, redwood forests, hiking, beaches, and other recreational opportunities have made Big Sur a destination for about 4.5 to 7 million people who live within a day's drive and for visitors from elsewhere in the world. [136]\n\n\nThe highway has been closed more than 55 times by landslides, and in May 2017, a 2,000,000-cubic-foot (57,000\u00a0m3) slide blocked the highway at Mud Creek, north of Salmon Creek near the San Luis Obispo County line, to just south of Gorda. The road was reopened on July 18, 2018, but is subject to closure during heavy storms.\n\n\n\n## Big Sur land use[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Big Sur land use\n\nThe policies protecting land used in Big Sur are some of the most restrictive local-use standards in California,[15] and are widely regarded as one of the most restrictive development protections anywhere.[16] The program protects viewsheds from the highway and many vantage points and severely restricts the density of development. About 60% of the coastal region is owned by governmental or private agencies which do not allow any development. The majority of the interior region is part of the Los Padres National Forest, Ventana Wilderness, Silver Peak Wilderness, or Fort Hunter Liggett. The area is protected by the Big Sur Local Coastal Plan, which preserves it as \"open space, a small residential community, and agricultural ranching.\"[14] Its intention is \"preserving the environment and visual access to it, the policies of the local coastal plan are to minimize, or limit, all destination activities.\"[137]\n\n\nThe unincorporated region encompassing Big Sur does not have specific boundaries, but is generally considered to include the 71-mile (114\u00a0km) segment of California State Route 1 between Malpaso Creek near Carmel Highlands[11] in the north and San Carp\u00f3foro Creek near San Simeon in the south,[12] as well as the entire Santa Lucia range between these creeks.[10] The interior region is mostly uninhabited, while the coast remains relatively isolated and sparsely populated, with between 1,800 and 2,000 year-round residents[13] and relatively few visitor accommodations scattered among the four small settlements.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Native Americans[edit]\n\n\nThree tribes of Native Americans\u00a0\u2014 the Ohlone, Esselen, and Salinan\u00a0\u2014 are the first known people to have inhabited the area. The Ohlone, also known as the Costanoans, is believed to have lived in the region from San Francisco to Point Sur. The Esselen lived in the area between Point Sur south to Big Creek and inland including the upper tributaries of the Carmel River and Arroyo Seco watersheds. The Salinan lived from Big Creek south to San Carp\u00f3foro Creek.[138]\n\n\nArchaeological evidence shows that the Esselen lived in Big Sur as early as 3500 BC, leading a nomadic, hunter-gatherer existence.[139][46] The aboriginal people inhabited fixed village locations, and followed food sources seasonally, living near the coast in winter to harvest rich stocks of otter, mussels, abalone, and other sea life. In the summer and fall, they traveled inland to gather acorns and hunt deer.[140] Middens attributed to the Essleen have been found as far south as Slates Hot Springs.\n\n\nThe native people hollowed mortar holes into large exposed rocks or boulders which they used to grind the acorns into flour. These can be found throughout the region. Arrows were made of cane and pointed with hardwood foreshafts.[140] The tribes also used controlled burning techniques to increase tree growth and food production.[10]:\u200a269\u2013270 The population was limited as the Santa Lucia Mountains made the area relatively inaccessible and long-term habitation a challenge. The population of the Esselen who lived in the Big Sur area are estimated from a few hundred to a thousand or more.[141][142]\n\n\nThe Salinan people are believed to have lived south of Junipero Serra Peak, perhaps ranging from Slates Hot Springs on the coast to Soledad in the Salinas Valley and into northern San Luis Obispo County. When European settlers arrived on the southern Big Sur coast in the 1860s, they found some native people living on Mill Creek south of the present-day Nacimiento-Fergusson Road. Mabel Plaskett, whose family homesteaded along the coast in September, 1869, wrote about two families who lived along the creek. Gabriel Fontes lived in a cave high up on the north slope of Mill Creek. He had two daughters, Alberta and Antonia. Alberta became a governess for a wealthy family and traveled to Europe several times. As of 1959[update], Tony lived in Jackson, California with family.[143][144]\n\n\nAnother native family was Cayatan and Lucia Canieti. She was the daughter of Antonio Gomez. They had two daughters, Hattie and Regina. They attended the Mansfield School in Manchester with the settlers' children.[144] Mortar holes attributed to the tribe are found at Wagon Caves northwest of Jolon, California.[143][145] Pre-contact population estimates range from 3,000 to 700.\n\n\n\n### Spanish exploration and settlement[edit]\n\n\nThe first Europeans to see Big Sur were Spanish mariners led by Juan Cabrillo in 1542, who sailed up the coast without landing. When Cabrillo sailed by, he described the coastal range as \"mountains which seem to reach the heavens, and the sea beats on them; sailing along close to land, it appears as though they would fall on the ships.\"[10]:\u200a272\n\n\nTwo centuries passed before the Spaniards attempted to colonize the area. On September 13, 1769, an expedition led by Gaspar de Portol\u00e1 were the first Europeans to enter the Big Sur region when they arrived at San Carp\u00f3foro Canyon near Ragged Point.[10]:\u200a272 While camping there, they were visited by six indigenous people who offered pinole and fish and received beads in exchange. They explored the coast ahead and concluded it was impassable. They were forced to turn inland up the steep arroyo. The march through the mountains was one of the most difficult portions of the expedition's journey. The Spanish were forced to \"make a road with crowbar and pickaxe\". Crespi wrote, \"The mountains which enclose it are perilously steep, and all are inaccessible, not only for men but also for goats and deer.\" From a high peak near the San Antonio River, they could see nothing but mountains in every direction.[28]:\u200a190 They reached Monterey on October 1. [12] [146][147] When they attempted to explore further south, the scouts found their way blocked by \"the same cliff that had forced us back from the shore and obliged us to travel through the mountains.\"[28]:\u200a205\n\n\nAfter the Spanish established the California missions in 1770, they baptized and forced the native population to labor at the missions. While living at the missions, the aboriginal population was exposed to diseases unknown to them, like smallpox and measles, for which they had no immunity, devastating the Native American population and their culture. Many of the remaining Native Americans assimilated with Spanish and Mexican ranchers in the nineteenth century.[10]:\u200a264\u2013267\n\n\nIn 1909, forest supervisors reported that three Indian families still lived within what was then known as the Monterey National Forest. The Encinale family of 16 members and the Quintana family with three members lived in the vicinity of The Indians (now known as Santa Lucia Memorial Park west of Ft. Hunger Liggett). The Mora family consisting of three members was living to the south along the Nacimiento-Ferguson Road.[148]\n\n\n\n### Spanish ranchos[edit]\n\n\nAlong with the rest of Alta California, Big Sur became part of Mexico when it gained independence from Spain in 1821. But, due to its inaccessibility, only a few small portions of the Big Sur region were included in land grants given by Mexican governors Jos\u00e9 Figueroa and Juan Bautista Alvarado.[96]:\u200a8\n\n\n\nRancho Tularcitos\nMain article: Rancho Tularcitos (Gom\u00e9z)\n\nRancho Tularcitos, 26,581-acre (10,757\u00a0ha) of land, was granted in 1834 by Governor Jos\u00e9 Figueroa to Rafael Gom\u00e9z.[149] It was located in upper Carmel Valley along Tularcitos Creek.[150]\n\n\n\nRancho San Francisquito\nMain article: Rancho San Francisquito (Munr\u00e1s)\n\nRancho San Francisquito was a 8,813-acre (35.66\u00a0km2) land grant given in 1835 by Governor Jos\u00e9 Castro to Catalina Manzanelli de Munr\u00e1s. She was the wife of Esteban Munr\u00e1s (1798\u20131850), a Monterey trader, amateur painter, and grantee of Rancho San Vicente.[151] The grant was located in the upper Carmel Valley, inland and east of Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito.[152]\n\n\n\nRancho Milpitas\nMain article: Rancho Milpitas (Pastor)\n\nRancho Milpitas was a 43,281-acre (17,515\u00a0ha) land grant given in 1838 by governor Juan Alvarado to Ygnacio Pastor.[151] The grant encompassed present-day Jolon and land to the west.[153] When Pastor obtained title from the Public Land Commission in 1875, Faxon Atherton immediately purchased the land. By 1880, the James Brown Cattle Company owned and operated Rancho Milpitas and neighboring Rancho Los Ojitos. William Randolph Hearst's Piedmont Land and Cattle Company acquired the rancho in 1925.[154] In 1940, in anticipation of the increased forces required in World War II, the U.S. War Department purchased the land from Hearst to create a troop training facility known as the Hunter Liggett Military Reservation.[155]\n\n\n\nRancho El Sur\nMain article: Rancho El Sur\n\nOn July 30, 1834, Figueroa granted Rancho El Sur, two square leagues of land totalling 8,949-acres (3,622\u00a0ha), to Juan Bautista Alvarado.[156]:\u200a21[157] The grant extended from the Little Sur River to what is now known as Cooper Point.[158][159] Alvarado later traded Rancho El Sur for the more accessible Rancho Bolsa del Potrero y Moro Cojo in the northern Salinas Valley, owned by his uncle by marriage, Captain John B. R. Cooper.[160] About one-half of Rancho El Sur is still an operating cattle ranch.\n\n\n\nRancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito\nMain article: Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito\n\nIn 1839, Alvarado granted Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito, also about two square leagues of land totalling 8,876-acre (3,592\u00a0ha), to Marcelino Escobar, a prominent official of Monterey.[161] The grant was bounded on the north by the Carmel River and on the south by Palo Colorado Canyon.[162]\n\n\nIn 1848, two days after the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill, Mexico ceded California to the United States as a result of the Mexican\u2013American War.\n\n\n\n### First survey[edit]\n\n\nDuring the first survey of the coast conducted by the U.S. Coast Survey in 1886, the surveyor reported:\n\n\n\n\n> The country between the shoreline and the Coast Range of mountains, running parallel with the shoreline from San Carpojoro to Point Sur is probably the roughest piece of coastline on the whole Pacific coast of the United States from San Diego to Cape Flattery.\n> \n> \n> The highest peaks of the crest of the coast range are located at an average distance from the coast of three and a half miles [5.6\u00a0km]. In this distance they rise to elevations of from three thousand six hundred to five thousand feet [1,100 to 1,500\u00a0m] above the sea-level. From San Carpoforo Creek to Pfeiffer's Point, a distance of 54 miles (87\u00a0km), the shore-line is iron-bound coast with no possible chance of getting from the hills to the shore-line and back except at the mouths of the creeks and at such places as Coxe's Hole and Slate's Hot Springs, where there are short stretches of sandy and rocky beaches from fifty to one hundred yards [meters] in length. In many places the sea bluffs are perpendicular, and rise from one thousand to one thousand five hundred feet [300 to 460\u00a0m] above the sea. The country is cut up by deep ca\u00f1ons [canyons], walled in with high and precipitous bluffs. These ca\u00f1ons are densely wooded with redwood, oak, and yellow and silver pine timber.\n> \n> \n> \n> The redwood trees are from three to six feet [0.91 to 1.83\u00a0m] in diameter and from one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet high [30 to 46\u00a0m]. The oaks and pines are of the same average dimensions. Beautiful streams of clear cold water, filled with an abundance of salmon or trout, are to be found in all the canyons. The spurs running from the summits of the range to the ocean bluffs are covered with a dense growth of brush and scattering clumps of oak and pine timber. The chaparral is very thick, and in many places grows to a height of ten or fifteen feet [3\u20135 m]\u00a0... The spurs, slopes, and canons are impenetrable\u00a0...[163][164]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Homesteaders[edit]\n\n\nThe first known European settler in Big Sur was John Davis who in 1853 built a cabin near the present-day site of the Mount Manuel Trail trailhead.[10]:\u200a326 In 1868, Native Americans Manual and Florence Innocenti bought Davis' cabin and land for $50.\n\n\nJohn Bautista Rogers Cooper, born John Rogers Cooper, was a Yankee from the British Channel Islands who arrived in Monterey in 1823.[165] He became a Mexican citizen, converted to Catholicism, and was given a Spanish name at his baptism. He married Native American Encarnacion Vallejo and acquired considerable land, including Rancho El Sur, on which he had a cabin built in April or May 1861.[166] The Cooper Cabin is the oldest surviving structure in Big Sur.[167]\n\n\n\n![](image)Joseph W. Post House, a historic structure built in 1867\u20131877.\nWilliam B. Post arrived in California in 1848 and was the foreman of the Soberanes Ranch when he built a single-room cabin in 1867. His son added to it in 1877, when the family moved there full-time. The Post House is a historic landmark and is on the grounds of the Ventana Inn resort.\n\n\nMichael Pfeiffer, his wife, and four children arrived in Big Sur in 1869 to settle on the south coast. After reaching Sycamore Canyon, they found it to their liking and decided to stay.[10]:\u200a326 He filed a land patent on January 20, 1883, claiming two sections of land he already resided on near and immediately north of the mouth of Sycamore Canyon.[168] They had six more children later on.\n\n\nAnother important pioneer-era historic resource is the Swetnam / Trotter House, a late 19th-century dwelling located at the mouth of Palo Colorado Canyon.\n\n\n\n![A shingled log cabin alongside a split rail fence is the oldest structure on the Big Sur coast.](image)The Cooper Cabin is the oldest structure on the Big Sur coast, built in 1861 for Captain J.B.R. Cooper\nAfter the passage of the federal Homestead Act in 1862, a few hardy settlers were drawn by the promise of free 160-acre (65\u00a0 ha) parcels. After the claimant filed for the land, they had gained full ownership after five years of residence or by paying $1.50 per acre within six months.[169] Each claim was for 160 acres, a quarter section of free government land.[148]\n\n\nOther settlers included William F. Notley, who homesteaded at the mouth of Palo Colorado Canyon in 1891. He began harvesting tanoak bark from the canyon, a lucrative source of income at the time. Notley's Landing is named after him. Isaac Swetnam worked for Notley and built a house at the mouth of Palo Colorado Canyon, which as of 2018[update] is still a residence. Sam Trotter, who also worked for Notley, later bought Swetnam's house. He married Adelaide Pfeiffer, the daughter of Micheal Pfeiffer, and they raised a family there from 1906 to 1923.\n\n\nWilliam and Sarah (Barnes) Plaskett and their family settled in Pacific Valley in 1869. They built several homes and a saw mill.[170]:\u200a38 Homesteader John Junge built a one-room redwood cabin in 1920.[171] The John Little State Natural Reserve straddling the mouth of Lime Creek preserves the original 1917 cabin of conservationist Elizabeth K. Livermore.[172]\n\n\nMany other local sites retain names from settlers during this period: Bottcher, Cooper's Point, Gamboa, Anderson, Partington, Dani, Harlans, McQuades, Ross, and McWay are a few of the place names.[171] Wilber Harlan, a native of Indiana, homesteaded near Lucia in 1885. His family descendants are as of 2017[update] still operating the Lucia Lodge.[171][173]\n\n\n\n### Industrial era and gold rush[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A major forest product of the Big Sur coast was the bark of Tanbark Oak\n![](image)Bixby Landing in 1911 was used to transport products to and from ships offshore\nThe local industries provided more work and supported a larger population than it does today. Jobs included harvesting lumber and tanoak bark, gold mining, and limestone processing.\n\n\nFrom the 1860s through the start of the twentieth century, lumbermen cut down most of the readily accessible coast redwoods. Redwood harvesting further inland was always limited by the rugged terrain and difficulty in transporting the lumber to market. Redwood was cut in large amounts for use onsite in limestone kilns. Two companies operated large-scale limestone extraction and processing. The Monterey Lime Company operated near Long Ridge, east of Bixby Creek, and the Rockland Lime and Lumber Company operated a kiln at what later became known Limekiln Creek in the south.[174]\n\n\nWilliam F. Notley was one of the first to harvest the bark of the Tanbark Oak from the Little Sur River canyon.[175] Tanbark was used to manufacture tannic acid, necessary to the growing leather tanning industry located in Santa Cruz, and to preserve fish nets.[176] The tanbark was harvested from the isolated trees inland, left to dry, corded, and brought out on mules or hauled out on \"go-devils\". The go-devil was a wagon with two wheels on the front, while the rear had rails for pulling. A point on the Palo Colorado road is still nicknamed \"The Hoist\" because of the very steep road which required wagon-loads of tanbark and lumber to be hoisted by block and tackle hitched to oxen.[177] The old block and tackle on a beam is still mounted between mailboxes.[178]\n\n\nThe 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) trip from Monterey to the Pfeiffer Ranch usually took all day by wagon. If the road was in bad shape, the stage driver only took a lightweight spring wagon. The rough road ended at the Pfeiffer Resort on the Big Sur River. It could be impassible in winter. Notley constructed a dog-hole port at the mouth of the Palo Colorado River, and a small village grew up from 1898 to 1907 around at what is known today as Notley's Landing.[179][180] Bixby built a sawmill on his property, and to get the lumber and lime to market, built a similar doghole port at the mouth of what was then known as Mill's Creek, today as Bixby Creek.[174] The tanbark was loaded by cable and a chute onto waiting vessels anchored offshore. In 1889, as much as 50,000 cords of tanbark were hauled out from the Little Sur River and Big Sur River watersheds.[10]:\u200a330 A cable hoist and chute were used to move goods to and from schooners anchored just offshore.[133]Near the start of the 20th century, the tan oak trees were becoming seriously depleted, which slowly led to the demise of the industries they had created.[175] Only the foundations of the doghole ports remain today.[95]\n\n\nIn the 1880s, gold was found in the Los Burros District at Alder Creek in the mountains east of present-day Gorda. The gold rush town of Manchester at 35\u00b052\u203248\u2033N 121\u00b023\u203231\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff35.880\u00b0N 121.392\u00b0W\ufeff / 35.880; -121.392 existed for a few short years.[181][182][183] The town boasted a population of 200, four stores, a restaurant, five saloons, a dance hall, and a hotel, but it was abandoned soon after the start of the twentieth century and burned to the ground in 1909.[19][184] Miners extracted about $150,000 in gold (about $5.49\u00a0million in 2023) during the mine's existence.[170]:\u200a30\n\n\nResidents also received supplies by steamship that would make a trip once a year in the fall from San Francisco to Big Sur to drop off supplies that could not be transported by wagon.[95] In 1894, ranch owners Post, Pfeiffer, and Castro hired the Pacific Coast Steamship Company's 180 feet (55\u00a0m) steamer *Bonita* to bring lumber and seed oats to the mouth of the Big Sur River and Big Creek, north of Lucia.[185] Lightering was used to transport freight to and from the beach. A large crowd gathered to receive supplies from and to load butter, honey, beans, wool, hides, and other products onto the ship.[186]\n\n\nIn the late 1800s, the Ventana Power Company operated a sawmill near present-day Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park. They began planning to build a dam on the Big Sur River just downstream of the confluence of Ventana Creek and the Big Sur River. They hoped to sell the electricity to the City of Monterey. They built a diversion channel along the Big Sur River, but the 1906 San Francisco earthquake bankrupted the company and they abandoned the project. The stonework from the diversion channel is still visible.[187] Few other signs of this brief industrial period are visible. The rugged, isolated terrain kept out all but the sturdiest and most self-sufficient settlers. Travelers who ventured south of the Post Ranch rode horseback along trails that connected the various homesteaders along the coast.[46]\n\n\nThe 1900 Monterey County voting register indicates 61 male voters in the Big Sur area. The majority (47) were either farmers or ranchers. Other trades included a gardener, apiarist, fruit grower, woodsman, laborer, lighthouse keeper, blacksmith, surveyor, miner, and teamster. Lumber-related occupations include bark peelers, woodchoppers, and wood overseers.[174]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Santa Lucia Range\n\nThe Santa Lucia Mountain Range, which dominates the Big Sur region, is 140 miles (230\u00a0km) long, extending from Carmel in the north to the Cuyama River in San Luis Obispo County. The range is never more than 11 miles (18\u00a0km) from the coast.[20]:\u200a11\n\n\nThe Santa Lucia Mountains are characterized by extremely steep slopes, all associated with watersheds flowing directly or indirectly into the Pacific Ocean. The range forms the steepest coastal slope in the contiguous United States.[20]:\u200a12 The mountains are of recent tectonic origin, and its rugged, steep, and dissected deep stream canyons. The general trend of the range is northwest-southeast, paralleling the numerous faults that transect the area.[188]\n\n\nThe topography is complex, however, reflecting active uplift and deformation, a variety of lithological types, rapidly incising stream networks, and highly unstable slopes. Stream channels and hill slopes are very steep, with average hill slope gradients exceeding 60% in some interior watersheds. The coastal side of the range rises directly from the shoreline, with oceanfront ridges rising directly 4,000 to 5,000 feet (1,200 to 1,500\u00a0m) to the crest of the coastal range. Big Sur's Cone Peak, at an elevation of 5,155 feet (1,571\u00a0m), is only 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) from the ocean and is the tallest coastal mountain in the contiguous United States.[189][10]\n\n\nThe basement rocks of the Santa Lucia Range contain Mesozoic Franciscan and Salinian Block rocks.[188] The Franciscan complex is composed of greywacke sandstone and greenstone, with serpentinite bodies and other Ultramafic rocks present. Small areas of marble and limestone lenses form resistant outcrops that are prominent landscape features, often white to light gray. The Salinian block is made up of highly fractured, and deeply weathered meta-sediments, especially biotite schist and gneiss, intruded by plutonic (granitic) rocks such as quartz diorite and granodiorite. Both formations have been disrupted and tectonically slivered by motion on the San Andreas and associated fault systems. The Palo Colorado and Church Creek faults are prominent features influencing the linear northwest-southeast alignment of primary drainages.[188]\n\n\n\n### Marine influence[edit]\n\n\nAlong with much of the central and northern California coast, Big Sur frequently has dense fog in summer. Fog and lack of precipitation during the summer both result from the North Pacific High's presence offshore during that season. The high-pressure cell inhibits rainfall and generates northwesterly airflow. These prevailing summer winds from the northwest drive the ocean surface water slightly offshore (through the Ekman effect) which generates an upwelling of colder subsurface water. Warm surface air blowing over cold upwelling ocean water close to the coast is cooled to create a surface-based inversion.[10]:\u200a33\u201335 Summer fog is common below about 2,000 feet (610\u00a0m) elevation. During 2014 and 2015, researchers recorded summer seasonal totals of 125 centimetres (49\u00a0in) and 31 centimetres (12\u00a0in) of fog water drip under open shrub canopies. They concluded that precipitation from fog dripping into the soils under coastal shrub canopies can be as much as 50% of annual average rainfall rates.[190] The fog usually moves out to sea during the day and closes in at night, but sometimes heavy fog blankets the coast all day.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Wildfires[edit]\n\n\n### Historic fires[edit]\n\n\nFire plays a key role in the ecology of the upper slopes of the Big Sur region's mountains where chaparral dominates the landscape.[191] It is known that Native Americans burned chaparral to increase food production and promote grasslands for textiles, but little is known about the natural frequency of fire in the Santa Lucia Mountains.[10]:\u200a269\u2013270[192] A study of fire scars on sugar pines on Junipero Serra Peak found that at least six fires had burned the region between 1790 and 1901.[193] During the Spanish and Mexican era the Native Americans set fires regularly in coastal and valley grasslands to control brush growth and reduce fire risk.[193] The European homesteaders followed that tradition and set controlled burns every winter when conditions were right.[194]\n\n\n\n![](image)FEMA team assesses wildfire damage after the Basin Fire, 2008\nFollowing the depopulation of the Native Americans from the region in the late 1800s, there have been several very large fires in the Big Sur area. In 1894, a fire burned for weeks through the upper watersheds of all of the major streams in the Big Sur region. Another large fire in 1898 burned without any effort by the few residents to put it out, except to save their buildings.[195] In 1903, a fire started by an untended campfire near Chews Ridge burned a path 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) wide to the coast over three months. In 1906, a fire that began in Palo Colorado Canyon from the embers of a campfire burned 150,000 acres (61,000\u00a0ha) over 35 days and was finally extinguished by the first rainfall of the season.[196] The number of fires declined when the U.S. Forest Service began managing the land in 1907.[193]\n\n\n\n### Modern wildfires[edit]\n\n\nIn recent history, the area was struck by the Molera Fire in 1972, which resulted in flooding and mud flows in the Big Sur River valley that buried portions of several buildings the following winter.[197] The area was burned by Marble Cone Fire in 1977, the Rat Creek Gorda Complex Fire in 1985, the Kirk Complex Fire in 1999, the Basin Complex Fire in 2008, the Pfeiffer Fire in December 2013, and the Soberanes Fire in 2016.[198]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 2016 Soberanes fire tops a ridge covered in fire retardant adjacent to the Pacific Ocean\nThe Basin Complex Fire forced an eight-day evacuation of Big Sur and the closure of Highway 1, beginning just before the July 4, 2008 holiday weekend.[199] The fire, which burned over 130,000 acres (53,000\u00a0ha), represented the largest of many lightning-caused wildfires that had broken out throughout California during the same period.[200] Although the fire caused no loss of life, it destroyed 27 homes, and the tourist-dependent economy lost about a third of its expected summer revenue.[201][202] The Pfeiffer Fire from December 17 to 20, 2013 burned 917 acres (371\u00a0ha)and destroyed 34 homes in an area near Pfeiffer Ridge Road and Sycamore Canyon Road.[203]\n\n\nThe July 2016 Soberanes Fire was caused by unknown individuals who started and lost control of an illegal campfire in the Garrapata Creek watershed. After it burned 57 homes in the Garrapata and Palo Colorado Canyon areas, firefighters were able to build lines around parts of the Big Sur community. A bulldozer operator was killed when his equipment overturned during night operations in Palo Colorado Canyon.\n\n\nCoast residents east of Highway 1 were required to evacuate for short periods, and Highway 1 was shut down at intervals over several days to allow firefighters to conduct backfire operations. Visitors avoided the area and tourism revenue was impacted for several weeks.[204]\n\n\nIn April, 2022, Ivan Gomez was convicted of 16 felony counts including arson for purposefully starting a fire near Lime Creek on August 18, 2020. The Dolan Fire killed a dozen Critically Endangered California Condors when it burned through the 80 acres (32\u00a0ha) Big Sur Condor Sanctuary operated by the Ventana Wildlife Society of Monterey. The 125,000 acres (51,000\u00a0ha) fire was not fully contained until December 31, more than four months after it started.[205]\n\n\n\n### Effect on Redwoods[edit]\n\n\nIn the lower elevations and canyons, the California Redwood is often found. Its thick bark, along with foliage that starts high above the ground, protect the species from both fire and insect damage, contributing to the coast redwood's longevity.[206] Fire appears to benefit redwoods by removing competitive species. A 2010 study compared post-wildfire survival and regeneration of redwood and associated species. It concluded that fires of all severity increase the relative abundance of redwood and higher-severity fires provide the greatest benefit.[207]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Upper image from March and lower image from October, showing a typical fog bank nearly 1,000\u00a0feet\u00a0(300\u00a0m) thick. Also illustrating the difference in vegetation between the winter rainy season and dry early fall.\nBig Sur typically enjoys a mild Mediterranean climate, with a sunny, dry summer and fall, and cool, wet winter. Coastal temperatures range from the 50s at night to the 70s by day (Fahrenheit) from June through October, and in the 40s to 60s from November through May. Further inland, away from the ocean's moderating influence, temperatures are much more variable. The weather varies widely due to the influence of the jagged topography, creating many microclimates.\n\n\n\n![](image)Big Sur Coast in April 1969 after a wet winter\nThe record maximum temperature was 111\u00a0\u00b0F (43.9\u00a0\u00b0C) on September 7, 2020, and the record low was 26\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22123.3\u00a0\u00b0C), recorded on February 9, 2009.\n\n\nDuring the winter, Big Sur experiences some of the heaviest rainfall in California.[208] More than 70 percent of the rain falls from December through March. The summer is generally dry. The Santa Lucia range rises to more than 5,800\u00a0 ft (1760 m), and the amount of rainfall greatly increases as the elevation rises and cools the air, but rainfall amounts decrease sharply in the rain shadow of the coastal mountains. Scientists estimate that about 90 in. (230\u00a0 cm) falls on average near the ridge tops. But actual totals vary considerably.[10] Snowfall is rare on the coast, but is common in the winter months on the higher ridges of the Santa Lucia Range.[209]\n\n\nMonterey County maintains a remote rain gauge for flood prediction on Mining Ridge at 4,000\u00a0ft (1200 m) about 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km) north-east of Cone Peak. The gauge frequently receives more rain than any gauge in the Monterey and San Francisco Bay Areas. The wettest winter season was 1982\u20131983, when it rained more than 178 in. (452\u00a0cm) but the total is unknown because the rain gauge failed at that point. The wettest calendar year on record was 1982-83, when it rained 88.85 inches (2,257\u00a0mm).[10][210]\n\n\nThe month with the greatest rain fall total was December 1955 when it rained a record 27.21 inches (691\u00a0mm). At Pfeiffer\u2013Big Sur State Park on the coast, rainfall averaged about 43 in. (109\u00a0cm) annually from 1914 to 1987. In 1975\u20131976, it rained only 15 in. (39\u00a0cm) at the park, compared to 85 in. (216\u00a0cm) in 1982\u20131983.[10]\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Big Sur, California (1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1993\u2013present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 81(27)\n | 85(29)\n | 88(31)\n | 98(37)\n | 96(36)\n | 102(39)\n | 103(39)\n | 101(38)\n | 111(44)\n | 102(39)\n | 90(32)\n | 78(26)\n | 111(44)\n |\n| Mean maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 73.1(22.8)\n | 74.1(23.4)\n | 78.2(25.7)\n | 83.9(28.8)\n | 85.9(29.9)\n | 90.0(32.2)\n | 90.5(32.5)\n | 92.1(33.4)\n | 93.3(34.1)\n | 90.1(32.3)\n | 79.6(26.4)\n | 69.8(21.0)\n | 98.4(36.9)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 60.5(15.8)\n | 61.1(16.2)\n | 64.2(17.9)\n | 67.3(19.6)\n | 70.5(21.4)\n | 74.2(23.4)\n | 75.4(24.1)\n | 77.4(25.2)\n | 76.8(24.9)\n | 73.5(23.1)\n | 65.3(18.5)\n | 59.3(15.2)\n | 68.8(20.4)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 51.4(10.8)\n | 51.9(11.1)\n | 53.7(12.1)\n | 55.4(13.0)\n | 58.0(14.4)\n | 61.1(16.2)\n | 63.0(17.2)\n | 63.8(17.7)\n | 63.5(17.5)\n | 61.0(16.1)\n | 55.3(12.9)\n | 50.9(10.5)\n | 57.4(14.1)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 42.4(5.8)\n | 42.8(6.0)\n | 43.3(6.3)\n | 43.5(6.4)\n | 45.5(7.5)\n | 48.0(8.9)\n | 50.5(10.3)\n | 50.1(10.1)\n | 50.1(10.1)\n | 48.5(9.2)\n | 45.4(7.4)\n | 42.5(5.8)\n | 46.1(7.8)\n |\n| Mean minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 33.8(1.0)\n | 34.0(1.1)\n | 34.8(1.6)\n | 35.3(1.8)\n | 39.0(3.9)\n | 41.1(5.1)\n | 43.7(6.5)\n | 43.9(6.6)\n | 42.5(5.8)\n | 39.8(4.3)\n | 36.7(2.6)\n | 33.8(1.0)\n | 30.1(\u22121.1)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 27(\u22123)\n | 26(\u22123)\n | 27(\u22123)\n | 28(\u22122)\n | 35(2)\n | 37(3)\n | 41(5)\n | 40(4)\n | 39(4)\n | 31(\u22121)\n | 28(\u22122)\n | 27(\u22123)\n | 26(\u22123)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 9.48(241)\n | 8.59(218)\n | 6.72(171)\n | 2.94(75)\n | 1.15(29)\n | 0.20(5.1)\n | 0.06(1.5)\n | 0.05(1.3)\n | 0.13(3.3)\n | 1.88(48)\n | 4.16(106)\n | 9.18(233)\n | 44.54(1,131)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0.01 in) | 10.7\n | 11.2\n | 10.2\n | 6.3\n | 3.7\n | 0.8\n | 0.3\n | 0.4\n | 0.7\n | 3.0\n | 6.9\n | 10.6\n | 64.8\n |\n| Source: NOAA[211][212] |\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nSee also: California montane chaparral and woodlands\n\n![](image)Big Sur coast looking south near Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park\nThe many climates of Big Sur result in great biodiversity, including many rare and endangered species such as the wild orchid *Piperia yadonii*, which is found only on the Monterey Peninsula and on Rocky Ridge in the Los Padres forest. Arid, dusty chaparral-covered hills exist within easy walking distance of lush riparian woodland. Fort Hunter-Liggett is host to about one-fourth of all Tule elk found in California and provides roosting places for bald eagles and endangered condors. It also is home to some of the healthiest stands of the live valley and blue oaks.[213]\n\n\n\n### Southern limit of redwood trees[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sequoia sempervirens\n\nThe high coastal mountains trap moisture from the clouds: fog in summer, rain, and snow in winter creating a favorable environment for the coast redwood (*Sequoia sempervirens*) trees found in the Big Sur region. They are found near the ocean in canyon bottoms or inland canyons alongside creeks and in other areas that meet its requirements for cooler temperatures and moisture. Due to drier conditions, trees in the Big Sur region only grow about 200 feet (61\u00a0m) tall, smaller than specimens found to the north.[214]\n\n\nThe redwood trees in Big Sur are the remnant of much larger groves. Many old-growth trees were cut by the Ventana Power Company which operated a sawmill near present-day Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park from the late 1800s through 1906 when its operations were bankrupted by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. When John and Florence Pfeiffer opened Pffeifer's Ranch Resort in 1910, they built guest cabins from lumber cut using the mill. The mill was resurrected when Highway 1 was constructed during the 1920s. It supplied lumber for housing built for workers.[215][216]\n\n\nWhile many trees were harvested, several inaccessible locations were never logged. A large grove of trees is found along the north fork of the Little Sur River. William Randolph Hearst was interested in preserving the uncut redwood forest, and on November 18, 1921, he purchased about 1,445 acres (585\u00a0ha) from the Eberhard and Kron Tanning Company of Santa Cruz for about $50,000. He later donated the land to the Monterey Bay Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, who completed the construction of Camp Pico Blanco in 1954.[217]\n\n\nIn 2008, scientist J. Michael Fay published a map of the old growth redwoods based on his transect of the entire redwood range.[218] The southernmost naturally occurring grove of redwoods is found within the Big Sur region in the Southern Redwood Botanical Area, a 17 acres (6.9\u00a0ha) reserve located in the Little Redwood Gulch watershed adjacent to the Silver Peak Wilderness. It is just north of the Salmon Creek trailhead.[214][219] The southernmost tree is about 15 feet (4.6\u00a0m) from Highway 1 at the approximate coordinates 35\u00b049\u203242\u2033N 121\u00b023\u203214\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff35.82833\u00b0N 121.38722\u00b0W\ufeff / 35.82833; -121.38722\n\n\n\n### Plant species[edit]\n\n\nThe rare Santa Lucia fir (*Abies bracteata*) is found only in the Santa Lucia mountains. A common \"foreign\" species is the Monterey pine (*Pinus radiata*), which was uncommon in Big Sur until the late nineteenth century, though its major native habitat is only a few miles upwind on the Monterey Peninsula when many homeowners began to plant the quick-growing tree as a windbreak. There are many broadleaved trees as well, such as the tanoak (*Lithocarpus densiflorus*), coast live oak (*Quercus agrifolia*), and California bay laurel (*Umbellularia californica*). In the rain shadow, the forests disappear and the vegetation becomes open oak woodland, then transitions into the more familiar fire-tolerant California chaparral scrub.\n\n\n\n### Wildlife[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A harbor seal on a Big Sur beach\nThe Big Sur River watershed provides habitat for mountain lion, deer, fox, coyotes, and non-native wild boars. The boars, of Russian stock, were introduced in the 1920s by George Gordon Moore, the owner of Rancho San Carlos.[220] Because most of the upper reaches of the Big Sur River watershed are within the Los Padres National Forest and the Ventana Wilderness, much of the river is in pristine condition.\n\n\n\nFormer Grizzly bear range\nMain article: California grizzly bear\n\nThe region was historically populated by California grizzly bears. During the Spanish period of California history, the Spaniards rarely entered the area, except to capture runaway Mission Indians or to hunt grizzly bears that ate their livestock. The Mexican settlers captured bears for Monterey's bear and bull fights and they also sold their skins for 6 to 10 pesos to trading ships that visited Monterey. Bear Trap Canyon near Bixby Creek was one of their favorite sites for trapping grizzly bears.[221][222]\n\n\nThe California grizzly bear (Ursus arctos californicus) was heavier and larger than grizzly bears found elsewhere in the continental United States. Malcolm Margolin in *The Ohlone Way* wrote that \"These enormous bears were everywhere, feeding on berries, lumbering along the beaches, congregating beneath oak trees during acorn season, and stationed along nearly every stream and creek during the annual runs of salmon and steelhead.\" Grizzly bears presented a serious threat to human beings armed with only a bow and arrows and the Native Americans used to avoid them whenever possible.[223]\n\n\n*The Monterey Herald* noted on July 4, 1874:\n\n\n\n\n> Last Monday, Captain A. Smith, who resides about ten miles from town, in the Carmel Valley, succeeded in poisoning a large grizzly bear. Bruin had been annoying the neighborhood by destroying cattle, etc., for several years past, and all efforts to exterminate him seem futile. In some manner, however, he was induced to partake of that \u201ccold pizen\u201d the captain had prepared for his special benefit. He is not likely to repeat his experiment.[223]\n> \n> \n\n\nThere are remnants of a grizzly bear trap within Palo Corona Regional Park east of Point Lobos in a grove of redwood trees next to a creek.[224]\n\n\nEuropean settlers paid bounties on the bears who regularly preyed on livestock until the early 20th century.[19]:\u200a4 Absolom (Rocky) Beasley hunted grizzly bears throughout the Santa Lucia Range and claimed to have killed 139 bears in his lifetime.[225] The Pfeiffer family would fill a bait ball of swine entrails with strychnine and hang it from a tree. They wrote that the last grizzly bear was seen in Monterey County in 1941 on the Cooper Ranch near the mouth of the Little Sur River.[226] :\u200a21 Other sources report that last California grizzly was seen in 1924.[224][227]\n\n\nSince about 1980, American black bears have been sighted in the area, likely expanding their range from southern California and filling in the ecological niche left when the grizzly bear was exterminated.[10]:\u200a261\n\n\n\nSteelhead\nMain article: Rainbow trout\n\nThe California Department of Fish and Game says the Little Sur River is the \"most important spawning stream for Steelhead\" distinct population segment on the Central Coast, where the fish is listed as threatened.[228] and that it \"is one of the best steelhead streams in the county.\"[229]:\u200a166 The Big Sur River is also a key habitat for the steelhead.[230][231]\n\n\nA US fisheries service report estimates that the number of trout in the entire south-central coast area\u2014including the Pajaro River, Salinas River, Carmel River, Big Sur River, and Little Sur River\u2014have dwindled from about 4,750 fish in 1965 to about 800 in 2005.[232]\n\n\nNumerous fauna are found in the Big Sur region. Among amphibians the California giant salamander (*Dicamptodon ensatus*) is found here, which point marks the southern extent of its range.[233]\n\n\n\nCalifornia condor\nMain article: California condor\n\nThe California condor (*Gymnogyps californianus*) is a critically endangered species that was near extinction when the remaining wild birds were captured. A captive breeding program was begun in 1987. The Ventana Wildlife Society acquired 80 acres near Anderson Canyon that it used for a captive breeding program.[234] After some success, a few birds were released in 1991 and 1992 in Big Sur, and again in 1996 in Arizona near the Grand Canyon.[235]\n\n\nIn 1997, the Ventana Wildlife Society began releasing captive-bred California Condors in Big Sur. The birds take six years to mature before they can produce offspring, and a nest was discovered in a redwood tree in 2006.[236][237] This was the first time in more than 100 years in which a pair of California condors had been seen nesting in Northern California.[238] The repopulation effort has been successful in part because a significant portion of the birds' diet includes carcasses of large sea creatures that have washed ashore, which are unlikely to be contaminated with lead, the principal cause of the bird's mortality.[239]\n\n\nAs of July 2014[update], the Ventana Wildlife Society managed 34 free-flying condors.[240] There were part of a total population of 437 condors spread over California, Baja California and Arizona, of which 232 are wild birds and 205 are in captivity.[241]\n\n\n\n### Marine protected areas[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Coast view of the Big Creek State Marine Reserve\nThe off-shore region of the Big Sur Coast is protected by the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Within that sanctuary are other conservation areas and parks. The onshore topography that drops abruptly into the Pacific continues offshore where a narrow continental shelf drops to the continental slope in only a few miles. The ocean reaches a depth of more than 12,000 feet (3,700\u00a0m) just 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) offshore. Two deep submarine canyons cut into the shelf near the Big Sur coast: the Sur Submarine Canyon, reaching a depth of 3,000\u00a0ft (910\u00a0m) just 8\u00a0mi (13\u00a0km) south of Point Sur, and Partington Submarine Canyon, which reaches a similar depth of 6.8\u00a0mi (10.9\u00a0km) offshore of Grimes Canyon.[10]\n\n\nLike underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.\n\n\n\n* Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary\n* Point Lobos State Marine Reserve\n* Point Sur State Marine Reserve and Marine Conservation Area\n* Big Creek State Marine Reserve and Marine Conservation Area\n* Salmon Creek State Area of Special Biological Significance\n* California Sea Otter Game Refuge\n* Julia Pfeiffer Burns Underwater Park\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park after fire\nBig Sur is sparsely populated. There are about 1,800 to 2,000 year-round residents, only a few hundred more residents than found there in 1900.[30] Big Sur residents include descendants of the original ranching families, artists, writers, service staff, along with homeowners. The mountainous terrain, restrictions imposed by the Big Sur Coastal Use Plan,[242] limited availability of property than can be developed, and the expense required to build on available land has kept Big Sur relatively undeveloped. According to the Big Sur Chamber of Commerce, about half the businesses derive their income from the hospitality industry, and they in turn produce about 90 percent of the local economy.[243]\n\n\n\n### Population data[edit]\n\n\nThe United States does not define a census-designated place called Big Sur, but it does define a census tract (115) that includes almost all of the Big Sur coast, beginning in the north at Malpaso Creek and ending south of Lucia. It doesn't include New Camoldi Hermitage, Gorda, and Ragged Point where a few dozen people live, and it doesn't include the isolated private inholdings within the Los Padres National Forest. It includes much of the interior coast as far west as the Tassajara Zen Center.\n\n\nIn 1977, there were 1,813 residents and 846 dwelling units.[244] In 2018, the Census Bureau estimated there were 1,728 residents, (1,125 white, 525 Latino or Hispanic), 892 housing units, 639 households, 253 vacant or rental housing units; the median value of owner-occupied housing units was $877,100. Per capita income was $34,845; median income $63,843; mean income $81,766.[245]\n\n\nThe racial makeup of this area was 87.6% White, 1.1% African American, 1.3% Native American, 2.4% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 5.5% from other races, and 3.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race was 9.6% of the population. In the 93920 ZCTA, the population age was widely distributed, with 20.2% under the age of 20, 4.5% from 20 to 24, 26.9% from 25 to 44, 37.0% from 45 to 64, and 11.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43.2 years. The median income in 2000 for a household in 93920 ZCTA was $41,304, and the median income for a family was $65,083.[246]\n\n\n\n## Fire protection[edit]\n\n\nTwo local volunteer fire departments provide emergency services in the region. CalFire's nearest station is located in Carmel 33 miles (53\u00a0km) north of Big Sur Village. The United States Forest Service's Nacimiento Ranger Station is located on Nacimiento-Fergusson Road 7 miles (11\u00a0km) from the coast highway.[247][86] It was destroyed by the arson-set Dolan Fire on September 8, 2020 and is to be rebuilt.[248]\n\n\nDuring winter storms following the 2020 Dolan Fire, entire sections of the Nacimiento-Fergusson Road were washed away, and it has remained closed since then. In January 2022, U.S. Representative Jimmy Panetta announced that he had obtained $126 million in Federal Highway Administration funds to repair the road and rebuild the USFS Nacimiento Ranger Station destroyed in the blaze. This includes replacing the fire station, barracks, engine garage and pumphouse, along with some site utilities, such as a water well, solar connections and access roads.[249]\n\n\nDue to the remoteness of the region, it may take first responders more than one hour to respond to an emergency event. Following initial response and depending on the location, the nearest hospital is up to an hour away. In critical cases, patients can be flown out by air ambulance depending on their injuries and weather conditions.[86]\n\n\nThe volunteer Mid Coast Fire Brigade located on Palo Colorado Road was organized in June, 1979. Residents raised $300,000 to build a firehouse.[250] Members receive training in CPR, defibrillation, rope rescue, vehicle extrication, water rescue as well as structural, vehicle and wildland firefighting skills.[251] As of 2004[update], there were about 300 households in the Palo Colorado Canyon area. \n\n\nThe volunteer Big Sur Fire Brigade was founded by Gary Koeppel on August 1, 1974. He persuaded Walter Trotter, a member of a pioneer Big Sur family, to become the first fire chief. Trotter was enormously well-known and influential, and he very quickly appointed a number of volunteers. The brigade provides emergency response from mile marker 58.3 north of the Little Sur River bridge on Highway 1 to the San Luis Obispo County Line. The department has two stations. Station 1 is located south of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park at the Post Ranch. Station 2 is located near Gorda.[252]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nTwo schools are available to students in Big Sur. To the north, the Captain Cooper School serves 52 students from grades K-5 who live in the vicinity of Palo Colorado Canyon, Big Sur Village, Posts, and Slates Hot Springs. The land for the school was donated in 1962 by Frances Molera. She stipulated that it be named after her pioneer grandfather, Juan B. R. Cooper, who bought Rancho El Sur in 1840. The school was built by community members without assistance from the Carmel Unified School District, who assumed management of the school once it was complete.[253] Older students take a bus to Carmel schools.[254][255]\n\n\nTo the south, the Pacific Valley School was founded by the Plaskett family in 1880. It serves 22 students in grades K\u201312 in the areas near Plaskett, Lucia, and Gorda.[256] Closed repeatedly due to low or no enrollment, it reopened in the 1950s. Pacific Valley School is one of two schools in the Big Sur Unified School District. It has a 3:1 student/teacher ratio. They engage in collaborative learning between age groups.[257][258]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nAt the county level, Big Sur is represented on the Monterey County Board of Supervisors by Mary Adams.[259] In the California State Assembly, Big Sur is in the 17th Senate District, represented by Democrat John Laird, and in the 30th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Dawn Addis.[260] In the United States House of Representatives, Big Sur is in California's 19th congressional district, represented by Democrat Jimmy Panetta.[261]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n### In literature[edit]\n\n\nIn 1962, famous Beat author Jack Kerouac released the novel *Big Sur*, which prominently features the location throughout the narrative. It became one of Kerouc\u2019s most prolific works.[262]\n\n\nIn 1995, prominent environmentalist David Brower published *Not Man Apart: Photographs of the Big Sur Coast*, featuring Jeffers' poetry and photography of the Big Sur coast. In the posthumously published 2002 book *Stones of the Sur*, Carmel landscape photographer Morley Baer combined his classical black-and-white photographs of Big Sur with some of Jeffers' poetry.[263][264]\n\n\n\n### In film[edit]\n\n\nThe area's increasing popularity and reputation for beauty have attracted the attention of movie and television personalities and producers. Orson Welles and his wife at the time, Rita Hayworth, bought a Big Sur cabin on impulse during a trip down the coast in 1944. The couple never spent a single night there, and the property is now the location of a popular restaurant, Nepenthe.[265]\n\n\nA number of well-known films are set in Big Sur, including *The Sandpiper* (1965), starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Eva Marie Saint and Charles Bronson. The 1974 film *Zandy's Bride*, starring Gene Hackman and Liv Ullmann, was also based in the region.[266] In 2013, Jack Kerouac's novel *Big Sur* was adapted into a film of the same name, starring Kate Bosworth and directed by the actress' husband, Michael Polish. As of 2017[update], 19 movies had been filmed in the Big Sur region, beginning with *Suspicion* in 1941.[267]\n\n\n\n### In music[edit]\n\n\n\"California Saga: California\" (1973), a single on The Beach Boys' album *Holland*, depicts the rugged wilderness in the area and the culture of its inhabitants.[268]\n\n\n\"Going Back to Big Sur\" was written by Johnny Rivers, who sang it on his 1968 album \"Realization.\"[269] The closing stanzas: \"Guess I'll drive up Highway One / Did the ocean kiss the setting sun? / The stars dancing in the sky / Sort of puts you on a natural high\nGoing back to Big Sur / This time, I might just stay /I'm going back and straighten out my head /Just south of Monterey / And that girl.\"\n\n\nThe song \"Big Sur Moon\" from Buckethead's album Colma is named after the area.[270]\n\n\nThe song \"Bixby Canyon Bridge\" from Death Cab for Cutie's album *Narrow Stairs* explores the narrator's visit to Big Sur, waiting for an epiphany that never comes.[271]\n\n\n*The Dharma at Big Sur*, by John Adams, for electric violin and orchestra, was composed in 2003 for the opening of Disney Hall in Los Angeles.[272]\n\n\nAlanis Morissette released the song *Big Sur* as her \"ode to Big Sur with all its majesty\" as exclusive bonus track on the Target edition of her 2012 Havoc and Bright Lights album.[273] The song was released as single in 2014.\n\n\n\n### In computing[edit]\n\n\nApple's desktop operating system, macOS Big Sur, announced on June 22, 2020, during WWDC, is named after this region.[274]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Big Sur Land Trust\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Marvinney, Craig A.
