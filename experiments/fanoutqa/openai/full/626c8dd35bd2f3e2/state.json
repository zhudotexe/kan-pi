Prior to the game, he had been undefeated (5\u20130) as a captain, and since the format was changed in 2018.[333] During the game, he suffered a right hand contusion and was ruled out for the entire 2nd half.[334]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn the basis of his career longevity and on-court performances, sports publications have consistently included James in rankings of the best basketball players in history,[f] and he was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s.[435] In addition to praising James's on-court accomplishments, analysts have also noted James's influence on player empowerment throughout the NBA, which stemmed from his willingness to change teams during free agency. Ben Golliver of *The Washington Post* opined that James's move to the Heat in 2010 \"defined a decade of player movement\", and that he \"fundamentally flipped the power balance between stars and their organizations.\"[436] James's fellow players have also remarked on his influence, such as Warriors forward Draymond Green, who reflected: \"We've taken control of our destiny. And I think a lot of people hate that ... . I think the doors that he's opened for athletes and especially basketball players is his biggest accomplishment.\"[437]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLos Angeles Lakers  roster\n |\n| --- |\n| * 0 Hood-Schifino\n* 1 Russell\n* 2 Vanderbilt\n* 3 Davis\n* 4 Mays (TW)\n* 5 Reddish\n* 7 Vincent\n* 10 Christie\n* 11 Hayes\n* 12 Prince\n* 14 Castleton (TW)\n* 15 Reaves\n* 20 Giles (TW)\n* 21 Lewis\n* 23 James\n* 26 Dinwiddie\n* 28 Hachimura\n* 35 Wood\n |\n| * Head coach: Vacant\n* Assistant coaches:\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLeBron James\n |\n| --- |\n| Basketball career | * Career achievements\n* *The Decision*\n* Big Three (Miami Heat)\n* Banana Boat Team\n* The Block\n |\n| Family | * Savannah James (wife)\n* Bronny James (son)\n* Bryce James (son)\n |\n| Films | * *More than a Game*\n* *Shooting Stars*\n |\n| Television series | * *The Wall*\n* *The Shop*\n* *Million Dollar Mile*\n |\n| Related media | * The LeBrons\n* *MultiVersus*\n* *Mind the Game*\n |\n| Other ventures | * I Promise School\n* SpringHill Company\n |\n| ![](image) Category\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Various news outlets have commented on James being considered the greatest basketball player of all-time, and whether or not he has surpassed Jordan as the greatest:\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n100. **^** Wojnarowski, Adrian (July 16, 2010). \"Inside look at LeBron's free-agent coup\".

He came off the bench for just the second time in his career; the other being in 2007.[337][338] On April 2, James put up a triple-double with 18 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 134\u2013109 win over the Houston Rockets. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nState/Local\n* 6\u00d7 Cleveland Sports Awards Professional Athlete of the Year: 2004, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2015, 2016[627]\n* South Main Street in downtown Akron renamed King James Way[628]\n* Six-story commemorative banner in downtown Akron[628]\n* Featured on *Space Jam* inspired mural in Akron near his alma mater (St. Vincent St. Mary) and his I Promise school[629]\n* Featured on \"Cleveland is the Reason\" mural in downtown Cleveland (with other notable Cleveland area figures)[630]\n* Honorary lockers at Ohio State's football and basketball facilities[631][632]\n* LeBron James Home Court Museum in Akron, Ohio[633]\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Sports Illustrated* Sportsperson of the Year\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1954: Roger Bannister\n* 1955: Johnny Podres\n* 1956: Bobby Morrow\n* 1957: Stan Musial\n* 1958: Rafer Johnson\n* 1959: Ingemar Johansson\n* 1960: Arnold Palmer\n* 1961: Jerry Lucas\n* 1962: Terry Baker\n* 1963: Pete Rozelle\n* 1964: Ken Venturi\n* 1965: Sandy Koufax\n* 1966: Jim Ryun\n* 1967: Carl Yastrzemski\n* 1968: Bill Russell\n* 1969: Tom Seaver\n* 1970: Bobby Orr\n* 1971: Lee Trevino\n* 1972: Billie Jean King & John Wooden\n* 1973: Jackie Stewart\n* 1974: Muhammad Ali\n* 1975: Pete Rose\n* 1976: Chris Evert\n* 1977: Steve Cauthen\n* 1978: Jack Nicklaus\n* 1979: Terry Bradshaw & Willie Stargell\n* 1980: U.S. Olympic Hockey Team\n* 1981: Sugar Ray Leonard\n* 1982: Wayne Gretzky\n* 1983: Mary Decker\n* 1984: Edwin Moses & Mary Lou Retton\n* 1985: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\n* 1986: Joe Paterno\n* 1987: Bob Bourne, Judi Brown King, Kipchoge Keino, Dale Murphy, Chip Rives, Patty Sheehan, Rory Sparrow, & Reggie Williams\n* 1988: Orel Hershiser\n* 1989: Greg LeMond\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs an underclassman, James played wide receiver for St. Vincent\u2013St. Mary's football team.[16]:\u200a51 He was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.[36] At the conclusion of his second year, he was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals.[25] He did not play during his senior year because of a wrist injury that he sustained in an AAU basketball game.[37] Some sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, former and current players have speculated that James could have played in the National Football League.[b]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers (2003\u20132010)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2003\u20132004: Rookie of the Year[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican basketball player (born 1984)\n\n\"LeBron\" redirects here.

During an Instagram Live session, Anthony later recounted: \"He saved my life\".

He has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted *Saturday Night Live*, and starred in the sports film *Space Jam: A New Legacy* (2021). James has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron.[14][15]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2010: Roy Halladay\n* 2011: Aaron Rodgers\n* 2012: LeBron James\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain.[357][358] The team finished the tournament with an 8\u20131 record, winning another bronze medal.[357] James's behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.[359][360]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Nicknamed \"**the Hick from French Lick**\" and \"**Larry Legend**\", Bird is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time. He is the only person in NBA history to be named Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player, Finals MVP, All-Star MVP, Coach of the Year, and Executive of the Year.[1]\n\n\nGrowing up in French Lick, Indiana, he was a local basketball star. Highly recruited, he initially signed to play college basketball for coach Bob Knight of the Indiana Hoosiers, but Bird dropped out after one month and returned to French Lick and attended a local college. The next year he attended Indiana State University, ultimately playing three years for the Sycamores. Drafted by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft after his second year at Indiana State, Bird elected to stay in college and returned for the 1978\u201379 season. He then led his team to an undefeated regular season. The season finished with a national championship game match-up of Indiana State against Michigan State and featured a highly anticipated match-up of Bird against Michigan State great Magic Johnson, thus beginning a career-long rivalry that the two shared for over a decade. Michigan State won, ending the Sycamores' undefeated streak.\n\n\nBird entered the NBA for the 1979\u201380 season, where he made an immediate impact, starting at power forward and leading the Celtics to a 32-win improvement over the previous season before being eliminated from the playoffs in the conference finals. He played for the Celtics during his entire professional career (13 seasons), leading them to five NBA finals appearances and three NBA championships. He played most of his career with forward Kevin McHale and center Robert Parish, considered by some to be the greatest front court in NBA history.[2] Bird was a 12-time NBA All-Star, won two NBA Finals MVP awards and received the NBA Most Valuable Player Award three consecutive times (1984\u20131986), making him the only forward in league history to do so. Bird was also a member of the gold medal-winning 1992 U.S. Olympic basketball team, known as the \"Dream Team\". He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame twice as a player\u2014first in 1998 as an individual, and again in 2010 as a member of the \"Dream Team\". He was voted onto the NBA's 50 Greatest Players in NBA History list in 1996, and subsequently the 75th Anniversary Team list in 2021.[3]\n\n\nA versatile player at both forward positions, he could play both inside and outside, being one of the first players in the league to take advantage of the newly adopted three-point line. Bird was rated the greatest NBA small forward of all time by Fox Sports in 2016.[4] After retiring as a player, Bird served as head coach of the Indiana Pacers from 1997 to 2000. He was named NBA Coach of the Year for the 1997\u201398 season and later led the Pacers to a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals. In 2003, Bird was named president of basketball operations for the Pacers, holding the position until retiring in 2012.[5] He was named NBA Executive of the Year for the 2012 season. Bird returned to the Pacers as president of basketball operations in 2013,[6] and remained in that role until 2017.[7] Bird continued with the Pacers as an advisor until July 2022, then after nearly a year's break returned to the organization in the role of consultant.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBird was born in West Baden Springs, Indiana, to Georgia (n\u00e9e Kerns) and Claude Joseph \"Joe\" Bird, a veteran of the Korean War.[9] Bird's parents were of Irish, Scottish and some Native American descent.[10] He has four brothers and a sister.[11]\n\n\nHe was raised in nearby French Lick, where his mother worked two jobs to support Larry and his five siblings.[12] Bird has said that being poor as a child still motivates him \"to this day\".[13] Georgia and Joe divorced when Larry was in high school, and Joe died by suicide about a year later.[14]\n\n\nLarry used basketball as an escape from his family troubles, starring for Springs Valley High School and averaging 31 points, 21 rebounds, and 4 assists as a senior on his way to becoming the school's all-time scoring leader.[9][15] According to Bird, he grew up as a huge fan of the Indiana Pacers in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the 6'9 center Mel Daniels, who represented his first exposure to professional basketball.[16] Bird's youngest brother, Eddie Bird, also played basketball at Indiana State University, where Daniels would coincidentally become an assistant coach to the young Larry once he played there.[11]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![Bird in a basketball uniform, having just shot a ball](image)Bird warming up for Indiana State\nBird received a scholarship to play college basketball for the Indiana Hoosiers under head coach Bob Knight in 1974.[17] After less than a month on the Indiana University campus he dropped out of school, finding the adjustment between his small hometown and the large student population of Bloomington to be overwhelming.[9] He returned to French Lick, enrolling at Northwood Institute (now Northwood University) in nearby West Baden, and working municipal jobs for a year before enrolling at Indiana State University in Terre Haute in 1975.[18][19][20] He had a successful three-year career with the Sycamores, helping them reach the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history with a 33\u20130 record where they played the 1979 championship game against Michigan State.[21][22] Indiana State lost the game 75\u201364, with Bird scoring 19 points but making only 7 of 21 shots.[9]\n\n\nThe game achieved the highest-ever television rating for a college basketball game, in large part because of the matchup between Bird and Spartans' point guard Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson,[12] a rivalry that lasted throughout their professional careers. Despite failing to win the championship, Bird earned numerous year-end awards and honors for his outstanding play, including the Naismith College Player of the Year Award.[22] For his college career, he averaged 30.3 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game,[23] leading the Sycamores to an 81\u201313 record during his tenure.[22] Bird also appeared in one game for the baseball team, going 1-for-2 with 2 RBI.[24] He graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education.[25]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (1979\u20131992)[edit]\n\n\n#### Joining the Celtics (1978\u20131979)[edit]\n\n\nBird was selected by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft.[23] He did not sign with the Celtics immediately; instead, he played out his final season at Indiana State and led the Sycamores to the NCAA title game. Celtics general manager Red Auerbach publicly stated that he would not pay Bird more than any Celtic on the current roster, but Bird's agent Bob Woolf told Auerbach that Bird would reject any sub-market offers and simply enter the 1979 draft instead, where Boston's rights would expire when the draft began on June 25, and Bird would have been the likely top pick. After protracted negotiations, Bird inked a five-year, $3.25 million contract with the team on June 8, making him the highest-paid rookie in sports history.[26][15][27] Shortly afterwards, NBA draft eligibility rules were changed to prevent teams from drafting players before they were ready to sign, a rule known as the Bird Collegiate Rule.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Early success (1979\u20131983)[edit]\n\n\n![A box score with Bird's numbers highlighted](image)Bird recorded 14 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in his NBA debut against the Houston Rockets on October 12, 1979.\nIn his rookie season (1979\u201380), Bird immediately transformed the Celtics into a title contender. The team improved its win total by 32 games from the year before he was drafted and finished first in the Eastern Conference.[28][29] In his career debut, Bird recorded 14 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists in a 114\u2013106 win over the Houston Rockets.[30] On November 14, 1979, Bird recorded his first career triple-double with 23 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists in a 115\u2013111 win over the Detroit Pistons.[31] On November 23, Bird recorded his first 30-point scoring game (along with 11 rebounds and 3 assists) in a 118\u2013103 win over the Indiana Pacers.[32]\n\n\nWith averages of 21.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, 4.5 assists, and 1.7 steals per game for the season, he was selected to the All-Star Team and named Rookie of the Year.[23] In the Conference finals, Boston was eliminated by the Philadelphia 76ers.[29]\n\n\nBefore the 1980\u201381 season, the Celtics selected forward Kevin McHale in the draft and acquired center Robert Parish from the Golden State Warriors,[33][34] forming a Hall of Fame trio for years to come; the front-court of Bird, McHale, and Parish is regarded as one of the greatest front-courts in NBA history.[35][36][37] Behind Bird's leadership and Boston's upgraded roster, the Celtics again advanced to the conference finals for a rematch with the 76ers.[38] Boston fell behind 3\u20131 to start the series but won the next three games to advance to the Finals against the Houston Rockets,[39] winning in six games and earning Bird his first championship.[38] He averaged 21.9 points, 14 rebounds, 6.1 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the postseason and 15.3 points, 15.3 rebounds, and 7 assists per game for the Finals.[23][40]\n\n\nAt the 1982 All-Star Game, Bird scored 19 points en route to winning the All-Star Game MVP Award.[41] At the conclusion of the season, he earned his first All-Defensive Team selection.[23] He eventually finished runner-up in Most Valuable Player Award voting to Moses Malone.[41] In the Conference finals, the Celtics faced the 76ers for the third consecutive year, losing in seven games.[42] Boston's misfortunes continued into the next season, with Bird again finishing second in MVP voting to Malone and the team losing in the conference semifinals to the Milwaukee Bucks.[41][43]\n\n\n\n#### MVP threepeat (1983\u20131986)[edit]\n\n\n![Bird jumping into a layup](image)Bird playing for the Celtics in a game against the Washington Bullets\nBird was named MVP of the 1983\u201384 season with averages of 24.2 points, 10.1 rebounds, 6.6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game.[23] In the playoffs, the Celtics avenged their loss from the year before to the Bucks, winning in five games in the conference finals to advance to the Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers.[44] In Game Four, the Lakers\u2014led by Bird's college rival Magic Johnson\u2014were on the verge of taking a commanding 3\u20131 series lead before a flagrant foul was committed on Kurt Rambis that resulted in a brawl and caused the Lakers to lose their composure.[45] Boston came back to win the game, eventually winning the series in seven.[44] Bird was named Finals MVP behind 27.4 points, 14 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game.[44]\n\n\nOn December 9, 1984, Bird recorded 48 points to go along with 14 rebounds and 5 assists in a 128\u2013127 win over the Atlanta Hawks.[46] On March 12 of the 1984\u201385 season, Bird scored a career-high and franchise record 60 points in a game against the Atlanta Hawks.[47] The performance came just nine days after Kevin McHale set the previous Celtics record for points in a game with 56.[48] At the conclusion of the year, Bird was named MVP for the second consecutive season, behind averages of 28.7 points, 10.5 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game.[23] Boston advanced through the playoffs to earn a rematch with the Lakers, this time losing in six games.[49]\n\n\nDuring the 1985 offseason, Bird injured his back shoveling crushed rock to create a driveway at his mother's house. At least partially as a result of this, he experienced back problems for the remainder of his career.[50]\n\n\n\n![Bird holding a basketball, aiming to shoot](image)Bird playing for the Celtics in the 1985 NBA playoffs\nBefore the start of the 1985\u201386 season, the Celtics made a daring trade for Bill Walton, an All-Star center with a history of injury.[51] The risk paid off; Walton's acquisition helped Boston win a league best 67 games.[52] One of Bird's career highlights occurred at the 1986 NBA All-Star Weekend when he walked into the locker room at the inaugural Three-Point Shootout and asked who was going to finish second before winning the shootout.[53][54]\n\n\nOn November 27, 1985, Bird recorded 47 points to go along with 12 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals in a 132\u2013124 win over the Detroit Pistons.[55] On March 10, 1986, Bird scored 50 points to go along with 11 rebounds and 5 assists in a 115\u2013116 loss to the Dallas Mavericks.[56]\n\n\nWith averages of 25.8 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists, and 2 steals per game, Bird became just the third player in NBA history to win three consecutive MVP Awards.[57] In the playoffs, the Celtics lost only one game through the first three rounds en route to a match-up against the Rockets in the Finals.[51] In Game 6 of the Finals series, Bird recorded a triple-double of 29 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists as the Celtics won the Finals series 4 games to 2 against the Rockets.[58] Bird averaged 24 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 9.5 assists per game for the championship round.[59]\n\n\nThe '86 Celtics are commonly ranked as one of the greatest basketball teams of all time, with the *Boston Globe*'s Peter May and Grantland's Bill Simmons listing them at number one.[60]\n\n\n\n#### Falling short (1986\u20131988)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1987, the Celtics made their last Finals appearance of Bird's career, fighting through difficult series against the Milwaukee Bucks and Detroit Pistons. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Pistons, with five seconds remaining in the fourth quarter and Boston trailing the Pistons 107\u2013106, Bird stole an inbound pass. Falling out of bounds, Bird turned and passed the ball to teammate Dennis Johnson, who converted a game-winning 2-point layup with less than a second left. The dramatic play saved the series for the Celtics. When they reached the NBA Finals, the Celtics lost to a dominant Lakers team that had won 65 games during the season. The Celtics ended up losing to the Lakers in six games, with Bird averaging 24.2 points on .445 shooting, 10 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game in the championship series.[61] The Celtics fell short in 1988 losing to the Detroit Pistons in 6 games in the Eastern Conference finals as the Pistons made up from the heartbreak the previous season. Between them, Bird and Johnson captured eight NBA championships during the 1980s, with Magic getting five and Bird three. During the 1980s, either Boston or Los Angeles appeared in every NBA Finals.[62]\n\n\nThroughout the 1980s, contests between the Celtics and the Lakers\u2014both during the regular season and in the Finals\u2014attracted enormous television audiences. The first regular-season game between the Celtics and the Lakers in the 1987\u201388 season proved to be a classic with Magic Johnson banking in an off-balance shot from near the three-point line at the buzzer for a 115\u2013114 Lakers win at Boston Garden.[63] The historical rift between the teams, which faced each other several times in championship series of the 1960s, fueled fan interest in the rivalry. Not since Bill Russell squared off against Wilt Chamberlain had professional basketball enjoyed such a marquee matchup.[*citation needed*] The apparent contrast between the two players and their respective teams seemed scripted for television, as they were polar opposites in nearly every way conceivable. Bird was white, Johnson was black; Bird was an introvert from a small town playing in blue-collar Boston, while Johnson was the gregarious personification of the glitz and glamour of Los Angeles; Bird's Celtics played gritty, physical, defence-first basketball, whereas Johnson ran the Lakers' fast-paced Showtime offense. A 1980s Converse commercial for its \"Weapon\" line of basketball shoes (endorsed by both Bird and Johnson) reflected the perceived dichotomy between the two players. In the commercial, Bird is practicing alone on a rural basketball court (in reality the court was one Bird had made on the property in French Lick that he had purchased for his mother), when Johnson pulls up in a sleek limousine and challenges him to a one-on-one match.[64]\n\n\nDespite the intensity of their rivalry, Bird and Johnson became friends off the court. Their friendship blossomed when the two players worked together to film the Converse commercial, which depicted them as archenemies. Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony on February 4, 1993, and emotionally described Bird as a \"friend forever\".[65]\n\n\n\n#### Late career (1988\u20131992)[edit]\n\n\nThe 1987\u201388 season was the highest-scoring season of Bird's career. In Game 7 of the 1988 Eastern Conference semifinals against the Atlanta Hawks, Bird shot 9 of 10 from the floor in the fourth quarter, scoring 20 points in that quarter and lifting the Celtics to a series-clinching victory over Atlanta.[66][67][68] Bird finished with 34 points. His effort helped to overcome a 47-point performance by Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins.[69] Wilkins remarked, \"The basket was like a well. I couldn't miss. He couldn't miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I've ever played in or seen played.\" The Celtics failed to reach the NBA Finals for the first time in five years, losing to the Pistons in six games during the Eastern Conference finals.\n\n\nBird's 1988\u201389 season ended after six games when he had bone spurs surgically removed from both of his heels.[70] He returned to the Celtics in 1989, but debilitating back problems and an aging Celtic roster prevented him from regaining his mid-1980s form. Nonetheless, during the final years of his career, Bird maintained his status as one of the premier players in the game. In his final three seasons with the Celtics, Bird averaged over 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists per game, shot better than 45% from the field, and led the Celtics to playoff appearances.\n\n\nAfter leading the Celtics to a 29\u20135 start to the 1990\u201391 season, Bird missed 22 games due to a compressed nerve root in his back, a condition that eventually led to his retirement. He had off-season surgery to remove a disc from his back, but his back problems continued and he missed 37 games during the 1991\u201392 season. During the 1992 Eastern Conference semi-finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Bird missed four of the seven games due to recurring back problems.\n\n\nDuring Bird's final two seasons when he had serious back problems, the Celtics went 71\u201328 when he played. Without Bird, they had a 30\u201329 record, further demonstrating his importance and game-changing ability while on the court.[71][72][73][74]\n\n\nOn August 18, 1992, Bird announced his retirement.[75] Following Bird's departure, the Celtics promptly retired his jersey number 33.\n\n\n\n## Rivalry with Magic Johnson[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bird's rivalry with Magic Johnson *(pictured)* is often credited with popularizing the NBA.\nLarry Bird and Magic Johnson are known to be \"one of the greatest rivalries in sports.\"[76] Their rivalry began in college, when Larry Bird and Indiana State lost to Magic Johnson and Michigan State in the NCAA Championship game. Their rivalry continued on in the revived Celtics\u2013Lakers Rivalry in the NBA. Either the Celtics, led by Bird, or the Lakers, led by Magic, were present in every NBA Finals series in the '80s, with Bird and Magic meeting three times. Magic got the upper hand against Bird, beating him in 1985 and 1987, while Bird beat Magic in 1984.[77]\n\n\nJournalists speculated that Bird and Magic represented different contrasts, such as clashes between Celtics and Lakers, between East and West, and between Blacks and Whites. But, as one journalist would say, \u201cThey looked different, perhaps, but take a chainsaw to their souls and they were fraternal, if not identical, friends.\u201d[78] Watching Bird play was like watching Magic play, as they both shared this talent that the league had never seen before. They each had charisma, deft shooting touch, extraordinary passing skills, and team-oriented mindset that ignited their team and the crowd.[79] This style of play was starting to influence a new horde of fans as they would sit and \u201cmarvel at what they [Bird and Magic] can do\u201d while giving younger kids \u201ca different perspective of the game\u201d.[80]\n\n\nBird and Magic's presence on the court was only a small part of their contribution to basketball, as their rivalry changed the landscape of the NBA, transforming it from a \u201cstruggling, barely profitable league into a highly visible, financial and marketing dream for teams and players alike\u201d.[76] Many people realized that the emergence of these two stars were linked with the rise in popularity of the NBA, as the NBA started to market towards these two stars.[76]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Bird joined Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, and other NBA stars to play for the United States men's national basketball team in that year's Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.[81] It was the first time in the United States' Olympic history that the country sent NBA players to compete. The \"Dream Team\" won the men's basketball gold medal. In eight games, Bird averaged 8.4 points.[82] The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame called the team \"the greatest collection of basketball talent on the planet\".[83]\n\n\n\n## Player profile and legacy[edit]\n\n\nBird was voted onto the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team list in 1996,[84][85] and inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998.[86][87] He was inducted into the Hall of Fame again in 2010, as a member of the \"Dream Team\".[88] In 1999, Bird ranked No. 30 on ESPN SportsCentury's list of 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th century. He played both the small forward and power forward positions.[89] Universally recognized as an all-time great player, Bird was placed at the power forward position on an NBA all-time starting five roster with fellow superstars Magic Johnson (point guard), Michael Jordan (shooting guard), LeBron James (small forward), and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (center) in 2020.[90]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"Larry, you only told me one lie. You said there will be another Larry Bird. Larry, there will never, ever be another Larry Bird.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n-Magic Johnson, as quoted at Bird's retirement party.[91]\n\nBird has been described as one of the greatest basketball players and greatest shooters of all time.[92][93][94] He was selected to 12 NBA All-Star teams.[95] Bird won three NBA championships (in 1981, 1984, and 1986) with the Celtics[89] and won two NBA Finals MVP Awards.[96] Bird won three consecutive regular season MVP awards; as of 2020, the only other players to accomplish this feat are Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain.[97] Bird was also a four-time regular season MVP runner-up in 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1988.[98] Bird is also remembered as one of the foremost clutch performers in the history of the NBA; he was known for his excellent play in high-stakes, high-pressure situations.[99][100][101] In October 2021, as part of the NBA's 75th Anniversary, Bird was honored as one of the 75 greatest players of all time, by being named to the NBA's 75th Anniversary All-Time Team.[3] To commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Bird as the 7th greatest player in NBA history.[102]\n\n\nBird scored 24.3 points per game in his career on a .496 field goal percentage, an .886 free throw percentage, and a .376 percentage on three-point shots. Bird had an average of 10.0 rebounds per game for his career and 6.3 assists.[103] Bird was the first player in NBA history to shoot 50% or better on field goals, 40% on three-pointers, and 90% on free-throws in a single NBA season while achieving the league minimum for makes in each category.[104] He accomplished this feat twice.[105] Bird won NBA three-point-shooting contests in three consecutive years.[106] He sometimes practiced shooting three-point shots with his eyes closed.[103]\n\n\nBird is also remembered as an excellent passer[107] and defender.[89] While he was relatively slow, Bird displayed a knack for anticipating the moves of his opponent, making him a strong team defender.[92] He had 1,556 career steals.[108] In recognition of his defensive abilities, Bird was named to three All-Defensive Second Teams.[92]\n\n\nBird was widely considered one of Red Auerbach's favorite players. He considered Bird to be the greatest basketball player of all time.[109] Bird's humble roots were the source of his most frequently used moniker, \"The Hick from French Lick\".[110] Bird was also referred to as \"Larry Legend\".[111]\n\n\nBird was known for his trash-talking on the court and is remembered as one of the most notable trash-talkers of his era.[112][113] He was known for telling his opponents how and where in the court he would score against them; Xavier McDaniel recounted that Bird predicted a game-winning shot against him, then \"shot a shot right in my face and was like 'Damn, I didn't mean to leave two seconds on the clock.'\"[114] When playing against Dennis Rodman, a player known for his defensive abilities, in the 1987 Eastern Conference finals, Bird continually belittled Rodman's ability, at one point asking Chuck Daly, Detroit's head coach, to send in someone up to the task of guarding him.[115]\n\n\nAt the 2019 NBA Awards, Bird received the NBA Lifetime Achievement Award (shared with Magic Johnson).[116] Since 2022, the NBA will award the MVPs for the conference finals; the Eastern Conference Finals MVP trophy is named in Bird's honor, while the Western Conference trophy is named after Johnson.[117]\n\n\n\n## Coaching and executive careers[edit]\n\n\n![Bronzed shoes on a plaque with text describing Bird's basketball accomplishments](image)A Larry Bird plaque at Quincy Market, Boston\nThe Celtics employed Bird as a special assistant in the team's front office from 1992 until 1997.[118] In 1997, Bird accepted the position of coach of the Indiana Pacers[119] and said he would be on the job for no more than three years.[120] Despite having no previous coaching experience, Bird led the Pacers to a 58\u201324 record\u2014the franchise's best as an NBA team at the time\u2014in the 1997\u201398 season,[121] and pushed the Chicago Bulls to seven games in the Eastern Conference finals.[121] He was named the NBA Coach of the Year for his efforts.[122] Bird then led the Pacers to consecutive Central Division titles in 1999 and 2000 and a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals.[121] Bird resigned his head coaching position shortly after the end of the 2000 season, following through on his initial promise to coach for only three years.[123]\n\n\nIn 2003, Bird was hired as the Indiana Pacers' president of basketball operations.[124] After the 2011\u20132012 NBA season, Bird was named NBA Executive of the Year, becoming the only man in NBA history to win the NBA MVP, Coach of the Year and Executive of the Year.[125] On June 27, 2012, a day before the 2012 NBA draft, Bird and the Pacers announced that they would be parting ways; Bird said that health issues were among the reasons for his departure.[126] Bird returned to the Pacers as president of basketball operations in 2013.[6] He stepped down again in 2017, but stayed with the team in an advisory capacity.[127] He continued to serve as an advisor until July 2022, when he \"stepped back from maintaining an active role with the Indiana Pacers\".[128] Nearly a year later, it was announced in June 2023 the Pacers re-hired Bird to serve as a consultant.[8]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n**NBA**\n\n\n\n* 3\u00d7 NBA champion (1981, 1984, 1986)\n* 2\u00d7 NBA Finals MVP (1984, 1986)\n* 3\u00d7 NBA Most Valuable Player (1984\u20131986)\n* 12\u00d7 NBA All-Star (1980\u20131988, 1990\u20131992)\n* NBA All-Star Game MVP (1982)\n* 9\u00d7 All-NBA First Team (1980\u20131988)\n* All-NBA Second Team (1990)\n* 3\u00d7 NBA All-Defensive Second Team (1982\u20131984)\n* NBA Rookie of the Year (1980)\n* NBA All-Rookie First Team (1980)\n* 3\u00d7 Three-point Shootout champion (1986\u20131988)\n* Named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996\n* Selected on the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021[129]\n* No. 33 retired by Boston Celtics\n* Trophy named in Bird's honor (Larry Bird Trophy) awarded to Eastern Conference finals MVP (established in 2022)[130]\n* NBA All-Star Game head coach (1998)\n* NBA Coach of the Year (1998)\n* NBA Executive of the Year (2012)\n\n\n**USA Basketball**\n\n\n\n* 1992 Olympic gold medal (U.S. national team)[131]\n\n\n**NCAA**\n\n\n\n* John R.

In *One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird*, Bird plays opposite Julius Erving in a game of one-on-one. A sequel, *Jordan vs Bird: One on One*, was a 1988 basketball video game. In 2011, Bird was featured on the cover of *NBA 2K12*, alongside Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan. Bird is also a playable character in the revamped *NBA Jam*.[136]\n* In a McDonald's commercial from 1991 (first aired during the Super Bowl), Bird and Michael Jordan have a trick shot contest, in which the winner got Jordan's lunch and the loser had to watch the winner eat. In a commercial during Super Bowl XLIV, Dwight Howard and LeBron James challenge each other at trick shots for a McDonald's lunch. After they finish, clapping is heard, then the camera pans to the crowd, and Bird says \"Great show, guys. Thanks for lunch.\" Howard and James share a confused look. Howard asks, \"Who was that?\" James replies, \"I have no idea.\"[137]\n* Until July 2023, Twitter's logo was named Larry in honor of Larry Bird.[138][139][140]\n* Larry Bird is a character in the HBO series *Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty*.\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1975, Bird married Janet Condra. They remained married for less than a year. Following an attempted reconciliation, Bird and Condra had a daughter, Corrie, in 1977.[141]\n\n\nBird married Dinah Mattingly in 1989. They have two adopted children, Conner and Mariah.[141]\n\n\nDuring his professional career with the Celtics, Bird lived in the Boston suburb of Brookline, Massachusetts.[142]\n\n\n\n## Career

He played one season of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns and was selected as the second overall pick by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 2007 NBA draft. He played nine seasons with the franchise, which became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008, before signing with the Golden State Warriors in 2016, winning consecutive NBA championships and NBA Finals MVP Awards in 2017 and 2018. After sustaining an Achilles injury in the 2019 finals, he joined the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent that summer. Following disagreements with the Nets' front office, he requested a trade during the 2022 offseason and was traded to the Suns in 2023. He is regarded as one of the greatest players in NBA history.[1][2][3]\n\n\nDurant was a heavily recruited high school prospect who was widely regarded as the second-best player in his class. In college, he won numerous year-end awards and became the first freshman to be named Naismith College Player of the Year. As a professional, he has won two NBA championships, an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, two Finals MVP Awards, two NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Awards, four NBA scoring titles, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, been named to ten All-NBA teams (including six First Teams), and selected 13 times as an NBA All-Star. In 2021, Durant was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[4] As a member of the U.S. men's national team, Durant has won three gold medals in the Olympics (2012, 2016, and 2020) and is the leading scorer in Team USA's men's Olympic basketball history. He also won gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship.\n\n\nOff the court, Durant is one of the highest-earning basketball players in the world, due in part to endorsement deals with companies such as Foot Locker and Nike. He has developed a reputation for philanthropy and regularly leads the league in All-Star votes and jersey sales. In recent years, he has contributed to *The Players' Tribune* as both a photographer and writer. In 2012, he ventured into acting, appearing in the film *Thunderstruck*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDurant was born on September 29, 1988, in Washington, D.C.,[5] to Wanda (*n\u00e9e* Durant) and Wayne Pratt. When Durant was an infant, his father deserted the family; Wanda and Wayne eventually divorced, and Durant's grandmother Barbara Davis helped raise him. By age 13, his father reentered his life and traveled the country with him to basketball tournaments.[6][7] Durant has a sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne.[8]\n\n\nDurant and his siblings grew up in Prince George's County, Maryland, on the eastern outskirts of Washington, D.C.[9] He was unusually tall from a young age, and reached 6\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in (1.83\u00a0m) in height while still in middle school (age 10\u201312).[10] Growing up, Durant wanted to play for his favorite team, the Toronto Raptors,[11] which included his favorite player, Vince Carter.[11] He played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for several teams in the Maryland area and was teammates with future NBA players Michael Beasley, Greivis V\u00e1squez, and Ty Lawson, the first of whom Durant remains friends with to this day.[12]\n[13] During this time, he began wearing #35 as his jersey number in honor of his AAU coach, Charles Craig, who was murdered at the age of 35.[14]\n\n\nAfter playing two years of high school basketball at National Christian Academy and one year at Oak Hill Academy, Durant transferred to Montrose Christian School for his senior year, growing 5 inches (13\u00a0cm) before the start of the season and beginning the year at 6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in (2.01\u00a0m).[15]\n\n\nPrior to the start of the season, he committed to the University of Texas at Austin.[16] He had visited University of Connecticut and University of North Carolina, and said he considered Duke University, University of Kentucky and University of Louisville. When asked why he chose a college with a lesser-known program, he said, \"Wanted to set my own path.\"\n\n\nAt the end of the year, he was named the Washington Post All-Met Basketball Player of the Year, as well as the Most Valuable Player of the 2006 McDonald's All-American Game.[17][18] He was widely regarded as the second-best high school prospect of 2006, behind Greg Oden.[19][20][21]\n\n\nDurant had stated that he would have declared for the 2006 NBA draft if the NBA had not introduced the one-and-done rule, where his favorite team growing up, the Toronto Raptors, had the first overall pick.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant with the Texas Longhorns in 2007\nFor the 2006\u201307 college season, Durant\u2014who had grown to 6\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in (2.06\u00a0m)\u2014averaged 25.8 points, 11.1 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game for the Texas Longhorns.[5] Texas finished the season with a 25\u201310 record overall and a 12\u20134 record in conference.[24] Awarded a 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament, Texas won its first round match-up against New Mexico State but was upset in the second round by USC despite a 30-point and 9-rebound performance from Durant.[25] For his outstanding play, Durant was recognized as the unanimous national player of the year, winning the John R. Wooden Award,[26] the Naismith College Player of the Year Award,[27] and all eight other widely recognized honors and awards.[28][29][30][31][32][33] This made Durant the first freshman to win any of the national player of the year awards.[34] Following the season, he declared for the NBA draft.[35] His No. 35 jersey was later retired by the Longhorns.[36]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Seattle SuperSonics / Oklahoma City Thunder (2007\u20132016)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year (2007\u20132008)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant with the Sonics in 2008\nDurant was selected as the second overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics, after Greg Oden was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the first pick of the draft.[37] In his first regular season game, the 19-year-old Durant registered 18 points, five rebounds and three steals against the Denver Nuggets.[38] On November 16, he made the first game-winning shot of his career in a game against the Atlanta Hawks.[39] At the conclusion of the 2007\u201308 NBA season, he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year following averages of 20.3 points, 4.4 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game.[5] He joined Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James as the only teenagers in league history to average at least 20 points per game over an entire season.[40]\n\n\n\n#### Breakthrough (2008\u20132010)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing Durant's debut season, the SuperSonics relocated from Seattle to Oklahoma City, becoming the Thunder and switching to new colors \u2013 blue, orange, and yellow.[41] The team also drafted UCLA guard Russell Westbrook, who would form an All-Star combination with Durant in later years.[42] At the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend, Durant set a Rookie Challenge record with 46 points.[43] By the conclusion of the 2008\u201309 NBA season, he had raised his scoring average by five points from the prior season to 25.3 points per game,[5] and was considered a strong candidate for the Most Improved Player Award, eventually finishing third in the voting.[44] Durant continued to grow during his first few years in the NBA, finally reaching a height of 6\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in (2.11\u00a0m).[45]\n\n\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, Durant was selected to his first NBA All-Star Game.[5] Behind his play, the Thunder improved their record by 27 wins from the previous year and defied expectations to make the playoffs.[46][47] With a scoring average of 30.1 points per game, Durant became the youngest NBA scoring champion and was selected to his first All-NBA team.[5][48] In his playoff debut, he scored 24 points in a Game 1 loss against the Los Angeles Lakers.[49] Oklahoma City would go on to lose the series in six games,[50] but the team's performance led many analysts to label them as an upcoming title contender.[51]\n\n\n\n#### First NBA finals (2010\u20132012)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant scores on a slam dunk in March 2011 as a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nPrior to the start of the 2010\u201311 season, Durant announced via Twitter that he had signed a five-year contract extension with the Thunder worth approximately $86\u00a0million.[52][53] For the second consecutive year, he led the NBA in scoring, averaging 27.7 points a game.[54] Behind Durant's leadership, the Thunder won 55 games and earned the fourth seed in the Western Conference.[55] In the 2011 NBA playoffs, Oklahoma City defeated the Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies en route to a Conference Finals match-up versus the Dallas Mavericks, losing in five games.[56]\n\n\nOn February 19 of the lockout-shortened 2011\u201312 season, Durant recorded his first career 50-point game, scoring 51 points against the Denver Nuggets.[57][58] At the All-Star Game, he scored 36 points and was awarded the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award.[59] Durant finished the year with a scoring average of 28 points per game, representing his third straight scoring title.[60] Behind his play, the Thunder won 47 games and entered the 2012 NBA playoffs as the Western Conference's second seed.[61] In game 1 of the first round against the Dallas Mavericks, Durant hit a game-winner with 1.5 seconds remaining.[62] Oklahoma City would go on to defeat Dallas, the Lakers, and the San Antonio Spurs before losing to the Miami Heat in the 2012 NBA Finals.[63] For the NBA Finals, Durant led all players with 30.6 points per game, doing so on a 54.8 shooting rate.[64]\n\n\n\n#### 50\u201340\u201390 season (2012\u20132013)[edit]\n\n\nWith a scoring average of 28.1 points per game to finish the 2012\u201313 season, Durant failed to defend his scoring title; however, with a 51 percent shooting rate, a 41.6 percent three point shooting rate, and a 90.5 free throw shooting rate, he became the youngest player in NBA history to join the 50\u201340\u201390 club.[5][65] Finishing the year with a 60\u201322 record, Oklahoma City earned the first seed in the Western Conference.[66] In the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs against the Houston Rockets, Westbrook tore his meniscus, forcing him to miss the remainder of the postseason.[67][68] Without Westbrook, Durant was given more responsibility,[69] averaging a career-high 30.8 points per game throughout the playoffs,[5] but Oklahoma City were eventually eliminated in the second round by the Memphis Grizzlies in five games.[67]\n\n\n\n#### MVP season (2013\u20132014)[edit]\n\n\nIn January of the 2013\u201314 season, Durant averaged 35.9 points per game while scoring 30 or more points in 12 straight games, including a career-high 54 points against the Golden State Warriors.[70][71] In April, he surpassed Michael Jordan's record for consecutive games scoring 25 points or more at 41.[72] The Thunder finished the year with 59 wins and Durant was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player behind averages of 32 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game.[73] To begin the first round of the 2014 NBA playoffs, he struggled against the physical play of the Grizzlies, converting on only 24 percent of his field goals in game 4.[74] Through five games, the Thunder trailed the series 3\u20132, prompting *The Oklahoman* to dub Durant \"Mr. Unreliable\".[75] He responded by scoring 36 points in a Game 6 victory.[76] Oklahoma City eventually eliminated Memphis and the Los Angeles Clippers before losing to the Spurs in the Conference Finals in six games.[77]\n\n\n\n#### Final seasons with the Thunder (2014\u20132016)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant guards LeBron James in January 2015.\nPrior to the start of the 2014\u201315 season, Durant was diagnosed with a Jones fracture in his right foot and was ruled out for six to eight weeks.[78] He subsequently missed the first 17 games of the year, making his season debut for the Thunder on December 2 against the New Orleans Pelicans.[79] On December 18, he injured his ankle against the Golden State Warriors,[80] returning to action on December 31 against the Phoenix Suns to score a season-high 44 points.[81] He then sprained his left big toe in late January.[82] On February 22, he was sidelined again after undergoing a minor procedure to help reduce pain and discomfort in his surgically repaired right foot,[83] and on March 27, he was officially ruled out for the rest of the season after deciding to undergo foot surgery.[84] In just 27 games, he averaged 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game.[5]\n\n\nTo begin the 2015\u201316 season, Durant and Westbrook reached several historical milestones together, including becoming the first pair of teammates to each score at least 40 points in a single game since 1996, doing so in a win over the Orlando Magic on October 30.[85][86][87] For the year, Durant averaged 28.2 points, 8.2 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1.2 blocks per game,[5] leading the Thunder to 55 wins and the third seed in the West.[88] In game 2 of the first round of the 2016 NBA playoffs against the Mavericks, he scored 21 points but converted only 7 out of 33 shots in the worst postseason shooting performance, both by percentage and number of misses, of his career.[89] After defeating Dallas, Oklahoma City moved on to face the Spurs in the second round, falling behind 2\u20131 to start the series.[88] In game 4, Durant tied his playoff career high with 41 points in a Thunder win.[90] Oklahoma City eventually defeated the Spurs in six games, drawing a matchup with the record-setting 73-win Golden State Warriors in the Conference Finals.[88] Despite going up 3\u20131, the Thunder were ousted in seven games, with Durant providing 27 points in game 7.[91]\n\n\n\n### Golden State Warriors (2016\u20132019)[edit]\n\n\n#### First championship and finals MVP (2016\u20132017)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 4, Durant announced his intentions to sign with the Warriors in *The Players' Tribune*.[92][93][94] The move was received negatively by fans and pundits,[95][96] who felt that he took the easy route by leaving a team that had been up 3\u20131 and close to reaching the Finals to instead join their opponents, who had defeated them and were coming off a record-setting 73-win season; the Warriors had also won a championship the year before.[96][97][98] On July 7, Durant officially signed with Golden State on a two-year, $54.3 million contract with a player option after the first year.[99][100][101] Reflecting on the move for *Sports Illustrated*, Ben Golliver wrote, \"He chose an ideal roster fit and a shot at playing for the highest-scoring offense the NBA has seen in decades. He chose life alongside Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, the greatest shooting backcourt in history, and he chose to go against Andre Iguodala and Draymond Green, two elite defenders, in practices rather than in Western Conference finals games.\"[98]\n\n![](image)Durant after Warriors' practice in 2017\nDurant made his debut for the Warriors on October 25 against the San Antonio Spurs, scoring a team-high 27 points in a blowout loss.[102] On November 26, he recorded 28 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, and a career-high six blocked shots in a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, becoming the first player in team history to finish with at least 25 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, and five blocks in a single game.[103] On February 11, in his first game back in Oklahoma City since leaving for Golden State, Durant scored 34 points while being booed throughout the night as he helped the Warriors defeat the Thunder for the third time that year.[104] In March, Durant suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain and a tibial bone bruise, which forced him to miss the final 19 games of the season.[105][106] Golden State finished the year with a 67\u201315 record and entered the playoffs as the first seed.[107]\n\n\nDurant returned from injury in time for the 2017 NBA playoffs and helped the Warriors advance to their third consecutive Finals, while also becoming the first team in league history to start the postseason 12\u20130.[108] In game 1 of the series, Durant had 38 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists to lead the Warriors past LeBron James and the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers.[109] Durant then helped the Warriors go up 3\u20130 in the series with a 31-point effort in game 3, including the go-ahead 3-pointer with 45.3 seconds left in regulation.[110] In game 5, he scored 39 points to go with seven rebounds and five assists in a series-clinching win.[111] For the Finals, Durant was the Golden State's top scorer in every game, averaging 35.2 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 5.4 assists while shooting 55.5 percent from the field, 47.4 percent from three-point range, and 92.7 percent from the free throw line. He was subsequently named the NBA Finals MVP.[112][113]\n\n\n\n#### Second championship and finals MVP (2017\u20132018)[edit]\n\n\nAfter the finals, Durant declined his $27.7 million player option and became an unrestricted free agent.[114] On July 25, he re-signed with the Warriors for less money than the maximum, which helped the franchise create enough salary cap space to keep their core roster intact and add free agents.[115][116] On January 10 of the 2017\u201318 season, Durant scored 40 points in a loss to the Clippers, becoming the second-youngest player in league history to reach the 20,000-point milestone.[117] On January 23, he registered a career-high 14 assists in a win over the New York Knicks.[118] On February 14, he scored a season-high 50 points in a loss to the Trail Blazers.[119] In March, he missed games with a fractured rib, joining teammates Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson on the sidelines for the back-end of the season.[120] Golden State eventually finished the year with 58 wins and Durant set a career high for blocks in season with 119.[121]\n\n\nIn game 1 of the Western Conference Finals, Durant scored 37 points in a win over the higher-seeded Houston Rockets.[122] Through six games, the Warriors found themselves trailing 3\u20132, and Durant was criticized for contributing to Golden State's struggles by playing too much in isolation.[123] The Warriors staved off elimination in game 6, and in game 7 Durant scored 34 points, helping Golden State return to the Finals with a series-clinching victory.[124] In game 3 of the 2018 NBA Finals, Durant recorded a playoff career-high 43 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists in a win over the Cavaliers, leading the Warriors to a 3\u20130 advantage.[125][126] Golden State ultimately swept Cleveland and clinched a second straight championship; with averages of 28.8 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 7.5 assists, Durant also won his second Finals MVP Award.[127]\n\n\n\n#### Three-peat chase and injury (2018\u20132019)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant in 2019 during his third and final season with the Warriors\nOn July 7, 2018, Durant re-signed with the Warriors,[128] on a reported two-year, $61.5 million contract, which included a player option for the second year.[129] During an overtime loss to the Clippers on November 12, 2018, Green cursed out Durant over his upcoming free agency status after the season, and he was suspended for the much-publicized blowup.[130][131] On November 29, Durant scored a season-high 51 points in a 131\u2013128 overtime loss to the Toronto Raptors, thus scoring 40 or more in his third straight game.[132] With Curry and Green sidelined for most of November, the Warriors finished the month with a 15\u20138 record and five straight road losses,[132] after starting the season at 10\u20131.[133]\n\n\nIn game 5 of the first round of the playoffs, he scored a playoff career-high 45 points in a 129\u2013121 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.[134] In game 6, he set a new playoff career high with 50 points in a 129\u2013110 win to close out the series.[135] During Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Houston Rockets, Durant suffered a right calf strain,[136] subsequently missing Game 6, in which the Warriors won the series, as well as the entire Western Conference Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers, which the Warriors won in a four-game sweep.[137]\n\n\nAfter missing nine games with the strained right calf,[138] Durant returned to action in game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals against Toronto, and scored 11 points in the first quarter.[139] However, he was lost for the game two minutes into the second quarter when he tried to drive by former teammate Serge Ibaka and suffered an Achilles tendon injury, falling and grabbing his lower right calf. He limped off the court and was helped to the locker room. The Warriors won the game to cut the Raptors' series lead to 3\u20132.[139] The Warriors went on to lose the NBA Finals in game 6, ending their quest for a three-peat.[140]\n\n\n\n### Brooklyn Nets (2019\u20132023)[edit]\n\n\n#### Year absence (2019\u20132020)[edit]\n\n\nOn June 30, 2019, Durant announced that he planned to sign with the Brooklyn Nets after the July moratorium ended on July 6.[141] On July 1, Golden State CEO Joe Lacob announced that Durant's No. 35 will no longer be issued by the Warriors.[142] Durant signed with Brooklyn on July 7, in a sign-and-trade deal.[143] Durant did not appear at all in the 2019\u201320 season and later revealed that he had decided shortly after his June 2019 injury that he would be sitting out the entire 2019\u201320 season.[144] On March 17, 2020, Durant and three other Nets players tested positive for COVID-19.[145] On April 1, it was announced that Durant was cleared and had recovered.[146]\n\n\n\n#### Return to the court (2020\u20132021)[edit]\n\n\nOn December 22, 2020, Durant made his Nets debut, putting up 22 points, five rebounds, three assists and three steals, in a 125\u201399 win over the Golden State Warriors.[147][148] On January 14, 2021, James Harden was traded to the Nets in a blockbuster four-team deal, reuniting Durant with his former Thunder teammate.[149] On January 16, 2021, Durant scored a season-high 42 points in a 122\u2013115 win over the Orlando Magic.[150] On February 5, due to health and safety protocols, Durant came off the bench for the first time in his career in a 117\u2013123 loss to the Toronto Raptors.[151] In February, Durant suffered a hamstring injury, which forced him to miss 23 games.

He was 8 of 10 from the floor, going 3 of 3 on 3-pointers and 7 of 7 from the free-throw line as he outscored the Pistons 26\u201325 in the third. Durant has scored at least 40 points in his last three games against Detroit - the first player to do that since Rick Barry in the 1966\u201367 season. He also passed John Havlicek and Paul Pierce for 16th place on the NBA all-time career scoring list.[191][192] On December 26, Durant put up 32 points, nine rebounds, and five assists in a 125\u2013117 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers and moved past Tim Duncan for 15th on the NBA all-time career scoring list.[193] The next game, Durant had 26 points, a season-high 16 rebounds and 8 assists, and the Brooklyn Nets won their 10th straight game, 108\u2013107 over the Atlanta Hawks.[194] On January 3, despite Durant's 44-point outing on 15-of-22 shooting, 5-of-10 from three and 9-of-9 from the free throw line Chicago Bulls ended Brooklyn's 12-game winning streak.[195] On January 8, Durant passed Dominique Wilkins for No. 14 on the NBA all-time career scoring list, though he ultimately exited the game against Miami with a right knee injury.

J. Warren, to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson, Jae Crowder, four unprotected first-round picks, and a 2028 first-round pick swap.[198] Although Durant wanted to continue wearing No. 7 as he did in Brooklyn, the number was retired by the Suns in honor of Kevin Johnson. As a result, Durant announced that he would return to wearing the No. 35 jersey, which he had worn throughout his college and professional career prior to joining the Nets.[199]\n\n\nAfter being listed out since January 8 with a right knee injury, Durant made his Suns debut on March 1 against the Charlotte Hornets.[200] He put up 23 points on 10-of-15 shooting in 27 minutes, contributing to the Suns' 105\u201391 win.[201] On March 3 against the Chicago Bulls, Durant had another efficient night, scoring 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting.

He was ruled out roughly 15 minutes before the opening tip-off.[205] A day later, the Suns announced that Durant had suffered a left ankle sprain and would be re-evaluated in three weeks.[206] After missing the last 10 games, he made his return on March 29 against the Minnesota Timberwolves. In his home debut, Durant put up 16 points and eight rebounds in 29 minutes, contributing to a 107\u2013100 win.[207][208] In his eight games with Phoenix, Durant finished with an 8\u20130 record, averaging 26.0 points in 33.6 minutes per game and helping the Suns finish fourth in the Western Conference.[209][210] He also finished the regular season shooting over 55% from the field, over 40% from three-point range, and over 90% from the free throw line, becoming the first player in NBA history to achieve those shooting splits in a season.[211]\n\n\nOn April 16, Durant in his Suns playoff debut posted a near triple-double with 27 points, 9 rebounds and a playoff career-high 11 assists in a 115\u2013110 loss against the Los Angeles Clippers.[212] In Game 4 of the Suns' first-round playoff series against the Clippers, Durant logged 31 points, 11 rebounds and six assists in a 129\u2013124 win, to lead the Suns to a 3\u20131 series lead.[213] Four days later in Game 5 against the Clippers, Durant scored 31 points in a 136\u2013130 win to close out the series.[214] In Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Nuggets, Durant passed Karl Malone to climb into seventh place for NBA postseason scoring.[215] Four days later, Durant recorded 39 points, nine rebounds and eight assists in a 121\u2013114 Game 3 win.[216] The Suns eventually lost the series to the eventual NBA champion Nuggets in six games.

In recognition of his performances, Durant was named the 2016 co-USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year, along with Carmelo Anthony, for the second time in his career.[231]\n\n\nDurant committed to playing on the 2020 Olympic team, delayed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[232] He entered the Games ranked second in U.S. men's Olympic basketball history with 311 career points,[233] needing 25 to match Anthony's record of 336.[234][235] Durant broke Anthony's record on July 31 against the Czech Republic.[236] He led Team USA to a gold medal, and FIBA named him the tournament's MVP.[237] Durant's 20.7 points per game set a U.S. Olympic men's single-competition record for points averaged, and he tied Carmelo Anthony for most Olympic gold medals (three). He is also one of just four U.S. male basketball athletes to play in three or more Olympics.[238][239] In recognition of his accomplishments in the tournament, Durant was named 2021 USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year for the third time in his career.[240]\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2021, Durant played with the senior men's United States national team in 31 official games, in major FIBA tournaments, averaging 20.4 points, 5.4 rebounds and 3.1 assists. Overall, he brought home four gold medals as member of the national team: three from Olympic tournaments and one from the 2010 FIBA World Championship.[241] Durant, who has led the US in scoring in all three of his Olympic appearances and at the 2010 FIBA World Championship, owns eight U.S. Olympic men's career records, including the top spot for points (435), points averaged (19.8), field goals made (146) and attempted (276), 3-point field goals made (74) and attempted (148) and free throws made (69) and attempted (80).[242]\n\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant playing in a game between the Drew League and the Goodman League in August 2011\nDurant's height is officially 6\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in (2.11\u00a0m) and his primary position is small forward. In December 2016, Durant stated that his height in shoes was actually 7\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in (2.13\u00a0m) and that he understated his height in order to be listed as a small forward, rather than a power forward.[243] His career averages are 27.3 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 4.3 assists per game.[5] Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,[244][245][246][247] Durant has earned All-NBA honors ten times (2010\u20132014, 2016\u20132019, 2022) and was voted rookie of the year in his debut season.[5] He has also won an MVP Award and finished second in the voting three times, a trend that he has expressed frustration over.[248][249][250][251]\n\n\nDurant is best known for his prodigious scoring ability.[252] From 2010 to 2014, he won four scoring titles, becoming one of only two players to win four scoring titles in a five-year span.[253] Early in his career, his playing style was isolation-driven, but he quickly developed into an excellent off-ball player who was capable of scoring from the outside as well.[254] By 2013, he was shooting at a historically great clip, which helped him become one of only nine members of the 50\u201340\u201390 club.[255] This ability to impact the offense in a variety of ways helped Durant remain effective and improve an already elite offense upon joining the Warriors in 2016.[254] Throughout his career, his height and 7\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (2.24\u00a0m) wingspan have created matchup problems for defenses as he is able to get off a clean shot regardless of the situation.[256][257] Upon beating his man or gaining momentum, he also becomes a strong finisher at the rim; for example, he converted 72.2% of shots in the paint in 2012.[252]\n\n\nEarly in Durant's career, he was criticized for his slim build, defense, and passing.[258] Over time, he grew as a playmaker, increasing his assist numbers every year from 2010 to 2014,[256] though his overall vision still lagged behind the league's best passers'.[254] He also showed defensive improvement, with opponents averaging just .62 points per isolation play against him in 2014, the best success rate for defensive players who faced at least 100 isolations that season.[259] Upon going to Golden State, he developed into a more reliable off-ball defender and rim protector, and in 2018 was considered for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.[260]\n\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant during a flag football game at Oklahoma State University in 2011\nDurant is very close with his mother, Wanda, a relationship that was detailed in the Lifetime movie *The Real MVP: The Wanda Pratt Story*.[261] During his time with the Thunder, Durant described himself as a \"high school kid\" who enjoys playing video games in his spare time.[262] Durant is a Christian who attended Baptist schools.[263][264] He has religious tattoos on his stomach,[265] wrist,[263] and back.[266] He owns several properties in the Oklahoma City area and listed his primary residence, located in the affluent Club Villa neighborhood, for sale for $1.95 million in 2013.[267] That same year, he opened a restaurant, KD's Southern Cuisine, in the Bricktown neighborhood and briefly became engaged to Monica Wright, a WNBA player.[268][269][270] In 2016, he was a credentialed photographer for *The Players' Tribune* at Super Bowl 50.[271][272]\n\n\nDurant was formerly represented by agents Aaron Goodwin and Rob Pelinka.[273][274] He left Pelinka in 2013 and signed with the Roc Nation group, headed by Jay-Z.[274][275] Durant has endorsement deals with Nike, Sprint, Gatorade, Panini, General Electric, and 2K Sports.[276] In 2012, he tried his hand at acting, appearing in the children's film *Thunderstruck*.[277] In 2013, he earned $35 million, making him the fourth-highest-earning basketball player that year.[278] In an interview with *Sports Illustrated*, Durant claimed that, despite his high earnings potential, \"global marketing and all that stuff\" does not interest him.[276]\n\n\nOne of the most popular players in the league, Durant's jersey regularly ranks as one of the NBA's best-selling and he is consistently one of the top All-Star vote-getters.[279][280] Early in his career, he developed a reputation for his kind demeanor; in 2013, Foot Locker released a series of commercials calling him the \"nicest guy in the NBA\",[281] and become a beloved figure in Oklahoma City, known for his \"nice escapades\" toward the Thunder's staff.[282] In 2014, he partnered with KIND snacks and launched StrongAndKind.com to show \"being kind is not a sign of weakness.\"[283] Since joining the Warriors, he has become more outspoken and controversial; for example, he was involved in a Twitter back-and-forth with CJ McCollum in July 2018.[284] Durant has admitted to feeling more genuine in Golden State as opposed to Oklahoma City, where he was \"just trying to please everybody\".[285] He's very active on Twitter,[286] often engaging in chippy comments with fans and members of the media.[287]\n\n\nThroughout his career, Durant has participated in philanthropic causes. In 2013, he pledged $1 million to the American Red Cross for the victims of the 2013 Moore tornado.[288] His generosity inspired the Thunder and Nike to match his donation.[289] He is also a spokesperson for the Washington, D. C. branch of P'Tones Records, a nationwide non-profit after-school music program.[290]\n\n\n\n![](image)Durant speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco in 2017\nIn 2017, Durant became involved with YouTube. In February, he visited YouTube's headquarters for a speaking engagement.[291] On April 7, 2017, he created a YouTube account and soon began to upload live stream vlogs onto it.[292][293] In his first vlog, he detailed, \"I'm so excited because I got off social media. I got off the Instagram, Twitter, all that stuff, just to distance myself a bit. But somebody talked me into getting on the YouTube.\"[293] As of June 2020, Durant's YouTube channel has received over 790,000 subscribers and 38 million video views.[292] On February 13, 2018, *Deadline* reported that Durant, in partnership with producer Brian Grazer's Imagine Television, will create a basketball-themed scripted drama for Apple.[294]\n\n\nIn 2017, Durant and business partner Rich Kleiman founded Thirty Five Ventures.[295][296][297][298] In 2020, Thirty Five Ventures produced *Basketball County*, a documentary about youth basketball in Durant's home county of Prince George's County, Maryland. Durant served as an executive producer and appeared in interviews.[299] Thirty Five Ventures' work *Two Distant Strangers* won the 2021 Academy Award for Short Film (Live Action).[300][301]\n\n\nDurant was included in *Time* magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2018.[302]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2020, Durant became a minority owner of MLS side Philadelphia Union, acquiring a 5% stake with the possibility to add another 5% in the near future.[303]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Durant announced a partnership between his multimedia company Boardroom and the cannabis technology company Weedmaps through which an original content series would be developed and Weedmaps would become an official sponsor of Boardroom.[304][305] Durant said of the partnership: \"I think it's far past time to address the stigmas around cannabis that still exist in the sports world as well as globally. This partnership is going to help us continue to normalize those conversations, as well as create content, events, and a lot more through our Boardroom media network.\"[306]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Durant (through Thirty Five Ventures) was announced as an investor in Just Women's Sports, an American media platform dedicated to women's sports. Durant credited the platform with showing \"fans exactly how good these players are and why they're worth watching.\"[307]\n\n\nOn December 22, 2021, he had signed a deal with Coinbase to serve as a brand ambassador.[308]\n\n\nIn October 2022, Durant joined fellow professional athletes LeBron James, Tom Brady, and Drew Brees as an investor in a professional pickleball team with his business partner, Rich Kleiman, via their Thirty Five Ventures (35V) firm.[309][310]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n | \u00a0\u00a0GS\u00a0\n | Games

Erving helped legitimize the American Basketball Association (ABA),[1] and he was the best-known player in that league when it merged into the National Basketball Association (NBA) after the 1975\u20131976 season.\n\n\nErving won three championships, four Most Valuable Player awards, and three scoring titles with the ABA's Virginia Squires and New York Nets (now the NBA's Brooklyn Nets) and the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers. During his 16 seasons as a player, none of his teams ever missed the postseason. He is the eighth-highest scorer in ABA/NBA history with 30,026 points (NBA and ABA combined). He was well known for slam dunking from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests and was the only player voted Most Valuable Player in both the ABA and the NBA. The basketball slang of being posterized was first coined to describe his moves. In 1993, Erving was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. In 1994, Erving was named by *Sports Illustrated* as one of the 40 most important athletes of all time. In 1996, Erving was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team.[2] In 2004, he was inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame. In October 2021, Erving was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[3]\n\n\nMany consider him one of the most talented players in the history of the NBA; he is widely acknowledged as one of the game's best dunkers. While Connie Hawkins, \"Jumping\" Johnny Green, Elgin Baylor, Jim Pollard, and Gus Johnson performed spectacular dunks before Erving's time, Erving brought the practice into the mainstream.[4] His signature was the slam dunk, since incorporated into the vernacular and basic skill set of the game in the same manner as the crossover dribble and the no look pass. Before Erving, dunking was a practice most commonly used by the big men, usually standing close to the hoop, to show their brutal strength which was seen as style over substance, even unsportsmanlike, by many purists of the game;[5] however, the way Erving utilized the dunk more as a high-percentage shot made at the end of maneuvers generally starting well away from the basket and not necessarily a show of force helped to make the shot an acceptable tactic, especially in trying to avoid a blocked shot.[6] Although the slam dunk is still widely used as a show of power, a method of intimidation, and a way to fire up a team and spectators, Erving demonstrated that there can be great artistry and grace in slamming the ball into the hoop, particularly after a launch several feet from that target.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nErving was born February 22, 1950, in East Meadow, on Long Island,[8][9][10] and raised from the age of 13 in Roosevelt, New York. Prior to that, he lived in nearby Hempstead. He attended Roosevelt High School and played for its basketball team. He received the nickname \"Doctor\" or \"Dr. J\" from a high school friend named Leon Saunders. He explains: \"I started calling [Saunders] 'the professor', and he started calling me 'the doctor'. So it was just between us...we were buddies, we had our nicknames and we would roll with the nicknames. ... And that's where it came from.\"[11]\n\n\nErving recalled that \"later on, in the Rucker Park league in Harlem, when people started calling me 'Black Moses' and 'Houdini', I told them if they wanted to call me anything, call me 'Doctor'\".[12] Over time, the nickname evolved into \"Dr. Julius\" and finally \"Dr. J.\"[13] Erving was first called \"Dr. J\" by his friend and future teammate on the Nets and Squires, Willie Sojourner.[14]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Erving at Massachusetts, c. 1970\u201371\nErving enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1968. In two varsity college basketball seasons, he averaged 26.3 points[15] and 20.2 rebounds per game, becoming one of only six players[16] to average more than 20 points and 20 rebounds per game in NCAA Men's Basketball.[17] In 1968, the NCAA adopted a rule that prohibited dunking. Thus, Erving's dunking was only seen and known to teammates at practice.[18] He then sought \u201chardship\u201d entry into professional basketball in 1971.\n\n\nFifteen years later, Erving fulfilled a promise he had made to his mother by earning a bachelor's degree in creative leadership and administration from the school through the University Without Walls program.[19][20] Erving also holds an honorary doctorate from UMass.[19] In September 2021, Massachusetts honored Erving by unveiling a statue outside the Mullins Center on the university's campus.[21][22]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Virginia Squires (ABA)[edit]\n\n\nAlthough NBA rules at the time did not allow teams to draft players who were fewer than four years removed from high school, the ABA instituted a \u201chardship\u201d rule that would allow players to leave college early.[23] Erving took advantage of the rule change and left Massachusetts after his junior year to sign a four-year contract worth $500,000 spread over seven years with the Virginia Squires.[24][25]\n\n\nErving quickly established himself as a force and gained a reputation for hard and ruthless dunking. He scored 27.3 points per game as a rookie, was selected to the All-ABA Second Team, made the ABA All-Rookie Team, led the ABA in offensive rebounds, and finished second to Artis Gilmore for the ABA Rookie of the Year Award. He led the Squires into the Eastern Division Finals, where they lost to the Rick Barry-led New York Nets in seven games. The Nets would eventually go to the finals, losing to the star-studded Indiana Pacers team.[26]\n\n\n\n### ABA\u2013NBA contract dispute[edit]\n\n\nUnder NBA rules, he became eligible for the 1972 NBA draft and the Milwaukee Bucks picked him in the first round (12th overall), a move that would have brought him together with Oscar Robertson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Prior to the draft, he signed a contract with the Atlanta Hawks worth more than $1 million with a $250,000 bonus.[27] The signing with the Hawks came after a dispute with the Squires where he demanded a renegotiation of the terms.[25] He discovered that his agent at the time, Steve Arnold, was employed by the Squires and convinced him to sign a below-market contract.[28]\n\n\nThis created a dispute between three teams in two leagues. The Bucks asserted their rights to Erving via the draft, while the Squires went to court to force him to honor his contract. He joined Pete Maravich at the Hawks' training camp, as they prepared for the upcoming season. He played two exhibition games with the Hawks until NBA Commissioner J. Walter Kennedy ruled that the Bucks owned Erving's rights via the draft. Kennedy fined the Hawks $25,000 per game in violation of his ruling. Atlanta appealed Kennedy's decision to the league owners, who also supported the Bucks\u2019 position.[29] While waiting for the owners\u2019 decision, Erving played in one more preseason game, earning the Hawks another fine. Erving enjoyed his brief time with Atlanta, and he would later duplicate with George Gervin his after-practice playing with Maravich.[30]\n\n\nOn October 2, Judge Edward Neaher issued an injunction that prohibited him from playing for any team other than the Squires. The judge then sent the case to arbitration because of an arbitration clause in Erving's contract with Virginia.[30] He agreed to report to the Squires while his appeal of the injunction made its way through the court.[31]\n\n\nBack in the ABA, his game flourished, and he achieved a career-best 31.9 points per game in the 1972\u20131973 season. The following year, the cash-strapped Squires sold his contract to the New York Nets.[32]\n\n\n\n### New York Nets (ABA)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Erving in 1974\nThe Squires, like most ABA teams, were on rather shaky financial ground. The cash-strapped team sent Erving to the Nets in a complex deal that kept him in the ABA. Erving signed an eight-year deal worth a reported $350,000 per year. The Squires received $750,000, George Carter, and the rights to Kermit Washington for Erving and Willie Sojourner. The Nets also sent $425,000 to the Hawks to reimburse the team for its legal fees, fines and the bonus paid to Erving. Finally, Atlanta would receive draft compensation should a merger of the league result in a common draft.[27]\n\n\nErving went on to lead the Nets to their first ABA title in 1973\u20131974, defeating the Utah Stars.[33] Erving established himself as the most important player in the ABA. His spectacular play established the Nets as one of the better teams in the ABA, and brought fans and credibility to the league.[34]\nThe end of the 1975\u201376 ABA season finally brought the ABA\u2013NBA merger. The Nets and Nuggets had applied for admission to the NBA before the season, in anticipation of the eventual merger that had first been proposed by the two leagues in 1970 but which was delayed for various reasons, including the Oscar Robertson free agency suit (which was not resolved until 1976). The Erving-led Nets defeated the Denver Nuggets in the ABA's final championship. In the postseason, Erving averaged 34.7 points and was named Most Valuable Player of the playoffs. That season, he finished in the top 10 in the ABA in points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, steals per game, blocks per game, free throw percentage, free throws made, free throws attempted, three-point field goal percentage and three-point field goals made. This is the only season in the ABA or the NBA where such a feat was accomplished.[35]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia 76ers (NBA)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

With Erving and Nate Archibald (acquired in a trade with Kansas City), the Nets were poised to pick up right where they left off. However, the New York Knicks upset the Nets' plans when they demanded that the Nets pay them $4.8 million for \"invading\" the Knicks' NBA territory. Coming on the heels of the fees the Nets had to pay for joining the NBA, owner Roy Boe reneged on a promise to raise Erving's salary. Erving refused to play under these conditions and held out in training camp.[36]\n\n\nAfter several teams such as the Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers and Philadelphia 76ers lobbied to obtain him, the Nets offered Erving's contract to the New York Knicks in return for waiving the indemnity, but the Knicks turned it down. This was considered one of the worst decisions in franchise history.[37] The Sixers then decided to offer to buy Erving's contract for $3 million\u2014in addition to paying roughly the Nets same amount as their expansion fee\u2014and Boe had little choice but to accept the $6 million deal.[38] For all intents and purposes, the Nets traded their franchise player for a berth in the NBA. The Erving deal left the Nets in ruin; they promptly crashed to a 22\u201360 record, the worst in the league.[39] Years later, Boe regretted having to trade Erving to join the NBA, saying, \"The merger agreement killed the Nets as an NBA franchise.\"[40]\n\n\nErving quickly became the leader of his new club and led them to an exciting 50-win season. However, playing with other stars-such as former ABA standout George McGinnis, future NBA All-Star Lloyd Free, and aggressive Doug Collins allowed him to focus on playing more team-oriented ball. Despite a smaller role, Erving stayed unselfish. The Sixers won the Atlantic Division and were the top drawing team in the NBA. They defeated the defending champions, the Boston Celtics, to win the Eastern Conference. Erving took them into the NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers of Bill Walton. After the Sixers took a 2\u20130 lead, however, the Blazers ran off four straight victories after the famous brawl between Maurice Lucas and Darryl Dawkins which ignited the Blazers' team.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Erving playing against the Atlanta Hawks in 1981\nErving enjoyed success off the court, becoming one of the first basketball players to endorse many products and to have a shoe marketed under his name. He also starred in the 1979 basketball comedy film, *The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh*. In the following years, Erving coped with a team that was not yet playing at his level. It took a few years for the Sixers franchise to build around Erving. Eventually, coach Billy Cunningham and top-level players like Maurice Cheeks, Andrew Toney, and Bobby Jones were added to the mix and the franchise was very successful.\n\n\nThe Sixers were still eliminated twice in the Eastern Conference Finals. In 1979, Larry Bird entered the league, reviving the Boston Celtics and the storied Celtics\u201376ers rivalry; these two teams faced each other in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1985. The Bird vs. Erving matchup became arguably the top personal rivalry in the sport (along with Bird vs. Magic Johnson), inspiring the early Electronic Arts video game *One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird*. In 1980, the 76ers prevailed over the Celtics to advance to the NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. There, Erving executed the legendary \"Baseline Move\", a behind-the-board reverse layup. However, the Lakers won the series 4\u20132 with superb play from, among others, Magic Johnson. Erving also made the only three point shot in that NBA Finals series, which was the first time the three point line was introduced in the league.[42]\n\n\nErving was again among the league's best players in the 1980\u20131981 and 1981\u20131982 seasons, although more disappointment came as the Sixers stumbled twice in the playoffs: in 1981, the Celtics eliminated them in seven games in the 1981 Eastern Finals after Philadelphia had a 3\u20131 series lead, but lost both Game 5 and Game 6 by 2 points and the deciding Game 7 by 1; and in 1982, the Sixers managed to beat the defending champion Celtics in seven games in the 1982 Eastern Finals but lost the NBA Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games. Despite these defeats, Erving was named the NBA MVP in 1981 and was again voted to the 1982 All-NBA First Team.[43]\n\n\nFor the 1982\u20131983 season, the Sixers obtained the missing element to combat their weakness at their center position, Moses Malone. Armed with one of the most formidable and unstoppable center-forward combinations of all time, the Sixers dominated the whole season, prompting Malone to make the famous playoff prediction of \"fo-fo-fo (four-four-four)\" in anticipation of the 76ers sweeping the three rounds of the playoffs en route to an NBA title.[44] In fact, the Sixers went four-five-four, losing one game to the Milwaukee Bucks in the conference finals, then sweeping the Lakers to win the NBA title.\n\n\n\n![](image)Erving during his final season in 1987\nErving maintained his all-star caliber of play into his twilight years, averaging 22.4, 20.0, 18.1, and 16.8 points per game in his final seasons.[45] In 1986, he announced that he would retire after the season. That final season saw opposing teams pay tribute to Erving in the last game he would play in their arenas, including in cities such as Boston and Los Angeles, his perennial rivals in the playoffs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **does not include any references or sources**.

Johnny Kerr told ABA historian Terry Pluto: \"A young Julius Erving was like Thomas Edison, he was always inventing something new every night.\" He is also one of the few players in modern basketball to have his number retired by two franchises: the Brooklyn Nets (formerly the New York Nets and New Jersey Nets) have retired his No. 32 jersey, and the Philadelphia 76ers his No. 6 jersey. He was an excellent all around player who was also an underrated defender. In his ABA days, he would guard the best forward, whether small forward or power forward, for over 40 minutes a game, and simultaneously be the best passer, ball handler, and clutch scorer every night. Many of Erving's acrobatic highlight feats and clutch moments were unknown because of the ABA's scant television coverage. He is considered by many as the greatest dunker of all time.\n\n\nIn his ABA and NBA careers combined, he scored more than 30,000 points. In 1993, Erving was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and in 1996 he was inducted into the NYC Basketball Hall of Fame. When he retired, Erving ranked in the top five in scoring (third), field goals made (third), field goals attempted (fifth) and steals (first). On the combined NBA/ABA scoring list, Erving ranked third with 30,026 points. As of 2022[update], Erving ranks eighth on the list, behind only LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Dirk Nowitzki, and Wilt Chamberlain.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

Erving started by dunking two balls in the hoop. Then, he performed a move that brought the slam dunk contest to the national consciousness. He ran to the opposite end of the court and back, and dunked the basketball from the free throw line. Although dunking from the foul line had been done by other players (Jim Pollard and Wilt Chamberlain in the 1950s, for example), Erving introduced the dunk from the foul line to a wider audience, when he demonstrated the feat in the 1976 ABA All-Star Game Slam Dunk Contest.\n\n\n\n### Dunk over Bill Walton[edit]\n\n\nThis event transpired during game 6 of the 1977 NBA Finals. After Portland scored a basket, Erving immediately ran the length of the court with the entire Blazers team defending him. He performed a crossover to blow by multiple defenders, seemingly gliding to the hoop with ease. With UCLA defensive legend Bill Walton waiting in the post, Erving threw down a vicious slam dunk over Walton's outstretched arms. This dunk is considered by many to be one of the strongest dunks ever attempted,[*citation needed*] considering he ran full court with all five defenders running with him. This move was one of the highlights of his arrival to a more television-exposed NBA.\n\n\n\n### Baseline move[edit]\n\n\nOne of his most memorable plays occurred during the 1980 NBA Finals, when he executed a seemingly impossible finger-roll behind the backboard.[46][47] He drove past Lakers forward Mark Landsberger on the right baseline and went in for a layup. Then 7\u20322\u2033 center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar crossed his way, blocking the route to the basket and forcing him outwards. In mid-air, it was apparent that Erving would land behind the backboard. But somehow he managed to reach over and score on a right-handed layup despite the fact that his whole body, including his left shoulder, was already behind the hoop. This move, along with his free-throw line dunk, has become one of the signature events of his career. It was called by *Sports Illustrated*, \"The, No Way, even for Dr J, Flying Reverse Lay-up\". Dr J called it \"just another move\".\n\n\n\n### \"Rock the Baby\" dunk over Michael Cooper[edit]\n\n\nAnother of Erving's most memorable plays came in the final moments of a regular-season game against the Los Angeles Lakers in 1983. After Sixers point guard Maurice Cheeks deflected a pass by Lakers forward James Worthy, Erving picked up the ball and charged down the court's left side, with one defender to beat\u2014the Lakers' top defender Michael Cooper. As he came inside of the 3-point line, he cupped the ball into his wrist and forearm, rocking the ball back and forth before taking off for what Lakers radio broadcaster Chick Hearn best described as a \"Rock the Baby\" slam dunk: he slung the ball around behind his head and dunked over a ducking Cooper. This dunk is generally regarded as one of the greatest dunks of all time.[48]\n\n\n\n## Post-basketball career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Erving (top left) with other former NBA players visit the New York NBA Store in January 2005\nErving earned his bachelor's degree in 1986 through the University Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.[49][50][51] After his basketball career ended, he became a businessman, obtaining ownership of a Coca-Cola bottling plant in Philadelphia and doing work as a television analyst. In 1997, he joined the front office of the Orlando Magic as Vice President of RDV Sports and Executive Vice President.[52]\n\n\nErving and former NFL running back Joe Washington fielded a NASCAR Busch Series team from 1998 to 2000,[53] becoming the first ever NASCAR racing team at any level owned completely by minorities. The team had secure sponsorship from Dr Pepper for most of its existence. Erving, a racing fan himself, stated that his foray into NASCAR was an attempt to raise interest in NASCAR among African-Americans.[*citation needed*] He has also served on the Board of Directors of Converse (prior to their 2001 bankruptcy), Darden Restaurants, Saks Incorporated and The Sports Authority. As of 2009, Erving was the owner of *The Celebrity Golf Club International* outside of Atlanta, but the club was forced to file for bankruptcy soon after.[54] He was ranked by ESPN as one of the greatest athletes of the 20th century.\n\n\nIn 1991 he performed the narration in a performance of Copland's Lincoln Portrait with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Riccardo Muti in a concert to honor the 62nd birthday of the late Dr Martin Luther King. The concert was broadcast and is available on YouTube.\n\n\nErving made a cameo appearance in the 1993 movie *Philadelphia* starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, and in the sitcom *Hangin' with Mr. Cooper* in 1995.[55][56] He also made a cameo appearance as himself in \"Lice\", the tenth episode of the ninth season of the comedy series *The Office* (2013).[57] Erving appeared as himself in the 2022 movie *Hustle* starring Adam Sandler and Juancho Hernang\u00f3mez.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n | \u00a0\u00a0GS\u00a0\n | Games

He has spoken about his faith, saying: \"After searching for the meaning of life for over ten years, I found the meaning in Jesus Christ.\"[58] Erving is a second cousin of economist Walter E. Williams.[59] Erving was married to Turquoise Erving from 1972 until 2003. Together they had four children. In 2000, their 19-year-old son Cory went missing for weeks, until he was found drowned after driving his vehicle into a pond.[60]\n\n\n\n![Erving standing next to the statue depicting his likeness at the UMass unveiling ceremony in Amherst, Mass., in September 2021.](image)Erving standing next to the statue depicting his likeness at the UMass unveiling ceremony in Amherst, Mass., in September 2021.\nIn 1979, Erving began an affair with sportswriter Samantha Stevenson, resulting in the 1980 birth of Alexandra Stevenson, who would become a professional tennis player. Although Erving's fatherhood of Alexandra Stevenson was known privately to the families involved, it did not become public knowledge until Stevenson reached the semifinals at Wimbledon in 1999, the first year she qualified to play in the tournament. Erving had provided financial support for Stevenson over the years, but had not otherwise been part of her life. The public disclosure of their relationship did not initially lead to contact between father and daughter; however, Stevenson contacted Erving in 2008 and they finally initiated a further relationship.[61] Erving met Stevenson for the first time on October 31, 2008.[62] In 2009, Erving attended the Family Circle Cup tennis tournament to see Stevenson play, marking the first time he had attended one of her matches.[63]\n\n\nIn 1988, Erving received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[64] In 2003, Erving fathered a second child outside of his marriage, Justin Kangas, with a woman named Dor\u00fds Madden. Julius and Turquoise Erving were subsequently divorced and Erving continued his relationship with Madden, with whom he had three more children, Jules Erving and two others.[61] They married in 2008.[65]\n\n\nOn September 10, 2021, Erving attended an unveiling ceremony at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for statues honoring himself and fellow UMass alumni and Basketball Hall of Fame members John Calipari, Marcus Camby, and Jack Leaman. The ceremony was attended by former teammates, coaches, family, and current players of the UMass men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams.[66]\n\n\n\n## Community art[edit]\n\n\nFile:Dr J Mural.jpgDr. J mural on the corner of Green Street and Ridge Avenue near Spring Garden Street in Philadelphia, PA\nThe Dr. J mural is located on the corner of Green Street and Ridge Avenue near Spring Garden Street in Philadelphia, PA.\n\n\nFrom Mural Arts Philadelphia:[67]  \n\n*\"Feeling restless and desperate to improve the quality and variety of the murals, Jane [Golden] made a decision in 1990 that would forever change Mural Arts Philadelphia. She raised money from private foundation to bring her old friend and mentor Kent Twitchell to Philadelphia. She wanted a \u201cbreakthrough mural,\u201d and Twitchell\u2014a nationally acclaimed California artist\u2014was just the man to paint it. \u201cWe knew we had to push the boundaries,\u201d she said. \"The goal was to try to integrate superior artwork with a subject that touched the community in a special way.\"*\n\n\n*Twitchell was known for his portraits, and he lobbied to paint basketball great Julius Erving in a business suit instead of a uniform to portray him more as a man and role model than simply another well-known athlete. The dignified, full-length portrait is so tall that Erving\u2019s head just fits under the peak of the three-story building. The image was first painted on large squares of parachute cloth, which were then adhered to the wall surface with acrylic gel. The cloth\u2019s smooth surface allowed Twitchell to craft Erving with uncannily realistic detail, from the crease in his tan suit trousers to the gold bracelet on his right hand. Local residents, who maintain a small park in front of the mural, claim that the real Dr. J had tears in his eyes when he saw the completed portrait for the first time. Dr. J is also the only Philadelphia mural so respected that it appears in homage in another mural, the student-painted panorama of urban life on the Spring Garden Street Bridge.*\n\n\n*\"The mural was universally applauded. It showed that murals have the potential to be great. The level of expectation was raised,\u201d Jane said. The mural helped alter public opinion about the program, too. \u201cThe art snobs, people who\u2019d been looking down at our murals, started to change. There was a ripple effect\u2014foundation and grants started to emerge.\"*\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff steals leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career steals leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Julius Erving Biography and Interview\".

Wilkins was a nine-time NBA All-Star, a seven-time All-NBA Team member and is widely viewed as one of the most acrobatic slam dunkers in NBA history, earning the nickname \"**the Human Highlight Reel**\".[1] In October 2021, he was honored as one of the\u00a0league\u2019s greatest players of all-time by being named to the\u00a0NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[2]\n\n\nWilkins led the NBA in scoring in the 1985\u201386 season.[3] In 2006, Wilkins was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n\nIn addition to his 11 seasons with the Hawks, Wilkins had short stints with the Los Angeles Clippers, the Boston Celtics, Panathinaikos Athens (a professional team in Greece's top-tier level Greek Basket League, with whom he won his first titles, the FIBA European League and the Greek Cup), Fortitudo Bologna (a professional team in Italy's top-tier level LBA), the San Antonio Spurs, and the Orlando Magic before he retired in 1999. As a member of the U.S. men's national team, Wilkins won gold at the 1994 FIBA World Championship.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and high school career[edit]\n\n\nWilkins was born in Paris while his father was stationed in France as an officer in the U.S. Army. He has a younger brother, Gerald Wilkins, who also played in the NBA, mainly for the New York Knicks. His family moved to Dallas and Baltimore before settling in Washington, North Carolina, where he attended Washington High School. He was the back-to-back MVP for the team's consecutive Class 3-A State Championships (1978\u20131979). Wilkins was in the \"Faces in the Crowd\" section of *Sports Illustrated* while in high school for a performance in a game vs. a higher classification school in which he scored 48 points, had 27 rebounds, 9 dunks, and 8 blocks. Wilkins then starred in the McDonald's All-American Game, the Capital Classic, the Kentucky Derby Festival Classic, and the Dapper Dan Classic all-star games. He had 16 points and 12 rebounds in the McDonald's game, 26 points in the Capital Classic, and 22 points in the Derby Classic.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nWilkins entered the University of Georgia in 1979 with a reputation as an exciting player and left as the \u201cHuman Highlight Film\u201d. He averaged 21.6 points a game over his Bulldogs career and was named SEC Men's Basketball Player of the Year in 1981.[4][5] Likely to go as one of the very top picks of the 1982 NBA draft, he left college after his junior year.\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Atlanta Hawks (1982\u20131994)[edit]\n\n\nWilkins was selected third overall (behind James Worthy and Terry Cummings) by the Utah Jazz in the 1982 NBA draft. However, Wilkins was not willing to play in Utah; the team wanted him to play power forward, while he wanted to play small forward.[6] At the same time, the Jazz were reeling from cash flow problems. As a result, the Jazz traded Wilkins to the Atlanta Hawks several months after the draft for John Drew, Freeman Williams and $1 million in cash.[7] The trade is now considered among the most lopsided deals in NBA history,[8] as Drew and Williams would play a combined four seasons for the Jazz.\n\n\nWilkins averaged more than 25 points per game for ten consecutive seasons, and captured a scoring title in 1985\u201386 with an average of 30.3 points per game.\n\n\nWilkins was instrumental in the Hawks' prominence in the 1980s, when the club recorded four consecutive 50-win seasons during the decade. As Wilkins entered his thirties and the Hawks needed more of an all-around contribution from their star, Wilkins averaged 9.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists during the 1990\u201391 season.\n\n\nA nine-time NBA All-Star and the winner of two NBA slam dunk contests, Wilkins registered 26,668 points and 7,169 rebounds in his NBA career. As of 2021, he ranks 14th on the NBA scoring list.[9]\n\n\nWilkins's nickname was \"The Human Highlight Film\" for his athletic ability and highlight reel dunks. His trademark dunk was a powerful one- or two-handed windmill dunks he used to capture the slam dunk contest titles in 1985 and 1990. As a basketball player, he was known as an acrobatic scorer, somewhat of a gunner, though an outstanding finisher and one of the greatest dunkers in NBA history.\n\n\nHis #21 jersey was retired by the Hawks on January 13, 2001. He is one of five players whose jerseys have been retired by the Hawks.\n\n\n\n#### Early years (1982\u20131987)[edit]\n\n\nWilkins notched his first Slam-Dunk Championship at the NBA All-Star Weekend in Indianapolis during the 1984\u201385 season. He went on to finish the season with a 27.4 scoring average, good for sixth in the NBA. He ranked second on the Hawks in rebounding (6.9 rpg) and steals (135). For the first of two straight seasons, he led the NBA in field-goal attempts, with 1,891. After going 0-for-11 from the three-point line the previous season, Wilkins made 25 of 81 three-point shots in 1984\u201385. He also shot better than 80 percent from the free throw line for the first of 10 consecutive seasons. Despite Wilkins's efforts, Atlanta finished 34\u201348 and failed to reach the playoffs.\n\n\nWilkins exploded into the NBA's elite circle in 1985\u201386, winning the league scoring title with an average of 30.3 points per game. He was an NBA All-Star for the first time and was voted to the All-NBA First Team at the end of the season. He failed in his bid to repeat as NBA Slam-Dunk champion, his competition coming from an unlikely source. The Hawks had signed 5-foot-7 Anthony \"Spud\" Webb as a free agent prior to the season, and Webb dazzled the All-Star Saturday crowd in Dallas by soaring more than 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) to the basket on each of his dunk attempts. Atlanta turned its fortunes around in dramatic fashion, winning 16 more games in the 1985\u201386 season to finish 50\u201332 for the year. Wilkins scored 57 points in one game and ranked among the Hawks' leaders in rebounding (7.9 rpg), steals (138), and free-throw percentage (.818). Atlanta beat the Detroit Pistons in four games in the first round of the playoffs, but the Hawks could not get past the eventual NBA-champion Boston Celtics, losing four games to one in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Wilkins averaged 28.6 points in the nine playoff games.\n\n\nAfter playing as a reserve the previous year, Wilkins became the first Atlanta Hawks player to start in an NBA All-Star Game since Eddie Johnson in 1981. Wilkins finished the year second in the league in scoring (29.0 ppg) to Michael Jordan's 37.1 points per game. He scored the 10,000th point of his career against the Chicago Bulls on April 16 and was named to the All-NBA Second Team at the season's end. Atlanta went into the season with high expectations after a 50\u201332 mark the previous year, and the Hawks totaled a franchise-record 57 victories. Doc Rivers, Kevin Willis, Tree Rollins, and Mike McGee contributed as the club made it through the first round of the NBA playoffs before losing in the Eastern Conference semifinals to the Detroit Pistons. Wilkins averaged 26.8 points during the postseason, the second of six straight playoffs in which he would average at least 20 points.\n\n\n\n#### Late 80s (1987\u20131990)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1987\u201388 season, Wilkins posted the highest scoring average of his career and finished second to Jordan in the NBA scoring race. He averaged 30.7 points for the Hawks, but Jordan bested him at 35.0. Jordan also defeated Wilkins for the Slam Dunk Championship at the NBA All-Star Weekend in Chicago. Wilkins earned a berth on the All-NBA Second Team and became the first Hawks player to be named NBA Player of the Week three times in a season. In his third straight All-Star Game appearance, Wilkins scored 29 points on 12-of-22 shooting, leading the East squad to a 138\u2013133 victory.\n\n\nAtlanta (50\u201332) won at least 50 games for the third straight season and advanced to the 1988 Eastern Conference Semifinals before losing to the Boston Celtics in seven games. In Game 7 on May 22, Wilkins and Larry Bird carried their respective teams to a thrilling finish, trading bucket for bucket in the fourth quarter until Boston won with a 118\u2013116 victory. Wilkins finished with 47 points and Bird had 34-with 20 of his points tallied in the fourth quarter. \"The basket was like a well,\" remembered Wilkins. \"I couldn't miss. He couldn't miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I've ever played in or seen played. It was two guys who just did not want to lose.\"\n\n\nDuring the 1989 season with the Hawks, Wilkins's scoring average dropped slightly to 26.2, good for seventh in the league, but he was an All-Star for the fourth straight year. He shot a career-best .844 from the free-throw line and ranked second on the Hawks with 117 steals. Basketball writers selected him to the All-NBA Third Team at season's end. The Hawks added Reggie Theus and Moses Malone to the team in 1988\u201389. Malone averaged 20.2 points and finished fourth in the league with his 11.8 rebounding average. Theus averaged 15.8 points. Without 7-foot (2.1\u00a0m) Kevin Willis, however, who missed the entire season with a fractured left foot, Atlanta lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round. Wilkins averaged 27.2 points in the playoffs.\n\n\nWilkins returned to dunking prominence in 1989\u201390 by edging out the Sacramento Kings' Kenny Smith for his second NBA Slam-Dunk championship. He averaged 26.7 points to finish fifth in the NBA scoring race. He led the Hawks in steals for the first time since 1985\u201386, finishing with 126. His .484 field-goal percentage was the best since his rookie season, and for the sixth straight year he did not foul out of a game. Nonetheless, Atlanta struggled to a 41\u201341 record in Mike Fratello's last season as head coach, failing to make the playoffs for only the second time in Wilkins's career.\n\n\n\n#### Final years in Atlanta (1990\u20131994)[edit]\n\n\nWilkins averaged a career-high 9.0 rebounds in 1990\u201391, leading the Hawks in that category for the first time in his nine NBA seasons. He also led the team in scoring for the eighth straight year, finishing at 25.9 points per game\u2014seventh best in the NBA. He registered a career-high 265 assists while developing a three-point shot he would use more and more in the later stages of his career. He hit 85-of-249 from long range for a .341 percentage, by far his most prolific three-point numbers to date. Wilkins made his sixth All-Star Game appearance, scoring 12 points in the East's 116\u2013114 victory over the West. He was selected to the All-NBA Second Team for the third time in his career. Atlanta returned to the playoffs after a year's absence, drawing the defending NBA champion Detroit Pistons in the first round. The Hawks pushed the Pistons to a fifth game, but Detroit routed Atlanta, 113\u201381, in Game 5. Wilkins averaged 20.8 points in the five games, but shot .372 from the field and .133 from three-point range.\n\n\nIn the 1991\u201392 season, Wilkins's ruptured his Achilles tendon against the Philadelphia 76ers on January 28, 1992. He underwent surgery on January 30. He also scored the 20,000th point of his career, becoming only the 16th player at the time to reach that plateau. On the day of the injury, Wilkins was named a reserve on the Eastern Conference All-Star Team. His 28.1 scoring average was his highest in five years, and the 52 points he scored in a double-overtime game on December 7 against the New York Knicks were the most by an NBA player that season.\n\n\nThe following season, Wilkins recovered from his injury.[10] He scored an average of 27.7 points per game in the first month of the season. On December 8, he set an NBA record of free throws made in a game without a miss, hitting 23 free throws against the Chicago Bulls. He then suffered a setback when he fractured the ring finger on his right hand on December 15, sitting out the next 11 games. He returned to rack up 29.4 points per game on .487 shooting in January, then added 31.5 points per game on .519 shooting in February. By the end of the season, his scoring average was up to 29.9, second in the league behind Michael Jordan's 32.6. When Wilkins scored his 31st point in a February 2 game against the Seattle SuperSonics, he broke Bob Pettit's franchise scoring record of 20,880 points. He had developed into a full-fledged three-point threat, hitting 120 of 316 attempts from long range to shatter his previous career bests. He was later selected to the All-NBA Second Team. The Chicago Bulls swept the Hawks in the first round of the playoffs 3\u20130.\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Clippers (1994)[edit]\n\n\nWilkins showed no signs of fading in his 12th NBA season, even after a tumultuous midseason trade. After 11\u00bd years with the Atlanta Hawks, Wilkins was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers on February 24 in exchange for Danny Manning. This is still the only time in NBA history a team in first place in their conference traded its leading scorer after the All-Star break. Prior to the trade Wilkins averaged 24.4 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 2.3 assists for Atlanta, leading the club to a 36\u201316 record. At midseason he appeared in his eighth NBA All-Star Game. Hawks management and new coach Lenny Wilkens claimed Manning and his skills would help the team more during the stretch run. However, many[*who?*] believed that money was the primary reason the Hawks made the trade. Wilkins's contract expired at the end of the season, and the Hawks may not have been willing to commit a new long-term contract to a player who was almost 35 years old.\n\n\nThe top-seeded Hawks lost in the conference semifinals to the Indiana Pacers. Wilkins left Atlanta as the team's all-time leading scorer with 23,292 points. In his final 25 games of the season Wilkins averaged 29.1 points and 7.0 rebounds. On March 25 he returned to Atlanta in a Clippers uniform and tallied 36 points and 10 rebounds against his former team. Overall, Wilkins's 26.0 scoring average ranked fourth in the NBA. He concluded the season with 24,019 career points, placing ninth on the NBA's all-time list.\n\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (1994\u20131995)[edit]\n\n\nWilkins became a free agent after the 1993\u201394 season and signed with the Boston Celtics. Shortly after the signing, he helped Dream Team II to a gold medal at the 1994 World Championship of Basketball. In his lone season with the Celtics, the team reached the playoffs but was eliminated in the first round by the Orlando Magic. Wilkins averaged 19.0 points for the series. He also holds the honor of scoring the Celtics final point at the old Boston Garden, before it closed in 1995, in their game four loss to the Magic.\n\n\n\n### Panathinaikos (1995\u20131996)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wilkins with Panathinaikos in 1996\nIn August 1995, Pavlos and Thanassis Giannakopoulos, presidents of Panathinaikos, asked \"who is the best player worldwide right now\", Dominique Wilkins was the answer and after that the well known phrase of Pavlos Giannakopoulos stayed in European Basketball history \"Bring him yesterday, not now, yesterday\". Dominique Wilkins joined Panathinaikos of the Greek League, signing a two-year contract worth US$7 million that meant a US$3.5 million net sum per year in salary, at the time the richest deal for a professional basketball player outside the NBA.[11][12][13][14] Despite Wilkins having two more years remaining on his contract with the Celtics, the Athens club, hungry for Euroleague success, stepped in by taking advantage of the said contract having a buyout clause.[11] Arriving in Athens on 1 September 1995, Wilkins was greeted by 5,000 Panathinaikos fans at Ellinikon International Airport.[15][16] The next day, 13,000 fans showed up for his first practice session.[16] His club-provided accommodation in the city included a four-story, marbled villa of his choosing, a maid, two cars, while even his Greek taxes were paid for him by the club.[17]\n\n\nPlaying on a roster alongside Stojko Vrankovi\u0107, Panagiotis Giannakis, Fragiskos Alvertis and Nikos Oikonomou, thirty-five-year-old Wilkins started off the season sluggishly, frequently getting targeted by the team's disciplinarian, defensively-minded head coach Bo\u017eidar Maljkovi\u0107, even getting fined US$50,000 by the club for making too many personal trips back to the United States during the season, and complaining about being treated \"like a dog\" by coach Maljkovi\u0107.[18]\n\n\nHowever, Wilkins soon managed to adapt and thrive in the European game, averaging 20.1 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 1.8 assists, in 33.2 minutes per game, in 17 games played for Panathinaikos in the 1995\u201396 season of the EuroLeague,[19] and helping them win the title of the EuroLeague Final Four of 1996. He particularly excelled in key EuroLeague contests such as the deciding game 3 of the EuroLeague quarterfinals best-of-3 series, versus Treviso, where he recorded 26 points and 7 rebounds, as Panathinaikos eked out a hard-fought 64\u201365 victory on the road, to progress to the EuroLeague Final Four. During the 1996 EuroLeague Final Four, that was held in his birthplace of Paris, Wilkins had 35 points and 8 rebounds in the semifinal against CSKA, and a double-double, with 16 points and 10 rebounds against Barcelona in the final. His performances earned him the Final Four MVP award. He also won the Greek Cup with Panathinaikos, and was named the Cup Final MVP.\n\n\nWilkins, however, failed to lead Panathinaikos to the 1995\u201396 Greek League national championship, as they lost the Greek League Finals to their arch-rivals, Olympiacos, 3 games to 2. Controversially, the player did not play in the deciding game 5 of the finals series, claiming injury\u2014an assertion disputed by the team. Panathinaikos ended up losing the deciding game by a wide margin. On 19 June 1996, following the disappointing end of the Greek League season, Wilkins and his agent were reportedly notified by the club that the player's contract would be terminated early, after only one season.[20] On 27 June 1996, three days before the team would have had to pay a $1.75-million advance on his 1996-97 salary of $3.5 million, Wilkins and his agent Steve A. Kauffman had a lawsuit filed against them by Panathinaikos in a Massachusetts court, asking that Wilkins and his agent be barred from access to US$4 million in letters of credit granted earlier as part of the deal Wilkins had signed with the club the previous summer.[20] The suit further cites four examples of Wilkins leaving the team without permission to attend to injuries or personal matters, including the one three days before the fifth and decisive game of the Greek Basketball Championships described in the lawsuit as \"Wilkins deserting the team and creating confusion on the part of his teammates\".[20] In the Greek League, he averaged 21.0 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 1.7 assists and 32.0 minutes per game in 30 games played.[21]\n\n\n\n### San Antonio Spurs (1996\u20131997)[edit]\n\n\nWilkins returned to the NBA before the 1996\u201397 season, signing a contract as a free agent with the San Antonio Spurs, to solidify their bench scoring. Wilkins led the team with an average of 18.2 points per game in 1996\u201397. He would be the last Spur to wear #21 before Tim Duncan.\n\n\n\n### Fortitudo Bologna (1997\u20131998)[edit]\n\n\nHowever, after one season, Wilkins once again went overseas, this time signing a contract with Teamsystem Bologna of the Italian League, for the 1997\u201398 season. With Bologna, he averaged 17.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 1.7 assists, in 33.5 minutes per game, in 34 games played in the Italian League.[22] With Bologna, he also averaged 17.9 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 1.7 assists, in 33.8 minutes per game, in 20 games played in the FIBA EuroLeague 1997\u201398 season.[23]\n\n\n\n### Orlando Magic (1999)[edit]\n\n\nWilkins returned to play his last season in the NBA, during the 1998\u201399 campaign, alongside his brother Gerald Wilkins, with the Orlando Magic. In 27 games, he averaged 5.0 points per game and 2.6 rebounds per game.\n\n\n\n### Slam dunk contests[edit]\n\n\nWilkins participated in five slam dunk contests, winning two. His first was in 1984, in Denver. Wilkins finished third, behind Larry Nance and Julius Erving. In 1985, in Indianapolis, he beat Michael Jordan in the finals. In Dallas in 1986, a Jordan-Wilkins rematch was put on hold, since Jordan was injured. Wilkins reached the finals where he was defeated by his 5'6\" teammate, Spud Webb.\n\n\nThe 1988 Slam Dunk Contest featured a rematch between Wilkins and Jordan. Jordan won in the final, beating Wilkins by two points. Wilkins's first two dunks of the finals earned scores of 50 from judges. On his third and final attempt, Wilkins's completed a thunderous windmill dunk from the left side. Soaring high above the floor, Wilkins's head nearly hit the rim. Wilkins received a standing ovation from players and fans in attendance, but was awarded a low score of 45. The judges opened the door for Jordan to win the Chicago-based event with a score of only 48. Jordan closed out the event with 50-point dunk, taking perhaps the contest's most controversial crown.\n\n\nIn 1990 Wilkins made his final appearance in the Slam Dunk Contest, going up against new promising stars such as Kenny Smith, Scottie Pippen and Kenny Walker (the 1989 champion). He defeated Kenny Smith of the Sacramento Kings in the final round.\n\n\n\n## Post-playing career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wilkins, who has a family history of diabetes, met with New York congressman Vito Fossella in 2008 to discuss the escalating crisis of the disease in the United States\nSince 2004, Wilkins has served as the Hawks' Vice President of Basketball. He works in a variety of management functions within the franchise's basketball and business areas. Wilkins is responsible for advising the Hawks's senior management team on basketball-related issues and is a goodwill ambassador for the community.[24] Wilkins also serves as a color analyst for Hawks games on Bally Sports, pairing with long-time play-by-play announcer Bob Rathbun.\n\n\nWilkins was a judge in the 2008 NHL All-Star Game Breakaway Challenge, which was held in Atlanta.[25]\n\n\nIn 2009 Wilkins participated in the McDonald's All-Star Celebrity Game during NBA All-Star Weekend[26] and in the 2009 NBA Asia Challenge against a team of Philippine Basketball Association All-Stars. He led all scorers with 28 points in 20 minutes of play.[27]\n\n\nIn 2010 Wilkins signed an agreement to partner with fitness company 24 Hour Fitness to develop the Dominique Wilkins Basketball Academy. The academy conducted private training, camps, and clinics at the 24 Hour facility in Pearl City, Hawaii. In late 2010, Wilkins starred with Verne Troyer in the TitleMax \"short on cash?\" television commercial campaign.\n\n\nAccording to ESPN, Wilkins was attacked by former NBA referee Rashan Michel after a 2011 Hawks\u2013Magic game at Philips Arena in Atlanta. Michel claimed that Wilkins owed him money for a suit provided to Wilkins. Afterward, according to the police, Michel attacked Wilkins by punching him in the chest.[28]\n\n\nRecently Wilkins released the first of his private label wines under the Wilkins Private Reserve label. He took an interest in fine wines while playing professionally in Italy at the end of his career and owning a private label was one of his long-term goals.[29]\n\n\nIn March 2014 Wilkins, whose father and grandfather both died of diabetic complications, filmed a commercial for Novo Nordisk's Victoza citing their commitment to raising awareness of diabetes in the urban community, with an emphasis on children's nutrition.[30]\n\n\nOn March 6, 2015, the Atlanta Hawks organization unveiled a statue of Wilkins that sits in front of then-titled Philips Arena, and now State Farm Arena.[31]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nWilkins's stepson, Isaiah Wilkins, played for the University of Virginia and was the 2018 ACC Defensive Player of the Year.[32]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n | \u00a0\u00a0GS\u00a0\n | Games started\n | \u00a0MPG\u00a0\n | Minutes per game\n |\n| \u00a0FG%\u00a0\n | Field goal percentage\n | \u00a03P%\u00a0\n | 3-point field goal percentage\n | \u00a0FT%\u00a0\n | Free throw percentage\n |\n| \u00a0RPG\u00a0\n | Rebounds per game\n | \u00a0APG\u00a0\n | Assists per game\n | \u00a0SPG\u00a0\n | Steals per game\n |\n| \u00a0BPG\u00a0\n | Blocks per game\n | \u00a0PPG\u00a0\n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n| \u00a0\\*\u00a0\n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### NBA[edit]\n\n\n#### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1982\u201383 | Atlanta | **82**\\* | **82**\\* | 32.9 | **.493** | .182 | .682 | 5.8 | 1.6 | 1.0 | .8 | 17.5\n |\n| 1983\u201384 | Atlanta | 81 | 81 | 36.6 | .479 | .000 | .770 | 7.2 | 1.6 | 1.4 | **1.1** | 21.6\n |\n| 1984\u201385 | Atlanta | 81 | 81 | 37.3 | .451 | .309 | .806 | 6.9 | 2.5 | 1.7 | .7 | 27.4\n |\n| 1985\u201386 | Atlanta | 78 | 78 | **39.1** | .468 | .186 | .818 | 7.8 | 2.6 | **1.8** | .6 | 30.3\\*\n |\n| 1986\u201387 | Atlanta | 79 | 79 | 37.6 | .463 | .292 | .818 | 6.3 | 3.3 | 1.5 | .6 | 29.0\n |\n| 1987\u201388 | Atlanta | 78 | 76 | 37.8 | .464 | .295 | .826 | 6.4 | 2.9 | 1.3 | .6 | **30.7** |\n| 1988\u201389 | Atlanta | 80 | 80 | 37.5 | .464 | .276 | .844 | 6.9 | 2.6 | 1.5 | .7 | 26.2\n |\n| 1989\u201390 | Atlanta | 80 | 79 | 36.1 | .484 | .322 | .807 | 6.5 | 2.5 | 1.6 | .6 | 26.7\n |\n| 1990\u201391 | Atlanta | 81 | 81 | 38.0 | .470 | .341 | .829 | **9.0** | 3.3 | 1.5 | .8 | 25.9\n |\n| 1991\u201392 | Atlanta | 42 | 42 | 38.1 | .464 | .289 | .835 | 7.0 | **3.8** | 1.2 | .6 | 28.1\n |\n| 1992\u201393 | Atlanta | 71 | 70 | 37.3 | .468 | .380 | .828 | 6.8 | 3.2 | 1.0 | .4 | 29.9\n |\n| 1993\u201394 | Atlanta | 49 | 49 | 34.4 | .432 | .308 | **.854** | 6.2 | 2.3 | 1.3 | .4 | 24.4\n |\n| 1993\u201394 | L.A.

It was also James's 19th consecutive All-Star appearance, surpassing Bryant's previous mark.[325] On January 31, James put up a triple-double with 28 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 129\u2013123 overtime win over the New York Knicks, becoming the first player in NBA history to put up a triple-double in his 20th season.

Tristan Thompson has stated that James eats desserts with every meal, and Kyle Korver says James's fitness routine is unrivaled.[451] James drinks wine every night, believing that it is good for his heart.[452] In January 2009, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic discovered a growth in the right side of James's jaw.

He played one season of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns and was selected as the second overall pick by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 2007 NBA draft. He played nine seasons with the franchise, which became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008, before signing with the Golden State Warriors in 2016, winning consecutive NBA championships and NBA Finals MVP Awards in 2017 and 2018. After sustaining an Achilles injury in the 2019 finals, he joined the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent that summer. Following disagreements with the Nets' front office, he requested a trade during the 2022 offseason and was traded to the Suns in 2023. He is regarded as one of the greatest players in NBA history.[1][2][3]\n\n\nDurant was a heavily recruited high school prospect who was widely regarded as the second-best player in his class. In college, he won numerous year-end awards and became the first freshman to be named Naismith College Player of the Year. As a professional, he has won two NBA championships, an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, two Finals MVP Awards, two NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Awards, four NBA scoring titles, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, been named to ten All-NBA teams (including six First Teams), and selected 13 times as an NBA All-Star. In 2021, Durant was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[4] As a member of the U.S. men's national team, Durant has won three gold medals in the Olympics (2012, 2016, and 2020) and is the leading scorer in Team USA's men's Olympic basketball history. He also won gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship.\n\n\nOff the court, Durant is one of the highest-earning basketball players in the world, due in part to endorsement deals with companies such as Foot Locker and Nike. He has developed a reputation for philanthropy and regularly leads the league in All-Star votes and jersey sales. In recent years, he has contributed to *The Players' Tribune* as both a photographer and writer. In 2012, he ventured into acting, appearing in the film *Thunderstruck*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDurant was born on September 29, 1988, in Washington, D.C.,[5] to Wanda (*n\u00e9e* Durant) and Wayne Pratt. When Durant was an infant, his father deserted the family; Wanda and Wayne eventually divorced, and Durant's grandmother Barbara Davis helped raise him. By age 13, his father reentered his life and traveled the country with him to basketball tournaments.[6][7] Durant has a sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne.[8]\n\n\nDurant and his siblings grew up in Prince George's County, Maryland, on the eastern outskirts of Washington, D.C.[9] He was unusually tall from a young age, and reached 6\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in (1.83\u00a0m) in height while still in middle school (age 10\u201312).[10] Growing up, Durant wanted to play for his favorite team, the Toronto Raptors,[11] which included his favorite player, Vince Carter.[11] He played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for several teams in the Maryland area and was teammates with future NBA players Michael Beasley, Greivis V\u00e1squez, and Ty Lawson, the first of whom Durant remains friends with to this day.[12]\n[13] During this time, he began wearing #35 as his jersey number in honor of his AAU coach, Charles Craig, who was murdered at the age of 35.[14]\n\n\nAfter playing two years of high school basketball at National Christian Academy and one year at Oak Hill Academy, Durant transferred to Montrose Christian School for his senior year, growing 5 inches (13\u00a0cm) before the start of the season and beginning the year at 6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in (2.01\u00a0m).[15]\n\n\nPrior to the start of the season, he committed to the University of Texas at Austin.[16] He had visited University of Connecticut and University of North Carolina, and said he considered Duke University, University of Kentucky and University of Louisville. When asked why he chose a college with a lesser-known program, he said, \"Wanted to set my own path.\"\n\n\nAt the end of the year, he was named the Washington Post All-Met Basketball Player of the Year, as well as the Most Valuable Player of the 2006 McDonald's All-American Game.[17][18] He was widely regarded as the second-best high school prospect of 2006, behind Greg Oden.[19][20][21]\n\n\nDurant had stated that he would have declared for the 2006 NBA draft if the NBA had not introduced the one-and-done rule, where his favorite team growing up, the Toronto Raptors, had the first overall pick.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant with the Texas Longhorns in 2007\nFor the 2006\u201307 college season, Durant\u2014who had grown to 6\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in (2.06\u00a0m)\u2014averaged 25.8 points, 11.1 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game for the Texas Longhorns.[5] Texas finished the season with a 25\u201310 record overall and a 12\u20134 record in conference.[24] Awarded a 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament, Texas won its first round match-up against New Mexico State but was upset in the second round by USC despite a 30-point and 9-rebound performance from Durant.[25] For his outstanding play, Durant was recognized as the unanimous national player of the year, winning the John R. Wooden Award,[26] the Naismith College Player of the Year Award,[27] and all eight other widely recognized honors and awards.[28][29][30][31][32][33] This made Durant the first freshman to win any of the national player of the year awards.[34] Following the season, he declared for the NBA draft.[35] His No. 35 jersey was later retired by the Longhorns.[36]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Seattle SuperSonics / Oklahoma City Thunder (2007\u20132016)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year (2007\u20132008)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant with the Sonics in 2008\nDurant was selected as the second overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics, after Greg Oden was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the first pick of the draft.[37] In his first regular season game, the 19-year-old Durant registered 18 points, five rebounds and three steals against the Denver Nuggets.[38] On November 16, he made the first game-winning shot of his career in a game against the Atlanta Hawks.[39] At the conclusion of the 2007\u201308 NBA season, he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year following averages of 20.3 points, 4.4 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game.[5] He joined Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James as the only teenagers in league history to average at least 20 points per game over an entire season.[40]\n\n\n\n#### Breakthrough (2008\u20132010)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing Durant's debut season, the SuperSonics relocated from Seattle to Oklahoma City, becoming the Thunder and switching to new colors \u2013 blue, orange, and yellow.[41] The team also drafted UCLA guard Russell Westbrook, who would form an All-Star combination with Durant in later years.[42] At the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend, Durant set a Rookie Challenge record with 46 points.[43] By the conclusion of the 2008\u201309 NBA season, he had raised his scoring average by five points from the prior season to 25.3 points per game,[5] and was considered a strong candidate for the Most Improved Player Award, eventually finishing third in the voting.[44] Durant continued to grow during his first few years in the NBA, finally reaching a height of 6\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in (2.11\u00a0m).[45]\n\n\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, Durant was selected to his first NBA All-Star Game.[5] Behind his play, the Thunder improved their record by 27 wins from the previous year and defied expectations to make the playoffs.[46][47] With a scoring average of 30.1 points per game, Durant became the youngest NBA scoring champion and was selected to his first All-NBA team.[5][48] In his playoff debut, he scored 24 points in a Game 1 loss against the Los Angeles Lakers.[49] Oklahoma City would go on to lose the series in six games,[50] but the team's performance led many analysts to label them as an upcoming title contender.[51]\n\n\n\n#### First NBA finals (2010\u20132012)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant scores on a slam dunk in March 2011 as a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nPrior to the start of the 2010\u201311 season, Durant announced via Twitter that he had signed a five-year contract extension with the Thunder worth approximately $86\u00a0million.[52][53] For the second consecutive year, he led the NBA in scoring, averaging 27.7 points a game.[54] Behind Durant's leadership, the Thunder won 55 games and earned the fourth seed in the Western Conference.[55] In the 2011 NBA playoffs, Oklahoma City defeated the Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies en route to a Conference Finals match-up versus the Dallas Mavericks, losing in five games.[56]\n\n\nOn February 19 of the lockout-shortened 2011\u201312 season, Durant recorded his first career 50-point game, scoring 51 points against the Denver Nuggets.[57][58] At the All-Star Game, he scored 36 points and was awarded the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award.[59] Durant finished the year with a scoring average of 28 points per game, representing his third straight scoring title.[60] Behind his play, the Thunder won 47 games and entered the 2012 NBA playoffs as the Western Conference's second seed.[61] In game 1 of the first round against the Dallas Mavericks, Durant hit a game-winner with 1.5 seconds remaining.[62] Oklahoma City would go on to defeat Dallas, the Lakers, and the San Antonio Spurs before losing to the Miami Heat in the 2012 NBA Finals.[63] For the NBA Finals, Durant led all players with 30.6 points per game, doing so on a 54.8 shooting rate.[64]\n\n\n\n#### 50\u201340\u201390 season (2012\u20132013)[edit]\n\n\nWith a scoring average of 28.1 points per game to finish the 2012\u201313 season, Durant failed to defend his scoring title; however, with a 51 percent shooting rate, a 41.6 percent three point shooting rate, and a 90.5 free throw shooting rate, he became the youngest player in NBA history to join the 50\u201340\u201390 club.[5][65] Finishing the year with a 60\u201322 record, Oklahoma City earned the first seed in the Western Conference.[66] In the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs against the Houston Rockets, Westbrook tore his meniscus, forcing him to miss the remainder of the postseason.[67][68] Without Westbrook, Durant was given more responsibility,[69] averaging a career-high 30.8 points per game throughout the playoffs,[5] but Oklahoma City were eventually eliminated in the second round by the Memphis Grizzlies in five games.[67]\n\n\n\n#### MVP season (2013\u20132014)[edit]\n\n\nIn January of the 2013\u201314 season, Durant averaged 35.9 points per game while scoring 30 or more points in 12 straight games, including a career-high 54 points against the Golden State Warriors.[70][71] In April, he surpassed Michael Jordan's record for consecutive games scoring 25 points or more at 41.[72] The Thunder finished the year with 59 wins and Durant was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player behind averages of 32 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game.[73] To begin the first round of the 2014 NBA playoffs, he struggled against the physical play of the Grizzlies, converting on only 24 percent of his field goals in game 4.[74] Through five games, the Thunder trailed the series 3\u20132, prompting *The Oklahoman* to dub Durant \"Mr. Unreliable\".[75] He responded by scoring 36 points in a Game 6 victory.[76] Oklahoma City eventually eliminated Memphis and the Los Angeles Clippers before losing to the Spurs in the Conference Finals in six games.[77]\n\n\n\n#### Final seasons with the Thunder (2014\u20132016)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant guards LeBron James in January 2015.\nPrior to the start of the 2014\u201315 season, Durant was diagnosed with a Jones fracture in his right foot and was ruled out for six to eight weeks.[78] He subsequently missed the first 17 games of the year, making his season debut for the Thunder on December 2 against the New Orleans Pelicans.[79] On December 18, he injured his ankle against the Golden State Warriors,[80] returning to action on December 31 against the Phoenix Suns to score a season-high 44 points.[81] He then sprained his left big toe in late January.[82] On February 22, he was sidelined again after undergoing a minor procedure to help reduce pain and discomfort in his surgically repaired right foot,[83] and on March 27, he was officially ruled out for the rest of the season after deciding to undergo foot surgery.[84] In just 27 games, he averaged 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game.[5]\n\n\nTo begin the 2015\u201316 season, Durant and Westbrook reached several historical milestones together, including becoming the first pair of teammates to each score at least 40 points in a single game since 1996, doing so in a win over the Orlando Magic on October 30.[85][86][87] For the year, Durant averaged 28.2 points, 8.2 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1.2 blocks per game,[5] leading the Thunder to 55 wins and the third seed in the West.[88] In game 2 of the first round of the 2016 NBA playoffs against the Mavericks, he scored 21 points but converted only 7 out of 33 shots in the worst postseason shooting performance, both by percentage and number of misses, of his career.[89] After defeating Dallas, Oklahoma City moved on to face the Spurs in the second round, falling behind 2\u20131 to start the series.[88] In game 4, Durant tied his playoff career high with 41 points in a Thunder win.[90] Oklahoma City eventually defeated the Spurs in six games, drawing a matchup with the record-setting 73-win Golden State Warriors in the Conference Finals.[88] Despite going up 3\u20131, the Thunder were ousted in seven games, with Durant providing 27 points in game 7.[91]\n\n\n\n### Golden State Warriors (2016\u20132019)[edit]\n\n\n#### First championship and finals MVP (2016\u20132017)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 4, Durant announced his intentions to sign with the Warriors in *The Players' Tribune*.[92][93][94] The move was received negatively by fans and pundits,[95][96] who felt that he took the easy route by leaving a team that had been up 3\u20131 and close to reaching the Finals to instead join their opponents, who had defeated them and were coming off a record-setting 73-win season; the Warriors had also won a championship the year before.[96][97][98] On July 7, Durant officially signed with Golden State on a two-year, $54.3 million contract with a player option after the first year.[99][100][101] Reflecting on the move for *Sports Illustrated*, Ben Golliver wrote, \"He chose an ideal roster fit and a shot at playing for the highest-scoring offense the NBA has seen in decades. He chose life alongside Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, the greatest shooting backcourt in history, and he chose to go against Andre Iguodala and Draymond Green, two elite defenders, in practices rather than in Western Conference finals games.\"[98]\n\n![](image)Durant after Warriors' practice in 2017\nDurant made his debut for the Warriors on October 25 against the San Antonio Spurs, scoring a team-high 27 points in a blowout loss.[102] On November 26, he recorded 28 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, and a career-high six blocked shots in a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, becoming the first player in team history to finish with at least 25 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, and five blocks in a single game.[103] On February 11, in his first game back in Oklahoma City since leaving for Golden State, Durant scored 34 points while being booed throughout the night as he helped the Warriors defeat the Thunder for the third time that year.[104] In March, Durant suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain and a tibial bone bruise, which forced him to miss the final 19 games of the season.[105][106] Golden State finished the year with a 67\u201315 record and entered the playoffs as the first seed.[107]\n\n\nDurant returned from injury in time for the 2017 NBA playoffs and helped the Warriors advance to their third consecutive Finals, while also becoming the first team in league history to start the postseason 12\u20130.[108] In game 1 of the series, Durant had 38 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists to lead the Warriors past LeBron James and the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers.[109] Durant then helped the Warriors go up 3\u20130 in the series with a 31-point effort in game 3, including the go-ahead 3-pointer with 45.3 seconds left in regulation.[110] In game 5, he scored 39 points to go with seven rebounds and five assists in a series-clinching win.[111] For the Finals, Durant was the Golden State's top scorer in every game, averaging 35.2 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 5.4 assists while shooting 55.5 percent from the field, 47.4 percent from three-point range, and 92.7 percent from the free throw line. He was subsequently named the NBA Finals MVP.[112][113]\n\n\n\n#### Second championship and finals MVP (2017\u20132018)[edit]\n\n\nAfter the finals, Durant declined his $27.7 million player option and became an unrestricted free agent.[114] On July 25, he re-signed with the Warriors for less money than the maximum, which helped the franchise create enough salary cap space to keep their core roster intact and add free agents.[115][116] On January 10 of the 2017\u201318 season, Durant scored 40 points in a loss to the Clippers, becoming the second-youngest player in league history to reach the 20,000-point milestone.[117] On January 23, he registered a career-high 14 assists in a win over the New York Knicks.[118] On February 14, he scored a season-high 50 points in a loss to the Trail Blazers.[119] In March, he missed games with a fractured rib, joining teammates Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson on the sidelines for the back-end of the season.[120] Golden State eventually finished the year with 58 wins and Durant set a career high for blocks in season with 119.[121]\n\n\nIn game 1 of the Western Conference Finals, Durant scored 37 points in a win over the higher-seeded Houston Rockets.[122] Through six games, the Warriors found themselves trailing 3\u20132, and Durant was criticized for contributing to Golden State's struggles by playing too much in isolation.[123] The Warriors staved off elimination in game 6, and in game 7 Durant scored 34 points, helping Golden State return to the Finals with a series-clinching victory.[124] In game 3 of the 2018 NBA Finals, Durant recorded a playoff career-high 43 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists in a win over the Cavaliers, leading the Warriors to a 3\u20130 advantage.[125][126] Golden State ultimately swept Cleveland and clinched a second straight championship; with averages of 28.8 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 7.5 assists, Durant also won his second Finals MVP Award.[127]\n\n\n\n#### Three-peat chase and injury (2018\u20132019)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant in 2019 during his third and final season with the Warriors\nOn July 7, 2018, Durant re-signed with the Warriors,[128] on a reported two-year, $61.5 million contract, which included a player option for the second year.[129] During an overtime loss to the Clippers on November 12, 2018, Green cursed out Durant over his upcoming free agency status after the season, and he was suspended for the much-publicized blowup.[130][131] On November 29, Durant scored a season-high 51 points in a 131\u2013128 overtime loss to the Toronto Raptors, thus scoring 40 or more in his third straight game.[132] With Curry and Green sidelined for most of November, the Warriors finished the month with a 15\u20138 record and five straight road losses,[132] after starting the season at 10\u20131.[133]\n\n\nIn game 5 of the first round of the playoffs, he scored a playoff career-high 45 points in a 129\u2013121 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.[134] In game 6, he set a new playoff career high with 50 points in a 129\u2013110 win to close out the series.[135] During Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Houston Rockets, Durant suffered a right calf strain,[136] subsequently missing Game 6, in which the Warriors won the series, as well as the entire Western Conference Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers, which the Warriors won in a four-game sweep.[137]\n\n\nAfter missing nine games with the strained right calf,[138] Durant returned to action in game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals against Toronto, and scored 11 points in the first quarter.[139] However, he was lost for the game two minutes into the second quarter when he tried to drive by former teammate Serge Ibaka and suffered an Achilles tendon injury, falling and grabbing his lower right calf. He limped off the court and was helped to the locker room. The Warriors won the game to cut the Raptors' series lead to 3\u20132.[139] The Warriors went on to lose the NBA Finals in game 6, ending their quest for a three-peat.[140]\n\n\n\n### Brooklyn Nets (2019\u20132023)[edit]\n\n\n#### Year absence (2019\u20132020)[edit]\n\n\nOn June 30, 2019, Durant announced that he planned to sign with the Brooklyn Nets after the July moratorium ended on July 6.[141] On July 1, Golden State CEO Joe Lacob announced that Durant's No. 35 will no longer be issued by the Warriors.[142] Durant signed with Brooklyn on July 7, in a sign-and-trade deal.[143] Durant did not appear at all in the 2019\u201320 season and later revealed that he had decided shortly after his June 2019 injury that he would be sitting out the entire 2019\u201320 season.[144] On March 17, 2020, Durant and three other Nets players tested positive for COVID-19.[145] On April 1, it was announced that Durant was cleared and had recovered.[146]\n\n\n\n#### Return to the court (2020\u20132021)[edit]\n\n\nOn December 22, 2020, Durant made his Nets debut, putting up 22 points, five rebounds, three assists and three steals, in a 125\u201399 win over the Golden State Warriors.[147][148] On January 14, 2021, James Harden was traded to the Nets in a blockbuster four-team deal, reuniting Durant with his former Thunder teammate.[149] On January 16, 2021, Durant scored a season-high 42 points in a 122\u2013115 win over the Orlando Magic.[150] On February 5, due to health and safety protocols, Durant came off the bench for the first time in his career in a 117\u2013123 loss to the Toronto Raptors.[151] In February, Durant suffered a hamstring injury, which forced him to miss 23 games.

He was 8 of 10 from the floor, going 3 of 3 on 3-pointers and 7 of 7 from the free-throw line as he outscored the Pistons 26\u201325 in the third. Durant has scored at least 40 points in his last three games against Detroit - the first player to do that since Rick Barry in the 1966\u201367 season. He also passed John Havlicek and Paul Pierce for 16th place on the NBA all-time career scoring list.[191][192] On December 26, Durant put up 32 points, nine rebounds, and five assists in a 125\u2013117 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers and moved past Tim Duncan for 15th on the NBA all-time career scoring list.[193] The next game, Durant had 26 points, a season-high 16 rebounds and 8 assists, and the Brooklyn Nets won their 10th straight game, 108\u2013107 over the Atlanta Hawks.[194] On January 3, despite Durant's 44-point outing on 15-of-22 shooting, 5-of-10 from three and 9-of-9 from the free throw line Chicago Bulls ended Brooklyn's 12-game winning streak.[195] On January 8, Durant passed Dominique Wilkins for No. 14 on the NBA all-time career scoring list, though he ultimately exited the game against Miami with a right knee injury.

J. Warren, to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson, Jae Crowder, four unprotected first-round picks, and a 2028 first-round pick swap.[198] Although Durant wanted to continue wearing No. 7 as he did in Brooklyn, the number was retired by the Suns in honor of Kevin Johnson. As a result, Durant announced that he would return to wearing the No. 35 jersey, which he had worn throughout his college and professional career prior to joining the Nets.[199]\n\n\nAfter being listed out since January 8 with a right knee injury, Durant made his Suns debut on March 1 against the Charlotte Hornets.[200] He put up 23 points on 10-of-15 shooting in 27 minutes, contributing to the Suns' 105\u201391 win.[201] On March 3 against the Chicago Bulls, Durant had another efficient night, scoring 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting.

He was ruled out roughly 15 minutes before the opening tip-off.[205] A day later, the Suns announced that Durant had suffered a left ankle sprain and would be re-evaluated in three weeks.[206] After missing the last 10 games, he made his return on March 29 against the Minnesota Timberwolves. In his home debut, Durant put up 16 points and eight rebounds in 29 minutes, contributing to a 107\u2013100 win.[207][208] In his eight games with Phoenix, Durant finished with an 8\u20130 record, averaging 26.0 points in 33.6 minutes per game and helping the Suns finish fourth in the Western Conference.[209][210] He also finished the regular season shooting over 55% from the field, over 40% from three-point range, and over 90% from the free throw line, becoming the first player in NBA history to achieve those shooting splits in a season.[211]\n\n\nOn April 16, Durant in his Suns playoff debut posted a near triple-double with 27 points, 9 rebounds and a playoff career-high 11 assists in a 115\u2013110 loss against the Los Angeles Clippers.[212] In Game 4 of the Suns' first-round playoff series against the Clippers, Durant logged 31 points, 11 rebounds and six assists in a 129\u2013124 win, to lead the Suns to a 3\u20131 series lead.[213] Four days later in Game 5 against the Clippers, Durant scored 31 points in a 136\u2013130 win to close out the series.[214] In Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Nuggets, Durant passed Karl Malone to climb into seventh place for NBA postseason scoring.[215] Four days later, Durant recorded 39 points, nine rebounds and eight assists in a 121\u2013114 Game 3 win.[216] The Suns eventually lost the series to the eventual NBA champion Nuggets in six games.

In recognition of his performances, Durant was named the 2016 co-USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year, along with Carmelo Anthony, for the second time in his career.[231]\n\n\nDurant committed to playing on the 2020 Olympic team, delayed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[232] He entered the Games ranked second in U.S. men's Olympic basketball history with 311 career points,[233] needing 25 to match Anthony's record of 336.[234][235] Durant broke Anthony's record on July 31 against the Czech Republic.[236] He led Team USA to a gold medal, and FIBA named him the tournament's MVP.[237] Durant's 20.7 points per game set a U.S. Olympic men's single-competition record for points averaged, and he tied Carmelo Anthony for most Olympic gold medals (three). He is also one of just four U.S. male basketball athletes to play in three or more Olympics.[238][239] In recognition of his accomplishments in the tournament, Durant was named 2021 USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year for the third time in his career.[240]\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2021, Durant played with the senior men's United States national team in 31 official games, in major FIBA tournaments, averaging 20.4 points, 5.4 rebounds and 3.1 assists. Overall, he brought home four gold medals as member of the national team: three from Olympic tournaments and one from the 2010 FIBA World Championship.[241] Durant, who has led the US in scoring in all three of his Olympic appearances and at the 2010 FIBA World Championship, owns eight U.S. Olympic men's career records, including the top spot for points (435), points averaged (19.8), field goals made (146) and attempted (276), 3-point field goals made (74) and attempted (148) and free throws made (69) and attempted (80).[242]\n\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant playing in a game between the Drew League and the Goodman League in August 2011\nDurant's height is officially 6\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in (2.11\u00a0m) and his primary position is small forward. In December 2016, Durant stated that his height in shoes was actually 7\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in (2.13\u00a0m) and that he understated his height in order to be listed as a small forward, rather than a power forward.[243] His career averages are 27.3 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 4.3 assists per game.[5] Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,[244][245][246][247] Durant has earned All-NBA honors ten times (2010\u20132014, 2016\u20132019, 2022) and was voted rookie of the year in his debut season.[5] He has also won an MVP Award and finished second in the voting three times, a trend that he has expressed frustration over.[248][249][250][251]\n\n\nDurant is best known for his prodigious scoring ability.[252] From 2010 to 2014, he won four scoring titles, becoming one of only two players to win four scoring titles in a five-year span.[253] Early in his career, his playing style was isolation-driven, but he quickly developed into an excellent off-ball player who was capable of scoring from the outside as well.[254] By 2013, he was shooting at a historically great clip, which helped him become one of only nine members of the 50\u201340\u201390 club.[255] This ability to impact the offense in a variety of ways helped Durant remain effective and improve an already elite offense upon joining the Warriors in 2016.[254] Throughout his career, his height and 7\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (2.24\u00a0m) wingspan have created matchup problems for defenses as he is able to get off a clean shot regardless of the situation.[256][257] Upon beating his man or gaining momentum, he also becomes a strong finisher at the rim; for example, he converted 72.2% of shots in the paint in 2012.[252]\n\n\nEarly in Durant's career, he was criticized for his slim build, defense, and passing.[258] Over time, he grew as a playmaker, increasing his assist numbers every year from 2010 to 2014,[256] though his overall vision still lagged behind the league's best passers'.[254] He also showed defensive improvement, with opponents averaging just .62 points per isolation play against him in 2014, the best success rate for defensive players who faced at least 100 isolations that season.[259] Upon going to Golden State, he developed into a more reliable off-ball defender and rim protector, and in 2018 was considered for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.[260]\n\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant during a flag football game at Oklahoma State University in 2011\nDurant is very close with his mother, Wanda, a relationship that was detailed in the Lifetime movie *The Real MVP: The Wanda Pratt Story*.[261] During his time with the Thunder, Durant described himself as a \"high school kid\" who enjoys playing video games in his spare time.[262] Durant is a Christian who attended Baptist schools.[263][264] He has religious tattoos on his stomach,[265] wrist,[263] and back.[266] He owns several properties in the Oklahoma City area and listed his primary residence, located in the affluent Club Villa neighborhood, for sale for $1.95 million in 2013.[267] That same year, he opened a restaurant, KD's Southern Cuisine, in the Bricktown neighborhood and briefly became engaged to Monica Wright, a WNBA player.[268][269][270] In 2016, he was a credentialed photographer for *The Players' Tribune* at Super Bowl 50.[271][272]\n\n\nDurant was formerly represented by agents Aaron Goodwin and Rob Pelinka.[273][274] He left Pelinka in 2013 and signed with the Roc Nation group, headed by Jay-Z.[274][275] Durant has endorsement deals with Nike, Sprint, Gatorade, Panini, General Electric, and 2K Sports.[276] In 2012, he tried his hand at acting, appearing in the children's film *Thunderstruck*.[277] In 2013, he earned $35 million, making him the fourth-highest-earning basketball player that year.[278] In an interview with *Sports Illustrated*, Durant claimed that, despite his high earnings potential, \"global marketing and all that stuff\" does not interest him.[276]\n\n\nOne of the most popular players in the league, Durant's jersey regularly ranks as one of the NBA's best-selling and he is consistently one of the top All-Star vote-getters.[279][280] Early in his career, he developed a reputation for his kind demeanor; in 2013, Foot Locker released a series of commercials calling him the \"nicest guy in the NBA\",[281] and become a beloved figure in Oklahoma City, known for his \"nice escapades\" toward the Thunder's staff.[282] In 2014, he partnered with KIND snacks and launched StrongAndKind.com to show \"being kind is not a sign of weakness.\"[283] Since joining the Warriors, he has become more outspoken and controversial; for example, he was involved in a Twitter back-and-forth with CJ McCollum in July 2018.[284] Durant has admitted to feeling more genuine in Golden State as opposed to Oklahoma City, where he was \"just trying to please everybody\".[285] He's very active on Twitter,[286] often engaging in chippy comments with fans and members of the media.[287]\n\n\nThroughout his career, Durant has participated in philanthropic causes. In 2013, he pledged $1 million to the American Red Cross for the victims of the 2013 Moore tornado.[288] His generosity inspired the Thunder and Nike to match his donation.[289] He is also a spokesperson for the Washington, D. C. branch of P'Tones Records, a nationwide non-profit after-school music program.[290]\n\n\n\n![](image)Durant speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco in 2017\nIn 2017, Durant became involved with YouTube. In February, he visited YouTube's headquarters for a speaking engagement.[291] On April 7, 2017, he created a YouTube account and soon began to upload live stream vlogs onto it.[292][293] In his first vlog, he detailed, \"I'm so excited because I got off social media. I got off the Instagram, Twitter, all that stuff, just to distance myself a bit. But somebody talked me into getting on the YouTube.\"[293] As of June 2020, Durant's YouTube channel has received over 790,000 subscribers and 38 million video views.[292] On February 13, 2018, *Deadline* reported that Durant, in partnership with producer Brian Grazer's Imagine Television, will create a basketball-themed scripted drama for Apple.[294]\n\n\nIn 2017, Durant and business partner Rich Kleiman founded Thirty Five Ventures.[295][296][297][298] In 2020, Thirty Five Ventures produced *Basketball County*, a documentary about youth basketball in Durant's home county of Prince George's County, Maryland. Durant served as an executive producer and appeared in interviews.[299] Thirty Five Ventures' work *Two Distant Strangers* won the 2021 Academy Award for Short Film (Live Action).[300][301]\n\n\nDurant was included in *Time* magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2018.[302]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2020, Durant became a minority owner of MLS side Philadelphia Union, acquiring a 5% stake with the possibility to add another 5% in the near future.[303]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Durant announced a partnership between his multimedia company Boardroom and the cannabis technology company Weedmaps through which an original content series would be developed and Weedmaps would become an official sponsor of Boardroom.[304][305] Durant said of the partnership: \"I think it's far past time to address the stigmas around cannabis that still exist in the sports world as well as globally. This partnership is going to help us continue to normalize those conversations, as well as create content, events, and a lot more through our Boardroom media network.\"[306]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Durant (through Thirty Five Ventures) was announced as an investor in Just Women's Sports, an American media platform dedicated to women's sports. Durant credited the platform with showing \"fans exactly how good these players are and why they're worth watching.\"[307]\n\n\nOn December 22, 2021, he had signed a deal with Coinbase to serve as a brand ambassador.[308]\n\n\nIn October 2022, Durant joined fellow professional athletes LeBron James, Tom Brady, and Drew Brees as an investor in a professional pickleball team with his business partner, Rich Kleiman, via their Thirty Five Ventures (35V) firm.[309][310]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n | \u00a0\u00a0GS\u00a0\n | Games

Nicknamed \"**the Hick from French Lick**\" and \"**Larry Legend**\", Bird is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time. He is the only person in NBA history to be named Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player, Finals MVP, All-Star MVP, Coach of the Year, and Executive of the Year.[1]\n\n\nGrowing up in French Lick, Indiana, he was a local basketball star. Highly recruited, he initially signed to play college basketball for coach Bob Knight of the Indiana Hoosiers, but Bird dropped out after one month and returned to French Lick and attended a local college. The next year he attended Indiana State University, ultimately playing three years for the Sycamores. Drafted by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft after his second year at Indiana State, Bird elected to stay in college and returned for the 1978\u201379 season. He then led his team to an undefeated regular season. The season finished with a national championship game match-up of Indiana State against Michigan State and featured a highly anticipated match-up of Bird against Michigan State great Magic Johnson, thus beginning a career-long rivalry that the two shared for over a decade. Michigan State won, ending the Sycamores' undefeated streak.\n\n\nBird entered the NBA for the 1979\u201380 season, where he made an immediate impact, starting at power forward and leading the Celtics to a 32-win improvement over the previous season before being eliminated from the playoffs in the conference finals. He played for the Celtics during his entire professional career (13 seasons), leading them to five NBA finals appearances and three NBA championships. He played most of his career with forward Kevin McHale and center Robert Parish, considered by some to be the greatest front court in NBA history.[2] Bird was a 12-time NBA All-Star, won two NBA Finals MVP awards and received the NBA Most Valuable Player Award three consecutive times (1984\u20131986), making him the only forward in league history to do so. Bird was also a member of the gold medal-winning 1992 U.S. Olympic basketball team, known as the \"Dream Team\". He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame twice as a player\u2014first in 1998 as an individual, and again in 2010 as a member of the \"Dream Team\". He was voted onto the NBA's 50 Greatest Players in NBA History list in 1996, and subsequently the 75th Anniversary Team list in 2021.[3]\n\n\nA versatile player at both forward positions, he could play both inside and outside, being one of the first players in the league to take advantage of the newly adopted three-point line. Bird was rated the greatest NBA small forward of all time by Fox Sports in 2016.[4] After retiring as a player, Bird served as head coach of the Indiana Pacers from 1997 to 2000. He was named NBA Coach of the Year for the 1997\u201398 season and later led the Pacers to a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals. In 2003, Bird was named president of basketball operations for the Pacers, holding the position until retiring in 2012.[5] He was named NBA Executive of the Year for the 2012 season. Bird returned to the Pacers as president of basketball operations in 2013,[6] and remained in that role until 2017.[7] Bird continued with the Pacers as an advisor until July 2022, then after nearly a year's break returned to the organization in the role of consultant.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBird was born in West Baden Springs, Indiana, to Georgia (n\u00e9e Kerns) and Claude Joseph \"Joe\" Bird, a veteran of the Korean War.[9] Bird's parents were of Irish, Scottish and some Native American descent.[10] He has four brothers and a sister.[11]\n\n\nHe was raised in nearby French Lick, where his mother worked two jobs to support Larry and his five siblings.[12] Bird has said that being poor as a child still motivates him \"to this day\".[13] Georgia and Joe divorced when Larry was in high school, and Joe died by suicide about a year later.[14]\n\n\nLarry used basketball as an escape from his family troubles, starring for Springs Valley High School and averaging 31 points, 21 rebounds, and 4 assists as a senior on his way to becoming the school's all-time scoring leader.[9][15] According to Bird, he grew up as a huge fan of the Indiana Pacers in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the 6'9 center Mel Daniels, who represented his first exposure to professional basketball.[16] Bird's youngest brother, Eddie Bird, also played basketball at Indiana State University, where Daniels would coincidentally become an assistant coach to the young Larry once he played there.[11]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![Bird in a basketball uniform, having just shot a ball](image)Bird warming up for Indiana State\nBird received a scholarship to play college basketball for the Indiana Hoosiers under head coach Bob Knight in 1974.[17] After less than a month on the Indiana University campus he dropped out of school, finding the adjustment between his small hometown and the large student population of Bloomington to be overwhelming.[9] He returned to French Lick, enrolling at Northwood Institute (now Northwood University) in nearby West Baden, and working municipal jobs for a year before enrolling at Indiana State University in Terre Haute in 1975.[18][19][20] He had a successful three-year career with the Sycamores, helping them reach the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history with a 33\u20130 record where they played the 1979 championship game against Michigan State.[21][22] Indiana State lost the game 75\u201364, with Bird scoring 19 points but making only 7 of 21 shots.[9]\n\n\nThe game achieved the highest-ever television rating for a college basketball game, in large part because of the matchup between Bird and Spartans' point guard Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson,[12] a rivalry that lasted throughout their professional careers. Despite failing to win the championship, Bird earned numerous year-end awards and honors for his outstanding play, including the Naismith College Player of the Year Award.[22] For his college career, he averaged 30.3 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game,[23] leading the Sycamores to an 81\u201313 record during his tenure.[22] Bird also appeared in one game for the baseball team, going 1-for-2 with 2 RBI.[24] He graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education.[25]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (1979\u20131992)[edit]\n\n\n#### Joining the Celtics (1978\u20131979)[edit]\n\n\nBird was selected by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft.[23] He did not sign with the Celtics immediately; instead, he played out his final season at Indiana State and led the Sycamores to the NCAA title game. Celtics general manager Red Auerbach publicly stated that he would not pay Bird more than any Celtic on the current roster, but Bird's agent Bob Woolf told Auerbach that Bird would reject any sub-market offers and simply enter the 1979 draft instead, where Boston's rights would expire when the draft began on June 25, and Bird would have been the likely top pick. After protracted negotiations, Bird inked a five-year, $3.25 million contract with the team on June 8, making him the highest-paid rookie in sports history.[26][15][27] Shortly afterwards, NBA draft eligibility rules were changed to prevent teams from drafting players before they were ready to sign, a rule known as the Bird Collegiate Rule.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Early success (1979\u20131983)[edit]\n\n\n![A box score with Bird's numbers highlighted](image)Bird recorded 14 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in his NBA debut against the Houston Rockets on October 12, 1979.\nIn his rookie season (1979\u201380), Bird immediately transformed the Celtics into a title contender. The team improved its win total by 32 games from the year before he was drafted and finished first in the Eastern Conference.[28][29] In his career debut, Bird recorded 14 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists in a 114\u2013106 win over the Houston Rockets.[30] On November 14, 1979, Bird recorded his first career triple-double with 23 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists in a 115\u2013111 win over the Detroit Pistons.[31] On November 23, Bird recorded his first 30-point scoring game (along with 11 rebounds and 3 assists) in a 118\u2013103 win over the Indiana Pacers.[32]\n\n\nWith averages of 21.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, 4.5 assists, and 1.7 steals per game for the season, he was selected to the All-Star Team and named Rookie of the Year.[23] In the Conference finals, Boston was eliminated by the Philadelphia 76ers.[29]\n\n\nBefore the 1980\u201381 season, the Celtics selected forward Kevin McHale in the draft and acquired center Robert Parish from the Golden State Warriors,[33][34] forming a Hall of Fame trio for years to come; the front-court of Bird, McHale, and Parish is regarded as one of the greatest front-courts in NBA history.[35][36][37] Behind Bird's leadership and Boston's upgraded roster, the Celtics again advanced to the conference finals for a rematch with the 76ers.[38] Boston fell behind 3\u20131 to start the series but won the next three games to advance to the Finals against the Houston Rockets,[39] winning in six games and earning Bird his first championship.[38] He averaged 21.9 points, 14 rebounds, 6.1 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the postseason and 15.3 points, 15.3 rebounds, and 7 assists per game for the Finals.[23][40]\n\n\nAt the 1982 All-Star Game, Bird scored 19 points en route to winning the All-Star Game MVP Award.[41] At the conclusion of the season, he earned his first All-Defensive Team selection.[23] He eventually finished runner-up in Most Valuable Player Award voting to Moses Malone.[41] In the Conference finals, the Celtics faced the 76ers for the third consecutive year, losing in seven games.[42] Boston's misfortunes continued into the next season, with Bird again finishing second in MVP voting to Malone and the team losing in the conference semifinals to the Milwaukee Bucks.[41][43]\n\n\n\n#### MVP threepeat (1983\u20131986)[edit]\n\n\n![Bird jumping into a layup](image)Bird playing for the Celtics in a game against the Washington Bullets\nBird was named MVP of the 1983\u201384 season with averages of 24.2 points, 10.1 rebounds, 6.6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game.[23] In the playoffs, the Celtics avenged their loss from the year before to the Bucks, winning in five games in the conference finals to advance to the Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers.[44] In Game Four, the Lakers\u2014led by Bird's college rival Magic Johnson\u2014were on the verge of taking a commanding 3\u20131 series lead before a flagrant foul was committed on Kurt Rambis that resulted in a brawl and caused the Lakers to lose their composure.[45] Boston came back to win the game, eventually winning the series in seven.[44] Bird was named Finals MVP behind 27.4 points, 14 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game.[44]\n\n\nOn December 9, 1984, Bird recorded 48 points to go along with 14 rebounds and 5 assists in a 128\u2013127 win over the Atlanta Hawks.[46] On March 12 of the 1984\u201385 season, Bird scored a career-high and franchise record 60 points in a game against the Atlanta Hawks.[47] The performance came just nine days after Kevin McHale set the previous Celtics record for points in a game with 56.[48] At the conclusion of the year, Bird was named MVP for the second consecutive season, behind averages of 28.7 points, 10.5 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game.[23] Boston advanced through the playoffs to earn a rematch with the Lakers, this time losing in six games.[49]\n\n\nDuring the 1985 offseason, Bird injured his back shoveling crushed rock to create a driveway at his mother's house. At least partially as a result of this, he experienced back problems for the remainder of his career.[50]\n\n\n\n![Bird holding a basketball, aiming to shoot](image)Bird playing for the Celtics in the 1985 NBA playoffs\nBefore the start of the 1985\u201386 season, the Celtics made a daring trade for Bill Walton, an All-Star center with a history of injury.[51] The risk paid off; Walton's acquisition helped Boston win a league best 67 games.[52] One of Bird's career highlights occurred at the 1986 NBA All-Star Weekend when he walked into the locker room at the inaugural Three-Point Shootout and asked who was going to finish second before winning the shootout.[53][54]\n\n\nOn November 27, 1985, Bird recorded 47 points to go along with 12 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals in a 132\u2013124 win over the Detroit Pistons.[55] On March 10, 1986, Bird scored 50 points to go along with 11 rebounds and 5 assists in a 115\u2013116 loss to the Dallas Mavericks.[56]\n\n\nWith averages of 25.8 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists, and 2 steals per game, Bird became just the third player in NBA history to win three consecutive MVP Awards.[57] In the playoffs, the Celtics lost only one game through the first three rounds en route to a match-up against the Rockets in the Finals.[51] In Game 6 of the Finals series, Bird recorded a triple-double of 29 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists as the Celtics won the Finals series 4 games to 2 against the Rockets.[58] Bird averaged 24 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 9.5 assists per game for the championship round.[59]\n\n\nThe '86 Celtics are commonly ranked as one of the greatest basketball teams of all time, with the *Boston Globe*'s Peter May and Grantland's Bill Simmons listing them at number one.[60]\n\n\n\n#### Falling short (1986\u20131988)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1987, the Celtics made their last Finals appearance of Bird's career, fighting through difficult series against the Milwaukee Bucks and Detroit Pistons. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Pistons, with five seconds remaining in the fourth quarter and Boston trailing the Pistons 107\u2013106, Bird stole an inbound pass. Falling out of bounds, Bird turned and passed the ball to teammate Dennis Johnson, who converted a game-winning 2-point layup with less than a second left. The dramatic play saved the series for the Celtics. When they reached the NBA Finals, the Celtics lost to a dominant Lakers team that had won 65 games during the season. The Celtics ended up losing to the Lakers in six games, with Bird averaging 24.2 points on .445 shooting, 10 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game in the championship series.[61] The Celtics fell short in 1988 losing to the Detroit Pistons in 6 games in the Eastern Conference finals as the Pistons made up from the heartbreak the previous season. Between them, Bird and Johnson captured eight NBA championships during the 1980s, with Magic getting five and Bird three. During the 1980s, either Boston or Los Angeles appeared in every NBA Finals.[62]\n\n\nThroughout the 1980s, contests between the Celtics and the Lakers\u2014both during the regular season and in the Finals\u2014attracted enormous television audiences. The first regular-season game between the Celtics and the Lakers in the 1987\u201388 season proved to be a classic with Magic Johnson banking in an off-balance shot from near the three-point line at the buzzer for a 115\u2013114 Lakers win at Boston Garden.[63] The historical rift between the teams, which faced each other several times in championship series of the 1960s, fueled fan interest in the rivalry. Not since Bill Russell squared off against Wilt Chamberlain had professional basketball enjoyed such a marquee matchup.[*citation needed*] The apparent contrast between the two players and their respective teams seemed scripted for television, as they were polar opposites in nearly every way conceivable. Bird was white, Johnson was black; Bird was an introvert from a small town playing in blue-collar Boston, while Johnson was the gregarious personification of the glitz and glamour of Los Angeles; Bird's Celtics played gritty, physical, defence-first basketball, whereas Johnson ran the Lakers' fast-paced Showtime offense. A 1980s Converse commercial for its \"Weapon\" line of basketball shoes (endorsed by both Bird and Johnson) reflected the perceived dichotomy between the two players. In the commercial, Bird is practicing alone on a rural basketball court (in reality the court was one Bird had made on the property in French Lick that he had purchased for his mother), when Johnson pulls up in a sleek limousine and challenges him to a one-on-one match.[64]\n\n\nDespite the intensity of their rivalry, Bird and Johnson became friends off the court. Their friendship blossomed when the two players worked together to film the Converse commercial, which depicted them as archenemies. Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony on February 4, 1993, and emotionally described Bird as a \"friend forever\".[65]\n\n\n\n#### Late career (1988\u20131992)[edit]\n\n\nThe 1987\u201388 season was the highest-scoring season of Bird's career. In Game 7 of the 1988 Eastern Conference semifinals against the Atlanta Hawks, Bird shot 9 of 10 from the floor in the fourth quarter, scoring 20 points in that quarter and lifting the Celtics to a series-clinching victory over Atlanta.[66][67][68] Bird finished with 34 points. His effort helped to overcome a 47-point performance by Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins.[69] Wilkins remarked, \"The basket was like a well. I couldn't miss. He couldn't miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I've ever played in or seen played.\" The Celtics failed to reach the NBA Finals for the first time in five years, losing to the Pistons in six games during the Eastern Conference finals.\n\n\nBird's 1988\u201389 season ended after six games when he had bone spurs surgically removed from both of his heels.[70] He returned to the Celtics in 1989, but debilitating back problems and an aging Celtic roster prevented him from regaining his mid-1980s form. Nonetheless, during the final years of his career, Bird maintained his status as one of the premier players in the game. In his final three seasons with the Celtics, Bird averaged over 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists per game, shot better than 45% from the field, and led the Celtics to playoff appearances.\n\n\nAfter leading the Celtics to a 29\u20135 start to the 1990\u201391 season, Bird missed 22 games due to a compressed nerve root in his back, a condition that eventually led to his retirement. He had off-season surgery to remove a disc from his back, but his back problems continued and he missed 37 games during the 1991\u201392 season. During the 1992 Eastern Conference semi-finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Bird missed four of the seven games due to recurring back problems.\n\n\nDuring Bird's final two seasons when he had serious back problems, the Celtics went 71\u201328 when he played. Without Bird, they had a 30\u201329 record, further demonstrating his importance and game-changing ability while on the court.[71][72][73][74]\n\n\nOn August 18, 1992, Bird announced his retirement.[75] Following Bird's departure, the Celtics promptly retired his jersey number 33.\n\n\n\n## Rivalry with Magic Johnson[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bird's rivalry with Magic Johnson *(pictured)* is often credited with popularizing the NBA.\nLarry Bird and Magic Johnson are known to be \"one of the greatest rivalries in sports.\"[76] Their rivalry began in college, when Larry Bird and Indiana State lost to Magic Johnson and Michigan State in the NCAA Championship game. Their rivalry continued on in the revived Celtics\u2013Lakers Rivalry in the NBA. Either the Celtics, led by Bird, or the Lakers, led by Magic, were present in every NBA Finals series in the '80s, with Bird and Magic meeting three times. Magic got the upper hand against Bird, beating him in 1985 and 1987, while Bird beat Magic in 1984.[77]\n\n\nJournalists speculated that Bird and Magic represented different contrasts, such as clashes between Celtics and Lakers, between East and West, and between Blacks and Whites. But, as one journalist would say, \u201cThey looked different, perhaps, but take a chainsaw to their souls and they were fraternal, if not identical, friends.\u201d[78] Watching Bird play was like watching Magic play, as they both shared this talent that the league had never seen before. They each had charisma, deft shooting touch, extraordinary passing skills, and team-oriented mindset that ignited their team and the crowd.[79] This style of play was starting to influence a new horde of fans as they would sit and \u201cmarvel at what they [Bird and Magic] can do\u201d while giving younger kids \u201ca different perspective of the game\u201d.[80]\n\n\nBird and Magic's presence on the court was only a small part of their contribution to basketball, as their rivalry changed the landscape of the NBA, transforming it from a \u201cstruggling, barely profitable league into a highly visible, financial and marketing dream for teams and players alike\u201d.[76] Many people realized that the emergence of these two stars were linked with the rise in popularity of the NBA, as the NBA started to market towards these two stars.[76]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Bird joined Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, and other NBA stars to play for the United States men's national basketball team in that year's Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.[81] It was the first time in the United States' Olympic history that the country sent NBA players to compete. The \"Dream Team\" won the men's basketball gold medal. In eight games, Bird averaged 8.4 points.[82] The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame called the team \"the greatest collection of basketball talent on the planet\".[83]\n\n\n\n## Player profile and legacy[edit]\n\n\nBird was voted onto the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team list in 1996,[84][85] and inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998.[86][87] He was inducted into the Hall of Fame again in 2010, as a member of the \"Dream Team\".[88] In 1999, Bird ranked No. 30 on ESPN SportsCentury's list of 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th century. He played both the small forward and power forward positions.[89] Universally recognized as an all-time great player, Bird was placed at the power forward position on an NBA all-time starting five roster with fellow superstars Magic Johnson (point guard), Michael Jordan (shooting guard), LeBron James (small forward), and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (center) in 2020.[90]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"Larry, you only told me one lie. You said there will be another Larry Bird. Larry, there will never, ever be another Larry Bird.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n-Magic Johnson, as quoted at Bird's retirement party.[91]\n\nBird has been described as one of the greatest basketball players and greatest shooters of all time.[92][93][94] He was selected to 12 NBA All-Star teams.[95] Bird won three NBA championships (in 1981, 1984, and 1986) with the Celtics[89] and won two NBA Finals MVP Awards.[96] Bird won three consecutive regular season MVP awards; as of 2020, the only other players to accomplish this feat are Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain.[97] Bird was also a four-time regular season MVP runner-up in 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1988.[98] Bird is also remembered as one of the foremost clutch performers in the history of the NBA; he was known for his excellent play in high-stakes, high-pressure situations.[99][100][101] In October 2021, as part of the NBA's 75th Anniversary, Bird was honored as one of the 75 greatest players of all time, by being named to the NBA's 75th Anniversary All-Time Team.[3] To commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Bird as the 7th greatest player in NBA history.[102]\n\n\nBird scored 24.3 points per game in his career on a .496 field goal percentage, an .886 free throw percentage, and a .376 percentage on three-point shots. Bird had an average of 10.0 rebounds per game for his career and 6.3 assists.[103] Bird was the first player in NBA history to shoot 50% or better on field goals, 40% on three-pointers, and 90% on free-throws in a single NBA season while achieving the league minimum for makes in each category.[104] He accomplished this feat twice.[105] Bird won NBA three-point-shooting contests in three consecutive years.[106] He sometimes practiced shooting three-point shots with his eyes closed.[103]\n\n\nBird is also remembered as an excellent passer[107] and defender.[89] While he was relatively slow, Bird displayed a knack for anticipating the moves of his opponent, making him a strong team defender.[92] He had 1,556 career steals.[108] In recognition of his defensive abilities, Bird was named to three All-Defensive Second Teams.[92]\n\n\nBird was widely considered one of Red Auerbach's favorite players. He considered Bird to be the greatest basketball player of all time.[109] Bird's humble roots were the source of his most frequently used moniker, \"The Hick from French Lick\".[110] Bird was also referred to as \"Larry Legend\".[111]\n\n\nBird was known for his trash-talking on the court and is remembered as one of the most notable trash-talkers of his era.[112][113] He was known for telling his opponents how and where in the court he would score against them; Xavier McDaniel recounted that Bird predicted a game-winning shot against him, then \"shot a shot right in my face and was like 'Damn, I didn't mean to leave two seconds on the clock.'\"[114] When playing against Dennis Rodman, a player known for his defensive abilities, in the 1987 Eastern Conference finals, Bird continually belittled Rodman's ability, at one point asking Chuck Daly, Detroit's head coach, to send in someone up to the task of guarding him.[115]\n\n\nAt the 2019 NBA Awards, Bird received the NBA Lifetime Achievement Award (shared with Magic Johnson).[116] Since 2022, the NBA will award the MVPs for the conference finals; the Eastern Conference Finals MVP trophy is named in Bird's honor, while the Western Conference trophy is named after Johnson.[117]\n\n\n\n## Coaching and executive careers[edit]\n\n\n![Bronzed shoes on a plaque with text describing Bird's basketball accomplishments](image)A Larry Bird plaque at Quincy Market, Boston\nThe Celtics employed Bird as a special assistant in the team's front office from 1992 until 1997.[118] In 1997, Bird accepted the position of coach of the Indiana Pacers[119] and said he would be on the job for no more than three years.[120] Despite having no previous coaching experience, Bird led the Pacers to a 58\u201324 record\u2014the franchise's best as an NBA team at the time\u2014in the 1997\u201398 season,[121] and pushed the Chicago Bulls to seven games in the Eastern Conference finals.[121] He was named the NBA Coach of the Year for his efforts.[122] Bird then led the Pacers to consecutive Central Division titles in 1999 and 2000 and a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals.[121] Bird resigned his head coaching position shortly after the end of the 2000 season, following through on his initial promise to coach for only three years.[123]\n\n\nIn 2003, Bird was hired as the Indiana Pacers' president of basketball operations.[124] After the 2011\u20132012 NBA season, Bird was named NBA Executive of the Year, becoming the only man in NBA history to win the NBA MVP, Coach of the Year and Executive of the Year.[125] On June 27, 2012, a day before the 2012 NBA draft, Bird and the Pacers announced that they would be parting ways; Bird said that health issues were among the reasons for his departure.[126] Bird returned to the Pacers as president of basketball operations in 2013.[6] He stepped down again in 2017, but stayed with the team in an advisory capacity.[127] He continued to serve as an advisor until July 2022, when he \"stepped back from maintaining an active role with the Indiana Pacers\".[128] Nearly a year later, it was announced in June 2023 the Pacers re-hired Bird to serve as a consultant.[8]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n**NBA**\n\n\n\n* 3\u00d7 NBA champion (1981, 1984, 1986)\n* 2\u00d7 NBA Finals MVP (1984, 1986)\n* 3\u00d7 NBA Most Valuable Player (1984\u20131986)\n* 12\u00d7 NBA All-Star (1980\u20131988, 1990\u20131992)\n* NBA All-Star Game MVP (1982)\n* 9\u00d7 All-NBA First Team (1980\u20131988)\n* All-NBA Second Team (1990)\n* 3\u00d7 NBA All-Defensive Second Team (1982\u20131984)\n* NBA Rookie of the Year (1980)\n* NBA All-Rookie First Team (1980)\n* 3\u00d7 Three-point Shootout champion (1986\u20131988)\n* Named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996\n* Selected on the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021[129]\n* No. 33 retired by Boston Celtics\n* Trophy named in Bird's honor (Larry Bird Trophy) awarded to Eastern Conference finals MVP (established in 2022)[130]\n* NBA All-Star Game head coach (1998)\n* NBA Coach of the Year (1998)\n* NBA Executive of the Year (2012)\n\n\n**USA Basketball**\n\n\n\n* 1992 Olympic gold medal (U.S. national team)[131]\n\n\n**NCAA**\n\n\n\n* John R.

In *One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird*, Bird plays opposite Julius Erving in a game of one-on-one. A sequel, *Jordan vs Bird: One on One*, was a 1988 basketball video game. In 2011, Bird was featured on the cover of *NBA 2K12*, alongside Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan. Bird is also a playable character in the revamped *NBA Jam*.[136]\n* In a McDonald's commercial from 1991 (first aired during the Super Bowl), Bird and Michael Jordan have a trick shot contest, in which the winner got Jordan's lunch and the loser had to watch the winner eat. In a commercial during Super Bowl XLIV, Dwight Howard and LeBron James challenge each other at trick shots for a McDonald's lunch. After they finish, clapping is heard, then the camera pans to the crowd, and Bird says \"Great show, guys. Thanks for lunch.\" Howard and James share a confused look. Howard asks, \"Who was that?\" James replies, \"I have no idea.\"[137]\n* Until July 2023, Twitter's logo was named Larry in honor of Larry Bird.[138][139][140]\n* Larry Bird is a character in the HBO series *Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty*.\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1975, Bird married Janet Condra. They remained married for less than a year. Following an attempted reconciliation, Bird and Condra had a daughter, Corrie, in 1977.[141]\n\n\nBird married Dinah Mattingly in 1989. They have two adopted children, Conner and Mariah.[141]\n\n\nDuring his professional career with the Celtics, Bird lived in the Boston suburb of Brookline, Massachusetts.[142]\n\n\n\n## Career

He played 14 seasons as a forward in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers. Baylor was a gifted shooter, a strong rebounder, and an accomplished passer, who was best known for his trademark hanging jump shot. The No. 1 draft pick in 1958, NBA Rookie of the Year in 1959, 11-time NBA All-Star, and a 10-time member of the All-NBA first team, Baylor is regarded as one of the game's all-time greatest players.[1] In 1977, Baylor was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[2] In 1996, Baylor was named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.[3] In October 2021, Baylor was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team.[4]\n\n\nBaylor spent 22 years as general manager of the Los Angeles Clippers, having managed the team for the majority of the Donald Sterling ownership period. He won the NBA Executive of the Year Award in 2006. Two years later, the Clippers relieved him of his executive duties shortly before the 2008\u201309 season began.[5]\n\n\nHis popularity led to appearances on the television series *Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In* in 1968; the Jackson 5's first TV special in 1971; a *Buck Rogers in the 25th Century* episode \"Olympiad\"; and an episode of *The White Shadow* titled \"If Your Number's Up, Get Down\".\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nElgin \"Rabbit\" Baylor was born in Washington, D.C., on September 16, 1934,[6][7] the son of Uzziel (Lewis) and John Wesley Baylor.[8] He began playing basketball when he was 14.[9] Although he grew up near a D.C. city recreation center, African Americans were banned from using the facilities, and Baylor had limited access to basketball courts growing up.[10] He had two basketball-playing brothers, Sal and Kermit.[11] After stints at Southwest Boys Club and Brown Jr. High, Baylor was a three-time All-City player in high school.[12]\n\n\nBaylor played his first two years of high school basketball at Phelps Vocational High School in the 1951 and 1952 seasons. At the time, public schools in Washington, D.C., were segregated, so he only played against other black high school teams. There, Baylor set his first area scoring record of 44 points, versus Cardozo H.S.[12] During his two All-City years at Phelps, he averaged 18.5 and 27.6 points per season.[12] He did not perform well academically and dropped out of school (1952\u201353) to work in a furniture store and play basketball in the local recreational leagues.[12]\n\n\nBaylor reappeared for the 1954 season as a senior playing for the recently opened all-black Spingarn High School. The 6\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in (1.96\u00a0m),[7] 225\u00a0lb (102\u00a0kg)[13] senior was named first-team Washington All-Metropolitan, and was the first African-American player named to that team.[9] Baylor also won the SSA's Livingstone Trophy as the area's best basketball player for 1954. He finished with a 36.1 average for his eight Interhigh Division II league games.[12]\n\n\nOn February 3, 1954, in a game against his old Phelps team, Baylor scored 31 in the first half. Playing with four fouls the entire second half, Baylor scored 32 more points to establish a new DC-area record with 63 points. This broke the point record of 52 that Western's Jim Wexler had set the year before when he broke Baylor's previous record of 44. However, because Wexler was white and Baylor was black, Baylor's record did not receive the same press coverage from the media, including the *Washington Post*, as Wexler's.[12][10]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baylor at Seattle\nDespite his success as a high school basketball player, no major college recruited Baylor because at the time, college scouts did not recruit at black high schools.[6] While some colleges were willing to accept Baylor, he did not qualify academically.[9] A friend of Baylor's who attended the College of Idaho helped arrange a football scholarship for Baylor for the 1954-55 academic year.[6][9] Baylor never played football for the school, however; instead, he was accepted to the college's basketball team without having to try out.[6] He outperformed the other players on the team that season, averaging over 31 points and 20 rebounds per game.[6][9]\n\n\nAfter the season, the College of Idaho dismissed its head basketball coach and restricted the scholarships. A Seattle car dealer interested Baylor in Seattle University, and Baylor sat out a year to play for Westside Ford, an Amateur Athletic Union team in Seattle, while establishing eligibility at Seattle.[14] The Minneapolis Lakers drafted him in the 14th round of the 1956 NBA draft, but Baylor opted to stay in school instead.[15]\n\n\nDuring the 1956\u201357 season, Baylor averaged 29.7 points per game and 20.3 rebounds per game for Seattle.[9] The next season, Baylor averaged 32.5 points per game and led the Seattle University Chieftains (now known as the Redhawks) to the NCAA championship game, Seattle's only trip to the Final Four, falling to the Kentucky Wildcats.[6][9] Following his junior season, Baylor was drafted again by the Minneapolis Lakers, with the No. 1 pick in the 1958 NBA draft, and this time he opted to leave school to join them for the 1958\u201359 NBA season.[6][16]\n\n\nOver three collegiate seasons, one at College of Idaho and two at Seattle, Baylor averaged 31.3 points per game and 19.5 rebounds per game. He led the NCAA in rebounds during the 1956\u201357 season.[17]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Minneapolis / Los Angeles Lakers (1958\u20131971)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year (1958\u20131959)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baylor standing next to teammates Jerry Chambers (center) and Jerry West (right), circa 1966\nThe Minneapolis Lakers used the No. 1 overall pick in the 1958 NBA draft to select Baylor, then convinced him to skip his senior year at SU and instead join the pro ranks. The team had been unsuccessful since the retirement of its star center George Mikan in 1954. The year prior to Baylor's arrival, the team finished 19\u201353\u00a0\u2013 the worst record in the league\u00a0\u2013 with a squad that was slow, bulky and aging. It had no permanent home arena to play in, was losing popularity, and in financial trouble. Owner Bob Short, who was ready to sell the team, believed Baylor's star athletic talents and all-around game could save the franchise. Short told the *Los Angeles Times* in a 1971 interview: \"If he had turned me down then, I would have been out of business. The club would have gone bankrupt.\"[6][18] Baylor signed with the Lakers for $20,000 per year (equivalent to $210,000 in 2023), a large sum in the NBA at the time.[9] According to basketball historian James Fisher, by virtue of his exceptional skills and his central role in the team's business plan, Baylor became the NBA's first franchise player.[6]\n\n\nBaylor immediately exceeded expectations and ultimately saved the Lakers franchise.[6] As a rookie in 1958\u201359, Baylor finished fourth in the league in scoring (24.9 points per game), third in rebounding (15.0 rebounds per game), and eighth in assists (4.1 assists per game). He scored 55 points in a single game,[9] then the third-highest mark in league history behind Joe Fulks' 63 and Mikan's 61.[19]\n\n\nOn January 16, 1959, Baylor refused to play in a road game in Charleston, West Virginia, after the hotel the team booked denied lodging to the team's three black players.[20] When a teammate tried to convince Baylor to play in the game, Baylor said, \"I'm a human being, I'm not an animal put in a cage and let out for the show.\"[7]\n\n\nBaylor won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award and led the Lakers to the NBA finals, where they lost to the Boston Celtics in the first four-game sweep in finals history,[21] kicking off the greatest rivalry in NBA history.[7][13]\n\n\n\n#### Peak years (1959\u20131965)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The cover of the Los Angeles Lakers program for \"Elgin Baylor Night\" on March 21, 1969\nIn 1960, the Lakers moved from Minnesota to Los Angeles, drafted Jerry West to play point guard, and hired Fred Schaus who was also the coach during West\u2019s college career. The duo of Baylor and West, joined in 1968 by center Wilt Chamberlain, led the Lakers to success in the Western Division throughout the 1960s.[7][13][20]\n\n\nFrom the 1960\u201361 to the 1962\u201363 seasons, Baylor averaged 34.8, 38.3, and 34.0 points per game, respectively. On November 15 of the 1960\u201361 season, Baylor set an NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks, while also grabbing 25 rebounds. In doing so, Baylor became the first NBA player to score more than 70 points in a game, breaking his own NBA record of 64 points that he had set the previous November. Baylor held the record until 1962, when Chamberlain scored 100 points.[6][7][13]\n\n\nBaylor, a United States Army Reservist, was called to active duty during the 1961\u201362 season, and being stationed at Fort Lewis in Washington, he could play for the Lakers only when on a weekend pass. He was unable to practice with the team before or during the season, and had to fly coach across the country on weekends to join the team at whichever arena they were appearing. Despite playing only 48 games that season, he still managed to score over 1,800 points, averaging 38.3 points (the highest average in NBA history by any player other than Chamberlain), 18.6 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game. Later that season, in a Game Five NBA Finals victory against the Boston Celtics, Baylor set the still-standing NBA record for points in an NBA Finals game with 61.[7] Basketball historian James Fisher described Baylor's performance that season as: \"Not bad for a part-time job.\"[6] Baylor later said he \"kind of enjoyed that season.\"[20]\n\n\n\n#### Knee injury and later seasons (1965\u20131971)[edit]\n\n\nBaylor suffered a severe knee injury during the opening game of the 1965 Western Division playoffs, which required surgery and left him unable to play in the remainder of the playoffs. Although he scored more than 24 points in each of the next four seasons despite his injury, the limitations of knee surgery at the time and the lack of meaningful rehab left him with nagging knee problems, ultimately resulting in surgery on both knees, which impaired his playing ability for the rest of his career.[7][13][20]\n\n\nBaylor played just two games in 1970\u201371 before rupturing his Achilles tendon,[9] and finally retired nine games into the subsequent 1971\u201372 season because of his nagging injuries.[13] Baylor told the press that he could no longer play at the highest level of the sport[7] and wanted to free up room on the Lakers' roster for other players.[6]\n\n\nIn 14 seasons as the Lakers' forward, Baylor helped lead the team to the NBA Finals eight times, but the team lost each time.[13] As a result of his retirement at the beginning of the season, Baylor missed two historic achievements: the Lakers' first game afterwards began an NBA record 33-game win streak, after which they won the 1972 championship.[20] The organization awarded Baylor a championship ring despite the early retirement.[7]\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1974, Baylor was hired to be an assistant coach and later the head coach for the New Orleans Jazz, but had a lackluster 86\u2013135 record and was fired following the 1978\u201379 season, shortly before the team moved to Salt Lake City, Utah.[7][13]\n\n\n\n## Executive career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1986, Baylor was hired by the Los Angeles Clippers as the team's vice president of basketball operations. He was selected as the NBA Executive of the Year in 2006.[22] During his tenure, the Clippers managed only two winning seasons and amassed a win\u2013loss record of 607\u20131153.[23] They made the playoffs only four times,[13] and won only one playoff series.[23] He stayed in that capacity for 22 years until October 2008.[7]\n\n\n\n## Later life and death[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009 Baylor filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against the Clippers, team owner Donald Sterling, team president Andy Roeser, and the NBA. He alleged that he was underpaid during his tenure with the team and then fired because of his age and race.[24][25] Baylor later dropped the racial discrimination claims in the suit.[26] In 2011, a jury decided in the Clippers' favor on Baylor's remaining claims, finding Baylor's termination was based on the team's poor performance.[13][27] However, Baylor felt vindicated when Sterling was banned for life from the NBA in 2014 after recordings of him making racist comments were publicized by the press.[7][13]\n\n\nBaylor died in a Los Angeles hospital of natural causes on March 22, 2021, aged 86.[19] He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills. He was surrounded by his wife Elaine and their daughter Krystle; two children from a previous marriage, Alan and Alison; and a sister, Gladys.[7][13]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\nBaylor was known as an all-around player, excelling at defense, offense, rebounding, and passing. At 6'5\", 225lbs, he was short for a forward even for the time period in which he played, but he had the strength to \"muscle through\" defenders, and the finesse and creativity to maneuver around them, including to rebound missed shots and score second chance points. \n\n\nBaylor was known for his superior leaping abilities that allowed him to score by staying in the air longer than defenders; Bill Russell called him \"the godfather of hang time.\"[7] He invented \"moves\" to deceive defenders, involving changing hands or changing direction, even mid-air. \n\n\nBaylor's offensive repertoire included a running bank shot and a left-handed hook shot, though he was right-handed. He had an on-court facial twitch that he used as a head fake. Baylor credited his success to a talent for jumping and the creativity to spontaneously react to the defense.[6][13]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A letter from California Governor Ronald Reagan to Elgin Baylor\nSince the beginning of his NBA career, Baylor has been considered one of the best basketball players in the world, and his reputation as one of the greatest in history has endured. Before Baylor joined the NBA in 1958, the league's play was methodical but mechanical, dominated by set jump shots and running hook shots. Baylor introduced a creative and acrobatic playing style that would later be emulated by other NBA superstars such as Julius Erving and Michael Jordan.[6][13] Bill Simmons wrote, \"Along with Russell, Elgin turned a horizontal game into a vertical one.\"[7] Baylor's skill was esteemed by his contemporaries: Oscar Robertson wrote Baylor \"was the first and original high flier\"; Bill Sharman said Baylor was \"the greatest cornerman who ever played pro basketball\"; Tom Heinsohn said, \"Baylor as forward beats out Bird, Julius Erving and everybody else\".[13]\n\n\nBaylor was the last of the great undersized forwards in a league where many guards are now his size or bigger.[28] He finished his playing days with 23,149 points, 3,650 assists and 11,463 rebounds over 846 games. His signature running bank shot, which he was able to release quickly and effectively over taller players, led him to numerous NBA scoring records, several of which still stand.[16]\n\n\nThe 71 points Baylor scored on November 15, 1960, was a record at the time; it was also a team record that would not be surpassed until Kobe Bryant scored 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in January 2006. The 61 points he scored in Game 5 of the NBA Finals in 1962 is still an NBA Finals record.[16] Over his career, he averaged 27.4 points and 4.3 assists per game. An underrated rebounder, Baylor averaged 13.5 rebounds per game during his career,[7][13] including a remarkable 19.8 rebounds per game during the 1960\u201361 season[29]\u2014a season average exceeded by only five other players in NBA history, all of whom were 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m) or taller.[30]\n\n\nA 10-time All-NBA First Team selection and 11-time NBA All-Star, Baylor was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1977.[7][13] He was named to the NBA 35th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1980, the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996 and the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. in 2009, *SLAM Magazine* ranked him number 11 among its Top 50 NBA players of all time. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Baylor as the 23rd greatest player in NBA history.[31] He is often listed as the greatest NBA player never to win a championship, although this is not technically true. Baylor was a member of the 1971-1972 Los Angeles Lakers team that won the NBA championship, and although he was not on the roster when they won the championship that year, he is still technically an NBA champion due to playing for the team at the beginning of the season. As such, Baylor was awarded a championship ring by the Lakers front office due to his leadership and contributions at the start of the season.[32][33][34]\n\n\nFifty-one years after Baylor left Seattle University, they named its basketball court in honor of him on November 19, 2009. The Redhawks now play on the Elgin Baylor Court in Seattle's KeyArena. The Redhawks also host the annual Elgin Baylor Classic. In June 2017, The College of Idaho had Baylor as one of the inaugural inductees into the school's Hall of Fame.[35]\n\n\nThe first biography of Baylor was written by *Slam* Online contributor Bijan C. Bayne in 2015, and published by Rowman and Littlefield.[36]\n\n\nOn April 6, 2018, a statue of Baylor, designed by Gary Tillery and Omri Amrany, was unveiled at the Staples Center prior to a Lakers game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.[37]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n | \u00a0\u00a0GS\u00a0\n | Games started\n | \u00a0MPG\u00a0\n | Minutes per game\n |\n| \u00a0FG%\u00a0\n | Field goal percentage\n | \u00a03P%\u00a0\n | 3-point field goal percentage\n | \u00a0FT%\u00a0\n | Free throw percentage\n |\n| \u00a0RPG\u00a0\n | Rebounds per game\n | \u00a0APG\u00a0\n | Assists per game\n | \u00a0SPG\u00a0\n | Steals per game\n |\n| \u00a0BPG\u00a0\n | Blocks per game\n | \u00a0PPG\u00a0\n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n| \u00a0\\*\u00a0\n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n\n\nElgin Baylor regular season statistics\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP\n | MPG\n | FG%\n | FT%\n | RPG\n | APG\n | PPG\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1958\u201359 | Minneapolis | 70\n | 40.8\n | .408\n | .777\n | 15.0\n | 4.1\n | 24.9\n |\n| 1959\u201360 | Minneapolis | 70\n | 41.0\n | .424\n | .732\n | 16.4\n | 3.5\n | 29.6\n |\n| 1960\u201361 | L.A.

He was also named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team on five occasions and to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team three times. Havlicek is known for his stamina and his hustle as well as his abilities.\n\n\nDuring his career with the Celtics, Havlicek won eight NBA championships. He is known for stealing the ball to save the game--and the Celtics' playoff hopes--near the end of Game Seven in the 1965 Eastern Conference Finals. Havlicek served as captain of the Celtics from 1969 to 1978, and was named NBA Finals MVP in 1974. Following his retirement, his number 17 jersey was retired by the Celtics. Havlicek was inducted into Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1984.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHavlicek was born in Martins Ferry, Ohio, where his parents ran a general store.[2] He was of Czech and Croatian descent, from his father and mother respectively.[3] Havlicek was a three-sport athlete at Bridgeport High School in Bridgeport, Ohio, where he was a boyhood friend of Baseball Hall of Famer Phil Niekro.[4]\n\n\n\n## Collegiate career[edit]\n\n\nHavlicek played college basketball at Ohio State University with future seven-time NBA All-Star Jerry Lucas, who was his roommate, future first-round NBA draft pick Larry Siegfried, future coaching legend Bobby Knight, and Mel Nowell, among many others. The 1960 Ohio State Buckeyes, coached by head coach Fred Taylor and assistant coaches Jack Graf and Frank Truitt, won the 1960 NCAA title.[*citation needed*] Havlicek was named as an alternate of the 1960 United States national team that competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics.[5]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\nHavlicek was drafted by both the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League in 1962. After competing briefly as a wide receiver in the Browns' training camp that year, he focused his energies on playing for the Celtics. A swingman who could play either guard or forward,[6][7][8] he was known for his stamina, with competitors stating that it was a challenge just to keep up with him.[9] Head coach Red Auerbach went on to call him \"the guts of the team\".[10] Nicknamed \"**Hondo**\" (a nickname inspired by the 1953 movie of the same name starring John Wayne),[2] Havlicek revolutionized the \"sixth man\" role in the NBA coming off the bench for the Celtics during his early years.[11][12][13]\n\n\nHavlicek was later immortalized for his clutch steal in the closing seconds of the 1965 Eastern Conference Finals. In the seventh and final game, played at Boston Garden on April 15, the Celtics led the Philadelphia 76ers 110\u2013109 with five seconds left. They only needed to inbound the ball from underneath their basket to secure the victory and advance to the 1965 NBA Finals. However, Bill Russell's pass struck one of the basket's support wires hanging down from the ceiling, leading to a turnover that gave the 76ers and Wilt Chamberlain the ball and a chance to win the game.[2] Hal Greer was set to throw the inbounds pass for the 76ers. Havlicek stood with his back to Greer, guarding Chet Walker. But as Greer's pass came inbounds, Havlicek spun, leaped, and tipped the pass to Sam Jones.[2] Veteran referee Earl Strom, who wrote about the game in his memoir *Calling the Shots*, called Havlicek's reaction one of the greatest plays he ever saw in his 32 years as a professional official.[14] Announcer Johnny Most's call of \"Havlicek stole the ball!\" was dubbed by the NBA as \"the most famous radio call in basketball history.\"[15]\n\n\nHavlicek was a key player in the Celtics' dynasty during the 1960s.[16] The team won NBA championships in six of his first seven NBA seasons.[17]\n\n\nIn Game 5 of the 1968 Eastern Division Finals, Havlicek recorded a near triple-double with 29 points, 9 rebounds, and 10 assists as the Celtics avoided elimination at the hands of the 76ers.[18] He added a strong performance in Game 7, recording 21 points, 12 rebounds, and 8 assists in a 100\u201396 road win against the 76ers. In that series, the Celtics became the first NBA team to overcome a 3\u20131 playoff series deficit.[19]\n\n\nHavlicek became a full-time starter in the 1969-1970 season.[20] He also became the Celtics' captain in 1969, and continued in that role until 1978.[21] Havlicek \"stood as the bridge from the Bill Russell era to the Celtics' next championship team\".[22] The Celtics won the 1974 NBA Championship, and Havlicek was named NBA Finals MVP.[23]\n\n\nWith one second left in the second overtime of Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals, Havlicek made a leaning, running bank shot that appeared to be the game-winner. Phoenix called an illegal timeout, resulting in a technical foul shot converted by Jo Jo White. However, Phoenix still had one final possession, and Gar Heard scored for Phoenix to tie the game. The Celtics went on to win in triple overtime, which was hailed as the greatest NBA Finals game ever played.[24]\n\n\nHavlicek retired after the 1977\u201378 NBA season at age 38.[1] In April 1978, *The Sporting News* stated: \"The consensus is that Havlicek is still better than 80 percent of the players in the NBA\".[25]\n\n\n\n### Legacy[edit]\n\n\n\"'On stamina alone, he\u2019d be among the top players who ever played the game,' longtime New York Knicks coach Red Holzman once said of John \u201cHondo\u201d Havlicek. \"'It would\u2019ve been fair to those who had to play him or those who had to coach against him if he had been blessed only with his inhuman endurance. God had to compound it by making him a good scorer, smart ballhandler and intelligent defensive player with quickness of mind, hands and feet'\".[23]\n\n\nHavlicek retired as a 13-time NBA All-Star, and his number 17 jersey was retired by the Celtics.[26] At the time, Havlicek was the NBA career leader in games played (a mark surpassed in 1984 by Elvin Hayes)[27] and was in third place on the list of all-time NBA leaders in points scored.[28] Longtime Celtics teammate Bill Russell once described Havlicek as \"'the best all-around ballplayer [he] ever saw'\".[29] At the time of his death, Havlicek was the Celtics' all-time leading scorer with 26,395 points (20.8 points per game).[30][31] He was also the first player to score 1,000 points in 16 consecutive seasons, with his best scoring season coming during the 1970\u201371 season, when he averaged 28.9 points per game.[32] He was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team five times and was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team three times.[33]\n\n\nHavlicek finished his 16-year career with eight NBA championships.[9][23] As of 2019, only Bill Russell (with 11) and Sam Jones (with 10)--both of whom were Celtics teammates of Havlicek's--had won more NBA championships than he had.[34] Havlicek won all eight NBA Finals in which he participated.[35]\n\n\nIn 1980, Havlicek was selected as one of the league's greatest players ever, being named to the NBA 35th Anniversary Team.[36] In 1984, Havlicek became a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[10] In 1996, he was selected as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History by a panel of journalists, players, coaches, executives, and general managers.[37] He was also named the 14th best player of all-time in Bill Simmons's *Book of Basketball*.[38] In October 2021, Havlicek was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[39] To commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary, *The Athletic* published their own list of the top 75 players of all time, ranking Havlicek as the 29th-greatest player in NBA history.[22]\n\n\nIn 1974, Havlicek received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[40] In 2007, Bridgeport High School in his hometown renamed their gymnasium \"John J. Havlicek Gymnasium\".[41] Fellow NBA Hall of Famer Chris Mullin wore number 17 as a tribute to Havlicek.[42] In October 2022, Havlicek was inaugurated into the Croatian-American Sports Hall of Fame.[43]\n\n\nIn addition to his on-court success, Havlicek was known for his character[44][45] and for his commitment to placing the team ahead of his own individual achievements.[46] Longtime Celtics coach Red Auerbach once said, \"'If I ever had a son, I would want him to be like John Havlicek'\".[45]\n\n\n\n## Post-NBA years[edit]\n\n\nHavlicek was shrewd with his money during his playing career, and he invested much of this income in the Wendy's fast food chain during its formative years. The success of his investments left Havlicek with a comfortable income after retirement and he never had to work for a conventional salary again. He had no desire to coach; instead, he served as a corporate speaker.[1]\n\n\nHavlicek was a member of the board of the Genesis Foundation, which assists children with disabilities and genetic disorders. He and his wife Beth held the John Havlicek Celebrity Fishing Tournament for more than three decades, with proceeds going to the foundation.[29]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHavlicek met his wife, Beth, while both were attending Ohio State University. The couple married in 1967. They had two children: a son named Chris and a daughter named Jill.[2] Chris Havlicek attended the University of Virginia on a basketball scholarship in the early 1990s.[47] Jill Havlicek married former Major League Baseball outfielder and coach Brian Buchanan.[48]\n\n\nHavlicek had Parkinson's disease during his later years.[49] He died on April 25, 2019, in Jupiter, Florida at the age of 79.[1][50][51] Following his death, Boston City Hall was lit in green in his memory.[44]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n |

Abdul-Jabbar had previously set the record on April 5, 1984,[328] 8 months before James was born. After James broke the record, the NBA stopped the game for an on-court ceremony, where he gave a speech and then embraced Abdul-Jabbar, as well as his family.[329][330] James missed the following three games due to left ankle soreness.[331][332] On February 19, Team LeBron lost the 2023 NBA All-Star Game 184\u2013175 to Team Giannis, marking the first time that James lost an All-Star game as a captain. Prior to the game, he had been undefeated (5\u20130) as a captain, and since the format was changed in 2018.[333] During the game, he suffered a right hand contusion and was ruled out for the entire 2nd half.[334]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n166. **^** \"LeBron James leads all scorers with 35 points as Heat take Game 2\".

attributed the fall to a regression in his passing skills and shot selection, which stemmed from a lack of effort and focus.[59] The Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the East's second seed.[60] In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, James logged 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, scoring 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including the game-winning layup with two seconds left, in a 109\u2013107 double-overtime victory against the Pistons.[61] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance \"one of the greatest moments in postseason history\" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as \"Jordan-esque\".[62] In 2012, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn January of the 2014\u20132015 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, which at the time represented the longest stretch of missed games in his career.[179] In total, he played a career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[4] In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2\u20132 series tie with the Bulls.[180] In the conference finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Hawks to advance to the Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals.[181] For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities.[181] Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2\u20131 lead before being eliminated in six games.[182] Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award,[183] averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn February of the 2007\u20132008 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27-point, 8-rebound, and 9-assist performance.[67] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Raptors, doing so in over 100 less games than Daugherty.[68] His 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, marking his first scoring title.[69] Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45\u201337.[70] Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the eventual-champion Boston Celtics in the next round.[71] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a \"shootout\".[72]\n\n\n\n#### 2008\u20132010: MVP

Team.[286] James led all players in fan votes with his 18th All-Star selection, tying Bryant and just one behind Abdul-Jabbar;[287] his team achieved its fifth consecutive All-Star win,[288] defeating Team Durant 163\u2013161,[289] with James hitting the game-winning dagger shot in front of his hometown crowd.[290][291]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJames was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.[42] In his first regular season game, he scored 25 points in a 106\u201392 loss to the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.[43] At the conclusion of the 2003\u20132004 season, he became the first Cavalier to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[8] With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game,[44] he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game as a rookie.[45] Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35\u201347, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.[46]\n\n\n\n#### 2004\u20132008: Rise to

For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA player.[32] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James's role to a more unconventional one.[133] James spent more time in the post and improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots.[133][391] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's \"pass-happy\" offense.[392] Behind these improvements, James's overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels.[393] During this time, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James's free-throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as \"average\".[394] Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity,[395] posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016.[4][396] His shooting also temporarily regressed, and he briefly ranked as the NBA's worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint.[397] Despite these changes, he remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.[387]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n426. **^** Haberstroh, Tom (June 2, 2016). \"LeBron's 2\u20134 Finals record is one of his greatest achievements\".

Fighting Irish went 27\u20130 en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated.[24] As a sophomore, James averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds, along with 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game.[25] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent\u2013St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.[26] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26\u20131 and repeated as state champions.[23] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the *USA Today* All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor most of his career, James has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team.[398] His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history.[399] By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention he garners from opposing defenses,[400] James creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists.[401] He executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic.[402] His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.[387] Early in James's career, he was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations, in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games;[403][404] however, as his career progressed, James's clutch performance was viewed more favorably.[405]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBET Award for Sportsman of the Year\n |\n| --- |\n| * Allen Iverson (2001)\n* Kobe Bryant

the *House Party* series with James expected to make a cameo.[573] Later that month, Fox News host Laura Ingraham told James to \"shut up and dribble\" as a response to his political agendas.[574] This largely contributed to James creating a documentary film series looking at the changing role of athletes in the current political and cultural climate, aptly named, *Shut Up and Dribble* on

He played one season of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns and was selected as the second overall pick by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 2007 NBA draft. He played nine seasons with the franchise, which became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008, before signing with the Golden State Warriors in 2016, winning consecutive NBA championships and NBA Finals MVP Awards in 2017 and 2018. After sustaining an Achilles injury in the 2019 finals, he joined the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent that summer. Following disagreements with the Nets' front office, he requested a trade during the 2022 offseason and was traded to the Suns in 2023. He is regarded as one of the greatest players in NBA history.[1][2][3]\n\n\nDurant was a heavily recruited high school prospect who was widely regarded as the second-best player in his class. In college, he won numerous year-end awards and became the first freshman to be named Naismith College Player of the Year. As a professional, he has won two NBA championships, an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, two Finals MVP Awards, two NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Awards, four NBA scoring titles, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, been named to ten All-NBA teams (including six First Teams), and selected 13 times as an NBA All-Star. In 2021, Durant was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[4] As a member of the U.S. men's national team, Durant has won three gold medals in the Olympics (2012, 2016, and 2020) and is the leading scorer in Team USA's men's Olympic basketball history. He also won gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship.\n\n\nOff the court, Durant is one of the highest-earning basketball players in the world, due in part to endorsement deals with companies such as Foot Locker and Nike. He has developed a reputation for philanthropy and regularly leads the league in All-Star votes and jersey sales. In recent years, he has contributed to *The Players' Tribune* as both a photographer and writer. In 2012, he ventured into acting, appearing in the film *Thunderstruck*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDurant was born on September 29, 1988, in Washington, D.C.,[5] to Wanda (*n\u00e9e* Durant) and Wayne Pratt. When Durant was an infant, his father deserted the family; Wanda and Wayne eventually divorced, and Durant's grandmother Barbara Davis helped raise him. By age 13, his father reentered his life and traveled the country with him to basketball tournaments.[6][7] Durant has a sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne.[8]\n\n\nDurant and his siblings grew up in Prince George's County, Maryland, on the eastern outskirts of Washington, D.C.[9] He was unusually tall from a young age, and reached 6\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in (1.83\u00a0m) in height while still in middle school (age 10\u201312).[10] Growing up, Durant wanted to play for his favorite team, the Toronto Raptors,[11] which included his favorite player, Vince Carter.[11] He played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for several teams in the Maryland area and was teammates with future NBA players Michael Beasley, Greivis V\u00e1squez, and Ty Lawson, the first of whom Durant remains friends with to this day.[12]\n[13] During this time, he began wearing #35 as his jersey number in honor of his AAU coach, Charles Craig, who was murdered at the age of 35.[14]\n\n\nAfter playing two years of high school basketball at National Christian Academy and one year at Oak Hill Academy, Durant transferred to Montrose Christian School for his senior year, growing 5 inches (13\u00a0cm) before the start of the season and beginning the year at 6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in (2.01\u00a0m).[15]\n\n\nPrior to the start of the season, he committed to the University of Texas at Austin.[16] He had visited University of Connecticut and University of North Carolina, and said he considered Duke University, University of Kentucky and University of Louisville. When asked why he chose a college with a lesser-known program, he said, \"Wanted to set my own path.\"\n\n\nAt the end of the year, he was named the Washington Post All-Met Basketball Player of the Year, as well as the Most Valuable Player of the 2006 McDonald's All-American Game.[17][18] He was widely regarded as the second-best high school prospect of 2006, behind Greg Oden.[19][20][21]\n\n\nDurant had stated that he would have declared for the 2006 NBA draft if the NBA had not introduced the one-and-done rule, where his favorite team growing up, the Toronto Raptors, had the first overall pick.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant with the Texas Longhorns in 2007\nFor the 2006\u201307 college season, Durant\u2014who had grown to 6\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in (2.06\u00a0m)\u2014averaged 25.8 points, 11.1 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game for the Texas Longhorns.[5] Texas finished the season with a 25\u201310 record overall and a 12\u20134 record in conference.[24] Awarded a 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament, Texas won its first round match-up against New Mexico State but was upset in the second round by USC despite a 30-point and 9-rebound performance from Durant.[25] For his outstanding play, Durant was recognized as the unanimous national player of the year, winning the John R. Wooden Award,[26] the Naismith College Player of the Year Award,[27] and all eight other widely recognized honors and awards.[28][29][30][31][32][33] This made Durant the first freshman to win any of the national player of the year awards.[34] Following the season, he declared for the NBA draft.[35] His No. 35 jersey was later retired by the Longhorns.[36]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Seattle SuperSonics / Oklahoma City Thunder (2007\u20132016)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year (2007\u20132008)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant with the Sonics in 2008\nDurant was selected as the second overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics, after Greg Oden was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the first pick of the draft.[37] In his first regular season game, the 19-year-old Durant registered 18 points, five rebounds and three steals against the Denver Nuggets.[38] On November 16, he made the first game-winning shot of his career in a game against the Atlanta Hawks.[39] At the conclusion of the 2007\u201308 NBA season, he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year following averages of 20.3 points, 4.4 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game.[5] He joined Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James as the only teenagers in league history to average at least 20 points per game over an entire season.[40]\n\n\n\n#### Breakthrough (2008\u20132010)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing Durant's debut season, the SuperSonics relocated from Seattle to Oklahoma City, becoming the Thunder and switching to new colors \u2013 blue, orange, and yellow.[41] The team also drafted UCLA guard Russell Westbrook, who would form an All-Star combination with Durant in later years.[42] At the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend, Durant set a Rookie Challenge record with 46 points.[43] By the conclusion of the 2008\u201309 NBA season, he had raised his scoring average by five points from the prior season to 25.3 points per game,[5] and was considered a strong candidate for the Most Improved Player Award, eventually finishing third in the voting.[44] Durant continued to grow during his first few years in the NBA, finally reaching a height of 6\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in (2.11\u00a0m).[45]\n\n\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, Durant was selected to his first NBA All-Star Game.[5] Behind his play, the Thunder improved their record by 27 wins from the previous year and defied expectations to make the playoffs.[46][47] With a scoring average of 30.1 points per game, Durant became the youngest NBA scoring champion and was selected to his first All-NBA team.[5][48] In his playoff debut, he scored 24 points in a Game 1 loss against the Los Angeles Lakers.[49] Oklahoma City would go on to lose the series in six games,[50] but the team's performance led many analysts to label them as an upcoming title contender.[51]\n\n\n\n#### First NBA finals (2010\u20132012)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant scores on a slam dunk in March 2011 as a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nPrior to the start of the 2010\u201311 season, Durant announced via Twitter that he had signed a five-year contract extension with the Thunder worth approximately $86\u00a0million.[52][53] For the second consecutive year, he led the NBA in scoring, averaging 27.7 points a game.[54] Behind Durant's leadership, the Thunder won 55 games and earned the fourth seed in the Western Conference.[55] In the 2011 NBA playoffs, Oklahoma City defeated the Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies en route to a Conference Finals match-up versus the Dallas Mavericks, losing in five games.[56]\n\n\nOn February 19 of the lockout-shortened 2011\u201312 season, Durant recorded his first career 50-point game, scoring 51 points against the Denver Nuggets.[57][58] At the All-Star Game, he scored 36 points and was awarded the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award.[59] Durant finished the year with a scoring average of 28 points per game, representing his third straight scoring title.[60] Behind his play, the Thunder won 47 games and entered the 2012 NBA playoffs as the Western Conference's second seed.[61] In game 1 of the first round against the Dallas Mavericks, Durant hit a game-winner with 1.5 seconds remaining.[62] Oklahoma City would go on to defeat Dallas, the Lakers, and the San Antonio Spurs before losing to the Miami Heat in the 2012 NBA Finals.[63] For the NBA Finals, Durant led all players with 30.6 points per game, doing so on a 54.8 shooting rate.[64]\n\n\n\n#### 50\u201340\u201390 season (2012\u20132013)[edit]\n\n\nWith a scoring average of 28.1 points per game to finish the 2012\u201313 season, Durant failed to defend his scoring title; however, with a 51 percent shooting rate, a 41.6 percent three point shooting rate, and a 90.5 free throw shooting rate, he became the youngest player in NBA history to join the 50\u201340\u201390 club.[5][65] Finishing the year with a 60\u201322 record, Oklahoma City earned the first seed in the Western Conference.[66] In the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs against the Houston Rockets, Westbrook tore his meniscus, forcing him to miss the remainder of the postseason.[67][68] Without Westbrook, Durant was given more responsibility,[69] averaging a career-high 30.8 points per game throughout the playoffs,[5] but Oklahoma City were eventually eliminated in the second round by the Memphis Grizzlies in five games.[67]\n\n\n\n#### MVP season (2013\u20132014)[edit]\n\n\nIn January of the 2013\u201314 season, Durant averaged 35.9 points per game while scoring 30 or more points in 12 straight games, including a career-high 54 points against the Golden State Warriors.[70][71] In April, he surpassed Michael Jordan's record for consecutive games scoring 25 points or more at 41.[72] The Thunder finished the year with 59 wins and Durant was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player behind averages of 32 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game.[73] To begin the first round of the 2014 NBA playoffs, he struggled against the physical play of the Grizzlies, converting on only 24 percent of his field goals in game 4.[74] Through five games, the Thunder trailed the series 3\u20132, prompting *The Oklahoman* to dub Durant \"Mr. Unreliable\".[75] He responded by scoring 36 points in a Game 6 victory.[76] Oklahoma City eventually eliminated Memphis and the Los Angeles Clippers before losing to the Spurs in the Conference Finals in six games.[77]\n\n\n\n#### Final seasons with the Thunder (2014\u20132016)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant guards LeBron James in January 2015.\nPrior to the start of the 2014\u201315 season, Durant was diagnosed with a Jones fracture in his right foot and was ruled out for six to eight weeks.[78] He subsequently missed the first 17 games of the year, making his season debut for the Thunder on December 2 against the New Orleans Pelicans.[79] On December 18, he injured his ankle against the Golden State Warriors,[80] returning to action on December 31 against the Phoenix Suns to score a season-high 44 points.[81] He then sprained his left big toe in late January.[82] On February 22, he was sidelined again after undergoing a minor procedure to help reduce pain and discomfort in his surgically repaired right foot,[83] and on March 27, he was officially ruled out for the rest of the season after deciding to undergo foot surgery.[84] In just 27 games, he averaged 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game.[5]\n\n\nTo begin the 2015\u201316 season, Durant and Westbrook reached several historical milestones together, including becoming the first pair of teammates to each score at least 40 points in a single game since 1996, doing so in a win over the Orlando Magic on October 30.[85][86][87] For the year, Durant averaged 28.2 points, 8.2 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1.2 blocks per game,[5] leading the Thunder to 55 wins and the third seed in the West.[88] In game 2 of the first round of the 2016 NBA playoffs against the Mavericks, he scored 21 points but converted only 7 out of 33 shots in the worst postseason shooting performance, both by percentage and number of misses, of his career.[89] After defeating Dallas, Oklahoma City moved on to face the Spurs in the second round, falling behind 2\u20131 to start the series.[88] In game 4, Durant tied his playoff career high with 41 points in a Thunder win.[90] Oklahoma City eventually defeated the Spurs in six games, drawing a matchup with the record-setting 73-win Golden State Warriors in the Conference Finals.[88] Despite going up 3\u20131, the Thunder were ousted in seven games, with Durant providing 27 points in game 7.[91]\n\n\n\n### Golden State Warriors (2016\u20132019)[edit]\n\n\n#### First championship and finals MVP (2016\u20132017)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 4, Durant announced his intentions to sign with the Warriors in *The Players' Tribune*.[92][93][94] The move was received negatively by fans and pundits,[95][96] who felt that he took the easy route by leaving a team that had been up 3\u20131 and close to reaching the Finals to instead join their opponents, who had defeated them and were coming off a record-setting 73-win season; the Warriors had also won a championship the year before.[96][97][98] On July 7, Durant officially signed with Golden State on a two-year, $54.3 million contract with a player option after the first year.[99][100][101] Reflecting on the move for *Sports Illustrated*, Ben Golliver wrote, \"He chose an ideal roster fit and a shot at playing for the highest-scoring offense the NBA has seen in decades. He chose life alongside Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, the greatest shooting backcourt in history, and he chose to go against Andre Iguodala and Draymond Green, two elite defenders, in practices rather than in Western Conference finals games.\"[98]\n\n![](image)Durant after Warriors' practice in 2017\nDurant made his debut for the Warriors on October 25 against the San Antonio Spurs, scoring a team-high 27 points in a blowout loss.[102] On November 26, he recorded 28 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, and a career-high six blocked shots in a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, becoming the first player in team history to finish with at least 25 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, and five blocks in a single game.[103] On February 11, in his first game back in Oklahoma City since leaving for Golden State, Durant scored 34 points while being booed throughout the night as he helped the Warriors defeat the Thunder for the third time that year.[104] In March, Durant suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain and a tibial bone bruise, which forced him to miss the final 19 games of the season.[105][106] Golden State finished the year with a 67\u201315 record and entered the playoffs as the first seed.[107]\n\n\nDurant returned from injury in time for the 2017 NBA playoffs and helped the Warriors advance to their third consecutive Finals, while also becoming the first team in league history to start the postseason 12\u20130.[108] In game 1 of the series, Durant had 38 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists to lead the Warriors past LeBron James and the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers.[109] Durant then helped the Warriors go up 3\u20130 in the series with a 31-point effort in game 3, including the go-ahead 3-pointer with 45.3 seconds left in regulation.[110] In game 5, he scored 39 points to go with seven rebounds and five assists in a series-clinching win.[111] For the Finals, Durant was the Golden State's top scorer in every game, averaging 35.2 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 5.4 assists while shooting 55.5 percent from the field, 47.4 percent from three-point range, and 92.7 percent from the free throw line. He was subsequently named the NBA Finals MVP.[112][113]\n\n\n\n#### Second championship and finals MVP (2017\u20132018)[edit]\n\n\nAfter the finals, Durant declined his $27.7 million player option and became an unrestricted free agent.[114] On July 25, he re-signed with the Warriors for less money than the maximum, which helped the franchise create enough salary cap space to keep their core roster intact and add free agents.[115][116] On January 10 of the 2017\u201318 season, Durant scored 40 points in a loss to the Clippers, becoming the second-youngest player in league history to reach the 20,000-point milestone.[117] On January 23, he registered a career-high 14 assists in a win over the New York Knicks.[118] On February 14, he scored a season-high 50 points in a loss to the Trail Blazers.[119] In March, he missed games with a fractured rib, joining teammates Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson on the sidelines for the back-end of the season.[120] Golden State eventually finished the year with 58 wins and Durant set a career high for blocks in season with 119.[121]\n\n\nIn game 1 of the Western Conference Finals, Durant scored 37 points in a win over the higher-seeded Houston Rockets.[122] Through six games, the Warriors found themselves trailing 3\u20132, and Durant was criticized for contributing to Golden State's struggles by playing too much in isolation.[123] The Warriors staved off elimination in game 6, and in game 7 Durant scored 34 points, helping Golden State return to the Finals with a series-clinching victory.[124] In game 3 of the 2018 NBA Finals, Durant recorded a playoff career-high 43 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists in a win over the Cavaliers, leading the Warriors to a 3\u20130 advantage.[125][126] Golden State ultimately swept Cleveland and clinched a second straight championship; with averages of 28.8 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 7.5 assists, Durant also won his second Finals MVP Award.[127]\n\n\n\n#### Three-peat chase and injury (2018\u20132019)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant in 2019 during his third and final season with the Warriors\nOn July 7, 2018, Durant re-signed with the Warriors,[128] on a reported two-year, $61.5 million contract, which included a player option for the second year.[129] During an overtime loss to the Clippers on November 12, 2018, Green cursed out Durant over his upcoming free agency status after the season, and he was suspended for the much-publicized blowup.[130][131] On November 29, Durant scored a season-high 51 points in a 131\u2013128 overtime loss to the Toronto Raptors, thus scoring 40 or more in his third straight game.[132] With Curry and Green sidelined for most of November, the Warriors finished the month with a 15\u20138 record and five straight road losses,[132] after starting the season at 10\u20131.[133]\n\n\nIn game 5 of the first round of the playoffs, he scored a playoff career-high 45 points in a 129\u2013121 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.[134] In game 6, he set a new playoff career high with 50 points in a 129\u2013110 win to close out the series.[135] During Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Houston Rockets, Durant suffered a right calf strain,[136] subsequently missing Game 6, in which the Warriors won the series, as well as the entire Western Conference Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers, which the Warriors won in a four-game sweep.[137]\n\n\nAfter missing nine games with the strained right calf,[138] Durant returned to action in game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals against Toronto, and scored 11 points in the first quarter.[139] However, he was lost for the game two minutes into the second quarter when he tried to drive by former teammate Serge Ibaka and suffered an Achilles tendon injury, falling and grabbing his lower right calf. He limped off the court and was helped to the locker room.

In recognition of his performances, Durant was named the 2016 co-USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year, along with Carmelo Anthony, for the second time in his career.[231]\n\n\nDurant committed to playing on the 2020 Olympic team, delayed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[232] He entered the Games ranked second in U.S. men's Olympic basketball history with 311 career points,[233] needing 25 to match Anthony's record of 336.[234][235] Durant broke Anthony's record on July 31 against the Czech Republic.[236] He led Team USA to a gold medal, and FIBA named him the tournament's MVP.[237] Durant's 20.7 points per game set a U.S. Olympic men's single-competition record for points averaged, and he tied Carmelo Anthony for most Olympic gold medals (three). He is also one of just four U.S. male basketball athletes to play in three or more Olympics.[238][239] In recognition of his accomplishments in the tournament, Durant was named 2021 USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year for the third time in his career.[240]\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2021, Durant played with the senior men's United States national team in 31 official games, in major FIBA tournaments, averaging 20.4 points, 5.4 rebounds and 3.1 assists. Overall, he brought home four gold medals as member of the national team: three from Olympic tournaments and one from the 2010 FIBA World Championship.[241] Durant, who has led the US in scoring in all three of his Olympic appearances and at the 2010 FIBA World Championship, owns eight U.S. Olympic men's career records, including the top spot for points (435), points averaged (19.8), field goals made (146) and attempted (276), 3-point field goals made (74) and attempted (148) and free throws made (69) and attempted (80).[242]\n\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant playing in a game between the Drew League and the Goodman League in August 2011\nDurant's height is officially 6\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in (2.11\u00a0m) and his primary position is small forward. In December 2016, Durant stated that his height in shoes was actually 7\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in (2.13\u00a0m) and that he understated his height in order to be listed as a small forward, rather than a power forward.[243] His career averages are 27.3 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 4.3 assists per game.[5] Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,[244][245][246][247] Durant has earned All-NBA honors ten times (2010\u20132014, 2016\u20132019, 2022) and was voted rookie of the year in his debut season.[5] He has also won an MVP Award and finished second in the voting three times, a trend that he has expressed frustration over.[248][249][250][251]\n\n\nDurant is best known for his prodigious scoring ability.[252] From 2010 to 2014, he won four scoring titles, becoming one of only two players to win four scoring titles in a five-year span.[253] Early in his career, his playing style was isolation-driven, but he quickly developed into an excellent off-ball player who was capable of scoring from the outside as well.[254] By 2013, he was shooting at a historically great clip, which helped him become one of only nine members of the 50\u201340\u201390 club.[255] This ability to impact the offense in a variety of ways helped Durant remain effective and improve an already elite offense upon joining the Warriors in 2016.[254] Throughout his career, his height and 7\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (2.24\u00a0m) wingspan have created matchup problems for defenses as he is able to get off a clean shot regardless of the situation.[256][257] Upon beating his man or gaining momentum, he also becomes a strong finisher at the rim; for example, he converted 72.2% of shots in the paint in 2012.[252]\n\n\nEarly in Durant's career, he was criticized for his slim build, defense, and passing.[258] Over time, he grew as a playmaker, increasing his assist numbers every year from 2010 to 2014,[256] though his overall vision still lagged behind the league's best passers'.[254] He also showed defensive improvement, with opponents averaging just .62 points per isolation play against him in 2014, the best success rate for defensive players who faced at least 100 isolations that season.[259] Upon going to Golden State, he developed into a more reliable off-ball defender and rim protector, and in 2018 was considered for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.[260]\n\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant during a flag football game at Oklahoma State University in 2011\nDurant is very close with his mother, Wanda, a relationship that was detailed in the Lifetime movie *The Real MVP: The Wanda Pratt Story*.[261] During his time with the Thunder, Durant described himself as a \"high school kid\" who enjoys playing video games in his spare time.[262] Durant is a Christian who attended Baptist schools.[263][264] He has religious tattoos on his stomach,[265] wrist,[263] and back.[266] He owns several properties in the Oklahoma City area and listed his primary residence, located in the affluent Club Villa neighborhood, for sale for $1.95 million in 2013.[267] That same year, he opened a restaurant, KD's Southern Cuisine, in the Bricktown neighborhood and briefly became engaged to Monica Wright, a WNBA player.[268][269][270] In 2016, he was a credentialed photographer for *The Players' Tribune* at Super Bowl 50.[271][272]\n\n\nDurant was formerly represented by agents Aaron Goodwin and Rob Pelinka.[273][274] He left Pelinka in 2013 and signed with the Roc Nation group, headed by Jay-Z.[274][275] Durant has endorsement deals with Nike, Sprint, Gatorade, Panini, General Electric, and 2K Sports.[276] In 2012, he tried his hand at acting, appearing in the children's film *Thunderstruck*.[277] In 2013, he earned $35 million, making him the fourth-highest-earning basketball player that year.[278] In an interview with *Sports Illustrated*, Durant claimed that, despite his high earnings potential, \"global marketing and all that stuff\" does not interest him.[276]\n\n\nOne of the most popular players in the league, Durant's jersey regularly ranks as one of the NBA's best-selling and he is consistently one of the top All-Star vote-getters.[279][280] Early in his career, he developed a reputation for his kind demeanor; in 2013, Foot Locker released a series of commercials calling him the \"nicest guy in the NBA\",[281] and become a beloved figure in Oklahoma City, known for his \"nice escapades\" toward the Thunder's staff.[282] In 2014, he partnered with KIND snacks and launched StrongAndKind.com to show \"being kind is not a sign of weakness.\"[283] Since joining the Warriors, he has become more outspoken and controversial; for example, he was involved in a Twitter back-and-forth with CJ McCollum in July 2018.[284] Durant has admitted to feeling more genuine in Golden State as opposed to Oklahoma City, where he was \"just trying to please everybody\".[285] He's very active on Twitter,[286] often engaging in chippy comments with fans and members of the media.[287]\n\n\nThroughout his career, Durant has participated in philanthropic causes. In 2013, he pledged $1 million to the American Red Cross for the victims of the 2013 Moore tornado.[288] His generosity inspired the Thunder and Nike to match his donation.[289] He is also a spokesperson for the Washington, D.

In February, he visited YouTube's headquarters for a speaking engagement.[291] On April 7, 2017, he created a YouTube account and soon began to upload live stream vlogs onto it.[292][293] In his first vlog, he detailed, \"I'm so excited because I got off social media. I got off the Instagram, Twitter, all that stuff, just to distance myself a bit. But somebody talked me into getting on the YouTube.\"[293] As of June 2020, Durant's YouTube channel has received over 790,000 subscribers and 38 million video views.[292] On February 13, 2018, *Deadline* reported that Durant, in partnership with producer Brian Grazer's Imagine Television, will create a basketball-themed scripted drama for Apple.[294]\n\n\nIn 2017, Durant and business partner Rich Kleiman founded Thirty Five Ventures.[295][296][297][298] In 2020, Thirty Five Ventures produced *Basketball County*, a documentary about youth basketball in Durant's home county of Prince George's County, Maryland. Durant served as an executive producer and appeared in interviews.[299] Thirty Five Ventures' work *Two Distant Strangers* won the 2021 Academy Award for Short Film (Live Action).[300][301]\n\n\nDurant was included in *Time* magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2018.[302]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2020, Durant became a minority owner of MLS side Philadelphia Union, acquiring a 5% stake with the possibility to add another 5% in the near future.[303]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Durant announced a partnership between his multimedia company Boardroom and the cannabis technology company Weedmaps through which an original content series would be developed and Weedmaps would become an official sponsor of Boardroom.[304][305] Durant said of the partnership: \"I think it's far past time to address the stigmas around cannabis that still exist in the sports world as well as globally. This partnership is going to help us continue to normalize those conversations, as well as create content, events, and a lot more through our Boardroom media network.\"[306]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Durant (through Thirty Five Ventures) was announced as an investor in Just Women's Sports, an American media platform dedicated to women's sports. Durant credited the platform with showing \"fans exactly how good these players are and why they're worth watching.\"[307]\n\n\nOn December 22, 2021, he had signed a deal with Coinbase to serve as a brand ambassador.[308]\n\n\nIn October 2022, Durant joined fellow professional athletes LeBron James, Tom Brady, and Drew Brees as an investor in a professional pickleball team with his business partner, Rich Kleiman, via their Thirty Five Ventures (35V) firm.[309][310]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n | \u00a0\u00a0GS\u00a0\n | Games

Nicknamed \"**the Hick from French Lick**\" and \"**Larry Legend**\", Bird is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time. He is the only person in NBA history to be named Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player, Finals MVP, All-Star MVP, Coach of the Year, and Executive of the Year.[1]\n\n\nGrowing up in French Lick, Indiana, he was a local basketball star. Highly recruited, he initially signed to play college basketball for coach Bob Knight of the Indiana Hoosiers, but Bird dropped out after one month and returned to French Lick and attended a local college. The next year he attended Indiana State University, ultimately playing three years for the Sycamores. Drafted by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft after his second year at Indiana State, Bird elected to stay in college and returned for the 1978\u201379 season. He then led his team to an undefeated regular season. The season finished with a national championship game match-up of Indiana State against Michigan State and featured a highly anticipated match-up of Bird against Michigan State great Magic Johnson, thus beginning a career-long rivalry that the two shared for over a decade. Michigan State won, ending the Sycamores' undefeated streak.\n\n\nBird entered the NBA for the 1979\u201380 season, where he made an immediate impact, starting at power forward and leading the Celtics to a 32-win improvement over the previous season before being eliminated from the playoffs in the conference finals. He played for the Celtics during his entire professional career (13 seasons), leading them to five NBA finals appearances and three NBA championships. He played most of his career with forward Kevin McHale and center Robert Parish, considered by some to be the greatest front court in NBA history.[2] Bird was a 12-time NBA All-Star, won two NBA Finals MVP awards and received the NBA Most Valuable Player Award three consecutive times (1984\u20131986), making him the only forward in league history to do so. Bird was also a member of the gold medal-winning 1992 U.S. Olympic basketball team, known as the \"Dream Team\". He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame twice as a player\u2014first in 1998 as an individual, and again in 2010 as a member of the \"Dream Team\". He was voted onto the NBA's 50 Greatest Players in NBA History list in 1996, and subsequently the 75th Anniversary Team list in 2021.[3]\n\n\nA versatile player at both forward positions, he could play both inside and outside, being one of the first players in the league to take advantage of the newly adopted three-point line. Bird was rated the greatest NBA small forward of all time by Fox Sports in 2016.[4] After retiring as a player, Bird served as head coach of the Indiana Pacers from 1997 to 2000. He was named NBA Coach of the Year for the 1997\u201398 season and later led the Pacers to a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals. In 2003, Bird was named president of basketball operations for the Pacers, holding the position until retiring in 2012.[5] He was named NBA Executive of the Year for the 2012 season. Bird returned to the Pacers as president of basketball operations in 2013,[6] and remained in that role until 2017.[7] Bird continued with the Pacers as an advisor until July 2022, then after nearly a year's break returned to the organization in the role of consultant.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBird was born in West Baden Springs, Indiana, to Georgia (n\u00e9e Kerns) and Claude Joseph \"Joe\" Bird, a veteran of the Korean War.[9] Bird's parents were of Irish, Scottish and some Native American descent.[10] He has four brothers and a sister.[11]\n\n\nHe was raised in nearby French Lick, where his mother worked two jobs to support Larry and his five siblings.[12] Bird has said that being poor as a child still motivates him \"to this day\".[13] Georgia and Joe divorced when Larry was in high school, and Joe died by suicide about a year later.[14]\n\n\nLarry used basketball as an escape from his family troubles, starring for Springs Valley High School and averaging 31 points, 21 rebounds, and 4 assists as a senior on his way to becoming the school's all-time scoring leader.[9][15] According to Bird, he grew up as a huge fan of the Indiana Pacers in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the 6'9 center Mel Daniels, who represented his first exposure to professional basketball.[16] Bird's youngest brother, Eddie Bird, also played basketball at Indiana State University, where Daniels would coincidentally become an assistant coach to the young Larry once he played there.[11]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![Bird in a basketball uniform, having just shot a ball](image)Bird warming up for Indiana State\nBird received a scholarship to play college basketball for the Indiana Hoosiers under head coach Bob Knight in 1974.[17] After less than a month on the Indiana University campus he dropped out of school, finding the adjustment between his small hometown and the large student population of Bloomington to be overwhelming.[9] He returned to French Lick, enrolling at Northwood Institute (now Northwood University) in nearby West Baden, and working municipal jobs for a year before enrolling at Indiana State University in Terre Haute in 1975.[18][19][20] He had a successful three-year career with the Sycamores, helping them reach the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history with a 33\u20130 record where they played the 1979 championship game against Michigan State.[21][22] Indiana State lost the game 75\u201364, with Bird scoring 19 points but making only 7 of 21 shots.[9]\n\n\nThe game achieved the highest-ever television rating for a college basketball game, in large part because of the matchup between Bird and Spartans' point guard Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson,[12] a rivalry that lasted throughout their professional careers. Despite failing to win the championship, Bird earned numerous year-end awards and honors for his outstanding play, including the Naismith College Player of the Year Award.[22] For his college career, he averaged 30.3 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game,[23] leading the Sycamores to an 81\u201313 record during his tenure.[22] Bird also appeared in one game for the baseball team, going 1-for-2 with 2 RBI.[24] He graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education.[25]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (1979\u20131992)[edit]\n\n\n#### Joining the Celtics (1978\u20131979)[edit]\n\n\nBird was selected by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft.[23] He did not sign with the Celtics immediately; instead, he played out his final season at Indiana State and led the Sycamores to the NCAA title game. Celtics general manager Red Auerbach publicly stated that he would not pay Bird more than any Celtic on the current roster, but Bird's agent Bob Woolf told Auerbach that Bird would reject any sub-market offers and simply enter the 1979 draft instead, where Boston's rights would expire when the draft began on June 25, and Bird would have been the likely top pick. After protracted negotiations, Bird inked a five-year, $3.25 million contract with the team on June 8, making him the highest-paid rookie in sports history.[26][15][27] Shortly afterwards, NBA draft eligibility rules were changed to prevent teams from drafting players before they were ready to sign, a rule known as the Bird Collegiate Rule.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Early success (1979\u20131983)[edit]\n\n\n![A box score with Bird's numbers highlighted](image)Bird recorded 14 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in his NBA debut against the Houston Rockets on October 12, 1979.\nIn his rookie season (1979\u201380), Bird immediately transformed the Celtics into a title contender. The team improved its win total by 32 games from the year before he was drafted and finished first in the Eastern Conference.[28][29] In his career debut, Bird recorded 14 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists in a 114\u2013106 win over the Houston Rockets.[30] On November 14, 1979, Bird recorded his first career triple-double with 23 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists in a 115\u2013111 win over the Detroit Pistons.[31] On November 23, Bird recorded his first 30-point scoring game (along with 11 rebounds and 3 assists) in a 118\u2013103 win over the Indiana Pacers.[32]\n\n\nWith averages of 21.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, 4.5 assists, and 1.7 steals per game for the season, he was selected to the All-Star Team and named Rookie of the Year.[23] In the Conference finals, Boston was eliminated by the Philadelphia 76ers.[29]\n\n\nBefore the 1980\u201381 season, the Celtics selected forward Kevin McHale in the draft and acquired center Robert Parish from the Golden State Warriors,[33][34] forming a Hall of Fame trio for years to come; the front-court of Bird, McHale, and Parish is regarded as one of the greatest front-courts in NBA history.[35][36][37] Behind Bird's leadership and Boston's upgraded roster, the Celtics again advanced to the conference finals for a rematch with the 76ers.[38] Boston fell behind 3\u20131 to start the series but won the next three games to advance to the Finals against the Houston Rockets,[39] winning in six games and earning Bird his first championship.[38] He averaged 21.9 points, 14 rebounds, 6.1 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the postseason and 15.3 points, 15.3 rebounds, and 7 assists per game for the Finals.[23][40]\n\n\nAt the 1982 All-Star Game, Bird scored 19 points en route to winning the All-Star Game MVP Award.[41] At the conclusion of the season, he earned his first All-Defensive Team selection.[23] He eventually finished runner-up in Most Valuable Player Award voting to Moses Malone.[41] In the Conference finals, the Celtics faced the 76ers for the third consecutive year, losing in seven games.[42] Boston's misfortunes continued into the next season, with Bird again finishing second in MVP voting to Malone and the team losing in the conference semifinals to the Milwaukee Bucks.[41][43]\n\n\n\n#### MVP threepeat (1983\u20131986)[edit]\n\n\n![Bird jumping into a layup](image)Bird playing for the Celtics in a game against the Washington Bullets\nBird was named MVP of the 1983\u201384 season with averages of 24.2 points, 10.1 rebounds, 6.6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game.[23] In the playoffs, the Celtics avenged their loss from the year before to the Bucks, winning in five games in the conference finals to advance to the Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers.[44] In Game Four, the Lakers\u2014led by Bird's college rival Magic Johnson\u2014were on the verge of taking a commanding 3\u20131 series lead before a flagrant foul was committed on Kurt Rambis that resulted in a brawl and caused the Lakers to lose their composure.[45] Boston came back to win the game, eventually winning the series in seven.[44] Bird was named Finals MVP behind 27.4 points, 14 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game.[44]\n\n\nOn December 9, 1984, Bird recorded 48 points to go along with 14 rebounds and 5 assists in a 128\u2013127 win over the Atlanta Hawks.[46] On March 12 of the 1984\u201385 season, Bird scored a career-high and franchise record 60 points in a game against the Atlanta Hawks.[47] The performance came just nine days after Kevin McHale set the previous Celtics record for points in a game with 56.[48] At the conclusion of the year, Bird was named MVP for the second consecutive season, behind averages of 28.7 points, 10.5 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game.[23] Boston advanced through the playoffs to earn a rematch with the Lakers, this time losing in six games.[49]\n\n\nDuring the 1985 offseason, Bird injured his back shoveling crushed rock to create a driveway at his mother's house. At least partially as a result of this, he experienced back problems for the remainder of his career.[50]\n\n\n\n![Bird holding a basketball, aiming to shoot](image)Bird playing for the Celtics in the 1985 NBA playoffs\nBefore the start of the 1985\u201386 season, the Celtics made a daring trade for Bill Walton, an All-Star center with a history of injury.[51] The risk paid off; Walton's acquisition helped Boston win a league best 67 games.[52] One of Bird's career highlights occurred at the 1986 NBA All-Star Weekend when he walked into the locker room at the inaugural Three-Point Shootout and asked who was going to finish second before winning the shootout.[53][54]\n\n\nOn November 27, 1985, Bird recorded 47 points to go along with 12 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals in a 132\u2013124 win over the Detroit Pistons.[55] On March 10, 1986, Bird scored 50 points to go along with 11 rebounds and 5 assists in a 115\u2013116 loss to the Dallas Mavericks.[56]\n\n\nWith averages of 25.8 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists, and 2 steals per game, Bird became just the third player in NBA history to win three consecutive MVP Awards.[57] In the playoffs, the Celtics lost only one game through the first three rounds en route to a match-up against the Rockets in the Finals.[51] In Game 6 of the Finals series, Bird recorded a triple-double of 29 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists as the Celtics won the Finals series 4 games to 2 against the Rockets.[58] Bird averaged 24 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 9.5 assists per game for the championship round.[59]\n\n\nThe '86 Celtics are commonly ranked as one of the greatest basketball teams of all time, with the *Boston Globe*'s Peter May and Grantland's Bill Simmons listing them at number one.[60]\n\n\n\n#### Falling short (1986\u20131988)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1987, the Celtics made their last Finals appearance of Bird's career, fighting through difficult series against the Milwaukee Bucks and Detroit Pistons. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Pistons, with five seconds remaining in the fourth quarter and Boston trailing the Pistons 107\u2013106, Bird stole an inbound pass. Falling out of bounds, Bird turned and passed the ball to teammate Dennis Johnson, who converted a game-winning 2-point layup with less than a second left. The dramatic play saved the series for the Celtics. When they reached the NBA Finals, the Celtics lost to a dominant Lakers team that had won 65 games during the season. The Celtics ended up losing to the Lakers in six games, with Bird averaging 24.2 points on .445 shooting, 10 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game in the championship series.[61] The Celtics fell short in 1988 losing to the Detroit Pistons in 6 games in the Eastern Conference finals as the Pistons made up from the heartbreak the previous season. Between them, Bird and Johnson captured eight NBA championships during the 1980s, with Magic getting five and Bird three. During the 1980s, either Boston or Los Angeles appeared in every NBA Finals.[62]\n\n\nThroughout the 1980s, contests between the Celtics and the Lakers\u2014both during the regular season and in the Finals\u2014attracted enormous television audiences. The first regular-season game between the Celtics and the Lakers in the 1987\u201388 season proved to be a classic with Magic Johnson banking in an off-balance shot from near the three-point line at the buzzer for a 115\u2013114 Lakers win at Boston Garden.[63] The historical rift between the teams, which faced each other several times in championship series of the 1960s, fueled fan interest in the rivalry. Not since Bill Russell squared off against Wilt Chamberlain had professional basketball enjoyed such a marquee matchup.[*citation needed*] The apparent contrast between the two players and their respective teams seemed scripted for television, as they were polar opposites in nearly every way conceivable. Bird was white, Johnson was black; Bird was an introvert from a small town playing in blue-collar Boston, while Johnson was the gregarious personification of the glitz and glamour of Los Angeles; Bird's Celtics played gritty, physical, defence-first basketball, whereas Johnson ran the Lakers' fast-paced Showtime offense. A 1980s Converse commercial for its \"Weapon\" line of basketball shoes (endorsed by both Bird and Johnson) reflected the perceived dichotomy between the two players. In the commercial, Bird is practicing alone on a rural basketball court (in reality the court was one Bird had made on the property in French Lick that he had purchased for his mother), when Johnson pulls up in a sleek limousine and challenges him to a one-on-one match.[64]\n\n\nDespite the intensity of their rivalry, Bird and Johnson became friends off the court. Their friendship blossomed when the two players worked together to film the Converse commercial, which depicted them as archenemies. Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony on February 4, 1993, and emotionally described Bird as a \"friend forever\".[65]\n\n\n\n#### Late career (1988\u20131992)[edit]\n\n\nThe 1987\u201388 season was the highest-scoring season of Bird's career. In Game 7 of the 1988 Eastern Conference semifinals against the Atlanta Hawks, Bird shot 9 of 10 from the floor in the fourth quarter, scoring 20 points in that quarter and lifting the Celtics to a series-clinching victory over Atlanta.[66][67][68] Bird finished with 34 points. His effort helped to overcome a 47-point performance by Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins.[69] Wilkins remarked, \"The basket was like a well. I couldn't miss. He couldn't miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I've ever played in or seen played.\" The Celtics failed to reach the NBA Finals for the first time in five years, losing to the Pistons in six games during the Eastern Conference finals.\n\n\nBird's 1988\u201389 season ended after six games when he had bone spurs surgically removed from both of his heels.[70] He returned to the Celtics in 1989, but debilitating back problems and an aging Celtic roster prevented him from regaining his mid-1980s form. Nonetheless, during the final years of his career, Bird maintained his status as one of the premier players in the game. In his final three seasons with the Celtics, Bird averaged over 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists per game, shot better than 45% from the field, and led the Celtics to playoff appearances.\n\n\nAfter leading the Celtics to a 29\u20135 start to the 1990\u201391 season, Bird missed 22 games due to a compressed nerve root in his back, a condition that eventually led to his retirement. He had off-season surgery to remove a disc from his back, but his back problems continued and he missed 37 games during the 1991\u201392 season. During the 1992 Eastern Conference semi-finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Bird missed four of the seven games due to recurring back problems.\n\n\nDuring Bird's final two seasons when he had serious back problems, the Celtics went 71\u201328 when he played. Without Bird, they had a 30\u201329 record, further demonstrating his importance and game-changing ability while on the court.[71][72][73][74]\n\n\nOn August 18, 1992, Bird announced his retirement.[75] Following Bird's departure, the Celtics promptly retired his jersey number 33.\n\n\n\n## Rivalry with Magic Johnson[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bird's rivalry with Magic Johnson *(pictured)* is often credited with popularizing the NBA.\nLarry Bird and Magic Johnson are known to be \"one of the greatest rivalries in sports.\"[76] Their rivalry began in college, when Larry Bird and Indiana State lost to Magic Johnson and Michigan State in the NCAA Championship game. Their rivalry continued on in the revived Celtics\u2013Lakers Rivalry in the NBA. Either the Celtics, led by Bird, or the Lakers, led by Magic, were present in every NBA Finals series in the '80s, with Bird and Magic meeting three times. Magic got the upper hand against Bird, beating him in 1985 and 1987, while Bird beat Magic in 1984.[77]\n\n\nJournalists speculated that Bird and Magic represented different contrasts, such as clashes between Celtics and Lakers, between East and West, and between Blacks and Whites. But, as one journalist would say, \u201cThey looked different, perhaps, but take a chainsaw to their souls and they were fraternal, if not identical, friends.\u201d[78] Watching Bird play was like watching Magic play, as they both shared this talent that the league had never seen before. They each had charisma, deft shooting touch, extraordinary passing skills, and team-oriented mindset that ignited their team and the crowd.[79] This style of play was starting to influence a new horde of fans as they would sit and \u201cmarvel at what they [Bird and Magic] can do\u201d while giving younger kids \u201ca different perspective of the game\u201d.[80]\n\n\nBird and Magic's presence on the court was only a small part of their contribution to basketball, as their rivalry changed the landscape of the NBA, transforming it from a \u201cstruggling, barely profitable league into a highly visible, financial and marketing dream for teams and players alike\u201d.[76] Many people realized that the emergence of these two stars were linked with the rise in popularity of the NBA, as the NBA started to market towards these two stars.[76]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Bird joined Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, and other NBA stars to play for the United States men's national basketball team in that year's Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.[81] It was the first time in the United States' Olympic history that the country sent NBA players to compete. The \"Dream Team\" won the men's basketball gold medal. In eight games, Bird averaged 8.4 points.[82] The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame called the team \"the greatest collection of basketball talent on the planet\".[83]\n\n\n\n## Player profile and legacy[edit]\n\n\nBird was voted onto the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team list in 1996,[84][85] and inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998.[86][87] He was inducted into the Hall of Fame again in 2010, as a member of the \"Dream Team\".[88] In 1999, Bird ranked No. 30 on ESPN SportsCentury's list of 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th century. He played both the small forward and power forward positions.[89] Universally recognized as an all-time great player, Bird was placed at the power forward position on an NBA all-time starting five roster with fellow superstars Magic Johnson (point guard), Michael Jordan (shooting guard), LeBron James (small forward), and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (center) in 2020.[90]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"Larry, you only told me one lie. You said there will be another Larry Bird. Larry, there will never, ever be another Larry Bird.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n-Magic Johnson, as quoted at Bird's retirement party.[91]\n\nBird has been described as one of the greatest basketball players and greatest shooters of all time.[92][93][94] He was selected to 12 NBA All-Star teams.[95] Bird won three NBA championships (in 1981, 1984, and 1986) with the Celtics[89] and won two NBA Finals MVP Awards.[96] Bird won three consecutive regular season MVP awards; as of 2020, the only other players to accomplish this feat are Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain.[97] Bird was also a four-time regular season MVP runner-up in 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1988.[98] Bird is also remembered as one of the foremost clutch performers in the history of the NBA; he was known for his excellent play in high-stakes, high-pressure situations.[99][100][101] In October 2021, as part of the NBA's 75th Anniversary, Bird was honored as one of the 75 greatest players of all time, by being named to the NBA's 75th Anniversary All-Time Team.[3] To commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Bird as the 7th greatest player in NBA history.[102]\n\n\nBird scored 24.3 points per game in his career on a .496 field goal percentage, an .886 free throw percentage, and a .376 percentage on three-point shots. Bird had an average of 10.0 rebounds per game for his career and 6.3 assists.[103] Bird was the first player in NBA history to shoot 50% or better on field goals, 40% on three-pointers, and 90% on free-throws in a single NBA season while achieving the league minimum for makes in each category.[104] He accomplished this feat twice.[105] Bird won NBA three-point-shooting contests in three consecutive years.[106] He sometimes practiced shooting three-point shots with his eyes closed.[103]\n\n\nBird is also remembered as an excellent passer[107] and defender.[89] While he was relatively slow, Bird displayed a knack for anticipating the moves of his opponent, making him a strong team defender.[92] He had 1,556 career steals.[108] In recognition of his defensive abilities, Bird was named to three All-Defensive Second Teams.[92]\n\n\nBird was widely considered one of Red Auerbach's favorite players. He considered Bird to be the greatest basketball player of all time.[109] Bird's humble roots were the source of his most frequently used moniker, \"The Hick from French Lick\".[110] Bird was also referred to as \"Larry Legend\".[111]\n\n\nBird was known for his trash-talking on the court and is remembered as one of the most notable trash-talkers of his era.[112][113] He was known for telling his opponents how and where in the court he would score against them; Xavier McDaniel recounted that Bird predicted a game-winning shot against him, then \"shot a shot right in my face and was like 'Damn, I didn't mean to leave two seconds on the clock.'\"[114] When playing against Dennis Rodman, a player known for his defensive abilities, in the 1987 Eastern Conference finals, Bird continually belittled Rodman's ability, at one point asking Chuck Daly, Detroit's head coach, to send in someone up to the task of guarding him.[115]\n\n\nAt the 2019 NBA Awards, Bird received the NBA Lifetime Achievement Award (shared with Magic Johnson).[116] Since 2022, the NBA will award the MVPs for the conference finals; the Eastern Conference Finals MVP trophy is named in Bird's honor, while the Western Conference trophy is named after Johnson.[117]\n\n\n\n## Coaching and executive careers[edit]\n\n\n![Bronzed shoes on a plaque with text describing Bird's basketball accomplishments](image)A Larry Bird plaque at Quincy Market, Boston\nThe Celtics employed Bird as a special assistant in the team's front office from 1992 until 1997.[118] In 1997, Bird accepted the position of coach of the Indiana Pacers[119] and said he would be on the job for no more than three years.[120] Despite having no previous coaching experience, Bird led the Pacers to a 58\u201324 record\u2014the franchise's best as an NBA team at the time\u2014in the 1997\u201398 season,[121] and pushed the Chicago Bulls to seven games in the Eastern Conference finals.[121] He was named the NBA Coach of the Year for his efforts.[122] Bird then led the Pacers to consecutive Central Division titles in 1999 and 2000 and a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals.[121] Bird resigned his head coaching position shortly after the end of the 2000 season, following through on his initial promise to coach for only three years.[123]\n\n\nIn 2003, Bird was hired as the Indiana Pacers' president of basketball operations.[124] After the 2011\u20132012 NBA season, Bird was named NBA Executive of the Year, becoming the only man in NBA history to win the NBA MVP, Coach of the Year and Executive of the Year.[125] On June 27, 2012, a day before the 2012 NBA draft, Bird and the Pacers announced that they would be parting ways; Bird said that health issues were among the reasons for his departure.[126] Bird returned to the Pacers as president of basketball operations in 2013.[6] He stepped down again in 2017, but stayed with the team in an advisory capacity.[127] He continued to serve as an advisor until July 2022, when he \"stepped back from maintaining an active role with the Indiana Pacers\".[128] Nearly a year later, it was announced in June 2023 the Pacers re-hired Bird to serve as a consultant.[8]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n**NBA**\n\n\n\n* 3\u00d7 NBA champion (1981, 1984, 1986)\n* 2\u00d7 NBA Finals MVP (1984, 1986)\n* 3\u00d7 NBA Most Valuable Player (1984\u20131986)\n* 12\u00d7 NBA All-Star (1980\u20131988, 1990\u20131992)\n* NBA All-Star Game MVP (1982)\n* 9\u00d7 All-NBA First Team (1980\u20131988)\n* All-NBA Second Team (1990)\n* 3\u00d7 NBA All-Defensive Second Team (1982\u20131984)\n* NBA Rookie of the Year (1980)\n* NBA All-Rookie First Team (1980)\n* 3\u00d7 Three-point Shootout champion (1986\u20131988)\n* Named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996\n* Selected on the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021[129]\n* No. 33 retired by Boston Celtics\n* Trophy named in Bird's honor (Larry Bird Trophy) awarded to Eastern Conference finals MVP (established in 2022)[130]\n* NBA All-Star Game head coach (1998)\n* NBA Coach of the Year (1998)\n* NBA Executive of the Year (2012)\n\n\n**USA Basketball**\n\n\n\n* 1992 Olympic gold medal (U.S. national team)[131]\n\n\n**NCAA**\n\n\n\n* John R.

In *One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird*, Bird plays opposite Julius Erving in a game of one-on-one. A sequel, *Jordan vs Bird: One on One*, was a 1988 basketball video game. In 2011, Bird was featured on the cover of *NBA 2K12*, alongside Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan. Bird is also a playable character in the revamped *NBA Jam*.[136]\n* In a McDonald's commercial from 1991 (first aired during the Super Bowl), Bird and Michael Jordan have a trick shot contest, in which the winner got Jordan's lunch and the loser had to watch the winner eat. In a commercial during Super Bowl XLIV, Dwight Howard and LeBron James challenge each other at trick shots for a McDonald's lunch. After they finish, clapping is heard, then the camera pans to the crowd, and Bird says \"Great show, guys. Thanks for lunch.\" Howard and James share a confused look. Howard asks, \"Who was that?\" James replies, \"I have no idea.\"[137]\n* Until July 2023, Twitter's logo was named Larry in honor of Larry Bird.[138][139][140]\n* Larry Bird is a character in the HBO series *Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty*.\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1975, Bird married Janet Condra. They remained married for less than a year. Following an attempted reconciliation, Bird and Condra had a daughter, Corrie, in 1977.[141]\n\n\nBird married Dinah Mattingly in 1989. They have two adopted children, Conner and Mariah.[141]\n\n\nDuring his professional career with the Celtics, Bird lived in the Boston suburb of Brookline, Massachusetts.[142]\n\n\n\n## Career

He played 14 seasons as a forward in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers. Baylor was a gifted shooter, a strong rebounder, and an accomplished passer, who was best known for his trademark hanging jump shot. The No. 1 draft pick in 1958, NBA Rookie of the Year in 1959, 11-time NBA All-Star, and a 10-time member of the All-NBA first team, Baylor is regarded as one of the game's all-time greatest players.[1] In 1977, Baylor was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[2] In 1996, Baylor was named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.[3] In October 2021, Baylor was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team.[4]\n\n\nBaylor spent 22 years as general manager of the Los Angeles Clippers, having managed the team for the majority of the Donald Sterling ownership period. He won the NBA Executive of the Year Award in 2006. Two years later, the Clippers relieved him of his executive duties shortly before the 2008\u201309 season began.[5]\n\n\nHis popularity led to appearances on the television series *Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In* in 1968; the Jackson 5's first TV special in 1971; a *Buck Rogers in the 25th Century* episode \"Olympiad\"; and an episode of *The White Shadow* titled \"If Your Number's Up, Get Down\".\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nElgin \"Rabbit\" Baylor was born in Washington, D.C., on September 16, 1934,[6][7] the son of Uzziel (Lewis) and John Wesley Baylor.[8] He began playing basketball when he was 14.[9] Although he grew up near a D.C. city recreation center, African Americans were banned from using the facilities, and Baylor had limited access to basketball courts growing up.[10] He had two basketball-playing brothers, Sal and Kermit.[11] After stints at Southwest Boys Club and Brown Jr. High, Baylor was a three-time All-City player in high school.[12]\n\n\nBaylor played his first two years of high school basketball at Phelps Vocational High School in the 1951 and 1952 seasons. At the time, public schools in Washington, D.C., were segregated, so he only played against other black high school teams. There, Baylor set his first area scoring record of 44 points, versus Cardozo H.S.[12] During his two All-City years at Phelps, he averaged 18.5 and 27.6 points per season.[12] He did not perform well academically and dropped out of school (1952\u201353) to work in a furniture store and play basketball in the local recreational leagues.[12]\n\n\nBaylor reappeared for the 1954 season as a senior playing for the recently opened all-black Spingarn High School. The 6\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in (1.96\u00a0m),[7] 225\u00a0lb (102\u00a0kg)[13] senior was named first-team Washington All-Metropolitan, and was the first African-American player named to that team.[9] Baylor also won the SSA's Livingstone Trophy as the area's best basketball player for 1954. He finished with a 36.1 average for his eight Interhigh Division II league games.[12]\n\n\nOn February 3, 1954, in a game against his old Phelps team, Baylor scored 31 in the first half. Playing with four fouls the entire second half, Baylor scored 32 more points to establish a new DC-area record with 63 points. This broke the point record of 52 that Western's Jim Wexler had set the year before when he broke Baylor's previous record of 44. However, because Wexler was white and Baylor was black, Baylor's record did not receive the same press coverage from the media, including the *Washington Post*, as Wexler's.[12][10]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baylor at Seattle\nDespite his success as a high school basketball player, no major college recruited Baylor because at the time, college scouts did not recruit at black high schools.[6] While some colleges were willing to accept Baylor, he did not qualify academically.[9] A friend of Baylor's who attended the College of Idaho helped arrange a football scholarship for Baylor for the 1954-55 academic year.[6][9] Baylor never played football for the school, however; instead, he was accepted to the college's basketball team without having to try out.[6] He outperformed the other players on the team that season, averaging over 31 points and 20 rebounds per game.[6][9]\n\n\nAfter the season, the College of Idaho dismissed its head basketball coach and restricted the scholarships. A Seattle car dealer interested Baylor in Seattle University, and Baylor sat out a year to play for Westside Ford, an Amateur Athletic Union team in Seattle, while establishing eligibility at Seattle.[14] The Minneapolis Lakers drafted him in the 14th round of the 1956 NBA draft, but Baylor opted to stay in school instead.[15]\n\n\nDuring the 1956\u201357 season, Baylor averaged 29.7 points per game and 20.3 rebounds per game for Seattle.[9] The next season, Baylor averaged 32.5 points per game and led the Seattle University Chieftains (now known as the Redhawks) to the NCAA championship game, Seattle's only trip to the Final Four, falling to the Kentucky Wildcats.[6][9] Following his junior season, Baylor was drafted again by the Minneapolis Lakers, with the No. 1 pick in the 1958 NBA draft, and this time he opted to leave school to join them for the 1958\u201359 NBA season.[6][16]\n\n\nOver three collegiate seasons, one at College of Idaho and two at Seattle, Baylor averaged 31.3 points per game and 19.5 rebounds per game. He led the NCAA in rebounds during the 1956\u201357 season.[17]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Minneapolis / Los Angeles Lakers (1958\u20131971)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year (1958\u20131959)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baylor standing next to teammates Jerry Chambers (center) and Jerry West (right), circa 1966\nThe Minneapolis Lakers used the No. 1 overall pick in the 1958 NBA draft to select Baylor, then convinced him to skip his senior year at SU and instead join the pro ranks. The team had been unsuccessful since the retirement of its star center George Mikan in 1954. The year prior to Baylor's arrival, the team finished 19\u201353\u00a0\u2013 the worst record in the league\u00a0\u2013 with a squad that was slow, bulky and aging. It had no permanent home arena to play in, was losing popularity, and in financial trouble. Owner Bob Short, who was ready to sell the team, believed Baylor's star athletic talents and all-around game could save the franchise. Short told the *Los Angeles Times* in a 1971 interview: \"If he had turned me down then, I would have been out of business. The club would have gone bankrupt.\"[6][18] Baylor signed with the Lakers for $20,000 per year (equivalent to $210,000 in 2023), a large sum in the NBA at the time.[9] According to basketball historian James Fisher, by virtue of his exceptional skills and his central role in the team's business plan, Baylor became the NBA's first franchise player.[6]\n\n\nBaylor immediately exceeded expectations and ultimately saved the Lakers franchise.[6] As a rookie in 1958\u201359, Baylor finished fourth in the league in scoring (24.9 points per game), third in rebounding (15.0 rebounds per game), and eighth in assists (4.1 assists per game). He scored 55 points in a single game,[9] then the third-highest mark in league history behind Joe Fulks' 63 and Mikan's 61.[19]\n\n\nOn January 16, 1959, Baylor refused to play in a road game in Charleston, West Virginia, after the hotel the team booked denied lodging to the team's three black players.[20] When a teammate tried to convince Baylor to play in the game, Baylor said, \"I'm a human being, I'm not an animal put in a cage and let out for the show.\"[7]\n\n\nBaylor won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award and led the Lakers to the NBA finals, where they lost to the Boston Celtics in the first four-game sweep in finals history,[21] kicking off the greatest rivalry in NBA history.[7][13]\n\n\n\n#### Peak years (1959\u20131965)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The cover of the Los Angeles Lakers program for \"Elgin Baylor Night\" on March 21, 1969\nIn 1960, the Lakers moved from Minnesota to Los Angeles, drafted Jerry West to play point guard, and hired Fred Schaus who was also the coach during West\u2019s college career. The duo of Baylor and West, joined in 1968 by center Wilt Chamberlain, led the Lakers to success in the Western Division throughout the 1960s.[7][13][20]\n\n\nFrom the 1960\u201361 to the 1962\u201363 seasons, Baylor averaged 34.8, 38.3, and 34.0 points per game, respectively. On November 15 of the 1960\u201361 season, Baylor set an NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks, while also grabbing 25 rebounds. In doing so, Baylor became the first NBA player to score more than 70 points in a game, breaking his own NBA record of 64 points that he had set the previous November. Baylor held the record until 1962, when Chamberlain scored 100 points.[6][7][13]\n\n\nBaylor, a United States Army Reservist, was called to active duty during the 1961\u201362 season, and being stationed at Fort Lewis in Washington, he could play for the Lakers only when on a weekend pass. He was unable to practice with the team before or during the season, and had to fly coach across the country on weekends to join the team at whichever arena they were appearing. Despite playing only 48 games that season, he still managed to score over 1,800 points, averaging 38.3 points (the highest average in NBA history by any player other than Chamberlain), 18.6 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game. Later that season, in a Game Five NBA Finals victory against the Boston Celtics, Baylor set the still-standing NBA record for points in an NBA Finals game with 61.[7] Basketball historian James Fisher described Baylor's performance that season as: \"Not bad for a part-time job.\"[6] Baylor later said he \"kind of enjoyed that season.\"[20]\n\n\n\n#### Knee injury and later seasons (1965\u20131971)[edit]\n\n\nBaylor suffered a severe knee injury during the opening game of the 1965 Western Division playoffs, which required surgery and left him unable to play in the remainder of the playoffs. Although he scored more than 24 points in each of the next four seasons despite his injury, the limitations of knee surgery at the time and the lack of meaningful rehab left him with nagging knee problems, ultimately resulting in surgery on both knees, which impaired his playing ability for the rest of his career.[7][13][20]\n\n\nBaylor played just two games in 1970\u201371 before rupturing his Achilles tendon,[9] and finally retired nine games into the subsequent 1971\u201372 season because of his nagging injuries.[13] Baylor told the press that he could no longer play at the highest level of the sport[7] and wanted to free up room on the Lakers' roster for other players.[6]\n\n\nIn 14 seasons as the Lakers' forward, Baylor helped lead the team to the NBA Finals eight times, but the team lost each time.[13] As a result of his retirement at the beginning of the season, Baylor missed two historic achievements: the Lakers' first game afterwards began an NBA record 33-game win streak, after which they won the 1972 championship.[20] The organization awarded Baylor a championship ring despite the early retirement.[7]\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1974, Baylor was hired to be an assistant coach and later the head coach for the New Orleans Jazz, but had a lackluster 86\u2013135 record and was fired following the 1978\u201379 season, shortly before the team moved to Salt Lake City, Utah.[7][13]\n\n\n\n## Executive career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1986, Baylor was hired by the Los Angeles Clippers as the team's vice president of basketball operations. He was selected as the NBA Executive of the Year in 2006.[22] During his tenure, the Clippers managed only two winning seasons and amassed a win\u2013loss record of 607\u20131153.[23] They made the playoffs only four times,[13] and won only one playoff series.[23] He stayed in that capacity for 22 years until October 2008.[7]\n\n\n\n## Later life and death[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009 Baylor filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against the Clippers, team owner Donald Sterling, team president Andy Roeser, and the NBA. He alleged that he was underpaid during his tenure with the team and then fired because of his age and race.[24][25] Baylor later dropped the racial discrimination claims in the suit.[26] In 2011, a jury decided in the Clippers' favor on Baylor's remaining claims, finding Baylor's termination was based on the team's poor performance.[13][27] However, Baylor felt vindicated when Sterling was banned for life from the NBA in 2014 after recordings of him making racist comments were publicized by the press.[7][13]\n\n\nBaylor died in a Los Angeles hospital of natural causes on March 22, 2021, aged 86.[19] He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills. He was surrounded by his wife Elaine and their daughter Krystle; two children from a previous marriage, Alan and Alison; and a sister, Gladys.[7][13]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\nBaylor was known as an all-around player, excelling at defense, offense, rebounding, and passing. At 6'5\", 225lbs, he was short for a forward even for the time period in which he played, but he had the strength to \"muscle through\" defenders, and the finesse and creativity to maneuver around them, including to rebound missed shots and score second chance points. \n\n\nBaylor was known for his superior leaping abilities that allowed him to score by staying in the air longer than defenders; Bill Russell called him \"the godfather of hang time.\"[7] He invented \"moves\" to deceive defenders, involving changing hands or changing direction, even mid-air. \n\n\nBaylor's offensive repertoire included a running bank shot and a left-handed hook shot, though he was right-handed. He had an on-court facial twitch that he used as a head fake. Baylor credited his success to a talent for jumping and the creativity to spontaneously react to the defense.[6][13]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A letter from California Governor Ronald Reagan to Elgin Baylor\nSince the beginning of his NBA career, Baylor has been considered one of the best basketball players in the world, and his reputation as one of the greatest in history has endured. Before Baylor joined the NBA in 1958, the league's play was methodical but mechanical, dominated by set jump shots and running hook shots. Baylor introduced a creative and acrobatic playing style that would later be emulated by other NBA superstars such as Julius Erving and Michael Jordan.[6][13] Bill Simmons wrote, \"Along with Russell, Elgin turned a horizontal game into a vertical one.\"[7] Baylor's skill was esteemed by his contemporaries: Oscar Robertson wrote Baylor \"was the first and original high flier\"; Bill Sharman said Baylor was \"the greatest cornerman who ever played pro basketball\"; Tom Heinsohn said, \"Baylor as forward beats out Bird, Julius Erving and everybody else\".[13]\n\n\nBaylor was the last of the great undersized forwards in a league where many guards are now his size or bigger.[28] He finished his playing days with 23,149 points, 3,650 assists and 11,463 rebounds over 846 games. His signature running bank shot, which he was able to release quickly and effectively over taller players, led him to numerous NBA scoring records, several of which still stand.[16]\n\n\nThe 71 points Baylor scored on November 15, 1960, was a record at the time; it was also a team record that would not be surpassed until Kobe Bryant scored 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in January 2006. The 61 points he scored in Game 5 of the NBA Finals in 1962 is still an NBA Finals record.[16] Over his career, he averaged 27.4 points and 4.3 assists per game. An underrated rebounder, Baylor averaged 13.5 rebounds per game during his career,[7][13] including a remarkable 19.8 rebounds per game during the 1960\u201361 season[29]\u2014a season average exceeded by only five other players in NBA history, all of whom were 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m) or taller.[30]\n\n\nA 10-time All-NBA First Team selection and 11-time NBA All-Star, Baylor was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1977.[7][13] He was named to the NBA 35th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1980, the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996 and the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. in 2009, *SLAM Magazine* ranked him number 11 among its Top 50 NBA players of all time. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Baylor as the 23rd greatest player in NBA history.[31] He is often listed as the greatest NBA player never to win a championship, although this is not technically true. Baylor was a member of the 1971-1972 Los Angeles Lakers team that won the NBA championship, and although he was not on the roster when they won the championship that year, he is still technically an NBA champion due to playing for the team at the beginning of the season. As such, Baylor was awarded a championship ring by the Lakers front office due to his leadership and contributions at the start of the season.[32][33][34]\n\n\nFifty-one years after Baylor left Seattle University, they named its basketball court in honor of him on November 19, 2009. The Redhawks now play on the Elgin Baylor Court in Seattle's KeyArena. The Redhawks also host the annual Elgin Baylor Classic. In June 2017, The College of Idaho had Baylor as one of the inaugural inductees into the school's Hall of Fame.[35]\n\n\nThe first biography of Baylor was written by *Slam* Online contributor Bijan C. Bayne in 2015, and published by Rowman and Littlefield.[36]\n\n\nOn April 6, 2018, a statue of Baylor, designed by Gary Tillery and Omri Amrany, was unveiled at the Staples Center prior to a Lakers game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.[37]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n | \u00a0\u00a0GS\u00a0\n | Games started\n | \u00a0MPG\u00a0\n | Minutes per game\n |\n| \u00a0FG%\u00a0\n | Field goal percentage\n | \u00a03P%\u00a0\n | 3-point field goal percentage\n | \u00a0FT%\u00a0\n | Free throw percentage\n |\n| \u00a0RPG\u00a0\n | Rebounds per game\n | \u00a0APG\u00a0\n | Assists per game\n | \u00a0SPG\u00a0\n | Steals per game\n |\n| \u00a0BPG\u00a0\n | Blocks per game\n | \u00a0PPG\u00a0\n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n| \u00a0\\*\u00a0\n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n\n\nElgin Baylor regular season statistics\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP\n | MPG\n | FG%\n | FT%\n | RPG\n | APG\n | PPG\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1958\u201359 | Minneapolis | 70\n | 40.8\n | .408\n | .777\n | 15.0\n | 4.1\n | 24.9\n |\n| 1959\u201360 | Minneapolis | 70\n | 41.0\n | .424\n | .732\n | 16.4\n | 3.5\n | 29.6\n |\n| 1960\u201361 | L.A.

He was drafted by the Celtics in 1962 and played with the team until his retirement in 1978. A 13-time NBA All-Star, Havlicek was named to the All-NBA First Team four times and to the All-NBA Second Team four times. He was also named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team on five occasions and to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team three times. Havlicek is known for his stamina and his hustle as well as his abilities.\n\n\nDuring his career with the Celtics, Havlicek won eight NBA championships. He is known for stealing the ball to save the game--and the Celtics' playoff hopes--near the end of Game Seven in the 1965 Eastern Conference Finals. Havlicek served as captain of the Celtics from 1969 to 1978, and was named NBA Finals MVP in 1974. Following his retirement, his number 17 jersey was retired by the Celtics. Havlicek was inducted into Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1984.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHavlicek was born in Martins Ferry, Ohio, where his parents ran a general store.[2] He was of Czech and Croatian descent, from his father and mother respectively.[3] Havlicek was a three-sport athlete at Bridgeport High School in Bridgeport, Ohio, where he was a boyhood friend of Baseball Hall of Famer Phil Niekro.[4]\n\n\n\n## Collegiate career[edit]\n\n\nHavlicek played college basketball at Ohio State University with future seven-time NBA All-Star Jerry Lucas, who was his roommate, future first-round NBA draft pick Larry Siegfried, future coaching legend Bobby Knight, and Mel Nowell, among many others. The 1960 Ohio State Buckeyes, coached by head coach Fred Taylor and assistant coaches Jack Graf and Frank Truitt, won the 1960 NCAA title.[*citation needed*] Havlicek was named as an alternate of the 1960 United States national team that competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics.[5]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\nHavlicek was drafted by both the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League in 1962. After competing briefly as a wide receiver in the Browns' training camp that year, he focused his energies on playing for the Celtics. A swingman who could play either guard or forward,[6][7][8] he was known for his stamina, with competitors stating that it was a challenge just to keep up with him.[9] Head coach Red Auerbach went on to call him \"the guts of the team\".[10] Nicknamed \"**Hondo**\" (a nickname inspired by the 1953 movie of the same name starring John Wayne),[2] Havlicek revolutionized the \"sixth man\" role in the NBA coming off the bench for the Celtics during his early years.[11][12][13]\n\n\nHavlicek was later immortalized for his clutch steal in the closing seconds of the 1965 Eastern Conference Finals. In the seventh and final game, played at Boston Garden on April 15, the Celtics led the Philadelphia 76ers 110\u2013109 with five seconds left. They only needed to inbound the ball from underneath their basket to secure the victory and advance to the 1965 NBA Finals. However, Bill Russell's pass struck one of the basket's support wires hanging down from the ceiling, leading to a turnover that gave the 76ers and Wilt Chamberlain the ball and a chance to win the game.[2] Hal Greer was set to throw the inbounds pass for the 76ers. Havlicek stood with his back to Greer, guarding Chet Walker. But as Greer's pass came inbounds, Havlicek spun, leaped, and tipped the pass to Sam Jones.[2] Veteran referee Earl Strom, who wrote about the game in his memoir *Calling the Shots*, called Havlicek's reaction one of the greatest plays he ever saw in his 32 years as a professional official.[14] Announcer Johnny Most's call of \"Havlicek stole the ball!\" was dubbed by the NBA as \"the most famous radio call in basketball history.\"[15]\n\n\nHavlicek was a key player in the Celtics' dynasty during the 1960s.[16] The team won NBA championships in six of his first seven NBA seasons.[17]\n\n\nIn Game 5 of the 1968 Eastern Division Finals, Havlicek recorded a near triple-double with 29 points, 9 rebounds, and 10 assists as the Celtics avoided elimination at the hands of the 76ers.[18] He added a strong performance in Game 7, recording 21 points, 12 rebounds, and 8 assists in a 100\u201396 road win against the 76ers. In that series, the Celtics became the first NBA team to overcome a 3\u20131 playoff series deficit.[19]\n\n\nHavlicek became a full-time starter in the 1969-1970 season.[20] He also became the Celtics' captain in 1969, and continued in that role until 1978.[21] Havlicek \"stood as the bridge from the Bill Russell era to the Celtics' next championship team\".[22] The Celtics won the 1974 NBA Championship, and Havlicek was named NBA Finals MVP.[23]\n\n\nWith one second left in the second overtime of Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals, Havlicek made a leaning, running bank shot that appeared to be the game-winner. Phoenix called an illegal timeout, resulting in a technical foul shot converted by Jo Jo White. However, Phoenix still had one final possession, and Gar Heard scored for Phoenix to tie the game. The Celtics went on to win in triple overtime, which was hailed as the greatest NBA Finals game ever played.[24]\n\n\nHavlicek retired after the 1977\u201378 NBA season at age 38.[1] In April 1978, *The Sporting News* stated: \"The consensus is that Havlicek is still better than 80 percent of the players in the NBA\".[25]\n\n\n\n### Legacy[edit]\n\n\n\"'On stamina alone, he\u2019d be among the top players who ever played the game,' longtime New York Knicks coach Red Holzman once said of John \u201cHondo\u201d Havlicek. \"'It would\u2019ve been fair to those who had to play him or those who had to coach against him if he had been blessed only with his inhuman endurance. God had to compound it by making him a good scorer, smart ballhandler and intelligent defensive player with quickness of mind, hands and feet'\".[23]\n\n\nHavlicek retired as a 13-time NBA All-Star, and his number 17 jersey was retired by the Celtics.[26] At the time, Havlicek was the NBA career leader in games played (a mark surpassed in 1984 by Elvin Hayes)[27] and was in third place on the list of all-time NBA leaders in points scored.[28] Longtime Celtics teammate Bill Russell once described Havlicek as \"'the best all-around ballplayer [he] ever saw'\".[29] At the time of his death, Havlicek was the Celtics' all-time leading scorer with 26,395 points (20.8 points per game).[30][31] He was also the first player to score 1,000 points in 16 consecutive seasons, with his best scoring season coming during the 1970\u201371 season, when he averaged 28.9 points per game.[32] He was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team five times and was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team three times.[33]\n\n\nHavlicek finished his 16-year career with eight NBA championships.[9][23] As of 2019, only Bill Russell (with 11) and Sam Jones (with 10)--both of whom were Celtics teammates of Havlicek's--had won more NBA championships than he had.[34] Havlicek won all eight NBA Finals in which he participated.[35]\n\n\nIn 1980, Havlicek was selected as one of the league's greatest players ever, being named to the NBA 35th Anniversary Team.[36] In 1984, Havlicek became a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[10] In 1996, he was selected as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History by a panel of journalists, players, coaches, executives, and general managers.[37] He was also named the 14th best player of all-time in Bill Simmons's *Book of Basketball*.[38] In October 2021, Havlicek was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[39] To commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary, *The Athletic* published their own list of the top 75 players of all time, ranking Havlicek as the 29th-greatest player in NBA history.[22]\n\n\nIn 1974, Havlicek received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[40] In 2007, Bridgeport High School in his hometown renamed their gymnasium \"John J. Havlicek Gymnasium\".[41] Fellow NBA Hall of Famer Chris Mullin wore number 17 as a tribute to Havlicek.[42] In October 2022, Havlicek was inaugurated into the Croatian-American Sports Hall of Fame.[43]\n\n\nIn addition to his on-court success, Havlicek was known for his character[44][45] and for his commitment to placing the team ahead of his own individual achievements.[46] Longtime Celtics coach Red Auerbach once said, \"'If I ever had a son, I would want him to be like John Havlicek'\".[45]\n\n\n\n## Post-NBA years[edit]\n\n\nHavlicek was shrewd with his money during his playing career, and he invested much of this income in the Wendy's fast food chain during its formative years. The success of his investments left Havlicek with a comfortable income after retirement and he never had to work for a conventional salary again. He had no desire to coach; instead, he served as a corporate speaker.[1]\n\n\nHavlicek was a member of the board of the Genesis Foundation, which assists children with disabilities and genetic disorders. He and his wife Beth held the John Havlicek Celebrity Fishing Tournament for more than three decades, with proceeds going to the foundation.[29]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHavlicek met his wife, Beth, while both were attending Ohio State University. The couple married in 1967. They had two children: a son named Chris and a daughter named Jill.[2] Chris Havlicek attended the University of Virginia on a basketball scholarship in the early 1990s.[47] Jill Havlicek married former Major League Baseball outfielder and coach Brian Buchanan.[48]\n\n\nHavlicek had Parkinson's disease during his later years.[49] He died on April 25, 2019, in Jupiter, Florida at the age of 79.[1][50][51] Following his death, Boston City Hall was lit in green in his memory.[44]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n |
