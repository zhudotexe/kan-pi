This award goes to the producers of the film and is the only category in which every member of the Academy is eligible to submit a nomination and vote on the final ballot.[1] The Best Picture category is traditionally the final award of the night and is widely considered as the most prestigious honor of the ceremony.[2][3][4]\n\n\nThe Grand Staircase columns at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the Academy Awards ceremonies have been held since 2002, showcase every film that has won the Best Picture title since the award's inception.[5] There have been 591 films nominated for Best Picture and 95 winners.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Category name changes[edit]\n\n\nAt the 1st Academy Awards ceremony held in 1929 (for films made in 1927 and 1928), there were two categories of awards that were each considered the top award of the night: \"Outstanding Picture\" and \"Unique and Artistic Picture,\" the former being won by the war epic *Wings*, and the latter by the art film *Sunrise*. Each award was intended to honor different and equally important aspects of superior filmmaking. In particular, *The Jazz Singer* was disqualified from both awards, since its use of synchronized sound made the film a *sui generis* item that would have unfairly competed against either category, and the Academy granted the film an honorary award instead.[7]\n\n\nThe following year, the Academy dropped the *Unique and Artistic Picture* award, deciding retroactively that the award won by *Wings* was the highest honor that could be awarded, and allowed synchronized sound films to compete for the award.[8] Although the award kept the title *Outstanding Picture* for the next ceremony, the name underwent several changes over the years as seen below. Since 1962, the award has been simply called *Best Picture*.[6]\n\n\n\n* 1927/28\u20131928/29: **Academy Award for Outstanding Picture**\n* 1929/30\u20131940: **Academy Award for Outstanding Production**\n* 1941\u20131943: **Academy Award for Outstanding Motion Picture**\n* 1944\u20131961: **Academy Award for Best Motion Picture**\n* 1962\u2013present: **Academy Award for Best Picture**\n\n\n### Recipients[edit]\n\n\nUntil 1950, this award was presented to a representative of the production company. That year the protocol was changed so that the award was presented to all credited producers. This rule was modified in 1999 to apply a maximum limit of three producers receiving the award, after the five producers of *Shakespeare in Love* had received the award.[9][10][11]\n\n\nAs of 2020[update], the \"Special Rules for the Best Picture of the Year Award\" limit recipients to those who meet two main requirements:[12]\n\n\n\n* Those with screen credit of \"producer\" or \"produced by\", explicitly excluding those with the screen credit \"executive producer, co-producer, associate producer, line producer, or produced in association with\"\n* those three or fewer producers who have performed the major portion of the producing functions\n\n\nThe rules allow a *bona fide* team of not more than two people to be considered a single \"producer\" if the two individuals have had an established producing partnership as determined by the Producers Guild of America Producing Partnership Panel. Final determination of the qualifying producer nominees for each nominated picture will be made by the Producers Branch Executive Committee, including the right to name any additional qualified producer as a nominee.[12]\n\n\nThe Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously included among the four producers nominated for *The Reader*.[13] As of 2014[update] the Producers Branch Executive Committee determines such exceptions, noting they take place only in \"rare and extraordinary circumstance[s].\"[12]\n\n\nSteven Spielberg currently holds the record for most nominations at twelve, winning one, while Kathleen Kennedy holds the record for most nominations without a win at eight. Sam Spiegel and Saul Zaentz tie for the most wins with three each. As for the time when the Oscar was given to production companies instead, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer holds the record with five wins and 40 nominations.\n\n\n\n### Best Picture and Best Director[edit]\n\n\nThe Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director have been closely linked throughout their history. Of the 95 films that have won Best Picture, 68 have also been awarded Best Director. Only six films have been awarded Best Picture without receiving a Best Director nomination: *Wings* directed by William A. Wellman (1927/28), *Grand Hotel* directed by Edmund Goulding (1931/32), *Driving Miss Daisy* directed by Bruce Beresford (1989), *Argo* directed by Ben Affleck (2012), *Green Book* directed by Peter Farrelly (2018), and *CODA* directed by Sian Heder (2021). The only two Best Director winners to win for films that did not receive a Best Picture nomination were during the early years of the awards: Lewis Milestone for *Two Arabian Knights* (1927/28), and Frank Lloyd for *The Divine Lady* (1928/29).[14]\n\n\n\n### Nomination limit increased[edit]\n\n\nOn June 24, 2009, AMPAS announced that the number of films to be nominated in the Best Picture award category would increase from five to ten, starting with the 82nd Academy Awards (2009).[15] Although the Academy never officially said so, many commenters noted the expansion was likely in part a response to public criticism of *The Dark Knight* and *WALL-E* (both 2008) (and, in previous years, other blockbusters and popular films) not being nominated for Best Picture.[16][17][18] Officially, the Academy said the rule change was a throwback to the Academy's early years in the 1930s and 1940s, when eight to 12 films were nominated each year. \"Having 10 Best Picture nominees is going to allow Academy voters to recognize and include some of the fantastic movies that often show up in the other Oscar categories but have been squeezed out of the race for the top prize,\" AMPAS President Sid Ganis said in a press conference. \"I can't wait to see what that list of 10 looks like when the nominees are announced in February.\"[15]\n\n\nAt the same time, the voting system was switched from first-past-the-post to instant runoff voting (also known as preferential voting).[19] In 2011, the Academy revised the rule again so that the number of films nominated was between five and ten; nominated films must earn either 5% of first-place rankings or 5% after an abbreviated variation of the single transferable vote nominating process.[20] Bruce Davis, the Academy executive director at the time, said, \"A Best Picture nomination should be an indication of extraordinary merit. If there are only eight pictures that truly earn that honor in a given year, we shouldn't feel an obligation to round out the number.\"[21] This system lasted until 2021, when the Academy reverted back to a set number of ten nominees from the 94th Academy Awards onward.[22]\n\n\n\n### Language and country of origin[edit]\n\n\nOnly fourteen non-English language films have been nominated in the category: *La Grande Illusion* (French, 1938); *Z* (French, 1969); *The Emigrants* (Swedish, 1972); *Cries and Whispers* (Swedish, 1973); *The Postman (Il Postino)* (Italian/Spanish, 1995); *Life Is Beautiful* (Italian, 1998); *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* (Mandarin Chinese, 2000); *Letters from Iwo Jima* (Japanese, 2006, but ineligible for Best Foreign Language Film because it was an American production); *Amour* (French, 2012); *Roma* (Spanish/Mixtec, 2018); *Parasite* (Korean, 2019); *Minari* (Korean, 2020, but ineligible for Best International Feature Film because it was an American production);[23] *Drive My Car* (Japanese, 2021) and *All Quiet on the Western Front* (German, 2022). *Parasite* became the first film not in English to win Best Picture.[24][25]\n\n\nOnly ten films wholly financed outside the United States have won Best Picture, eight of which were financed, in part or in whole, by the United Kingdom: *Hamlet* (1948), *Tom Jones* (1963), *A Man for All Seasons* (1966), *Chariots of Fire* (1981), *Gandhi* (1982), *The Last Emperor* (1987), *Slumdog Millionaire* (2008), and *The King's Speech* (2010). The ninth film, *The Artist* (2011), was financed in France and the tenth film, *Parasite* (2019), was financed in South Korea.[26]\n\n\n\n### Rating[edit]\n\n\nSince 1968, most Best Picture winners have been rated R under the Motion Picture Association's rating system. *Oliver!* is the only G-rated film and *Midnight Cowboy* is the only X-rated (now NC-17) film, so far, to win Best Picture; they won in back-to-back years, 1968 and 1969. The latter has since been downgraded to an R rating. Eleven films have won with a PG rating: the first was *Patton* (1970) and the most recent was *Driving Miss Daisy* (1989). Eleven more films have won with a PG-13 rating (which was introduced in 1984): the first was *The Last Emperor* (1987) and the most recent was *CODA* (2021).\n\n\n\n### Genres[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

The latter two were nominated after the Academy expanded the number of nominees, but none have won. \n\n\nNo comic book film has won, and only three have ever been nominated: *Skippy* (1931), *Black Panther* (2018), and *Joker* (2019).[27]\n\n\nOnly two fantasy films have won: *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003) and *The Shape of Water* (2017), although more have been nominated. \n\n\n*The Silence of the Lambs* (1991) is the only horror film to win Best Picture, and only five others have been nominated for Best Picture: *The Exorcist* (1973), *Jaws* (1975), *The Sixth Sense* (1999), *Black Swan* (2010), and *Get Out* (2017). \n\n\nSeveral science-fiction films have been nominated for Best Picture, though *Everything Everywhere All at Once* (2022) was the first one to win.[28]\n\n\n*Titanic* (1997) is the only disaster film to win Best Picture, though other such films have been nominated, including *Airport* (1970) *and The Towering Inferno* (1974).\n\n\nThe Best Documentary Feature category was initiated in 1941, leaving *Chang* as the only documentary feature previously nominated, and that in the \"Unique and Artistic Production\" category at the 1927/28 awards.\n\n\nSeveral musical adaptations based on material previously filmed in non-musical form have won Best Picture, including *Gigi*, *West Side Story*, *My Fair Lady*, *The Sound of Music*, *Oliver!*, and *Chicago*.\n\n\nSeveral epics or historical epic films have won Best Picture, including the first recipient *Wings*. Others include *Cimarron*, *Cavalcade*, *Gone with the Wind*, *The Bridge on the River Kwai*, *Ben-Hur*, *Lawrence of Arabia*, *Patton*, *The Godfather*, *The Godfather Part II*, *The Last Emperor*, *Dances with Wolves*, *Schindler's List*, *Forrest Gump*, *Braveheart*, *The English Patient*, *Titanic*, *Gladiator*, and *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*.\n\n\n\n### Sequel nominations and winners[edit]\n\n\nNine films that were presented as direct sequels have been nominated for Best Picture: *The Bells of St. Mary's* (1945; the sequel to the 1944 winner, *Going My Way*), *The Godfather Part II* (1974), *The Godfather Part III* (1990), *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* (2002), *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003), *Toy Story 3* (2010), *Mad Max: Fury Road* (2015)*, Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022) and *Top Gun: Maverick* (2022).\n\n\n*Toy Story 3*, *Mad Max: Fury Road* and *Top Gun: Maverick* are the only sequels to be nominated without any predecessors being nominated. *The Godfather Part II* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* are the only sequels to have won the award, and their respective trilogies are the only series to have three films nominated. *The Godfather* series is the only film series with multiple Best Picture winners, with the first film winning the award for 1972 and the second film winning the award for 1974.[23]\n\n\nAnother nominee, *Broadway Melody of 1936*, was a follow-up of sorts to previous winner *The Broadway Melody*, but beyond the title and some music, the two films have mutually independent stories. *The Silence of the Lambs* was adapted from the sequel novel to *Red Dragon*. The latter had been adapted for film as *Manhunter* by a different studio, and the two films have different casts and creative teams and were not presented as a series.[29]\n\n\n*The Lion in Winter* features Peter O'Toole as King Henry II, a role he had played previously in the film *Becket*, but *The Lion in Winter* is not a sequel to *Becket*. Similarly, *The Queen* features Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, a role he had played previously in the television film *The Deal*. Christine Langan, producer of both productions, described *The Queen* as not being a direct sequel, only that it reunited the same creative team.[30]\n\n\nClint Eastwood's *Letters from Iwo Jima* was a companion piece to his film *Flags of Our Fathers* that was released earlier the same year. These two films depict the same battle from the different viewpoints of Japanese and United States military forces; the two films were shot back-to-back.\n\n\nIn addition, *Black Panther* is a continuation of the events that occurred in *Captain America: Civil War* and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n\n\n### Remake nominations and winners[edit]\n\n\nAlong similar lines to sequels, there have been few nominees and winners that are either remakes or adaptations of the same source materials or subjects. *Ben-Hur*, which won Best Picture of 1959, is a remake of the 1925 silent film with a similar title and both were adapted from Lew Wallace's 1880 novel *Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ*. *The Departed*, which won Best Picture of 2006, is a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film *Infernal Affairs* and is the first remake of a non-English language or international film to win. Other nominees include 1963's *Cleopatra* about the title last queen of Egypt following the 1934 version, 2018's *A Star is Born* following the 1937 film of the same name, and 2019's *Little Women* following the 1933 film of the same name with both being adaptations of the 1868 novel.[31] *True Grit*, which was nominated for Best Picture of 2010, is the second adaptation of Charles Portis's 1968 novel following the 1969 film of the same name. Four of the nominees for the 94th ceremony were based on source material previously made into films: *CODA*, *Dune*, *Nightmare Alley*, and *West Side Story*. The 2021 version of *West Side Story* became the second adaptation of the same source material for a previous Best Picture winner to be nominated for the same award after 1962's *Mutiny on the Bounty*.[32] For that same ceremony, *CODA* became the second remake of a non-English-language or international film to win. The 2022 German-language *All Quiet on the Western Front* is the second adaptation of the 1929 novel after the 1930 English-language film, and the third adaptation of the same source material of a previous Best Picture winner.[33]\n\n\n\n### Silent film winners[edit]\n\n\nAt the 1st Academy Awards, the Best Picture award (then named \"Academy Award for Outstanding Picture\") was presented to the 1927 silent film *Wings*.\n\n\n*The Artist* (2011) was the first essentially silent (with the exception of a single scene of dialogue, and a dream sequence with sound effects) film since *Wings* to win Best Picture. It was the first silent nominee since 1928's *The Patriot*. It was the first Best Picture winner to be produced entirely in black-and-white since 1960's *The Apartment*. (*Schindler's List*, the 1993 winner, was predominantly black-and-white but contains some color sequences.)[26]\n\n\n\n### Version availability[edit]\n\n\nNo Best Picture winner has been lost, though a few such as *All Quiet on the Western Front* and *Lawrence of Arabia* exist only in a form altered from their original, award-winning release form. This has usually been due to editing for reissue (and subsequently partly restored by archivists). Other winners and nominees, such as *Tom Jones* (prior to its 2018 reissues by The Criterion Collection and the British Film Institute) and *Star Wars*, are widely available only in subsequently altered versions. *The Broadway Melody* originally had some sequences photographed in two-color Technicolor. This footage survives only in black and white.[34]\n\n\nThe 1928 film *The Patriot* is the only Best Picture nominee that is lost (about one-third is extant).[35] *The Racket*, also from 1928, was believed lost for many years until a print was found in Howard Hughes' archives. It has since been restored and shown on Turner Classic Movies.[36] The only surviving complete prints of 1931's *East Lynne* and 1934's *The White Parade* exist within the UCLA film archive.[37]\n\n\n\n### Diversity standards[edit]\n\n\nThe Academy has established a set of \"representation and inclusion standards\" which a film will be required to satisfy in order to compete in the Best Picture category, starting with the 96th Academy Awards for films released in 2023.[38] There are four general standards, of which a film must satisfy two to be considered for Best Picture: (a) on-screen representation, themes and narratives; (b) creative leadership and project team; (c) industry access and opportunities; and (d) audience development.[38] As explained by Vox, the standards \"basically break down into two big buckets: standards promoting more inclusive representation and standards promoting more inclusive employment\".[39] The standards are intended to provide greater opportunities for employment, in cast, crew, studio apprenticeships and internships, and development, marketing, publicity, and distribution executives, among underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, women, LGBTQ+ people, and persons with cognitive or physical disabilities, or who are deaf or hard of hearing.[38]\n\n\nFor the 94th and 95th Academy Awards (films released in 2021 and 2022), filmmakers were required to submit a confidential Academy Inclusion Standards form to be considered for Best Picture but were not required to fulfill the standards.[39] These standards will only apply to the Best Picture category and do not affect a film's eligibility in other Oscar categories.[38]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\n### Ceremony mistake[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, at the 89th Academy Awards, presenter Faye Dunaway read *La La Land* as the winner of the award. However, she and Warren Beatty had mistakenly been given the duplicate envelope for the \"Best Actress in a Leading Role\" award, which Emma Stone had won for her role in *La La Land* moments prior. In the resulting chaos, it was *La La Land* producer Jordan Horowitz who finally announced\u2014two minutes and twenty-seven seconds later\u2014that *Moonlight* was the real winner.[40]\n\n\n\n## Winners and nominees[edit]\n\n\nIn the list below, winners are listed first in the gold row, followed by the other nominees.[6] Except for the early years (when the Academy used a non-calendar year), the year shown is the one in which the film first premiered in Los Angeles County, California; normally this is also the year of first release, however, it may be the year after first release (as with *Casablanca* and, if the film-festival premiere is considered, *Crash*). This is also the year before the ceremony at which the award is given; for example, a film exhibited theatrically during 2005 was eligible for consideration for the 2005 Best Picture Oscar, awarded in 2006. The number of the ceremony (1st, 2nd, etc.) appears in parentheses after the awards year, linked to the article on that ceremony. Each individual entry shows the title followed by nominee.\n\n\nUntil 1950, the Best Picture award was given to the production company; from 1951 on, it has gone to the producer or producers. The Academy used the producer credits of the Producers Guild of America (PGA) until 1998, when all five producers of *Shakespeare in Love* made speeches after its win.[9][10] A three-producer limit has been applied some years since.[10][11] There was controversy over the exclusion of some PGA-credited producers of *Crash* and *Little Miss Sunshine*.[11] The Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously among the four nominated for *The Reader*.[13] However, now any number of producers on a film can be nominated for Best Picture, should they be deemed eligible.\n\n\nFor the first ceremony, three films were nominated for the award. For the following three years, five films were nominated for the award. This was expanded to eight in 1933, to ten in 1934, and to twelve in 1935, before being dropped back to ten in 1937. In 1945, it was further reduced to five. This number remained until 2009, when the limit was raised to ten; it was adjusted from 2011 to 2020 to vary between five and ten, but has been a full ten since 2021.\n\n\nFor the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years. For example, the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3, 1930, recognized films that were released between August 1, 1928, and July 31, 1929. Starting with the 7th Academy Awards, held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31. This has been the rule every year since except 2020, when the end date was extended to February 28, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2021, which was correspondingly limited to March 1 to December 31.\n\n\n\nindicates the winner\n\n### 1920s[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year of Film Release\n | Film\n | Film Studio\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **1927/28**(1st)  |\n| ***Wings*** | **Famous Players\u2013Lasky (Lucien Hubbard, Jesse L.

It stars Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Tomas Arana, Ralf M\u00f6ller, Oliver Reed (in his final role), Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, Richard Harris, and Tommy Flanagan. Crowe portrays Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when Commodus, the ambitious son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus becomes a gladiator and rises through the ranks of the arena to avenge the murders of his family and his emperor.\n\n\nInspired by Daniel P. Mannix's 1958 book *Those About to Die* (formerly titled *The Way of the Gladiator*), the script, initially written by Franzoni, was acquired by DreamWorks, and Ridley Scott signed-on to direct the film. Principal photography began in January 1999 and wrapped-up in May of that year, after having experienced a range of problems due to the script being unfinished. Several members of the cast complained about the writing quality throughout the nineteen-week shoot in Fort Ricasoli, Malta, forcing many rewrites. Production complications were further exacerbated when Oliver Reed died of a heart attack before production was finished; British post-production company The Mill, whom oversaw the film's CGI effects, were then tasked with creating a digital body double for the remaining scenes involving his character, Proximo.\n\n\nDespite its troubled production, *Gladiator* was anticipated to be one of the year's most successful films; upon its release, the film grossed over $503 million worldwide, becoming the second highest-grossing film of 2000 (behind *Mission: Impossible 2*). Critics praised the acting\u2014particularly Crowe's and Phoenix's performances\u2014Scott's direction, the visuals, screenplay, action sequences, musical score, and the production values, although its somewhat dark and brooding tone was criticised by some. Earning numerous accolades, *Gladiator* won five Academy Awards at the 73rd Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Crowe. *Gladiator* is known for having revitalized (or established) the careers of its cast and crew, elevating Crowe to leading man status, and turning Phoenix into a celebrity.\n\n\nSince its release, *Gladiator* has been critically reevaluated. It is now widely considered one of the best films of the 2000s and one of the greatest historical epic films ever made. It has been credited with reinventing the sword-and-sandal genre, after waning in the public eye during the 1960s; the film rekindled interest in films centered around the cultures of ancient Greece, Rome, and other iconic periods throughout world history. Several films have attempted to emulate *Gladiator*'s visuals, style, and tone with varying degrees of success. The film has been analyzed for its themes of revenge, violence, masculinity, and stoicism. In 2021, Scott announced that writing had begun on a sequel,[8] which is scheduled to be released in the US on November 22, 2024.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 180 AD, Hispano-Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return home after he leads the Roman army to victory against Germanic tribes near Vindobona on the Limes Germanicus. Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that his own son, Commodus, is unfit to rule and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to restore the Roman Republic. Marcus Aurelius informs Commodus; in response, Commodus murders his father.\n\n\nCommodus proclaims himself the new emperor and requests loyalty from Maximus, who refuses. Maximus is arrested by the Praetorian Guard and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and, wounded, rides for his home near Turgalium, where he finds his wife and son crucified. Maximus buries them and collapses from his injuries.  Slavers find him and take him to the city of Zucchabar in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis, where he is sold to gladiator trainer Proximo.\n\n\nMaximus reluctantly fights in local tournaments, his combat skills helping him win matches and gain popularity. He befriends two other gladiators: Hagen, a German; and Juba, a Numidian. In Rome, Commodus organises 150 days of games to commemorate his father's death. Upon hearing this, Proximo reveals to Maximus that he was once a gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises him to \"win the crowd\" to win his freedom.\n\n\nProximo takes his gladiators to Rome to fight in the Colosseum. Disguised in a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in the Colosseum as a Carthaginian in a re-enactment of the Battle of Zama. Unexpectedly, he leads his side to victory, and Commodus enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to reveal his identity; Maximus removes his helmet and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let Maximus and the gladiators live. \n\n\nLucilla, Commodus's sister and Maximus's former lover, visits Maximus in his cell and offers her help, but he refuses. Meanwhile, Commodus arranges a duel between Maximus and Tigris of Gaul, an undefeated gladiator. Several tigers are set upon Maximus during the duel, but he prevails. Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but Maximus spares his opponent's life. In response, the crowd chants \"Maximus the Merciful\", which angers Commodus. Increasingly paranoid, Commodus instructs his advisor, Falco, to have every senator followed. \n\n\nMaximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. He meets in secret with Lucilla and Gracchus, an influential senator. They agree to help Maximus escape Rome to join his legions, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the Roman Senate. The Praetorians arrest Gracchus, and Commodus learns of the plot when Lucilla's son, Lucius, innocently hints at the conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the Praetorians attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where the latter is killed.\n\n\nTo win back public approval, Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus in the lung before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injuries, Maximus disarms Commodus during the duel. After the Praetorians refuse to aid him, Commodus unsheathes a hidden knife; Maximus overpowers Commodus and drives the knife into his throat, killing him. Before Maximus succumbs to his wounds, he asks for political reforms, the freedom of his gladiator allies, and the reinstatement of Senator Gracchus. As he dies, Maximus envisions reuniting with his wife and son in the afterlife. His friends and allies honor him as \"a soldier of Rome\", at Lucilla's behest, and carry his body out of the arena.\n\n\nThat night, Juba visits the Colosseum and buries figurines of Maximus's wife and son at the spot where he died.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nRussell Crowe (left) in 2017 and Joaquin Phoenix in 2018\n\n* Russell Crowe as Maximus Decimus Meridius: A Hispano-Roman legatus forced into becoming a slave who seeks revenge against Commodus.

Even as I went east, going through Turkey, I began to think to myself this must have been a hell of a franchise.\" During a stop in Baghdad, Iraq, he stopped reading a book about the Irish Revolution for another one: Daniel P. Mannix's 1958 novel *Those About to Die.* These experiences planted the seeds of inspiration for a story about gladiators set in the Roman Empire.\n\n\nTwenty-five years later, Franzoni wrote the screenplay for Steven Spielberg's *Amistad,* which was the director's first film for DreamWorks Pictures. Though *Amistad* was only a moderate commercial success, DreamWorks was impressed with Franzoni's screenplay and gave him a three-picture deal as writer and co-producer. Remembering his 1972 trip, Franzoni pitched his Roman history idea to Spielberg, who immediately told him to write the script.[10]\n\n\nIn the first draft, dated April 4, 1998, Franzoni chose to base his story on Commodus after reading the ancient Roman text *Historia Augusta*. He later named his protagonist Narcissus, a wrestler who, according to the ancient sources Herodian and Cassius Dio, strangled Emperor Commodus to death.[12]\n\n\n\n![Several dead men and various scattered weapons are located in a large arena.

Parkes and Douglas Wick. They showed him a copy of Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me's 1872 painting entitled *Pollice Verso (Thumbs Down)*.[13] Scott was enticed by the idea of filming the world of Ancient Rome. However, he felt Franzoni's dialogue lacked subtlety and hired John Logan to rewrite the script to his liking. Logan rewrote much of the first act and made the decision to kill off Maximus's family to increase the character's desire for revenge.[14]\n\n\nWhile the script was being revised and the production crew was being assembled, DreamWorks began circling several potential partners to help cover the film's budget and costs. Co-financing between studios became increasingly common during the late-1990s as production and marketing costs and the potential for losses spiralled upward.[15] DreamWorks saw success with its split-rights deals as the studio shared financing and distribution for the 1998 films *Saving Private Ryan* and *Deep Impact* with Paramount Pictures. On November 12, 1998, *Variety* reported that Universal Pictures reached a deal with DreamWorks to help finance the film, as well as obtain international distribution rights and split worldwide proceeds 50\u201350 with DreamWorks, which would distribute the film in North America.[15]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Oliver Reed (pictured in 1968) portrayed Proximo.\nWhile writing the script, Franzoni expressed interest in Antonio Banderas as the lead role, but he declined. Mel Gibson, Tom Sizemore, and Tom Cruise were considered for the film, but the producers and studio had Russell Crowe at the top of their list after his breakout performance in *L.A. Confidential* (1997).[16] Crowe was initially hesitant to join the project due to gaining forty pounds for *The Insider* (1999)*,* but director Michael Mann convinced the actor to take the role.[17] He eventually signed on to play the main character in September 1998.[18] Crowe would later state that he was pitched by Parkes with the script still unfinished. In his interview for *Inside the Actors Studio*: \"They said, 'It's a 100-million-dollar film. You're being directed by Ridley Scott. You play a Roman general.' I've always been a big fan of Ridley's.\"[19]\n\n\nJude Law auditioned for the role of Commodus, but Scott landed his number-one choice, Joaquin Phoenix.[20] Jennifer Lopez reportedly lobbied for the role of Lucilla, but lost out to Connie Nielsen.[20] Crowe initially suggested his *Insider* costar Christopher Plummer prior to Richard Harris being cast in the role of Marcus Aurelius. From there, Ralf M\u00f6ller, Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, and Tommy Flanagan joined the cast as pre-production was ready to commence.\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nIn preparation for filming, Scott spent several months developing storyboards to develop the framework of the plot.[21] Over six weeks, production members scouted various locations within the extent of the Roman Empire before its collapse, including Italy, France, North Africa, and England.[22] All of the film's props, sets, and costumes were manufactured by crew members due to the high costs and unavailability of the items.[23]\n\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\nScott and Franzoni drew on several influences for Gladiator, including *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*, *La Dolce Vita* and *The Conformist*. The film's plot was influenced by two 1960s Hollywood films of the sword-and-sandal genre, *The Fall of the Roman Empire* and *Spartacus*,[24] and shares several plot points with *The Fall of the Roman Empire*, which tells the story of Livius, who, like Maximus in *Gladiator*, is Marcus Aurelius's intended successor. Livius is in love with Lucilla and seeks to marry her while Maximus, who is happily married, was formerly in love with her. Both films portray the death of Marcus Aurelius as an assassination. In *The Fall of the Roman Empire* a group of conspirators independent of Commodus, hoping to profit from Commodus's accession, arrange for Marcus Aurelius to be poisoned. In *Gladiator,* Commodus himself murders his father by smothering him. \n\n\nIn the course of *The Fall of the Roman Empire,* Commodus unsuccessfully seeks to win Livius over to his vision of empire in contrast to that of his father, but continues to employ him notwithstanding; in *Gladiator*, when Commodus fails to secure Maximus's allegiance, he executes Maximus's wife and son and tries unsuccessfully to execute him, too. Livius and Maximus both kill Commodus in single combat for the greater good of Rome in addition to personal motivations: Livius to save Lucilla and Maximus to avenge the murder of his family.\n\n\nScott cited *Spartacus* and *Ben-Hur* as influences on the film: \"These movies were part of my cinema-going youth. But at the dawn of the new millennium, I thought this might be the ideal time to revisit what may have been the most important period of the last two thousand years\u00a0\u2013 if not all recorded history\u00a0\u2013 the apex and beginning of the decline of the greatest military and political power the world has ever known.\"[25]\n\n\n*Spartacus* provides the film's gladiatorial motif, as well as the character of Senator Gracchus, a fictitious senator, bearing the name of a pair of revolutionary tribunes from the 2nd century BC, who in both films is an elder statesman of ancient Rome attempting to preserve the ancient rights of the Roman Senate in the face of an ambitious autocrat\u00a0\u2013 Marcus Licinius Crassus in *Spartacus* and Commodus in *Gladiator.* Both actors who played Gracchus (in *Spartacus* and *Gladiator*) played Claudius in previous films: Charles Laughton of *Spartacus* played Claudius in the unfinished 1937 film *I, Claudius* and Derek Jacobi of *Gladiator* played Claudius in the 1976 BBC adaptation. Both films also share a specific set piece wherein a gladiator (Maximus here, Woody Strode's Draba in *Spartacus*) throws his weapon into a spectator box at the end of a match, as well as at least one line of dialogue: \"Rome is the mob\", said here by Gracchus and by Julius Caesar (John Gavin) in *Spartacus*.\n\n\n\n## Filming[edit]\n\n\n### Principal photography[edit]\n\n\nThe film was shot in three main locations between January and May 1999. The opening battle scenes set in the forests of Germania were shot in three weeks in the Bourne Woods, near Farnham, Surrey, in England.[26] When Scott learned that the Forestry Commission planned to remove a section of the forest, he persuaded them to allow the battle scene to be shot there and burn it down.[27] Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson used multiple cameras filming at various frame rates and a 45-degree shutter,[7] creating stop motion effects in the action sequences, similar to techniques used for the battle sequences of *Saving Private Ryan* (1998).[28]\n\n\nThe scenes of slavery, desert travel, and the gladiatorial training school were shot in Ouarzazate, Morocco, just south of the Atlas Mountains over a further three weeks.[29] To construct the arena where Maximus has his first fights, the crew used basic materials and local building techniques to manufacture the 30,000-seat mud brick arena.[30] The scenes set in Rome were shot over a period of nineteen weeks in Fort Ricasoli, Malta.[31][32]\n\n\nIn Malta, a replica of about one-third of Rome's Colosseum was built to a height of 52 feet (16 meters), mostly from plaster and plywood. The other two-thirds and remaining height were added digitally.[33] The replica took several months to build and cost an estimated $1 million.[34] The reverse side of the complex supplied a rich assortment of Ancient Roman street furniture, colonnades, gates, statuary, and marketplaces for other filming requirements. The complex was serviced by tented \"costume villages\" that had to change rooms, storage, armorers, and other facilities.[31] The rest of the Colosseum was created in computer-generated imagery using set-design blueprints and textures referenced from live action, and rendered in three layers to provide lighting flexibility for compositing in Flame and Inferno software.[35]\n\n\nWhile Crowe and Harris became good friends during filming, the actor did not get along with Reed. In a 2010 interview with *GQ*, Crowe stated that he \"never got on with Ollie. He has visited me in dreams and asked me to talk kindly of him. So I should... but we never had a pleasant conversation.\" Crowe was uncomfortable with Reed's excessive drinking during filming. Phoenix was initially anxious about filming and requested Scott he drop out early in production. To help calm the then 25-year-old Phoenix's nerves, Crowe and Harris decided to get him drunk. \"It was actually Richard Harris' idea,\" Crowe later recalled, \"because Joaquin was very nervous on the set and I went to Richard and said, 'Mate, what are we gonna do with this kid, he's asking me to abuse him before takes.'\"[36]\n\n\n\n### Script revisions and complaints[edit]\n\n\nThroughout filmmaking, the actors complained about problems with the script. William Nicholson was brought to Shepperton Studios to make Maximus a more sensitive character. Nicholson reworked Maximus' friendship with Juba and developed the afterlife thread in the film, saying, \"he did not want to see a film about a man who wanted to kill somebody.\"[14] The screenplay faced many rewrites and revisions, with several actors providing changes.[37] Crowe questioned every aspect of the evolving script and strode off the set when he did not get answers. According to Nicholson, Crowe reportedly told him that his \"lines are garbage, but I'm the greatest actor in the world and I can make even garbage sound good.\"\n\n\nAccording to a DreamWorks executive, Crowe \"tried to rewrite the entire script on the spot. You know the big line in the trailer, 'In this life or the next, I will have my vengeance'? At first he absolutely refused to say it.\"[38] Crowe described the script situation: \"I read the script and it was substantially underdone. Even the character didn't exist on the pages. And that set about a long process, that's probably the first time that I've been in a situation where the script wasn't a complete done deal. We actually started shooting with about 32 pages and went through them in the first couple of weeks.\"[19]\n\n\nCrowe threatened to kill Lustig with his bare hands due to him refusing to pay his assistants.[39]\n\n\nOf the writing and filming process, Crowe added, \"Possibly, a lot of the stuff that I have to deal with now in terms of my 'volatility' has to do with that experience. Here was a situation where we got to Morocco with a crew of 200 and a cast of a 100 or whatever, and I didn't have anything to learn. I actually didn't know what the scenes were gonna be. We had, I think, one American writer working on it, one English writer working on it, and of course a group of producers who were also adding their ideas, and then Ridley himself; and then, on the occasion where Ridley would say, 'Look, this is the structure for it\u2013 what are you gonna say in that?' So then I'd be doing my own stuff, as well. And this is how things like, 'Strength and honor,' came up. This is how things like, 'At my signal, unleash hell,' came up. The name Maximus Decimus Meridius, it just flowed well.\"[19]\n\n\nMaximus' habit of rubbing soil before each fight references the attachment and affection to his former life as a farmer.[40] In a conversation with Marcus Aurelius, Maximus says the fecund soil of his farm is \"black like my wife's hair\".[40] Crowe wrote the speech himself, drawing on his feelings of homesickness for his own farm.[40]\n\n\n\n### Injuries[edit]\n\n\nCrowe was injured during principal photography. Detailing the impact filming had on his body during his appearance on *Inside the Actor's Studio,* Crowe described that there was a \"lot of blood, lot of blood, lot of grazes, you know, I mean, I've still got, a lot of little scar[s] here and one under here on this elbow, a discoloration of the skin that is directly to Gladiator\".[41] During filming on the sequence where Maximus fights Tigris of Gaul in the arena with tigers, Crowe narrowly escaped being clawed by a tiger.[42]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nMen in white robes with the Colosseum in the background.Several scenes included extensive use of computer-generated imagery shots for views of Rome.\nBritish post-production company The Mill was responsible for much of the computer-generated imagery effects that were added after filming. The company used such tricks as compositing real tigers filmed on bluescreen into the fight sequences, and adding smoke trails and extending the flight paths of the opening scene's salvo of flaming arrows to get around regulations on how far they could be shot during filming. They also used 2,000 live actors to create a computer-generated crowd of 35,000 virtual actors that had to look believable and react to fight scenes.[33] The Mill accomplished this by shooting live actors at different angles giving various performances, and then mapping them onto cards, with motion-capture tools used to track their movements for three-dimensional compositing.[35] The Mill created over 90 visual effects shots, comprising approximately nine minutes of the film's running time.[43]\n\n\nAn unexpected post-production job was required because of the death of Oliver Reed during the filming in Malta before all his scenes had been shot. The Mill created a digital body double for the remaining scenes involving his character Proximo[35] by photographing a live-action body double in the shadows and by performing digital face replacement by mapping a three-dimensional computer-generated image of Reed's face to the remaining scenes during production at an estimated cost of $3.2 million for two minutes of additional footage.[44][45] Visual effects supervisor John Nelson reflected on the decision to include the additional footage: \"What we did was small compared to our other tasks on the film. What Oliver did was much greater. He gave an inspiring, moving performance. All we did was help him finish it.\"[44] The film is dedicated to Reed's memory.[46]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gladiator (2000 soundtrack)\n\n![](image)\n\nHans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard\u00a0\u2013 \"Now We Are Free\"\n\n\nlisten to a clip from the score of *Gladiator*.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nThe Oscar-nominated score was composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, and conducted by Gavin Greenaway. Zimmer was originally planning to use Israeli vocalist Ofra Haza for the score, after his work with her in *The Prince of Egypt*. However, Haza died in late February 2000, before she was able to record, and so Gerrard was chosen instead. Lisa Gerrard's vocals are similar to her own work on *The Insider* score.[47]\n\n\nThe music for many of the battle scenes has been noted as similar to Gustav Holst's \"Mars: The Bringer of War\", and in June 2006, the Holst Foundation sued Hans Zimmer for allegedly copying the late Holst's work.[48][49] The case was settled out of court. [50] Another close musical resemblance occurs in the scene of Commodus's triumphal entry into Rome, accompanied by music clearly evocative of two sections\u00a0\u2013 the Prelude to *Das Rheingold* and Siegfried's Funeral March from *G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung*\u00a0\u2013 from Richard Wagner's *Ring of the Nibelung*.\n\n\nOn February 27, 2001, nearly a year after the first soundtrack's release, Decca produced *Gladiator: More Music From the Motion Picture*. Then, on September 5, 2005, Decca produced *Gladiator: Special Anniversary Edition*, a two-CD pack containing both the above-mentioned releases. Some of the music from the film was featured in the NFL playoffs in January 2003 before commercial breaks and before and after half-time.[51] In 2003, Luciano Pavarotti released a recording of himself singing a song from the film and said he regretted turning down an offer to perform on the soundtrack.[52]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Context[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2000 in film\n\n![](image)The logo for *Gladiator*\nThe theatrical year of 1999 achieved a record $7.3 billion at the domestic box office, thanks largely to the success of *Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace* and *The Sixth Sense*. Industry executives did not replicate that success with the releases in 2000, however. Increasing production costs and a lack of merchandising forced studios to concentrate marketing on the appeal of popular actors such as Tom Cruise, Mel Gibson, Eddie Murphy, Jim Carrey, and Bruce Willis to help boost ticket sales and draw in potential female audiences for their slates.[53][54][55]\n\n\nThe action sequel *Mission: Impossible 2* was expected to have the biggest success, while anticipated films such as *Dinosaur*, *Gladiator*, *The Patriot*, and *X-Men* were also expected to perform well.[53][56][57] Films such as *Battlefield Earth*, *Gone in 60 Seconds*, *The Kid*, *Me, Myself & Irene*, *Nutty Professor II: The Klumps*, *The Perfect Storm*, and *What Lies Beneath* were heavily marketed and promoted with the appeal of their leading actors that already had a built-in audience.[54][55] *Gladiator* was expected to perform well following test screenings that DreamWorks conducted between October 1999 and February 2000 that were overwhelmingly positive, but some analysts predicted the film could be impacted by the lack of a built-in audience for Crowe.[58][59][60]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Gladiator* was released in the United States and Canada on May 5, 2000.[61] During its opening weekend, *Gladiator* earned $34.8 million across 2,938 theaters\u2014an average of $11,851 per theater\u2014making it the number one film of the weekend, ahead of *U-571* ($7.8 million), in its first weekend, and *The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas* ($7.6 million), in its second weekend.[62][63] The film not only leapt over *Scream 3* to achieve the year's highest opening weekend, but also earned the third-highest opening weekend for an R-rated film ever, trailing only *Air Force One* (1997) and *Interview with the Vampire* (1994).[64] The film's positive word of mouth and the sex appeal of Crowe helped with bringing in a female audience during its opening weekend, with the percentage of women buying tickets increasing from 35% on its opening day to 45% the following day.[65]\n\n\nThe film remained number one in its second weekend with $24.6 million, ahead of the debut of *Battlefield Earth* ($11.5 million).[66] During its third weekend, *Gladiator* fell to second place with $19.7 million, behind the debut of *Dinosaur* ($38.5 million).[67][68] By Memorial Day, it had already earned a total of $127.2 million, surpassing *Erin Brockovich* to become the highest-grossing film of the year.[69] Without regaining the number one spot, *Gladiator* spent ten weeks in the top ten at the box office. The film was in theaters for over a year and finished its theatrical run on May 10, 2001.[70] *Gladiator* grossed $187.7 million in the United States and Canada, finishing as the fourth highest-grossing film of 2000 behind *Mission: Impossible 2* ($215.4 million), *Cast Away* ($233.6 million), and *How The Grinch Stole Christmas* ($260 million).[71]\n\n\nOutside of North America, *Gladiator* is estimated to have grossed over $272.9 million internationally.[70] This gave the film a cumulative gross of over $503.2 million worldwide against a budget of $103 million.[70] It was the second highest-grossing film of 2000 behind *Mission: Impossible 2* ($546.4 million).[70]\n\n\nDue to an increase in ticket prices, 2000 set a new record of $7.7 billion at the domestic box office, exceeding the previous year's $7.31 billion. However, attendance was estimated at being down 2.5% from 1999.[72][73] Industry executives blamed the decrease in attendance on the year's slate for its lack of commercial appeal, a dearth of female-driven films and sleeper hits, as well as several exhibition chains filing for bankruptcy.[74][73] Nevertheless, *Gladiator* was considered to be one of 2000's biggest blockbusters due to strong word of mouth, contributing to its long-lasting box office performance and DreamWorks' improving fortunes.[75][73][74]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nUpon its initial release, *Gladiator* opened to generally positive reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\n\n![](image)Connie Nielsen (pictured here in 2009) was praised by critics, notably the otherwise critical Ebert, for providing depth to the film.\nThe performances and the cast were praised by critics, with Crowe and Phoenix being considered by critics as the main highlights. Kirk Honeycutt of *The Hollywood Reporter* said Crowe \"solidly anchors this epic-scale gladiator movie - the first in nearly four decades - by using his burly frame and expressive face to give dimension to what might otherwise have been comic book heroics.\"[76] In his positive review for *The Wall Street Journal*, Joe Morgensten said that Crowe \"doesn't use tricks in this role to court our approval. He earns it the old-fashioned way, by daring to be quiet, if not silent, and intensely, implacably strong,\" and that the film \"rests on Mr. Crowe's armor-clad shoulders, and he carries it remarkably well.\"[77] *Empire*'s Ian Nathan, giving the film four stars, wrote that Phoenix displayed \"gleeful hamminess\" in his performance.[78]\n\n\nWriting about the film as a whole, Nathan expressed that \"while it's all grand opera, and driven by sweeping gestures and pompous, overwritten dialogue, it is prone to plain silliness - especially in granting us the big showdown at the close. But the sheer dynamism of the action, coupled with Hans Zimmer's lavish score and the forcefield of Crowe, still makes this a fiercesome competitor in the summer movie stakes.\"[78] Geoff Andrew of *Time Out* praised the film, saying that \"the cast is strong (notably Nielsen as Commodus's vacillating sister, and the late Oliver Reed, unusually endearing as a gladiator owner), the pacing lively, and the sets, swordplay and Scud catapults impressive.[79] Roger Ebert, who was otherwise critical in his two-star review, praised Nielsen for having the most depth in the entire film.[80] On the other hand, Camille Paglia, who called the film \"boring, badly shot and suffused with sentimental p.c. rubbish,\" criticized Crowe and Phoenix's performances[81]\n\n\nScott's directing was generally praised by critics, who called it a return to form for the director. In her A- review for *Entertainment Weekly*, Lisa Schwarzbaum praised Scott's directing, particularly during the opening battle sequence. Schwarzbaum writes that with the battle sequence, \"Scott lets loose his own extraordinary assault. It's a bravura sequence of flaming arrows, falling horses, and mortal combat that doesn't copy *Private Ryan's* famous opening tour de force of carnage so much as raise a banner in admiration. It's Scott the visual artist at his most deluxe.\" Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* wrote that \"Scott really scores in his big Rome set-pieces, especially Crowe's combat with men and tigers in a computer-enhanced Colosseum much bigger and more monumental than the original,\" and that \"for all of its implausible silliness and towering high camp, Scott's movie tells an engaging story, and the central arena fight-sequence in which Maximus and his gladiators playing the doomed Carthaginians end up defeating the Romans and reversing history \"to the emperor's horror\" is wittily and adroitly done: a sly demonstration of the confluence of politics and mass entertainment.\"[82] Michael Wilmington of *The Chicago Tribune* gave praise to Scott's direction, comparing the visual style of the film to that of Scott's 1982 film *Blade Runner*.[83]\n\n\nCritics generally praised the production values of the film, with the costumes, production design, and visual effects. Todd McCarthy, praising the film for *Variety*, said *Gladiator* \"revels in both the glory and the horror that were Rome,\" with \"details in Arthur Max's brilliant production design and Janty Yates' highly diversified costume design that offered up in wonderfully offhand fashion,\" while also commanding the \"CGI effects that have allowed numerous sets, notably the Colosseum, to be enhanced in size and spectacle value; the stunts, fights and battles are as forceful and realistic as anyone could want, John Mathieson's widescreen cinematography is magnificent, and the pacing across 2\u00bd hours is well modulated.\" Ebert criticized the film for looking \"muddy, fuzzy and indistinct.\" In his two-star review, Ebert also derided the writing, saying it \"employs depression as a substitute for personality, and believes that if characters are bitter and morose enough, we won't notice how dull they are.\"[80]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by Gladiator\n\nDespite the critical and commercial success it received during its theatrical run, *Gladiator* was not initially considered a major contender for the Academy Awards. When award season talk came around towards the end of 2000, critics and journalists simply viewed the film as an enjoyable summer film, but not a major Oscar contender.[84][85] *Gladiator* and *Erin Brockovich* were singled out for their releases during the first half of the year, while contenders such as *Almost Famous*, *Billy Elliot*, *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and Traffic* were released during the fall and winter of 2000 and received awards from numerous critics groups and guild organizations.[85] When the film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama at the 58th Golden Globes, media outlets began viewing *Gladiator* as the front runner for the Academy Awards.[86] Its subsequent wins for the BAFTA Award for Best Film and Produces Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture solidified *Gladiator*'s front runner status for the Oscars.[87]\n\n\nWhen nominations for the 73rd Academy Awards were announced on February 13, 2001, *Gladiator* received the most nominations with twelve, while *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* had scored ten. On March 25, 2001, the film won five Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor for Russell Crowe, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, and Best Costume Design. It was nominated for an additional seven: Best Original Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor for Joaquin Phoenix and Best Director for Ridley Scott, Best Original Score, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Film Editing.[88]\n\n\nIt was the first film to win Best Picture without winning either a directing or screenwriting award since *All the King's Men* at the 22nd Academy Awards in 1950. This was also the second consecutive DreamWorks film to achieve an Oscar for Best Picture after *American Beauty* the previous year.[89] Due to Academy rules, only Hans Zimmer was officially nominated for Best Original Score, and not Lisa Gerrard.[90] However, the pair did win the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score as co-composers.[91] Of its one-hundred and nineteen award nominations, *Gladiator* won a total of forty-eight prizes.[92]\n\n\n\n## Post-release[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

As Ridley Scott wanted to portray Roman culture more accurately than in any previous film, he hired several historians as advisors. Some deviations from historical facts were made to increase interest, maintain narrative continuity, and for practical or safety reasons. Scott stated that due to the influence of previous films affecting the public perception of what ancient Rome was like, some historical facts were \"too unbelievable\" to include. For instance, in an early version of the script, gladiators would have been carrying out product endorsements in the arena. While this would have been historically accurate, it was not filmed for fear that audiences would think it anachronistic. \n\n\nAt least one historical advisor resigned due to these changes. Another asked not to be mentioned in the credits, though it was stated in the director's commentary that he constantly asked, \"where is the proof that certain things were exactly like they say?\" Historian Allen Ward of the University of Connecticut believed that historical accuracy would not have made *Gladiator* less interesting or exciting, stating, \"creative artists need to be granted some poetic license, but that should not be a permit for the wholesale disregard of facts in historical fiction\".\n\n\n\n### Fictionalization[edit]\n\n\nMarcus Aurelius was not murdered by his son Commodus. He died at Vindobona (modern Vienna) in 180 AD from the Antonine Plague. The epidemic, believed to be either smallpox or measles, swept across the Roman Empire during his reign. There is no indication Marcus Aurelius wished to return the Empire to a republican form of government, as depicted in the film. Moreover, he shared the rule of the Empire with Commodus for three years before his own death. Commodus then ruled alone from that point until his death at the end of 192 AD. The film depicts Marcus as defeating the barbarians in the Marcomannic Wars. In reality, the war was still ongoing when Aurelius died. Commodus secured a peace treaty with the two Germanic tribes allied against Rome, the Marcomanni and the Quadi, immediately after his father's death.\n\n\nAlthough Commodus did engage in show combat in the Colosseum, he was not killed in the arena. He was strangled in his bath by the wrestler Narcissus. Commodus reigned for over twelve years, unlike the shorter period portrayed in the film. In the film, Lucilla is portrayed as a lone widow of Lucius Verus with one son, also named Lucius Verus. While Lucilla was the widow of Verus and also had a son by that name, their son died young, long before the reign of Commodus. \n\n\nLucilla remarried Claudius Pompeianus soon after Verus' death. She had been married to him for 11 years by the time her brother became Emperor. Her only living son during this time was Aurelius Pompeianus. The film omits Lucilla's other two children with Verus, Lucilla Plautia and Aurelia Lucilla. Lucilla was implicated in a plot to assassinate her brother in 182 AD, along with her stepson by Pompeianus and several others. She was first exiled to the island of Capri by her brother, then executed on his orders later in the year.\n\n\nThe character of Maximus is fictional, although in some respects he resembles the following historical figures: Narcissus, Commodus's real-life murderer and the character's name in the first draft of the screenplay; Spartacus, who led a significant slave revolt in 73\u201371 BC; Cincinnatus (519\u2013430 BC), a farmer who was made dictator, saved Rome from invasion, then resigned his six-month appointment after 15 days; and Marcus Nonius Macrinus, a trusted general, consul in 154 AD, and friend of Marcus Aurelius. \n\n\nMaximus had a similar career, and personality traits as documented by Herodian, to Claudius Pompeianus, a Syrian who married Marcus Aurelius' daughter Lucilla following the death of Lucius Verus. It is believed Aurelius may have wanted Pompeianus to succeed him as caesar, in preference to Commodus, but was turned down. Pompeianus had no part in any of the many plots against Commodus. He was not depicted in the film.\n\n\nIn the film, the character Antonius Proximo claims \"the wise\" Marcus Aurelius banned gladiatorial games in Rome, forcing him to move to Mauretania. The real Aurelius banned games, but only in Antioch as punishment for the city's support of the usurper Avidius Cassius. No games were ever banned in Rome. However, when the Emperor started conscripting gladiators into the legions, the resulting shortage in fighters allowed *lanistae* such as Proximo to make \"windfall\" profits through increased charges for their services.\n\n\nIn real life, the death of Commodus did not result in peace for Rome, nor a return to the Roman Republic. Rather, it ushered in a chaotic and bloody power struggle that culminated in the Year of the Five Emperors of AD 193. According to Herodian, the people of Rome were overjoyed at the news of Commodus dying, although they feared that the praetorians would not accept the new emperor Pertinax.\n\n\n\"Maximus Decimus Meridius\" does not appear to be a usual personal name during ancient Rome. A more accurate name would be \"Decimus Meridius Maximus\", as \"Decimus\" is a *praenomen* and \"Maximus\" is a *cognomen*. \"Proximo\" should be rendered as \"Proximus.\"\n\n\n\n### Anachronisms[edit]\n\n\n![Reconstructed Roman artillery pieces are used to locate the most likely position of Roman artillery during the battle at the Harzhorn by firing marked projectiles into the historical impact zones.](image)Roman field artillery used in open battle was far more compact and transportable than shown by the film. It was capable of creating \"killing zones\" with a low chance of survival, as proven by tightly spaced impacts on a real battlefield.\nCostumes in the film are rarely historically correct. Some soldiers wear fantasy helmets. The bands wrapped around their lower arms were rarely worn. Their appearance is the product of a cinematic stereotype where historical films depict peoples of antiquity wearing such bands. Although the film is set within the 2nd century AD, the Imperial Gallic armor and the helmets worn by the legionaries are from AD 75, a century earlier. This was superseded by new designs in AD 100. The legions' standard bearers (aquiliferi), centurions, mounted forces, and auxiliaries would have worn scale armour, lorica squamata. The Germanic tribes are dressed in clothes from the Stone Age period.\n\n\nRoman field artillery was used in combat extensively by the Romans, though within the film they are also depicted as using  onagers, which was not used by the Roman Empire until the 4th century, hundreds of years after the events of the film. The Roman cavalry are shown using stirrups. This is anachronistic in that the horse-mounted forces of the Roman army used a two-horned saddle, without stirrups. Stirrups were only employed in filming for safety reasons because of the additional training and skill required to ride with a Roman saddle.\n\n\nCatapults and ballistae would not have been used in a forest. They were reserved primarily for sieges and rarely used in open battles. Fire pots fired from catapults were not used in ancient history.\n\n\nThe Praetorian Guards all wear purple uniforms, no historical evidence supports this. On campaign, they usually wore standard legionary equipment with some unique decorative elements.\n\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Gladiator* was first released on DVD and VHS on November 21, 2000.[93] Along with *X-Men*, both films generated $60 million in home video sales each in their first week.[94] By this point, *Gladiator* had already sold 1.8 million DVD units, making it the fastest-selling DVD release at the time.[95] By January 2001, it broke *The Matrix*'s record for becoming the top-selling DVD release, selling 3.5 million copies.[96] In the United Kingdom, 500,000 copies were sold in 2000 alone.[97] With over 5 million copies sold, the film held the record for being the best-selling DVD title of all time until *Shrek* surpassed it later that year.[98]\n\n\nThe DVD has since been released in several different extended and special edition versions. Special features for the Blu-ray Disc and DVDs include deleted scenes, trailers, documentaries, commentaries, storyboards, image galleries, Easter eggs, and cast auditions. The film was released on Blu-ray in September 2009, in a 2-disc edition containing both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film, as part of Paramount's \"Sapphire Series\".[99] Initial reviews of the Blu-ray Disc release criticized poor image quality, leading many to call for it to be remastered, as Sony did with *The Fifth Element* in 2007.[100] A remastered version was later released in 2010.\n\n\nThe DVD editions that have been released since the original two-disc version, include a film-only single-disc edition as well as a three-disc \"extended edition\" DVD which was released in August 2005. The extended edition DVD features approximately fifteen minutes of additional scenes, most of which appear in the previous release as deleted scenes. The original cut, which Scott still calls his director's cut, is also selectable via seamless branching, which is not included on the UK edition. The DVD is notable for having a new commentary track featuring director Scott and star Crowe. The film is on the first disc, the second one has a three-hour documentary into the making of the film by DVD producer Charles de Lauzirika, and the third disc contains supplements. Discs one and two of the three-disc extended edition were repackaged and sold as a two-disc \"special edition\" in the EU in 2005. \n\n\nThe film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray by Paramount Home Media Distribution in May 2018.[101]\n\n\n\n## Thematic analysis[edit]\n\n\n### Revenge[edit]\n\n\nA common theme found in *Gladiator* is that of revenge. Throughout the film, Maximus' character arc revolves around exacting revenge against Commodus for betraying him and arranging the deaths of his wife, his son, and the emperor. Writing in the chapter \"*Gladiator* and Contemporary American Society\" of her book *Big Screen Rome*, Monica S. Cyrino argues that Maximus' revenge arc is driven by the alienation of Roman politics.[102] Cyrino opines that Maximus is introduced as being patriotic and one who \"fights for an ideal Rome because, never having been to the city, he has remained undefiled by the reality that Rome is rightful conqueror and civilizing force over the world.[102] Maximus is soon betrayed by Commodus and \"when he finds his wife and son murdered, it marked the moment of his alienation from everything he once valued.\"[102]\n\n\nThe loss of his family and emperor mentally breaks Maximus, who initially refuses to fight with the other gladiators and eventually cuts out the legion tattoo on his arm. This further solidifies Maximus' alienation from Rome. Cyrino notes that \"Maximus' alienation from a degenerate Rome and his deep-seated ambivalence about his role in restoring Roman government to the people suggests a parallel to post-Cold War America,\" because while there was a \"temporary boost in the rhetoric of national unity and superficial displays of patriotism after September 11, 2001, current political and social commentators remark on the apathy of the American electorate, such as low voter turnout and a persistent lack of interest in political debate.\"[102] When Maximus returns to Rome as a slave, \"he eventually realizes what he has already begun to understand: \"The mob is Rome.\"\"[102] Driven by his anger and isolation, Maximus' resolution is to re-enact his ideal of Rome from within the arena. After killing Commodus, Maximus asks Quintus to reinstate Senator Gracchus in the hope that Gracchus will endeavor to implement Marcus Aurelius' ideals.\n\n\n\n### Violence as spectacle[edit]\n\n\n*Gladiator* comments on the theme of violence in sports and as a spectacle for entertainment. Cyrino writes that \"*Gladiator* evokes the influence of the superstar athlete in a child's wide-eyed worship of celebrity when young Lucius approaches Maximus, his new idol, as he waits in his cell to enter the arena.\"[102] Franzoni himself was inspired by various sports agents and professional sports such as the NFL and WWE when writing the script.[103] Cyrino believes that the film's \"gladiatorial fights are reminiscent of the way in which contemporary sports competitions, especially professional football and wrestling, are filmed for television,\" and that Logan employed a similar tactic in the screenplay for Oliver Stone's *Any Given Sunday* (1999), in which \"the camera watches from a series of vantage points that are easily recognizable to any viewers of Monday Night Football.\"[102] Cyrino argues that the film deconstructs the spectacle of violence through the lens of Maximus. After a victory in Zucchabar, Maximus throws his sword at the local viewing box and spits at the sand after displaying his contempt for the crowd. Cyrino argues that \"the depiction of the Roman mob in Gladiator offers the American audience an unnerving mirror-image of themselves, eager to be entertained at all costs and demanding ever more intricate, dangerous, and realistic spectacles.\"[102]\n\n\n\n### Masculinity and stoicism[edit]\n\n\nThemes of masculinity and stoicism are commentated throughout the film's plot. During the course of the film, Maximus is represented as a strong, fearless figure who is brave, loyal, and honest to those around him. Cyrino writes that Maximus' masculinity is defined through his upbringing as a farmer and a working-class hero.[102] A signature trait of Maximus before he fights is that he picks up dirt from the ground and wipes his hands dirty, signaling his status as a man who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. Cyrino states that Maximus' portrayal as \"a simple man of the soil responds to modern society's idealization of the countryside and its supposed virtue and purity, in stark contrast to the crime-ridden metropolis.\"[102] Maximus gains the support of his fellow gladiators and some of the Senate over the course of the film through the way he behaves and acts.\n\n\nSome philosophers have noted the role stoicism plays in Maximus' masculinity. The real life Marcus Aurelius writes in *Meditations* that stoics must \"concentrate on [their responsibilities] ... without getting stirred up or meeting anger with angers.\" Maximus' drive for vengeance causes him to turn away from his responsibilities of a role model to his son until Lucilla confronts him in his cell, whereby he realizes that his emotions are getting the better of him. When Commodus taunts Maximus about how his son \"squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross,\" stoicism shines a light on Maximus. Instead of giving in to his anger, Maximus slightly bows and refers to Commodus as \"highness\" instead of \"emperor,\" which later becomes a psychological and emotional blow to Commodus' ego. Krysta Larson, writing in \"Mother Knows Best? Evaluating the Roles of Stoic Parents in *Gladiator*,\" believes that \"if it were stoically proper to continue in one's role as a parent to a dead son, then Maximus would fulfill his role as a good Stoic father by pursuing virtuous goals and properly performing the deeds dictated by his roles rather than seeking revenge.\"[104]\n\n\nCommodus, on the other hand, is presented as the antithesis of Maximus. The film portrays Commodus as an immature, cowardly, and unreasonable man who is not fit for the demands of governing the Roman Empire. He openly complains, sobs, has trouble sleeping at night, and struggles to gain respect from the other characters. The film portrays Commodus as having only a single friend in his sister, with even his father openly admitting that his son is not moral. Driven by the lack of love obtained from his father, Commodus is \"keen to acquire the love and respect of the Roman people that his father had enjoyed but criticizes Marcus Aurelius for his intellectualism.\"[102] Cyrino compared Commodus to the presidency of George W. Bush, stating that like Commodus, \"Bush employed rhetoric imbued with overly emotional and sometimes childish tones.\"[102] Both Commodus and Bush, according to Cyrino, are \"contemptuous of guidance from advisory councils and express their scorn by means of anti-intellectual bluster.\"[102]\n\n\nAs it becomes clear Maximus is winning the respect of the crowd, Commodus becomes irritated and frustrated. When he purposefully taunts Maximus about the deaths of his family, Maximus rebukes him by calling him \"highness\" and that his time of honoring his narcissism will come to an end. This leads to him openly complaining and sobbing to Senator Falco later that night. Commodus' amoral personality intensifies when he begins to lust after his own sister and forces her to become his sex slave as punishment for her betrayal. *Gladiator* highlights the distinct personalities of Maximus and Commodus in the final battle. Prior to their duel, Commodus stabs Maximus in an effort to gain the upper hand, demonstrating his cowardly demeanor. Maximus' honor, determination, and discipline eventually overcomes Commodus' vanity, cruelty, and ambition when he stabs him in the neck.\n\n\n\n### Borrowing of Nazi imagery[edit]\n\n\nThe film's depiction of Commodus's entry into Rome borrows imagery from Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda film *Triumph of the Will* (1935), although Scott has pointed out that the iconography of Nazi rallies was itself inspired by the Roman Empire. *Gladiator* reflects back on the film by duplicating similar events that occurred during Adolf Hitler's procession. The Nazi film opens with an aerial view of Hitler arriving in a plane, while Scott shows an aerial view of Rome, quickly followed by a shot of the large crowd of people watching Commodus pass them in a procession with his chariot.[105] The first thing to appear in *Triumph of the Will* is a Nazi eagle, which is alluded to when a statue of an eagle sits atop one of the arches (and then is shortly followed by several more decorative eagles throughout the rest of the scene), leading up to the procession of Commodus. At one point in the Nazi film, a little girl gives flowers to Hitler, while Commodus is met by several girls who all give him bundles of flowers.[106]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Cultural influence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A replica of the mask worn by Maximus in *Gladiator* became the basis for the signature mask for British-American rapper MF Doom.\n*Gladiator* has been considered a cultural phenomenon since its release.[103][107][108] Prior to the release of *Gladiator*, the swords and sandal genre had fallen out of public popularity following a string of expensive box office flops such as *Cleopatra* (1963) and *The Fall of the Roman Empire* (1964).[109] In the 1990s, the historical epic genre saw a revival in popularity following the success of films such as *Dances with Wolves* (1990), *Schindler's List* (1993), *Braveheart* (1995), *Titanic* (1997), and *Saving Private Ryan* (1998).[110][111] *Gladiator* continued these films' realism with more of a focus on Ancient History, which had not been explored extensively since the 1960s.[110]\n\n\nRetrospective reviews and film critics have noted that *Gladiator*'s success spurred a revival of the historical epic genre with films during the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s such as *The Last Samurai* (2003), *Troy* (2004), *The Alamo* (2004), *King Arthur* (2004), *Alexander* (2004), *Kingdom of Heaven* (2005), *300* (2007) and its sequel *300: Rise of an Empire* (2014), *Centurion* (2010), *Robin Hood* (2010), *The Eagle* (2011), *Exodus: Gods and Kings* (2014), *The Last Duel* (2021), *The Northman* (2022), and *Napoleon* (2023).[112] The gladiator arena set piece from *Star Wars: Episode II\u00a0\u2013 Attack of the Clones* (2002), which entered production shortly after the release of *Gladiator*, has been compared to the arena setting in the film.[113][114][115]\n\n\nWhile a majority of these films were critically and commercially successful in their own right, *The Guardian*'s Steve Rose argued that the historical epic revival devolved back into parody by 2007, as none of the films have recaptured the impact of *Gladiator*. Rose also argued that after twenty years, the film's story was more relevant now than it was then with its themes of populism and fascism.[116] *Cineramble*'s James Humphreys wrote on the film's twentieth anniversary that the swords and sandal epic revival was short-lived because studios and producers focused more on *Gladiator*'s visuals rather than the quality of its storytelling and characters.[111] Humphreys argued that the film influenced several films in the fantasy and superhero film genres more than the historical epic genre itself, with the film's aesthetics helping influence Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy (2001\u20132003), the Marvel Cinematic Universe (2008\u2013present), and the DC Extended Universe (2013\u20132023).[111]\n\n\nThe film's mainstream success was responsible for an increased interest in Roman and classical history in the United States. The Cicero biography *Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician* and Gregory Hays's translation of Marcus Aurelius's *Meditations* received large spikes in sales after the release of the film.[117] According to *The New York Times*, this has been dubbed the \"Gladiator Effect\".\n\n\n\n\n> It's called \"the 'Gladiator' effect\" by writers and publishers. The snob in us likes to believe that it is always books that spin off movies. Yet in this case, it's the movies\u00a0\u2013 most recently *Gladiator* two years ago\u00a0\u2013 that have created the interest in the ancients. And not for more Roman screen colossals, but for writing that is serious or fun or both.[117]\n> \n> \n\n\n*Gladiator'*s effect on culture went beyond cinema. The film influenced numerous television series such as *Rome* (2005\u20132007) and *Game of Thrones* (2011\u20132019).[118] Jack Gleeson based his performance of Joffrey Baratheon in *Game of Thrones* on Phoenix's performance as Commodus.[119] British-American underground hip-hop artist MF Doom's signature mask was inspired by the mask worn by Maximus, having picked up one of the replicas that were sold following the film's success[120] Dialogue such as \"Are You Not Entertained,\" \"Am I Not Merciful,\" \"I Will Have My Vengeance,\" and \"Strength and Honor\" are among the most recognizable quotes and have become the subject of numerous internet memes.[121] In 2009, Maximus was featured on a 55c \"Australian Legends\" postage stamp series, with Crowe attending a ceremony to mark the creation of the stamps.[122]\n\n\nThe film became a touchstone for the careers of its cast and crew. After *Thelma & Louise* (1991), Scott faced a string of critical and commercial flops during the 1990s including *1492: Conquest of Paradise* (1992), *White Squall* (1996), and *G.I. Jane* (1997). *Gladiator* became a reversal of fortune for Scott, earning him his best acclaim and interest since *Thelma and Louise*. In the wake of *Gladiator*'s success, Scott followed up by directing *Hannibal* (2001), the highly anticipated sequel to *The Silence of the Lambs* (1991), and *Black Hawk Down* (2001).[123] *Gladiator*, along with *The Insider*, helped elevate Russell Crowe into an established A-lister and worldwide fame. His performance in *Gladiator* landed him top-billing roles in Ron Howard's *A Beautiful Mind* (2001) and Peter Weir's *Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World* (2003).[124]\n\n\n\nScott and Crowe collaborated again for *A Good Year* (2006), *American Gangster* (2007), *Body of Lies* (2008), and *Robin Hood* (2010). *Gladiator* brought fame for Phoenix, who was cast by M. Night Shyamalan for the films *Signs* (2002) and *The Village* (2004) and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as the Joker in *Joker* (2019). Harris' performance in *Gladiator* resulted in his casting as Albus Dumbledore in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (2001).[125] Several members of the cast and crew have commented on the impact the film has had on their careers and its cultural legacy. In a 2020 interview with *Yahoo!*, M\u00f6ller remarked that he continues to get recognized by many people for his performance as Hagen.[126] Scott considers the film one of the top three favorite films he has directed.[108] Crowe noted that the quality of the film has helped find new fans on television twenty years after its release.[127] When being interviewed by *Den of Geek* in 2020, Wick said this about the film's impact.\n\n\n> I think if you've been around for a while, one of the things you'll learn is that if you look at a hundred years of movies, every cycle repeats, and it's all about someone who will be able to reinvent it. Every 20 years there'll be a vampire movie, and the 20-year-old versions usually start to look kitsch. Luckily with *Gladiator* that's not the case.[107]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Modern reception[edit]\n\n\nToday, *Gladiator* is considered to be one of the greatest action films ever made, one of the greatest historical epic films ever made, and one of the greatest films of both the 2000s decade and 21st Century.\n\n\nOn their *\"*100 Best Movies Of All Time list\"*, Empire* ranked the film as the thirty-ninth best film ever made, and ranked the film as the twenty-second best film of the 21st Century.[128][129] *Gladiator* was named one of the best films of the 21st Century by *The Guardian*, and was included in Rotten Tomatoes \"The 140 Essential 2000 Movies.\"[130][131]\n\n\n*Den of Geek* and *Collider* both named *Gladiator* as the best historical epic ever made, and one of *The Guardian*'s twenty-five best action and war films.[132][133][134] Numerous websites including *Vulture* and /Film named *Gladiator* in the top ten films from Scott.[135][136]\n\n\nThe film is included in the book *1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die*.[137] The American Film Institute included *Gladiator* as one of the four-hundred films nominated for their *AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)* list, while ranking Maximus as the fiftieth greatest hero in film.[138][139] The character of Maximus was placed 12th in the *Total Film* list of 50 best movie heroes and villains[140] and 35th in the *Empire*'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters.[141]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, *Gladiator* has an approval rating of 80% based on 253 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"While not everyone will be entertained by *Gladiator*'s glum revenge story, Russell Crowe thunderously wins the crowd with a star-making turn that provides Ridley Scott's opulent resurrection of Rome a bruised heart.\"[142] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 67 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[143]\n\n\n\n## Sequel[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Gladiator 2*\n\nIn June 2001, developments for a *Gladiator* follow-up began in the form of potential for either a prequel or a sequel, with David Franzoni in early negotiations once again to write the script. [144] The following year, a sequel was announced to be moving forward with John Logan serving as screenwriter. The plot, set fifteen years later, included the Praetorian Guards rule of Rome and an older-aged Lucius searching for the truth about his biological father. Franzoni signed on as producer, alongside Douglas Wick and Walter Parkes.[145] In December 2002, the film's plot was announced to include prequel events regarding the parentage of Lucius, as well as sequel events depicting the resurrection of Maximus. Producers and Russell Crowe collaboratively researched extensively, ancient Roman beliefs regarding the afterlife.[146] By September 2003, Scott announced that the script was completed, while confirming that the story would primarily center around the secret son of Maximus, being Lucius.[147]\n\n\nIn May 2006, Scott stated that while development on the project continues, the exact story of the film has yet to be figured out. The filmmaker stated that all the creative minds that were involved with *Gladiator* are working on how to continue from where the story left off. While Crowe favors a fantasy element that would bring Maximus back to life, Scott believes a grounded historical-fiction approach is the better option. Scott confirmed that Lucius will be revealed as the son of Maximus and Lucilla, while stating that the script will be more complex compared to the first movie with the corruption of Rome.[148]\n\n\nDuring this time, Nick Cave was commissioned to write a new draft of the script which he wrote under the working title of \"Christ Killer\". The writer described the plot as a \"deities vs. deity vs. humanity\" story, where the premise involves Maximus being resurrected as an immortal eternal warrior for the Roman gods, after living in purgatory since his death. The story would follow Maximus, who is sent to Earth and tasked with stopping the momentum of Christianity by killing Jesus Christ and His disciples, as their movement was gradually siphoning off the Pagan power and vitality. During this mission, Maximus is tricked into murdering his own son, and cursed to live forever, fighting amongst: the Crusades, WWII, and the Vietnam War. The ending would reveal that in the modern-day, the character now works at The Pentagon. The script was ultimately rejected and scrapped.[149][150][151][152] After experiencing financial difficulties in the 2000s, DreamWorks Pictures was sold to Paramount Pictures in 2006 and any development on the sequel was halted.[153]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Scott stated that his concerns with prior difficulties of developing a script where Maximus is reintroduced after being deceased had been resolved. The filmmaker expressed enthusiasm for the future of the project, while discussions with Russell Crowe to reprise his role were ongoing.[154] In November 2018, it was announced that Paramount was officially green-lighting the development of a sequel, with Scott in early-negotiations to once again serve as director. The project would be a joint-venture production between Paramount, Scott Free Productions, and Parkes/MacDonald Productions with Universal as a co-financing partner.[155]\n\n\nIn June 2019, producers stated that they \"wouldn't touch [*Gladiator*] unless we felt in a way to do it was legitimate\". The script was revealed to take place 25\u201330 years after the first film.[156] The plot is intended to center around Lucius.[157] In April 2021, Chris Hemsworth approached Crowe with a proposal to become involved with the project. As a fan of the first installment, Hemsworth proposed serving as co-producer in order to see the film realized. While working together on *Thor: Love and Thunder*, the two actors shared additional ideas for where the story for a *Gladiator 2* could go.[158] By September 2021, Scott stated that the script was once again being worked on with his intention being to direct the sequel upon the completion of production on his current project, *Napoleon*.[159]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Paul Mescal was in final talks to star in the upcoming sequel, as Lucius.[160][161][162] Working from a script written by David Scarpa,[7] Scott will produce the film alongside Michael Pruss, Doug Wick and Lucy Fisher. Janty Yates and Arthur Max, the costume designer and production designer, respectively, of the original film are also set to return for the sequel.[162][163] Later that month, Crowe stated that the story will center around Lucius becoming emperor, while stating that he will not be involved in the project.[164] In March 2023, Denzel Washington and Barry Keoghan joined the cast.[165] Joseph Quinn also joined in April while Connie Nielsen was announced to be returning as Lucius' mother. On May 19, 2023, Keoghan has dropped out of the sequel as a result of scheduling conflicts, with Fred Hechinger in talks to replace him. The film is scheduled to be released in the United States on November 22, 2024.[166] [167]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Ancient Rome portal\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* List of films set in ancient Rome\n* Lists of historical films\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Gladiator\u00a0\u2013 Cast, Crew, Director and Awards\". *The New York Times*. 2015.

This award goes to the producers of the film and is the only category in which every member of the Academy is eligible to submit a nomination and vote on the final ballot.[1] The Best Picture category is traditionally the final award of the night and is widely considered as the most prestigious honor of the ceremony.[2][3][4]\n\n\nThe Grand Staircase columns at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the Academy Awards ceremonies have been held since 2002, showcase every film that has won the Best Picture title since the award's inception.[5] There have been 591 films nominated for Best Picture and 95 winners.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Category name changes[edit]\n\n\nAt the 1st Academy Awards ceremony held in 1929 (for films made in 1927 and 1928), there were two categories of awards that were each considered the top award of the night: \"Outstanding Picture\" and \"Unique and Artistic Picture,\" the former being won by the war epic *Wings*, and the latter by the art film *Sunrise*. Each award was intended to honor different and equally important aspects of superior filmmaking. In particular, *The Jazz Singer* was disqualified from both awards, since its use of synchronized sound made the film a *sui generis* item that would have unfairly competed against either category, and the Academy granted the film an honorary award instead.[7]\n\n\nThe following year, the Academy dropped the *Unique and Artistic Picture* award, deciding retroactively that the award won by *Wings* was the highest honor that could be awarded, and allowed synchronized sound films to compete for the award.[8] Although the award kept the title *Outstanding Picture* for the next ceremony, the name underwent several changes over the years as seen below. Since 1962, the award has been simply called *Best Picture*.[6]\n\n\n\n* 1927/28\u20131928/29: **Academy Award for Outstanding Picture**\n* 1929/30\u20131940: **Academy Award for Outstanding Production**\n* 1941\u20131943: **Academy Award for Outstanding Motion Picture**\n* 1944\u20131961: **Academy Award for Best Motion Picture**\n* 1962\u2013present: **Academy Award for Best Picture**\n\n\n### Recipients[edit]\n\n\nUntil 1950, this award was presented to a representative of the production company. That year the protocol was changed so that the award was presented to all credited producers. This rule was modified in 1999 to apply a maximum limit of three producers receiving the award, after the five producers of *Shakespeare in Love* had received the award.[9][10][11]\n\n\nAs of 2020[update], the \"Special Rules for the Best Picture of the Year Award\" limit recipients to those who meet two main requirements:[12]\n\n\n\n* Those with screen credit of \"producer\" or \"produced by\", explicitly excluding those with the screen credit \"executive producer, co-producer, associate producer, line producer, or produced in association with\"\n* those three or fewer producers who have performed the major portion of the producing functions\n\n\nThe rules allow a *bona fide* team of not more than two people to be considered a single \"producer\" if the two individuals have had an established producing partnership as determined by the Producers Guild of America Producing Partnership Panel. Final determination of the qualifying producer nominees for each nominated picture will be made by the Producers Branch Executive Committee, including the right to name any additional qualified producer as a nominee.[12]\n\n\nThe Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously included among the four producers nominated for *The Reader*.[13] As of 2014[update] the Producers Branch Executive Committee determines such exceptions, noting they take place only in \"rare and extraordinary circumstance[s].\"[12]\n\n\nSteven Spielberg currently holds the record for most nominations at twelve, winning one, while Kathleen Kennedy holds the record for most nominations without a win at eight. Sam Spiegel and Saul Zaentz tie for the most wins with three each. As for the time when the Oscar was given to production companies instead, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer holds the record with five wins and 40 nominations.\n\n\n\n### Best Picture and Best Director[edit]\n\n\nThe Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director have been closely linked throughout their history. Of the 95 films that have won Best Picture, 68 have also been awarded Best Director. Only six films have been awarded Best Picture without receiving a Best Director nomination: *Wings* directed by William A. Wellman (1927/28), *Grand Hotel* directed by Edmund Goulding (1931/32), *Driving Miss Daisy* directed by Bruce Beresford (1989), *Argo* directed by Ben Affleck (2012), *Green Book* directed by Peter Farrelly (2018), and *CODA* directed by Sian Heder (2021). The only two Best Director winners to win for films that did not receive a Best Picture nomination were during the early years of the awards: Lewis Milestone for *Two Arabian Knights* (1927/28), and Frank Lloyd for *The Divine Lady* (1928/29).[14]\n\n\n\n### Nomination limit increased[edit]\n\n\nOn June 24, 2009, AMPAS announced that the number of films to be nominated in the Best Picture award category would increase from five to ten, starting with the 82nd Academy Awards (2009).[15] Although the Academy never officially said so, many commenters noted the expansion was likely in part a response to public criticism of *The Dark Knight* and *WALL-E* (both 2008) (and, in previous years, other blockbusters and popular films) not being nominated for Best Picture.[16][17][18] Officially, the Academy said the rule change was a throwback to the Academy's early years in the 1930s and 1940s, when eight to 12 films were nominated each year. \"Having 10 Best Picture nominees is going to allow Academy voters to recognize and include some of the fantastic movies that often show up in the other Oscar categories but have been squeezed out of the race for the top prize,\" AMPAS President Sid Ganis said in a press conference. \"I can't wait to see what that list of 10 looks like when the nominees are announced in February.\"[15]\n\n\nAt the same time, the voting system was switched from first-past-the-post to instant runoff voting (also known as preferential voting).[19] In 2011, the Academy revised the rule again so that the number of films nominated was between five and ten; nominated films must earn either 5% of first-place rankings or 5% after an abbreviated variation of the single transferable vote nominating process.[20] Bruce Davis, the Academy executive director at the time, said, \"A Best Picture nomination should be an indication of extraordinary merit. If there are only eight pictures that truly earn that honor in a given year, we shouldn't feel an obligation to round out the number.\"[21] This system lasted until 2021, when the Academy reverted back to a set number of ten nominees from the 94th Academy Awards onward.[22]\n\n\n\n### Language and country of origin[edit]\n\n\nOnly fourteen non-English language films have been nominated in the category: *La Grande Illusion* (French, 1938); *Z* (French, 1969); *The Emigrants* (Swedish, 1972); *Cries and Whispers* (Swedish, 1973); *The Postman (Il Postino)* (Italian/Spanish, 1995); *Life Is Beautiful* (Italian, 1998); *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* (Mandarin Chinese, 2000); *Letters from Iwo Jima* (Japanese, 2006, but ineligible for Best Foreign Language Film because it was an American production); *Amour* (French, 2012); *Roma* (Spanish/Mixtec, 2018); *Parasite* (Korean, 2019); *Minari* (Korean, 2020, but ineligible for Best International Feature Film because it was an American production);[23] *Drive My Car* (Japanese, 2021) and *All Quiet on the Western Front* (German, 2022). *Parasite* became the first film not in English to win Best Picture.[24][25]\n\n\nOnly ten films wholly financed outside the United States have won Best Picture, eight of which were financed, in part or in whole, by the United Kingdom: *Hamlet* (1948), *Tom Jones* (1963), *A Man for All Seasons* (1966), *Chariots of Fire* (1981), *Gandhi* (1982), *The Last Emperor* (1987), *Slumdog Millionaire* (2008), and *The King's Speech* (2010). The ninth film, *The Artist* (2011), was financed in France and the tenth film, *Parasite* (2019), was financed in South Korea.[26]\n\n\n\n### Rating[edit]\n\n\nSince 1968, most Best Picture winners have been rated R under the Motion Picture Association's rating system. *Oliver!* is the only G-rated film and *Midnight Cowboy* is the only X-rated (now NC-17) film, so far, to win Best Picture; they won in back-to-back years, 1968 and 1969. The latter has since been downgraded to an R rating. Eleven films have won with a PG rating: the first was *Patton* (1970) and the most recent was *Driving Miss Daisy* (1989). Eleven more films have won with a PG-13 rating (which was introduced in 1984): the first was *The Last Emperor* (1987) and the most recent was *CODA* (2021).\n\n\n\n### Genres[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

The latter two were nominated after the Academy expanded the number of nominees, but none have won. \n\n\nNo comic book film has won, and only three have ever been nominated: *Skippy* (1931), *Black Panther* (2018), and *Joker* (2019).[27]\n\n\nOnly two fantasy films have won: *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003) and *The Shape of Water* (2017), although more have been nominated. \n\n\n*The Silence of the Lambs* (1991) is the only horror film to win Best Picture, and only five others have been nominated for Best Picture: *The Exorcist* (1973), *Jaws* (1975), *The Sixth Sense* (1999), *Black Swan* (2010), and *Get Out* (2017). \n\n\nSeveral science-fiction films have been nominated for Best Picture, though *Everything Everywhere All at Once* (2022) was the first one to win.[28]\n\n\n*Titanic* (1997) is the only disaster film to win Best Picture, though other such films have been nominated, including *Airport* (1970) *and The Towering Inferno* (1974).\n\n\nThe Best Documentary Feature category was initiated in 1941, leaving *Chang* as the only documentary feature previously nominated, and that in the \"Unique and Artistic Production\" category at the 1927/28 awards.\n\n\nSeveral musical adaptations based on material previously filmed in non-musical form have won Best Picture, including *Gigi*, *West Side Story*, *My Fair Lady*, *The Sound of Music*, *Oliver!*, and *Chicago*.\n\n\nSeveral epics or historical epic films have won Best Picture, including the first recipient *Wings*. Others include *Cimarron*, *Cavalcade*, *Gone with the Wind*, *The Bridge on the River Kwai*, *Ben-Hur*, *Lawrence of Arabia*, *Patton*, *The Godfather*, *The Godfather Part II*, *The Last Emperor*, *Dances with Wolves*, *Schindler's List*, *Forrest Gump*, *Braveheart*, *The English Patient*, *Titanic*, *Gladiator*, and *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*.\n\n\n\n### Sequel nominations and winners[edit]\n\n\nNine films that were presented as direct sequels have been nominated for Best Picture: *The Bells of St. Mary's* (1945; the sequel to the 1944 winner, *Going My Way*), *The Godfather Part II* (1974), *The Godfather Part III* (1990), *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* (2002), *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003), *Toy Story 3* (2010), *Mad Max: Fury Road* (2015)*, Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022) and *Top Gun: Maverick* (2022).\n\n\n*Toy Story 3*, *Mad Max: Fury Road* and *Top Gun: Maverick* are the only sequels to be nominated without any predecessors being nominated. *The Godfather Part II* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* are the only sequels to have won the award, and their respective trilogies are the only series to have three films nominated. *The Godfather* series is the only film series with multiple Best Picture winners, with the first film winning the award for 1972 and the second film winning the award for 1974.[23]\n\n\nAnother nominee, *Broadway Melody of 1936*, was a follow-up of sorts to previous winner *The Broadway Melody*, but beyond the title and some music, the two films have mutually independent stories. *The Silence of the Lambs* was adapted from the sequel novel to *Red Dragon*. The latter had been adapted for film as *Manhunter* by a different studio, and the two films have different casts and creative teams and were not presented as a series.[29]\n\n\n*The Lion in Winter* features Peter O'Toole as King Henry II, a role he had played previously in the film *Becket*, but *The Lion in Winter* is not a sequel to *Becket*. Similarly, *The Queen* features Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, a role he had played previously in the television film *The Deal*. Christine Langan, producer of both productions, described *The Queen* as not being a direct sequel, only that it reunited the same creative team.[30]\n\n\nClint Eastwood's *Letters from Iwo Jima* was a companion piece to his film *Flags of Our Fathers* that was released earlier the same year. These two films depict the same battle from the different viewpoints of Japanese and United States military forces; the two films were shot back-to-back.\n\n\nIn addition, *Black Panther* is a continuation of the events that occurred in *Captain America: Civil War* and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n\n\n### Remake nominations and winners[edit]\n\n\nAlong similar lines to sequels, there have been few nominees and winners that are either remakes or adaptations of the same source materials or subjects. *Ben-Hur*, which won Best Picture of 1959, is a remake of the 1925 silent film with a similar title and both were adapted from Lew Wallace's 1880 novel *Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ*. *The Departed*, which won Best Picture of 2006, is a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film *Infernal Affairs* and is the first remake of a non-English language or international film to win. Other nominees include 1963's *Cleopatra* about the title last queen of Egypt following the 1934 version, 2018's *A Star is Born* following the 1937 film of the same name, and 2019's *Little Women* following the 1933 film of the same name with both being adaptations of the 1868 novel.[31] *True Grit*, which was nominated for Best Picture of 2010, is the second adaptation of Charles Portis's 1968 novel following the 1969 film of the same name. Four of the nominees for the 94th ceremony were based on source material previously made into films: *CODA*, *Dune*, *Nightmare Alley*, and *West Side Story*. The 2021 version of *West Side Story* became the second adaptation of the same source material for a previous Best Picture winner to be nominated for the same award after 1962's *Mutiny on the Bounty*.[32] For that same ceremony, *CODA* became the second remake of a non-English-language or international film to win. The 2022 German-language *All Quiet on the Western Front* is the second adaptation of the 1929 novel after the 1930 English-language film, and the third adaptation of the same source material of a previous Best Picture winner.[33]\n\n\n\n### Silent film winners[edit]\n\n\nAt the 1st Academy Awards, the Best Picture award (then named \"Academy Award for Outstanding Picture\") was presented to the 1927 silent film *Wings*.\n\n\n*The Artist* (2011) was the first essentially silent (with the exception of a single scene of dialogue, and a dream sequence with sound effects) film since *Wings* to win Best Picture. It was the first silent nominee since 1928's *The Patriot*. It was the first Best Picture winner to be produced entirely in black-and-white since 1960's *The Apartment*. (*Schindler's List*, the 1993 winner, was predominantly black-and-white but contains some color sequences.)[26]\n\n\n\n### Version availability[edit]\n\n\nNo Best Picture winner has been lost, though a few such as *All Quiet on the Western Front* and *Lawrence of Arabia* exist only in a form altered from their original, award-winning release form. This has usually been due to editing for reissue (and subsequently partly restored by archivists). Other winners and nominees, such as *Tom Jones* (prior to its 2018 reissues by The Criterion Collection and the British Film Institute) and *Star Wars*, are widely available only in subsequently altered versions. *The Broadway Melody* originally had some sequences photographed in two-color Technicolor. This footage survives only in black and white.[34]\n\n\nThe 1928 film *The Patriot* is the only Best Picture nominee that is lost (about one-third is extant).[35] *The Racket*, also from 1928, was believed lost for many years until a print was found in Howard Hughes' archives. It has since been restored and shown on Turner Classic Movies.[36] The only surviving complete prints of 1931's *East Lynne* and 1934's *The White Parade* exist within the UCLA film archive.[37]\n\n\n\n### Diversity standards[edit]\n\n\nThe Academy has established a set of \"representation and inclusion standards\" which a film will be required to satisfy in order to compete in the Best Picture category, starting with the 96th Academy Awards for films released in 2023.[38] There are four general standards, of which a film must satisfy two to be considered for Best Picture: (a) on-screen representation, themes and narratives; (b) creative leadership and project team; (c) industry access and opportunities; and (d) audience development.[38] As explained by Vox, the standards \"basically break down into two big buckets: standards promoting more inclusive representation and standards promoting more inclusive employment\".[39] The standards are intended to provide greater opportunities for employment, in cast, crew, studio apprenticeships and internships, and development, marketing, publicity, and distribution executives, among underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, women, LGBTQ+ people, and persons with cognitive or physical disabilities, or who are deaf or hard of hearing.[38]\n\n\nFor the 94th and 95th Academy Awards (films released in 2021 and 2022), filmmakers were required to submit a confidential Academy Inclusion Standards form to be considered for Best Picture but were not required to fulfill the standards.[39] These standards will only apply to the Best Picture category and do not affect a film's eligibility in other Oscar categories.[38]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\n### Ceremony mistake[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, at the 89th Academy Awards, presenter Faye Dunaway read *La La Land* as the winner of the award. However, she and Warren Beatty had mistakenly been given the duplicate envelope for the \"Best Actress in a Leading Role\" award, which Emma Stone had won for her role in *La La Land* moments prior. In the resulting chaos, it was *La La Land* producer Jordan Horowitz who finally announced\u2014two minutes and twenty-seven seconds later\u2014that *Moonlight* was the real winner.[40]\n\n\n\n## Winners and nominees[edit]\n\n\nIn the list below, winners are listed first in the gold row, followed by the other nominees.[6] Except for the early years (when the Academy used a non-calendar year), the year shown is the one in which the film first premiered in Los Angeles County, California; normally this is also the year of first release, however, it may be the year after first release (as with *Casablanca* and, if the film-festival premiere is considered, *Crash*). This is also the year before the ceremony at which the award is given; for example, a film exhibited theatrically during 2005 was eligible for consideration for the 2005 Best Picture Oscar, awarded in 2006. The number of the ceremony (1st, 2nd, etc.) appears in parentheses after the awards year, linked to the article on that ceremony. Each individual entry shows the title followed by nominee.\n\n\nUntil 1950, the Best Picture award was given to the production company; from 1951 on, it has gone to the producer or producers. The Academy used the producer credits of the Producers Guild of America (PGA) until 1998, when all five producers of *Shakespeare in Love* made speeches after its win.[9][10] A three-producer limit has been applied some years since.[10][11] There was controversy over the exclusion of some PGA-credited producers of *Crash* and *Little Miss Sunshine*.[11] The Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously among the four nominated for *The Reader*.[13] However, now any number of producers on a film can be nominated for Best Picture, should they be deemed eligible.\n\n\nFor the first ceremony, three films were nominated for the award. For the following three years, five films were nominated for the award. This was expanded to eight in 1933, to ten in 1934, and to twelve in 1935, before being dropped back to ten in 1937. In 1945, it was further reduced to five. This number remained until 2009, when the limit was raised to ten; it was adjusted from 2011 to 2020 to vary between five and ten, but has been a full ten since 2021.\n\n\nFor the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years. For example, the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3, 1930, recognized films that were released between August 1, 1928, and July 31, 1929. Starting with the 7th Academy Awards, held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31. This has been the rule every year since except 2020, when the end date was extended to February 28, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2021, which was correspondingly limited to March 1 to December 31.\n\n\n\nindicates the winner\n\n### 1920s[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year of Film Release\n | Film\n | Film Studio\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **1927/28**(1st)  |\n| ***Wings*** | **Famous Players\u2013Lasky (Lucien Hubbard, Jesse L.

Based on the 2017 nonfiction book *Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century* by Jessica Bruder, it stars Frances McDormand as a widow who leaves to travel around the United States in her van as a nomad. David Strathairn also stars in a supporting role. A number of real-life nomads appear as fictionalized versions of themselves, including Linda May, Swankie and Bob Wells.\n\n\n*Nomadland* premiered on September 11, 2020, at the Venice Film Festival, where it won the Golden Lion. It also won the People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival. It had a one-week streaming limited release on December 4, 2020, and was distributed by Searchlight Pictures in selected IMAX theaters in the United States on January 29, 2021, and simultaneously in theaters, and streaming digitally on Hulu, on February 19, 2021. The film was a box office success, grossing $39 million worldwide against its $5 million budget and received widespread critical acclaim for its direction, editing, screenplay and cinematography, as well as the performances of McDormand and Strathairn. It was the third-highest rated film of 2020 on Metacritic,[7] which found it to be the most frequently ranked by critics and publications as one of the best films of the year.\n\n\nAt the 93rd Academy Awards, it won Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress for McDormand, from a total of six nominations.[8] Zhao became the first Asian woman and the second woman ever to win Best Director; McDormand became the first woman and fourth person to win Academy Awards for both acting and producing, and the first person ever to win Academy Awards as producer and performer for the same film.[9] It is also the first Searchlight release to win Best Picture since the studio's ownership under Walt Disney Studios, following Disney's acquisition of the 21st Century Fox assets. It also won Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama and Best Director at the 78th Golden Globe Awards,[10] four awards including Best Film at the 74th British Academy Film Awards,[11] and four awards including Best Film at the 36th Independent Spirit Awards.[12] It has since been cited as one of the best films of the 21st century.[13][14][15]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Fern loses her job after the US Gypsum plant in Empire, Nevada, shuts down; she had worked there for years along with her husband, who recently died. Fern sells most of her belongings and purchases a van to live in and travel the country searching for work. She takes a seasonal job at an Amazon fulfillment center through the winter.\n\n\nLinda, a friend and co-worker, invites Fern to visit a desert rendezvous in Arizona organized by Bob Wells, which provides a support system and community for fellow nomads. Fern initially declines, but changes her mind as the weather turns cold and she struggles to find work in the area. There, Fern meets fellow nomads and learns basic survival and self-sufficiency skills for the road.\n\n\nWhen Fern's van blows a tire, she visits the van of a nearby nomad, Swankie, to ask for a ride into town to buy a spare. Swankie chastises Fern for not being prepared and invites her to learn road survival skills; they become friends. Swankie tells Fern about her cancer diagnosis and shortened life expectancy and her plan to make good memories on the road rather than waste away in a hospital. They eventually part ways.\n\n\nFern takes a job as a camp host at the Cedar Pass Campgrounds in Badlands National Park in South Dakota. Also working there is Dave, another nomad she met and danced with at the desert community. When he falls ill with diverticulitis, Fern visits him at the hospital where he has had emergency surgery. They take restaurant jobs at Wall Drug in South Dakota. One night, Dave's son visits the restaurant looking for him, telling him that his wife is pregnant and asking him to meet his grandchild. He is hesitant, but Fern encourages him to go. Dave suggests that she come with him, but she declines.\n\n\nFern takes a new job at a sugar beet processing plant, but her van breaks down, and she cannot afford the repairs. Unable to borrow money, she visits her sister's family at their home in California. Fern's sister lends her the money to get the van fixed. She questions why Fern was never around in their lives and why Fern stayed in Empire after her husband died, but she tells Fern that she is brave to be so independent. Fern later visits Dave and his son's family in Point Arena, California, learning that Dave has decided to stay with them long-term. He admits to having feelings for her and invites her to stay with him permanently in a guest house, but she decides to leave after only a few days, heading to the ocean.\n\n\nFern returns to her seasonal Amazon job and later revisits the Arizona rendezvous. There, she learns that Swankie has died, and she and the other nomads pay tribute to her life by tossing stones into the campfire. Fern opens up to Bob about her loving relationship with her late husband, and he shares the story of his son's suicide. Bob espouses the view that goodbyes are not final in the nomad community as its members always promise to see each other again \"down the road\".\n\n\nFern returns to the nearly abandoned town of Empire to dispose of the belongings she has been keeping in a storage unit. She visits the factory and the home she shared with her husband before returning to the road.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Frances McDormand as Fern\n* David Strathairn as Dave\n* Linda May as Linda\n* Charlene Swankie as Swankie\n* Bob Wells as Bob Wells\n* Peter Spears as Peter\n* Derek Endres as Derek\n* Tay Strathairn as James\n* Gay DeForest as Gay\n* Patricia Grier as Patty\n* Angela Reyes as Angela\n* Carl R.

After seeing Chlo\u00e9 Zhao's film *The Rider* at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, McDormand decided to approach her about the project.[16] She and Spears met with Zhao at the 33rd Independent Spirit Awards in March 2018, and Zhao agreed to write and direct the film.[17]\n\n\nFilming for *Nomadland* took place over four months in fall 2018, with writer-director Zhao splitting time between the set and pre-production for *Eternals* (2021). McDormand, Zhao, and other crew members lived out of vans over the course of production.[18] David Strathairn, and real-life nomads Linda May, Swankie, and Bob Wells, also star. Many other real-life nomads appear throughout the film. McDormand, Spears, Mollye Asher, Dan Janvey, and Zhao produced the film.[19]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\nSearchlight Pictures acquired the worldwide distribution rights for *Nomadland* in February 2019.[20] The film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on September 11, 2020, and screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on the same day.[21] At Venice, the film won several awards, including the festival's top honor, the Golden Lion.[22][23] At Toronto, the film won the People's Choice Award.[24] It is the first film to win the top prize at both Venice and Toronto.[25]\n\n\nIn association with Searchlight, Film at Lincoln Center held exclusive virtual screenings of the film for one week only beginning on December 4, 2020, the film's initial release date before Searchlight delayed it to February 19, 2021, due to concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic.[26][27] It was released in IMAX theaters on January 29, 2021, with a wide theatrical and drive-in release in the United States on February 19, and streaming on Hulu the same day.[28] A two-week preview season in certain regions of Australia and New Zealand began on December 26, 2020, before a wider release on March 4, 2021.[29]\n\n\nInternationally, the film is also available on Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar. The release date on Disney+ was April 9, 2021 in Canada, and April 30, 2021, in most other countries.[30][31][32] Although originally scheduled for a limited release in China starting on April 23, 2021,[33] the film has still not been shown in any theaters there.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n*Nomadland* was released on Blu-ray and digital streaming services on April 27, 2021, by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment.[34]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Nomadland* grossed $3.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $35.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $39.1 million.[5][6]\n\n\nAlthough Searchlight did not publicly release *Nomadland'*s grosses, it was released in North America the same day as *The Little Things*, and sources estimated a gross of $170,000 from its two-week IMAX run, then $503,000 from 1,175 theaters in its wide opening weekend on February 19, for a total of $673,000. Social media monitor RelishMix noted online response was \"mixed-to-leaning-positive\" among audiences.[35] In its second wide release weekend, it earned an estimated $330,000 from 1,200 theaters, for a four-week running total of $1.1 million.[36]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Frances McDormand's performance received critical acclaim and won her the Academy Award for Best Actress.\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 93% of 436 critic reviews were positive, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"A poetic character study on the forgotten and downtrodden, *Nomadland* beautifully captures the restlessness left in the wake of the Great Recession.\"[37] According to Metacritic, which assigned it a weighted average score of 89 out of 100 based on 55 critics, the film received \"universal acclaim\".[38]\n\n\nWriting for *The Hollywood Reporter*, David Rooney called the film a \"powerful character study\", and added, \"Like Zhao's earlier work, *Nomadland* is an unassuming film, its aptly meandering, unhurried non-narrative layering impressions rather than building a story with the standard markers. But the cumulative effect of its many quiet, seemingly inconsequential encounters and moments of solitary contemplation is a unique portrait of outsider existence.\"[1] Adrian Horton of *The Guardian* gave the film a positive review, stating, \"*Nomadland* has garnered industry praise as a likely frontrunner for the best picture Oscar ... The word of mouth is warranted.\"[39] A.O. Scott of *The New York Times* similarly gave a positive review, writing \"It's like discovering a new country, one you may want to visit more than once.\"[40] Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film an \"A\u2212\" and said, \"director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao works magic with McDormand's face and the real world around it, delivering a profound rumination on the impulse to leave society in the dust.\"[41] Some reviewers felt the film idealized financial despair. Critic Tim Brayton called it \"108 minutes of poverty tourism\",[42] while WBUR's Sean Burns wrote \"Zhao has made *The Grapes of Wrath* without the wrath\".[43]\n\n\nIndieWire's poll of 231 critics included *Nomadland* in its Best Movies of 2020.[44] According to Metacritic, the film was ranked the best of 2020 by critics more often than any other.[45] In 2021, it was included on *Forbes*'s list of \"The Top 150 Greatest Films Of The 21st Century.\"[14] In 2022, it ranked number 10 on *Time Out*'s list of \"The 100 Best Movies of the 21st century So Far,\" saying that the film \"expertly stitches together realism, moments of sheer transcendence and a lightly-worn radicalism in a way that feels nothing but unpatronizing and empathetic.\"[13] In August 2023, *Collider* ranked the film at number 13 on its list of \"The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far,\" calling it \"a moving portrayal of the American nomadic lifestyle\" and praised the lead character of Fern as \"endearing ... because of her self-confidence, but it never feels like she\u2019s attempting to impose her choice of lifestyle on anyone else.\"[15]\n\n\n\n### Reaction in China[edit]\n\n\nZhao and the film's success prior to and leading up to the Golden Globes and the Oscars were initially praised on Chinese social media outlets, as well as official state-controlled news media.[46][47][48]\n\n\nAfter the Golden Globes, Zhao was scrutinized by Chinese netizens over her remarks in a 2013 interview for *Filmmaker* magazine, in which she described China as \"a place where there are lies everywhere\". In response to the controversy, *Nomadland* was pulled from theatrical release by Disney China, and the 93rd Academy Awards were censored by Chinese media outlets along with all mention of Zhao or the film on social media.[49][50]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by Nomadland\n\n*Nomadland* won the Golden Lion upon premiering at the Venice Film Festival, and also won the People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival.[51][52][53] It received four nominations at the 78th Golden Globe Awards, winning Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama and Best Director; in winning the latter award, Zhao became the second woman and the first East Asian woman to do so.[10][54] It received five nominations at the 36th Independent Spirit Awards and six nominations at the 26th Critics' Choice Awards, winning four awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.[55][56] At the 27th Screen Actors Guild Awards, McDormand received a nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.[57]\nThe film won the BAFTA Award for Best Film in 2021.[58][59] The film received six nominations at the 93rd Academy Awards, winning Best Director[60] (with Zhao becoming the second woman and first non-white woman to do so),[61] Best Picture,[62] and Best Actress awards in 2021.[63] Both the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named *Nomadland* as one of the top 10 films of 2020.[64][65]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Empire, Nevada\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Rooney, David (September 11, 2020). \"'Nomadland': Film Review Venice 2020\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

This award goes to the producers of the film and is the only category in which every member of the Academy is eligible to submit a nomination and vote on the final ballot.[1] The Best Picture category is traditionally the final award of the night and is widely considered as the most prestigious honor of the ceremony.[2][3][4]\n\n\nThe Grand Staircase columns at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the Academy Awards ceremonies have been held since 2002, showcase every film that has won the Best Picture title since the award's inception.[5] There have been 591 films nominated for Best Picture and 95 winners.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Category name changes[edit]\n\n\nAt the 1st Academy Awards ceremony held in 1929 (for films made in 1927 and 1928), there were two categories of awards that were each considered the top award of the night: \"Outstanding Picture\" and \"Unique and Artistic Picture,\" the former being won by the war epic *Wings*, and the latter by the art film *Sunrise*. Each award was intended to honor different and equally important aspects of superior filmmaking. In particular, *The Jazz Singer* was disqualified from both awards, since its use of synchronized sound made the film a *sui generis* item that would have unfairly competed against either category, and the Academy granted the film an honorary award instead.[7]\n\n\nThe following year, the Academy dropped the *Unique and Artistic Picture* award, deciding retroactively that the award won by *Wings* was the highest honor that could be awarded, and allowed synchronized sound films to compete for the award.[8] Although the award kept the title *Outstanding Picture* for the next ceremony, the name underwent several changes over the years as seen below. Since 1962, the award has been simply called *Best Picture*.[6]\n\n\n\n* 1927/28\u20131928/29: **Academy Award for Outstanding Picture**\n* 1929/30\u20131940: **Academy Award for Outstanding Production**\n* 1941\u20131943: **Academy Award for Outstanding Motion Picture**\n* 1944\u20131961: **Academy Award for Best Motion Picture**\n* 1962\u2013present: **Academy Award for Best Picture**\n\n\n### Recipients[edit]\n\n\nUntil 1950, this award was presented to a representative of the production company. That year the protocol was changed so that the award was presented to all credited producers. This rule was modified in 1999 to apply a maximum limit of three producers receiving the award, after the five producers of *Shakespeare in Love* had received the award.[9][10][11]\n\n\nAs of 2020[update], the \"Special Rules for the Best Picture of the Year Award\" limit recipients to those who meet two main requirements:[12]\n\n\n\n* Those with screen credit of \"producer\" or \"produced by\", explicitly excluding those with the screen credit \"executive producer, co-producer, associate producer, line producer, or produced in association with\"\n* those three or fewer producers who have performed the major portion of the producing functions\n\n\nThe rules allow a *bona fide* team of not more than two people to be considered a single \"producer\" if the two individuals have had an established producing partnership as determined by the Producers Guild of America Producing Partnership Panel. Final determination of the qualifying producer nominees for each nominated picture will be made by the Producers Branch Executive Committee, including the right to name any additional qualified producer as a nominee.[12]\n\n\nThe Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously included among the four producers nominated for *The Reader*.[13] As of 2014[update] the Producers Branch Executive Committee determines such exceptions, noting they take place only in \"rare and extraordinary circumstance[s].\"[12]\n\n\nSteven Spielberg currently holds the record for most nominations at twelve, winning one, while Kathleen Kennedy holds the record for most nominations without a win at eight. Sam Spiegel and Saul Zaentz tie for the most wins with three each. As for the time when the Oscar was given to production companies instead, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer holds the record with five wins and 40 nominations.\n\n\n\n### Best Picture and Best Director[edit]\n\n\nThe Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director have been closely linked throughout their history. Of the 95 films that have won Best Picture, 68 have also been awarded Best Director. Only six films have been awarded Best Picture without receiving a Best Director nomination: *Wings* directed by William A. Wellman (1927/28), *Grand Hotel* directed by Edmund Goulding (1931/32), *Driving Miss Daisy* directed by Bruce Beresford (1989), *Argo* directed by Ben Affleck (2012), *Green Book* directed by Peter Farrelly (2018), and *CODA* directed by Sian Heder (2021). The only two Best Director winners to win for films that did not receive a Best Picture nomination were during the early years of the awards: Lewis Milestone for *Two Arabian Knights* (1927/28), and Frank Lloyd for *The Divine Lady* (1928/29).[14]\n\n\n\n### Nomination limit increased[edit]\n\n\nOn June 24, 2009, AMPAS announced that the number of films to be nominated in the Best Picture award category would increase from five to ten, starting with the 82nd Academy Awards (2009).[15] Although the Academy never officially said so, many commenters noted the expansion was likely in part a response to public criticism of *The Dark Knight* and *WALL-E* (both 2008) (and, in previous years, other blockbusters and popular films) not being nominated for Best Picture.[16][17][18] Officially, the Academy said the rule change was a throwback to the Academy's early years in the 1930s and 1940s, when eight to 12 films were nominated each year. \"Having 10 Best Picture nominees is going to allow Academy voters to recognize and include some of the fantastic movies that often show up in the other Oscar categories but have been squeezed out of the race for the top prize,\" AMPAS President Sid Ganis said in a press conference. \"I can't wait to see what that list of 10 looks like when the nominees are announced in February.\"[15]\n\n\nAt the same time, the voting system was switched from first-past-the-post to instant runoff voting (also known as preferential voting).[19] In 2011, the Academy revised the rule again so that the number of films nominated was between five and ten; nominated films must earn either 5% of first-place rankings or 5% after an abbreviated variation of the single transferable vote nominating process.[20] Bruce Davis, the Academy executive director at the time, said, \"A Best Picture nomination should be an indication of extraordinary merit. If there are only eight pictures that truly earn that honor in a given year, we shouldn't feel an obligation to round out the number.\"[21] This system lasted until 2021, when the Academy reverted back to a set number of ten nominees from the 94th Academy Awards onward.[22]\n\n\n\n### Language and country of origin[edit]\n\n\nOnly fourteen non-English language films have been nominated in the category: *La Grande Illusion* (French, 1938); *Z* (French, 1969); *The Emigrants* (Swedish, 1972); *Cries and Whispers* (Swedish, 1973); *The Postman (Il Postino)* (Italian/Spanish, 1995); *Life Is Beautiful* (Italian, 1998); *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* (Mandarin Chinese, 2000); *Letters from Iwo Jima* (Japanese, 2006, but ineligible for Best Foreign Language Film because it was an American production); *Amour* (French, 2012); *Roma* (Spanish/Mixtec, 2018); *Parasite* (Korean, 2019); *Minari* (Korean, 2020, but ineligible for Best International Feature Film because it was an American production);[23] *Drive My Car* (Japanese, 2021) and *All Quiet on the Western Front* (German, 2022). *Parasite* became the first film not in English to win Best Picture.[24][25]\n\n\nOnly ten films wholly financed outside the United States have won Best Picture, eight of which were financed, in part or in whole, by the United Kingdom: *Hamlet* (1948), *Tom Jones* (1963), *A Man for All Seasons* (1966), *Chariots of Fire* (1981), *Gandhi* (1982), *The Last Emperor* (1987), *Slumdog Millionaire* (2008), and *The King's Speech* (2010). The ninth film, *The Artist* (2011), was financed in France and the tenth film, *Parasite* (2019), was financed in South Korea.[26]\n\n\n\n### Rating[edit]\n\n\nSince 1968, most Best Picture winners have been rated R under the Motion Picture Association's rating system. *Oliver!* is the only G-rated film and *Midnight Cowboy* is the only X-rated (now NC-17) film, so far, to win Best Picture; they won in back-to-back years, 1968 and 1969. The latter has since been downgraded to an R rating. Eleven films have won with a PG rating: the first was *Patton* (1970) and the most recent was *Driving Miss Daisy* (1989). Eleven more films have won with a PG-13 rating (which was introduced in 1984): the first was *The Last Emperor* (1987) and the most recent was *CODA* (2021).\n\n\n\n### Genres[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

The latter two were nominated after the Academy expanded the number of nominees, but none have won. \n\n\nNo comic book film has won, and only three have ever been nominated: *Skippy* (1931), *Black Panther* (2018), and *Joker* (2019).[27]\n\n\nOnly two fantasy films have won: *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003) and *The Shape of Water* (2017), although more have been nominated. \n\n\n*The Silence of the Lambs* (1991) is the only horror film to win Best Picture, and only five others have been nominated for Best Picture: *The Exorcist* (1973), *Jaws* (1975), *The Sixth Sense* (1999), *Black Swan* (2010), and *Get Out* (2017). \n\n\nSeveral science-fiction films have been nominated for Best Picture, though *Everything Everywhere All at Once* (2022) was the first one to win.[28]\n\n\n*Titanic* (1997) is the only disaster film to win Best Picture, though other such films have been nominated, including *Airport* (1970) *and The Towering Inferno* (1974).\n\n\nThe Best Documentary Feature category was initiated in 1941, leaving *Chang* as the only documentary feature previously nominated, and that in the \"Unique and Artistic Production\" category at the 1927/28 awards.\n\n\nSeveral musical adaptations based on material previously filmed in non-musical form have won Best Picture, including *Gigi*, *West Side Story*, *My Fair Lady*, *The Sound of Music*, *Oliver!*, and *Chicago*.\n\n\nSeveral epics or historical epic films have won Best Picture, including the first recipient *Wings*. Others include *Cimarron*, *Cavalcade*, *Gone with the Wind*, *The Bridge on the River Kwai*, *Ben-Hur*, *Lawrence of Arabia*, *Patton*, *The Godfather*, *The Godfather Part II*, *The Last Emperor*, *Dances with Wolves*, *Schindler's List*, *Forrest Gump*, *Braveheart*, *The English Patient*, *Titanic*, *Gladiator*, and *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*.\n\n\n\n### Sequel nominations and winners[edit]\n\n\nNine films that were presented as direct sequels have been nominated for Best Picture: *The Bells of St. Mary's* (1945; the sequel to the 1944 winner, *Going My Way*), *The Godfather Part II* (1974), *The Godfather Part III* (1990), *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* (2002), *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003), *Toy Story 3* (2010), *Mad Max: Fury Road* (2015)*, Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022) and *Top Gun: Maverick* (2022).\n\n\n*Toy Story 3*, *Mad Max: Fury Road* and *Top Gun: Maverick* are the only sequels to be nominated without any predecessors being nominated. *The Godfather Part II* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* are the only sequels to have won the award, and their respective trilogies are the only series to have three films nominated. *The Godfather* series is the only film series with multiple Best Picture winners, with the first film winning the award for 1972 and the second film winning the award for 1974.[23]\n\n\nAnother nominee, *Broadway Melody of 1936*, was a follow-up of sorts to previous winner *The Broadway Melody*, but beyond the title and some music, the two films have mutually independent stories. *The Silence of the Lambs* was adapted from the sequel novel to *Red Dragon*. The latter had been adapted for film as *Manhunter* by a different studio, and the two films have different casts and creative teams and were not presented as a series.[29]\n\n\n*The Lion in Winter* features Peter O'Toole as King Henry II, a role he had played previously in the film *Becket*, but *The Lion in Winter* is not a sequel to *Becket*. Similarly, *The Queen* features Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, a role he had played previously in the television film *The Deal*. Christine Langan, producer of both productions, described *The Queen* as not being a direct sequel, only that it reunited the same creative team.[30]\n\n\nClint Eastwood's *Letters from Iwo Jima* was a companion piece to his film *Flags of Our Fathers* that was released earlier the same year. These two films depict the same battle from the different viewpoints of Japanese and United States military forces; the two films were shot back-to-back.\n\n\nIn addition, *Black Panther* is a continuation of the events that occurred in *Captain America: Civil War* and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n\n\n### Remake nominations and winners[edit]\n\n\nAlong similar lines to sequels, there have been few nominees and winners that are either remakes or adaptations of the same source materials or subjects. *Ben-Hur*, which won Best Picture of 1959, is a remake of the 1925 silent film with a similar title and both were adapted from Lew Wallace's 1880 novel *Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ*. *The Departed*, which won Best Picture of 2006, is a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film *Infernal Affairs* and is the first remake of a non-English language or international film to win. Other nominees include 1963's *Cleopatra* about the title last queen of Egypt following the 1934 version, 2018's *A Star is Born* following the 1937 film of the same name, and 2019's *Little Women* following the 1933 film of the same name with both being adaptations of the 1868 novel.[31] *True Grit*, which was nominated for Best Picture of 2010, is the second adaptation of Charles Portis's 1968 novel following the 1969 film of the same name. Four of the nominees for the 94th ceremony were based on source material previously made into films: *CODA*, *Dune*, *Nightmare Alley*, and *West Side Story*. The 2021 version of *West Side Story* became the second adaptation of the same source material for a previous Best Picture winner to be nominated for the same award after 1962's *Mutiny on the Bounty*.[32] For that same ceremony, *CODA* became the second remake of a non-English-language or international film to win. The 2022 German-language *All Quiet on the Western Front* is the second adaptation of the 1929 novel after the 1930 English-language film, and the third adaptation of the same source material of a previous Best Picture winner.[33]\n\n\n\n### Silent film winners[edit]\n\n\nAt the 1st Academy Awards, the Best Picture award (then named \"Academy Award for Outstanding Picture\") was presented to the 1927 silent film *Wings*.\n\n\n*The Artist* (2011) was the first essentially silent (with the exception of a single scene of dialogue, and a dream sequence with sound effects) film since *Wings* to win Best Picture. It was the first silent nominee since 1928's *The Patriot*. It was the first Best Picture winner to be produced entirely in black-and-white since 1960's *The Apartment*. (*Schindler's List*, the 1993 winner, was predominantly black-and-white but contains some color sequences.)[26]\n\n\n\n### Version availability[edit]\n\n\nNo Best Picture winner has been lost, though a few such as *All Quiet on the Western Front* and *Lawrence of Arabia* exist only in a form altered from their original, award-winning release form. This has usually been due to editing for reissue (and subsequently partly restored by archivists). Other winners and nominees, such as *Tom Jones* (prior to its 2018 reissues by The Criterion Collection and the British Film Institute) and *Star Wars*, are widely available only in subsequently altered versions. *The Broadway Melody* originally had some sequences photographed in two-color Technicolor. This footage survives only in black and white.[34]\n\n\nThe 1928 film *The Patriot* is the only Best Picture nominee that is lost (about one-third is extant).[35] *The Racket*, also from 1928, was believed lost for many years until a print was found in Howard Hughes' archives. It has since been restored and shown on Turner Classic Movies.[36] The only surviving complete prints of 1931's *East Lynne* and 1934's *The White Parade* exist within the UCLA film archive.[37]\n\n\n\n### Diversity standards[edit]\n\n\nThe Academy has established a set of \"representation and inclusion standards\" which a film will be required to satisfy in order to compete in the Best Picture category, starting with the 96th Academy Awards for films released in 2023.[38] There are four general standards, of which a film must satisfy two to be considered for Best Picture: (a) on-screen representation, themes and narratives; (b) creative leadership and project team; (c) industry access and opportunities; and (d) audience development.[38] As explained by Vox, the standards \"basically break down into two big buckets: standards promoting more inclusive representation and standards promoting more inclusive employment\".[39] The standards are intended to provide greater opportunities for employment, in cast, crew, studio apprenticeships and internships, and development, marketing, publicity, and distribution executives, among underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, women, LGBTQ+ people, and persons with cognitive or physical disabilities, or who are deaf or hard of hearing.[38]\n\n\nFor the 94th and 95th Academy Awards (films released in 2021 and 2022), filmmakers were required to submit a confidential Academy Inclusion Standards form to be considered for Best Picture but were not required to fulfill the standards.[39] These standards will only apply to the Best Picture category and do not affect a film's eligibility in other Oscar categories.[38]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\n### Ceremony mistake[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, at the 89th Academy Awards, presenter Faye Dunaway read *La La Land* as the winner of the award. However, she and Warren Beatty had mistakenly been given the duplicate envelope for the \"Best Actress in a Leading Role\" award, which Emma Stone had won for her role in *La La Land* moments prior. In the resulting chaos, it was *La La Land* producer Jordan Horowitz who finally announced\u2014two minutes and twenty-seven seconds later\u2014that *Moonlight* was the real winner.[40]\n\n\n\n## Winners and nominees[edit]\n\n\nIn the list below, winners are listed first in the gold row, followed by the other nominees.[6] Except for the early years (when the Academy used a non-calendar year), the year shown is the one in which the film first premiered in Los Angeles County, California; normally this is also the year of first release, however, it may be the year after first release (as with *Casablanca* and, if the film-festival premiere is considered, *Crash*). This is also the year before the ceremony at which the award is given; for example, a film exhibited theatrically during 2005 was eligible for consideration for the 2005 Best Picture Oscar, awarded in 2006. The number of the ceremony (1st, 2nd, etc.) appears in parentheses after the awards year, linked to the article on that ceremony. Each individual entry shows the title followed by nominee.\n\n\nUntil 1950, the Best Picture award was given to the production company; from 1951 on, it has gone to the producer or producers. The Academy used the producer credits of the Producers Guild of America (PGA) until 1998, when all five producers of *Shakespeare in Love* made speeches after its win.[9][10] A three-producer limit has been applied some years since.[10][11] There was controversy over the exclusion of some PGA-credited producers of *Crash* and *Little Miss Sunshine*.[11] The Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously among the four nominated for *The Reader*.[13] However, now any number of producers on a film can be nominated for Best Picture, should they be deemed eligible.\n\n\nFor the first ceremony, three films were nominated for the award. For the following three years, five films were nominated for the award. This was expanded to eight in 1933, to ten in 1934, and to twelve in 1935, before being dropped back to ten in 1937. In 1945, it was further reduced to five. This number remained until 2009, when the limit was raised to ten; it was adjusted from 2011 to 2020 to vary between five and ten, but has been a full ten since 2021.\n\n\nFor the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years. For example, the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3, 1930, recognized films that were released between August 1, 1928, and July 31, 1929. Starting with the 7th Academy Awards, held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31. This has been the rule every year since except 2020, when the end date was extended to February 28, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2021, which was correspondingly limited to March 1 to December 31.\n\n\n\nindicates the winner\n\n### 1920s[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year of Film Release\n | Film\n | Film Studio\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **1927/28**(1st)  |\n| ***Wings*** | **Famous Players\u2013Lasky (Lucien Hubbard, Jesse L.

During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as the Oscars) in 24 categories honoring films released in 2004. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Gil Cates and was directed by Louis J. Horvitz.[3][4] Actor Chris Rock hosted the show for the first time.[5] Two weeks earlier in a ceremony at The Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel & Spa in Pasadena, California, held on February 12, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Scarlett Johansson.[6]\n\n\n*Million Dollar Baby* won four awards, including Best Picture.[7] Other winners included *The Aviator* with five awards, *The Incredibles* and *Ray* with two, and *Born into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids*, *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*, *Finding Neverland*, *Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events*, *Mighty Times: The Children's March*, *The Motorcycle Diaries*, *Ryan*, *The Sea Inside*, *Sideways*, *Spider-Man 2*, and *Wasp* with one. The telecast garnered over 42 million viewers in the United States alone.\n\n\n\n\n## Winners and nominees[edit]\n\n\nThe nominees for the 77th Academy Awards were announced on January 25, 2005, at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Frank Pierson, president of the academy, and actor Adrien Brody.[8] *The Aviator* received the most nominations with eleven; *Finding Neverland* and *Million Dollar Baby* tied for second with seven nominations each.[9]\n\n\nThe winners were announced during the awards ceremony on February 27, 2005.[10] At age 74, Clint Eastwood became the oldest winner for Best Director in Oscar history.[11] With his latest unsuccessful nomination for directing *The Aviator*, nominee Martin Scorsese joined Robert Altman, Clarence Brown, Alfred Hitchcock, and King Vidor as the most nominated individuals in the Best Director category without a single win at the time.[12] Best Actor winner Jamie Foxx became the third actor and tenth individual overall to earn two acting nominations in the same year.[13] By virtue of her portrayal of Katharine Hepburn, Best Supporting Actress winner Cate Blanchett was the first performer to win an Oscar for a portrayal of a previous Oscar winner.[14] \"Al otro lado del r\u00edo\" from *The Motorcycle Diaries* became the second song with non-English lyrics to win Best Original Song.

He always makes me laugh and he always has something interesting to say. Chris represents the best of the new generation of comics. Having him host the Oscars is terrific. I can't wait.\"[24] By virtue of his selection, Rock became the first African American man to solo host the gala.[25]\n\n\nNearly a month before the ceremony Rock told Josh Wolk of *Entertainment Weekly*, \"Come on, it's a fashion show. No one performs; it's not like a music show. What straight black man sits there and watches the Oscars? Show me one.\"[26] Political blogger Matt Drudge later reported that several anonymous AMPAS members wanted Rock fired from his hosting job as a result of the comments.[27] Nevertheless, producer Cates issued a statement defending the host saying, \"Chris' comments are meant to be humorous digs at a show that some people, obviously including Chris himself, think may be a bit too stuffy.\"[28] Furthermore, Wolk dismissed any controversy regarding Rock's comments and that Drudge exaggerated the host's comments.[29] GLAAD Executive Director Joan Garry also issue a statement in light of the controversy stating, \"Chris Rock isn't making fun of gays \u2013 he's poking fun at the Oscars.\"[30] Rock appeared on *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno* the Monday before the ceremony to clarify his comments. When Leno asked about the statement, Rock replied \"I did not say that. I said only gay people watch the Tonys.\" However, he reiterated, \"I really don't know any straight men who aren't in show business that have ever watched the Oscars.\"[31]\n\n\nNotable changes were made to give the ceremony a sleek, interactive look while shortening the length of the ceremony. Cates announced that in certain categories, all five nominees would be up onstage prior to the announcement of the award.[32] In other instances, the actor or actress would present the award in the audience.[33] In addition, production designer Roy Christopher designed an technologically ambitious stage for the telecast that both saluted the past while look toward the future. The set prominently featured 26 high-definition video monitors floating over the first twelve rows of the audience and a 40-foot LED screen situated beneath a layer of plexiglass on the stage floor.[34] Both screens were used display images of previous Oscar appearances as presenters took the stage or random film clips during several commercial breaks.[35] A gold rod featuring 23 different life-sized Oscar statuettes spiraling upward was placed at center stage.[36]\n\n\nSeveral other people were involved with the production of the ceremony. Film composer and musician Bill Conti served as musical director of the ceremony.[37] AMPAS graphics designer Brett Davidson designed the official ceremony poster consisting of a profile of the Oscar statuette in front of four neon-colored squares.[38] Freelance producer Cochise and media firm Dig and Media Island released a trailer shown in movie theaters nationwide promoting the ceremony featuring clips from past Oscar ceremonies against the four squares backdrop in the aforementioned poster. The trailer featured the song \"Hey Mama\" by The Black Eyed Peas.[39] Two-time Oscar-winning actor Dustin Hoffman narrated the opening montage highlighting the evolution of the movies.[21]\n\n\n\n### Box office performance of nominated films[edit]\n\n\nWhen the nominations were announced on January 25, the field of Best Picture nominees did not include a bona fide blockbuster at the U.S. box office. It was the first time since 1986 that none of the five films in that category were among the top ten releases in box office prior to the nominations announcement.[40] Furthermore, before the ceremony, all five films sold the lowest cumulative number of tickets sold since 1984.[41] *Ray* was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $73\u00a0million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by *The Aviator* ($58.4\u00a0million), *Finding Neverland* ($32.7\u00a0million), *Sideways* ($32.4\u00a0million), and finally *Million Dollar Baby* ($8.4\u00a0million).[42] The combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees when the Oscars were announced was $205\u00a0million with an average gross of $41.3\u00a0million per film.[42]\n\n\nAmong the rest of the top 50 releases of 2004 in U.S. box office before the nominations, 44 nominations went to 14 films on the list. Only *Shrek 2* (1st), *The Incredibles* (4th), *Shark Tale* (11th), *Collateral* (22nd), *Ray* (37th), and *The Aviator* (49th) were nominated for Best Picture, Best Animated Feature, directing, acting, or screenwriting.[43] The other top 50 box office hits that earned the nominations were *Spider-Man 2* (2nd), *The Passion of the Christ* (3rd), *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* (5th), *The Polar Express* (10th), *I, Robot* (12th), *Troy* (13th), *Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events* (18th), and *The Village* (20th).[43]\n\n\n\n### Jude Law joke[edit]\n\n\nDuring his monologue, host Rock joked, \"Clint Eastwood's a star, OK? Tobey Maguire's just a boy in tights,\" He also added, \"You want Tom Cruise and all you can get is Jude Law? Wait. You want Russell Crowe and all you can get is Colin Farrell? Wait. *Alexander* is not *Gladiator*.\" In response, Sean Penn rebutted Rock's remarks praising Law as one of his generation's \"finest actors\".[44] Over a year later, Law expressed his anger toward Rock in *The New York Times* telling columnist Craig Modderno, \"At first I laughed because I didn't think he knew who I was. Then I got angry as his remarks became personal. My friends were livid. It's unfortunate I had five or six films come out at the same time.\"[45]\n\n\n\n### Scrapped Robin Williams song[edit]\n\n\nRobin Williams initially wanted to sing a humorous song written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman during the presentation of the Best Animated Feature award satirizing the controversy regarding Focus on the Family and a music video sponsored by We Are Family Foundation featuring animated characters such as SpongeBob SquarePants singing the song \"We Are Family\". The song contained lyrics such as \"Pinocchio's had his nose done! Sleeping Beauty is popping pills!/ The Three Little Pigs ain't kosher! Betty Boop works Beverly Hills!\"[46] However, Cates and ABC officials deemed the song overly vulgar and offensive for the telecast and was dropped altogether after writers Shaiman and Wittman had trouble rewriting more appropriate lyrics.[47] Williams eventually presented the Best Animated Feature award as scheduled, but silently mocked the debacle by entering the stage with duct tape over his mouth before speaking.[48]\n\n\n\n### Critical reviews[edit]\n\n\nThe show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show and Rock's performance as host. *USA Today* television critic Robert Bianco wrote, \"Loud, snide and dismissive, he wasn't just a disappointment; he ranks up there with the worst hosts ever.\" He also called the decision to have several nominees of several technical categories stand on stage embarrassing and disrespectful.[49] Columnist Robert. P. Lawrence of the *San Diego Union Tribune* commented, \"It was a frustratingly average, three-hour-12-minute exhibition of mutual admiration in the inimitable Hollywood style.\" He later said that despite Rock's edgy and provocative opening, his humor and energy diminished as the night wore on.[50] Vince Horiuchi of *The Salt Lake Tribune* wrote of Rock's performance, \"He was bound by stale jokes (none of the winners \"tested positive for steroids\"), a rigid opening monologue (he didn't even make reference to his prior controversial comments about the Oscars), and tired comedy bits (Rock playing like Catherine Zeta-Jones with Adam Sandler).\" He also described the cast and production of the ceremony as \"moribund\" and \"clumsy\".[51]\n\n\nOther media outlets received the broadcast more positively. Film critic Roger Ebert noted that Rock \"opened on a high-energy quick-talking note\" He also added, \"Chris Rock hit a home run with his opening monologue, which was surprisingly pointed, topical, and not shy of controversy.\"[52] Television critic Frazier Moore commented that Rock's performance was a \"needed pick-me-up, presiding over the broadcast with saucy finesse.\" He added, \"In sum, the broadcast felt brisk, though not rushed. It felt modern and refreshingly free of chronic self-importance.\"[53] Brian Lowry of *Variety* gave an average review of Rock but remarked, \"For all the hand-wringing about the awards descending into the muck, the 77th Academy Awards proved a classy affair, with precious little red meat to satiate Hollywood bashers.\"[2]\n\n\n\n### Ratings and reception[edit]\n\n\nThe American telecast on ABC drew an average of 42.14 million people over its length, which was a 3% decrease from the previous year's ceremony.[54] The show also drew lower Nielsen ratings compared to the two previous ceremonies with 25.4 of households watching over a 38 share.[54][55] It also drew a lower 18\u201349 demo rating with a 15.1 rating over a 34 share among viewers in that demographic.[54]\n\n\n\n## In Memoriam[edit]\n\n\nThe annual *In Memoriam* tribute was presented by actress Annette Bening.

This award goes to the producers of the film and is the only category in which every member of the Academy is eligible to submit a nomination and vote on the final ballot.[1] The Best Picture category is traditionally the final award of the night and is widely considered as the most prestigious honor of the ceremony.[2][3][4]\n\n\nThe Grand Staircase columns at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the Academy Awards ceremonies have been held since 2002, showcase every film that has won the Best Picture title since the award's inception.[5] There have been 591 films nominated for Best Picture and 95 winners.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Category name changes[edit]\n\n\nAt the 1st Academy Awards ceremony held in 1929 (for films made in 1927 and 1928), there were two categories of awards that were each considered the top award of the night: \"Outstanding Picture\" and \"Unique and Artistic Picture,\" the former being won by the war epic *Wings*, and the latter by the art film *Sunrise*. Each award was intended to honor different and equally important aspects of superior filmmaking. In particular, *The Jazz Singer* was disqualified from both awards, since its use of synchronized sound made the film a *sui generis* item that would have unfairly competed against either category, and the Academy granted the film an honorary award instead.[7]\n\n\nThe following year, the Academy dropped the *Unique and Artistic Picture* award, deciding retroactively that the award won by *Wings* was the highest honor that could be awarded, and allowed synchronized sound films to compete for the award.[8] Although the award kept the title *Outstanding Picture* for the next ceremony, the name underwent several changes over the years as seen below. Since 1962, the award has been simply called *Best Picture*.[6]\n\n\n\n* 1927/28\u20131928/29: **Academy Award for Outstanding Picture**\n* 1929/30\u20131940: **Academy Award for Outstanding Production**\n* 1941\u20131943: **Academy Award for Outstanding Motion Picture**\n* 1944\u20131961: **Academy Award for Best Motion Picture**\n* 1962\u2013present: **Academy Award for Best Picture**\n\n\n### Recipients[edit]\n\n\nUntil 1950, this award was presented to a representative of the production company. That year the protocol was changed so that the award was presented to all credited producers. This rule was modified in 1999 to apply a maximum limit of three producers receiving the award, after the five producers of *Shakespeare in Love* had received the award.[9][10][11]\n\n\nAs of 2020[update], the \"Special Rules for the Best Picture of the Year Award\" limit recipients to those who meet two main requirements:[12]\n\n\n\n* Those with screen credit of \"producer\" or \"produced by\", explicitly excluding those with the screen credit \"executive producer, co-producer, associate producer, line producer, or produced in association with\"\n* those three or fewer producers who have performed the major portion of the producing functions\n\n\nThe rules allow a *bona fide* team of not more than two people to be considered a single \"producer\" if the two individuals have had an established producing partnership as determined by the Producers Guild of America Producing Partnership Panel. Final determination of the qualifying producer nominees for each nominated picture will be made by the Producers Branch Executive Committee, including the right to name any additional qualified producer as a nominee.[12]\n\n\nThe Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously included among the four producers nominated for *The Reader*.[13] As of 2014[update] the Producers Branch Executive Committee determines such exceptions, noting they take place only in \"rare and extraordinary circumstance[s].\"[12]\n\n\nSteven Spielberg currently holds the record for most nominations at twelve, winning one, while Kathleen Kennedy holds the record for most nominations without a win at eight. Sam Spiegel and Saul Zaentz tie for the most wins with three each. As for the time when the Oscar was given to production companies instead, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer holds the record with five wins and 40 nominations.\n\n\n\n### Best Picture and Best Director[edit]\n\n\nThe Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director have been closely linked throughout their history. Of the 95 films that have won Best Picture, 68 have also been awarded Best Director. Only six films have been awarded Best Picture without receiving a Best Director nomination: *Wings* directed by William A. Wellman (1927/28), *Grand Hotel* directed by Edmund Goulding (1931/32), *Driving Miss Daisy* directed by Bruce Beresford (1989), *Argo* directed by Ben Affleck (2012), *Green Book* directed by Peter Farrelly (2018), and *CODA* directed by Sian Heder (2021). The only two Best Director winners to win for films that did not receive a Best Picture nomination were during the early years of the awards: Lewis Milestone for *Two Arabian Knights* (1927/28), and Frank Lloyd for *The Divine Lady* (1928/29).[14]\n\n\n\n### Nomination limit increased[edit]\n\n\nOn June 24, 2009, AMPAS announced that the number of films to be nominated in the Best Picture award category would increase from five to ten, starting with the 82nd Academy Awards (2009).[15] Although the Academy never officially said so, many commenters noted the expansion was likely in part a response to public criticism of *The Dark Knight* and *WALL-E* (both 2008) (and, in previous years, other blockbusters and popular films) not being nominated for Best Picture.[16][17][18] Officially, the Academy said the rule change was a throwback to the Academy's early years in the 1930s and 1940s, when eight to 12 films were nominated each year. \"Having 10 Best Picture nominees is going to allow Academy voters to recognize and include some of the fantastic movies that often show up in the other Oscar categories but have been squeezed out of the race for the top prize,\" AMPAS President Sid Ganis said in a press conference. \"I can't wait to see what that list of 10 looks like when the nominees are announced in February.\"[15]\n\n\nAt the same time, the voting system was switched from first-past-the-post to instant runoff voting (also known as preferential voting).[19] In 2011, the Academy revised the rule again so that the number of films nominated was between five and ten; nominated films must earn either 5% of first-place rankings or 5% after an abbreviated variation of the single transferable vote nominating process.[20] Bruce Davis, the Academy executive director at the time, said, \"A Best Picture nomination should be an indication of extraordinary merit. If there are only eight pictures that truly earn that honor in a given year, we shouldn't feel an obligation to round out the number.\"[21] This system lasted until 2021, when the Academy reverted back to a set number of ten nominees from the 94th Academy Awards onward.[22]\n\n\n\n### Language and country of origin[edit]\n\n\nOnly fourteen non-English language films have been nominated in the category: *La Grande Illusion* (French, 1938); *Z* (French, 1969); *The Emigrants* (Swedish, 1972); *Cries and Whispers* (Swedish, 1973); *The Postman (Il Postino)* (Italian/Spanish, 1995); *Life Is Beautiful* (Italian, 1998); *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* (Mandarin Chinese, 2000); *Letters from Iwo Jima* (Japanese, 2006, but ineligible for Best Foreign Language Film because it was an American production); *Amour* (French, 2012); *Roma* (Spanish/Mixtec, 2018); *Parasite* (Korean, 2019); *Minari* (Korean, 2020, but ineligible for Best International Feature Film because it was an American production);[23] *Drive My Car* (Japanese, 2021) and *All Quiet on the Western Front* (German, 2022). *Parasite* became the first film not in English to win Best Picture.[24][25]\n\n\nOnly ten films wholly financed outside the United States have won Best Picture, eight of which were financed, in part or in whole, by the United Kingdom: *Hamlet* (1948), *Tom Jones* (1963), *A Man for All Seasons* (1966), *Chariots of Fire* (1981), *Gandhi* (1982), *The Last Emperor* (1987), *Slumdog Millionaire* (2008), and *The King's Speech* (2010). The ninth film, *The Artist* (2011), was financed in France and the tenth film, *Parasite* (2019), was financed in South Korea.[26]\n\n\n\n### Rating[edit]\n\n\nSince 1968, most Best Picture winners have been rated R under the Motion Picture Association's rating system. *Oliver!* is the only G-rated film and *Midnight Cowboy* is the only X-rated (now NC-17) film, so far, to win Best Picture; they won in back-to-back years, 1968 and 1969. The latter has since been downgraded to an R rating. Eleven films have won with a PG rating: the first was *Patton* (1970) and the most recent was *Driving Miss Daisy* (1989). Eleven more films have won with a PG-13 rating (which was introduced in 1984): the first was *The Last Emperor* (1987) and the most recent was *CODA* (2021).\n\n\n\n### Genres[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

The latter two were nominated after the Academy expanded the number of nominees, but none have won. \n\n\nNo comic book film has won, and only three have ever been nominated: *Skippy* (1931), *Black Panther* (2018), and *Joker* (2019).[27]\n\n\nOnly two fantasy films have won: *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003) and *The Shape of Water* (2017), although more have been nominated. \n\n\n*The Silence of the Lambs* (1991) is the only horror film to win Best Picture, and only five others have been nominated for Best Picture: *The Exorcist* (1973), *Jaws* (1975), *The Sixth Sense* (1999), *Black Swan* (2010), and *Get Out* (2017). \n\n\nSeveral science-fiction films have been nominated for Best Picture, though *Everything Everywhere All at Once* (2022) was the first one to win.[28]\n\n\n*Titanic* (1997) is the only disaster film to win Best Picture, though other such films have been nominated, including *Airport* (1970) *and The Towering Inferno* (1974).\n\n\nThe Best Documentary Feature category was initiated in 1941, leaving *Chang* as the only documentary feature previously nominated, and that in the \"Unique and Artistic Production\" category at the 1927/28 awards.\n\n\nSeveral musical adaptations based on material previously filmed in non-musical form have won Best Picture, including *Gigi*, *West Side Story*, *My Fair Lady*, *The Sound of Music*, *Oliver!*, and *Chicago*.\n\n\nSeveral epics or historical epic films have won Best Picture, including the first recipient *Wings*. Others include *Cimarron*, *Cavalcade*, *Gone with the Wind*, *The Bridge on the River Kwai*, *Ben-Hur*, *Lawrence of Arabia*, *Patton*, *The Godfather*, *The Godfather Part II*, *The Last Emperor*, *Dances with Wolves*, *Schindler's List*, *Forrest Gump*, *Braveheart*, *The English Patient*, *Titanic*, *Gladiator*, and *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*.\n\n\n\n### Sequel nominations and winners[edit]\n\n\nNine films that were presented as direct sequels have been nominated for Best Picture: *The Bells of St. Mary's* (1945; the sequel to the 1944 winner, *Going My Way*), *The Godfather Part II* (1974), *The Godfather Part III* (1990), *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* (2002), *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003), *Toy Story 3* (2010), *Mad Max: Fury Road* (2015)*, Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022) and *Top Gun: Maverick* (2022).\n\n\n*Toy Story 3*, *Mad Max: Fury Road* and *Top Gun: Maverick* are the only sequels to be nominated without any predecessors being nominated. *The Godfather Part II* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* are the only sequels to have won the award, and their respective trilogies are the only series to have three films nominated. *The Godfather* series is the only film series with multiple Best Picture winners, with the first film winning the award for 1972 and the second film winning the award for 1974.[23]\n\n\nAnother nominee, *Broadway Melody of 1936*, was a follow-up of sorts to previous winner *The Broadway Melody*, but beyond the title and some music, the two films have mutually independent stories. *The Silence of the Lambs* was adapted from the sequel novel to *Red Dragon*. The latter had been adapted for film as *Manhunter* by a different studio, and the two films have different casts and creative teams and were not presented as a series.[29]\n\n\n*The Lion in Winter* features Peter O'Toole as King Henry II, a role he had played previously in the film *Becket*, but *The Lion in Winter* is not a sequel to *Becket*. Similarly, *The Queen* features Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, a role he had played previously in the television film *The Deal*. Christine Langan, producer of both productions, described *The Queen* as not being a direct sequel, only that it reunited the same creative team.[30]\n\n\nClint Eastwood's *Letters from Iwo Jima* was a companion piece to his film *Flags of Our Fathers* that was released earlier the same year. These two films depict the same battle from the different viewpoints of Japanese and United States military forces; the two films were shot back-to-back.\n\n\nIn addition, *Black Panther* is a continuation of the events that occurred in *Captain America: Civil War* and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n\n\n### Remake nominations and winners[edit]\n\n\nAlong similar lines to sequels, there have been few nominees and winners that are either remakes or adaptations of the same source materials or subjects. *Ben-Hur*, which won Best Picture of 1959, is a remake of the 1925 silent film with a similar title and both were adapted from Lew Wallace's 1880 novel *Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ*. *The Departed*, which won Best Picture of 2006, is a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film *Infernal Affairs* and is the first remake of a non-English language or international film to win. Other nominees include 1963's *Cleopatra* about the title last queen of Egypt following the 1934 version, 2018's *A Star is Born* following the 1937 film of the same name, and 2019's *Little Women* following the 1933 film of the same name with both being adaptations of the 1868 novel.[31] *True Grit*, which was nominated for Best Picture of 2010, is the second adaptation of Charles Portis's 1968 novel following the 1969 film of the same name. Four of the nominees for the 94th ceremony were based on source material previously made into films: *CODA*, *Dune*, *Nightmare Alley*, and *West Side Story*. The 2021 version of *West Side Story* became the second adaptation of the same source material for a previous Best Picture winner to be nominated for the same award after 1962's *Mutiny on the Bounty*.[32] For that same ceremony, *CODA* became the second remake of a non-English-language or international film to win. The 2022 German-language *All Quiet on the Western Front* is the second adaptation of the 1929 novel after the 1930 English-language film, and the third adaptation of the same source material of a previous Best Picture winner.[33]\n\n\n\n### Silent film winners[edit]\n\n\nAt the 1st Academy Awards, the Best Picture award (then named \"Academy Award for Outstanding Picture\") was presented to the 1927 silent film *Wings*.\n\n\n*The Artist* (2011) was the first essentially silent (with the exception of a single scene of dialogue, and a dream sequence with sound effects) film since *Wings* to win Best Picture. It was the first silent nominee since 1928's *The Patriot*. It was the first Best Picture winner to be produced entirely in black-and-white since 1960's *The Apartment*. (*Schindler's List*, the 1993 winner, was predominantly black-and-white but contains some color sequences.)[26]\n\n\n\n### Version availability[edit]\n\n\nNo Best Picture winner has been lost, though a few such as *All Quiet on the Western Front* and *Lawrence of Arabia* exist only in a form altered from their original, award-winning release form. This has usually been due to editing for reissue (and subsequently partly restored by archivists). Other winners and nominees, such as *Tom Jones* (prior to its 2018 reissues by The Criterion Collection and the British Film Institute) and *Star Wars*, are widely available only in subsequently altered versions. *The Broadway Melody* originally had some sequences photographed in two-color Technicolor. This footage survives only in black and white.[34]\n\n\nThe 1928 film *The Patriot* is the only Best Picture nominee that is lost (about one-third is extant).[35] *The Racket*, also from 1928, was believed lost for many years until a print was found in Howard Hughes' archives. It has since been restored and shown on Turner Classic Movies.[36] The only surviving complete prints of 1931's *East Lynne* and 1934's *The White Parade* exist within the UCLA film archive.[37]\n\n\n\n### Diversity standards[edit]\n\n\nThe Academy has established a set of \"representation and inclusion standards\" which a film will be required to satisfy in order to compete in the Best Picture category, starting with the 96th Academy Awards for films released in 2023.[38] There are four general standards, of which a film must satisfy two to be considered for Best Picture: (a) on-screen representation, themes and narratives; (b) creative leadership and project team; (c) industry access and opportunities; and (d) audience development.[38] As explained by Vox, the standards \"basically break down into two big buckets: standards promoting more inclusive representation and standards promoting more inclusive employment\".[39] The standards are intended to provide greater opportunities for employment, in cast, crew, studio apprenticeships and internships, and development, marketing, publicity, and distribution executives, among underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, women, LGBTQ+ people, and persons with cognitive or physical disabilities, or who are deaf or hard of hearing.[38]\n\n\nFor the 94th and 95th Academy Awards (films released in 2021 and 2022), filmmakers were required to submit a confidential Academy Inclusion Standards form to be considered for Best Picture but were not required to fulfill the standards.[39] These standards will only apply to the Best Picture category and do not affect a film's eligibility in other Oscar categories.[38]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\n### Ceremony mistake[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, at the 89th Academy Awards, presenter Faye Dunaway read *La La Land* as the winner of the award. However, she and Warren Beatty had mistakenly been given the duplicate envelope for the \"Best Actress in a Leading Role\" award, which Emma Stone had won for her role in *La La Land* moments prior. In the resulting chaos, it was *La La Land* producer Jordan Horowitz who finally announced\u2014two minutes and twenty-seven seconds later\u2014that *Moonlight* was the real winner.[40]\n\n\n\n## Winners and nominees[edit]\n\n\nIn the list below, winners are listed first in the gold row, followed by the other nominees.[6] Except for the early years (when the Academy used a non-calendar year), the year shown is the one in which the film first premiered in Los Angeles County, California; normally this is also the year of first release, however, it may be the year after first release (as with *Casablanca* and, if the film-festival premiere is considered, *Crash*). This is also the year before the ceremony at which the award is given; for example, a film exhibited theatrically during 2005 was eligible for consideration for the 2005 Best Picture Oscar, awarded in 2006. The number of the ceremony (1st, 2nd, etc.) appears in parentheses after the awards year, linked to the article on that ceremony. Each individual entry shows the title followed by nominee.\n\n\nUntil 1950, the Best Picture award was given to the production company; from 1951 on, it has gone to the producer or producers. The Academy used the producer credits of the Producers Guild of America (PGA) until 1998, when all five producers of *Shakespeare in Love* made speeches after its win.[9][10] A three-producer limit has been applied some years since.[10][11] There was controversy over the exclusion of some PGA-credited producers of *Crash* and *Little Miss Sunshine*.[11] The Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously among the four nominated for *The Reader*.[13] However, now any number of producers on a film can be nominated for Best Picture, should they be deemed eligible.\n\n\nFor the first ceremony, three films were nominated for the award. For the following three years, five films were nominated for the award. This was expanded to eight in 1933, to ten in 1934, and to twelve in 1935, before being dropped back to ten in 1937. In 1945, it was further reduced to five. This number remained until 2009, when the limit was raised to ten; it was adjusted from 2011 to 2020 to vary between five and ten, but has been a full ten since 2021.\n\n\nFor the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years. For example, the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3, 1930, recognized films that were released between August 1, 1928, and July 31, 1929. Starting with the 7th Academy Awards, held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31. This has been the rule every year since except 2020, when the end date was extended to February 28, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2021, which was correspondingly limited to March 1 to December 31.\n\n\n\nindicates the winner\n\n### 1920s[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year of Film Release\n | Film\n | Film Studio\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **1927/28**(1st)  |\n| ***Wings*** | **Famous Players\u2013Lasky (Lucien Hubbard, Jesse L.

Colin Firth plays the future King George VI who, to cope with a stammer, sees Lionel Logue, an Australian speech and language therapist played by Geoffrey Rush. The men become friends as they work together, and after his brother abdicates the throne, the new king relies on Logue to help him make his first wartime radio broadcast upon Britain's declaration of war on Germany in 1939.\n\n\nSeidler read about George VI's life after learning to manage a stuttering condition he developed during his own youth. He started writing about the relationship between the therapist and his royal patient as early as the 1980s, but at the request of the King's widow, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, postponed work until her death in 2002. He later rewrote his screenplay for the stage to focus on the essential relationship between the two protagonists. Nine weeks before filming began, the filmmakers learned of the existence of notes written by Logue that were being used by his grandson Mark and Peter Conradi as the basis of a book, and were granted permission to incorporate material from the notes and book into the script.\n\n\nPrincipal photography took place in London and around Britain from November 2009 to January 2010. Hard light was used to give the story a greater resonance and wider-than-normal lenses were employed to recreate the Duke of York's feelings of constriction. A third technique Hooper employed was the off-centre framing of characters.\n\n\n*The King's Speech* was a major box office and critical success. It was widely praised by film critics for its visual style, art direction, screenplay, directing, score, and acting. Other commentators discussed the film's representation of historical detail, especially the reversal of Winston Churchill's opposition to abdication. The film received many awards and nominations, particularly for Colin Firth's performance, which resulted in his first Academy Award for Best Actor. At the 83rd Academy Awards, *The King's Speech* received 12 Oscar nominations, more than any other film in that year, and subsequently won four, including Best Picture. Censors initially gave it adult ratings due to profanity, though these were later revised downwards after criticism by the makers and distributors in the UK and some instances of swearing were muted in the US. On a budget of \u00a38\u00a0million, it earned over \u00a3250\u00a0million internationally.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nAt the official closing of the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium, Prince Albert, Duke of York, the second son of King George V, addresses the crowd with a strong stammer. His search for treatment has been discouraging, but his wife, Elizabeth, persuades him to see the Australian-born Lionel Logue, a non-medically trained Harley Street speech defects therapist. \"Bertie\", as he is called by his family, believes the first session is not going well, but Lionel, who insists that all his patients address him as such, has his potential client recite Hamlet's \"To be, or not to be\" soliloquy while hearing classical music played on a pair of headphones. Bertie is frustrated at the experiment but Lionel gives him the acetate recording that he has made of the reading as a souvenir.\nAfter Bertie's father, King George V, broadcasts his 1934 Royal Christmas Message, he explains to Bertie that the wireless will play a significant part in the role of the royal family, allowing them to enter the homes of the people, and that Bertie's brother's neglect of his responsibilities make training in it necessary. The attempt at reading the message himself is a failure, but that night Bertie plays the recording Lionel gave him and is astonished at the lack of stutter there. He therefore returns for daily treatments to overcome the physical and psychological roots of his speaking difficulty.\n\n\nGeorge V dies in 1936, and his eldest son David ascends the throne as King Edward VIII. A constitutional crisis arises with the new king over a prospective marriage with the twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. Edward, as the supreme governor of the Church of England, cannot marry her, even if she receives her second divorce, since both her previous husbands are alive.\n\n\nAt an unscheduled session, Bertie expresses his frustration that, while his speech has improved when speaking to most people, he still stammers when talking to David, at the same time revealing the extent of Edward VIII's folly with Simpson. When Lionel insists that Bertie himself could make a good king, Bertie accuses Lionel of speaking treason and quits Lionel in anger. Bertie must now face the Accession Council without any assistance.\n\n\nBertie and Lionel only come together again after King Edward decides to abdicate in order to marry. Bertie, urged ahead by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, ascends the throne as King George VI and visits Lionel's home with his wife before their coronation, much to the surprise of Mrs. Logue when she comes upon Queen Elizabeth having tea at her dining room table. This is the first time that she learns who her husband's patient has been.\n\n\nBertie and Lionel's relationship is questioned by the King's advisors during the preparations for his coronation in Westminster Abbey. The archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Gordon Lang, brings to light that George never asked for advice from his advisors about his treatment and that Lionel has never had formal training. Lionel explains to an outraged Bertie that at the time he started with speech defects there were no formal qualifications and that the only known help that was available for returning Great War shell-shocked Australian soldiers was from personal experience. Bertie remains unconvinced until provoked to protest at Lionel's disrespect for King Edward's Chair and the Stone of Scone. Only at this pivotal moment, after realising he has just expressed himself without impairment, is Bertie able to rehearse with Lionel and complete the ceremony.\n\n\nAs the new king, Bertie is in a crisis when he must broadcast to Britain and the Empire following the declaration of war on Nazi Germany in 1939. Lionel is summoned to Buckingham Palace to prepare the king for his speech. Knowing the challenge that lies before him, Lang, Winston Churchill, and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain are present to offer support. The King and Logue are then left in the broadcasting room. He delivers his speech with Logue conducting him, but by the end he is speaking freely. Preparing to leave the room for the congratulations of those present, Logue mentions to the King that he still has difficulty enunciating *w* and the King jokes back, \"I had to throw in a few so they'd know it was me.\"\n\n\nAs the Royal Family step onto the palace balcony and are applauded by the crowd, a title card explains that Logue, who received the Royal Victorian Order for service to the Crown, was always present at King George VI's speeches during the war and that they remained friends until the King's death from lung cancer in 1952.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter as the Duke and Duchess of York\n* Colin Firth as King George VI\n* Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue\n* Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth\n* Guy Pearce as King Edward VIII\n* Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill\n* Derek Jacobi as Cosmo Gordon Lang\n* Jennifer Ehle as Myrtle Logue\n* Michael Gambon as King George V\n* Freya Wilson as Princess Elizabeth\n* Ramona Marquez as Princess Margaret\n* Patrick Ryecart as Lord Wigram\n* Simon Chandler as Lord Dawson of Penn\n* Claire Bloom as Queen Mary\n* Orlando Wells as Prince George, Duke of Kent\n* Tim Downie as Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester\n* Eve Best as Wallis Simpson\n* Anthony Andrews as Stanley Baldwin\n* Andrew Havill as Robert Wood\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nAs a child, David Seidler developed a stammer, which he believes was caused by the emotional trauma of World War II and the murder of his grandparents during the Holocaust. King George VI's success in overcoming his stammer inspired the young Seidler, \"Here was a stutterer who was a king and had to give radio speeches where everyone was listening to every syllable he uttered, and yet did so with passion and intensity.\" When Seidler became an adult, he resolved to write about King George VI. During the late 1970s and 1980s he voraciously researched the King, but found a dearth of information on Logue. Eventually Seidler contacted Valentine Logue, who agreed to discuss his father and make his notebooks available if the Queen Mother gave her permission. She asked him not to do so in her lifetime, and Seidler halted the project.[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)The film's producers broke etiquette by hand-delivering Geoffrey Rush the script. Rush eventually produced the film as well as performed in it.[10]\nThe Queen Mother died in 2002. Three years later, Seidler returned to the story during a bout of creative work inspired by a recovery from cancer. His research, including a chance encounter with an uncle whom Logue had treated, indicated he used mechanical breathing exercises combined with psychological counselling to probe the underlying causes of the condition. Thus prepared, Seidler imagined the sessions. He showed the finished screenplay to his wife, who liked it, but pronounced it too \"seduced by cinematic technique\". She suggested he rewrite it as a stage play to focus on the essential relationship between the King and Logue. After he had completed it, he sent it to a few friends who worked in theatre in London and New York for feedback.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2005, Joan Lane of Wilde Thyme, a production company in London, received the script. Lane started talking with Simon Egan and Gareth Unwin of Bedlam Productions, and they invited Seidler to London to rewrite the play again, this time for the screen. Together, Lane and Bedlam Productions organised a reading of the play in Pleasance Theatre, a small house in north London, to a group of Australian expatriates, among whom was Tom Hooper's mother. She called her son and said, \"I've found your next project\".[11][12]\n\n\nInstead of trying to contact his agent, Lane asked an Australian staff member to hand-deliver the script to Geoffrey Rush's house, not far away from hers in Melbourne. Unwin reports that he received a four-page e-mail from Rush's manager admonishing them for the breach of etiquette, but ending with an invitation to discuss the project further. Iain Canning from See-Saw Films became involved and, in Gareth Unwin's words: \"We worked with ex-chair of BAFTA Richard Price, and started turning this story about two grumpy men sitting in a room into something bigger.\"[12] Hooper liked the story, but thought that the original ending needed to be changed to reflect events more closely: \"Originally, it had a Hollywood ending\u00a0... If you hear the real speech, he's clearly coping with his stammer. But it's not a perfect performance. He's managing it.\"[11]\n\n\n\n![](image)Colin Firth's performance earned him a BAFTA and an Academy Award, among other accolades\nThe production team learned\u00a0\u2013 some nine weeks prior to the start of filming\u00a0\u2013 of a diary containing Logue's original notes on his treatment of the Duke, which was in the process of being turned into a non-fiction book by Logue's grandson Mark and journalist Peter Conradi, titled *The King's Speech: How One Man Saved the British Monarchy*.[13] Striking an agreement with the authors, they then went back and re-worked the script to reflect what was in the notes and the book. Some lines, such as at the climax, when Logue smiles and says, \"You still stammered on the W\" to the King, who replies, \"I had to throw in a few so they would know it was me\" were direct quotations from Logue's notes.[14] Changes from the script to reflect the historical record included Michael Gambon improvising the ramblings of George V as he signed away authority, and the decision in the opening scene to dress the Duke in an overcoat rather than regal finery.[15]\n\n\nSeidler thought Paul Bettany would be a good choice to play King George\u00a0VI, while Hooper preferred Hugh Grant, though both actors declined the offer. Once they met with Firth and heard him read for the part, Seidler and Hooper were convinced of his suitability for the role.[16]\n\n\nThe UK Film Council awarded the production \u00a31\u00a0million in June 2009.[17] Filming began in December 2009, and lasted 39 days. Most was shot in the three weeks before Christmas because Rush would be performing in a play in January. The schedule was further complicated by Bonham Carter's availability: she worked on *Harry Potter* during the week, so her scenes had to be filmed during the weekend.[12]\n\n\n\n### Location and design[edit]\n\n\nThe film depicted both regal opulence and scruffy, depression-era London.[18] On 25 November 2009 the crew took over the Pullens buildings in Southwark and gave it the appearance of a street from 1930s London. Large advertisements for (among other things) Bovril and fascism were added to walls, and grit and grime to streets and buildings. To reproduce London smog of the time\u00a0\u2013 thick enough that cars might need guidance from someone walking ahead\u00a0\u2013 so much artificial smoke was used that fire alarms were triggered.[15]\n\n\nOn 26 November, a week's filming with Firth, Rush, and Jacobi began at Ely Cathedral, the location used for Westminster Abbey. The production had asked for permission to film in the Abbey but were denied due to the demands of tourism.[15] Though Lincoln Cathedral is architecturally a closer match to the Abbey, they preferred Ely, a favoured filming location. Its size allowed them to build sets showing not just the coronation, but the preparations before it.[19][20][21]\n\n\nLancaster House, an opulent government-owned period house in London, was rented (at \u00a320,000 per day) for interior scenes of Buckingham Palace.[18] The 1936 Accession Council at St. James's Palace, where George VI swore an oath, was filmed in the Livery Hall of Drapers' Hall. The room, ornate and vast, met the occasion: the daunting nature of the new King's responsibilities was shown by surrounding him with rich detail, flags and royal portraiture.[22][23]\n\n\nThe crew investigated Logue's former consultation rooms, but they were too small to film in. Instead, they found a high, vaulted room not far away in 33 Portland Place. Eve Stewart, the production designer, liked the mottled, peeling wallpaper there so much that she recreated the effect throughout the entire room.[18] In his DVD commentary, Hooper said he liked Portland Place as a set because it felt \"lived in\", unlike other period houses in London. The scenes of the Duke of York at home with his family were also filmed here; showing the Prince living in a townhouse \"subverted\" expectations of a royal drama.[15]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Pullens buildings with a 1930s advertisement\nThe opening scene, set at the closing ceremony of the 1925 British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium, was filmed on location at Elland Road, home of Leeds United, and Odsal Stadium, home of Bradford RLFC. Elland Road was used for the speech elements of the prince stammering his way through his first public address, and Odsal Stadium was selected because of the resemblance of its curved ends to Wembley Stadium in 1925.[24] The crew had access to the stadium only at 10\u00a0pm, after a football game. They filled the terraces with inflatable dummies and over 250 extras dressed in period costumes. Live actors were interspersed to give the impression of a crowd. Additional people, as well as more ranks of soldiers on the pitch, were added in post-production with visual effects.[18][25]\n\n\nOther locations include Cumberland Lodge, Harley Street, Knebworth, Hatfield House, the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, Queen Street Mill Textile Museum in Burnley, and Battersea Power Station, which doubled as a BBC wireless control room.[26] The final cut of the film was completed on 31 August 2010.[27]\n\n\n\n### Dialogue[edit]\n\n\nIn developing his portrayal of George VI's stammer, Firth worked with Neil Swain, the voice coach for the film. His sister, Kate Firth, also a professional voice coach to actors, proposed exercises the King might have done with Logue, and made suggestions on how to imagine Logue's mix of physical and psychological coaching for the film.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn addition, Firth watched archive footage of the King speaking. In an interview with Allan Tyrer published by the British Stammering Association, Swain said: \"[It] was very interesting while we were working on the film just to think tonally how far we could go and should go with the strength of George's stammer. I think a less courageous director than Tom [Hooper] \u2013 and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [Firth] \u2013 might have felt the need to slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did.\"[28] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: \"You can probably hear even from this interview, there are moments when it's quite infectious. You find yourself doing it and if I start thinking about it the worse it gets. If nothing else it's an insight into what it feels like.\"[29]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The King's Speech (soundtrack)\n\nThe film's original music is composed by Alexandre Desplat, which consisted of a sparse arrangement of strings and piano. The London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Terry Davies, limited orchestral score by only adding oboe and harp in one cut, to convey the character of the king,[30] while also using single note to represent the stickiness of the King's speech.[31] Old microphones extracted from the EMI archives, specially made for the royal family, had been used to record the score, to create a dated sound.[31]\n\n\nThe use of the 2nd movement (Allegretto) of Beethoven's 7th Symphony, played during the broadcast of the 1939 radio speech from the film's climax, was played as a temp track added by editor Tariq Anwar. Desplat did not want to change the track and defended Anwar's suggestion, as the theme has a universal quality. Hooper further remarked that the stature of the piece helps elevate the status of the speech to a public event.[32] The score album also featured Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Marriage of Figaro overture.[32] The score was nominated for several awards, including Best Original Score at the Oscars, Golden Globes, and BAFTAs, winning the latter award. The score also won a Grammy at the 54th Grammy Awards.\n\n\n\n## Visual style[edit]\n\n\n![A man wrapped in a blue jacket and black hat looks down the scope of a large film camera. There is red, white, and blue bunting hanging overhead.](image)Tom Hooper operating a camera on location at Queen Street Mill Textile Museum, Lancashire\nHooper employed a number of cinematic techniques to evoke the King's feelings of constriction. He and cinematographer Danny Cohen used wider than normal lenses to photograph the film, typically 14mm, 18mm, 21mm, 25mm and 27mm, where the subtle distortion of the picture helps to convey the King's discomfort.[33][34] For instance, the subjective point of view shot during the Empire exhibition speech used a close up of the microphone with a wider lens, similar to the filming technique used for one of the Duke's early consultations with a physician.[15] In *The New York Times*, Manohla Dargis wrote that the feeling of entrapment inside the King's head was rendered overly literal with what she believed to be a fisheye lens, though in these scenes the wider lenses were used.[33][35] Hooper also discussed using the 18mm lens, one he likes \"because it puts human beings in their context\".[15]\n\n\nRoger Ebert noted that the majority of the film was shot indoors, where oblong sets, corridors, and small spaces manifest constriction and tightness, in contrast to the usual emphasis on sweep and majesty in historical dramas.[36] Hooper used wide shots to capture the actors' body language, particularly that of Geoffrey Rush, who trained at L'\u00c9cole Internationale de Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Jacques Lecoq in Paris and \"is consequently brilliant in the way he carries his body\". Hooper widened his scope first to capture Rush's gestures, then full body movements and silhouettes. The approach carried over to Firth as well. In the first consultation scene, the Duke is squeezed against the end of a long couch framed against a large wall, \"as if to use the arm of the sofa as a kind of friend, as a security blanket?\"[33] Martin Filler praised the \"low-wattage\" cinematography of Danny Cohen's, as making everything look like it has been \"steeped in strong tea\".[37]\n\n\nAt other times, the camera was positioned very close to the actors to catch the emotion in their faces: \"If you put a lens 6 inches from somebody's face, you get more emotion than if you're on a long lens 20 feet away,\" Cohen said in an interview.[34] Hooper sought a second subtlety while filming the first consultation room scene between the two men, having placed the camera 18\u00a0inches from Colin Firth's face: \"I wanted the nervousness of the first day to percolate into his performances,\" he said.[33]\n\n\nHistorical dramas traditionally tend to use \"soft light\", but Hooper wanted to use a harsher glare, which gives a more contemporary feel, and thus a greater emotional resonance. To achieve the effect, the lighting team erected huge blackout tents over the Georgian buildings and used large lights filtered through Egyptian cotton.[34]\n\n\n\n## Historical accuracy[edit]\n\n\nSeveral events in the film did not happen, or were exaggerated. The visual blog *Information is Beautiful* deduced that, while taking creative licence into account, the film was 74.4% accurate when compared to real-life events, summarising: \"Some nips and tucks of the historical record, but mostly an accurate retelling of a unique friendship\".[38]\n\n\n\n### Relationship with Lionel Logue[edit]\n\n\nThe filmmakers not only tightened the chronology of the events to just a few years but even shifted the timeline of treatment. The Duke of York actually began working with Logue in October 1926, ten years before the abdication crisis, and the improvement in his speech was apparent in months rather than years as suggested by the film.[39] When he was dispatched to Australia to open their new Parliament House in Canberra in 1927, the Duke gave numerous speeches during the journey and performed well despite Logue not accompanying him on the trip.[40] He wrote to Logue from the Caribbean, \"You remember my fear of 'The King'. I give it every evening at dinner on board. This does not worry me any more.\"[40] Of his speech opening Parliament it was observed that he spoke \"resonantly and without stuttering\".[41]\n\n\nRobert Logue, a grandson of Lionel, doubted the film's depiction of the speech therapist, stating \"I don't think he ever swore in front of the King and he certainly never called him 'Bertie'\".[42] Andrew Roberts, an English historian, states that the severity of the King's stammer was exaggerated and the characters of Edward VIII, Wallis Simpson, and George V made more antagonistic than they really were, to increase the dramatic effect.[43]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nChristopher Hitchens and Isaac Chotiner have criticised the film for failing to indict the appeasement of the era or to portray Edward VIII's sympathetic attitude to Nazi Germany.[44] *The Guardian* also corrected the portrayal of Stanley Baldwin as having resigned due to his refusal to order Britain's re-armament, when he in fact stepped down as \"a national hero, exhausted by more than a decade at the top\".[45] Stanley's grandson, Earl Baldwin, was particularly unhappy with this film due to its factual distortions and portrayal of his grandfather as a dithering fool who misunderstood Hitler's intentions.[46]\n\n\nHugo Vickers, an adviser on the film, agreed that the alteration of historical details to preserve the essence of the dramatic story was sometimes necessary. The high-ranking officials, for instance, would not have been present when the King made his speech, nor would Churchill have been involved at any level, \"but the average viewer knows who Churchill is; he doesn't know who Lord Halifax and Sir Samuel Hoare are.\"[47]\n\n\nHitchens and Chotiner also challenged the film's portrayal of Winston Churchill's role in the abdication crisis.[48][49] It is well established that Churchill encouraged Edward VIII to resist pressure to abdicate, whereas he is portrayed in the film as supportive of the Duke of York and not opposed to the abdication.[50] Hitchens attributes this treatment to the \"cult\" surrounding Churchill's legacy. In a smart, well-made film \"would the true story not have been fractionally more interesting for the audience?\", he wondered.[44]\n\n\n\n### Realism[edit]\n\n\nMartin Filler acknowledged that the film legitimately used artistic licence to make valid dramatic points, such as in the probably imagined scene when George V lectures his son on the importance of broadcasting. Filler cautions that George VI would never have tolerated Logue addressing him casually, nor swearing, and the King almost certainly would have understood a newsreel of Hitler speaking in German. Filler makes the larger point that both the King and his wife were, in reality, lukewarm towards Churchill because of the latter's support for his brother during the abdication crisis.[37]\n\n\nCommenting on the film's final scene on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, Andrew Roberts has written, \"The scene is fairly absurd from a historical point of view\u00a0\u2013 Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill were not present and there were no cheering crowds outside Buckingham Palace.\"[43] However, Roberts praises the film overall as a sympathetic portrayal of the King's \"quiet, unassuming heroism [...] The portrayals by Firth and Bonham Carter are sympathetic and acute, and the movie's occasional factual b\u00eatises should not detract from that.\"[43]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Cinema release[edit]\n\n\nThe film had its world premi\u00e8re on 6 September 2010 at the Telluride Film Festival in the United States.[27] It was screened at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival, on Firth's 50th birthday, where it received a standing ovation and won the People's Choice Award.[51] The cinema release poster was re-designed to show an extreme close-up of Firth's jaw and a microphone after Hooper criticised the first design as a \"train smash\".[52] Tim Appelo called the original, air-brushed effort, which showed the three leads, \"shockingly awful\" though the new one \"really is worthwhile\".[53]\n\n\nThe film was distributed by Transmission Films in Australia and by Momentum Pictures in the United Kingdom. The Weinstein Company distributed it in North America, Germany, Benelux, Scandinavia, China, Hong Kong, and Latin America.[54] The film was released in France on 2 February 2011 by Wild Bunch under the title *Le discours d'un roi*.[55]\n\n\n\n### Ratings controversy[edit]\n\n\nThe film was initially given a 15 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification, due to a minute-long scene where Logue encourages the King to swear, which he could do without stuttering. At the London Film Festival, Hooper criticised the decision, questioning how the board could certify the film \"15\" for bad language but allow films such as *Salt* (2010) and *Casino Royale* (2006) to have \"12A\" ratings, despite their graphic torture scenes. Following Hooper's criticism, the board lowered the rating to \"12A\", allowing children under 12 years of age to see the film if they are accompanied by an adult.[56][4] Hooper levelled the same criticism at the Motion Picture Association of America, which gave the film an \"R\" rating, preventing anyone under the age of 17 from seeing the film without an adult.[57] In his review, Roger Ebert criticised the \"R\" rating, calling it \"utterly inexplicable\", and wrote, \"This is an excellent film for teenagers.\"[36]\n\n\nIn January 2011 Harvey Weinstein, the executive producer and distributor, said he was considering having the film re-edited to remove some profanity, so that it would receive a lower classification and reach a larger audience.[58] Hooper refused to cut the film, though he considered covering the swear words with bleeps. Helena Bonham Carter also defended the film, saying, \"[The film] is not violent. It's full of humanity and wit. [It's] for people not with just a speech impairment, but who have got confidence [doubts].\"[59] After receiving his Academy Award, Colin Firth noted that he does not support re-editing the film; while he does not condone the use of profanity, he maintains that its use was not offensive in this context. \"The scene serves a purpose\", Firth states.[60] An alternative version, with some of the profanities muted out, was classified as \"PG-13\" in the United States; this version was released to cinemas on 1 April 2011, replacing the R-rated one.[61][62] The PG-13 version of this film is not available on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nIn Great Britain and Ireland, the film was the highest earning film on its opening weekend. It took in \u00a33,510,000 from 395 cinemas. *The Guardian* said that it was one of the biggest takes in recent memory, and compared it to *Slumdog Millionaire* (2008), which, two years earlier, earned \u00a31.5\u00a0million less.[63] *The King's Speech* continued a \"stunning three weeks\" atop the UK Box office, and earned over \u00a33\u00a0million for four consecutive weekends, the first film to do so since *Toy Story 3* (2010).[64] After five weeks on UK release, it was hailed as the most successful independent British film ever.[7]\n\n\nIn the United States *The King's Speech* opened with $355,450 (\u00a3220,000) in four cinemas. It holds the record for the highest per-cinema gross of 2010.[65] It was widened to 700 screens on Christmas Day and 1,543 screens on 14 January 2011. It eventually made $138\u00a0million in North America overall.[1]\n\n\nIn Australia *The King's Speech* made more than A$6,281,686 (\u00a34\u00a0million) in the first two weeks, according to figures collected by the Motion Picture Distributors Association of Australia. The executive director of Palace Cinemas, Benjamin Zeccola, said customer feedback on the film was spectacular. \"It's our No.1 for all the period, all throughout the country.\u00a0... I think this is more successful than *Slumdog Millionaire* and a more uplifting film. It's a good example of a film that started out in the independent cinemas and then spread to the mainstream cinemas.\"[66]\n\n\nOf the film's net profit, estimated to amount to $30\u201340\u00a0million (\u00a320\u201325\u00a0million) from the cinema release alone, roughly 20% was to be split between Geoffrey Rush (as executive producer), Tom Hooper and Colin Firth, who were to receive their bonuses before the other stakeholders. The remaining profit was to be split equally between the producers and the equity investors.[67] The UK Film Council invested \u00a31\u00a0million of public funds from the United Kingdom lottery into the film. In March 2011 *Variety* estimated that the return could be between fifteen and twenty times that. The council's merger into the British Film Institute means that the profits were to be returned to that body.[68]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> \n> As the actor of the year in the film of the year, I can't think of enough adjectives to praise Firth properly. *The King's Speech* has left me speechless.[69]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Rex Reed, *New York Observer*\n\n*The King's Speech* has received widespread critical acclaim, with Firth's performance receiving universal praise. Bonham Carter and Rush were also widely praised with both going on to win BAFTAs and receiving Academy Award nominations.[70][71] Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 94% based on reviews from 297 critics; the film's average rating was calculated as 8.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Colin Firth gives a masterful performance in *The King's Speech*, a predictable but stylishly produced and rousing period drama.\"[72] Metacritic gave the film a weighted score of 88/100, based on 41 critical reviews, which indicates \"universal acclaim\".[73] CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade.[74] *Empire* gave the film five stars out of five, commenting, \"You'll be lost for words.\"[75] Lisa Kennedy of *The Denver Post* gave the film full marks for its humane qualities and craftsmanship: \"It is an intelligent, winning drama fit for a king \u2013 and the rest of us\", she said.[76] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* awarded the film a full four stars, commenting that \"what we have here is a superior historical drama and a powerful personal one.\"[36] Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* gave four stars out of five, stating, \"Tom Hooper's richly enjoyable and handsomely produced movie\u00a0... is a massively confident crowd-pleaser.\"[77]\n\n\nManohla Dargis, whilst generally ambivalent towards the film, called the lead performances one of its principal attractions. \"With their volume turned up, the appealing, impeccably professional Mr. Firth and Mr. Rush rise to the acting occasion by twinkling and growling as their characters warily circle each other before settling into the therapeutic swing of things and unknowingly preparing for the big speech that partly gives the film its title,\" she wrote.[35] *The Daily Telegraph* called Guy Pearce's performance as Edward VIII \"formidable ... with glamour, charisma and utter self-absorption\".[78] *Empire* said he played the role well as \"a flash harry flinty enough to shed a nation for a wife.\"[75] *The New York Times* thought he was able to create \"a thorny tangle of complications in only a few abbreviated scenes\".[35] Hooper praised the actor in the DVD commentary, saying he \"nailed\" the 1930s royal accent.[15] Richard Corliss of *Time* magazine named Colin Firth's performance one of the Top 10 Movie Performances of 2010.[79]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe performances of (left to right) Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, and Helena Bonham Carter were all lauded by critics and nominated for Academy Awards, with Firth winning Best Actor in a Leading Role.\n\nAllocin\u00e9, a French cinema website, gave the film an average of four out of five stars, based on a survey of 21 reviews.[80] *Le Monde*, which characterised the film as the \"latest manifestation of British narcissism\" and summarised it as \"We are ugly and boring, but, By Jove!, we are right!\", nevertheless admired the performances of Firth, Rush, and Bonham Carter. It said that, though the film swept British appeasement under the carpet, it was still enjoyable.[81]\n\n\nSlovenian Marxist philosopher and cultural critic Slavoj \u017di\u017eek has incorporated the film into his critique of ideology by describing it as \"reactionary,\" interpreting the king's stutter as evidence that he \"displays a minimum of common sense, experiencing the stupidity of seriously accepting that one is king by divine will\" and claiming that \"the task of the Australian voice-coach is to render him stupid enough to accept his being a king as his natural property.\" \u017di\u017eek thus interprets the king's stutter as a case of what is referred to in Lacanian psychoanalysis as \"symbolic castration.\"[82]\n\n\nQueen Elizabeth II, the daughter and successor of King George VI, was sent two copies of the film before Christmas 2010. *The Sun* newspaper reported she had watched the film in a private screening at Sandringham House. A palace source described her reaction as being \"touched by a moving portrayal of her father\".[83] Seidler called the reports \"the highest honour\" the film could receive.[84]\n\n\n\n### Depiction of stuttering[edit]\n\n\nThe British Stammering Association welcomed the release of *The King's Speech*, congratulating the film makers on their \"realistic depiction of the frustration and the fear of speaking faced by people who stammer on a daily basis.\" It said that \"Colin Firth's portrayal of the King's stammer in particular strikes us as very authentic and accurate.\"[85] The Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists welcomed the film, and launched their \"Giving Voice\" campaign around the time of its commercial release.[86]\n\n\nDisfluency advocate Jonah Lehrer called the film \"an inspiring tale\" and praised its portrayal of the troubles suffered by Firth's character.\n[87] However, Lehrer and other advocates criticized the film's depiction of stuttering as a result of emotional repression and childhood trauma. The treatment performed by Rush's character also drew criticism.[87] Lehrer did admit it was a necessary artistic license: \"[the film] would have been a rather tedious piece of entertainment if the climactic scene involved Logue telling the monarch that his primary motor cortex was to blame.\"[87]\n\n\nScience journalist Jeremy Hsu wrote that the film \"mainly succeeds by tackling the social stigma that surrounds stuttering.\"[88] However, similar to Lehrer, he disapproved that it perpetuated myths about the condition, namely its relationship with childhood trauma and overly strict parenting.[88][89]\n\n\nColumnist Jane Ahlin praised the film as it \"brings out of the shadows a common problem figuring into the lives of children and adults from every culture around the world.\" At the same time, she stated, \"heartwarming though the movie *The King's Speech* is, as someone who married a stutterer and is the mother of a stutterer, I'm not sure it does anything to put myths about stuttering to rest.\"[90] She criticized the depiction of family and social dynamics as causes of the condition, as well as the portrayal of stutterering as connected to emotional or psychological problems.[90]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by The King's Speech\n\n![Two middle aged men stand side by side wearing suits and open-necked shirts.

Although the plot was original, it is loosely based on a series of stories by the *Spotlight* team that earned *The Globe* the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.[7] The film features an ensemble cast including Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, and Stanley Tucci, with Brian d'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, and Billy Crudup in supporting roles.[8]\n\n\n*Spotlight* was shown in the Out of Competition section of the 72nd Venice International Film Festival,[9] the Telluride Film Festival and the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.[10] It was released on November 6, 2015, by Open Road Films and grossed $98 million worldwide.[3] It received widespread critical praise, with critics lauding the performances of the cast, historical accuracy and screenplay; it won numerous guilds' and critics' association awards, and was named one of the best films of 2015 by various publications. *Spotlight* won the Academy Award for Best Picture, along with Best Original Screenplay, from six total nominations, making it the first Best Picture winner since *The Greatest Show on Earth* (1952) to win only one other Oscar. The film also won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1976, at a Boston Police station, two policemen discuss the arrest of Fr. John Geoghan for child molestation. A high-ranking cleric talks to the mother of the children. An assistant district attorney then enters the precinct and tells the policemen not to let the press learn what has happened. The arrest is not publicized and Geoghan is released.\n\n\nIn 2001, Marty Baron, the new managing editor of *The Boston Globe*, meets Walter \"Robby\" Robinson, the editor of the newspaper's \"Spotlight\" investigative team. After Baron reads a *Globe* article about a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, charging that Cardinal Bernard Law, the Archbishop of Boston, knew about Geoghan's sexual abuse of children and did nothing to stop it, Baron urges the Spotlight team to investigate. Journalist Michael Rezendes contacts Garabedian, who initially declines to be interviewed. Though he is told not to, Rezendes reveals that he is on the Spotlight team and convinces Garabedian to talk.\n\n\nInitially believing that they are following the story of one priest who was moved to new assignments several times, the Spotlight team begin to uncover a pattern of sexual abuse by other priests in Massachusetts and an ongoing cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese. Through Phil Saviano, who heads the victims' rights group Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), the team is led to widen their search to thirteen priests. Richard Sipe, a former priest who worked to rehabilitate sexually abusive priests, tells them that his studies suggest that there are approximately 90 abusive priests in Boston (6% of priests). Through their research, the team develops a list of 87 names and begin to find victims to back up their suspicions.\n\n\nAs the team realizes the sheer scale of the investigation, it begins to take a toll on their lives: reporter Matt Carroll learns one of the priest rehabilitation centers is on the same block as his family's home but cannot tell his children or his neighbors to avoid spoiling the story; reporter Sacha Pfeiffer finds herself unable to attend church with her grandmother; Rezendes pushes to get the story out quickly to prevent further abuse; and Robinson faces pushback from some of his close friends who he learns were complicit in covering up the abuse.\n\n\nWhen the September 11 attacks occur, the team is forced to de-prioritize the story. They regain momentum when Rezendes learns from Garabedian that there are publicly available documents that confirm Cardinal Law was made aware of the abuse and ignored it. Although Rezendes argues vociferously to run the story immediately, before more victims suffer and rival newspapers publish comparable articles, Robinson steadfastly refuses, arguing the team needs to research further so that the systemic problem can be more fully exposed. After the *Globe* wins a case to have even more legal documents unsealed that provide the evidence of that larger picture, the Spotlight team finally begins to write the story and plan to publish their findings in early 2002.\n\n\nAs they are about to go to print, Robinson admits that he learned during the investigation that he was sent a list of 20 sexually abusive priests by lawyer Eric MacLeish in 1993, on which Robinson never followed up. Baron still commends Robinson and the Spotlight team's efforts to expose the crimes now. The story goes to print with a weblink to the documents that expose Law's inaction and a phone number for victims of abusive priests. The next morning, the team is inundated with calls from victims coming forward to tell their stories.\n\n\nA textual epilogue notes that Law resigned in December 2002 and was eventually promoted to the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, and presents a list of 105 U.S. communities and 101 others around the world where major scandals involving abuse by priests have taken place.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Mark Ruffalo as Michael Rezendes[11][12]\n* Michael Keaton as Walter \"Robby\" Robinson[13]\n* Rachel McAdams as Sacha Pfeiffer[11]\n* Brian d'Arcy James as Matt Carroll[14]\n* Liev Schreiber as Marty Baron[13]\n* John Slattery as Ben Bradlee Jr.[5]\n* Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian, an attorney representing victims of sexual abuse[13]\n* Gene Amoroso as Stephen Kurkjian, *Boston Globe* general investigative reporter[15]\n* Jamey Sheridan as Jim Sullivan, an attorney representing the Church[5][16]\n* Billy Crudup as Eric MacLeish, an attorney representing victims of sexual abuse[13][16]\n* Maureen Keiller as Eileen McNamara, *Boston Globe* columnist[17]\n* Richard Jenkins as Richard Sipe, psychotherapist (telephone voice, uncredited)[18]\n* Paul Guilfoyle as Peter Conley\n* Len Cariou as Cardinal Bernard Law, Archbishop of Boston\n* Neal Huff as Phil Saviano of SNAP[19]\n* Michael Countryman as Richard Gilman, publisher of the *Boston Globe*\n* Michael Cyril Creighton as Joe Crowley\n* Laurie Heineman as Judge Constance Sweeney\n* David Fraser as John Albano[20]\n* Tim Progosh as Principal Bill Kemeza\n* Jimmy LeBlanc as Patrick McSorley[21]\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nThe film was written by Tom McCarthy and co-writer Josh Singer. When McCarthy was asked how he and his co-author tackled the research and writing process, he said:\n\n\n\n\n> As I said, I passed [turned down the film] the first time! That's probably some indication of how intimidating it was. But I think, as always, with any big assignment, once you get over that initial shock and awe of how much material there was to cover, you start digging into the material and become really fascinated by and engaged with it, and we did. And yeah, it was a lot of work, but it was exciting work. It was really interesting work, parsing through details of not just the investigation, but its findings, and trying to determine what was most helpful in telling our story. I think having two brains on it was somewhat helpful too, because we could talk through it a lot. So it wasn't just sitting alone in a room and jotting notes. We were dialoguing a lot about it. That particular collaboration did feel investigative and on some level, seemed to parallel some of the collaboration of the reporters in that investigation. So, I think there was something about our collaboration that made that initial process more palatable on some level.[22]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nMcCarthy and Singer completed the script in June 2013.[23] It was on the 2013 Black List of unproduced screenplays.[24] Singer told *Creative Screenwriting* that one of his goals for the film was to highlight the power of journalism, which he feels has been waning. He explained, \"This story isn't about exposing the Catholic Church. We were not on some mission to rattle people's faith. In fact, Tom came from a Catholic family. The motive was to tell the story accurately while showing the power of the newsroom\u2014something that's largely disappeared today. This story is important. Journalism is important, and there is a deeper message in the story.\"[25]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on September 24, 2014, in Boston, Massachusetts,[26] and continued in October in Hamilton, Ontario. Filming took place at Fenway Park,[27] the then-current *Boston Globe* offices in Dorchester, Boston,[28] the Boston Public Library,[29] and McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.[30] The film's editor Tom McArdle said of the post-production process, \"We edited for eight months. We just wanted to keep refining the film. We cut out five scenes plus some segments of other scenes. Often we would just cut out a line or two to make a scene a little tighter.\"[31] The Boston Police station depicted in the opening scene was filmed in Toronto at the former Toronto Police Service 11 Division station at 209 Mavety Street,[32] and the former Sears building on Islington Avenue in Toronto was converted into a replica of the interior of the old *Boston Globe*, where the bulk of the filming took place.[33] The brief scene in which Rezendes watches a children's church choir perform \"Silent Night\" was filmed in St. Basil's Church (Toronto), a Roman Catholic church on the University of Toronto campus.\n\n\n\n### Historical accuracy[edit]\n\n\nThe visual blog *Information is Beautiful* deduced that, while taking creative license into account, the film was 76.2% accurate when compared to real-life events, summarizing that \"the only conceits are scenes of power figures warning off the journalists\".[34]\n\n\n\n* The film depicts only the events leading up to the publication of the Spotlight team's first article, whereas the team actually continued publishing follow-up reports for nearly two years afterward. As a result, certain events are depicted as having happened earlier than they actually did, including the scene where former priest Ronald H. Paquin freely admits to molesting children and having been molested himself.[35]\n* While Sacha Pfeiffer did indeed write the numerous follow-up reports on Paquin, the interview depicted in the film was a blend of two interviews conducted by her and Steve Kurkjian, both of which took place about a month after the events in the film. Kurkjian, played in the film by Gene Amoroso, was a founding member of the Spotlight team before becoming the *Globe*'s Washington bureau chief, but rejoined the team after the first story was published to assist with further reporting on the abuses. Pfeiffer and Kurkjian have said that the confession was a much more gradual process and Paquin did not just \"blurt it out\" the way he does in the film.[35][36]\n* A scene where Matt Carroll discovers one of the priest treatment centers is down the block from where he lives is based on an actual discovery he made during the investigation, with one minor detail changed: Carroll actually lived down the street from John Geoghan, the priest whose case sparked the investigations. This was changed as the filmmakers thought the image of Carroll putting Geoghan's photo on his refrigerator to warn his children would seem unrealistic.[37]\n* In a subplot, Eric MacLeish claims he sent a list of 20 priests to the *Globe* in 1993 but the story was buried in Metro: Robinson later admits he was the editor for Metro at the time and he likely overlooked the case. While the *Globe* did publish an article about the list of 20 priests, the Spotlight team did not learn this during their investigation. MacLeish himself revealed the article's existence while being interviewed for the screenplay by McCarthy and Singer. This revelation, along with Robinson's response to the filmmakers' inquiry, was incorporated into the screenplay for dramatic purposes.[38]\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spotlight (soundtrack)\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\nThe film \"premiered to sustained applause\" at the Venice Film Festival, and the audience \"erupted in laughter\" when the film reported that following the events in the film Cardinal Bernard Law was reassigned to a senior position of honor in Rome.[9] It had a limited release on November 6, 2015, with its U.S. release scheduled for three weeks later on November 25.[39]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Spotlight* was released by Universal Studios Home Entertainment on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States on February 23, 2016.[40]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Spotlight* grossed $45.1 million in the United States and Canada and $53.2 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $98.3 million, against a production budget of $20 million.[3] *The Hollywood Reporter* calculated the film made a net profit of up to $10 million.[41]\n\n\nIn the opening weekend of its limited release, the film grossed $295,009 from five theaters ($59,002 average), one of the highest per-screen averages of any release of 2015.[42] The film grossed $4.4 million in the first weekend during its wide release, finishing 8th at the box office.[43]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nMark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams' performances received Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively.\n\n*Spotlight* received critical acclaim.

The website's summary of the critical consensus is that \"*Spotlight* gracefully handles the lurid details of its fact-based story while resisting the temptation to lionize its heroes, resulting in a drama that honors the audience as well as its real-life subjects.\"[44] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 93 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[45]\n\n\n*Variety*'s Justin Chang called the film \"a superbly controlled and engrossingly detailed account of the *Boston Globe*'s Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation into the widespread pedophilia scandals and subsequent cover-ups within the Catholic Church.\"[46] Joe Morgenstern of *The Wall Street Journal* wrote, \"To turn a spotlight fittingly on *Spotlight*, it's the year's best movie so far, and a rarity among countless dramatizations that claim to be based on actual events.\"[47] Mark Kermode of *The Guardian* gave it 4 out of 5 stars and praised Ruffalo's performance, writing, \"As for Mark Ruffalo, he's the closest thing this ensemble cast has to a star turn, a long-suppressed outburst of emotion providing one of the film's few grandstanding showstoppers.\"[48] Helen O'Hara of *Empire* gave the movie 4 out of 5 stars and called it a \"grown-up film about serious people that mercifully escapes any awards-grabbing platitudes\" and \"more thrilling than most action movies.\"[49] Richard Propes of *The Independent Critic* gave *Spotlight* 4 out of 4 marks and praised the screenplay and cast: \"*Spotlight* is a nearly perfect example of what happens when the perfect filmmaker works with the perfect script and acquires the perfect cast and crew to bring a story to life\".[50]\n\n\nAt the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, *Spotlight* finished third in the audience balloting for the People's Choice Award.[51]\n\n\nComparing *Spotlight* to *The Post*, a similar period film about journalists, critic Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com expressed perplexity over critics' muted praise for the latter film, writing that in terms of direction, *Spotlight* \"got praise for doing a tenth of what Steven Spielberg does here\".[52][53]\n\n\n\n### Top ten lists[edit]\n\n\n*Spotlight* was included on many critics' top-ten lists.[54]\n\n\n\n* 1st\u00a0\u2013 Peter Travers, *Rolling Stone*\n* 1st\u00a0\u2013 Christoper Orr, *The Atlantic*\n* 1st\u00a0\u2013 Bill Goodykoontz, *Arizona Republic*\n* 1st\u00a0\u2013 Lou Lumenick, *New York Post*\n* 1st\u00a0\u2013 Rex Reed, *New York Observer*\n* 1st\u00a0\u2013 Ty Burr, *Boston Globe*\n* 1st\u00a0\u2013 Michael Phillips, *Chicago Tribune*\n* 1st\u00a0\u2013 Stephanie Zacharek, *Time*\n* 1st\u00a0\u2013 Ann Hornaday, *The Washington Post*\n* 1st\u00a0\u2013 Kate Erbland, *Indiewire*\n* 1st\u00a0\u2013 Joe Morgenstern, *Wall Street Journal*\n* 2nd\u00a0\u2013 Peter Debruge, *Variety*\n* 2nd\u00a0\u2013 Christy Lemire, *RogerEbert.com*\n* 3rd\u00a0\u2013 Scott Feinberg, *The Hollywood Reporter*\n* 3rd\u00a0\u2013 Rene Rodriguez, *Miami Herald*\n* 3rd\u00a0\u2013 Inkoo Kang, *TheWrap*\n* 3rd\u00a0\u2013 James Berardinelli, *Reelviews*\n* 3rd\u00a0\u2013 Richard Lawson, *Vanity Fair*\n* 3rd\u00a0\u2013 J.R.

Before its release, Cardinal Sean O'Malley of the Archdiocese of Boston issued a statement in the archdiocese's official newspaper, stating that the \"media's investigative reporting on the abuse crisis instigated a call for the Church to take responsibility for its failings and to reform itself\u2014to deal with what was shameful and hidden.\"[55] O'Malley had not seen the movie at that time but planned to do so.[56]\n\n\nOn November 9, 2015, a review in the *Catholic News Service* called the film a \"generally accurate chronicle\" of the Boston scandal, but objected to some of the portrayals and the film's view of the Church.[57] On the *Catholic News Service*, auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles Robert Barron said that it is \"not a bad movie\", as it shows how the wider community shares the responsibility for sexual abuse committed by priests, but that the film is wrong to insinuate that the Church has not reformed.[58]\n\n\nVatican Radio, the official radio service of the Holy See, called it \"honest\" and \"compelling\" and said it helped the U.S. Catholic Church \"to accept fully the sin, to admit it publicly, and to pay all the consequences.\"[59] Luca Pellegrini on the Vatican Radio website wrote that the *Globe* reporters \"made themselves examples of their most pure vocation, that of finding the facts, verifying sources, and making themselves\u2014for the good of the community and of a city\u2014paladins of the need for justice.\"[59][60] In February 2016, a Vatican City commission on clerical sex abuse attended a private screening of the film.[61] Following the film's Best Picture win at the Oscars, Vatican newspaper *L'Osservatore Romano* ran a column assuring that it is \"not an anti-Catholic film\", and Vatican Radio revealed that clerics in Rome have been recommending the film to each other.[62][63][64]\n\n\n\n### Criticism[edit]\n\n\nA January 8, 2016, article in *The New York Times* cited author David F. Pierre Jr., who said that *Spotlight* \"is a misrepresentation of how the Church dealt with sexual abuse cases\", asserting that the movie's biggest flaw was its failure to portray psychologists who had assured Church officials that abusive priests could be safely returned to ministry after undergoing therapy treatments. Open Road Films rebutted the detractor, saying he was \"perpetuating a myth in order to distract from real stories of abuse.\"[65]\n\n\nThe film was attacked by Jack Dunn (played by Gary Galone), the public relations head and a member of the board at Boston College High School, for portraying him as callous and indifferent to the scandal. Dunn says he was immediately aware of the issues involved and worked to respond after viewing the film.[66] Two of the *Globe* reporters depicted in the film, Walter Robinson and Sacha Pfeiffer, issued a statement in response to Dunn, firmly standing by their recollections of the day, that Dunn did \"his best to frame a story in the most favorable way possible for the institution he is representing. That's what Jack did that day.\" They said Dunn mounted a \"spirited public relations defense of Boston College High School during our first sit-down interview at the school in early 2002,\" the scene in which Dunn is depicted.[67]\n\n\nOn March 15, 2016, Open Road Films released a statement on how Dunn was portrayed in the film: \"As is the case with most movies based on historical events, *Spotlight* contains fictionalized dialogue that was attributed to Mr. Dunn for dramatic effect. We acknowledge that Mr. Dunn was not part of the Archdiocesan cover-up. It is clear from his efforts on behalf of the victims at BC High that he and the filmmakers share a deep, mutual concern for victims of abuse.\"[68] Dunn then also released a statement: \"I feel vindicated by the public statement and relieved to have the record set straight on an issue that has caused me and my family tremendous pain. While it will never erase the horrific experience of being falsely portrayed in an Academy Award-winning film, this public statement enables me to move forward with my reputation and integrity intact.\"[68]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by Spotlight\n\n*Spotlight* has been critically acclaimed, and has been included in many critics' Top Ten Films of 2015 lists.[69] The film has received over 100 industry and critics awards and nominations. The American Film Institute selected *Spotlight* as one of the Top Ten Films of the year.[70] The film garnered three Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama, Best Director for McCarthy, and Best Screenplay for McCarthy and Josh Singer.[71] It was nominated for five Independent Spirit Awards, including Best Feature, Best Director, Best Screenplay for Singer, Best Editing for Tom McArdle and Honorary Robert Altman Award for the cast.[72] Rachel McAdams and the ensemble cast received nominations for the Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role and the Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture respectively, with the cast winning the latter.[73]\n\n\nThe New York Film Critics Circle awarded Michael Keaton the Best Actor award,[74] while it won the Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Ensemble cast at the New York Film Critics Online Awards.[75] *Spotlight* won the Best Film and Best Screenplay from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. It received eight nominations from the Broadcast Film Critics Association, including Best Film, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Screenplay and Best Score.[76] It won the Best Cast in a Motion Picture at Satellite Awards and was nominated for six other awards including Best Film, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress\nand Best Original Screenplay.[77]\n\n\nAt the Academy Awards, the film received six nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for Ruffalo, Best Supporting Actress for McAdams, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Film Editing, winning Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. It is the first Best Picture winner to win fewer than three Academy Awards since 1952's *The Greatest Show on Earth*. At the time of its win, the film had made $39.2 million at the North American box office, which made it the second lowest domestically grossing film (adjusted for ticket-price inflation) to win Best Picture within the past four decades (after *The Hurt Locker* with $17 million).[78]\n\n\n*Spotlight* was listed on over 120 critics' and publications' top ten lists.[69]\n\n\nIt was also voted the 88th greatest film since 2000 in an international critics' poll conducted by BBC.[79] In 2018, IndieWire writers ranked its screenplay the 12th best American screenplay of the 21st century, with Kate Erbland saying that the script \"ticks along so well, not cutting any corners when it comes to the nitty gritty of real-world reporting, while also finding time to develop its characters and tell a banger of a story. It hits the right beats, but it does so in earned ways, rooted in realism\".[80]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Catholicism portal\n* ![](image)Film portal\n* ![](image)Journalism portal\n\n\n* Catholic Archdiocese of Boston sex abuse scandal\n* Catholic Church sexual abuse cases\n* *By the Grace of God*, a 2019 French-Belgian film about three victims of clerical sexual abuse\n* Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP)\n* *All the President's Men*, a 1976 film portraying the *Washington Post* investigation into the Watergate scandal; the overseer of the *Post* investigation, Ben Bradlee, is the father of Ben Bradlee Jr., the overseer of the *Globe* investigation\n* Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"SPOTLIGHT (15)\". *British Board of Film Classification*.

Toole, the pen name of fight manager and cutman Jerry Boyd. It also stars Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. The film follows Margaret \"Maggie\" Fitzgerald (Swank), an underdog amateur boxer who is helped by an underappreciated boxing trainer (Eastwood) to achieve her dream of becoming a professional.\n\n\n*Million Dollar Baby* was theatrically released on December 15, 2004, by Warner Bros. Pictures. It received critical acclaim and grossed $216.8 million worldwide. The film garnered seven nominations at the 77th Academy Awards and won four: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress (for Swank), and Best Supporting Actor (for Freeman). It has since been cited as one of the best films of the 2000s, the 21st century and of all time.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nMargaret \"Maggie\" Fitzgerald, a waitress from the Ozarks, shows up at the Hit Pit, a rundown boxing gym in Los Angeles owned and operated by Frankie Dunn. Dunn is a cantankerous Irish-American trainer, revealed to be estranged from his own daughter. Maggie asks Frankie to train her, but he refuses as he does not train women and she is too old to begin a boxing career. Eddie \"Scrap-Iron\" Dupris, Frankie's friend and employee\u2014the film's narrator\u2014encourages and helps Maggie. \nFrankie's prize prospect, \"Big Willie\" Little, signs with successful manager Mickey Mack after becoming impatient with Frankie rejecting offers for a championship bout. Frankie then reluctantly agrees to train Maggie.\n\n\nMaggie fights her way up in the women's amateur boxing division with Frankie's coaching. Since she has earned a reputation for quick knockouts, Frankie must resort to bribery to get other managers to put their trainee fighters up against her. Scrap, concerned when Frankie rejects several offers for big fights, arranges a meeting for Maggie with Mickey Mack, but out of loyalty to Frankie, she declines. Frankie bestows Maggie a Gaelic nickname, embroidered on her boxing robe, *Mo Chuisle* (misspelled in the film as \"mo cuishle\"), but does not tell her its meaning. The two travel to Europe as she continues to win; Maggie eventually saves up enough of her winnings to buy her mother a house, but her mother berates Maggie for endangering her government aid, claiming that everyone back home is laughing at her.\n\n\nFrankie is finally willing to arrange a title fight. He secures Maggie a $1 million match in Las Vegas against the WBA women's welterweight champion, Billie \"The Blue Bear\" Osterman, a German ex-prostitute who has a reputation as a dirty fighter. Maggie begins to dominate the fight, but Billie knocks her out with an illegal sucker punch from behind after the bell rings to end the round. Maggie lands hard on her corner stool, breaking her neck and leaving her a ventilator-dependent quadriplegic. Frankie seeks out multiple doctors' opinions, none of whom can help. He lashes out at Scrap, blaming him, then tries to bargain with God through prayer. \n\n\nWhile in the hospital, Maggie looks forward to a visit from her family. They arrive only after first touring Disneyland and Universal Studios Hollywood. Accompanied by an attorney, their sole concern is to get Maggie's assets transferred to them. Disgusted, she orders them to leave and threatens to report their welfare fraud if they try to contact her again.\n\n\nMaggie soon develops bedsores and undergoes an amputation for an infected leg. She then asks Frankie to help her die, declaring that she got everything she wanted out of life. A horrified Frankie refuses, so Maggie later bites her own tongue in an attempt to bleed to death. Knowing the fatherly affection Frankie has developed for Maggie, Frankie's priest warns him that he would never find himself again if he were to go through with Maggie's request. Frankie then sneaks into the hospital one night, unaware that Scrap is watching from the shadows. Just before administering a fatal injection of adrenaline, he tells Maggie the meaning of \"mo chuisle\": \"my darling, and my blood.\" He never returns to the gym. Scrap's narration is revealed to be a letter to Frankie's daughter, informing her of her father's true character.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Clint Eastwood as Frankie Dunn, a gruff but well-meaning elderly boxing trainer\n* Hilary Swank as Mary Margaret \"Maggie\" Fitzgerald, a determined, aspiring boxer trained up by Frankie Dunn\n* Morgan Freeman as Eddie \"Scrap-Iron\" Dupris, Dunn's gym assistant and former boxer\n* Jay Baruchel as Dangerous Dillard Fighting Flippo Bam-Bam Barch or \"Danger\", a simpleton would-be boxer\n* Mike Colter as Willie \"Big Willie\" Little, a boxer whom Dunn has trained for years\n* Lucia Rijker as Billie \"The Blue Bear\" Osterman, a former prostitute and vicious boxer\n* Br\u00edan F.

Roberts as Billie's Cut Man\n\n\n## Development and production[edit]\n\n\nAfter being fired from the television series *Family Law*, Haggis wrote the script on spec, and it took four years to sell it.[6][7] The film was stuck in development hell for years before it was shot. Several studios rejected the project even when Eastwood signed on as actor and director. Even Warner Bros., Eastwood's longtime home base, would not agree to a $30 million budget. Eastwood persuaded Lakeshore Entertainment's Tom Rosenberg to put up half the budget (as well as handle foreign distribution), with Warner Bros. contributing the rest. Eastwood shot the film in less than 40 days between June and July 2004.[1][2] Filming took place in Los Angeles and film sets at Warner Bros. Studios.[2] The term 'Million Dollar Baby' was from the nose art of a World War II Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber.[*citation needed*] The titular phrase 'million dollar baby' was used as an insult during pre-fight publicity by Sonny Liston to Muhammad Ali, the latter of whom was an underdog at the time. Eastwood had his daughter Morgan Colette appear in a cameo as a girl who waves to Swank's character at a gas station.[8][9]\n\n\nEastwood had confidence in Swank's acting, but upon seeing Swank's small physique, he had concerns, \"I just thought, 'Yeah, this gal would be great. If we can get her trained up. If we can get a little bit more bulk on her, to make her look like a fighter'...She was like a feather. But what happened is, she had this great work ethic.\"[10]\n\n\nConsequently, to prepare for her role, Swank underwent extensive training in the ring and weight room, gaining 19 pounds of muscle, aided by professional trainer Grant L. Roberts. She trained for nearly five hours every day, winding up with a potentially life-threatening staphylococcus infection out of blisters on her foot. She did not tell Eastwood about the infection because she thought it would be out of character for Maggie.[10]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Million Dollar Baby* initially had a limited release, opening in eight theaters in December 2004.[11] In its later wide release opening, the film earned $12,265,482 in North America and quickly became a box-office hit both domestically and internationally. It grossed $216,763,646 in theaters; $100,492,203 in the United States, and $116,271,443 in other territories. The film played in theaters for six and a half months.[3]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, *Million Dollar Baby* has an approval rating of 90% based on 269 reviews, with an average rating of 8.40/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Clint Eastwood's assured direction\u2014combined with knockout performances from Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman\u2014help *Million Dollar Baby* to transcend its clich\u00e9s, and the result is deeply heartfelt and moving.\"[12] On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100, based on reviews from 39 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[13] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[14]\n\n\nRoger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun Times* gave the film four stars and stated that \"Clint Eastwood's *Million Dollar Baby* is a masterpiece, pure and simple,\" listing it as the best film of 2004.[15] Michael Medved stated: \"My main objection to *Million Dollar Baby* always centered on its misleading marketing, and effort by Warner Brothers to sell it as a movie about a female *Rocky*, with barely a hint of the pitch-dark substance that led Andrew Sarris of the *New York Observer*...to declare that 'no movie in my memory has depressed me more than *Million Dollar Baby*.'\"[*citation needed*][16]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nHilary Swank and Morgan Freeman's performances garnered critical acclaim and they won the Academy Award for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor, respectively.\n\nIn early 2005, the film sparked controversy when some disability rights activists protested the ending. The Disability Rights Education Fund released a statement about the film in February 2005 that included the following: \"Perhaps the most central stereotype fueling disability prejudice is the mistaken assumption inherent in the message of the movie that the quality of life of individuals with disabilities is unquestionably not worth living. This stereotype is contradicted by the personal experience of many thousands of people with significant disabilities in this country and around the world who view our own lives as ordinary and normal. It is further contradicted by plenty of hard data. Research overwhelmingly shows that people with disabilities find satisfaction in our lives to the same degree, or greater, than does the general public.\"[17] The *Chicago Tribune* reported that protests against the film by disability activists occurred in Chicago, Berkeley, and other cities, and that Clint Eastwood had lobbied for weakening provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act.[18][19]\n\n\nWesley J. Smith in *The Weekly Standard* also criticized the film for its ending and for missed opportunities; Smith wrote \"The movie could have ended with Maggie triumphing once again, perhaps having obtained an education and becoming a teacher; or, opening a business managing boxers; or perhaps, receiving a standing ovation as an inspirational speaker.\"[20]\n\n\nEastwood responded to the criticism by saying the film was about the American dream.[21] In an interview with the *Los Angeles Times*, Eastwood distanced himself from the actions of characters in his films, noting, \"I've gone around in movies blowing people away with a .44 Magnum. But that doesn't mean I think that's a proper thing to do\".[22] Roger Ebert stated that \"a movie is not good or bad because of its content, but because of how it handles its content. *Million Dollar Baby* is classical in the clean, clear, strong lines of its story and characters, and had an enormous emotional impact\".[23]\n\n\nThe Gaelic nickname for Swank's character comes from the original phrase *a chuisle mo chro\u00ed*, meaning \"O pulse of my heart\"; one critic noted that the use of Gaelic in the film led to some interest in the language and the phrase.[24]\n\n\n\n### Top ten lists[edit]\n\n\n*Million Dollar Baby* was listed on many critics' top 10 lists for films released in 2004.[25]\n\n\n\n* 1st\u00a0\u2013 A.O.

Clint Eastwood was awarded his second Best Director Oscar for the film, and he received a Best Actor in a Leading Role nomination. Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman received Best Actress in a Leading Role and Best Actor in a Supporting Role Oscars, respectively. Joel Cox, Eastwood's editor for many years, was nominated for Best Film Editing, and Paul Haggis was nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay award.\n\n\nThe film was named the third \"Best Film of the 21st Century So Far\" in 2017 by *The New York Times*.[28] It also ranked number 63 on *Parade*'s list of the \"100 Best Movies of All Time\" in 2023.[29]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Category\n | Subject\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Academy Award | Best Picture | Clint Eastwood, Albert S.
