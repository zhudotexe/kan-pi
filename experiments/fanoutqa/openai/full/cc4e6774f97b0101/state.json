Since 1870, the head of state has been the President of France. Below is a list of all French heads of state. It includes the monarchs of the Kingdom of France, emperors of the First and Second Empire and leaders of the five Republics. \n\n\n\n\n## Merovingian dynasty (509\u2013751)[edit]\n\n\nThe Merovingians were a Salian Frankish dynasty that ruled the Franks for nearly 300 years in a region known as Francia in Latin, beginning in the middle of the 5th century CE. Their territory largely corresponded to ancient Gaul as well as the Roman provinces of Raetia, Germania Superior and the southern part of Germania. The Merovingian dynasty was founded by Childeric I (c. 457\u00a0\u2013 481 CE), the son of Merovech, leader of the Salian Franks, but it was his famous son Clovis I (481\u2013511 CE) who united all of Gaul under Merovingian rule.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Death\n | Relationship with his predecessors\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Clovis I (Clovis Ier) | 509\n | 511\n | Likely died of natural causes aged 46.

His sons Pepin and Carloman briefly restored the Merovingian dynasty by raising Childeric III to the throne in 743. In 751, Pepin deposed Childerich and acceded to the throne.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Death\n | Relationship with his predecessors\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Childeric III (Child\u00e9ric III) | 743\n | November 751\n | Died aged 37.\n | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Chilperic II or of Theuderic IV\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n\n\n## Carolingian dynasty (751\u2013888)[edit]\n\n\nThe Carolingian dynasty was a Frankish noble family with origins in the Arnulfing and Pippinid clans of the 7th century AD. The family consolidated its power in the late 8th century, eventually making the offices of Mayor of the Palace and *dux et princeps Francorum* hereditary and becoming the *de facto* rulers of the Franks as the real powers behind the throne.

The Capetian Dynasty, the male-line descendants of Hugh Capet, ruled France continuously from 987 to 1792 and again from 1814 to 1848. They were direct descendants of the Robertian kings. The cadet branches of the dynasty which ruled after 1328, however, are generally given the specific branch names of *Valois* and *Bourbon*.\n\n\nNot listed below are Hugh Magnus, eldest son of Robert II, and Philip of France, eldest son of Louis VI; both were co-Kings with their fathers (in accordance with the early Capetian practice whereby kings would crown their heirs in their own lifetimes and share power with the co-king), but predeceased them. Because neither Hugh nor Philip were sole or senior king in their own lifetimes, they are not traditionally listed as Kings of France, and are not given ordinals.\n\n\nHenry VI of England, son of Catherine of Valois, became titular King of France upon his grandfather Charles VI's death in accordance with the Treaty of Troyes of 1420 however this was disputed and he is not always regarded as a legitimate king of France.\n\n\nFrom 21 January 1793 to 8 June 1795, Louis XVI's son Louis-Charles was the titular King of France as Louis XVII; in reality, however, he was imprisoned in the Temple throughout this duration, and power was held by the leaders of the Republic. Upon Louis XVII's death, his uncle (Louis XVI's brother) Louis-Stanislas claimed the throne, as Louis XVIII, but only became *de facto* King of France in 1814.\n\n\n\n### House of Capet (987\u20131328)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: House of Capet\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Relationship with his predecessors\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) |  | Hugh Capet (Hugues Capet) | 3 July 987 | 24 October 996 | \u00a0\u2022 Grandson of Robert I[2] | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) |  | Robert II *the Pious, the Wise* (Robert II *le Pieux, le Sage*) | 24 October 996 | 20 July 1031 | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Hugh Capet\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) |  | Henry I(Henri Ier) | 20 July 1031 | 4 August 1060 | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Robert II\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) |  | Philip I *the Amorous*(Philippe Ier *l' Amoureux*) | 4 August 1060 | 29 July 1108 | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Henry I\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) |  | Louis VI *the Fat* (Louis VI *le Gros*) | 29 July 1108 | 1 August 1137 | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Philip I\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis VII *the Young* (Louis VII *le Jeune*) | 1 August 1137 | 18 September 1180 | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Louis VI\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Philip II *Augustus* (Philippe II *Auguste*) | 18 September 1180 | 14 July 1223 | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Louis VII\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs)first monarch to use the title of *King of France*(Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis VIII *the Lion* (Louis VIII *le Lion*) | 14 July 1223 | 8 November 1226 | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Philip II Augustus\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis IX *the Saint* (Saint Louis) | 8 November 1226 | 25 August 1270 | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Louis VIII\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Philip III *the Bold* (Philippe III *le Hardi*) | 25 August 1270 | 5 October 1285 | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Louis IX\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Philip IV *the Fair*, *the Iron King* (Philippe IV *le Bel*) | 5 October 1285 | 29 November 1314 | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Philip III\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis X *the Quarreller* (Louis X *le Hutin*) | 29 November 1314 | 5 June 1316 | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Philip IV\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | John I *the Posthumous* (Jean Ier *le Posthume*) | 15 November 1316 | 20 November 1316 | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Louis X\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Philip V *the Tall* (Philippe V *le Long*) | 20 November 1316 | 3 January 1322 | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Philip IV\u00a0\u2022 Younger brother of Louis X\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Charles IV *the Fair* (Charles IV *le Bel*) | 3 January 1322 | 1 February 1328 | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Philip IV\u00a0\u2022 Younger brother of Louis X and Philip V\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n\n\n### House of Valois (1328\u20131589)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: House of Valois\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Relationship with his predecessors\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Philip VI *of Valois*, *the Fortunate* (Philippe VI *de Valois*, *le Fortun\u00e9*) | 1 April 1328 | 22 August 1350 | \u00a0\u2022 Grandson of Philip III of France[6] | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | John II *the Good* (Jean II *le Bon*) | 22 August 1350 | 8 April 1364 | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Philip VI\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)![](image) | Charles V *the Wise* (Charles V *le Sage*) | 8 April 1364 | 16 September 1380 | \u00a0\u2022 Son of John II\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Charles VI *the Beloved*, *the Mad* (Charles VI *le Bienaim\u00e9*, *le Fol*) | 16 September 1380 | 21 October 1422 | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Charles V\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n\n\n### House of Lancaster (1422\u20131453), disputed[edit]\n\n\nMain article: House of Lancaster\n\nFrom 1340 to 1801 (but not from 1360 to 1369), the Kings of England and Great Britain claimed the title of King of France. Under the terms of the 1420 Treaty of Troyes, Charles VI had recognized his son-in-law Henry V of England as regent and heir. Henry V predeceased Charles VI and so Henry V's son, Henry VI, succeeded his grandfather Charles VI as King of France. Most of Northern France was under English control until 1435, but by 1453, the English had been expelled from all of France save Calais (and the Channel Islands), and Calais itself fell in 1558. Nevertheless, English and then British monarchs continued to claim the title for themselves until the creation of the United Kingdom in 1801.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n

Historians generally divide the Convention's activities into three periods, moderate, radical, and reaction, and the policies of presidents of the Convention reflect these distinctions. During the radical and reaction phases, some of the presidents were executed, most by guillotine, committed suicide, or were deported. In addition, some of the presidents were later deported during the Bourbon Restoration in 1815.\n\n\n\n### Establishment of the Convention[edit]\n\n\nThe National Convention governed France from 20 September 1792 until 26 October 1795 during the most critical period of the French Revolution. The election of the National Convention took place in September 1792 after the election of the electoral colleges by primary regional assemblies on 26 August. Owing to the abstention of aristocrats and the anti-republicans, and the general fear of victimization, the voter turnout in the departments was low \u2013 as little as 7.5 percent or as much as 11.9% of the electorate, compared to 10.2% in the 1791 elections, despite the doubling of the number of eligible voters.[7]\n\n\nInitially elected to provide a new constitution after the overthrow of the monarchy on 10 August 1792, the Convention included 749 deputies drawn from businesses and trades, and from such professions as law, journalism, medicine, and the clergy. Among its earliest acts was the formal abolition of the monarchy, through Proclamation, on 21 September, and the subsequent establishment of the Republic on 22 September. The French Republican Calendar discarded all Christian reference points and calculated time from the Republic's first full day after the monarchy \u2013 22 September 1792, the first day of Year One.[8][9]\n\n\nAccording to its own rules, the Convention elected its President every fortnight (two weeks). He was eligible for re-election after the lapse of a fortnight. Ordinarily the sessions were held in the morning, but evening sessions also occurred frequently, often extending late into the night. In exceptional circumstances, the Convention declared itself in permanent session and sat for several days without interruption. For both legislative and administrative deliberations, the Convention used committees, with powers more or less widely extended and regulated by successive laws.[10] The most famous of these committees included the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security.[9]\n\n\nThe Convention held both legislative and executive powers during the first years of the French First Republic and had three distinct periods: Girondins (moderate), Montagnard (radical) and Thermidorian (reaction). The Montagnards favored granting the poorer classes more political power; the Girondins favored a bourgeois republic and wanted to reduce the power and influence of Paris over the course of the revolution. A popular uprising in Paris helped to purge the Convention of the Girondins between 31 May and 2 June 1793;[9] the last of the Girondins served as presidents in late July.[11]\n\n\nIn its second phase, the Montagnards controlled the convention (June 1793 to July 1794). War and an internal rebellion convinced the revolutionary government to establish a Committee of Public Safety which exercised near dictatorial power. Consequently, the democratic constitution, approved by the convention on 24 June 1793, did not go into effect and the Convention lost its legislative initiative.[9] The rise of Mountaineers (Montagnards) corresponded with the decline of the Girondins. The Girondin party had hesitated on the correct course of action to take with Louis XVI after his attempt to flee France on 20 June 1791. Some elements of the Girondin party believed they could use the king as figurehead. While the Girondins hesitated, the Montagnards took a united stand during the trial in December 1792 \u2013 January 1793 and favored the king's execution.[12] Riding on this victory, the Montagnards then sought to discredit the Girondins using tactics previously used against themselves, denouncing the Girondins as liars and enemies of the Revolution.[13] The last quarter of the year was marked by the Reign of Terror (5 September 1793 \u2013 28 July 1794),[14] also known as The Terror (French: *la Terreur*), a period of violence incited by conflict between these rival political factions, the Girondins and the Jacobins, and marked by mass executions of \"enemies of the revolution\". The death toll ranged in the tens of thousands, with 16,594 executed by guillotine (2,639 in Paris),[13] and another 25,000 in summary executions across France.[15] Most of the Parisian victims of the guillotine filled the Madeleine, Mosseaux (also called Errancis), and Picpus cemeteries.[16]\n\n\nIn the third phase, called Thermidor after the month in which it began, many of the members of the Convention overthrew the most prominent member of the committee, Maximilien Robespierre. This reaction to the radical influence of the Committee of Public Safety reestablished the balance of power in the hands of the moderate deputies. The Girondins who had survived the 1793 purge were recalled and the leading Montagnards were themselves purged, and many executed. In August 1795, the Convention approved the Constitution for the regime that replaced it, the bourgeois-dominated Directory, which exercised power from 1795 to 1799, when a coup d'etat by Napoleon Bonaparte overthrew it.[9]\n\n\n\n### Moderate Phase: September 1792 \u2013 June 1793[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Girondin and The Plain\n\nInitially, *La Marais*, or The Plain, a moderate, amorphous group, controlled the Convention. At the first session, held on 20 September 1792, the elder statesman Philippe R\u00fchl presided over the session. The following day, amidst profound silence, the proposition was put to the assembly, \"*That royalty be abolished in France*\"; it carried, with cheers. On the 22nd came the news of the Republic's victory at the Battle of Valmy. On the same day, the Convention decreed that \"in future, the acts of the assembly shall be dated *First Year of the French Republic*\". Three days later, the Convention added the corollary of \"*the French republic is one and indivisible*\", to guard against federalism.[17]\n\n\nThe following men were elected for two-week terms as Presidents, or executives, of the Convention.[18]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Image\n | Dates\n | Name\n | Fate\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | 20 September 1792 | Philippe R\u00fchl | Suicide, 29/30 May 1795\n |\n| ![](image) | 20 September 1792 \u00a0\u2013 4 October 1792 | J\u00e9r\u00f4me P\u00e9tion de Villeneuve | Botched suicide, guillotined 18 June 1794\n |\n| ![](image) | 4 October 1792 \u00a0\u2013 18 October 1792 | Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Delacroix | Guillotined with Georges Danton, 5 April 1794\n |\n| ![](image) | 18 October 1792 \u00a0\u2013 1 November 1792 | Marguerite-\u00c9lie Guadet | Guillotined 17 June 1794\n |\n| ![](image) | 1 November 1792 \u00a0\u2013 15 November 1792 | Marie-Jean H\u00e9rault de S\u00e9chelles | Guillotined with Georges Danton, 5 April 1794\n |\n| ![](image) | 15 November 1792 \u00a0\u2013 29 November 1792 | Henri Gr\u00e9goire | Died 28 May 1831\n |\n| ![](image) | 29 November 1792 \u2013 13 December 1792 | Bertrand Bar\u00e8re de Vieuzac | Died 13 January 1841\n |\n| ![portrait of Jacques defermon](image) | 13 December 1792 \u00a0\u2013 27 December 1792 | Jacques Defermon des Chapelieres | 20 June 1831\n |\n| ![](image) | 27 December 1792 \u00a0\u2013 10 January 1793 | Jean-Baptiste Treilhard | Died 1 December 1810\n |\n| ![](image) | 10 January 1793 \u00a0\u2013 24 January 1793 | Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud | 31 October 1793, guillotined.\n |\n| ![](image) | 24 January 1793 \u00a0\u2013 7 February 1793 | Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-\u00c9tienne | 5 December 1793, guillotined\n |\n| ![](image) | 7 February 1793 \u00a0\u2013 21 February 1793 | Jean-Jacques Br\u00e9ard, dit Br\u00e9ard-Duplessis\n | 2 January 1840\n |\n| ![](image) | 21 February 1793 \u00a0\u2013 7 March 1793 | Edmond Louis Alexis Dubois-Cranc\u00e9 | 29 June 1814\n |\n| ![](image) | 7 March 1793 \u00a0\u2013 21 March 1793 | Armand Gensonn\u00e9 | 31 October 1793, guillotined\n |\n| ![](image) | 21 March 1793 \u00a0\u2013 4 April 1793 | Jean Antoine Joseph Debry | 6 January 1834, Paris\n |\n|  | 4 April 1793 \u00a0\u2013 18 April 1793 | Jean-Fran\u00e7ois-Bertrand Delmas | Disappeared 19 August 1798[Notes 1] |\n|  | 18 April 1793 \u00a0\u2013 2 May 1793 | Marc David Alba Lasource | 31 October 1793, guillotined with the Girondists\n |\n| ![](image) | 2 May 1793 \u00a0\u2013 16 May 1793 | Jean-Baptiste Boyer-Fonfr\u00e8de | 31 October 1793, guillotined\n |\n| ![](image) | 16 May 1793 \u00a0\u2013 30 May 1793 | Maximin Isnard | 12 March 1825\n |\n|  | 30 May 1793 \u00a0\u2013 13 June 1793 | Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9-Auguste Mallarm\u00e9 | 25 July 1835\n |\n\n\nAt the end of May 1793, an uprising of the Parisian *sans culottes*, the day-laborers and working class, undermined much of the authority of the moderate Girondins.[19] At this point, although Danton and H\u00e9rault de S\u00e9chelles both served one more term each as Presidents of the Convention, the Girondins had lost control of the Convention: in June and July compromise after compromise changed the course of the revolution from a bourgeois event to a radical, working class event. Price controls were introduced and a minimum wage guaranteed to workers and soldiers. Over the course of the summer, the government became truly revolutionary.[20]\n\n\n\n### Radical phase: June 1793 \u2013 July 1794[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Insurrection of 31 May \u2013 2 June 1793 and Reign of Terror\n\nAfter the insurrection, any attempted resistance to revolutionary ideals was crushed. The insurrection of 31 May \u2013 2 June 1793 marked a significant milestone in the history of the French Revolution. The days of 31 May \u2013 2 June (French: *journ\u00e9es*) resulted in the fall of the Girondin party under pressure of the Parisian *sans-culottes*, Jacobins of the clubs, and Montagnards in the National Convention. The following men were elected as presidents of the Convention during its transition from its moderate to radical phase.[11]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Dates\n | Name\n | Death\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | 13 June 1793 \u00a0\u2013 27 June 1793 | Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois | 8 June 1796, deported to French Guiana, died of yellow fever |\n|  | 27 June 1793 \u00a0\u2013 11 July 1793 | Jacques Alexis Thuriot de la Rosi\u00e8re | 20 June 1829, died in exile\n |\n| ![](image) | 11 July 1793 \u00a0\u2013 25 July 1793 | Andre Jeanbon Saint Andre | 10 December 1813\n |\n| ![](image) | 25 July 1793 \u00a0\u2013 8 August 1793 | Georges Jacques Danton | A moderate guillotined by the radicals, 5 April 1794\n |\n| ![](image) | 8 August 1793 \u00a0\u2013 22 August 1793 | Marie-Jean H\u00e9rault de S\u00e9chelles | Guillotined with Georges Danton, 5 April 1794\n |\n\n\n*After 1793, President of the National Convention became a puppet office under the Committee of Public Safety*\nThe following men were elected as presidents of the Convention during its radical phase.[11]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Dates\n | Name\n | Death\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | 22 August 1793 \u00a0\u2013 5 September 1793 | Maximilien Robespierre | 28 July 1794, guillotined during the Reaction\n |\n| File:Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne engraving.jpg | 5 September 1793 \u00a0\u2013 19 September 1793 | Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne | 3 June 1819\n |\n| ![](image) | 19 September 1793 \u00a0\u2013 3 October 1793 | Pierre Joseph Cambon | 15 February 1820\n |\n|  | 3 October 1793 \u00a0\u2013 22 October 1793 | Louis-Joseph Charlier | 23 February 1797\n |\n|  | 22 October 1793 \u00a0\u2013 6 November 1793 | Mo\u00efse Antoine Pierre Jean Bayle | 1812 or 1815\n |\n|  | 6 November 1793 \u00a0\u2013 21 November 1793 | Pierre-Antoine Lalloy | 16 March 1846\n |\n| ![](image) | 21 November 1793 \u00a0\u2013 6 December 1793 | Charles-Gilbert Romme | 17 June 1795, suicide prior to guillotine\n |\n|  | 6 December 1793 \u00a0\u2013 21 December 1793 | Jean-Henri Voulland | 23 February 1801\n |\n| ![](image) | 21 December 1793 \u2013 5 January 1794 | Georges Auguste Couthon | 28 July 1794, guillotined during the ReactionOne of the few members of *La Marais* to be elected President\n |\n| ![](image) | 5 January 1794 \u00a0\u2013 20 January 1794 | Jacques-Louis David | 29 December 1825\n |\n| ![](image) | 20 January 1794 \u00a0\u2013 4 February 1794 | Marc Guillaume Alexis Vadier | 14 December 1828\n |\n|  | 4 February 1794 \u00a0\u2013 19 February 1794 | Joseph-Nicolas Barbeau du Barran | 16 May 1816, exiled in Switzerland during Bourbon Restoration |\n| ![](image) | 19 February 1794 \u00a0\u2013 6 March 1794 | Louis Antoine de Saint-Just | 28 July 1794, guillotine during Reaction\n |\n|  | 7 March 1794 \u00a0\u2013 21 March 1794 | Philippe R\u00fchl | 29/30 May 1795, suicide\n |\n| ![](image) | 21 March 1794 \u00a0\u2013 5 April 1794 | Jean-Lambert Tallien | 16 November 1820\n |\n|  | 5 April 1794 \u00a0\u2013 20 April 1794 | Jean-Baptiste-Andr\u00e9 Amar | 21 December 1816\n |\n| ![](image) | 20 April 1794 \u00a0\u2013 5 May 1794 | Robert Lindet | 17 February 1825\n |\n| ![](image) | 5 May 1794 \u00a0\u2013 20 May 1794 | Lazare Carnot | 2 August 1823\n |\n| ![](image) | 20 May 1794 \u00a0\u2013 4 June 1794 | Claude-Antoine Prieur-Duvernois | 11 August 1832\n |\n| ![](image) | 4 June 1794 \u00a0\u2013 19 June 1794 | Maximilien Robespierre | 28 July 1794, guillotined during the Reaction\n |\n|  | 19 June 1794 \u00a0\u2013 5 July 1794 | \u00c9lie Lacoste | 26 November 1806\n |\n|  | 5 July 1794 \u00a0\u2013 19 July 1794 | Jean-Antoine Louis, also called Louis du Bas-Rhin\n |  |\n\n\n### Reaction: July 1794\u20131795[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Mountain and Thermidorian Reaction\n\nIn 1794, Maximilien Robespierre continued to consolidate his power over the Montagnards with the use of the Committee of Public Safety.[21] By late spring, the moderate members of the Convention had had enough. They began to conspire secretly against Robespierre and his allies. The Thermidorian Reaction was a revolt within the Convention against the leadership of the Jacobin Club over the Committee of Public Safety. The National Convention voted to remove Maximilien Robespierre, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, and several other leading members of the revolutionary government, and they were executed the following day.

Administered by a collective leadership of five directors, it preceded the Consulate established in a coup d'etat by Napoleon. It lasted from 2 November 1795 until 10 November 1799, a period commonly known as the \"Directory era\". The directory operated with a bicameral structure. A Council of the Ancients, selected by lot, named the directors. For its own security, the Left (whose members dominated the Council) resolved that all five must be old members of the Convention and regicides who had voted to execute King Louis XVI. The Ancients chose Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rewbell; Paul Fran\u00e7ois Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras; Louis Marie de La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux; Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot; and \u00c9tienne-Fran\u00e7ois Le Tourneur.[11]\n\n\nThe Directory was officially led by a president, as stipulated by Article 141 of the Constitution of the Year III. An entirely ceremonial post, the first president was Rewbell who was chosen by lot on 2 November 1795. The directors conducted their elections privately, with the presidency rotating every three months.[26] The last president was Gohier.[27]\n\n\nThe key figure of the Directory was Paul Barras, the only Director to serve throughout the Directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Directors of the Directory (1 November 1795 \u2013 10 November 1799)** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Paul Barras | ![](image)Louis-Marie de La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux | ![](image)Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rewbell | ![](image)Lazare Carnot | ![](image)\u00c9tienne-Fran\u00e7ois Letourneur |\n| Letourneur drawn by lot to be replaced1 Prairial year V (20 May 1797). |\n| ![](image)Fran\u00e7ois Barth\u00e9lemy |\n| Barth\u00e9lemy & Carnot proscribed and replaced afterCoup of 18 Fructidor year V (4 Sept. 1797). |\n| ![](image)Philippe-Antoine Merlin de Douai | ![](image)Fran\u00e7ois de Neufch\u00e2teau |\n| Neufch\u00e2teau drawn by lot to be replaced26 Flor\u00e9al year VI (15 May 1798). |\n| ![](image)Jean-Baptiste Treilhard |\n| Rewbell drawn by lot to be replaced27 Flor\u00e9al year VII (16 May 1799). |\n| ![](image)Emmanuel-Joseph Siey\u00e8s |\n| Compelled to resign,30 Prairial year VII (18 June 1799). | Compelled to resign,30 Prairial year VII (18 June 1799). | Treilhard's election annulled as irregular,29 Prairial year VII (17 June 1799). |\n| ![](image)Roger Ducos | Jean-Fran\u00e7ois-Auguste Moulin | ![](image)Louis-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Gohier |\n| After the Coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799), Barras, Ducos & Siey\u00e8s resigned.Moulin & Gohier, refusing to resign, were arrested by General Moreau. |\n\n\n#### The Consulate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French Consulate\n\n\n\n| **The provisional Consuls (10 November \u2013 12 December 1799)** |\n| --- |\n| With the Coup of 18 Brumaire in 1799, the Directory was abolished, and a provisional committee of three Consuls took power. |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Napoleon Bonaparte | Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s | Roger Ducos |\n| **The Consuls (12 December 1799 \u2013 18 May 1804)** |\n| With the Constitution of the Year VIII (December 1799), Bonaparte became First Consul for ten years, with two consuls appointed by him who had consultative voices only.With the Constitution of the Year X (August 1802), Bonaparte became First Consul for life, establishing a *de facto* dictatorship. |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Napoleon BonaparteFirst Consul\n | J.J.R. de Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8sSecond Consul\n | Charles-Fran\u00e7ois LebrunThird Consul\n |\n| Napoleon took the title Emperor of the French on 18 May 1804, ending the Consulate and establishing the First French Empire. |\n\n\n## House of Bonaparte, First Empire (1804\u20131814)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: House of Bonaparte and First French Empire\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Napoleon I, *the Great*(Napol\u00e9on Ier, le Grand) | 18 May 1804 | 11 April 1814[2] | Emperor of the French (Empereur des Fran\u00e7ais) |\n\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte became Emperor in 1804 following a referendum. He received the title Emperor of the French to differentiate himself from the previous monarchs. His rule saw the domination of France as it crushed the Prussians, Russians, Austrians and British alike. Napoleon's rule lasted from 1804 to 1814 when after many coalitions against him he was defeated by the combined might of the other powers of Europe. He would then be exiled to the Island of Elba off the coast of Italy. However he was given the island to run as the Emperor of Elba.\n\n\n\n## Capetian Dynasty (1814\u20131815)[edit]\n\n\n### House of Bourbon, Bourbon Restoration (1814\u20131815)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bourbon Restoration in France\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Relationship with his predecessors\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis XVIII | 11 April 1814 | 20 March 1815 | \u00a0\u2022 Grandson of Louis XV \u00a0\u2022 Younger brother of Louis XVI[2] | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n\n\n## House of Bonaparte, First Empire (Hundred Days, 1815)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hundred Days\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Relationship with his predecessor\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Napoleon I (Napol\u00e9on Ier) | 20 March 1815 | 22 June 1815[2] | *None* | Emperor of the French (Empereur des Fran\u00e7ais) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Napoleon II(Napol\u00e9on II) [n 1] | 22 June 1815 | 7 July 1815\n | \u00a0\u2022 Son of Napoleon I\n | Emperor of the French (Empereur des Fran\u00e7ais) |\n\n\n## Capetian Dynasty (1815\u20131848)[edit]\n\n\n### House of Bourbon (1815\u20131830)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Relationship with his predecessor\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis XVIII | 7 July 1815 | 16 September 1824[2] | \u00a0\u2022 Grandson of Louis XV \u00a0\u2022 Younger brother of Louis XVI\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Charles X | 16 September 1824 | 2 August 1830 | \u00a0\u2022 Grandson of Louis XV \u00a0\u2022 Younger Brother of Louis XVI and Louis XVIII\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n\n\n### Revolution of 1830[edit]\n\n\nFor a few days during the July Revolution, Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette held executive power and was offered the presidency of a Republic.

Easily elected president in the 1958 election by electoral college, he took office the following month; he was re-elected by universal suffrage in the 1965 election. In 1966, he withdrew France from NATO integrated military command, and expelled the American bases on French soil.

Narrowly elected in the 1974 election, he instigated numerous reforms, including the lowering of the age of civil majority from 21 to 18, and the legalisation of abortion. He soon faced a global economic crisis and rising unemployment. Although the polls initially gave him a lead, he was defeated in the 1981 election by Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, partly due to the disunion within the right wing. |\n| 21\n | ![](image) | **Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand**(1916\u20131996) | 21 May 1981 | 17 May 1995\n | Socialist Party (PS)\n | [49] |\n| 1981, 1988 |\n| Candidate of a united left-wing ticket in the 1965 election, he founded the Socialist Party in 1971.

After the right-wing victory in the 1986 legislative elections, he named Jacques Chirac Prime Minister, thus beginning the first cohabitation. Re-elected in the 1988 election against Chirac, he was again forced to cohabit with \u00c9douard Balladur following the 1993 legislative elections. He retired in 1995 after the conclusion of his second term. He was the first president elected twice by universal suffrage, he was the first left-wing President of the Fifth Republic, and his presidential tenure was the longest of the Fifth Republic. |\n| 22\n | ![](image) | **Jacques Chirac**(1932\u20132019) | 17 May 1995 | 16 May 2007\n | Rally for the Republic (RPR) until 2002Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) from 2002\n | [50] |\n| 1995, 2002 |\n| Prime Minister (1974\u20131976); on resignation, founded the RPR.

He engaged in social reforms to counter \"social fracture\". In 1997, he dissolved the Assembl\u00e9e nationale; a left-wing victory in the 1997 legislative elections, forced him to name Lionel Jospin Prime Minister for a five-year cohabitation. Presidential terms reduced from seven to five years. In 2002, he was re-elected against the leader of the extreme right-wing Jean-Marie Le Pen. Opposed the Iraq War.

Unionists recognized the Orl\u00e9anist claimant after 1883.\n* Legitimist-Anjou claimants to the throne of France: descendants of Louis XIV, claiming precedence over the House of Orl\u00e9ans by virtue of primogeniture\n* Orl\u00e9anist claimants to the throne of France: descendants of Louis-Phillippe, himself descended from a junior line of the Bourbon dynasty, rejecting all heads of state since 1848.\n* Bonapartist claimants to the throne of France: descendants of Napoleon I and his brothers, rejecting all heads of state 1815\u201348, and since 1870.\n* English claimants to the throne of France: Kings of England and later, of Great Britain (renounced by Hanoverian King George III upon union with Ireland)\n* Jacobite claimants to the throne of France: senior heirs-general of King Edward III of England and thus his claim to the French throne, also claiming England, Scotland, and Ireland.\n\n\n## Timeline[edit]\n\n\n### 509 - 1795[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n### 1792 - *Present*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of French monarchs\n* List of presidents of the National Convention\n* List of presidents of France\n* Ministers of the French National Convention\n* Representative on mission\n* Full list of members of the Convention per department: List of members of the National Convention by Department (French)\n* List of foreign ministers of France\n* List of prime ministers of France\n* President of France\n* British claims to the French throne\n* Kings of France family tree\n* Style of the French sovereign\n\n\n## Notes, citations and sources[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** From 22 June to 7 July 1815, Bonapartists considered Napoleon II as the legitimate heir to the throne, his father having abdicated in his favor. However, throughout this period he resided in Austria, with his mother. Louis XVIII was reinstalled as king on 7 July\n1. **^** From 9 Apr 1793 to 18 Apr 1793 the functions of president were exercised by vice-president Jacques-Alexis Thuriot de la Rosi\u00e8re. He was elected president in his own right for the fortnight 27 June 1793 \u00a0\u2013 11 July 1793\n2. **^** The name *Thermidorian* refers to 9 Thermidor Year II (27 July 1794), the date according to the French Revolutionary Calendar when Robespierre and other radical revolutionaries came under concerted attack in the National Convention. *Thermidorian Reaction* also refers to the remaining period until the National Convention was superseded by the Directory; this is also sometimes called the era of the Thermidorian Convention. Prominent figures of Thermidor include Paul Barras, Jean-Lambert Tallien, and Joseph Fouch\u00e9.

The Prussian-led North German Confederation (1866-1871) subsequently morphed into a modern nation state, the German Reich, which was ruled by emperors from 1871 to the collapse of all German monarchies in 1918.\n\n\nThe President of Germany replaced the monarch in 1919. Chancellor Adolf Hitler assumed the duties of head of state as *F\u00fchrer and Chancellor* from 1934 until his suicide in April 1945. In 1949, Germany was divided into two states. The Federal President, head of state of West Germany, became head of state for all of Germany following German reunification in 1990.\n\n\n\n### East Frankish kingdom, 843\u2013962[edit]\n\n\n#### Carolingians[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Seal/Portrait\n | Name\n | House\n | King\n | Emperor\n | Ended\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Louis the GermanLudwig der Deutsche | Carolingian | 11 August 843\n | \u2014\n | 23 August 876\n | Son of Emperor Louis the Pious and grandson of Charlemagne |\n| ![](image) | Carloman(Karlmann) | Carolingian | 28 August\n876\n | \u2014\n | 22 March 880\n | Son of Louis the German; ruled in Bavaria; from 877, also King of Italy\n |\n| ![](image) | Louis the Younger(Ludwig III. der J\u00fcngere) | Carolingian | 28 August 876\n | \u2014\n | 20 January 882\n | Son of Louis the German; ruled in East Francia, Saxony; from 880, also Bavaria |\n| ![](image) | **Charles the Fat**(Karl III. der Dicke) | Carolingian | 28 August 876\n | 12 February 881\n | 11 November 887\n | Son of Louis the German; ruled in Alemannia, Raetia, from 882 in the entire Eastern Kingdom; from 879, also King of Italy\n |\n| ![](image) | **Arnulf of Carinthia**(Arnulf von K\u00e4rnten) | Carolingian | 30 November 887\n | 25 April 896\n | 8 December 899\n | Illegitimate son of Carloman\n |\n| ![](image) | Louis the Child(Ludwig IV. das Kind) | Carolingian | 21 January 900\n | \u2014\n | 20/24 September 911\n | Son of Arnulf of Carinthia\n |\n\n\n#### Conradine dynasty[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Seal\n | Name\n | House\n | King\n | Emperor\n | Ended\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Conrad I(Konrad I.) | Conradine (Franconian) | 10 November 911\n | \u2014\n | 23 December 918\n | Elected by the nobility\n |\n\n\n#### Ottonian dynasty[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Seal\n | Name\n | House\n | King\n | Emperor\n | Ended\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Henry I the Fowler(Heinrich I. der Vogler) | Liudolfing (Saxon) | 23 April 919\n | \u2014\n | 2 July 936\n | Elected by the nobility\n |\n| ![](image) | *Arnulf the Bad*(Arnulf der B\u00f6se, Herzog von Bayern) | Luitpolding (Bavarian) | 919\n | \u2014\n | 921\n | Rival king to Henry I\n |\n\n\n### Holy Roman Empire, 962\u20131806[edit]\n\n\nThe title \"King of the Romans\", used under the Holy Roman Empire, is (from this point onwards) considered equivalent to King of Germany.

The first to take the title was Odoacer, a barbarian military leader, in the late 5th century, followed by the Ostrogothic kings up to the mid-6th century. With the Frankish conquest of Italy in the 8th century, the Carolingians assumed the title, which was maintained by subsequent Holy Roman Emperors throughout the Middle Ages. The last Emperor to claim the title was Charles V in the 16th century. During this period, the holders of the title were crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy.\n\n\nFrom the unification of Italy in 1861 to 1946 the head of state was the King of Italy, who was the same person as the King of Sardinia according to the Constitution. Italy became a republic under the Constitution of 1948 and the monarch was replaced by a President.\n\n\n\n\n## Monarchs[edit]\n\n\n### As \"Rex Italiae\"[edit]\n\n\n* Odoacer (476\u2013493)\n\n\nvassal of the Eastern Roman Empire.\n### Ostrogothic Kingdom (493 \u2013 553)[edit]\n\n\n* Theoderic the Great (493 \u2013 526)\n* Athalaric (526 \u2013 534)\n* Theodahad (534 \u2013 536)\n* Witiges (536 \u2013 540)\n* Ildibad (540 \u2013 541)\n* Eraric (541)\n* Totila (541 \u2013 552)\n* Teia (552 \u2013 553)\n\n\n### Kingdom of the Lombards (568 \u2013 814)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of kings of the Lombards\n\n* Alboin (568 \u2013 572)\n* Cleph (572 \u2013 574)\n* *Rule of the dukes* (ten-year interregnum)\n* Authari (584 \u2013 590)\n* Agilulf (591 \u2013 c. 616)\n* Adaloald (c. 616 \u2013 c. 626)\n* Arioald (c. 626 \u2013 636)\n* Rothari (636 \u2013 652)\n* Rodoald (652 \u2013 653)\n* Aripert I (653 \u2013 661)\n* Perctarit and Godepert (661 \u2013 662)\n* Grimoald (662 \u2013 671)\n* Perctarit (671 \u2013 688), restored from exile\n* Alahis (688 \u2013 689), rebel\n* Cunincpert (688 \u2013 700)\n* Liutpert (700 \u2013 701)\n* Raginpert (701)\n* Aripert II (701 \u2013 712)\n* Ansprand (712)\n* Liutprand (712 \u2013 744)\n* Hildeprand (744)\n* Ratchis (744 \u2013 749)\n* Aistulf (749 \u2013 756)\n* Desiderius (756 \u2013 774)\n* Charlemagne (774 \u2013 814)\n\n\n### Kingdom of Italy (781 \u2013 962)[edit]\n\n\n#### Carolingian dynasty (781 \u2013 888)[edit]\n\n\n* Pippin (781 \u2013 810)\n* Bernard (810 \u2013 818)\n* Louis I (818 \u2013 822)\n* Lothair I (822 \u2013 855)\n* Louis II (844 \u2013 875)\n* Charles II the Bald (875 \u2013 877)\n* Carloman (877 \u2013 879)\n* Charles III the Fat (879 \u2013 887)\n\n\n#### Instability (888 \u2013 962)[edit]\n\n\nAfter 887, Italy fell into instability, with many rulers claiming the kingship simultaneously:\n\n\n\n* Berengar I (888 \u2013 896)\n\n\nvassal of the German King Arnulf of Carinthia, reduced to Friuli 889-894, deposed by Arnulf in 896.\n* Guy of Spoleto (889 \u2013 894)\n\n\nopponent of Berengar, ruled most of Italy but was deposed by Arnulf.\n* Lambert of Spoleto (891 \u2013 896)\n\n\nsubking of his father Guy before 894, reduced to Spoleto 894\u2013895.\n* Arnulf of Carinthia (894 \u2013 899)[1]\n\t+ Ratold (sub-king 896)\n\n\nIn 896, Arnulf and Ratold lost control of Italy, which was divided between Berengar and Lambert:\n\n\n\n* Berengar I (896 \u2013 924)\n\n\nseized Lambert's portion upon the latter's death in 898.\n* Lambert of Spoleto (896 \u2013 898)\n* Louis III of Provence (900-905)\n\n\nopposed Berengar 900-902 and 905.\n* Rudolph II of Burgundy (922 \u2013 933)\n\n\ndefeated Berengar but fled Italy in 926.\n* Hugh of Arles (926 \u2013 947)\n\n\nelected by Berengar's partisans in 925, resigned to Provence after 945.\n* Lothair II of Arles (945 \u2013 950)\n* Berengar II of Ivrea (950 \u2013 961)\n\n\njointly with his son:\n* Adalbert of Ivrea (950 \u2013 961)\n\n\nIn 951 Otto I of Germany invaded Italy and was crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy.

The political importance of the Crown has decreased over time, whereas the position of prime minister has gradually become more important.\n\n\nAlexander De Croo, a member of the Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats and son of prominent politician, Herman, was appointed as new prime minister on 1 October 2020. He succeeded Sophie Wilm\u00e8s.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSince the independence of Belgium in 1830, governments have been designated with the name of the minister who formed the government as formateur, but that position did not have a specific status. Originally, from 1831 the king of the Belgians presided over the Council of Ministers, but when he was absent, the presidency was taken by the *chef de cabinet* (head of Cabinet), usually the oldest or most influential minister. This position gradually became more prominent, and the minister with this title then soon acquired the competency to present the king with the proposed allocation of the various ministerial departments among the ministers.\n\n\nWith the expansion of voting rights after World War I, more political parties started to win seats in parliament\u2014especially the Belgian Socialist Party\u2014and this made it impossible to achieve an absolute majority in parliament. Since then, coalition governments have been necessary, which has made the task of forming a government by the appointed formateur more difficult. Consequently, the formateur increasingly gained greater respect, and much prestige. Thus the formateur became prominent as a position of leadership. As the ministers of the government now represented various political parties, there was a need for someone to coordinate the proceedings of the various ministers. The prime minister was now asserted as the actual head of government, and this is how the office of prime minister came into existence.\n\n\nGradually, the head of Cabinet replaced the king more often during the first half of the twentieth century, and as such gained importance within government. As the Constitution requires the king to exercise his powers through the ministers, the prime minister became reckoned as the country's most important political figure and *de facto* chief executive. Nevertheless, given his newly acquired prominence, as a member of the Cabinet the head of Cabinet continued to lead a ministerial department.\n\n\nThe title of *Prime Minister* or *Premier* was used for the first time in 1918 in official documents and it is at this time that the position was assigned to its own cabinet. Only in 1970 the title was incorporated in the Belgian Constitution with the first state reform.\n\n\n\n## Function[edit]\n\n\nBesides coordinating government policies, the prime minister is responsible for the proper execution of the coalition agreement. The prime minister also presides at meetings of the Council of Ministers and manages conflicts of competencies between the ministers. In addition, the prime minister represents the government coalition in public, both at home and abroad. It is the prime minister who maintains contact with the king and presents the government policy statement in the Parliament. The prime minister can also ask Parliament for a vote of confidence, which can even lead to the government's resignation in the case of a constructive vote of no confidence. Unless the prime minister resigns because of a personal matter, the whole government resigns with the prime minister's resignation. The prime minister also represents Belgium in the various international organisations, alongside the minister of foreign affairs. Due to the state reform, the prime minister acquired a number of additional tasks, such as keeping in check the relations between the different regions and communities of the country, and presiding at the deliberative committee that consists of the governmental representatives of all the federal entities.\n\n\nIt is expected, though not required, that the prime minister be fluent in both French and Dutch.\n\n\n\n## Appointment[edit]\n\n\nThe day after the federal elections, the incumbent prime minister offers the resignation of his government to the king. The king then asks the resigning government to continue as a caretaker government until a new government is formed. The king then consults a number of prominent politicians in order to ascertain the different possibilities of forming a government. He usually consults the presidents of the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate, the most important political parties, and other people of political and socio-economic importance. After the consultations, the king appoints an *informateur* who is in charge of collecting information from the different political parties about their demands for formation of a new government. After these consultations, the *informateur* reports to the king so that the king can find a suitable *formateur*, who is responsible for forming the government. Usually, it is the *formateur* of the federal government who then becomes prime minister.[3]\n\n\nIt usually takes several months of negotiations before the *formateur* is ready to accept a formal royal invitation to form a government. Per the Constitution, the king's acts are only valid with the countersignature of a minister. For this reason, the outgoing prime minister countersigns the Act of Appointment of the new prime minister, and the new prime minister countersigns the Act of Resignation of the resigning prime minister. The king then appoints the other ministers and secretaries of state of the federal government, and their Acts of Appointment are countersigned by the prime minister.\n\n\n\n## Official office[edit]\n\n\nThe official office of the prime minister is located at 16 Rue de la Loi (Wetstraat in Dutch, or \"Law Street\" in translation) among many notable Belgian government and European Union buildings in the centre of Brussels and around Brussels Park. The residence includes the Belgian Federal Cabinet, the Chancellery and the Council of Ministers. It functions as the nerve center of Belgian politics. The building was originally erected as the so-called \"Refuge House\" by the Saint Gertrude Abbey of Leuven. It was designed by the Belgian-Austrian architect Louis Joseph Montoyer.[4] At the time of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815\u20131830), the building was planned to be used as the location for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.[5] In 1830 it was purchased by Prince Eug\u00e8ne of Ligne,[6] and from 1944, the building became state property, after which it was furnished to function as a meeting place for the prime minister and his cabinet.\n\n\n\n* ![The office of the Belgian prime minister](image)\n\nThe office of the Belgian prime minister\n* ![The entrance](image)\n\nThe entrance\n* ![The building (centre of picture)](image)\n\nThe building (centre of picture)\n* ![The doorbell](image)\n\nThe doorbell\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Belgian monarchs\n* List of prime ministers of Belgium\n* List of Belgian prime ministers by political affiliation\n* List of Belgian prime ministers by time in office\n* Lifespan timeline of prime ministers of Belgium\n* Minister-President of the Brussels Capital-Region\n* Minister-President of Flanders\n* Minister-President of the French Community\n* Minister-President of the German-speaking Community\n* Minister-President of Wallonia\n* History of Belgium\n* Royal Question\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Heads of State, Heads of Government, Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Protocol and Liaison Service, United Nations.

In his role as head of government, the prime minister also represents the Netherlands in the European Council.\n\n\nThe current acting prime minister, Mark Rutte, has been in the position since 14 October 2010, with his fourth cabinet being inaugurated on 10 January 2022.[5] He has since resigned his position on 7 July 2023 and now serves in a demissionary capacity.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nGradually the prime minister became an official function of government leader, taken by the political leader of the largest party. Since 1845, the role of the first minister is relevant. In that year the Constitution of the Netherlands was amended to make ministers responsible to the States General and no longer responsible to the king, who acted as the leader of cabinet. Until 1901, the position chair of the Council of Ministers officially rotated between ministers. Between 1901 and 1945, the position formally still rotated, but prominent politicians could claim a rotation period of four years.\n\n\nIn 1937, a separate Ministry of General Affairs was instituted, which was informally linked to the prime minister. Barend Biesheuvel (1971\u20131974) was the last prime minister who was not the political leader of the largest party in cabinet; his was actually the third largest. In 1983 the function of prime minister was laid down in the constitution.\n\n\nThe position of the prime minister has been reinforced by the creation of the European Council.[6] In November 2006, the rules of procedure of the council of ministers was changed to allow the prime minister to put any item on the agenda of the council and no longer have to wait for a minister to take the initiative.[7] A change of the rules of procedure of the cabinet in July 2008 allowed the prime minister to manage costs of the Royal House across departments, to make one department in control of cost of the Royal House which are covered by several ministries.[8]\n\n\n\n## Role[edit]\n\n\nAlthough the prime minister is the leading Dutch political figure and holder of the *de facto* highest office, they are not as powerful as the British prime minister and the German chancellor. This is mainly because, historically, all Dutch ministers used to be responsible to the monarch (also true of prime ministers in other countries); ministers took turns to fill the position of prime minister, and in the role had little if any control over the other ministers. The prime minister's role gained importance when ministers became responsible to the parliament, and the position became mostly reserved for the leader of the biggest political party in the House of Representatives. Still, because the position holds limited powers compared to its equivalent in other neighboring parliamentary democracies, the prime minister's role is described as *primus inter pares* (\"first among equals\").[4]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Ministry of General Affairs at the Binnenhof in The Hague. The office of the prime minister, \"Het Torentje\", is the centre-left octagonal tower.\nFollowing the constitutional review of 1983, the position of prime minister was formalised in the Dutch Constitution for the first time.[9] According to the Constitution of the Netherlands, the Government is constituted by the king and the ministers.[10] The Constitution stipulates that the prime minister chairs the Council of Ministers (article 45) and is appointed by royal decree (article 43). The royal decree of their own appointment and those of the other ministers are to be countersigned by the prime minister (article 48). The Council of Ministers is no longer attended by the king.\n\n\nThe prime minister chairs the weekly meetings of the Council of Ministers and has the power to set the agenda of these meetings. The prime minister is also Minister of General Affairs (*Minister van Algemene Zaken*), which takes an important role in coordinating policy and is responsible for the Government Information Service (Dutch: *Rijksvoorlichtingsdienst*).\n\n\nThe prime minister is also responsible for the royal house and has a weekly meeting with the king on government policy. Informally the prime minister functions as the \"face\" of the cabinet to the public. After the meetings of the cabinet on Friday, the prime minister hosts a press conference on the decisions of the cabinet and current affairs. The prime minister also has some functions in international affairs, attending the European Council every six months and maintaining bilateral contacts. The prime minister's office has since the 1980s been an octagonal tower, named \"The Little Tower\" (Torentje), in the Binnenhof in The Hague. The official residence (which is only used for official functions) is the Catshuis; the last prime minister to live in the Catshuis was Dries van Agt. Incumbent Mark Rutte lives in a flat in downtown The Hague. The prime minister has a security detail and which, in 2021, was increased amid fears of kidnapping.[11]\n\n\nAlthough prime ministers are almost always the political leader of their party and as such chosen as a member of the House of Representatives, they (and other ministers who were chosen as representative) are required to give up their seat for the duration of their tenure, as Dutch ministers are not allowed to be members of parliament.\n\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of the Politics series |\n| Politics of the Netherlands\n |\n| ![Azure, billetty Or a lion with a coronet Or armed and langued Gules holding in his dexter paw a sword Argent hilted Or and in the sinister paw seven arrows Argent pointed and bound together Or.

Hence, Dutch governments are always coalitions between two or more parties. Following the most recent elections, the House appointed a \"scout\" to seek advice on how to interpret the election results (a role coordinated by the monarch prior to 2012). On the basis of this advice, the House appoints an *informateur* to check on prospective coalitions and lead negotiations between potential partners. If successful, the House then appoints a *formateur,* who concludes the talks between the members of the prospective coalition. The *formateur* is almost always the leader of the largest party in the prospective coalition, and thus *de facto* prime minister-designate. Prior to 2012, the monarch had a considerable role in this proces in particular during the initial phases and the appointment of informateurs and formateurs. Reforms in 2012 pulled these tasks to the House of Representatives, thus largely eliminated royal influence on the process.\n\n\nIt usually takes several months of negotiations before a *formateur* is ready to accept a formal royal invitation to form a government. The monarch then appoints the ministers and state secretaries (junior ministers), who then resign their seats in the House or other job if appointed without being a representative.\n\n\nThe second largest coalition parties usually provides the senior Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands. If there are more parties in the coalition, generally they also each appoint one of their ministers to deputy prime ministers.[12]\n\n\n\n### Deputies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands\n\nThe king appoints deputy prime ministers. Conventionally, all of the junior partners in the coalition get one deputy prime minister; they are ranked according to the size of their respective parties. The senior deputy present chairs the cabinet meeting when the prime minister is not present. In the current Fourth Rutte cabinet, Sigrid Kaag chairs those meetings as first deputy prime minister of the Netherlands, with the other deputies being Wopke Hoekstra and Carola Schouten. The oldest member of the cabinet chairs the meeting when the prime minister and all deputies are absent.\n\n\n\n### Kingdom of the Netherlands[edit]\n\n\nThe prime minister is also chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and therefore also deals with matters affecting the other countries Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, and Sint Maarten in the kingdom. The independent cabinets of Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, and Sint Maarten also have their own prime ministers: Evelyn Wever-Croes (Prime Minister of Aruba), Gilmar Pisas (Prime Minister of Cura\u00e7ao), and Silveria Jacobs (Prime Minister of Sint Maarten). The Council of Ministers of the Kingdom of the Netherlands includes ministers plenipotentiary from the other countries of the kingdom. These are not included in the government of the kingdom.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of prime ministers of the Netherlands\n* Historical rankings of prime ministers of the Netherlands\n* List of prime ministers of the Netherlands by education\n* Religious affiliations of prime ministers of the Netherlands\n\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Salaris minister, staatssecretaris en bestuurders provincies en gemeenten\".
