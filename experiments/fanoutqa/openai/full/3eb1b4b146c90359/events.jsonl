It is officially known as the NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting. The draft was held April 23–24, 2005. The league also held a supplemental draft that year, which was held after the regular draft but before the regular season. The draft took place at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City,[1][2] and was televised for the 26th consecutive year on ESPN and ESPN2. It was the first to be held at the Javits Center after Madison Square Garden was utilized for previous drafts since 1995.[3]\n\n\nThe draft is best known for quarterback Aaron Rodgers falling to the 24th selection after being projected as one of the top picks.[4] Although Rodgers believed he would be taken first overall by the San Francisco 49ers, the 49ers selected quarterback Alex Smith and Rodgers was passed on by teams with other positional needs until he was drafted by the Green Bay Packers.[5][6][7] Rodgers' fall drew retrospective scrutiny due to developing a reputation as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.[8][9][10][11]\n\n\nCompensatory selections were distributed amongst fourteen teams, with the Philadelphia Eagles and the St. Louis Rams garnering the most with four picks each.[12] Three of the first five picks were running backs, an NFL draft first.[13]\n\n\nThe 255 players chosen in the draft were composed of:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * 36 Linebackers\n* 31 Wide receivers\n* 29 Cornerbacks\n* 26 Offensive tackles\n* 26 Running backs\n | * 20 Safeties\n* 20 Defensive ends\n* 15 Defensive tackles\n* 15 Offensive guards\n* 14 Quarterbacks\n | * 9 Tight ends\n* 8 Centers\n* 3 Kickers\n* 2 Punters\n* 1 Kick returner\n |\n\n\n\n\n## Player selections[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jump to round\n\n* 2\n* 3\n* 4\n* 5\n* 6\n* 7\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \\*\n | = compensatory selection |  |\n| †\n | = Pro Bowler[14] |\n\n | \n\nPositions key\n| **C** | Center |  | **CB** | Cornerback |  | **DB** | Defensive back |  | **DE** | Defensive end[a] |\n| **DL** | Defensive lineman | **DT** | Defensive tackle | **FB** | Fullback | **FS** | Free safety |\n| **G** | Guard[b] | **K** | Kicker[c] | **KR** | Kickoff returner | **LB** | Linebacker |\n| **LS** | Long snapper | **MLB** | Middle linebacker[d] | **OT** | Offensive tackle | **OL** | Offensive lineman |\n| **OLB** | Outside linebacker[a] | **NT** | Nose tackle | **P** | Punter | **PR** | Punt returner |\n| **QB** | Quarterback | **RS** | Return specialist | **RB** | Running back | **S** | Safety |\n| **SS** | Strong safety | **TE** | Tight end | **WR** | Wide receiver |\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** May sometimes be referred to as an edge rusher (EDGE)\n2. **^** Also known as offensive guard (OG)\n3. **^** Also known as placekicker (PK)\n4. **^** Also known as inside linebacker (ILB)\n |\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n![](image)Quarterback Alex Smith, taken first overall, struggled for his first few years before breaking out as a serviceable starter after 2011 for the San Francisco 49ers and later the Kansas City Chiefs and Washington Football Team.
